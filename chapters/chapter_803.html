<h1>Chapter 795: Body Cultivator</h1><p>“The Nascent Soul battle between the two clans… it’s still going on outside the Seven Kills Hall?”</p><p>Qin Sang hadn’t seen any sign of Nascent Soul cultivators earlier and assumed the conflict had ended.  He had been caught in the crossfire of a Nascent Soul battle before and had no desire to repeat the experience.  Unfortunately, his fears were about to be realized.</p><p>The two streaks of light chasing each other were now heading straight towards him.</p><p>Qin Sang cursed under his breath. Without a second thought, he activated his talismans and Sword Qi Thunder Sound, fleeing as fast as he could.</p><p>His protective light shimmered as he sped through the storm.</p><p>Even within the storm, the battle between the two Nascent Soul cultivators raged on, its intensity even more terrifying.</p><p>Hurricane winds howled.</p><p>Monstrous waves crashed.</p><p>Fortunately, they were over the sea. If this were on land, Qin Sang doubted any mountain could withstand the onslaught; no living creature could survive here for long.</p><p>As the Nascent Soul battle drew closer, Qin Sang’s heart pounded. He dodged with difficulty, allowing the storm to carry him along, finally escaping the immediate vicinity of the battlefield.</p><p>‘Boom…’</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>Amidst the ceaseless roar of the storm, booming thunder echoed.</p><p>Two figures pursued and clashed. One wielded a sword; the other held a black flute.</p><p>The flute produced no melody, only deafening thunder.  Illusory beast shadows charged out of the flute, ferociously attacking the swordsman.</p><p>With a flick of his wrist, the swordsman conjured dozens of sword lights that circled him, forming a sword array.  The array transformed into a cascading waterfall of sword qi, like a celestial river descending, tearing apart the beast shadows and striking at the flute.</p><p>The two seemed evenly matched, neither able to gain an advantage.</p><p>Exhausted by their prolonged battle within the storm, they tacitly moved towards its edge as they fought, leaving a trail of dispersed sword qi and beast shadows in their wake.</p><p>Despite his quick reaction, Qin Sang was caught in the aftermath. A sharp pain seared his back, and a massive wave, spurred by the sword qi, slammed him into the sea.</p><p>“Cough…”</p><p>Qin Sang’s face paled as he struggled to the surface.  Seeing the two streaks of light disappearing into the distance, he breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p>He worried that if the two clans’ Nascent Soul cultivators refused to yield, the fighting could escalate into a full-blown war.</p><p>Just then, the unexpected happened.</p><p>Blinding light erupted where the two had been fighting, indicating an even fiercer exchange.  A streak of green light struggled through the waves, desperately trying to avoid the shockwaves. It finally managed to clear the area as the two Nascent Soul cultivators departed.</p><p>At the last moment, the swordsman unleashed an incredibly powerful sword array. Countless sword shadows filled the sky, aimed at his opponent.</p><p>Undaunted, the flautist's black flute suddenly expanded. A phantom resembling a Qilin leaped out, shielding him from the attack.</p><p>Another evenly matched blow. They continued to fight as they disappeared into the depths of the storm.  However, the shockwave from the sword array lingered. The green streak, having already escaped the immediate battlefield, was caught by the residual force, first flung back by the blast, then assaulted by the scattering sword shadows.</p><p>Within the green light was a young man with a gaunt face and a hooked nose.</p><p>His eyes, sharp and focused, showed no panic in the face of the incoming sword shadows.  He glanced towards where the two Nascent Soul cultivators had vanished, confirming their departure, then let out a piercing shriek.</p><p>The shriek was followed by two glowing masses of green light erupting from his back.</p><p>The light shifted and formed into two enormous wings.</p><p>Though formed from light, the wings appeared incredibly realistic, covered in fine, intricate green feathers, creating wings of breathtaking beauty.</p><p>With a 'swoosh', the wings unfolded, then snapped shut, completely enveloping the hooked-nosed man.</p><p>The sword shadows struck.</p><p>'Bang, bang, bang...'</p><p>Feathers scattered as the wings were pierced, riddled with holes and tattered, yet they effectively protected the man within.  However, the force of the impact still sent him flying like a ball, propelled far away by the sword shadows.</p><p>Meanwhile, Qin Sang, having just emerged from the sea, witnessed the scene. He saw the man emerge from his damaged wings after absorbing the impact.  Qin Sang narrowed his eyes, surprised by this unexpected encounter.</p><p>"Though the remnants of the sword array and these two aren't as powerful as the Demon Lord or the Great Shaman, their power is still considerable. This man seems unscathed...as expected, he's a peak Core Formation cultivator!" Qin Sang concluded.</p><p>The hooked-nosed man also noticed Qin Sang, turning to face him with a deep frown. His first instinct was to retract his wings but realized it was too late.  Killing intent surged within him.</p><p>Unaware of the man's murderous intent, and with other Nascent Soul battles potentially raging nearby, Qin Sang didn't want to linger or interact with the hooked-nosed man.  After a brief glance, he turned to leave, confident that his bone flute would keep track of the man.</p><p>But as Qin Sang moved away, his expression darkened. The man was following him, his speed startling, his killing intent undisguised.</p><p>The distance between them rapidly closed.</p><p>Qin Sang spun around.</p><p>They locked eyes across the storm-tossed sea.</p><p>Qin Sang, sensing the man's unwavering resolve, was deeply perplexed.  He had no quarrel with this man. The man hadn't reacted to being tracked until now, indicating the bone flute hadn't been discovered. Why did the man look at him as if he were a sworn enemy?</p><p>Even if it were for robbery, the man's reaction was excessive.</p><p>Was it simply because Qin Sang had witnessed his vulnerable moment?</p><p>Pushing aside his confusion, Qin Sang felt a surge of alarm. This might be the strongest opponent he'd faced since reaching Core Formation. Without hesitation, he activated his talismans and flying sword, his speed exploding.</p><p>The hooked-nosed man, surprised by Qin Sang's sudden burst of speed, smirked.  His wings, now fully restored, beat gently, propelling him forward like a bolt of green lightning.</p><p>The wind and waves raged on.</p><p>Qin Sang fled through the tempest, the hooked-nosed man in hot pursuit.</p><p>As the chase continued, Qin Sang’s expression grew grim.  He knew the man was faster, but the ever-shifting storm should have made the pursuit more difficult.</p><p>Instead, the storm seemed to amplify the difference in their speeds.</p><p>Qin Sang now realized that while the hooked-nosed man’s cultivation wasn't as high as he initially thought, his strength lay in his physical body. This man was a body cultivator!</p><p>While Qin Sang had to expend spiritual energy to protect himself against the crashing waves, hindering his speed, the man simply charged through the wind and water with his physical prowess.</p><p>---</p><p>Out for fun, back late, thankfully it's the weekend, can sleep in.</p>
