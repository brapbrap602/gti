<h1></h1><p>Chapter 1330: Unexpected Turn of Events</p><p>"Rest assured, everyone. The ancient restrictions' power does not extend beyond the dark clouds. However, if anyone dares to venture inside, that's a different story altogether," Daoist Canghong said, his tone a mix of explanation and warning. "It seems the Old Demon Ye isn't here. Let's proceed with the plan and split up."</p><p>At this moment, the Heavenly Eye Butterfly had thoroughly scouted the surroundings and found nothing unusual.</p><p>Qin Sang withdrew his gaze from the dark clouds and looked deep into the Sin God Palace. This place was once a vast expanse of palaces, but now it was nearly impossible to discern their original purpose. The palaces lay in ruins, with collapsed walls and scattered debris everywhere. Not a single intact structure remainedâ€”only a complete wasteland!</p><p>In the void, dense clusters of ancient restrictions floated everywhere, far surpassing the Abyssal Ruins in complexity. Countless restrictions intersected, layer upon layer, influencing one another. Many areas were highly unstable, making progress perilous!</p><p>Through the tireless efforts of generations of cultivators from the Sin Abyss, a few relatively safe paths had been identified.</p><p>"Where is the entrance to the Purple Palace?" Daoist Zhenyi asked.</p><p>The others were equally curious. After observing for a while, they couldn't spot anything resembling an entrance.</p><p>"In the sky!" Daoist Canghong raised his head, gazing deep into the Purple Palace. "It's not visible from here. Once we pass through these palace ruins, you'll see a gathering of thunder within the dark clouds. The entrance is hidden there. Our predecessors noticed the anomaly long ago and speculated about it, but the thunder formed by the ancient restrictions is too terrifying. Many tried to investigate, only to give up in the end. One senior even perished within."</p><p>"Did you extract the secret technique to control the ancient restrictions from the demon's soul?" someone interjected.</p><p>"Indeed," Daoist Canghong nodded. "The restrictions around the entrance are intricately linked to the Purple Palace. Whenever the Purple Palace falls dormant, the entrance closes. That's why the Old Demon Ye had to wait until now to enter. Even so, we're too late to stop him. The signs of the entrance opening are subtle, making it difficult to track his movements..."</p><p>No longer holding onto any illusions, the group split up and entered the palace ruins as planned. Despite having a map, they remained cautious.</p><p>Qing Jun and Lu Boyuan took the lead and rear, respectively, while Qin Sang was protected in the middle, using his Heavenly Eye technique. The palace grounds were vast, and they had already been walking for half an hour.</p><p>Along the way, Qin Sang awakened the Fat Silkworm and the Fire Jade Centipede. If there were any hidden treasures or spiritual herbs, the two spirit insects might sense them. He also kept an eye on the Sword Spirit, monitoring any changes in the Slaughter Sword.</p><p>The three secret realms were interconnected. The Purple Palace and the Seven Slaughter Hall both contained fragments of the Slaughter Sword, so the Sin God Palace should be no exception. However, it was unclear whether the area had already been thoroughly looted. After walking for so long, neither spirit insect had reacted, and the Sword Spirit showed no signs of awakening.</p><p>The path twisted and turned.</p><p>After an unknown distance, Qing Jun, who was at the front, suddenly stopped and whispered, "We're out!"</p><p>Beyond the ruins, the atmosphere remained dark and oppressive. Once they emerged, they finally saw the place Daoist Canghong had mentioned.</p><p>Deep within the Sin God Palace, the dark clouds were more active, with lightning striking more frequently, as if drawn to something. A portion of the lightning continuously struck the same spot. However, the distance was still too great to see clearly.</p><p>Ahead, mountains loomed one after another, their outlines faint and indistinct. Iron chains crisscrossed the peaks, and the remnants of ancient fortresses could barely be discerned.</p><p>Flying was ill-advised in such a place. After a brief pause, the group activated their movement techniques and dashed toward the mountains.</p><p>The mountain terrain was treacherous, with sheer cliffs everywhere, connected by iron chains as thick as a man's embrace. A chilling wind blew, piercing to the bone. Even though they were all Nascent Soul cultivators, the cold still seeped into their bones as they walked along the chains, their faces pale.</p><p>After traversing several icy peaks, they found nothing of value.</p><p>Beyond the mountains lay a swamp.</p><p>Qing Jun took out the map and pointed to a specific location within the swamp. "One of the forbidden zones is here. The swamp's filth has corrosive properties, and it becomes more potent the further in you go. Be careful."</p><p>The group summoned their respective magical treasures, keeping them at waist height as they moved toward the target. Along the way, they encountered numerous ruins. Some were completely destroyed, while others still flickered with faint light, though they were also in disrepair.</p><p>The structures resembled cages, and it was unclear how many people had been imprisoned in this vast swamp.</p><p>After passing countless cages, they finally arrived at the forbidden zone.</p><p>What made this place a forbidden zone was its uniqueness. Unlike the surrounding cages, this area was empty, with other cages clearly built around it, marking it as the core.</p><p>The forbidden zone was densely packed with ancient restrictions, as dark as ink. Just standing outside, the group felt a sense of impending danger.</p><p>Above the forbidden zone, four gray stone pillars extended upward, their tips almost touching the dark clouds.</p><p>As soon as they arrived, they made a discovery. "The forbidden zone has been opened. The Old Demon Ye has been here!"</p><p>Outside the forbidden zone, a stone path led to a black gate. The iron lock on the gate had been torn off, and the restrictions had been breached!</p><p>"Whoosh!"</p><p>The group reacted swiftly, spreading out and forming a defensive formation.</p><p>The gate was slightly ajar, and inside, there was only silence.</p><p>Someone voiced their suspicion, "Could this be a ploy by the Old Demon Ye to delay us?"</p><p>"Possibly!"</p><p>Qing Jun, confident in his abilities, said, "Let's go in and investigate before deciding whether to notify the others."</p><p>The group landed on the stone path and cautiously entered. The traces left by the Old Demon Ye were obvious, leading straight to the end of the path. Along the way, every gate had been destroyed.</p><p>Without incident, they reached the depths of the forbidden zone.</p><p>"Just a few more layers, and we'll reach the core. If the Old Demon Ye is inside, it's best to call for reinforcements first," Lu Boyuan stopped Qing Jun and transmitted his thoughts.</p><p>The group quietly retreated from the forbidden zone, used their communication methods to notify the other two teams, and then set up a formation at the entrance.</p><p>Meanwhile, at the other two forbidden zones in the Sin God Palace, Daoist Canghong and the Nether Demon Lord were leading their respective teams in exploration. They, too, found traces left by the Old Demon Ye, but soon realized they were decoys, only present in the outer areas.</p><p>Upon receiving Qing Jun's message, the two teams hurriedly made their way to the swamp forbidden zone.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang and the others waited outside the forbidden zone, discussing their next steps while keeping watch. Suddenly, Qin Sang's peripheral vision caught something unusual deep within the dark clouds. He looked up sharply.</p><p>The others noticed it too.</p><p>The thunder around the entrance was intensifying, and at its center, a ring of lightning about the size of a millstone began to form. At first, the ring was small, but as time passed, it grew larger.</p><p>From the center of the ring, streams of multicolored light erupted, scattering into the void.</p><p>The group exchanged puzzled glances.</p><p>Several cultivators from the Sin Abyss who were with them also looked bewildered.</p><p>In the past, even when the entrance was opened, such an anomaly had never occurred!</p>
