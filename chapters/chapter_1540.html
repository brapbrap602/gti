<h1>Chapter 1531: Ganlu Temple (4k)</h1><p>Watching the images of the ferocious beast's rampage, everyone subconsciously held their breath.</p><p>The footage abruptly ended when the purple lightning appeared.</p><p>"I wonder who would prevail between the Grand Elder and this beast!"</p><p>The long-bearded Daoist let out a sigh, a look of longing on his face, "How long has it been since we last saw the Grand Elder make a move?"</p><p>"Since the Zhongyuan Dharma Assembly, when the Grand Elder's sword suppressed all Buddhas, who dared to be arrogant in front of him? In this world, how many are worthy of the Grand Elder's personal intervention?"</p><p>A Daoist beside him, his hair and beard as white as snow, the oldest among them, stroked his beard and smiled, filled with pride.</p><p>"I was too young then to participate in the assembly, a regret I carry to this day," a female Daoist, who had been about to meditate, chimed in.</p><p>Mentioning their own Grand Elder, whose power was no less than that of the mysterious beast, eased the oppressive atmosphere.</p><p>The long-bearded Daoist looked at the purple-robed elder, saying, "It seems the beast is simply driven by its savage nature, its combat power is exceptional, and its awareness of danger is extremely acute, making it hard to lure into a trap. The Jade Lightning Sound Array and the Vajra Subduing Demon Array, two formations designed to trap and kill, couldn't hold the beast. In the storm zone, our cultivators' strength will be restricted. The beast comes and goes as it pleases. With just a few of us, we can hardly achieve any effective results."</p><p>The purple-robed elder frowned in silence.</p><p>Seeing this, the long-bearded Daoist asked, "If the Grand Elder is unable to act, why not ask the Grand Elder to issue an order, gathering the strength of all sects to hunt the beast together?"</p><p>In fact, the Eight Views had enough influence within the Daoist community.</p><p>The problem was that they weren't facing just one beast.</p><p>No one knows how strong the next beast will be, or if there's a limit to the barrier protecting the cultivation world.</p><p>If a late-stage Nascent Soul beast, or something even more terrifying, were to appear, everyone would perish, without even a chance to escape into the cultivation world.</p><p>Using the purple cloth to activate the ancient forbidden magic on the island could instantly teleport people back to the vicinity of the island, but the capacity of the purple cloth is limited; we few are its maximum capacity.</p><p>For other sects, as long as the cultivation world barrier doesn't collapse, they don't need to worry about the storm zone.</p><p>The biggest benefit of hunting the beast might be the spiritual materials obtained from its body.</p><p>The beasts live in the chaotic spiritual energy of the storm zone; no one knows what mutations they've undergone, and they may be useless to cultivators.</p><p>If multiple sects join forces, the spoils will be divided, and the Eight Views will get the lion's share.</p><p>Under such circumstances, only the Grand Elder can persuade other sects to take the risk.</p><p>Hearing this, everyone looked over.</p><p>The purple-robed elder picked up a crystal.</p><p>This contemporary Grand Master of the Eight Views, always decisive, hesitated for a rare moment before saying, "The Grand Elder is not currently at the temple."</p><p>Everyone was stunned.</p><p>The Grand Elder, a supreme figure in the world, leaving the Eight Views to wander the world is normal and doesn't require informing these juniors.</p><p>But judging by the Grand Master's expression, it seemed more complicated.</p><p>"After the great upheaval a hundred years ago, the Grand Elder first went to Ganlu Temple, and then disappeared without a trace."</p><p>The purple-robed elder's tone was grave.</p><p>The pressure he had faced over the years was imaginable.</p><p>Everyone exchanged glances, their expressions serious.</p><p>The long-bearded Daoist said softly, "The previous message sword…"</p><p>The purple-robed elder glanced at his anxious colleagues, his expression softening, he chuckled, "It was indeed the Grand Elder, but it wasn't sent to the temple; a disciple stationed on an overseas immortal mountain received it."</p><p>Everyone breathed a sigh of relief, looking at the elder with reproving eyes.</p><p>Unexpectedly, even the Grand Master of a prestigious sect would deliberately frighten them.</p><p>However, they weren't truly at ease.</p><p>The Grand Elder's disappearance for a hundred years was unprecedented, and his recent appearance was merely a message sword sent to an overseas outpost.</p><p>Something had held him back for over a hundred years, leaving him no time even to send a message.</p><p>The long-bearded Daoist recalled the Grand Master's words, "Wait, the Grand Elder specifically went to Ganlu Temple before leaving. Could it be that the Holy One of Huiguang also…"</p><p>"Possible, but it's not easy to verify with Ganlu Temple."</p><p>The purple-robed elder looked around at everyone, "We'll still claim that the Grand Elder is in seclusion. We will do our best to gather information on the beast and make a decision when the Grand Elder returns."</p><p>…</p><p>When the beast won a decisive victory, Qin Sang had already escaped far away.</p><p>He didn't see the final outcome, but he could make some inferences.</p><p>He wondered whether the Eight Views had suffered losses in this battle.</p><p>Daring to hunt a Nascent Soul-stage beast, even without a Nascent Soul-stage Grand Master, the Eight Views' strength was probably no less than that of Xuan Tian Palace in its heyday, a behemoth anywhere.</p><p>"Central State is not only prosperous and has complete inheritance, but its understanding of the world is far superior to other places. In the North Sea and Canglang Sea, I have never heard of hunting beasts in storms."</p><p>Qin Sang felt he'd come to the right place, finally able to uncover a mysterious corner of this world.</p><p>He didn't rush to explore the Eight Scenic Spots.</p><p>Firstly, the timing wasn't right.</p><p>Secondly, his cultivation was still insufficient.  Finding the Buddha bone relic and improving his realm were priorities.  He could gather other information slowly, step by step.</p><p>His thoughts surging, Qin Sang flew continuously, finally leaving the storm zone and reaching the Central Plains!</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>Inside and outside the barrier were two completely different worlds.</p><p>"It looks no different from the North Sea!"  Having traveled thousands of miles to arrive, Qin Sang hovered over the sea, speaking lightly to himself, "I wonder where Liuli is now."</p><p>He hadn't expected to shake off the ferocious beasts so easily.  He should have arranged a closer meeting point.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced back.</p><p>Remembering the lesson from the North Sea, he suppressed his aura, slowly flying south. Soon, he was outside the storm zone's influence, and the sea gradually calmed.</p><p>The salty sea breeze blew over him.</p><p>The Sky-Eye Butterfly came out for a breath of fresh air, landing on Qin Sang's shoulder. Its wings fluttered contentedly, actually acting as a guard for him.</p><p>As he traveled, Qin Sang passed several small islands.</p><p>Due to the unpredictable weather, the islands were unsuitable for habitation, but there were clear signs of human activity. Qin Sang thought he was lucky to have avoided the desolate sea areas.</p><p>After flying for a while, Qin Sang finally saw human settlements on an island, though they were only ordinary people.</p><p>After asking the commoners about the nearest bustling island, Qin Sang went there without delay.  He found some cultivators on the island.</p><p>Qin Sang used some subtle methods to gather information, gaining a general understanding of the local situation and powers.</p><p>However, these low-level cultivators had limited vision. Qin Sang needed to find a major power or a Golden Core cultivator to get the information he wanted.</p><p>The seas near the storm zone were very barren.</p><p>Qin Sang needed to continue south to a place called White Crow Mountain.</p><p>White Crow Mountain referred to a city on an island.</p><p>Because the city was more famous than the island, the island's name was forgotten.</p><p>White Crow Mountain had the largest cultivator market within a thousand-mile radius.  It was said that Golden Core masters frequently appeared there, and the city lord was extremely mysterious, rarely seen.</p><p>After asking for directions, Qin Sang immediately set off.</p><p>Even though he only pretended to be a Golden Core cultivator, no one dared to provoke him.  His journey was smooth, and soon he saw an island jutting out from the sea.</p><p>This island was comparable in size to Green Sheep Island.</p><p>The docks were full of ships and people, a bustling scene.</p><p>Having not seen such a sight for a long time, Qin Sang stood for a while before walking towards White Crow Mountain, strolling leisurely, yet his pace was actually quite quick.</p><p>Some commoners vaguely saw a figure in a green robe pass by, rubbed their eyes, and saw nothing, thinking they had seen a ghost in broad daylight.</p><p>Shortly afterwards, Qin Sang appeared before the city gate of White Crow Mountain.</p><p>At that moment, an old man hurried out from the city gate.  His face was aged, but his spirit was vigorous. He was a late-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator. Sensing the Golden Core aura emitted by Qin Sang, he smiled brightly and bowed respectfully, "Senior, your arrival brings honor to our city! I am ordered by the city lord to guard the city gate. If you have any instructions, please let me know."</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at him, tossed a bag of spirit stones, and said indifferently, "Take me to the best cave dwelling in the city."</p><p>He planned to rest for a while.</p><p>The old man felt the weight of the bag. Seeing Qin Sang's generosity, his smile became even brighter. "There are three of the best cave dwellings in the market, and one of them happens to be vacant. Please come with me, Senior!"</p><p>The old man bowed and led the way, Qin Sang following behind.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang walking, and curiously looking around, the old man dared not urge him, and knowledgeably introduced the local customs of White Crow Mountain.</p><p>As they spoke, they arrived at the cultivator market.</p><p>The market was built on the mountaintop.</p><p>On one side was the City Lord's Mansion, and the other side's cave dwellings were reserved for outsiders.</p><p>The old man's status in the city was clearly not low; the cultivators they met along the way all treated him with respect, indicating he was at least a manager of the City Lord's Mansion.</p><p>Qin Sang was curious why such a person was assigned to guard the gate.</p><p>The closer they got to the cave dwellings, the more tranquil the environment became.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't hide his gaze, looking towards the City Lord's Mansion, pondering silently. He did not sense the aura of a Nascent Soul cultivator.</p><p>White Crow Mountain didn't seem worthy of being a Nascent Soul cultivator's cultivation ground.</p><p>At this time, seeing no one around, the old man slowed down and asked in a low voice, "I dare ask, Senior, did you come from the Northern Wasteland?"</p><p>"Northern Wasteland?"</p><p>Qin Sang immediately recalled the few words from the jade slip.</p><p>The Northern Wasteland referred to a vast area in the north of the Central Plains cultivator world. Even after many years, it still had the same name, indicating that the Central Plains hadn't changed much.</p><p>This island isn't far from the Northern Wasteland; I haven't lost my way.</p><p>"Why do you ask?"</p><p>Qin Sang narrowed his eyes, feigning anger, and stared coldly at the old man.</p><p>The old man felt a sudden tension, his heart chilled. He stammered, "Senior, please don't misunderstand. I have no intention of spying on you.  In recent years, many powerful cultivators like yourself have been drawn here from the Northern Wasteland by rumors of monstrous beasts appearing in the storms.  Because of this, the City Lord ordered me to guard the city gates to prevent anyone from disturbing you."</p><p>Monstrous beast rumors!</p><p>Recent years!</p><p>Qin Sang keenly noticed the implication, and snorted, "Why couldn't I have come from the Western Desert?"</p><p>The Western Desert is similar to the Northern Wasteland.</p><p>The Buddha bone relic, and the place where he and Liuli agreed to meet, are in the Western Desert.</p><p>The old man chuckled, "Senior is jesting. Legend says the Western Desert is the far west of the world, its westernmost edge is also an endless storm. Why would anyone risk the journey to see monstrous beasts here?"</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, looking as if he didn't want to bother with him, and said indifferently, "I've been in seclusion for many years, and only recently left. I've traveled to this area, but I've never heard of any monstrous beasts in the storm zone before."</p><p>The old man suddenly realized, "I apologize for my presumption! To be honest, these monstrous beasts have only appeared recently. I don't know which senior first saw them, but they've caused widespread panic. Some say that the beasts' lair has always been nearby, but they were hiding because of the world barrier, afraid to show themselves. Now that they're running rampant, it means the barrier is about to break, unable to contain them, and the world will...will face the end..."</p><p>Speaking of the end, the old man's voice was filled with unconcealed fear, a primal terror.</p><p>Storms, barriers, the cultivation world – these were concepts ingrained in him since birth, existing for countless years.</p><p>Now, they might be shattered, ushering in a cataclysmic change.</p><p>This conversation gave Qin Sang a lot of information.</p><p>He'd been wrong!</p><p>Based on his experiences in the storm zone, the monstrous beasts' lair certainly isn't near the cultivation world; they must have wandered in from somewhere unknown.</p><p>These monstrous beasts have only appeared recently.</p><p>No wonder Xiao Xiangzi didn't mention them on the sea chart.</p><p>Qin Sang chuckled wryly.  He and Liuli chose a rather unfortunate time to depart. Luckily, they only encountered monstrous beasts twice along the way, and managed to escape unharmed.</p><p>Or perhaps the changes have only recently occurred, and not many beasts are roaming around yet.</p><p>How will he return to the North Sea?</p><p>He doesn't believe he'll be so lucky every time.</p><p>"Escape, or drawn to something? What changes have occurred deep within the storm zone?"</p><p>Qin Sang pondered silently, thoughts flashing through his mind.</p><p>In his knowledge, the biggest change in over a hundred years was the ascension of Ziwei Palace – an unprecedented event.</p><p>Could there be a connection?</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't sure; his understanding of the cultivation world was still too limited.</p><p>Central State is filled with numerous sects; perhaps they know the reason.</p><p>Observing Qin Sang's silence, the old man continued, "Senior, if you're curious, please don't go searching for the beasts. They are the most terrifying creatures in the world, swift as thunder, capable of swallowing the sun and moon, destroying all things. Legend says a Nascent Soul cultivator once perished in their jaws, utterly helpless. Now, the storm zone has become a forbidden area. Senior, please don't risk your life!"</p><p>The old man racked his brain, using all his strength to describe the terror of the monstrous beasts.</p><p>Qin Sang understood. This rumor was true.</p><p>A Nascent Soul cultivator who is overconfident, encountering a monstrous beast head-on, would definitely be doomed.</p><p>"If Senior is truly curious about the monstrous beasts, I have a good idea," the old man paused, "My City Lord was fortunate enough to obtain a Shadowglow Stone, which contains a recording of a monstrous beast.  Rest assured, the source is absolutely reliable."</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at him, and directly threw a pouch of spirit stones.</p><p>The old man weighed the pouch, his face beaming. He gently rubbed his thumb and index finger, cast a spell, and a dark shadow soared from the City Lord's mansion – a black hawk.</p><p>The hawk held a crystal in its beak, its wings flapping, before landing on the old man's shoulder, tilting its head to observe Qin Sang.</p><p>The Shadowglow Stone played a recording.</p><p>It showed a skeletal bird, its entire body exposed bones without any flesh, with two crimson points glowing in its empty eye sockets, flashing past in the storm.</p>
