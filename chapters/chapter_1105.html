<h1>Chapter 197: The Corpse King</h1><p>Chapter 197: The Corpse King</p><p>“Here…”</p><p>Bai suddenly emerged from the corpse puppet bag, staring blankly at the Immortal Tombs.  He slowly walked towards a severely damaged stele, crouching down, his fingers lightly touching the inscriptions. The stele was so badly damaged that the characters were illegible.  After a long moment, Bai murmured, “I don’t know why, but seeing these tombs, I don’t recall any new memories, yet I have this indescribable feeling…”</p><p>Qin Sang stood silently beside him. Bai’s body was a cultivated corpse; his expression was unreadable. But from his tone, Qin Sang sensed a hint of sadness. The Immortal Tombs were vast and boundless, containing countless graves—remarkably similar to where Bai had been trapped.  The Purple Mist Forbidden Land also held a countless number of sealed corpses.</p><p>After a while, Bai stood up. Instead of returning to the corpse puppet bag, he walked forward alongside Qin Sang. Bai's gaze swept across the tombs, his eyes filled with wistfulness. Qin Sang, however, had no time for reminiscing. He knew how dangerous the Immortal Tombs were.  Powerful ghost kings, comparable to mid-Yuan Ying cultivators, resided here.  Once, a Yuan Ying ancestor named Dong Yun Xian was entangled by a ghost king, providing Dongyang Bo with some entertainment.</p><p>He summoned his ebony sword and the six-banner demon array.  Upon encountering any ghost, he swiftly eliminated it to avoid being surrounded and alerting the ghost kings. Compared to him, Bai moved with relaxed ease, seemingly at home in this environment.</p><p>After traveling for some time, they reached the depths of the Immortal Tombs. Suddenly, Bai stopped, turning his head to the right.</p><p>“What’s wrong?”</p><p>Qin Sang felt a surge of anxiety. He knew Bai’s abilities. In this place saturated with ghost energy, Bai's strength would be greatly enhanced—his own spiritual perception was far inferior.</p><p>Bai’s eyes showed a strange glint. “I think I’ve discovered a fellow practitioner.”</p><p>“Fellow practitioner?”</p><p>Qin Sang was startled, then realized something, exclaiming, “The Heavenly Corpse Talisman?”</p><p>Bai nodded. “Over the years, while I haven’t completely broken the Heavenly Corpse Talisman, I’ve gained some insights, allowing me to utilize some of its power. Just now, I sensed the aura of a cultivated corpse, very similar to the Heavenly Corpse Talisman.”</p><p>“I searched Xiaohan Region for many years without finding any sect with a lineage similar to the Heavenly Corpse Sect. What you sensed could very well be a corpse controlled by a Heavenly Corpse Talisman!”</p><p>Qin Sang's expression shifted.  He said joyfully, “I haven’t left any corpses here. Perhaps it’s one left by another Heavenly Corpse Sect cultivator!  Those controlled by the Heavenly Corpse Talisman are most likely living corpses, possessing higher intelligence than other corpses.  It’s not surprising they could survive in the Immortal Tombs. Of course, if it's another Heavenly Corpse Sect practitioner, capturing them will lead to clues!”</p><p>“I’ll go take a look…”</p><p>Bai nodded, his figure flashing as he vanished into the ghostly energy, darting towards that direction.</p><p>“Be careful!”</p><p>Qin Sang cautioned. He lacked the ability to conceal himself in the ghostly energy and could only slowly approach the area.</p><p>Soon, the ghostly energy around Qin Sang fluctuated, and Bai reappeared, delivering shocking news. “It’s not a simple living corpse; it’s a Corpse King, and an ownerless one!”</p><p>“A Corpse King? Impossible!”</p><p>Qin Sang was astonished.  According to the Heavenly Corpse Sect’s inheritance, the Heavenly Corpse Talisman could at most control a ferocious corpse comparable to a Foundation Establishment cultivator, then forcibly enhance it to a Flying Night Rakshasa through corpse pill techniques, after which it could not advance any further.</p><p>He had conducted experiments in the Witch God Continent, using the Heavenly Corpse Talisman to control a Nascent Soul cultivator, only to result in the talisman shattering and the soul dissolving.</p><p>He suspected that the Heavenly Corpse Sect controlled higher-level corpses not with the Heavenly Corpse Talisman, but with other talismans or treasures. Yet, here he was, encountering a Corpse King controlled by a Heavenly Corpse Talisman.</p><p>“Did I underestimate the Heavenly Corpse Talisman?”</p><p>Qin Sang frowned in thought. He considered himself among the strongest cultivators below the Yuan Ying stage in the art of corpse cultivation. Yet, he had misjudged this.  Could this Corpse King-level corpse have been left behind by a Heavenly Corpse Sect master?</p><p>“Since it’s a Corpse King, we shouldn’t provoke it.  We can capture it and investigate later,”</p><p>Qin Sang said. He also wanted to quickly understand the secrets of the Heavenly Corpse Talisman to rescue Ya Gu. A Corpse King was a formidable being that gave even Yuan Ying ancestors headaches. In the Immortal Tombs swarming with ghosts, avoiding it was the wisest choice.</p><p>Unexpectedly, before Qin Sang finished speaking, Bai stopped him with a hand.</p><p>"Wait! You forget my abilities? I sense that Corpse King isn't very intelligent, and the area is filled with ghostly energy. Perhaps we can try to kill it. Even if we can't defeat the Corpse King, I can use the ghostly energy to cover our escape."</p><p>"The Corpse King's body is harder than steel. Even with the ghostly energy, you won't be able to harm it, let alone kill it."</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head.</p><p>Such a risk was pointless.</p><p>The two of them were no match for the Corpse King.</p><p>Bai was still unwilling to give up and said seriously to Qin Sang: "Although the Corpse King lacks intelligence and is like an inanimate object, if it were another Corpse King or Ghost King, I wouldn't dare to have other thoughts. But this one is different. Since it has the Heavenly Corpse Talisman within it, I can try to use the talisman to limit its strength and movement.  Furthermore, my power here is even stronger than in the Purple Mist Wasteland. If we work together, we might stand a chance. Of course, even if we can keep the Corpse King occupied, it won't benefit us; we need a decisive blow!"</p><p>Before Bai finished, Qin Sang understood his plan.</p><p>The only way to harm the Corpse King was with the Twelve Demon Banners Formation.</p><p>"Based on my previous experience, I can barely activate the Twelve Demon Banners Formation with one bottle of Soul-Cleansing Liquid. However, I only have one bottle left. I was planning to save it for you. Are you sure you want to use it now? If we fail to defeat the Corpse King, it will be wasted."</p><p>At the foot of Yitian Peak.</p><p>He had taken two bottles of Soul-Cleansing Liquid from the Four Saints Palace disciple, consuming only one.</p><p>He kept the other bottle, and since the disciple hadn't mentioned it, he didn't say anything, putting it away to save for Bai.</p><p>Last time, it was rushed. The Fire Lotus had just been formed, and he had to take two bottles of Soul-Cleansing Liquid to barely control the Twelve Demon Banners Formation.</p><p>Qin Sang estimated that one bottle should be enough to stabilize the formation now.</p><p>"I feel that the Soul-Cleansing Liquid won't help me much. Let's gamble and try to capture and kill the Corpse King. Perhaps we can use this opportunity to uncover the secrets of the Heavenly Corpse Sect!"</p><p>Bai said without hesitation, his tone a little urgent.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at Bai, understanding his desire to escape their predicament.</p><p>He thought again, Bai always carried Soul-Nourishing Wood.</p><p>The Soul-Nourishing Wood's effect was no worse than the Soul-Cleansing Liquid.</p><p>"Good! Since you're willing to gamble, Qin agrees!"</p><p>Qin Sang didn't hesitate any longer and agreed.</p><p>Capturing and killing the Corpse King would benefit him as well!</p><p>Bai was overjoyed.</p><p>Time was of the essence. After carefully discussing and planning their escape route, they stealthily approached the Corpse King.</p><p>Bai concealed himself, scouting the surroundings. If there were other beings of the Corpse King's level nearby, they would have to abandon their plan.</p>
