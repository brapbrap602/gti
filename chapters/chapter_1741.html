<h1>Chapter 1732: Shifting Sands of Time</h1><p>Seven Kills Hall’s Transformation!</p><p>No need to ask to guess what kind of transformation it was.</p><p>Qin Sang’s eyes narrowed, a hint of regret flashing across them.  He had journeyed far to the Canglang Sea, harboring a sliver of hope for Seven Kills Hall, but alas, things did not go as planned.</p><p>“Su Nu also ascended with the celestial palace?”</p><p>Hearing Qin Sang’s question, Bao Zhengnan and Bao Xi’s expressions subtly shifted. They had been observing Qin Sang’s demeanor. When mentioning Su Nu, they deliberately avoided saying she ascended, only mentioning the celestial palace’s transformation. Qin Sang’s immediate understanding revealed he wasn’t entirely uninformed.</p><p>Bao Xi hesitated.</p><p>Bao Zhengnan nodded and replied: “Daoist Friend Qin, as you know, Seven Kills Hall was sealed by celestial restrictions, both inside and out. At that time, many cultivators entered the inner hall seeking treasures.  When the transformation began, many were trapped and couldn't escape. Fortunately, while entry was difficult, exit was easier.  Unable to contact Su Nu, we used the Sky Phoenix Feather to break the inner hall's celestial restrictions and escape Seven Kills Hall. It was only after Seven Kills Hall ascended that we saw her alone on the Yitian Peak, leaving only her back in sight.”</p><p>Recalling that day’s events,</p><p>both Bao Zhengnan and Bao Xi looked somewhat somber.</p><p>After Qin Sang entrusted Su Nu to their care, they brought her back to the Four Saints Palace.  Admiring Qingzhu’s character and hoping to cultivate goodwill with both Qingzhu and Qin Sang, the Four Saints Palace treated Su Nu exceptionally well.</p><p>After Su Nu recovered, she had nowhere to go.</p><p>For her, the Four Saints Palace was a haven, a place where she could live without worry, unlike before when she had to constantly watch her back, fearing assassination. Accepting the Bao siblings’ invitation, she stayed.</p><p>In the time leading up to the celestial palace's ascension, the Bao siblings and Su Nu spent every day together, forming a close friendship.</p><p>During this time, their conversations often centered on Qin Sang and Qingzhu, their curiosity piqued.  Whenever Qin Sang was mentioned, Su Nu would become silent.  The Bao siblings attributed her silence to shyness; only Su Nu knew she simply had nothing to say, understanding little about Qin Sang.</p><p>In Seven Kills Hall, Su Nu recognized Qin Sang as the one who had spared her life, and she had no other options; she had to take a desperate gamble.</p><p>Having experienced the world's coldness and kindness, she was prepared for Qin Sang to break his promise.</p><p>Being Qin Sang’s servant was better than being at the mercy of the Dongji Alliance’s leader.</p><p>At the time, Qin Sang was only a Golden Core cultivator. Su Nu was confident in her acting, believing she could gain Qin Sang’s trust, wait for him to relax his guard, and then find an opportunity to strike back.</p><p>Unexpectedly, not only did Qin Sang save her life and crush the Ghost Seal, freeing her from servitude, he also helped her find a place to live.</p><p>Su Nu had wondered many times about the kind of person he was. Learning about the Demon Suppression War from the Bao siblings, she also longed to see Qin Sang again.</p><p>Sadly, after that, Qingzhu and Qin Sang vanished as if into thin air.</p><p>Bao Xi added, “Su Nu helped us obtain the inheritance within the secret realm, allowing the Four Saints Palace to flourish.  My brother and I were extremely grateful to her, but we never had the chance to repay her kindness. We can only hope she'll once again overcome danger and safely ascend to the Upper Realm.”</p><p>Qin Sang fell silent in thought.</p><p>Judging from their tone, numerous cultivators had been trapped in the inner hall and ‘ascended’ with Seven Kills Hall.</p><p>The celestial palace's ascension was something no one expected.</p><p>If not for Ye Laomo’s turbulent actions, making him a public enemy of the Northern Star Region and provoking a three-region siege, the number of cultivators trapped in the Purple Micro Palace would have likely been no less than those in Seven Kills Hall.</p><p>These people lacked the protection of the Ascension Platform; unless blessed with exceptional luck, most would have perished in the spatial turbulence.</p><p>Did Su Nu survive?</p><p>Qin Sang looked up slightly. “Could the two Daoist Friends describe the scene of Seven Kills Hall’s ascension?”</p><p>He remembered the ethereal celestial palace above Seven Kills Hall, its magnificent aura. Compared to the Purple Micro Palace in its true form, it was no less impressive.</p><p>And the Demon Lord sealed beneath Yitian Peak, would the celestial palace's ascension have impacted the sealing restriction?</p><p>Bao Xi nodded and spoke softly.</p><p>Unlike the Purple Micro Palace, Seven Kills Hall's inner and outer halls were one, breaking through the void and flying away together. When the transformation occurred, all the cultivators were exploring the inner hall. While they didn't know where Seven Kills Hall was going, they knew that being pulled into a spatial rift by Seven Kills Hall would be disastrous.</p><p>All the cultivators only cared about escaping.</p><p>The Sky Phoenix Feather brought by the Jiao Dragon King ended up in the hands of the Four Saints Palace.  Their party had gone too deep, and they lingered longer searching for Su Nu.  When they discovered Seven Kills Hall was about to fly away, in a moment of crisis, they destroyed the Sky Phoenix Feather to escape with their lives.</p><p>Not only did the human race suffer heavy losses, but the number of Wu tribe cultivators taken away by Seven Kills Hall was also significant.</p><p>After the Demon Subjugation War, top human cultivators died one after another, greatly weakening human strength.  Facing internal strife and external threats, Elder Fang suggested a joint exploration of the Inner Sanctum with the human race, a proposal they reluctantly accepted.</p><p>For the Wu tribe, this was undoubtedly good news.  The Inner Sanctum, it turned out, held Wu ancestral treasures, potentially offering a chance to restore their lost heritage.</p><p>Unexpectedly, before they could find anything, the Celestial Palace Ascension occurred.</p><p>This loss was even more devastating than the previous one.  Many Wu cultivators, both Yuan Ying masters and rising talents – the tribe's very backbone – perished.  This was a crushing blow to the already declining Wu tribe.</p><p>It was also a calamity for the human race, but their deep foundations allowed them to endure.</p><p>The Wu tribe has yet to recover. If not for the distraction of a conflict with the demon race, the humans might have already attacked the Wu God Continent.</p><p>Bao Xi, recounting these events, sighed at the unpredictable nature of fate.</p><p>Returning to the Four Saints Palace expedition, they only dared to look back after fleeing the Seven Killing Hall in a rush.</p><p>At that time, celestial prohibitions raged outside the Seven Killing Hall. Above the Inner Sanctum, celestial clouds surged, radiating brilliant light, forming a mirage-like image of magnificent palaces, ethereal and dreamlike.</p><p>Su Nu stood atop Yitian Peak, directly beneath the celestial palace.</p><p>Yitian Peak itself displayed strange phenomena.  The Demon Suppression Stele glowed a vibrant green, illuminating the entire peak inside and out like a jade carving.</p><p>Below, more wonders unfolded:  a divine furnace shimmered on one side, while a divine dragon circled on the other.</p><p>Between these three, a black mass pulsed like a heart, revealing a corner of a blood coffin.</p><p>The Bao siblings, veterans of the Demon Subjugation War, recognized the blood coffin as the Demon Lord's prison.  Clearly, the Demon Lord was still alive.</p><p>The sight terrified the Bao siblings.  Fearing the Demon Lord's release and the ensuing devastation, they then witnessed the Celestial Palace's ascension.</p><p>The imprisoned Demon Lord and Su Nu were both taken by the ascending palace, their whereabouts unknown.</p><p>Bao Xi painstakingly detailed the scene and the cultivators' experiences.</p><p>Due to the distance, they couldn't see what happened to Su Nu. Based on this information, Qin Sang couldn't determine whether she survived.</p><p>The outer hall of the Seven Killing Hall also ascended. This differed from Qin Sang's expectation; he'd thought some places, like the outer hall's celestial tower, might remain. He was mistaken.</p><p>Qin Sang mused, "Friend, you mentioned uniting with the Wu tribe against the demon race, and several cultivators stationed on Tianxing Island.  Does this mean the demon race is too strong, and war is imminent?"</p><p>Bao Xi looked to his brother.  Bao Xi had mainly done the speaking, with Bao Zhengnan occasionally adding details.</p><p>His expression turned serious. He looked deeply at Qin Sang, ignoring his question and asking instead, "Forgive my boldness, but are you, Daoist Qin, from the outer regions?"</p><p>His sudden disappearance and reappearance, with nearly six hundred years of silence in between, and his current cultivation surpassing theirs, was quite astonishing.</p><p>Such a cultivation level couldn't be achieved through secluded cultivation alone.</p><p>If Qin Sang had remained in the Canglang Sea, he wouldn't be unknown or have missed the opportunity to enter the Seven Killing Hall.</p><p>There was only one explanation!</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze swept across the three, and he nodded, readily admitting, "Elder Qingzhu and I are from the North Sea. The North Sea also has a celestial palace, connected to the Seven Killing Hall through a celestial array. After the Demon Subjugation War, I returned to the North Sea.  When the Seven Killing Hall ascended, the North Sea celestial palace ascended with it; otherwise, I would have visited you both sooner."</p><p>"North Sea?"</p><p>The three exchanged glances, expressing both confusion and curiosity.</p><p>Qin Sang, with his keen senses, noticed their change in expression. He asked, "Are you unfamiliar with the North Sea?"</p><p>Bao Zhengnan said, "We've heard of outer regions beyond the storms, but our knowledge is limited."</p><p>Qin Sang was quite surprised.</p><p>The Four Saints Palace is a powerful sect, and even before the rise of the human race, the Wu tribe had produced powerful cultivators. They shouldn't be so ignorant of the outside world.</p><p>Bao Zhengnan saw Qin Sang's confusion. Without explanation, he pressed on, "Since the teleportation array is gone, how did you determine the location of the Canglang Sea?"</p><p>"I traveled through the Central Plains and obtained a relic from a Wu elder, containing a sea chart," Qin Sang produced the chart.</p><p>Bao Zhengnan nodded repeatedly after examining it, then smiled mysteriously, "Daoist, following this chart, did you find anything inconsistent near the Canglang Sea?"</p><p>Qin Sang paused, recalling an event!</p><p>When searching for the last refuge, he hadn't found it at the marked location on the chart. He'd used his divine sense to search for a long time, finally finding it hundreds of miles away.</p><p>The sea changes, and the earth shifts.  Especially in the volatile storms, restrictions being affected and shifting is not unusual; Qin Sang hadn't thought much of it.</p><p>From Bao Zhengnan's tone, it seemed he had anticipated this.  Was there some hidden truth?</p><p>"Fellow Daoist, you're fortunate to seek me out during the Immortal Palace's ascension.  While the Qisha Hall still existed, you would never have found the Canglang Sea using only this map," Bao Zhengnan said, surprising Qin Sang.</p><p>"I'd be grateful for details," Qin Sang said, puzzled. This was unlike anything in the other three realms.</p><p>"This was discovered by the Four Sacred Ancestors, and I learned of it from ancient texts.  In the past, the Wu Clan was powerful, with many experts among them who must have noticed it. Before the Qisha Hall ascended, a strange force surrounded the Canglang Sea, difficult to detect, yet undeniably present. This force was like an invisible barrier, encircling the sea. Those inside could leave, but those outside could not enter.  The area covered was so vast that even a Nascent Soul cultivator would struggle to reach the edge without rest.  We didn't understand the source of this power, assuming it was a rule of this world's heavens, like the storm barrier.  Only after the Qisha Hall ascended did we discover the force originated from it.  With the Hall's ascension, the barrier dissipated, causing the shift."</p><p>Bao Zhengnan's explanation was incredible.</p><p>Qin Sang, however, kept staring at the last refuge on the sea chart.</p><p>This refuge was close to the Canglang Sea, but incredibly distant from the second refuge—only a Transcending Tribulation cultivator could traverse such a distance amidst ceaseless storms.</p><p>The intervening area was completely blank!</p><p>Qin Sang then recalled the Ghost Mother's experience. She could infiltrate Xiaofangcun Mountain, yet failed to find any trace of the Wu Clan in the Central Plains. If Bao Zhengnan's words were true, Transcending Tribulation cultivators from the Canglang Sea could leave, but those from the outside could not enter, hence the outside world's ignorance of the Wu Clan.</p><p>"Could Transcending Tribulation cultivators from the Canglang Sea not return after leaving?" Qin Sang asked.</p><p>Bao Zhengnan hesitated.  "That, I don't know. However, according to the texts, our ancestor, Bao Gu, never returned after leaving.  Perhaps this Wu Clan elder left the map hoping to find a way to travel between the realms?"</p><p>Qin Sang recalled her experiences in the different realms.</p><p>Each realm's Immortal Palace was connected yet possessed unique wonders.</p><p>The Beihai Purple Micro Palace was secluded, the Central Plains' two Immortal Palaces were linked, and the Western Territory's Immortal Palace remained silent and withdrawn.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang's silence, Bao Zhengnan continued, "Protected by the Qisha Hall was not only the Canglang Sea, but also the Yao Sea."</p><p>"Yao Sea?"</p><p>Qin Sang looked surprised. "Could it be...?"</p><p>"As you suspect, Fellow Daoist.  The Canglang Sea and the Yao Sea are not far apart. Both were protected by the Qisha Hall, yet separated by it, unable to reach each other, and non-interfering. The Four Ancestors might have sensed something; they unexpectedly entered the Yao Sea through the Qisha Hall, but couldn't determine the exact distance between the two seas. However, the teleportation array between the two realms was established then, and the ancestors passed down the Shayao Pill, encouraging demon hunting and pill refinement, leading to the rise of humanity."</p><p>Bao Zhengnan sighed. "We controlled the teleportation array, able to come and go freely. Even if the Yao Sea demons were stronger, they could only be passively attacked. But after the Qisha Hall's ascension, the barrier disappeared, changing the situation. The distance between the two realms was closer than imagined. The Yao Sea lies southeast of the Canglang Sea, and even Transformation Stage demon kings could cross the storm zone to reach the Canglang Sea."</p><p>He looked deeply at Qin Sang.  "You can imagine our terror upon discovering that the demons could directly invade our homeland. Both races suffered calamities at that time, countless experts lost in the Qisha Hall's destruction, while the Yao Sea only lost one Jiao Dragon King. If the demons had launched a full-scale invasion, both races might have ceased to exist, and you would never have met us..."</p><p>Bao Xi and Zhuo Ming shared solemn expressions.</p><p>Bao Zhengnan didn't detail the events of the past few hundred years, but one can imagine the arduous struggle.  Fortunately, the Four Sacred Palace received a great inheritance, producing many experts who stemmed the tide of the demon invasion.</p><p>Even today, relations between the two realms remain tense, requiring Bao Zhengnan and Zhuo Ming's personal presence in Tianxing Island.</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't expected the Canglang Sea and the Yao Sea to be so close.</p><p>Compared to the other three realms, these two were exceptionally unique.</p><p>Before humanity's rise, the Canglang Sea was the Wu Clan's territory.</p><p>The Yao Sea was the demons' domain.</p><p>Qin Sang also noticed that while the Yao Sea demons might be weaker than those in the Central Plains, they possessed many unique bloodlines.  She had only seen descendants of divine beasts like the Celestial Phoenix and Ghost Chariot in the Yao Sea – their origins were surely extraordinary.</p><p>The protection afforded by the Qisha Hall to these two realms might have been a deliberate act by their ancestors, allowing the Wu and Yao clans to recuperate and avoid human interference.</p><p>Sadly, things didn't go as planned, and humanity in the Canglang Sea eventually rose to prominence.</p><p>At this moment, the usually taciturn Zhuo Ming spoke, "The storms are now rife with ferocious beasts, fraught with danger.  Fellow Daoist travels widely—are you not afraid of encountering them?"</p><p>(End)</p>
