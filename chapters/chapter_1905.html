<h1>Chapter 1896: The Great Ascension Dojo</h1><p>The woman’s arrival went unnoticed by Qin Sang.  She wore blood-red battle attire, a faint aura of blood swirling around her, making her already ethereal form even more hazy and her features indistinct.  However, Qin Sang could sense the energy radiating from her.  It was a feeling of intense unrest and ferocity, which she couldn't conceal despite her efforts to suppress it.  It was as if Qin Sang were facing a ferocious beast, ready to pounce at any moment, sending shivers down his spine.  The feeling was strikingly similar to the Blood Moon that had pursued him in the Storm Realm!</p><p>The woman remained noncommittal, her gaze falling upon Qin Sang's dantian.  She said softly, "Lend me your sword."</p><p>The Earth Slaughter Sword within his dantian trembled without cause. Qin Sang was startled, realizing he was powerless to stop it.</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>A flash of sword light, and the Earth Slaughter Sword shot from his dantian, hanging between them.  This sword had been by Qin Sang's side for years, remaining dormant except when its spirit sensed something. Its appearance was ancient and simple, its luster dull, hardly resembling a precious artifact.  Now, the Earth Slaughter Sword trembled gently, radiating a brilliant light, revealing a splendor Qin Sang had never witnessed.  The cracks on its surface seemed to have healed, as if it were a completely different sword.</p><p>The woman gazed at the Earth Slaughter Sword, her expression complex.  She murmured, "You're finally awake.  It's not too late…"</p><p>A figure materialized from the sword's light: a young boy in green robes, seemingly asleep.</p><p>The boy's eyelids fluttered, and he slowly opened his eyes.  He apologized, "Someone has been trying to divine my location. I haven't fully recovered, so I've been sealing myself off, and I didn't sense your call…"</p><p>Upon seeing the woman's condition, his voice faltered, and his face showed urgency, "What happened to you…?"</p><p>"Searching for my sister… I’ve been traversing the River of Misery for an eternity, lost in its depths…"</p><p>The woman’s eyes were filled with sorrow, her voice low.  She couldn't remember how much time had passed, nor did she know if her quest would bear fruit.  An unwavering belief had sustained her through her solitary journey across the River of Misery, leading her to gradually lose herself in it.  She had pursued her goal relentlessly, sparing no effort, and heaven finally rewarded her perseverance. Though, she only found the person's sword!</p><p>The green-robed boy knew of the woman's ordeal, his eyes reflecting pity and sadness.</p><p>Suddenly, the woman’s expression changed. Her gaze became intense as she stared at the boy, her words unspoken, her eyes revealing an anxious expectation. She wanted to ask, yet feared the worst possible answer.</p><p>The boy paused, his face showing compassion and immeasurable grief.  His lips moved, silently speaking.</p><p>The woman trembled, her sorrow profound.  Her grief was so intense that it moved heaven and earth. The heavenly tribulation clouds had just dissipated, yet now dark clouds were gathering once more.</p><p>Black clouds roiled, a biting wind howled, the atmosphere heavy with death.</p><p>"Hehehehehe…"</p><p>The woman's hair and beard danced wildly, as if she were descending into demonic madness, letting out strange laughter.  The laughter was shrill, like the screech of a demon, transforming the divine court into a hellish realm.</p><p>The blood aura around her violently surged, her breath uneven, her ethereal form contorting as if she were losing her sanity and descending into madness – extremely dangerous!</p><p>Qin Sang was terrified, instinctively stepping back.</p><p>The green-robed boy sighed, about to speak again.</p><p>Suddenly, the woman's sorrow vanished, replaced by boundless killing intent. She barked, "Is the blade still sharp?"</p><p>The green-robed boy's expression turned serious. Without a word, he merged into the sword.</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>A divine blade appeared.</p><p>The sword intent shook the heavens!</p><p>The woman looked towards the Nine Heavens Thunder City.</p><p>"The Divine Court has emerged, the Dao returns to the Great Thousand World.  Joyful occasion!  This event is sudden; I haven't prepared a congratulatory gift, but I present you with a Great Ascension Dojo.  However, the Celestial Master must retrieve it personally. Celestial Master… dare you accept?"</p><p>Her voice boomed like thunder, piercing the clouds!</p><p>…</p><p>Zhong Mao Zhi, the ritual altar.</p><p>War raged everywhere, above and below.</p><p>The chaos did not reach here.</p><p>The Zhong Mao Zhi Academy remained peaceful, no one daring to disturb Master Zhang's seclusion.  Whether it was the summoning of the Taiyin Yuanjun or the descent of the Thunder Ancestor, regardless of how grand the celestial phenomena were, the Academy’s main hall remained closed.</p><p>'Dong! Dong! Dong!'</p><p>The Gui Fang Kingdom demons were beating their demonic drums again.</p><p>The border war was still ongoing. While many beasts had been frightened away by the Thunder Ancestor's aura, many remained, driven by savagery.</p><p>However, the drums sounded significantly weaker than before, lacking confidence.</p><p>The Thunder Ancestor's divine might was terrifying. The sight of eight directions of thunder dragons converging was deeply etched into the minds of the demons, impossible to erase.</p><p>The Daoist cultivators, on the other hand, were invigorated. They even took advantage of the chaos of the beast tide to actively sortie from the city, fighting valiantly.</p><p>With Lei Zu's aid, what fear is there of mere demons?</p><p>However, the two Grand Masters stationed at Zhongmao Zhen altar know that the situation remains fraught with peril.  Outsiders covet the Divine Court and could return at any time, perhaps even more than one.  Lei Zu's power is only a single strike, and summoning him left Wei Zhenjun exhausted; he cannot act again for some time.</p><p>Now, the entire Daoist sect's hope rests on Zhang Zhenjun!</p><p>The two sat on their respective altars, took pills, and hastened to recover their qi, occasionally glancing towards the Academy with worried expressions.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>A brilliant light shone from the horizon – the Baishi Zhen talisman. The talisman hung high in the sky, seemingly intending to resonate with the Zhongmao Zhen talisman.  Unfortunately, the Academy remained unchanged.</p><p>At that moment, the two Grand Masters sensed a fluctuation in the spiritual energy of Heaven and Earth.  Immediately understanding, their faces lit up with joy.</p><p>'Whoosh whoosh!'</p><p>A violent wind swept through the Academy's main hall.</p><p>Spiritual tides obscured the sky.</p><p>This phenomenon had occurred recently, signifying Zhang Zhenjun's breakthrough to the mid-stage. Now, its reappearance meant only one thing: Zhang Zhenjun had achieved consecutive breakthroughs, reaching the late stage of the Hetu realm.  Only one more step to become a Heavenly Master!</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>Spiritual tides surged, emitting an awe-inspiring power that shook the two Grand Masters, relentlessly pouring into the Academy's main hall.</p><p>Soon, the tides dissipated, and the celestial phenomena subsided. The Academy's main hall fell silent.</p><p>The two Grand Masters exchanged glances, worry etched on their faces.</p><p>"Perhaps Zhenjun is consolidating his cultivation…" one murmured.</p><p>Before the words were finished, a figure appeared above the Academy's main hall – Zhang Zhenjun.</p><p>Overjoyed, the two were about to rise and pay their respects, but Zhang Zhenjun raised a hand to stop them.</p><p>Standing in midair, Zhang Zhenjun, though his breath still unsettled from the hasty breakthrough, possessed unparalleled power. He was the first Zhenjun to reach the late Hetu stage since the decline of the Daoist Court!</p><p>His eyes shone with divine light. His gaze swept across the Daoist's dual altars, the northern and southern battlefields, the Jusan Zhen altar, and finally, a fleeting glance towards the Grand Sage's Mansion.</p><p>The drumming suddenly faltered. The demon king beating the drum felt a chill run down his spine, a sense of impending doom, his hand trembling on the drumsticks.</p><p>Ignoring the demons, Zhang Zhenjun looked upwards, observing Tianyue Shangren and the Great Demon Saint locked in fierce combat.  He grasped the situation at a glance.</p><p>Gently adjusting his robes, Zhang Zhenjun, holding the Zhongmao Zhen talisman, ascended into the heavens.</p><p>After summoning Lei Zu, Wei Zhenjun hadn't dispersed the Heavenly Earth Xuan altar. Zhang Zhenjun took control, and his actions immediately caused the altar to resonate.  With each step he took, the altar's divine light intensified, soon surpassing its previous peak.</p><p>Still unsatisfied, upon reaching the altar, he bowed to Baishi Zhen: "Daoist Wei, aid me!"</p><p>Wei Zhenjun, putting aside her fatigue, nodded solemnly. She knew the divine being they would summon next was extraordinary, requiring one of the three highest Daoist ceremonies: the Luotien Grand Rite.  Zhang Zhenjun might be hard-pressed alone and needed her assistance.  Though she was not fully recovered, she could serve as the "du jiang" (lit. "all speaker") and "jian zhai" (lit. "supervising the fast"), supporting Zhang Zhenjun, the "gao gong" (lit. "high functionary").</p><p>Gao gong, du jiang, and jian zhai are the three main roles in the ritual ceremony. The gao gong, who performs the steps and communicates with deities, holds the highest position. The du jiang serves as his assistant, increasingly vital in major ceremonies.</p><p>Wei Zhenjun calmed her breath, flew to the Baishi Zhen talisman she had previously deployed, and stood beneath it, her expression serious.</p><p>Then, Zhang Zhenjun pointed to the Jusan Zhen altar at Heming Mountain, from the Yintian Palace, a beam of spiritual light emerged – fragments of the Jusan Zhen talisman.</p><p>The three talismans shone together!</p><p>A command went out to the three altars. All the main altar cultivators immediately acted according to the instructions.</p><p>Zhang Zhenjun, commanding the three talismans, held incense, sending its fragrance to the heavens, and bowed to the Divine Court.</p><p>A more complex and grand ceremony than before began.</p><p>As the Luotien Grand Rite proceeded, some cultivators remained in the various immortal cities to defend them, while the rest of the Daoist cultivators summoned their altars and gradually merged them into the Heavenly Earth Xuan altar.</p><p>"Six dragons ascend to the left, nine tigers guard the center.</p><p>Reveal the power of three heads and six arms,</p><p>Wield the might of the seven governing stars and eight spiritual essences.</p><p>The Emperor's bell resounds, myriad saints arrive;</p><p>The axe and halberd flash, demons crumble and shatter.</p><p>Radiant light ever protects all beings;</p><p>True nature, unwavering, eternally upholds the righteous path.</p><p>Severing corpses across thousands of miles, slaying five types of ghosts.</p><p>Great compassion, great vows, great saint, great mercy.</p><p>Heavenly grace, extending blessings, cleansing evils, safeguarding life,</p><p>North Pole Heavenly Peng, Great Marshal of eighty-one armies,</p><p>Attained Buddhahood, Dharma clouds universally cover the heavens!"</p><p>Zhang Zhenjun led the myriad True Ones, his incantations shaking the three realms.</p><p>At this moment, the Daoists chanted the “Tian Peng Bao Gao,” a scripture to summon Tian Peng, the Great Marshal, one of the Four Sacred Ones of the North Pole.</p><p>As the final incantation echoed, the Xuan Tan Altar blazed with dazzling golden light.  Countless Daoist cultivators gazed upward, hearts pounding with excitement. After the Thunder God, they were about to summon another supreme deity!</p><p>Unexpectedly, the golden light quickly faded, leaving only the reverberating chants.  No god descended.</p><p>“What happened?”</p><p>“Where is the Great Marshal Tian Peng?”</p><p>…</p><p>Doubt and disquiet rippled through the Daoist ranks.  The perceptive sensed something amiss. Even a fragment of a deity, summoned by the Luo Tian Grand Rite, would elicit some response.  Only one possibility remained: the divine talisman was shattered; the Great Marshal Tian Peng was gone.</p><p>Panic, grief, fear… these emotions spread amongst the cultivators.</p><p>Zhang Zhenjun, seemingly unfazed, paused briefly, then continued the recitation.</p><p>“In the wondrous heavens, to the right of the Bright Palace,</p><p>Leading the Heavenly Gang's subordinate marshal, ranking among the princes of the lower earth…”</p><p>One of the Four Sacred Ones of the North Pole: Tian You, the Great Marshal!</p><p>“Imperial merit accomplished, celestial rank attained.</p><p>Controlling the commands of the Three Caves and Five Thunders, wielding the balance of the eight heavens and nine earths…”</p><p>The “Yi Sheng Bao Gao”!</p><p>After reciting the three scriptures, the same silence followed.  Countless Daoist cultivators looked to the heavens, as if questioning why the gods had abandoned them. Their expressions were filled with grief and anger; their chants carried a heavy note of sorrow.</p><p>Even after the final scripture, the “Zhen Wu Bao Gao” for Zhen Wu, the Great Emperor—the last of the Four Sacred Ones—was chanted, there was no response.</p><p>The Four Sacred Ones of the North Pole… all perished!</p><p>The Daoists’ sorrowful cries shook the heavens.  Some roared in anguish, venting their grief and despair.</p><p>This outpouring of emotion intensified the Xuan Tan Altar’s glow. Zhang Zhenjun paused, closed his eyes slightly, and carefully sensed the altar.</p><p>In the days of the Daoist sect’s glory, talismanic and divine paths were equally potent.  The divine path produced a deity who embodied the power of the Earth Mother.  The talismanic path, through the Dou Department, not only cultivated the Four Sacred Ones of the North Pole, whose status equaled that of the Thunder God, but also achieved even greater feats, producing the second stage of the Cave Truth talisman—the Heavenly Emperor of Gou Chen Shang Gong.</p><p>His power matched that of the Earth Mother deity!</p><p>The Four Sacred Ones were destroyed in the Great Calamity, yet the Gou Chen Emperor remained!</p><p>However, summoning the Gou Chen Emperor was no easy feat, even for him.  Furthermore, he couldn't afford to have only one powerful strike, like Wei Zhenjun before him.</p><p>The Divine Court has appeared, the boundary is dissolving. This world will return to the Greater Cosmos. The Daoist sect’s hope rested solely on him. He must unite the Daoists’ power, transform into the Gou Chen Emperor, control the talisman, repel the invaders, and subdue the wicked.  He must lead the Daoists into the Greater Cosmos, and protect countless lives!</p><p>“The hearts of men can be used!”</p><p>Zhang Zhenjun’s expression shifted. He began to chant again.</p><p>“Purple Micro, the Apex of the Heavens, Gou Chen Heavenly Palace.</p><p>Within the Nine-Light Treasure Garden, above the Five-Judgement Halls.</p><p>Embodying the Primal Emperor and assisting Xuan Hua, overseeing the two poles and governing the three talents.</p><p>Controlling the balance of warfare, widely promoting great virtue;</p><p>Governing the courses of the stars, ensuring the unchanging order.</p><p>The upper form is majestic, the true essence is vast.</p><p>Great compassion, great vows, great sage, great mercy.</p><p>Gou Chen Shang Gong, Heavenly Emperor!”</p><p>Ten thousand voices chanted in unison. The powerful incantations soared towards the heavens!</p><p>Within the Divine Court, in the Purple Forbidden Enclosure, a divine palace suddenly shone. The sacred image within was intact, exuding boundless majesty, unlike the Thunder God’s cracked form.</p><p>After the heavenly thunder, celestial phenomena appeared again.  The moonlight dimmed, as if night had fallen.  Hidden stars reappeared, their lights intertwining, constellations forming.  This was the familiar night sky of the mortal world.</p><p>However, the stars shone brighter than ever before, a dazzling river of light, even the dimmest stars clearly visible, as if within reach.</p><p>The starlight filled the heavens!  This was not just starlight; it was the manifestation of the Divine Court’s power.</p><p>With the Thirty-Two Heavens as its frame, the Twenty-Eight Constellations as its wheel, the Seven Luminaries as its box, the Sun and Moon as its yoke, the North Pole as its pivot, all integrated, firmly connected!</p><p>Of the Three Enclosures, the Purple Forbidden Enclosure, the heart of heaven, the abode of the Emperor, was particularly resplendent.  The starlight converged on the Purple Forbidden Enclosure, with the stars of the Big Dipper particularly brilliant.</p><p>The Big Dipper is known as the Emperor’s Chariot.</p><p>As the stars shifted, the handle of the Big Dipper pointed directly at the Xuan Tan Altar.</p><p>In the next instant, starlight descended, transforming into an imperial chariot.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The chariot traversed the Milky Way, descending from the ninth heaven.</p><p>Upon the altar, light shone brilliantly.  Zhang Zhenjun, bathed in starlight, transformed into the Gou Chen Emperor.  The imperial crown was placed upon his head, the starlight enveloped his robes.  He ascended in the imperial chariot, soaring into the heavens!</p><p>Passing the gate of the Divine Court…</p><p>The chariot halted.</p><p>Tian Yue Shang Ren and the five-clawed golden dragon, locked in battle, ceased fighting, their gazes fixed on the chariot, expressions varied.  The five-clawed golden dragon had never set foot within the Divine Court.</p><p>Zhang Zhenjun paid respects to Tian Yue Shang Ren, then turned his gaze to the five-clawed dragon, and commanded, “Evil beast, submit!”</p><p>The five-clawed golden dragon, its spirit broken, showed no will to resist. Its body lay prostrate, its ferocity gone.</p><p>“Please forgive this dragon, Celestial Master!”</p><p>(End)</p>
