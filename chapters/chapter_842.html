<h1>Chapter 834: The Forbidden Yuan Talisman</h1><p>The small pagoda crashed down, instantly increasing the pressure on Qin Sang.  </p><p>The Nine Netherworld Demon Fire flickered erratically, unable to get close and instead suppressed by the red glow emanating from the pagoda. Qin Sang, using his exceptional swordsmanship, blocked Xiang Yi, his true energy draining away like water.</p><p>Xiang Yi's cultivation far surpassed Qin Sang's.  Overpowering Qin Sang's skill, Xiang Yi slowly began to gain the upper hand.</p><p>Although Qin Sang had the two-headed… beast, Xiang Yi's protective garment was comparable to Qin Sang's Golden Light Armor.  With the aid of these two extraordinary treasures, if Xiang Yi truly wished to escape, it would be extremely difficult to restrain him.</p><p>The failure of the Blood-Soiled Divine Light meant Qin Sang's ambush had failed.</p><p>During this time, he had to use all his strength to hold Xiang Yi until Madam Liu activated the Forbidden Yuan Talisman.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>Xiang Yi suddenly threw out a talisman.</p><p>The talisman shattered, releasing a burst of colorful light.</p><p>Qin Sang was wary, but when the talisman exploded, a strange light filled the area, and the vast ocean vanished, replaced by a dense forest.</p><p>The forest was verdant, a light mist hung in the air, and the scent of plants and trees filled the senses.</p><p>Xiang Yi had also disappeared.</p><p>“Illusion Talisman?”</p><p>Qin Sang’s mind raced. He activated his Heaven-Eyed Butterfly, his vision piercing the illusion, only to discover a dozen Xiang Yis emerging from the illusion, attempting to break out in different directions.</p><p>The talisman was powerful, and Xiang Yi's method of creating clones was remarkably lifelike.</p><p>While this clone breakout tactic might deceive others, it was completely transparent under the Heaven-Eyed Butterfly’s gaze. Qin Sang easily identified the real Xiang Yi.</p><p>He didn't act rashly, instead secretly contacting the two-headed… beast through his spiritual sense.</p><p>The two-headed… beast hesitated slightly at first, letting out a low growl of reluctance, but it dared not disobey. Its form flickered, leaving behind an illusory image to mislead Xiang Yi, while its real body secretly circled around to intercept Xiang Yi’s escape route.</p><p>Simultaneously, Qin Sang concealed his ebony sword, and as he closed in on Xiang Yi, unleashed a dazzling array of sword light, like a blooming lotus of swords, radiating sharp energy.</p><p>Xiang Yi realized he had been exposed. He knew this tactic wouldn't remain hidden indefinitely, but he hadn’t expected it to be seen through so quickly;  it was virtually a waste of effort, and he hadn't escaped his opponent's grasp.</p><p>He acted decisively, immediately abandoning the other clones and urgently summoning his life-saving treasure.</p><p>‘Bang!’</p><p>The sword lotus and the small pagoda collided, a dazzling explosion of light, chaotic true energy nearly tearing the illusion apart.</p><p>Although caught off guard, Xiang Yi, relying on his profound cultivation, successfully repelled the ebony sword.</p><p>Before he could breathe a sigh of relief, however, Xiang Yi felt a sudden, inexplicable danger, a prickling sensation at his back, his heart pounding with alarm.</p><p>Then, a dark shadow appeared behind him.</p><p>The two-headed… beast hadn't changed much, only a faint green aura swirling around its fur. It was this aura that caused Xiang Yi to feel threatened.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The two-headed… beast shot towards Xiang Yi, moving even faster than before.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>Xiang Yi’s face changed dramatically. Desperate, he poured true energy into his protective garment.</p><p>In an instant, strange light blazed, a ghostly garment appearing on Xiang Yi’s body.</p><p>It looked like an extremely thin piece of clothing, yet the fluctuations it emitted were extraordinarily unusual.</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>The two-headed… beast roared, a cry of pain accompanying the cracking of its bones.  Then, the green aura coalesced into a green shadow, abruptly detaching and violently striking Xiang Yi.</p><p>After the green shadow separated, the two-headed… beast was panting heavily, seemingly exhausted.</p><p>Unlike the previous clones, the green shadow was a wind-controlling divine ability the two-headed… beast had developed during its cultivation, activating its bloodline power, concentrating all its energy into the green shadow to tear apart the enemy—a powerful killing move.</p><p>The cost was high, however. Its breakthrough was unsuccessful, making the execution of this technique difficult, putting great strain on its flesh, bones, and causing intense pain, significantly reducing its combat effectiveness after use.</p><p>This was the reason for its earlier reluctance.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The green shadow and Xiang Yi’s protective garment collided with a thunderous crash, a blinding light erupting.</p><p>Then, a ripping sound was heard, and both the green aura and the garment's strange light dimmed as if cancelling each other out.</p><p>The green shadow was revealed, its claws and fangs piercing through the protective garment, tearing a hole in it.</p><p>Xiang Yi reacted swiftly, sensing danger. He activated his protective treasure garment, which, though severely depleting his energy, saved him.  He looked disheveled, bleeding, but his injuries were not serious.</p><p>He hastily used a small tower to shatter the green shadow, then examined the garment, finding it damaged, its luster dimmed, its power significantly reduced.</p><p>“So this is the strength of your ambush?”</p><p>Xiang Yi roared, his eyes blazing with murderous intent, wishing to tear Qin Sang to shreds.</p><p>This was incredibly dangerous. He’d been ambushed by the double-headed creature, and a chilling fear still lingered.  If he hadn't been prepared, and his main treasure hadn't held, the creature's claws might have pierced him, not just the garment.</p><p>Qin Sang remained silent, recalling the double-headed creature to recover, then continued attacking with his sword. The double-headed creature’s attack had severely depleted Xiang Yi’s energy and destroyed his protective treasure.</p><p>Xiang Yi’s eyes were cold. He judged Qin Sang to be at the end of his resources.  Their battle had lasted a long time, and no reinforcements had appeared; he'd likely overestimated the threat.  Someone with Qin Sang's strength wouldn't need help. Most people facing such a terrifying ambush would be in grave danger.</p><p>However, experience cautioned Xiang Yi against complacency. He followed his earlier strategy: escape first, then seek revenge.</p><p>Suddenly, flecks of light shimmered on the sea surface.  A white talismanic shadow shot up from the water, silently striking Xiang Yi.</p><p>Qin Sang breathed a sigh of relief. Madam Liu had finally prepared the binding talisman. Otherwise, he would have had to use the Star Conch. Using the Star Conch would likely critically wound Xiang Yi, but it would also expend his most powerful resource.  An accident could leave him defenseless.  In the treacherous妖海 (Yao Sea), he preferred to keep a trump card to handle any emergency.</p><p>As the binding talisman shot out, Madam Liu appeared on the sea’s surface.  She looked at Xiang Yi, her husband's killer, with bitter, vengeful eyes.</p><p>“It’s you! You’re still alive!”</p><p>Xiang Yi was stunned, instantly understanding everything.</p><p>The binding talisman shattered with a ‘pop,’ releasing golden, interwoven threads that swiftly spread, wrapping around Xiang Yi.  Each thread clung like a parasite. He desperately tried to sever them with his treasure, but failed.</p><p>The golden threads entered his body.  Horrified, he found his energy stagnating.</p>
