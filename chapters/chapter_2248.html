<h1>Chapter 2238: Exploring the Stars Again</h1><p>Chapter 2239: Exploring the Stars Again</p><p>I can cultivate the Celestial Demon Transformation by visualizing the Azure Luan image, thanks to the jade Buddha blocking the stellar煞.  But many human cultivators must have tried visualization techniques similar to those of the demon race. I don't believe that among so many powerful human cultivators, none could find a treasure that shields the stellar煞 like the jade Buddha.</p><p>Perhaps this path is simply unsuitable for humans.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered this, recalling legends about the origins of humanity.</p><p>He flipped through countless jade slips, trying to find clues about the identity of the person who called out to him, but to no avail.</p><p>“We’ve reached Hun Valley. Everyone split into three teams, patrol the area, then each team occupies a position and stays for three months.  Use your shadow stones to record all the changes in the valley…”</p><p>Deng Kui gave the assignments.  Everyone divided into three groups. Qin Sang followed Deng Kui, patrolled the area, chose a location, and set up his shadow stone.</p><p>This task didn't interfere with his cultivation. Qin Sang focused on the Water-Fire Harmony technique. Three months passed quickly. After bidding farewell to Deng Kui and the others, Qin Sang returned to the mountain gate and continued his cultivation.</p><p>As their understanding of the Water-Fire Harmony technique deepened, their progress accelerated.</p><p>When Venerable Tongshen returned to the mountain gate, he would summon Qin Sang to question and test his understanding of the Water-Fire Harmony technique, sometimes requiring the power of the stone womb fire.</p><p>The atmosphere in Yongtu Immortal City grew tenser by the day.  From the city gates, one could see countless airships coming and going; the cultivators were all in a hurry.</p><p>The shadow of war loomed over the immortal city and the hearts of its people, but the expected massive invasion had yet to materialize.</p><p>Perhaps the powerful figures from both sides were preparing for the upcoming war, but little Yuanjing Mountain, and Qin Sang, who was only at the Golden Core stage, was far removed from that level.</p><p>Apart from occasional missions for the immortal city, their lives were largely unaffected.</p><p>After some time, Deng Kui finally secured a position for Qin Sang—assisting a senior cultivator aboard an airship.</p><p>The immortal guards on this airship, like Venerable Tongshen, were responsible for transporting scattered human and divine descendants.</p><p>“Three years…”</p><p>Qin Sang contacted Deng Kui and learned that the airship would depart soon. Because of the distance, the round trip would take at least three years.</p><p>Three years wasn't a long time for a cultivator, and he could still cultivate on the airship. However, he wouldn't be able to contact his sect, making it difficult to conceal his past.  Qin Sang needed a plausible excuse; otherwise, Venerable Tongshen wouldn't agree.</p><p>Returning to the mountain gate, Qin Sang was devising an excuse when a message talisman flew towards him.</p><p>Qin Sang immediately flew towards the headmaster's hall. Seeing his master, senior brothers, and senior sister, he quickly bowed. “Master, you’re back!”</p><p>Venerable Tongshen nodded, gesturing for Qin Sang to sit beside his senior brother Qingyan, then looked at the four of them.</p><p>“I have an announcement! I will be entering seclusion to cultivate, but this time, I don't know when I'll emerge.”</p><p>The four immediately understood, their faces filled with joy.</p><p>“Master, are you about to break through?”</p><p>Venerable Tongshen smiled. “It's too early to talk about breakthroughs. However, I haven't slacked off even when I went out, and because of cultivating the Water-Fire Harmony technique, I’ve had some new insights. If I’m lucky, I may be able to break through a realm.”</p><p>“Master will surely succeed!” Qinghong exclaimed excitedly.</p><p>Qingyan, ever the most composed, said, “Master, rest assured during your seclusion. I will take over your duties in the immortal city.”</p><p>He knew this was the most crucial task.  The connection between Yuanjing Mountain and the immortal city could not be severed; only by diligently serving the city could they receive its protection in the future.</p><p>Venerable Tongshen hummed in agreement. “With you, I'm at ease.  Furthermore, Qinghong will take care of the sect's mundane affairs.  Frostfall, Qingfeng, while I’m away, you must listen to your senior brother and senior sister; don't cause trouble.”</p><p>With the last sentence, Venerable Tongshen looked directly at Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang protested, “Master, I’ve never disobeyed your orders!  Actually, I have something to ask for your decision.”</p><p>Venerable Tongshen remained noncommittal. “Speak.”</p><p>“I just received a message from Daoist Friend Deng. The immortal city has issued a mission requiring me to go to a place for three years. During that time, I cannot leave or contact the outside world…” Qin Sang fabricated.</p><p>“What place?” Venerable Tongshen frowned.</p><p>“I can only find out after accepting the mission.  It might involve guarding something. Though the requirements are strict, the reward is very generous, and I'm not sure what to do,” Qin Sang hesitated.</p><p>“Your senior sister still needs your stone womb fire to help them cultivate,” Venerable Tongshen’s expression showed disapproval.</p><p>Qinghong and Frostfall exchanged glances. “Junior brother has already helped us a lot. Because our progress has been too rapid, we've encountered some problems, and we need time to digest them.</p><p>"If the junior disciple wishes to go, there's no need to worry about us. However, the junior disciple must thoroughly investigate and confirm there is no danger."</p><p>With that, Master Tongshen said no more. After giving further instructions to his disciples, he entered his meditation chamber and activated the protective array.</p><p>With Master Tongshen in seclusion, Qin Sang's actions became much easier.</p><p>Two months later, after making careful arrangements, Qin Sang arrived at a mountain peak a hundred miles from the Immortal City.</p><p>Yellow clouds gathered above the peak.  A massive outline was faintly visible within the clouds—a large vessel.</p><p>Qin Sang landed halfway up the mountain.  After a quick scan, he saw an unkempt old man leaning against a rock, a wine gourd in his hand, his entire being radiating the scent of alcohol, his eyes drowsy.</p><p>"Excuse me, are you Senior Zeng Lan?"</p><p>Qin Sang approached and politely inquired.</p><p>Zeng Lan was the person Qin Sang was to follow on this journey, or more accurately, a descendant of a deity.</p><p>He seemed to have just woken up, his eyes barely opening a crack. He belched, "You... uh... who are you?"</p><p>"My Dharma name is Mingyue. I've been dispatched to serve under your guidance, Senior."</p><p>"Oh, it's you, kid," Zeng Lan took a swig of wine, stood up, and wobbled towards the top of the mountain.</p><p>Qin Sang, having seen all sorts of strange people, remained calm and followed Zeng Lan onto the vessel.</p><p>Upon entering, Qin Sang paid close attention to the vessel's layout and the protective enchantments, speculating on the methods of its creation.</p><p>Large magical vessels like this were different from magical artifacts and spiritual treasures—areas Qin Sang hadn't delved deeply into.  However, he had read some texts, and even with his limited knowledge, he could tell that this vessel was far less refined and efficient than later models, with several areas for improvement.</p><p>"You stay here!"</p><p>Zeng Lan led Qin Sang inside the vessel, pointed to a cabin, then to one next to it, his eyes bleary.  "I'll stay here! On the journey, you're in charge. Don't disturb me, understand?"</p><p>"Understood, Senior. I will not allow anyone to disturb you!"</p><p>Qin Sang had a pretty good grasp of Zeng Lan's personality and was quite satisfied.</p><p>"Smart!"</p><p>Zeng Lan was also pleased with Qin Sang, patted him on the shoulder, entered his cabin, and slammed the door shut.</p><p>Zeng Lan acted like a hands-off manager, leaving everything to Qin Sang.  Only after the vessel set off did things calm down.</p><p>Each cabin was like a private meditation chamber.</p><p>The vessel flew steadily. Qin Sang stood by the window, gazing at the scenery outside.</p><p>After a while, he returned to the center of his cabin, sat cross-legged, took out a blood-red pill, and swallowed it.</p><p>These were煞妖丹 , made from the corpse of a golden eagle. His supply was almost depleted. This trip had better yield more demonic beasts.</p><p>With that thought, Qin Sang entered meditation.</p><p>The vessel traveled almost constantly for the following time. Qin Sang was occasionally awakened to attend to matters on Zeng Lan's behalf.</p><p>Participating in high-level discussions gave Qin Sang a more direct and clear understanding of the mission and the current situation.</p><p>The closest major clan to Yongtu Immortal City was the Phoenix Clan.  Yongtu Immortal City's defenses were primarily aimed at the Phoenix Clan and its allies.</p><p>In any war, the Phoenix Clan would undoubtedly lead the attack on Yongtu Immortal City.</p><p>Between the Phoenix Clan and Yongtu Immortal City lay a vast territory inhabited not only by humans and descendants of deities but also many demonic beasts. It served as a buffer zone, with both sides tacitly avoiding encroachment.</p><p>While Yongtu Immortal City was relocating its human and deity descendants, the Phoenix Clan and other demonic beasts were similarly relocating their own kin to the rear.  This was essentially clearing the battlefield before the war.</p><p>Because the inhabitants of this area were mostly commoners, and even the cultivators were of low cultivation, they could not influence the outcome of the battle; both sides, therefore, tacitly allowed each other to remove their 'people'.</p><p>However, as time went on, the increased interaction between the two sides inevitably led to friction. Although both sides exercised restraint and avoided large-scale conflicts, underhanded skirmishes were unavoidable.</p><p>If they clashed directly, a fight was inevitable.  Sometimes they even used each other’s kin to set traps and lure their opponents into ambushes.</p><p>Qin Sang recalled Master Tongshen once returning injured, likely after encountering a demonic beast group.</p><p>They also needed to guard against demonic beasts on this journey and had made preparations accordingly.</p><p>Returning to his cabin, Qin Sang began his own preparations.</p><p>Before leaving, he had refined many poison pills and array implements, and his cultivation had greatly improved.  Given the opportunity, killing one or two large transformed demons would not be difficult.</p><p>After a year and a half on the vessel, their destination was drawing nearer.</p><p>Ding ding ding!</p><p>A series of bells rang out on the ship, startling everyone awake.  Qin Sang emerged from her cabin and waited for Zeng Lan at his door.  Seeing no movement, she activated a ward, and Zeng Lan finally opened the door, eyes blurry. "What is it?"</p><p>A cultivator of his stature, perpetually drunk, it was a mystery what cultivation technique he even practiced.</p><p>Despite this, Qin Sang remained respectful. "Senior, we've arrived."</p><p>Zeng Lan grunted, wiped his face, and slowly made his way to the meeting.</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't invited to the meeting, but she guessed their plan: a counter-trap. If there was an ambush, they would turn the tables.</p><p>They stayed put for a few days before resuming their journey, even faster than before.</p><p>Ten days later.</p><p>Standing atop a mountain, Qin Sang gazed into the distance, feeling the ground tremble beneath her feet.</p><p>The tremors originated from ahead, where multicolored lights shot towards the sky, a chaotic spectacle.</p><p>"There really is an ambush…"</p><p>Qin Sang rubbed her chin.</p><p>Zeng Lan's plan worked. They had deliberately walked into the enemy's trap, triggering a fierce battle.</p><p>Lower-level cultivators, including Qin Sang, remained on the ship.  As the battle began, Qin Sang, using Zeng Lan's name as an excuse, slipped away.</p><p>From outside the battlefield, the overall situation was unclear, but Zeng Lan and the others must have been confident to deliberately enter the trap.</p><p>"I wonder if there'll be any scraps for me," Qin Sang murmured, her aura shifting as a pair of phoenix wings unfolded.  She bypassed the battlefield and flew towards the rear.</p><p>The battle raged on, lasting well into the night, the strange lights showing no sign of dissipating.</p><p>Qin Sang watched from afar, patiently waiting. Finally, a streak of light burst from the battlefield, slicing across the night sky at incredible speed before vanishing.</p><p>Two more figures pursued it, but soon lost their target, circled briefly, and returned to the battle.</p><p>Qin Sang stared at the direction where the light disappeared, knowing it was a powerful demon, but remained cautious, continuing to wait.</p><p>Finally, after a deafening boom, the battlefield erupted in a thousand lights, scattering in all directions.</p><p>One figure hurtled towards Qin Sang.</p><p>It was a peacock, its once-beautiful plumage tattered and stained with blood, its aura ragged.</p><p>Using several magical techniques, the peacock temporarily escaped its pursuers, fleeing into the mountains.  Reaching a lake, its gaze sharpened.</p><p>"Who's there? Show yourself!"</p><p>"Friend, please calm yourself!"</p><p>A gentle voice echoed from the lake. The water parted, and Qin Sang, flapping her phoenix wings, emerged.</p><p>Despite her relatively low cultivation in the *Tian Yao Lian Xing* technique, she emanated a pure demonic aura.</p><p>"Are you a fellow cultivator of the Qingluan Clan?"</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang's wings, the peacock relaxed slightly, then noticed something amiss.</p><p>Qin Sang could shapeshift into human form, indicating at least a Transformation Stage Qingluan, yet her aura didn't match her apparent cultivation level.</p><p>And…</p><p>"You…"</p><p>The peacock only managed to utter a single word before darkness fell, as a torrent of lake water crashed down!</p><p>An incense stick later, Qin Sang stored the peacock's corpse in a storage device, glanced around cautiously, and departed.</p><p>Her first attempt had been a resounding success, yielding a substantial profit and allowing her to refine a powerful demon pill, significantly boosting her cultivation.</p><p>On subsequent outings, Qin Sang eagerly sought powerful demons, though opportunities weren't always plentiful.</p><p>Thanks to the demon pill, Qin Sang quickly surpassed her two senior sisters, eventually even outstripping her senior brother, Qing Yan.</p><p>In a secluded mountain valley.</p><p>Layers of formations and wards were already in place.</p><p>Qin Sang sat cross-legged at the valley bottom.  Soon, her aura fluctuated, rising and falling like tides.</p><p>After repeated, tenacious assaults, the bottleneck finally loosened.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>Yin fire floated, three tribulations descended.</p><p>"The illusion even mimics the Heavenly Tribulation so realistically…"</p><p>Undergoing the Nascent Soul Tribulation again, Qin Sang remained calm and collected, calmly passing the three tribulations, just as she had before, without a karmic tribulation.</p><p>Her breath gradually evened out.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't celebrate; she immediately began to recuperate.</p><p>The sun rose and set.</p><p>Night fell again. Qin Sang awoke refreshed, gazed at the stars, and began practicing the *Tian Yao Lian Xing* technique.</p>
