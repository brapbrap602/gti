<h1>Chapter 582: Betrayal</h1><p>The Shadow Leopard attacked again.</p><p>This time, under the glow of the Blood Curse, Qin Sang could vaguely see a phantom shadow lunging towards Wandering Scholar with astonishing speed.</p><p>The Shadow Leopard's ability to conceal itself was useless here.</p><p>Not only that, its speed was also slower than before, as if it was carrying a mountain on its back.</p><p>"Attack its abdomen, it's seriously injured!"</p><p>Wandering Scholar urged the Flawless Pearl with all his might and shouted.</p><p>Qin Sang understood. The Shadow Leopard must have been injured when it broke the Little Northern Dipper Star Essence Formation in the Abyss of Sin. This kind of injury was not easy to recover from, and its abdomen was its weak point.</p><p>Qin Sang flashed behind Wandering Scholar, waved his hand, and unleashed the Nine Nether Demonic Fire, ordering the Flying Night Devil to attack as well.</p><p>The Nine Nether Demonic Fire transformed into a fire dragon, shooting out and blocking the Shadow Leopard's path.</p><p>Sensing the aura of the Nine Nether Demonic Fire, the Shadow Leopard's gaze narrowed slightly. It felt that this strange flame was extraordinary and seemed to be a threat to it.</p><p>What an unlucky day!</p><p>Two cultivators who hadn't even reached the Golden Core stage not only possessed magical treasures that threatened him but could also manipulate the Blood Curse.</p><p>The Shadow Leopard regretted it. If it had known this, it should have quietly eliminated these two while hiding in the shadows.</p><p>'Whoosh... whoosh...'</p><p>Though filled with regret, the Shadow Leopard's movements were unaffected.</p><p>With a roar, a myriad of claw shadows appeared, carrying a terrifying momentum that seemed capable of tearing apart everything. Unexpectedly, after the claw shadows collided with the Nine Nether Demonic Fire, the anticipated one-sided situation did not occur.</p><p>The Nine Nether Demonic Fire was torn apart by the Shadow Leopard, but after scattering, it quickly coalesced again, unexpectedly not being completely destroyed.</p><p>At the same time, the Flying Night Devil sprang out from the flames without warning, choosing a very tricky angle, and suddenly punched towards the Shadow Leopard's abdomen.</p><p>The Shadow Leopard roared repeatedly, its body twisting abruptly, not daring to directly take the Flying Night Devil's punch.</p><p>There really was an injury there!</p><p>After dodging the sneak attack, the Shadow Leopard repelled the Flying Night Devil.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The Flying Night Devil flew back, with several claw marks on its body, which looked severe but didn't damage its essence.</p><p>The two, working together, managed to hold back the Shadow Leopard!</p><p>Seeing this scene, Qin Sang was also very surprised. The Ten Yama Banners were only a low-grade magical treasure, and the Nine Nether Demonic Fire and the Flying Night Devil could never be a match for the Shadow Leopard.</p><p>There was only one possibility for this situation: the Shadow Leopard was restricted by the Blood Curse and its strength was greatly reduced!</p><p>He couldn't help but glance at Wandering Scholar, only to see that Wandering Scholar's movements were getting faster and faster, and he could no longer see how many hand seals he had formed, while the light on the four walls of the stone hall grew brighter and brighter, pressing down on the Shadow Leopard layer by layer.</p><p>Qin Sang recalled Wandering Scholar's previous message, hurriedly urging the Nine Nether Demonic Fire and the Flying Night Devil to continue the battle, focusing on the Shadow Leopard's injured area, secretly activating the Ebony Sword, and concentrating on the Shadow Leopard.</p><p>At this moment, a surprising scene occurred.</p><p>The Shadow Leopard repeatedly tore apart the Nine Nether Demonic Fire and repelled the Flying Night Devil, but it was still unable to approach Wandering Scholar. Its attempts to rush towards the Crimson Cloud Purple Fruit were also thwarted, and the pressure on it grew heavier and heavier.</p><p>Then, it glanced coldly at Wandering Scholar, and decisively turned around, fleeing.</p><p>Qin Sang's thoughts raced, and he guessed its intention.</p><p>The Blood Curse only existed within the stone hall. As long as they left the range of the Blood Curse, they couldn't borrow its power, losing their greatest advantage and becoming easy prey.</p><p>The Shadow Leopard was very aware of the power of the Blood Curse. It was left by a Transformation Stage Great Demon and was extremely terrifying. If Wandering Scholar activated the full power of the Blood Curse, it could easily kill it.</p><p>It didn't know the depth of Wandering Scholar's power and didn't want to take any more risks. As long as it blocked the waterfall entrance and waited, Qin Sang and Wandering Scholar would have nowhere to escape.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't expect the Shadow Leopard to be so decisive, abandoning the Crimson Cloud Purple Fruit when the situation turned unfavorable.</p><p>Absolutely couldn't let it leave!</p><p>Unexpectedly, the Shadow Leopard was extremely decisive and fast, and there was no time to stop it.</p><p>"Brother Qin!"</p><p>Wandering Scholar suddenly roared.</p><p>Qin Sang had kept Wandering Scholar's instructions in mind. Upon hearing this, he almost didn't have time to think, subconsciously summoning the Ebony Sword and instantly transforming into a sword light, shooting out.</p><p>The sound of thunder echoed in the stone hall, deafening.</p><p>The flying sword was like a startling rainbow, moving forward relentlessly.</p><p>Wandering Scholar didn't let Qin Sang down. He stretched out his hand and pointed at the Flawless Pearl.</p><p>At this moment, the stone hall suddenly darkened.</p><p>Wandering Scholar had instantly unleashed all the power of the Blood Curse he could control, focusing all the light on the Shadow Leopard, causing the pressure on it to surge.</p><p>Immediately, the Flawless Pearl trembled and shot out a strange arrow of light, which caught up with the Shadow Leopard faster than Qin Sang's flying sword and directly enveloped it.</p><p>The moment it was enveloped by the light arrow, the Shadow Leopard suddenly froze in a bizarre posture, fixed in place.</p><p>What Wandering Scholar said before wasn't a lie. The Flawless Pearl could actually restrain demon cultivators, even one as strong as the Core Formation mid-stage Shadow Leopard.</p><p>A lightning-fast sword light followed closely behind.</p><p>After the Shadow Leopard was trapped by the Flawless Pearl, a gray pearl the size of a dragon's eye flew out from the sword light.</p><p>The gray pearl was grayish-white, with a silvery-white light flashing across its surface from time to time. It rushed out of the sword light and floated towards the Shadow Leopard, seemingly slow but actually fast.</p><p>The small gray pearl rotated gently, giving the illusion of slow movement, but the silver light on its surface became increasingly dense.</p><p>The seemingly small gray pearl revealed an extremely violent power at this moment, and this power grew stronger and stronger, making one's whole body tremble.</p><p>In the distance, Wandering Scholar narrowed his eyes.</p><p>The Ebony Sword came to a sudden stop and then retreated rapidly.</p><p>As the user, Qin Sang was also very afraid of the Void Thunder, fearing that he would be affected.</p><p>"Roar!"</p><p>The Shadow Leopard finally broke free from the Flawless Pearl's restraints, but immediately faced the terrifying Void Thunder, letting out a furious roar.</p><p>Silver light erupted, incredibly brilliant.</p><p>It was as if a small sun had appeared in the stone hall.</p><p>However, the range of the silver light was very small, only covering an area of less than ten feet.</p><p>From the eruption to the dissipation of the silver light, it was only an instant, and there was no sound during the entire process. Then the silver light disappeared.</p><p>Apart from a semi-circular crater on the ground and the surrounding stones that had been crushed into powder by the residual force, there were no other traces left, as if it had never existed.</p><p>The Shadow Leopard also disappeared, seemingly swallowed by the silver light.</p><p>The next moment, a sudden change occurred.</p><p>Space distorted, revealing the figure of the black leopard.</p><p>It looked extremely miserable. Its entire left foreleg, starting from its neck, was completely gone, its bloody innards exposed, and its aura was extremely weak.</p><p>But it was still alive. Its figure suddenly sprang up, fleeing, leaving a trail of blood!</p><p>Qin Sang watched the Shadow Leopard's figure coldly. He had been prepared.</p><p>The reason why he hadn't unsealed the Corpse Pearl was, firstly, Wandering Scholar's plan didn't require him to personally take action, and secondly, he was waiting for such an opportunity to catch it off guard.</p><p>Qin Sang focused his mind, enveloping the Corpse Pearl.</p><p>Just as he was about to unseal the Corpse Pearl, a sudden warning arose in his heart.</p><p>Then, from the corner of his eye, he caught sight of a dark figure pouncing towards him.</p><p>It was the Flying Night Devil!</p>
