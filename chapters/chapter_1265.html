<h1>Chapter 1257: Deathly Silence</h1><p>Jing Yu let out a bitter laugh. "Fellow Daoist, there's no need to shield me from embarrassment. Back then, I was carelessly lured into the Blood Lake, where I encountered a formidable enemy. I narrowly escaped death, and today, thanks to Fellow Daoist Ming Yue's rescue, I managed to break free..."</p><p>Qin Sang, observing the chaotic battle ahead, asked, "Were you attacked by flesh puppets?"</p><p>The Nether Demon Lord sighed helplessly. "No, we were the ones hunting them, trying to capture one. We had exhausted all means to search for traces of the Old Demon Ye but found nothing, wandering aimlessly like headless flies. We then turned our attention to the grand formation, hoping to locate its core. Although the Black Tower Formation is severely damaged, it remains vast and intricate. With our abilities, it would take considerable time to decipher its patterns. The flesh puppets are likely born from the Black Tower Formation, intricately connected to it, so we thought to start with them."</p><p>Qing Jun added, "Earlier, the Black Tower Formation trembled, likely because Old Demon Ye breached a certain restriction. He set up a diversion to keep us occupied outside the Blood Gate, preventing us from following his trail. Now, they've gone completely silent. If we don't crack the Black Tower Formation soon, it will be impossible to stop them."</p><p>As she spoke, Qing Jun glanced at Jing Yu.</p><p>The Nether Demon Lord also looked at her with anticipation.</p><p>Understanding their intent, Jing Yu said, "First, let's have everyone stop their attacks. While it's true that the flesh puppets are born from the Black Tower Formation, they lack intelligence and can't even be considered living beings. Capturing them won't yield any useful information. I know the location of the formation's core. That's where I encountered danger back then. The Abyss of Sin has gone to great lengths to open the Blood Lake, and it's almost certain they're heading there."</p><p>Jing Yu then briefly recounted her past ordeal, omitting the existence of the Corpse Flower Blood Amber.</p><p>After freeing themselves from the flesh puppets and hearing Jing Yu's story, everyone was astounded.</p><p>"No wonder the Abyss of Sin has mobilized so extensively, even neglecting the battlefield! This place seals an ancient cultivator who has managed to survive to this day?"</p><p>"The ancient cultivator's identity is unknown, but trying to capture Fellow Daoist Jing Yu as blood sustenance is definitely not the act of a benevolent being! Does Old Demon Ye know what consequences releasing him would bring?"</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Ming Yue's speculation makes sense. Old Demon Ye might know that the ancient cultivator is at the end of his strength and, driven by ambition, seeks to imprison him and extract ancient secrets!"</p><p>...</p><p>The group buzzed with discussion, their interest instantly piqued by Jing Yu's words.</p><p>They were all Nascent Soul cultivators, the most elite figures of their time, yet they faced the grim reality of their paths being cut off.</p><p>No treasure could compare to the importance of their cultivation paths.</p><p>Although none among them might break through to the late Nascent Soul stage, who could resist the temptation of glimpsing ancient secrets from the mouth of an ancient cultivator?</p><p>Moreover, if the Abyss of Sin succeeded in coercing ancient techniques from the cultivator, their power would greatly increase. Given Old Demon Ye's ambitious nature, the two realms would never know peace again.</p><p>Seizing the ancient cultivator would benefit everyone.</p><p>Upon learning the truth, the group hesitated no longer and immediately decided to follow Jing Yu to the formation's core, ready to either seize the ancient cultivator or prevent Old Demon Ye from breaking the seal.</p><p>Jing Yu led the way, with the others following closely.</p><p>The formation was indeed extraordinarily complex. Without Jing Yu's guidance, by the time they found the core, Old Demon Ye would have long since taken the ancient cultivator away.</p><p>As they flew deeper into the formation, countless lethal mechanisms shifted and changed, dazzling their senses. The shadows of black towers began to appear more densely, indicating their proximity to the formation's core.</p><p>After flying for a while longer and bypassing numerous black towers, Jing Yu suddenly halted.</p><p>The group stopped as well, seeing two black towers standing side by side ahead.</p><p>These two towers were almost identical to the others, except that behind them stood another pair of black towers. The four towers formed a square, enclosing a central space.</p><p>Within this space, there were none of the lethal mechanisms they had encountered earlier. Instead, a thick blood mist swirled around a peculiar black tower, unable to escape the confines of the four surrounding towers.</p><p>This black tower was far larger and taller than any they had seen before.</p><p>The group's gazes shifted to the tower, but no figures were visible. They couldn't help but ask, "Is the ancient cultivator sealed within this black tower?"</p><p>Jing Yu sneered and shook her head. "Haven't you all realized yet? This tower is merely an illusion conjured by the formation, a diversion. However, it's true that the ancient cultivator is sealed between the four black towers. The illusions created by the Black Tower Formation are incredibly lifelike, as if they were real. We must first dispel the illusion to find the entrance."</p><p>The group was astonished. None of them had detected the illusion, and they could only marvel at the formation's profound mysteries.</p><p>Only Qin Sang had noticed something amiss earlier.</p><p>However, he hadn't expected the entire black tower to be an illusion. Upon Jing Yu's reminder, he quickly focused his gaze.</p><p>The Nether Demon Lord frowned. "If we forcefully dispel the illusion, won't we reveal our presence prematurely? Do you have a better plan, Fellow Daoist?"</p><p>Jing Yu shook her head. "I only know how to break it by brute force."</p><p>The group exchanged uneasy glances. They had hoped to approach stealthily and strike when the enemy was unprepared, but now that seemed impossible. Time didn't permit them to slowly search for a way to dismantle the formation.</p><p>Qin Sang observed for a while but couldn't think of a better solution.</p><p>After some discussion, the group decided to act!</p><p>Jing Yu, the Nether Demon Lord, and Chongyi Daoist along with his two disciples stepped forward, as they all possessed methods to dispel illusions.</p><p>The Nether Demon Lord took out a black gourd, flicked his finger, and the gourd soared into the air, releasing clusters of dark thunder, each the size of a human head.</p><p>These dark thunderbolts floated around the Nether Demon Lord, held in reserve.</p><p>Chongyi Daoist and his two disciples sat cross-legged on the ground. Each took out a green pill and swallowed it. Then, Chongyi Daoist summoned a fresh, emerald-green spirit herb.</p><p>This herb looked as if it had just been plucked, its leaves straight and sharp like thin swords, spinning in front of Chongyi Daoist.</p><p>The leaves were multicolored, clearly not naturally grown but a type of treasure.</p><p>Chongyi Daoist grasped the treasure, swung his arm, and unleashed streams of radiant light imbued with the power of the five elements. His two disciples, however, remained motionless.</p><p>Qin Sang sensed that the fluctuations of the radiant light grew stronger with each wave, surpassing Chongyi Daoist's individual capabilities. The master and disciples were jointly activating the treasure, yet he couldn't discern how they were doing it.</p><p>"Is it because of those pills?" Qin Sang whispered to his senior sister.</p><p>He then learned that the Taiyi Pill Sect's true inheritance consisted of only one cultivation method, but different practitioners had varying insights and manifestations.</p><p>Through those pills, they could temporarily alter the nature of their cultivation, aligning their minds and true essence. This not only allowed them to unleash greater power but also accomplish feats beyond their individual capabilities, such as activating treasures beyond their usual capacity.</p><p>Qin Sang marveled at this revelation.</p><p>At that moment, Jing Yu revealed her true form as a demon. Opening her mouth, a flash of silver-white lightning shot into the blood mist, heading straight for the illusory black tower.</p><p>The Nether Demon Lord combined all the dark thunderbolts and launched them.</p><p>Chongyi Daoist swung his arm repeatedly, sending forth streams of radiant light like flowing water, vast and mighty, following closely behind.</p>
