<h1>## Chapter 1399: Myriad Spirit Fruit</h1><p>"What legend?"</p><p>Qin Sang pressed for details.</p><p>Valley Master Mu chuckled, "Legend has it that spirit insects like the Fire Jade Centipede, naturally gifted with treasure-hunting abilities, are exceptionally sensitive to their target treasure. Even if the treasure is sealed by spirit arrays or restrictions, it cannot block their perception. Daoist friend and the Fire Jade Centipede are together day and night, so you should have experienced this, right? I wonder if the legend is exaggerated."</p><p>Qin Sang recalled past experiences.</p><p>The first time the Fire Jade Centipede displayed its ability was when it found Scarlet Gold Vine and Scarlet Flame Flowing Gold in the Ancient Cultivator's Relic Ground.</p><p>The Scarlet Gold Vine was hidden by the ancient cultivator using restrictions, but it was easily seen through by the Fire Jade Centipede, and at that time, the Fire Jade Centipede was only at the First Transformation!</p><p>The next time was in the Void Spirit Sect, when it sensed the Fire Jade in the forbidden area.</p><p>This kind of performance does somewhat match the description in the legend.</p><p>However, it is certainly impossible to be as exaggerated as the legend says. The ability to sense treasures is limited, and it will only become more sensitive as the Fire Jade Centipede's realm improves.</p><p>It's a pity that the Fire Jade Centipede is only interested in special treasures of the Fire element; otherwise, I could take it everywhere to hunt for treasures.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang nod, Valley Master Mu's face lit up with joy, and he then explained the reason, "Has Daoist Priest heard of the Ethereal Sea... There have always been many theories about the unique atmosphere of the Ethereal Sea. Some experts, with nothing better to do, have tried to explore it, but ultimately, they all returned without success. Some time ago, Daoist Qi accidentally discovered some unusual signs, suspecting it was an ancient site, so he invited me to come..."</p><p>Accidentally discovered.</p><p>He can even utter such nonsense!</p><p>Qin Sang cursed inwardly but did not expose Valley Master Mu to his face.</p><p>If he guessed correctly, that ancient site is very likely related to the Witch Clan!</p><p>"I almost forgot to introduce you to Daoist Priest! Daoist Qi's ancestors were close friends with our founder, and their descendants have always had contact with each other. There is also another Daoist Wang, who was also invited by Daoist Qi. They originally wanted to personally welcome Daoist Priest, but I persuaded them to stay in the Ethereal Sea and continue observing," Valley Master Mu said, changing his tone.</p><p>Qin Sang asked back, "Sounds like your exploration of the ancient site is not going smoothly?"</p><p>Valley Master Mu smiled bitterly, "Far from smooth! The three of us have been trapped in this place for a year and have yet to catch a glimpse of the entrance! We've been wandering around outside!"</p><p>"You haven't even been inside?" Qin Sang was greatly surprised.</p><p>He originally suspected that the Hundred Flower Valley founder had obtained the Witch Clan's inheritance there, but Valley Master Mu has not even been able to enter the gate.</p><p>Could it be that he guessed wrong?</p><p>Valley Master Mu nodded, ashamed, "Around the ancient site, there is an array that we have never seen before. It is extremely profound. We can't even tell what kind of array it is, whether it is the work of cultivators or naturally formed by Heaven and Earth!"</p><p>Qin Sang was secretly surprised and suspicious.</p><p>Three Core Formation  cultivators have been planning for a year, yet they don't even know what kind of array it is.</p><p>Then, after Qin Sang listened to Valley Master Mu's description of the spirit array, he asked back, "Could it be a kind of illusion array?"</p><p>Valley Master Mu recalled, "Perhaps, we have also speculated on this. However, it doesn't seem to have the effect of confusing the spirit; the three of us have never felt that our Nascent Souls have been affected. It is precisely because everything is normal that it is even more strange!"</p><p>Qin Sang secretly pondered; whether or not it can affect the Nascent Soul, he will know after he tries it himself.</p><p>"Daoist friend wants to use the Fire Jade Centipede's supernatural power to break the array?" Qin Sang couldn't think of how to do it.</p><p>If it's just a simple illusion array, the Skyeye Butterfly would be more effective.</p><p>Valley Master Mu nodded, "That is indeed the intention! We have not been idle during this time. After racking our brains, we barely came up with a way to find another path..."</p><p>After a pause, Valley Master Mu's next words finally got to the point, "Although we have not yet entered, after much investigation and verification, I also found some clues from the founder's relics. The ancient site in the illusion array is very likely a sect that existed in the Ethereal Sea in the past -- the Pure Sea Sect! The Pure Sea Sect is a rare Buddhist sect, hidden from the world, extremely mysterious, and little known. The Pure Sea Sect has a Myriad Spirit Fruit Tree, which has a great attraction to spirit insects. Moreover, the Myriad Spirit Fruit can also be used to refine a treasure called Spirit Quelling Incense, which, when lit before breakthroughs and tribulations, has the effect of suppressing inner demons and stabilizing the Nascent Soul!"</p><p>"Suppress inner demons?"</p><p>Qin Sang exclaimed, a ripple appearing in his eyes.</p><p>Of course, most of it was feigned. No matter how precious the Spirit Quelling Incense is, it is not as good as the Jade Buddha and would not cause Qin Sang to lose his composure.</p><p>But Qin Sang knew the value of this kind of treasure to cultivators. Those cultivators whose Heavenly Tribulation is approaching and are on the verge of breaking through would be willing to exchange any treasure on their body for a single stick of Spirit Quelling Incense!</p><p>A smile appeared on the corner of Valley Master Mu's mouth; he had expected Qin Sang's reaction.</p><p>The Heavenly Tribulation is a life-and-death juncture that no Core Formation cultivator can ignore. Upon hearing about a divine object like Spirit Quelling Incense, no one would be unmoved.</p><p>He first threw cold water on Qin Sang, "The Myriad Spirit Fruit is only one of the materials for refining Spirit Quelling Incense; the other materials must also be rare treasures of this era. Moreover, whether the Pure Sea Sect's relics are completely preserved and whether there is a method for refining Spirit Quelling Incense are still unknown. I hope the Myriad Spirit Fruit Tree still exists, and I would be satisfied if I could get a few Myriad Spirit Fruits. The founder once left instructions that spirit insects, after consuming Myriad Spirit Fruit, will not only gain many unknown benefits but will also increase the chances of success in the Spirit Ascension Ritual!"</p><p>So that's how it is!</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at Valley Master Mu, quite tempted by the Myriad Spirit Fruit, and his thoughts turned rapidly, "Daoist friend wants to use the Fire Jade Centipede's treasure-hunting ability to sense the Myriad Spirit Fruit and thus find the entrance to the Pure Sea Sect... However, it shouldn't be that simple, right?"</p><p>Firstly, it is difficult to say whether the Fire Jade Centipede was attracted to the Scarlet Flame Flowing Gold or whether the Scarlet Gold Vine's roots were in the Flame Vein, absorbing the qi of flames, making it a Fire elemental object itself, allowing it to be sensed.</p><p>Secondly.</p><p>Even if the Myriad Spirit Fruit is attractive to the Fire Jade Centipede, if the array outside the Pure Sea Sect is as mysterious as Valley Master Mu said, the Fire Jade Centipede's realm is too low, and it may be difficult to sense the Myriad Spirit Fruit through the array.</p><p>It is better to expect the Skyeye Butterfly.</p><p>Valley Master Mu said, "I have cultivated a similar treasure-hunting insect, the Jade Carrying Bee, but it is not as good as the Fire Jade Centipede, and I was powerless after cultivating it to the Second Transformation. But according to my understanding, this kind of strange fruit is a great temptation for any spirit insect with keen senses. In addition, I have a way to temporarily improve the spirit insect's supernatural power, which can increase the Fire Jade Centipede's sensing ability to at least close to the Fourth Transformation."</p><p>"What method?" Qin Sang asked quickly, surprised.</p><p>He didn't expect such a pleasant surprise.</p><p>If it could be used on the Skyeye Butterfly, directly improving the Skyeye Divine Power to the Fifth Transformation in the future, it is unimaginable what kind of power it would have!</p><p>Below the Deity Transformation  stage, anyone would have nowhere to hide in front of Qin Sang.</p><p>Most spirit arrays and restrictions would not be able to stop Qin Sang's footsteps.</p><p>He was becoming more and more interested in Hundred Flower Valley. The origin of the Hundred Flower Valley founder must not be simple; they very likely obtained the Witch Clan's great inheritance!</p><p>"The Three Spirits King Array!"</p><p>Valley Master Mu replied in a deep voice.</p>
