<h1>Chapter 1108: Cause and Effect</h1><p>“Master Uncle, I’ve brought them.”</p><p>Tan Yi’en returned, whispering, “Disciple has just learned that the warring factions are, on one side, Sui Dynasty nobles—primarily the Qin, Wu, and Bai families—and on the other, foreign invaders. The Sui Dynasty is already showing signs of defeat…”</p><p>Tan Yi’en stole a glance at Qin Sang.</p><p>Being a Foundation Establishment cultivator, he easily apprehended the cultivators behind both sides, halting the battle.  Hearing about the Qin family of the Sui Dynasty, and learning about the blood-restricting jade pendants left by their ancestors, Tan Yi’en immediately connected this to Qin Sang’s deliberate stay in the Sui Dynasty and his visit to the mountain shrine.  There must be a reason.</p><p>During the apprehension, he subtly favored the Sui Dynasty side, carefully questioning them before reporting back.</p><p>“The Qin, Wu, and Bai families?”</p><p>Qin Sang was somewhat surprised. “Where is the Sui imperial family?”</p><p>“It’s said the Sui unrest began after the fall of the Red-haired Ancestor.  The Pure Yang Sect was in chaos, unable to oversee the mortal realm. Unrestrained cultivators entered the world, acting tyrannically.”</p><p>“Not just the Sui Dynasty, but the countries within the Pure Yang Sect’s territory all suffered.  Those cultivators were somewhat wary, fearing retribution, so they supported puppet rulers to fight amongst themselves. But they weren’t united, leading to widespread chaos and countless deaths among the mortals.”</p><p>“Then, the Qin and other families inadvertently revealed the blood-restricting jade pendants.  The scattered cultivators discovered these were left by cultivators, realizing the Qin family had an ancestor who was a cultivator.  They became hesitant and restrained themselves.”</p><p>“After that, the situation in the Pure Yang Sect stabilized.  Cultivators no longer dared to act recklessly, and the situation remained that way.  The cultivators hid behind the scenes, enjoying their tributes, leaving the governance of the Sui Dynasty to the Qin and other families. These families were closely connected, and the imperial family gradually faded, yet the country prospered.”</p><p>“In recent years, internal strife arose within the Pure Yang Sect for unknown reasons. It was probably due to the lack of a unifying figure after the Red-haired Ancestor’s death. Upon hearing this news, those scattered cultivators became restless again.  And since the Qin family ancestor hadn't been heard from for many years, this current unrest occurred…”</p><p>Tan Yi’en briefly summarized his findings.</p><p>“By chance, the Qin family has developed to such an extent?”</p><p>Qin Sang chuckled wryly.</p><p>If it were just the Qin family, he might have been suspicious.  The Wu and Bai families—they were likely descendants of Wu Chuanzong and Bai Jianglan.</p><p>With these two families, it was almost certain this Qin family was his own family from this life. Once mere farmers, they were now just a step away from ruling a nation.</p><p>While Qin Sang and Tan Yi’en spoke,</p><p>figures stood in the distance, divided into two groups, clearly distinct, representing the cultivators behind each warring faction.</p><p>Each one was adorned with jewels, richly dressed, enjoying luxury and extravagance in the mortal world.</p><p>Now, they had no heart for fighting. The Sui side was somewhat better off, but the other side was anxious and distraught, looking as if they were about to face a great calamity.</p><p>A Foundation Establishment cultivator like Tan Yi’en was more than enough to give them a scare.  Though some of these scattered cultivators had some background, perhaps connected to Foundation Establishment cultivators, those cultivators certainly wouldn't cause trouble with their peers for them.</p><p>What was even more terrifying was that the person they feared, Tan Yi’en, showed utmost respect to another individual.</p><p>The identity of this person was self-evident.</p><p>The cultivators were terrified.</p><p>“If we’d known the Sui Dynasty had a Golden Core cultivator backing them, we’d rather have died in the mountains than set foot in the Sui Dynasty!”</p><p>The same thought occurred to all the cultivators; their regret was immense.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang looked up.</p><p>Upon meeting Qin Sang's gaze, everyone involuntarily shivered, and a commotion arose.</p><p>Qin Sang walked towards them and asked, “I recall the Sui Dynasty and other countries were once overseen by Han Family Fort.  You created chaos in the mortal realm. Weren't you afraid of the Han Family Fort dealing with you?”</p><p>After a moment of silence, an elderly man from the Sui Dynasty side bravely stepped forward, bowing respectfully and replying, “With all due respect to senior, after the Abyssal Invasion, the Han Family experts were all summoned back to the Pure Yang Sect.  Those remaining have remained secluded and haven't interacted with the world for a long time.”</p><p>So that's it.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't help but remember the late Han Family head.</p><p>“Your name is Bai Hanqiu?”</p><p>Qin Sang’s gaze fell on a young woman behind the elder. “How are you related to Bai Jianglan?”</p><p>Bai Hanqiu didn’t expect this mysterious person to notice her.  Startled, she was extremely nervous, bowing respectfully, “With all due respect to senior, Bai Jianglan is my ancestor.”</p><p>Her heart was filled with turmoil.</p><p>Bai family's ancestor was merely a mortal, yet this Golden Core stage senior knows of their ancestor!</p><p>Truly, Bai Jianglan's bloodline.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, glancing at the elder and others, and continued to ask, "Unexpectedly, the Bai family has produced a descendant with spiritual roots.  Who is your master?"</p><p>Before the girl could answer, the elder hastily bowed, "Senior, Han Qiu has not taken a master.  I am a retainer of the Great Sui Dynasty, and I had an agreement with several princes: if any descendant possesses spiritual roots, I would provide cultivation methods and guide them onto the path of immortality. Over the years, only Bai Han Qiu among the Qin and other families has shown such talent."</p><p>Bai Han Qiu was momentarily stunned, noticing the elder frantically winking at her.</p><p>"Four spiritual roots…"</p><p>Qin Sang pondered for a moment, then said to Bai Han Qiu, "Since you have no master, and I have some connection to your ancestor, having received a favor from him, would you be willing to take me as your master and cultivate with me in the outside world?"</p><p>Bai Jianglan's life-saving grace should be repaid now.</p><p>Qin Sang had considered this years ago, but none of the descendants from the other families had any talent.</p><p>Only four spiritual roots; Bai Han Qiu's future accomplishments may be limited.</p><p>However, she will be a seed.</p><p>Bai Han Qiu was dumbfounded.</p><p>When she first started cultivating, the elder had cautioned her that the chances of establishing a foundation were slim, advising her not to waste too much time on cultivation and miss out on her youth.</p><p>Never had she imagined that, thanks to her ancestor's legacy, she would have the opportunity to become a disciple of a Golden Core cultivator.</p><p>This announcement filled all the cultivators present with envy.</p><p>Seeing Bai Han Qiu's stunned silence, the elder grew anxious, wishing he could take her place.</p><p>Tan Yi'en, also somewhat envious, stepped forward, presenting a short sword artifact to Bai Han Qiu, saying, "Congratulations, junior sister. I don't possess much, but this sword is a gift to welcome you. I wish you great success in your cultivation…  Now, quickly thank your master!"</p><p>Bai Han Qiu finally snapped out of it, tears streaming down her face as she knelt and prostrated herself.</p><p>"Disciple thanks Master!"</p><p>"Rise! Your senior brother is so generous, so I must also show my appreciation. This pill can help you break through. From now on, remember to diligently cultivate; you might still have a chance to establish your foundation…"</p><p>Qin Sang produced a jade bottle, throwing it to Bai Han Qiu, offering some words of encouragement, then handed a jade pendant to Tan Yi'en, transmitting a voice message, "You and Han Qiu go down the mountain and take care of worldly affairs. Place this pendant in the imperial palace. I'll go ahead and wait for you at Cui Ming Mountain."</p><p>The pendant contained a sword qi; cultivators approaching could sense the presence of a Golden Core cultivator.</p><p>It was not a magical treasure, but sufficient to deter any villain.</p><p>"Understood!"</p><p>Tan Yi'en and Bai Han Qiu left to carry out their instructions.</p><p>Ignoring the others, Qin Sang's figure flickered, disappearing into the night.</p>
