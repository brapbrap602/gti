<h1>Chapter 1888: The Swordsman Guards the Heavenly Gate</h1><p>“Roar!”</p><p>Zhong Mao Zhi, Ji Zhen Jing.</p><p>A roar, like a tiger’s, shook the immortal city.  This roar even overshadowed the collective roar of the beast tide, causing the surrounding beasts to tremble and the cultivators to be terrified.</p><p>Ruoquan Zhenren awoke, gazing north.  There, he saw billowing yellow smoke, and within it, a huge tiger charging towards the city.</p><p>The tiger was as large as a mountain, its four paws effortlessly shattering peaks and flattening valleys.  Its eyes, large as bronze bells, shot out terrifyingly fierce light, locked onto the immortal city.</p><p>All the beasts prostrated themselves!</p><p>The first great beast, it has finally arrived!</p><p>Ruoquan Zhenren’s face showed shock. He anxiously looked towards the Jingtan Altar.</p><p>With only the protective city array and those present, they had absolutely no chance of withstanding the assault of a True Monarch-level beast.</p><p>Zhong Mao Zhi, Zhi Altar.</p><p>The two grand masters felt something, their gazes turning to Ji Zhen Jing.</p><p>One chanted:</p><p>“The supreme moon of the central heavens, its clear light illuminates ten thousand paths.</p><p>The wind shakes the moonlit pines, but when the wind stills, the moon remains whole.”</p><p>The other chanted:</p><p>“Clear shadows divide the four seasons, their lengths measured by the three watches of the night.</p><p>Only for selfless illumination, it follows the wind to the Great Void.”</p><p>The chants, originating from the Zhi Altar, spread to all the affiliated altars under the jurisdiction of the Tianshu Academy, audible to all altar masters and practicing cultivators.</p><p>Those familiar with the Daoist scriptures instantly understood what to do, their faces showing excitement as they followed instructions, summoning talismans.  The radiant light of the talismans echoed the Zhi Altar.</p><p>The assembled masters chanted in unison: “妙果素月天尊!” </p><p>The altars beneath the two grand masters trembled slightly. The central heavenly moon seemed to respond, showering Zhong Mao Zhi's altar with soft moonlight. The figures of the two grand masters became ethereal, as if draped in a layer of moonlight.</p><p>Within the moonlight, the voices of the two grand masters resounded together:</p><p>“Central heavenly moon, illuminate the bright light.</p><p>The three scenes shine together, illuminating all the heavens.</p><p>The rivers and seas are silent, the mountains and valleys shrouded in mist.</p><p>A single incense stick is lit, and the sacred name is proclaimed.”</p><p>With the incantations, the divine light of talismans flickered between the two grand masters, finally manifesting a wisp of fragrant incense, its scent drifting upwards to the nine heavens.</p><p>The assembled masters again chanted devoutly: “妙果素月天尊!” </p><p>The chant soared, shaking the nine heavens and the moon.</p><p>In Zhong Mao Zhi territory, those who looked to the sky saw the moon’s halo expand almost twofold.  Outside the double moon, a third moon seemed to appear.</p><p>At that moment, at the Zhi Altar, the grand master facing north stood up, swept his whisk, and performed ritual steps.</p><p>“The path of true purity and tranquility, is like the precious moon of the central heavens.</p><p>Cleanse the obscuring clouds, leaving no trace, illuminating the vast expanse of the void.”</p><p>The assembled masters responded.</p><p>They chanted several more incantations, each requiring corresponding talismans and precise ritual steps and hand gestures.</p><p>The expressions of the assembled masters became increasingly solemn, as if in a pilgrimage, chanting in unison, their voices imbued with a peculiar rhythm.</p><p>“Pure and radiant moon, dwelling in a fragrant breeze.</p><p>Dividing space to create scenes, gathering energy to suspend in the heavens.</p><p>We, the descendants of the Xuan, admire your pure dust.</p><p>We humbly submit, merging with the Dao and becoming true!”</p><p>The bright moonlight showered its brilliance, the moon growing brighter, as if it were truly about to descend from the heavens to the mortal world.</p><p>Within the Divine Court.</p><p>There was a divine temple, with a plaque bearing the inscription: 月宫黄华素曜元精圣后太阴元君 .  This was the temple of one of the Nine Luminaries Star Monarchs, the Taiyin Yuanjun, also known as the ‘Taiyin Huangjun.’</p><p>Within the temple, the statue of Taiyin Yuanjun emitted a cold, moonlit aura, clearly sensing the summons from the lower realm.</p><p>The grand master wielding the whisk looked up to the heavens, bowing to present his petition:</p><p>“The clear wind caresses the face, the true fragrance penetrates the Taiyin Palace.</p><p>The moon proclaims the words, the Daoist decree requests the descent of the supreme incantation!”</p><p>The incantation finished.</p><p>The grand master suddenly flung his whisk towards the north, pointing towards Ji Zhen Jing.</p><p>In Ji Zhen Jing's immortal city, at the Jingtan Altar, divine light suddenly shot towards the asterisms Dou and Niu.  A figure floated up with the divine light – a woman in a Daoist robe.</p><p>The woman had a solemn expression, wearing a芙蓉碧霄冠  and a犀簪 .</p><p>She wore a purple Daoist robe adorned with green and multicolored clouds, along with thirty-two purple and multicolored cloud scarves.  Her crimson skirt had five panels and four pleats, and she wore a black jade gui at her waist.</p><p>She ascended into the air, gazing at the central heavens, her breath harmonizing with the heavenly moon.</p><p>At this moment, all the moonlight within Zhong Mao Zhi territory converged towards Ji Zhen Jing.</p><p>The central heavenly moon shone brightly.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The woman spread her arms, her Daoist robe fluttering.</p><p>A beam of moonlight descended from the heavens.</p><p>At this moment, all the cultivators gazed at the woman with reverence and excitement.  Bathed in moonlight, she seemed ethereal, like Taiyin Yuanjun herself descending to the mortal realm.</p><p>Infinite divine power poured into her crown chakra. Her breath surged, but a contorted expression appeared on her pretty face, as if she were enduring a terrible impact and pain.  She gritted her teeth, finally surpassing a certain limit.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Outside the Immortal City, a ferocious tiger landed heavily, its forward momentum checked.  Its fierce eyes were fixed on the celestial maiden in the sky. Sensing a threat from her, it let out a series of roars.</p><p>Swish!</p><p>The maiden opened her eyes, her gaze cold and emotionless.  Divine light, like lightning, shot directly into the tiger's eyes, provoking an even more furious roar.</p><p>The tiger transformed into a yellow smoke and crashed into the Immortal City!</p><p>…</p><p>The ground war raged.</p><p>In the moonlight, outside the Divine Court.</p><p>Tian Yue, wielding his sword before the Heavenly Gate, fought a lone battle against a Great Sage of the demon race.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>A five-clawed golden dragon, riding on towering golden flames, swooped down, its tail lashing out, fiercely striking at Tian Yue.</p><p>The dragon's tail whipped out, transforming into a ten-thousand-zhang golden rainbow, its power awe-inspiring.</p><p>Facing this terrifying attack, Tian Yue remained calm.  He pointed his sword, and countless sword lights sprang forth, instantly shooting towards the rainbow.</p><p>The sword lights formed a river of swords, vast and unstoppable, sharp enough to pierce through anything, directly cutting at the golden rainbow.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The front of the rainbow shattered, golden light scattering everywhere.</p><p>The river of swords surged upstream within the ten-thousand-zhang golden rainbow, its advance irresistible, unstoppable!</p><p>The sword point aimed directly at the dragon's head!</p><p>The five-clawed golden dragon felt a slight pain between its brows, its gaze narrowed.  It raised its forepaw, slashed through the void, and spewed out a dense golden light, forming a golden dragon claw in front of its body.</p><p>The dragon claw was enormous, its claws sharp as blades, grabbing at the river of swords, each movement accompanied by the sounds of wind and thunder.</p><p>Rumbling…</p><p>The void seemed to be torn apart by the dragon's claw.</p><p>As the river of swords pierced through the ten-thousand-zhang golden rainbow, the dragon claw arrived.</p><p>Bang bang bang…</p><p>The dragon claw clenched, seizing countless sword lights in its grasp. The sword lights struck the claw as if piercing gold and iron, extinguishing one after another.</p><p>The five-clawed golden dragon violently shook its body, attempting to bypass Tian Yue. But as it moved, a deafening tearing sound echoed.</p><p>The seemingly dominant dragon claw was suddenly shattered; the river of swords continued its relentless assault.</p><p>The five-clawed golden dragon's expression changed instantly; it let out an urgent low growl. Its scales shimmered, and golden armor materialized out of thin air.</p><p>The armor was ancient and simple, radiating golden light, forming a swirling vortex centered on the golden dragon.</p><p>Seeing this, Tian Yue immediately changed his sword technique. The river of swords, originally aimed at the dragon, retracted its momentum, its beginning and end connecting to form a sword ring, encircling the five-clawed golden dragon.</p><p>As the sword ring was about to close, Tian Yue sensed something amiss, his brow furrowing.</p><p>Then, a heavy booming sound came from within the sword ring. A dark light appeared within the golden light vortex.</p><p>This light was strange, seemingly capable of absorbing the golden light. Those who looked upon it felt a chilling sensation.</p><p>As the dark light spread rapidly, its source revealed itself: an ancient, obelisk-shaped stele.</p><p>The stele stood on the back of the five-clawed golden dragon, its body completely black, its surface engraved with unintelligible inscriptions, the characters curving and twisting, as strange as the dark light itself.</p><p>The golden dragon, carrying the stele, roared in anger!</p><p>The stele vibrated, releasing a surge of dark light, like monstrous waves, or a fog of countless vengeful spirits, its aura extremely terrifying, crashing towards the sword ring.</p><p>For a moment, the sword lights within the ring dimmed. Countless sword lights were tainted by the dark light, turning black before disappearing.</p><p>The five-clawed golden dragon lunged forward, breaking through the sword ring's blockade. As it prepared to continue its assault, it suddenly felt a pang of foreboding.</p><p>The sword ring vanished.</p><p>In its place was a single sword light, a single spiritual sword.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>A three-foot long green blade hung upside down in the sky, descending from above. As it fell, its momentum grew, instantly transforming into a rainbow of light, its edge aimed directly at the five-clawed golden dragon's vital scale.</p><p>Locked by the sword's intent, the golden dragon felt a chilling terror.  Despite its golden armor and incredibly strong body, it felt completely unable to resist.</p><p>If it persisted, a direct hit by this sword would either kill it or severely wound it!</p><p>The five-clawed golden dragon had tried to overestimate its opponent, but it never imagined that without using that destructive divine sword, this person still possessed such terrifying swordsmanship!</p><p>Swish!</p><p>In desperation, the five-clawed golden dragon abandoned its forward charge, shifting its body laterally, puffing out its cheeks, and spewing out a ball of golden light.</p><p>This golden light's scale was less than its previous attacks, but it was far denser, like a dragon pearl.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The sound of the collision echoed throughout the heavens.</p><p>The spiritual sword paused in mid-air.</p><p>The golden pearl suddenly dimmed and shot back, swallowed by the five-clawed golden dragon.</p><p>A five-clawed golden dragon grunted, its body trembling as if it had been injured.  Murderous intent blazed from its dragon eyes.</p><p>"You seek death!"</p><p>The five-clawed golden dragon bared its fangs, abandoning its charge.  It had sensed the arrival of its guardian deity.  Its gaze passed over Tian Yue Shangren, towards the Divine Court.</p><p>A moment later, a brilliant green light appeared on the horizon.</p><p>Wind and thunder raged.</p><p>The green light, like pure wood essence, shot towards the five-clawed golden dragon, sinking into its body.  Although a five-clawed dragon, it had summoned Mu De Sui Xing Jun, one of the Nine Luminaries.  Being a Great Saint itself, the summoned guardian deity was of comparable rank, thus avoiding the complexities required by a Grand Master.</p><p>Demonic cultivation was ultimately inferior to orthodox methods; it could only summon a guardian deity, not higher-ranking celestial beings.  After its transformation, its burden increased significantly.</p><p>But the five-clawed golden dragon had no time for such concerns.  It had to give its all and seize the Divine Court!</p><p>"Transformation?"</p><p>Tian Yue Shangren, recalling the Daoist Court's legacy, grew more serious but remained calm. This was expected.  Divine power originated from celestial beings; after a cultivator's transformation, their improvements were primarily in their Daoist arts.  Demons cultivated demonic energy, focusing more on their innate bloodline abilities, thus unable to fully utilize the power of transformation.</p><p>Of course, killing the five-clawed dragon wouldn't be easy.</p><p>*Ding!*</p><p>The spirit sword trembled slightly.</p><p>The five-clawed dragon's ferocious expression froze.  This time, there were no thousands of sword lights; the sword itself seemed to fade from sight. Yet, the dragon sensed sword intent everywhere in the void!  No matter which direction it charged, sword intent blocked its path.</p><p>*Crack!*</p><p>Thunder roared.</p><p>Streams of green demonic lightning erupted beneath the five-clawed dragon, spreading across half the sky. The lightning struck the surrounding void.  The void felt strangely dark, though nothing was visible to the naked eye.</p><p>*Rumble…*</p><p>Without warning, large swathes of demonic lightning vanished, revealing fleeting sword shadows.  Breaches appeared in the lightning net, as if multiple spirit swords had pierced through, striking at the dragon.</p><p>The five-clawed golden dragon leaped into the air, whipping up a bone-chilling demonic wind.  A single swipe of its claw generated thick demonic lightning, countless bolts wildly attacking the invisible sword intent.  Simultaneously, the dragon displayed its treasures.  Following its golden armor, pointed obelisk, and dragon pearl, it unleashed several more, some intact, some damaged—all invaluable heirlooms of Gui Fang, each possessing immense power.</p><p>In contrast, Tian Yue Shangren wielded only two swords!  He used the Po Jun Divine Sword, sending two sword shadows towards Nie Yuan and Nie Hai, simultaneously confronting the demonic Great Saint with his life-bound spirit sword—effectively multitasking.  With just one sword, he repelled all the dragon's attacks, preventing it from crossing a certain boundary.</p><p>The five-clawed dragon roared in furious rage.</p><p>The roar reached the Great Saint's Mansion.  The demonic soldiers were on high alert, expecting an attack from the Daoist Court's True Monarch, who, however, hadn't attacked the mansion to seize the Demon-Summoning Drum.  Hearing the Great Saint's roar, the demonic soldiers immediately shifted their formation.  The mansion was packed with soldiers; their movement was like a flood, forming an incredibly complex demonic array centered around several Demon Kings.  As the formation completed, the Demon Kings pointed towards the heavens; beams of light, like swords, shot towards the zenith, supporting the Great Saint from afar.</p><p>The pressure on the sword-wielding True Monarch intensified; his vision was filled with the demonic lightning's glare.  His face was pale, yet he stood tall, one hand resting on the Po Jun Divine Sword's hilt, calmly observing his opponent, never retreating.</p><p>In this critical moment, Nie Yuan and Nie Hai finally shifted. The ferocious nature of the great evil gained the upper hand, attacking the sword shadows.  The sword shadows had lost their deterrent effect, and the Daoist Court now had some resistance.</p><p>Tian Yue Shangren glanced at the ground, unleashed a final sword shadow to repel the great evil, then retracted his sword intent, feeling the pressure lessen considerably!</p><p>*Clap!*</p><p>Tian Yue Shangren removed his hand from the Po Jun Divine Sword's hilt, stepping forward, his foot seemingly piercing the void, momentarily halting the demonic lightning.  Golden light flashed within the lightning, revealing the five-clawed dragon's near-frenzied form.</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>The spirit sword reappeared before Tian Yue Shangren; its intent abruptly gathered.  His eyes gleaming, he let out a long laugh, drowning out the thunder, imbued with awe-inspiring power. "Please, friend, receive another strike from this old man!"</p><p>*Hum!*</p><p>A thousand-foot sword light, its momentum like a rainbow!…</p><p>While Tian Yue Shangren and the five-clawed golden dragon battled…</p><p>At the Zhong Mao Zhi Zhi Altar's Daoist Academy…</p><p>Zhang Zhenjun, seated at the altar, holding the Du Gong Seal, felt a slight shift. The celestial energy constantly flowing into the academy paused briefly, then surged into his body with even greater force. In an instant, Zhang Zhenjun broke through; but he didn't stop, slightly consolidating his cultivation before continuing to absorb celestial energy.</p><p>Soon after, a similar event unfolded at the Bai Shi Zhi Zhi Altar's Daoist Academy.  A female cultivator, holding the Bai Shi Du Gong Seal, her expression serene, steadily crossed the threshold of cultivation, quickly advancing to the middle stage of the He Tu Daoist position.</p><p>Unlike Zhang Zhenjun, she didn't wait to consolidate.  She slowly rose, took graceful steps, and left the academy.</p><p></p>
