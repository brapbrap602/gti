<h1>Chapter 2118: First Battle</h1><p>"Greetings, Master Shao."</p><p>Si Lu appeared at the edge of Lei Ze, bowing only to the Master Shao, ignoring everyone else.</p><p>Master Shao sized Si Lu up, saying, "A thousand years ago, King Yan brought you to my estate. We've met before."</p><p>Si Lu nodded. "I was young and inexperienced then. My father requested your guidance, Master Shao.  I still remember it vividly, though times have changed."</p><p>Master Shao smiled, but didn't reply.</p><p>King Lu, ever patient, didn't show anger at Si Lu's disregard, finally speaking, "Why doesn't Attendant Xia appear? Does he know he's deeply culpable and is ashamed to show his face?"</p><p>Si Lu's eyes flashed with cold disdain. "Attendant Xia has urgent matters.  You, a treacherous backstabber who only resorts to deceit, have no right to demand his presence!"</p><p>King Lu smiled calmly, raising his hands to the sky in a righteous gesture.  "Heaven's justice is in the hearts of men! My actions are selfless.  I stopped your rebellion to prevent civil war and ensure the lasting stability of our Si You clan!  Fortunately, King Yan's attempt failed and he perished unexpectedly, preventing a greater disaster. I couldn't allow this poison to afflict future generations, so I had to resort to this.  By order of the Emperor, I'm here to subdue the remaining rebels. Surrender now!"</p><p>With the last words, King Lu roared, a sound like the earth shattering, echoing across the land.</p><p>The earth-shaking roar boosted the morale of the Si You army, who cried out in unison:</p><p>"Surrender!"</p><p>"Surrender!"</p><p>...</p><p>For a moment, their shouts almost drowned out the sounds of Lei Ze.</p><p>Accused by King Lu, Si Lu flew into a rage, gritting his teeth. "My father never rebelled! You coveted the Mirage Tower, poisoned my entire clan, and dared to deceive the Emperor, slandering my father! Your heart is truly wicked!"</p><p>Unmoved, King Lu calmly said, "King Yan's rebellion is undeniable. Don't try to deny it! If you're innocent, come back to the clan with us and plead your father's case before the Emperor."</p><p>Si Lu looked to Master Shao.</p><p>Master Shao nodded. "Indeed! I have the Emperor's decree to bring you and Attendant Xia back to the palace. If you feel wronged, come with me.  If you are truly innocent, the Emperor will ensure justice is served. Truth will prevail!"</p><p>King Lu, with an air of self-righteousness, continued, "The main culprits are Attendant Xia and King Yan. If it's determined you're not deeply involved, considering the Si family of Yan Mountain is one of the four great clans, we may spare your life. But if you persist, you will face utter ruin, and your clan will suffer! The Emperor is merciful and hasn't punished too many; they all hope for your return!"</p><p>"Utter ruin!"</p><p>"Utter ruin!"</p><p>...</p><p>The Si You army's shouts were like an avalanche, assaulting Si Lu's mind. King Lu's threat to use the surviving members of the Si family of Yan Mountain was undeniably cruel.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang's thunder-formed projection interjected, "King Yan's body was barely cold when the Lu family secretly poisoned his entire clan, revealing their vicious nature! If you two trust them, you'll likely be murdered before even reaching the Si You clan.  They'll claim it was self-defense, and the Lu family will get away with it!"</p><p>Si Lu clenched his fists, his anger fueling his resolve.</p><p>Their appearance served a dual purpose: to assess the Si You army's strength and gauge Master Shao's stance.</p><p>Master Shao's few words revealed crucial information. The Emperor hadn't openly condemned the Si family of Yan Mountain.  Master Shao's presence didn't necessarily mean he would side with the Lu family of Han Jiang. However, if they were easily defeated, Master Shao would likely join forces with King Lu to eliminate King Yan's remaining followers and solidify the Si family's guilt of rebellion.</p><p>This confirmation eased Si Lu's burden considerably. He said coldly, "I vowed to repay the Lu family tenfold, a hundredfold! I, Si Lu, will personally avenge my father and clear his name!"</p><p>Without hesitation, Si Lu turned and disappeared into the depths of Lei Ze, leaving behind a resolute back.</p><p>The smile faded from King Lu's face, and he coldly remarked, "Self-destruction!"</p><p>"King Lu, you're rather arrogant, dismissing me so easily?"</p><p>Qin Sang laughed loudly, shouting, "I intend to witness King Lu's skills. If you want to take those two away, you must first get past me!"</p><p>*Bang!* The projection shattered, splitting into several bolts of lightning.</p><p>*Rumble!* The lightning surged faster, thunder shaking the heavens.</p><p>In the eyes of the Si You army, countless bolts of lightning filled the void, endlessly swirling, born and dying with terrifying power.</p><p>No one could confidently pass through unharmed.  The weaker cultivators wouldn't even withstand a single bolt.</p><p>Blinding flashes of lightning seared the eyes.  Heaven and earth seemed to be nothing but destruction under the might of the thunder.</p><p>The Thunder Marsh was a natural barrier, stretching across the path of the Siyou army.</p><p>King Lu gazed intently, then turned to the Shao Shi and asked, "Can the Wu Ding Eight Extreme Diagram be anchored here?"</p><p>Shao Shi immediately understood King Lu's intention. It seemed he wouldn't launch a direct assault but rather rely on the diagram for a steady, gradual advance.</p><p>Looking around and sensing the area, Shao Shi nodded, "Yes."</p><p>The Grand Attendant, who had remained silent until now, spoke up, "Shao Shi, how far will the Wu Ding Eight Extreme Diagram's power extend?  If our people encounter danger within the enemy formation, can you use the diagram to rescue them?"</p><p>Shao Shi moved his lips slightly, communicating with the Grand Attendant through voice transmission.</p><p>The Grand Attendant nodded repeatedly, finally bowing, "Thank you, Shao Shi."</p><p>Shao Shi returned the bow, briefly appearing before vanishing again into the shadows.</p><p>Moments later, the land trembled, descending rapidly before hovering three hundred meters above the sea.</p><p>Then, a golden-yellow light emanated from the land, sinking into the seabed.  Waves crashed, and the water churned, as if something were about to erupt from the depths.</p><p>'Splash!'  A gigantic wave rose, revealing a mountain peak emerging from the sea.  The peak continued to grow, eventually connecting with the land, becoming a pillar supporting it.</p><p>One by one, more peaks rose from the ocean, until eight magnificent peaks stood majestically above the waves.</p><p>Instantly, everyone felt a sense of solidity underfoot; the land had become much firmer, not because of the pillars, but for some inexplicable reason.</p><p>King Lu remained cautious, leading everyone back to the palanquin.</p><p>Yuan Miao knew the following discussions would involve troop deployment and the Lu family's secrets, and he wouldn't be allowed to listen.  He flew towards a mountain peak where his cave dwelling was located.</p><p>After Shao Shi deployed the Wu Ding Eight Extreme Diagram, Yuan Miao couldn't leave freely. As long as King Lu didn't break their agreement, he was powerless and could only observe.</p><p>From inside the palanquin, they could clearly see the lightning dancing in the sky.</p><p>King Lu looked at everyone, "The enemy is ready. Who dares to venture into their formation to scout their strength?"</p><p>Their strategy was to proceed cautiously, but that didn't mean they could afford to slow down.</p><p>This expedition had a time limit. The Zhuyan wouldn't allow another tribe's army to remain on their territory indefinitely.</p><p>The ancient pact also stipulated a time limit.</p><p>The countdown began the moment they set foot on Zhuyan territory. Today, they had only three years left.</p><p>They must defeat their opponent within three years; this was their only chance.</p><p>If Si Lu escaped Zhuyan territory within three years, he could never return and would lose their protection.  Similarly, if they failed to capture Si Lu here, they must also stop after three years; otherwise, the Zhuyan would have grounds to intervene. Afterwards, they'd have to wait for Si Lu to leave Zhuyan territory before attacking him.</p><p>Three years – not short, not long.</p><p>This was a war between armies, not a duel between two individuals.</p><p>Cultivators at the Transcending Void stage could manipulate the world's energy. As long as they weren't cut off from the world, their spiritual energy wouldn't deplete. Two equally strong Transcending Void cultivators could fight for a year or two without a clear winner.</p><p>Wars between mortals could easily last for years, let alone when both sides possess top-tier experts. Of course, cultivators could fly and teleport, so in the Immortal cultivation world, once one side falls behind, the battle could be resolved quickly.</p><p>Three years might not even be enough to decipher the enemy's formation patterns.</p><p>King Lu and the Grand Attendant suspected Si Lu's willingness to stay was based on this very tactic.</p><p>Xia Changshi hadn’t appeared, his fate unknown.  Based on information from informants and the Grand Attendant’s assessment of Xia Changshi, Si Lu and that Qin Zhenren, while appearing confident, might not actually possess the strength to rival them.</p><p>But precisely because of this, the Grand Attendant didn't dare to assume Xia Changshi was dead. The combination of uncertainty and a sufficiently complex formation could buy Si Lu three years, forcing their army to retreat and leaving him safe.</p><p>"I volunteer!"</p><p>Before the words could fully leave his mouth, someone jumped out – Lu Gan.</p><p>Years ago, Lu Gan had been forced to retreat by Qin Sang, who was a lower cultivation level,  suffering a humiliating defeat and injury using the mutual transformation technique, a disgrace he never forgot.</p><p>At that time, his four companion beasts were one short, greatly weakening his killing move. Otherwise, the outcome would have been uncertain.  With the Wu Ding Ba Ji Tu assisting him, he could finally unleash his full power and avenge his previous defeat.</p><p>Unexpectedly, as soon as he stepped forward, the Grand Protector shook his head and said, "Not suitable!"</p><p>Lu Gan dared not question the Grand Protector, bowing his head to listen. He heard the Grand Protector say, "In our ranks, those stronger than you are few. To send you in the first battle, who would we use afterwards? Moreover, the Shao Shi will not act directly; someone must be stationed at the Wu Ding Ba Ji Tu, ready to rescue at any moment. This task is most suitable for you.  The outcome of a single battle is insignificant; a gradual approach is the best strategy…"</p><p>The Grand Protector then turned to look to the side.</p><p>Two people sat there, both dressed in fine silks and appearing dignified.</p><p>Their appearances were quite different; one was effeminate, the other masculine, yet their auras were remarkably similar, like a couple.</p><p>In fact, they were not a couple and had no blood relation, but they were as close as family.</p><p>They cultivated the same technique, yet unexpectedly developed two completely different temperaments and discovered they complemented each other, so they remained inseparable, changing their names to Shi Mu and Shi Ying – names sounding like siblings – while their real names remained unknown.</p><p>Later, they both broke through to the Sky Realm, Double-Layer, becoming instantly famous.</p><p>They were not subordinates of the Lu King, more like independent cultivators, invited by the Grand Protector.</p><p>Several others were similar, the cultivators divided into two circles. The inner circle, naturally, consisted of the Lu King's confidants, while Shi Mu and the others were in the outer circle, offering no opinions.</p><p>The Grand Protector looked at the two, "May we request your assistance for the first battle?"</p><p>Shi Mu and Shi Ying exchanged a glance, rose, and said in unison, "Agreed! Let us take this round!"</p><p>If the enemy intended to delay, the first engagement was often the safest, so they readily agreed.</p><p>The Lu King rejoiced, "Then we trouble you two, Lu Gan!"</p><p>"Yes!" Lu Gan, understanding he would not be fighting anytime soon, put aside his thoughts and bowed in response.</p><p>"By order of the King, entrust the Jiu Gui Division to Daoists Shi Mu and Shi Ying to lead, allowing them to assault the formation and following their commands!  Anyone who dares disobey will be executed without mercy!"</p><p>"Yes!"</p><p>Lu Gan immediately left the palanquin.</p><p>The Lu family army was divided into various divisions named after Lu family territories.  Apart from two divisions of the Lu King’s personal guard, the strength of the remaining divisions was nearly equal.</p><p>Since they were assaulting the formation, Shi Mu and Shi Ying could not go alone; they needed someone at their disposal.</p><p>Shortly after, flags fluttered outside the palanquin, a sea of black.</p><p>Every member of the Jiu Gui Division wore black helmets and armor, their morale high, their discipline impeccable, and their lowest cultivation at the Yuan Realm, Fourth-Layer.  Furthermore, they were fully equipped, proficient in various battle formations, capable of handling any situation.</p><p>Seeing this, Shi Mu and Shi Ying secretly admired it.  Training a Jiu Gui Division wouldn't be difficult, but the Jiu Gui Division was just one of many under the Lu King.  The foundation of a powerful family was too deep.</p><p>No wonder among independent cultivators, those who made a name for themselves were mostly absorbed by the imperial family and the Four Great Clans.</p><p>"Wishing you both a triumphant return!"</p><p>The Lu King produced spirit wine for a send-off.</p><p>The two finished the spirit wine in one gulp.  With a command, the army set off, a black torrent surging from the land, heading towards Lei Ze with unyielding confidence.</p><p>Lu Gan also acted, flashing toward the highest peak in the center of the land; there was a clear pond, its water as still as a mirror.</p><p>Flying above the clear pond, Lu Gan sat cross-legged in mid-air, his clothes dry. His reflection appeared in the clear pond. Then, the water trembled slightly, the reflection shattered into countless fragments, suddenly disappearing.</p><p>At the same time, cultivators from other divisions of the Lu family cast spells in other corners of the land.</p><p>The next moment, Lu Gan clearly sensed a vast power, not his own, but under his control.</p><p>No adjustment was needed; the power was incredibly compliant, obeying his will.</p><p>Quickly mastering this power, Lu Gan focused his will forward, and Shi Mu and the others appeared within his 'vision'.</p><p>Lu Gan made a mental gesture, and an invisible ripple spread, remotely strengthening Shi Mu and the others, establishing a connection between them and the Wu Ding Ba Ji Tu. This allowed him to locate their positions within the enemy's formation and rescue them in time.</p><p>The Jiu Gui Division remained unaware; only Shi Mu and Shi Ying felt a subtle change, sensing something. For safety, they had each left behind a companion beast, and with the protection of the Wu Ding Ba Ji Tu, their lives would undoubtedly be safe, so they confidently charged into battle.</p><p>Inside Lei Ze, Qin Sang looked west and calmly said, "They've arrived!"</p>
