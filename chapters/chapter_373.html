Chapter 366: The Guide


Entering the market, Yun Youzi strolled along, eventually stopping before a shop called 'Skywind Pavilion' and stepping inside.


The shop was a simple, single-story stone building of concrete, somewhat ironically named a pavilion. The owner, a spry old man, sat inside, fiddling with a magical artifact, his aura subtly concealed.


Qin Sang, using the *Dunling Jue* to disguise himself as a newly-minted Foundation Establishment cultivator, followed Yun Youzi inside.  Unable to discern the shopkeeper's true nature, he felt a sudden chill.


He knew that powerful forces backed these shops, some directly affiliated with major sects. This man, stationed in Wuyaya Valley, was undoubtedly someone of significant status and power.


"Greetings, friend," Yun Youzi said with a bow. "I wish to purchase a map of the first two levels of Wuyaya Valley.  Do you have any for sale?"


The second level, while not as volatile as the first, still warranted a map for precaution.


The shopkeeper, upon seeing Qin Sang and Yun Youzi's cultivation, immediately stood up with a wide smile, hurrying to greet them. "Welcome, esteemed guests! Your presence graces my humble shop!"


After settling down, the shopkeeper poured tea and said, "You've come to the right place. I do indeed sell maps, categorized into three tiers with varying levels of detail. Which tier interests you?"


Yun Youzi pondered, "We're newcomers here, intending to gather spirit herbs in Wuyaya Valley.  The most detailed map would be ideal..."


The shopkeeper's smile widened. Stroking his beard, he said, "The most detailed, naturally, is the best tier, but the price…"


Yun Youzi, clearly wealthy, said, "As long as the map is sufficiently detailed, the price is no object!"


After paying, the shopkeeper produced a jade slip.  Both Yun Youzi and Qin Sang frowned upon examining it.


Qin Sang glared, "Are you making fools of us?  The map shows several routes in detail at the beginning. But towards the end, it becomes a complete mess; the inner first level has barely any markings.  You dare call this the best map?"


The shopkeeper seemed unsurprised by Qin Sang's reaction, protesting,  "Esteemed guest, you must understand that Wuyaya Valley is constantly changing.  A completely accurate map is impossible. The beast tide recently subsided, and these few routes were painstakingly explored by a consortium of trading companies. Following them should ensure safety, barring unforeseen circumstances."


Qin Sang snorted, feigning anger. "What use is safety? These routes don't even reach half of the first level, and there's almost nothing along the way! There's not even a single Huanglong Grass marked.  Are we supposed to just go sightseeing?"


Yun Youzi subtly tugged at Qin Sang, who pretended to look sheepish but remained indignant.


"You wish to gather Huanglong Grass?"


The shopkeeper looked enlightened, explaining quickly.


"It seems you are first-time visitors to Wuyaya Valley...


"Some areas in Wuyaya Valley indeed grow Huanglong Grass, but they are located in several perilous zones in the inner first level.


"A few locations were charted before the recent beast tide.


"However, after the tide, Wuyaya Valley changed dramatically. Places once safe are now occupied by beasts or have become demonic lairs – completely normal. The herbs there were either consumed or destroyed by the creatures.


"I dare not add inaccurate information to the map, lest I endanger you.


"If you insist, I can provide you with a map of those locations, but you would have to explore them yourselves."


"There is another way…"


The shopkeeper paused.


Yun Youzi placed his hand on the table, saying firmly, "If you can help us, the reward will be substantial."


Satisfied with the promise, the shopkeeper leaned forward, "You could hire a guide to take you in… If you trust me, I can make introductions."


"A guide?" Yun Youzi hesitated.  "Are there people who know Wuyaya Valley better than you?"


The shopkeeper nodded, "The most knowledgeable are not us, but the outlaws who roam Wuyaya Valley.


"They braved the dangers immediately after the beast tide, exploring the valley first.


"They wouldn't sell us their maps, and the valley is ever-changing; only they know the latest conditions."


Actually, if you wander around the market town or go near the Wuyagu Valley, you'll easily find people claiming to be guides.  However, most of them are unreliable and untrustworthy.

"As the shopkeeper of Tianfeng Tower, I vouch for the reputation of my establishment.  The people I recommend are trustworthy."

Yunyouzi and Qin Sang exchanged a glance.

They knew the shopkeeper wasn't lying.  They chose Tianfeng Tower precisely for its reliability, wanting to avoid deceitful individuals and wasting time.

While a shopkeeper's recommendation isn't a guarantee, their reputation is on the line, so they wouldn't take such risks lightly.

After a brief discussion, Yunyouzi said, "In that case, we would appreciate your introduction. We'll meet the guide and decide then."

The shopkeeper readily agreed, sending out several message talismans.

Shortly after, a talisman returned.  The shopkeeper checked it, his face brightening. "A guide has assembled a team and is about to depart. He knows of a place where Huanglong grass grows and is willing to lead the way.  If you're interested, I'll take you to meet him."


Yunyouzi and Qin Sang immediately stood.

"This way, please."

The shopkeeper led them to a wooden hut behind a mountain ridge.  "This is it…"

He then sent out a burst of spiritual energy to activate the hut's protective barrier.

With a creak, the door opened from within, and a young man of around thirty appeared.

His cultivation was not concealed, similar to Yunyouzi's.

Oddly, despite being a cultivator, his face was pale and bloodless, his body thin and weak, giving the impression of a severely anemic mortal—remarkably unusual.

"Kong Xin greets the seniors!"

The young man bowed to the shopkeeper, then turned to Yunyouzi and Qin Sang, "Greetings to both of you."
