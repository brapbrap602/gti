<h1>Chapter 995: A Grave Matter</h1><p>The two continued to work on breaking the fire curse.</p><p>Ultimately, they didn't completely remove it. Bai perfected the Demonic Fire Curse Seal and left a secondary seal within Qin Sang, preparing to refine a Fire Curse Seed.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist, please give me the spirit herbs first. The previous overexertion has significantly impacted me. I need to stabilize my vital essence before I have the energy to refine the Fire Curse Seed," Bai said, his expression shifting slightly after sensing his internal condition.</p><p>Qin Sang quickly handed Bai the pouch containing the spirit herbs.</p><p>These herbs were gathered by Manager Liu of the Qiongyu Trading Company. They had taken them when they raided the company.  To avoid arousing Qin Sang's suspicion, Manager Liu had been quite diligent, gathering about thirty percent of the herbs on the list.</p><p>"These are too few. After we leave this place, I will help you acquire the rest," Qin Sang promised.</p><p>His relationship with the Qiongyu Trading Company was now irrevocably broken, rendering his previous connections useless. He would have to procure the remaining herbs himself. Fortunately, he had slain the Left Deputy and five other Golden Core cultivators, gaining substantial wealth. He had plenty of spirit stones.</p><p>Bai accepted the spirit herbs and nodded. "As a temporary measure, this is sufficient."</p><p>After Bai returned to his cave,</p><p>Qin Sang sat on his meditation mat, lost in thought.</p><p>The remnants of the fire curse were negligible, and with Bai's seal, the danger was essentially eliminated.</p><p>However, once bitten, twice shy. Qin Sang felt it was prudent to remain within the Storm Belt. This hidden realm seemed stable; he would wait until Bai finished refining the Fire Curse Seed before leaving.</p><p>He could finally rest properly.</p><p>Qin Sang instructed the Skyeye Butterfly to keep watch and lay down, falling into a deep sleep.</p><p>Hidden realms had no day or night.</p><p>He slept for an unknown amount of time.</p><p>Upon waking, Qin Sang felt refreshed. He sat in meditation, circulating his cultivation technique, refining his true essence, and purging the accumulated impurities from his body.</p><p>Ten days later,</p><p>Qin Sang had fully recovered. Only the absence of his avatar and the Twin-Headed Serpent made him feel somewhat unaccustomed.</p><p>Thinking of Mou Laomo, Qin Sang's expression darkened.</p><p>He replayed the events of the past few days in his mind.</p><p>Mou Laomo was obsessed with spiritual flames. First, he subdued the Winter Nether Flame left by Cultivator Dongming, and then he coveted the Nine Yin Demonic Fire, which led him to target Qin Sang.</p><p>"A treasure invites calamity!" Qin Sang lamented.</p><p>They had no prior grievance.</p><p>Yet, he had become a thorn in Mou Laomo's side.</p><p>Ultimately, it boiled down to his inferior strength, leaving him vulnerable.</p><p>After feeding the Skyeye Butterfly and the Fat Silkworm, Qin Sang left the cave. Seeing no sign of Bai, he guessed it might take some time for him to recover and refine the Fire Curse Seed.</p><p>Qin Sang flew up and spent the entire day meticulously repairing the ancient restrictions of the hidden realm before returning to his cave.</p><p>The Thousand Kilogram Ring flashed.</p><p>The Soul Nourishing Wood emerged, radiating a faint soul light.</p><p>Unable to leave for the time being, Qin Sang decided to reforge the Ebony Sword first, hoping to quickly increase his cultivation and break through to the late Golden Core stage.  If he encountered another powerful enemy, at least he wouldn't be so helpless.</p><p>The last time he reforged the Ebony Sword was during the Foundation Establishment stage.</p><p>It had taken him about twenty years to refine a thin sliver of the Netherworld Blood Mulberry.</p><p>This time, the Soul Nourishing Wood was larger, but his cultivation and refining skills were far superior. It certainly wouldn't take that long.</p><p>Qin Sang was eager to see what changes the Soul Nourishing Wood would bring to the Ebony Sword.</p><p>He took a piece of the Soul Nourishing Wood, summoned the Ebony Sword, and recalled the process of fusing spirit wood.</p><p>'Rise!'</p><p>Qin Sang pointed at the Ebony Sword.</p><p>With a clear ring, the Ebony Sword flew to his side and hovered beside the Soul Nourishing Wood, its blade gently enveloping the wood.</p><p>Qin Sang then closed his eyes and urged the Ebony Sword to fuse with the Soul Nourishing Wood.</p><p>Silence filled the cave.</p><p>Time slowly passed.</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly opened his eyes and looked at the Ebony Sword.</p><p>The Soul Nourishing Wood was 'dissolving,' and the Ebony Sword was about to absorb its pure wood essence.</p><p>Previously, it was at this moment that the anomaly occurred, the wood essence being tainted by the Netherworld Blood Mulberry, losing all its spirituality.</p><p>'Hum...'</p><p>The Ebony Sword trembled.</p><p>The Soul Nourishing Wood merged into the Ebony Sword.</p><p>Just then, a sinister blood-red hue suddenly appeared.</p><p>"Here it comes!" Qin Sang thought.</p><p>Just as the blood-red hue was about to pounce on the Soul Nourishing Wood, the wood erupted with a rich soul light. The blood-red hue, as if hitting a solid wall, was firmly blocked by the soul light, unable to penetrate even slightly.</p><p>The blood-red hue lingered, but it couldn't affect the Soul Nourishing Wood.</p><p>Finally, the Ebony Sword completely absorbed the Soul Nourishing Wood, transforming into a transparent sword embryo and floating before Qin Sang.</p><p>Overjoyed, Qin Sang withdrew the Ebony Sword into his Nascent Soul for nurturing. He then continued refining the Ebony Sword while comprehending the Killing Talisman.</p><p>...</p><p>One year later.</p><p>Qin Sang appeared in the Storm Belt.</p><p>He activated the Moon Gazing Rhinoceros Horn, determined his direction, and flew while taking out a dull gray pearl.</p><p>"I didn't expect it to take so long..." Qin Sang murmured, holding the pearl between his fingers.</p><p>After stabilizing his vital essence, Bai had failed more than ten times before finally refining this Fire Curse Seed.</p><p>Unknowingly, they had been stuck in the Storm Belt for a year.</p><p>After traveling through the storm for a long time, Qin Sang arrived at the outer edge, near Yuan Zhu's cave, and activated the restriction on the scale.</p><p>Previously, due to the urgency, Yuan Zhu had been vague. Qin Sang had intended to find Yuan Zhu and inquire further, but after waiting for a long time, there was no response.</p><p>"Could he be away from the cave? It seems I can only wait until the agreed-upon time..." Qin Sang pondered, then left without further delay, flying out of the Storm Belt.</p><p>Returning to the Boundless Sea felt like a lifetime had passed.</p><p>Qin Sang looked around.  Seeing no one, he summoned his flying light and headed west.</p><p>"Aren't you going to the Heavenly Dao Sect to find someone?" Bai asked.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced in the direction of the Heavenly Dao Sect and sighed. "It's already been delayed for so long, why rush? Let's go to Tianxing Island first and procure your spirit herbs to stabilize your vital essence."</p><p>He contemplated what identity to use.</p><p>His true identity, as well as the aliases Mingyue and Qingfeng, had all attracted powerful enemies, much to his dismay.</p><p>...</p><p>Tianxing Island.</p><p>Qin Sang entered the city in disguise and went straight to various shops and auction houses.</p><p>In just a few days, he had gathered almost all the spirit herbs Yuan Zhu needed. Only a few extremely rare and precious ones remained, which he could only hope to find by chance later.</p><p>While on Tianxing Island, Qin Sang had intended to discreetly inquire about Mou Laomo.</p><p>Knowing your enemy is crucial for victory.</p><p>Unexpectedly, with little effort, Qin Sang learned of a recent major event related to Mou Laomo, leaving him stunned.</p><p>Just a few months ago, Mou Laomo's Tianfeng Island was suddenly besieged.</p><p>The attackers were a joint force of the righteous path and the demonic path, the two most powerful human factions in the world.</p><p>It was said that Grand Cultivators Lingzhuzi and the Demon Lord personally took action.</p><p>From then on, Tianfeng Island was completely erased from the Boundless Sea!</p><p>Mou Laomo was renowned in the demonic path and even among all humankind.  It was rumored that the Demon Lord had once personally invited him to join his ranks.  On a list of cultivators most likely to break through to the late Nascent Soul stage, Mou Laomo's name was prominently featured.</p><p>This incident caused an immediate uproar, shaking the Four Seas.</p><p>Even after several months, the fervor surrounding it hadn't subsided.</p>
