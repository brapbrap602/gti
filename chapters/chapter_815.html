<h1>Chapter 807: The Shattered Wind Archipelago</h1><p>Qin Sang had just conceived this idea when the power automatically surged towards his back.</p><p>The next moment, a green light surged from his spine, and a pair of wings unfolded with a 'whoosh'.</p><p>The wings were proportionate to Qin Sang's size, but their shape was identical to that of a Qingluan, a mythical bird.</p><p>Qin Sang felt the new addition to his back, his eyes filled with surprise.  The feeling of the wings was unfamiliar, but he quickly learned how to control them.</p><p>"Fly…"</p><p>With a gentle flap of his wings, Qin Sang, without using any spells, slowly floated off the ground.  Initially, his flight was somewhat unsteady, but he soon gained control, moving nimbly around.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>A sudden gust of wind swept through the courtyard.</p><p>Qin Sang's figure flashed, transforming into a streak of green light, appearing in another corner an instant later—his speed astonishing.</p><p>"A divine ability, granting me the wings of a Qingluan… Am I human or demon?"</p><p>Qin Sang looked down at his shadow on the ground, secretly wondering and slightly worried.</p><p>Returning to the ground, Qin Sang retracted the ability, and the wings disappeared.</p><p>Qin Sang breathed a sigh of relief. He had no intention of abandoning his humanity; the ability to retract them was a relief.</p><p>This was the core island of the human race, teeming with powerful cultivators. Going out with a pair of wings would attract too much attention. If mistaken for a demon, he would have no way to explain himself.</p><p>"These demonic wings are quite fast. From now on, I will focus on refining them. Once I break through to the third level of the *Tian Yao Bian*, my escape speed will increase significantly!"</p><p>…</p><p>Tianxing City Market.</p><p>In a shop, the owner was chatting and laughing with a man in a green robe.</p><p>Both looked towards the door, and saw a young man hurrying towards them.  Upon his entry, both stood to greet him.</p><p>The shopkeeper seemed quite familiar with the young man, smiling and saying, "Daoist Qin, it's been a while. If it weren't for some unexpected good news today, it would be difficult to see you."</p><p>He then introduced the young man to the man in green robes, "This is Daoist Qin, as I mentioned.  Daoist Qin, despite being an independent cultivator, has already broken through to the mid-Core Formation stage at such a young age. He spent many years hunting demons in the Demon Sea and now practices diligently in Baogu Mountain. Everyone who knows him admires him."</p><p>The newcomer was Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang purchased his cultivation resources from these shops and was very familiar with the owners.  He sometimes commissioned them to gather information.</p><p>This time, he came because the shopkeeper had sent word that a fellow cultivator had arrived who knew of a Spirit Turtle Island, described as rather unusual.  He had rushed over immediately.</p><p>The Canglang Sea was vast, and many islands were named Spirit Turtle Island, none of which had any connection to his senior, Qingzhu.</p><p>"This is Daoist Wang?"</p><p>Qin Sang was polite to both, asking the shopkeeper.</p><p>He secretly sized up the man in green, who appeared to be in his forties or fifties, with an elegant demeanor, and was a Core Formation stage cultivator, also reportedly an independent cultivator.</p><p>The shopkeeper nodded and led them to a private room. "Daoist Wang is from the Shattered Wind Archipelago. He said that near the Shattered Wind Archipelago, there's an island called Spirit Turtle Island where many inexplicable events have occurred.  I thought of Daoist Qin; perhaps the place your friend went to is there."</p><p>"Shattered Wind Archipelago…"</p><p>Qin Sang recalled that this was an archipelago located in the southwest of the Canglang Sea, far from Tianxing Island, vast in area, with countless islands of varying sizes.</p><p>Remote from authority, the power there was naturally complex. The southwest sea was frequently plagued by storms and sea beasts, making it a dangerous and unruly place, rife with chaos, and effectively left to its own devices.</p><p>Such places were not uncommon in the Canglang Sea.</p><p>After the Demon Sea was pacified, things improved somewhat, but restoring stability remained impossible.</p><p>After returning, he had consulted the entire topographic map of the Canglang Sea, and remembered these important place names vividly.</p><p>"The topographic map doesn't seem to show a large island called Spirit Turtle Island in the Shattered Wind Archipelago?"</p><p>Daoist Wang smiled slightly, "Daoist Qin certainly won't find it on the map. Spirit Turtle Island is not a large island, and its location is extremely remote.  In fact, most cultivators in the Shattered Wind Archipelago don't even know where Spirit Turtle Island is."</p><p>"Oh?"</p><p>Qin Sang became interested, immediately inviting Daoist Wang to sit down and personally pouring tea.</p><p>"Spirit Turtle Island used to be a deserted island, not very large.  Because of its shape resembling a spirit turtle, someone casually named it Spirit Turtle Island, and the name stuck. No one expected that it hid a spirit vein. More than two hundred years ago, it was discovered by a mysterious person, who opened a cave dwelling on the island…"</p><p>Daoist Wang sipped his tea and began to recount the story.</p><p>At first, no one paid attention to this barren island.  People came and went, never noticing any signs of habitation.</p><p>Years later, however, someone discovered, to their surprise, that the island was ablaze with peach blossoms, transformed into a veritable Peach Blossom Island—clearly the work of someone.</p><p>Curious individuals then visited the island, some with less-than-honorable intentions.  Strangely, these people all mysteriously vanished without a trace.</p><p>Nearby cultivators were terrified, realizing the island housed a powerful formation, and that its master possessed immeasurable strength.  They wisely left it alone.</p><p>The island master remained a mystery, never appearing in public after settling on Turtle Island.  No one knew what he looked like.  Neighboring factions, initially wary, eventually concluded he was a reclusive cultivator and left him undisturbed.  A peaceful coexistence ensued.</p><p>Decades later, the island's protective array suddenly opened.  The master announced a single-night dharma lecture open to all cultivators.  News spread like wildfire, sparking immense curiosity about the master's identity.</p><p>Various factions, suspecting the master intended to found a sect, remained vigilant.  However, the lecture was exactly as advertised; at dawn, everyone was dismissed, and the island was sealed once more, without a word from the master.</p><p>The mysterious master lectured amidst the peach blossoms, explaining profound principles in an accessible manner.  The audience was captivated, each gaining valuable insights.  Every few years, he repeated this lecture, attracting many cultivators, some traveling great distances.  He remained unseen.</p><p>Attempts to become his disciple were rebuffed.</p><p>Those who'd attended his lectures treated him with the utmost respect, indicating the significance of his teachings.</p><p>"My hometown is not far from Turtle Island," the cultivator surnamed Wang recounted. "The island master held a lecture there before I left on my travels."</p><p>Qin Sang listened intently, increasingly convinced that Turtle Island was the place he sought, and that the island master was Senior Qingzhu!</p><p>Peach blossoms, peach trees…</p><p>The peach trees on Sword Gate Mountain had flourished since Senior Qingzhu's departure, their Red Jade Peaches exceptionally sweet.  This imagery was inextricably linked with him.</p><p>The mention of the island covered in peach blossoms had sent a jolt through Qin Sang.</p><p>He couldn't fathom why Senior Qingzhu would hold dharma lectures for ordinary cultivators.</p>
