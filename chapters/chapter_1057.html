<h1>Chapter 1499: The True Dragon's Remains</h1><p>Elder Wan of the Wan Clan gave a warning.</p><p>The High Priest and the others quickly took out their poison-repelling treasures.</p><p>The grey-robed elder, skilled in poisons, distributed some specially made antidotes to the others.</p><p>After making their preparations, the group teleported over one after another.</p><p>The light of the teleportation array faded.</p><p>The stone hall fell silent once more.</p><p>Above the stone hall, at the edge of the canyon, a figure stood with hands clasped behind their back, gazing down at the stone hall. Their gaze seemed to penetrate the dangerous restrictions within the valley.</p><p>Neither the High Priest nor Old Devil Fang had noticed this person's presence.</p><p>Their infiltration of the valley and activation of the stone hall had all been witnessed by this figure.</p><p>"How do you understand the Witchcraft formations? Even the Witch Clan's High Priest couldn't see through your manipulations."</p><p>A voice echoed, seemingly emanating from within this person's body.</p><p>"The Witch Clan's own inheritance has been broken. Is it that hard to deceive them?"</p><p>The figure retorted, seemingly conversing with themselves.</p><p>After a moment of silence, the voice within spoke again, its tone icy, "By leading the Witch Clan into the inner hall, what are you planning? No matter your purpose, with me here, you will not succeed!"</p><p>"Oh? What are you afraid of?"</p><p>The figure's lips curled into a sneer. "Since when did you develop such compassion?"</p><p>"I have no intention of shouldering the burden of all living beings, but a catastrophe cannot arise because of me!"</p><p>The voice within boomed, resolute and powerful.</p><p>A cold smile spread across the figure's face. "So you admit that this avatar and its nascent spirit are one with you? In that case, why not give up resisting? Let me consume you, and you will know my purpose."</p><p>Once the High Priest and the others activated the teleportation array, the figure tapped their foot and flew away.</p><p>...</p><p>The Inner Hall.</p><p>An unknown secret realm.</p><p>After breaking through the immortal restrictions and arriving here, the Dragon King and the other Demon Kings flew without pause, yet they couldn't seem to escape this desolate land.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Nine Phoenix, how much longer until we can leave this secret realm? If we continue like this, I'm afraid the Seven Slaughters Hall will close before we can escape. I don't want to be trapped here. Why didn't we use the True Phoenix Feather to teleport directly to the inner hall in the first place?"</p><p>The armored giant questioned in a deep voice, his tone laced with impatience.</p><p>Only after entering did the Demon Kings realize they hadn't arrived directly at the inner hall. This place bore no resemblance to the inner hall described in human records. It appeared to be a secret realm within the inner hall, sealed by immortal restrictions.</p><p>Immortal restrictions were commonplace in the inner hall, so this situation wasn't unexpected.</p><p>The Demon Kings could only search for an exit from the secret realm.</p><p>If they couldn't even escape the secret realm before the Seven Slaughters Hall closed, there was no point in talking about treasure hunting. The only good news was that there were no ferocious beasts or other dangers within the secret realm.</p><p>Nine Phoenix King was their hope of escape, but she hadn't found any clues yet.</p><p>"I used the power of the restrictions left by a senior of the Heavenly Phoenix Clan to clash with the immortal restrictions, which allowed me to send the True Phoenix Feather in. Attempting it elsewhere would drastically reduce the chance of success. Furthermore, as far as I know, aside from the few areas explored by humans, the inner hall is extremely dangerous. Avoiding this place might lead to encountering other perils."</p><p>Nine Phoenix King was displeased by the armored giant's aggressive attitude. Her expression was cold and her tone even more so.</p><p>The Dragon King intervened, smoothing things over. "Brother Hei, there's no need to be anxious. This secret realm must have been left by an ancestor of the Heavenly Phoenix Clan. Others would most likely be trapped here. Fellow Daoist Nine Phoenix is a descendant of the Heavenly Phoenix and possesses the True Phoenix Feather. Finding the exit isn't difficult, it just requires time."</p><p>After a pause, the Dragon King turned to Nine Phoenix King. "Fellow Daoist Nine Phoenix, Brother Hei's concerns are not unfounded. After leaving the secret realm, I need to use the Dragon Guiding Art to confirm the location of the True Dragon's remains. If it's too far away, we need to leave enough time to travel there. Finding a way out as soon as possible is key."</p><p>Nine Phoenix King nodded, raising her jade-like hand. The True Phoenix Feather floated in her palm as her true essence flowed into it.</p><p>She closed her eyes slightly, sensing something.</p><p>The black-armored giant chuckled dryly, not daring to disturb Nine Phoenix King. He glanced at the white bone in the Dragon King's hand and asked curiously, "Is this 'Dragon Guiding Art' you mentioned a secret technique passed down in your Dragon Clan?"</p><p>The Dragon King nodded. "Legend has it that the True Dragon's entire body is a treasure. After death, its bones cannot be left outside and must be returned to the Dragon Tomb for burial to avoid desecration. For this reason, the True Dragon Clan created a blood-guiding technique to find corpses. Although the Dragon Guiding Art is a tradition of our clan, it is said to be derived from this secret technique of the True Dragon Clan. This piece of bone is a true dragon bone, which I obtained from a human Nascent Soul cultivator. I later forced him to reveal that he had accidentally found it in the inner hall of the Seven Slaughters Hall. As long as the Seven Slaughters Hall contains the dragon's remains, we can use this bone and the Dragon Guiding Art to find it..."</p><p>The armored giant's eyes flickered. "Fellow Daoist, how strong do you think that True Dragon was in its prime? If it were a Heavenly Demon level True Dragon, its bones wouldn't have decayed to such an extent, right?"</p><p>"The might of a Heavenly Demon is beyond our comprehension."</p><p>The Dragon King stared at the nearly decayed bone in his hand. "Regardless, the True Dragon's power definitely surpasses ours. Any True Dragon relic could significantly increase our strength. If it's a complete dragon corpse that hasn't been looted, even though the bones have decayed, we might find its reverse scale, true blood, or even the more precious demon core. Then, reaching the Deity Transformation stage or even the Void Refinement stage wouldn't be a pipe dream..."</p><p>The Dragon King's tone carried a hint of enticement.</p><p>The other Demon Kings listened, their hearts filled with longing, wishing they could claim the dragon's remains right then and there.</p><p>"The difference between the current era and the ancient cultivation world stems from various aspects, and it's not something a single dragon corpse can make up for. Otherwise, we wouldn't see so few Deity Transformation cultivators, and Void Refinement would be even more unattainable."</p><p>The armored giant remained clear-headed, unfazed by the Dragon King's temptation. "I'll be content if I can smoothly break through to the late Transformation stage and survive a few more Heavenly Tribulations. If there truly is a chance for Deity Transformation, I only hope Fellow Daoist can succeed. We will assist you in seizing the teleportation array and counterattacking the cultivators. In the future, both realms will belong to our demon race! I just fear that the dragon corpse has already been found by the humans and completely looted."</p><p>He was worried about a wasted trip.</p><p>The Dragon King, however, was confident, replying calmly, "Even if you placed this bone in front of cultivators, they wouldn't recognize it. Moreover, the True Dragon's remains are not only useful to our demon race, but also a supreme treasure for cultivators. If they had truly found it, there's no way there wouldn't be any sign of it by now. Every True Dragon has methods to protect its remains after death. If it was extremely powerful in its prime, some of those protections might still remain. It wouldn't be so easy for outsiders to take the entire corpse. You'll see then, Brother Hei."</p><p>Unable to assist Nine Phoenix King, they began to plan their next steps.</p><p>Searching for treasure in the inner hall carried the risk of encountering human Nascent Soul cultivators.</p><p>Spirit Bead and the Demonic Lord went without saying.</p><p>The three Alliance Leaders, although not grand cultivators, were said to be peak mid-Nascent Soul experts, far surpassing cultivators of the same level. The fact that both righteous and demonic cultivators feared them spoke volumes.</p><p>Compared to the humans, only the Dragon King among the Demon Kings was at the late Transformation stage, their strength far inferior to the humans'.</p>
