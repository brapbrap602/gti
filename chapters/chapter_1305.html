<h1>Chapter 1297: Yu City</h1><p>Chapter 1297: Yu City</p><p>Daoist Zhenyi turned to Qing Jun, shaking his head.  "I know nothing of these matters.  I only received this intelligence less than a cup of tea's time ago, upon your arrival."</p><p>Everyone looked at each other in bewilderment.</p><p>"Let's assume the report is true, and not a trap.  Ye Laomo is cunning and treacherous; he wouldn't do this without reason. Has anyone here recently clashed with Ye Laomo and noticed anything unusual?"</p><p>Lord Tongyou stood up and looked around at the assembled cultivators.</p><p>Everyone shook their heads.</p><p>Then, a Yuan Ying cultivator from the Tianxing League stepped forward and said solemnly, "If we're talking about recent major events, it must be the Blood Lake battle. Don't forget, Ye Laomo lost a manifestation at Blood Lake, but obtained a jade bone! I recall you mentioned that Ye Laomo personally took the jade bone away."</p><p>"You mean, Ye Laomo was affected by the jade bone...?"</p><p>Only this could explain Ye Laomo's sudden change in behavior.</p><p>Lord Tongyou was startled and turned to Qing Jun.</p><p>Among those present, only Qing Jun had been in close contact with the jade bone.</p><p>Qing Jun understood their implication.  Her expression was calm and composed as she said, "The consciousness within the jade bone must have perished. If any remnant soul remained, it wouldn't have escaped my detection!  Don't overestimate ancient cultivators, nor underestimate Ye Laomo.  He wouldn't be so unprepared. Even if that person is alive, they're nothing more than a dying ghost.  Possessing or manipulating Ye Laomo would be almost impossible."</p><p>Qin Sang was surprised by Qing Jun's words, admiring his senior sister's boldness and disdain for ancient cultivators.</p><p>He then thought, "My senior sister is adept at puppetry and her spiritual sense is strong; she surely possesses unique soul-related techniques, giving her the confidence to say such things."</p><p>The group continued to speculate from other angles.  "Could it be that Ye Laomo has unlocked the secret of the jade bone, obtaining some secret technique or treasure, and wants to keep it all for himself?"</p><p>At this moment, Madam Luo suddenly spoke, her voice tinged with a seductive quality.  Lazily, she said, "Why do you all assume Ye Laomo actively betrayed us? Why not consider the opposite? Ye Laomo has always been domineering and brutal, making countless enemies in the Abyss of Sin.  Those people were intimidated by his strength, so they didn't dare to act. But recently, he lost his blood demon manifestation and was injured by Daoist Zhenyi – isn't this the perfect opportunity to strike?"</p><p>For a time, various opinions flew about.</p><p>Daoist Zhenyi remained silent, listening to the discussion. After a while, he declared,  "In my opinion, even if there's a fifty percent chance it's a trap, it's worth the risk.  We can't miss this opportunity and sit idly by waiting for further information! A full-scale military operation would be too slow, but with our speed of movement, we might be able to reach Yu City before the chaos in the Abyss of Sin subsides!"</p><p>The Abyss of Sin is embroiled in internal strife, leaving them vulnerable. A coordinated attack by all Yuan Ying cultivators might stand a chance.</p><p>The Tianxing League naturally followed Daoist Zhenyi's lead.</p><p>The Yuan Ying cultivators from the Xiao Han Domain hesitated, but were also greatly tempted.</p><p>The benefits of conquering Yu City were self-evident.</p><p>"This is indeed a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity! Saint Jun, Daoist Leng, and Daoist Qin are all here. As long as we are vigilant enough, even if something strange happens, we can retreat safely. Whether the news is true or false will be revealed once we reach Yu City," Xiang Qing spoke persuasively, confident in the Xiao Han Domain's strength.</p><p>Qin Sang and Qing Jun exchanged a glance.</p><p>Whether to attack or not was uncertain for Qin Sang.</p><p>After this battle, he would have essentially accomplished his goals. He harbored no deep hatred for the Abyss of Sin and no urgent desire to destroy it.</p><p>However, if Yu City could be conquered, forcing negotiations with the Abyss of Sin, the benefits would be clear.</p><p>He needed precious materials for refining a new flying sword to replace his ebony sword and acquiring the South Ming Li Fire treasure, and he might be able to obtain them from the Abyss of Sin.</p><p>Qing Jun nodded slightly, and upon seeing this, Qin Sang also voiced his agreement with the plan.</p><p>The group quickly reached a consensus.</p><p>"Good!"</p><p>Daoist Zhenyi stood up abruptly, a fierce glint in his eyes. "Since you all agree, let's set off for Yu City immediately. However, before we leave this hall, I must make it clear:  Once we leave this chamber, no one is allowed to leave each other's sight, or I will not hesitate to turn on you!"</p><p>The cultivators were shocked, and responded in agreement, unwilling to risk having their movements betrayed by a spy.</p><p>The Yuan Ying cultivators left Caishi City silently, undetected by the army within.</p><p>In the wilderness.</p><p>Under the cover of Daoist Zhenyi's concealment treasure, they headed straight for Yu City.</p><p>As they approached the Abyss, the plains gradually changed, giving way to low hills.  At first scattered, these hills eventually formed a continuous mountain range, the peaks growing increasingly high and treacherous.</p><p>Throughout the journey, Tian Mudie remained vigilant, and Qing Jun used secret arts to scout ahead, finding nothing unusual.</p><p>Halfway there, Tong You Mojun paused, suddenly ordering a change of course.  Shortly after, he signaled a stop, materializing in mid-air above a patch of grass.  He looked down and shouted, "Come out!"</p><p>"Saint Lord!"</p><p>A surprised voice answered from the grass, and a cultivator emerged—a Golden Core cultivator.  He wore a Daoist robe embroidered with unique cloud patterns, and a similar jade pendant hung from his waist, identifying him as a disciple of the Abyss's Han Yun Sect. However, his demeanor towards Tong You Mojun was clearly suspicious.</p><p>"Why are you here, not in Yu City?"</p><p>Tong You Mojun's voice was stern, his question carrying an unspoken threat.</p><p>The Golden Core cultivator's heart pounded.  He dared not withhold anything, quickly explaining, "Saint Lord, a conflict erupted among the Yuan Ying cultivators in Yu City.  The city is in chaos and under lockdown. I escaped before the city was sealed and came to report to you..."</p><p>This matched the information Daoist He Zhen had received!</p><p>The Yuan Ying cultivators exchanged glances and pressed for details.</p><p>Seeing so many Yuan Ying masters, the Golden Core cultivator, terrified, revealed everything he knew. He had slipped out of the city, successfully delivering the news, though he didn't understand the cause of the conflict.</p><p>"You were clever, well done,"</p><p>Tong You Mojun commended him, then took him along, resuming their journey.</p><p>...</p><p>"Yu City is not far ahead,"</p><p>On a mountaintop, several figures appeared—Qin Sang and his group. They had bypassed the Abyss's outposts and silently infiltrated the area, nearing Yu City.</p><p>Before them, the ground was crisscrossed with thin, winding cracks, many also visible in the mountains themselves. This was the northernmost edge of the Heavenly Scar.</p><p>However, these cracks appeared ordinary; no ancient prohibitions or hidden realms were present.  Their previous assumption was that the Abyssal Ruins' impact upon the Abyss created the Heavenly Scar, and the aftershocks reached here, causing this phenomenon.</p><p>"They'll surely have defenses here.  A silent approach to Yu City is nearly impossible. We should charge in, catch them off guard, and storm Yu City!"</p><p>Someone suggested.</p>
