<h1></h1><p>Hearing Qin Sang's words, Tong Lingyu was silent for a moment, then said solemnly, "The Heavenly Mountain lineage is powerful and has always been restless. There has long been a discourse that they should not only enjoy the resources and authority of a main lineage. Several internal conflicts in the Profound Heaven Palace have been fueled by them. They reaped many benefits when the Eight Lineages declined, which is why they are so prosperous now."</p><p>It seemed that Tong Lingyu was preparing to target the Heavenly Mountain lineage.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded thoughtfully and asked, "What do you plan to do, Fellow Daoist?"</p><p>"The Heavenly Mountain lineage has many factions, but they are only limited internally and have always been united against outsiders. Shang Lu's scheme may not have gone unnoticed by others. Even if they didn't secretly assist, they acquiesced. The Heavenly Mountain lineage is ambitious and difficult to control. Fellow Daoist Luo and I are currently in a weakened state. If we continue to tolerate them, they will surely become a malignant tumor in the sect. The mastermind goes without saying, but the others cannot escape responsibility. The death penalty can be avoided, but they won't escape a living punishment. After clarifying their merits and faults, they will be dealt with separately..."</p><p>Tong Lingyu obviously had a plan in mind, having thought it through carefully.</p><p>If demons like Mixing Demon and Heavenly Peng hadn't been suppressed by the Exquisite Pagoda, this would be the most difficult time for the Profound Heaven Palace.</p><p>Beset by internal and external troubles, even if Tong Lingyu had such thoughts, she could only bury them in her heart, doing her best to unite the various lineages of the sect to resist foreign enemies. It would be difficult to make a bold decision and to freely clear out the internal stubborn diseases.</p><p>If it triggered internal strife, the demons would certainly take advantage of it.</p><p>Now, the top experts among the demons had been wiped out.</p><p>The demon race was preoccupied with its own survival.</p><p>Although the Nine-Headed Great Sage was the only late-stage Core Formation expert in the North Sea, the other demon kings had suffered heavy casualties and had to worry about the human race uniting and taking advantage of their weakness. How could they dare to actively provoke the Profound Heaven Palace?</p><p>The demonic forces of the Boundless Sea were no better off. Now, it could be said that the sky was clear, and the jade firmament was bright.</p><p>There were no immediate threats outside the Profound Heaven Palace. It was a good opportunity to use Yin Changsheng's demonic transformation as a pretext to cleanse the interior and scrape the poison from the bones.</p><p>However, Tong Lingyu's prestige was not as great as Yin Changsheng's, and she had lost her spiritual treasure. It was feared that it would be difficult to completely subdue all parties, and her hands and feet were tied.</p><p>Tong Lingyu knew that Qin Sang was a strong ally. By uniting with this person, all problems would be solved. Although this person's temperament was not that of a demonic cultivator, she was very wary of him.</p><p>She spared no effort to save Luo Yun, firstly because of their many years of friendship, and secondly, so that she could resist Qin Sang in the future.</p><p>Tong Lingyu had not had much contact with Qin Sang and did not dare to say that she understood Qin Sang's temperament. It was only natural to be wary of others.</p><p>She had just been saved by Qin Sang, so she couldn't burn the bridge after crossing the river. Besides, she really didn't want to be enemies with Qin Sang.</p><p>The 'temptation' of the position of the Grand Elder just now was a kind of test.</p><p>Qin Sang's firm refusal, although it could not be confirmed whether it was a true thought or a disguise, Tong Lingyu could be slightly relieved.</p><p>At present, the two of them had a tacit understanding and decided to divide the Heavenly Mountain, striking it down to a branch lineage!</p><p>Qin Sang was very satisfied. When the Heavenly Mountain was divided, he would definitely return with a full load.</p><p>"What about the Profound Heaven lineage?" Qin Sang asked again.</p><p>"The Profound Heaven lineage is mainly composed of the Yin family and the Luo family. After years of intermarriage, the two great families are indistinguishable. Yin Changsheng's power was unmatched, and he controlled the Profound Heaven lineage for many years. No one disobeyed him."</p><p>As she spoke, Tong Lingyu glanced at Qin Sang. Yin Changsheng and Palace Master Yin had both fallen at Qin Sang's hands.</p><p>"I will first find the Luo family and bring Fellow Daoist Luo to them, explaining the cause and effect. If there are any stubborn people, I will have to trouble Fellow Daoist Qin to take action. Considering Yin Changsheng's merits and faults, his descendants will be demoted from the main lineage, for future observation..."</p><p>Tong Lingyu planned to weaken the Profound Heaven lineage but also wanted to retain the Profound Heaven lineage's status as the main lineage.</p><p>In the future, the Profound Heaven Palace would be a three-legged power, so as to avoid a direct conflict with Qin Sang over sect affairs before she broke through to the late Nascent Soul stage.</p><p>Qin Sang rarely participated in power struggles, but that didn't mean he was dull. He was well aware of Tong Lingyu's thoughts.</p><p>He was wholeheartedly pursuing the Dao and had no ambition to control the Profound Heaven Palace. He didn't care about Tong Lingyu's attitude.</p><p>As long as he could get what he wanted.</p><p>Qin Sang tapped his finger lightly on the table and said, "I'm not talented, but a few decades ago, I established a sect called the Green Goat Temple. It's a small sect, not comparable to the Profound Heaven Palace."</p><p>Qin Sang spoke of the Green Goat Temple and his own origins.</p><p>Tong Lingyu was not surprised to learn that Qin Sang came from the Northern Star Realm. Otherwise, why would such a figure be unknown in the North Sea?</p><p>Tong Lingyu frowned slightly, "What do you mean, Fellow Daoist...?"</p><p>"I want to find a place in the Boundless Sea and leave a legacy in the North Sea as well. I hope Fellow Daoist and the Profound Heaven Palace will take care of it."</p><p>Qin Sang said calmly.</p><p>Compared with the North Sea, the Northern Star Realm seemed too crowded.</p><p>The ancient secret realms such as the Purple Micro Palace and the Sin God Palace no longer existed, and the Northern Star Realm had lost its greatest advantage.</p><p>A group of demonic leaders were suppressed, and the North Sea's demonic path was extremely weak. The Boundless Sea was empty, making it the best time to seize territory.</p><p>He personally took action and, without any effort, could snatch a superior island as the sect's mountain gate.</p><p>Qin Sang planned to borrow the Space-Rending Shuttle from Liuli and relocate some disciples.</p><p>The Northern Star Realm was the place where the dragon rose, and it could not be completely abandoned.</p><p>When he had time, Qin Sang was prepared to spend some time trying to find the path of the storm belt, so as to avoid the Green Goat Temple being divided into two places.</p><p>He had the Moon-Gazing Rhinoceros Horn and was not afraid of getting lost. The danger was not great.</p><p>However, Qin Sang mentioned this to Tong Lingyu not only to foster good relations between the Green Goat Temple and the Profound Heaven Palace.</p><p>The sacred land of the Profound Heaven Palace lived up to its name, and there were many precious places where low-level cultivators could obtain great benefits.</p><p>If some disciples of the Green Goat Temple could be sent in, the experts in the Green Goat Temple would emerge in an endless stream and prosper for a long time!</p><p>The Green Goat Temple only had him, a Nascent Soul cultivator. Qin Sang was not greedy and did not covet the treasures and opportunities above the Nascent Soul stage. He only asked for a few places similar to the Ice Wind Cave.</p><p>The Heavenly Mountain lineage no longer existed, so there would definitely be a lot of vacancies.</p><p>Tong Lingyu looked solemn, as if she was carefully considering this matter, but in fact, she was secretly relieved. As long as Qin Sang did not let the Green Goat Temple replace the Heavenly Mountain and become the main lineage, everything would be fine.</p><p>She could feel that Qin Sang was very restrained in his actions, and she gradually began to believe that his wholehearted pursuit of the Dao was not a disguise.</p><p>The location of the sacred land had already been leaked. Sharing some benefits with the Green Goat Temple and befriending Qin Sang, Tong Lingyu was still willing to do so.</p><p>"There is no precedent for such a thing, but I will do my best!"</p><p>Tong Lingyu promised in a deep voice.</p><p>"I will also do my best to assist Fellow Daoist," Qin Sang nodded with a smile.</p><p>His actions seemed a little urgent, and he took the initiative to give up a lot.</p><p>If he was given more time to digest the gains from this sacred land trip, his strength would skyrocket. He only needed to operate in the Profound Heaven Palace for a while, and he would be able to obtain more benefits for the Listening Snow Pavilion and the Green Goat Temple. Tong Lingyu would not be able to stop him.</p><p>However, Qin Sang just didn't have time.</p><p>He had already decided that, if possible, he would set off for the Central Province as soon as possible, the sooner the better!</p><p>After leaving the sacred land, Qin Sang had time to carefully browse the remaining contents of the jade slip.</p><p>There were many of Xiaoxiang Zi's experiences in the Central Province, which made Qin Sang yearn for it more and more.</p><p>According to Xiaoxiang Zi's description, the Central Province gathered thousands of spiritual essences and was the core of this realm!</p><p>Times had changed, and most of Xiaoxiang Zi's records could only be regarded as anecdotes.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Qin Sang saw a record at the end that made his heart beat faster.</p><p>When Xiaoxiang Zi was traveling in the Central Province, he accidentally discovered a Buddha bone relic of a Buddhist eminent monk.</p><p>The monk's descendant thought it was just an ordinary relic, but Xiaoxiang Zi saw that the Buddha bone relic contained a hidden mystery, which might help Nascent Soul cultivators break through!</p><p>The relic was useless to Xiaoxiang Zi, so he did not take it without authorization and recorded it as a strange story.</p><p>If no one else had discovered the mystery in it, the Buddha bone relic might still be there!</p><p>This was the first opportunity Qin Sang had encountered to break through to the late Nascent Soul stage, and it was worth a trip.</p><p>The problem was that it was not easy to travel from the North Sea to the Central Province.</p><p>The journey to the Central Province was long, and the shelters were not connected in a straight line. The route was tortuous and many times the straight-line distance.</p><p>Even with the sea chart in hand, there were many dangers along the way, and it took a long time to travel. Only late Nascent Soul cultivators had a greater chance of success.</p><p>If he could break through to the late Nascent Soul stage himself, would he need to go to great lengths to find the Buddha bone relic?</p><p>There was another way, to use external forces.</p><p>Cultivators were good at using magical treasures, and Qin Sang immediately thought of Liuli's Space-Rending Shuttle.</p><p>Qin Sang could see that the Space-Rending Shuttle had an extraordinary origin. He wondered where Bing Yao had obtained it. Even if Qin Sang had the intention to imitate it and spent a lot of effort and time refining a similar magical treasure, he could not combine various powers and compare with it.</p><p>Qin Sang was prepared to borrow the Space-Rending Shuttle first, to confirm whether this treasure could help him pass through the storm belt and reach the Central Province, and then discuss it with Liuli.</p><p>This treasure was given by her master, and Liuli was probably unwilling to trade it.</p><p>If she could be persuaded to go to the Central Province together, the two of them could help each other in a foreign land.</p><p>The sea changed into mulberry fields. No one knew where the Buddha bone relic was now. Naturally, the sooner he set off, the better. At that time, he could cultivate while searching.</p><p>Barring accidents, he should not stay in the North Sea for too long and could not always stay in the Green Goat Temple.</p><p>Before leaving, leaving some legacy for the Green Goat Temple was the only thing he could do.</p><p>Therefore, Qin Sang stopped at the right point, both seeking benefits and not letting the Profound Heaven Palace have any grudges against the Green Goat Temple.</p><p>The road to the Central Province was unpredictable, and he didn't know when he would return. He paved the way for the Green Goat Temple, and how far it could go in the future would depend on the abilities and luck of future generations.</p><p>Tong Lingyu felt the goodwill released by Qin Sang, and her mind relaxed. She discussed the details with Qin Sang.</p><p>After the discussion was settled, Tong Lingyu got up and left, leaving this cave dwelling to Qin Sang, so that he could take the time to recuperate.</p><p>When the group recovered their full strength and returned to the Profound Heaven Palace, they would inevitably have to take action.</p><p>After sending Tong Lingyu away, Qin Sang sealed the cave dwelling, sat cross-legged for a while, and then remembered to sort out his gains this time.</p><p>This time, being dragged into the underground cave by Yin Changsheng was the biggest crisis he had encountered since he formed his Nascent Soul.</p><p>Fortunately, he won in the end, and the harvest of this trip was far beyond imagination!</p><p>The Four-Multiplied Serpent Seal had been given to Liuli. When she comprehended the Tongbao Technique, she could master a real spiritual treasure!</p><p>Thinking of this, Qin Sang glanced at the external incarnation sitting cross-legged beside him. He didn't expect that the incarnation would have a spiritual treasure before the main body.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang's eyes closed slightly, and his mind sank into his sea of Qi, seeing the Earth Slaughter Sword.</p><p>After fusing the two fragments, the Earth Slaughter Sword had not changed, and the sword spirit did not respond.</p><p>Qin Sang separated a wisp of divine sense and touched the Earth Slaughter Sword. After trying for a long time without success, he had to give up.</p><p>He sighed inwardly. Now that he had collected four fragments of the Earth Slaughter Sword, the sword spirit's recovery speed should be faster than before. He just didn't know when it would wake up.</p><p>This cultivation technique was obviously related to the Earth Slaughter Sword. The sword spirit should understand the cultivation technique, right?</p><p>Qin Sang thought of the amnesiac Bai and was a little uncertain.</p><p>He couldn't put his hope on one person. This was Qin Sang's experience.</p><p>Xiaoxiang Zi probably didn't know about the existence of the cultivation technique. Otherwise, why didn't he mention it?</p><p>The cultivation technique that Qin Sang saw at the bottom of the Nether Valley was engraved on the side with sword energy.</p><p>The sword energy formed a terrifying storm, which lasted for years and shrouded the cultivation technique. Qing Zhu helped open the way to see it.</p><p>Barring accidents, the other parts of the cultivation technique should also be near the fragments.</p><p>Qin Sang suspected that Xiaoxiang Zi might not be the first person to come into contact with the fragments.</p><p>On this trip to the Central Province, there were several things that needed to be done.</p><p>One was for the Buddha bone relic.</p><p>The second was to collect information about the Heavenly Harmony and Heavenly Appearance halls. If the sword energy storm had not dissipated, he could obtain the cultivation technique from the original place.</p><p>The third was to start with Xiaoxiang Zi's experience and investigate the person who took out the fragments of the Earth Slaughter Sword.</p><p>The fourth was to search for a sea chart leading to the Boundless Sea in the Central Province.</p><p>And the fifth was to find the Ghost Mother.</p><p>The Central Province was extremely vast, and each thing was not easy to accomplish, like looking for a needle in a haystack, and it could not be accomplished overnight.</p><p>According to his experience, ancient secret realms could not be opened at any time. If he missed one, he didn't know how many hundreds of years he would have to wait. This was the reason why Qin Sang was eager to set off.</p><p>There were also many hidden worries.</p><p>The Seven Killing Palace and the Purple Micro Palace were connected, opening and closing at the same time.</p><p>What kind of impact would the ascension of the Purple Micro Palace have on the Seven Killing Palace?</p><p>What about the Heavenly Harmony Hall and the Heavenly Appearance Hall?</p><p>Were there similar halls in this realm?</p><p>Would they... also ascend?</p><p>There were too many things to be sure of.</p><p>He was alone. After settling the Green Goat Temple, there was nothing to miss in the North Sea. It was the same wherever he cultivated.</p><p>Putting away the miscellaneous thoughts, Qin Sang silently circulated his profound technique, immersed himself in meditation, and experienced the effect of the Cleansing Pond.</p><p>His current cultivation speed surpassed that of a dual-spirit root, and it was not slow.</p><p>The moment he circulated the cultivation technique, the spiritual energy around Qin Sang fluctuated for a while, and was quickly swallowed and refined by Qin Sang. The cultivation speed was significantly improved compared to before.</p><p>Qin Sang circulated it ninety-nine-eighty-one times in one breath, and his heart moved. He woke up from meditation, with a look of joy on his face.</p><p>"Even a heavenly spirit root is nothing more than this!"</p><p>Qin Sang sighed repeatedly.</p><p>The effect of the Cleansing Pond was excellent, and Qin Sang had undergone a transformation.</p><p>He wondered if there were other benefits besides the cultivation speed?</p><p>He couldn't feel any other changes for the time being, and he would experience them slowly in the future.</p><p>Thinking of the gap between the five-spirit root and the heavenly spirit root, Qin Sang felt sad. It was really infuriating to compare people.</p><p>Stopping his cultivation, Qin Sang remembered another gain, two Spirit Calming Incenses.</p><p>This treasure was not beneficial to his cultivation, but it was a treasure that other cultivators dreamed of, and even great cultivators would be tempted. It was the best bargaining chip.</p><p>He would see if the Profound Heaven Palace had any treasures worthy of his Spirit Calming Incense. Otherwise, he would take it to the Central Province.</p><p>The cultivators of the Central Province probably couldn't resist it, and it might come in handy.</p><p>Thinking of this, Qin Sang took out a jade box he had refined to store treasures and carefully put it away.</p><p>In addition, Xiaoxiang Zi also left the refining method of the Spirit Calming Incense on the jade slip.</p><p>Spirit Calming Incense was different from ordinary medicinal pills. The refining was not difficult, and it could be completed even without a master alchemist. But the spiritual herbs it required, both in quantity and grade, were too amazing, and ordinary people could not collect them at all.</p><p>Qin Sang could only take out the Myriad Spirit Fruit now.</p><p>He would pay attention to collecting the spiritual herbs needed for Spirit Calming Incense in the future, but he really had no confidence that he could collect them all.</p>
