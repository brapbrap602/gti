<h1>Chapter 1201: The Sharp Gold Scripture</h1><p>Chapter 1201: The Sharp Gold Scripture</p><p>Qin Sang left the Tian Shi Sect branch temple, taking Fat Chicken with him, and flew out of the Tian Hen.</p><p>He arrived at a secluded place, unfolded the geomantic map given to him by his senior sister Qing Jun, and finally confirmed the location marked where the sacrificial altar's black energy manifested.</p><p>"So it's here!"</p><p>The marked location, which Qin Sang suspected was the Tian Shi Sect's main temple, was located deep within the Tian Hen, difficult for ordinary people to reach.</p><p>And nearby was a forbidden zone, the Abyssal Pit!</p><p>That place, known as Yuanxu, was where the entrance to the Sinful God Palace lay.</p><p>Xiao Han Domain and the Tian Xing Alliance had limited knowledge of Yuanxu. Qin Sang only knew that Yuanxu contained more than just the Sinful God Palace, but the entire Yuanxu only had one entrance.</p><p>The Sinful God Palace was discovered later in Yuanxu by Abyssal cultivators. It was undoubtedly the most important sanctuary, perhaps even the core of Yuanxu.</p><p>To enter the Sinful God Palace, one must first enter Yuanxu!</p><p>Of course, there was still a long distance between the Tian Shi Sect's main temple and the Yuanxu entrance; otherwise, Qin Sang would have had to consider whether to go.</p><p>Qin Sang looked at the geomantic map and thought to himself that the Tian Shi Sect was indeed bold.</p><p>The major forces in the Abyssal Pit certainly kept a close watch on the Yuanxu entrance. If the Tian Shi Sect made a mistake and exposed the location of its main temple, it would inevitably invite disaster.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered, "Senior Sister Qing Jun once attempted to spy on Yuanxu and the Sinful God Palace, and ascertained the defensive forces near the Sinful God Palace. The main temple was not within the range of vigilance. However, the Tian Shi Sect actually hid its main temple so close to the forbidden zone. It seems that the important branch temples with altars are all hidden deep within the Tian Hen. So secretive, no wonder almost no information can be found outside."</p><p>Continuing south from the Nan Yin Mountains would lead to the southernmost end of the Tian Hen, the most desolate and barren place.</p><p>But the marked location was still north of Jin Hen Mountain. Qin Sang needed to return the way he came, and after crossing Jin Hen Mountain, because he couldn't use his escape techniques recklessly, it would probably take another day's journey.</p><p>Qin Sang put away the geomantic map and quietly flew north, passing Jin Hen Mountain, and arriving at his destination.</p><p>The Tian Hen was a thousand miles wide here. Qin Sang was back on the east side of the Tian Hen. Standing at the edge of the Tian Hen and looking west, even with the eyesight of the Heaven's Eye Butterfly, he couldn't see the other side.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced north; the Yuanxu entrance was still to the north.</p><p>The defenses were tight there, but the area where Qin Sang was located was much more relaxed. The patrolling forces were not much stronger than those in Jin Hen Mountain and other areas, making it easy to sneak in.</p><p>After a brief pause, Qin Sang leaped into the Tian Hen.</p><p>The scenery in the upper layers of the Tian Hen was much the same, the only difference being the danger level.</p><p>Of course, this level of danger didn't affect Qin Sang. He strolled leisurely within the Tian Hen, quickly descending, brushing past fragments of ancient prohibitions without causing any disturbance.</p><p>The dim Tian Hen seemed unusually mysterious. Unknowingly, Qin Sang had traversed more than half the distance. The deeper he went, the more dangers he encountered. Qin Sang's expression became slightly more serious. His escape light was like a shadow, silent and invisible.</p><p>"We're here!"</p><p>Qin Sang appeared in a grove of trees. These plants were still alive, but entirely black, with a decaying aura. His gaze swept across, finally settling on a clearing at the edge of the grove.</p><p>The clearing contained only a few stones, very inconspicuous. This was the marked location. Although Qin Sang knew the method of opening it from the sacrificial altar's black mist, he did not act rashly. He first used his Heaven's Eye to observe and easily discovered something unusual.</p><p>"Even the Heaven's Eye Butterfly shouldn't be able to detect it so easily. Could it be because someone has been here before?"</p><p>At this time, Fat Chicken jumped out, eager to make a contribution and scout ahead.</p><p>Fat Chicken had wanted to do this last time, but Qin Sang, considering the Witch Clan's prohibitions, had refused.</p><p>"Alright, I'll set up a large formation outside for support. If anything unusual is found, come out immediately."</p><p>After a moment's thought, Qin Sang agreed.</p><p>He first activated the Heavenly Demon Transformation and summoned the Twelve Demon Banners, preparing himself. Then, he shot a stream of light towards the center of the clearing, and Fat Chicken standing there disappeared into thin air.</p><p>After a while, Fat Chicken flew out unharmed, "Master, there's no one inside."</p><p>As expected!</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, rolled up the Demon Banners, and entered the sanctuary.</p><p>Then, his feet went hollow, and Qin Sang found himself in mid-air. Below was a vast expanse of water!</p><p>Fat Chicken followed behind Qin Sang, "I flew around the perimeter just now. There's only this large hall floating in the middle; the rest is empty. Under the water, there's only one altar, directly below the hall."</p><p>Following Fat Chicken's indication, Qin Sang saw a black hall built on the water. He fell rapidly, landing before the hall's entrance.</p><p>The main hall door stood open. Qin Sang entered, seeing several empty shelves and tables—clearly someone had been here before.</p><p>He searched the area but found nothing.  Just as he was about to enter the water to look for the altar mentioned by Pang Ji, he stopped abruptly, his gaze fixed on the surface.</p><p>"Master, what's wrong?"</p><p>Pang Ji felt a chill run down his spine. He sensed nothing unusual; he'd even just been in the water himself.</p><p>"This isn't just water, or rather, it's more than just water.  A strange enchantment is interwoven within it. Without the Tianmu Butterfly, I might have missed it…"</p><p>Qin Sang scooped up some water, and immediately the power within it receded like a tide, detected by the Tianmu Butterfly.</p><p>"Strange…"</p><p>Qin Sang frowned. The enchantment was subtly woven into the water, yet didn't seem to affect anyone inside it. He'd never encountered anything like it.</p><p>He cautiously entered the water.  A circular altar, similar to the previous one but far larger and with far more complex carvings, was there.</p><p>"As I suspected, this is likely the main headquarters of the Tian Shi Sect!"</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, moving through the water to the altar. His expression changed; he snatched at something in the water, retrieving a strand of gold thinner than a needle.</p><p>Sensing the energy emanating from the golden thread, Qin Sang's face lit up.  "Sharp Gold Qi!  It's from the *Sharp Gold Scripture*!"</p><p>The *Sharp Gold Scripture* was Tan Hao's main cultivation technique after he achieved the Nascent Soul stage!</p><p>He retrieved several more strands of Sharp Gold Qi.</p><p>"My previous suspicions are largely confirmed. Tan Hao was here. He used his powers in the water, and the lingering aura hasn't dissipated, it's being contained by the water's enchantment."</p><p>Qin Sang looked at the altar. His knowledge of the Tian Shi Sect was limited, so he tried to forcefully infuse it with his spiritual energy to activate it.</p><p>But the altar remained unresponsive, no matter what he did.</p><p>After a while, Qin Sang emerged from the water. He had some ideas, but needed to verify them.</p><p>He ordered Pang Ji to guard the entrance, to prevent them from being trapped inside unknowingly. Then, sitting before the hall, he merged his mind with the Tianmu Butterfly, intently focusing on the water, analyzing the enchantment.</p><p>The enchantment was vast. Starting from where he'd found the Sharp Gold Qi, he gradually discerned its nature.</p><p>"This is a seal, but water is formless.  Where exactly is the mysterious person sealed? The altar...it might be a channel used by the Tian Shi Sect to communicate with the mysterious person…"</p>
