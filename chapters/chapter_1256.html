<h1>Chapter 1248: The Traitor</h1><p>"Fellow Daoist, are you injured?"</p><p>Qin Sang noticed that Si Di's complexion was somewhat pale, and his heart grew tense.</p><p>Had the two sides already clashed, engaging in a fierce battle?</p><p>Si Di touched his shoulder and said, "I got separated from the others, but it wasn’t the Sin Abyss. Instead, I encountered a group of Blood Wraiths. I was carelessly scratched by one, and the yin evil energy invaded my body. I just took a spirit pill, so I’m fine now."</p><p>"A group of Blood Wraiths?"</p><p>Qin Sang was surprised. "Were the other fellow Daoists also scattered?"</p><p>Si Di nodded. "It happened too suddenly. We were dealing with a troublesome restriction when, for some reason, we disturbed them. Suddenly, countless Blood Wraiths pounced on us. At first, we didn’t realize that the Blood Wraiths were indestructible, and we were caught off guard, suffering heavy losses. Once our formation was broken, we were scattered by the Blood Wraiths. We decided to flee separately and regroup at the agreed location once we escaped. I had to fend off the pursuing Blood Wraiths for a long time before I finally shook them off and found a place to heal."</p><p>After a brief discussion, the two decided to proceed together.</p><p>Along the way, Qin Sang frequently summoned his plump chicken. Although Si Di was curious, seeing that Qin Sang was unwilling to explain, he didn’t press further.</p><p>...</p><p>At the center of the basin.</p><p>This was where the blood mist was the thickest, dense as blood itself. Within the mist stood two massive blood-red gates!</p><p>The surfaces of the gates were covered in countless mysterious and arcane runes.</p><p>However, the gates were now pockmarked, with cracks and gaps. Through the fissures in the gates, one could vaguely see the scenery inside.</p><p>Towers stood tall, exuding a sinister aura.</p><p>Though there were signs of collapse and decay, compared to other places, it was relatively well-preserved.</p><p>In front of the gates, a clearing had been made, where several figures sat cross-legged. They were all cultivators from the Sin Abyss, and there was no sign of Qing Jun or the others.</p><p>Everyone faced the gates, arranged in a fan-shaped formation.</p><p>At the forefront were two individuals.</p><p>One wore a blood-red cloak, his face withered and aged. This was the infamous Demon Lord Ye, whose name was known throughout the Northern Star Realm and who was hailed as the strongest cultivator of the current era!</p><p>Beside him was a white-haired elder with an immortal aura, the sect master of the Sin Abyss’s Star Constancy Sect, Daoist Tianzheng. His cultivation was only slightly inferior to Demon Lord Ye’s.</p><p>Led by these two, the group jointly attacked the blood gates. Their attacks poured out like flowing water, causing the gates to tremble repeatedly.</p><p>"Those fellows from the Two Domains Alliance must have run into the Blood Wraiths, right? Demon Lord Ye’s blood path divine abilities are truly extraordinary. With just a Blood Demon avatar, he managed to lure away the Blood Wraiths. Not only did these Blood Wraiths not become a problem, but they also helped us execute a strategy of driving the tiger to devour the wolf, effortlessly blocking our opponents."</p><p>A Nascent Soul cultivator paused to catch his breath, then turned his head to look deep into the blood mist, smirking darkly.</p><p>This man, known as the Threaded Silk Daoist, wore a spider-patterned robe. His eyes were sinister, and his lips were an unnatural bluish-purple, marking him as a demonic cultivator.</p><p>"Threaded Silk Daoist, you make it sound easy. Demon Lord Ye’s Blood Demon avatar has cultivation comparable to his true body. Not just anyone can possess such a powerful avatar. Only something this strong could quietly lure away so many Blood Wraiths."</p><p>Beside him, a black-robed elder, also a demonic cultivator, spoke up, lavishing praise on Demon Lord Ye.</p><p>The Sin Abyss was not a monolithic entity. Like the Small Cold Domain, it had its own conflicts between righteousness and evil, though these tensions were overshadowed by more pressing matters.</p><p>A righteous cultivator nearby, uncomfortable with the conversation, interjected, "Don’t celebrate too soon. The Two Domains Alliance has no shortage of experts. It’s uncertain how long those Blood Wraiths can hold them off. These blood gates are difficult to break. Fellow Daoists, you should focus on assisting Daoist Tianzheng and Demon Lord Ye in breaking through the gates."</p><p>The two who had spoken earlier exchanged glances, their expressions displeased, but they didn’t argue. Instead, they began whispering among themselves.</p><p>"Last time at the Sin God Palace, we broke through layer after layer of ancient restrictions and found that demon imprisoned there. That demon had been tortured to the point of being unrecognizable. We exerted too much force, and in the end, we only managed to extract some fragmented memories from its remnant soul. Yet, even that brought us immense benefits, leaving other forces unable to lift their heads. I wonder how much we’ll gain this time!"</p><p>The Threaded Silk Daoist was filled with anticipation, almost unable to contain himself.</p><p>The black-robed elder chuckled darkly, equally unable to hide his excitement. "According to that demon, the one imprisoned in this Blood Prison is a traitor from the Purple Micro Palace. They must know the Purple Micro Palace inside and out! Once we capture this person, the treasures within the Purple Micro Palace will be ours for the taking. What do the old ghosts of the Small Cold Domain and the Skywalk Alliance have to compete with us? We’ll cut them off at the root! It’s laughable that they think their years of managing the Purple Micro Palace will keep us out."</p><p>As he spoke, the black-robed elder raised his head, his gaze piercing through the cracks in the blood gates to look inside.</p><p>The Threaded Silk Daoist snorted. "The Purple Micro Palace is impressive, but in my opinion, aside from the cultivation techniques and secrets in his mind, this person’s memories of the ancient era are the most valuable. It would be best to extract from him the truth about why this world has become what it is. Is there a way to cross the endless storms and see the wider world beyond? That way, we won’t follow in the footsteps of countless predecessors, dying with regret. This time, we must be careful. It’s best to capture this person alive. We can’t repeat the mistake of last time, where we ended up with only a remnant soul and some fragmented memories."</p><p>"Threaded Silk Daoist, your ambitions are grand. But even if there is a path, how do we have the strength to cross the endless storms? How can we ensure we won’t get lost in them? Improving our own strength is the most urgent matter."</p><p>The black-robed elder fired off several questions in rapid succession, each hitting a sore spot.</p><p>The Threaded Silk Daoist’s expression darkened slightly.</p><p>Seeing this, the black-robed elder quickly changed his tone. "However, it’s still too early to discuss these matters. The power of the seal here is not comparable to the Sin God Palace. The Purple Micro Palace traitor imprisoned here has suffered less torment and suppression, so it’s unclear how much strength they have left. They likely won’t be as easy to deal with as that demon. Moreover, last time, nearly all of us were present, working together, which made things seem easy. This time, the Moonlight Demon King accidentally stumbled upon our plans, forcing us to split our forces. Fellow Daoist Cang Hong and the others are holding the Skywalk Plateau. With our forces divided, we must proceed with caution."</p><p>The Threaded Silk Daoist, having cultivated to this level, was not one to lose his temper over a few words.</p><p>Hearing the black-robed elder’s words, the Threaded Silk Daoist nodded slightly, agreeing with his cautious approach. However, his expression was not as grave. "The weaker the seal, the lower this person’s cultivation must be. This is no ordinary seal—it’s a place of punishment, just like the Sin God Palace! Since we discovered the Blood Lake and began monitoring it, we’ve noticed that every ten years, this person would cause a disturbance when the seal weakened. Each time, the disturbance grew fainter, until over a decade ago, it completely ceased. Demon Lord Ye waited for one more cycle to confirm that this person, like that demon, is also on the verge of exhaustion. That’s why he decided to act now."</p><p>The two were not the only ones whispering.</p><p>Others, seeing the cracks in the blood gates widening, were also murmuring among themselves.</p><p>Daoist Tianzheng overheard them and glanced at Demon Lord Ye. Seeing that Demon Lord Ye remained as still as an ancient pine, his expression unreadable, he chose to ignore the chatter and focus on breaking through the gates.</p><p>―</p><p>―</p><p>Yesterday, I intended to take a short nap after returning, but I ended up oversleeping. Fortunately, I woke up early.</p>
