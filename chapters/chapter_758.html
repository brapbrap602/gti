<h1>Chapter 750: Purple Star Eagle</h1><p>Chapter 750: Purple Star Eagle</p><p>Xiang Yi nodded and said, “Daoist Master, your observation is keen. This bone lotus has the ability to counteract poison, but under the erosion of intense toxins, it inevitably suffers. Once all the petals are infected, this treasure will also reach the end of its life and be unable to recover. However, fellow Daoists, you needn't worry. The bone lotus will last long enough for us to complete the task. It seems the Purple River Crocodile's cry didn't alarm the ferocious beasts in the Purple Mist Wasteland.  Time is of the essence, let's move…”</p><p>In the thick purple mist, visibility was severely hampered, and even their spiritual senses were eroded by the poisonous mist, preventing them from using them to scout.</p><p>In such an environment, everyone felt a strong sense of insecurity. No one spoke, they moved forward silently.</p><p>The sheer size of the Purple Mist Wasteland was unexpected. After traveling for a long time, the poisonous mist showed no sign of dissipating; instead, it was even deeper than when they first entered.</p><p>This indicated that Xiang Yi was leading them deeper into the Purple Mist Wasteland.</p><p>The forest became increasingly sparse, and the ground turned purple, creating a dreamlike scene.  However, Qin Sang and the others felt anything but relaxed.</p><p>Shortly after, the group noticed something unusual – Xiang Yi’s route was problematic, leading them in several circles.</p><p>“Daoist Friend Xiang, have you lost your way?”</p><p>The group looked at Xiang Yi suspiciously.</p><p>Xiang Yi signaled for silence, occasionally glancing around, listening intently. Then, a look of joy appeared on his face. He pointed forward. "Found it! Quickly! Don't let them escape!"</p><p>At this moment, everyone faintly heard some sounds, seeming to be beast roars, and quite a few of them.</p><p>Along the way, they had been avoiding the monsters here. Now, Xiang Yi was actively seeking trouble with them.</p><p>“These are small beasts called Purple Weasels. They’re the favorite food of the Purple Star Eagle…”</p><p>Xiang Yi quickened his pace, quickly explaining, “The direction we're going, there's a Purple Star Eagle's nest, a large group of them. The Purple Star Eagles are incredibly powerful; even if we work together, it would cost us dearly to get through.  But the Purple Weasels are much easier to deal with. We'll hunt the weasels, use their corpses to lure away the eagles, and we'll pass this obstacle without breaking a sweat.”</p><p>“The Merchant Guild’s preparations are indeed thorough.”</p><p>The Liu couple exclaimed in admiration.</p><p>Everyone's confidence grew, hoping to complete the task quickly and go about their own business.</p><p>Following the sound, the group quickly pursued.  Soon, they noticed the purple mist churning ahead, vaguely seeing a group of small beasts, about the size of a raccoon, jumping and running on the ground.</p><p>These small beasts looked similar to yellow weasels in appearance and size, but their fur was purple, and even their pupils were deep purple.</p><p>The Purple Weasels were extremely alert. Before the group got close, they noticed something amiss and stopped playing.</p><p>A group of Purple Weasels stood on their hind legs, staring with purple pupils, at their direction.  They made strange guttural noises, their eyes filled with unconcealed madness.</p><p>“Attack!”</p><p>Xiang Yi hissed, flicking his finger, shooting out a stream of light that transformed into a spiritual net, falling over them.</p><p>Qin Sang and the others were not to be outdone.</p><p>They cooperated seamlessly, unleashing their magical treasures to seal off all directions, giving the weasels no chance to escape.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>Qin Sang wielded his ebony sword, cutting through the purple mist. The sword glow surged several meters, becoming a roadblock for the weasels.</p><p>After entering the Purple Mist Wasteland, Qin Sang tried releasing the Flying Night Rakshasa. He found that although the Rakshasa's physical body was stronger than theirs and could withstand the mist somewhat better, it was still eroded by the purple mist and rapidly consumed its corpse energy.</p><p>It wasn’t useful here.</p><p>‘Poof poof poof…’</p><p>After being attacked, the weasels went berserk.</p><p>Deep purple smoke billowed from their bodies, filling the air, obscuring their figures.</p><p>This smoke not only contained the intense toxins of the Wasteland but also the weasels’ own supernatural abilities. If magical treasures were enveloped in the smoke for a long time, their spiritual essence would be greatly damaged.</p><p>It was similar to Blood-Soiling Divine Light, but much weaker.</p><p>When Xiang Yi warned them earlier, Cui Ji immediately recalled a twenty-year-old experience and subconsciously glanced at Qin Sang several times.</p><p>The group was prepared, so the smoke had little effect. The Purple Weasels were soon driven out by the descending spiritual net, squeaking in fright and fleeing in all directions.</p><p>As a result, they no longer posed a threat to Qin Sang and the others, and were all killed.</p><p>The group went forward to collect the weasels' corpses.</p><p>There were many weasels. Qin Sang openly collected some, and seeing this, others followed suit. Xiang Yi did not stop them.</p><p>With the Purple Weasel corpses, Xiang Yi led them back on track, heading straight to the depths of the Purple Mist Wasteland.</p><p>The jungle had changed drastically.  Ancient trees, taller than any they'd seen before, had mutated, their branches bristling with sharp thorns that glowed with a purple light, clearly venomous.  The branches swayed without a breeze, almost as if hunting, like sentient beings.</p><p>After a frantic dash, the group was forced to halt.</p><p>"What's this high cliff? Have we reached the end of the Purple Mist Wilderness?" someone asked, frowning.</p><p>A sheer cliff blocked their path, topped by an invisible barrier, and the threat from the high canopy was immense.</p><p>Xiang Yi remained calm. "We're still far from the end; this is just the outer edge.  The cliff means we're approaching the pass I mentioned.  Let's go right."</p><p>Moments later, they stopped before a canyon, holding their breath.  They looked up.</p><p>Above, a gale howled, obscuring the view. They could only make out shadowy shapes circling high above, flapping their wings, disturbing the purple mist, and emitting piercing cries.  They couldn't see the Purple Star Eagles clearly, but the sheer number of shadows sent shivers down their spines.</p><p>"Normally, Purple Star Eagles don't stray far from their nests.  Once we cross the canyon, we should be safe."</p><p>Xiang Yi backed away to a clear area, dropped the corpse of the purple weasel, set up several protective barriers, then led the group to the base of the cliff, shouting, "Explode!"</p><p>Two loud explosions rang out.  The purple weasel's corpse, still surprisingly intact, disintegrated, scattering bloody fragments everywhere.  A strong, pungent odor wafted towards the canyon.</p><p>The Purple Star Eagles, sensing the weasel's scent, went wild. A huge flock of dark shapes stirred the purple mist, scrambling to reach the source of the explosion.</p><p>"Go!"</p><p>Xiang Yi gestured sharply.  The group seized the opportunity and plunged into the canyon.</p><p>Most of the eagles were distracted by the scent, but some spotted them. With angry shrieks, they attacked relentlessly. Meanwhile, the eagles that had been fighting over the corpse were returning.  Trapped in the canyon, their situation was dire.</p><p>They summoned their magical weapons, enduring the eagles' attacks while pressing onward.  As they burst from the canyon, the eagles pursued.  Just as Xiang Yi predicted, after a brief chase, the eagles abandoned the pursuit and returned to their nests.</p>
