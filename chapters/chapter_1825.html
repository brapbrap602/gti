<h1>Chapter 1816: Awakening</h1><p>The monstrous ox opened its mouth, spewing a silver mist.  The mist, thick with demonic energy, emitted a foul stench and coalesced into a raging storm that hurtled towards Qin Sang.</p><p>Sensing the malevolent energy within the mist, Qin Sang’s thoughts stirred.  Instantly, three beams of lightning shot from his brow, transforming into divine talismans in mid-air.</p><p>Three talismans!</p><p>The Jade Purity Summoning Thunder Talisman.</p><p>The Flowing Gold Fire Bell Thunder Summoning Talisman.</p><p>And the Five Thunders Heavenly Heart Seal Talisman!</p><p>While the Jade Purity Summoning Thunder Talisman and the Flowing Gold Fire Bell Thunder Summoning Talisman were based on low-level and intermediate-level spells, their ability to become spells was undoubtedly the result of the painstaking efforts of Daoist ancestors. They possessed endless mysteries and couldn't be considered ordinary talismans.</p><p>As a cultivator's power grew, so did the talismans' power. They remained potent personal abilities, easily summoned and controlled.</p><p>More importantly, these talismans were interconnected.  Understanding one allowed for their fusion, empowered by the cultivator’s energy.</p><p>Therefore, Qin Sang’s mastery of the Five Thunders Heavenly Heart Seal Talisman was not the end.  The ultimate Five Thunder Seal would only be achieved by merging all three talismans into one unified force.</p><p>He could currently merge the Jade Purity Summoning Thunder Talisman and the Flowing Gold Fire Bell Thunder Summoning Talisman, but comprehending the Five Thunders Heavenly Heart Seal Talisman required reaching the Void Refinement stage; merging all three remained a distant prospect.</p><p>However, using two talismans consecutively, followed by the Five Thunders Heavenly Heart Seal Talisman, still amplified the power of the thunder.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>Lightning spontaneously appeared.</p><p>The battlefield was instantly illuminated, as countless thunder serpents danced across the night sky, unleashing a torrent of lightning.</p><p>It wasn’t just lightning that fell; it was accompanied by balls of thunder fire.</p><p>Thunder fire filled the heavens, staining the sky as if a celestial being had overturned an alchemy furnace, raining fire from above.  Amidst the fiery inferno, a godlike figure appeared.</p><p>Riding a divine chariot, accompanied by raging fire, with the heavens roaring, it resembled a thunder general traversing the cosmos, disappearing in an instant, leaving behind endless thunder fire.</p><p>The Myriad God Thunder Department's celestial list did indeed contain the God, Flowing Gold Fire Bell General, the only god general from the intermediate-level spells who could be summoned.</p><p>While not a true god's arrival, the scale of the thunder and fire was awe-inspiring, as if it could incinerate mountains and boil the sea.</p><p>For a moment,</p><p>lightning danced wildly, and fire rained down from the heavens.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>A thunderclap shook the heavens and earth.</p><p>A brilliant white light illuminated the battlefield. A celestial thunder seal descended, its power overwhelming! Compared to this thunder light, the lightning and fire seemed dim.</p><p>The three talismans combined, destroying evil and cleansing defilement.</p><p>The demonic energy pressing in on Qin Sang dissipated, annihilating under the divine thunder, revealing the charging monstrous ox.</p><p>‘Dong dong dong…’</p><p>Thunder fire rained down, continuously pounding the monstrous ox, the sound like a drumbeat.</p><p>The ox roared in fury.  The antlers on its head emitted a strange glow, transforming into jade-like crystalline antlers, their tips sparkling with silver light.</p><p>The silver light spun, rapidly expanding.</p><p>In an instant, a massive silver disc appeared in the void, absorbing the thunder fire.  As it spun faster and faster, it transformed into a silver wheel, hurtling towards Qin Sang.</p><p>The silver wheel was clearly extremely sharp; a slight misstep could result in being cut to pieces.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The silver wheel shot through the air, slicing through the void, instantly reaching Qin Sang.  He didn't dodge or evade, raising his right palm to meet the wheel.</p><p>Compared to the wheel, his palm was incredibly fragile, yet it wasn't cut, firmly gripping the wheel.</p><p>At that moment, the fragment of the true treasure appeared in his palm, turning into ripples of water, blocking the silver wheel.</p><p>Even in its rage, the monstrous ox was momentarily stunned, then even more enraged, using its antlers as a weapon, charging towards him.</p><p>Qin Sang coldly snorted, flexing his arm, causing the silver wheel to deflect, grazing him. He then shifted his body, appearing at the ox’s side with a ghostly speed, striking its shoulders with both fists.</p><p>The ox staggered, but its thick hide meant these injuries were not fatal.</p><p>Unless he could draw other beasts, Qin Sang didn't want to finish the battle quickly. He relied on his powerful defense to engage the monstrous ox, using the Grey Warbler Sword for the main attack.</p><p>From the sky, sword stars rained down, leaving wounds on the monstrous ox, as Qin Sang used the battle to test his understanding of sword techniques.</p><p>The monstrous ox found itself in the same predicament as the Duke Li, bordering on madness. The prey before it seemed shrouded in an impenetrable shell; its normally infallible powers had met their match.</p><p>Noticeably, as Qin Sang and the ox battled, large areas of trees in the forest withered.</p><p>This was due to the draining of the wood spirit energy.  As the monstrous ox continuously absorbed the energy from the trees, death began to spread through the forest.</p><p>Such a striking sign would have immediately revealed Qin Sang’s reliance to any opponent with common sense, allowing them to devise a counter-strategy.</p><p>Alas, the monstrous ox possessed only brute strength.</p><p>Celestial energy surged.</p><p>A sword light, originating from the first asterism, Kui, shot towards the others.  It leaped six times, finally piercing the asterism, Bi. With each leap, the light solidified, until, upon leaving Bi, it was almost a real spirit sword.</p><p>*Shwoop!*</p><p>Like a celestial-slaying sword, it struck the monstrous bull, piercing its armor-like hide, blood spurting forth.</p><p>The bull roared in pain, its back tumors bursting, spewing dark red pus.  These coalesced into nine snake-like creatures.</p><p>The monsters were fused to the bull at their tails, with snake heads, all glaring at Qin Sang with chilling intensity.</p><p>Qin Sang paused, unsure if these were manifestations of the bull's power, or parasitic beasts.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>Another thunder talisman.</p><p>The nine snakes vanished in the divine thunder, only to reform and intertwine into a giant serpent.</p><p>The bull and serpent, like two ferocious beasts, coordinated their attacks against Qin Sang.</p><p>The serpent spewed a foul-smelling blood mist, obscuring much of the area.  While potent, Qin Sang, with his dual cultivation of body and magic, was unfazed.</p><p>He attacked the bull with powerful blows, while his Gray Warbler Sword locked onto the serpent.</p><p>Suddenly, the sky brightened.</p><p>The night vanished as Qin Sang withdrew his Seven Asterisms Division Sword Formation, only to have seven phantoms appear beside the serpent, transforming into brilliant sword beams.</p><p>The Seven Souls Killing Formation!</p><p>The Seven Asterisms Division Formation was offensive, defensive, and capable of confinement—a comprehensive formation, particularly effective with his powerful physique. Since mastering it, Qin Sang had rarely used the Seven Souls Formation.</p><p>Seven swords intertwined, forming a terrifying blade, descending with lethal intent.</p><p>*Pffft!*</p><p>A sword beam pierced the serpent's head, splitting it in two.</p><p>The pus divided into nine globules, twisting before reforming into snakes.</p><p>Qin Sang, wanting to study the serpent, focused the Seven Souls Formation solely on it.  The reformed serpents were weaker, while the bull's enraged roars suggested the snakes were its power, not separate beasts.</p><p>The instant the nine snakes reformed, the Gray Warbler Sword trembled, an almost imperceptible sword light shooting from its tip into one serpent's forehead.</p><p>Qin Sang, battling the bull, paused slightly; the strike seemed taxing.</p><p>The serpent stiffened and exploded.</p><p>Without warning, another serpent froze, its head bursting into pus, leaving its body to writhe.</p><p>Qin Sang exhaled, shaking his head.</p><p>He'd received a sword technique from the Chengying Sword legacy, but hadn't fully grasped it.  This attempt was strenuous.</p><p>The battle continued.  The bull unleashed all its powers, but couldn't defeat Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang wanted to continue studying it, but his Sky Eye Butterfly sent a mental message.</p><p>Dark clouds were gathering from the depths of the Evil Origin, engulfing mountains, attracting beasts and ghouls—more than one.</p><p>Qin Sang’s expression tightened. He launched his Heavenly Annihilation Soul-Destroying Needles.</p><p>Sword Star reappeared, the White Tiger descended, its roar echoing through the mountains. He clenched his fists, blood-stained spikes extending from his gauntlets, radiating killing intent.</p><p>From outside the forest, only darkness and the occasional flicker of sword and starlight were visible.</p><p>The ground trembled violently with thunderous booms, interspersed with pained roars.</p><p>The dark clouds pressed closer.</p><p>Then, the darkness receded like a tide.</p><p>Qin Sang returned to human form, hefted the bull's corpse, glanced back, grew thunder wings, and soared into the sky, leaving devastation behind.</p><p>More than seventy percent of the ancient trees were withered, survivors tinged yellow, the forest nearly dead. Several peaks had collapsed, the ground scarred with craters.</p><p>Thunder escape was incredibly fast, the clouds soon out of sight.</p><p>After traveling a distance, Qin Sang landed on a desolate mountain, confirming there were no pursuers.</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>The bull's corpse landed on the ground.</p><p>Qin Sang, wielding the Grey Warbler Sword, dismembered the monstrous ox.  He carefully collected the most valuable items: the ox demon's core, its antlers, and nine clumps of viscous blood, categorizing them meticulously.</p><p>Quickly dividing the spoils, Qin Sang sat cross-legged, meditating. He sought to understand the gains from this battle.</p><p>Several hours later.</p><p>Qin Sang slowly opened his eyes, a look of doubt flashing within them.  The monstrous ox and Li Hou were both mid-stage Nascent Soul cultivators, both slain by him single-handedly, yet the insights gained from the two battles differed significantly. It wasn't simply a matter of timing.</p><p>Qin Sang frowned, sensing a flaw in his previous understanding.  Perhaps it was because this opponent was a mindless beast.  Challenging strong opponents alone wasn't enough.</p><p>Qin Sang recalled the exhilarating moment of killing Li Hou—a cathartic release, the triumphant feeling of outsmarting and outfighting an enemy, of ultimately prevailing. And of course, the sweet satisfaction of revenge!</p><p>The Killing Path cultivation technique—who should one kill?  Slay the strongest enemy, seek survival against impossible odds, or retaliate against those who seek your death, or perhaps both?</p><p>With his rising cultivation, Qin Sang increasingly understood the importance of "the Dao." The creator of this technique was not a mindless killer; they followed their own path.  If he couldn't grasp this, his future cultivation would be hindered.</p><p>If his guess was correct, he might not be able to remain secluded forever. Thankfully, the battle against Li Hou yielded great rewards; hunting the beast provided some benefit, so he needn't rush back into the world.</p><p>Qin Sang sighed softly, then vanished from the spot.</p><p>…</p><p>Two months later.</p><p>Southeast of Mount Ju, on a barren ridge, a snake demon prostrated itself before Qin Sang.</p><p>“My Lord Immortal, this is my territory.”</p><p>Qin Sang surveyed the desolate land.  Caves dotted the mountainside; ghostly people struggled to survive here.</p><p>Territory… had the Gui Fang nation already claimed the Blight Wasteland as their own?</p><p>Qin Sang estimated the distance. Having the snake demon stationed here would make travel from Mount Ju much easier—a good thing.</p><p>‘Bang! Bang! Bang!’</p><p>The snake demon’s vision blurred, and several objects appeared on the ground—skins, bones, flesh, and blood.</p><p>“Take these to exchange for spirit herbs,” Qin Sang said, pointing to a small jade vial. “This vial of demon blood is for your own use.”</p><p>Sensing the aura emanating from the corpses, the snake demon shivered, filled with terror. Though unable to determine the beast's former cultivation level, it knew it was stronger than the demon lord it served, and had died recently.</p><p>This person had single-handedly slain such a beast!</p><p>Overwhelmed with fear, the snake demon dared not harbor any ulterior motives. Then, hearing Qin Sang bestow blood upon it, overwhelming joy filled its heart.  It kowtowed repeatedly: “I shall wholeheartedly gather spirit herbs for my Lord Immortal, serving you with all my devotion…”</p><p>These were but a small fraction of his recent gains. Given the snake demon's cultivation, occasionally offering one or two pieces would be plausible; more would invite suspicion.</p><p>The snake demon's task was to gather intelligence. If it encountered large quantities of spirit herbs, it could stall the other party, awaiting Qin Sang's return to conduct the transaction disguised as a demon cultivator.</p><p>Afterwards, Qin Sang chose a concealed location, set up a spirit array for the snake demon, then returned to Mount Ju.</p><p>The poisonous lake remained.</p><p>Qin Sang passed through the spirit array and returned to the field of white bone flowers.</p><p>During his absence, the field had remained unchanged.</p><p>Qin Sang circled the field, first gathering the ripe flower essence, then with a flick of his sleeve, sent numerous array components flying into place.  Previously short on materials, he had used Master Qi's fire chamber to refine all the array components upon his return, fully repairing the spirit array.</p><p>While visually unchanged, the array's power had undoubtedly increased significantly, regaining several layers of complexity, making it far more concealed.</p><p>“It’s time for seclusion…”</p><p>Qin Sang murmured, gazing around, before disappearing into his cave dwelling.</p><p>The cave entrance closed.</p><p>Qin Sang examined his inner self.  After a moment, he entered a meditative state. The Sky-Eyed Butterfly flew from his dantian, landing on his shoulder, nestled against his neck, its wings fluttering gently.</p><p>Silence filled the cave; tranquility permeated the air.</p><p>Only Qin Sang’s breath fluctuated, sometimes calm, sometimes turbulent.</p><p>Unlike his previous extended seclusion, every three to five years, Qin Sang would leave for a short time to see the snake demon and the Sword Master.</p><p>The inner essence imbued with the Jade Buddha's aura could protect the Vermilion Jade Centipede for so long; there was no need to ask anyone else to care for it.</p><p>In between, Qin Sang's trips were brief, occasionally venturing into Gui Fang territory, trading in secret without lingering.</p><p>…</p><p>Time flew by.</p><p>Thirty years passed swiftly.</p><p>In the white bone flower field, the passage of time was imperceptible; the spirit flowers remained vibrant, the flower spirit as beautiful as ever.</p><p>Inside the cave.</p><p>Qin Sang’s blood surged as he used poison to temper his body. The vigor of his blood far surpassed that of thirty years prior; his progress was astonishing.</p><p>Suddenly, Qin Sang’s brow arched. He abruptly stopped his secret technique, producing the Sun God Tree with a wave of his sleeve.</p><p>“You’re finally awake.”</p><p>The young Vermilion Bird’s slumber had lasted nearly a hundred years.</p><p>“You’re still alive?”</p><p>A clear, childish voice, tinged with weariness, emanated from the Sun God Tree.  After a pause, it exclaimed in surprise, “Eh? Where are we? And why do you look like that?”</p>
