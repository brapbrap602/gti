<h1>Chapter 997: Soul Light</h1><p>Chapter 997: Soul Light</p><p>Several days later.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyelids fluttered slightly, and he slowly opened his eyes, waking from meditation.  Then, with a thought, a sword gleam flashed from his forehead.</p><p>The ebony sword had completed its transformation.</p><p>The sword's power far surpassed its former self; it had advanced to a high-grade magic weapon!  This was because Qin Sang had only used a portion of the Soul-Nourishing Wood to inscribe the killing talismans faster and improve his cultivation.</p><p>The ebony sword's outward appearance hadn't changed much, but as the sword's master, Qin Sang could clearly feel its enhancement.</p><p>Sword shadows flickered, and flowing light danced.  Qin Sang wielded the sword, practicing various sword techniques effortlessly and without any lag.</p><p>Then, he retracted the ebony sword, suspending it before him.</p><p>Gazing at the sword, Qin Sang looked thoughtful.  After refining the Intertwined Blood Mulberry last time, he obtained the Blood-Polluting Light ability, which had done him great service. He wondered what good news the Soul-Nourishing Wood would bring.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered.  The Blood-Polluting Light wasn't unique to the ebony sword; any magic weapon refined using the Intertwined Blood Mulberry could obtain a similar ability. It was an inherent ability of the divine tree.</p><p>But the Soul-Nourishing Wood seemed to only have the ability to nourish the soul, without similar abilities.  He hadn't seen any related records in ancient texts.</p><p>After all, the ten divine trees were rare treasures in the ancient cultivation world.</p><p>The spirit wood originally emitted uncontrollable blue soul light.</p><p>His eyes flashed as he stared at the blade, noticing a faint layer of soul light on the ebony sword, giving it a gentler feel, less sharp, and not like a weapon of slaughter.</p><p>"Could it be…"</p><p>Qin Sang's heart stirred, and he retracted the ebony sword into his primordial spirit to carefully perceive it.</p><p>Soon, Qin Sang noticed something unusual.</p><p>Now, his primordial spirit and his life-bound spirit sword felt intimately connected. That layer of soul light was gentle as water, as if it could soothe any injury.</p><p>Even more surprisingly,</p><p>His cultivation realm remained unchanged, but his spiritual sense had subtly shifted.</p><p>"The Soul-Nourishing Wood truly can strengthen the spiritual sense! No…"</p><p>After careful contemplation for a long time, Qin Sang finally discovered the source of the change. "Nourished by the soul light, my primordial spirit seems more solid, and my spiritual sense is like it has been refined, becoming more refined rather than simply increasing in power…"</p><p>Although this change was subtle and wouldn't have immediate results, given enough time, the gradual accumulation would be undeniable.</p><p>Confirming this, Qin Sang's doubts vanished, and a joyful expression appeared on his face. "Body refinement, true energy, spiritual sense – can I now be considered to be cultivating the three aspects of essence, energy, and spirit?"</p><p>He continued to contemplate, gaining further insights.</p><p>"If I had a life-bound spirit sword made from Soul-Nourishing Wood when I first started cultivating the *Primordial Spirit Sword Cultivation Chapter*, the pain would have been much less, and I wouldn't have needed the jade Buddha to cultivate."</p><p>Qin Sang discovered another benefit of the Soul-Nourishing Wood, sighing, "I wonder how those predecessors dealt with the cultivation method's drawbacks. They couldn't have given each person a piece of Soul-Nourishing Wood, could they?"</p><p>He cherished it, remaining in his cave dwelling for a whole day before leaving.</p><p>Bai's cave dwelling was nearby.</p><p>After entering the city, Bai had gone into seclusion with spirit herbs, and it was estimated that he wouldn't emerge for a short while.</p><p>After that, Qin Sang remained in the city.</p><p>The shop was merely a front, only occasionally opening. Qin Sang had two main objectives: to investigate the Heavenly Dao Sect, and to improve his cultivation.</p><p>Unknowingly, three years passed.</p><p>In the cave dwelling.</p><p>Qin Sang sat cross-legged, with the last Overlord Blood Fruit beside him.</p><p>During these three years, he had never stopped cultivating.</p><p>The ebony sword had advanced to a high-grade magic weapon, easily handling the inscription of killing talismans.  With decades of prior accumulation, he made rapid progress, and his cultivation base improved at an astonishing speed.</p><p>Qin Sang sensed that a breakthrough was imminent, and he should reach the late Nascent Soul stage within the next few years.</p><p>He planned to visit the Heavenly Dao Sect in person after his cultivation and physical body had both broken through, elevating his strength to a higher level.</p><p>Qin Sang originally planned to secretly contact the Ning surname sword cultivator after finding him.</p><p>There were quite a few Nascent Soul disciples in the Heavenly Dao Sect, but finding information wasn't difficult.  He deliberately befriended some fellow cultivators, and after some investigation, found that there was no one with the Ning surname among them.</p><p>The person was either hiding very well, or wasn't a Nascent Soul cultivator, but a Yuan Ying ancestor.</p><p>For the ancient teleportation array, he had to meet him no matter what. If he couldn't find the person, he would have to visit the sect.</p><p>This caused Qin Sang to have some doubts.</p><p>Although he felt that Senior Qingzhu wouldn't intentionally harm him, he thought it best to be cautious.</p><p>After achieving two breakthroughs, Qin Sang's escape techniques are almost on par with a Yuan Ying master.  Should a crisis arise, he can escape.</p><p>Understanding this, Qin Sang dedicated himself to cultivation.  His cultivation improved, strengthening his body.  Having fully absorbed the previous Ba Xue fruit, he prepared to refine the last one, aiming for the late stage of the third level of *Tian Yao Lian Xing*.</p><p>Qin Sang entered a state of deep meditation, focusing entirely on refining his being.  Clad in simple clothing, his seemingly frail body held tremendous power. His body was comparable to a beast's; he was a human-shaped predator. His blood pulsed like mercury, his vital energy abundant.</p><p>Suddenly, Qin Sang's flesh tightened, his bones cracking. He reached for the jade box, took out the Ba Xue fruit, and swallowed it without hesitation.  The elixir entered his stomach, transforming into a torrent of heat.  The ferocious power exploded.</p><p>Experienced from previous consumptions, Qin Sang remained calm, stabilizing himself and enduring the intense pain as he refined the elixir, undergoing a process of cleansing his meridians and marrow.  His flesh trembled; his skin turned crimson, as if blood were about to burst from within.  Sweat poured from him, yet he remained steadfast, fully focused on refining the elixir's power.</p><p>Time passed slowly.  The ground around Qin Sang was soaked with sweat. A glossy sheen coated his skin; the effects of cleansing continued, though less pronounced than at lower levels.</p><p>Soon, Qin Sang stabilized, the crimson fading from his skin.  He didn't achieve an immediate breakthrough like the two-headed creature did after consuming the Ba Xue fruit, but he sensed that reaching the next level was imminent once he refined enough of the elixir's power.</p><p>During this period, Qin Sang focused solely on refining his body using the power of the celestial stars.</p><p>Two months later.</p><p>A sea area outside the Heavenly Dao Sect.</p><p>A figure appeared, circling in the air.  Seeing no one, a green light flashed, and a pair of extraordinarily ornate phoenix wings materialized.  This was Qin Sang, who had successfully broken through to the late stage of the third level of *Tian Yao Lian Xing* after two months of intense cultivation.</p><p>Qin Sang examined his wings. Initially illusory, they had solidified with each advancement, becoming increasingly lifelike.</p><p>---</p><p>---</p><p>The third trip to the Seven Killing Hall is approaching, coinciding with the climax of this arc's events. I feel the plot could still use some refinement. I'm currently reviewing the arc from the beginning to ensure it is as good as possible.</p><p>The revision isn't complete yet; this chapter is a bit rushed.  Please don't wait; I'll also use this time to adjust my schedule.  I will add more content after the revisions are complete.</p>
