<h1>Chapter 224: The Arranged Marriage</h1><p>Chapter 224: The Arranged Marriage</p><p>Shaohua Mountain.</p><p>Qin Sang descended from the clouds before the mountain gate, finding a portion of the mountain gate array activated. Several Shaohua Mountain disciples were patrolling and on alert nearby.</p><p>Shaohua Mountain, among the prominent sects in the Xiaohan domain, was the closest to the Yun Cang Great Marsh, making it a highly visible target.  In case of an incident, Shaohua Mountain would undoubtedly be the first to bear the brunt, thus necessitating their vigilance.</p><p>It was said that many major market towns near the edge of the Yun Cang Great Marsh, such as the Wenyue Market, had closed, and those remaining were heavily guarded, with everyone entering and exiting carefully vetted.  The urgency of the situation was readily apparent.</p><p>“Junior Uncle Qin, please enter!”</p><p>Qin Sang produced his sect token. After verifying his identity, the patrolling disciples bowed respectfully and allowed him to enter the mountain.</p><p>Before entering, Qin Sang flew to a high point to survey the area.  The Yun Cang Great Marsh stretched endlessly, shimmering with sunlight; the scenery was extremely beautiful.  Yet beneath this tranquil appearance, undercurrents surged, potentially transforming into a bloody battlefield that would consume countless cultivators in an instant.</p><p>Pushing aside the clouds, Qin Sang flew into the sect, landing on Dao Men Peak and finding Zhuang Yan.</p><p>“Congratulations, Senior Brother Zhuang, on your happy union! My congratulations are late, I hope Senior Brother Zhuang will forgive me!”</p><p>Qin Sang chuckled and bowed to Zhuang Yan.</p><p>Years had passed since their last meeting, and Zhuang Yan's cultivation had reached the mid-Foundation Establishment stage. For his age, his cultivation speed was considered slow.  If Zhuang Yan couldn't quickly break through to the late stage, by the time he reached the False Core stage, his lifespan would be dwindling, leaving him with very little time to prepare for Core Formation.  This meant his chances of Core Formation were slim.</p><p>Now, Master Wen had returned to his hometown to enjoy his retirement, and Zhuang Yan had taken over Wen's position, managing Dao Men Peak.  Ten years ago, Zhuang Yan had formed a partnership with a senior sister from Shaohua Mountain named Xiao Qiuyue.  Upon hearing the news, Qin Sang, unable to return to the sect, had sent a pair of spirit swords as a wedding gift, without attending the ceremony in person.</p><p>Zhuang Yan pulled Qin Sang down to sit, sighing.  “Junior Brother Qin, it’s been decades.  You come back, and you tease your senior brother with such remarks.  Be careful, I might just throw you out!”</p><p>Seeing Zhuang Yan’s demeanor, Qin Sang sat opposite him, puzzled. “Senior Brother Zhuang, what are you saying? I sincerely offer my blessings. How did it become teasing in your words? Where is Senior Sister Xiao? I haven't met Senior Sister Xiao yet. I wonder if she likes the pair of 'good fortune' swords?”</p><p>“The spirit swords you sent are of such high quality, she must like them.”</p><p>Zhuang Yan sighed lightly. “Unfortunately, the two of us are unworthy of the name ‘good fortune.’ We don’t deserve them.”</p><p>Seeing Zhuang Yan’s genuine expression, Qin Sang stopped smiling and asked seriously, “I heard that Senior Sister Xiao is a prominent figure within the sect, a true standout. What could Senior Brother Zhuang possibly be dissatisfied with?”</p><p>“Have you, Junior Brother, ever lived among ordinary people?”</p><p>Zhuang Yan looked troubled. “Among ordinary men and women, marriage often involves a process called ‘arranged marriage.’  Parents' orders and matchmakers' words force two strangers together. How much genuine affection can there be between them? It’s just two people living together, barely making do.”</p><p>Qin Sang thought to himself, *Senior Brother, do you know that, somewhere, countless people nearing thirty without partners yearn for parents’ orders and matchmakers’ words, yet can’t obtain them?*  They don’t understand the benefits of arranged marriages until they reach a certain age.</p><p>“Master Wen forced you to agree?”</p><p>Zhuang Yan murmured a barely audible “Mm,” “Not exactly…”</p><p>Qin Sang chuckled. He knew immediately there was something more to the story.  Cultivators forming partnerships were different from ordinary mortals; they didn’t face the same societal pressures, and their purpose wasn't to continue the family line.  If Zhuang Yan didn't agree, Master Wen wouldn’t have forced him.</p><p>“Senior Brother, you’re over a hundred years old. You shouldn’t be unable to understand matters of men and women. Do you really expect true love to fall upon you? Have you forgotten what Master Ma Wu said when he was looking for a dual cultivation partner and advised me? Could it be that, being in this mountain, you can’t see or understand?”</p><p>“Even without true love, it’s not… it’s not…”</p><p>Zhuang Yan scratched the back of his head, stammering, unable to articulate his thoughts.  Finally, he looked around cautiously, leaned close to Qin Sang, and whispered resentfully, “Junior Brother, do you know that her purpose in forming a partnership with me is because of my physique? It’s the most compatible with her cultivation of the *Yin Yang Participation Treatise*?”</p><p>Qin Sang had heard of the *Yin Yang Participation Treatise*.</p><p>This cultivation technique was one of Shaohua Mountain’s most treasured dual cultivation techniques. Unlike the *玄牝玉鼎真经* (Xuan Pin Yu Ding Zhen Jing), this was an orthodox Xuanmen technique, allowing men and women to cultivate the Yin and Yang Dao together without harming either party.  It was said that the technique had requirements for the cultivators’ physiques, and upon successful cultivation, the male and female practitioners would both receive significant benefits from dual cultivation.</p><p>Qingting and Jiang's cultivation technique is the "Yin-Yang Harmony Scripture."</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't surprised by what Zhuang Yan said.</p><p>He asked Zhuang Yan, "Brother Zhuang, didn't you agree to dual cultivation for this very purpose?"</p><p>"Yes! That's right!"</p><p>Zhuang Yan didn't deny it.</p><p>"But Brother Qin, you don't know, practicing the 'Yin-Yang Harmony Scripture' requires similar cultivation levels for optimal results.  If one of us breaks through to the late Foundation Establishment stage first, the other will still benefit, but the Scripture will become useless for the person who advanced, unless the other also breaks through.</p><p>"She and I had a serious talk recently.</p><p>"She said if I break through to the late Foundation Establishment stage before her, she'll withdraw and find someone else; she won't hold me back. If she breaks through first, she hopes I would do the same…</p><p>"This… this is what?"</p><p>Qin Sang watched Zhuang Yan, head in his hands, his voice heavy.  He shook his head slightly.</p><p>Deep down, he agreed with what Sister Xiao said, but seeing Zhuang Yan's state, he hesitated to speak.</p><p>"Brother Zhuang, have you fallen for Sister Xiao?"</p><p>Qin Sang's words were startling.</p><p>Zhuang Yan froze, motionless.</p><p>Qin Sang had a hunch. He said softly, "Brother Zhuang, we cultivators seek immortality, don't we strive for freedom? Brother Zhuang should examine your heart, ask yourself what you truly want. If it's longevity, you must make sacrifices, why the distress? If it's Sister Xiao… you shouldn't be afraid to even speak your mind, should you?"</p><p>At that moment, a message talisman flew into the hall.</p><p>Zhuang Yan caught it, glanced at the time, and hurriedly stood up. "It's time for cultivation. Brother Qin, you just returned to the sect, you must have much to do.  Brother will treat you to drinks tomorrow."</p><p>"Please do, Brother Zhuang."</p><p>Qin Sang saw Zhuang Yan off.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Zhuang Yan, after flying a short distance, returned hastily, throwing a token to Qin Sang.  "Brother Qin, the cave outside is unsafe, and you don't have a place to stay in the sect.  I don't need this cave for now; you can use it."</p><p>Qin Sang took the token and watched Zhuang Yan's retreating figure disappear deep into the mountain gate, his head bowed, lost in thought.</p><p>After a long while, he chuckled, summoned his cloud steed, and flew towards the Sect Leader's Peak.</p>
