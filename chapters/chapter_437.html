<h1>Chapter 430: Forced Plea</h1><p>“Cough… cough…”</p><p>The blood-soaked man finally awoke.</p><p>The woman in palace attire had only forcefully suppressed his injuries and revived him to inquire about the cause.  He was severely wounded and couldn't have recovered so quickly. Although conscious, he remained extremely weak, as if he were coughing up his lungs, like a dying mortal.</p><p>It was unknown what secret method the woman had used, but after reviving the man, her own aura became disordered, clearly indicating a significant expenditure of energy.</p><p>The gatekeeper helped the weakened woman to her feet and only then remembered to clean the blood-soaked man.</p><p>A faint spiritual energy swept over the man, cleansing the blood and revealing his face.</p><p>Beneath the gore was the face of a man in his forties. He must have been stout, but now his entire left cheek had been sliced off by a sharp weapon, exposing bone-white teeth.</p><p>In addition, a long gash ran across the bridge of his nose, nearly splitting his head in two. The wound was close to his eyes; a bit higher, and he would have lost them.</p><p>The two wounds were horrifying, making his appearance terrifying. Everyone gasped.</p><p>Previously, fearing they would disturb the woman's healing efforts, they dared not use their divine senses or spiritual power to examine the man. Now, seeing his true appearance, someone in the crowd suddenly cried out.</p><p>“Senior Brother Liu, is that you?”</p><p>Then, a figure flashed from the crowd and rushed to the man’s side.</p><p>Someone immediately recognized him.</p><p>“He’s Qiao Jiang of the Void Spirit Sect!”</p><p>“This man is a Void Spirit Sect disciple. How did he end up like this?”</p><p>Qiao Jiang pushed aside the gatekeeper and gently helped the Liu surname cultivator up. “Senior Brother Liu, it’s Qiao Jiang. We met at Suspended Earth Mountain. Do you remember?”</p><p>Qin Sang had heard of the Void Spirit Sect's Suspended Earth Mountain before.</p><p>Within the Void Spirit Sect, there was a unique mountain called Suspended Earth Mountain. It was said that this mountain wasn't on the surface but hidden deep underground, a mountain within a mountain.</p><p>The Void Spirit Sect controlled the largest subterranean fire vein in the Small Cold Realm.</p><p>This fire vein was unique, converging beneath the sect's mountain gate. The entire underground area had been hollowed out, and within this cavity, a peculiar small mountain stood above the fire vein.</p><p>This mountain touched neither sky nor earth, suspended in mid-air, day and night bathed in the scorching heat of the subterranean fire vein. After countless years of transformation and refinement, the mountain rocks had changed, giving birth to a unique flame, similar to earth fire yet distinct and far more powerful.</p><p>It was said that this flame could be used to refine magical treasures, and the Void Spirit Sect's Core Formation cultivators used the fire of Suspended Earth Mountain to reduce the consumption of their own core flames.</p><p>The Void Spirit Sect’s expertise in refining was due to this unique fire. Suspended Earth Mountain was known as the foundation of the Void Spirit Sect!</p><p>The jade slip Wu the shopkeeper had given Qin Sang recorded the process of the Core Formation cultivator refining treasures using the unique fire at Suspended Earth Mountain.</p><p>“Junior Brother Qiao…”</p><p>Cultivator Liu finally recognized his fellow disciple, his voice weak and airy through the gaps in his teeth.</p><p>Overjoyed, Qiao Jiang repeatedly asked, “Senior Brother Liu, what happened? How did you get so badly injured?”</p><p>“I… cough…”</p><p>Cultivator Liu, just awakened, had a dazed look in his eyes and coughed violently again.</p><p>Qiao Jiang helped regulate Cultivator Liu's breathing, quickly explaining, “Senior Brother Liu, this is the trade fair… How many Heaven’s Decree Alliance members came? Tell us quickly, so many of us fellow Daoists are here, we can avenge you…”</p><p>“Trade fair…”</p><p>“Right, the trade fair!”</p><p>Cultivator Liu suddenly came to his senses, propped himself up on Qiao Jiang's hand, sat up abruptly, and urgently addressed the gatekeeper, “Where’s Senior Pei Chin? Quickly invite him to save them…”</p><p>Everyone was startled by Cultivator Liu's words.</p><p>Only Core Formation cultivators were addressed as Senior.</p><p>The power behind the trade fair was a Core Formation cultivator. No wonder they dared to organize a trade fair in this place.</p><p>Many also felt fortunate for having restrained their greed and not breaking the rules of the trade fair.  There had been those who disrupted the trade fair in the past, and they had all vanished without a trace, their fate easily imagined.</p><p>A sense of security followed, and their anxious hearts settled slightly.</p><p>The sky might fall, but there was someone tall enough to hold it up.</p><p>At least, having a Core Formation cultivator present provided a backbone. Even if something happened, they wouldn't be completely defenseless.</p><p>Everyone’s gaze swept towards the passage leading to the second floor of the hall. Was the cave of this Core Formation cultivator named Pei Chin beneath the hall?</p><p>Unexpectedly, the gatekeeper gave a dry laugh. “Fellow Daoist, I don’t know any Pei Chin. I’m not sure who you’re talking about…”</p><p>Before the gatekeeper could finish, Cultivator Liu took a deep breath, suddenly raised his arm, revealing a gleaming token in his hand. He raised his head, channeled his spiritual energy, and shouted in a hoarse voice, “This disciple, along with Uncle-Master Fang and Senior Shen Tu of the Spirit Taming Sect, was ambushed by several Core Formation cultivators of the Heaven's Decree Alliance! The situation is critical. Uncle-Master Fang and Senior Shen Tu are trapped! They ordered me to come to the trade fair and request Senior Pei Chin's assistance! I have delivered the message! Please heed my call, Senior…”</p><p>His voice echoed throughout the hall.</p><p>Having said this in one breath, Cultivator Liu exhausted his strength, collapsed into Qiao Jiang’s arms, and fainted again.</p><p>‘Clang!’</p><p>The token fell to the ground, forged from black iron, with the ancient character 'Cold' inscribed on it.</p><p>“You…”</p><p>The gatekeeper, too late to stop him, stamped his foot in anger.</p><p>Everyone's expressions varied. They had all heard of the token. It was said to be very rare, possessed by only a few.</p><p>To combat the Heaven’s Decree Alliance, the various sects of the Small Cold Realm had put aside their differences and joined forces.</p><p>Seeing the token was like seeing a Nascent Soul cultivator.</p><p>In times of emergency, once used, no one could disobey, not even Core Formation cultivators, unless they didn’t want to remain in the Small Cold Realm.</p><p>Judging by the gatekeeper’s attitude, he seemed unwilling to disturb his master and get involved in this mess, but Cultivator Liu had forced the issue in front of everyone.</p><p>The token held significant power.</p><p>But it wasn't absolutely binding.</p><p>If Cultivator Liu had approached him privately, Pei Chin could have easily claimed he hadn't received any orders, killed Cultivator Liu, and erased any trace.</p><p>Without evidence, no one could blame him.</p><p>Unfortunately, it was the day of the trade fair, with dozens of people present, including disciples from the eight righteous sects, who had witnessed this scene. It was impossible to cover it up.</p><p>Unless…</p><p>With so many people present, they wouldn't kill everyone to silence them, would they?</p><p>Everyone exchanged glances, feeling uneasy, not daring to move.</p><p>So many Foundation Establishment cultivators weren't afraid of a single Core Formation cultivator, but on the opponent’s territory, no one knew if there were deadly formations in the hall.</p><p>They were a disorganized group, and it would be difficult to cooperate.  If they saw an opportunity, they would definitely flee for their lives. Those who were slow would be doomed.</p><p>They could only hope that this Core Formation cultivator named Pei Chin wasn't a madman, otherwise, dying here would be a grave injustice.</p>
