<h1>Chapter 1938: Tranquility</h1><p>Scholar Chen readily accepted the two disciples, and didn't demand any binding fees.</p><p>Qin Sang wouldn't haggle over such trivial matters.  He expressed his thanks and had Xiao Wu and Yu Lang step forward to perform the discipleship ceremony.</p><p>"Ming Yan, fetch two sets of writing materials."</p><p>Scholar Chen instructed.</p><p>The bookboy acknowledged the order and hurried down the mountain.</p><p>The ceremony was held within the Daoist temple.</p><p>Scholar Chen held high prestige among the villagers. Even though their medical consultations were delayed, no one showed impatience. Instead, they flocked into the temple, curiously watching the two young Daoist children complete the ritual.</p><p>When the panting bookboy returned with the writing materials and several scriptures, Scholar Chen tested the two children's knowledge. After personally instructing them, he formally acknowledged them as his disciples.</p><p>Xiao Wu naturally began with elementary studies.</p><p>Yu Lang had studied before, but the Confucian classics taught in the two places differed slightly. Scholar Chen arranged for Yu Lang to also spend some time in the elementary class.</p><p>Qin Sang had the same intention, temporarily keeping Yu Lang and Xiao Wu together until Xiao Wu adapted to the school environment, and then separating them.</p><p>After agreeing on an auspicious day for their formal enrollment, Scholar Chen and his wife descended the mountain, and Qin Sang continued to see patients.</p><p>After a busy period, it was already nearing noon.</p><p>The Daoist temple was still overflowing with people.</p><p>Yu Lang, busy as a bee, finally found a moment of respite and sat beside Qin Sang, helping his Shijie grind medicinal herbs.  With a worried expression, he said, "Master, what will you do when we're gone? When will Senior Tai Yi leave seclusion?"</p><p>Luo Hou slept all day, and Zhu Que was unreliable. Only Tai Yi could help.</p><p>Xiao Wu also wore a worried look.</p><p>"You're worried about your Master now?"</p><p>Qin Sang chuckled. These two disciples were more invested in the role than he was. "It's just these first few days. There won't be so many people later."</p><p>On the first day, Qin Sang didn't finish seeing the last patient until the moon and stars were bright, finally closing the temple gates.</p><p>Under the flickering lamplight,</p><p>Qin Sang counted the copper coins and checked the ledger. Yu Lang, soaking in a tub, described his experiences at the school to Xiao Wu, gesticulating animatedly.</p><p>Just as Qin Sang predicted, by the fourth day, he had seen almost all the patients from Seven Rows Village.  Those who had come out of curiosity had also grown tired, and the crowds thinned considerably.</p><p>However, news of the divine physician Daoist priest on Seven Rows Mountain had begun to spread.</p><p>Early one morning,</p><p>as the first rays of dawn kissed the horizon, a young Daoist child slowly pushed open the temple gates to find several people already waiting outside.</p><p>The autumn dew was heavy and cold.</p><p>Some people still wore patched singlets, shivering.</p><p>"Come in quickly, it's warmer inside."</p><p>Yu Lang greeted them skillfully. A fire burned in the main hall, and the temple was piled high with firewood, all enthusiastically donated by the villagers.</p><p>The mountain path had also been repaired in the past few days, and the village head even hired a drum and gong troupe, who played boisterously for half the morning.</p><p>Xiao Wu and Yu Lang, each with a broom, swept the temple inside and out. This was their daily chore, and some of the patients who came up the mountain would lend a hand.</p><p>By the time they finished, Qin Sang emerged from the cellar.</p><p>"Master!"</p><p>Xiao Wu and Yu Lang ran hand-in-hand to Qin Sang, bowing.  Their smiles could barely be contained.</p><p>Today was the day they went down the mountain to formally enroll in school.</p><p>"Couldn't wait, could you? Look what I have for you."</p><p>Qin Sang smiled at his two disciples, revealing two exquisite small book boxes from behind his back.</p><p>The boxes weren't large, but they were more than enough to hold their elementary school supplies.</p><p>"Wow! Thank you, Master!"</p><p>Yu Lang's eyes were glued to the book box.  He took it, cherishing it, almost reluctant to put it on. His eyes glistened with tears.</p><p>In his previous school, few students owned book boxes; most used book bags.</p><p>He had a book box, which many of his classmates envied, but he envied them in return.</p><p>Because their book bags were sewn stitch by stitch by their parents, while he could only make his own book box.</p><p>This book box was made of ordinary wood from the temple, not a magical treasure. A cultivator could effortlessly create countless such boxes, but this one was made by his Master's own hand.</p><p>Xiao Wu held the book box with more care than he showed for anything else.  He didn't express his gratitude verbally, but as he stroked the box, a new depth appeared in his expression.</p><p>Qin Sang patted their heads gently.  "It's almost time. Go down the mountain."</p><p>Yu Lang and Xiao Wu exchanged glances, shouldered their book boxes, and descended the mountain together.</p><p>Qin Sang watched from the cliff's edge as the two small figures, one tall and one short, gradually receded into the distance.  A strange, indescribable feeling stirred within him.</p><p>He hadn't felt this way when he took on his other disciples.</p><p>"Perhaps it's because they were already adults when they joined me. Could this be what it feels like to raise children?"</p><p>Qin Sang chuckled self-deprecatingly.</p><p>In the east, the rising sun finally crested the mountaintop, a sliver of golden light illuminating Qin Sang's face, casting a long shadow.</p><p>Qin Sang looked up at the gradually fading stars.</p><p>If one day, he truly achieved his wish and ascended to immortality, living a carefree existence, what kind of life would that be?</p><p>Would it be as it was now, a return to simplicity, peaceful and tranquil?</p><p>"This kind of life...is quite good,"</p><p>Qin Sang murmured.</p><p>The peaceful days hadn't eroded his will; instead, they ignited a greater fighting spirit within him.</p><p>"Cock-a-doodle-doo..."</p><p>The faint sound of a rooster crowing drifted up from below.  Someone else was coming up the mountain path.</p><p>Qin Sang turned and returned to the main hall.</p><p>The stream of patients seeking treatment seemed endless.</p><p>Qin Sang's reputation as a divine physician had spread.  Fame was a kind of authority.</p><p>Even without Yu Lang's help, people naturally formed a queue. Anyone who broke the rules was not only condemned by the others but also risked angering the divine physician and being denied treatment.</p><p>Thus, Qin Sang could manage everything in an orderly fashion even on his own.</p><p>Treating mortals required little mental effort. Qin Sang let his mind wander, pondering the matters of the main altar and Tai Yi.</p><p>"Divine Physician Daoshi, please examine me. My chest has been feeling tight..."</p><p>The previous patient left, showering Qin Sang with gratitude. The next patient immediately stepped forward and sat before him.</p><p>This person looked to be about forty years old, with a prosperous appearance.  His clothes weren't luxurious, but they didn't suggest poverty either.</p><p>He clutched his chest with his right hand, quickly describing his ailment, feigning an expression of pain.</p><p>Qin Sang put down his brush and glanced up at him. "You're not from the three villages at the foot of the mountain."</p><p>North of Seven Rows Village lay two other villages, Back Mountain Village and Granary River Village, nestled deeper in the mountains and less prosperous than Seven Rows Village.</p><p>The prosperous-looking man was taken aback. "No! No! I'm from town. Have you seen me before?"</p><p>"Your accent is different," Qin Sang said.</p><p>"You can even hear that? You truly are a divine physician!"</p><p>Unlike some places where the accent changed every few miles, the local dialects were similar, making it difficult for locals to distinguish between them.</p><p>The man was immediately convinced and extended his arm. "Please examine me quickly..."</p><p>Qin Sang didn't take his pulse. "There's nothing seriously wrong with you. A little调养 will do. Haven't you seen a physician before?"</p><p>"I saw a physician in town, but I heard about the divine physician here," the man said with an awkward smile.</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head.  "No need.  For minor ailments like this, listen to the town physician. Tell others the same when you return. Otherwise, they'll come to this poor Daoist's temple for nothing."</p><p>"This...you don't treat minor ailments?"</p><p>The man was dumbfounded. He had never encountered such a peculiar physician.</p><p>Such a thing was unheard of. If not for the widespread rumors about this Daoist priest, even Scholar Chen calling him an expert, he would have questioned him on the spot.</p><p>"Jushi, please return," Qin Sang gestured for him to leave.</p><p>"I..."</p><p>The man was about to speak when he caught sight of a figure striding quickly into the main hall, drawing rebukes from the other patients.</p><p>This person's attire was strange. He wore a heavy coat and a large hood, completely concealing his head and face.</p><p>Was the weather already this cold?</p><p>"Hmm?  Seems a little familiar..."</p><p>The prosperous man couldn't help but take a second look, just as the person removed his hood, revealing a familiar face.</p><p>"Isn't that Physician Liu?"</p><p>The prosperous man exclaimed softly and quickly stood up.</p><p>This was Physician Liu, renowned throughout the town. He had consulted with Physician Liu before, so encountering him here was somewhat awkward.</p><p>Physician Liu, wrapped in his heavy coat, concealed his figure.  His face, around fifty years of age, held a somewhat austere expression.</p><p>"My apologies! My apologies!"</p><p>Physician Liu, in his haste, had offended the crowd. He repeatedly cupped his hands in apology and quickly approached Qin Sang, bowing deeply. "This humble one is Liu Yuansheng. I've come to apologize to Daoshi."</p><p>Qin Sang was puzzled.  "We've never met.  Why do you say this?"</p><p>"To be frank, Daoshi, I heard yesterday that you cured Old Man Qi from Seven Rows Village, and learned that you were holding consultations here, charging only a small fee, with patients flocking to your door. Filled with resentment, I came here today, intending to compete with you."</p><p>Physician Liu had arrived at the temple early and had been observing from outside.  As an expert, he quickly recognized Qin Sang's skill.  Hearing the conversation between Qin Sang and the prosperous man, he couldn't help but burst in.</p><p>"Daoshi, not only is your medical skill divine, but you also possess a benevolent heart towards fellow physicians.  You are truly a virtuous and righteous person.  I, with my petty mind, judged you unfairly, thinking that if your medical skill was inferior to mine, I would drive you out of Qinggui Town, forbidding you to practice medicine.  Shameful! Shameful!"</p><p>How could Physician Liu have known that Qin Sang was a cultivator, descending the mountain to experience the mortal world, not to steal anyone's livelihood.</p><p>"I heard that Daoshi has sent his beloved disciples to Scholar Chen's school to study and become literate, and that you lack assistance. I'm willing to close my clinic and serve as your medicine boy, attending to you," Physician Liu said sincerely.</p><p>His words caused a stir.</p><p>Physician Liu had long been established, recognized as a divine physician.</p><p>People flocked to Qin Sang largely because of his low fees and the option to keep accounts, attracting mostly the poor.</p><p>Few truly believed that this wandering Daoist priest's medical skills surpassed Physician Liu's.</p><p>Qin Sang smiled faintly.</p><p>This man's words were sincere, though with some ulterior motives, but harmless.  His nature wasn't bad.</p><p>"Physician Liu, there's no need. This poor Daoist's meager income can't support many people. Moreover, this poor Daoist is a Daoist priest and must cultivate.  I cannot always hold consultations."</p><p>"I..."</p><p>Physician Liu wanted to speak further, but Qin Sang waved his hand, interrupting him.</p><p>"Physician Liu, if you encounter any uncertain cases in the future, feel free to bring them to the temple, and we can discuss them together."</p><p>Hearing these words, Physician Liu's eyes widened.</p><p>He knew his own limitations. What was called "discussion" would likely be Qin Sang using the cases to instruct him, no different from being a medicine boy, and a much better opportunity.</p><p>This was a chance others could only dream of.</p><p>He never expected that, past fifty, he would encounter a true divine physician. His sincerity had not been in vain. Physician Liu was almost moved to tears.</p><p>This time, Qin Sang didn't stop him. He waved his hand.  "Go."</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>Physician Liu respectfully performed a disciple's bow.</p><p>A man in his fifties, bowing deeply to a young Daoist priest, yet no one found it inappropriate.</p><p>After Physician Liu left, silence fell over the temple.</p><p>Everyone regarded Qin Sang with even greater reverence.</p><p>"I now believe Daoyou is truly experiencing the mortal world."</p><p>A deep voice suddenly echoed in the hall.</p><p>The patient in front of Qin Sang seemed not to hear, still nervously watching as Qin Sang took his pulse.</p><p>Before the altar stood a man in white robes, with a refined and scholarly air.</p><p>He had entered the main hall shortly after Qin Sang began his consultations, not to seek treatment, but to casually offer incense to the deities before standing there with his hands clasped behind his back, observing Qin Sang with interest.</p><p>Villagers came and went, yet none noticed him.</p><p>"This poor Daoist thought the Earth God wouldn't reveal this poor Daoist's identity."</p><p>Qin Sang replied calmly, without lifting his head.</p><p>The newcomer was the local Earth God, a young and refined man. He governed this area, and nothing escaped his notice. Upon learning of this matter, he had come to investigate personally.</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't deliberately concealed his identity as a cultivator. Descending the mountain for experience didn't mean he had to become a mortal.</p><p>If he were to investigate the origins of the main altar in the future, he might need the help of the local deities.</p><p>"Tacit understanding is, of course, preferable. However, as the Earth God, sustained by the incense offerings of the people, I must inquire to ensure peace of mind, lest someone harbor ill intentions and invite disaster."</p><p>The Earth God gave Qin Sang a searching look.</p><p>He couldn't discern the Daoist priest's cultivation level, unsure if it was deeply concealed or simply far beyond his own.</p><p>However, he had discreetly observed the two disciples. One had only recently begun cultivating, while the other appeared to still be a mortal.</p><p>"Is Daoyou at ease now?" Qin Sang seemed not to detect the deeper meaning in his words.</p><p>"Daoyou's benevolent actions benefit the people. I have nothing to be uneasy about. However, duty compels me to report the presence of an extraordinary individual within my domain to the City God. When he has the leisure, the City God may pay a personal visit.  Daoshi wouldn't mind, would he?"</p><p>The Earth God decided not to pry further, choosing to report the matter and leave it to the City God to decide.</p><p>"It's only proper."</p><p>Qin Sang's tone remained calm as he wrapped the medicine in paper and handed it to the patient.</p><p>The patient left, overflowing with gratitude.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang's composure, the Earth God frowned slightly and glanced outside. "Daoshi is busy. I won't disturb you further. Farewell."</p><p>"Until we meet again."</p><p>Qin Sang gave a distant bow, startling the next patient.</p><p>A day without his disciples' help passed in a flurry of activity.</p><p>Past the seventh hour, Xiao Wu and Yu Lang returned to the mountain together. After cleaning the temple, they performed their evening practice in the main hall.</p><p>"Master, I made several friends. Everyone likes Shijie...Shijie learns so quickly. I feel like I've become smarter too..."</p><p>Yu Lang chattered excitedly, recounting the day's events at school.</p><p>Xiao Wu simply smiled softly beside him.</p><p>From now on, the lives of the three master and disciples continued in this manner, day after day, in peaceful tranquility.</p>
