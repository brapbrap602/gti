<h1>Chapter 1576: Body Snatching</h1><p>Chapter 1576: Body Snatching</p><p>“Is he waiting for that old fellow, or does he think someone more powerful will come to save her?”</p><p>Qin Sang flashed this thought, a cold smile on his face.</p><p>He hadn't seen the situation clearly before.</p><p>After Yan Shan and Si Tu Yu discovered the snow fox, Yan Shan remained alone in the Northern Wasteland, his cave having not even a single servant.  His repeated pursuit of the snow fox showed how much he valued the ice crystal, unlike what that person claimed.</p><p>The sorceress and the old man outside arrived so quickly; Lu Ye was not far from the Snow Plain.</p><p>If Yan Shan had known about Lu Ye’s presence, would he have dared to plot against the snow fox right under Lu Ye's nose, deliberately concealing it from him? This person was certainly not as simple as he appeared.</p><p>Yan Shan's intentions were unfathomable.</p><p>And Lu Ye was a Nascent Soul cultivation site.</p><p>Caught in the middle, Qin Sang naturally had to be wary of both sides, lest he be unknowingly used.  Both his main body and his clone retained their strength to deal with unexpected events.</p><p>If he hadn't been after the ice crystal, he would have withdrawn and let them fight it out.</p><p>The struggle continued.</p><p>Yan Shan’s obstruction of the sorceress was quite thorough. With the ice crystal safely in hand, Qin Sang's doubts lessened, and he decided to save the old man and leave this dangerous place as soon as possible.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>A chill, deeper and colder than a torrent of light, shot out from Qin Sang's palm, manifesting a square seal.</p><p>As the four-clawed snake seal appeared, a snake detached from the seal's knob, its size rapidly expanding until it became a monstrous beast with bared fangs and claws, glaring angrily at Yue Fei.</p><p>‘Roar!’</p><p>The snake roared, a soul-shaking sound that sent chills down one's spine.</p><p>Even Nascent Soul cultivators, while able to refine their natal treasures to the spiritual treasure level, find it difficult to forge other spiritual treasures; they might not be willing to give them to their disciples.</p><p>Even a Nascent Soul cultivator’s adopted son might not possess a spiritual treasure, let alone this woman.</p><p>Although this woman possessed numerous treasures, they were no match for a spiritual treasure.</p><p>Qin Sang had thought that once the spiritual treasure appeared, the sorceress would regain her senses.</p><p>Unexpectedly, upon seeing the spiritual treasure, Yue Fei raised her snow-white neck, staring intently at the snake.  Instead of fear, a flicker of狂喜 (狂喜 - kuangxi - intense joy) flashed in her alluring eyes.</p><p>Then, Yue Fei reached to her waist, taking a jade butterfly from her pouch.</p><p>The circular jade butterfly was slightly larger than Yue Fei's palm.  Circles of intricate patterns were carved on its surface, causing dizziness at a single glance.</p><p>Runes filled the spaces between the patterns, forming a blood-patterned ghost diagram.</p><p>As she took out the jade butterfly, Yue Fei used divine power, her brow glowing as she formed a spirit talisman in mid-air.</p><p>The illusory talisman shimmered with faint blood light before merging into the center of the jade butterfly.</p><p>The talisman wasn't complex, and Yue Fei wasn't a specialist in talisman arts.</p><p>The talisman was a key, used to activate the jade butterfly.</p><p>The jade butterfly vibrated intensely, a strange force flowing through the patterns, instantly illuminating all the blood-patterned ghost diagrams.  For a moment, talismanic lights and shadows filled the air.</p><p>This treasure was a talisman disc inscribed with countless talismans. These talismans were usually dormant, maintained in a state of balance within the disc. Once activated, they unleashed formidable power.</p><p>This type of talisman disc was also a treasure of talisman arts, different from the secret talisman methods of the Shangyuan Qingjing Palace.</p><p>Talismans encompassed a vast range; even considering only talisman discs, there were many types.</p><p>This particular talisman disc was a one-time defensive treasure, given to others, activated by a 'key', similar to a disposable magical artifact. Some could be used repeatedly, enhancing a cultivator's speed in drawing talismans and their power in manipulating them; their functions varied.</p><p>The activation of the talisman disc was instantaneous.</p><p>The jade butterfly in Yue Fei's hand returned to its original state, the blood-patterned ghost diagrams disappearing as its power was exhausted. A blood-red formation shone on Yue Fei, enveloping her in its intricate runes.</p><p>Qin Sang had no intention of showing mercy.  The spiritual treasure's power was unleashed without reservation. The snake, like an illusion and lightning, left a trail of cold flames in the air as it lunged towards Yue Fei.</p><p>To Qin Sang's surprise,</p><p>even at this point, Yue Fei continued to resist.  Her thunder pearl soared into the air, emitting a pink light, countless bolts of lightning pouring down amidst deafening thunder.</p><p>Lightning rained down.</p><p>The snake, its momentum undiminished, crashed into the interwoven lightning net, its cold flames surging, instantly tearing the net to shreds and striking directly at the thunder pearl.</p><p>At this sight, Yue Fei gritted her teeth, making no attempt to move the thunder pearl.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The snake struck.</p><p>The thunder pearl spun, suddenly emitting a blinding light, shining like a star before exploding, unleashing a torrent of ferocious thunder, forming an astonishing thunderstorm in the air.</p><p>Rumble…</p><p>The thunder attack swallowed the monstrous serpent.</p><p>In that instant, pink lightning illuminated the entire ice cave, merging with the Lingbao cold flame and the blue light wave, creating a dreamlike spectacle within the ice cave.</p><p>This was the fifth treasure Yuefei had destroyed, following the veil, inner armor, butterfly tattoo, and talisman disc.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't help but marvel, truly worthy of her origins in Luye, truly worthy of being the adopted son of a Nascent Soul cultivator.  The fellow not only possessed many treasures, but he was incredibly generous to his beloved concubine.</p><p>Unfortunately, while these thunder beads excelled in their strange corrosive ability, their power couldn't compare to true divine thunder. Even with the thunder beads exploding, they couldn't stop the serpent; delaying it for a short time was the limit.</p><p>The thunder roared, at its peak, when a point of cold light suddenly appeared in the center. Through the gaps, one could see the serpent's gaping maw and a dark sun accumulating in its throat.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The serpent merged with the cold flame and directly broke through the thunder attack!</p><p>Yuefei's watery eyes reflected the cold flame's shadow, a resolute look flashing across her face.</p><p>Without dodging or weaving, the crimson blood moon on her forehead glowed brightly. She didn't retreat, but instead advanced, a sly smile playing on her lips, charging towards the cold flame with her blood-colored array.</p><p>Qin Sang never expected the sorceress's self-sacrificial act.</p><p>"Does she really think a mere talisman disc can withstand a spiritual treasure?"</p><p>Qin Sang's face darkened, a cold snort escaping his lips.  He certainly wouldn't miss this opportunity.</p><p>As she wished, he would grant her a quick death!</p><p>In an instant.</p><p>The cold flame reached her.</p><p>The blood-colored array bore the brunt of the attack.</p><p>Wherever the cold flame passed, the talisman shadows quickly vanished, the blood light fading rapidly as the cold flame forcibly carved a path.</p><p>In that moment, the terrifying pressure from the cold flame nearly suffocated Yuefei.</p><p>Yuefei's smile twisted into a terrifying grimace, but the blood moon on her forehead became even more vibrant.</p><p>Then, a green light flickered between her eyes, revealing the phantom of her Nascent Soul.</p><p>As expected, Yuefei's Nascent Soul was small and cute, its eyes closed, yet it seemed to always carry a seductive smile, its charm innate.</p><p>The Nascent Soul appeared, yet didn't fully emerge.</p><p>On the Nascent Soul's forehead, there was also a blood moon seal. Lu Laomo's Dark Moon Seal controlled the body, Nascent Soul, and spirit, incredibly vicious; Dark Moon Guards spent their lives as slaves!</p><p>The two blood moons merged.</p><p>Swish!</p><p>Yuefei's physical body and Nascent Soul opened their eyes simultaneously.</p><p>At the same time, the cold flame pierced through the blood array and rushed towards her!</p><p>The cold flame's light illuminated Yuefei's contorted face.</p><p>Yuefei tilted her head slightly, offering no resistance, but the blood moon on her forehead shone intensely.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The moment the blood moon and cold flame collided.</p><p>Yuefei suddenly moved.  She wasn't resisting the cold flame, but instead, was internally attacking the Dark Moon Seal.</p><p>Attacked from within and without.</p><p>The blood light dimmed.</p><p>Crack!</p><p>The Dark Moon Seal was instantly swallowed by the cold flame.</p><p>The cold flame was inches away, Yuefei's soul about to be frozen solid.</p><p>In the final moment before death, Yuefei used all her strength to gather the power of the Dark Moon Guards to her forehead.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The cold flame surged past.</p><p>Yuefei's brains splattered, leaving a headless corpse, frozen solid, flung far away, eventually torn to shreds by the light wave, leaving no trace of her remains.</p><p>Only a damaged Nascent Soul remained, barely clinging to life.</p><p>Qin Sang frowned.</p><p>At the last moment, he sensed something was wrong and forcibly retracted some of his power; otherwise, Yuefei's Nascent Soul would have been annihilated before it could use its teleportation technique.</p><p>"You!"</p><p>Qin Sang stared at Yuefei's damaged Nascent Soul, vaguely guessing something.</p><p>"Cough…"</p><p>The Nascent Soul's breath was weak, yet it still maintained that sly smile, "Thank you, sir, for using the spiritual treasure to help me escape the clutches of the demon."</p><p>"It wasn't necessary," Qin Sang shook his head, still somewhat bewildered.  He was anxious to save her, speaking as he dashed towards the light pillar.</p><p>"It's better to fight for a chance at life than to be refined into a corpse-soul."</p><p>The Nascent Soul's breath quickly faded, muttering incoherent words.</p><p>She was Su Zinan's Yuefei, the most powerful, beautiful, and favored among all his concubines. Other concubines would respectfully call her "Elder Sister."</p><p>But she saw clearly: to Su Zinan, she was merely a plaything.</p><p>Even as a plaything, she was content; she was used to pleasing men.</p><p>The numerous treasures in Luye were at her disposal; she considered it exchanging her body for cultivation resources.</p><p>Su Zinan, a man known for his coldness and fickleness, would never be devoted to a single woman. However, given his nature, he would treat her as his possession, and even if he tired of her, he would never let her leave alive.</p><p>Other concubines were thrown into snake pits, but Su Zinan kept her alive because she still had value.</p><p>He was waiting for the Three Corpses Death Banner to be completed!</p><p>The Moon Shadow Seal,  Lu Lao Mo's signature spell, was the most terrifying shackle in the world. Life and death were entirely at the owner's whim; she was powerless to resist.</p><p>She had spent countless years trying to break the seal, only to meet with despair.</p><p>She was confined to Luye, and even when she had the opportunity to accompany Su Zinan on outings, she was required to stay by his side.</p><p>Until today, someone broke into the tomb of the Water Aspect Lord, a place Su Zinan coveted.  Wu Lao and the others happened to be absent, and Su Zinan was cultivating in a medicinal bath, giving her a brief window of opportunity.</p><p>The Moon Shadow Seal was extremely vicious.</p><p>Her plan was to concentrate all her Moon Shadow Seal power, using external pressure to suppress the seal and separate a part of her soul for a body snatching rebirth.</p><p>But she had to seize the timing precisely; the external force could not be too weak or too strong, otherwise it would lead to her demise.</p><p>Even more desperate, this method wouldn't completely free her from the Moon Shadow Seal. She could only weaken the mark on the separated soul, preventing Su Zinan from directly sensing it, and plotting her escape later.</p><p>She left behind a physical body in the snow—a poor woman who was supposed to be thrown into a snake pit, but whom she secretly saved.</p><p>She herself came to die.</p><p>After entering the ice cave, she secretly set up a formation to transfer her separated soul and actively sought death.</p><p>When Su Zinan finished his cultivation and arrived, he only saw her corpse.</p><p>This prevented Su Zinan from immediately discovering her actions, giving the separated soul time to escape.</p><p>The Moon Concubine had to act convincingly, without giving Su Zinan any reason to suspect her.</p><p>This man, though Su Zinan's adopted son, was only interested in women and lacked arrogance; he was also shrewd.</p><p>Once Su Zinan suspected anything and used his cultivation to sense the Moon Shadow Seal, he would detect the presence of the separated soul, rendering her efforts useless, with disastrous consequences.</p><p>Therefore,</p><p>After entering the ice cave, the Moon Concubine remained silent, attacking Qin Sang and Yan Shan Lao Ren and seizing the cold crystal.</p><p>She wasn't actually interested in the crystal; she wanted to provoke Yan Shan Lao Ren and Qin Sang, forcing them to attack, thus helping her sever her soul. She deliberately hid the Moon Shadow Seal to avoid being recognized, knowing they wouldn't dare to attack.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Qin Sang was only interested in the crystal, striking only once before ignoring her and focusing on breaking the formation.</p><p>Yan Shan Lao Ren adopted a defensive posture.</p><p>Su Zinan could arrive at any moment, yet she couldn't even die.</p><p>The Moon Concubine didn't know that her luck was exceptionally bad. Wu Lao happened to return and arrived early, though thankfully he was stopped by Qin Sang’s true form.</p><p>When the killing formation erupted, its power was enough to shatter the Moon Shadow Seal. However, because it happened so suddenly, the Moon Concubine didn't have time to prepare and could only dodge. She then attacked Qin Sang relentlessly, forcing the treasure out of him, finally allowing her to achieve her goal.</p><p>“The old demon is dead, young master, you don’t need to fear. But Su Zinan will soon complete the Three Corpses Death Banner, so be careful in the future.”</p><p>The Moon Concubine's separated soul had successfully escaped. The remaining infant body was meant to die, a smile on her face, she used her last strength to look at Qin Sang, “As thanks, let me give you a warning. This place is the tomb of the Water Aspect Lord of the Wu Xiang Immortal Sect. Your companion is the Water Aspect’s successor; we have our eyes on him and he won't die so easily. Judging by your appearance, you seem unaware…"</p><p>Four serpentine seals hovered above her head.</p><p>Qin Sang appeared beside the pillar of light.  The Heaven Eye Butterfly used its divine ability to the maximum, but the interior of the light column was nothing but waves of intense light. No one was there.</p><p>The Primal Yuan Heavy Water on the ground had also evaporated.</p><p>Hearing the Moon Concubine's words, Qin Sang's face changed drastically.  He turned around just as her primordial spirit dissipated, her cultivation vanishing.</p><p>Outside the snowfield.</p><p>A coffin lay buried in the snow, a beautiful girl lying inside, her chest rising and falling slightly, still breathing, not dead.</p><p>The coffin was engraved with blood-red runes, clearly a magical artifact that concealed her presence.</p><p>Suddenly, a white shadow flew into the coffin, merging into the girl's body.</p><p>The girl’s eyes widened, her breathing quickened, fear and pain filling her eyes. She struggled and tried to scream, but she covered her mouth with her right hand, unable to make a sound.</p><p>The space inside the coffin was cramped, and she seemed to be wrestling with an invisible ghost. Veins bulged in her neck, her body convulsing violently before she finally collapsed.</p><p>Her eyes closed weakly, seeming lifeless.</p><p>After a moment, the girl's eyes opened again, but her eyes were completely different, a similar sly smile to the Moon Concubine playing on her lips.</p><p>"Such a waste of cultivation…"</p><p>The girl sighed soundlessly, but her expression was one of relief.</p><p>She fumbled for a pouch in her bosom, took out several pills, swallowed them all, didn't get up, and steered the coffin through the snow layer, in the direction opposite to Luye.</p><p>She began slowly and cautiously, then accelerated.</p><p>—</p><p>—</p><p>(I stayed up until 3 am revising this several times.)</p>
