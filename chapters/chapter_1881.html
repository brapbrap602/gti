<h1>Chapter 1872: The Vajra</h1><p>‘Whoosh…’</p><p>‘Bang! Bang! Bang!’</p><p>The flower field shook violently, with some mountains cracking and huge rocks rolling down.  They were about to crash into the flowerbeds, but were deflected by an unseen force.</p><p>Qin Sang was under immense pressure, sweat beading on his forehead.</p><p>The Healing Altar was in constant turmoil, and he dared not relax for a moment.  Multiple breaches had appeared in the flower field array.  Qin Sang summoned the Yunyou Sword and deployed the Seven Constellations Division Sword Array to stabilize the formation, but he couldn't reverse the trend of the flower field's collapse.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>A tremendous sound echoed from the ground, unlike anything he'd heard before.</p><p>Qin Sang's face changed.  His spiritual sense swept across the field, and he immediately discovered a tear in the edge of the flower field.</p><p>Immediately afterwards, tearing sounds erupted from all directions, and the flower field began to shatter from the outside in.</p><p>After some thought, Qin Sang decided to consolidate the power of the flower field array to protect the flower spirits.  The outer areas would have to be abandoned.</p><p>‘Bang! Bang! Bang!’</p><p>Chunks of rock fell from the earth, mountain peaks collapsed, and cracks continued to spread inward.</p><p>The flower spirits were planted in flowerbeds built on piles of bones, located in the center of the flower field space. However, their root systems were connected to the earth's energy veins, so this would have an immeasurable impact on them.</p><p>Qin Sang had no better solution. He could only ensure the flower spirits survived, and then gradually restore them after the Healing Altar calmed down. This was better than uprooting them entirely.</p><p>‘Rumble…’</p><p>The tremors continued to emanate from outside.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't tell whether it was the illusory storm, the outside battle, or a combination of both.</p><p>He looked up. The illusory landscape and auspicious clouds blocked his view of what lay beyond the Healing Altar, but a persistent feeling of oppression weighed on his heart – an instinctive dread, a fear of powerful beings.</p><p>As expected, powerful cultivators at the Unity stage must be battling. The energy within the Healing Altar was too chaotic; Qin Sang couldn’t distinguish how many such cultivators were involved.</p><p>However, Qin Sang wasn't as tense as before. The initial oppressive feeling had come from above the Healing Altar, but it had gradually moved away, reducing the chances of the Healing Altar being affected.</p><p>Now he only needed to worry about the illusory storm.</p><p>After a long time, Qin Sang sensed a change in the tremors, and a look of joy appeared on his face.</p><p>"It's finally weakening…"</p><p>The next moment, the smile on Qin Sang's face froze.  He quickly formed hand seals, his true energy surging forth as he exerted all his strength to condense nine spirit seals, which he flicked towards the nine most important nodes of the array.</p><p>Simultaneously, an extremely powerful wave spread from the depths of the Healing Altar, causing all affected illusions to erupt with astonishing phenomena.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>A thunderous roar echoed through the space.</p><p>The earth was ripped open by a fissure that ran across the entire landmass, nearly splitting the flower field in two.</p><p>Several flowerbeds were unfortunately situated within the crack. Luckily, Qin Sang was quick-witted. With a sweep of his sleeve, he uprooted the flower spirits, one by one.</p><p>‘Pfft!’</p><p>The bones turned to dust.  These flowerbeds were virtually unusable.</p><p>The uprooted flower spirits tightly closed their buds, their spiritual light dimming, indicating severe damage to their vitality.</p><p>Fortunately, this violent tremor only lasted a moment.</p><p>After the tremors subsided, the illusory storm seemed to have reached its limit, ceasing its expansion.  The previous intensification was more like a last gasp.</p><p>Tremors still continued, but within a manageable range.</p><p>After waiting a while longer, Qin Sang confirmed that the storm would not expand further, and finally relaxed. He looked down at the flower field below and descended.</p><p>After surveying the area, Qin Sang began to work, his figure darting around the flower field as he inspected the damaged areas of the array.</p><p>Finally, Qin Sang selected materials from his Qianjun Ring, summoned the Nine Netherworld Demon Fire, and on-site refined array tools to repair the array.</p><p>To fully restore the array, he would need to return to the Ju Shan mountain range to purchase many more materials.</p><p>After much effort, Qin Sang reactivated the array, and the outer barrier of the space immediately became much more stable.</p><p>He finally had time to check on the flower spirits. After examining them, he sighed softly.</p><p>The flower field was saved, but the flower spirits were in poor condition.</p><p>Besides those he had uprooted, the surviving flower spirits were also weak and damaged.</p><p>The flower spirits were inherently delicate. Even if the Healing Altar and flower field returned to normal, it would take time for them to recover.  Until then, the source of flower dew would be a problem.</p><p>"Luckily, I still have the poisonous fruits…"</p><p>Qin Sang replanted the uprooted flower spirits in other flowerbeds.  These flower spirits would recover even more slowly, possibly taking over a hundred years.</p><p>The illusory storm's effects on Qin Sang didn't end there.</p><p>Although the storm had stopped expanding, it hadn’t subsided.  The tremors continued, and the energy within the Healing Altar remained incredibly chaotic, affecting this place as well.</p><p>Until the storm calmed, the Healing Altar would be unsuitable for cultivation; it could only be used as a flower garden.</p><p>"Looks like I'll have to return to Sword Heart Island."</p><p>Qin Sang pondered.</p><p>After waiting for a long time, he flew outside the great formation, directly facing the shockwaves.</p><p>Leaving the flower field, he traveled along familiar paths, the sights both familiar and strange.</p><p>The surrounding illusions had changed somewhat; past experience wasn't entirely applicable.</p><p>But the storm's center wasn't nearby, not completely chaotic; some old routes were still passable.</p><p>Qin Sang investigated, then carefully explored towards the center of the altar.</p><p>He followed a path he'd previously opened, but the further he went, the harder it became.  With the Tianmu Butterfly's help, Qin Sang pressed on, until he saw the illusory storm firsthand.</p><p>Through fragmented illusions, he saw a gray expanse, like a roaring hurricane, internally chaotic.</p><p>Qin Sang's last shred of hope vanished.</p><p>The location of the Chijin Spiritual Needle was inside the illusory storm!</p><p>Even if he brought Mo Xingdao, finding a scene matching his memory here would be impossible.</p><p>The path to ascension was uncertain.</p><p>How long would the illusory storm last? Decades? Centuries? Millennia? Would it even return to normal?</p><p>“Will I just have to cultivate here, subservient to the Dao Court?”</p><p>Qin Sang frowned, observing for a long time.  Suddenly, his eyes flashed, fixated on a spot.</p><p>Gradually, his expression relaxed. He noticed the storm was receding, albeit slowly—a good sign.</p><p>Moreover, as the storm subsided, the illusions there seemed to be reforming, indicating the foundation remained.</p><p>“I wonder if the illusions at the storm's center will recover. There might still be a chance.  I should prepare…”</p><p>Qin Sang thought of the Taiyi Star Chart.</p><p>If he were to enter the storm later, he might rely on the Taiyi Star Chart. He decided to focus on improving his artifact refinement skills after reaching the late Nascent Soul stage, to repair the treasure.</p><p>After pondering, Qin Sang observed for a while longer, then retreated the way he came. He didn't return to his cave dwelling, but headed straight for the altar's exit.</p><p>It was the tenth day after the great battle.</p><p>The altar seemed deserted. He met no other cultivators or demon lords on his way. Reaching the auspicious clouds at the altar's edge, he used the Tianmu Butterfly's vision to see that the outside was quiet, devoid of any figures.</p><p>Outside the altar lay a vast plain. The towering mountains on the other side of the plain were leveled, the earth in disarray.</p><p>Although the battlefield had been cleaned, the stench of blood lingered, indicating the ferocity of the final battle.</p><p>He’d intentionally waited several days to avoid being caught in the fighting, so he didn't know who had won.</p><p>The battlefield's aura was extremely mixed, filled with the frenzied energy of demonic beasts, making it difficult to discern anything.</p><p>Qin Sang looked up at the sky.</p><p>The sky was overcast, shrouded in a persistent gloom.</p><p>He knew this wasn't a normal weather change, but the lingering effects of a battle between powerful cultivators.</p><p>Sensing the residual aura, Qin Sang felt a jolt of fear.  Undoubtedly, it was left by Unity stage cultivators, and the energy was chaotic, far more than two or three.</p><p>The lingering aura indicated the battle had moved deep into the Evil Origin, but the outcome remained unknown.</p><p>Qin Sang stayed outside the altar for a while, then returned to his cave dwelling. He needed more time to observe before leaving safely.</p><p>…</p><p>Inside the cave dwelling.</p><p>Qin Sang took medicine, sat cross-legged, recovering from his injuries, then slowly awoke.</p><p>As the saying goes, misfortune often harbors good fortune, and vice versa.</p><p>In this upheaval, Qin Sang lost much, but also gained greatly.</p><p>Battling demon lords and slaying demon kings, after this battle, reaching the late Nascent Soul stage was imminent.</p><p>Left Zhenren had intended to recruit him and guide him in the Void Refinement path, but the intervention of the Demon Saint disrupted their plans, and the final battle didn't happen, giving Qin Sang a lucky break.</p><p>He still needed to exchange his merits for it, but Left Zhenren wouldn't have been so dedicated if the situation hadn't been urgent.</p><p>Speaking of gains, it's necessary to mention the beginning of it all.</p><p>The Qianjun Ring shone, shooting two golden rays that landed in Qin Sang's palm, shimmering brightly.</p><p>The King Kong Fruit was heavy.</p><p>“King Kong Fruit, the fruit of the King Kong Bodhi tree, containing the essence of the treasure tree, ranked among the ten divine trees, renowned as the most firm and unyielding wood…”</p><p>Qin Sang recalled information about the King Kong Fruit.</p><p>It was said that treasures refined with King Kong Fruit were exceptionally hard, almost indestructible.  But using it to refine a sword wasn't wasteful; weaponry made from it was incredibly sharp, specifically designed to break defensive abilities.</p><p>“Even with only two, I can significantly strengthen the Cloud Wanderer Sword's blade…”</p><p>Qin Sang mused, summoning the Cloud Wanderer Sword and storing one King Kong Fruit within it.</p><p>‘嗡！’</p><p>The spiritual sword hummed, its light enveloping the King Kong Fruit.</p><p>The sentient sword seemed to know the King Kong Fruit was a good thing, eager to absorb its power.</p><p>Qin Sang smiled, silently cultivating his inner energy to guide the Yunyou Sword in absorbing the divine wood.  The sword light drew the Vajra Fruit, slowly rising from Qin Sang's palm. The fruit rotated within the sword light, its outer shell beginning to melt.  Witnessing this long-awaited sight, Qin Sang felt a surge of emotion, but quickly composed himself, focusing all his energy on controlling the sword.</p><p>Finally, the Yunyou Sword transformed into its nascent form, swallowing the Vajra Fruit and absorbing its purest spiritual wood essence. The nascent sword hung before him. Qin Sang carefully sensed it, then nodded subtly after a moment. The Yunyou Sword had advanced to a spiritual treasure, far surpassing its former self; its absorption of divine wood was far faster than before, and it wouldn't take long to fully "digest" the Vajra Fruit.</p><p>He put away the spiritual sword. Next, Qin Sang carefully took out his other spoils of war, categorizing and counting them before remembering the two captives in the altar. A female demon's spirit essence, and a demon marquis under the command of the Lingyou King. Continuing cultivation in the altar with them present would be inconvenient. Since he had decided to return to Sword Heart Island to cultivate, he could leave them behind.</p><p>His path to ascension was uncertain, and he only had Mo Xingdao as an assistant—he lacked manpower. Both demons were pragmatic, so subduing them shouldn't be difficult. However, Qin Sang didn't rush to release them. He rose, left the cave, glanced around, and leaped out of the flower field.</p><p>Two months had passed, and the tremors from the storm still lingered. The surrounding illusions were slightly more stable than before.  After a short journey, Qin Sang appeared above the blue light sea. He looked down at the surface, sensed it, and plunged into the light sea, diving at high speed directly towards the location of the幽谷 . However, all he found was endless blue. The valley had vanished.</p><p>Qin Sang was persistent, searching for a long time, even expending his vital essence to help the Heavenly Eye Butterfly use its powers, but found no trace of the valley.  Suspended in the ocean floor, Qin Sang fell into deep thought. The金刚菩提树  hadn't vanished like the other bubbles; he felt instinctively that they still existed, but didn't know where. Though the valley had appeared there, other entrances might exist elsewhere. But the blue light sea was vast, and the pressure he felt here was immense; searching inch by inch would take an eternity.</p><p>"I'll come back another time," he murmured.</p><p>Qin Sang burst from the sea as a bolt of lightning, returned to his cave dwelling for a brief check, and then flew towards the altar's exit.  Outside the altar, a deathly silence reigned. Unsure of the current situation, Qin Sang didn't dare head straight for Star Island's celestial lake. He first went west, making a large detour, and finally reached the  白石治  via the 具山治 .</p><p>He proceeded cautiously along the way, without incident, and successfully reached Baishichi, where he sensed a tense atmosphere. After some discreet inquiries, he learned that the Celestial Court and the Gui Fang Kingdom were frantically massing troops at the Yellow Springs Path, war imminent.</p><p>One piece of news left Qin Sang perplexed.  Recently, the Celestial Court had announced that the Palace Master of Yin Tian Palace had joined the Northern Pole Exorcism Academy, receiving the title of Ninth Heaven Golden Que Upper Immortal, Ninth Heaven Inspector, a rank of Zheng Sanpin. The Academy had held a grand celebration in the altar for this occasion, with a True Monarch even issuing an imperial decree—a grand honor.</p><p>In Qin Sang's understanding, True Monarchs didn't concern themselves with mundane affairs, and Zheng Sanpin was the highest rank for Celestial Court officials, a true ruler of a region. Zheng Sanpin officials were certainly few in number; even with late Nascent Soul cultivation, insufficient merit and seniority would disqualify one.</p><p>The relationship between the Celestial Court and Daoist temples was delicate; though various sects' masters could hold positions in the Court, reaching this level was likely difficult. What merit did the Yin Tian Palace Master possess? Moreover, Yin Tian Palace was also a Daoist sect, located on the Yellow Springs Path, relentlessly eradicating demons and monsters—certainly with the Celestial Court's backing.  Their relationship was already close; wasn't this move redundant?</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't understand. He returned to Jushan with these questions, finding the atmosphere even tenser than in Baishichi. With war imminent, Jushan would be at the forefront, and cultivators lived in constant fear.  Entering Star Island's celestial lake, Qin Sang was even stopped for inspection, only gaining passage by presenting the Sword Heart Island token given to him by the Master of Swords.</p><p>Back on Sword Heart Island, Jian Nu sensed the activation of the array and immediately came to greet him. "This servant greets the Master."</p><p>Though they were already familiar, Jian Nu still performed the ritual flawlessly.  Qin Sang had tried several times to dissuade him, but to no avail, so he simply let it be, stepping ashore, and looking towards the Master of Swords' cave dwelling. "Is Daoist Friend Zhizhan on the island?"</p><p>Jian Nu nodded. "The master has been in seclusion, and has not emerged. If the Master has urgent business, this old servant will awaken him."</p><p>"No need! This Daoist intends to remain on Sword Heart Island to cultivate.  Just inform Daoist Friend Zhizhan once he emerges."</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head, stopping Jian Nu, and walked towards his own cave.  He had intended to ask the Master of Swords about his relationship with Master Zuo, but there would be ample opportunities later—there was no rush.</p>
