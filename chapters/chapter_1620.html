<h1>Chapter 1611: The Heavenly Veil Formation</h1><p>Mount Tai Sect.</p><p>Located in the Southern Frontier, Mount Tai Sect, while not as adept at using insect poisons as the Wan Du Mountain, still has numerous disciples cultivating such arts, particularly in the use of poisons.  In low-level cultivator duels, these poisons often prove incredibly effective.</p><p>Furthermore, some potent poisons can be obtained externally, eliminating the need for arduous cultivation, making them quicker to utilize than other arts.  Because of this, other sects greatly fear both Mount Tai Sect and Wan Du Mountain.</p><p>All seemed normal within the sect.</p><p>With the grand ceremony approaching, many Mount Tai Sect disciples had gone to attend; some accompanying their elders, others seeking freedom, traveling north by boat with friends, taking the opportunity to explore the world.</p><p>The sect had become considerably quieter.</p><p>In the past, Foundation Establishment and Golden Core masters constantly came and went from the mountain gate. Today, however, several hours passed without a single one appearing.  The disciples on guard duty were bored and drowsy.</p><p>“It’s almost noon,”</p><p>A young-looking boy stretched, squinting at the sun overhead.  “Brother Wu and the others will be here soon to relieve us. Sigh! The Ullambana Festival is almost here, but I chickened out at the last moment and didn't dare to push through my bottleneck. Otherwise, I would have had a chance to attend the ceremony.  It's a quincentennial event!  Golden Core cultivators only live for five hundred years, missing this would be a lifelong regret!”</p><p>The thin youth beside him looked listless.  “The sect doesn't restrict our movements. If you want to go so badly, find someone to cover your shift and travel with someone like Sister Liu Si – wouldn’t that be much more enjoyable?”</p><p>Fear flickered across the boy’s face, and he shook his head repeatedly. “I heard that the Northern Wasteland demons are frequently attacking the south, and Jade State is quite unstable. Those demons don’t care what sect you're from; they’re bloodthirsty. If you fall into their hands, you'll meet the same end! With my cultivation, if they swallow me whole, I'd have nowhere to cry for justice.”</p><p>“Such a coward!”</p><p>The youth scoffed.</p><p>The boy retorted, “Brother Li, you’re so brave, why don’t you go?”</p><p>“I’m not interested in that ridiculous ceremony. I’d rather spend that time practicing more spells and improving my self-preservation techniques,” the youth said dismissively.</p><p>The boy wasn't so easily fooled.  “I heard there's a duel at the ceremony, and the Nascent Soul masters from each sect will personally participate. Watching those powerful cultivators duel – isn't that better than just practicing alone?”</p><p>“Small ability, big ambitions!  Can you even understand Nascent Soul duels?”</p><p>The youth retorted, about to continue lecturing his junior disciple, when he felt a sudden chill. He instinctively looked up at the sky and froze, his mouth agape.</p><p>At the same time, the boy also felt the light suddenly dim.</p><p>In their field of vision, a black curtain appeared in the sky, expanding from within the sect outwards.  It wasn't like a cloud, but more like a black cloth, spreading rapidly until it covered the entire Mount Tai Sect.</p><p>Below the curtain was pure darkness; the intense sunlight couldn't penetrate at all.</p><p>The curtain originated from within the sect, seemingly near the forbidden area.  Whether it was a sect incident or a grand display of power by a sect master remained unknown.</p><p>When the curtain covered them, night fell, plunging them into darkness where even their companion was invisible.</p><p>“What time is it?”</p><p>“Why is it dark?”</p><p>…</p><p>Chaos erupted around them.</p><p>The youth finally reacted, quickly forming a hand seal.  A yellow light flickered from his fingertips, and a luminous pearl slowly ascended. His other hand reached for the communication token at his waist.</p><p>But the token remained unresponsive.</p><p>The lack of response heightened the youth's anxiety. He shouted, “Form the array quickly!”</p><p>Following a brief commotion, an eerie silence descended.</p><p>The youth's heart sank.  Using the luminous pearl's light, he saw the boy he’d been arguing with moments ago; his expression was rigid, his face ashen, like a walking corpse.</p><p>Terror surged through him.</p><p>The next moment, before he could react, the youth froze in place, the light in his eyes fading rapidly as he joined the boy.</p><p>Before the Mount Tai Sect gate, one guard disciple after another stood like wooden posts.</p><p>They died without ever knowing why or who their killer was!</p><p>An evil wind swept in, and a gray mist shot out, passing through the corpses and forming a figure before the gate.  The figure wore a gray robe, their face completely concealed. Judging by the figure's build and slender fingers, it was a female cultivator.</p><p>The female cultivator took out an empty crystal vial, opened the stopper, and gently moved her fingers.  One after another, illusory soul shadows flew from the corpses and were collected into the vial.</p><p>"They’re all low-level disciples, hardly worth mentioning.  If you need soul bodies, little sister, I'll give you a few vials."</p><p>A chilling voice, growing closer, materialized beside the female cultivator.  The figure, also in grey robes, was a man.</p><p>"I wouldn't dare take anything belonging to Brother Liao."</p><p>The female cultivator instinctively stepped aside as the man approached, capping the vial and shaking it with satisfaction.  "After all, they are disciples of a major sect. Their foundations are solid, their primordial spirits refined. Brother's soul might not be comparable."</p><p>The man chuckled. "Even Buddhism has the 'Joyful Zen'.  Why should we, cultivators of the demonic path, be bound by convention?  Today, under the open sky, is a day for revelry! When will you stop being so wary of your senior brother?"</p><p>"When my demonic arts are complete, my chastity will be for sale. Senior brother, if your offer surpasses Master's, I wouldn't mind a brief affair."</p><p>The woman's words silenced the man. She turned towards the Taiyue Sect restricted area. "It's a pity the sect has us guarding the mountain gate. We won't encounter high-level cultivators."</p><p>The man said calmly, "Don't you see Master's care, little sister? This is Taiyue Sect. A full-scale counterattack from the sect is no small matter... Uh! Someone's coming!"</p><p>The black curtain extended to the edge of Taiyue Sect and stopped.</p><p>Taiyue Sect was deathly silent, yet from the outside, it appeared sunny and beautiful, with birds singing and flowers blooming – everything normal.</p><p>Two figures, a man and a woman, both Taiyue Sect disciples, flew in from afar.  They had just returned from the Southlands with a significant harvest, planning to return to the sect for seclusion. Little did they know their sect had been overrun by demons.  They flew towards the mountain gate, laughing and chatting.</p><p>In an instant, their smiles froze, and they fell silently to the ground, their bodies thudding heavily.</p><p>Similar scenes played out repeatedly outside Taiyue Sect.  Taiyue Sect, one of the top sects in the Nineteen States of Rain and Mist, had become a bloody hell!</p><p>…</p><p>Taiyue Sect Restricted Area.</p><p>Tenglong Cliff.</p><p>This place is where the Taiyue Sect's successive sect masters cultivated in seclusion. Only Grand Masters, or Yuan Ying cultivators nearing breakthrough, are qualified to choose a cave dwelling on Tenglong Cliff.</p><p>Below Tenglong Cliff is a bottomless abyss.</p><p>Legend has it that in ancient times, a dragon emerged from the abyss and ascended to the heavens, hence the name.</p><p>A strange wind blows incessantly on Tenglong Cliff, possessing a soul-eroding power.  Cultivators with insufficient cultivation cannot stand their ground.</p><p>At this moment, a group of figures appeared on Tenglong Cliff, a rarely visited place.</p><p>These people were divided into two groups.</p><p>Some stood scattered on the protruding rocks of the cliff face, mostly Golden Core cultivators. After a while, some couldn't endure it and flew back to the top of the cliff.</p><p>They all wore grey robes, concealing their identities.  However, judging from the magical powers they used to resist the strange wind, they were likely several forces working together.</p><p>Before the cliff wall, others stood suspended in the air.</p><p>The black strange wind blew up from the abyss, with the force of a hurricane.  Yet, it parted silently near them, not even ruffling their clothes, forming a stark contrast to the people on the cliff face.</p><p>These people maintained a certain distance from each other, their factions clearly distinct.</p><p>They no longer needed to conceal their identities.</p><p>Among them were Qin Sang's old acquaintances.</p><p>Su Zinan and Mo Xingdao remained inseparable, but this time there were no冥月卫 (Mingyue Guards) by their side.</p><p>The Scarred-Face Man and the Crying Spirit Cave Master stood side by side, seemingly communicating through voice transmission. The Scarred-Face Man's facial scar was lighter than before, barely allowing one to see the outline of his features.</p><p>The two groups stood left and right, with another larger group in the middle, led by a white-haired elder.  Among them was the Cold Elder, who had given Qin Sang the Gu God Token.</p><p>On the outermost edge of the crowd, two figures stood apart, not belonging to any faction.</p><p>However, their auras were no weaker than Su Zinan's, clearly Grand Masters.</p><p>One was powerfully built, carrying a heavy sword sheathed in white cloth of unknown material.  His features were unremarkable, except for his extremely deep eyes, which seemed impervious to any emotion. He held an upside-down token.  The back of the token bore the character '土' (earth).</p><p>The swordsman intently watched the white-haired elder, saying nothing.</p><p>The other, dressed in white robes, wore a blue mask that covered his face. The mask seemed incredibly soft, like flowing water, yet no one could see through this 'water' to see his face; it only reflected the viewer's own image.</p><p>The figure in white sat cross-legged in mid-air, his hands resting on his knees, a piece of profound ice in his palms. It was similar in style to the swordsman's token, yet significantly different, like a replica.</p><p>Similarly, Su Zinan held a burning red jade.</p><p>The two refined their tokens while observing the white-haired elder.</p><p>"Alright! The formation is complete!"</p><p>The white-haired elder let out a breath, looked around at everyone, and said to those behind him, "Elder Yue must have had ulterior motives at the ceremony, taking away many experts. However, several powerful figures remain in the Taiyue Sect. Everyone must be vigilant! Junior brother, it's up to you to seal off the Taiyue Sect, ensuring no one escapes or sends out any messages."</p><p>The man accepted the order and left.</p><p>Those waiting on the cliff face also departed.</p><p>The strange-faced man said to the Cave Master, "Cave Master, please make a trip as well, to prevent any accidents and ruin our efforts. After today, the Wuxiang Immortal Sect will reappear in the world, and we only have one chance."</p><p>The Cave Master agreed and was about to leave when Su Zinan stopped him.</p><p>"It's best if Daoist Mo goes with the Cave Master to ensure everything goes without a hitch."</p><p>Su Zinan finished refining the red jade and looked at the white-haired elder, "We shouldn't need this many people to activate the Wuxiang Immortal Sect's grand formation, should we?"</p><p>The white-haired elder looked at the others and nodded, "Three genuine Five-Phase Tokens, two imitations, controlled by five Grand Cultivators, should give us a 70% chance of success. If not, we can ask Daoist Mo for reinforcements.  Daoist Su, although not a cultivator of the Fire Dao, your ability to use the Blood Dao to emulate other Daos is truly remarkable. I admire you! Without your help, we would only have at most a 50% chance."</p><p>Su Zinan chuckled, "It's all because you kept it from me. The Wuxiang Immortal Sect is merely a mere Nascent Soul inheritance. How are your ancestors any better than my foster father? Do you think I would be so easily fooled? Remember that enemy I asked you to investigate? If you had caught him, we would have gathered the Five-Phase Tokens long ago!"</p><p>Hearing this, everyone looked over.</p><p>"What do you mean, Daoist Su?" the white-haired elder asked curiously.</p><p>Su Zinan snorted, "You were the host of the Six-State Hall auction, weren't you? Don't you know this person's abilities? His fire manipulation skills are extremely powerful. He killed two mid-Transformation Stage demonic beasts with lightning speed, and even caused a late-Transformation Stage demon king to flee. Unless the rumors about the Wuxiang Immortal Sect are exaggerated, no sect in the world possesses fire manipulation skills superior to those of the Wuxiang Immortal Sect's legacy. This person is probably the Wuxiang Immortal Sect's Fire-Phase heir!"</p><p>The white-haired elder pondered, "This person's abilities are indeed extraordinary. However, it's said that he was able to kill those demonic beasts because he had secret help. The spiritual fire he used was also completely different from the records, unlike the Fire-Phase heir's. Furthermore, he only appeared once and then vanished without a trace.  Unless he shows himself, it's impossible to find him."</p><p>At this time, the strange-faced man, who had been listening, interjected, "Why does Daoist Su say that the Five-Phase Tokens can be gathered? Are you certain that this person has the Water and Fire Five-Phase Tokens?"</p><p>Su Zinan looked at the white-robed man who was focused on refining the Xuanbing ice, and said ambiguously, "We need to ask this Daoist friend."</p><p>The white-robed man slowly raised his head, his expression hidden behind his mask.</p><p>"What do you mean, Daoist Su? I have no connection with this person. I only heard of him from you today."</p><p>His tone was displeased, suspecting Su Zinan of framing him.</p><p>Su Zinan sized him up and changed the subject, "I'm not asking him, but about the whereabouts of the Water-Phase Token. Since you are the Water-Phase heir, why don't you have it?"</p><p>This was almost an accusation.</p><p>The white-robed man's voice held a hint of coldness, "Why should I necessarily have the Water-Phase Token? That Daoist friend holds the Earth-Phase Token but is not the Earth-Phase heir. Should Daoist Su also inquire about the origin of his token?"</p><p>The swordsman, who had been watching the scene unfold, was unexpectedly implicated, and he glanced at the white-robed man.</p><p>Su Zinan smiled, "Don't be angry, Daoist friend. I'm just curious about what happened to the Wuxiang Immortal Sect back then. So, you only obtained part of the Water-Phase inheritance and are not the true Water-Phase heir?"</p><p>The white-robed man reluctantly mumbled, "Correct!"</p><p>The white-haired elder intervened, "When the Wuxiang Immortal Sect was attacked by villains, the disciples scattered and fled, most only taking away parts of the inheritance. The true heirs may not have survived."</p><p>"I see! My apologies, Daoist friend."</p><p>Su Zinan nodded apologetically, "I have seen what appeared to be the tomb of the Water-Phase Master."</p><p>Before anyone could respond, he spread his hands, looking regretful, "Unfortunately, someone got there first. When I arrived, there were only ruins. So I couldn't be certain."</p><p>"Was it that person?"</p><p>Everyone finally understood why Su Zinan was pursuing that person so relentlessly; it wasn't just for revenge.</p><p>Learning this, they were also excited.</p><p>Unfortunately, this person has not appeared.</p><p>"It was him."</p><p>Su Zinan nodded.</p><p>—</p><p>—</p><p>I can’t believe you’re more interested in the second prize than I am…</p><p>It’s a Huawei phone.</p>
