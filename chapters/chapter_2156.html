<h1>Chapter 2146: First Omens Appear</h1><p>“This is this humble Daoist’s domain!”</p><p>Qin Sang arrived at the mountain peak, slowly ascending into the sky. He surveyed the vast expanse of mountains and plains stretching out before him.</p><p>Su Nu and Zhu Que were currently in secluded cultivation at Qingyang Temple. With three Soul Formation cultivators guarding the temple and having gained the recognition of the Zhu Yan Tribe, they were no longer a small tribe among the foreign races.</p><p>The four Serenity Altars had found their masters. Besides the originally appointed Li Yufu, Bao Xi, and Grandmaster Yun Xin, there was another chosen by the consensus of various powers.</p><p>This person, who styled himself as Daoist Shen Qian, was a cultivator from the Central Continent who rose to prominence after the upheaval of Heaven and Earth. He was a man adept at navigating all sides, maintaining amicable relations with both righteous and demonic factions, and even forging ties with the Eastern Sea demon clans and the Western Desert Buddhist sects. He was a rogue cultivator.</p><p>He had never joined any sect, yet not only did he successfully weather all the tribulations, but he also made numerous contributions, repeatedly breaking through bottlenecks through rewards, ultimately reaching this stage and becoming a Serenity Lord. His journey was filled with legendary hues.</p><p>Below the Serenity Altar, the official positions of various altars and branch altars were gradually being filled.</p><p>One corner of the Governing Altar was enveloped in demonic Qi, where Long Jing, under orders, led the demon soldiers to guard the area. The remaining demon soldiers were also dispatched to various locations, protecting Qingyang Prefecture.</p><p>Ji Hong led the elite Wu Clan members to plant Chihua trees.</p><p>Within Qingyang Prefecture, immortals, gods, humans, demons, and Wu Clan members each held their respective positions, presenting a scene of vitality and flourishing prosperity.</p><p>Just then, a message talisman arrived. Qin Sang swept it with his divine sense and learned that it was Shao Shi visiting. Shao Shi was still on his way, having sent a visiting card to Qingyang Temple in advance. Li Yufu happened to be at the temple and, upon receiving the card, hurriedly reported to Qin Sang.</p><p>“He arrived quickly!”</p><p>Qin Sang mused. Shao Shi arrived earlier than he expected. Without sending other messengers to probe his intentions, dispatching Shao Shi directly showed how determined the Imperial Lord was to acquire the Mirage Shell.</p><p>With one step, Qin Sang vanished from the Governing Altar.</p><p>…</p><p>Qingyang Temple.</p><p>On this day, the mountain gates suddenly opened wide, accompanied by the resounding of bells and drums—a ritual reserved for welcoming esteemed guests.</p><p>Qin Sang personally went out to greet him.</p><p>Outside the mountain, a rainbow bridge paved the way from the western horizon. Eight celestial horses drew a carriage along the rainbow bridge, arriving before Qingyang Temple in the blink of an eye.</p><p>Shao Shi stepped out of the carriage, cupping his hands with a smile: “This old man has come unannounced, disturbing True Person Qin.”</p><p>“Master Shao Shi’s presence brings honor to our humble temple!”</p><p>Qin Sang bowed, stepping aside to invite Shao Shi into the mountain.</p><p>Walking alongside Qin Sang, Shao Shi seemed to have forgotten their previous enmity, his tone cordial: “This old man’s surname is Si. Shao Shi is a title bestowed by the Imperial Lord, a mere formality. As the saying goes, 'No discord, no concord.' This old man admires True Person Qin immensely. I wonder if I have the honor of being called Daoist Si by True Person Qin?”</p><p>Si?</p><p>Qin Sang remembered Si Lu mentioning that one of the four great royal clans bore the surname Si, a rare surname among the Si You Clan.</p><p>Could Shao Shi be from the royal clan? Why did he join the Imperial Lord's ranks?</p><p>Qin Sang had no intention of delving into the hidden circumstances and grievances. Going with the flow, he said: “This humble Daoist is most honored.”</p><p>Shao Shi laughed heartily.</p><p>It was apparent that Shao Shi had little interest in tedious formalities. Qin Sang waved his hand to dismiss the others, inviting Shao Shi to the Welcoming Guest Peak.</p><p>Inside the grand hall, only Qin Sang and Shao Shi remained, sitting opposite each other.</p><p>Shao Shi glanced outside the mountain, sighing with emotion: “In just a few decades, True Person Qin’s domain has taken on a whole new look!”</p><p>“Daoist Si flatters me,” Qin Sang said.</p><p>Shao Shi shook his head slightly: “This old man trusts his intuition. If King Lu were to launch an attack now, this old man would竭力劝阻竭力劝阻竭力劝阻竭力劝阻竭力劝阻竭力劝阻竭力劝阻竭力劝阻竭力劝阻竭力劝阻竭力劝阻竭力劝阻竭力劝阻竭力劝阻竭力劝阻竭力劝阻竭力劝阻竭力劝阻 surely dissuade him, and perhaps spare the Lu Clan from disaster.”</p><p>Qin Sang responded with a smile, feigning ignorance: “Daoist Si wouldn't be here to mourn King Lu, would he?”</p><p>“True Person Qin jests. How could this old man’s intentions be hidden from you? The Lu Clan’s Mirage Shell should still be in True Person Qin’s possession, correct?” Shao Shi went straight to the point.</p><p>Qin Sang didn’t deny it, nodding: “Even if I were to trade it, I would prioritize the most powerful royal clan. During this time, many Si You Clan experts have contacted Daoist Si Lu, but they were all turned away.”</p><p>Shao Shi breathed a sigh of relief: “That’s good! I wonder what True Person Qin intends to do?”</p><p>“Did Daoist Si come here on behalf of the Imperial Lord? I wonder what conditions the Imperial Lord has promised?” Qin Sang didn’t answer, but countered with a question.</p><p>Qin Sang’s question was very direct, aiming straight at the other party's bottom line.</p><p>Shao Shi didn’t take it as an offense. Both parties were well aware of each other's intentions, so it was better to be straightforward. He frankly said: “It depends on True Person Qin’s wishes. It’s nothing more than pills, spirit treasures, or other rare treasures. As long as True Person Qin is willing to trade, and the requests are not too unreasonable, we will do our best to satisfy them.”</p><p>This condition could be considered extremely generous, equivalent to letting Qin Sang make any request.</p><p>The royal clan indeed had such confidence. However, Qin Sang keenly sensed something unusual. The Imperial Lord seemed a little too eager.</p><p>If the Imperial Lord had always been so generous, unconcerned about the price he offered, he should have sent Shao Shi long ago. The delay until now indicated that the Imperial Lord’s initial intention was to haggle for a while.</p><p>“Is the Sacred Ground about to open?” Qin Sang suddenly asked.</p><p>“True Person Qin is indeed astute.”</p><p>Shao Shi sighed, knowing he couldn’t hide it. The Sacred Ground was related to the interests of every tribe. As long as Qin Sang was willing to investigate, he would definitely find out.</p><p>The Imperial Lord didn’t expect the omens to appear so quickly, suddenly becoming urgent. After exchanging for the Mirage Shell, he still needed to analyze the information left by the previous owner, discern its authenticity, filter out opportunities, and devise strategies.</p><p>This information was invaluable. The royal clan had long coveted other Mirage Shells, but unfortunately, they couldn’t seize them without cause, or they wouldn’t be able to justify their actions to the ancestors within the Sacred Ground.  Back then, the Imperial Lord prevented King Lu from annihilating the Si Clan because the whereabouts of the Yanshan Si Clan's Mirage Shell were unknown.</p><p>“It is rumored that faint omens have appeared in the Tainted Lands, awaiting confirmation, but it shouldn’t be far from the great tide. Even if not this time, it will surely be the next low tide.”</p><p>Like the minor tides, the great tides of Tainted Qi had no fixed time, only a rough estimated range. Minor tides could differ by over a decade, while great tides could differ by centuries.</p><p>Once the omens appeared, it would arrive soon.</p><p>Presumably, Patriarch Yuan Xiang hadn't sent a message because it hadn't been confirmed yet. If the next low tide was the great tide, there were only a few decades left.</p><p>Qin Sang had previously heard True Person Ning say it was within a thousand years, thinking he had ample time.  He couldn't help but feel fortunate that he chose to improve his strength first, allowing him to refine the Heaven-Trapping Golden Lock before the next low tide.</p><p>Shao Shi was unusually frank.</p><p>Qin Sang realized, wasn’t this precisely the situation he wanted?</p><p>After pondering for a moment, Qin Sang looked at Shao Shi: "This humble Daoist hasn't been injured, nor do I lack spirit treasures.  However, having heard various rumors about the Sacred Ground, although I'm from a foreign race, I can't help but yearn for it, filled with curiosity and anticipation…"</p><p>Shao Shi exclaimed in surprise: “True Person Qin intends to…?”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded.</p><p>“That's impossible!”</p><p>Shao Shi shook his head repeatedly, stating decisively: “True Person Qin is not a descendant of our foreign race. How can the Sacred Ground allow outsiders to enter…”</p><p>“Is there truly no possibility?” Qin Sang interrupted Shao Shi.  “Has there never been a precedent in the Si You Clan, or even the entire foreign race?  This humble Daoist vaguely heard that there's a rule in the ancient covenant…”</p><p>Shao Shi froze, a strange look on his face.</p><p>This rule had never been used by the Si You Clan. After all, the number of entrants to the Sacred Ground was limited. Who would be willing to give it to a foreigner? Moreover, it required the consent of all Mirage Shell owners within the clan.</p><p>The Imperial Lord probably forgot about this rule. Very few within the Si You Clan knew and remembered it.  This True Person Qin was truly resourceful to have discovered it.</p><p>Before coming, Shao Shi was full of confidence, but he hadn't anticipated Qin Sang would propose such a condition, and he couldn't help but hesitate.</p><p>Qin Sang didn’t urge him, patiently sipping his spirit tea.</p><p>"True Person Qin won't compete with our clan for opportunities within the Sacred Ground, will he?" Shao Shi asked with a frown.</p><p>Qin Sang learned about the Sacred Ground through the Hanjiang Lu Clan and the Yanshan Si Clan's Mirage Shells.  What if he also set his sights on a certain opportunity recorded within the Mirage Shell and clashed with the royal clan, wouldn’t that bring him a powerful enemy?</p><p>“This humble Daoist will try to avoid the royal clan. We can establish a binding oath later,” Qin Sang said casually, adding with a hint of teasing, “One Mirage Shell has two slots. This humble Daoist will only occupy one. The royal clan gains one slot for free. What is Daoist Si still hesitating about?”</p><p>Shao Shi’s expression stiffened: “True Person Qin wouldn't be asking for other conditions, would he? Absolutely not! Do you know how much it costs to persuade the other Mirage Shell owners to allow a foreigner to accompany them?”</p><p>Qin Sang remained noncommittal: “Daoist Si might as well report back to the Imperial Lord and we can discuss further later.”</p><p>Hearing this, Shao Shi wanted to say something but stopped.  He knew time was of the essence, yet he couldn’t make the decision. Even the Imperial Lord needed to consider this matter carefully.</p><p>Shao Shi couldn't help but sigh inwardly.  He had no intention of staying any longer. After conversing with Qin Sang for a while, he rose and took his leave.</p><p>Watching the carriage head westward, Qin Sang pondered. Shao Shi came with great momentum this time, likely bringing many treasures. However, for the sake of entering the Sacred Ground, he could only forgo them.</p><p>…</p><p>After sending Shao Shi off, Qin Sang immediately returned to the fire chamber.</p><p>Within the fire chamber, eight golden figures were circulating golden liquid around the Heaven-Trapping Golden Lock. The lock’s repulsive force was weakening day by day.</p><p>“There should be enough time.”</p><p>Qin Sang sensed for a moment, murmuring to himself.</p><p>Since returning from Purple Cloud Mountain, he had hardly any time for dedicated cultivation.  Apart from the time spent establishing Qingyang Prefecture, his mind was almost entirely focused on the sword formation and the Heaven-Trapping Golden Lock.</p><p>The sword formation had also made considerable progress.</p><p>Before the Sacred Ground opened, even if the Azure Dragon Sword Formation wasn’t perfected, it could still be used against enemies.  With three sword formations deployed together, the power would certainly be elevated to a higher level.</p><p>Qin Sang infused the golden figures with golden liquid and continued to comprehend the sword formation.</p><p>After Shao Shi left, there was no news for several months, indicating that this condition truly put the Imperial Lord in a difficult position.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't wait for Shao Shi but for Patriarch Yuan Xiang, who brought similar news.</p><p>"One of the next two low tides will definitely be a great tide. True Person Qin can make preparations early. For this Yuanjiao Dharma Assembly, please join us, True Person. You can also bring some fellow Daoists and juniors," Patriarch Yuan Xiang said.</p><p>"Will it expose our whereabouts?" Qin Sang worried.</p><p>According to True Person Ning, he needed to stagger his arrival with Liu Li and remain hidden to avoid being detected by his enemies.</p><p>"It's fine. The Yuanjiao Dharma Assembly is first, followed by the Sacred Ground.  Experts from all clans will attend the assembly, along with many friendly foreigners. There are countless rare treasures and it would be a pity to miss it.  The Sacred Ground will only open near the end of the assembly. The gate to the Sacred Ground has its own monitoring abilities. As long as True Person Qin obtains the Si You Clan's approval and has all the power of the Mirage Shells infused into your body, you can pass through the gate without informing other tribes. To avoid trouble, the Imperial Lord will surely find a way to conceal your identity…"</p><p>The Zhu Yan Tribe had already sent many foreigners in, and Patriarch Yuan Xiang was experienced.</p><p>Qin Sang was relieved, sighing: "It's a pity Shao Shi hasn't sent any news. I wonder what the Imperial Lord truly intends."</p><p>"Since he didn't refuse on the spot, it means it's negotiable. The Imperial Lord should be testing the attitudes of others. Just wait a little longer."</p><p>Patriarch Yuan Xiang came not only to deliver the message but also to observe the Governing Altar.</p><p>Qin Sang was quite generous, opening the Grand Bestowal Hall and inviting Patriarch Yuan Xiang inside.</p><p>Patriarch Yuan Xiang marveled and praised repeatedly, worthy of the Dao Court that once shook the Great Thousand Worlds!</p><p>…</p><p>As Patriarch Yuan Xiang predicted, not long after his visit, Shao Shi finally returned.</p><p>Qin Sang invited Shao Shi to the Welcoming Guest Peak.  After a brief exchange of pleasantries, Shao Shi went straight to the point, delivering good news.</p><p>"During this time, this old man has been tasked with contacting several fellow Daoists who hold Mirage Shells.  Persuading them is not easy. However, despite the difficulty, it's not entirely hopeless."</p><p>Qin Sang remained unmoved, listening as Shao Shi continued:  "The Imperial Lord must confirm one thing:  that our paying a huge price to help True Person Qin enter the Sacred Ground won't become a problem for us."</p><p>"This humble Daoist said I can make a binding oath…"</p><p>"The Imperial Lord would rather True Person Qin become our ally!"</p><p>Shao Shi interrupted: "After entering the Sacred Ground, please join us first, True Person Qin, to break a seal. Rest assured, True Person Qin, it won't take too long. After the matter is concluded, you'll still have plenty of time to explore the Sacred Ground."</p><p>Qin Sang frowned.</p><p>After entering the Sacred Ground, he definitely needed to rendezvous with Liu Li and the others as soon as possible. Not to mention how long breaking the seal would take, there might be dangers and other adversaries. It was equivalent to him trading a Mirage Shell and himself for only one chance to enter the Sacred Ground.</p><p>Qin Sang sneered:  "If you can bring this humble Daoist in every time, perhaps I can consider it."</p><p>"That may not be impossible, as long as True Person Qin continues to stand with the royal clan. Most of the opportunities in the Sacred Ground are useless to foreigners. Compared to others, True Person Qin is more trustworthy."</p><p>Shao Shi said seriously:  "Don't rush to refuse, True Person Qin. Why not listen to the following conditions… The royal clan once obtained a treasure in the Sacred Ground called the Lightning Pearl. This pearl is a lightning Dao treasure.  While it doesn't possess overwhelming power itself, it can store a lightning technique. When encountering an enemy, one can offer this pearl and unleash the lightning technique against them!"</p><p>Qin Sang's expression suddenly shifted.</p><p>"You're thinking the same thing.  We originally weren't confident about breaking that seal, but with True Person Qin's assistance, it's different.  We'd like to invite True Person Qin to activate the Thunder Altar and unleash the lightning talisman that killed the Grand Protector, sealing it within the Lightning Pearl. Although the pearl can only store one lightning technique at a time, it can be repeatedly infused. Once successful, the Imperial Lord is willing to gift this pearl to True Person Qin as a reward," Shao Shi’s tone carried a hint of enticement.</p><p>Such a treasure actually existed!</p><p>Qin Sang's heart stirred.  He said in a deep voice: "Are you certain this pearl can store that lightning talisman?"</p><p>Shao Shi faltered. He wasn't actually certain, as that lightning talisman was too powerful.</p><p>"We'll know if we try! With the power of the Thunder Altar, even storing a lesser lightning talisman would be a powerful aid."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, about to speak, when he suddenly felt something unusual with his Nascent Soul.</p><p>The Cloudroaming Sword was trembling!</p>
