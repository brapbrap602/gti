<h1>Chapter 287: The Rainbow Bridge</h1><p>Even if they were truly grateful to the cave's owner, a simple bow would have sufficed, or perhaps three kowtows at most. After all, the owner was long deceased, and any show of gratitude was merely for peace of mind. Why waste time with such an elaborate ritual now?</p><p>Yu Kong performed the rites with solemn meticulousness, while Qin Sang and the others inwardly grumbled, not daring to speak out, and waited patiently.</p><p>Finally, the last rite completed, Yu Kong didn't rise but looked up at the clay statue. His gaze fixed on the statue's left hand, eyes gleaming with barely contained excitement and anticipation.</p><p>The statue's left hand wasn't formed into any particular gesture. It rested simply on its knee, palm up, thumb tucked in, and fingers pointing straight ahead towards the hall's exit.</p><p>Just as Yu Kong finished his bows, a ray of rainbow light suddenly burst forth from the statue’s fingertips.</p><p>This unexpected turn of events startled everyone. No one had imagined the seemingly ordinary statue held a secret.  The hall erupted in a cacophony of gasps and murmurs.  All eyes darted between the statue and Yu Kong, faces etched with disbelief.</p><p>After all, the Autumn Market, once discovered, had been visited by countless cultivators. The inheritance hall had been thoroughly searched, and the statue undoubtedly examined from top to bottom. It appeared to be nothing more than an ordinary sculpture.  Even Core Formation cultivators had inspected it.</p><p>Yet, before Yu Kong, no one had uncovered its secret!</p><p>The rainbow light intensified, transforming into a shimmering bridge that spanned half the hall. The bridge was arched, but only half-formed. One end rested before Yu Kong, while the other connected to the space above the statue's palm, disappearing into the void.</p><p>Qin Sang's heart leaped.</p><p>Could this rainbow bridge be the hidden path to the medicinal garden?</p><p>If not witnessed firsthand, who would have guessed that the so-called hidden path was concealed in such plain sight, activated in such a peculiar manner?</p><p>The hall bathed in the multicolored light of the rainbow, Yu Kong, seemingly prepared, swiftly cast a spell, sealing the entrance to prevent the light from leaking out and attracting attention from outside.</p><p>"Haha..." Yu Kong laughed heartily, "That friend did not deceive me!  Morality has decayed in this world. Cultivators only seek treasure, not gratitude. Otherwise, how could it be that only now, has Yu discovered the statue's secret?"</p><p>Yu Kong's laughter brought everyone back to their senses.  They exchanged glances, and Crescent Fairy asked in a sweet voice, "Senior Yu, we've never heard of such wonders regarding this statue. Did you discover this first? Could this rainbow bridge lead to the cave owner's treasure vault?"</p><p>Yu Kong's laughter subsided. He looked at them with a knowing smile, "Regardless of where it leads, fellow Daoists, are you not curious to see?"</p><p>His words ignited a fervent gleam in everyone's eyes. Wu Chen cautiously replied, "With such a mystery before us, we naturally wish to explore. However, Daoist Yu was the first to discover this rainbow bridge, and we must have your consent.  Please, tell us your conditions, and we will follow your lead."</p><p>Everyone nodded in agreement.  This hidden rainbow bridge, wherever it led, must be extraordinary and likely untouched. Perhaps it held treasures even more valuable than those within the Treasure Pavilion.  Even a small share would be immensely rewarding.</p><p>As long as Yu Kong didn't intend to hoard everything for himself, any request would be acceptable.</p><p>Yu Kong chuckled. "Since I invited you all here, I wouldn't leave you out and keep everything for myself.  I know nothing of what lies beyond the bridge, whether treasures or dangers, perhaps even more perilous restrictions than in the Treasure Pavilion…  No one wishes to back out, do they?"</p><p>At this point, who could resist the temptation?  Besides, having witnessed the secret, what would be the consequences of withdrawing now?</p><p>No one backed down. Yu Kong nodded in satisfaction, glanced outside the hall, and urged, "We shouldn't linger. Let's go."</p><p>With Yan Wu leading the way, everyone lined up to step onto the rainbow bridge, Yu Kong bringing up the rear.</p><p>Qin Sang followed silently.  He didn't immediately crush the Twin Heart Pendant. Although he was almost certain the bridge was the hidden path, he decided against sending a message before fully understanding the situation on the other side.  Doing so might backfire.</p><p>The scene from the jade pendant hinted that obtaining the spirit herbs wouldn't be easy, so there was no need to rush.</p><p>Moreover, Qin Sang couldn't decipher Yu Kong's intentions.  If he genuinely planned to collaborate in the treasure hunt, then peace was preferable.</p><p>However, if, as Sheng Yuanzi had suggested, Yu Kong merely sought scapegoats, Wandering Cloud and Ge Yuan were essential backups.  After all, having already killed Shao Chunhui, what did a few more lives matter to Yu Kong?</p><p>Lost in thought, Qin Sang watched as those ahead vanished at the bridge's end.  His turn arrived.</p><p>Qin Sang took a deep breath, on high alert. He stepped across the threshold of the bridge. Darkness enveloped him momentarily, and his foot landed not on empty space but solid ground.</p><p>They emerged in a cave. Dim light filtered through the entrance, shrouded in mist.  The cave itself held no immediate danger or restrictions.  Everyone relaxed slightly, turning to watch Yu Kong enter last.</p><p>Yu Kong waved his hand at the stone wall, and the rainbow bridge vanished.</p><p>"The treasures are ahead. What are we waiting for?"</p><p>With those words, Yu Kong led the way out of the cave.</p><p>Stepping out, Qin Sang saw with his own eyes the scene from his jade pendant. He was certain: this was the location of the medicinal garden!</p><p>However, the area was far more vast than he had imagined!</p><p>Beyond the cave stretched a vast plain, dotted with a few low hills, nothing remarkable.  Only the towering mountain in the distance, the same one from the jade pendant, commanded attention.</p><p>Mist cloaked the distant mountain, but the aroma of spirit herbs pierced through, captivating everyone.</p><p>"Those… are those the spirit herbs planted by the cave's owner?"  Wu Chen gasped, eyes burning with avarice.  The others shared his excitement.</p><p>However, some remained composed. Elder Wooden Vine said coldly, "Don't get ahead of yourselves. That mist shrouding the mountain isn't ordinary; it’s a formidable restriction. Whether we can obtain those spirit herbs remains to be seen."</p><p>His words were a cold splash of reality, sobering the group from their fervor.</p><p>Yu Kong nodded slightly, looking at Elder Wooden Vine with a strange expression, "Daoist Wooden Vine is indeed a cunning old fox. No wonder Sheng Yuanzi trusted you to infiltrate my group."</p><p>Everyone gasped, quickly distancing themselves from Elder Wooden Vine.</p><p>His face paled, but he maintained his composure, arguing, "Since embarking on the path of cultivation, I've been alone. I don't know any Sheng Yuanzi. I have no idea what you're talking about…"</p>
