<h1>Chapter 943: Deliverance</h1><p>“Fellow Daoist, you have ample Demonic Banners.  Why not refine a few more here and weaken the demonic restrictions near the Deliverance Grand Formation as much as possible…?” Bai suggested.</p><p>Qin Sang readily agreed and refined six more Demonic Banners within the cavern.</p><p>When a portion of the demonic fire was sealed within these seven banners, the form of the demonic restrictions on the ground changed drastically.  The black net, though not completely shattered, became significantly thinner.</p><p>By now, Bai had fully activated the power of the eight spirit pillars on the altar.</p><p>Around the altar, shimmering rain fell, transforming into a gentle dew that countered the demonic restrictions and prevented their recovery.</p><p>Bai quickly cast a series of hand seals, leaped from the altar, and urged, “Fellow Daoist, follow me!”</p><p>Qin Sang put away the banners and hurried after him.</p><p>The power of this single altar was insufficient to deliver all the lost souls in the Ghostlands.  With the altar at the center, four auxiliary altars were situated at the edges of the Ghostlands, forming the Grand Formation together.</p><p>Now, Qin Sang and Bai needed to activate these altars one by one and weaken the demonic restrictions surrounding them.</p><p>The two flew at full speed, locating the second altar.</p><p>Unlike the central altar, this one had only four spirit pillars.</p><p>The process remained smooth.  After collecting the demonic fire, they immediately rushed to the next altar.</p><p>After continuous work, they arrived at the final altar, which was closest to the entrance of the Ghostlands.</p><p>The spirit pillars on the other altars were also covered in cracks, but fortunately, none were destroyed. The Deliverance Grand Formation should be able to activate successfully.</p><p>Skilled in their task, they forced out the demonic fire, collected it, and refined the banners.</p><p>Finally, the last magic treasure was refined!</p><p>Qin Sang retrieved the banner, intending to examine the eighteen Demonic Banners, but suddenly felt a tremor beneath his feet. He quickly looked at Bai, who, after activating all the spirit pillars on the altar, flashed over to Qin Sang’s side.</p><p>“Let's go!”</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze narrowed as he examined the altar.</p><p>The spirit pillars emitted intense light.  The restrictions within the altar were fully triggered by Bai, their fluctuations spreading throughout the Ghostlands.</p><p>At the same time, something in the distance seemed to resonate with the altar's restrictions. The other four altars, already activated, signaled that the Deliverance Grand Formation, dormant for countless years, had finally been awakened!</p><p>Qin Sang and Bai flew towards their pre-selected hiding place.</p><p>As they flew, the effects of the Deliverance Grand Formation erupted, shaking the entire Ghostlands.</p><p>Beams of light shot skyward from the center and the four corners of the Ghostlands.  However, upon reaching a certain height, they were blocked by demonic restrictions appearing in the void.</p><p>Not just at the location of the light beams.</p><p>Around the altars, and even throughout the Ghostlands, demonic restrictions emerged, forming a net that completely enveloped the area.</p><p>At the same time, the five altars within the Ghostlands connected with each other. Strange fluctuations spread, and a faint milky light drifted within the grayish-white ghostly mist.</p><p>Countless souls awakened, drifting out from their skeletal remains.  As they touched the white light, the madness on their faces vanished, replaced by serene expressions of unprecedented peace.</p><p>They were soothed, their rage subsided.</p><p>Moments later, as if responding to a call, these souls drifted towards the five altars, seeking the source of their tranquility.</p><p>By now, Qin Sang and Bai had reached their hiding place.</p><p>Bai stirred the ghostly mist with his palm, forming a barrier. Qin Sang took out the Red Silk, waiting for the right moment.</p><p>The Red Silk’s power was almost depleted. Usually, facing cultivators of the same realm, activating a small portion of its power for disguise was sufficient. However, to conceal their presence from a Nascent Soul ancestor, he had to unleash its full power, causing irreversible damage each time. Qin Sang estimated he could use it at most two or three more times.</p><p>Therefore, he treasured the Red Silk and only used it in critical situations like this.</p><p>“It's starting!” Bai whispered.</p><p>Qin Sang looked down and saw the mountain of bones "melting" from the inside out.  At the base of the bones, the aura of the demonic restrictions grew increasingly violent.</p><p>Suddenly, the familiar black net incinerated the mountain of bones, leaving nothing but a gaping hole.</p><p>Qin Sang was startled and flew into the air. Bai followed suit without hesitation.</p><p>Now, demonic restrictions appeared above and below them.  Even though they weren't targeted, Qin Sang felt a chill.</p><p>From their position, they couldn't see the altars and could only anxiously await the outcome.</p><p>At the center of the Deliverance Grand Formation:</p><p>The cavern had vanished, replaced by a large pit, revealing the altar. A massive formation of light rotated slowly around the altar, covered in mystical runes.</p><p>The spirit pillars creaked, their cracks deepening, yet they held.</p><p>Under the impact of the Grand Formation, the already weakened demonic restrictions on the ground finally succumbed, breached by the light formation.</p><p>The same scene played out at the other altars.</p><p>This triggered a chain reaction. The tide had turned, and the demonic restrictions could no longer suppress the Deliverance Grand Formation.</p><p>The Deliverance Grand Formation continued to assault the demonic restrictions, causing more phenomena. The entire Ghostlands trembled violently.</p><p>Outside the canyon:</p><p>Old Devil Mu had set up a spirit formation and lay in wait.</p><p>Suddenly, the canyon shook. The tremors clearly originated from deep within the Ghostlands. The Nine Nether Demonic Fire also reacted, dancing wildly.</p><p>Old Devil Mu was shocked. He abruptly stood, staring intently at the Ghostlands, his expression shifting.</p><p>“Did that person trigger some restriction?”</p><p>Old Devil Mu was filled with uncertainty.</p><p>But the entrance was blocked by demonic fire and shrouded in ghostly mist, obscuring his view.</p><p>Inside the Ghostlands, the shattered demonic restrictions finally reached Qin Sang and Bai.</p><p>They exchanged a look, knowing that a drastic change was imminent.</p><p>Bai formed hand seals, condensing a thick layer of ghostly mist around them. Qin Sang pointed at the Red Silk, and the treasure transformed into a red veil, enveloping them and masking their auras.</p><p>Just as they finished, the ground shook violently.</p><p>The spirit pillars of all the altars exploded almost simultaneously, causing the altars to collapse.  Brilliant white light erupted, and the light beams, now several times more solid, crashed against the demonic restrictions with terrifying force.</p><p>The already crumbling demonic restrictions finally shattered under the onslaught of the Grand Formation.</p><p>The light beams, now unhindered, shot into the heavens!</p><p>Countless souls, along with the light beams, escaped the prison that had held them for ages.  The long-lost souls wore expressions of bewilderment.</p><p>The light beams, after breaking free from the demonic restrictions, suddenly dispersed.  A faint chanting sound echoed.</p><p>The souls listened to the chanting, bathed in the white light and runes, and peacefully dissolved, disappearing from the mortal world.</p><p>No one knew their final destination or if they truly returned to the cycle of reincarnation.</p><p>At the same time, the demonic restrictions surrounding the Ghostlands crumbled, sending powerful shockwaves in all directions. Bai's manipulation of the Grand Formation focused the initial impact on the canyon entrance.</p>
