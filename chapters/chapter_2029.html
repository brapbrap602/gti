<h1>Chapter 2020: The Black Hole</h1><p>The agreed-upon location was within a stable illusory realm created by divine ability.</p><p>When Qin Sang arrived, Young Master Xin and Steward Luo were already waiting there, along with several Xin Clan cultivators who had returned earlier.</p><p>Offering Elder Pei sat cross-legged on a nearby rock, his breath long and deep, in meditation. It was unclear whether he had been cultivating there the entire time, never leaving.</p><p>"Elder Qin, have you discovered anything?"</p><p>As soon as Qin Sang arrived, Steward Luo eagerly stepped forward to inquire.</p><p>The highest cultivators present were Qin Sang and Offering Elder Pei. Only they could venture into the deeper regions.</p><p>Offering Elder Pei, proud of his status, was unwilling to undertake such trivial scouting tasks, and they dared not urge him, placing their hopes solely on news from Qin Sang.</p><p>"Uncle Luo," Young Master Xin softly addressed Steward Luo, his tone devoid of urgency. He advised, "Elder Qin has just returned and likely needs to rest.  It won't be too late to discuss matters after everyone has assembled."</p><p>"The Young Master's words are wise.  This old servant was overwhelmed by concern. Please forgive me, Elder Qin," Steward Luo said apologetically.</p><p>"It's nothing," Qin Sang naturally wouldn't mind such a small matter.  He spoke frankly, "Although I also kept an eye out for you, my primary focus was searching for the Earth Jade Rosy Vine.  In this past year, I haven't found any place that triggers a reaction from the Runefire."</p><p>Unknowingly, they had already been within the Abundant Jade Gate for a year, having explored only a small portion of it. Aside from the unexpected encounter with Su Nu, they had made little progress in other matters.</p><p>Hearing this, Steward Luo was secretly disappointed, knowing that impatience wouldn't help.  For high-ranking cultivators with long lifespans, a year was nothing. This search could easily last for a decade or eight years.</p><p>Steward Luo respectfully invited Qin Sang to take the main seat on the carriage. However, Qin Sang looked towards the Xin Clan cultivators beside the carriage.  These were all Nascent Soul cultivators of the Xin Clan, who had previously led teams to scout and were now back to report.</p><p>"Fellow Daoists, have you found any signs of the Earth Jade Rosy Vine?" Qin Sang asked.</p><p>They glanced at the carriage, each taking out a jade slip and presenting it to Qin Sang.</p><p>"Reporting to Elder Qin, we haven't found the Earth Jade Rosy Vine. However, as per Elder Qin's instructions, we meticulously explored every marked location along our routes and recorded our findings. Please examine them, Elder Qin."</p><p>Qin Sang collected the jade slips, boarded the carriage, and sat behind the jade table, examining them one by one.</p><p>These cultivators were relatively diligent. The records within the jade slips were very detailed, indicating thorough exploration. If they had fabricated the records, they couldn't have possibly deceived Qin Sang's discerning eyes.</p><p>As he reviewed each location, Qin Sang systematically eliminated them.</p><p>Regardless of how mysterious and dangerous these places were rumored to be, in reality, almost all accounts contained exaggerations.  To low-ranking cultivators, naturally, everywhere seemed mysterious, and with the spread of rumors, most were not as they seemed, nothing more.</p><p>While Qin Sang was examining the jade slips, the others gradually returned. Finally, Qu Zhen also arrived with two Hengsha Society cultivators. Fortunately, the various teams only suffered casualties due to unforeseen circumstances; none had been completely annihilated.</p><p>The reports were compiled, all yielding no results. They would have to continue their separate searches.</p><p>"From now on, everyone will gradually explore deeper, and it will become increasingly dangerous. Be careful and prioritize safety," Young Master Xin instructed.</p><p>"Yes, sir!"</p><p>Everyone bowed in acknowledgment and was about to disperse when Offering Elder Pei's eyelids fluttered, and he awoke from his meditation. He said coldly, "With these useless individuals, how long will it take to find anything? This old man doesn't want to waste all his time on you. Give me some talisman papers!"</p><p>Seeing that Offering Elder Pei was actually going to personally take action, both Young Master Xin and Steward Luo were overjoyed and immediately presented a stack of talisman papers. "We're indebted to Senior Pei."</p><p>Offering Elder Pei grunted, collected the talisman papers, transformed into a streak of white light, and vanished into the depths of the void.</p><p>Qin Sang instructed the Hengsha Society to continue following his orders, then excused himself from Young Master Xin.  After flying for a while, he arrived in an expanse of empty, dark void. Suddenly, he stopped his escape light and said calmly, "I wonder which fellow Daoist has been following me for so long. Why not show yourself and have a chat?"</p><p>"Elder Qin's spiritual sense is truly sharp," a figure emerged from the darkness. It was Offering Elder Pei.</p><p>Seeing him, Qin Sang wasn't surprised at all. He replied, "Because Offering Elder Pei didn't deliberately conceal your aura, you shouldn't harbor any ill will towards me. Otherwise, I would have fled long ago."</p><p>"Is that so? A dignified Five Elements Alliance Elder, would he be a coward?"  A flicker of disbelief flashed in Offering Elder Pei's eyes.  "However, Elder Qin, you were right about one thing. I bear no malice towards you."</p><p>Saying this, he looked towards the interior of the Abundant Jade Gate. "This place is fraught with danger. In my memory, I've only been here three or five times and don't know it well. Why don't we travel together? Not only can we look out for each other, but it's said that the fragments of the Ancient Sword Pavilion contain countless treasures.  If we join forces in our search, we can divide the spoils equally, each taking what we need. The Xin Clan's matters are secondary. I once made a promise to the previous Xin Clan Patriarch.  It's out of respect for that promise that I agreed to help the Xin Clan. Otherwise, I wouldn't bother with them."</p><p>"So that's how it is. Offering Elder Pei is a man of his word!"</p><p>Qin Sang's face showed admiration, then he said regretfully, "Unfortunately, in my eyes, nothing is more important than the Earth Jade Rosy Vine, and the same goes for the Ancient Sword Pavilion and the Xin Clan's matters. If we travel together, I'm afraid I'll delay your treasure-hunting plans, Offering Elder Pei."</p><p>"Is that so? It seems we're not fated to travel together, Elder Qin. Then I wish you success in your endeavors," Offering Elder Pei said with a faint smile.</p><p>"I appreciate your kind words, Offering Elder Pei!"</p><p>Qin Sang cupped his hands and flew away.</p><p>Watching Qin Sang's retreating figure, Offering Elder Pei's gaze gradually turned icy. His figure flickered and vanished, leaving behind a cold snort.</p><p>...</p><p>On his way to Su Nu's secluded cultivation grounds, Qin Sang was still pondering the relationship between Offering Elder Pei and the Xin Clan.  Based on what he had seen and heard, it might not be as simple as Offering Elder Pei had claimed.  However, he wasn't interested in knowing and had no intention of getting involved, taking neither side.</p><p>When the time came, if a dispute did arise, he would simply seize the opportunity and act accordingly. He could always withdraw if necessary.</p><p>Su Nu's cultivation grounds were in a valley. Within the valley, clear springs flowed and verdant trees flourished, resembling a paradise, making it difficult to discern whether it was an illusory realm or a truly existing place.</p><p>As soon as he entered the valley, Su Nu's voice came from within, "Brother Qin, is that you?"</p><p>Qin Sang responded, secretly wondering why Su Nu's voice sounded somewhat unusual.</p><p>Before her voice faded, Su Nu emerged from a treehouse in the forest, startling Qin Sang. Su Nu was pale, frail, and as she flew out, she resembled a ghost, like a terminally ill patient.</p><p>How long had he been gone? What had happened during that time?</p><p>"Please excuse my appearance, Brother Qin," Su Nu said with a ashamed and embarrassed look. "I was previously pursued and attacked by two rivals, which left me with a lingering ailment. Although it doesn't affect me normally, I was worried that it would hinder Brother Qin during our exploration of the Sword Pavilion. Coincidentally, I know a secret technique, so I thought of using it to resolve the ailment, but I overlooked its dangers. Unexpectedly, due to my haste, something went wrong midway, and I almost succumbed to demonic Qiâ€¦"</p><p>Hearing this, Qin Sang felt a wave of helplessness, not knowing what to say. A dignified Void Refinement cultivator could make such a mistake. It could only be said that Su Nu was too headstrong, unwilling to rely on others. Strong individuals all possessed a pride that wouldn't allow them to appear weak.</p><p>"Is the injury serious?"</p><p>Qin Sang examined Su Nu, seeing her fluctuating aura. Even if she hadn't truly succumbed to demonic Qi, her strength must have been greatly diminished, and her injuries likely worsened.</p><p>"Fortunately, I realized something was wrong and stopped in time. I only lost some vital essence, but the lingering ailment has mostly been resolved. I may need to seclude myself for a few years, and I'm afraid I won't be able to explore the Sword Pavilion with Brother Qin during this time," Su Nu sighed.</p><p>"Don't worry about it. Focus on your recovery.  The Sword Pavilion fragments have existed for so long; a few years won't make a difference. I'll gather information and comprehend the ancient restrictions within the Sword Pavilion on my own. After you've recovered, we'll explore together."</p><p>Qin Sang consoled her.</p><p>"Thank you for your understanding, Brother Qin," Su Nu flipped her jade hand, taking out a green jade pendant.  "I can't be distracted while in seclusion. This jade is the key to the valley's formation.  Take it, Brother Qin, and you can freely enter and exit the valley to rest in the future."</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't refuse and accepted the jade pendant. However, although Su Nu appeared calm, Qin Sang secretly decided to come here less often. No one wanted to be approached while healing.</p><p>After exchanging a few more words, Qin Sang didn't enter the valley and bid farewell to Su Nu.</p><p>Flying some distance away, Qin Sang turned back, looking towards the valley, his brows furrowing slightly. He pondered for a moment, then finally shook his head and flew towards his intended destination.</p><p>Su Nu's seclusion was also a good thing. He wouldn't need to find excuses to send her away now.</p><p>For Qin Sang, the most important thing was finding an escape route. It concerned his life and fortune, so naturally, the escape route had to be in his own hands, unknown to others, not even Su Nu.</p><p>Regarding the Purple Star Palace, Qin Sang was most concerned about two things: one was the Heavenly Mountain that sealed Bing Yao, and the other was the teleportation formation leading to the Seven Kill Hall.</p><p>This formation was located within a Sword Path Great Hall.  Qin Sang remembered that great changes had occurred there when the Immortal Palace appeared, with divine peaks rising from the ground. He wondered if this place had separated from the Purple Star Palace. If he could find the Sword Path Great Hall, he might be able to directly enter other parts of the Sword Pavilion.</p><p>While Su Nu was healing, Qin Sang explored the Abundant Jade Gate while searching for Sword Pavilion fragments.  Most of the time, he only glanced at a place, and if it wasn't what he was looking for, he would leave.</p><p>Next, he selected a few more locations from Qu Zhen and the others' records and personally visited them, only to be disappointed time and time again.</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't discouraged and continued his relentless search, venturing deeper into the Abundant Jade Gate.</p><p>On this day, when the agreed-upon time with Zhu Que arrived, Qin Sang emerged from the depths and rushed to the location, immediately hearing Zhu Que's clamorous voice.</p><p>"You're finally back! Come with me, quickly!"</p><p>Zhu Que grabbed Qin Sang's sleeve, impatiently pulling him forward.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced around, noticing the absence of the Fire Jade Centipede and the two demon marquises. He frowned and asked, "Did you encounter danger?"</p><p>Zhu Que snorted, "What are you thinking! We found a good place! One of the two scouts died in there, and Little Centipede and the others are guarding the place."</p><p>"Oh?"</p><p>Qin Sang's interest was piqued. He enveloped Zhu Que with true essence, transforming into a bolt of lightning and flying towards the location Zhu Que mentioned.</p><p>Passing through stretches of dark void and illusory realms, they finally arrived at a place filled with numerous illusory realms.</p><p>These illusory realms were arranged very densely, with almost no gaps between them, and the conflicts between them were more intense than elsewhere, making them daunting to approach.</p><p>This was still within the normal range, but as they got closer to their destination, anomalies began to appear.</p><p>"How is it?  Isn't it strange?"</p><p>Zhu Que raised its head high, brimming with pride. "This Zhu Que was the first to discover it!"</p><p>"You did well this time."</p><p>Qin Sang didn't hold back his praise.</p><p>He sensed an invisible force emanating outwards from within. This force was very subtle yet extremely powerful, causing the surrounding illusory realms to distort, thus triggering conflicts.</p><p>Masked by the fluctuations of the conflicting illusory realms, only those with sufficiently sharp spiritual senses could detect the existence of this force. If it weren't for Zhu Que's reminder, he might have overlooked it.</p><p>Continuing deeper, they finally reached their destination and saw Marquis Luo and the other demons.  As expected, only one captive remained.</p><p>"It's here!"</p><p>Zhu Que raised its wing, pointing forward. There was nothing there but endless darkness.</p><p>Unlike the void outside, this was an absolute blackness, devoid of any light, like a dead space.</p><p>"There seems to be an invisible void ahead, constantly emitting a powerful suction force. That fellow hadn't gone far when he was suddenly sucked in.  We couldn't save him in timeâ€¦" Marquis Gui said, still shaken.</p><p>The scout captive was sucked away, and the connection with the restriction on his body was immediately severed.  He was likely dead. A Nascent Soul cultivator was swallowed by the darkness without any resistance. If it weren't for the Pathfinding Stone, they might have suffered the same fate.</p><p>They tried various methods but still dared not get too close, so they could only summon Qin Sang.</p><p>Listening to their descriptions, Qin Sang focused his spiritual light on the darkness.</p><p>In his vision, the scene within the darkness gradually changed. The corner of a massive outline slowly emerged.</p><p>This place wasn't empty. There was a gigantic black disc. The black disc was rotating, seemingly very slowly, yet it gave the impression of immense, unstoppable power.</p><p>The black disc wasn't a physical object but rather an incredibly dense, constantly flowing force, a super-strong suction force, forming tangible ripples in the void.  And at the very center of the black disc, as Marquis Gui had said, there seemed to be a void, a void that could devour everything!</p><p>Strangely, the black disc was extremely stable, and the force within the void was unusually calm. If one were sucked into the void, would they be instantly torn apart, or transported to another place?</p><p>Could there be a strange passage?</p><p>Zhu Que had called Qin Sang over precisely with this consideration in mind.  If they could investigate the void, they might find the best escape route.</p><p>However, everything ahead was unknown. How could they blindly rush in? The more Qin Sang looked, the more alarmed he became. Once sucked into the void, even he wasn't confident in escaping the suction force. Even if it was a passage, if it connected to the depths of the Abundant Jade Gate, a place even more dangerous than the void, wouldn't it be courting death?</p><p>"Master, should we send him in to try again?" Marquis Gui brought forth the last captive.</p><p>The captive's eyes were empty, his expression dull, devoid of any fear. Dying here would be a release for him.</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head. A Nascent Soul cultivator would vanish into the void the moment they were caught by the suction force, let alone this person who sought death. There would be no point of reference. He had to go in himself, or ask another Void Refinement cultivator for assistance.</p><p>He moved cautiously, carefully approaching the black disc, feeling the suction force and observing the changes in the void.</p>
