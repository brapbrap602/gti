<h1>Chapter 1196: Alone</h1><p>After a further private discussion, the Serpent King added more conditions, but Qin Sang refused them all.  Qin Sang wasn't short of magical artifacts; his Ebony Sword was on the verge of transforming into a top-tier artifact, and the power of his magic banner was equally formidable, ensuring he wouldn't need to worry about artifacts during the Yuan Ying stage.</p><p>Seeing that Qin Sang truly didn't want to accept the offer and wasn't bargaining, the Serpent King took his leave with regret.</p><p>After seeing off the Serpent King, Qin Sang thought to himself that he couldn't keep waiting for the Ebony Sword to refine. He decided to depart soon, allowing it to refine on the journey, and to maintain a low profile upon reaching the Abyss of Sin.  Otherwise, if the Serpent King caused trouble in the Abyss of Sin and led to a lockdown, Qin Sang would also suffer unwarranted consequences.</p><p>With this in mind, Qin Sang quickly made arrangements. He found Jing Lin and the others, stating his intention to leave for a while. While they weren't thrilled, they knew there was no reason to stop him.  Fortunately, the Abyss of Sin's aggression had lessened recently, and Chan Ling had become a shrinking turtle.</p><p>"I have already refined the Azure Luan's thunder power, greatly improving my thunder escape technique, and I feel the bottleneck in the later stages loosening. Master, if you venture into the dragon's lair alone and encounter trouble, you might be overwhelmed.  I am willing to sacrifice myself and serve you faithfully, following your every command."</p><p>Before his departure, Fat Chicken came to him, persistently begging Qin Sang to take him along.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at Fat Chicken.  "Aren't you afraid that if we're pursued by Yuan Ying cultivators from the Abyss of Sin, I'll throw you out as bait?"</p><p>Fat Chicken's expression froze, and it stammered, "As long as I can buy Master a chance to survive, I am willing to die!"</p><p>Whether it believed its own words was questionable.</p><p>Qin Sang sneered but still took Fat Chicken along; he might be useful after all.</p><p>Less than half a month after the Serpent King's departure, Qin Sang set off.  Following his planned route, he couldn't cross enemy lines; traversing the grassland into the Abyss of Sin was risky.  It was best to detour through the Great Desert, which would take more time but be safer.</p><p>He first traveled west, crossing the Shiqu Mountains and arriving near the Hukou Pass, guarded by the demon tribe. The Abyss of Sin's defenses here were much more relaxed.  Qin Sang found an opening and quietly left the Sky Walk Plateau. The surroundings became increasingly desolate.  After traveling a distance into the Gobi Desert, he saw endless stretches of yellow sand.</p><p>The desert was unbearably hot, a stark contrast to the cold Sky Walk Plateau.  Between the immense sand dunes, scorching winds prevailed, gradually forming the beginnings of a sandstorm.</p><p>At that moment, a figure appeared silently atop a dune, his brow furrowed as he gazed ahead, witnessing the world turning yellow as the sandstorm approached!  An invisible barrier seemed to surround him, blocking out all the sand and wind, rendering the fearsome sandstorm insignificant.</p><p>This person was Qin Sang.  Observing the path ahead, he murmured, "There are fewer and fewer patrols. After going a bit further, I should be able to safely increase my speed."</p><p>With his cultivation, unless he encountered a Yuan Ying cultivator from the Abyss of Sin, he didn't need to fear much.  Considering that this area was already occupied by the Abyss of Sin, he tried to cause as little trouble as possible, naturally slowing his speed.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>In an instant, the sky and earth darkened.  The sandstorm swept in.</p><p>Qin Sang narrowed his eyes, his figure flickering as he vanished into thin air, effortlessly passing through the sandstorm. After continuing to rush forward, a splash of green suddenly entered his vision.</p><p>"Another oasis. The spiritual energy seems quite rich..."</p><p>Qin Sang pondered for a moment, activating his concealment technique and flying toward the oasis.</p><p>In a short while, Qin Sang stood on a green mountain at the center of the oasis, looking at the surrounding ruins and letting out an almost inaudible sigh. This was clearly once the location of a cultivator sect. Now, the mountain gate had been destroyed by the Abyss of Sin, and the fate of the disciples was unknown. Fortunately, the Abyss of Sin hadn't gone so far as to massacre the commoners; the commoners in the oasis could still survive, though without the protection of cultivators, their survival in the desert would be far more difficult.</p><p>Similar scenes were common along his journey. Cultivators in the desert had long faced the slaughter of the Abyss of Sin.</p><p>"What exactly does the Abyss of Sin want? And Ye Lao Mo, is he only aiming to be the ruler of the Northern Star Realm?"</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head and continued on.  The vast desert seemed to have no end.</p><p>This trip was also a kind of training. Qin Sang prioritized travel, but when he encountered the unique scenery of the desert, he would stop to observe, even venturing deep into the desert to interact with the desert cultivation world and assess the Abyss of Sin's influence, aiming to learn as much as possible about the Abyss of Sin.</p><p>On this journey, he encountered desert cultivation sects and many unique Taoist techniques practiced by desert cultivators.  Among them was a top-tier sect with a Yuan Ying-stage master, boasting a long and distinguished history, rivaling even the great sects of Xiaohan.</p><p>Unfortunately, this sect, originally situated in an oasis near the Abyss of Sin, was forced by circumstances to abandon its mountain stronghold and relocate deep into the desert for safety. Fortunately, the vastness of the Northern Star Desert meant the Abyss of Sin's influence couldn't reach everywhere.</p><p>But what surprised Qin Sang was the Abyss of Sin's ability to wage war on two fronts simultaneously!</p><p>During his travels, Qin Sang happened to meet the sect's Supreme Patriarch.</p><p>Their encounter was serendipitous, and neither revealed their secrets. Instead, they engaged in philosophical discussions, benefiting mutually, before Qin Sang departed.</p><p>The desert held numerous secret realms and forbidden grounds, but Qin Sang had no interest in treasure hunting.  Traveling in this manner, he spent nearly two months traversing the Northern Star Desert diagonally before reaching the Abyss of Sin.</p><p>It was wartime, and the Abyss of Sin remained vigilant.</p><p>Cultivators stationed at the sect patrolled regularly.</p><p>Qin Sang's pace slowed, allowing him to gradually learn about the Abyss of Sin and enrich his senior sister's geomantic map, slowly approaching Near Scar Mountain.</p><p>This wasn't the blood-soaked hellscape depicted in the Two Realms Alliance propaganda.</p><p>Deep within the Abyss of Sin, ordinary people lived peaceful lives.</p><p>Since cultivation sects were concentrated along the Heavenly Scar, the Abyss of Sin's policy toward mortals differed from that of Xiaohan.  They installed low-level disciples deemed unsuitable for cultivation as rulers to govern the people, selecting talented individuals for cultivation.</p><p>Yet, for some unknown reason, warfare still plagued the mortal realm.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't delve deeper, gaining a general understanding before quickening his pace.</p><p>Near Scar Mountain's gate was located on the east bank of the Heavenly Scar.</p><p>After repeatedly evading patrols, Qin Sang finally saw the legendary Heavenly Scar!</p><p>The sight was indeed awe-inspiring, justifying its name!</p><p>The earth had split open here, a chasm a thousand miles wide and bottomless, reaching down to the Nine Netherworlds!</p><p>One couldn't help but wonder if the two landmasses would eventually separate completely.</p><p>Endless white mist billowed from the depths of the Abyss of Sin.  Even with cultivators infusing their eyes with spiritual energy, seeing across was difficult.  Fragments of magical restrictions floated in the mist, shimmering with strange lights, exuding an air of profound mystery.</p><p>Ordinary cultivators dared not cross the Heavenly Scar directly through the air.</p><p>At the narrowest points of the Heavenly Scar, various factions had established teleportation arrays, their range far less than ancient arrays, but perfectly suited for this location.</p><p>"What a magnificent Heavenly Scar!"</p><p>Qin Sang exclaimed.</p><p>—</p><p>—</p><p>There will be another chapter today, but it will be later.</p>
