<h1>Chapter 1950: Passing the Examination</h1><p>Noon.</p><p>The sound of galloping horses echoed down the road, raising a cloud of dust. Three horses sped towards the village.</p><p>Villagers of Qipai Village, resting in the shade of trees, were reminded of the recent disturbance.</p><p>It was said that Chen Xiucai had been attacked by his enemies and nearly imprisoned.</p><p>The villagers immediately grew anxious, rising to their feet and peering across the river. They saw the three riders pulling up their horses outside the bamboo grove, about to enter.</p><p>"Oh no! Trouble again!"</p><p>An old man exclaimed, slapping his thigh in worry.</p><p>The others shared his apprehension.</p><p>Their respect for Chen Xiucai was heartfelt, and not solely due to his character.  He had established a school in Qipai Village, bringing tangible benefits and a glimmer of hope to generations of farmers.</p><p>Just then, one of the three riders raised a gong high and struck it forcefully.</p><p>Dismounting, they tied their horses to the roadside and continued, beating the gong and shouting, "Please, Mr. Chen, come out! Congratulations on passing the examination!"</p><p>Their call reached the other side of the river.</p><p>"Passed? Passed what?"</p><p>"Oh! I remember San Gouzi mentioned a few days ago that Chen Xiucai had gone to take the examination again. He passed! He's going to become an official!"</p><p>"What kind of official is above a Xiucai?"</p><p>…</p><p>The villagers buzzed with excitement.  More and more people, alerted by the gong, rushed towards the school to see what was happening.</p><p>Outside the school.</p><p>"Good news for the esteemed Chen Zhenqing! First place in the provincial examination, Jieyuan!  Top scorer on the Golden List!"</p><p>The three men cheerfully presented the notice.</p><p>Chen Xiucai took it with the same calm he had shown after previous failures, sighing slightly.</p><p>Madam Chen, who had come out with him, understanding her husband's feelings, gently took his hand and quietly instructed their servant, "Mingyan, get the celebratory money."</p><p>"Yes!"</p><p>Mingyan happily went to fetch it.</p><p>It seemed that they had anticipated his success, as the Chen household was well-prepared.</p><p>Soon, the school and its surroundings were filled with people, celebrating and clamoring for the celebratory money.</p><p>Not only the villagers of Qipai Village, but also gentry from Qinggui Town and Jien County arrived, even the magistrate himself came to offer congratulations.</p><p>Even without his connection to the vice-premier, Chen Xiucai, as the Jieyuan, was practically guaranteed to pass the imperial examination.</p><p>The celebrations continued late into the night.</p><p>The next day.</p><p>The newly appointed Jieyuan did not stay home to entertain guests. Instead, he had food and drink prepared and sent to Qingyang Temple.</p><p>In the pavilion.</p><p>The food and drinks were laid out.</p><p>Xiao Wu and Yulang waited on them.</p><p>"We can't call him Chen Xiucai anymore. He's Mr. Chen now."</p><p>Qin Sang smiled as he offered Chen Zhenqing a cup.</p><p>"Master, please don't tease me. I know how much this Jieyuan title is actually worth,"</p><p>Chen Zhenqing took a large gulp of wine and sighed.</p><p>"Becoming Jieyuan isn't a bad thing.  It's a step up, my brother. You can finally pursue your ambitions. Why be so downcast?" Qin Sang shook his head slightly.</p><p>"Ambitions?"</p><p>Despite drinking little, Chen Zhenqing seemed somewhat drunk, his gaze distant.  "My teacher is getting old, and though he has returned to court, he feels time is running out. Among his students, I'm unremarkable, having been idle for many years.  In terms of governance and administration, I am far behind others and can't help my teacher much."</p><p>He paused, then said gravely, "I've decided that if I'm fortunate enough to pass the imperial examination, I will request a posting to a border county. I will serve diligently and benefit the people, hoping that even a century later, people will still remember the name Chen Zhenqing!"</p><p>He glanced at Yulang and Xiao Wu. "I will soon be leaving for the capital with my family.  This departure may be our last.  My only concern is these students."</p><p>Yulang's eyes reddened.</p><p>Xiao Wu sat quietly beside Qin Sang.</p><p>Over the years, they had spent countless days with Chen Zhenqing, and this bond was not easily broken.</p><p>Qin Sang sensed Chen Zhenqing's thoughts and smiled slightly. "Brother, speak your mind."</p><p>"Could Yulang take over the school?"</p><p>Chen Zhenqing's words surprised Yulang.</p><p>"Ah? Me?"</p><p>Yulang never expected the master to entrust the school to him. He stood up, pointing at himself.</p><p>"Many people want to succeed me, including those truly learned. But their true intentions are clear to me; they would not be content to remain in the countryside as teachers. Yulang's character, learning, and talent are plain to see, making him more than qualified to be a teacher! If he weren't averse to officialdom, we teacher and student could have ascended the Golden List together, becoming a legendary story!"</p><p>Chen Zhenqing looked at Qin Sang expectantly.</p><p>Qin Sang is Yu Lang's true master; without his permission, nothing can proceed.</p><p>At this moment, a patient seeking medicine entered the Daoist temple.</p><p>Qin Sang rose from his seat, and said to Yu Lang, “Your master will not interfere.  Think carefully about whether you can shoulder this responsibility.”</p><p>…</p><p>Two years later.</p><p>Midsummer.</p><p>The sound of reading filled the school.</p><p>A cool breeze from the bamboo forest lessened the summer heat. Yu Lang, now a teacher, finished his rounds of the primary school and climbed the bamboo tower.</p><p>Arguments echoed from within the tower.</p><p>It wasn't a quarrel, but a group of talented scholars debating scriptures.</p><p>Master Chen left, yet the number of students didn't decrease; indeed, even scholars from the county town preferred to come here to compose poetry and practice calligraphy.</p><p>“Brother Yu Lang is here! Come judge for us!”</p><p>Seeing Yu Lang, the crowd surged around him.</p><p>Yu Lang managed the school; though a teacher, he was around the same age as most present, hence the familiar address.</p><p>Finally escaping the crowd, Yu Lang walked to the window.</p><p>Xiao Wu sat there, chin in hands, gazing out the window.</p><p>She emanated a cold aura, keeping people at a distance.</p><p>Since that incident, Yu Lang noticed a clear barrier between his senior sister and outsiders.</p><p>Furthermore, Yan forbade women from taking the imperial examinations, and his senior sister's friends gradually left the school, leaving fewer and fewer behind.</p><p>Thankfully, she didn't lose heart and withdraw into herself as before; she remained at the school.</p><p>Hoping she would overcome this, Yu Lang sighed, producing a letter.  “Senior Sister, a letter from Master has arrived. He's requested a transfer and will serve as an official in Danyang County, Zhongning Prefecture, Luzhou.”</p><p>“Danyang County, bordering Liang?”</p><p>Xiao Wu took the letter, reading it carefully.</p><p>“Yes! After the brutal war between Yan and Liang decades ago, which nearly allowed surrounding countries to take advantage, both sides agreed to a truce and recuperation.  Today, both monarchs are peace-loving; although Danyang County is on the border, there shouldn't be any major issues.  Furthermore, Master has the protective amulet we gave him. I plan to contact the city god and the spirits of Zhongning Prefecture for assistance if necessary.”</p><p>Hearing Yu Lang’s thorough preparations, Xiao Wu said nothing more.</p><p>After school, the two, as always, carried their books and walked towards Qingyang Temple as the sun set.</p><p>Passing Qipai Village, villagers greeted them warmly; some even asked Yu Lang when he would take the imperial examination.</p><p>Yu Lang hesitated, and only spoke after leaving the village. “Senior Sister, I heard news about Meng Yusu today.”</p><p>“Hm?”</p><p>Xiao Wu looked over, her expression unchanged.</p><p>“Meng Yusu seems to have gone mad. The Meng family moved out of Qinggui Town; no one knows where they went.  Master has cured countless cases of madness, so the Meng family is probably too ashamed to seek his help again.”</p><p>Yu Lang snorted coldly.</p><p>After the incident, they hadn’t deliberately sought Meng Yusu’s whereabouts.  Meng Yusu was reportedly taken by the magistrate and never reappeared at the school. It’s unclear when he was released, but he undoubtedly suffered greatly.</p><p>“Oh.”</p><p>Xiao Wu responded flatly.</p><p>Yu Lang wanted to ask his senior sister her current opinion of Meng Yusu, but his lips moved, and he ultimately didn't ask.</p><p>Back at Qingyang Temple.</p><p>The temple was empty.</p><p>At that moment.</p><p>Qin Sang was in the underground chamber, seated on the main altar.</p><p>Lightning surrounded him, electric serpents dancing around his body.</p><p>Most striking was the main altar beneath Qin Sang – it had become transparent, revealing countless intertwined thunderbolts, flashing brightly.</p><p>Within these thunderbolts, one point of light was exceptionally bright; from the outside, it appeared only as a light the size of a dragon's eye.</p><p>Yet this pinpoint seemed to possess infinite changes.</p><p>This point of light was the mysterious thunder talisman Qin Sang had been unable to decipher, the very core of the entire altar!</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>‘Rumble!’</p><p>…</p><p>The main altar and the underground chamber trembled.</p><p>Inside the main altar, the world of thunder, with its lightning colliding and consuming each other, presented a scene of perpetual apocalyptic chaos.</p><p>Suddenly, Qin Sang made a hand seal, silently chanting an incantation, and a bolt of lightning shot from his fingertip.</p><p>The lightning struck the altar below, piercing it.</p><p>A ripple effect followed. As this lightning entered, the already chaotic power of the thunder erupted completely.</p><p>This lightning did not disappear after it struck.</p><p>One end remained connected to Qin Sang's fingertip, the other stirring the sea of thunder within the altar.</p><p>Qin Sang manipulated the lightning like a musician playing a stringed instrument, his hand's movements rhythmic, causing waves in the lightning.</p><p>Thus, the lightning, trembling, slowly probed towards the core of the main altar, gradually approaching the light spot.</p><p>The lightning drew ever closer to the light spot.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes narrowed. Without hesitation, he dispersed the lightning at his fingertip with a sharp "pop."</p><p>Simultaneously, the main altar violently shook.</p><p>The power of the thunder seemed to have finally found an outlet, surging out of the main altar along the path of the lightning!</p><p>Qin Sang was in the direct path, but fortunately, he was prepared.</p><p>He floated into the air, his hands transforming into lightning palms, meeting the thunder head-on. Two streams of lightning converged in his palms, indistinguishable from each other.</p><p>His palms slowly but firmly pressed down, finally pressing against the main altar, subduing the power of the thunder.</p><p>The lightning abruptly vanished, plunging the underground chamber into darkness.</p><p>Qin Sang descended, gazing at the main altar, pondering for a moment before murmuring, "It's still not quite ready."</p><p>Then, his lips moved.</p><p>On the ground,</p><p>Luo Hou was curled up on a huge cushion.</p><p>For years, it had been mostly asleep, but Qin Sang had awakened it today.</p><p>Tai Yi, mimicking Luo Hou, had been secluded in a side hall consolidating his cultivation, and was also startled awake.</p><p>'Swish! Swish!'</p><p>The two demons entered the underground chamber and bowed respectfully.</p><p>"Greetings, Master!"</p><p>"Greetings, Sir!"</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, surveying the two demons.</p><p>He sensed almost no agitation from Tai Yi.</p><p>As for Luo Hou, taking over a new body and refining it from scratch normally takes a long time.  Thanks to the pills Qin Sang gave him—rare medicines from a powerful demon—Luo Hou's progress had been extremely rapid recently; he was improving by leaps and bounds and should soon be fully restored.</p><p>"You two will descend the mountain now and do something for me."</p><p>Qin Sang flicked out a bolt of lightning.</p><p>The bolt exploded before the two demons, revealing a map composed primarily of light points.</p><p>This was the diagram of the altar array that Qin Sang had deduced through his understanding of the main altar.</p><p>The brightest point represented the main altar itself; the others indicated the locations of the branch altars.</p><p>"You will act separately, using this map to locate all the branch altars!"</p><p>Qin Sang said gravely.</p><p>His calculations weren't completely accurate; there might be omissions, which the demons would now verify. He would continue his deductions here.</p><p>The missing piece, preventing him from accessing the 'light spot,' was the complete array diagram.</p><p>Once he obtained the complete altar array diagram, Qin Sang would be confident in repairing the main altar!</p><p>Qin Sang waved his sleeve, sending out several streams of light. "Some branch altars might be in Yun Du Mountain and Mu Luo Mountain. Luo Hou, you're not adept at escape techniques, so take the earth-traveling boat. Tai Yi, your true form is a talisman; activating the lightning talisman should allow you to control all the lightning talisman power. With these protections, unless you encounter a powerful cultivator, you can handle any situation."</p><p>"Yes, Master!"</p><p>The two demons, seeing Qin Sang's seriousness, dared not show any negligence, committed the map to memory, and received their orders.</p><p>After leaving Qing Yang Temple, the two demons briefly conferred, then separated, heading east and west.</p><p>Qin Sang strolled out of the main hall. Yu Lang was closing the temple and quickly greeted his master.</p><p>Qin Sang said, "These past two years, you've been a teacher and your character has become much calmer than before."</p><p>Yu Lang didn't expect his master to praise him; he was momentarily stunned, a little shy, and his composure completely vanished into a silly grin.</p><p>Of all his disciples, this one was the one Qin Sang cared for the most. He had been by Qin Sang's side since entering the immortal path and Qin Sang even specially prepared and administered medicinal baths for him.</p><p>In a way, Yu Lang benefited from Xiao Wu; otherwise, he wouldn't be much better than his senior brothers.</p><p>The downside was that Yu Lang mainly interacted with ordinary people.</p><p>He had never trained in the world of cultivation, hadn't experienced the life-or-death struggles and betrayals among cultivators—his experiences were the polar opposite of Qin Sang's.</p><p>Always under Qin Sang's protection, he remained childish and easily distracted.  Without the medicinal baths, his cultivation speed wouldn't have been so rapid.</p><p>Qin Sang wanted him to settle down, which would benefit Yu Lang.</p><p>"This is a Foundation Establishment Pill; it's enough for you to break through.  During this time, settle the academy's affairs and then focus on establishing your foundation."</p><p>Qin Sang produced a jade bottle. "After you break through, Master may need to retreat often, so you will manage Qing Yang Temple."</p><p>Yu Lang was first delighted, then startled, solemnly accepting the jade bottle. "Disciple will not disappoint Master's expectations."</p><p>"Go then."</p><p>Looking at his disciple, Qin Sang was thoughtful.</p><p>After Foundation Establishment, he would need to choose a cultivation technique for Yu Lang.</p><p>Qin Sang had observed Yu Lang's experiences these past years. He hadn't discouraged Yu Lang's martial arts pursuits, wanting to see if he could eventually discover something.</p><p>Of course, not right now.</p><p>Once he had achieved a certain cultivation level, if Yu Lang's enthusiasm remained, there might be a chance.</p><p>However, Yu Lang's obsession with martial arts—would the path of body refinement be more suitable for him?
