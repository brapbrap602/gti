<h1>Chapter 646: The Sky-Eye Butterfly</h1><p>“Our next destination is Butterfly Valley.”</p><p>Qin Sang took out a map and checked the direction.</p><p>Butterfly Valley wasn't far from the poisonous swamp; traveling by sword, they could reach it in two days.</p><p>As the name suggests, Butterfly Valley is a beautiful valley teeming with countless butterflies.</p><p>Those who have been to Butterfly Valley can only describe it with one word—beautiful!</p><p>Thousands upon thousands of butterflies swirl and dance in the valley amidst a profusion of flowers.  The beauty never ceases, regardless of the season.</p><p>These butterflies are ordinary, mundane insects, not spirit insects. The valley itself is also unremarkable, without any restrictions or spirit herbs.</p><p>Initially, cultivators who discovered Butterfly Valley suspected hidden treasures, believing they attracted so many butterflies.</p><p>They searched the valley thoroughly, confirming it was an ordinary place.  However, due to its geographical location, the spiritual energy is denser than elsewhere, and it's sheltered from cold winds, enjoying perpetual spring.</p><p>It is said that the Sky-Eye Butterfly, a spirit insect, lives in the valley.</p><p>Qin Sang came for the Sky-Eye Butterfly, but he was hesitant about using it as his life-bound insect.</p><p>The Wu tribe considers the Sky-Eye Butterfly the least suitable insect for this purpose. Information about the Sky-Eye Butterfly in the Imperial Spirit Sect is also incomplete, derived from a damaged ancient scroll.</p><p>The Imperial Spirit Sect records describe the Sky-Eye Butterfly as roughly the size of an ordinary butterfly, with light wings and a graceful form. Its most striking feature is its magnificent wings.</p><p>In the sunlight, its wings shimmer with a pale sky-blue hue. As it flits, they resemble waves cresting on a deep blue sea, flashing with rainbow-like colors.</p><p>With its wings spread, it appears surrounded by waves and neon lights, breathtakingly beautiful, like a dream.</p><p>Furthermore, its wings bear patterns resembling eyes.</p><p>This is how it got its name: Sky-Eye Butterfly.</p><p>In fact, the eyes on the Sky-Eye Butterfly's wings are not merely decorative. After its third molt, these eyes become actual sky-eyes, the source of its innate abilities.</p><p>The Sky-Eye Butterfly possesses the abilities of concealment and shapeshifting from its second molt.</p><p>If it disguises itself as an ordinary butterfly, it leaves no trace. Once hidden, it is said to be able to evade the spiritual sense of even a Nascent Soul cultivator.</p><p>This powerful life-saving ability is only useful for survival.</p><p>Because aside from this, the Sky-Eye Butterfly has no other abilities. It is as fragile as an ordinary butterfly; a strong wind could kill it. It is prone to premature death.</p><p>It relies on its keen perception of danger and its abilities of shapeshifting and concealment to survive in the harsh wilderness.</p><p>If a cultivator chooses the Sky-Eye Butterfly as a life-bound insect, they will receive no help in combat before the third molt.</p><p>The Sky-Eye Butterfly’s inherent weakness remains until its third molt, though its wing-eyes will develop magical abilities.</p><p>The Imperial Spirit Sect records are vague about its abilities, mentioning only one:  the ability to see through illusions and barriers.</p><p>Its true power is not clearly documented.</p><p>The Sky-Eye Butterfly undoubtedly has at least the potential for a fourth molt, but even less is known about its fourth molt.  The records contain only one sentence: “Legend says the Sky-Eye Butterfly’s sky-eyes will continue to evolve.”</p><p>This is why Qin Sang hesitates.</p><p>Qin Sang cultivates a life-bound insect primarily to address the problem of the forbidden talisman fragments within his body and to aid him in his breakthrough to the Nascent Soul stage.</p><p>He already possesses a life-bound spirit sword, so the combat prowess of the insect is not his main concern.</p><p>Otherwise, it would be putting the cart before the horse.</p><p>But it cannot be too weak either. If it offers no help, yet occupies a precious life-bound slot and demands significant resources and effort to nurture, it would be a waste.</p><p>This is the Sky-Eye Butterfly’s problem: its fragility.  Unlike the Dark Cicada, it cannot aid in combat.  And Qin Sang is unsure about the power of the Sky-Eye Butterfly's abilities, as they can only be verified after its third molt.</p><p>If it turns out to be comparable to ordinary eye-related techniques, it will be too late to regret it.</p><p>Like other strange insects on the Strange Insect List, the Sky-Eye Butterfly is incredibly difficult to cultivate. Special methods are required to feed it and accelerate its cultivation speed, necessitating considerable resources, time, and effort from Qin Sang.</p><p>However, after careful consideration, Qin Sang ultimately included the Sky-Eye Butterfly in his options.</p><p>Being listed on the Strange Insect List speaks to its undeniable potential.</p><p>The strange insects with detailed records have high potential, difficult molts, and powerful abilities in return; the Sky-Eye Butterfly should not be much different. It's a gamble worth taking.</p><p>Seeing through illusions often works wonders, especially when exploring mysteries.  This might not even be the full extent of the Tianmu butterfly's abilities.</p><p>If no better insect is available, Qin Sang would choose the Tianmu butterfly.</p><p>Provided she can catch one.</p><p>Two days later, Qin Sang arrived at the mountain range where Butterfly Valley is located.  Nearing the valley, she frowned slightly, landing atop a peak and looking down at the insect cage at her waist.</p><p>A faint, sharp rustling sound came from inside.</p><p>The fat silkworm was gnawing on the cage again!</p><p>Qin Sang was exasperated. For the past two days, the silkworm had eaten and slept, eaten and slept.  Whenever it woke up and found nothing to eat, it would gnaw relentlessly on the cage, demanding more food.</p><p>It stubbornly refused anything but the Chihuo Liujin fruit.</p><p>Qin Sang tried every elixir, medicine, and even poison she had on her, but the silkworm wouldn't touch any of it. It didn't even glance at them, instead spitting and rolling its eyes, seemingly offended by Qin Sang's offerings.</p><p>Qin Sang only noticed it even *had* eyes because of her sharp eyesight.</p><p>Such a spirit insect was unsuitable as a life-bound insect; it was impossible to cultivate.</p><p>The creature wasn't entirely stupid, though. It knew that only Qin Sang possessed the Chihuo Liujin, so even if she tried to get rid of it, it would immediately scramble back.</p><p>Once it had its fill, it would happily go back to sleep.</p><p>But it hadn't acknowledged her as its master!</p><p>Beyond the methods of the Yuling Sect's insect-controlling techniques and the Wu tribe's life-bound insect sorcery, a rare third method exists for a cultivator to control a spirit insect: the insect voluntarily submitting to its master.</p><p>It is said that when a spirit insect willingly submits, the cultivator and insect achieve perfect mental harmony, bringing unexpected benefits.</p><p>Such an event is rare and unpredictable.</p><p>Spirit insects have limited intelligence, making them difficult for cultivators to understand.</p><p>Some have tried using methods designed for humans on insects – staging a false ambush, dramatically appearing to save the insect, and bestowing kindness upon it.</p><p>This proved futile; the insect showed no gratitude.</p><p>Qin Sang patiently fed it for two days, but seeing the silkworm's continued indifference, she decided to take action.</p><p>Its appetite wasn't huge, but it was relentless.</p><p>"Chihuo Liujin is incredibly precious! I only have one fruit left, needed for my life-bound insect's transformation.  I won't let you, you stupid silkworm, use it as food!"</p><p>Qin Sang snorted, taking out the Ten Directions Yama Banner and summoning a thread of Nine Netherworld Demon Fire, shaping it into a fine needle.  She then opened the insect cage.</p>
