<h1>Chapter 656: Seven Kills Palace</h1><p>Coincidentally, the severed arm of this ancient corpse was the left one!</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't help but overthink.</p><p>If this severed-armed ancient corpse was him, then where exactly was the Seven Kills Palace? Why was he transported here, falling from the sky, only to appear later in the Western Xinjiang, floating on the river?</p><p>Their master was named Du Han.</p><p>The three people whose souls Qin Sang searched were all Du Han's disciples, but their relationship with him was far less close than Du Xian's.</p><p>Du Xian was Du Han's eldest disciple, exceptionally talented, and with the hope of forming his Gold Core. Du Han treated him like his own son, sharing some secrets with him. This search for the Thousand-Hand Spider Fruit was also to help Du Xian with his breakthrough.</p><p>Du Xian's cultivation was at the Pseudo Core Formation realm. Qin Sang had already decided to refine him into a corpse puppet, so he didn't search his soul to avoid its complete destruction. Instead, he interrogated him and verified the information using the Soul Snatching Curse.</p><p>After learning everything Du Xian knew, Qin Sang was even more surprised.</p><p>He stood at the summit of the Five Venom Sect, looking around, somewhat bewildered.</p><p>According to Du Xian, the Seven Kills Palace was a secret realm discovered by humans, not located in the Wu God Continent, but within human-controlled territory, opening only once every many years.</p><p>Du Han had set off two years ago to go to the Seven Kills Palace, leaving the Wu God Continent and only returning recently.</p><p>Now, Qin Sang wasn't so sure.</p><p>If the ancient corpse from the Seven Kills Palace was indeed him, with such a distance from the Wu God Continent, why did it appear in the Western Xinjiang river? Was there some strange restriction within the Seven Kills Palace, or did someone bring him out?</p><p>Why was Du Han searching for the ancient corpse in Western Xinjiang?</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't figure it out.</p><p>He had thought he could unravel the mystery of the floating corpse, but unexpectedly, he'd stumbled into an even bigger enigma.</p><p>Seven Kills Palace, Purple Star Palace…</p><p>What connection did these two places have?</p><p>Du Xian knew nothing about what happened inside the Seven Kills Palace.</p><p>After returning, Du Han led them into Western Xinjiang. However, inquiring about the ancient corpse was only incidental; Du Han's main purpose seemed to be searching for a certain spiritual herb, and he had gone ahead alone.</p><p>Du Xian, along with several junior disciples, came to the Five Venom Sect to seize the Thousand-Hand Spider Fruit. The information about the fruit also came from Du Han.</p><p>It seemed that finding Du Han was necessary to understand the whole story.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered silently. From Du Xian and the others, he learned that after hearing that the Thousand-Hand Spider Fruit had been taken by a Gold Core cultivator, they had sent a junior disciple to summon Du Han, who would arrive in about half a month.</p><p>Staying at the Five Venom Sect, he had ample time to prepare and ambush Du Han.</p><p>However, ambushing Du Han wouldn't be easy.</p><p>Du Han had been in the Gold Core stage for decades. Although he hadn't broken through to the mid-Gold Core stage yet, he was already approaching the bottleneck, his strength far exceeding that of ordinary early Gold Core cultivators.</p><p>Moreover, Wu Clan cultivators couldn't be treated the same as human cultivators. Because of their natal Gu insects, fighting against a Wu Clan cultivator often meant facing a one-versus-two situation.</p><p>With Qin Sang's strength, dealing with an early Gold Core cultivator was a breeze, and he wasn't afraid of a mid-Gold Core expert either. However, to ensure he could kill Du Han without fail, careful planning was needed.</p><p>Furthermore, Qin Sang preferred to capture Du Han alive and investigate the truth.</p><p>Therefore, Qin Sang carefully searched for information about Du Han during the soul searching, but unexpectedly, Du Han was very cautious and secretive.</p><p>Even his disciples didn't know what kind of spiritual insect his natal Gu was; they only knew he possessed a magical treasure, a reward from the Li Wu Palace after he formed his Gold Core, and its power was not weak.</p><p>…</p><p>Black Wind Valley.</p><p>Qin Sang revisited the old place. As soon as he arrived near the poisonous spring, he smelled a faint, strange fragrance. This fragrance was the residue of the ripened Thousand-Hand Spider Fruit, lingering even after so long.</p><p>When Qin Sang had been here last time, there hadn't been any scent at all.</p><p>Arriving at the bank of the poisonous spring, Qin Sang easily found the source, which was the spring's eye. The overflowing fragrance also exposed the restriction around the spring's eye.</p><p>"What a sophisticated restriction! If not for the ripening of the Thousand-Hand Spider Fruit exposing it, I'm afraid I wouldn't have noticed anything unusual here even if I stayed by the poisonous spring for a year."</p><p>Qin Sang sighed with emotion. After a few attempts, he quickly found a way to break the restriction and flashed into the restricted area.</p><p>Inside was a square chamber, clearly excavated artificially, very neat and clean. In the middle of the chamber stood a small tree about half a person tall, with slender branches and leaves, and a green fruit hanging on it.</p><p>This was the Thousand-Hand Spider Fruit tree.</p><p>There were originally three Thousand-Hand Spider Fruits on it. Cultivator Cui Xuan had discovered and picked one; he had obtained the second one after it ripened; this was the third one, not yet ripe.</p><p>The shape of the Thousand-Hand Spider Fruit was very peculiar, like two spiders tightly embracing each other. There were many fine lines on both sides, resembling countless spider legs intertwined.</p><p>The unripe Thousand-Hand Spider Fruit was green, turning purplish-black after ripening, resembling a poisonous spider even more.</p><p>In fact, the Thousand-Hand Spider Fruit was indeed a poisonous fruit. It could be used to concoct various potent poisons, and poisonous insects could also benefit greatly from consuming it. It was an extremely rare natural treasure.</p><p>After Qin Sang entered the stone chamber, the insect basket at his waist suddenly vibrated.</p><p>It was that fat silkworm again!</p><p>Qin Sang took out the fat silkworm and found it staring intently at the Thousand-Hand Spider Fruit with a look of longing. The fruit seemed to hold great attraction for it.</p><p>After capturing the fat silkworm, this was the first time Qin Sang had seen it interested in a spiritual fruit other than Redfire Gilded Gold.</p><p>The fat silkworm had been taught a lesson by Qin Sang many times and was now more obedient. Although it craved the Thousand-Hand Spider Fruit, it didn't dare act rashly. Its small eyes looked at Qin Sang pitifully, as if on the verge of tears, and it let out a pleading sound.</p><p>"This fruit isn't ripe yet. What use is it to you if you eat it? It's a waste!"</p><p>Qin Sang remained unmoved, urging the Nine Nether Demonic Fire to warn the fat silkworm to behave.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the fat silkworm was desperate for the Thousand-Hand Spider Fruit, unafraid even of the Nine Nether Demonic Fire. It wriggled its fat body, shamelessly rubbing against Qin Sang's finger, pleading desperately, as if the unripe Thousand-Hand Spider Fruit could still benefit it greatly.</p><p>Ignoring the fat silkworm, Qin Sang walked around the Thousand-Hand Spider Fruit tree, carefully examining the restrictions within the chamber.</p><p>Finally, Qin Sang shook his head, finding the restrictions here too sophisticated for him to tamper with. Since these restrictions couldn't even block the fragrance of the Thousand-Hand Spider Fruit, he couldn't think of any good solution.</p><p>The third Thousand-Hand Spider Fruit would take another hundred years to ripen. Once ripe, its fragrance would permeate everywhere, impossible to conceal unless he returned to guard it then.</p><p>Qin Sang thought to himself, after ambushing Du Han, he definitely couldn't stay in Western Xinjiang.</p><p>A hundred years later, if he wasn't dead, he would at least be a mid-Gold Core cultivator, and he might not even value the Thousand-Hand Spider Fruit anymore.</p><p>Moreover, some sects would cast secret techniques similar to Soul Lamps on their Gold Core disciples. If the Li Wu Palace learned of Du Han's death, they would definitely come here to investigate.</p><p>If the Li Wu Palace sent experts to search this place, this chamber wouldn't remain hidden. Rather than letting the Li Wu Palace benefit, it was better to put it to good use and let the fat silkworm eat it.</p><p>Thinking of this, Qin Sang released the fat silkworm, tossing it over.</p><p>The fat silkworm was overjoyed, crawling onto the Thousand-Hand Spider Fruit and immediately starting to devour it.</p>
