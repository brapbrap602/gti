<h1>Chapter 971: The Jade Flute</h1><p>Chapter 971: The Jade Flute</p><p>“Now’s our chance, before she recovers!”</p><p>Yuan Zhu unleashed a double-palm strike, his long hair flying wildly, bordering on frenzy, a phantom of a giant serpent materializing behind him.</p><p>The serpent roared, ferocious and monstrous, instantly leaving his body, rising above the monstrous waves, its gaping maw aimed at the Nine-Phoenix King.</p><p>‘Roar!’</p><p>Amidst the raging wind and waves, a series of mournful cries echoed.</p><p>Gu Heng, always known for his composure, found this outcome unbelievable.</p><p>He roared at the heavens, his voice devoid of resentment, filled instead with profound sorrow, his grief shattering, heartbreaking to hear.</p><p>His voice seemed to pierce the void, a silent question to someone, somewhere.</p><p>The Fairy in Colorful Garments watched her most admired Ninth Aunt, receiving no response, the light of hope in her eyes gradually fading, replaced by hatred.</p><p>The other demons were startled awake by Yuan Zhu.  Having witnessed countless cruelties, they instantly grasped the danger of their situation.</p><p>Fail to kill the Nine-Phoenix King, and they would all die!</p><p>Amidst the mournful cries, a brilliant red light enveloped Gu Heng. In an instant, a phantom of a red serpent appeared, even more ferocious than Yuan Zhu’s serpent, its scales densely packed, seeming almost real.</p><p>The red serpent roared, its voice merging with Gu Heng's.</p><p>A ball of crimson light rapidly formed in its mouth.  The serpent’s head locked onto the Nine-Phoenix King, as endless crimson light converged there, swelling at an alarming rate.</p><p>The next moment, the crimson light elongated, demon fire flashed, and a crimson spear materialized. The red serpent’s tail whipped, and with a sharp, deafening roar, the crimson spear flickered, vanishing from sight before reappearing above the Nine-Phoenix King.</p><p>‘Sizzle!’</p><p>The spear moved with lightning speed, its point aimed at the Nine-Phoenix King.</p><p>The Fairy in Colorful Garments channeled all her hatred towards the Nine-Phoenix King, once her revered leader.</p><p>A phoenix shadow appeared, its cry shrill and piercing.</p><p>A longbow appeared in the Fairy’s hands, its decoration incredibly ornate, its ends seeming to be formed from two real phoenixes.</p><p>‘Twang!’</p><p>The bowstring resonated. The phoenix shadow swooped, transforming into an arrow.</p><p>The Fairy in Colorful Garments aimed the bow at the Nine-Phoenix King, her hands trembling despite herself. Finally, she closed her eyes, releasing the arrow.</p><p>At the same time, the other demons attacked.</p><p>For a moment, brilliant lights flashed, attacks raining down like a storm, threatening to overwhelm the Nine-Phoenix King.</p><p>They were all powerful demons, at least at the late Core Formation stage. Their combined attack was incredibly powerful; even a typical Nascent Soul cultivator would have to retreat.</p><p>Qin Sang hesitated, before finally deciding to join the attack.</p><p>If the Nine-Phoenix King defeated them one by one, he would not escape either.</p><p>Just then, Qin Sang noticed the Nine-Phoenix King’s expression, a hint of disdain in her eyes as she watched the attacks.  He felt a sudden jolt, sensing something was amiss.</p><p>A strong sense of foreboding washed over him. Just as he was about to summon his ebony sword, he changed his incantation, decisively summoning the Thunder Control Technique.</p><p>A dull rumble echoed within him, as thunder enveloped Qin Sang.</p><p>“Alas!”</p><p>Facing the combined assault, the Nine-Phoenix King showed no panic.  Seeing the Fairy’s gaze, a flicker of guilt crossed her eyes. She murmured, “I had hoped to take you to a quiet place, to let you live out your remaining years in peace…”</p><p>Her self-reproach faded, her gaze turning cold.</p><p>Then, a light flashed from the Nine-Phoenix King’s palm. It was not a blade or any other weapon, but a delicate jade flute. Holding it to her lips, she looked coldly at the demons, her lips parted slightly, and she began to play.</p><p>The hurricane and waves were normally loud enough to muffle any other sound.</p><p>But as the jade flute sounded, the light melody, despite the conditions, reached everyone’s ears. The flute’s music was melodious, but it was a death knell.</p><p>“Aaah!”</p><p>The weakest demon, a bear, was the first to succumb.</p><p>He felt his blood boiling, unable to suppress it.  A terrible flame seemed to rise incessantly from his blood and marrow.</p><p>Like a malignant tumor, it instantly spread throughout his body, burning his internal organs.</p><p>His skin rapidly lost its luster, like parched earth cracking open, flames erupting from within.  In an instant, the bear demon became a human torch, consumed by fire, screaming in agony.</p><p>“Such a vicious ‘Burning Blood Technique’…”</p><p>Queen Jiu Feng’s pupils constricted, her heart pounding.</p><p>The same brutal scene played out repeatedly; one by one, the beasts were engulfed in flames, their screams echoing.  Even the strongest among them, Gu Heng and the Rainbow Fairy, were not spared.</p><p>Death descended.</p><p>It turned out the clan had long planted a hidden mechanism within them.</p><p>Despair etched itself on the demons’ faces; their hearts heavy with sorrow.  Their only recourse was a desperate struggle, to destroy the jade flute in Queen Jiu Feng’s hands.</p><p>‘Rumble…boom…’</p><p>Dragon shadows roared, crimson spears flashed like lightning, phoenix arrows danced wildly…</p><p>The demons fought with all their might, their assault a storm of attacks.</p><p>Queen Jiu Feng defended herself while continuously playing the jade flute, her other hand conjuring a protective barrier.  Then, she sensed something, and looked up sharply.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>Amidst the barrage of attacks, a bolt of lightning pierced the void, dazzling and breathtaking, radiating terrifying destructive energy.  Even Gu Heng’s crimson spear paled in comparison.</p><p>From this lightning, Queen Jiu Feng felt a hint of danger.</p><p>The lightning arrived in an instant.</p><p>The barrier shattered, Queen Jiu Feng’s face changing. She regretted her carelessness; she hadn’t expected these younger demons to unleash such a fierce attack.</p><p>She retreated, her other hand striking upwards, revealing a seven-colored jade bracelet. The bracelet spun, rapidly expanding in size.</p><p>Just as Queen Jiu Feng was about to be struck by the lightning, the bracelet intercepted it at the last moment.</p><p>‘Bang!’</p><p>The seven-colored jade bracelet trembled violently, its light flickering, acting like a tight band, constricting the lightning.  It recoiled repeatedly, yet stubbornly held the lightning at bay.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>A cascade of attacks followed, instantly engulfing the jade bracelet and Queen Jiu Feng.</p><p>The attacks continued, dazzling and blinding, obscuring Queen Jiu Feng’s form. But the scene the demons anticipated didn't happen; the demonic flute music showed no sign of stopping, instead growing faster, each note a death knell.</p><p>They had formed a siege, but Queen Jiu Feng easily countered it with her flute, driving them to the brink of destruction.</p><p>Their desperate struggle had failed to save them.</p><p>The demons were utterly hopeless, the burning flames searing their very souls. Their only option was to flee, yet even that proved futile.</p><p>In the distance, balls of fire fell from the sky. Some plunged into the sea, swallowed by the waves, leaving only a trail of blood mist.  Others collided with a grey whirlwind, easily torn to shreds.</p>
