<h1>Chapter 735: The Grand Shaman</h1><p>The Wang sisters opened their mouths to speak, but Qin Sang said gravely, "This isn't a place to stay long. Come with me!"</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang's serious expression, the two women immediately realized the situation was worse than they had imagined. Without a word, they organized their people to assist Qin Sang.</p><p>At that moment, a middle-aged man stepped forward, bowing and saying, "Are you Daoist Qingfeng? I am sent by Elder Zou with a message for you…"</p><p>Qin Sang turned, assessing the man.  Seeing his distinguished bearing, he nodded. "I am Qingfeng.  What news? Speak quickly."</p><p>"This…"</p><p>The middle-aged man hesitated, then whispered, "Elder Zou says that in five years, the Grand Shaman of the Wu tribe will personally break the Immortal Array of the Qisha Hall.  Daoist Qingfeng should prepare accordingly."</p><p>"Five years. Understood."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded. There was still ample time.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang froze, suspecting he had misheard. "What? The Grand Shaman of the Wu tribe will break the array? Qisha Hall is a sacred site of the human race, containing ancient artifacts.  Wasn't it always forbidden for Wu tribe Yuan Ying cultivators to enter? Why would they ask the Grand Shaman to intervene?"</p><p>Grand Shaman was a specific title within the Wu tribe.</p><p>Only top experts at the late Yuan Ying stage were eligible to be called Grand Shaman.</p><p>Currently, there was only one openly known Grand Shaman in the Wu tribe, residing in Wushen Mountain. Qin Sang only learned this from Elder Zou when they passed by Wushen Mountain.</p><p>The various human factions had always been wary of the Wu tribe, fearing they would obtain treasures from Qisha Hall. Preventing Wu tribe Yuan Ying cultivators from interfering was a universally accepted stance.</p><p>Unexpectedly, after a recent war between the two races, the humans had compromised regarding Qisha Hall.</p><p>This greatly surprised Qin Sang. There must have been some deal between the two races, otherwise, this situation would be impossible.</p><p>He wondered what treasure in Qisha Hall could attract the Grand Shaman.</p><p>Could the opening of Qisha Hall twenty years ahead of schedule be related to the Wu tribe?</p><p>The situation in Qisha Hall would likely become much more complex and unpredictable.</p><p>The middle-aged man said, "Elder Zou said this news has been confirmed by the Merchant League.  As for the reason, Elder Zou hasn't been informed. He only said Daoist Qingfeng should be cautious.  Also, the Merchant League requires Daoist Qingfeng to rendezvous with others on Dahuang Island before Qisha Hall opens, and proceed together without delay…"</p><p>Qin Sang led his people in their breakout, pondering silently.</p><p>He hadn't expected this Qisha Hall expedition to involve the Wu tribe, especially a top expert at the late Yuan Ying stage.</p><p>No one could predict what would happen in Qisha Hall then.</p><p>"Shouldn't the human experts be no weaker than the Wu tribe?  Doesn't that mean there will be at least two late Yuan Ying cultivators in Qisha Hall? If they fight… how will I survive?"</p><p>From Xiaohan Region to Canglang Sea Region, Nascent Soul cultivators only existed in legends. The acknowledged top experts were late Yuan Ying cultivators.</p><p>In the vast Canglang Sea Region, there were supposedly only a handful of such cultivators. Xiaohan Region didn't even have one.</p><p>The thought of being in the same secret realm with them chilled Qin Sang.  He could only pray that they weren't after the Heavenly Pagoda.</p><p>Just as Qin Sang was lost in thought, a thunderous roar echoed from the sky.</p><p>For a moment, the entire battlefield fell silent.</p><p>Qin Sang looked up in shock, discovering two bell-like, fierce eyes glaring at him from among the demonic beasts.  They belonged to a giant turtle.</p><p>The turtle was enormous, its shell covered in mysterious runes that shone with a mystical light, indicating extremely strong defenses.</p><p>This demon beast was a late Core Formation stage cultivator!</p><p>"It's him!"</p><p>Qin Sang recognized the demon beast, his heart tightening.</p><p>He had lost one of his two flying night rakshas because of this turtle.</p><p>After subduing the two-headed Rakshasa, Qin Sang had moved on from hunting early Core Formation demonic beasts to mid-Core Formation ones, accumulating considerable wealth.</p><p>The demonic beasts he encountered were either unintelligent or weaker than his two-headed Rakshasa, so he hadn't considered replacing it.</p><p>But even cautious people stumble sometimes.</p><p>Once, this turtle had discovered Qin Sang, chasing him for a whole day. He had only managed to escape after setting up a confusing formation, losing one of his flying night rakshas, forged from Du Han Golden Core.</p><p>He hadn't expected to encounter it here again.</p><p>Moreover, the beast seemed to remember him, its eyes filled with murderous intent.</p><p>Beside the giant turtle were more than ten other Core Formation demonic beasts.  Among them, cultivators were under attack.  Qin Sang saw a familiar face —  Yuan San Zhenren.</p><p>Yuan San Zhenren, a late-stage Golden Core cultivator, was said to be on the verge of reaching the Nascent Soul stage, making him one of the most powerful figures on Wu Yuan Island.</p><p>The woman had said that everyone fought for themselves when Mu Yuan Island fell, and it seemed to be true. Even Yuan San Zhenren was trapped, with only a handful of people left by his side.</p><p>“Roar! Roar!”</p><p>The giant turtle glared at Qin Sang, letting out enraged roars. At that moment, two large demons broke away from the battle, apparently following the turtle's orders, and swooped down.</p><p>These two were mid-stage demon core demons, incredibly ferocious, and not to be underestimated.</p><p>Their departure gave Yuan San Zhenren and the others a brief respite, but Qin Sang was in trouble.</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't expected the turtle's hatred to be so strong.  He inwardly cursed his bad luck, realizing that those with him would be caught in the crossfire.</p><p>Qin Sang quickly shouted to the Wang sisters, “Follow the Flying Night Rakshasa and escape!  With the Rakshasa’s help, you should be able to break through.  Once you’re safe, immediately contact the other islands. Tell them the entire Demon Sea is in turmoil; this beast tide is unlike anything we've seen before. With so many strong cultivators dying here, they won’t be safe either.  They need to send reinforcements quickly!”</p><p>In a battle of this scale, the Flying Night Rakshasa's strength was insufficient; it couldn't make much of a difference.  Using it to help the two women escape and get reinforcements was the best course of action.</p><p>After his breakthrough, his cultivation and spiritual sense had improved, making controlling the Flying Night Rakshasa much easier, even at a distance.</p><p>The Wang sisters understood the urgency and obeyed. All the remaining cultivators surrounded the Flying Night Rakshasa, forming a spearhead, and fought their way out.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced back.  The two demons were indeed heading straight for him.</p><p>He paused for a moment, then called out to his two-headed…creature… and charged in another direction. The two demons followed, their eyes fixed only on Qin Sang.</p><p>These two demons were incredibly fast.</p><p>Qin Sang could normally easily outrun them, but surrounded by the beast tide, his speed was significantly hampered.</p><p>Furthermore, the sea beasts seemed to have received orders and attacked with even more ferocity, some even using their bodies to ram into his sword light.  Qin Sang could easily kill them, but his speed was inevitably limited, and as he killed one group, another would appear, seemingly endless.</p>
