<h1>Chapter 957: Crisis</h1><p>Chapter 957: Crisis</p><p>Deep in the mountains, hidden within a desolate wilderness, lay a cave concealed by powerful seals.  The cave's location was extremely secluded; the concealing seals made it nearly impossible to detect, even for cultivators flying overhead.</p><p>Suddenly, a flash of strange light erupted from within the cave, followed by a figure dashing out—a middle-aged cultivator dressed as a Daoist priest.  Emerging from the cave, the middle-aged Daoist panted, his face still etched with fear.  He stumbled upon landing, then looked back at the cave entrance. Seeing no movement, he breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p>Then, as if remembering something, his expression brightened. He opened his right hand, revealing a ball of ice the size of an infant's fist. The ice sphere was crystal clear, made of a peculiar type of cold jade, radiating a chilling aura even without activation.</p><p>The middle-aged Daoist retracted the True Qi enveloping the ice sphere. A series of “crackling” sounds followed, and a thin layer of ice instantly coated his hand, the cold air intense. The ice sphere's chill then seeped into the Daoist's body, threatening to freeze his blood.</p><p>Unfazed, the middle-aged Daoist's smile widened.  "Though this cave differs from the clues Master found before his passing—it's not the alchemic master's cave—obtaining such a large piece of Ling Jade is still a worthwhile trip. Refining the Ling Jade's cold energy will greatly increase my chances of breaking through this bottleneck…"</p><p>He carefully cast several seals onto the ice sphere, sealing the cold energy, and stored the treasure in his pouch.  He glanced at the cave entrance one last time before leaving.</p><p>Moments later, the middle-aged Daoist appeared on a mountain peak, surveying his surroundings with indecision.</p><p>"To think, obtaining the treasure was so smooth; I didn't even need the preparations I made. There's still time before the Immortal Array closes. I could still explore two more secret realms.  It's a shame I didn't learn more about the Seven Killing Hall beforehand.  Exploring unknown secret realms rashly is extremely dangerous…"</p><p>Hesitant, the middle-aged Daoist suddenly grew alert, nearly jumping out of his skin.</p><p>"My entry into the Seven Killing Hall was to find a breakthrough. Now that I have the Ling Jade, I have hope. Why risk it for unknown treasures? To lose my life for such greed would be utterly regrettable!"</p><p>Having reached this realization, the middle-aged Daoist suppressed his greed and resolutely turned away.</p><p>Soon, he reached the edge of the mountain range.</p><p>A desolate plain. Withered vegetation.</p><p>'Whoosh…whoosh…'</p><p>The wind blew, causing the withered grass to undulate in waves spreading towards the distance. The vast plain was visible in its entirety.</p><p>The middle-aged cultivator muttered an incantation, concealing his aura, hiding in a mountain gully.  He remained motionless, his gaze fixed on the plain for a long time.</p><p>Above the plain, a vortex-shaped passage within the storm was clearly visible.  There was still time before the Immortal Array closed; the passage hadn't begun to shrink yet.  A massive vortex covered the center of the plain, allowing passage out of the Seven Killing Hall from anywhere below.</p><p>Once inside the vortex, safety greatly increased. One only needed to activate a jade talisman to withstand the Immortal Array's force. Due to the chaotic power within the storm, cultivators could appear anywhere upon exiting the array.</p><p>Ambushing them would be extremely difficult. The Immortal Array's range was vast, forming a massive circular wind wall. Ambushers could only guard one spot and rely on luck.  If fate was unkind, and a Nascent Soul Grandmaster emerged, the ambushers might lose their lives.</p><p>After observing for a while, the middle-aged Daoist, certain of the lack of danger, secretly infiltrated the plain, found a secluded corner, and his escape light flashed as he sped towards the vortex.</p><p>In an instant, he neared the vortex.  He felt the terrifying impact of the Immortal Array and immediately activated his jade talisman, a relieved smile on his face.  At that moment, a blue light suddenly appeared beside him without warning.</p><p>'Rumble… rumble…'</p><p>The storm vortex remained, but the middle-aged Daoist's figure disappeared, seemingly having entered the storm.</p><p>In the mountains…</p><p>Within a dense forest, two pairs of eyes remained fixed on the storm vortex. Witnessing this scene, their eyes flashed before quickly retracting.</p><p>"Daoist Qin, did you see anything?"</p><p>A voice asked.</p><p>Hidden within the forest were Qin Sang and Bai.</p><p>After leaving the Celestial Tower, Qin Sang, after some thought, headed straight for the plain and had been hiding in the forest for quite some time.</p><p>He remembered Elder Zou's invitation to meet at Flower Fairy Lake to search for treasures together before his departure.</p><p>But some matters took precedence.  It seemed he wouldn't be able to keep that appointment.</p><p>Unexpectedly meeting senior Qingzhu and learning about clues to the ancient teleportation array offers hope of returning to Xiaohan Region. My current cultivation bottleneck is temporarily solved; retrieving the Nine Illusory Sky Orchid and refining the Du'e Pill for Nascent Soul formation are now top priorities.</p><p>Compared to this, everything else is insignificant.</p><p>The premise of all this is that I can safely leave the Seven Killing Hall.  I haven't forgotten that there's likely another difficult challenge waiting at the Hall's entrance.</p><p>If I can't overcome it, everything else is moot.</p><p>So I headed straight for the area near the wasteland to investigate, waiting for that cultivator to act as a test subject.</p><p>“There's definitely something unusual; that guy's gone completely mad!”</p><p>Qin Sang's face darkened.  The faint blue light the Sky-Eye Butterfly saw shouldn't be appearing in the storm; that cultivator is likely dead.</p><p>Bai and I had only speculated before, thinking it unlikely that a Nascent Soul cultivator would risk defying everyone and ambush me in the wasteland.</p><p>Now we know just how reckless a Nascent Soul Grandmaster can be when they go mad.</p><p>In this world where immense power is concentrated in the self, for those top-tier cultivators, so-called rules don't impose absolute constraints, only a balancing effect.  If the benefits of breaking the rules are significant enough, they won't hesitate for a moment.</p><p>Bai wasn't surprised. He sighed, “It seems we can only do as you suggested, and hope for a fight inside the Sky Tower. Or later, when more people exit at once, we'll have a chance to escape.  After all, with more people around, he can't possibly kill everyone, and will likely act more cautiously.”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded. “If that person was only at the early Nascent Soul stage, I'd have some confidence in shaking him off within the Immortal array, but for now, that's all we can do.”</p><p>The Sky-Eye Butterfly rested on Qin Sang's shoulder, drowsy.</p><p>After entering the Seven Killing Hall, Qin Sang twice used the Witch Tribe's secret arts to forcefully enhance the Sky-Eye's abilities, leaving the butterfly extremely tired.</p><p>“Go rest.”</p><p>Qin Sang gently stroked the Sky-Eye Butterfly's wings, feeding it a drop of spirit dew.</p><p>The Sky-Eye Butterfly rubbed affectionately against Qin Sang's fingertip before flying into his dantian.</p><p>Bai’s gaze followed the Sky-Eye Butterfly, feeling a touch of envy. While not a strong fighter, the butterfly is an excellent assistant, repeatedly achieving great feats.</p><p>Unfortunately, cultivating such rare insects is incredibly difficult.  At least, before he recovers his memories, he doesn't have the energy to do it.</p><p>“Friend Qin, are the restrictions in the valley as dangerous as you said? Those Nascent Soul cultivators probably won't break through for a while. What do you plan to do afterwards?  Just wait here endlessly?”</p>
