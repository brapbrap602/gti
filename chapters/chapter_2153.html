<h1>Chapter 2143: The Chihua Tree</h1><p>Relatives may grieve, but others will already be singing.</p><p>The Storm Realm, after experiencing cataclysmic change and a near-millennium conflict with the Changyou tribe, and recently, the Siyou invasion, finally enjoys a period of peace.  All factions can finally live in peace.</p><p>The death of Fang Laomo only caused brief ripples in the Storm Realm before calm was restored.</p><p>Shortly afterward, the Green Sheep Temple issued invitations to various tribes and sects for a celebratory gathering.</p><p>As is fitting, the previous gathering was for punishment; this one is a commendation ceremony.</p><p>That evening, the ceremony concluded in an atmosphere of harmony.</p><p>Those who assisted Qin Sang in deploying thunder talismans from their branch temples during the recent war all received recognition for their contributions. However, the greatest credit went to those who fought directly against the Siyou army on the front lines—mainly the demon soldiers, but also many cultivators like Huan Hen from various sects.</p><p>Their past contributions in the battles against the Changyou tribe will also be considered.</p><p>The most significant rewards are threefold: first, the opportunity to serve as an official in the Five Thunder Academy; second, those unwilling to cultivate thunder techniques can exchange their merits for assistance from Qin Sang or other experts in refining their cultivation methods; and third, the highly anticipated Qingling Qi!</p><p>Since Qin Sang took the Qingling Qi from the fissure in the Daiyu Immortal Mountain, no new Qingling Qi has been generated.  Now that Daiyu Immortal Mountain is riddled with holes, Qin Sang is hesitant to act rashly.  These remaining stores can be considered the last of it.</p><p>Qin Sang divided the Qingling Qi, allocating a portion to the Green Sheep Temple and storing the rest in the Five Thunder Academy.  Strict regulations govern its use, modeled after the Heavenly Court's merit system.</p><p>Regardless of sect or school, anyone accumulating sufficient merit can exchange it for a wisp of Qingling Qi at the Five Thunder Academy.</p><p>Qingling Qi is at the very top of the merit list. Unless another major war breaks out, obtaining Qingling Qi through merit exchange will be extremely difficult. In a way, excessive external peace is a drawback, and the Heavenly Court's continued expansion may be linked to this.</p><p>Currently, the primary goal is to offer tangible hope, encouraging everyone to wholeheartedly accept the merit system and support the Green Sheep Temple and the Five Thunder Academy.</p><p>Of course, there are shortcuts to acquiring Qingling Qi quickly.  One can exchange treasures and techniques obtained from the Immortal Palace, including fragments of treasures and incomplete techniques.  Qin Sang naturally hopes for more relics like the Qianjun Ring and the Ziwei Emperor Sword, even if they are only comparable to the three fragments he obtained from the Wu Xiang Immortal Sect.</p><p>Because the overall cultivation level of the Storm Realm is still low, the contributions cultivators can make are limited, thus creating little value for Qin Sang. Therefore, the current merit system is still in its infancy. It will gradually improve as time passes and the Storm Realm's strength increases.</p><p>The rewards on the merit list will also be added to over time.  It's not impossible that in the future, more precious treasures than Qingling Qi will be added, leading to a virtuous cycle.</p><p>Li Yufu, on behalf of Qin Sang, explained the merit system and the bright future of the Storm Realm at the ceremony, requesting the support of various factions in the construction of altars and the establishment of the Five Thunder Academy.</p><p>Subsequently, all factions expressed their full support, recognizing the merit system as a fair and benevolent policy, a solid foundation for the revitalization of the Storm Realm, and pledged their full cooperation. They dispatched their elite disciples to assist in the establishment of the Five Thunder Academy, firmly upholding the will of the governor.</p><p>Furthermore, tribes and sects preparing to relocate to the outer seas also attended the ceremony. They unanimously expressed their loyalty to the Five Thunder Academy, even from afar, pledging their allegiance to Governor Qin regardless of time or place.</p><p>…</p><p>Green Sheep Temple Restricted Area.</p><p>In a mountain valley, Qin Sang meditated before a Daiyu Immortal Mountain stele.</p><p>The Vermilion Bird circled the Immortal Mountain, its eyes filled with curiosity, repeatedly attempting to enter the mountain fissure, only to be stopped by Qin Sang, much to its displeasure.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at it and teased, "Weren't you eager to join the fun last time, claiming you'd support me? Why are you hiding now, afraid to show your face?"</p><p>The Vermilion Bird landed on the stele, shrinking its head. "That nun is definitely not someone to be trifled with. You'd better stay away. Just give your wife to her to avoid trouble.  It's better to live to fight another day than die, dragging me down with you."</p><p>The Vermilion Bird was always fearless; it's rare to see it so afraid of someone.</p><p>Qin Sang looked at it intently.  "At its peak, how did it compare to her?"</p><p>"A hundred times stronger, for sure!"</p><p>Zhu Que raised its head high, its eyes full of disdain. "This Zhu Que could kill her with a single wingbeat!"</p><p>After learning about the Great Ascension Tribulation from Ning Zhenren, Qin Sang began to reassess the "ancient beings" he'd encountered in the Storm Realm.</p><p>For example, Zhu Que and Gui Mu.  Being trapped in the Storm Realm for more than three thousand years—if a sixtieth-nine Heavenly Tribulation had descended, they would have long since vanished. Zhu Que has been by his side for so long, without experiencing a single tribulation. Were they all Great Ascension cultivators before?</p><p>That such powerful Great Ascension cultivators had fallen to this state… was this the so-called Tribulation of Formlessness?</p><p>Zhu Que's previous boastful words might eventually come true. One day, he might truly need to rely on it.</p><p>"It's a pity the Qilin egg still shows no sign of hatching," Qin Sang murmured.</p><p>Just then, Qin Sang sensed his cave's protective barrier being activated.  A sweep of his spiritual sense revealed the visitor's identity, and he forcefully brought Zhu Que out of the restricted area.</p><p>"Ming Qiu greets Lord Qin!"</p><p>The visitor was Ming Qiu. After the announcement of the Merit System, everyone called Qin Sang "Lord Qin."</p><p>"I summoned you, I have a task."</p><p>Qin Sang instructed the Zhu Que on his shoulder, "Go fetch Daoist Ji Hong."</p><p>Zhu Que reluctantly left.</p><p>Qin Sang brought Ming Qiu into the cave and produced an ice box and a wooden box. The ice box contained the sacrificial insects collected from Feng Ju Jade Gate, and the wooden box held the seeds of the flower trees where the insects lived.</p><p>Years ago, when Qin Sang obtained the Lesser Heaven, he had collected those trees before leaving.</p><p>Surprisingly, these trees began to wither immediately upon entering the Lesser Heaven. Qin Sang was powerless to save them, and he didn't have the energy to tend to them; eventually, they all died.</p><p>As the Chi Hua trees withered, the sacrificial insects began to die in large numbers.</p><p>Later, after obtaining the secret method of cultivating sacrificial insects from the Hao Bo clan, Qin Sang learned that this flower tree, called Chi Hua, was extremely delicate. Even though he moved the trees along with the soil, even a slight change in environment would cause them to wither.</p><p>The Hao Bo clan had to exercise great care in cultivating these trees, expending a great deal of effort. However, once a large number of Chi Hua trees were cultivated, the rewards were significant. They could serve as the habitat for the sacrificial insects, calming them, making them more easily bond with their owner, and having other miraculous uses.</p><p>The most precious of these uses was the ability to accelerate the production of gall crystals from the insects.</p><p>Fortunately, some Chi Hua trees had left behind seeds, and Qin Sang had also sealed the surviving sacrificial insects.</p><p>After thoroughly studying the complete secret arts of the Hao Bo clan, Qin Sang found himself stuck at the first step.  Unfortunately, he only possessed this single Wu clan secret technique. Without Chi Hua trees, he could not cultivate the insects.</p><p>Cultivating Chi Hua trees required two conditions.</p><p>First, those who inherited the Hao Bo clan's legacy must constantly use secret techniques on the trees. Qin Sang had already passed on the Hao Bo clan's inheritance to Old Master Fang. With the combined efforts of Wu clan experts, they had made significant progress, and some Wu clan cultivators had begun to attempt cultivation.  This task could be left to them.</p><p>Second, special spiritual herbs were needed for watering, most of which were unique to the Wu clan.  After searching far and wide, Qin Sang found it impossible to gather them all. He specifically invited Ji Hong back from the Si You clan to inquire about alternative methods.</p><p>Qin Sang gestured for Ming Qiu to open the ice box, which contained numerous young sacrificial insects.</p><p>He had collected some special sacrificial insects, which could be considered insect kings, that would save a lot of time in the future. However, the insect kings needed a large population to support them; otherwise, they would gradually degenerate. The current task was to cultivate the insect population first.</p><p>Just then, Zhu Que returned with Ji Hong.</p><p>Ji Hong and Qin Sang were already acquainted.  He leaped onto the stone table and asked, "Before I left, Daoist Si Lu asked me to relay a message. Recently, the Si Huang has repeatedly sent people to inquire about the whereabouts of the mirage shell, fearing that the Lu family's mirage shell might fall into the wrong hands. How should I respond?"</p><p>"No hurry, let's keep them waiting."</p><p>Qin Sang held the mirage shell, so he was naturally fearless.  When the Si Huang became impatient and sent a court tutor to the Storm Sea, the timing would be just right.</p><p>Ji Hong's nostrils twitched, as if he smelled something. He stared intently at the wooden box.  "What's inside?"</p><p>"Some seeds," Qin Sang smiled. "Why don't you take a look, Daoist friend?"</p><p>Ji Hong couldn't wait any longer.  He hopped to the wooden box, which clicked open, revealing several olive-shaped seeds. He carefully picked one up, his eyes glued to it.</p><p>"These are the seeds of the Chi Hua tree. Are you interested, Daoist friend?" Qin Sang asked.</p><p>Ji Hong repeatedly nodded, then shook his head, repeatedly saying, "It's not easy! It's not easy!"</p><p>Seeing Ji Hong instantly recognize the delicate nature of the Chi Hua tree, Qin Sang secretly thought he'd found the right person.  He took out a jade slip.  "This records an effective cultivation method. Unfortunately, much of the knowledge about spiritual herbs has been lost.  Fellow Daoist might find it helpful."</p><p>Ji Hong immediately hugged the jade slip and began to examine it carefully.</p><p>Qin Sang noticed that Ji Hong's true nature was more apparent when he was focused, sometimes shaking his head and muttering to himself, sometimes scratching his head in deep thought, sometimes lying on the desk with his head resting on the jade slip, almost as if he were asleep.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist, have you had any breakthroughs?" Qin Sang asked.</p><p>Ji Hong sat up, tapping his forehead forcefully.  "I have inspiration, but it's too chaotic. I need quiet!"</p><p>Without bidding Qin Sang farewell, he grabbed the wooden box and jade slip and rushed out of the cave abode.</p><p>Ming Qiu watched Ji Hong, secretly amazed.  Suddenly noticing Qin Sang looking at him, he respectfully said, "On behalf of the entire Wu tribe, I'd like to accept this task and alleviate the burden on Lord Qin!"</p><p>Qin Sang nodded.  "Cultivating the sacrificial insects is crucial to the future of the Storm Realm. I will set aside a plot of land near each altar, and establish a department under the Five Thunder Academy, specifically for the cultivation of Chi Hua trees and sacrificial insects. We will call it the Mount Yu Garden.  Except for the chief registrar, the officials of this department will be selected from your Wu tribe."</p><p>Ming Qiu was overjoyed. His greatest fear was that the Five Thunder Academy wouldn't have a place for the Wu tribe. With the Five Thunder Academy establishing a department specifically for the Wu tribe, as long as they diligently cultivated the sacrificial insects, they wouldn't have to worry about their position in Qin Zhen's heart.</p><p>"You can take the secret techniques and these sacrificial insects back and begin studying them. You can consult with Fellow Daoist Ji Hong at any time regarding the cultivation of the Chi Hua tree," Qin Sang said.</p><p>"Yes, sir!"</p><p>Ming Qiu bowed and left.</p><p>Qin Sang returned to the restricted area, ignoring Zhuque's protests and leaving it outside.</p><p>Gazing at Mount Daiyu, Qin Sang fell into deep thought.</p><p>After exchanging ideas with Master He Ning, Qin Sang had a deeper understanding of Mount Daiyu.</p><p>Master He Ning suggested that he could temporarily refine Mount Daiyu using a method similar to refining magical treasures. The goal was to reduce the mountain's size, masking its fluctuations, making it easier to bring into the Sacred Land. However, he warned that this might accelerate the mountain's collapse.</p><p>Qin Sang possessed a smaller, inner realm, making this step unnecessary.</p><p>During this period, he focused on his understanding, reaching a conclusion: Mount Daiyu was too fragile.  Whatever he intended to do with it, it would be safest to wait until he had absorbed the mountain's essence and repaired its structure.</p><p>With that thought, Qin Sang abandoned the idea of exploring Mount Daiyu's secrets, and his mind once again delved into the stele.</p><p>This time, with ample time, Qin Sang carefully selected the ancient prohibitions within the mountain. As he gained control of each one, the mountain began to change.</p><p>The clouds and mist suddenly dissipated, completely exposing the mountain's body.</p><p>Then, a faint mist began to rise from the foot of the mountain, slowly spreading towards the summit, appearing gentler than before.</p><p>After an unknown amount of time, when the mist once again shrouded Mount Daiyu, Qin Sang opened his eyes, met with a blinding white expanse. Flying outside the mountain, he could barely sense any fluctuations from Mount Daiyu; the impact on his inner realm would be negligible.</p><p>Qin Sang raised his right hand, the Qianjun Ring flashed, and Mount Daiyu disappeared, being stored within his inner realm.</p><p>The mountain landed steadily on the ground, looking out of place due to the mist.</p><p>Qin Sang waited patiently for a while, noticing no instability in his inner realm. In fact, it seemed even more stable.</p><p>Qin Sang recalled Master He Ning's words about the mountain's power enhancing the Dharma Realm.  He reasoned that if Nascent Soul cultivators control Dharma Realms and Mahayana cultivators can open up a world, could Dharma Realms be the initial stage of creating a world, a prototype of a world?</p><p>If so, his intuition might have been correct.</p><p>Returning to his cave abode, Qin Sang found some message talismans trapped by the protective barrier, having spent quite some time retrieving the mountain. Most of the messages were reports from Li Yu Fu, regarding the construction of the transmission altars.</p><p>These tasks could be handled by his subordinates. The only thing requiring his personal attention was the final ritual of establishing the altars.</p><p>As the envoy of the Five Thunder Academy, his establishing transmission altars here would count as a region under his jurisdiction, though at best it could only be considered a temporary one.</p><p>In ancient times, these temporary regions had a slight chance of connecting to the Divine Court, but it was practically impossible now. The aspiration of consolidating the merit seal was also a distant dream.</p><p>After a cursory glance, Qin Sang set the message talismans aside and began to contemplate his own situation.</p><p>Having achieved enlightenment during the great war, he should focus on improving his cultivation.</p><p>Master He Ning only mentioned that the Sacred Land would open within a thousand years, without specifying an exact time. It could be far in the future, or it could be soon.</p><p>The Sacred Land was teeming with experts, and conflict was inevitable.  It would be best to increase his strength and prepare for his journey to the Sacred Land. The optimal choice would be to refine the Kuntian Golden Lock and perfect the Four Symbols Sword Formation.</p>
