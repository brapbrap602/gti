<h1>Chapter 1964: Opening the Meridians</h1><p>The storm raged.  Chaos swirled around Bai Li Qingkong.  This wasn't enough to threaten his life. But after descending some distance, Bai Li Qingkong suddenly felt a warning, raised his right hand to his chest, and revealed a palm-sized bronze disc.</p><p>The disc's surface gleamed, reflecting the scene ahead, clearly showing swirling currents.  Bai Li Qingkong's expression was grave; he saw a strange, humanoid shadow amidst the currents, moving like a phantom, instantly disappearing.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>Bai Li Qingkong pointed a finger.  Suddenly, a piercing shriek echoed in front of his fingertip, and a figure appeared, roaring at Bai Li Qingkong, its voice filled with madness and bloodlust.</p><p>Seeing the figure's appearance, Bai Li Qingkong frowned. The creature's features were distorted, its limbs long and thin; more ghastly than a ghost, a type of demon he'd never seen before. This demon was mindless, incapable of communication, attacking any living thing it encountered.</p><p>Bai Li Qingkong understood the demon's nature. He threw the bronze mirror; it circled the demon's head, leaving a crimson trail. Like a burning rope, it tightened, ensnaring the demon's neck, its red fire burning its body.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the demon wasn't immediately incinerated.  Black mist erupted from its seven orifices, contacting the red fire and turning it a dark reddish-black.</p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p>Seeing this, Bai Li Qingkong realized this demon wasn't simple, but he didn't know how many more were below. If they came in groups, it would be a significant problem.</p><p>Demons wouldn't appear without reason. Their presence here likely meant they were guarding something.  This implied they'd likely found the core of the Tianmai Sect ruins!</p><p>After a moment's thought, Bai Li Qingkong made a hand seal; the red fire surged, encircling the demon but not killing it. Leaving the demon would help him deter others.</p><p>As expected, as he continued deeper, demons began appearing in twos and threes.  Bai Li Qingkong used various techniques, avoiding direct combat, descending as quickly as possible.</p><p>At the same time…</p><p>Deep underground, lives were being mercilessly harvested.  The young man with the surname Sha removed his finger from a cultivator's forehead, indifferently watching the cultivator's blood being absorbed by the earth. He glanced into the distance and vanished underground.</p><p>As time passed, the stone pool murals absorbed more and more blood, emitting an eerie crimson glow. Murals were scattered throughout the ruins, invisibly connected, forming a giant array covering the entire site. The array's eye was the bottomless ancient well.</p><p>Bai Li Qingkong continued his descent, unsure of how deep he'd gone. Finally, he sensed a chilling coldness and unusual fluctuations below.</p><p>He paused, glanced upward, activated the bronze mirror to circle him protectively, and carefully descended. Surprisingly, he passed through the cold area without incident.</p><p>It was like passing through a barrier. As the temperature returned to normal, all the noise was blocked out. Bai Li Qingkong entered a pitch-black space, silent and unnerving.  Even stranger, the glowing orbs that had drawn them here were gone.</p><p>In the empty underground space, Bai Li Qingkong recalled the strange encounters. Despite his Yuan Ying cultivation, he felt inexplicably uneasy.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>A faint sound of wind was unusually sharp here.</p><p>“Who’s there!”</p><p>Bai Li Qingkong's expression changed; his divine sense had just swept over that area. Without hesitation, he unleashed his divine sense with overwhelming force.</p><p>The other person made no attempt to hide, emerging from the darkness.</p><p>A faint light illuminated the space, revealing a figure – the young man with the surname Sha.</p><p>“One of the three Yuan Ying ancestors of the Bai Li clan, Bai Li Qingkong. My apologies! My apologies!”</p><p>“Who are you?”</p><p>Bai Li Qingkong felt uncomfortable under the young man's gaze; it was too cold, like looking at a corpse.</p><p>This was clearly hostile!</p><p>But a mere Golden Core cultivator? How dare he be so arrogant?  Bai Li Qingkong instantly saw through the young man's cultivation.</p><p>A Yuan Ying ancestor, even injured, wasn't a threat to a Golden Core cultivator.  Yet, inexplicably, his unease grew stronger.</p><p>Bai Li Qingkong focused his senses, detecting no other presences.</p><p>"You have a remarkably short memory, friend. You don't recognize me anymore.  However, I have never forgotten the favor your百里 clan bestowed upon my family two hundred years ago!"</p><p>The young man, a Sha, spoke with icy coldness.</p><p>"Two hundred years ago?"</p><p>百里晴空 finally recalled something, staring intently at the young Sha man. The more he looked, the more familiar the other's features seemed.</p><p>His expression shifted, and he blurted out, "You're that missing Sha… illegitimate child!"</p><p>"Illegitimate…"</p><p>The young Sha man suddenly laughed, a laugh filled with hatred and bitterness.</p><p>百里晴空's words confirmed it: he was the sole survivor, the last of the Sha bloodline!</p><p>"Failure to completely eradicate the weeds inevitably leads to future troubles!"</p><p>A cold smile curled百里晴空's lips.</p><p>It was clearly a trap.</p><p>The Yin family was always cautious, rarely making enemies in the cultivation world.  百里晴空 never expected this to be a conspiracy targeting him!</p><p>"The head of the family was right. The Sha clan were nothing but a bunch of roughnecks!  You survived, yet instead of ensuring your family line continues, you dare appear before me!  Who gave you the courage, Yin Heqian?"</p><p>Unmoved, the young Sha man coldly replied, "Friend, there's no need for probing. It's only you and me here, no third party."</p><p>He tilted his head, gazing into the darkness above, and murmured, "A thousand years ago, the Sha clan discovered the Tianmai Sect ruins here. But generations of our elders failed to open them."</p><p>"But you did!"</p><p>百里晴空 sneered, "What are you trying to say? That you're a once-in-a-millennium genius, unlike those Sha brutes?"</p><p>"I wouldn't dare disrespect my ancestors, nor would I belittle myself.  Of course, I also have to thank you for helping me break the final seal!"</p><p>The young Sha man spread his arms, a strange light flashing in his eyes.  A peculiar energy emanated from him, spreading towards the deep darkness.</p><p>"Only later did I realize the Pulse Xuan Tower isn't a tower at all!"</p><p>This nonsensical statement caused百里晴空's face to completely change.</p><p>Suddenly, he understood. "You…"</p><p>At that moment, an eerie red glow appeared in the darkness. Countless blood threads surged from all directions, converging on the young Sha man's body.</p><p>These threads, like human veins, pierced into his body, connecting with his own meridians.  A power百里晴空 had never seen before flowed into him through these threads.</p><p>"The Tianmai Sect's ultimate technique, the 'Tianmai Heart Scripture,' aims to cultivate a celestial vein within one's body using the body's own meridians.  The Pulse Xuan Tower is a sacred site for meridian cultivation. Its passages are like meridians, the stone pools correspond to acupoints, and with the Tianmai Sect's secret Huangting Divine Liquid, one can open meridians.  Unfortunately, I don't know how to refine the Huangting Divine Liquid, so I had to find another way, using the refined blood of cultivators to forcefully activate the Pulse Xuan Tower's formation. However, I still lacked a crucial component for the final acupoint!"</p><p>Enveloped in the blood threads, the young Sha man became almost a cocoon. His cold voice echoed from within.</p><p>Clearly, the threads were from the deceased cultivators.</p><p>The young Sha man had orchestrated a vast scheme, and his ultimate target, and biggest variable, was百里晴空!</p><p>"Using me as a component?"</p><p>百里晴空 roared with laughter, as if he'd heard the funniest joke in the world.</p><p>"You're courting death!"</p><p>Firelight illuminated the entire space.</p><p>Hundreds of fist-sized fire-thunderbolts appeared before百里晴空, raining down on the young Sha man.</p><p>'Bang! Bang! Bang!'</p><p>The fire-thunderbolts exploded repeatedly, yet failed to sever the blood threads.</p><p>Seeing this,百里晴空 immediately directed all the fire-thunderbolts at the young Sha man.  A Golden Core cultivator would be reduced to dust by such an attack.</p><p>The young Sha man remained unmoving, pushing his palms forward. The sound of wind and thunder echoed from within him.</p><p>His palms overlapped, emitting a crimson light ring which enveloped all the exploding fire-thunderbolts.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The fire-thunderbolts detonated simultaneously.</p><p>The earth shook!</p><p>The light ring shattered, but it had withstood the terrifying impact.</p><p>The young Sha man alone couldn't possess such immense power. He must have obtained it from the Pulse Xuan Tower, achieving strength comparable to a Nascent Soul cultivator.</p><p>"Cough…"</p><p>The young Sha man, who had just displayed incredible power, suddenly let out a heart-wrenching cough, his upper body almost collapsing, revealing an expression of immense pain.</p><p>Bai Li Qingkong’s surprise quickly turned to delight. He laughed heartily, "Arrogant boy! You dare to manipulate the power of a Yuan Ying cultivator? Let's see when you explode!"</p><p>Before he finished speaking, the bronze mirror behind him soared into the air, hanging upside down, flames flickering on its surface.</p><p>The young man surnamed Sha wiped the blood from his lips and stared coldly at the mirror.</p><p>*Crack!*</p><p>He opened a jade bottle, and a pill rolled out—one he had obtained years ago from Qing Yang Temple.</p><p>As the elixir entered his body, a wave of coolness spread through him, greatly reducing his pain.  He could finally control the chaotic power within him.</p><p>Overjoyed, the young man surnamed Sha realized the pill was an exceptional one, its potency exceeding his expectations!</p><p>Feeling immense power surge through him, his confidence soared.  Seeing the bronze mirror hurtling towards him, he counterattacked without hesitation.</p><p>A wounded Yuan Ying cultivator.</p><p>A Golden Core cultivator wielding Yuan Ying power through external means.</p><p>A life-or-death battle unfolded deep within the ancient well.</p><p>Yin He Qian was desperate to save someone; others had to carefully deal with the demonic attacks.</p><p>Undisturbed, they fought.</p><p>The shockwaves of their battle raged, creating chaos.</p><p>The young man surnamed Sha fought with increasing ferocity, while Bai Li Qingkong felt his strength waning.</p><p>To his horror, he discovered that the Mai Xuan Pagoda not only amplified the young man's power but also suppressed his own.</p><p>The tide turned; he was on the defensive.</p><p>When he tried to retreat, he found escape impossible. He had been subtly trapped by the young man the moment he entered the space.</p><p>*Puff!*</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>A figure flew backwards—Bai Li Qingkong.</p><p>"Unfortunately, I don't understand the true method of activating the Mai Xuan Pagoda. I could only delay its self-destruction, and I couldn't control the demonic guardian. Otherwise, why go through all this trouble!"</p><p>The young man surnamed Sha looked incredibly battered, his body scorched and bruised.</p><p>But he was the victor!</p><p>His voice betrayed his excitement. He had used every trick in the book to weaken his opponent, taking full advantage of the situation.  </p><p>Whether through cunning or underhanded tactics, he had undeniably defeated a true Yuan Ying cultivator, taking the first step towards revenge!</p><p>"Remember! The Sha family, specifically Sha Jia Yu, destroyed your entire Bai Li clan!"</p><p>The young man surnamed Sha roared, his voice filled with triumphant glee.</p><p>"Centuries of cultivation, surpassed by a single generation's genius!"</p><p>Bai Li Qingkong, stripped of his arrogance, let out a bitter laugh.</p><p>The *Tian Mai Heart Scripture* is incredibly powerful.  It's said even Tian Mai Sect cultivators use Huang Ting Divine Liquid to lessen the technique's impact on their bodies, otherwise, it damages their foundation, ultimately proving more harmful than beneficial in the long run.</p><p>Sha Jia Yu, consumed by revenge, disregarded his future, cultivating the *Tian Mai Heart Scripture* using demonic methods. Once mastered, his power would surpass that of a true Tian Mai Sect cultivator. He couldn't be treated as an ordinary Yuan Ying cultivator.</p><p>Of course, the price would be devastating, likely affecting his lifespan.</p><p>Driven mad by hatred, this man possessed incredible cunning, using guile to drive a powerful enemy into a desperate situation!</p><p>Any force would be terrified by such a ruthless enemy.</p><p>Bai Li Qingkong foresaw a grim future for the Bai Li clan.</p><p>The legacy accumulated through the painstaking efforts of generations of ancestors could be destroyed by this man!</p><p>But he couldn't send a warning back to his clan!</p><p>"Rumble…"</p><p>The earth crumbled, mountains split.</p><p>Cultivators on the surface, including Yin He Qian, showed signs of alarm.</p><p>Yin He Qian suppressed his injuries and looked ahead.</p><p>"The Tian Mai Sect ruins are about to be destroyed.  What in the world did Bai Li Qingkong do?"</p><p>…</p><p>At the heart of the ruins.</p><p>In Yin He Qian's view, Bai Li Qingkong had become an ingredient, absorbed by the Mai Xuan Pagoda.</p><p>The Mai Xuan Pagoda was on the verge of collapse, but Sha Jia Yu remained unmoved, seizing the last moment before its destruction to open his own meridians!</p><p>Immense power flooded his body. Sha Jia Yu felt his meridians being shredded, then squeezed into a ball, then dispersed, repeatedly, bringing him excruciating pain.</p><p>Finally, he felt something in the darkness, and he struck his dantian, releasing a torrent of true energy.</p><p>It felt like breaking through a barrier; a previously nonexistent path appeared within him, a new meridian born from his flesh and blood.</p><p>This was the Tian Mai!</p><p>…</p><p>Three years later.</p><p>In a remote mountain range, lightning flashed, and a ferocious wind howled.</p><p>After the three Heavenly Tribulations, the surroundings were devastated beyond recognition.</p><p>A figure slowly rose from the ruins, laughing at the heavens, "Heaven has been kind to me, Sha Jia Yu, allowing me to overcome the Heart Demon Tribulation! Once I've slaughtered all my enemies, I shall offer thanks to Heaven!"</p><p>His ambition and killing intent filled the air.</p><p>Suppressing his killing intent, Sha Jia Yu considered his next move in his revenge.</p><p>The Bai Li clan had lost Bai Li Qingkong, but two more Yuan Ying ancestors remained. A direct confrontation was impossible...</p><p>At that moment, a beam of light shot towards him.</p><p>He caught it, stared at it for a moment, then left hastily.</p><p>Soon, he reached a mountain range—Guan Yang Mountain, the home of the Bai Li clan.</p><p>Dark clouds gathered over Guan Yang Mountain, figures swarming, launching a fierce assault!</p><p>(End)</p>
