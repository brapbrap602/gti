<h1>Chapter 2142: Funeral Rites</h1><p>Liaochen activated the grand formation, sending Qin Sang out of Purple Cloud Mountain and back to the sea region from before.</p><p>Qin Sang flew directly into the Sea of Mist, returning to the Zhuyan tribe via the Shifting Formation.  Patriarch Yuanxiang happened to be in his cave dwelling.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Qin, did you meet that Fellow Daoist Ning?" Patriarch Yuanxiang no longer concealed his intentions.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded. "Thanks to Fellow Daoist Ning's guidance, many of my doubts have been cleared. However, there's still one thing I don't understand. What is the connection between Fellow Daoist Ning, Purple Cloud Mountain, and the Zhuyan tribe? Why is Patriarch Yuanxiang willing to offer two places in the Sacred Land?"</p><p>Patriarch Yuanxiang let out a soft exclamation. "Fellow Daoist Ning told you about this as well? Are they intending to send Fellow Daoist Qin into the Sacred Land this time?"</p><p>"That is their intention. However, I don't wish to be indebted to Purple Cloud Mountain. I plan to find a way to obtain a place from the Siyou tribe," Qin Sang replied.</p><p>"I'm not entirely clear about the specific connection. I only know that it has been customary for a very long time. When I was young, one of the ancestors closest to me had already cultivated in the Sacred Land for many years. Even he addressed Fellow Daoist Ning as a junior," Patriarch Yuanxiang said meaningfully.</p><p>Qin Sang's heart sank.</p><p>Unless the other party's aura was completely unconcealed, it was difficult for a Void Refinement cultivator to probe the cultivation of Body Integration and Grand Ascension cultivators.  In his perception, Fellow Daoist Ning was simply unfathomable.</p><p>Could Fellow Daoist Ning be a Grand Ascension cultivator?</p><p>When Fellow Daoist Ning mentioned Liuli, he seemed genuinely concerned, as if he were entirely considering her well-being. But how could Qin Sang completely believe his words?</p><p>Helpless and lacking the power to resist, he could only endure.</p><p>No matter what he wanted to do, he had to consider the consequences of defying the other party's will. If the other party was a Body Integration cultivator, there was still hope of breaking free from their control in the future.</p><p>Patriarch Yuanxiang changed the subject. "Fellow Daoist achieved a great victory this time. When do you plan to hold a celebration? I'd like to prepare some congratulatory gifts and sample some of the fine wine you've collected.  Several other tribal patriarchs, having heard of your remarkable achievements, admire you greatly and wish to pay a visit. Some of these tribes are quite amiable and harbor no xenophobic sentiments."</p><p>Qin Sang smiled. "If Patriarch Yuanxiang doesn't mind my humble wine, I'll have someone send some over.  As for a grand celebration, there's no need, lest it become a laughingstock. If other fellow Daoists wish to visit, I'll welcome them wholeheartedly. My intention is simply to have a place to reside, a corner of peace, and I'll be content.  However, complete isolation isn't a long-term solution; it will only deepen the divide.  Yet I don't know who to associate with, so I can only trouble Patriarch Yuanxiang to act as an intermediary."</p><p>Patriarch Yuanxiang readily agreed. "Certainly! Certainly! With the external threat eliminated, you have countless matters to attend to. I won't impose any further, and we shall meet again another day."</p><p>"Farewell!"</p><p>Qin Sang left the cave dwelling, his smile fading. After a moment of contemplation, he returned directly to the Storm Realm.</p><p>…</p><p>Azure Goat Temple.</p><p>Li Yufu, learning of Qin Sang's return, came to report, presenting a jade slip. "Martial Uncle, the exploration of the Storm Sea is nearly complete."</p><p>The Storm Realm had already merged with the Great Thousand World, making it inappropriate to continue calling it the Storm Realm.  Qin Sang thus designated the three major regions of the Storm Realm, as well as the sea territory ceded by the Changyou tribe, collectively as the Storm Sea.</p><p>Qin Sang's divine sense touched the jade slip, and a cartographic projection appeared in the void, its faint azure light illuminating the cave dwelling.</p><p>The markings on the sea chart were extremely detailed, revealing the entirety of the Storm Sea.</p><p>The sea region where the Storm Realm and the Changyou tribe coexisted was roughly square-shaped. The east was bordered by the River of Calamity, and the remaining three sides were enveloped by the Sea of Mist. Originally, only the Changyou tribe resided here, living a peaceful and carefree existence.</p><p>Now, most of the sea territory belonged to the Storm Realm, and the Changyou tribe could only huddle in the southwest corner.</p><p>Three island chains separated the Storm Realm and Saint沐 Plain. The Changyou tribe had originally constructed three fortified lines of defense here, all of which were now relinquished.  Furthermore, vast stretches of open sea lay to the north and south of the Storm Realm. Although lacking large continents, these areas contained numerous islands and reefs, inhabited by many monstrous beasts and spirits. The Changyou tribe members from these areas had also withdrawn to Saint沐 Plain.</p><p>The current Storm Sea, to the cultivators of the Storm Realm, was practically boundless.</p><p>Li Yufu had dispatched people throughout the Storm Realm to survey the terrain, marking everything on the cartographic projection.</p><p>"Disciple plans to establish several branch temples in these locations…"</p><p>Li Yufu pointed to several spots.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded slightly.  The locations Li Yufu chose were all areas abundant in spiritual energy and strategically positioned. Occupying these locations would allow the Azure Goat Temple to be aware of any disturbances within the Storm Sea. Clearly, this was a well-considered plan.</p><p>"And here," Li Yufu pointed to the southwest, to the outermost of the three island chains. "This island chain is adjacent to Saint沐 Plain, with little distance between them.  Pressing too close could inevitably lead to friction. In my opinion, the Storm Sea is vast enough to accommodate the cultivators of all three tribes.  Forbidding others from establishing sects here could prevent major conflicts.  We need only station a few cultivators here permanently to guard against any restlessness from the Changyou tribe."</p><p>This proposal also followed Qin Sang's previous instructions.</p><p>Patriarch Yuanxiang's meaning was clear: the conflict between the Storm Realm and the Changyou tribe was to end here, unless another Empty Realm Second Stage expert emerged from the Changyou tribe and initiated further hostilities.</p><p>"Is anyone willing to relocate their sect or establish a new one elsewhere?" Qin Sang inquired.</p><p>With both internal and external threats quelled, the Storm Realm had become Qin Sang's domain.  However, the most crucial step remained – establishing a Dharma Transmission Platform!</p><p>The spiritual materials had long been prepared, and the next step was to begin constructing the Dharma Transmission Platform.</p><p>Furthermore, Qin Sang intended to rebuild the Five Thunders Court, centered around the Dharma Transmission Platform!</p><p>One of Li Yufu's purposes in this exploration was to find a suitable location for the Dharma Transmission Platform.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't plan to encompass the entire Storm Sea for now. The cultivators of the Storm Realm were mostly concentrated in the three major regions, and this area would serve as the core of his domain.  Expansion outwards would be considered after the domain was established.</p><p>However, once the domain was established, the Storm Realm would become Qin Sang's personal domain.  Other sects and cultivators would be under his influence, subject to the oversight and constraints of the Five Thunders Court.</p><p>Cultivators pursued freedom and unrestrained living. Some would inevitably resist being restricted. Many had just contributed to the recent war, and Qin Sang couldn't simply discard them after their usefulness was exhausted, eliminating all dissent.  Even the Dao Court at its peak couldn't achieve such absolute control, and its downfall was likely partly due to this.</p><p>Qin Sang offered them a way out. Those unwilling to be constrained could relocate outside the three major regions. Naturally, this freedom was relative, and they would have to relinquish certain things.</p><p>For instance, Qin Sang's Dharma Transmission Platform and Five Thunders Court would offer the High Godly Xiaoxiao Scripture to anyone willing to cultivate thunder arts, regardless of their background.  He would also select individuals to serve as celestial officials in the Five Thunders Court, akin to constructing a miniature Dao Court. Those cultivators and sects that relocated would naturally be ineligible.</p><p>Even so, some would prefer to forgo these benefits, prioritizing their freedom.</p><p>"Disciple has instructed messengers to contact various sects and cultivators, inquiring about their intentions. The larger sects are mostly hedging their bets, sending a portion of their disciples out. Those wishing to relocate their entire sect to the outer sea are predominantly demon sects. The demon races are the most eager, especially the several major aquatic clans from the East Sea. They've already chosen locations and are preparing for a full-scale migration…"</p><p>Li Yufu briefly summarized the current situation.</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't surprised by this. The Dao sects were the least amicable towards demon sects and demon races.</p><p>Since their minds were made up, Qin Sang wouldn't force them to stay.</p><p>Li Yufu continued his report.  "The sect has already selected a number of disciples with outstanding talent. Once the platform is completed, they will receive the Dharma teachings and switch to cultivating thunder arts. However, these are all junior disciples. Martial Brother Shen Chen cultivates the Profound Mystery Temple inheritance passed down by Martial Uncle, Martial Brother Huan Hen is devoted solely to the way of the sword, and Fellow Daoist Yunü is a demon cultivator. None of them are suited to cultivating Daoist thunder arts."</p><p>Back during the Xiaoxiao Conclave, when the Dao Court was first established, it integrated numerous Daoist inheritances and had to accommodate various factions.  Therefore, no single sect could dominate.</p><p>The Storm Realm was different. This was Qin Sang's personal domain, and the Five Thunders Court was established by him.  Naturally, he wouldn't entrust its control to others.  Key positions had to be held by Azure Goat Temple disciples and their allies.</p><p>"What about yourself? Have you considered it?" Qin Sang asked, looking at Li Yufu.</p><p>Back then, although Qin Sang possessed superior cultivation techniques, none were suitable for Li Yufu. Li Yufu still cultivated the inheritance left by Yun Youzi and was facing a predicament with no path forward. After reaching Nascent Soul, it was Liuli who helped him deduce the subsequent cultivation techniques.</p><p>Compared to the Dao Court's thunder arts, the disparity was immeasurable.</p><p>This inheritance wasn't created by Yun Youzi either; it originated from the Taiyi Pill Sect. As long as there was a successor, it wasn't necessary for Li Yufu to adhere to it indefinitely.</p><p>Li Yufu was not only Yun Youzi's successor, but Qin Sang had long considered him his own disciple.  He might not be as dazzling as Shen Chen and the others in certain aspects, but his talent was not lacking. He was mature, steady, and possessed the demeanor of a great general as the Temple Master. He was Qin Sang's preferred candidate, the ideal person to oversee the domain.</p><p>It would be a great pity if Li Yufu ultimately stopped at the Nascent Soul stage.</p><p>Different inheritances had vastly different potential, and the Dao Court's inheritance was undoubtedly among the most superior. Moreover, if he switched to cultivating the Dao Court's thunder arts, Qin Sang could assist him further.</p><p>It was foreseeable that the thunder arts lineage would become the mainstream and most powerful lineage within the Azure Goat Temple in the future.</p><p>"Disciple will obey Martial Uncle's command!" Li Yufu said respectfully.</p><p>"You possess dual water and wood spiritual roots. The water spiritual root is one of the five elemental spiritual roots most suited for cultivating thunder arts. After receiving the Dharma teachings, you will take charge of the Five Thunders Court in my stead, temporarily assuming the position of Deputy Envoy of the Five Thunders Court…"</p><p>Qin Sang gave a few more instructions, then suddenly sensed something and looked towards the sky.</p><p>Li Yufu exited the cave dwelling, returning shortly after with a solemn expression.  "It's an urgent message from the Wu tribe. Fellow Daoist Fang's vital essence is depleted, beyond recovery. He will undergo spirit dissolution soon."</p><p>Qin Sang sighed and rose to his feet. "Let us go bid farewell to Fellow Daoist Fang."</p><p>Li Yufu acknowledged with a "Yes," then formed hand seals. A phoenix cry resounded from outside the cave dwelling, and a colorful phoenix landed before the cave, its body prostrate.</p><p>The colorful phoenix was none other than the Phoenix King.  Having made contributions in the previous war, Qin Sang, recognizing that she wasn't the mastermind behind the demon rebellion, allowed her to leave the demon army and become a guardian spirit beast of the Azure Goat Temple.</p><p>The Phoenix King was also one to endure humiliation for a greater purpose, willingly serving as the Temple Master's mount for three hundred years in exchange for freedom afterwards. Li Yufu, as the Temple Master, required a certain level of grandeur when venturing out. After consulting with Qin Sang, he granted the Phoenix King's request.</p><p>Master and disciple mounted the colorful phoenix and flew out of the mountain gate. Qin Sang released his true essence, enveloping the three of them, drastically increasing their speed.</p><p>The colorful phoenix flew like lightning, crossing countless mountains and rivers, arriving at the sacred mountain of the Wu tribe.</p><p>A young Wu tribesman led others to greet them outside the mountain, his expression filled with grief.</p><p>"Are you Fellow Daoist Fang's adopted son?" Qin Sang asked.</p><p>The young Wu tribesman bowed deeply. "This junior is Mingqiu, paying respects to Fellow Daoist Qin and Temple Master Li!"</p><p>"How is Fellow Daoist Fang's condition? I had thought it would be another twenty or thirty years before…"</p><p>Qin Sang expressed his regret.</p><p>Mingqiu's face was filled with self-reproach. "Foster father depleted his vital essence prematurely to help this junior achieve a breakthrough… This junior is unfilial!"</p><p>Mingqiu then led Qin Sang and the others into the sacred mountain, arriving at Old Demon Fang's chambers.</p><p>Entering the chambers, Qin Sang saw Old Demon Fang seated upon his throne, motionless.  He could sense only an extremely faint aura.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Fang," Qin Sang called out.</p><p>A cicada wing twitched slightly, and a weak yet still spirited laugh emerged. "With Fellow Daoist Qin seeing me off, what fear is there of the path to the Netherworld? Mingqiu!"</p><p>"Your child is here!" Mingqiu knelt heavily on the ground.</p><p>"From now on, you are the new Great Wu Zhu of the Wu tribe!"</p><p>Mingqiu kowtowed, his voice choked with sorrow. "This child obeys!"</p><p>"Do any of you have objections?"</p><p>Outside the chambers, a group of Wu tribe elders bowed to Mingqiu, chanting in unison, "Greetings, Great Wu Zhu!"</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Qin…"</p><p>Seemingly having expended more vital essence, Old Demon Fang paused for a long while before continuing with effort. "I have followed your instructions and selected a number of promising youngsters. Mingqiu will personally instruct them from now on. Also… If my descendants prove unworthy and offend you, I hope Fellow Daoist Qin will show mercy, expelling them to fend for themselves."</p><p>Qin Sang sighed.  "Now that the Storm Realm is free from internal and external threats, I also hope that the three tribes can coexist harmoniously and together pursue the Great Dao."</p><p>Old Demon Fang, with his cicada body, showed no facial expression, but his cicada wings gradually drooped, his aura fading.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Qin, do you still remember the Seven Kills Hall?"</p><p>Old Demon Fang's voice grew even weaker.</p><p>"How could I forget?"</p><p>Images flashed through Qin Sang's mind.</p><p>The Old Demon Fang of the past, and the Great Wu Zhu of the present.</p><p>Old Demon Fang's fate likely took a turn at that moment, the moment he was saved by the Great Wu Zhu at the cost of his life.</p><p>A long silence followed.  Old Demon Fang's aura almost completely dissipated. Just as everyone thought he had ascended,</p><p>"In this life…"</p><p>Old Demon Fang's voice was like the呓语 of a dying man.</p><p>"I have no regrets! I have not failed the Wu tribe, nor have I failed… the Great Wu Zhu."</p><p>Old Demon Fang's body trembled, his cicada wings rising high. A long cicada cry echoed throughout the sacred mountain.</p><p>His final life force transformed into a resounding final note.</p><p>Then, silence.</p><p>"Foster father!" Mingqiu wept.</p><p>"Farewell, Great Wu Zhu!"</p><p>Countless Wu tribe cultivators, gathered around the sacred mountain, spontaneously knelt and wailed in grief.</p><p>Before the chambers, even the Wu tribe elders involuntarily knelt, a testament to Old Demon Fang's prestige.</p><p>Li Yufu bowed solemnly.</p><p>Qin Sang sighed inwardly, murmuring, "Safe travels, Fellow Daoist Fang."</p><p>The world had lost another old friend.</p><p>The funeral, according to Old Demon Fang's wishes, was simple but not without proper rites.  Several important figures still needed to be invited, such as the various dominant powers of the Storm Realm. Upon learning that Qin Sang was also at the Wu tribe's sacred mountain, far more people came to pay their respects than anticipated.  Aside from those in seclusion, virtually every prominent figure was present.</p><p>Taking this opportunity, Qin Sang briefly interacted with the various factions, hinting at his future plans and urging them to prepare.</p><p>Only after the funeral concluded did Qin Sang depart from the Wu tribe's sacred mountain and return to the Azure Goat Temple. </p>
