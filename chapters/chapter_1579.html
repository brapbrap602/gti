<h1>Chapter 1570: The Snow Fox's Abilities</h1><p>Chapter 1570: The Snow Fox's Abilities</p><p>Countless ice spirits filled their vision.</p><p>Qin Sang quickly scanned them, spotting only a few ice spirits with thin blue lines on their foreheads – the ice spirit leaders, as Old Man Yanshan had described.</p><p>One, resembling a small spotted deer,  walked and paused on the snow, lively and playful.  The blue line on its forehead was about three inches long, the longest among all the leaders.</p><p>However, these leaders weren't clustered together; they were widely dispersed, suggesting they were playing in the snow rather than drawn to the snow fox.</p><p>"The snow fox is extremely sensitive to the scent of humans.  If startled, it will hide and be nearly impossible to find. We can only wait for the snow to weaken.  Daoist Brother, you must remain hidden.  And, before finding the snow fox, do not use your spiritual sense," Old Man Yanshan cautioned.</p><p>He then reached to his waist, producing a droplet of water.  With a gentle rub of his finger, the droplet expanded into a thin membrane that enveloped his entire body.</p><p>A layer of water membrane covered Old Man Yanshan; light passed directly through it.</p><p>Qin Sang was surprised by Old Man Yanshan's seriousness, even before they had located the snow fox's area, realizing the fox's senses must be incredibly sharp.  He watched as Old Man Yanshan gradually blurred before him, leaving only a faint outline to facilitate communication.</p><p>Qin Sang readily complied.</p><p>The *Qingwei Records*, which he practiced with his external manifestation, contained a technique called the Minor Qingwei Escape Method, particularly well-suited to this icy environment.  Moreover, his external manifestation was a wooden body, lacking the scent of blood and flesh, making it relatively easy to conceal from the snow fox's perception.</p><p>Qin Sang used the Minor Qingwei Escape Method, blending into the snowy night.</p><p>In the heavy snow, two faintly visible figures moved across the snow.</p><p>Old Man Yanshan led the way. Clearly experienced, he followed a few straight lines, effectively surveying the distribution of ice spirits across the snowfield.</p><p>They stopped on the other side of the snowfield.</p><p>Old Man Yanshan scanned the surroundings.  "There are no clustered ice spirit leaders on the snow's surface. The snow fox isn't there; we must search the ravines beneath the snow layer."</p><p>"Where should we begin?"</p><p>Confident Old Man Yanshan had a plan, Qin Sang asked directly.</p><p>Old Man Yanshan looked north and pointed.  "Without using spiritual sense, a random search risks consuming too much time.  If the snow gets heavier, we'll miss our chance.  The ravines are haphazard, but I've noticed some patterns... let's go down from that spot!"</p><p>They immediately set off, flying more than ten miles north, landing on the snow, silently merging with the white expanse.</p><p>They passed through the snow layer.</p><p>Qin Sang immediately felt a biting wind, carrying ice shards and snow spray, creating swirling gusts against the rock walls – a ceaseless phenomenon.</p><p>It was colder here than on the snow's surface.</p><p>The thick snow layer blocked all light.  Yet it wasn't completely dark.  The ice spirits emitted a faint blue light, barely visible on the snow's surface, but here it served as their only light source.</p><p>The wind blew from the depths of the ravine. The ice spirits, light as they were, were happily tossed about by the wind.</p><p>Old Man Yanshan and Qin Sang, one in front of the other, descended a short distance, stopping roughly in the middle of the ravine, before flying forward, searching along the ravine – one watching above, the other below.</p><p>The number of ice spirits under the snow was even greater.</p><p>They had to carefully avoid the ice spirits to avoid alarming the snow fox.</p><p>Even following Old Man Yanshan's planned route was a considerable undertaking.</p><p>Along the way, Qin Sang saw various ice spirits, causing him to wonder if he could make use of them.</p><p>He remembered Xuan Tian Palace had a secret technique for creating ice spirit-like attendants, meticulously cultivated, potentially evolving into beings comparable to Nascent Soul cultivators.</p><p>After searching for a while, Qin Sang captured an ice spirit leader.</p><p>This "leader," however, held no actual authority over the others; it was merely Old Man Yanshan's term. Ice spirits rarely fought amongst themselves; it was simply their nature.</p><p>Such creatures were extremely rare in the cultivation world.</p><p>Holding the ice spirit leader, Qin Sang studied it intently. Old Man Yanshan noticed his actions, glanced at him, but said nothing.</p><p>"Simple creatures, their bodies entirely composed of cold energy.  How they developed intelligence is unknown. Their potential is limited. I wonder if the strongest leaders might be different..." Qin Sang concluded.</p><p>Leaving the Frost Spirit leader, Qin Sang was considering capturing others when Yan Shan Lao Ren's voice suddenly rang out, "Look above!"</p><p>Qin Sang paused, looking where the sound came from.</p><p>Above and to their front, three points of blue light, significantly brighter than their surroundings, flickered in the darkness.</p><p>From experience, only Frost Spirit leaders emitted such bright light.</p><p>After searching for a while, this was the first time they had encountered three Frost Spirit leaders together.</p><p>"Found them so quickly?"</p><p>Qin Sang was surprised. They had only been below the snow layer for less than an hour.</p><p>"Let's go take a look," Yan Shan Lao Ren said softly, activating his invisibility artifact to its maximum, silently approaching.</p><p>Of course, the Tianmu Butterfly's vision clearly showed Yan Shan Lao Ren's movements.</p><p>Qin Sang also completely concealed herself, following behind Yan Shan Lao Ren.</p><p>The three Frost Spirit leaders—one resembling a flying horse, two like birds—flew around in the wide canyon, sometimes close, sometimes apart.</p><p>They bumped into each other, scratching each other playfully.</p><p>Being composed of frost energy, the Frost Spirits were insubstantial and such collisions wouldn't cause injuries.</p><p>While it looked like play, Yan Shan Lao Ren explained they were actually fighting;  this only happened when they were vying for something, and this was the most intense level of conflict.</p><p>Following the three leaders, they had yet to see any others.</p><p>Yan Shan Lao Ren advised Qin Sang to be patient and follow them.</p><p>Unaware of the trackers, the three Frost Spirit leaders continued their chaotic battle, speeding through numerous ravines, without a clear direction, much faster than ordinary Frost Spirits.</p><p>Qin Sang and Yan Shan Lao Ren patiently followed, passing through dozens of ravines, until they finally spotted two more Frost Spirits.</p><p>Both sides saw each other, emitting high-pitched cries, before joining the fray.</p><p>It was a hilariously chaotic battle.</p><p>These Frost Spirits showed no sense of alliance;  they would team up to attack one, only to turn on each other a moment later, getting beaten up in return.</p><p>A battle between five Frost Spirit leaders was incredibly rare.</p><p>Yan Shan Lao Ren became more certain that the snow fox was nearby.</p><p>However, he dissuaded Qin Sang from searching independently, suggesting that following the Frost Spirits would lead them to the snow fox more reliably.</p><p>The two then observed the pointless battle.</p><p>As time passed, more Frost Spirit leaders joined the fight. Initially meandering aimlessly, they seemed to receive some signal and rushed towards the same direction.</p><p>Qin Sang and Yan Shan Lao Ren perked up, quickly following.</p><p>The Frost Spirit leaders increased their speed, emitting excited cries.  Those in the front ignored the fight, flying ahead, while those behind frantically tried to impede their opponents.</p><p>Qin Sang and Yan Shan Lao Ren deliberately slowed down, maintaining a distance.</p><p>Shortly after, the ravine ended.</p><p>Rounding a bend, the terrain suddenly opened up into an oval space.</p><p>This space connected to a dozen canyons.  Cold winds poured in from all directions, converging in the space, creating a strange whistling sound that drowned out the Frost Spirits' cries.</p><p>When the five Frost Spirit leaders burst out, dozens more were already fighting amongst themselves within the space.</p><p>They paused, briefly, before joining the melee, completely unaware of whom they were fighting.</p><p>Witnessing this strange sight, Qin Sang was speechless.</p><p>Yan Shan Lao Ren, however, remained unfazed, and used telepathy to instruct Qin Sang to focus on the center of the group.</p><p>Qin Sang looked intently, noticing a white vortex of wind carrying ice particles and snowflakes forming in the center of the space.</p><p>Yan Shan Lao Ren remained still, and Qin Sang patiently waited.</p><p>The chaotic battle continued for a while.</p><p>Without warning, all the Frost Spirit leaders stopped fighting, falling into an eerie silence.</p><p>Then, a white airflow surged upwards from within the vortex.</p><p>Using the Tianmu Butterfly's abilities, Qin Sang finally saw clearly.</p><p>At the center of the vortex was a white fox, suspended in the airflow, slowly rising.</p><p>The fox was completely white, its fur smooth and flawless.  It was sleeping, its limbs curled up, its fluffy tail wrapped around its head, forming a ball.</p><p>It seemed to have been awakened by the commotion.</p><p>The fox's slender eyes fluttered slightly, slowly opening to reveal ice-like clear pupils, reflecting the surrounding Frost Spirit leaders.</p><p>Its tail twitched, and the fox elegantly stood up, stretching, causing some fine hairs to fly off.</p><p>Tianmudie saw clearly that these hairs were actually slender threads of ice, meaning the Snow Fox wasn't a creature of flesh and blood.</p><p>Upon seeing the Snow Fox's shed fur, the Hanling leaders became agitated, scrambling to grab it—this was what they truly desired.</p><p>The Snow Fox ignored the Hanlings, choosing a ravine and departing with graceful steps.  The Hanling leaders, after securing the fur, pursued it.</p><p>Qin Sang observed everything, hearing the voice transmission from Old Man Yanshan, “Quickly follow, and see if you can see it disappear.”</p><p>The Snow Fox's form shimmered as it moved, a skill likely stemming from instinct. Qin Sang linked his mind with Tianmudie and pursued.</p><p>Its destination was unknown. Its pace was moderate, leading a group of Hanling leaders, seemingly strolling beneath the snow.</p><p>After a distance, Qin Sang's expression shifted. The Snow Fox subtly faded, reappearing within a single breath.</p><p>“How is it?”</p><p>Old Man Yanshan's voice, full of anticipation, reached his ears.</p><p>Qin Sang replied, “I can see it; it's simply a concealment technique.”  He silently praised Tianmudie in his heart.</p><p>Old Man Yanshan expressed approval, his tone lighter with a hint of joy, but remained cautious,  “The Snow Fox may possess other abilities.  Years ago, Master Situ, racking his brains and using the precious treasures of Mount Bunen, set a trap, yet it still escaped, leaving only two small pieces of Han crystal.  To this day, he can't understand how it escaped. Moreover, the same trap can only be used once...”</p><p>Qin Sang inquired, "Senior Brother knows its habits better than I. What's the plan?  Should we capture the Snow Fox directly?”</p><p>Old Man Yanshan hesitated, “That's all we can do.  Don't you have a powerful restrictive technique?  Give it a try. Even if we can't capture it, we can follow it to its lair. If even you are unable to track it, we must withdraw and devise another plan.”</p><p>“Good!”</p><p>Qin Sang ordered Tianmudie to keep a close watch on the Snow Fox and silently chanted an incantation, unleashing the Xuan Tian Yi Qi Da Qin Na hand technique.  Old Man Yanshan followed behind Qin Sang, secretly producing a thin rope, anticipating the Snow Fox's movement and setting an ambush ahead.</p><p>Moments later…</p><p>Unaware, the Snow Fox continued at its leisurely pace.</p><p>Suddenly, it seemed to sense something, its body crouching, its four paws stiffening.</p><p>Behind it, a gigantic hand of spiritual energy materialized, fingers splayed, seizing it.</p><p>Simultaneously, Qin Sang emerged from the shadows, shouting, “Attack!”</p><p>The Hanling leaders were frozen in place by the spiritual energy hand, displaying expressions of terror. The space around the Snow Fox solidified.</p><p>During the thirty years of protecting the main body, the external manifestation had not been idle and had cultivated this technique to perfection; its power was incomparable.  The restrictive power of the spiritual energy hand, was particularly formidable.  Even cultivators of the same level would struggle to break free if caught.</p><p>The Snow Fox’s abilities were unique, its strength immeasurable, so Qin Sang held nothing back.  Simultaneously, a thin rope shot down from above, vibrating slightly, emitting concentric ripples towards the Snow Fox.</p><p>Qin Sang and Old Man Yanshan attacked simultaneously.</p><p>Facing this double restriction, the Snow Fox seemed completely unfazed, unaffected, diving downwards, vanishing into thin air.</p><p>Seeing his technique fail, Qin Sang immediately halted the spiritual energy hand, focusing entirely on Tianmudie.  He saw a blurry shadow.</p><p>Delighted, Qin Sang shouted, “Quick, pursue!”</p><p>Hearing this, Old Man Yanshan, equally elated, pursued after Qin Sang.</p><p>The Snow Fox was slightly slower than them. However, during the chase, they discovered that the Snow Fox could teleport, easily increasing its distance from them.  And this ability allowed it to traverse even rock.</p><p>Qin Sang, with the Stepping-on-Snow Divine Blade already in hand, directly used it to carve a passage through the wall.  </p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The two burst through the rocks, continuing to pursue the Snow Fox relentlessly.</p><p>Along the way, Qin Sang and Old Man Yanshan used various restrictive techniques, but none could restrain the Snow Fox.</p><p>Old Man Yanshan sighed, “No wonder it always escaped my pursuit before.”</p><p>The Snow Fox wasn't heading straight down, but diagonally forward, towards a specific direction.</p><p>“I guessed right!  It's probably fleeing back to its lair!”  Old Man Yanshan exclaimed.</p><p>With this realization, the two were no longer in a hurry, keeping a watchful distance behind the Snow Fox.</p>
