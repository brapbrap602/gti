<h1>Chapter 912: The Shuttle</h1><p>Qin Sang focused his mind and circulated his cultivation technique with all his might. He knew that this was the process of channeling stellar energy to temper his body.  If successful, his body would undergo a transformation. By then, his physical strength alone would be enough to rival early Core Formation cultivators!</p><p>His body alternated between pain and numbness.  It felt as if not a single part of him was unscathed. His skin split open, and his bones cracked.  The blood seeping from his wounds wasn't bright red, suggesting impurities were being purged by the stellar energy.</p><p>Blood refinement, bone forging, tendon transformation, marrow cleansing. Each term represented a metamorphosis, and also excruciating pain.</p><p>"Ancient body cultivators must have endured these transformations repeatedly to achieve their incredible powers. This is just the beginning for me.  There's no reason I can't persevere," Qin Sang thought.  He had relied on his unwavering will to reach this point, and wouldn't back down now.</p><p>The stellar energy infusion continued.  Qin Sang cast aside distracting thoughts, focusing on guiding the energy and seeking a breakthrough.</p><p>Soon, the pillar of light gradually dissipated.  The stellar energy drawn by the Star Platform receded like a tide. The Skyeye Butterfly, the Fat Silkworm, and the Twin-Headed Serpent, who had been absorbing the residual energy, stopped to recover and watched Qin Sang's breakthrough.  They were puzzled when he seemed unchanged.</p><p>Suddenly, Qin Sang moved.  With a wave of his hand, the Azure Root and a Tyrant Blood Fruit flew out of their jade box and were swallowed whole.</p><p>Tyrant Blood Fruit, Azure Root, and Scorpion Venom Grass.  He hadn't collected them all, but even a single one of these spirit herbs could aid his breakthrough.</p><p>The herbs turned into a fiery energy in his stomach, bringing another wave of intense pain. The Tyrant Blood Fruit's properties were extremely potent, and the Azure Root was only slightly milder.  Since the energy erupted within his body, unlike the dispersed stellar energy, Qin Sang would have been unable to withstand the impact if he hadn't already mastered the first two levels of the "Demonic Refinement Technique."</p><p>His internal organs felt as if they were shifting.</p><p>With a roar, Qin Sang straightened his body and formed a hand seal.  A flash of green light appeared behind him, and a pair of phoenix wings unfurled.</p><p>As the Demonic Transformation activated, Qin Sang's expression eased.  Moments later, a continuous stream of light emerged from his body and flowed into the wings. The initially translucent wings became more solid and radiant, resembling true phoenix wings.</p><p>With a whoosh, the wings propelled Qin Sang off the Star Platform.</p><p>A series of explosions echoed from his body as his aura surged. His wounds rapidly healed, and a faint green light flashed before disappearing.  His body became as flawless as jade, yet brimming with terrifying power!</p><p>Qin Sang let out a triumphant roar that reverberated through the air.</p><p>His eyelids fluttered open, revealing pupils that had turned green.  With a flicker, he appeared at the edge of the barrier and unleashed a powerful punch.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>A dazzling barrier appeared.  The mountains trembled, and flocks of Rotwings took flight in terror.</p><p>Cracking sounds echoed as the barrier fractured under the force of Qin Sang's punch.</p><p>The Twin-Headed Serpent's eyes narrowed, fixated on Qin Sang's wings. The Fat Silkworm lay lazily, waiting to be fed. The Skyeye Butterfly, delighted for its master, danced around him and nuzzled his cheek with its wings.</p><p>Qin Sang retracted his fist and stepped back, in full control.</p><p>"Though this barrier isn't particularly strong, it's not easily broken either. To cause such damage without using any spiritual energy... With the Demonic Transformation, my physical strength alone can suppress early Core Formation cultivators.  The demonic heritage truly is remarkable," Qin Sang thought, pleasantly surprised.</p><p>"I just tested it, and my movement speed has greatly increased.  The residual energy from those two spirit herbs, initially meant to boost my breakthrough chances, needs to be refined. My body can become even stronger..."</p><p>With that in mind, Qin Sang stroked the Skyeye Butterfly, glanced at the Twin-Headed Serpent, and then stored the Star Platform. After making arrangements for them, he found a secluded chamber and entered to cultivate.</p><p>â€¦</p><p>Spring turned to autumn, and the years flew by. A decade is a significant portion of a mortal's life, filled with countless memories.</p><p>Qin Sang spent this decade in dedicated cultivation on the Venomous Isle, undisturbed.  Other cultivators hadn't noticed the island's anomaly, allowing him to focus on his training.</p><p>Both he and his avatar steadily improved their cultivation.</p><p>As the opening of the Seven Kills Hall drew near, Qin Sang felt a growing sense of urgency. Although he had anticipated it, the cultivation pace after entering the third level of the "Demonic Refinement Technique" and his avatar's Core Formation was slower than expected.</p><p>At this rate, he might not meet the Sword Path's requirements by the time the Seven Kills Hall opened.</p><p>The "Demonic Refinement Technique" was manageable; reaching the mid-stage of the third level would suffice for his physical body. His avatar posed a greater challenge.  Reaching peak Core Formation in time would be difficult without resorting to risky, rapid advancement techniques.</p><p>Qin Sang suspected his own mid-Core Formation cultivation base was the bottleneck, limiting the effectiveness of blood refinement and body tempering.</p><p>Two years ago, progress on the "Spirit Nurturing Sword Chapter" had stalled, but a subsequent discovery had relieved him.</p><p>As he'd suspected, the limitation lay with the Ebony Sword, not himself.  This wouldn't hinder his comprehension of the Killing Talismans.  Once he found a superior spirit wood to resist the Netherblood Mulberry, or returned to the Small Cold Realm for more Netherblood Mulberry, his cultivation could advance rapidly.</p><p>This was good news, easing his anxiety. He decided to wait until entering the Seven Kills Hall and confirming the teleportation formation's status before considering changing cultivation techniques. Besides, he hadn't found a suitable one yet.</p><p>Qin Sang emerged from meditation, pondering these matters.  Suddenly, he sensed something, looked towards the cave entrance, and frowned.</p><p>North of the Venomous Isle.</p><p>Dozens of desolate islands dotted this region of the sea, all uninhabited.  Due to the Rotwings and the area's barrenness, cultivators rarely ventured near, often choosing to detour.</p><p>Now, a blue shuttle was speeding towards this area, flying erratically as it passed several islands, seemingly headed straight for the Venomous Isle.</p>
