Chapter 423 Cultivation


“A treasure of heaven and earth!”


Qin Sang’s expression changed, understanding that Yun Youzi’s hidden injury required a top-tier spirit herb.  He began worrying about the treatment again, and quickly asked, “Senior, how is your cultivation now?”


Li Yu Fu responded with a relaxed expression, “Grand Master’s cultivation has reached perfection. Three years ago, upon leaving seclusion, he was already at the False Core stage. Grand Master originally wanted to personally visit you, but things seemed urgent, so he left in a hurry and asked me to come in his place.”


Hearing this news, Qin Sang was astonished.


Twenty-eight years ago, Yun Youzi had just broken through to the mid-Foundation Establishment stage.


Now, he had surpassed Qin Sang, entering the False Core stage first!


Could Yun Youzi’s talent rival that of Senior Qing Zhu, who cultivates the *Yuanshen Yangjian Zhang*?


Of course, the greatest hurdle is Core Formation. Countless brilliant individuals are trapped before this stage, never making an inch of progress their entire lives!


This is the advantage of high talent. Yun Youzi was able to reach Foundation Establishment at the age of one hundred, his talent speaks for itself.


If not for his hidden injury, it's hard to imagine the astonishing achievements Yun Youzi could have made!


I cultivated the *Yuanshen Yangjian Zhang*, painstakingly, with the aid of the Killing Talisman, and still couldn't catch up.


Interrupting cultivation after breaking through to the False Core stage to attend to other matters – Yun Youzi's premonition may come true. His hidden injury will likely greatly affect his Core Formation.


Otherwise, based on Qin Sang’s understanding of Yun Youzi, he would certainly have endured the solitude, closing himself off to cultivate diligently until Core Formation before emerging.


“Important matters come first!”


Qin Sang waved his hand unconcernedly, “After returning to the sect and seeing your Grand Master, tell him that if he needs help, just send a message.”


He was no longer a novice. Facing the Flying Night Rakshasa again, he had some ability to maneuver, unlike last time when he was helpless.


Unexpectedly, Li Yu Fu gently shook his head and said, “Master Uncle, after delivering the Harmony Pill to Master Uncle per Grand Master’s instructions, I am going to the Yun Cang Marsh to train.”


Yun Cang Marsh?


The Yun Cang Marsh now is unlike before; to describe it as a dragon's lair and tiger's den would not be an exaggeration.


Qin Sang frowned upon hearing this and asked, “What arrangements does your senior have for you?”


Li Yu Fu answered honestly, “Grand Master asked me to act with several senior brothers to become familiar with the Yun Cang Marsh; the future is up to me to decide.”


Qin Sang nodded slightly. Li Yu Fu was already a Foundation Establishment cultivator; he needed to forge his own path to achieve anything.


Yun Youzi probably intended this, so he decided to let go.


The extent of his good fortune will depend on Li Yu Fu's own opportunities and abilities.


Guessing Yun Youzi's intentions, Qin Sang naturally wouldn't rashly intervene.  After a moment's thought, he took out a pair of male and female swords from his storage pouch.


While only high-grade, these male and female swords contained cold gold within their blades, not inferior to top-grade magic weapons. They were one of Qin Sang's proudest creations, originally intended as gifts.


Regardless of the relationship with Su Shi Mingyue, Yun Youzi considered Li Yu Fu his direct disciple, so this pair of spirit swords was a worthy gift.


Li Yu Fu received the male and female swords, his excitement evident. “Thank you, Master Uncle!”


“Go,” Qin Sang did not detain Li Yu Fu, “The situation in Yun Cang Marsh is becoming increasingly chaotic, remember to be careful…I suspect that in a short time, I too will be summoned by the sect to the battlefield. Until then…”


Qin Sang was not exaggerating; the situation in the Yun Cang Marsh was becoming increasingly tense.


The Xiao Han Domain and the Tian Xing League had not yet openly clashed, but small-scale skirmishes continued, with casualties on both sides, and hatred accumulating.


In recent years, Shao Hua Mountain’s Foundation Establishment disciples have either been sent to Xuanlu Pass to defend it, or summoned to the Yun Cang Marsh.


Qin Sang had also received several messages from the sect.


Fortunately, Qi Yuan Shou had intervened, and Qin Sang, claiming he was in the midst of a crucial breakthrough, had delayed until now.


He estimated he couldn’t delay much longer.


After seeing Li Yu Fu off, Qin Sang couldn’t wait to return to his cave dwelling and take out the Harmony Pill.


Holding the moon-white spirit pill between his fingers, Qin Sang inhaled the rich fragrance of the spirit pill, his mind intoxicated!


The Harmony Pill was also very potent, but slightly inferior to the Xuanwen Harmony Pill. If the pill proved ineffective for Qin Sang, the medicinal power couldn't be used to improve cultivation, and he would only watch the potency go to waste.


Concerning his own foundation, even if all the Harmony Pills were wasted, it would be worth it!


Qin Sang took a deep breath and swallowed the spirit pill.


The spirit pill entered his stomach, and Qin Sang's heart was calm as he slowly refined it.


The cave dwelling was unusually quiet; Qin Sang remained motionless like an ancient pine.


A long time later, a long sigh suddenly echoed in the cave dwelling.


Qin Sang woke up from his meditative state at some point, opening his eyes and staring blankly at the walls of his cave dwelling.


The Harmony Pill's effect was less than half that of the Xuanwen Harmony Pill he'd used before.  Most of its potency was wasted.  Qin Sang had anticipated this, and it was disheartening.  But remembering Yun Youzi's repeated failures, his unwavering resolve despite setbacks, Qin Sang banished his doubts and regained his composure.

He slowly exhaled, then re-entered meditation, his spirit sinking into his inner world.  On the ebony sword, three and a half Killing Talismans shone, steadily absorbing spiritual energy and boosting his cultivation.

Now, Qin Sang's cultivation speed slightly surpassed that of a three-spirit-root cultivator!  He had previously only refined the Blood Droplet Ghost Mushroom; two bottles of Li Long Pills remained unused.  After his breakthrough, he had diligently cultivated for seven years.  Barring unforeseen circumstances, in another ten years he could catch up to Yun Youzi and begin preparations for forming his Golden Core!

Qin Sang most hoped that the Xiao Han Domain and the Tianxing League would maintain restraint, at least until he reached the False Core stage.  Alas, things rarely go as planned.

Three months into his seclusion, Qin Sang received a message from his sect, his expression one of resignation.  The message was from Qi Yuan Shou himself, ordering Qin Sang to immediately return to the sect, regardless of his cultivation progress. The message was firm, leaving no room for refusal.

Qin Sang had delayed reporting his true cultivation level to buy time.  He'd even discussed this with Li Yu Fu a few months ago, and now, it had come to pass—Qi Yuan Shou had summoned him.

Qin Sang had no intention of betraying Mount Shao Hua. While he might feel neglected there, he enjoyed the freedom and lack of restrictions. In times of need, he could still seek help from his sect.  Why would he leave?  He could only obey.

Qin Sang reviewed his cultivation and magical implements. He wasn't worried about the dangers of Yun Cang Marsh—as long as he didn't encounter a Golden Core cultivator from the Tianxing League, he could come and go freely. His concern was that sect duties would interfere with his cultivation. He hoped Qi Yuan Shou's assignments would be manageable.

Qin Sang relinquished his cave dwelling, transferred ownership of the 'Sword Pavilion' shop to Ning Youwei, and left Qingyang Market alone.  Before leaving, Qin Sang turned to look deeply at the direction of the Qingyang Demon Sect and the Wuyaya Valley.

He hadn't yet dealt with the peak-stage Yao Ling dragon because he lacked confidence in extracting its essence.  Without the dragon's essence, his efforts would be in vain. Qin Sang planned to return after reaching the False Core stage.
