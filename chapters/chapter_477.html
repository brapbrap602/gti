<h1>Chapter 470: A Battle of Magic</h1><p>After several dozen exchanges, Qin Sang had a good grasp of the elegant young man's capabilities. His cultivation was comparable to Senior Brother Rong and Miao Xinglan, but his combat experience was far inferior. He was even less experienced than the mediocre Core Formation cultivators on Stargazing Island.</p><p>However, he possessed a plethora of treasures. After the talisman, he unleashed several magical artifacts in rapid succession, each extraordinary and potent, making them difficult to defend against.  Combined, they forced Qin Sang to remain cautious.  Qin Sang guessed that the elegant young man's background was unusual.</p><p>Unfortunately for the young man, he was still too inexperienced. These magical artifacts couldn't translate his advantage into victory, even though Qin Sang hadn't used the Ebony Sword.</p><p>As the fight progressed, Qin Sang found it increasingly easier to cope, even managing to divide his attention and observe another battle.</p><p>Grandmother Jing was fighting two opponents.</p><p>Qin Sang now realized that the Azure鸞 wasn't just a mount. It possessed fearsome strength, exchanging blows with Yu Shanting and his magical treasure without yielding an inch.</p><p>The Azure鸞 helped Grandmother Jing separate her two opponents, allowing her to focus on Elder Starpalm.</p><p>Yu Shanting knew Grandmother Jing was the primary target and didn't want to be entangled with the Azure鸞. He tried to force it back and join forces with Elder Starpalm, but he couldn't break through.</p><p>‘Clang!’</p><p>A resounding bell chime echoed, shaking the heavens and earth, lingering in the air.</p><p>Purple mist swirled, sometimes condensing into swift, sharp swords and blades; other times transforming into various ferocious beasts – dragons, phoenixes, lions, tigers, and more – their ferocity boundless.</p><p>Neither blade nor beast could match the Azure鸞. They were quickly torn apart by its sharp claws and beak.</p><p>The bronze bell couldn't subdue the Azure鸞.  After several failed attempts, Yu Shanting was nearly pecked by it.  His composure cracked, his eyes filled with rage.</p><p>‘Clang!’</p><p>This bell chime was different, deep and resonant.</p><p>The bronze bell trembled violently, buzzing intensely. It left Yu Shanting's control, rising into the air before crashing down toward the Azure鸞.</p><p>Boundless purple mist erupted, covering the sky.</p><p>In this moment, the bronze bell resembled a towering mountain, carrying immense weight, accompanied by wind and thunder, as if trying to engulf, suppress, refine, and crush the Azure鸞 into dust.</p><p>The bell itself wasn't much larger than the Azure鸞, yet its enormous shadow enveloped the creature.  The increasingly loud chimes resonated deeply, like a tsunami, overwhelming in their power.</p><p>A human-like solemnity appeared in the Azure鸞's eyes, making Qin Sang question whether it was a wooden sculpture or a genuine Azure鸞.</p><p>The Azure鸞 was an ancient divine beast, existing only in legends, even more powerful than dragons and phoenixes.  No matter how strong Grandmother Jing was, how could she have found and tamed one?</p><p>If it were a spirit puppet, what powerful puppetry could imbue a wooden sculpture with such a spirit?</p><p>Facing the menacing bronze bell, the Azure鸞 let out a series of sharp cries, its fighting spirit intensifying.</p><p>It didn't call for help from Grandmother Jing. Instead, it spread its wings wide, its azure feathers shimmering with light.  The light converged, deepening in hue, as if the feathers were melting, igniting into azure flames.</p><p>The Azure鸞 transformed into a true divine bird, reborn from fire.</p><p>‘Screech!’</p><p>The beautiful cry overshadowed even the bell's chimes.</p><p>The Azure鸞 glared at the bronze bell as the azure flames soared skyward, forming a pillar of fire that shot straight toward the bell.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>A loud explosion echoed as the bronze bell was engulfed in azure fire.</p><p>Within the flames, a faint purple shimmered; the purple mist persisted, resisting the flames.</p><p>Yu Shanting rapidly changed his hand seals, causing the bronze bell to vibrate incessantly.</p><p>The Azure鸞, refusing to yield, continued to unleash azure fire.</p><p>Both man and beast exerted their full strength, locked in a stalemate, the outcome uncertain. Unable to predict the victor, Qin Sang shifted his gaze to Grandmother Jing.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the battle between Grandmother Jing and Elder Starpalm was even more arcane, devoid of overt displays of power, making it even harder to comprehend.</p><p>Night sky, bright moon, and countless stars.</p><p>Under the starry sky conjured by two magical treasures, Grandmother Jing and Elder Starpalm hovered.</p><p>The moon seemed brighter than before, a silver disc hanging high.</p><p>Grandmother Jing resembled a living Guanyin, sitting cross-legged in mid-air with her eyes closed. Behind her floated the unfurled Landscape and Hidden Moon Painting, though the moon was no longer depicted within it.</p><p>A thousand miles of verdant landscape, flowing clouds, and surging waves – the painting seemed to have come alive.</p><p>Elder Starpalm, also ignoring Grandmother Jing, raised both hands.  True to his name, his palms left afterimages as he manipulated the starry river.</p><p>He could pluck stars, but not the moon.</p><p>The stars became his chess pieces, forming various killing formations. Starlight of different shapes attacked Grandmother Jing or the moon.</p><p>These formations shifted rapidly, each possessing considerable power.  Qin Sang marveled at Elder Starpalm's treasure.</p><p>The starlight aimed at the moon was blocked by moonlight.  The starlight attacking Grandmother Jing fared even worse, swallowed by the Landscape and Hidden Moon Painting. Apart from causing the sea of clouds to churn more violently, it seemed to have little effect on Grandmother Jing.</p><p>Soon, Qin Sang noticed something else.</p><p>Stars at the edge of the starry sky dimmed and vanished one by one, seemingly obscured by the moonlight.  Once gone, they didn't reappear.</p><p>As each star vanished, a portion of space plunged into darkness, creating a strange ripple with barely visible cracks within.</p><p>While manipulating the killing formations and attacking Grandmother Jing, Elder Starpalm would move other stars to the edge, repairing the darkened areas.</p><p>It seemed this was necessary to prevent the collapse of the artificial night sky created by the treasure.</p><p>Qin Sang shifted his attention to Elder Starpalm.</p><p>Under the increasingly bright moonlight, Elder Starpalm stared intently at the night sky, his expression serious. His face seemed coated with sweat, reflecting the starlight, giving him a flushed appearance.</p><p>This contrasted sharply with Grandmother Jing's calmness.</p><p>Judging by their actions and their treasures, Qin Sang believed Grandmother Jing held the upper hand, but he couldn't be certain.</p><p>He couldn't continue observing, however, as the elegant young man's attacks suddenly intensified.</p><p>The young man realized Qin Sang had been distracted, feeling insulted and enraged.</p><p>Adding to his fury was the fact that, despite using all his resources, he couldn't overcome an opponent with inferior cultivation who dared to lose focus mid-battle.</p><p>"You're courting death!" the elegant young man roared, unleashing the full power of his talisman.</p><p>The black light conjured by the talisman darted around unpredictably, but Qin Sang could still track its movements.</p><p>The black hammer couldn't penetrate the blue mirror's barrier, unable to even touch Qin Sang's clothes.</p>
