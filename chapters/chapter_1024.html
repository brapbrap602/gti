<h1>Chapter 1116: Soul-Washing Liquid</h1><p>Ling Zhuzi paused, then changed his tone, solemnly warning, "Those who complete the trial the fastest will receive a significant reward.  The rewards are substantial, including high-grade magic treasures and even peculiar, damaged ancient artifacts. However, the trial grounds are far from safe; countless lives have been lost within.  Every time the Inner Hall opens, exceptionally talented cultivators meet their end there, a tragic waste…"</p><p>A murmur rippled through the square as Ling Zhuzi explained about the trial grounds.</p><p>The damaged ancient artifacts Ling Zhuzi mentioned were likely similar to the Red Yuan Shawl. These artifacts, due to damage, retain minimal power, making it difficult to determine their original grade.  Moreover, lacking the necessary materials and crafting knowledge, repair is nearly impossible.</p><p>Nevertheless, these damaged ancient artifacts possess extraordinary, unusual powers that could prove incredibly effective.</p><p>After Ling Zhuzi's explanation, Qin Sang had a better understanding of the trial grounds.</p><p>The trial grounds aren't a single path but rather a series of trials.</p><p>After completing a trial, a teleportation array awaits.</p><p>Participants can choose to quit or continue to the next trial.</p><p>Failure to complete three trials results in teleportation back to the Inner Hall entrance; success grants access to the Inner Hall.</p><p>As Ling Zhuzi said, the trial grounds, a legacy of human ancestors, demonstrate a protective intent, preventing reckless loss of life.</p><p>This indirectly highlights the Inner Hall's extreme danger.</p><p>Furthermore, cultivators participating in the trials can only find the teleportation array upon completing each trial; abandoning a trial mid-way is impossible.</p><p>This is the source of the danger Ling Zhuzi spoke of.</p><p>The trial grounds aren't static; even after all these years, their full nature remains unknown, making targeted preparation difficult.</p><p>Even surviving without immediate death, serious injury or entrapment would likely lead to a grim outcome.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered this.</p><p>He believed that if he couldn't complete the trials with his current strength, probably no other Foundation Establishment cultivator present could manage it.</p><p>Qin Sang was quite interested in the damaged ancient artifacts.</p><p>However, he reconsidered. Aside from the risks, focusing on the trials could consume considerable time, potentially jeopardizing more important matters.</p><p>Besides, he didn't lack treasures.</p><p>He possessed two top-grade magic treasures.</p><p>Even the best rewards from the trial grounds couldn't surpass a top-grade treasure, could they?</p><p>Qin Sang frowned, leaning towards abandoning the trials.</p><p>He glanced at Ning Wuhuai ahead, intending to discuss it with him and seek his opinion.</p><p>Simultaneously, Qin Sang continued searching for Elder Qingzhu.</p><p>By now, fewer new cultivators were arriving.</p><p>To his surprise, he hadn't seen Qingzhu.</p><p>"Could Elder Qingzhu be concealing their identity?"</p><p>Qin Sang wondered.</p><p>Ahead, Ling Zhuzi finished explaining the trial grounds' rules, then fell silent, clearing the entrance.</p><p>After a brief commotion,</p><p>the Foundation Establishment cultivators rushed up the steps and entered the right-hand door.</p><p>Noticing Ning Wuhuai deliberately slowing down, Qin Sang’s mind stirred, speeding ahead.</p><p>Reaching the door, Qin Sang heard a whispered voice transmission, his eyes widening before returning to normal as he stepped into the light curtain.</p><p>He had secretly decided to complete the trials and compete for the rewards!</p><p>The transmission came from Ning Wuhuai.</p><p>Among the trial's rewards, the most crucial treasure was Soul-Washing Liquid.</p><p>This wasn't a magic treasure but a spirit liquid.  Consuming Soul-Washing Liquid greatly benefits the spirit sense and might even aid in Nascent Soul cultivation!</p><p>Due to its extreme value and scarcity, competition is fierce.</p><p>However, the competition for Soul-Washing Liquid mostly occurs among major factions and sect heirs.</p><p>Yuan Ying cultivators aware of the Soul-Washing Liquid, and various factions, knowingly or unknowingly, maintain tight-lipped secrecy, limiting external knowledge.</p><p>Despite his extensive inquiries on Tianxing Island, Qin Sang had heard nothing.</p><p>This was the drawback of being an independent cultivator.</p><p>Lacking powerful sect backing and elders, access to true cultivation secrets was impossible.</p><p>Without Ning Wuhuai's warning, he might have missed this great opportunity.</p><p>Qin Sang sighed.</p><p>Even Ning Wuhuai hadn't known before.</p><p>He only learned of the Soul-Washing Liquid and its remarkable effects from his sect elders just before entering the Seven Kills Hall.</p><p>"Qin Daoist, if you're interested, try competing for the Soul-Washing Liquid. Though our time is tight, participating in the trial should still be feasible. However, the trials become increasingly dangerous, so be cautious and avoid overexertion,"</p><p>Ning Wuhuai advised.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't hesitate, giving a definite affirmative response.  He was deeply grateful for Ning Wuhuai's information.</p><p>Soul-Washing Liquid is not an ancient artifact.</p><p>Every chance to help with the infant's formation, he would seize tightly.</p><p>Returning to Xiao Han region, using the Soul Cleansing Liquid with the Nine Phantasmal Heavenly Orchid, the effect would surely be better!</p><p>After a brief exchange, the two entered the barrier one after another.</p><p>After seeing off all the Golden Core cultivators,</p><p>Ling Zhuzi chuckled, “All the juniors have gone in. We should also set off. Fellow Daoists, please.”</p><p>Saying so, Ling Zhuzi stepped into the left gate.</p><p>The Yuan Ying cultivators followed closely behind.</p><p>…</p><p>In the inner hall.</p><p>An unknown space.</p><p>Auspicious clouds clustered, rainbows shimmered, a truly beautiful fairyland.</p><p>The space was deathly silent.</p><p>Suddenly, four figures appeared out of thin air.</p><p>Two men and two women.</p><p>Two elderly people with a young boy and girl.</p><p>They passed through the auspicious clouds, flying to the deepest part of the space.</p><p>There was a huge white cloud, floating motionless in mid-air. Deep within the white cloud, something seemed to be sealed by a restriction.</p><p>The old woman took a step forward, raised her cane, and muttered something.</p><p>Suddenly, a dragon's roar echoed, and the cane came to life, transforming into a lifelike golden dragon. It circled in mid-air for a while, then suddenly plunged into the depths of the white cloud.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The golden dragon disappeared.</p><p>The boy and girl showed curious expressions.</p><p>The two elders remained expressionless, quietly watching the white cloud.</p><p>After a short while, the cloud suddenly burst with golden light, and a golden passage appeared before the four of them, leading directly to the depths of the white cloud.</p><p>Immediately, the old woman beckoned with her hand.</p><p>The golden dragon flew out of the cloud, quickly shrinking, its surface runes fading, and it transformed back into an extremely ordinary cane, falling into the old woman's hand.</p><p>“Let’s go.”</p><p>The old woman tapped her cane and walked into the passage side by side with the old man.</p><p>Entering the passage, their eyes were filled with golden light.</p><p>The boy and girl, their eyes narrowed, followed closely behind the two elders, curiously observing everything.</p><p>“Did you remember the incantation I just used?”</p><p>The old woman suddenly asked, her voice hoarse.</p><p>The boy and girl’s faces startled, and they respectfully said, “Reporting to Grandmaster, we have memorized it.”</p>
