<h1>**Chapter 260: Secret Scheme**</h1><p>As Qin Sang stepped back, his gaze swept over his surroundings, but he found nothing unusual. This was normal. If Old Man Di Que was trying to ambush Daoist Xuan Yu, he would definitely not show himself and would strike with the force of a thunderbolt.</p><p>At this moment, the restriction on the green stone was activated by the saber energy and shone brightly, forming a wall of light.</p><p>The Celestial Saber Talisman cut into the wall of light and seemed to encounter great resistance. Not only could it not break through the wall of light, but its speed also gradually decreased.</p><p>This showed how powerful the stone hall's restrictions were.</p><p>Daoist Xuan Yu's expression was solemn. He activated the Celestial Saber Talisman with all his might, not daring to relax. If he was overpowered by the stone hall's restrictions and was put in a passive position, not only would he have no hope of breaking through the restriction, but he might even be counterattacked by the restriction.</p><p>Although he believed he could dodge it, it was better to be safe than sorry.</p><p>Qin Sang caught a glimpse of Daoist Xuan Yu's actions from the corner of his eye and felt even more uneasy. He took out the Ghost Banner and hid it in his palm, secretly activating it. Then, his gaze shifted to the magma rolling below.</p><p>The two Core Formation cultivators, coupled with the mysterious ancient hall and its many restrictions, made Qin Sang's heart pound.</p><p>He was like an ant in front of them.</p><p>If a battle broke out and one side could quickly eliminate the other, it would be fine and would not affect Qin Sang too much. However, if they were in a stalemate, the situation would be hard to predict.</p><p>If he was swept away by the aftershock of the Golden Core cultivators' battle, he would be severely injured if not dead. Even worse, he would be exposed to the Golden Core cultivators' line of sight, and all his previous efforts would be in vain.</p><p>The space within the volcano was still not large enough. It was a pity that there were no firebirds in the lava. If he were to leave the firebird group now, he would have nowhere to hide and would still be discovered by them.</p><p>Just as this thought flashed through his mind, Qin Sang's gaze suddenly froze.</p><p>Behind Daoist Xuan Yu, the phantom of the Heaven's Sound Conch suddenly appeared!</p><p>As soon as the Heaven's Sound Conch appeared, it flickered and seemed to teleport to the top of Daoist Xuan Yu's head. The power of the Thousand Illusions Divine Sound gushed out of its shell.</p><p>These Thousand Illusions Divine Sound powers actually condensed into a crescent-shaped saber. It looked ethereal and harmless.</p><p>However, even though Qin Sang was so far away, he felt his hair stand on end and was filled with fear just by looking at it.</p><p>In an instant, the crescent saber arrived!</p><p>At this moment, Daoist Xuan Yu had also sensed the danger. However, the Heaven's Sound Conch had appeared too quickly and too strangely. Moreover, the timing was perfect, coinciding with the moment when he and the ancient hall's restrictions were in a bitter stalemate.</p><p>A wave of alarm surged through Daoist Xuan Yu's heart. He did not see the crescent saber with his own eyes, but he could clearly sense the aura it emitted, which represented death!</p><p>This made his scalp tingle. If he could not withstand this saber strike, he would likely die.</p><p>Daoist Xuan Yu roared and, with no time to think, hurriedly pulled the Celestial Saber Talisman, which was currently battling against the ancient hall's restrictions, out of the wall of light.</p><p>'Swoosh!'</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The Celestial Saber Talisman flew back like a meteor and, at the critical moment, firmly resisted the crescent saber.</p><p>The collision of the two 'weapons' gathered the power of the Core Formation cultivators. Visible fluctuations spread, causing the space to tremble and the magma to surge into towering waves.</p><p>'啪!'</p><p>A huge wave slammed into the stone platform, and scalding magma splashed all over Daoist Xuan Yu. He could not be bothered with this at all. Although the Celestial Saber Talisman had blocked the crescent saber's first sneak attack, the crisis was far from over.</p><p>'Buzz...'</p><p>The Celestial Saber Talisman trembled violently, and its light grew dimmer and dimmer. The saber's cry was like a mournful wail.</p><p>The Heaven's Sound Conch had been preparing for a long time, while the Celestial Saber Talisman had only hurriedly resisted. It was obvious which was stronger.</p><p>What shocked Daoist Xuan Yu even more was that the stone hall's restrictions were enraged by the Celestial Saber Talisman. The restrictions suddenly detached the Celestial Saber Talisman, and it immediately began to counterattack.</p><p>The wall of light rapidly expanded, and its blinding light was like a blazing sun. It卷起ed a terrifying hurricane and charged over, causing Daoist Xuan Yu to be greatly alarmed.</p><p>The stone hall's restrictions were in front, and the crescent saber was behind. This was a true dead end!</p><p>"Ah!"</p><p>Daoist Xuan Yu roared loudly. His hair bun had already come loose, and he looked like a madman. He suddenly made a shocking move and slapped his own dantian with his backhand!</p><p>In the next moment, the spiritual power on Daoist Xuan Yu's body suddenly erupted and was completely absorbed by the Celestial Saber Talisman. The saber light surged, directly cutting the crescent saber in half. Then, with lightning speed, it slashed at the main body of the Heaven's Sound Conch.</p><p>With a crisp sound of "Dang", the Celestial Conch was slashed and hurled tens of zhangs away, barely stabilizing itself. There was a clear crack on the conch shell!</p><p>However, the crescent moon saber did not dissipate after being cut off, but instead paused in mid-air and transformed back into the original power of the Thousand Illusions Divine Sound, converging into one place. Regardless of the heavily damaged Celestial Conch, it continued to kill Daoist Xuanyu.</p><p>At the same time, a hurricane from the formation of the stone hall 禁制 also approached head-on.</p><p>A green light lit up in Daoist Xuanyu's dantian, and an emerald jade disk slowly rose.</p><p>Qin Sang knew at first glance that this item must be Daoist Xuanyu's natal magic treasure, but what Qin Sang did not expect was that the emerald jade disk flew out of the dantian and then shattered with a bang!</p><p>Self-destructing magic treasure!</p><p>Qin Sang knew that this was a helpless move by Daoist Xuanyu, but he was also surprised by his decision.</p><p>After the magic treasure self-destructed, some of the green light blocked the oncoming hurricane, while the other part blocked the Thousand Illusions Divine Sound.</p><p>Daoist Xuanyu was finally able to escape from the dangerous situation. He disappeared and reappeared outside the stone platform.</p><p>His hair was disheveled, and he looked extremely embarrassed. He stared fiercely at the shuddering Celestial Conch.</p><p>The Heavenly Gang Saber Talisman also flew back to Daoist Xuanyu. The talisman was covered with cracks. He had been forced to exhaust the power of the talisman to cut through the crescent moon saber and get the opportunity to self-destruct the magic treasure. If this talisman was not refined again, it would be useless.</p><p>From the moment the Celestial Conch appeared, only a few breaths had passed. Daoist Xuanyu had lost two major treasures in a row.</p><p>秦桑 once again experienced the treacherousness and cunning of the Earth Deficiency Elder.</p><p>At this time, among the chaotic firebird group, the action of a firebird seemed very abrupt. It flew straight out of the bird swarm, passed through the barrier without any hindrance, entered the space, and finally transformed into a ball of flame.</p><p>A figure stepped out, and the flame slowly extinguished.</p><p>It was the Earth Deficiency Elder.</p><p>"It's you!"</p><p>Daoist Xuanyu's eyes were bloodshot!</p><p>"Old Bull Nose, doesn't the Celestial Conch taste good?"</p><p>The Earth Deficiency Elder smiled and glanced at the cracks on the Celestial Conch. A trace of heartache flashed in his eyes. "I didn't expect that Old Bull Nose, you could still injure this old man's magic treasure under such circumstances. The four great secret talismans of your sect really live up to their reputation! However, now that the talisman is on the verge of breaking, and your natal magic treasure is self-destructing, how much ability do you have left?"</p><p>"You dare to sneak attack me!"</p><p>Daoist Xuanyu's voice was as shrill as a ghost's. "The Shangyuan Qingjing Palace will definitely kill you!"</p><p>"The Shangyuan Qingjing Palace is thousands of miles away. It's not bad to use the name of your sect to scare children. Even if the old undying guy in your sect is a master strategist, it's too late for him to save you now." The Earth Deficiency Elder's face was fearless, and he responded with a mocking expression.</p>
