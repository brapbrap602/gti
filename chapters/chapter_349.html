Chapter 342: The Rules


Yun Youzi’s voice merely dropped a little before resuming its calm, nonchalant tone, much like when he spoke of the  Yan Huo Qing Lian in the ancient cultivator's relic.
Qin Sang admired his composure.
“Did the Xuanwen Heyun Dan not have any effect at all?”
Upon Yun Youzi's inquiry, Qin Sang meticulously detailed the changes after taking the Xuanwen Heyun Dan, leaving nothing out.
Then, he looked at Yun Youzi expectantly, awaiting his analysis.
Yun Youzi fell into deep thought.  After a long while, he finally said, “Qin Lao Di, one thing is certain: the Xuanwen Heyun Dan, and other foundation-repairing pills, are effective for you. If the Xuanwen Heyun Dan wasn't suitable, it wouldn't have restored half your injuries.  There's only one possibility: the Xuanwen Heyun Dan wasn't of high enough quality!”
Qin Sang nodded; he'd considered this. He quickly pressed, “Senior, do you know of any elixirs of higher quality than the Xuanwen Heyun Dan?”
Yun Youzi pondered, then shook his head.
“Difficult!
“The Taiyi Danzong doesn't lack formulas, and the Foundation Establishment masters' skills in alchemy are quite profound.
“But firstly, even skilled cooks can't make bricks without straw; the necessary spirit herbs are hard to gather, making it impossible even with the intention.
“Secondly, the Xuanwen Heyun Dan's quality already surpasses that of the Heyun Dan and Wu Zhi Shen Gao, placing it among the top-tier elixirs of its kind, especially since Qin Lao Di's pill was refined using a thousand-year-old Xuanwen Huangjing.
“Only rare celestial treasures, or the hope of divine pills emerging from some relic or secret realm, could surpass the Xuanwen Heyun Dan.
“Even if such pills appear occasionally, they are priceless treasures, impossible to buy with spirit stones.”
Seeing Qin Sang's disappointment, Yun Youzi softened his tone, comforting him, “Qin Lao Di, don't lose heart; it's far from hopeless.  There's always a way.  At least the Xuanwen Heyun Dan is effective for you. There's another method: taking several more such elixirs; perhaps a quantitative change can lead to a qualitative one, healing your injuries.”
This was the only solution Qin Sang could think of as well.
However, Heyun Dan wasn't easy to obtain; the first Xuanwen Heyun Dan only restored fifty percent of his injuries.  He didn't know how many more he would need.
Qin Sang took a deep breath. He’d anticipated this result before coming, so he quickly adjusted his attitude.
Yun Youzi was right; it was far from hopeless.
He must persevere and explore all avenues!
“Senior, have you heard any news about celestial treasures like Daojing Grass and Jiangyun Zi Guo?” Qin Sang asked.
One path: gather elixirs.
Another path: search for celestial treasures.
Qin Sang planned to pursue both, hoping for a breakthrough.
“Celestial treasures…”
Yun Youzi pondered for a moment, not answering directly. He changed the subject, asking, “Qin Lao Di, you also attended the auction a fortnight ago. Did you see the Ziwei Secret Map?”
Qin Sang was startled, surprised. “Senior, you came for the Ziwei Secret Map? You want to buy it?”
He was curious why Yun Youzi had suddenly emerged from seclusion and traveled all the way to Yinshan Pass.
The mysterious Golden Core cultivator who possessed the Ziwei Secret Map demanded a magic treasure in exchange.  Could it be that Yun Youzi was planning to agree to this condition?
Yun Youzi chuckled self-deprecatingly, waving his hand.
“Qin Lao Di, you don't know, this Ziwei Secret Map was the first one to appear publicly after the start of this Spiritual Tide, causing a huge stir.
“The number of Ziwei Secret Maps is limited.  In the next auction, countless Golden Core cultivators will be vying for them; the competition will be fierce.
“I heard the person holding the Ziwei Secret Map wants to exchange it for a magic treasure. Even if they don't get what they want, the price won't be low.
“I don't have the resources to compete in that auction, I'm just here to watch the fun.
“Of course, if I have the chance, I would indeed like to buy one.”
Qin Sang made a questioning sound. “Junior heard that the Ziwei Palace is extremely dangerous; even Golden Core cultivators can't guarantee their safety. Foundation Establishment cultivators who enter are almost certainly doomed. Senior, you also plan to go?”
Yun Youzi nodded.
“Qin Lao Di, didn't you just ask where to find celestial treasures?
“The most likely place to find them is Ziwei Palace!
“No other relics or secret realms in the Ancient Immortal Battlefield can compare to Ziwei Palace!
“Legend says Ziwei Palace was once a true immortal palace, falling from the heavens during the Great Immortal War, sinking into the deepest part of the Ancient Immortal Battlefield, only reappearing during Spiritual Tides.
“It contains countless treasures and, it is said, the secrets to breaking through to the Transformation God stage and beyond!
“The Transformation God path, tribulation-crossing treasures, immortal pills, and divine techniques – these can only be found in Ziwei Palace.
“Therefore, whenever Ziwei Palace appears, not only do Golden Core cultivators flock to it, but even Nascent Soul Ancestors rarely miss it.
“Over countless years, countless cultivators have only explored a tiny fraction of Ziwei Palace.”


The old Daoist, while aware of a few potential solutions, had also ventured out to prepare for the later search for spirit herbs.  However, he wasn't certain whether he could heal his soul injury. If the cure failed, even if it meant facing certain death, he would still try.

Qin Sang was secretly shocked. He could guess that the Purple Micro Palace was extraordinary, unlike other secret realms, and hadn't expected it to contain tribulation-crossing treasures and profound secrets of transcendence. No wonder it caused such a huge stir.

"So, the Purple Micro Secret is the key to the Purple Micro Palace?  Senior, is there really no other way to gain entry?" Qin Sang asked.

"No."  Yun Youzi shook his head.

"The Purple Micro Secret isn't exactly a key. It's more of a qualification, unrelated to the Purple Micro Palace itself. It's a long-standing rule.

"The Purple Micro Palace is located in the heart of the Ancient Immortal Battlefield, filled with spatial rifts. Moreover, the Purple Micro Palace appeared during the most violent surge of spiritual energy.

"Originally, only Yuan Ying cultivators and their Golden Core disciples could enter the Purple Micro Palace.

"Later, some Yuan Ying cultivators worried that after their deaths, their descendants would be unable to break through to the Yuan Ying stage and never have a chance to enter the Purple Micro Palace.  So, the rules of the Purple Micro Secret were established, and the situation changed.

"The Purple Micro Secret is a chance given to sects without Yuan Ying cultivators and independent cultivators.

"It is said that the Purple Micro Palace is sealed by a powerful Immortal Array. One must first set up a large array to open the Purple Micro Palace's array. After establishing the rules of the Purple Micro Secret, those who possess the Purple Micro Secret, regardless of their cultivation level, can enter the Purple Micro Palace under the protection of the array.

"Of course, very few people dare to challenge the Purple Micro Palace before reaching the Golden Core stage."

Qin Sang suddenly understood. "So that's how it is! So... can only one person obtain the qualification from a single Purple Micro Secret?"

"Correct."

Yun Youzi nodded. "If Qin Laodi wishes to find heavenly treasures and is willing to take risks, you might try to obtain a Purple Micro Secret. Then, consult the classics in various major sects; you might find records about the Purple Micro Palace and discover clues."
