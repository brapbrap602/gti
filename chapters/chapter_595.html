Chapter 588: Secrets of the Magical Treasure


This Soul Searching technique, undoubtedly a creation of the demonic sects, is incredibly malicious. It's unclear how Yun Youzi obtained it. 
Once cast, the soul is utterly shattered.
Even without cultivating ghostly or邪 arts, Yi Tiannie would have no chance of reincarnation.
This fiend caused him so much suffering and fear back then, Qin Sang naturally felt no pity. He watched coldly as Yi Tiannie's remnant soul struggled in his palm, displaying extreme agony, as if enduring the torments of the eighteen levels of hell.
Qin Sang's heart remained unmoved.
Yun Youzi then emerged from the Blood Restriction of the Demon King, his strength somewhat restored and no longer as weak.
The stone hall was now calm once more.
The Nine Nether Demon Fire returned to the Ten Yama Banners, which Qin Sang then put away.
The gurgling sound of flowing water echoed from the lake bottom as the underground river continuously replenished the dried-up lake, soon forming a shallow layer. It wouldn't take long for it to be completely full.
However, the sound of the flowing water was drowned out by the screams.
Qin Sang, having been in the world of cultivation for so long, had never heard such chilling screams. It was evident how terrifying the torment Yi Tiannie was enduring was.
Yun Youzi glanced at Qin Sang, whose gaze was as hard as iron, and sighed softly. "Brother Qin, rest assured, I swear on my heart demon that no third person will ever know of today's events. I won't ask about your past experiences, I only hope that even if you walk in darkness, you will keep a lamp lit in your heart and never succumb."
Qin Sang, his face wooden, looked up as if only just realizing what was happening. After a moment of hesitation, he nodded and said seriously, "I appreciate your guidance, senior."
At this moment, Yi Tiannie's screams abruptly ceased. The malice vanished from his face, replaced by relief. His remnant soul shattered with a 'boom'.
Yun Youzi suddenly reached out and touched Yi Tiannie's fragmented soul, gathering it together. Using his palm as a furnace, he refined it into a ball of pure soul power and handed it to Qin Sang.
"Don't let it go to waste. Let your Nightflyer Yaksha consume it. It might help it evolve."
Qin Sang took the soul power, somewhat skeptical. "Senior, the method I used to refine this Nightflyer Yaksha differs from the corpse refinement techniques of other sects. Once refined, its power cannot be further enhanced. I'm afraid it won't be very effective."
Yun Youzi smiled slightly.
"I knew your corpse refinement technique was unique.
"However, this time it's different. It wouldn't work for others, but Yi Tiannie is an exception.
"Have you noticed that Yi Tiannie seemed to intend to completely possess this corpse? He used some sort of ghost technique to actively merge his own soul with the Nightflyer Yaksha's primordial spirit. There's already a considerable connection between the two.
"Such an opportunity is rare and might break the limitations.
"Yi Tiannie's consciousness is gone, so you don't need to worry about the refined corpse being taken over again.
"This is the purest essence soul power of a late Core Formation realm expert. If your refined corpse can absorb it, it will undoubtedly gain immense benefits. It might even transform into a true Nightflyer Yaksha."
Qin Sang's eyes lit up.  What Yun Youzi said seemed plausible.
Apart from Yi Tiannie's self-inflicted demise, no one else would willingly merge with a refined corpse. Therefore, Qin Sang hadn't considered this possibility before.
It was worth a try.
Immediately, Qin Sang switched back to the Nightflyer Yaksha. After thoroughly inspecting it more than a dozen times to ensure its safety, he allowed the Nightflyer Yaksha to devour Yi Tiannie's refined soul power.
Initially, the Nightflyer Yaksha appeared unchanged and calm.
However, after a few breaths, its aura suddenly became chaotic. It clutched its head and roared incessantly. Qin Sang used all his power to soothe it, finally calming the Nightflyer Yaksha down.
But its primordial spirit remained unstable, seemingly undergoing intense internal changes, and it would likely take some time to settle.
During this period, the Nightflyer Yaksha's combat abilities would be lost.
"This is a good sign! It's likely evolving!"
Yun Youzi declared. Then, remembering something, he asked Qin Sang with some concern, "Brother Qin, why would you use corpse refinement techniques on yourself? Are there any lingering dangers?"
"Senior, I have five spiritual roots."
Qin Sang said this seemingly casually, then gave a bitter smile.
For cultivators with five spiritual roots, even reaching Foundation Establishment is a dream, let alone Core Formation.
If not driven to desperation, who would resort to the path of corpse refinement?  Even the Snow Spirit Lotus and Iris Flower had no effect.  Apart from this path, Qin Sang saw no other way forward.
"I was fortunate enough to find an opportunity for Core Formation through corpse refinement. The risks are manageable..."
Yun Youzi nodded. "That's good! Here, take the Crimson Cloud Purple Fruit."
Qin Sang accepted the Crimson Cloud Purple Fruit, feeling a surge of excitement and感慨. It had led to so many twists and turns, but the rewards were astonishing.
From the soul search, Qin Sang had confirmed the existence of the Three Light Jade Liquid within the Violet Mist Palace and ascertained its exact location. He could retrieve it now.
In addition, Qin Sang had taken the opportunity to glean more information, mainly about the use and refinement method of the Ten Yama Banners.
If he could obtain the refinement method and complete the set of ten banners, they would be able to rival top-grade magical treasures. How could Qin Sang not be tempted?
This was Grand Elder Kui Yin's prized magical treasure.  He would surely have passed down the refinement method after his death, but Qin Sang had searched through Qiu Pao's belongings without finding it.
He had assumed that with the deaths of the three Core Formation cultivators of the Kui Yin Sect, this secret technique would be lost forever. Unexpectedly, he obtained it from Yi Tiannie through a twist of fate.
Now, Qin Sang finally understood the secrets of the Ten Yama Banners.
The Ten Yama Banners were composed of three parts.
The first was the banner poles. The material was quite simple.
Qin Sang's initial guess was correct: it was the mysterious iron pillar, neither iron nor stone, found among Qiu Pao's belongings.
However, refining the mysterious iron pillar into banner poles was no easy task.
The mysterious iron pillar was a unique material, incredibly hard and containing peculiar restrictions.  A special spirit array was required, powered by high-grade spirit stones, to barely refine it.
No wonder Qiu Pao hadn't sold those four high-grade spirit stones even when facing death.
He had intended to use the mysterious iron pillar to refine his natal magical treasure after recovering from his injuries, and high-grade spirit stones were essential for that.
High-grade spirit stones were extremely rare. Selling them was easy, but finding more would be difficult, especially since the Kui Yin Sect was destroyed and Qiu Pao had become a stray dog, no different from a rogue cultivator.
The second part was the banner cloths, which were not refined from spirit materials. Instead, they were made by capturing countless living souls, condensing their purest soul essence, and weaving it into threads using a sinister ghost technique.
It was utterly ruthless.
For this magical treasure, Grand Elder Kui Yin had slaughtered countless people.
No wonder Qin Sang had been unable to repair the damaged banner cloths no matter how he tried.
Repairing them required living souls.
Fortunately, the damage to the two magical treasures wasn't extensive. The souls within the Ten Yama Banner artifacts he possessed were sufficient.
These artifacts had limited power and had become useless after he reached Core Formation. They could be used to repair the magical treasures.
