Chapter 101 Song Ying (Seeking Subscription!)


“Customer, this magical tool… I really can't repair it. I'm powerless.”
Qin Sang sat in the shop, sipping tea. After waiting for a long time, the shopkeeper emerged from the back room, holding the Dragon Sword, a look of helplessness on his face. His eyes kept darting back to the sword, clearly unwilling to give up.
Qin Sang wasn't surprised by this outcome.
He had consulted several crafting masters during this period, including one whose ancestor was said to have come from the great crafting sect, Void Spirit Sect. But without exception, the result was the same.
“Fellow Daoist, do you know where I can find a crafting master who can repair the Dragon Sword?”
The Ebony Sword took too long to prepare and could only be used as a last resort. He needed a handy magical tool for self-defense on a daily basis. Although the Green Wave Sword was usable, it was far inferior to the Dragon Sword.
Qin Sang entered the cultivation market, searching for the Song family while also looking for someone to repair the Dragon Sword. Unexpectedly, all the replies he received indicated it was beyond repair, which was strange.
The shopkeeper shook his head. "Customer, if I may be frank, the crafting technique used for this Dragon Sword is extremely unique. The restrictions on it are mysterious and unfathomable, not something ordinary people can comprehend. The person who crafted this sword is definitely a master. I've tried everything, but I can't even discern the material of the sword. Unless you can find a Foundation Establishment stage senior who is also proficient in restrictions and crafting, there might be a chance of repairing it. However, the cost…"
Qin Sang understood. If he could find such a crafting master, even if the Dragon Sword could be repaired, the cost would definitely be no less than buying a new top-grade magical tool.
“Thank you for your trouble, Fellow Daoist.”
Qin Sang reached out to take the Dragon Sword, but the shopkeeper was still reluctant to part with it. He gritted his teeth and said, "To be honest with you, customer, if this magical tool isn't repaired, it will completely break and be destroyed after a couple of uses. It's truly a pity. If you're willing, I'm willing to buy it for the price of a high-grade magical tool. What do you think?"
Qin Sang didn't hesitate and shook his head in refusal.
Many crafting masters were willing to offer a price for the Dragon Sword, and this shopkeeper was the most sincere. However, Qin Sang wasn't short of spirit stones and didn't want the Dragon Sword to fall into other hands.
Seeing the shopkeeper's lingering gaze on the Dragon Sword, Qin Sang, intending to build a connection, handed the sword back to him for further examination. The two sat down, sipped tea, and chatted pleasantly.
Qin Sang glanced at the 'Li Residence' opposite them and casually brought it up. “Fellow Daoist Wu, I remember when I came to Moonview Market a few years ago, the house opposite was the Song Residence. How did it become the Li Residence now? Did they sell their ancestral home?”
“It's been at least eight years. You have a good memory, Fellow Daoist Qin.”
The shopkeeper looked up, glanced at the Li Residence, and said disdainfully, “Nothing surprising. It's nothing more than seizing property and usurping inheritance. Mortals do it, and so do cultivators.”
Seeing Qin Sang's interest, the shopkeeper elaborated.
“The Song family was once prosperous, but unfortunately, their lineage was thin, and they gradually declined. However, even just this ancestral home made them better off than most rogue cultivators. I was acquainted with the former head of the family, but it was their family matter, and no matter how much I disapproved, I couldn't interfere.
The Song couple died early, leaving behind a son and a daughter. The boy, Song Hua, had decent talent and reached the fourth level of Qi Refining stage in his teens. The girl, Song Ying, had no spiritual roots and was a mortal.
As the saying goes, life is unpredictable. Over a decade ago, Song Hua went on a solitary journey, never to return. It was a hardship for the young girl, a mortal guarding such a fine residence, which had long been coveted by others.
When a cultivator is away, if there's no news for five years, it's generally assumed they're not coming back.
The children's great-aunt, originally from the Song family, married into the Li family. Using the pretext of being an elder, she took Song Ying in to care for her. I heard things were alright at first, but later their true colors showed. They forced Song Ying to marry at just fifteen, to a sickly man. And so, the Song Residence changed hands and became the Li Residence. I heard that later, the man Song Ying married died from his illness, and she was driven out by her in-laws. Her life is probably difficult now."
…
Qin Sang left the shop and went to the Moonview Market steward, paying spirit stones to rent a house. He cultivated while making inquiries.
Moonview Market was large, but finding a mortal wasn't difficult.
It only took Qin Sang a few days to find Song Ying and learn her life story. He hadn't heard of anyone from the Li family suddenly joining the Shaohua Mountain sect.
Six months after Song Hua's disappearance, their great-aunt took Song Ying to the Li family to raise her. For the first few years, they took good care of her, but after five years without any news from Song Hua, the Li family lost their patience.


It just so happened that a family acquainted with the Li family had a son afflicted by a strange illness, one that even cultivators couldn't cure.  The two families, after some deliberation, concocted a plan to marry Song Ying into that family, hoping her presence would bring good fortune and alleviate the son's condition.

Three days after Song Ying's marriage, her husband passed away.  She was promptly driven out by her in-laws, accused of being a jinx who brought misfortune to her husband.

As a commoner and a vulnerable woman, burdened with this malicious reputation, life in Moonview Market was difficult for her.

Song Huafeng possessed a refined and elegant demeanor, and Song Ying was also remarkably beautiful.  Fearing unwanted attention due to her appearance, Song Ying resigned herself to wearing a black veil at all times, dressing in coarse hemp clothing, and performing menial jobs to make ends meet.
……
"I'm leaving, Granny."

Song Ying gently closed the shop door.

A couple of coughs came from inside. "Be careful on your way."

Song Ying replied with a soft "Mm-hmm." She checked her veil, tightened her sleeves, and looked down at her feet as she walked down the street. She quietly bought some wine and food from a nearby shop and slowly made her way home along the wall.

The Li family hadn't completely abandoned her, providing Song Ying with a small courtyard as a form of appeasement.

Song Ying pushed open the courtyard gate, cautiously looked behind her, and firmly closed the gate.

"Miss, you're back."

An old man opened the door. His face was wrinkled, and he leaned on a cane, his steps unsteady.

Song Ying hurried to support the old man. "Uncle Zhou, the weather's getting cold. I bought some wine to warm you up."

Uncle Zhou tightly gripped Song Ying's hand, tears welling in his eyes. He sobbed, "I'm useless. I've let you suffer so much, Miss, and you still think of me... I can't face the old master, I can't face the young master anymore..."

Song Ying comforted Uncle Zhou with a few words and walked into the house.  Removing her veil, she revealed her delicate features. Looking at the empty house, a melancholic expression washed over her face.

"Brother, where are you..."
……
Qin Sang stood at the corner of the street, looking at Song Ying's small courtyard, a thoughtful expression on his face.

The Song family ancestor had sealed the Sword Intent Decree in the ancestral tomb. Retrieving it wouldn't be easy; it likely required the involvement of a Song family descendant.

The best course of action would be to help Song Ying reclaim her ancestral home and exact revenge.

However, the Li family wasn't to be trifled with.  They held considerable influence in Moonview Market, with at least two cultivators at the tenth level of Qi Refinement or higher. Qin Sang simply lacked the strength to confront them.

Just then, a slovenly young man whistled as he walked over, reeking of alcohol.  His eyes leered at Song Ying's courtyard.  At first glance, he looked like a common thug, but surprisingly, he was also a cultivator, albeit only at the second level of Qi Refinement.
