<h1>Chapter 288: The Lure</h1><p>Yu Kong let out a cold laugh, and without another word, a streak of red light shot out from his palm towards Elder Muteng. It was the same chain that had rescued Yan Wu, a top-grade magical tool.</p><p>The others, still unclear about the situation, didn't dare to interfere. They watched as Yu Kong attacked Elder Muteng.</p><p>The chain zipped through the air like a fiery line.</p><p>As the chain reached the middle of the air, another unexpected event occurred.</p><p>Just as it passed by Crescent Fairy, it abruptly changed direction and, with a burst of speed, wrapped around her like a viper.</p><p>Caught off guard, Crescent Fairy reacted too late. By the time she hastily activated her red silk threads for defense, the chain had already effortlessly swatted them away, binding her tightly.</p><p>Meanwhile, when Yu Kong made his move, Elder Muteng abandoned any lingering hope of a lucky escape. With a loud roar, he stomped his foot on the ground. Dozens of thick vines erupted from cracks in the stone, growing wildly and intertwining.  In the blink of an eye, a massive, thick wall of vines formed in front of him.</p><p>Elder Muteng himself used the force of the vines' growth to propel himself backward towards the cave entrance, hoping the wall would buy him enough time to escape.</p><p>However, just as he moved, a thin black sword appeared out of nowhere, silently and insidiously aimed directly at his chest.</p><p>Had he continued his retreat, the sword would undoubtedly have pierced his heart.</p><p>A warning flared in Elder Muteng's mind. He abruptly stopped, contorting his body into a grotesque angle to dodge the sword.  He then saw that the person wielding the sword was Yan Wu!</p><p>"You!" Elder Muteng roared, suddenly understanding.</p><p>Ever since they entered through the rainbow bridge, Yan Wu had remained silent, staying at the back of the group.  Everyone's attention had been drawn to the mysterious medicinal garden, and no one had paid attention to Yan Wu's inconspicuous behavior.</p><p>Now, with Yan Wu's sudden attack, everyone realized he was Yu Kong's man all along, positioned at the rear to cut off Elder Muteng's escape route!</p><p>Not only Elder Muteng, but Qin Sang's heart also sank.</p><p>If he had known Yan Wu was Yu Kong's accomplice, even if it meant enduring Yan Wu's mockery, he would never have used him to assert his dominance!</p><p>But now it was too late for regrets.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes flickered as thoughts raced through his mind.  However, he still didn't crush the Harmony Amulet, nor did he intervene to help Elder Muteng.</p><p>"You old fool..." A cruel smile played on Yan Wu's lips. "Get back there!"</p><p>*Slap!*</p><p>A yellow talisman floated out of Yan Wu's hand, bursting into a thin, hair-like lightning bolt in mid-air. The lightning was silent and aimed directly at Elder Muteng's face.</p><p>Though the lightning seemed delicate, it instilled a deep sense of dread in everyone present, not just Elder Muteng.</p><p>This talisman was clearly created with a highly advanced spell, containing a frightening destructive power!</p><p>Facing the lightning head-on, Elder Muteng had the clearest sense of its danger. Already off-balance from dodging the hidden sword, and now pressured by Yan Wu, he had no choice but to retreat if he wanted to survive.</p><p>There was no other option.</p><p>Naturally, Elder Muteng didn't want to die at Yan Wu's hands, but he feared the lightning even more.  He maintained his twisted posture, bending his upper body back as if broken in half, narrowly avoiding the lightning bolt.  Then, he transformed into a streak of green light, charging with all his might toward the exit.</p><p>Unfortunately, he was a step too late.  Yu Kong had already subdued Crescent Fairy. The chain, moving even faster than Elder Muteng, wrapped around him.</p><p>Yan Wu, not to be outdone, attacked with his elusive sword.</p><p>Caught between the two, and with Yu Kong's cultivation a full realm higher, Elder Muteng barely put up a fight before the chain pierced the back of his head, killing him instantly.</p><p>With a flick of his wrist, Yu Kong retracted the chain. Elder Muteng's body landed with a thud beside Crescent Fairy.</p><p>"Senior Yu, I didn't even know that old fool! Why did you attack me? Do you intend to kill us all?" Crescent Fairy cried out in terror, pleading her innocence.</p><p>As she spoke, she glanced at Qin Sang and the others, urging them to intervene before Yu Kong picked them off one by one.</p><p>――――――</p><p>“You’re quite the flirtatious one. I didn't expect that old scoundrel Luo Xingnan to send his mistress out as a spy.  Too bad I have no interest in you. Today is your last day.” Yu Kong’s gaze swept over the two captives, his tone chillingly indifferent.</p><p>Crescent Fairy gaped, speechless. After a moment, she gave up struggling. "You knew all along?"</p><p>Yu Kong gave a cold laugh and turned to Qin Sang, Shangguan Lifeng, and Wu Chen. "Don't be afraid, fellow Daoists. You saw what happened outside the cave. I have an old grudge with those two. They were spies sent by Luo Xingnan and Sheng Yuanzi. I deliberately let them in so I could settle the score. It has nothing to do with you three. When it comes to claiming the treasures, I will keep my promise."</p><p>Yan Wu, sword in hand, walked behind Yu Kong, acting like a dutiful bodyguard.</p><p>Shangguan Lifeng, arms crossed around his long saber, showed no emotion.</p><p>The surprise hadn't yet left Wu Chen’s face, but hearing Yu Kong's words, his anxiety eased somewhat.</p><p>Qin Sang lowered his head slightly, keenly aware of Yan Wu's gaze, filled with the amusement of a cat toying with a mouse, occasionally resting on him.</p><p>After reassuring the three, Yu Kong crouched down.</p><p>“You’ve already sent the message out, haven’t you?” A sinister smile appeared on Yu Kong's lips. Ignoring Crescent Fairy’s look of terror and fear, he channeled spiritual energy into his palm, striking her dead with a single blow. He then sealed the scent of blood from her corpse and began drawing on it with his spiritual energy.</p><p>Finally, the spiritual energy formed a strange pattern.  After flickering for a moment, the pattern faded. Yan Wu took out several talismans and stuck them to the corpses.</p><p>Qin Sang watched their actions silently, discerning Yu Kong's intentions.</p><p>Yu Kong had deliberately let the two spies in, allowing them to witness the process of opening the secret passage and spreading the news. His purpose was clearly to lure Luo Xingnan and Sheng Yuanzi.</p><p>Where did he get the confidence to deal with two opponents as strong as himself?</p><p>Qin Sang glanced toward the cave entrance. The key must lie ahead.</p><p>"Follow me."</p><p>After these preparations, Yu Kong meticulously erased the traces of the fight in the cave.  In truth, neither Elder Muteng nor Crescent Fairy had put up much of a resistance, so aside from a few withered vines, there wasn't much to clean up.</p><p>Then, Yu Kong transformed his spiritual energy into a large hand, lifting the two bodies and walking out of the cave.</p><p>Yan Wu, sword in hand, followed closely behind, casting vigilant glances around. The remaining three exchanged looks and quickly followed.</p>
