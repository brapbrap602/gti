<h1>Chapter 1166: Hukou Pass</h1><p>Chapter 1166: Hukou Pass</p><p>Tan Yi'en went to Changheng Island first.</p><p>Qin Sang and the two birds entered Tianyao Hill, then traveled north to Wanyao City.</p><p>…</p><p>Wanyao City.</p><p>One of the Seven Xiong Passes, the gateway for the demon race to enter and exit the Ancient Immortal Battlefield.  After the demon race occupied Tianyao Hill and controlled this pass, it has never changed hands.  The other passes have been more or less affected by human internal strife.</p><p>All demon cultivators entering and leaving the Ancient Immortal Battlefield must pass through Wanyao City.</p><p>The current lord of Wanyao City is the renowned Feather Demon King.</p><p>Wanyao City is quite different from Xianyao City.  Qin Sang wanted to see what a true demon city looked like, so he entered the city alone.  Fat Chicken and White Crane waited for a while before following.</p><p>Upon entering Wanyao City, Qin Sang's first impression was that it was very lively.</p><p>The city was still predominantly populated by humans.  The streets were bustling with people, yet orderly, presenting an image of a prosperous era.</p><p>These people had lived under the rule of the Demon King since birth, so they were completely unfazed by the demons strolling openly on the streets.</p><p>The demons allowed within the city were all highly intelligent, enlightened great demons.</p><p>The Feather Demon King had established strict rules, and Qin Sang didn't see any demons harming humans during his time in the city.</p><p>However, the cultivation world couldn't be all sweetness and light. Just as humans hunt demons, skinning them and using their bones for refining pills and weapons, the demons wouldn't just keep so many humans for nothing. Some things are best left unsaid.</p><p>Not long after entering the city…</p><p>Qin Sang was strolling through the city when a sudden commotion erupted, and the crowd parted.</p><p>A large, dark mass appeared ahead—a pack of armored demon wolves charging down the street.  The leader of the pack was enormous, emanating a terrifying aura of bloodlust.</p><p>However, it wore a finely crafted saddle, upon which sat a strange, small beast resembling a fox, but with unusually short forelegs—a wolf demon.</p><p>This demon radiated a stronger aura than Fat Chicken and White Crane, a late-stage Core Formation demon; otherwise, the demon wolf leader wouldn't have willingly served as its mount.</p><p>Qin Sang stopped, knowing he had been exposed.</p><p>Fat Chicken and White Crane flashed into action, positioning themselves in front of Qin Sang.</p><p>“Rumbling…”</p><p>The demon wolves, moving as one, clearly targeted Qin Sang's group. As they approached, they suddenly stopped, creating an immense pressure.</p><p>Qin Sang stood with his hands behind his back, his expression calm.</p><p>Fat Chicken and White Crane bristled, issuing a warning.</p><p>The wolf demon leaped from the demon wolf's back, stood upright before them, and bowed respectfully, saying, “May I ask if you are the young master of Qianshan Bamboo Sea, the Bright Moon Demon King? The King has prepared a palace for you, and I am ordered to receive you esteemed guests.”</p><p>As soon as these words were spoken, exclamations arose from the crowd, their gazes toward Qin Sang a mixture of awe and fear.</p><p>“Young Master?”</p><p>Qin Sang smiled knowingly.  This title wasn't bad. He nodded, gesturing for the wolf demon to lead the way.</p><p>Under the wolf demon's guidance, they proceeded to the Demon King's palace.</p><p>This was the demon's lair.  Qin Sang guessed that few other human Nascent Soul cultivators would dare to enter such a place so openly and alone.</p><p>“Which other Demon Kings are attending the meeting?”</p><p>The wolf demon replied, “Reporting to the senior, the Red-tailed Demon King arrived first, three days ago. Then came the Serpent King…”</p><p>After listening to the wolf demon's list, Qin Sang realized that nearly half of the Demon Kings from Tianyao Hill were present. The meeting was still three days away, and more Demon Kings would surely arrive.</p><p>He suspected that they were all attracted by news from Ziwei Palace, just as he was.</p><p>Three days passed quickly.</p><p>During this time, several Demon Kings, including Li Hong Demon King, came to visit. Qin Sang made a point of getting to know them.</p><p>One of them was the Red-tailed Demon King mentioned by the wolf demon.  He was a transformed red fox, a handsome young man with a striking red tail.</p><p>The Red-tailed Demon King got his name from this tail.</p><p>He claimed to have long admired the Bamboo Demon elder and was very enthusiastic toward Qin Sang. Qin Sang couldn't tell if it was genuine, but he played along, learning many secrets about the demon race from him.</p><p>Qin Sang left the two birds in the palace and went with the Red-tailed Demon King towards Feather King Palace.</p><p>Feather King Palace had always been the abode of the successive Feather Demon Kings, and this meeting would also be held there.</p><p>The Red-tailed Demon King dismissed the guide and, with Qin Sang,  headed towards the Feather King's Palace, familiar with the way.</p><p>"The Feather King is being secretive," he mused,  "but following precedent, mentioning the Purple Micro Palace usually means news.  Elder Bamboo hasn't appeared during previous openings of the Purple Micro Palace.  Sending Daoist Mingyue this time...could it be an attempt to secure a spot for the next entry?"  He casually pointed out the surrounding buildings to Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head slowly. "My master didn't mention the Purple Micro Palace. He sent me to inquire about the front lines."</p><p>The Red-tailed Demon King nodded, sighing. "If the Little Cold Domain and the Sky Travel Alliance lose to the Abyss of Sin, given their ruthlessness, our agreements with humanity will likely crumble, and peace will be a distant memory. But fully aiding them, and thereby crippling ourselves, would be incredibly foolish.  Finding the right balance is the true challenge.  But that's a headache for the Feather King…"</p><p>"Even so," Qin Sang countered, "we can't be indifferent. I don't want to hide in the Demon Sea and spend my days with icebergs."</p><p>He had been discreetly gauging the other Demon Kings’ attitudes. Unsurprisingly, the demon clan showed little interest in human affairs; the best approach was to sit back and watch, hedging bets on both sides to avoid antagonizing either.  But the Little Cold Domain and the Sky Travel Alliance weren't foolish; they wouldn't let the demons off the hook so easily.</p><p>While the Heavenly Demon Ridge had sent reinforcements, few Demon Kings had joined the battle.  Several were stationed at a place called Hukou Pass, supposedly a significant stronghold, though somewhat remote, making a major Abyss of Sin attack less likely. A small Abyss of Sin force was facing them there, engaging in what seemed like a mutually agreed-upon series of minor skirmishes.</p><p>As they walked, a vast forest appeared ahead.</p><p>"We're here! The Feather King's Palace is inside," the Red-tailed Demon King whispered.</p><p>Qin Sang looked closely, spotting an ancient wooden hall suspended in mid-air at the forest's heart.  A shimmering, ethereal light surrounded it, along with numerous powerful, intricate barriers.</p><p>"At last, you've arrived!"</p><p>Li Hong, the Li Hong Demon King, emerged from the trees to greet them, his previous designs on the Thousand Mountain Bamboo Sea forgotten. He was surprisingly warm towards Qin Sang. "Daoist Mingyue, the Feather King has heard you are Elder Bamboo's disciple. He's eager to meet the exceptional individual who received his teachings."</p><p>After pleasantries, the three entered the forest, reaching the Palace. Li Hong opened the door.</p><p>Qin Sang immediately saw a man in feathered robes seated in the center – the Feather Demon King, the same one who had used a magical artifact to open the Purple Micro Palace array!</p>
