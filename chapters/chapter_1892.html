<h1>Chapter 1883: The Celestial Star Array</h1><p>The Bestowal Hall seemed like a bottomless pit, the influx of Heaven and Earth Spiritual Qi showing no signs of stopping.</p><p>Inside the hall, Zhang Zhenjun was enveloped by a spiritual tide, an unending stream of Spiritual Qi pouring into his body, his aura surging dramatically.</p><p>At this moment, Zhang Zhenjun's cultivation was at the early stage of the River Chart Realm.</p><p>In truth, the realm he could truly reach was far beyond this, but he had been limited by the Zhongmao Prefecture Merit Seal.</p><p>According to the Dao Repository records, under normal circumstances, even if the Merit Seal hadn't reached great completion, the Merit of a single Prefecture should grow alongside the Merit Seal, with the improvement of cultivation actually aiding the refinement of the Merit Seal.</p><p>Beyond the River of Calamity, there was no need to consider the detrimental effects of the Six Heavens' Ancient Qi on cultivators, and even fewer restrictions.</p><p>The Merit Seal connected directly to the Divine Court and should have been an aid to the Dao Court's expansion, not a shackle.</p><p>The origins of the Dao Court's Twenty-Four Main Prefectures, along with the Sub-Prefectures, Auxiliary Prefectures, and Roaming Prefectures, all stemmed from True People with aspirations for expansion. They would first select a location with auspicious Feng Shui, establish a Prefecture Altar, then refine the Merit Seal, preach the Dao, and gradually strengthen their influence.</p><p>The Divine Court's dormancy and self-sealing within a realm had led to the Merit Seal's inability to be further refined.</p><p>Among the Four Prefectures, the Jushan Prefecture Merit Seal, the closest to great completion, was destroyed, Gangshan Prefecture was occupied by demons, and the cultivators of this realm couldn't escape the Six Heavens' Ancient Qi. This led to the embarrassing predicament unforeseen by the Dao Court's sages.</p><p>An incomplete Merit Seal had limitations in its protective abilities. The Seal Holder could choose to disperse the 'authority' or monopolize it.</p><p>If Zhang Zhenjun monopolized the Merit Seal, the Heavenly Hub Academy wouldn't have a single Grand True Person, but he could advance to the middle stage. The price would be the stagnation of the younger generation's cultivation, creating a generational gap.</p><p>He hadn't done so, nor had the previous Heavenly Hub Academy Minister, whose cultivation remained at the early stage of the River Chart Realm until the final Heavenly Tribulation approached. Then, he charged into the depths of the River of Calamity's origin, using his last vestiges of strength to pave the way for future generations, never to return.</p><p>Before his departure, he entrusted the Upper Clarity Heavenly Hub Academy Seal, the symbol of the Heavenly Hub Academy Minister, and the Zhongmao Prefecture Merit Seal to the successor he had chosen.</p><p>The True People of the Dao Court were like this, as were the Great Sages of the Ghostfang Kingdom.</p><p>Even though their cultivation had settled for many years, they could easily break through to the middle stage of the River Chart Realm and overcome the final Heavenly Tribulation. After all, those who could stand out from the Dao Court were all individuals of unparalleled talent.</p><p>Yet they still faced death with equanimity, ensuring the continuation of their lineage.</p><p>If nothing unexpected happened, Zhang Zhenjun might follow in the footsteps of the previous Heavenly Hub Academy Minister.</p><p>Until Tianyue Shangren arrived, finally bringing a turning point.</p><p>In the battle at the Jushan Prefecture Altar, Zuo Zhenren and the others seized the opportunity to sever their cultivation, and Zhang Zhenjun reclaimed the 'authority,' secretly beginning to elevate his cultivation.</p><p>Now, with the Divine Court restored and the Merit Seal gradually re-establishing its connection with the Divine Court, the limitations no longer existed!</p><p>Within the Bestowal Halls of Zhongmao Prefecture and Baishi Prefecture, the cultivation of the two Dao Court True People was rapidly increasing.</p><p>…</p><p>Within the Divine Court.</p><p>Qin Sang rode the Dragon Chariot, soaring through the clouds.</p><p>He had deciphered seven or eight parts of the talisman seal and was currently using its power to attempt to control the Heaven Patrolling Chariot.</p><p>The Golden Dragon continued its relentless flight, but the frequency of its tail swings had noticeably increased, its roars revealing a restless anxiety.</p><p>Qin Sang cleared his mind, his hands tightly gripping the jade handles of the throne, attempting to harmonize his mind with the chariot.</p><p>On the horizon, the pillars of Qi became increasingly prominent, churning the clouds into a frenzy. Some pillars weakened, dissipating with a bang, vanishing into nothingness, while others grew in momentum.</p><p>Judging by the signs, they would soon pierce through the sea of clouds and enter the Divine Court.</p><p>Within the Divine Court, the immortal halls and pavilions were deathly silent, with only the Dragon Chariot speeding through the clouds, making it extremely conspicuous.</p><p>The eyes within the pillars of Qi locked onto Qin Sang with intense malice; the time he had left was dwindling.</p><p>"Roar!"</p><p>The dragon's roar suddenly turned shrill, destabilizing the Heaven Patrolling Chariot and causing Qin Sang's body to sway.</p><p>The roars relentlessly assaulted Qin Sang's mind.</p><p>Qin Sang still didn't know what kind of existence the Golden Dragon was.</p><p>Was it a living being or a dead object?</p><p>Was it a dragon soul imprisoned within the chariot, the chariot's Artifact Spirit, or simply a part of the chariot itself, lacking true sentience and merely appearing animated?</p><p>The Heaven Patrolling Chariot surpassed Qin Sang's understanding of the Dao of Refining, and he had no time to carefully comprehend it at this moment, placing his hopes on the talisman seal.</p><p>The good news was that no matter how 'furious' the Golden Dragon's roars were, it didn't directly attack Qin Sang.</p><p>After a brief probe, Qin Sang no longer hesitated, channeling True Essence into his fingers and tracing the talisman seal in the air.</p><p>When the talisman seal was complete, he waved his hand, sending it towards the back of the Golden Dragon's head.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>The talisman seal transformed into a streak of light, piercing the scales on the back of the Golden Dragon's head and entering its body.</p><p>'Bang! Bang! Bang!'</p><p>The Golden Dragon suddenly began thrashing its head wildly, as if struggling against something.</p><p>Surprisingly, even in this state, the Golden Dragon continued to struggle forward.</p><p>Qin Sang was secretly astonished, his tense mind relaxing slightly.</p><p>The Golden Dragon's behavior appeared ferocious, but with the talisman seal embedded within it, its resistance towards Qin Sang was gradually weakening, showing signs of being initially controlled.</p><p>Qin Sang diverted a sliver of his attention, opening his eyes to scan the surroundings and observe the Divine Court's environment.</p><p>The scenery Qin Sang now saw was drastically different from when he first entered the Southern Heavenly Gate.</p><p>He only then noticed that the Divine Court wasn't as pristine as he had imagined.</p><p>What he saw from outside the Southern Heavenly Gate was a wonderland, but upon entering, he discovered many signs of ruin, including immortal mountains broken in half and pavilions collapsed into rubble.</p><p>Of course, there were also intact golden halls, their doors tightly shut, yet radiating spiritual light, illuminating the immortal mountains with a divine aura.</p><p>The Divine Court seemed to have experienced the ravages of war, with only a small portion remaining unscathed.</p><p>His gaze went past the chariot's shaft, looking towards the front, curious about what was attracting the Golden Dragon.</p><p>There, not only were clouds surging and dissipating, but strange lights also flickered, faintly revealing an immortal atmosphere, far surpassing the surrounding immortal mountains and golden halls.</p><p>Immortal mountains like forests, golden halls reaching the heavens, a myriad of wondrous sights.</p><p>This was the true Immortal Palace, the abode of the Heavenly Emperor!</p><p>If he wasn't mistaken, that should be the core of the entire Divine Court, but he didn't know what wonders it held.</p><p>Awe filled Qin Sang's eyes. Activating his Heavenly Eye divine ability, he discovered, to his dismay, that the core of the Divine Court was also heavily damaged, with broken bridges, shattered mountains, and ruins everywhere, even more severe than the outer areas.</p><p>"Eh?"</p><p>Qin Sang's expression shifted slightly, his gaze sweeping back and forth, taking in the immortal mountains and golden halls within his sight, a contemplative look on his face.</p><p>For some reason, the Divine Court gave him a sense of familiarity.</p><p>After pondering for a moment, Qin Sang finally identified the source of this familiarity—it was the layout of these immortal mountains and golden halls!</p><p>"It actually corresponds to the Celestial Star Array!  Could it be that the Dao Court modeled the Divine Court after the celestial stars?"</p><p>Qin Sang, having cultivated the Seven Constellations Sword Array, had some understanding of the celestial stars.</p><p>People divided the celestial stars into Three Enclosures, Four Symbols, and Twenty-Eight Constellations, believing them to be the abodes of immortals and imbuing them with extraordinary significance.</p><p>The Three Enclosures were the Purple Forbidden Enclosure, the Supreme Palace Enclosure, and the Heavenly Market Enclosure, the core star regions of the celestial realm.</p><p>The Twenty-Eight Constellations surrounded the Three Enclosures, divided into the Azure Dragon, Vermilion Bird, White Tiger, and Black Tortoise of the Four Symbols according to the four directions of east, south, west, and north, encompassing all the celestial stars.</p><p>The Seven Constellations Sword Array was modeled after the seven constellations of the Western White Tiger.</p><p>The Dao Court incorporated the celestial stars into the Divine Court, with each immortal mountain and golden hall representing a star.</p><p>Qin Sang's current location should be within the Southern Seven Constellations. According to the arrangement of the star palaces, those immortal mountains and palaces ahead were the locations of the Three Enclosures.</p><p>"But, what lies beyond the Three Enclosures?"</p><p>Qin Sang tilted his head slightly, his face filled with doubt.</p><p>At the center of the Three Enclosures, clouds piled up, resembling a heaven beyond heaven, layer upon layer of celestial palaces, seemingly endless.</p><p>It also resembled a towering immortal mountain, majestic and imposing, piercing through the clouds and reaching the very limits of the universe.</p><p>Faint rays of light and the flicker of lightning could be seen above the clouds.</p><p>Qin Sang strained his eyes, discerning the scene of the second heaven, and was immediately startled by what he saw.</p><p>It was utterly ruined, with only a handful of golden halls remaining.</p><p>Further up, it was the same!</p><p>Unbeknownst to Qin Sang, what he was currently seeing was the Nine Heavens established during the initial creation of the Divine Court, led by the Divine Firmament Sect, nine layers above and below, later known as the Thunder City.</p><p>After the second Divine Firmament Conference, the Dao Court revised the system, but the Nine Heavens weren't abandoned. Instead, they were connected to the new Divine Court, specifically for the Thunder Deities.</p><p>The new Divine Court emulated the Celestial Star Array, based on the Three Enclosures, Four Symbols, and Twenty-Eight Constellations, establishing Thirty-Two Heavens, anchoring the four directions and eight extremes, and enshrining deities other than the Thunder Deities.</p><p>In the end, the two Divine Courts became indistinguishable.</p><p>"What a magnificent Celestial Star Array!"</p><p>Qin Sang retracted his gaze from the Thunder City, continuously scanning his surroundings, secretly admiring it.</p><p>Clearly, the arrangement of the Divine Court wasn't a simple correspondence with the star positions but rather a profound and intricate formation.</p><p>He wondered if there was a connection between the Seven Constellations Sword Array and the Dao Court's Celestial Star Array.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't help but recall Sword Master Zhenren's evaluation of the Seven Constellations Sword Array, stating that gathering the Three Enclosures, Four Symbols, and Twenty-Eight Constellations would create a completely different spectacle.</p><p>If he had the opportunity to observe the Divine Court for a period, perhaps Qin Sang could truly use the Seven Constellations Sword Array as a foundation to construct a prototype of the Celestial Star Sword Array.</p><p>Unfortunately, the situation wouldn't allow him to do so.</p><p>"Roar!"</p><p>The Golden Dragon raised its head and roared, the reins around its neck suddenly tightening, its forward momentum coming to an abrupt halt.</p><p>The other end of the reins was gripped in Qin Sang's hand, pulling back with all his might.</p><p>The Golden Dragon was still unwilling to submit, shaking its head and thrashing its tail, but it ultimately couldn't break free from the reins.</p><p>Qin Sang let out a long breath, finally able to barely control the Heaven Patrolling Chariot.</p><p>Although he hadn't fully mastered it, he could now direct the Golden Dragon to change direction, preventing it from continuing its forward charge.</p><p>'Snap!'</p><p>Qin Sang flicked the reins. The Golden Dragon shook its head, seemingly reluctant, but didn't disobey. It swung its tail, changing direction and flying westward.</p><p>At this moment, pillars of Qi soared from the sea of clouds, demons approaching.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't know the demons' purpose in entering the Divine Court but guessed that their target was most likely the Three Enclosures region at the Divine Court's core.</p><p>He naturally wanted to avoid that area as much as possible, subconsciously choosing the Western Seven Constellations, which he was most familiar with, hoping to avoid any trouble.</p><p>However, judging by Tianyue Shangren's tone, the demons probably wouldn't let him off, so Qin Sang didn't dare to relax for even a moment, striving to control and familiarize himself with the Heaven Patrolling Chariot as quickly as possible.</p><p>…</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>White clouds surged like tidal waves.</p><p>Pillars of Qi continuously bombarded the sea of clouds. A deafening rumble shook the surrounding immortal mountains and palaces.</p><p>Among them, a black and a jade-green pillar of Qi were the first to undergo a transformation, suddenly expanding.</p><p>"Hahaha…"</p><p>Two shadowy figures emerged from within the pillars of Qi, bursting into the Divine Court amidst their maniacal laughter.</p><p>The laughter reached his ears, and Qin Sang felt his blood churn, looking over in alarm. Two terrifying demonic beast phantoms loomed on the horizon, immense in size, the Dharma Images of two Demon Kings!</p><p>The black phantom was covered in jet-black feathers, its giant wings spread wide, darkness engulfing half the sky.</p><p>Qin Sang found it very familiar. It was the same black demonic roc that had ambushed them outside the Jushan Prefecture Altar.</p><p>The other Demon King's Dharma Image was a jade-scaled serpent, its crimson tongue flicking in and out, its size only half that of the black demonic roc, yet its aura was no less formidable.</p><p>The ferocious demons stood against the sky, their demonic eyes looking down upon the Divine Court.</p><p>This scene clearly depicted the imminent occupation of the Immortal Palace by demons!</p><p>The black demonic roc's gaze, sharp as lightning, quickly swept across the surroundings, focusing on the Three Enclosures, before finally raising its head to look towards the Thunder City, making no attempt to hide its admiration and awe, exclaiming, "The Dao Repository speaks the truth; those old coots weren't bragging."</p><p>With that, the black demonic roc gently flapped its wings, a look of satisfaction on its face. "It seems the Demon God isn't a fabrication. We'll be even more at home within the Divine Court!"</p><p>The jade-scaled serpent's scales slightly parted, emitting a rustling sound, red and blue light flashing alternately, nodding its head in agreement.  It stared at the Thunder City for a moment before fixing its gaze on the Heaven Patrolling Chariot.</p><p>Its eyes were also red, its vertical pupils flashing with crimson light.</p><p>Qin Sang, seated on the chariot, his back to the two demons, still felt a chill run down his spine, a sense of dread creeping into his heart.</p><p>"That person must be riding the Dao Court's Heaven Patrolling Chariot. I wonder where he obtained it. If the Heaven Patrolling Chariot had always been in the Dao Court's possession, the Divine Court would have been opened long ago. This treasure has been lost for many years and has suddenly reappeared. This person must know many secrets! The Heaven Patrolling Chariot might also be of use to us. I'll go apprehend him; you go ahead and infiltrate the Divine Firmament Upper Palace… Old serpent, you know the location of the Divine Firmament Upper Palace, right?"</p><p>The black demonic roc also looked over, speaking rapidly.</p><p>The jade-scaled serpent's demonic eyes shifted, glancing coldly at the black demonic roc before looking up towards the Nine Heavens.</p><p>Its gaze penetrated the Nine Heavens, fixated on the peak of the Thunder City.</p><p>The Divine Firmament Upper Palace was located above the Nine Heavens.</p><p>The Dao Court's official ranks were divided into Order, Position, and Title. For example, Zhang Haichan, Zhang Zhenjun, held the position of Second Rank, Heavenly Hub Academy Minister, and Nine Heavens Golden Palace Grand Administrator.</p><p>The 'Nine Heavens Golden Palace' in the title of Nine Heavens Golden Palace Grand Administrator, in a narrow sense, referred to the Divine Firmament Upper Palace.</p><p>For the Dao Court, the Divine Firmament Upper Palace held great significance. It was the residence of the Celestial Master, and all Celestial Master decrees originated from there.</p><p>The three Divine Firmament Conferences had decided the fate of the Dao Court.</p><p>Moreover, the Divine Firmament Upper Palace was also the core of the Dao Court's Divine Court, containing the key secrets to controlling it.</p><p>The Great Sage's decree: Control the Divine Firmament Upper Palace at all costs!</p><p>"Alright!"</p><p>The jade-scaled serpent's voice was raspy, its tone as cold as its gaze.  It stared at the peak of the Thunder City, a contemplative look in its eyes.</p><p>"I'm off!"</p><p>The black demonic roc let out a maniacal laugh, flapping its wings powerfully. Demonic wind stirred up countless clouds, black feathers blotting out the sky as it hurtled towards Qin Sang.</p><p>The jade-scaled serpent was not to be outdone. Its serpentine body swayed, transforming into a streak of crimson light as it shot towards the Three Enclosures.</p><p>Following this, other pillars of Qi also showed signs of activity. Some were unable to escape annihilation, but most of the pillars that had persisted until now managed to stabilize themselves.</p><p>More and more demon gods entered the Divine Court.</p><p>The wonderland was about to become a realm of demons!
