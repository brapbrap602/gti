<h1>Chapter 656: Seven Killing Hall</h1><p>Coincidentally, the severed arm of this ancient corpse was its left arm!</p><p>This made Qin Sang think.</p><p>If this corpse was him, then where exactly was the Seven Killing Hall? Why was he transported here, falling from the sky, only to reappear in the Western Frontier, floating on the river?</p><p>Their master's name was Du Han.</p><p>The three people Qin Sang had searched the souls of, while all disciples of Du Han, were far less close to him than Du Xian.</p><p>Du Xian was Du Han's eldest disciple, extremely talented, with the potential to form a Golden Core. Du Han treated him like his own son, sharing some secrets with him. This search for the Thousand-Hand Spider Fruit was also to help Du Xian break through.</p><p>Du Xian's cultivation was at the False Core stage. Qin Sang had already decided to refine him into a corpse, so he didn't search his soul to avoid his soul scattering, instead questioning him before using the Soul-Stealing Incantation for verification.</p><p>After clarifying what Du Xian knew, Qin Sang was even more surprised.</p><p>He stood atop Five Insects Gate, looking around, somewhat bewildered.</p><p>According to Du Xian, the Seven Killing Hall was a secret realm discovered by humans, not located on the Witch God Continent, but in a place controlled by humans. It only opened once every many years.</p><p>Du Han had set off for the Seven Killing Hall two years ago, leaving the Witch God Continent, only returning recently.</p><p>Now, Qin Sang wasn't so sure anymore.</p><p>If the corpse in the Seven Killing Hall was him, why did it appear in the Western Frontier river, so far from the Witch God Continent? Was there some strange restriction within the Seven Killing Hall, or did someone bring him out?</p><p>Why was Du Han searching for the corpse in the Western Frontier?</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't understand.</p><p>He thought he'd clarify why the corpse was floating in the river, but instead found himself embroiled in a larger mystery.</p><p>Seven Killing Hall, Purple Micro Palace…</p><p>What connection did these two places have?</p><p>Du Xian knew nothing about what happened in the Seven Killing Hall.</p><p>After Du Han returned, he took them to the Western Frontier.  However, investigating the corpse was merely incidental; Du Han's main objective seemed to be searching for a certain spirit herb, so he went ahead.</p><p>Du Xian, with several junior brothers, came to Five Insects Gate to seize the Thousand-Hand Spider Fruit. The news about the fruit also came from Du Han.</p><p>It seemed that to understand the whole situation, he needed to find Du Han.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered inwardly. He learned from Du Xian and the others that after hearing the Golden Core cultivator had taken the Thousand-Hand Spider Fruit, they had sent a junior brother to summon Du Han. He should arrive within half a month.</p><p>He had plenty of time to prepare, setting an ambush to kill Du Han.</p><p>However, ambushing Du Han wouldn't be easy.</p><p>Du Han had been a Golden Core cultivator for decades. Although he hadn't yet broken through to the mid-Golden Core stage, he was already at the bottleneck, far surpassing ordinary early-Golden Core cultivators.</p><p>Furthermore, Witch cultivators couldn't be treated the same as human cultivators. Because of their natal insect gu, engaging a Witch cultivator could mean facing a two-on-one situation.</p><p>Qin Sang could easily deal with an early-Golden Core cultivator; he wasn't afraid of a mid-Golden Core expert, but to ensure the successful assassination of Du Han, careful planning was needed.</p><p>Moreover, Qin Sang preferred to capture Du Han alive to discover the truth.</p><p>To this end, Qin Sang was very careful when searching Du Han's soul, but Du Han was incredibly cautious and secretive.</p><p>Even his disciples didn't know what kind of spirit insect his natal insect gu was, only that he had a magic treasure, a reward from the Li Witch Palace after he formed his Golden Core, and that it was quite powerful.</p><p>…</p><p>Black Wind Valley.</p><p>Qin Sang revisited the place. As soon as he reached the poisonous spring, he smelled a faint fragrance.  This fragrance was a residue left behind when the Thousand-Hand Spider Fruit ripened; even after this long, it hadn't completely dissipated.</p><p>There had been no trace of this scent when Qin Sang was here before.</p><p>Reaching the bank of the poisonous spring, Qin Sang easily located the source, the spring's eye. The fragrance emanated outward, revealing the restriction around the spring's eye.</p><p>"Such an exquisite restriction. If the Thousand-Hand Spider Fruit hadn't ripened and exposed it, even if I stayed at the poisonous spring for a year, I wouldn't have discovered this anomaly."</p><p>Qin Sang sighed, trying several times before finding a way to break the restriction. He dashed into it.</p><p>Inside was a square underground chamber, obviously excavated by hand, very neat and clean. In the center of the chamber stood a small tree, half a person tall, with slender branches and leaves, and a green fruit hanging from it.</p><p>This was the Thousand-Hand Spider Fruit tree.</p><p>There were originally three Thousand-Hand Spider Fruits.  Master Uncle Cui Xuanzi discovered and took one.  He obtained the second one after it ripened. This was the third, and it hadn't yet matured.</p><p>The shape of the Thousand-Hand Spider Fruit is very peculiar, like two spiders tightly embracing each other. There are many fine lines on both sides, like countless spider legs intertwined.</p><p>Unripe Thousand-Hand Spider Fruits are green, turning purplish-black upon ripening, resembling poisonous spiders even more.  In fact, the Thousand-Hand Spider Fruit is a poisonous fruit, usable in various potent poisons, and even beneficial to poisonous insects. It's an extremely rare treasure.</p><p>Qin Sang entered the stone chamber, and the insect basket at her waist suddenly vibrated.</p><p>It was that fat silkworm again!</p><p>Qin Sang took out the fat silkworm and found it staring intently at the Thousand-Hand Spider Fruit, looking eager. The fruit seemed to hold great appeal for it.</p><p>This was the first time Qin Sang had seen the silkworm show interest in a spirit fruit other than the Fiery Gold-gilded one, after she had caught it.</p><p>The silkworm, having been disciplined by Qin Sang several times, had become more obedient.  Although craving the fruit, it dared not act rashly. Its small eyes looked at Qin Sang pitifully, on the verge of tears, emitting a sound of plea.</p><p>“This fruit isn't ripe yet. What use would it be to you?  Wasteful!”</p><p>Unmoved, Qin Sang activated the Nine Netherworld Demon Fire, warning the silkworm to behave.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the silkworm, desperate for the Thousand-Hand Spider Fruit, showed no fear of the Nine Netherworld Demon Fire.  It wriggled its fat body, stubbornly rubbing against Qin Sang's finger, begging insistently, as if even the unripe fruit would greatly benefit it.</p><p>Ignoring the silkworm, Qin Sang circled the Thousand-Hand Spider Fruit tree, carefully examining the chamber's restrictions.</p><p>Finally, Qin Sang shook her head. The restrictions were too intricate; she couldn't find a way to break them.  Since these restrictions couldn't even seal the fruit's aura, she couldn't think of a solution.</p><p>The third Thousand-Hand Spider Fruit would take another hundred years to ripen. Once ripe, its fragrant aroma would be impossible to conceal, unless she returned to guard it.</p><p>Qin Sang mused that after killing Du Han, she couldn't stay in the Western Regions.  In a hundred years, if she were still alive, she would at least be a mid-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator and might not even care about the value of the fruit anymore.</p><p>Furthermore, some sects use techniques similar to soul lamps on Foundation Establishment disciples. If the Li Witch Palace discovered Du Han's death, they would investigate this place.  With the Li Witch Palace dispatching experts to search, this chamber couldn't remain hidden.  It would be better to let the silkworm have it, than let the Li Witch Palace get their hands on it.</p><p>With this thought, Qin Sang released the silkworm, throwing it towards the fruit.</p><p>The silkworm, overjoyed, immediately started devouring the Thousand-Hand Spider Fruit.</p>
