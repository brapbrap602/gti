<h1>Chapter 587 Soul Searching</h1><p>Yi Tiannie's sneak attack failed. The reason he didn't leave immediately and dared to stay and threaten Qin Sang with the Crimson Cloud Purple Fruit was because he assumed Qin Sang's Corpse Pill was like the Flying Night Devil's.  </p><p>He controlled the Flying Night Devil and knew Qin Sang's details well, believing they were at least evenly matched. With his speed, he thought Qin Sang definitely couldn't stop him from escaping.</p><p>But Yi Tiannie never expected that this Corpse Pill was not like the other.</p><p>Qin Sang had formed his Core by harnessing the power of Yin and Yang, his strength was no less than that of a true Core Formation cultivator, while Yi Tiannie only controlled an artificially refined Flying Night Devil!</p><p>"You could be considered a formidable figure. If you had endured for a few more years, you might have actually succeeded."</p><p>The sea of fire parted, and Qin Sang emerged from the demonic flames, his eyes icy as he stared at Yi Tiannie.  He said coldly, "This place is quite scenic, a fitting place for your burial!"</p><p>‘Crash!’</p><p>The Ten Yama Banners vibrated repeatedly, emitting bursts of demonic sounds.</p><p>The ghostly wind became more urgent, with a mournful wail.</p><p>The stone hall was pitch black, nothing could be seen with the naked eye. Qin Sang stood beside the Ten Yama Banners, wielding the demonic banners. Demonic fire danced wildly around him, like a demon reborn from fire.</p><p>The Nine Nether Demonic Fire did not have a scorching temperature, but instead made the stone hall extremely cold. This chill seemed to penetrate the heart, causing involuntary trembling.</p><p>The flames were pitch black, as if coming from the Nine Nether, capable of swallowing all light and bringing immense pressure. Yi Tiannie, surrounded by the flames, felt a pang of fear.</p><p>The stones in the stone hall creaked, but a faint fluorescence flowed within them, keeping them sturdy and able to withstand the impact of the Nine Nether Demonic Fire.</p><p>Protected by the Demon King's blood restriction, even with their combined might, neither Qin Sang nor Yi Tiannie could shatter the stone walls here. They could fight without restraint.</p><p>The expression on Yi Tiannie's face froze, becoming extremely ugly.</p><p>When Old Ancestor Kuiyin passed away and bestowed the Ten Yama Banners to his disciples, he had taken control of this treasure and knew it intimately.</p><p>If Qin Sang had formed a normal Corpse Pill, it wouldn't be so terrifying, but now it was different.</p><p>Demonic flames soared to the heavens.</p><p>A flash of cyan light appeared on Yi Tiannie's chest, and his figure suddenly vanished.</p><p>Qin Sang narrowed his eyes slightly. He knew this wasn't Yi Tiannie's concealment technique, but an illusion caused by his extreme speed.</p><p>The Flying Night Devil was adept at escape techniques, appearing and disappearing unpredictably. Yi Tiannie used some unknown ghostly secret technique, making his speed even faster and incredibly agile.</p><p>He spread out the Nine Nether Demonic Fire precisely to guard against this move by Yi Tiannie.</p><p>The moment Yi Tiannie moved, he inevitably touched the Nine Nether Demonic Fire. Qin Sang easily captured Yi Tiannie's trajectory. With a flick of his finger, the surrounding demonic flames immediately surged towards Yi Tiannie's front, blocking his path.</p><p>For a time, chaos filled the stone hall.</p><p>Accompanied by booming collisions, Yi Tiannie's figure flitted like a ghost, sometimes on the left, sometimes on the right, trying every possible way to break through the demonic fire.</p><p>The Nine Nether Demonic Fire sometimes condensed into a ball, sometimes scattered in all directions.</p><p>Its changes were unpredictable yet orderly, controlled by Qin Sang's thoughts.</p><p>Even when enduring Yi Tiannie's heavy blows, the Nine Nether Demonic Fire could quickly re-condense, blocking his path and forcing him back, leaving no gaps.</p><p>Although there was a difference in their strength, killing Yi Tiannie wouldn't be accomplished in a short time.</p><p>Being too impatient might expose weaknesses, allowing Yi Tiannie to escape.</p><p>However, Qin Sang didn't intend to kill Yi Tiannie this way, not even to injure him for now. Instead, he focused on manipulating the Ten Yama Banners, blocking all exits, and firmly trapping him!</p><p>Precisely because of Qin Sang's steady approach, no matter how much Yi Tiannie struggled, he couldn't find a chance to escape.</p><p>At the same time, Qin Sang was also connecting with the soul imprint within the Flying Night Devil, attempting to break through Yi Tiannie's blockade and awaken the soul imprint.</p><p>Yi Tiannie himself only had a remnant soul. Before his soul recovered, he had to rely on the Flying Night Devil's body to possess powerful strength.</p><p>If Qin Sang could regain control of the Flying Night Devil, it would cut off the root of Yi Tiannie's power, turning him into a rootless wandering soul, a lonely ghost at his mercy.</p><p>Even if he couldn't completely recapture the Flying Night Devil, he could create chaos and weaken Yi Tiannie's strength.</p><p>Yi Tiannie quickly realized Qin Sang's intentions and felt despair. He roared furiously, disregarding everything as he frantically attacked the Nine Nether Demonic Fire.</p><p>But all of this was destined to be futile. He had missed his only chance to escape, cutting off his own retreat and becoming a trapped beast.</p><p>Yi Tiannie, hopeless for escape, attempted to attack Qin Sang who held the banners, but it was also in vain.</p><p>On the other hand, Qin Sang's expression became increasingly calm. He had already sensed the soul imprint, growing clearer, while Yi Tiannie's speed was gradually slowing down, clearly affected.</p><p>Finally, Qin Sang reawakened the soul imprint.</p><p>Unexpectedly, just as Qin Sang was about to seize the Flying Night Devil's body, Yi Tiannie actually gave up struggling, and the Flying Night Devil froze in place.</p><p>Yi Tiannie seemed to have vanished.</p><p>Qin Sang felt puzzled. With a thought, he continued to urge all the Nine Nether Demonic Fire towards the Flying Night Devil.</p><p>At this moment, a dazzling cyan light suddenly burst from the Flying Night Devil's chest, erupting with an unusually powerful pressure that shot out from his chest.</p><p>This cyan light forcibly broke through layers of flames, but still failed to open an escape route before its power waned and extinguished completely, leaving nothing behind.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression changed slightly. Just as he was about to go over and check, he suddenly felt something was amiss. He abruptly looked down at the bottom of the lake and indeed found something unusual.</p><p>Immediately after, a clear sword cry suddenly rang out from Qin Sang's forehead.</p><p>The next moment, the Ebony Sword appeared at the bottom of the lake.</p><p>Sword Qi erupted as the Ebony Sword pierced the lake bottom.</p><p>A crisp 'clang' rang out.  From the seemingly empty lake bottom, a crescent-shaped jade was struck out of thin air by the Ebony Sword.</p><p>Inside the jade was Yi Tiannie's soul, looking at Qin Sang with resentment.</p><p>In this desperate situation, Yi Tiannie was actually able to use a deceptive tactic, detonating all his soul power and hiding in the jade, attempting to slip through the cracks.</p><p>What tenacious will to survive!</p><p>Qin Sang felt a sense of admiration, but his actions were merciless.</p><p>Sword Qi enveloped the jade, leaving Yi Tiannie powerless to resist.</p><p>But the moment the Sword Qi enveloped the jade, a crack appeared on Yi Tiannie's soul, and his aura rapidly dissipated.</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang flashed forward and grabbed the jade.</p><p>Yi Tiannie wanted to commit suicide, but Qin Sang wouldn't let him off so easily. He still needed to interrogate him about the Three Lights Jade Liquid.</p><p>Just as Qin Sang was about to activate the *Soul Snatching Incantation*, he suddenly heard Cloud Traveler's voice transmission, "His soul is about to dissipate, use the Soul Searching Technique!"</p><p>Then, a Soul Searching Technique appeared in Qin Sang's mind.</p><p>This Soul Searching Technique was incredibly profound, far surpassing the several Soul Searching Techniques Qin Sang had obtained before.</p><p>Qin Sang knew that this was a race against time. The *Soul Snatching Incantation* was indeed less effective than the Soul Searching Technique. He immediately changed his mind, swiftly completed the incantation, and strange black Qi emerged from his fingertips as he grabbed at Yi Tiannie's remnant soul.</p>
