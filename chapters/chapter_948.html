<h1>Chapter 940: Refining the Soul-Summoning Banner</h1><p>Qin Sang stared intently at the Soul Nourishing Wood.</p><p>The wood was entirely jet black, riddled with holes, resembling a piece of decayed wood ravaged by insects.</p><p>This appearance matched the descriptions Qin Sang had previously encountered in ancient texts.</p><p>A faint, ethereal green light shimmered on the wood's surface.  Even a glance seemed to soothe the soul, a testament to the Soul Nourishing Wood's unique aura.</p><p>“So large!”</p><p>Qin Sang's heart leaped with joy and astonishment.</p><p>The sliver of Infernal Bloodwood he'd obtained from the Thunder Swallowing Falcon's nest had elevated his magical tool to the rank of a true treasure. If he could refine this Soul Nourishing Wood, to what extent could his Ebony Sword be enhanced?</p><p>Could it directly ascend to the level of a spiritual treasure?</p><p>Such a large piece of Soul Nourishing Wood could surely resist the corrosive properties of the Infernal Bloodwood.</p><p>On second thought, it made sense. If the Soul Nourishing Wood were too small, its aura wouldn't be potent enough to sustain Bai's remnant soul for so long.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at Bai, wondering if he would be so honest as to relinquish all the wood.</p><p>Even if Bai concealed some, he wouldn't pursue it.</p><p>He knew better than to be greedy.</p><p>This amount of Soul Nourishing Wood was sufficient to elevate his Ebony Sword to unimaginable heights, enough to dominate the current cultivation world. More importantly, his cultivation would no longer be restricted, which was already a tremendous boon.</p><p>There was no need to push further.</p><p>If he cornered Bai, he might destroy the Soul Nourishing Wood in a desperate act of mutual destruction.</p><p>Bai had been observing Qin Sang's expression.  When their eyes met, Bai's heart tightened, but he saw no change in Qin Sang's demeanor.</p><p>Looking deeply at Qin Sang, Bai raised the Soul Nourishing Wood. "Fellow Daoist, you can see the wood's aura is genuine. Of course, I cannot give you all of this Soul Nourishing Wood. I must retain a portion for my own cultivation."</p><p>After a pause, Bai pointed to the middle of the wood, indicating his intention to divide it equally.</p><p>After some haggling, Bai declared his bottom line was to keep at least a quarter.</p><p>Qin Sang considered this and slowly nodded. "As you say! But I've heard that Soul Nourishing Wood is unique compared to other spiritual woods. It cannot be crudely severed, but handled with care, lest its power be diminished…"</p><p>Bai said confidently, "Rest assured, Fellow Daoist. I've been with this piece of Soul Nourishing Wood day and night and know it intimately.  While it's fragile compared to the Ten Great Divine Woods, with sufficient care, there will be no damage. Since you agree, I will divide it now…"</p><p>Bai placed his other hand above the wood. Corpse Qi surged from both palms, forming intricate runes that twisted and transformed into a blade, thin as a cicada's wing.</p><p>The blade trembled slightly, landed where Bai had pointed, and began to cut downwards.</p><p>The Qi blade seemed to flow, silently tracing the wood's grain, gradually separating it.</p><p>Bai's movements were meticulous, and even Qin Sang, observing from the side, felt a twinge of nervousness.</p><p>After a while, the Soul Nourishing Wood was successfully divided into two pieces.</p><p>At the moment of success, both men breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p>"After we leave the Ghost Lands, this piece is yours, Fellow Daoist. If you don't trust me, you can place restrictions on it now," Bai said with a faint smile.</p><p>Qin Sang readily applied several restrictions, sealing the wood.</p><p>Unfazed, Bai stored his portion and spoke with a touch of urgency, "We've wasted considerable time negotiating. Since this secret realm is open for a limited time, let's get started! I don't want to stay here a moment longer!"</p><p>"I wouldn't say it was wasted. This way, we can trust and cooperate effectively," Qin Sang chuckled. He retrieved the banner pole and said, "Go and summon the lost souls. I'll begin refining the Soul Threads. Once the banner is complete, we can collect the Demonic Fire."</p><p>"Alright, I'll awaken the souls. I'll leave the rest to you, Fellow Daoist."</p><p>Bai's figure flickered and vanished into the ghostly mist.</p><p>Soon, mournful cries echoed from the depths of the mist, followed by a turbulent swirling. Countless shadowy figures emerged, creating a terrifying spectacle.</p><p>Qin Sang sat cross-legged on the bone mountain, holding the banner pole and gently shaking it.</p><p>When Bai led the lost souls back, they exchanged a glance. Bai waved his hand, manipulating the mist to restrain the souls, allowing Qin Sang to focus on extracting their Soul Qi.</p><p>Qin Sang silently activated his secret technique, flicking his fingers to send runes towards the first row of souls.</p><p>The souls stirred restlessly.</p><p>Bai's face darkened. With a low shout, the mist pressed down, heavy as a mountain, forcing the souls to remain still as Qin Sang worked.</p><p>As the technique completed, threads of pure Soul Qi drifted from the souls, converging towards Qin Sang.</p><p>Drained of this portion of their essence, the souls appeared weakened, but their fate was far better than complete annihilation.</p><p>Qin Sang gathered the Soul Qi and focused on refining the Soul Threads.</p><p>The Two-Headed Vulture stood guard on either side.</p><p>Bai glanced at Qin Sang and returned to the mist to summon more souls.</p><p>While this process was more cumbersome, it freed Qin Sang from having to suppress the souls, maintaining a decent pace.  Soon, a long Soul Thread materialized in Qin Sang's hand.</p><p>He signaled Bai to stop and then picked up the banner pole, beginning to craft the Demonic Banner.</p><p>This being his first attempt, Qin Sang was initially clumsy, but after a few failures, he gained proficiency. The Soul Thread intertwined with the pole, merging as one.  The rudimentary form of a Demonic Banner slowly took shape.</p><p>The most challenging aspect of the Ten Yama Banners was dividing the Profound Iron Pillar to create the banner poles.</p><p>Coupled with Qin Sang's improved refining skills, crafting the banner cloth was far easier. He successfully completed the first banner.</p><p>Qin Sang swung it forcefully. The banner fluttered, but no unusual phenomena occurred.</p><p>It would become a complete magical treasure only after absorbing the Nine Nether Demonic Fire.</p><p>Bai watched from the periphery, curiously examining the banner in Qin Sang's hand. He saw Qin Sang retrieve another pole and immediately set off to gather more souls.</p><p>Bai made countless trips, and eventually, eight black banners lay across Qin Sang's knees.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist, how many banners do you intend to refine?" Bai asked, breathless.</p><p>Manipulating the mist and restraining the souls was taxing. He was growing weary, though thankfully, the environment of the Ghost Lands helped him endure.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced up, a slight smile playing on his lips. "Seven more poles to go.  Should be enough to help you break the demonic restriction, right?"</p><p>"More than enough!" Bai gritted his teeth, then added with surprise, "Fifteen banners, plus the three you already have, makes eighteen!  There's a subtle connection between them, forming an array. The more banners, the greater the array's power. With eighteen banners, Fellow Daoist, you could even challenge a Nascent Soul cultivator."</p>
