<h1>Chapter 1996: Confrontation</h1><p>“His bloodline is too diluted to awaken the bloodline abilities of the Suzaku clan. In ancient times, he wouldn’t have been recognized as a descendant.”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded.</p><p>He had learned about some of the rules of the demon clan during his conversations with Yuan Zhu.</p><p>Without Suzaku bloodline, it’s difficult to obtain Suzaku true feathers through normal means.</p><p>The magic banner can suppress the Nine Netherworld Demon Fire, but he hasn't subdued the Nanming Li Fire.</p><p>Using the *Fire Seed Golden Lotus* to draw the Nanming Li Fire into his body to condense lotus seeds is akin to self-immolation.</p><p>Furthermore, his use of demon fire to condense lotus seeds on Yitian Peak was a forced measure under duress. He hasn't carefully studied the *Fire Seed Golden Lotus* and dares not act rashly.</p><p>“The Xuan Tie pillar can restrain the Nine Netherworld Demon Fire.  Ancestor Kui Yin used the Xuan Tie pillar as the base to refine the magic banner and collect the demon fire.  The Green Copper piece can also restrain the Nanming Li Fire; it should still be with Yun Youzi.  Could a similar method be used to forcibly take the Nanming Li Fire and the Suzaku true feathers?”</p><p>Qin Sang's thoughts raced, feeling his knowledge of the art of refining was too weak, and he had no immediate solution.</p><p>After a short stay at Sword Scar Mountain, Qin Sang retreated back down the mountain.</p><p>It wasn’t yet time for the Ziwei Palace to close.</p><p>However, Qin Sang’s cultivation was low back then, and he couldn't sense the secrets within Ziwei Palace. He didn't understand the place and didn't have enough time to explore it thoroughly.</p><p>Staying longer would yield little. Qin Sang decided to leave Ziwei Palace immediately.</p><p>The way back was not peaceful; some parts of the outer hall were even more dangerous than the inner hall.</p><p>Like the Seven Killing Hall, Ziwei Palace is also divided into inner and outer sections, connected only by a path of trials. Last time, Dongyang Bo led them into the inner hall via this path.</p><p>At the end of the path of trials, there was originally a stone tower.</p><p>However, the latter half of the path of trials was damaged, preventing anyone from reaching the tower. The moment they entered the inner hall, they were scattered by the chaotic forces in the clouds, landing in different parts of the inner hall.</p><p>The way out is simple.</p><p>Find the tower; entering the tower will teleport you to the entrance of the path of trials, in front of the Bagua jade disc.</p><p>Qin Sang had already put on his mask and swiftly moved towards the edge of the inner hall.</p><p>Bai accompanied him.</p><p>Passing the immortal city annihilated by the palm print and various immortal realms, Bai’s gaze was captivated, remaining silent.</p><p>Soon, they reached the edge and saw countless fragments of land outside.</p><p>Qin Sang continued to fly outward, crossing one land fragment after another. As he neared the cloud sea, an unexpected sight met his eyes, causing his expression to change.</p><p>When he was here last, the entire inner hall of Ziwei Palace was shrouded in the cloud sea.</p><p>The scene now was different. Directly in front of Qin Sang, where the tower was located – the closest point to the immortal restriction of Ziwei Palace's inner hall – the cloud sea was torn apart!</p><p>In the vast cloud sea, numerous fissures were clearly visible.</p><p>The clouds could not condense there; clouds continuously gathered only to dissipate through the fissures.</p><p>The existence of fissures in the cloud sea only meant one thing: the immortal restriction of Ziwei Palace’s inner hall had developed a flaw!</p><p>“Is it because the power of the immortal restriction is waning, unable to maintain the integrity of the cloud sea, or has something happened in Ziwei Palace, damaging the restriction?”</p><p>Standing on a fragment of land, Qin Sang gazed at the immortal restriction, frowning in thought.</p><p>After he had teleported away, something else must have happened in Ziwei Palace.</p><p>Being a newcomer, he knew nothing. After pondering for a moment, he made Bai enter the Corpse Puppet Bag, concealed himself, and cautiously approached the cloud sea.</p><p>Though the fissures in the immortal restriction served as passages in and out, for safety’s sake, using the stone platform to leave was still the safest.</p><p>The tower was in the cloud sea, its surface runes flashing, protected by a powerful ancient restriction.</p><p>He found the tower without any difficulty.</p><p>At that moment, Qin Sang noticed something at the end of one fissure that froze him in place.</p><p>The thin clouds in the fissure could not obscure the grim aura at its end.</p><p>Using his Celestial Eye ability, he could see the outline of a huge cave.</p><p>Qin Sang remembered that at the entrance of the path of trials, in front of the Bagua jade disc, there was a huge demonic cave hundreds of meters in diameter, bottomless.</p><p>The cave was filled with demonic qi, emitting a piercing chill, as if connected to the underworld.</p><p>Once, a Nascent Soul expert risked their life by jumping into the demonic cave, but even until the closing of Ziwei Palace, no one had explored what lay at the end.</p><p>If Qin Sang wasn't mistaken, the cave at the edge of the cloud sea was the Demon Cave!</p><p>At that moment, towering flags, several dozen feet high, stood at the edge of the Demon Cave, forming a large array.  Black mist billowed, shrouding nearly half the cave.</p><p>Within the black mist, figures seemed to appear.</p><p>He was certain that last time, there was definitely no array around the Demon Cave!</p><p>"Why are these people setting up an array at the edge of the Demon Cave instead of entering the inner hall?"</p><p>Qin Sang stared at the Demon Cave, various thoughts flashing through his mind.  Seeing the array and the figures within, he felt an intense sense of danger.  If he rashly teleported there, he would be caught in the middle; the consequences were obvious.</p><p>"Look at that fissure over there."</p><p>Bai transmitted his voice.</p><p>Qin Sang shifted his gaze, looking at another fissure.  He was surprised to discover that there was also an array there, seemingly not far from the Demon Cave, with two groups of cultivators facing off against each other!</p><p>"Have the Xiaohan Domain and the Tianxing League clashed again? Or..."</p><p>Qin Sang recalled the scene of being ambushed by the Abyss of Sin, "Could it be related to the Abyss of Sin?"</p><p>"We can't go through the stone tower. Let's leave from somewhere else!"</p><p>Qin Sang made a decision.  He had to try the cloud sea fissures.</p><p>No matter who those people were, he didn't want to get involved. He would rather risk taking a detour.</p><p>Fortunately, there were many fissures in the cloud sea.</p><p>Qin Sang carefully retreated, flying around the cloud sea for a while. He found a fissure far from the stone tower, its end a considerable distance from the Demon Cave.</p><p>After observing for a long time and testing several times, Qin Sang confirmed that the other side of this fissure was safe. He activated the Sky Demon Transformation, summoned his ebony sword and other treasures, and darted into the fissure.</p><p>Although the cloud sea was torn apart, the power of the celestial prohibitions still remained within the fissure, chaotic and turbulent.  Fortunately, it didn't exceed Qin Sang's tolerance.</p><p>He endured the impact of the remaining celestial prohibition's waves, using all his strength to activate his protective treasures.  He made it through the prohibition without incident and landed on the ground.</p><p>Standing there, he could vaguely see the rolling black mist from the direction of the Demon Cave.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't dare linger. He immediately fled into the shadows, putting distance between himself and the area, and after confirming that no one was following him, stopped on a black mountain.</p><p>He glanced back at the Demon Cave once before heading straight for the outer hall exit.</p><p>Whatever was about to happen had nothing to do with him.</p><p>He was on his way back.</p><p>Familiar scenes evoked various memories in Qin Sang.</p><p>He hadn't felt it much when Dongyang Bo was with him, but traveling alone in the outer hall, he realized that the place truly lived up to its reputation—danger lurked everywhere.</p><p>Even with his strength, he had to be vigilant.</p><p>After passing several dangerous places, Qin Sang saw from afar a miasma of blood煞 energy, and the outline of an altar within that miasma.</p><p>He didn't stop but continued to fly forward.  Ghostly mist filled the air ahead – the Immortal Graveyard!</p>
