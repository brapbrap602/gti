<h1>Chapter 1969 Intervention</h1><p>The Emperor is gravely ill.</p><p>All factions are focused on the succession struggle.</p><p>Yet, the turning point comes from an unexpected source.</p><p>‘Crash!’</p><p>Yu Lang’s hand trembled, sending his teacup shattering on the floor.</p><p>Ignoring the spilled tea, Yu Lang stared intently at the names on the urgent report.</p><p>Qi Prefecture, Ci Zhen Prefecture, Zhong Ning Prefecture…</p><p>All were prefectural cities in Luzhou, the target of the Da Liang attack!</p><p>And the prefect of Zhong Ning Prefecture in Luzhou is Chen Zhenqing, Master Chen!</p><p>The mortal world is not the cultivation world.  There are no communication talismans or spells here.  News travels slowly. Da Liang’s invasion left several prefectures isolated almost instantly. By the time the news reached the capital, days had passed. No one knows if Luzhou’s troops can withstand this surprise attack, or what the situation in the cities is now!</p><p>Four of Yan’s states border Da Liang.</p><p>While Luzhou has seen its share of wars, its strategic importance is not paramount.  Logically, Luzhou wouldn’t be Da Liang’s first target.</p><p>Consequently, Yan’s military deployment in Luzhou is not the strongest.</p><p>The Crown Prince is not the Emperor. Interfering with military matters is taboo. Yu Lang can only secretly work to reinforce Zhong Ning Prefecture with additional guards.</p><p>Da Liang’s sudden attack on Luzhou showed no prior signs. Yu Lang, with his proximity to the court, received no intelligence. The attack’s secrecy is evident.</p><p>Caught completely off guard, how long can Luzhou hold out?</p><p>How long can Zhong Ning Prefecture hold out?!</p><p>‘Creak!’</p><p>A woman in a pale yellow silk dress opened the door, carrying a soup bowl.</p><p>Beautiful, poised, and gentle, she is Yu Lang’s lawfully wedded wife, the daughter of the Minister of Rites, Mu Yunwan.</p><p>“Husband, drink your ginseng soup.”</p><p>Mu Yunwan glanced at the broken porcelain, placed the soup bowl down, and spoke softly.  Then, she saw Yu Lang's expression and her heart sank.</p><p>Such a look – bewildered, helpless, terrified, afraid…</p><p>No matter how perilous the court, her husband always appeared composed.  She had never seen him like this.</p><p>“What happened?”</p><p>Mu Yunwan gently took Yu Lang’s hand, trying to soothe him.</p><p>Yu Lang seemed to snap back to reality. “Is the messenger still outside?”</p><p>Mu Yunwan nodded.</p><p>Yu Lang jumped up, quickly removed his official robes, opened the rear window, and climbed out, avoiding the front door.</p><p>As he was about to leave, he turned back, saying, “Tell Tao Teng to wait for me in the study. I’ll go to the East Palace after I return!”</p><p>Even without his cultivation, Yu Lang is a genuine innate master with superb light skills.  Leaving a hasty instruction, he vanished into the night like a shadow.</p><p>Mu Yunwan stood by the window, clutching the frame, gazing at the dark night, her face filled with worry.</p><p>…</p><p>By Jade Waist Lake.</p><p>Qingyang Tea House.</p><p>Yu Lang, having left his residence, arrived swiftly using his light skills.</p><p>The urgent message was placed before Xiao Wu.</p><p>Xiao Wu, unlike Yu Lang, remained calm. After a moment, she said, “Master Chen won’t leave.”</p><p>Yu Lang understood his senior sister's meaning, answering and reassuring himself,  “Zhong Ning is a prefectural city. Even if besieged, it shouldn’t fall quickly…”</p><p>However, they both knew Da Liang’s sudden invasion was planned for a long time. They would strive for the greatest possible gains!</p><p>Besides the major passes, the so-called prefectural cities along the border were not strong. Some were even rebuilt on old ruins, and their walls were little stronger than those of ordinary counties.</p><p>Yu Lang’s voice was strained, “Master Chen has a protective talisman.”</p><p>“Master Chen won’t leave!”</p><p>Xiao Wu repeated.</p><p>The talisman they gave Master Chen was for unforeseen accidents, to protect him from cultivator spells. They could make better ones, but they were limited by divine laws.</p><p>Against a siege and overwhelming enemy, a talisman wouldn't offer protection.</p><p>And given Chen Zhenqing’s nature, he would surely share the fate of his people!</p><p>“I’m going to Zhong Ning Prefecture!”</p><p>Xiao Wu pointed to her forehead, a light flashed, and a complex rune appeared before shattering with a ‘bang’, as if breaking a seal. Xiao Wu’s full cultivation was restored!</p><p>In the next instant, Xiao Wu disappeared.</p><p>‘Whoosh…whoosh…’</p><p>The lake water lapped, the night sounds particularly clear, echoing into the tea house.</p><p>The room remained unlit.</p><p>After Xiao Wu left, Yu Lang sat alone in the darkness.  At this critical juncture of turbulent political change, he remained for a long time, unable to leave.</p><p>His senior sister had gone to Zhongning to rescue people.  The intervention of cultivators in mortal affairs was something he had always deeply abhorred.  Yet now, he could not, dared not, stop her.</p><p>Under no circumstances could he bear to watch Master Chen die.  He knew that if Master Chen refused to leave and chose to share the fate of Zhongning, his senior sister would definitely intervene to drive back the Liang army.  The human situation, the fate of countless people, would be altered by his senior sister alone.</p><p>Yu Lang slowly bowed his head, his hands clasped around his head.  A breeze blew in. A figure appeared beside him – the young man surnamed Shi.</p><p>Yu Lang not only hadn't stopped his senior sister from saving people, but he had also made contingency plans. If his senior sister couldn't break the seal, he would ask Shi to go to Zhongning.  After understanding the situation...</p><p>"Still don't understand? Hehe, you'll understand later.  In this world, there are many things that are incomprehensible!"</p><p>The young man surnamed Shi sighed softly and patted Yu Lang on the shoulder.  "You should go back! If Master Chen dies on the battlefield, it will be a worthy death.  If you ask me to, I will kill the Liang army for you. But your entry into the mortal world will then be meaningless. I think, even in the afterlife, Master Chen would rather see you assist the crown prince's ascension, strengthen Yan, and defeat Liang honorably to avenge him!"</p><p>…</p><p>The official road was filled with refugees.  The night was unusually dark. The people were exhausted, moving forward weakly. As long as they had a shred of strength, they dared not stop. The enemy army was behind them; they could only flee, flee inland.</p><p>Xiao Wu flew in the sky, her gaze scanning the ground.  Entering Luzhou, she followed the official road to Zhongning, figuring that if Master Chen's family escaped from Zhongning, they would take this route.</p><p>Then, a familiar aura appeared in her spiritual perception. Xiao Wu immediately descended.</p><p>By the roadside, a carriage was slowly moving.  It wasn't a luxurious carriage; the driver was a burly man with a fierce look, clearly not someone to be trifled with.</p><p>Inside the carriage sat a mother and daughter. The daughter was nestled in her mother's arms, asleep. The mother held her daughter, her face pale, tear-streaked. Her body swayed with the jolting of the carriage. She stared blankly into the darkness ahead, her eyes unfocused.</p><p>This mother and daughter were Master Chen's wife, Chen Liushi, and their daughter.</p><p>"Mistress!"</p><p>Chen Liushi, not noticing Xiao Wu's sudden appearance, was startled by the voice.  Her gaze flickered before she regained her senses. A soft light illuminated the carriage.</p><p>Recognizing Xiao Wu, Chen Liushi's face showed surprise.  "Xiao Wu, how did you get here?"</p><p>"Mistress, Master Chen didn't leave the city with you?" Xiao Wu had a premonition, but facing the reality, her heart was heavy.</p><p>"He found an opportunity to send us out of the city, but he refused to leave himself. He swore to share the fate of the city's people!"</p><p>Chen Liushi hugged her daughter tightly, unable to stop her tears. Her voice was filled with sadness, yet also a hint of strength and pride. "He did it. He kept his vow!"</p><p>Xiao Wu was silent, gazing towards Zhongning.  Master Chen's solemn declaration at Qingyang Temple, years ago, flashed before her eyes.</p><p>Chen Liushi remembered something and reached into her bosom, trembling as she took out a letter.  Throughout their arduous escape, this letter had been meticulously preserved, without a single crease.</p><p>"This is from Zhenqing, for you."</p><p>Xiao Wu took the letter and opened it.  It contained only eight words:  "Share the people's death; die without regret!"</p><p>The ink was slightly smudged, clearly hastily dried, but the strong conviction and determination were evident in the powerful calligraphy.</p><p>"Xiao Wu…" Chen Liushi hesitated.  "You… are you… not ordinary people?"</p><p>Xiao Wu, who was in the capital, suddenly appeared here. Even on the fastest horse, it would have been impossible to travel this quickly.</p><p>In Qipang Village, the couple had already sensed that the Daoist Qingfeng was an extraordinary hermit, and his two disciples were exceptional individuals.  But Chen Liushi didn't know just how extraordinary.</p><p>Seeing Xiao Wu nod in confirmation, Chen Liushi's eyes brightened.  "Can you…"</p><p>"I'm going to Zhongning!"</p><p>Xiao Wu placed a protective spell on the carriage and flew towards Zhongning.  With her cultivation, she could reach the city in an instant, but she slowed her speed, as if hesitating, afraid to approach the city.</p><p>Darkness enveloped the land.</p><p>Xiao Wu flew alone, her speed slowed to that of a bird, finally seeing Zhongning Prefecture.  She remembered her last visit, when the prefecture, after years of recovery, showed signs of prosperity. Now, countless torches illuminated the night sky, also highlighting the city's ruins and a horrific scene of carnage.</p><p>Xiao Wu landed on a mountain outside the city.  Standing there, she silently gazed at the prefecture. Clutching the letter left by her Master, the fine Yan Kingdom paper rustled in the night breeze, like a fluttering white butterfly.  Xiao Wu remained motionless, a statue.</p><p>She sensed her Master's presence within the city, but it was lifeless. She was too late!</p><p>Anger, grief, regret, self-blame, sorrow… Xiao Wu couldn't distinguish the multitude of emotions overwhelming her. It was far more complex than the betrayal by Meng Yusu years ago; she dared not enter the city.</p><p>What should she do? Revenge?</p><p>Xiao Wu was lost, staring at the eight characters in her hand. She could easily slaughter the entire Dali army, but what would that accomplish?  This was a war between nations.  If she sought a culprit, everyone from the emperor to the lowest soldier could be considered responsible, yet none held a personal grudge against Master Chen. Moreover, Master Chen had the opportunity to escape but chose to die bravely. He died for his country, for his people, and claimed to have no regrets.</p><p>The night wind howled stronger.</p><p>"Master, what should I do?"</p><p>Xiao Wu stared blankly at the deep night sky, then moved, walking down the mountain. She didn't use her magic to move quickly, only concealing her presence, proceeding step by step into the city.</p><p>The city gate was smashed, left unrepaired by the Dali soldiers, who had no intention of staying. Corpses lined the roadside, piled high, blood flowing in rivers.</p><p>Xiao Wu walked through this bloody path towards the prefecture office.  The city was unusually noisy; Dali soldiers celebrated their victory amidst the carnage. Xiao Wu's gaze was vacant, seemingly oblivious to the sounds, unconsciously reaching the prefecture office.  One gate was broken; unnoticed by the guards, a woman slipped inside.</p><p>Inside the prefecture office's main hall, a large sand table displayed the entire Luzhou region.  Only one person was there: the Dali general who led the campaign. He held a candle, meticulously examining the sand table, intently studying the battle situation.</p><p>Suddenly, hurried footsteps sounded outside.  A report came: "General, the identities of those bodies have been confirmed."</p><p>The general stood up, saying gravely, "Confirmed that it is truly the Prefect of Zhongning, not a decoy?"</p><p>The reply came, "It's him! Chen Zhenqing, a highly respected man in Luzhou! Sir Left asks whether we should take the body or just the head to hang at the camp gate to demoralize the enemy."</p><p>"I’ve heard of Chen Zhenqing, even in Dali.  He was known for loving his people. While many officials escaped during the siege, he, the chief official, stayed and died with his soldiers.  A virtuous man, whose integrity even death cannot diminish; we will not allow his honor to be defiled!"</p><p>After a moment of silence, the general commanded, "Give him a proper burial."</p><p>"Yes, General!"</p><p>...</p><p>At the grave of Chen Zhenqing, the Prefect of Zhongning Prefecture, Luzhou, Yan Kingdom. Xiao Wu stood before the tomb, watching the Dali soldiers build a grave for Master Chen. She observed the entire process, until the soldiers left, before revealing herself.  After paying her respects, Xiao Wu’s grip on the letter finally loosened.  Carefully folding the letter, she stored it away and left the city.  Leaving Master Chen's remains in this land was perhaps the best resting place.</p><p>Xiao Wu found her Master's wife, using her magic to bring them back to Qipang Village, settling them there.  Standing at the foot of the mountain, looking at the Qingyang Temple, she hesitated, ultimately not going up. She then ascended a white cloud and flew away.</p><p>Above the clouds, Xiao Wu looked at the vast land, her eyes still uncertain, unsure of what she had done. She flew without direction, unaware that she had deviated from the path to the capital.</p><p>Suddenly, Xiao Wu’s eyes flickered, her gaze turning to the distance, showing a flicker of emotion.  With a swift movement, she crossed mountain ranges, appearing above a mountain valley.  A moment later, a white shadow leapt from the valley and into Xiao Wu's arms, emitting joyful cries.</p><p>"Ying ying…"</p><p>It was a white fox.</p><p>— —</p><p>Unbeknownst, another Spring Festival arrived.  Happy New Year to all readers!  May the Year of the Dragon bring you great fortune and soaring success! I will also be taking a three-day break to spend time with my family.</p>
