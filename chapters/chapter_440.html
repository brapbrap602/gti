<h1>Chapter 433: Chaos Erupts</h1><p>The escaping shadow chose a direction that happened to be closest to Qin Sang.</p><p>As the shadow darted out, a blade of Qi, even faster than the shadow itself, slashed towards Qin Sang's face.</p><p>This Qi blade was tangible, like a real blade, its surface even reflecting Qin Sang's face.</p><p>Witnessing this, the others who remained behind paled. They hadn't sensed any fluctuations and were shocked to find someone hidden underwater.</p><p>The Qi blade was powerful and incredibly fast.</p><p>Qin Sang's face, reflected on its surface, remained unchanged.</p><p>Even his eyes were calm.</p><p>Qin Sang watched the Qi blade coldly. He had been the first to detect the presence of this person and was already on guard. With his cautious nature, how could he be ambushed without any countermeasures?</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>Qin Sang's figure flickered, effortlessly dodging the Qi blade. At the same time, his left hand flipped, and a black light shot out from the Yin-Yang Compass, hurtling towards the shadow.</p><p>The shadow reacted swiftly, raising his blade and slashing.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the blade struck the black light directly.  Instead of shattering the light, the shadow was hit.</p><p>The shadow felt a strange repulsive force impacting him, his heart sinking.  He stumbled, his momentum halted, affected by the Yin-Yang Compass.</p><p>He quickly regained his balance, but the best escape opportunity had been lost.</p><p>Qin Sang put away the Yin-Yang Compass and drew the Cold Gold Sword.  Fan Zhen also arrived, brandishing his withered branch-like artifact.  Fan Zhen disliked Qin Sang, but he knew the bigger picture and that this wasn't the time for petty squabbles.</p><p>The shadow's speed plummeted. Escape was no longer possible, trapped between Qin Sang and Fan Zhen.</p><p>In the brief exchange, Qin Sang sensed that this person's cultivation was high, possibly at the False Core Realm. However, he was injured, and the injuries were severe, otherwise, they wouldn't have detected him so easily.</p><p>The Cold Gold Sword swung wide, scattering chilling air.</p><p>Fan Zhen's withered branch artifact transformed into countless tree shadows, closing in on the shadow.</p><p>'Bang!'</p><p>The shadow struggled to defend with his blade. Just as Qin Sang and Fan Zhen were about to capture him, Cang Ling suddenly exclaimed.</p><p>"Senior Brother Xiong, is that you?"</p><p>Cang Ling flashed between the three, urgently saying, "He's one of us! Fellow Daoists, show mercy!"</p><p>Qin Sang paused, his hand forming a sword seal as he recalled the Cold Gold Sword. Fan Zhen did the same, and the three of them focused on the shadow.</p><p>Now they could see clearly. The shadow wore a black robe, an artifact that concealed Qi, though it was now damaged.</p><p>He was powerfully built, around forty years old, his face alarmingly pale, his breath extremely weak. Qin Sang's initial assessment was correct; he was indeed seriously injured.</p><p>"Cough, cough…"</p><p>The shadow was at his limit, barely able to hold his blade.</p><p>"He's my senior brother, Xiong Li!"</p><p>Cang Ling rushed forward to support Xiong Li. "Senior Brother Xiong, how did you get so badly injured?"</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Xiong, please forgive me!"</p><p>Qin Sang sheathed his Cold Gold Sword and bowed.</p><p>Earlier, they had considered the possibility that this person might be from the Small Cold Region, but given the precarious situation, the safest course of action was to capture him first and then question him.</p><p>Xiong Li waved his hand weakly, asking in a raspy voice, "Junior Brother Cang, why are you here? I thought you were from the Heavenly Alliance. If I had known…"</p><p>Cang Ling briefly explained.</p><p>"…We were dispatched by Pei Qin and had no choice but to come. Senior Brother Xiong, were you with Senior Uncle Fang and the others? Why were you ambushed by the Heavenly Alliance?"</p><p>"It's a long story…"</p><p>Xiong Li took a breath.</p><p>"We received secret orders to accompany Senior Uncle Fang south on an important mission.  On our return, the Heavenly Alliance discovered our movements, set a trap, and pursued us here.  They were too strong for us. Senior Uncle Fang managed to set up a formation to hold them off, but it won't last long.  That Pei is a fool. The fighting up ahead is beyond the capabilities of Foundation Establishment cultivators. Senior Uncle Fang ordered us to scatter and seek help. I was pursued by several Heavenly Alliance members and barely escaped with my life…"</p><p>"So that's what happened!"</p><p>Qin Sang and the others cursed Pei Qin inwardly for sending them to their deaths. Senior Uncle Fang had already dismissed the Foundation Establishment disciples, yet he tricked them into a suicide mission.  With so many Core Formation cultivators ahead, appearing there would mean certain death.</p><p>"We can't stay here.  Heavenly Alliance members are hunting down our fellow disciples. Senior Uncle Fang gave the order; you don't need to listen to that Pei.  Go!"</p><p>Xiong Li glanced at the crimson cloud mass, urging them repeatedly.</p><p>The others had long since lost the will to advance. Without needing further urging, they turned and fled.</p><p>Qin Sang stayed beside Cang Ling. He was curious about what Xiong Li and the others had been doing. What had provoked such a strong reaction from the Heavenly Alliance?</p><p>However, Xiong Li was evasive, unwilling to answer directly.</p><p>Sensing something amiss, Qin Sang pondered for a moment, then addressed Cang Ling, "Fellow Daoist Cang, I bear the heavy responsibility of my sect and have other matters to attend to. I can't just leave. I need to return first. Farewell."</p><p>The others suddenly came to their senses.</p><p>Most of them, like Qin Sang, had been stationed here by their sects.</p><p>Driven by Pei Qin before and fearing for their lives, they had forgotten their original missions. Now that they were safe, prompted by Qin Sang's words, they remembered their tasks and hurriedly bid farewell to Cang Ling.</p><p>Just as they were about to separate, Xiong Li suddenly opened his eyes and said gravely, "Fellow Daoists, heed my words.  It's best not to remain in these waters. Go as far as you can!"</p><p>With that, Xiong Li closed his eyes again and remained silent.</p><p>Qin Sang gave Xiong Li a long look and nodded slightly at Cang Ling. Then, he summoned his Ethereal Cloud, left the group, and flew eastward.</p><p>Even without Xiong Li's warning, he sensed that something was wrong. He couldn't stay at the herb garden any longer. He had to return, collect the spirit herbs, and leave immediately.</p><p>Many spirit herbs hadn't matured yet, but Qin Sang couldn't afford to wait. If this place became a battlefield, no barrier could protect them.</p><p>With these thoughts, Qin Sang increased his speed, flying as quickly as possible while concealing his presence.</p><p>He didn't dare fly recklessly. Judging by Xiong Li's tone, after they scattered, they were hunted by Heavenly Alliance cultivators, fleeing in all directions, and the Heavenly Alliance cultivators dispersed accordingly.</p><p>If he was too conspicuous and encountered Heavenly Alliance cultivators, their superior numbers would put him at a disadvantage. Even his artifacts couldn't guarantee his safety if he was surrounded.</p><p>It seemed chaos was imminent.</p><p>Qin Sang sighed inwardly. Unfortunately, his cultivation hadn't reached the False Core Realm yet, making it difficult to ensure his safety amidst the chaos. He could only hope that Qi Yuan Shu would offer some protection.</p><p>After flying for a considerable distance, the surrounding waters remained calm. He hadn't encountered any Heavenly Alliance cultivators.</p><p>However, just then, Qin Sang suddenly heard a sharp shriek in the distance.</p>
