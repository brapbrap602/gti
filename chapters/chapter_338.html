<h1>Chapter 331: The Youluo Cloud</h1><p>“Youluo Cloud.”</p><p>The exchange continued, with nothing catching Qin Sang’s interest.  As he considered which artifacts to offer in exchange, a female cultivator produced a cloud-shaped artifact that caught his eye.</p><p>“A top-grade flying artifact, the Youluo Cloud.  It allows for stealth, can disguise itself as a normal cloud, is incredibly fast, and is virtually untraceable.  The artifact contains a幽冥 (youming) aura and offers powerful protection.  Furthermore, it provides some defense against the gale force winds and unpredictable weather phenomena in the Ancient Immortal Battlefield.”</p><p>Hearing the cultivator’s description, Qin Sang’s expression shifted. He had been looking for such an artifact to replace his Flying Shuttle, but hadn't been satisfied with the ones he’d seen.</p><p>If the cultivator wasn't exaggerating, this was perfect for him.</p><p>The female cultivator, using her spiritual energy, moved the Youluo Cloud to the center of the long table for everyone to see.</p><p>At this moment, a male cultivator in black armor beside them suddenly let out a sinister chuckle, his voice chilling, “To think I’d find the Youluo Cloud here! This is Qingyi Old Devil’s signature artifact!”</p><p>“This artifact was originally a fairly common high-grade artifact called the Qingluo Cloud.  Qingyi Old Devil, by chance, obtained a wisp of幽冥 (youming) energy in a hidden realm, refining it into the Qingluo Cloud, raising its grade to top-tier, and renaming it Youluo Cloud.  One of a kind.</p><p>Qingyi Old Devil has made many enemies, yet he lives so comfortably.  Besides his strange demonic skills, the Youluo Cloud also played a significant role.</p><p>From what I know, Qingyi Old Devil is a nearly two-hundred-year-old lecher.  I doubt this is his artifact.</p><p>No wonder we haven't heard of Qingyi Old Devil’s misdeeds for several years, heh heh…”</p><p>This man's words revealed the Youluo Cloud's origin.  Some cultivators showed a look of understanding; they clearly knew of Qingyi Old Devil.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't know who Qingyi Old Devil was.</p><p>Listening to the discussions around him, he learned that Qingyi Old Devil was a demon active between Tianyou Pass and Yinshan Pass.  He was reportedly a late-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator, powerful and cunning, lecherous, frequently preying on the women of Yinshan Pass.</p><p>Qingyi Old Devil belonged to a sect called the Flower Between Sect, relatively well-known, and was extremely cunning.  He only targeted solitary cultivators or disciples from weak sects. Once he succeeded, he would immediately escape.</p><p>Therefore, despite committing many evil deeds, he lived a comfortable life.</p><p>Now, it seems that even his signature artifact is gone. Qingyi Old Devil is likely dead. This female cultivator, although appearing to be only at the mid-stage Foundation Establishment, is definitely not to be underestimated.</p><p>The Youluo Cloud is quite conspicuous and unique, which explains why it wasn't sent to auction but is being traded here.</p><p>Actually, not only the Youluo Cloud, but most of the artifacts traded earlier had similar shady origins, though no one delved into it.</p><p>The armored man's sudden interruption was against the rules.</p><p>The female cultivator was furious, abruptly turning to glare at the armored man, her eyes narrowed, her killing intent undisguised.  Her voice was icy, “Qingyi Old Devil harmed countless people, making him a target for everyone.  Are you trying to avenge him with those words?”</p><p>The armored man's breathing hitched, his gaze shifty, unable to meet the female cultivator's gaze.  He chuckled nervously, “You misunderstand, Daoist friend. Qingyi Old Devil is wicked and deserves his fate. I have nothing to do with him; I would only cheer for his demise.  I just happened to see the Youluo Cloud, and speculated that Qingyi Old Devil might have been killed, and got a little excited… Yes! It was just excitement! I don’t know which hero eliminated this demon, well done! Excellently done!”</p><p>Everyone looked down on him.</p><p>The female cultivator coldly snorted, ignoring his hypocrisy.  After showcasing the Youluo Cloud, she said, “The Youluo Cloud, in exchange for a flying sword of the same quality, or a second-rate artifact with a special function.”</p><p>Many were interested in the Youluo Cloud, and someone immediately asked, “May I ask, Daoist friend, if I buy the Youluo Cloud, will I bring trouble upon myself?”</p><p>The female cultivator glanced at the person, her gaze lowered, calmly replying, “At least he himself can’t find you.”</p><p>In other words, she wouldn't be responsible for Qingyi Old Devil's sect.</p><p>Others hesitated, but Qin Sang wasn't afraid of the so-called Flower Between Sect; if they dared, let them come to Xuanlu Pass and pick a fight with Mount Shaohua.</p><p>“Daoist friend, what about this flying sword?”</p><p>Qin Sang directly took out Yu Dayue’s flying sword and showed it to the female cultivator.</p><p>Yu Dayue’s sword, possibly due to the refined materials Qin Sang added, was far superior to others, surpassing the Youluo Cloud by several levels. Qin Sang had only slightly refined it after obtaining it and hadn’t planned to use it himself, making this a perfect opportunity to sell it.</p><p>Upon seeing the sword, the female cultivator immediately liked it and readily agreed to the exchange.</p><p>"I'm happy to trade with you, friend!"</p><p>Without giving others a chance to intervene, the two quickly concluded the deal.</p><p>Qin Sang was also pleased with how smoothly it went. He briefly examined the *Youluo Cloud* before putting it away, as it was now his turn.</p><p>"I'll only exchange these items for foundation-building and nourishing pills and precious spirit wood."</p><p>Qin Sang took out two flying swords and Yu Da Yue's octagonal bronze mirror, leaned back in his chair, and said calmly.</p><p>Qin Sang kept the colorful umbrella of the young man in the tight-fitting clothes for himself; the other items were just taking up space in his storage pouch, so it was better to exchange them for cultivation-enhancing pills or spirit wood.</p><p>As soon as the three magical artifacts appeared, the others' gazes towards Qin Sang changed, shifting from apprehension to awe, even among the Foundation Establishment late-stage cultivators.</p><p>Including the spirit sword from earlier, Qin Sang had just sold four top-grade magical artifacts.  Few of the cultivators present could match that.</p><p>Even the burly man, lost in his own world, was startled by Qin Sang's grand gesture. He glanced at Qin Sang, then lowered his head, his eyes filled with intense envy and dejection.</p><p>These people truly had quite a few valuable items.</p><p>The three artifacts were all excellent, especially the scarred man's flying sword and the octagonal bronze mirror, which were true treasures.  Even the Foundation Establishment late-stage cultivators who had remained aloof couldn't help but participate in the bidding.</p><p>Seeing the high demand for his items, Qin Sang stuck to his demand for pills and spirit wood. In the end, the two best items were sold.</p><p>He didn't get much spirit wood, but to Qin Sang's surprise, he received a bottle of Qi Condensing Pills from a Foundation Establishment late-stage cultivator.</p><p>These were the very same Qi Condensing Pills that the old ghost Yi Tian Nie had forced him to take at the Kuiyin Sect!</p><p>Qin Sang had a bad experience with Qi Condensing Pills. He carefully checked the bottle to make sure there was no hidden poison before agreeing to the exchange.</p><p>Foundation-building and nourishing pills have always been highly sought-after.</p><p>Numerous intense gazes focused on the jade bottle containing the Qi Condensing Pills, making it feel almost too hot to hold. Qin Sang coldly snorted, put away the pills, and glared back at everyone without hesitation.</p><p>The others quickly averted their gazes, none daring to meet his.  Any unspoken thoughts they had vanished.</p><p>It was obvious where he'd obtained so many top-grade magical artifacts.</p><p>Moreover, Qin Sang's openly displayed cultivation level was already quite high; he was clearly not someone to be trifled with.</p>
