<h1>Chapter 2134: Resonance of a Great Victory</h1><p>At this point, Qin Sang paused, lost in thought.</p><p>The exploration of the stele's space seemed tortuous and difficult, but in reality, he hadn't encountered any significant danger. It could be said that it had been quite smooth.</p><p>If acquiring Daiyu Immortal Mountain were this easy, wouldn't it be too simple?</p><p>So, were there any threats he had overlooked?</p><p>Qin Sang reviewed the entire process, carefully recalling the most subtle fluctuations that had appeared within the stele's space, but found nothing unusual.</p><p>Further contemplation was futile. Qin Sang withdrew his focus and 'observed' Daiyu Immortal Mountain, naturally drawn to the mountain's fissure.</p><p>Before, from outside the Immortal Mountain, only the dazzling azure light within the fissure could be seen, with vision blocked by the light itself.  Within the fissure, a turbulent undulation constantly emanated, shielding outsiders' perception.</p><p>Both Qin Sang and Min Zhuo had tried, but they were unable to directly peer into the depths of the fissure.</p><p>Now, it was different. Qin Sang found he could 'see' inside the fissure. The azure light originated from the mountain itself. The stone walls on both sides were like precious jade, entirely emerald green, pure and flawless.</p><p>At the deepest part of the fissure, there was a mass of azure energy, the Azure Spiritual Qi. This Azure Spiritual Qi wasn't newly formed; it had been trapped here all along. Every time the Immortal Mountain trembled, a wisp or several wisps would be flung out.</p><p>Unfortunately, there was no higher-quality Azure Spiritual Qi here, which disappointed Qin Sang somewhat.</p><p>What was the source of the Azure Spiritual Qi?</p><p>All Qin Sang could see on the Immortal Mountain, besides the mountain itself, were the mysterious ancient restrictions. The Azure Spiritual Qi shouldn't have originated from the ancient restrictions but from the Immortal Mountain itself.</p><p>His attention shifted to the mountain walls. He didn't see any new Azure Spiritual Qi appearing. Perhaps the formation of Azure Spiritual Qi required time, or maybe this Azure Spiritual Qi was formed during the ascension, under special circumstances. If it were the latter, he wondered if new Azure Spiritual Qi could be created in the future.</p><p>The situation deep within the fissure was somewhat unexpected.  Continuing to observe the mountain, Qin Sang made another startling discovery.  Daiyu Immortal Mountain was riddled with scars, causing the mountain's own power to become chaotic, colliding with itself, one of the reasons for the mountain's tremors.</p><p>Fortunately, due to those mysterious ancient restrictions, Daiyu Immortal Mountain hadn't shattered. One of the functions of the mysterious ancient restrictions was to protect the mountain. The seemingly towering and majestic mountain was actually very fragile inside.</p><p>"Was this also caused by the ascension?"</p><p>Qin Sang speculated silently.  Attempting to delve deeper, he discovered several mysterious places, including the core of the Immortal Mountain, where the interior was a chaotic mass, impossible to probe even with the aid of the stele.</p><p>Unable to discern anything for the time being, Qin Sang's attention finally turned to those mysterious ancient restrictions. After a little probing, he was delighted to discover that some of the restrictions on the mountain's surface didn't reject him and could be manipulated.</p><p>He began searching for restrictions that didn't reject him.  As restriction after restriction came under his control, spreading almost across the entire mountain, he realized that controlling these restrictions allowed him to influence the mountain.</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't found a way to refine Daiyu Immortal Mountain, but he could try using the restrictions to move the mountain!</p><p>With this thought, Qin Sang immediately began to try.</p><p>On the surface of the Immortal Mountain, the restrictions gradually manifested, and strange phenomena arose. White mist appeared within the mountain, swirling immortal mist, even obscuring the azure light emanating from the fissure, adding a touch of ethereal mystique to the Immortal Mountain.</p><p>Within the white mist, Qin Sang and the stele appeared and disappeared.</p><p>In the next moment, the void trembled slightly, the immortal mist surged, and the Immortal Mountain abruptly rose several dozen feet.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The movement of Daiyu Immortal Mountain disturbed the tranquility of the abyss. The ancient restrictions in the void emitted unusual fluctuations, as if about to erupt.</p><p>Sensing the threat, Qin Sang's thoughts flickered.  With a resounding boom, Daiyu Immortal Mountain crashed back down to its original position, and the turbulence in the abyss subsided.</p><p>"It seems that taking Daiyu Immortal Mountain out is not an easy task…"</p><p>Qin Sang looked beyond the mountain, his gaze sweeping across the dark abyss, thinking to himself.</p><p>Daiyu Immortal Mountain seemed to have some connection to the abyss. Forcibly removing the mountain would trigger changes in the abyss, possibly even causing it to collapse and cease to exist.</p><p>There seemed to be only one path before him: try to control more of the Immortal Mountain's ancient restrictions, preferably gaining complete control of the mountain, severing this connection.</p><p>But time was running out, and Qin Sang wasn't sure if he could do it.</p><p>However, Qin Sang had another, unconventional method. He had his Dharma Idol bring the Thousand Jun Ring!</p><p>It wasn't that he had foreseen this situation.</p><p>Inside the Thousand Jun Ring was a small cave realm. Over the years, the small cave realm had become increasingly stable, with a vast space spanning hundreds of miles. Whether the source of the Azure Spiritual Qi was Daiyu Immortal Mountain or something else, as long as it didn't exceed the capacity of the small cave realm, it could be directly taken away, which was extremely convenient.</p><p>The premise was that the object was stable enough not to cause the small cave realm to shake or even collapse.</p><p>Daiyu Immortal Mountain wasn't stable, but Qin Sang could utilize the ancient restrictions on the mountain's surface to mask the fluctuations caused by the tremors. As long as he could hold out until he escaped the abyss, he could easily resolve this problem.</p><p>It would be even better if he could keep Daiyu Immortal Mountain within the small cave realm. A mountain, no matter where it was placed, was too conspicuous.</p><p>With this in mind, Qin Sang continued his attempts, searching for more controllable ancient restrictions. The white mist on the mountain's surface grew thicker and thicker, dense immortal mist enveloping the entire mountain. Eventually, the main body of the Immortal Mountain could no longer be seen, completely obscured by the immortal mist.</p><p>The immortal mist flowed, not smoothly, often rippling, but compared to the previous tremors, it had become very faint.</p><p>At this time, Qin Sang withdrew his focus, letting out a soft breath, and found himself also enveloped in the immortal mist.</p><p>Qin Sang flew out of the mountain and summoned the Thousand Jun Ring.  With a flash of spiritual light, the space before him became completely empty. Both the immortal mist and the Immortal Mountain vanished without a trace.</p><p>He immersed his consciousness into the small cave realm and saw the Immortal Mountain descending towards a clearing he had specifically prepared. The moment it landed, the ground trembled violently. The fluctuations emanating from the immortal mist still affected the small cave realm, but it was better than he had expected.</p><p>'Rumble!'</p><p>A sudden change in the outside world startled Qin Sang.  He quickly withdrew his consciousness and found that the rumbling came from the bottom of the abyss.</p><p>In the depths of the darkness, a terrifying power seemed to be brewing, ready to erupt at any moment. The surrounding ancient restrictions flickered with strange light, and an unsettling atmosphere enveloped the area.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't dare hesitate.  He immediately grabbed Min Zhuo, who was beside him, and transformed into a streak of azure lightning, rushing towards the exit of the abyss.</p><p>Weaving through the ancient restrictions, Qin Sang retraced his path, encountering no major dangers. Just as he was about to rush out of the abyss, a sudden change occurred.</p><p>'Crackle!'</p><p>White lightning shot out from a group of ancient restrictions, striking towards the azure lightning. The two bolts of lightning intersected.</p><p>Qin Sang was secretly startled.  Fortunately, the speed of the Lightning Escape was fast enough. Otherwise, he might have been struck by the white light, and he didn't know what consequences that would have brought.</p><p>Outside the abyss.</p><p>Elder Shi and the others were happily collecting Azure Spiritual Qi.  The Storm Realm had only sent these people, daring only to pick up the scraps, posing no threat to them.</p><p>The presence of the Zhangyou Clan experts, however, made the Xuantian Palace experts wary, plotting to kill them all after the event, leaving none alive!</p><p>"Huh? Why isn't any more Azure Spiritual Qi drifting out?"</p><p>Someone activated their Spiritual Eyes and gazed into the abyss, puzzled.</p><p>Elder Shi looked towards the celestial pole, calculating silently, and said, "The turbid Qi has reached its lowest point and is now rising. Perhaps…"</p><p>Before he could finish, he was interrupted by someone's startled cry, "What is that?"</p><p>Everyone was taken aback and looked in the direction the person was pointing. They saw a brilliant azure light erupting from the dimness, far more dazzling than the Azure Spiritual Qi.</p><p>The speed of the azure light was astonishing. They feared that dim area like a tiger, but the azure light moved through it unimpeded, followed by an overwhelmingly powerful pressure that made their hearts tremble.</p><p>"This pressure…"</p><p>Among those present, some had been on the battlefield and had witnessed the Azure Roc True Lightning Escape.</p><p>Thinking of a possibility, their expressions drastically changed. When they finally saw clearly what was within the azure light, they were utterly shocked.</p><p>Their Clan Leader was being carried in someone's hand, utterly powerless!</p><p>Fear surged into everyone's hearts.  Before they could flee, the azure light was already upon them.</p><p>With a flap of its phoenix wings, the Azure Roc Dharma Idol sent Elder Shi and the others tumbling.  Before they could react, dazzling lightning flashed in the sky, and thick lightning ropes descended.  The powerful force tore through their protective divine abilities.  Everyone felt a wave of numbness wash over them, their consciousness fading as they lost consciousness.</p><p>The lightning ropes swung, throwing them before the Xuantian Palace cultivators. Qin Sang barked, "Take them away!"</p><p>The Xuantian Palace cultivators looked at each other, still reeling from the sudden turn of events. In the blink of an eye, their enemies had been captured alive, at their mercy.</p><p>An Xuantian Palace elder opened his mouth to speak, but then noticed grayish-white mist rising from the depths of the turbid land. At the same time, the abyss stirred, and a strong sense of danger washed over him.</p><p>"Let's go!"</p><p>After everyone left, Qin Sang also slowly retreated, watching as the turbid Qi flooded the abyss, and the strange phenomena erupted.</p><p>Strange lights flickered, transforming into terrifying waves, colliding with the turbid Qi, churning everything into chaos.  He didn't know if the abyss would survive this upheaval.</p><p>Qin Sang watched for a while longer, then departed, soaring into the sky.</p><p>…</p><p>Storm Realm.</p><p>Western Lands.</p><p>After the great battle, the battlefield was a scene of devastation.</p><p>Su Nu, Si Lu, and Zhu Que had all arrived and were leading people to clean up the battlefield.</p><p>This battle hadn't been without benefits. Although the Eight Trigrams Stabilizing Diagram had been taken away, under its influence for over a year, the landscape of the Western Lands had permanently changed. The desert had almost disappeared. Though it still looked desolate, once stability returned to the Storm Realm, life would surely return to this place.</p><p>Qin Sang hovered alone in the air for a long time, motionless, comprehending his gains. No one dared to disturb him.</p><p>He slowly came to, looked at the battlefield, and saw Si Lu leading people to round up the remnants of Lu Wang's army.</p><p>The activation of the Thunder Oath Chapter, even its residual waves, could easily annihilate Nascent Soul cultivators. Countless soldiers of Lu Wang's army had died on the spot. Fortunately, Qin Sang had shown some restraint, leaving some captives.</p><p>These were the elite of the Lu family and could serve as Si Lu's foundation or join the demonic soldiers as guardians of his Dao field.</p><p>As for the survivors like Shi Mu, they had all sworn oaths with Si Lu, becoming guest elders of the Yan Shan Si family. They were assigned various trivial tasks, yet they showed no impatience.</p><p>"A great victory!"</p><p>Qin Sang already knew of the Azure Roc Dharma Idol's experiences.  This thought flashed through his mind, and he felt deeply gratified.</p><p>Both battlefields had resulted in resounding victories, with abundant harvests.</p><p>"Hey! You're smiling so slyly. How many good treasures did you snatch this time?"</p><p>Zhu Que, who had been protecting Qin Sang, saw him awaken and hurriedly flew over, clamoring for a share.</p><p>Qin Sang began to sort through his gains from this battle.</p><p>Besides the true peace that had come to the Storm Realm, the insights he had gained from this battle, and Si Lu's return to the Siyou Clan – these intangible benefits aside –</p><p>The most precious treasure was undoubtedly the Heaven-Trapping Golden Lock, capable of evolving into a Void Domain.</p><p>With the Grand Protector's death, this treasure had lost its master, falling to the ground, where Qin Sang collected it.</p><p>Unfortunately, the Grand Protector's Mustard Seed spatial artifact had been destroyed by the Thunder Oath Chapter.</p><p>The Heaven-Trapping Golden Lock was a spiritual treasure. If he had possessed the "Compendium of Treasures," it, too, would have been reduced to ashes along with all of the Grand Protector's possessions.</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't the destined master of the Heaven-Trapping Golden Lock. To make this treasure acknowledge him as its master, he could only rely on the secret technique he had obtained from the Five Elements Alliance, slowly suppressing and confusing the treasure's spirit, refining it. This secret technique was extremely complex and troublesome, not worth using on ordinary spiritual treasures, but the Heaven-Trapping Golden Lock was clearly worth a try.</p><p>Having observed the sword light left by Celestial Venerable Tian Yue, his understanding of Dharma Domains far surpassed that of his peers. With the help of the Heaven-Trapping Golden Lock, he might be able to manifest a Void Domain even in the mid-Nascent Soul stage.</p><p>The Grand Protector's treasure vase was also quite powerful, but it was deeply connected to him, no less than a life-bound object, making it difficult for outsiders to refine, greatly diminishing its value.</p><p>In addition, Qin Sang had obtained the Mustard Seed spatial artifacts of Lu Wang, Lu Gan, and others.</p><p>Lu Wang was one of the four kings of the Siyou Clan, and Lu Gan was his confidant. Both were incredibly wealthy.</p><p>Especially Lu Wang, who carried the heritage of the Han Jiang Lu family, possessed countless treasures, a dazzling array.</p><p>The spiritual treasures and artifacts were actually secondary because, due to the Siyou Clan's unique physique and divine abilities, most of them weren't compatible with outsiders.</p><p>What Qin Sang valued were the spiritual materials and medicinal pills. The accumulation of one of the four great royal families over countless years, combined with the resources plundered from the Yan Shan Si family, was astounding.</p><p>To construct the Thunder Altar, Qin Sang had nearly emptied his coffers. These greatly replenished his losses.</p><p>It was worth mentioning that Lu Wang had carried the Han Jiang Lu family's Mirage Conch with him, which also fell into Qin Sang's hands.</p><p>And this wasn't all.</p><p>At this time, Si Lu also noticed Qin Sang's actions and flew up into the air, bowing deeply and sincerely saying, "Many thanks to Brother Qin for avenging me! I am eternally grateful for this kindness and will never forget it!"</p><p>Si Lu's words came from the bottom of his heart.</p><p>Back then, when he chose to leave with Su Nu, he had intended to endure humiliation and bear a heavy burden. Unexpectedly, by following Qin Sang, he had so quickly avenged the extermination of his clan.</p><p>The masterminds behind his enemies were all dead, every last one of them!</p><p>Recalling the past, Si Lu couldn't help but feel deeply moved, filled with gratitude and admiration for Qin Sang.</p><p>"My actions were not solely for your revenge, Fellow Daoist, but also for my own purposes," Qin Sang said calmly. "Now that you can return to the Siyou Clan, the Yan Shan Si family can be a connection for me in the future."</p><p>"If Brother Qin has any commands, Si Lu will not refuse!"</p><p>Si Lu made a solemn promise, then his tone shifted.  "Now that Lu Wang and the Grand Protector are dead, the Lu family's experts have been wiped out, their elite forces exhausted, and the Han Jiang Lu residence is at its most vulnerable. Other forces wouldn't dare act rashly for now, but once the Young Master returns and the news spreads, they will inevitably try to carve up the Lu family.  We shouldn't delay. It's best to return to Han Jiang as soon as possible, lest others steal the fruits of our labor."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded. "Let Su Nu and Zhu Que accompany you first. I still have important matters to attend to and will arrive shortly."</p>
