<h1>Chapter 1365: Ghost Mother</h1><p>These matters did not require Qin Sang's instructions; the disciples could arrange them properly.</p><p>Seeing that Qin Sang seemed to be in good spirits, Bai Hanqiu's anxious heart settled down.</p><p>To successfully break through to the Mid Nascent Soul stage after only thirty-odd years of closed-door cultivation was indeed something to be happy about.</p><p>Each small realm in the Nascent Soul stage was a great hurdle.</p><p>Qin Sang had originally estimated that this time he would spend at least several decades, or even a century, in seclusion, and it would be good enough if he could touch the bottleneck.</p><p>He did not expect the cultivation process to be so exceptionally smooth.</p><p>The soul shadow within the Nascent Soul Talisman Puppet had been of great help.</p><p>Qin Sang spent only eighteen years refining two Corpse Flower Blood Ambers, then quietly cultivated for five years, pushing his cultivation to the peak of the Early Nascent Soul stage. After that, he began to consolidate his cultivation and attempt to break through the bottleneck.</p><p>In just twelve years, Qin Sang felt a sense of enlightenment and successfully broke through!</p><p>At the instant of the breakthrough, even Qin Sang himself felt a sense of disbelief.</p><p>Counting from the day he formed his Nascent Soul, it had been less than eighty years!</p><p>The world of cultivation was never short of geniuses, but according to legends, being able to break through to the Mid Nascent Soul stage within one tribulation, which is three hundred years after forming the Nascent Soul, was already a remarkable achievement.</p><p>And he had completed it within a hundred years!</p><p>Of course, Qin Sang did not become conceited.</p><p>Qin Sang knew that he was by no means a genius. He was able to achieve such astonishing results entirely thanks to the Corpse Flower Blood Ambers and the Nascent Soul Talisman Puppet.</p><p>The Corpse Flower Blood Ambers were used up, and the Nascent Soul Talisman Puppet could not provide any more help. This kind of leap in cultivation could not be replicated. He could only walk the road ahead step by step.</p><p>The Late Nascent Soul stage was still very far away from him!</p><p>"Shishu!" </p><p>At this moment, Tan Yien and the white cat finally caught up, panting as they stepped forward and cautiously asked, "Shishu, have you already broken through to the Mid Nascent Soul stage…"</p><p>Qin Sang smiled and nodded slightly.</p><p>"Congratulations, Shishu, on taking a further step on the Great Path!"</p><p>Tan Yien exclaimed with joy.</p><p>…</p><p>The disciples suggested holding another grand ceremony, at which time Qin Sang would surely awe the Northern Chen Alliance, unmatched by anyone.</p><p>But Qin Sang rejected it.</p><p>Qin Sang had learned about the current state of the sect, encouraged the disciples with a few words, and then left Green Ram Grotto  alone, heading straight south.</p><p>It had been several months since Mei Gu sent back the message.</p><p>During this time, Li Yufu had personally rushed over, but neither of them had sent back any new information, and he did not know if they had encountered any danger.</p><p>Tan Hao was not only Qin Sang's old friend, but also related to whether Dumb Gu could awaken, so he definitely had to make a trip himself.</p><p>However, the location where Tan Hao's tracks were discovered was too special, actually on a small island at the southern end of the Northern Chen Alliance.</p><p>Continuing south would be the storm belt.</p><p>Passing through this storm belt would allow one to leave the Northern Chen Territory and reach the Three Seas of the North Sea!</p><p>He flew all the way.</p><p>Qin Sang hardly paused, and he didn't visit any friends along the way, passing through the Yun Cang Great Swamp, flying over the Heavenly Journey Plateau, and speeding through the vast desert.</p><p>The area of the Northern Chen Great Desert was so vast that even if the other territories were added together, they would be far from comparable.</p><p>Qin Sang's trip was almost equivalent to traversing the Northern Chen Territory!</p><p>Arriving at the southern end of the Northern Chen Great Desert, the closer he got to the sea, the denser the oases became, and the population gradually flourished. This place was once the main target of the Abyss of Sin's invasion, but after decades, the scars had long been smoothed over, and it was a scene of prosperity.</p><p>The desert area had a different look and feel from other territories.</p><p>Qin Sang had no intention of observing the exotic customs, and went straight out to sea.</p><p>The sea was calm.</p><p>Just now, Qin Sang had found a cultivator market and collected some information.</p><p>This place was still far away from the storm belt, so the sea hurricanes caused by the storm belt hardly affected the coastal waters, and there were no ferocious demonic beasts. In addition, this sea area was different from Canglang Sea. The islands were sparse and concentrated in the near-sea area, and most of them had thin spiritual energy.</p><p>Especially near the storm belt, not a single island could be seen.</p><p>Because of this.</p><p>The natives of the islands were mainly mortals, who did not need to support cultivators to help resist storms and demonic beasts.</p><p>The island that Mei Gu discovered was located in a very remote area, almost at the southeastern end of the archipelago.</p><p>Qin Sang did not hide his escaping light, and sped towards the southeast.</p><p>He did not encounter anyone blocking his way along the way.</p><p>Before long, Qin Sang arrived near the island. To be on the safe side, he did not land directly on the island, but found an island reef to activate the Green Ram Grotto's communication treasure.</p><p>Soon.</p><p>Two figures flew from a distance, it was Mei Gu and Li Yufu.</p><p>"Greetings, Shibo!" </p><p>"Greetings, Shizun!" </p><p>The two showed joy when they saw Qin Sang and stepped forward to salute.</p><p>Qin Sang checked the two's cultivation levels and nodded in satisfaction. "Not bad! It seems you haven't slacked off during this time! Mei Gu, is that the island you mentioned?"</p><p>At the end of the field of vision, there was a shadow of a small island, looming in the waves.</p><p>With Qin Sang's eyesight, he could see some scenery from afar.</p><p>The island looked very ordinary.</p><p>There was not even a city, only a village, all of them mortals.</p><p>There was a large forest on the island, occupying almost 90% of the area, lush and verdant, but the spiritual energy was very thin. Cultivators should not choose this place to open a cave.</p><p>Unless there was an illusion array on the island that even the Celestial Eye Butterfly could not see through.</p><p>"Reporting to Master, this is the place!"</p><p>Mei Gu told the story one by one, "When the disciple was traveling in the desert, she got news of a senior's cave, and traced it all the way to this sea area, and accidentally discovered it when passing through the village on the island..."</p><p>Li Yufu continued, "Shimei  and I did not dare to act rashly and observed secretly nearby. For several months, no cultivators have entered or left the island."</p><p>…</p><p>After hearing about the two's encounters.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered for a while and led the two towards the island.</p><p>There were more than a thousand households in the village.</p><p>Smoke curled upwards from the cooking fires.</p><p>Qin Sang and the others cast an invisibility spell to avoid disturbing the mortals.</p><p>Mei Gu led Qin Sang to the courtyard at the deepest part of the village, which was said to be the ancestral hall.</p><p>"It's here..."</p><p>Mei Gu said in a low voice, glanced around warily, and flashed in.</p><p>The ancestral hall enshrined ancestral tablets, and incense burned continuously.</p><p>In the very center of the tablets, there was also an exquisite wood carving, carving a person. The carving skills were not even one ten-thousandth of Qingjun Shijie's , but it was meticulous, and it could be seen that the carver was extremely respectful to him.</p><p>His face could be seen clearly.</p><p>It was Tan Hao!</p><p>Qin Sang paused and stared at the wood carving.</p><p>The wood carving's position seemed very special. The spiritual tablets around it were empty. Only a tablet of 'Ghost Mother' was in front of it, but there was no writing on the wood carving, so there was no way to judge his identity.</p><p>If no one in the village was surnamed Tan, Qin Sang would have thought that Tan Hao had started a family here.</p><p>Mei Gu continued, "After discovering this wood carving, I found the oldest clan elder and secretly used hypnotism to ask the reason. More than a hundred years ago, the sea was plagued with monsters, and the mortals on the island almost died in the bellies of the demons. At the critical moment, the person on the wood carving suddenly appeared and saved the entire village. It can be confirmed that he is a cultivator, but it is difficult to judge his cultivation level. The survivors were grateful for his kindness and enshrined him as their reborn parents. However, this person did not leave his name, and after killing the monster, he broke through the air and left, claiming that he was under the command of the Ghost Mother and was acting under orders!"</p>
