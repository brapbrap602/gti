<h1>Chapter 1793: Confronting the Demon Marquis</h1><p>A shout echoed as a streak of lightning, swift as a shooting star, intercepted Li Hou.  Its speed surpassed Li Hou’s, blocking his escape from the forest before he could reach the edge.</p><p>This was true lightning遁术. Qin Sang finally unleashed his true energy, drawing upon the Azure Luan lightning power within his phoenix wings.</p><p>Consequently, Qin Sang’s true energy was being depleted at an alarming rate. With only the equivalent of a late Nascent Soul cultivator’s energy reserve, he couldn't sustain this for long.</p><p>However, Qin Sang had already taken a Stabilizing Pill.</p><p>Having decided to fight Li Hou, Qin Sang had secretly taken out a Stabilizing Pill and held it in his mouth, ready to refine it at any moment.</p><p>The previous battle had greatly boosted Qin Sang’s confidence. Seeing Li Hou’s attempt to flee, he immediately swallowed the pill.</p><p>The medicinal power surged into his body, awakening his dantian from its dormant state.  A continuous stream of medicinal power transformed into pure true energy, rapidly replenishing his dantian. Qin Sang’s aura soared, and his strength swiftly returned.</p><p>Furthermore, this true energy remained unaffected by external influences, showing no signs of disorder. His true energy was stable and flowed smoothly.</p><p>It was a long-awaited sensation, intoxicating him. Qin Sang couldn't help but feel a surge of emotion, making his desire for advancement even more urgent.</p><p>After all, he was essentially a cultivator of the Dao, and the *Chapter on Nurturing the Divine Soul with the Sword* was his true foundation!  Therefore, Qin Sang didn't hesitate to swallow the Stabilizing Pill.</p><p>The golden light impacting the ritual altar presented an unparalleled opportunity.  Encountering a lone Demon Marquis was rare, and finding a place rich in Wood Spirit energy was even rarer.</p><p>Once the golden light subsided, these Demon Marquises would likely regroup.</p><p>The future course of events remained unclear, but given the opportunity, he would naturally seize it with all his might.</p><p>Li Hou was trying to exhaust him, but Qin Sang was doing the same.</p><p>However, Li Hou was more alert and decisive than anticipated. Qin Sang had intended to feign inability to withstand the Wood Spirit energy’s impact, gradually appearing weak, and then counterattacking at the last moment.</p><p>The longer the delay, the more advantageous it would be for Qin Sang.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Li Hou launched a decisive attack midway, sensing danger and abandoning his prey abruptly, which somewhat surprised Qin Sang.</p><p>The battle didn't unfold as perfectly as Qin Sang had envisioned, but nothing in the world was perfect.  Facing a formidable Demon Marquis at the mid-stage of the Divine Transformation realm, Qin Sang didn't expect to outmaneuver him completely.</p><p>Ultimately, he had to rely on his strength to win!</p><p>In a flash, Qin Sang stood before Li Hou, raising his arms and delivering powerful blows like a hammer.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang was full of energy, his momentum like a rainbow, showing no sign of wavering.</p><p>If Li Hou had any doubts before, they were now dispelled. This was a complete deception; the enemy had been feigning weakness, luring him into a trap step by step.</p><p>In haste, Li Hou raised his claws to defend, but also sensed another aura erupting from Qin Sang.</p><p>“Body-Cultivation and Dao-Cultivation Dual Cultivation!”</p><p>Li Hou exclaimed in surprise.</p><p>It had always considered Qin Sang a cultivator from the Dragon Tiger Altar, or a demon cultivator who had pledged allegiance to the Celestial Court.</p><p>Except for the Military Altar, it was rare for cultivators of the Celestial Court to summon altars during duels, unless they were using talismans exceeding their cultivation level.  This was even more true for Dragon Tiger Altar cultivators, whose cultivation relied on their physical bodies, eliminating the need for summoning altars.</p><p>While there were cultivators who practiced both Body-Cultivation and Dao-Cultivation in this world, they were mostly those who had reached a cultivation bottleneck and sought inspiration through body refinement.  True dual cultivators were rare.</p><p>The Daoist art of talisman creation pointed directly to the Dao, profound and boundless, vast as the ocean.  One might spend a lifetime without grasping even the basics. How many would dare to divide their attention?</p><p>Feeling the true energy fluctuations from Qin Sang, which were no weaker than his physical strength, Li Hou felt a sense of foreboding.</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>Fists and claws collided.</p><p>Li Hou was unharmed and took the opportunity to retreat, immediately changing direction, determined to escape the forest.</p><p>With Li Hou’s keen eyesight, he knew that within this forest, Qin Sang’s Wood Spirit body possessed formidable power. Once outside, Qin Sang’s strength would be significantly diminished.</p><p>Unfortunately, Li Hou's premonition proved correct.</p><p>The moment Li Hou moved, the light in the sky suddenly dimmed, plunging the world into darkness. Then, stars began to rise.</p><p>The starlight was brilliant, illuminating everything. Li Hou felt as if he had been pulled into the depths of space; the bright starlight falling upon him felt like countless sword blades, intensely cold.</p><p>“Sword Formation!”</p><p>Li Hou recognized the stars as sword-intent-formed star-swords. His expression changed drastically.</p><p>At this moment, his connection to the world seemed to be severed by the sword formation.</p><p>Ordinary formations rarely trapped Divine Transformation cultivators, because Divine Transformation cultivators had achieved preliminary Heaven-Human harmony; if a formation had a single flaw, it could easily be detected.</p><p>But the *Seven Mansion Division Sword Formation* was a true legacy of the Wuxiang Immortal Sect's Golden Aspect lineage, possibly even originating from the Immortal Palace, no ordinary sword formation at all.</p><p>For years, Qin Sang, though unable to cultivate, diligently studied sword formations. Now, their power is unparalleled.</p><p>Seven sword spirits guard the Seven Mansions, aided by the pseudo-spiritual treasure, the Grey Warbler Sword. Even if Qin Sang's cultivation is inferior to Li Hou's, it's not easily defeated.</p><p>Li Hou might possess abilities to break the formation, but Qin Sang won't give them the chance.</p><p>The sword formation appears.</p><p>Sword intent locks down the heavens and earth.</p><p>The next moment, Qin Sang's true form closes in. Without summoning any treasures, their fist strikes like thunder.</p><p>They fight like a body cultivator, only now Qin Sang is on the offensive.</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>Li Hou is forced to engage, now retreating repeatedly, their eyes darting, trying to find a flaw in the Seven Mansions' array.</p><p>Lotus Seal!</p><p>Destroyer Seal!</p><p>Wheel Seal!</p><p>…</p><p>Buddha seals emerge continuously. Qin Sang, using the sharp instincts of the Vajra Great Freedom Seal, unleashes a storm of attacks on Li Hou.</p><p>Faced with this onslaught, Li Hou dares not neglect, engaging reluctantly. Fortunately, the sword array remains largely static, seemingly only containing them.</p><p>Li Hou lashes out with both claws, leaving afterimages in the void. Instantly, countless claw shadows engulf Qin Sang.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The claw shadows shatter simultaneously.</p><p>Qin Sang presses forward, charging relentlessly, seemingly fearless of injury.</p><p>*Tear!*</p><p>Sharp claws leave wounds on Qin Sang, tearing their tree-like skin, but Qin Sang pays no mind; the wood spirit energy continually replenishes them, making injuries insignificant unless fatal.</p><p>Their wood spirit body bends, Qin Sang raises their fists, bringing them together before slamming them towards Li Hou.</p><p>Li Hou's body is smaller than Qin Sang's fist; a direct hit would likely pulverize it.</p><p>*Puff!*</p><p>A muffled sound echoes from Qin Sang as a bone spike silently approaches their abdomen.</p><p>Li Hou, persistent, launches another bone spike, choosing a devilishly precise timing and angle.</p><p>Yet the result is the same. No matter how concealed or cunning, the trajectory of the spike cannot escape the eyes of the Sky Eye Butterfly. Qin Sang, guided by the butterfly's intent, uses the fragment of a spiritual treasure to intercept it.</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>Fists clash, landing in empty air.</p><p>Qin Sang doesn't pause, striding forward with unstoppable force, breaking countless ancient trees; their eyes fixed on Li Hou.</p><p>Since entering the Cave Xuan realm, Li Hou has never been so cornered.  Enraged, they let out a piercing shriek, abandoning their retreat.</p><p>Qin Sang, far from alarmed, is delighted, standing firm, unwavering.</p><p>Instantly, the beast and cultivator clash in a furious melee.</p><p>This battle is fiercer than before, starlight from the heavens focusing on the battlefield.</p><p>Surrounding trees are reduced to splinters by the intense power.  Beast and cultivator engage in brutal, unadulterated combat.</p><p>Qin Sang seems to remain in one spot, yet badger shadows and fist shadows flash rapidly in the void, inseparable, indistinguishable from reality and illusion.</p><p>*Bang bang bang…*</p><p>The sounds of impact rain down.</p><p>In an instant, Qin Sang endures countless claw attacks and bone spikes.</p><p>And it's not over.</p><p>Li Hou summons the Xun Earth Demon Thunder; thunderballs fall continuously, exploding on Qin Sang, enveloping them in thick lightning, relentlessly pounding them.</p><p>Qin Sang withstands every attack, disregarding their own depletion.  Endless wood spirit energy sustains them, allowing the constant activation of the Vajra Heaven Armor Seal.</p><p>Fatal blows are intercepted by the treasure fragment, and while other attacks might wound the wood spirit body, it quickly regenerates.</p><p>Li Hou grows increasingly uneasy.</p><p>Their bone spikes, refined over years, are not only effective as hidden weapons, but also possess powerful and unpredictable abilities.  However, this is only true if they can wound their enemy; piercing the treasure fragment is futile.</p><p>Even more unbelievable to Li Hou is Qin Sang's seemingly inexhaustible absorption of wood spirit energy, showing no sign of Qi and blood chaos.</p><p>Their foundation is exceptionally stable, as if they've merged with the forest itself, never weakening – beyond Li Hou's comprehension, defying logic!</p><p>If this continues, Li Hou will be the first to exhaust their strength!</p><p>Li Hou never imagined they would one day be worn down by a cultivator of lesser cultivation.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>Perhaps distracted, Li Hou is struck by a fist, flung away like a ball.</p><p>Qin Sang, using his lightning-遁术 (escape technique), pursued Li Hou relentlessly.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Li Hou merged with the earth, vanishing without a trace.  The Seven Constellations Sword Array, while not floating in the air (as Qin Sang also needed to be grounded), had inadvertently given Li Hou the opportunity to use earth-遁术.  However, Qin Sang was not surprised; his body disappeared abruptly.</p><p>The ancient trees here were intertwined, their sword-like energy permeating the earth.  Earth-遁术 couldn't hide from his perception.</p><p>The next moment, a distant ancient tree withered with a deafening roar. The ground cracked violently, roots and soil flying as a small badger-like shadow erupted.</p><p>Almost simultaneously, Qin Sang burst from the earth, shouldering a massive boulder and two towering trees.  With a shake of his shoulders, he flung the debris aside, lunging forward to continue his fierce assault on the badger shadow.</p><p>Unexpectedly, more than one badger shadow emerged from the ground.</p><p>The surrounding earth simultaneously collapsed into a dozen large pits, each spewing forth a badger shadow. These shadows were not illusions; they were real, possessing the same aura as Li Hou's true form, racing towards the sky.</p><p>Qin Sang, however, didn't bother to shift his gaze, ignoring the other shadows and focusing intently on the badger before him, convinced it was Li Hou's true form.</p><p>Li Hou tried twice more, but found its carefully cultivated abilities ineffective; it was unable to deceive Qin Sang's judgment.  It was both surprised and enraged, abandoning these futile attempts and, while it still had the strength, tried to break the array.</p><p>Unfortunately, under Qin Sang's relentless pressure, its attempts were unsuccessful.  Qin Sang multitasked, his true energy and blood essence working in tandem, continuously attacking Li Hou. Even when Li Hou made progress with its abilities, Qin Sang instantly adjusted the array, forcing Li Hou to rely on the array's patterns to find a way out, a process that would inevitably take a long time.</p><p>After several unsuccessful attempts, Li Hou let out a piercing shriek, its eyes turning a blood-red.</p><p>Qin Sang then witnessed a startling sight: Li Hou's fur turned crimson, its claws dripping with blood.  Its blood-red fur danced wildly, its aura reaching a frenzied peak.</p><p>At that moment, Qin Sang felt as if he were facing a late-stage Transcendence-level demon beast, his heart pounding.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>The blood badger appeared before Qin Sang.  Only then did the warning from the Heaven's Eye Butterfly arrive.</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>A bloody claw slashed through the air, leaving a crimson mark in its wake.  Before the claw reached Qin Sang, he sensed an unnatural fluctuation emanating from the scratch.</p><p>His blood essence began to churn.  For a body cultivator, this was extremely dangerous. Qin Sang felt a significant impediment in using the Seven Masters Buddha Seal.</p><p>He also felt a sharp pain; the claw seemed capable of penetrating his defenses.</p><p>Qin Sang's heart sank. His spiritual light dimmed, and layers of Infernal Fire surged forth, instantly forming a fiery shield enveloping his body.</p><p>Since refining all of the Nine Netherworld Infernal Fire, Qin Sang could control it with his consciousness alone, without consuming true energy.  However, while refining the Kirin Primal Seed, he dared not use his consciousness freely, limiting his control over the fire.</p><p>However, by integrating the Infernal Fire into the Mani Pearl to activate the Gan Fire Shield, the main consumption would be true energy, reducing the strain on his consciousness.  He could retract the Mani Pearl before his consciousness reached its limit without consequence.</p><p>The flames shielded him, isolating him from the external force.  His body returned to normal.</p><p>*Puff!*</p><p>The bloody claw pierced the Infernal Fire.</p><p>At that moment, the Diamond Heaven Armor Seal, the Separating Light, and the Gan Fire Shield activated simultaneously. The Returning Wind Armor stood ready, along with the vital Wood Spirit body.  Qin Sang wondered what kind of opponent could even injure him!</p><p>Li Hou's eyes widened in disbelief. Qin Sang was hiding other defensive treasures.</p><p>*Puff! Puff! Puff!*</p><p>The bloody claws lashed out repeatedly.</p><p>The flames flickered.</p><p>Qin Sang, enveloped in flames, remained unharmed, deflecting all of Li Hou's attacks.</p><p>Li Hou realized it couldn't injure Qin Sang.  Its only option was to escape.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>Li Hou transformed into a streak of blood, rushing towards the star sea.</p><p>Qin Sang, covered in Infernal Fire, transformed into a bolt of lightning, clinging to Li Hou, giving it no chance to escape.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>…</p><p>The man and beast battled from one end of the star sea to the other, seemingly traversing it countless times.  Li Hou's aura gradually weakened.</p><p>High above, the Sword Star trembled repeatedly, the star sea unable to maintain stability.  Gradually, both sensed something amiss. The tremors seemed to originate from outside.  There were other presences nearby, engaged in battle!</p><p>Someone was approaching!</p><p>Li Hou, already despairing, was overjoyed and, disregarding everything, desperately charged outwards.</p><p>Qin Sang coldly glanced at it, suddenly transforming into a thunderbolt, appearing before Li Hou. A flash of killing intent filled his eyes as he plunged a needle, thin as a hair, into Li Hou.</p><p>The Heaven-Crushing Soul-Destroying Needle!</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>The needle struck Li Hou's wound, its potent poison erupting instantly.  Despite Li Hou's robust physique, its eyes clouded with gray, its body momentarily stiffening.</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>Starlight converged; sword light descended from the heavens.</p><p>Qin Sang grabbed Li Hou's head with one hand and its body with the other, twisting them forcefully.</p><p>*Crack!*</p><p>Bones shattered.</p><p>Sword light pierced through Qin Sang's fingers.</p><p>Life extinguished.</p>
