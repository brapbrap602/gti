<h1>Chapter 152: The Yuan Ying Tribulation</h1><p>Chapter 152: The Yuan Ying Tribulation</p><p>The Deer Demon King is dead.</p><p>Two Demon Kings are severely wounded.</p><p>Others suffered injuries to varying degrees.</p><p>The crossing of the swamp resulted in heavy losses.</p><p>The edge of the swamp connects to another high mountain range.</p><p>Standing at the foot of the mountain and looking up, it appears similar to the previous one—a bare, rocky mountain, its peak shrouded in mist.  King Jiao felt a sense of oppression, a foreboding.</p><p>To find the dragon corpse, they must traverse the mountain range.</p><p>After careful consideration, he turned and said, "Jiu Feng, please protect us.  Let the others quickly heal their wounds. Hei and I will see if there's a path we can take around."</p><p>King Jiao and the broad-backed man circled the base of the mountain.</p><p>The range was exceptionally vast, mountains stretching as far as the eye could see.</p><p>After bypassing several peaks, they finally spotted a cliff. Between two mountains was a deep, winding path leading to the other side of the range.</p><p>After consulting, the two demons entered the path one after another, carefully navigating it, and safely reached the other side.</p><p>Surprisingly, the space here was stable, with sparse spatial fissures, allowing a direct view of the celestial barrier above.</p><p>The two sides of the mountain range were like two different spaces.</p><p>At the foot of the mountain lay a barren, rocky beach, devoid of vegetation, with a faint gray mist hanging in the air. Compared to the gloomy swamp, it was almost bright.</p><p>Apart from some hills, no higher peaks were visible.</p><p>It was open and empty.</p><p>"This is…"</p><p>King Jiao began to speak, but suddenly his expression tightened, and a layer of black qi inexplicably appeared on his face.</p><p>Instantly, King Jiao's face turned as black as the bottom of a pot.</p><p>"Not good! Poison!"</p><p>King Jiao exclaimed, quickly forming a hand seal and pressing it to his chest.  He employed some secret technique; golden light shone from his palm, condensing into a small golden dragon that entered his body.</p><p>The golden light quickly spread throughout his body.</p><p>King Jiao spat out a puff of black air, but it vanished before his eyes.</p><p>The broad-backed man, alerted, realized he had also inhaled the poison and similarly used a secret technique to refine the venom.</p><p>"A colorless and odorless poison!"</p><p>King Jiao's expression was grave. "This is the Ghost Valley!"</p><p>…</p><p>Trial Realm.</p><p>After Elder Ye and the others left for some time, Qin Sang returned to the Stone Peak Treasure Pavilion.</p><p>The treasures had already been divided.</p><p>Entering the pavilion, he was instantly transported to the inner hall, before the cliff wall.</p><p>Qin Sang immediately concealed himself and his aura, observing his surroundings to confirm no one else was present, before retrieving a topographical map from his Qianjun Ring.</p><p>This map came from Ning Wu Hui and was more detailed than what he had personally discovered.</p><p>"There…"</p><p>Qin Sang compared it to the terrain, locating his position, and then swiftly moved towards the meeting point agreed upon with Ning Wu Hui.</p><p>He had delayed quite a while fulfilling his promise to Su Nu, unsure how long Ning Wu Hui had been waiting.</p><p>The area near the inner hall entrance, where the beasts had been hunted and the most dangerous ancient prohibitions had been broken by their predecessors, was the safest place in the entire inner hall.</p><p>Qin Sang traveled while observing the environment of the inner hall.</p><p>"Not as good as Zi Wei Palace!"</p><p>This was Qin Sang's assessment of the Seven Killing Hall.</p><p>In Zi Wei Palace, except for several places like Tian Shan, Foundation Establishment cultivators could explore.  The Seven Killing Hall was demonstrably more dangerous.</p><p>Furthermore, Zi Wei Palace was lush with vegetation and vibrant with life, while the Seven Killing Hall felt only deathly still.</p><p>He looked up, gazing at the celestial barrier.</p><p>The rosy glow obscured everything.</p><p>If the ancient teleportation array was in the inner hall, how did he pass through the celestial barrier, fall from above the Celestial Tower, and then be transported away? Did Senior Qingzhu interfere, or was there another reason?</p><p>"Could the ancient teleportation array be inside the celestial barrier?"</p><p>Qin Sang muttered to himself.</p><p>He bypassed several peaks, noticing flickering prohibition lights on some mountains, indicating others were breaking prohibitions to search for treasures.</p><p>Before long, Qin Sang arrived at the back mountain of a peak.</p><p>Their agreed meeting place was in a secluded mountain hollow, a stone pavilion behind the peak.</p><p>The pavilion was ancient and weathered.</p><p>He found the pavilion without difficulty, but Ning Wu Hui was not there.</p><p>Qin Sang dashed inside, but found no markings. He and Ning Wu Hui had agreed that if either encountered an emergency and had to leave, they would leave a mark to inform the other.</p><p>"Ning Wu Hui hasn't arrived yet!"</p><p>Qin Sang was surprised.</p><p>He had already been delayed for a long time; unexpectedly, Ning Wu Hui was even later!</p><p>"Could they have been trapped in the Trial Realm?"</p><p>Thinking of the Thousand Mountains Formation in the third level, Qin Sang couldn't help but worry.</p><p>With Ning Wu Hui's strength, barring any unforeseen circumstances, they should have the ability to participate in the Soul Cleansing Liquid competition; at the very least, they should be among the first cultivators to reach the Treasure Pavilion.</p><p>Ning Wuhu, who didn't participate in the Soul Cleansing Liquid contest, hasn't yet emerged from the trial grounds.</p><p>If he's not good at dealing with illusion formations, being trapped in the Thousand Mountains Formation would be bad.</p><p>Qin Sang felt uneasy, but considering that besides the Soul Cleansing Liquid and magical artifacts, the trial grounds also have rare spiritual herbs unavailable outside, he might have other goals.</p><p>"Forget it, I've overexerted myself, my true energy isn't fully recovered yet. I'll recover while waiting for him."</p><p>Without Ning Wuhu, Qin Sang couldn't do anything, so he patiently set up an isolating restriction in the stone pavilion, holding a spirit stone and cultivating.</p><p>Soon, Qin Sang's true energy was full, fully restored.</p><p>He opened his eyes, still not seeing Ning Wuhu, so he took out the Soul Cleansing Liquid from his Qianjun Ring.</p><p>Qin Sang activated his divine sense, carefully feeling the medicinal power of the Soul Cleansing Liquid. His primordial spirit felt extremely comfortable, as if it contained abundant soul power.</p><p>Taking the Soul Cleansing Liquid should greatly enhance divine sense; it wasn't an exaggeration.</p><p>"Soul Cleansing Liquid, Nine Illusion Sky Orchid, life-bound insect Gu..."</p><p>Qin Sang envisioned the future.</p><p>Even if he couldn't return to Xiao Han Domain, forming his Nascent Soul wasn't hopeless.  There shouldn't be any obstacles.</p><p>He could start considering how to overcome the Nascent Soul Tribulation.</p><p>However, Qin Sang reconsidered; his tribulation would be much easier than others'.</p><p>The Nascent Soul Tribulation, including the Three Calamities and the Heart Demon Tribulation, the most frightening isn't the Three Calamities, but the Heart Demon Tribulation!</p><p>When cultivators are nearing the end of their strength, facing the intangible Heart Demon Tribulation, they are even more helpless. Countless cultivators have failed and perished because they couldn't overcome the Heart Demon Tribulation.</p><p>The Jade Buddha protects.</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't afraid of the Heart Demon Tribulation, and he had two top-grade magical artifacts; he had some resistance against the Three Calamities. He only needed to collect some auxiliary tribulation-passing arrays and pills, and refine some necessary tribulation-passing treasures.</p><p>The Nascent Soul Tribulation terrified countless cultivators, but Qin Sang wasn't that worried.</p><p>As long as he could smoothly cultivate to the peak of the Core Formation stage, breaking through the bottleneck, forming his Nascent Soul would be effortless!</p><p>As he was daydreaming, he suddenly sensed a fluctuation, his expression shifted slightly. He put away the Soul Cleansing Liquid, removed the restriction, and went out of the stone pavilion.</p><p>"Daoist Ning!"</p><p>The visitor was Ning Wuhu.</p><p>"Ning is late, keeping Daoist Qin waiting," Ning Wuhu landed before Qin Sang, bowed slightly, and apologized.</p><p>A flash of strangeness crossed Qin Sang's eyes.</p><p>He vaguely felt that Ning Wuhu seemed a little different than before, but he didn't know why.</p>
