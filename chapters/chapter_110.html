<h1>Chapter 103: Clouds on Green Mountains, Water in the Sky (Seeking Subscriptions!)</h1><p>The four descended the mountain and arrived at the capital of a prosperous nation.</p><p>Qin Sang retrieved all the gold and silver from his mustard seed pouch and gave it to Song Ying. This alone was enough to make her a wealthy individual.  After everything was settled, Song Ying accompanied Qin Sang back to Moon Inquiry Market, arriving at the Song family's ancestral graves.</p><p>Retrieving the Sword Intent Decree required not only Song family blood but also a unique talisman.</p><p>Qin Sang accepted the talisman from Song Ying, took a drop of her blood, and infused it with spiritual energy. The talisman then floated up and merged into the tomb of the Song family ancestor.</p><p>A moment later, the tomb cracked open, and a green light shot out.</p><p>Qin Sang reached out and caught the green light in his palm, discovering it was a small sword talisman.</p><p>Was this Shaohua Mountain's Sword Intent Decree?</p><p>Qin Sang curiously probed it with his divine sense. The sword talisman trembled slightly, its light intensified, and an incredibly sharp aura erupted. Qin Sang's face paled slightly. No longer daring to probe, he held the talisman and said to Song Ying, "Please accompany me to Shaohua Mountain again."</p><p>Qin Sang steered his Flying Sky Shuttle, carrying Song Ying towards Shaohua Mountain's gate.</p><p>Previously, he had only glimpsed it from afar. Now, approaching Shaohua Mountain, he discovered the gate was also shrouded in mist, sealed by a grand formation.</p><p>He didn't dare to barge in recklessly. He landed with Song Ying at the formation's edge, sent the sword talisman into the formation, and waited patiently.</p><p>Before long, a streak of light shot out from the formation, paused mid-air, and flew straight towards them, revealing the figure of a white-haired elder.</p><p>A Foundation Establishment cultivator!</p><p>Qin Sang's heart was filled with awe, and his expression became even more respectful.</p><p>The white-haired elder looked at the two, his gaze finally settling on Qin Sang. He asked, "Were you the one who sent in the Sword Intent Decree?"</p><p>Qin Sang bowed and said, "Reporting to Senior, it was this disciple."</p><p>The white-haired elder nodded. "Are you both descendants of the Song family?"</p><p>"This disciple is called Qin Sang, and I am not a Song descendant," Qin Sang said, pointing to Song Ying beside him. "This young lady is called Song Ying, and she is of Song family bloodline."</p><p>The white-haired elder frowned slightly and said to Song Ying, "Raise your hand."</p><p>After verifying Song Ying's blood and the Sword Intent Decree, the white-haired elder suddenly said in a deep voice, "Miss Song, what is your relationship with him? Why did you give the Sword Intent Decree to an outsider? Did he force you?"</p><p>Qin Sang was startled and was about to speak, but the white-haired elder glanced at him coldly. The murderous look sent a chill down Qin Sang's spine, and he lowered his head, not daring to utter another word.</p><p>Song Ying bowed and said calmly, "Reporting to Immortal, Qin Sang did not force me. On the contrary, he helped me in Moon Inquiry Market and resolved my predicament. Now, I am the only remaining Song descendant and willingly give the Sword Intent Decree to him."</p><p>Qin Sang secretly breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p>The white-haired elder was still uneasy and said earnestly, "You don't need to be afraid, nor worry about threats from others. Since you have come to the mountain gate, if you have any grievances, just tell me, and Shaohua Mountain will uphold justice for you."</p><p>Song Ying shook her head firmly. "Immortal, everything I said before is true. It was entirely my own will."</p><p>The white-haired elder's expression finally softened. "Since you willingly gave the Sword Intent Decree, you cannot go back on your word. Do you understand?"</p><p>Song Ying agreed. The white-haired elder gently raised his hand, and a cloud formed in his palm, transforming into a Green Luan. He said to Song Ying, "Ride on it; it will take you down the mountain."</p><p>Qin Sang bowed farewell. "Miss Song, until we meet again."</p><p>After sending Song Ying off, the two entered the formation.</p><p>Inside, the scenery changed dramatically. A peculiar peak came into view, as if split in half by a sword, forming a narrow passage. Peach trees grew on both slopes, now in full bloom, covering the mountain like a red carpet. Peach blossoms fluttered like butterflies, filling the air with a delightful fragrance. The scenery was breathtaking.</p><p>Qin Sang followed the white-haired elder through the mountain and saw some young women playing among the peach trees, laughing and carefree.</p><p>These would be his senior and junior sisters from now on, Qin Sang thought.</p><p>Seeing the two's flying light, the women stopped smiling and looked at Qin Sang curiously. Then, they bowed to the elder, saying in unison, "Greetings, Elder Wen."</p><p>The white-haired elder nodded cheerfully, his attitude much kinder than towards Qin Sang.</p><p>Passing through this mountain, their view opened up.</p><p>The blue sky and white clouds, the vast expanse of water stretched as far as the eye could see, and dozens of sword-like peaks dotted the landscape.</p><p>Below, the water rippled gently. Flocks of cranes soared through the air, countless koi carp splashed in the water, and occasionally, cultivators flew by on their magical instruments, exchanging greetings.</p><p>Seeing the scene at the Shaohua Mountain gate, Qin Sang was reminded of a poem from his previous life, finding it perfectly fitting.</p><p>"Someone asked me about Penglai, the clouds rest on the green mountains, the water reflects the sky."</p><p>……</p><p>The two landed on the largest, yet most unremarkable mountain of Shaohua, and entered a wooden hall. After checking Qin Sang's spiritual roots, Elder Wen looked surprised. "Five Element Spiritual Roots? For your age, your cultivation level isn't low, but the chances of you reaching Foundation Establishment are slim. Are you sure you want to use the Sword Intent Decree?"</p><p>Qin Sang was stunned. "Can I pass it on to my descendants?"</p><p>Elder Wen glanced at him. "It's not unprecedented. I can replace the blood of the Song family ancestor with yours. If any of your descendants possess exceptional talent in the future, they can enter Shaohua Mountain with the Sword Intent Decree."</p><p>Qin Sang took a deep breath and resolutely said, "Thank you, Elder Wen, but no.  My heart is set on the path of immortality, unwavering!"</p><p>Elder Wen didn't try to persuade him further. He took some of Qin Sang’s blood and made it into a waist token, then called a disciple over to arrange Qin Sang's entry into the sect.</p><p>The entry procedures were largely similar to those at Yuanzhao Sect. This senior brother was surnamed Zhuang, only a year older than Qin Sang, but his cultivation had already reached the tenth level of Qi Refinement. He said he had already received a Foundation Establishment Pill and was preparing to attempt the breakthrough.</p><p>There was a rule in Shaohua Mountain: disciples who reached the tenth level of Qi Refinement before the age of forty would receive a Foundation Establishment Pill for free.</p><p>This was a pleasant surprise for Qin Sang, but he also understood that with his talent, relying on a single Foundation Establishment Pill wouldn’t be enough to break through at the tenth level of Qi Refinement.  He would need to cultivate further, raising his level to the peak of Qi Refinement, to have a better chance.</p><p>"Junior Brother Qin, this mountain is called Daomen Peak, symbolizing that upon entering, one dedicates oneself to the immortal path. Remember not to be seduced by the mortal world and delay your cultivation."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded in agreement. Senior Brother Zhuang explained that Daomen Peak and the surrounding peaks were where the entry-level disciples of Shaohua Mountain cultivated. The sect's elders and senior disciples also conducted their teachings on Daomen Peak.</p><p>"Do you see that up ahead?"</p><p>Qin Sang mounted the flying sword issued by Shaohua Mountain and followed Senior Brother Zhuang as they flew off Daomen Peak. Senior Brother Zhuang pointed to the Peach Blossom Mountain at the forefront, a hint of longing in his eyes.  "That is Jianmen Pass. It was created by a senior with a single sword strike."</p>
