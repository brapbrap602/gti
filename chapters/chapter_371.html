<h1>Chapter 364: The Qingyang Demon Sect</h1><p>Chapter 364: The Qingyang Demon Sect</p><p>Qin Sang prepared everything he needed and first went to the Earth-Sinking Cave to retrieve the living corpse.</p><p>After a period of nurturing by the baleful aura, the living corpse's energy sea had fully recovered. Qin Sang found a secluded spot, summoned the living corpse, and tested its strength.</p><p>Although the living corpse's original body was Liang Yan, its abilities were limited, and the earth-slaying aura couldn't be replenished during battle.  Its power was inferior to a true Foundation Establishment Mid-stage cultivator, but far surpassed a corpse puppet.</p><p>A Foundation Establishment Early-stage cultivator encountering this living corpse would need to be extremely cautious.  A single misstep could result in injury, the spread of corpse poison, and a fate similar to that of Senior Sister Qingting.</p><p>Qin Sang was very satisfied. After collecting the magic weapon from Shopkeeper Wu, he mounted the Youluo Cloud and flew directly eastward towards the Sky-Severing Mountain.</p><p>Less than a month later, Qin Sang entered Sky-Severing Mountain and arrived near the Tian Shi Sect branch. Three major spirit veins converged here, with a unique and mysterious geography, likely already claimed as a cave abode by some senior cultivator from Mount Shaohua.</p><p>Qin Sang had no desire to revisit this place, but recalling past experiences and people like Senior Sister Qingting and Yu Da Yue, his flight paused momentarily. He glanced towards the Tian Shi Cave before turning northeast.</p><p>Due to the Pure Yang Sect's deterrence, the Demon Sect forces either migrated north, hid deep within Sky-Severing Mountain, or maintained an extremely low profile.  Initially, Qin Sang rarely encountered any Demon Cultivators.</p><p>Upon entering the Demon Sect's heartland, Qin Sang's appearance changed dramatically.</p><p>He now wore a hooded cloak and a black robe. His aura was normal, unlike the chilling aura of Demon Sect cultivators, but he carried a black coffin on his back.</p><p>This black coffin was the simplest corpse-raising artifact described in the *Heavenly Yin Corpse Manual*.</p><p>Corpse puppet bags were extremely difficult to refine; most Tian Shi Sect disciples could only use such black coffins.</p><p>Besides storing and nurturing corpses, the black coffin had no other abilities and wasn't complex to refine.  After obtaining the jade slip from Shopkeeper Wu, Qin Sang managed to refine one after a few attempts.</p><p>The black coffin contained a corpse puppet, with a faint corpse aura emanating from it. This served as Qin Sang's disguise; no one could say he didn't look like a Demon Cultivator.</p><p>As Qin Sang acted discreetly and focused on his journey, he encountered no trouble along the way, finally arriving at their meeting point by the agreed-upon time.</p><p>Wuyaya Valley.</p><p>It was said that all the violent and murderous auras in the world converged here. The valley's murderous aura gave birth to countless blood demon creatures, and many Yin beasts and demonic creatures lurked within, influenced to become ferocious and bloodthirsty.</p><p>However, the most terrifying things were not these demons and beasts, but the ubiquitous ancient restrictions within the valley. Some restrictions were even more terrifying than spatial rifts.</p><p>Even more terrifying was the fact that in some places, spatial rifts and ancient restrictions were intertwined, forcing even Nascent Soul cultivators to detour. It was one of the most dangerous places in Sky-Severing Mountain.</p><p>The valley was divided into three levels.</p><p>Most cultivators could only operate on the first level.</p><p>Entering the second level required at least Foundation Establishment cultivation. Even then, in the vast Wuyaya Valley, they only dared to follow the few already explored paths, always remaining vigilant—a single mistake meant certain death.</p><p>Countless cultivators were buried here.</p><p>As for the third level, the inner valley of Wuyaya Valley, it could no longer be described simply as "dangerous." Every step was a deadly trap, a hopeless situation!</p><p>Qin Sang learned all this from a Demon Sect market town called Qingyang Market.</p><p>Qingyang Market was some distance from Wuyaya Valley, but it was quite famous.  The Demon Sect it belonged to, the Qingyang Demon Sect, was renowned in the Xiaohan Region.</p><p>The reason was that Qingyang City, one of the seven mighty passes of the Ancient Immortal Battlefield, was named after a founder of the Qingyang Demon Sect!</p><p>The Qingyang Demon Sect's most famous ability, the Qingyang Demon Fire, was not only incredibly powerful, terrifying their enemies, but its origins were also extremely unique. It was said to be a type of magic fire cultivated by a secret method of the Qingyang Demon Sect, using the Qingyang Divine Gang, one of the Nine Heavens' Heavenly Gang Qi.</p><p>Above the nine heavens, Heavenly Gang winds raged, soul-eroding and bone-chilling.</p><p>The higher one went, the more terrifying the wind's power became.  Let alone the Qingyang Demon Sect's disciples, even Nascent Soul cultivators couldn't traverse the wind belt to collect the Heavenly Gang Qi from the nine heavens.</p><p>A Qingyang Demon Sect ancestor obtained a secret method and searched the cultivation world until he finally found the Qingyang Gang Essence, formed from the descending Heavenly Gang Qi, on a mountain—the current location of the Qingyang Demon Sect's mountain gate.</p><p>Overjoyed, he used this as the foundation to establish his sect.</p><p>Today, the Qingyang Demon Sect may not be as prosperous as it once was, but it is still a powerful force among the Demon Sects of Sky-Severing Mountain. In particular, the mountain gate array of the Qingyang Demon Sect is something even a Nascent Soul cultivator wouldn't want to provoke.</p><p>Having learned about Wuyagu Valley from the Qingyang Demon Sect, Qin Sang understood why Yunyouzi had arranged to meet at the Qingyang Demon Sect.</p><p>Wuyagu Valley is perpetually shrouded in a poisonous, freezing blood miasma due to the presence of fierce, bloody煞 energy within.  Cultivators cannot use their spiritual energy to resist the miasma directly; they must find alternative methods.</p><p>The Qingyang Demon Sect's Qingyang Demon Fire has a counteracting effect on the blood miasma.  The sect refines a strand of the demon fire into artifacts sold to cultivators entering the valley – the best protection available.</p><p>Despite being a demon sect market, it wasn't much different from other markets Qin Sang had seen. Cultivators there adhered to the rules set by the Qingyang Demon Sect, and didn't readily resort to violence.</p><p>He had already removed the black coffin and was awaiting Yunyouzi.  In the meantime, Qin Sang explored the Qingyang market, focusing on demon sects known for their expertise in corpse refinement, hoping to find clues. However, he didn't discover any sect connected to the Tianshi Sect.</p><p>Returning to his rented courtyard, Qin Sang cultivated for a while.  Awakening from meditation, he frowned.  The appointed time was approaching, yet Yunyouzi had not appeared.</p><p>Had something delayed him?</p><p>At that moment, Qin Sang sensed his courtyard's protective barrier being activated.</p><p>Alert, he swept his spiritual sense outward and found Yunyouzi at the gate, his relief evident. He quickly rose to greet him.</p><p>"I followed the markings you left, Qin Laodi. I apologize for keeping you waiting!"</p><p>Yunyouzi was dusty and travel-worn, showing he hadn't rested on the journey. Entering the courtyard, he apologized to Qin Sang.  "I began preparations immediately upon returning to my sect, but one essential item was extremely difficult to refine. I failed twice, nearly exhausting my materials before finally succeeding.  I was fortunate! Extremely fortunate!"</p><p>"It's good that you have everything prepared, senior…" Qin Sang hadn't waited long, and his time in the Qingyang market hadn't been wasted.</p><p>They entered the room and sat.</p><p>Yunyouzi immediately asked, "How long have you been here, Qin Laodi? You must know the purpose of the Qingyang Demon Fire, yes?"</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, taking two jade pendants from his pouch.</p><p>"I bought two of the best quality ones.  Should that be sufficient?"</p>
