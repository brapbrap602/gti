<h1>Chapter 1180: The Obsidian Towers</h1><p>After years of relentless warfare, the cultivators from both regions had been tempered through countless trials. The grand camp was a flurry of movement, with streaks of light crisscrossing the sky, yet there was no sign of chaos. Everything was orderly and disciplined.</p><p>Soon, the battle formations were fully assembled, standing ready and vigilant. The camp was eerily silent, exuding an aura of solemnity and impending bloodshed. Every individual here had weathered the storms of war, their spirits honed by the relentless grind of battle.</p><p>Qin Sang stood atop a high tower, gazing down at the scene below. His thoughts drifted back to the great battle at Yun Cang Marsh. Back then, he, like those below, had been nothing more than a pawn on the chessboard. From the perspective of a Nascent Soul Patriarch, that battle had seemed almost trivial. Both sides had only deployed a limited number of Golden Core cultivators. The cause of the conflict had been absurdâ€”so many lives had been lost over a bet between the Nascent Souls of the two regions, deciding who would provide the spiritual materials for a formation. Perhaps there had been some intention to temper their disciples through the ordeal.</p><p>This time, however, was different. The Nascent Souls themselves had taken to the field, and the conflict had spread across three regions and the Heavenly Demon Hills. This was a true battle for survival!</p><p>As the cultivators gathered, the grand formation began to shift. The cold mist at the periphery silently rolled toward the center, and the power of the Frost Bell Formation contracted, its range shrinking by more than half.</p><p>Si Di stood at the forefront of the battle formation, his gaze cold and stern as he looked outward. After a moment, he suddenly raised his hand and gave the signal. The battle formation began to move!</p><p>Si Di was the core of the entire formation, while the other Golden Core cultivators each commanded a small squad, most of which were composed of Foundation Establishment cultivators. Squad after squad of cultivators flew in orderly fashion toward the edge of the Frost Bell Formation.</p><p>The composition of each squad was not based solely on the cultivators' cultivation levels or their sects. Instead, it was determined by their cultivation techniques and their mastery of the Five Elements Dao Arts. This careful arrangement allowed for seamless cooperation, enabling them to unleash their full combat potential.</p><p>Some of the cultivators wore armor, while others wielded various peculiar artifacts. It was clear that these were standardized equipment, designed for specific purposes in the grand battle.</p><p>Qin Sang had rarely experienced such a large-scale battle, and given his apparent status as an outsider, he refrained from asking too many questions. He simply observed quietly.</p><p>Before long, the cultivators disappeared into the cold mist.</p><p>This was the battlefield Si Di had chosen. The cold mist was a manifestation of the Frost Bell Formation. Their side was equipped with special artifacts that shielded them from the mist's effects, while the enemy would be subjected to various restrictions. Additionally, by standing within the formation, those controlling it could swiftly alter its configuration and provide support as needed.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Ming Yue, it's time for us to move as well," Jing Lin whispered.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, activating a secret technique to conceal his aura and form. Together with Jing Lin, he flew out from the high tower, quietly making his way toward the center of the battlefield from the edge.</p><p>For now, the area outside the Frost Bell Formation was calm.</p><p>The terrain of the Triple Pass was low in the middle and high on both sides. Their position was at the exit above the Triple Pass, allowing them to easily detect any anomalies below.</p><p>The winter wind was as sharp as a blade, especially on the Skywalk Plateau. The landscape was blanketed in silver, but it would soon be stained with blood.</p><p>Qin Sang and Jing Lin concealed themselves on a high vantage point.</p><p>As they had discussed earlier, due to the limited time, they couldn't afford to be too far from the battlefield. To ensure safety, they had carefully set up a concealment formation to evade the enemy's detection as much as possible.</p><p>Qin Sang noticed that Si Di had sent out scouts.</p><p>There was still no sign of the Sin Abyss army.</p><p>However, as cultivators, the cold was of little concern. Everyone simply rested in place, waiting.</p><p>Time passed slowly.</p><p>"Still no news from Stone Song Mountain?" Qin Sang asked Jing Lin after staring outward for a while.</p><p>Upon detecting unusual movements from the Sin Abyss, they had promptly gathered their forces and reported the situation.</p><p>Jing Lin nodded. "If the Sin Abyss were to attack, they wouldn't focus solely on our Triple Pass. Stone Song Mountain still needs to gather information from all fronts to assess the situation. It's impossible for them to act so quickly..."</p><p>As he spoke, a sudden streak of light rushed into the formation, followed by messages and talismans flying in from all directions like snowflakes.</p><p>Seeing this, there was no need to look further to know that something was happening.</p><p>Qin Sang and Jing Lin exchanged a glance, then fully activated the concealment formation, holding their breath.</p><p>Qin Sang quietly awakened the Heavenly Eye Butterfly, instructing it to activate its Heavenly Eye ability to monitor the approaching enemy. If the Sin Abyss had hidden any treasures or individuals, they would be no match for the Heavenly Eye Butterfly.</p><p>'Boom...'</p><p>At Si Di's command, the war drums suddenly began to thunder.</p><p>The sound was deafening.</p><p>They had even resorted to using mortal war tactics, but it had to be admitted that the effect was excellent. The majestic drumbeats invigorated everyone, filling them with fervor and determination.</p><p>At that moment, dark shadows began to appear at the edge of their vision.</p><p>The scouts from both sides had clashed first. After a brief skirmish, several streaks of light returned to the formation. The Sin Abyss forces stopped some distance away from the formation, observing for a moment before turning back.</p><p>After this brief encounter, more and more shadows appeared in their line of sight.</p><p>A massive, dark army was advancing.</p><p>The figures at the forefront could now be vaguely seen.</p><p>The Frost Domain, the Skywalk Alliance, and the Sin Abyss occupied the northern and eastern regions of the North Star Realm, forming a narrow strip of land with almost no desert barriers in between.</p><p>The three factions were originally connected, all being human territories. In fact, many years ago, they might have even belonged to the same faction, without such clear divisions.</p><p>The methods employed by both sides were largely similar.</p><p>The Sin Abyss cultivators wore similar armor and wielded similar artifacts. The most notable difference was that at the center of the Sin Abyss formation stood three black crystal towers.</p><p>The towers were made of a material resembling black crystal, each only three stories high, with no doors or windows, though there were carvings resembling such features. At the top of each tower was a spherical crystal, made of the same material.</p><p>Each tower stood nearly three zhang tall, and from the outside, they appeared identical.</p><p>Perhaps due to the material, no runes or inscriptions could be seen on the towers from a distance.</p><p>Marching across the snowy terrain, the towering crystal structures stood out prominently among the army. Each tower was accompanied by several cultivators who carried it, advancing with the troops.</p><p>The Sin Abyss clearly placed great importance on these towers, as all three were positioned deep within their formation, heavily guarded.</p><p>Seeing the towers, Jing Lin's expression darkened. "Three Obsidian Towers! When three of these towers are deployed, they must be controlled by a Nascent Soul. It seems Old Demon Tan and Old Demon Pei have truly committed their full forces!"</p><p>The two he referred to were the Nascent Souls of the Sin Abyss. It was these two who had led the army in their previous confrontations, frequently harassing their side but never gaining the upper hand.</p><p>Jing Lin's tone was far from friendly when speaking of the enemy.</p><p>"So these are the Sin Abyss's Obsidian Towers?" Qin Sang stared intently at the three towers.</p><p>Although he had read about them in the intelligence reports, this was his first time seeing them in person.</p><p>Seeing is believing, hearing is not.</p><p>Facing the Obsidian Towers directly, Qin Sang felt an inexplicable sense of discomfort, though he couldn't pinpoint the reason.</p><p>According to the records, these artifacts were unlike ordinary magical treasures. They were specialized tools designed specifically for use in large-scale battles.</p><p>"Indeed, these are the Obsidian Towers! Fortunately, these towers come with significant limitations. The Sin Abyss can't use them recklessly, or we'd be running ourselves ragged, unsure of how to fight..." Jing Lin sighed with a mix of relief and apprehension.</p>
