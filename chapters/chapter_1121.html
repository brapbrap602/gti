<h1>Chapter 1113: North Sea</h1><p>Three were buried together.</p><p>Qin Sang and Qing Jun stood before the tomb, burning incense and paying respects.</p><p>"Senior Sister, you haven't let go?"</p><p>Qin Sang turned and asked.</p><p>A short while ago, he and Qing Jun had a casual conversation, and he learned about the reason for her strained relationship with Elder Qing Zhu.</p><p>"If I couldn't let go, how could I have reached my current cultivation level?"</p><p>Qing Jun smiled calmly.</p><p>"When I was a teenager, I hated him intensely.</p><p>"He was obsessed with cultivation, wholeheartedly focused on avenging his mother, almost driven mad.  From birth, it was only my mother and I who depended on each other.</p><p>"I thought he treated my mother as a replacement for his own mother, trying to make up for the loss. I hated him for not loving my mother, yet causing more harm by bringing me into the world.</p><p>"But, when I was in my fifties, after many years of experience in the cultivation world, I came to understand his perspective. Although I still felt wronged for my mother, I gradually found peace.</p><p>"By the time I reached a hundred, even several hundred years old, that period of time was just a small part of my life, all the past just memories, my heart no longer stirred by it.</p><p>"My vow to kill Leng Yuntian was primarily for my mother.</p><p>"Entering the immortal path, if others can keep up with my pace, perhaps we can meet and laugh, share a drink. If not, they are simply passersby in my life.</p><p>"He was just one who came earlier, with a special status.</p><p>"That's all."</p><p>Qing Jun turned and walked towards the small courtyard.</p><p>Qin Sang was silent, lost in thought.</p><p>"If you plan to stay in Peach Blossom Valley to cultivate, as long as you don't damage the peach orchard, you can choose any location on either side of the mountain to carve out a cave dwelling…"</p><p>Qing Jun's voice came.</p><p>"Thank you, Senior Sister."</p><p>Qin Sang looked around.</p><p>This place was far safer than Yun Youzi's cave dwelling, and the spiritual energy was far more abundant. Qin Sang decided to send a message to Li Yu Fu, and stay in Peach Blossom Valley to cultivate from now on.</p><p>Next to him was a peach tree laden with fruit.</p><p>Qin Sang passed under the tree and picked one.</p><p>'Crack!'</p><p>He took a large bite.</p><p>Indeed, it was sweet, yet with a hint of sourness, a unique flavor.</p><p>In Qin Sang's opinion, the taste was slightly inferior to that of the one in the Netherworld Valley, and far worse than the one at Sword Gate Pass.</p><p>However, this was the most beautiful taste in Elder Qing Zhu's memory.</p><p>Qin Sang savored it slowly, standing still for a long time.</p><p>After walking around Peach Blossom Valley, Qin Sang found a small waterfall on one of the slopes, quite exquisite and suitable for quiet cultivation.</p><p>He quickly carved out a simple cave dwelling.</p><p>Thinking about today's unexpected encounter, it was truly surprising.</p><p>Of course, Qin Sang remained calm.</p><p>The terms 'senior sister' and 'junior brother' were merely titles. As Qing Jun said, if he failed to form his Nascent Soul and couldn't keep up with her, he would just be a passerby.</p><p>What surprised him was that Qing Jun wasn't interested in where he and Elder Qing Zhu had gone.</p><p>However, Qin Sang had been pondering this matter.</p><p>The Ziwei Palace and the Seven Killing Hall were frequently changing, and he wondered what the future would bring.</p><p>The overall strength of the cultivators in the Little Cold Region was far inferior to that of the Canglang Sea.</p><p>Furthermore, the teleportation array that allowed travel between the two regions could only be activated when the Ziwei Palace appeared, which was a significant limitation.</p><p>Even if he kept it hidden in his heart, and didn't tell anyone.</p><p>After forming his Nascent Soul, if he wanted to return to the Canglang Sea, whether to explore the Seven Killing Hall or obtain resources from both places, it would be difficult to accomplish alone, and he would need to find allies to cooperate with.</p><p>Yun Youzi and Qing Jun were both trustworthy choices.</p><p>After finishing his chores, Qin Sang returned to the wooden house and smelled a refreshing tea fragrance.</p><p>Smoke curled upwards.</p><p>Qing Jun was kneeling, her red skirt spread on the ground.</p><p>A small red clay stove, delicate hands preparing tea.</p><p>Sipping the spiritual tea poured by a Nascent Soul cultivator, Qin Sang felt a sense of unreality.</p><p>"I really don't know which one is the real her."</p><p>Qin Sang sighed inwardly.</p><p>"Do you remember Chen Yan?"</p><p>Qing Jun stirred the fire, glancing at Qin Sang.</p><p>"Of course, I remember."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, put down his teacup, and bowed slightly, "Back then, I was plotted against by Dongyang Bo, and it was related to her. In the Bronze Palace, it was also with her help that I managed to escape and avoid his clutches…"</p><p>From being sold into indentured servitude to build his foundation, to being used as a bargaining chip by Dongyang Bo to control Chen Yan in the black tower of Ziwei Palace.</p><p>Qin Sang calmly recounted the events.</p><p>Qing Jun must have already known about him being sold into indentured servitude to build his foundation.</p><p>"Oh?"</p><p>Qing Jun's eyes widened in surprise.  "I wondered why you, a mere False Core cultivator, managed to escape from under the noses of two Nascent Soul cultivators. So there's a hidden story!  According to you, Chen Yan and Dongyang Bo must have fallen out. But why, after leaving Ziwei Palace, did Chen Yan continue to serve Dongyang Bo for many years before leaving Mount Shaohua?"</p><p>Qin Sang pondered for a moment. "Something else must have happened later.  They probably made some kind of agreement.  Chen Yan wanted to save her master, and Dongyang Bo seemed to be plotting to obtain a treasure from the Bronze Hall. After I escaped, Dongyang Bo may have lacked other ways to threaten Chen Yan, so he compromised—it's not impossible."</p><p>Pausing, Qin Sang asked, "I remember Senior Sister mentioning that Chen Yan wasn't a Mount Shaohua disciple. Did she return to her hometown after leaving?  I wonder if she managed to rescue her master?"</p><p>"Her master is a late-stage Nascent Soul cultivator. If she really rescued him, Mount Shaohua wouldn't be in its current state.  With such strong support, resisting the Abyss would be much easier for the two realms."</p><p>Qing Jun shook her head. "As for Chen Yan, she vanished after leaving and is most likely not in the Beichen Realm."</p><p>"Not in the Beichen Realm? Could she be from another region?"</p><p>Before, Qin Sang's cultivation was low, and he lacked the strength to even leave the Xiao Han Region. He only had a vague understanding of the cultivation world.</p><p>As far as he knew, the Xiao Han Region, the Tianxing Alliance, and the Abyss were all located in a vast cultivation world called the Beichen Realm.</p><p>Strangely, very few legends from outside the Beichen Realm have ever circulated within it.</p><p>"Correct.  There are four regions in the North Sea, also known as the Four Islands of the North Sea.</p><p>"Our Beichen Realm is just one of them.</p><p>"The other three regions—though sometimes called islands—are actually connected, forming a landmass that's no smaller than a vast continent.</p><p>"Only our Beichen Realm is isolated overseas, separated by violent storms. While passage is possible, it's extremely dangerous; even Nascent Soul masters find it difficult to cross. That's why the Beichen Realm is rarely affected by the other three.</p><p>"Those three regions have numerous peak mid-Nascent Soul cultivators, and even Grand Masters. Their overall strength surpasses ours. Chen Yan definitely comes from one of those three regions, possibly from a major sect.</p><p>"What's strange is that even the strongest sects wouldn't ignore the disappearance of one of their Grand Masters. Her master has been trapped in Ziwei Palace for so long, and yet no one has come looking for him."</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang's lack of knowledge, Qing Jun briefly explained the Four Regions of the North Sea.</p><p>Storm belts again!</p><p>Hearing this familiar term, Qin Sang was unsurprised.</p><p>The Beichen Realm was very similar to the Canglang Sea and the Demon Sea; it too was a cage surrounded by storms.</p><p>However, the Beichen Realm could connect to the other three regions.  One could reach them by crossing the storm belts.</p><p>Furthermore, Qin Sang keenly noticed a problem: in the term "North Sea," what is the reference point for "North"?</p>
