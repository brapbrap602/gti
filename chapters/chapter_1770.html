<h1>Chapter 1761: Outer Teachings</h1><p>The Daoist's expression was calm.</p><p>“If fellow Daoist agrees, you need not do anything and will still receive my gratitude. Afterward, I will personally visit your esteemed sect to express my thanks. If fellow Daoist informs my adversaries, they will at most disrupt my plans, but they cannot detain me.  However, fellow Daoist will then have made a new enemy.  Which is more important, I believe fellow Daoist can weigh for yourself.”</p><p>“Are you threatening me?” Qin Sang's eyes narrowed.</p><p>The Daoist opened his mouth, about to say something, when his brows suddenly furrowed. His spirit sword vibrated, instantly unleashing eight consecutive slashes around him.</p><p>Eight streaks of sword light, incredibly sharp, extended only a foot from the Daoist before transforming into streams of sword energy.  Then, upon contact with the void, these countless strands of sword energy vanished without a trace, as if absorbed by some unknown force.</p><p>The Daoist stared at Qin Sang, his tone betraying no emotion. "Unexpectedly, fellow Daoist is also skilled in the art of poison. This poison is truly wondrous. Though I haven't encountered it before, I know that allowing it to enter my body would be perilous. Fortunately, I possess some mastery in the Dao of Sword Transformation, where one sword can embody myriad forms. Otherwise, it would have been difficult to detect."</p><p>His methods exposed, Qin Sang's expression remained unchanged, but inwardly, he was astonished.</p><p>The moment he sensed the ambush, he had activated the Poison Pearl, secretly releasing the poison. Derived from the essence of the Bloodthirsty Miasma Spirit, this poison was naturally extraordinary.</p><p>He hadn't expected it to be discovered so quickly.</p><p>Qin Sang sensed an intangible force within the poison, likely the Daoist's spirit sword, subtly merging with and even beginning to separate and absorb the toxic essence.</p><p>This poison originated from a Fifth Transformation Spirit Insect, albeit a deceased one.</p><p>The profundity of this person's swordsmanship was truly unprecedented in Qin Sang's experience. At least among Nascent Soul cultivators, he had never met anyone who could match him.</p><p>Perhaps Senior Qingzhu, if he hadn't perished and had cultivated to the peak of Nascent Soul, might have barely touched upon this realm.</p><p>This heightened Qin Sang's vigilance considerably.</p><p>The poison was actually a probe.</p><p>Qin Sang had already prepared the Heaven Severing Soul-Shaking Divine Needles, but after a moment of contemplation, he withdrew his divine ability and silently urged the Poison Pearl.</p><p>The poison in the void swiftly retreated.</p><p>If the divine needles missed, it would be a mutually destructive scenario.</p><p>Just because his opponent was momentarily preoccupied didn't mean they couldn't unleash their full power. Qin Sang knew that in his current state, he shouldn't engage in a life-or-death struggle with a peak expert.</p><p>If this was truly a misunderstanding, attacking without any apparent benefit would be unwise.</p><p>Besides this, Qin Sang had another concern.</p><p>The Star Valley was the place with the densest Star Yuan power he had found so far. Even if it couldn't directly facilitate his breakthrough, he could enlist someone's help to perform a ritual here in the future, increasing his chances of success.</p><p>He didn't yet know how the Star Valley was formed. If he and the Daoist fought unrestrainedly, they might destroy this precious location.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang withdraw his technique, the Daoist nodded with a smile. He formed a sword seal, and the spirit sword abruptly materialized from the void, emerging from an unknown location and flying into his sleeve.</p><p>Then, the Daoist flicked his finger, sending a streak of light toward Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang channeled his True Essence to catch it, discovering it was a golden token.</p><p>“If fellow Daoist seeks me, simply activate the restriction within this golden token at Crane Cry Mountain,” the Daoist briefly explained the token's usage and made an oath.</p><p>Qin Sang casually stored it in his Thousand Jun Ring, saying indifferently, “I fear that fellow Daoist may not possess what I seek.”</p><p>“Oh?”</p><p>The Daoist became intrigued. “Might I inquire as to what it is?”</p><p>Qin Sang scrutinized the Daoist, seemingly lost in thought. After a moment, he asked, “Dare I ask which esteemed sect fellow Daoist hails from?”</p><p>What did he want?</p><p>Undoubtedly, it was the Dharma!</p><p>In this realm, one needed the Dharma to cultivate.</p><p>With this Daoist's cultivation level, his status within his sect must be very high. Like the Profound Astral Sect, which only had one Soul Transformation Sect Master.</p><p>He wondered if this person had the authority to utilize the Sect Altar and bestow the Dharma upon outsiders.</p><p>The Daoist shook his head slightly. “It's not that I dare not reveal my origins before fellow Daoist… I belong to no sect.”</p><p>No sect?</p><p>Qin Sang frowned slightly. “Is fellow Daoist a Celestial Official of the Celestial Court?”</p><p>The Celestial Court’s influence was immense. What power he had never heard of would dare hunt down a Celestial Official?</p><p>“Who said I must be a member of the Daoist lineage?”</p><p>The Daoist countered.</p><p>He called himself a "poor Daoist" yet claimed not to be a member of the Daoist lineage. This sounded rather peculiar.</p><p>However, Qin Sang understood the meaning of his words. A term flashed through his mind—Rogue Cultivator!</p><p>There were rogue cultivators in this realm?</p><p>A spark of insight struck Qin Sang, realizing he might have fallen into a misconception.</p><p>Since arriving in this realm, the first cultivator he encountered was a Celestial Official. From Zhong Mao Zhi all the way here, everything he had seen and heard was under the control of the Celestial Court, perfectly ordered.</p><p>With the Six Heavens' Ancient Qi rampant in this realm, cultivation relied on the Dharma, even for demon cultivators. Qin Sang initially thought there was no room for rogue cultivators to survive.</p><p>The Daoist's words reminded Qin Sang of his experiences after entering Ju Shan Zhi. There had been clues before.</p><p>Crane Cry Mountain was the largest immortal city in Ju Shan Zhi, at the center of the vortex, yet the overt defenses were not particularly tight.</p><p>He had attempted to leave a spiritual imprint with the Celestial Court using a forged identity so he could use the Grand Teleportation Formation.</p><p>He hadn’t put much effort into the forged identity, yet it passed the inspection easily, or rather, there was barely any inspection at all.</p><p>Qin Sang had originally assumed that the Celestial Court was wary of the other major power, the Yin Heaven Palace, or that the Celestial Court was prepared to abandon this city at any time.</p><p>For the Celestial Court, rebuilding an immortal city was a trivial matter.</p><p>Now, it seemed likely that they intentionally relaxed their control, leaving an opening for cultivators outside the Daoist sects.</p><p>What was the strength of the forces outside the Celestial Court? How did they solve the problem of cultivation?</p><p>Did they also need to seek the Dharma from the Celestial Court?</p><p>If so, obtaining the Dharma for himself might not be as difficult as he had imagined.</p><p>In a flash, Qin Sang connected many dots and nodded. "Indeed, I hadn't anticipated encountering a master like fellow Daoist outside the Daoist lineage."</p><p>The Daoist gestured towards the outside.  "Fellow Daoist must have recently arrived in Ju Shan Zhi. The scenery here is quite different from the Celestial Court's twin domains. Fellow Daoist will see if you stay a bit longer."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded. He was currently focused on preparing for his tribulation and had indeed been somewhat hasty in setting out this time.</p><p>"I'm merely curious, from where did fellow Daoist obtain the qualification to receive the Dharma?"</p><p>The Daoist gave Qin Sang a meaningful look. "In Ju Shan Zhi, it's not entirely the domain of the Daoist sects. Outside of them, there are also Dharma Altars that can bestow teachings. But to reach a realm like mine, one can only seek the Celestial Court. That is our predicament. Obtaining the Dharma is extremely difficult. Otherwise, we'd be forced to stop here. Our path of cultivation is truly arduous, unlike fellow Daoist, a true disciple of the Daoist lineage, who can receive the Dharma once your cultivation reaches the requisite level. Your path ahead is bright."</p><p>Just as Qin Sang had surmised, cultivators in this realm, regardless of their origins, had to receive the Dharma.</p><p>The Daoist had inadvertently pointed out another path for Qin Sang.</p><p>But Qin Sang needed the Dharma of the Soul Transformation rank. According to the Daoist, he had to seek the Celestial Court, and obtaining the qualification to receive it was not easy.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered, about to inquire further, when the Daoist's expression suddenly changed. He cupped his hands and said, "My adversaries are using secret arts to locate me again. I must immediately enter seclusion to avoid being found. Please forgive me, fellow Daoist. In a few years, I should be able to resolve my troubles. At that time, we shall share a drink and converse freely."</p><p>Qin Sang frowned slightly but refrained from further questioning. He didn't want to be involved in pointless conflicts.</p><p>Moreover, the more he asked, the more likely he was to reveal his ignorance. It would be better to return and thoroughly investigate first. Now that he had information from the Daoist, he could be more focused, which should make things easier.</p><p>With this in mind, Qin Sang gave a slight bow, summoned his escape light, and swiftly flew towards the exit of the underground cave.</p><p>The Daoist stood on the surface of the water, watching Qin Sang depart, then slowly sank beneath the surface.</p><p>Gradually, tranquility returned to the cave, leaving only the gentle murmur of flowing water.</p><p>Emerging from the Star Valley, Qin Sang glanced back once more before departing, heading directly back to Crane Cry Mountain.</p><p>Recalling his brief encounter with the Daoist, despite its abruptness, it had been quite fruitful.</p><p>The power of the Acquired Wooden Figure Stele hadn't disappointed him, strengthening his resolve to continue diligently comprehending this technique.</p><p>Even after he recovered his full cultivation, this technique would significantly enhance his combat prowess.</p><p>He encountered no unexpected incidents along the way.</p><p>Qin Sang returned to Crane Cry Mountain without issue.</p><p>Upon entering the city, Qin Sang continued his two-pronged approach, diligently cultivating while gathering information based on the Daoist's insights.</p><p>After several months, he finally gained a more comprehensive understanding.</p><p>Qin Sang confirmed one thing: the sects in Ju Shan Zhi outwardly revered the Celestial Court and called themselves Daoist sects, but in reality, they might not necessarily possess true Daoist lineage.</p><p>Although these sects weren't Daoist, they had some connection to the Celestial Court. With the Celestial Court and the Ghost Fang Kingdom locked in a bitter struggle, no faction could remain neutral.  If they didn't lean towards the Celestial Court, they would have to side with the demons.</p><p>There were also rogue cultivators in Ju Shan Zhi, but not entirely without connections.</p><p>There were indeed Dharma Altars outside the Daoist sects that could bestow teachings, and their requirements weren't as stringent as the Daoist sects.</p><p>However, according to the information Qin Sang gathered, these teachings could at most support cultivation up to the Ascendant Profound rank, equivalent to the Nascent Soul stage, and most of them had flaws, which were precisely what the Daoist sects referred to as Outer Teachings.</p><p>The Daoist had clearly perceived Qin Sang's true cultivation, indirectly confirming his own strength.</p><p>After discovering this, Qin Sang attempted to contact a sect called the Tao Heng Mountain Sect.</p><p>If he was willing to exchange merit, it wouldn't be difficult to obtain the qualification to receive the Dharma. However, the more he learned about the Dharma, the more hesitant he became.</p><p>The Daoist Dharma encompassed a vast range of disciplines. The type of Dharma one received determined the type of Dharma Altar one would construct.</p><p>Among the three major schools of the Daoist sects, the Dragon Tiger Altar actually borrowed from demon cultivation techniques.  Physical cultivators naturally didn't need to stabilize their Yuan Qi.</p><p>Qin Sang could only cultivate either the Warhost Altar or the Golden Seal Altar.</p><p>Between the two, he preferred the Golden Seal Altar.</p><p>Therefore, he needed to carefully consider which Dharma to cultivate, combining it with what he already possessed, so that he could construct a Dharma Altar as quickly as possible after receiving the Dharma and choose one that was most compatible with himself.</p><p>Dharma below Soul Transformation wasn't something Qin Sang urgently needed. Even without it, he had few rivals at the Nascent Soul stage.</p><p>The real challenge was how to obtain the qualification to receive the Dharma from the Celestial Court.</p><p>He would only know after contacting the Celestial Court, but it was certain that to gain their approval, he needed a clean background that could withstand scrutiny.</p><p>And that was precisely what Qin Sang lacked.</p><p>Everything seemed to be back to square one, but it wasn't.  Gaining an identity outside the Daoist sects was much easier than infiltrating them.</p><p>Armed with this information, Qin Sang pondered that acquiring the qualification to receive the Dharma needed careful planning, and time was not on his side.  It would be better to first focus on how to break through in the path of body refinement, which held more promise.</p><p>He found a cave dwelling in the immortal city and devoted himself entirely to cultivating the "Celestial Demon Body Tempering Art."</p><p>Guiding the Six Heavens’ Ancient Qi into his body to temper his flesh, complemented by Star Yuan power, and further aided by the Dragon Transformation Pool's spiritual liquid, his cultivation speed far surpassed his previous rate.</p><p>If not for the worry of mental disorientation, this realm would undoubtedly be a paradise for physical cultivators.</p><p>In just five years, Qin Sang felt rapid progress, as if he had undergone a transformation.</p><p>During this period, Qin Sang wasn't completely oblivious to external affairs.</p><p>Shi Xuan and the others frequently brought him various news, and Qin Sang himself occasionally interacted with various factions to learn as much as possible about this world.</p><p>One day.</p><p>A blue light flew into the cave dwelling, manifesting into a spirit talisman before Qin Sang.  The talisman shattered, revealing several lines of information within his mind.</p><p>A moment later, Qin Sang opened his eyes, a contemplative expression on his face.</p><p>He had left a spiritual imprint with the Celestial Court. As long as he had a place to stay in the immortal city, he could have the Dharma Edicts sent to him.</p><p>Now he understood that when the Celestial Court issued Dharma Edicts, they also had the intention of offering benefits and appeasing outside forces.</p><p>The environment of this realm was unique. If the Celestial Court didn't win them over, it was tantamount to pushing them towards the Ghost Fang Kingdom.</p><p>At the same time, they could delegate troublesome matters to outsiders, killing two birds with one stone.</p><p>Of course, the Dharma Edicts wouldn't involve any true secrets.</p><p>The spirit talisman brought news of newly issued Dharma Edicts from the Celestial Court, and one in particular caught Qin Sang’s attention.</p><p>The edict stated that upon completion, one could obtain a token from a Profound Void True Person of the Celestial Court.  This token could be used to request this True Person to act once.</p><p>Not for combat, however. This Profound Void True Person was skilled in the Dao of Alchemy and held considerable renown.  Being able to request their services to refine pills was a dream for many.</p><p>A Profound Void True Person was equivalent to a Soul Transformation cultivator.</p><p>This was the kind of Dharma Edict Qin Sang had been waiting for.  His plan was to use the reward from the edict as leverage to request the Profound Astral Sect Master's assistance through the Celestial Court.</p><p>Dharma Edicts that could be exchanged for the aid of a Soul Transformation cultivator in combat would undoubtedly be extremely dangerous, while this one was just right.</p><p>He would ask the Profound Astral Sect Master to perform a ritual for him, channeling Star Yuan into his body, which was comparable to requesting pill refinement.</p><p>Of course, with enough merit, he might also be able to request the Profound Astral Sect Master's help, but then he would be asking a favor, and if they refused, he would have no recourse.</p><p>Moreover, in the past five years, in order to improve quickly, he had exchanged a significant amount of merit for spirit medicines at the Celestial Court. Accumulating merit inevitably involved traveling extensively, which would affect his cultivation.</p><p>Furthermore, Qin Sang also needed to prepare Azure Frost Pills for the Skywatch Butterfly. Befriending an alchemist in advance wouldn't hurt.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't hesitate any longer. He immediately left his cave dwelling and headed straight for the Celestial Court.</p><p>The edict was issued by the Northern Pole Exorcism Department.</p><p>Qin Sang quickly arrived and extended his divine sense into the archway. Seeing that the edict hadn't been claimed yet, his divine sense touched it, and a path immediately appeared before him, leading to a large black hall.</p><p>As he approached, the hall doors opened automatically.</p><p>Qin Sang stepped inside and saw a Daoist seated within. This person was stern and unsmiling, inspiring awe.</p><p>Glancing at the Daoist's attire, Qin Sang bowed slightly. “Greetings, Nine Heavens Wandering Emissary.”</p><p>The Nine Heavens Wandering Emissary was a Fifth Rank official within the Northern Pole Exorcism Department, one rank higher than a Dharma Altar Master.</p><p>Judging by this person's aura, he was already at the Late Nascent Soul stage.</p><p>The Wandering Emissary scrutinized Qin Sang. “Fellow Daoist wishes to accept this Dharma Edict?”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded. "I do have such intentions, but I have a request."</p><p>“Please speak.”</p><p>“If I complete the Dharma Edict, could I use the token to request that senior to ask the Profound Astral Sect Master to perform a task for me?”</p><p>The Wandering Emissary didn't make things difficult for Qin Sang and pondered for a moment. “Please wait a moment. I need to inquire about that senior's wishes.” (End of Chapter)</p>
