<h1>Chapter 1771: Gray Tribulation Thunder</h1><p>‘Rumble… rumble…’</p><p>Thunder echoed in his ears.</p><p>Dark clouds rolled, the sky darkening.</p><p>Wind and thunder played together, the earth desolate.</p><p>The pressure of Heaven weighed down on Qin Sang, making him feel as if he carried a mountain on his back.</p><p>Nearby demonic creatures had been driven away by Qin Sang.  The remaining ordinary living beings instinctively sensed the impending danger and fled frantically.</p><p>Qin Sang's Daoist robe flapped in the wind.  The Sky-Eyed Butterfly, at some point, had landed on his shoulder; now it took flight, circling the area before finally confirming that nothing nearby posed a threat to Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang had thoroughly investigated the area beforehand.</p><p>This was a meticulously chosen location for his tribulation, far from Crane Song Mountain, south of the Yellow Springs Path, nearly reaching the edge of Jushan Prefecture.  Not far south lay the Evil Origin.</p><p>Because the Yellow Springs Path is located in the southern part of Jushan Prefecture, the southern region is far less expansive than the north.  Any war would easily engulf it; therefore, most sects of Jushan Prefecture are located in the north.</p><p>There were no sects nearby. Unless someone happened to pass by, but truly powerful cultivators wouldn't come to such a remote place.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>The Gray Oriole Sword transformed into a sword light circling his body.</p><p>However, sword techniques would likely be of little use this time; his physical body was his true reliance.</p><p>Qin Sang stared at the tribulation clouds.</p><p>His premonition was correct; this fourth nine-fold tribulation was extraordinary.  Before the tribulation thunder even formed, its pressure far exceeded expectations.</p><p>Thankfully, he hadn't been complacent. If he hadn't broken through before the tribulation arrived, the outcome would have been dire.</p><p>‘Rumble… rumble…’</p><p>The tribulation cloud formed with astonishing speed.  Looking at it, Qin Sang's eyes showed a strange expression.</p><p>The tribulation thunder was born deep within the cloud, and Qin Sang could already see the thunder pythons surging within.</p><p>But strangely, the pythons were gray.</p><p>Gray tribulation thunder!</p><p>Qin Sang had seen the silver tribulation thunder of spirit insects, his own blue tribulation thunder, and Yun Youzi's blue-gold dual-colored tribulation thunder, but this was his first encounter with gray tribulation thunder.</p><p>As far as he knew, in this world, as in the Storm World, cultivators faced blue tribulation thunder, while demon cultivators faced gold.</p><p>At least, in the texts Qin Sang had collected, there was no record of gray tribulation thunder.</p><p>He had no time to think; the tribulation thunder was upon him!</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>Lightning fell like a waterfall.</p><p>Qin Sang had never seen such a strange sight.  The sudden lightning didn't illuminate the heavens; instead, it made the void even darker, as if the light was being absorbed by the tribulation thunder.</p><p>The gray tribulation thunder didn't seem as imposing as previous tribulation thunders, but its violent nature remained unchanged, and it was even more formidable.</p><p>He focused his mind, forming a heart seal.</p><p>Golden light flowed over his body, his inner energy mobilized.  Qin Sang unhesitatingly used the Auspicious Seal, the Golden Vajra Armor Seal, and simultaneously formed the Demon Crushing Seal with his right hand.</p><p>A cultivator of physical strength must possess the spirit to smash through everything. Qin Sang would not sit idly by. He stamped his foot, leaped into the air, and actively met the tribulation thunder.</p><p>The Sky-Eyed Butterfly was eager to join the fray, but Qin Sang stopped it.</p><p>The nature of the gray tribulation thunder was still unknown, and Qin Sang didn't dare let the Sky-Eyed Butterfly absorb it directly.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>Qin Sang shot towards the heavens, his expression serious. A strange golden light appeared on his right palm, transforming into a large golden hand seal.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>For a moment, as the thunder and the hand seal were about to collide, time seemed to slow down.</p><p>This was an illusion caused by the collision of two powerful forces.</p><p>The gray tribulation thunder engulfed Qin Sang, then a figure was seen crashing heavily to the ground.</p><p>‘Thud!’</p><p>The earth trembled, and a crater appeared.</p><p>Strangely, the tribulation thunder didn't press its advantage.  It hung in mid-air, then shattered piece by piece.</p><p>‘Snap!’</p><p>The thunder shattered!</p><p>The tribulation thunder had been smashed by Qin Sang with a single blow!</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>Qin Sang burst from the crater. Gray lightning danced on his body, some seeming to penetrate the armor and seep into his body.</p><p>Hair disheveled, he seemed unfazed, letting out a hearty laugh, exclaiming his delight, his laughter filled with immense confidence.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>The second tribulation thunder followed.</p><p>This time, Qin Sang had fewer concerns. He mentally commanded the Sky-Eyed Butterfly, and once again leaped to meet the tribulation thunder, this time using the Rotating Altar Seal.</p><p>Unlike the Demon Crushing Seal's relentless advance, with this seal, the space around the hand seal seemed to become stagnant. When the tribulation thunder struck, it was momentarily delayed, its momentum slowing.</p><p>This seal wasn't just for dealing with magical treasures; with Qin Sang's cultivation, he could also use it to neutralize opponent's spells and divine abilities.</p><p>Of course, this seal couldn't restrain the tribulation thunder entirely, only delaying it for a moment.</p><p>That moment was all Qin Sang needed.  The Sky-Eyed Butterfly rushed forward, lightning flashing between its wings, then shooting out a net of lightning.</p><p>A net of lightning enveloped the tribulation thunder, then was swiftly retracted and swallowed by the Sky-Eyed Butterfly.</p><p>The butterfly's eyes clouded over with a grayish haze; its wings clamped shut, its slender body trembling.</p><p>Seeing the butterfly seemingly unharmed, Qin Sang ignored it and focused on the tribulation thunder.</p><p>Against a Heavenly Tribulation, evasion tactics were useless, so Qin Sang hardly used the Lotus Seal, instead alternating between the Demon-Crushing Seal and the Rotating Altar Seal.</p><p>The thunderclouds churned; the tribulation thunder seemed endless.</p><p>Each bolt was more powerful than the last, and Qin Sang's composure began to fade.</p><p>At that moment,</p><p>Outside the tribulation site, near the Jushan border, four figures – three men and a woman, all in Daoist robes – sped across the mountains.</p><p>Their cultivation levels varied, the woman being the strongest, likely at the late Golden Core stage.</p><p>They tirelessly scaled peaks, seemingly searching for something.</p><p>After a long search, a short, stout Daoist finally spoke,  "Senior Sister, we haven't found the herb.  The information must be wrong.  If we go further, we might run into Gui Fang's soldiers.  What if…"</p><p>The woman ignored him.</p><p>A man ahead of the stout Daoist turned back, "The information came from the Daoist Court; it should be correct. That herb is crucial to Senior Sister. We must find it.  Don't worry, we're still some distance from the border between the two powers, and this area is remote. Even if there are demons, they won't be too strong."</p><p>The stout Daoist nodded; he understood, but the fruitless search was getting to him.</p><p>Suddenly, the woman stopped.</p><p>"Senior Sister, what is it?"</p><p>His companions were startled, growing wary.</p><p>The stout Daoist felt apprehensive, fearing his Senior Sister's rebuke.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the woman took flight again, speeding towards the distance; the others quickly followed.</p><p>After a short flight, they landed on a mountaintop, staring ahead.</p><p>"A Heavenly Tribulation!"</p><p>The woman said gravely.</p><p>They were still far from the tribulation, but dared not proceed.</p><p>From their position, they could see a vast, black expanse in the sky, the clouds obscuring everything.</p><p>Despite the distance, they could sense the tribulation's aura, their souls trembling.</p><p>"It's… stronger than Master's tribulation,"</p><p>a Daoist in a high crown whispered.</p><p>The woman remained silent, her gaze fixed on the clouds, a hint of confusion in her eyes. She had witnessed her elders' tribulations before – brilliant lightning illuminating the heavens, an awe-inspiring display of heavenly might.</p><p>But this cloud was strangely different.  Only churning darkness, no striking lightning serpents or pythons, only a heavy, oppressive feeling.</p><p>"This…"</p><p>The woman was puzzled, doubting her senses.  How could such a tribulation exist?</p><p>Her words alerted the others, who were equally perplexed.</p><p>"Senior Sister, should we go closer and…"</p><p>The high-crowned Daoist was cut short.</p><p>"No!" the woman commanded.</p><p>They stopped, understanding their Senior Sister's judgment.</p><p>Whatever the thunder was, its cultivator was far beyond their level. Moreover, a tribulation in the wilderness likely meant protection.</p><p>If discovered, they would all die!</p><p>Still, they had never encountered such a strange tribulation; it wasn't in any texts. The mystery gnawed at them.</p><p>The stout Daoist's eyes lit up, "Senior Sister, didn't you bring a fleeting shadow charm?"</p><p>The others looked at the woman expectantly.</p><p>She hesitated. The charm, which could transform into a water mirror for silently observing distant enemies, was a gift from her Master, specifically for this herb search.</p><p>After a moment, she decided to use it.</p><p>With a flick of her wrist, a shimmering blue charm appeared in her palm, followed by a sound like bursting bubbles.</p><p>A palm-sized water mirror materialized before them.</p><p>It reflected the void at the tribulation's edge.</p><p>Focusing on the center might reveal the cultivator, but someone of such high cultivation would have incredibly sharp senses. Detection would mean certain death.</p><p>Conveniently, the tribulation clouds brewed another bolt.</p><p>A gray lightning bolt flashed in the mirror.</p><p>They stared,</p><p>Though only a reflection, the lightning felt as if it burst from the mirror, striking them, freezing them in place.</p><p>'Crack!'</p><p>The mirror, unable to withstand the aura, cracked.</p><p>The woman's expression changed, a cry escaping her lips.</p><p>"Retreat!"</p><p>The four fled in panic.</p><p>They stared blankly, even after the dark clouds had vanished.</p><p>"Gray tribulation thunder… such a thing exists in the world!  Too bad I didn't see the cultivator," the Daoist priest murmured to himself.</p><p>"The world is full of wonders."</p><p>The woman quickly regained her composure.  "We shouldn't stay here.  We can't continue searching for herbs."</p><p>"Yes! Yes!"</p><p>"Let's go!"</p><p>…</p><p>At the heart of the tribulation clouds, Qin Sang was struck down by lightning again.</p><p>Even if those people had seen him, they wouldn't have recognized him, as he had transformed into a spirit wood body using the *Hòutiān Mùrén Bēi* technique.</p><p>Unknowing observers might have mistaken the scene for an ancient tree spirit being struck by lightning.</p><p>The landscape was devastated, the earth scarred with deep craters.</p><p>Gray lightning tore through the clouds; the more powerful the thunder, the grayer and darker it became.  The oppressive clouds blotted out the sun, trapping Qin Sang in a small area.</p><p>*Rumble…*</p><p>*Crack!*</p><p>Countless lightning bolts formed a net, a rain of electrical serpents descending upon a single target.</p><p>The towering tree-like figure seemed small at that moment.</p><p>Its rough face showed little expression, only its eyes shining with unwavering determination.</p><p>Qin Sang's wounds were rapidly healing. His spirit wood body constantly absorbed the surrounding wood spirit energy, while his own powerful regenerative abilities prevented him from ever truly weakening.</p><p>He leaped again.</p><p>Using the *Seven Masters Buddha Seal* in his spirit wood form, his power increased.</p><p>The *Zhuan Tan Seal* slowed the tribulation thunder, then he unleashed the *Cui Mo Seal*. His palm, like a blade, cleaved the lightning in two.  Some of the thunderbolts were deflected, swallowed by the waiting Sky-Eye Butterflies.</p><p>The rest were either extinguished or crashed into Qin Sang.</p><p>Another crater appeared on the ground, but Qin Sang quickly climbed out.</p><p>In the clouds, the next wave of tribulation thunder was brewing.</p><p>Qin Sang looked energetic, but his expression was serious. He ordered the Sky-Eye Butterflies to retreat.</p><p>He would soon be unable to protect them, and they were nearing their limit after absorbing so much tribulation thunder.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>…</p><p>Again and again he was struck down, again and again he rose.</p><p>Qin Sang fought tirelessly against the Heavenly Tribulation.</p><p>The surrounding forest began to wither, the wood spirit energy sucked away by Qin Sang, bringing calamity to the plants.</p><p>After an unknown period…</p><p>Finally, the tribulation clouds dissipated.</p><p>The earth was deeply gouged; the last thunderbolt split the ground open, creating a canyon.</p><p>As the clouds cleared, a rough hand suddenly emerged from the canyon, grasped the edge, and leaped up.</p><p>…</p><p>A courtyard somewhere.</p><p>The courtyard lacked unusual flowers, plants, rock gardens, or ponds; the scenery was rather plain.</p><p>Inside the only wooden building, a dark-skinned man sat in meditation, surrounded by stillness.</p><p>Suddenly, the courtyard's barrier was triggered.</p><p>The dark-skinned man awoke and heard someone outside say, "Reporting to Mo Zhenren, the Lord requests your presence."</p><p>He left the courtyard, seeing a celestial official from the Tianshu Academy. He nodded slightly and followed the official to a magnificent hall.</p><p>The hall doors were open.</p><p>The official bowed and withdrew, the dark-skinned man entering the hall.  He saw the Celestial Court's Inspector General staring intently at an object in his hand.</p><p>"My apologies for disturbing Daoist Mo's meditation."</p><p>The Inspector General smiled and looked up. "Come, have a look at this."</p><p>The dark-skinned man approached and saw a palm-sized jade tablet in his hand.</p><p>The tablet continuously displayed extremely brief images.</p><p>"This is…"</p><p>The dark-skinned man's gaze sharpened.</p><p>"I see, gray tribulation thunder!  Our efforts have paid off. We've finally found it."</p><p>The Inspector General handed the jade tablet to the dark-skinned man. "This footage was discovered and recorded by a disciple of a sect in Jushan. Unfortunately, they were too low in cultivation to observe the cultivator undergoing the tribulation. However, this footage confirms the ancient texts. This is the heavenly tribulation faced by Ascending cultivators! Your companion…"</p><p>The Inspector General turned to the hall's entrance. "Since she underwent the tribulation in Jushan, closer to us, she likely hasn't joined the Guifang Kingdom. However, according to the texts, while gray tribulation thunder is highly beneficial to cultivators from the Lesser Thousand World, it's far more powerful than ordinary tribulation thunder. If she survived and hasn't joined Guifang, perhaps some cultivator has already taken her in."</p><p>The dark-skinned man stared at the tablet for a long time. "If the texts are true, only cultivators from the Lesser Thousand World face this tribulation upon entering the Greater Thousand World, meaning this must be the Greater Thousand World!  Why… do you say perhaps not?"</p><p>The Inspector General gazed at the sky, calmly stating, "Because the Celestial Court has reached no conclusion! Perhaps one day, you and I will have the ability to explore the Abyss and the Mire, reaching the other side, and then we will know."</p><p>(End)</p>
