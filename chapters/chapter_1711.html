<h1>Chapter 1702  The Heavenly Demon</h1><p>Shrouded in hazy mist.</p><p>The incarnation stood before the temple gate, his gaze sweeping past Master Xingji and other high monks.</p><p>The apricot-yellow temple walls, grey ridgepoles, inky mountains; the ancient temple, a silhouette half-hidden in the clouds, was serene and solemn.</p><p>Monks filed out, standing by the path.</p><p>Inside and outside the temple, many non-Buddhist lay people were present.</p><p>Everyone scrutinized the incarnation, assessing this Xie family ancestor.  Naturally, some eyed the Five Elements Pill with ulterior motives.</p><p>While the incarnation and Master Xingji conversed, some impatiently sent messages.</p><p>The conversation between the incarnation and Master Xingji surprised and then enlightened the onlookers.  No wonder the Holy One Hui Guang had specifically cleared his name; he had become a Buddhist lackey.</p><p>That was Qin Sang's intention.</p><p>He held no sectarian bias, treating Daoists and Buddhists equally.</p><p>Publicly declaring his residence at the Ganlu Zen Monastery, binding the incarnation to Buddhism and establishing a righteous position, guaranteed a degree of safety, at least within the monastery.</p><p>After the transaction, the incarnation wouldn't leave immediately, planning to stay at the Ganlu Zen Monastery to break through his bottleneck.</p><p>If all went well, the incarnation would use the monastery's convenience to collect the items his true body needed in Central State, while the true body concentrated on cultivation in Luye.</p><p>Before arriving, Qin Sang carefully screened the incarnation's memories and placed restrictions on him.</p><p>Should things go wrong, the incarnation would be decisively abandoned!</p><p>The amicable conversation between the incarnation and Master Xingji appeared collusive to those with ill intent.</p><p>After the pleasantries.</p><p>Both entered the temple.</p><p>The Ganlu Zen Monastery prepared a grand reception, fulfilling the Holy One Hui Guang's promise without fail.  While Qin Sang disliked such displays, he cooperated.</p><p>The incarnation acted like a puppet, bustling from morning until noon, playing his part before the guests.</p><p>The guests departed.</p><p>Master Xingji personally led the incarnation to his cave dwelling for rest.  The hasty preparations showed they hadn't expected the incarnation to stay.</p><p>The cave dwelling was located on a secluded mountain behind the Ganlu Zen Monastery, quiet and elegant, a truly superior cultivation site.</p><p>The incarnation was very pleased, thinking it befitted a holy site.</p><p>In Beihai, perhaps only the Lingxiao Peak of Xuantian Palace could surpass it, and this was certainly not the best in the Ganlu Zen Monastery.</p><p>The only drawback was that he didn't have sole access to the mountain; another high monk of the Ganlu Zen Monastery also cultivated there.</p><p>Declining further arrangements, the incarnation saw off Master Xingji.  As he sat pondering, the attendant monk brought Xie An, Zhou Ruan, and others who had been waiting elsewhere.</p><p>"Greetings, Ancestor!"</p><p>"Greetings, Senior!"</p><p>...</p><p>Several knelt and prostrated themselves, their excitement unconcealed.</p><p>They still felt like they were dreaming.</p><p>The incarnation said calmly, "Xie Yi and Zhou Li have been accepted as disciples by Shen Chen.  As for you, continue as you have been. The Xie family and Loutai View must work together to govern the Three Prefectures. I will no longer interfere in mundane affairs.  If you encounter problems, go to the Ganlu Zen Monastery to complainâ€¦"</p><p>After dismissing them, the incarnation sat quietly for a while before leaving the cave.</p><p>The attendant monk stood guard outside.</p><p>"I wish to visit the Holy One at Xiaofangcun Mountain.  Could the master show me the way?" the incarnation casually asked.</p><p>The attendant monk nodded, asking no questions, and silently led the way.</p><p>The two walked side-by-side through the mountains, enjoying the scenery.</p><p>They were now in the core area of the Ganlu Zen Monastery, heavily guarded.  The incarnation sensed powerful auras in the shadows more than once.</p><p>However, these individuals seemed to have received instructions, and no one questioned them.</p><p>The path was clear.</p><p>At the foot of a green mountain, the attendant monk stopped, clasped his hands together.</p><p>The incarnation thanked him and went to the mountain.  Suddenly, he heard:  "Master Qin is expecting you."</p><p>A stone path appeared in the woods.</p><p>This mountain held no outward wonders, but entering revealed a hidden splendor.  Compared to this place, his own cave dwelling paled, a true place of cultivation for Divine Transformation experts.</p><p>The stone path wound through the woods, birds chirping.</p><p>The incarnation saw no statues or carvings.  At the path's end, he reached the summit.</p><p>Unexpectedly, there were no temples. Only two meditation cushions on rocks, one each for the Holy One Hui Guang and the Holy King Qinghu, and a sacrificial altar beside them.</p><p>They were meditating with closed eyes, opening them in unison to look at him.</p><p>Unfazed by the gaze of Divine Transformation experts, the incarnation noted three more furry tails had grown from behind the Holy King Qinghu, although they seemed somewhat ethereal.</p><p>"Greetings, Holy Monk, Holy King."</p><p>The incarnation paid his respects.</p><p>"Master Qin, please," the Holy One Hui Guang bowed slightly, pointing to a cushion, gesturing him to sit.</p><p>The Saint King, Qinghu, smiled enigmatically.  "You've shown some nerve, I'll grant you that!"</p><p>The avatar sat down without ceremony and immediately stated his terms. "In the future, neither of you will interfere in my dealings with Daoist Mo, correct?"</p><p>"We shall not interfere in any way," the Holy Venerable Huiguang pledged.</p><p>The avatar nodded, produced a jade slip, and handed it to the Holy Venerable.  "Please, Venerable Monk, arrange a spirit array according to the instructions on this slip."</p><p>Holy Venerable Huiguang examined it, then flicked his finger, sending the jade slip flying out of the mountain as a streak of light.</p><p>"This array is rather complex and will take some time."</p><p>"No problem."</p><p>The avatar inwardly breathed a sigh of relief. At least the first step had gone smoothly.</p><p>This array, the Ten Thousand Li Azure Nether Array, was a communication spirit array.  The avatar was currently residing at the Ganlu Monastery, and his true body couldn't approach; this array would facilitate communication.  Ganlu Monastery undoubtedly possessed similar secrets, but only his own array could be trusted.</p><p>This array was obtained by Qin Sang from the Xuantian Palace. Due to the extremely complex requirements for its construction, and the exorbitant cost of the necessary spiritual materials, its only function was communication, and even then it had a limited number of uses.  It was quite a useless thing.</p><p>Only Ganlu Monastery could afford such extravagance.</p><p>The three then began to discuss the karmic oath.</p><p>The avatar and the Saint King Qinghu mainly debated, with Holy Venerable Huiguang occasionally interjecting with fairness.</p><p>Qin Sang's goal was self-preservation.</p><p>The Saint King Qinghu largely accepted the avatar's requests, but strongly argued against one point, limiting any promises to this realm and guaranteeing no bullying of the weak until Qin Sang's breakthrough to the Divine Transformation stage.</p><p>The oath was agreed upon.</p><p>An altar was set up, and the oath was sworn.</p><p>The ritual for the karmic oath was complex, taking three days to complete.</p><p>Three days later.</p><p>A smirk played on the Saint King Qinghu's lips. "Decided what you want?"</p><p>The avatar said solemnly, "I wish to examine the Saint King's treasures more closely."</p><p>"Excellent!"</p><p>The Saint King Qinghu broke into a captivating smile, radiating charm.  With a slap to his jade belt, streams of light shot out, hovering in the air between the three, for the avatar to choose from.</p><p>The avatar quickly scanned the treasures, showing a puzzled expression; there was no spirit gathering array.</p><p>Saint King Qinghu explained languidly, "The ancient spirit gathering array is hidden in a secluded realm in the East Sea. Whether I move it out of the realm or tell you its location depends on your preference. Forcibly removing it risks damage. Of course, if the array is damaged, I will provide alternative compensation."</p><p>The avatar nodded, though he offered no reply, his decision already made.</p><p>He absolutely had to have Qinghu move the spirit gathering array; otherwise, it would be like walking into a trap.</p><p>He then turned his attention to the treasures before him.</p><p>A dazzling array of celestial trees, rare flowers, jade slips, ancient books, pills, and precious artifacts.  Their value varied, but each was a unique treasure.</p><p>The avatar silently marveled at the wealth of a Divine Transformation cultivator, then made a gesture.  A light flickered in front of him, and an object flew out, landing in his hand.</p><p>It was a jade-like spirit bamboo, only three feet high, resembling a flute. Its stem was straight, with seven perfectly uniform sections in length and thickness.</p><p>Even the base was the same, only slightly whiter.</p><p>Strangely, it had no leaves, only a single, sparkling flower at the top.</p><p>It was a seventh-grade Azure Spirit Bamboo!</p><p>The flower blooming without leaves marked the maturity of the seventh-grade Azure Spirit Bamboo. The flower could be used as medicine, but if the bamboo were used for refining an artifact, the flower would be incorporated to enhance its power.</p><p>The avatar examined it carefully, primarily checking for damage.  This was a requirement of the "Posterity Wooden Man Stele," for the spirit wood used as a spiritual medium must be intact.</p><p>After checking it, the avatar returned the bamboo, then summoned a silver flower the size of a plate, a crescent-shaped blue fruit, and a gnarled tree root...</p><p>Saint King Qinghu had preserved them well; they all looked freshly picked, vibrant and dewy.</p><p>These spiritual herbs and pills in bottles had varying effects; for example, the blue fruit enhanced spiritual awareness, its potency not inferior to the Azure Falling Immortal Fruit.</p><p>The avatar held the blue fruit in his hand, seemingly reluctant to let go, before returning it.</p><p>Then, he turned his attention to several jade slips containing the cultivation techniques for after reaching Divine Transformation, as well as other secret arts, as mentioned by Saint King Qinghu.</p><p>"Ancient Hua Sutra," "Hundred-Fold Yin Thunder," "Four Secret Divine Records"...</p><p>Indeed, each was a top-tier human cultivation technique.</p><p>Especially the "Hundred-Fold Yin Thunder," a top-tier secret technique of the Xuan Shui Dao, only cultivatable after Divine Transformation. It could create Xuan Shui Yin Thunder, layering multiple strikes.  Its power was terrifying, capable of drawing upon the power of heaven and earth, making it difficult for enemies to evade.</p><p>It required cultivation of water-based techniques and the purest water-based true essence; otherwise, it would be exceptionally difficult to cultivate.</p><p>It was perfect for the avatar.</p><p>Qin Sang's physical body was unsure if it could even reach the Transcendence stage, let alone create a physical manifestation; even the allure of the secret technique couldn't overcome this, and he had to reluctantly give it up.</p><p>He returned the "Hundred-Fold Yin Thunder" and took out another jade slip.  Seeing the name on it, his spirits immediately liftedâ€”this was the technique that had finally driven him to risk this venture.</p><p>"The Celestial Demon Illumination Scripture!"</p><p>Five large characters met his eyes, followed by an outline of the technique. The jade slip was protected by a restriction, so he could only see a portion of the contents, but he grasped its essence.  It involved actively drawing in a strand of demonic energy from an extra-dimensional demon, internalizing it to illuminate the primordial spirit.</p><p>He then turned his attention to the other items. While there were no true spiritual treasures, there were pseudo-spiritual treasures.</p><p>After examining them, his manifestation found itself in a quandary. He wanted the Ancient Spirit Gathering Array, the "Celestial Demon Illumination Scripture," and the Seven-Rank Azure Spirit Bamboo. He also needed the Seven-Star Root, a key ingredient for a pill described in the "Pan Hu True Scripture" that would enhance the Sky-Eyed Butterfly.</p><p>The compensation from the Azure Fox Saint King, including the formula for the Spirit-Subduing Incense, wasn't enough to exchange for everything.  He intended to keep the Spirit-Subduing Incense for Liuli.</p><p>The Azure Fox Saint King had been impolite first; he could have driven a hard bargain, but given her compensation and the need to maintain face for the mediating Hui Guang Saint, he couldn't be too unreasonable.</p><p>After some thought, the manifestation said, "Qin obtained the Water Palace's alchemic legacy from the Wu Xiang Immortal Sect. The ancestor who created the Spirit-Subduing Incense may also have been from the Wu Xiang Immortal Sect, and their expertise might be helpful in refining it."</p><p>The Azure Fox Saint King's beautiful eyes flickered, watching the manifestation choose with amusement. Without batting an eye, she said, "Consider it exchanged."</p><p>"And the Spirit-Subduing Incense's main ingredients, including two Wanling Fruits..."</p><p>He had three Wanling Fruits left and planned to give up two.</p><p>Before the manifestation could finish, the Azure Fox Saint King decisively replied, "All exchanged."</p><p>Both parties were eager to trade, and the process went smoothly. The manifestation took the "Celestial Demon Illumination Scripture" and the Seven-Rank Azure Spirit Bamboo, and requested that the Azure Fox Saint King relocate the Ancient Spirit Gathering Array.</p><p>He then traded the Wanling Fruits and other previously collected spirit herbs for the Seven-Star Root, and also commissioned the Azure Fox Saint King to find the various herbs needed for the "Pan Hu True Scripture" and the core materials for the Taiji Immortal Stage.</p><p>He could gather the Ice-Fire Order at his leisure.</p><p>This action might appear to be aiding his enemy, but Qin Sang didn't care how strong his opponents were. As long as he continued to advance, he would eventually catch up and surpass them!</p><p>"Once the Myriad-Mile Azure Void Array is complete, I will notify my physical body to send the formula and treasures," the manifestation bowed slightly before gracefully descending the mountain, laden with his gains.</p><p>Watching his back disappear among the mountains, the Azure Fox Saint King chuckled meaningfully. "I thought I'd have to use some subtle methods to get the 'Celestial Demon Illumination Scripture' to him, but he picked it himself, saving me the trouble."</p><p>She turned to Hui Guang Saint. "They say extra-dimensional demons appear when cultivators face the Transcendence tribulation, when the tribulation is too powerful and the heavens tremble, attracting external evils and tempting the mind.  Cultivators fear these demons, and yet, someone dares to actively invite one. Old monk, you truly did nothing to manipulate this situation, not afraid he'd detect something amiss and shelve the scripture?"</p><p>Hui Guang Saint replied, "This technique is a secret art of the Transcendence stage; I lack the ability to alter it. Any modification would leave flaws easily detectable.  Ancient Buddhist practitioners, with ironclad will, dared to utilize extra-dimensional demons to identify their own weaknesses to achieve perfection; this scripture was born of such efforts. However, it primarily focuses on strengthening the spirit; because true invocation of the demon is avoided, its effect on refining the mind is greatly diminished."</p><p>"You suspect the Heavenly Demon's Sound is connected to extra-dimensional demons?"</p><p>The Azure Fox Saint King clicked her tongue in admiration.</p><p>"What a vicious scheme!</p><p>"That person's spiritual awareness far surpasses those of his cultivation level, even exceeding his own cultivation.  He must be extremely accomplished, even if not a spiritual cultivator.  Perhaps his spiritual awareness can leap ahead and match that of a Transcendence cultivator.</p><p>"Now it seems the Heavenly Demon's Sound is compatible with the heavens. Unless he breaks through to the Transcendence realm and achieves a harmony between man and heaven, even his greatly enhanced spiritual awareness won't detect the Heavenly Demon's Sound.</p><p>"Breaking through to Transcendence will inevitably lead to death from a demonic tribulation.</p><p>"Failure to break through, trapped by the bottleneck, and desperate, he will turn to the 'Celestial Demon Illumination Scripture', further bolstering his spiritual awareness to find a breakthrough. Then, by invoking the demon, if your guess is correct and the extra-dimensional demon is the source of the Heavenly Demon's Sound, he won't attract a mere strand of demonic energy, but the demon's full attention!</p><p>"His sudden death will confirm the source of the Heavenly Demon's Sound.</p><p>"Even if the world's changes are unrelated to extra-dimensional demons, with the demon's energy residing in him, if the Heavenly Demon's Sound intensifies, he will be the first affected. The demonic energy will erupt, and he'll surely die.</p><p>"Spiritual cultivators are rare. Those who know of the Heavenly Demon's Sound would not dare practice this technique. He is one in a million, truly no one is more suitable.</p><p>"Old monk, you are indeed deeply wary of him; you don't intend to let him live, whether he transcends or not!"</p><p>Hui Guang Saint, fingers twisting his prayer beads, remained silent.</p><p>The Azure Fox Saint King sighed, "In the past, while I disliked you, I saw your actions as grand and proper.  Never have I seen such petty schemes, such underhanded tricks!"</p><p>Finally, the Azure Fox Saint King shook her head, "Fear and loss, nothing more.  Too many entanglements are truly a bad thing."</p><p>...</p><p>Far away in the Northern Wastelands' Deer Fields.</p><p>Qin Sang's physical body wasn't cultivating either; he was constantly deducing something, his mind filled with the "Lifeless Demon Seal" given to him by his senior sister Qing Jun.</p><p>Since obtaining this secret technique, Qin Sang had a persistent idea, but searching the North Sea and Central Plains had yielded no comparable techniques or scriptures to support it.</p><p>Extra-dimensional demons, also known as external demons, are terrifying existences that can manifest as a cultivator's heart demon and kill invisibly.</p><p>Internal demons are avoidable.</p><p>But what of external ones?</p>
