<h1>Chapter 769: Demonic Fire</h1><p>Qin Sang's burst of speed left the beasts in the dust.</p><p>Soon, the pack, including their leader, lost sight of him. They wandered the ravine, roaring in frustration.</p><p>Despite escaping, Qin Sang didn't dare stop. He kept watch as he fled, only hiding in a concealed crevice when all was silent.</p><p>Although he had only heard the roars from afar, the sheer power of the sound made his blood surge. The beast, even if not as strong as a transformed demon, was undoubtedly more powerful than the young man he had just killed.</p><p>The depths of the ravine were truly perilous; who knew how many such beasts lurked within?</p><p>Hidden in the crevice, Qin Sang remained vigilant, listening to the outside world. Then, he checked on the Fat Silkworm.</p><p>Twice spitting out the seven-colored silk had greatly exhausted the Fat Silkworm. It was listless, appearing drowsy.</p><p>However, it still looked at Qin Sang with anticipation, eager to devour the Amethyst.</p><p>"You'll have it when we leave the Seven Kills Palace. Eat this for now."</p><p>Qin Sang took out a demon core and let the Fat Silkworm absorb it to recover.</p><p>Previously, in the Bear Mountain region and Red Leaf Island, the Fat Silkworm had fallen into a deep sleep immediately after consuming the Thousand-Hand Spider Fruit and absorbing lightning from the Skyeye Butterfly, undergoing transformation and mutation respectively.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't dare feed it the Amethyst here. If it fell asleep on the spot, he would be doomed.</p><p>This trip to the Purple Mist Forbidden Zone truly revealed the Fat Silkworm's value, far exceeding expectations.</p><p>It might prove even more useful later on. He would definitely wait until they left the Seven Kills Palace and returned to safety before feeding it the Amethyst and observing the changes.</p><p>The Fat Silkworm hugged the demon core and gave Qin Sang a disdainful look.</p><p>Noticing its disdain, Qin Sang's eye twitched.</p><p>This was a demon core! Fit only for this creature's consumption, and it still showed disdain!</p><p>Qin Sang badly wanted to give it a thrashing, but considering their surroundings, he decided to endure.</p><p>As the Fat Silkworm devoured the core and its aura recovered, Qin Sang remained alert. After a while, seeing that the beast leader hadn't pursued them, he cautiously ventured out.</p><p>His escape had brought him almost back to where he had landed.</p><p>Qin Sang returned to his previous route, continuing his search for the spirit fire. This time, he was even more cautious, fearing an encounter with the beasts searching for him. He practically stopped every few steps, ready to flee at a moment's notice.</p><p>The Nine Nether Demonic Fire in his hand flickered intensely, growing increasingly excited, indicating the unknown spirit fire was closer.</p><p>He noticed he was at the foot of another cliff, unsure if it was the same one where the beasts dwelled.</p><p>The terrain within the ravine was complex.</p><p>The Nine Nether Demonic Fire pointed the way, seemingly along the cliff face.</p><p>Qin Sang kept close to the cliff, wary of beasts not only from the sides but also from above. Fortunately, his journey was smooth so far.</p><p>"Huh?"</p><p>Qin Sang stopped abruptly.</p><p>He found himself at the junction of two cliffs, forming a canyon. Purple mist filled the space ahead, obscuring his vision.</p><p>"Such unique terrain within the ravine?  This place is perfect for a lair.  Could the spirit fire be hidden within some ancient hall or behind an ancient restriction, guarded by beasts?"</p><p>Qin Sang suspected, a sense of foreboding rising. He stared ahead for a moment, but heard nothing.</p><p>Since he was here, he might as well proceed.</p><p>Steeling himself, Qin Sang gripped the Ten Yama Banners and slowly walked forward.</p><p>The canyon wasn't wide, and it narrowed further as he progressed.</p><p>After a short distance, Qin Sang paused, shock flashing across his face. Then, he suddenly accelerated, rushing forward.</p><p>…</p><p>Between the cliffs, a mass of black flames floated within the canyon, blocking his path.</p><p>Qin Sang stood there, gazing up at the flames.</p><p>"Nine Nether Demonic Fire! It's actually Nine Nether Demonic Fire! The Seven Kills Palace also has Nine Nether Demonic Fire! No wonder…"</p><p>Qin Sang murmured, his expression shifting from shock to realization, then to ecstasy.</p><p>No wonder the Nine Nether Demonic Fire behaved differently here than on Cold Flame Island. The spirit fire here was clearly of the same origin as his demonic fire; their auras were identical.</p><p>This wasn't the superficial control he achieved through the Ten Yama Banners. This was the true essence of the demonic fire!</p><p>Back then, Ancestor Kui Yin encountered the Nine Nether Demonic Fire in the Purple Firmament Palace. He racked his brains, refined the demonic banners, and subdued it, thus establishing his dominance in the Small Cold Region.</p><p>Qin Sang, upon learning this secret, had been envious.</p><p>Later, Ancestor Kui Yin and his descendants searched the Purple Firmament Palace and the Ancient Immortal Battlefield for a long time, but never found the same demonic fire, leaving their sect's treasure damaged and beyond repair.</p><p>He never imagined he would see it in the Seven Kills Palace today.</p><p>Moreover, this mass of Nine Nether Demonic Fire was larger than the one Ancestor Kui Yin had subdued!</p><p>Standing here, sensing the true might of the demonic fire, Qin Sang finally understood Ancestor Kui Yin's obsession with it.</p><p>The Nine Nether Demonic Fire burned quietly.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes widened as he sensed its power.</p><p>Before, he only knew about it through Yi Tiannie's memories; he had no personal experience of its true might.</p><p>Beneath its seemingly calm surface lay a power as violent as volcanic magma.</p><p>If the true power of the demonic fire were unleashed, Qin Sang had no doubt he would be incinerated instantly.</p><p>He couldn't help but compare it to the Nascent Soul ancestors he had encountered, feeling that the demonic fire's power was beyond even the reach of Ancestor Chifa and Elder Zhenyi.</p><p>And these two were at the peak of mid-Nascent Soul, just a step away from late-Nascent Soul!</p><p>Ancestor Kui Yin, by utilizing the Ten Yama Formation, could only wield a fraction of the Nine Nether Demonic Fire's power, yet it was enough to make him a top expert in the Small Cold Region.</p><p>"Such terrifying power. Can I truly subdue it?"</p><p>Qin Sang took a deep breath, doubting himself.</p><p>Suppressing his excitement, he flipped his hand, revealing a dark iron pillar.</p><p>This pillar was a trophy from killing Daoist Jiupao, also the Kui Yin Sect's most prized possession. The pole of the Ten Yama Banners was forged from another such pillar.</p><p>Had the Kui Yin Sect found the Nine Nether Demonic Fire, they would have long since forged new banners and repaired the formation.</p><p>After being severely injured, Daoist Jiupao had attempted to refine it into his lifebound treasure.</p><p>Later, Qin Sang obtained it and studied it for a long time, realizing it was impossible. Ancestor Kui Yin had merely cleverly refined it without destroying the pillar's inherent restrictions, then stored it away.</p><p>Qin Sang never thought he would see the Nine Nether Demonic Fire.</p><p>"With such a large mass of Nine Nether Demonic Fire, even if the entire dark iron pillar were forged into Ten Yama Banners, there would be enough for fifteen or sixteen…"</p><p>Qin Sang stroked the pillar, analyzing it.</p><p>His eyes widened. "Doesn't that mean I have the chance to refine a banner formation even stronger than the original Ten Yama Formation?!"</p><p>The original Ten Yama Formation, with all ten banners deployed, could withstand a blow from a top-grade magic treasure.</p><p>If he could successfully refine more banners and develop a suitable formation, he would undoubtedly possess the power of a top-grade magic treasure!</p>
