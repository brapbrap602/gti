<h1>Chapter 483: Astonishing Escape Speed</h1><p>Time waits for no one!  There’s no time to delay.</p><p>Qin Sang retracted his protective formation and darted out of the cave dwelling.  He glanced back at the cave, where he had stayed for only a month, then erased all traces of his presence.  He broke through the water's surface and flew directly towards the open water.</p><p>It was daytime, and the water was calm.  In the distance, only a few scattered islands were visible, with no sign of human activity.</p><p>Qin Sang revealed himself in mid-air. On a whim, he focused his thoughts, and the ebony sword flew out from his spirit.</p><p>The exceptionally pure wooden sword embryo floated before Qin Sang, looking even more captivating in the sunlight.  The ebony sword trembled slightly, emitting a faint hum, as if excited.</p><p>“Go!” Qin Sang commanded, pointing.</p><p>The ebony sword shone brightly, then vanished instantly.</p><p>Qin Sang shouted again, “Return!”</p><p>The ebony sword turned and steadily reappeared before him, but its aura had drastically changed, now radiating an overwhelming killing intent.</p><p>Qin Sang gazed at his natal spirit sword. Four killing runes were neatly arranged on the pure sword embryo—all complete.  The fourth rune had been fully inscribed the moment he broke through to the False Core realm.</p><p>He could feel the significant benefits the runes provided, especially in cultivation. If not for the bottleneck at the Core Formation stage, which hindered his progress, the four runes combined would allow his cultivation speed to surpass that of even three-spirit-root cultivators!</p><p>In the future, spirit root would no longer be his biggest limitation in cultivation. This 'talent' was quite high in the cultivation world.</p><p>While unsure if the *Spirit Sword Cultivation Chapter* would change the runes after reaching the Core Formation stage, Qin Sang was already very satisfied.</p><p>However, after inscribing the fourth rune, Qin Sang encountered a problem.  Previously, completing a rune had naturally led him to the next realm. After reaching the Foundation Establishment stage, Qin Sang had never experienced a bottleneck.</p><p>Perhaps comprehending the runes and his natal spirit sword was the bottleneck of the *Spirit Sword Cultivation Chapter*.  But even with his already artifact-level natal spirit sword, this time it didn't work. He couldn't even draw a single stroke for the fifth rune.  He was completely stumped facing the fifth level of the *Spirit Sword Cultivation Chapter*.</p><p>Qin Sang realized that he would have to overcome this hurdle on his own. After all, the improvement of minor realms is incomparable to the transformative leap of a major realm.</p><p>Luckily, he hadn't placed all his hope on the cultivation technique.</p><p>Qin Sang reached out and gently touched the ebony sword, which retracted its killing intent and became docile.  A chill ran through his fingertips, and he felt a sense of connection, like a blood bond, with the sword.</p><p>After reaching the False Core realm, his cultivation and spiritual sense had improved significantly, and Qin Sang clearly felt a greater control over the ebony sword.</p><p>Before, he had tried several times to use the Sword Qi Thunder Sound technique in conjunction with sword flight (sword-遁术) during man-sword unity, but had failed due to insufficient control.</p><p>Now, it should work!</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes narrowed as he formed a sword gesture, and the ebony sword emitted a clear hum.</p><p>Sword light enveloped him!</p><p>Qin Sang disappeared, becoming one with his spirit sword.  The ebony sword blazed with a light rivaling the sun, suddenly transforming into a dazzling rainbow and hurtling towards the scattered islands.</p><p>Under the clear sky, a brilliant sword light pierced the heavens, startling the fish in the water, causing them to dive deep.</p><p>Suddenly, a thunderclap roared in the bright daylight.</p><p>Amidst the thunder, the sword light's speed dramatically increased.  Even though the day was clear and cloudless, a thick bolt of lightning suddenly flashed across the sky.</p><p>*Rumble…*</p><p>The thunder roared, and then a low dragon's roar followed.</p><p>Although muffled, the dragon's roar was still clearly audible amidst the thunder, carrying the oppressive aura of a great demon. The moment the dragon roared, the aquatic creatures below plunged into terror, and the underwater world fell into chaos. Yet, the sword light in the sky, already at its peak speed, accelerated even further.</p><p>The dragon's roar was brief, almost disappearing the moment it sounded, fading with the thunder.</p><p>The sword light's speed abruptly dropped, finally stopping above a desolate stretch of water.</p><p>Qin Sang sheathed his sword and stood, a look of excitement in his eyes.  After breaking through to the False Core realm, he had successfully applied the Sword Qi Thunder Sound technique to his escape technique.</p><p>Other False Core cultivators could only eat his dust.</p><p>He's still not at his peak; his magical tools and abilities aren't fully utilized.  Once he successfully advances to the next stage of cultivation, his sword-flight technique will definitely surpass those of his peers, perhaps even rivaling mid-stage cultivators!</p><p>Even more exciting for Qin Sang was the effectiveness of the Nine Dragon Heavenly Chariot Talisman, a true secret technique from the Shangyuan Qingjing Palace.  It worked perfectly even when using his other abilities.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't help but think of the giant water dragon in the Wuyaya Valley.  Now, with his enhanced strength, he had nothing to fear from a peak-stage demonic cultivator. It was time to retrieve the dragon's essence!</p><p>With his sword energy and thunder, combined with the Nine Dragon Heavenly Chariot Talisman, his speed would rival early-stage cultivators. This bolstered his confidence.</p><p>Even if something goes wrong with Daoist Jiupao, escape would be easy.  And he still had the Xuantian Thunder, and...</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes flashed. He sheathed his ebony sword, ascended into the clouds, and returned to the  Luan Island waters.</p><p>He secretly entered the formation, bypassing his senior brother Rong and others, heading straight for Mist Island.</p><p>Half a day later, Qin Sang emerged from Mist Island, his expression somewhat gloomy. He'd learned that Ji Wu hadn't been present during the recent battle days ago—he'd left the Luan Island waters!</p><p>Perhaps Ji Wu took a different route.</p><p>Or perhaps Ji Wu doesn't know the Heart-Eating Insect Gu technique. He wasn't a remnant of the Kuiyin Sect; Daoist Jiupao took him in later. When the Kuiyin Sect was destroyed, the remaining insect Gu perished with Yi Tiannie. Without the Heart-Eating Insect corpses, the technique is useless, a waste of effort.  It's understandable that Daoist Jiupao didn't pass it on to Ji Wu.</p><p>Qin Sang had anticipated this.</p><p>He didn't stay long on Mist Island, only meeting the steward Bao who wanted to buy living corpses, before leaving the True Water Thousand Illusions Array.</p><p>...</p><p>The Earth-Sinking Cave.</p><p>Nearly a hundred years have passed, people have changed, but the baleful aura remains the same. Qin Sang no longer feared the cave's chill.  Familiar with the way, he slipped through a gap in the restrictions, silently arriving before the cave's chamber.</p><p>Inside, a disciple was diligently cultivating.  He'd prepared many warming artifacts, but the chill here wasn't easily dispelled, yet he persevered.</p><p>It was here that Qin Sang killed Sun De, obtaining his first magical tool—the key to later killing Yu Hua.  Destiny, it seemed.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at the scene and continued descending, finally reaching the stone platform near the earth's baleful energy, after passing through the layer of Yin煞 energy.</p><p>He set up concealing restrictions.</p><p>Qin Sang opened his corpse puppet bag. First, the Foundation Establishment late-stage corpse puppets flew out, taking up positions around him. Then, carefully, Qin Sang took out two bodies—still faintly warm, but their consciousness erased—placing them before him: Yu Hua and the man in yellow armor.</p>
