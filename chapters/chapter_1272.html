<h1>Chapter 1264:  The White Bone Corpse Flower</h1><p>Chapter 1264:  The White Bone Corpse Flower</p><p>Both sides exchanged blows.  After a series of attacks, Ye Laomo, Qing Jun, and Jing Yu successively entered the blood pool.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The ebony sword shot back, circling Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang coldly watched the figure before him.</p><p>“Should I call you Daoist Ye, or Blood Daoist?”</p><p>Ye Laomo’s blood demon incarnation and the *Zhong Yuan Mo Tai* technique seem similar at first glance, but are fundamentally different.</p><p>The *Zhong Yuan Mo Tai* is a soul-splitting method to cultivate a demonic seed, then using one's own essence blood to nurture the incarnation, which is gradually transformed to excel in bloodline magic.</p><p>Ye Laomo’s blood demon incarnation, however, is fundamentally rooted in bloodline secret arts, born from blood.</p><p>The blood demon incarnation cackled, “I am him, he is me! I regret not keeping you in Yuanxu back then. You’ve truly become a major threat!”</p><p>The blood demon incarnation didn’t pursue Qing Jun and Jing Yu, instead flashing to block Qin Sang.</p><p>Ye Laomo had fought Qin Sang before, knowing how difficult he was to deal with, valuing him no less than the Tongyou Demon Lord.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at the blood pool, knowing he would likely have a major battle with the blood demon incarnation first, needing to find a chance to get rid of it.</p><p>He was somewhat worried about Qing Jun.</p><p>Jing Yu had gone to find the corpse flower blood amber, unable to help Qing Jun for now.</p><p>Though Qin Sang found Qing Jun quite mysterious, he didn’t believe she could defeat Ye Laomo.  Facing Ye Laomo alone, he wondered how long she could hold out.</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>The starlight warrior roared.</p><p>The roar abruptly stopped; the starlight warrior vanished completely, leaving behind a ball of demonic fire that swirled back.</p><p>Having reduced the starlight warrior to its original form, Qin Sang didn’t hold back, unleashing the eighteen demonic banners.</p><p>The starlight warrior, ordered to block Qin Sang at all costs, would not retreat, unable to withstand the demonic fire's burning, its talismanic power exhausted, and it subsequently perished.</p><p>Seeing this, the blood demon incarnation's eyes narrowed sharply.</p><p>He could also kill the starlight warrior, but not as easily and quickly as Qin Sang.</p><p>Ye Laomo had a vivid memory of the demonic fire Qin Sang had commanded before.</p><p>Back then, only twelve demonic banners formed the array. Now, eighteen banners circled Qin Sang, and the demonic fire’s aura was incomparably stronger.</p><p>The blood demon incarnation knew Qin Sang’s strength had grown enormously, far exceeding his expectations.  </p><p>The sight of this demonic fire made him feel a chill down his spine.</p><p>However, retreat was impossible at this moment.</p><p>The blood demon incarnation licked his lips, summoning the Blood Moon Wheel again, a curtain of blood splashing out.</p><p>Simultaneously, he flicked his left fingers, a barely perceptible ripple appearing in the void, then instantly disappearing.</p><p>Qin Sang, about to propel the demonic fire forward, suddenly changed expression, letting out an angry roar, then instantly retreating several meters.</p><p>As Qin Sang retreated, more than a dozen crystalline, blood-red needles appeared out of thin air where he had stood, striking empty space.  Fine as a hair, they gently swayed in the air.</p><p>One needle had grazed his protective divine energy, seemingly ignoring it, like a fish eager to pierce through his defenses and into his body, luckily he reacted quickly enough.</p><p>These needles' fluctuations were subtle, concealed by the blood curtain, but not to the eyes of the Celestial Eye Butterfly.</p><p>The blood demon incarnation muttered a pitying sound, quickly recalling the needles.</p><p>His set of Cold Blood Needles was created years ago, after discovering the blood lake.  While refining the treasure banner, he collected the lake's blood energy and Yin邪 energy to forge these poisonous needles, recently perfected.</p><p>The Cold Blood Needles contained a strange poison, silent and deadly.  A careless opponent could easily be struck, their blood defiled, their cultivation severely impaired. It was truly vicious.</p><p>Unfortunately, the Cold Blood Needles were extremely fragile, usually sealed within a needle case.  Activation required preparation; he hadn't had time to use them against Qing Jun and Jing Yu.</p><p>Seeing the Cold Blood Needles fail, the blood demon incarnation retracted them, wielding the Blood Moon Wheel to fiercely attack Qin Sang. Simultaneously, he rapidly formed hand seals, the surrounding blood mist swirling wildly, the wind and clouds changing dramatically!</p><p>Qin Sang, instead of retreating, advanced. He wanted to force the blood demon incarnation back as soon as possible. With a thought, he unleashed the Nine Nether Demonic Fire.</p><p>For a moment, demonic flames filled the sky, and blood surged like a tide.</p><p>The two forces collided violently, producing terrifying shockwaves.</p><p>The commotion alarmed not only Elder Tian Zheng and the Tongyou Demon Lord, but also the cultivators within the two great formations at the blood pool entrance, each heart filled with anxiety.</p><p>Above the blood pool, everyone was divided into three battlefields.</p><p>In the blood pool...</p><p>Jing Yu successfully entered the blood pool and, seeing that the blood demon incarnation hadn't pursued her, her face lit up with joy.</p><p>She looked around.</p><p>The scene here hadn't changed significantly since then.</p><p>Countless black cables, like giant pythons, crisscrossed within the bloody water. Some were broken, but most remained intact, extending deep into the bottom of the blood pool.  However, after centuries, the sealing power on the cables had significantly weakened, noticeably less potent than two hundred years ago.</p><p>Tracing the network of cables, one could see that several converged towards a single point.</p><p>Jing Yu navigated between the cables, following one edge of the blood pool, observing and sensing the power of the runes on each.  Reaching the ninth, she identified her target and rapidly descended along it.</p><p>The surrounding miasma intensified, growing increasingly cold and chilling.  Ye Laomo and Qing Jun, having descended only a breath before her, were already out of sight.</p><p>Jing Yu knew exactly where they were headed, but the Corpse Flower Blood Amber was paramount; she had to secure it first.</p><p>The cables intertwined, stretching into the abyss.  Jing Yu followed the cable, descending to an unknown depth, finally reaching its end – the bottom of the blood pool.</p><p>Similar to the bottom of the blood river, it was desolate. The ground was jagged, its surface hardened into crystals by the bloody mist.</p><p>The cable led to a massive cage, dwarfing even the iron cages seen on the mountain of corpses. The cage's material was identical to the cables, clearly a single piece. Each pillar was as thick as the cables themselves, its surface covered in runes forming a unified seal, working with the cables to suppress the prisoner. However, the runes were dim, only emitting faint blood-like lightning, their power greatly diminished.  This was due to the cage being damaged.</p><p>Two pillars were broken in one corner, compromising the entire seal.  Inside the cage, a skeleton lay bound by chains! The flesh had long since decayed, leaving only the bones, remarkably preserved.</p><p>The skeleton was humanoid, undeniably dead, lying supine. However, its lower half was missing; whether this was due to torture before death, execution, or post-mortem degradation was unknown.</p><p>Jing Yu's eyes burned at the sight of the skeleton.  Several translucent flowers, like blood-red amber, radiated an eerie glow from its remains. The Corpse Flower Blood Amber, undeniably grown from the ancient cultivator's corpse!</p><p>“Five, as expected!”</p><p>Jing Yu nodded silently, immediately and without hesitation, darted to the damaged section of the cage and attacked.</p>
