Chapter 1324: Validating What Has Been Learned

"Greetings, Martial Uncle."

Tan Yi'en entered the room and bowed respectfully.

Qin Sang motioned for him to rise. "I asked you to secretly investigate Mu Yifeng's whereabouts. Have you found any leads?"

Qin Sang had always held Mu Yifeng's kindness close to his heart.

Upon returning to the Xiao Han Domain, Qin Sang had wanted to meet him. However, Mu Yifeng had been secluded in rigorous cultivation at Shaohua Mountain, leaving no opportunity. Later, after openly clashing with Dongyang Bo, Qin Sang refrained from seeking Mu Yifeng out to avoid implicating him.

Tan Yi'en replied, "Reporting to Martial Uncle, I have discreetly gathered some information by contacting rogue cultivators and deliberately interacting with disciples of Shaohua Mountain. Mu Yifeng is a reclusive cultivator who rarely shows himself. He has been in seclusion at a cave dwelling at the foot of Jingyue Peak. In recent years, he has not stepped out of Jingyue Peak even once, and few disciples of Shaohua Mountain know of his existence."

"Jingyue Peak?"

Qin Sang's eyes flickered.

If he remembered correctly, Jingyue Peak was once the cultivation ground of Chen Yan!

When he first joined Shaohua Mountain, Zhuang Yan had taken him on a tour of the mountain, specifically pointing out this peak. At that time, Jingyue Peak was a forbidden area, and disciples were not allowed to approach it.

Chen Yan had a significant background. After the incident, she did not completely sever ties with Dongyang Bo.

She had a mysterious master who was trapped in the Purple Palace, and it was uncertain when he might return.

Shaohua Mountain was vast, and there was no shortage of cave dwellings. Someone as shrewd as Dongyang Bo would not allow other disciples to cultivate on Jingyue Peak unless Chen Yan had given her permission.

"Could it be that Dongyang Bo did not vent his anger on Mu Yifeng because Chen Yan was secretly protecting him?"

Qin Sang pondered silently.

The true details were likely known only to those directly involved.

After a moment of thought, Qin Sang said, "Continue to have people stationed at the major markets outside Shaohua Mountain, waiting for Mu Yifeng to emerge from seclusion. Beyond that, do not take any unnecessary actions to avoid arousing suspicion from Shaohua Mountain."

Over the past decade, Dongyang Bo had kept a low profile and had not made any moves against Qin Sang or the Qingyang Temple.

By seizing the Nascent Soul Talisman Puppet and thwarting Dongyang Bo's plans, Qin Sang had vented his frustration. Later, with the guidance of his senior sister, his resentment had dissipated.

However, the tree may wish to remain still, but the wind will not cease.

For this reason, after Bai emerged from seclusion, Qin Sang deliberately left openings, giving Dongyang Bo opportunities.

If Dongyang Bo could remain this peaceful, both sides could coexist without conflict.

"Your disciple obeys!"

Tan Yi'en did not question the order and carried it out as instructed.

After giving a few more instructions, Qin Sang dismissed him.

Three days later.

Qin Sang left Wanye Mountain and returned to the Abyss Ruins.

He would take over from Canghong Zhenren to guard the Immortal Gate of the Sin God Palace for three years.

The spiritual energy here was abundant, and it would not hinder his cultivation. Additionally, Qin Sang needed a few years to solidify his knowledge of artifact refining before he could begin preparing to craft the artifact needed to subdue the South Ming Li Fire.

The Sea of Mist.

As soon as Qin Sang entered, Canghong Zhenren sensed his presence.

Canghong Zhenren flew over and clasped his hands in greeting. "I leave the rest to you, Fellow Daoist Qin."

Qin Sang took the jade token used to control the spirit formation and asked, "Has there been any unusual activity at the Immortal Gate in recent years?"

"None detected. Ye Laomo has been lying low, as expected. He is also waiting for the Purple Palace to emerge. However, Fellow Daoist Qin should not let your guard down," Canghong Zhenren shook his head slightly, offering a reminder.

Qin Sang nodded thoughtfully, then remembered something else. "How are the fellow Daoists who consumed the Withered Essence Pill doing now?"

"All of them are suffering from the decline of their essence, energy, and spirit! Despite their best efforts, Feng Laoguai and the others can only slow the rate of decline. What's more terrifying is that one fellow Daoist has a vague premonition that his heavenly tribulation might arrive early!"

Canghong Zhenren shook his head, his expression filled with lingering fear. "If this is true, it would be best to keep such pills locked away!"

"Heavenly tribulation arriving early?"

Qin Sang was inwardly shocked.

This price was even more terrifying than the decline of essence, energy, and spirit. Ye Laomo's schemes were truly sinister.

After seeing off Canghong Zhenren, Qin Sang entered the Seven Waters Maze Formation, mastering every variation of the spirit formation. The other Daoists stationed here came out to greet Qin Sang, and after familiarizing themselves with each other, they each found a place to cultivate without disturbing one another.

Qin Sang arrived at the core of the Seven Waters Maze Formation.

Any changes at the Immortal Gate would be immediately detected here, and he could cultivate without fear of being spied upon.

To be cautious, Qin Sang set up a layer of isolation barriers before summoning the Nascent Soul Talisman Puppet.

The Nascent Soul Talisman Puppet had now been fully subdued by Qin Sang and had regained its former strength. With the protection of the Jade Buddha, Qin Sang was not afraid of the puppet rebelling and could freely control it, making it an excellent assistant.

Of course, what Qin Sang valued most was the soul shadow within the puppet.

He skillfully merged his consciousness with the Nascent Soul Talisman Puppet, experiencing the soul shadow. The entire process consumed a great deal of mental energy, and when Qin Sang felt a hint of fatigue, he put away the puppet and began cultivating, reflecting on what he had just learned.

Next, he took out the Demon Banner and refined the "Nine Nether Demon Fire" until he was exhausted.

After completing these tasks, he reviewed the texts of the Void Spirit Sect, contemplating the art of artifact refining.

Every day was packed with tasks.

For the past ten years, Qin Sang had spent every day like this, never slacking off. The most noticeable improvement was in his artifact refining skills. He had learned many precious secret techniques from the Void Spirit Sect, which had been of great help.

In the blink of an eye, another two years passed in the Abyss Ruins, and Ye Laomo still showed no signs of movement.

On this day, Qin Sang summoned the Golden Sinking Sword.

For a long time to come, the Golden Sinking Sword would replace the Ebony Sword as the spiritual sword he used to perform his sword techniques.

According to Qin Sang's plan, he would start with the Golden Sinking Sword to validate his progress in the art of artifact refining, then craft the artifact needed to subdue the South Ming Li Fire, and finally refine the Charred Wood.

At the same time, he took out several precious spiritual materials.

These were all wood-element treasures.

There were not many, only a few types.

This was because Qin Sang had used most of his battle merits to exchange for fire-element spiritual materials.

However, if he could successfully refine these few spiritual materials together with the Golden Sinking Wood, he should be able to elevate the Golden Sinking Wood to the level of a high-grade magic treasure, which would suffice for the time being.

As for top-grade magic treasures, they were not so easily crafted. Not only did he lack sufficient materials, but even if he gathered them, Qin Sang was not confident he could succeed.

"Root Transformation Stone, Azure Silver..."

Qin Sang's gaze swept over the spiritual materials one by one. Then, he formed a hand seal, closed his eyes, and activated a secret technique he had learned from the Void Spirit Sect to analyze them.

Through generations of accumulation, the Void Spirit Sect had amassed dozens of secret techniques related to this step alone, each tailored to different types of spiritual materials.

A rogue cultivator, unless exceptionally talented, would not have the ability to create such techniques on their own.

In the past, Qin Sang would have expended a great deal of energy on this step, but now it was much easier.

After completing this step, Qin Sang activated a new secret technique and summoned the Nine Nether Demon Fire.

Using the power of the demon fire, he refined the impurities from the spiritual materials one by one, while also melting the Golden Sinking Sword into a sword embryo.

Without the aid of earth fire, Qin Sang had to endure the tremendous consumption of the demon fire. He frequently took out pills to replenish his true essence.

Qin Sang meticulously completed each step of the refining process. When he encountered difficulties, he paused to reflect and make improvements, gaining significant insights.

In the end, he watched as the Golden Sinking Sword was reborn in his hands, completing its transformation!
