<h1>Chapter 1685: True Spirit Feedback, Three Corpses Burned</h1><p>Su Zinan casually tossed out a wisp of gossamer.</p><p>The gossamer unfurled, revealing itself as Su Zinan's usual dragon tendon net, previously coiled and now reshaped.  </p><p>Each tendon was woven into the net, which when spread resembled a chessboard.  A shimmering light played across its surface, making it seem as though dragons and snakes were slithering there.</p><p>Their expressions ferocious, they appeared majestic and extraordinary.</p><p>Su Zinan was clearly prepared.  Almost the instant the heavenly thunder appeared, the dragon tendon net was deployed, rapidly expanding above his head.</p><p>The net tautened, emitting a resonant hum, like the ringing of swords.</p><p>The spiritual mist surged, the dragons and snakes reared their heads.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The heavenly thunder descended with unstoppable force.</p><p>In an instant, the spiritual mist dissipated, pierced clean through by the heavenly thunder, the illusory dragons and snakes collapsing.</p><p>A deep crater suddenly appeared in the center of the dragon tendon net. The power of the heavenly thunder exploded across the net, countless threads of lightning spreading along the tendon’s network, transforming it into a net of lightning.</p><p>The tendons seemed to possess life, convulsing under the heavenly thunder’s assault. The net twisted into a tight ball, trapping the heavenly thunder within.</p><p>Su Zinan ignored the spectacle above, his gaze shifting to the lightning-fast figure fleeing before him. He chuckled.  “So this is your avatar!”</p><p>He recognized Qin Sang's avatar.</p><p>Years ago, the avatar had visited the Old Man of Yan Shan, later turning against him in the snowy plains, splitting the deceased Water Phase Master’s legacy.  </p><p>After capturing the Old Man of Yan Shan, Su Zinan identified the avatar’s origins and learned of its connection to the Fire Demon, with whom it had collaborated in the snowy plains.</p><p>The Fire Demon blocked Lao Wu outside the tomb.</p><p>The Moon Princess ‘died’ at the avatar’s hands.</p><p>Working together, inside and out, if not for the Old Man of Yan Shan's superior skills, none of the treasures in the tomb would have been retrieved.</p><p>Their simultaneous appearance on Mount Di Shou further confirmed their relationship.</p><p>Su Zinan, aware of the Fire Demon’s presence, decided to act now.</p><p>Previous encounters revealed the Fire Demon’s lack of weaknesses, making it a formidable opponent. Su Zinan had abandoned the idea of imprisoning its Nascent Soul.</p><p>He considered the Fire Demon a powerful enemy. If the avatar and Fire Demon were to reunite, and the Five Elements Pill fell into the Fire Demon’s hands, it would be nearly impossible for anyone else to retrieve it.</p><p>The Fire Demon was nowhere to be seen, either frightened away or lurking in the shadows.</p><p>The avatar surely wouldn't expect anyone to dare seize the Five Elements Pill right under the nose of a Nascent Soul cultivator. Its guard was at its lowest, maximizing the chances of success.</p><p>However, Su Zinan hadn't anticipated the strength of their bond.</p><p>The external avatar, born from a reputable orthodox sect, while subject to limitations, possessed flawlessly integrated energy and profound abilities, far exceeding those of ordinary unorthodox techniques.</p><p>An external avatar appearing alone could deceive even a Nascent Soul cultivator.</p><p>Of course, it was possible their attention was diverted by the demonic body, preventing them from thoroughly investigating the avatar.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn’t fathom the capabilities of a Nascent Soul cultivator and felt some apprehension, fearing the avatar’s true nature couldn’t be concealed from such a powerful opponent.</p><p>Even with the memories of Lao Wu and the Old Man of Yan Shan, Su Zinan, having ‘seen’ both the avatar and its master, had difficulty connecting them.</p><p>With the situation urgent, Qin Sang had no reason to hide anything further. Both the master and avatar appeared simultaneously. Su Zinan sensed the faint connection between them and immediately understood.</p><p>“You’re courting death!”</p><p>Qin Sang roared.</p><p>From the escaping light, Qin Sang's gaze held a terrifying killing intent, like two sharp swords piercing Su Zinan’s eyes.</p><p>Su Zinan sneered, unconcerned by Qin Sang's threat, retorting, “A late-stage Nascent Soul cultivator, plus an external avatar wielding a spiritual treasure, yet still outsmarted by that old ghost of Yan Shan, allowing him to steal the Water Phase legacy and escape unscathed… calling you a good-for-nothing isn’t an exaggeration…”</p><p>His taunts were cut short by the incoming sword light.</p><p>The Jin Chen Sword pierced through the air, faster than Qin Sang himself.</p><p>Its piercing cry, sharp and urgent, seemed amplified by its master’s fury.</p><p>Su Zinan, having witnessed the power of Qin Sang's sword array, his expression turned serious. Before the Jin Chen Sword could approach, he mentally controlled the Black Ruler, which had been relentlessly attacking the Sword Star.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>The Ruler’s shadow retracted, its direction reversed, its body slightly angled to meet the Jin Chen Sword.</p><p>Bursts of black light erupted from the Black Ruler, the explosive sound like thunder. The black light resembled blooming demonic thunder blossoms, its aura as violent as lightning.</p><p>Wherever it passed, the demonic thunder blossoms continued to bloom, countless black threads spreading through the surrounding void.</p><p>The scene was as if the void itself was shattered by the Black Ruler.</p><p>As the black ruler moved, its power surged, building layer upon layer until the ruler itself vanished, leaving only a black sun and a massive sun-like aura centered around it.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>Sword light blazed, a long rainbow piercing the sun!</p><p>A point of light appeared at the black sun's center, then the entire sun shattered from the inside out, revealing the black ruler within.</p><p>At this moment, the Jinchen Sword disappeared.  The void had grown dim, filled with crisscrossing sword threads.  A sword formation merged with the sun's aura, relentlessly shredding the black ruler's power.</p><p>A clang of metal echoed as the black ruler violently trembled.  Ruler shadows rained down, scattering in all directions.</p><p>Su Zinan had intentionally allowed the Jinchen Sword to approach. The black sun-ruler locked onto the sword formation. Though the aura was being dispersed by the sword formation, it held its form, engaging the opponent relentlessly regardless of cost.</p><p>Everything proceeded as expected. Su Zinan ignored it all, his gaze fixed on the sword star, seemingly piercing through the starlight to see the hidden avatar.</p><p>He had no intention of confronting Qin Sang's Yuan Ying (spiritual body). First, Qin Sang was too powerful, and second, the threat of the Nascent Soul stage loomed.  Engaging Qin Sang here would be unwise.</p><p>His only objective: the Five Elements Pill!</p><p>The avatar, relying on its spiritual treasure, divine light, and the sword star's intent, managed to hold its ground against Su Zinan and the two demonic souls.</p><p>Su Zinan glanced at the two demonic souls, his eyes narrowing slightly.</p><p>Even while engaging Qin Sang's main body from a distance, his actions never ceased. The blood energy between him and the two souls grew stronger, the stench becoming sickeningly foul.</p><p>The intense blood light was blinding, even surpassing the sword star's brilliance.</p><p>The blood energy formed a triangle, with Su Zinan's main body and the two demonic souls at its vertices. The demonic banner stood beside Su Zinan. The sword star, now dim, resembled a lone ship in a sea of blood, teetering on the brink of capsizing.</p><p>Su Zinan didn't create this spectacle by accident. While the blood energy was invisible to the naked eye, its growing power was palpable.</p><p>Su Zinan cast a sidelong glance at Qin Sang's main body, letting out a cruel laugh, and struck the demonic banner.</p><p>*Slap!*</p><p>The Three Corpse Devouring Banner swayed.</p><p>The banner unfurled, releasing a faceless head.</p><p>This was the third demonic soul, its Yuan Ying not yet integrated.</p><p>Forced from the banner, the faceless soul faced its master and its two fully formed companions. Though incapable of showing emotion, its fear was evident.</p><p>The thick blood energy caused it to tremble, shrinking back in terror.</p><p>Su Zinan coldly snorted, emitting an unintelligible syllable. The faceless soul was instantly immobilized, unable to resist as it flew to Su Zinan.</p><p>The next moment, a stream of light shot from Su Zinan's head. His Yuan Ying left his body, paused briefly, then flew towards the faceless soul.</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>The Yuan Ying merged. The faceless soul let out a piercing shriek, its face bulging outwards.</p><p>The shriek ceased, features forming, becoming an exact replica of Su Zinan.</p><p>True spirit returned, the three corpses united!</p><p>Su Zinan, reborn as a demonic soul, stood beside his main body, close to the demonic banner, eyes downcast. He wasn't looking at the sword star, but at the churning blood energy.</p><p>Under his gaze, the blood energy suddenly stilled, becoming perfectly calm.  Then, streaks of blood light emerged within it, three particularly thick ones standing out at the edges.</p><p>These three beams connected with the three demonic souls, forming a triangular blood array.</p><p>Within the array, denser blood threads, thick and thin, formed grotesque images of blood demons and ghosts, far more hideous and terrifying than anything from legend.</p><p>The sword star lay at the heart of this blood array, surrounded by countless demonic creatures, seemingly cast from a blood river into an inescapable hell.  Even its light was tainted by evil.</p><p>"Burn Spirit!"</p><p>Su Zinan's demonic soul howled.</p><p>His voice was discernible in the howl, though somewhat ethereal.</p><p>The Wu Lao and Yanshan Old Man demonic souls roared in unison.</p><p>In an instant, blood light shot towards the heavens.</p><p>This was Su Zinan's most powerful blood-based technique, the Burning Spirit Blood Sacrifice.</p><p>This technique was related to the cultivation method he and Wu Lao practiced, but wasn't originally part of it. It was deduced and passed on by Lu Lao Mo.</p><p>Lu Lao Mo's cultivation wasn't based on blood, but he understood the principles of analogy and had a keen interest in blood cultivation.</p><p>He enslaved Old Wu, recognizing his exceptional talent which could enhance his demonic cultivation.  In fact, Lu Laomo and Old Wu were both master and servant, and also like master and disciple.</p><p>As Old Wu rapidly progressed, Lu Laomo’s demonic power reached its peak, allowing him to develop the formidable technique, Burning Spirit Blood Sacrifice.</p><p>Su Zinan cultivated a technique that fused Lu Laomo's demonic arts and Old Wu's blood cultivation.  He leaned more towards Old Wu's methods due to his extensive tutelage, but even with his current cultivation, performing the Burning Spirit Blood Sacrifice was extremely strenuous, requiring the Three Corpse Death Banner.</p><p>With three complete souls, it would be much easier.  With two souls missing one, it was barely feasible. However, the incomplete soul triad necessitated a spirit-replenishment step. Without prior preparation, he had to corner his opponent on Sword Star, as he did now, to ensure success.</p><p>Spirit replenishment would also weaken him and his demonic soul; thus, he couldn't use it carelessly.  Previously, battling Mo Xingdao, Su Zinan repeatedly tried to corner him, but Mo Xingdao's puppet escape technique was too powerful; each attempt failed, preventing him from using the Burning Spirit Blood Sacrifice.</p><p>Now, to seize the Five Element Pill, Su Zinan held nothing back!  Three souls united, the blood array formed.</p><p>In the blinding crimson light, the blood array's outline sharpened. The demonic entities within seemed to come alive, scrambling towards the central Sword Star.</p><p>Sword Star was no longer visible; a giant blood bubble appeared at the array's core, enduring terrible impacts.  A tremendous explosion echoed from within.</p><p>Qin Sang's main body witnessed this, his eyes blazing with fury.  The罡 fire shield protected him as he instantly burst through the black ruler's halo.  A red light flashed; the Solar God Tree, resplendent, spun into action.</p><p>Su Zinan's demonic soul let out a low growl.  The three demonic souls beneath it trembled, transforming into three beams of light that shot towards the top of the blood array.</p><p>The beams converged, forming a giant dozens of meters tall. The giant's features were disproportionate, though closer inspection revealed a resemblance to Su Zinan, along with hints of Old Wu and Old Yan Shan.  The three souls’ essences were oddly blended.</p><p>The giant wasn't solid; like the demonic souls, it was somewhat translucent, ethereal.</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>The giant opened its eyes, glaring at Qin Sang's main body. Its pupils reflected the intense fiery light, mirroring the Solar God Tree.</p><p>The Burning Spirit Blood Sacrifice was complete. Sword Star was swallowed by the crimson light; the central bubble displayed various distorted, eerie shadows.  The pressure on the avatar instantly skyrocketed to terrifying levels.</p><p>With the Five Element Pill almost within reach, Su Zinan wouldn't allow Qin Sang's main body to interfere. The giant stepped forward, blocking Qin Sang, as if looking down on an ant.  It raised a finger, drawing a line.</p><p>A faint crimson glow shimmered at its fingertip. The line left a striking blood mark, like opening a gate to a blood hell in the void.  It shot towards the Solar God Tree at incredible speed, an endless torrent of blood pouring forth.</p><p>Su Zinan intended a preemptive strike.  Though he'd never personally experienced it, he’d witnessed the Solar God Bird several times, understanding its power. This attack, even if it failed to repel Qin Sang, would certainly impede the Solar God Bird.  A fleeting moment would be enough to break through Sword Star and seize Qin Sang's avatar.</p><p>The Solar God Tree shone brilliantly. The South Ming Li Fire danced across its trunk, converging at the top to form the Solar God Bird.</p><p>Facing the oncoming blood scar, the Solar God Tree's brilliance didn't diminish; instead, the crimson light made it even more vibrant, the divine bird lifelike. The tree trembled slightly; the bird spread its wings.</p><p>The giant's gaze sharpened.</p><p>Suddenly, a change occurred. A sharp cry echoed from within Qin Sang – not from Qin Sang himself, but from his dantian!</p><p>Within the dantian:</p><p>The Cloud Touring Sword's intent had been working with the poison bead to suppress the Gu King.  Suddenly, both lost control.</p><p>The sword intent intensified, disrupting the balance.  To the Gu King, this signaled an attack, triggering instinctive resistance; it unleashed a torrent of poison light.</p><p>The poison light erupted in Qin Sang's dantian. This was incredibly risky, but Qin Sang had preemptively activated the poison bead to protect himself, hoping to weaken the poison's potency.  He deliberately guided the poison light towards the giant.</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>The giant's demonic soul, anticipating the Solar God Bird, was caught off guard by the sudden poison light from Qin Sang, instantly affected.  The potency of the poison caused its body to stiffen.</p><p>Having witnessed the grotesque death of the strange-faced man, and drawing on Lu Zhang's experience, Qin Sang knew the Gu King's poison could injure soul bodies, but wasn't sure of its effect on the merged three demonic souls. His aim wasn't to kill the demonic soul, but to use the poison’s brief intrusion to slow the opponent’s reaction, creating an opportunity.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>The Solar God Tree erupted in unprecedented brightness.  The fire bird spread its wings, leaving the branch.  Not three, but six!</p><p>Six fire birds launched!  In an instant, Qin Sang's true essence drained like a burst dam, leaving him utterly weak.</p><p>Su Zinan forcefully suppressed the poison within the giant, only to see the blood scar consumed by a blaze of fire.</p>
