<h1>Chapter 1104: Mei Gu</h1><p>After retrieving the Demon-Binding Rope, Qin Sang didn’t linger long in the ancient cultivator’s mansion.  Leaving the secret realm, he decided to travel east, entering through Yin Mountain Pass.  Yin Mountain Pass, previously occupied by a Yuan Ying cultivator, served as a buffer zone between the righteous and demonic paths, safer than Xuanlu Pass, provided that Qixiong Pass hadn't changed hands.</p><p>Along the way east, Qin Sang occasionally fed the Fire Jade Centipede some Chihuo Liujin.  After spending time together, the centipede was less resistant to him. Qin Sang kept a small amount of Chihuo Liujin for emergencies, giving the rest to the centipede; whether it would evolve or not was up to fate.</p><p>The spiritual tide was weakening day by day. By the time Qin Sang reached Yin Mountain Pass, it had virtually disappeared. He finally encountered other cultivators, learning why the Ancient Immortal Battlefield was so sparsely populated and gaining some understanding of the cultivation world's situation.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, after the closure of Ziwei Palace, the Abyss launched a relentless invasion of the Tianxing Alliance. Fortunately, the Abyss's surprise attack using the celestial array didn't cripple Xiaohan Domain or the Tianxing Alliance. Instead, it spurred both domains to set aside their differences and unite against the Abyss.</p><p>This led to a century-long war with no clear victor. The Abyss was powerful. Even with the combined forces of the Tianxing Alliance and Xiaohan Domain, they initially lost ground, relinquishing a large portion of the Tianxing Alliance's territory before finally stabilizing their position.  The Abyss, unable to completely conquer the two domains, persistently harassed them without fully withdrawing.</p><p>The primary focus of various factions was resisting the Abyss. Only in the twenty years before the reappearance of Ziwei Palace, with the return of the spiritual tide, did the situation begin to ease. No one anticipated the war would last so long.  Cultivators from the three domains gradually adapted to this state of perpetual conflict.</p><p>Xiaohan Domain and the Tianxing Alliance, united in their common enemy, formed an alliance, abandoning their previous antagonism and even showing signs of integration. Xiaohan Domain also ceased restricting Tianxing Alliance cultivators from entering the Ancient Immortal Battlefield.  The two sides faced each other at the border.</p><p>Consequently, cultivators stationed at Qixiong Pass were redeployed. Due to various factors, most of the important passes were closed, barring entry and exit except under special circumstances. Because Yin Mountain Pass lay between the righteous and demonic paths, it remained open—aside from the Wan Yao City controlled by the demon race—becoming the sole passage for cultivators entering the Ancient Immortal Battlefield. This was a jointly agreed-upon decision by the various factions.</p><p>Approaching Yin Mountain Pass, Qin Sang increasingly encountered cultivators from both Xiaohan Domain and the Tianxing Alliance, though their overall cultivation level was low, with few above the late Foundation Establishment stage.  It was said that before the opening of Ziwei Palace, the two-domain alliance had massed troops at the border to defend against the Abyss.</p><p>This situation was far better than Qin Sang had anticipated; he’d even prepared for the possibility of Xiaohan Domain's complete defeat. He learned that the war had led the two-domain alliance to place great importance on cultivators within their borders who had reached the Foundation Establishment stage and above. Everyone had to register and be prepared for mobilization.</p><p>Entering and exiting Yin Mountain Pass involved checks, requiring a token issued by the two-domain alliance.  During the height of the conflict, if Qin Sang had attempted to disguise himself, he would have faced many difficulties. Thankfully, with the situation easing, the checks weren't as strict.</p><p>However, a late Nascent Soul cultivator would be far too conspicuous among these low-level cultivators.  Someone of that level, even a hermit cultivator, couldn't remain unknown and would easily attract attention.</p><p>Learning that Shao Hua Shan and Dong Yang Bo were still alive and their reputation even higher than when he left, Qin Sang was even more cautious. After some thought, he decided to prematurely disperse his cultivation base.</p><p>Dissipating the killing talismans created by Elder Qingzhu, Qin Sang's cultivation fell back to the early Nascent Soul stage. He could immediately return to the mid-stage by adding the sixth killing talisman stroke.  Qin Sang resisted the urge, put on a mask, and headed for Yin Mountain Pass.</p><p>Unexpectedly, signs of a celestial phenomenon appeared mid-journey. Qin Sang flew for a while before finding a shelter, built in a valley between two barren mountains. The ground was hollowed out, creating a circular space.  Layered restrictions showed the shelter had existed for a long time, sheltering countless cultivators.</p><p>Entering, Qin Sang found dozens of cultivators already inside.  He concealed his aura, disguised as a Foundation Establishment cultivator, and mingled with the crowd, subtly gathering information.</p><p>As the celestial phenomenon approached, waves of cultivators arrived. Then, three men and a woman entered the shelter.  The female cultivator was strikingly beautiful, with alluring eyes and a mastery of seductive techniques. Two of the men were middle-aged, and the other appeared young. All four were surprisingly Foundation Establishment experts!</p><p>"The Four Devil Hermits!" a low gasp arose.</p><p>The crowd stirred.  The four seemed to have a notorious reputation. Yet, under the watchful eyes of everyone, they calmly walked into the shelter. The slightly crowded space quickly made way for them.</p><p>Hearing the cultivators nearby discuss the four individuals, Qin Sang looked over, a flicker of surprise crossing his eyes.  One of the young men emanated a familiar aura.</p><p>Immediately, Qin Sang removed his ring, stood up, and walked directly towards the Four Demon Cultivators. His actions drew many eyes; the onlookers showed varied expressions.</p><p>The Four Demon Cultivators noticed Qin Sang simultaneously. The alluring woman smiled radiantly, secretly employing her seductive arts, while the three men glared at him fiercely.</p><p>Qin Sang remained composed, steadily approaching the group.  Then, they noticed something amiss. Their companion, the young man, was trembling violently, drenched in sweat, his eyes wide with terror, as if he had seen a ghost.</p><p>The three were well aware of their companion's strength; this sight filled them with utter astonishment.</p><p>"Sit."</p><p>Qin Sang said softly, reaching the young man.</p><p>The young man collapsed onto the ground, the immense pressure finally lifting. He gasped for breath, exhausted, his sweat-soaked brow untouched. He wanted to prostrate himself, but Qin Sang stopped him.</p><p>The other three, still shaken, though unsure what had befallen their companion, dared not act up, sitting quietly beside him, silent as mice.</p><p>"You are a Fire Demon? From whom did you learn the *Seven Yang Scripture*?"</p><p>Qin Sang cast a soundproofing barrier and asked.</p><p>The *Seven Yang Scripture* was a high-level cultivation technique created by the Golden Core cultivator, Jiupao Daoist, after he founded the Flame Demon Sect, and passed down as the sect's most precious legacy.  It required the power of earthfire for cultivation, imbuing those who practiced it with a unique aura. Qin Sang had encountered this aura when he met with Flame Demon Sect disciples years ago.</p><p>The young man responded meekly, "With all due respect, senior, I am from the Flame Demon Sect. The *Seven Yang Scripture* was personally taught to me by my master's senior brother."</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang instantly identify his cultivation technique, the young man felt apprehensive, worried about a possible feud between Qin Sang and his sect, but he dared not conceal the truth.</p><p>The Flame Demon Sect still existed!  Qin Sang recalled that after eliminating the remaining members of the Kuiyin Sect, he had entrusted the Flame Demon Sect to a disciple named Mei Gu, appointing her as the leader, before leaving and never returning.  At that time, Mei Gu, a Foundation Establishment cultivator, was already the most powerful member of the sect.</p>
