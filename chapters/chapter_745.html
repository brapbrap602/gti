<h1>Chapter 737: Breakthrough</h1><p>He had assumed Qin Sang, facing two powerful demons, would be in grave danger.  Instead, not only did Qin Sang survive, but she quickly killed them both—a feat even he would struggle to achieve.</p><p>“Daoist Master, please lend me your aid!”</p><p>Yuan San Zhenren urgently transmitted his voice.</p><p>After Qin Sang killed the black hawk, she sensed the other demons, who had been approaching, now hesitated, some retreating, others lingering. Only the less intelligent lesser demons continued their relentless advance.</p><p>Hearing Yuan San Zhenren’s message, Qin Sang turned, and her heart leaped at the sight of the giant turtle’s gaze.</p><p>Without hesitation, Qin Sang chose to move against the flow, to rescue Yuan San Zhenren.</p><p>The reason was simple: the rage in the giant turtle's eyes was almost palpable.  Years ago, it had been outwitted by Qin Sang due to its poor evasion skills. Now, its attempt to overwhelm Qin Sang with a demonic horde had backfired spectacularly.  A tiny insect, easily crushed, repeatedly escaping its grasp—the turtle was bordering on madness.</p><p>Qin Sang felt the turtle losing its composure.</p><p>If it prioritized killing her even at the cost of letting Yuan San Zhenren escape, Yuan San Zhenren, realizing their past conflict, would undoubtedly abandon her to draw the turtle away, allowing her to escape alone.</p><p>Elsewhere, with her significantly improved evasion skills, Qin Sang wouldn't fear the turtle’s pursuit. But deep within the beast tide, a quick escape was impossible. Being entangled by the giant turtle would be extremely dangerous.</p><p>By acting against expectation, before Yuan San Zhenren could suspect anything, she could join forces with him, greatly increasing their chances of survival—at least until reinforcements arrived.</p><p>“Thank you, Daoist Master!”</p><p>Mistaking Qin Sang’s action for a selfless rescue, Yuan San Zhenren and the others were deeply grateful.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang dare to approach, the giant turtle roared in fury.</p><p>Qin Sang deliberately charged into the encirclement, standing beside Yuan San Zhenren, enduring the turtle’s furious assault.  Yuan San Zhenren and the others remained oblivious to her past with the beast.</p><p>With Qin Sang’s arrival, and the loss of two powerful demons, the tide began to turn, and hope for escape flickered.</p><p>After a brief, silent consultation, Qin Sang and Yuan San Zhenren began to strategically shift the battle, pushing towards the edge of the beast tide.  Surrounded by chaos, unable to see the broader situation, they feared attracting another giant turtle-like demon.</p><p>Yuan San Zhenren was exceptionally powerful, only slightly weaker than the giant turtle. With Qin Sang's assistance, he could finally fight without restraint.</p><p>His innate treasure was a seven-tiered pagoda of astonishing weight; each strike could inflict grievous injury. Even the giant turtle treated its descent with caution.</p><p>Qin Sang witnessed a demon, slightly weaker than the bizarre flying fish, fail to dodge and be struck, coughing up blood.</p><p>Qin Sang identified the weakest point in the encirclement and guided Yuan San Zhenren.  The giant turtle and its horde pressed their relentless attack, but the battlefield slowly shifted outwards.</p><p>The world was painted crimson.</p><p>Qin Sang lost count of the demons she had slain, consuming several spirit restoration pills.</p><p>“We’re almost out!”</p><p>Suddenly, she heard Yuan San Zhenren’s transmitted voice.  Startled, she looked up and saw the edge of the beast tide. After immense struggle, they had broken through.</p><p>“Fellow Daoists, after we escape, the Daoist Master and I will hold off the giant turtle.  You must flee and seek reinforcements!” Yuan San Zhenren’s transmitted voice was heavy with exhaustion.</p><p>Before Qin Sang’s arrival, they had been besieged for some time. Yuan San Zhenren, with his highest cultivation and abundant true energy, could still hold on, but the others were severely depleted, nearing exhaustion.</p><p>After a few dozen breaths…</p><p>A breach opened in the beast tide’s perimeter.</p><p>Seeing the blue sky and ocean beyond, some wept with relief, marveling at the beauty of the world.</p><p>“Go!”</p><p>Yuan San Zhenren roared, infusing his true energy into the pagoda, which swelled to a ten-foot-tall stone tower, crashing down on the giant turtle.</p><p>The tower’s weight and force were immense.</p><p>Simultaneously, Qin Sang and the two-headed… launched a powerful assault, driving back the surrounding demons.  Seizing the opportunity, the others scattered, fleeing for their lives.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang and Yuan San Zhenren charged out.</p><p>As expected, the giant turtle ignored the others, pursuing them relentlessly.</p><p>Qin Sang and Yuan San Zhenren flew side-by-side, glancing back at the giant turtle.  Qin Sang's eyes flashed, and she said in a low voice, “Daoist Master Yuan San, this demon is relentless.  Tu Yuan Island is closest from here…”</p><p>"I've just sent for reinforcements, leading it towards Tu Yuan Island to meet up with other cultivators.  We might have a chance to hunt down this beast!"</p><p>Master Yuan San glanced at Mu Yuan Island, besieged by the monstrous tide, and after a moment's hesitation, sighed softly, "I have several acquaintances missing on the island. I don't know how they are faring.  We can't go back to save them until we've dealt with this creature.  Let's follow your plan, Daoist. I hope the cultivators on Tu Yuan Island arrive quickly."</p><p>Qin Sang's face brightened. "This beast tide is unlike any before. I arrived from the deep sea, and even more demonic beasts are continuously arriving. After they occupy Mu Yuan Island, they won't stop there.  Wu Yuan Island won't be spared either. I've made the dangers clear; as long as those cultivators aren't shortsighted, they'll know what's at stake."</p><p>"Daoist, is that really all of the beast tide?"</p><p>Master Yuan San was shocked, then sighed deeply. "Wu Yuan Island has existed for a long time, it seems the demonic race can no longer endure. I wonder if Wu Yuan Island can withstand this onslaught. Otherwise, it'll become another lost island, a thing of the past..."</p><p>The two changed direction and flew towards Tu Yuan Island.  Qin Sang could have easily escaped the giant turtle faster, but he was deliberately leading it, and so he didn't.</p><p>Across the vast ocean, two streaks of light flew side-by-side, their speeds matching. Behind them, the giant turtle trod the water like a phantom, seemingly about to catch up, yet always falling slightly short.</p><p>It attacked with beams of mystic light, almost always targeting Qin Sang, but he effortlessly dodged each one.</p><p>As the chase continued, Mu Yuan Island gradually disappeared from view, leaving only the towering demonic energy and the cacophony of roars.</p><p>Reaching this point, the giant turtle hesitated.</p><p>It realized it had been tricked. These two, who appeared weak and exhausted, were actually brimming with energy.  After such a long chase, their speed showed no sign of slowing.</p><p>Just as it hesitated, dozens of streaks of light appeared on the distant horizon, accompanied by the piercing sound of breaking air.</p><p>"Reinforcements!"</p><p>The two cultivators were invigorated, turning their heads simultaneously.</p><p>The reinforcements also noticed the disturbance. Several streaks of light accelerated sharply, rushing towards them.</p><p>The giant turtle felt a sense of foreboding and plunged into the water, paddling furiously, attempting to flee into the deeper demonic sea.</p><p>Qin Sang and Master Yuan San were unwilling to let it escape, doing everything they could to prevent its retreat, until finally the reinforcements arrived. Under the combined assault of numerous cultivators, even the giant turtle’s formidable defenses proved insufficient. With a roar of rage and despair, it met its end.</p>
