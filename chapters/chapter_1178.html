<h1>Chapter 1170: The Duel</h1><p>Chapter 1170: The Duel</p><p>“You two mean you want me to compensate for your losses?”</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't surprised.</p><p>Cultivators at this level stand at the pinnacle of the cultivation world.  They rarely risk their lives in combat, as few are confident of killing their opponent.</p><p>A vengeful Yuan Ying cultivator is a headache for anyone.</p><p>“Since you two came prepared, you must have already decided on your terms.  Speak plainly.”</p><p>Qin Sang also intended to resolve their grievances.</p><p>However, while he possessed treasures comparable to the Azure Luan Stone Slab, they were all crucial to his cultivation and he couldn't simply hand them over.</p><p>This was quite a predicament.</p><p>Compensation in spirit stones would be ideal, but that was clearly impossible.</p><p>“If you can produce a妖族 ancient treasure of equivalent value, this king will swallow this bitter pill and let it go!”</p><p>The Qianji Demon King said coldly.</p><p>“How does Daoist Qianji intend to calculate the value of the Azure Luan Stone Slab?”</p><p>Qin Sang countered, “The slab is incredibly important to Azure Luan descendants, yet in your hands, it’s a useless item locked away in a treasure vault. Few other ancient treasures share this characteristic.”</p><p>The Qianji Demon King glared, about to speak, but the Snake King stopped him.</p><p>“Since Daoist Mingyue wishes to negotiate, let’s stop beating around the bush. Qianji mentioned that Daoist Mingyue subdued a four-stage spirit insect in his presence.  To be frank, we’ve lived for many years and only ever read about such creatures in ancient texts. This is the first time we’ve encountered a spirit insect that has reached the tribulation transcendence stage…”</p><p>Upon hearing this, Qin Sang's expression changed, and he sneered.</p><p>“So that’s your plan!  Trading the stone slab for a rare four-stage spirit insect. What a bargain!”</p><p>The Snake King remained impassive.</p><p>The Qianji Demon King roared, “Do you think you're the only one who can use this treasure? While the Feather King possesses the Yun Ying bloodline, the Feather King Palace has a long history and countless secret techniques.  They may well have a way to unlock the secrets of the slab. If the Azure Luan Stone Slab were given to the Feather King, the reward I'd receive would be no less than any other treasure! That insect was dwelling near my cave; it rightfully belongs to me!”</p><p>Qin Sang chuckled, “By your logic, if I were to establish a cave in the Ziwei Palace, would all the treasures inside belong to me? You didn't see clearly that day. I used illusionary techniques to block your vision. That spirit insect was raised by me, carefully nurtured for hundreds of years, costing me countless efforts. It just so happened that it emerged from its cocoon and triggered a tribulation near your cave.”</p><p>The two Demon Kings exchanged glances, looking doubtful.</p><p>The Snake King said, “I said, wild spirit insects, unless they are in uninhabited wilderness areas, have an extremely low chance of surviving to the fourth stage. It turns out it already had an owner. Daoist friend, you possess extraordinary methods, to nurture a spirit insect to such a level. Daoist Zhu made the right choice in selecting you as his successor! It's understandable that you don't want to hand over the insect. But putting ourselves in your shoes, Qianji is also unwilling to give a treasure related to an ancient great demon to someone else.”</p><p>After a pause, the Snake King said gravely, “The cultivation world is ruled by strength. Therefore, in my opinion, you two should settle this with your abilities! You duel, and whoever loses accepts the outcome. If Daoist Mingyue wins, the theft will be forgotten. If Qianji wins, you hand over the insect.  It ends there; no hard feelings. I won't interfere; I'll just witness. If you don't trust me, the Wan Yao City is but a moment away; feel free to ask the Feather King for assistance…”</p><p>“A duel?”</p><p>Qin Sang looked at the Qianji Demon King and pondered.</p><p>So, this was their true intention.</p><p>A battle of strength to resolve the conflict—this was not uncommon in the cultivation world.</p><p>The Snake King stated that he would not interfere.</p><p>A duel against the Qianji Demon King – Qin Sang was confident in his treasures and abilities.</p><p>After forming his Golden Core, he had been looking for someone to spar with, to gauge his current strength and see how it compared to his own estimation, but he hadn't found a suitable opponent.</p><p>In the Seven Kills Hall, he had witnessed several Yuan Ying cultivators and ancient demons battling, but it was only observation; without direct experience, one could not know the dangers involved.</p><p>However, Qin Sang understood that the Snake King and the Qianji Demon King dared to propose a duel because they were fully prepared, and he couldn't be careless.</p><p>After considering, Qin Sang refused again, “A duel is acceptable, but the condition must change.  The insect is exceptionally important to me and closely linked to my cultivation; it absolutely cannot be given away.”</p><p>The Heavenly Eye Butterfly was his soul-bound insect; its potential was immense, and nothing could risk it.</p><p>The Qianji Demon King flew into a rage, “It’s always ‘no’! You clearly don’t want to solve the problem!”</p><p>The Snake King's face also darkened, “That attitude does not suggest a wish to resolve this. A spirit insect being linked to cultivation is unheard of! Let's assume your excuse; let's take a step back. If Qianji wins, you’ll temporarily lend us the insect, and when you leave the Ziwei Palace, it'll be returned.”</p><p>The Demon King Qianji and the Snake King relentlessly pursued the Sky Eye Butterfly, posing a considerable challenge to Qin Sang.</p><p>Their persistence suggested they aimed to utilize the Four-Change Spiritual Insect for something within the Ziwei Palace.</p><p>Qin Sang's mind raced.  This gave her leverage should things go awry.</p><p>Finally, Qin Sang reluctantly agreed.</p><p>"Lending the insect means I bear the risk of its injury or even death.  Don't mention compensation; nothing is more valuable to me than it…"</p><p>The Snake King saw through Qin Sang's intentions immediately. "You want to add conditions, don't you?"</p><p>Qin Sang didn't find haggling embarrassing.  "What is the Snake King's relationship with the Yuling Sect? I'd like to examine their treasured texts."</p><p>She couldn't gauge the Sect's relationship with the demon race, but the Snake King surely knew.</p><p>"The Yuling Sect's founder was indeed supported by our race, but they are different beings.  Over time, their attitude has become ambiguous; we'd likely need the Feather King's decree. However, if you only wish to consult texts relating to the insect, that shouldn't be difficult."</p><p>The Snake King readily agreed.</p><p>Qin Sang felt ashamed, reflecting on her perhaps immature mindset as a newly-formed Nascent Soul cultivator.  Now at the pinnacle of the cultivation world, opportunities abounded, and minor gains didn't matter.</p><p>"Good. I'll spar with Daoist Qianji.  Snake King, please set the rules."</p><p>Qin Sang gestured for Fat Chicken and White Crane to retreat.</p><p>The Snake King similarly signaled his troops to stand down.</p><p>"You can't use Lightning Escape!"</p><p>The Demon King Qianji immediately made a demand.</p><p>He still vividly remembered Qin Sang's escape technique and lacked a way to counter it.</p><p>Qin Sang sneered, "How about I bind my own hands and feet?"</p><p>The Snake King mediated, "Qianji has repeatedly mentioned Daoist Mingyue's superb escape technique, privately expressing great admiration.  If you continuously use it to evade, you'd be undefeated, making a fight pointless.  But it's your skill; forbidding it is unreasonable. How about we limit the battle area…"</p>
