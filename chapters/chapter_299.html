<h1>Chapter 292: The Pathfinders</h1><p>As they flew over the abyss, Qin Sang took one last look at the battlefield.</p><p>When he crushed the communication amulet, he had relayed everything he knew to Yun Youzi and Ge Yuan, emphasizing Yu Kong's intention to ambush Luo Xingnan and Sheng Yuanzi with a trap.</p><p>Considering the time elapsed between their hiding and the arrival of Luo Xingnan's group, Yun Youzi and Ge Yuan had ample opportunity to escape.</p><p>Yet, they chose to follow the group into the abyss.</p><p>This puzzled Qin Sang, leading him to speculate whether they possessed some life-saving measures, granting them the confidence to escape any danger.</p><p>―――――</p><p>Now, it seemed the situation was dire.</p><p>Numerous Hook Serpents lay slain by the cultivators, their corpses scattered, some plunging into the abyss, others crashing onto the ground. Their massive bodies littered the area, staining the ground crimson, the blood converging into rivers that cascaded into the abyss like bloody waterfalls.</p><p>However, the three Spirit Severing middle stage Hook Serpent Kings were nowhere to be seen.</p><p>During the fierce battle, glimpses of their enormous bodies being flung out were occasionally caught.</p><p>Despite their wounds, their auras remained undiminished. With ferocious roars, they would immediately charge back into the fray, seemingly oblivious to pain in their frenzy.</p><p>The intensity of the battle within the red mist began to wane. The three strongest Hook Serpent Kings were simply too resilient to be killed.</p><p>Moreover, not a single person had managed to escape.</p><p>Yu Kong had initially planned to ambush Luo Xingnan's group during their retreat. However, the unexpected strength of the Hook Serpents rendered their intervention unnecessary.</p><p>Finally, the battle subsided, and the red mist dispersed.</p><p>The surviving Hook Serpents hovered in the air, their mouths smeared with blood and flesh. The madness in their giant eyes hadn't completely faded, and their sharp roars echoed.</p><p>The three most powerful Hook Serpent Kings were also heavily wounded, a testament to the cultivators' fierce final stand. One even had both tails severed, bleeding profusely and wailing in agony.</p><p>They seemed to be communicating.</p><p>Then, one Hook Serpent King dragged its severely injured companion back into the abyss to slumber.  Others descended to devour the corpses of their brethren, while some returned to their nests.</p><p>The Hook Serpents' nests were located in the rear mountains.  Given their immense size, the fact that no demonic aura leaked from their nests indicated their considerable depth, likely rivaling the abyss itself.</p><p>Two Foundation Establishment middle stage masters, along with their entourage, had perished in the ambush, not a single survivor.</p><p>Apart from Yu Kong and his four companions, no one knew of their silent demise.</p><p>With a simple ploy, two formidable rivals were effortlessly eliminated.</p><p>Even Yu Kong hadn't anticipated such an outcome.</p><p>Hidden behind a stone hill, they had witnessed the entire battle unfold, from beginning to its tragic end, leaving them deeply shaken.</p><p>Silence hung heavy in the air.</p><p>"Senior Yu..."</p><p>Wu Chen swallowed, addressing Yu Kong with a newfound respect. The previous scene had left him in awe.</p><p>Yu Kong's effortless annihilation of so many Foundation Establishment cultivators, coupled with his cunning and ruthlessness, instilled a deep reverence in Wu Chen.</p><p>"You knew about these Hook Serpents all along..."</p><p>"I was indeed aware of lurking evil spirits, formidable ones at that, but I hadn't expected such strength from these beasts. I had only intended to spare the lives of those two old geezers, but those villains dragged so many innocents down with them. After we leave, I will surely arrange a grand memorial service for these fellow Daoists, to appease their souls..."</p><p>Yu Kong sighed with feigned sorrow, a triumphant smile playing on his lips.</p><p>"However, with our enemies eliminated, the spirit herbs are now ours for the taking. And they've conveniently weakened the guardian beasts for us, making our escape after collecting the herbs a simple matter.  We should be rejoicing, shouldn't we?"</p><p>Yu Kong's gaze swept over the group.  Everyone, including Qin Sang, nodded in agreement.</p><p>"Time is of the essence. There are still restrictions to break. We must leave before the weakening period of the protective formation ends. I have no desire to be trapped in this place for thirty years..."</p><p>Urged by Yu Kong, the group activated their escape techniques and headed towards the distant mountains.</p><p>Qin Sang cast a final glance at the ravaged battlefield, pondered for a moment, then turned and left.</p><p>They proceeded cautiously. The appearance of the Hook Serpents served as a warning. This place was not as peaceful as it seemed.  The plains were dotted with low hills, each potentially harboring guardian beasts.</p><p>Fortunately, their journey to the mountain remained undisturbed.</p><p>As they drew closer, their breathing quickened involuntarily.</p><p>Multicolored rays of light pierced the dense fog, reaching towards the sky, dazzling the eyes. Qin Sang silently counted them – twenty-one in total!</p><p>This meant there were twenty-one spirit herbs on the mountain, each at least a thousand years old!</p><p>Luo Xingnan had boasted about focusing on his Core Formation preparations after returning.  With these twenty-one spirit herbs, he might actually achieve his goal.</p><p>Qin Sang raised his head slightly, his gaze fixed on a spot near the summit, where a distinct profound yellow aura stood out.</p><p>Twenty-one spirit herbs should be sufficient for them to share, with more than four for each person, provided Yu Kong wasn't greedy and wouldn't turn hostile.</p><p>However, the auras of the spirit herbs varied. Most were faint and small, while only a few shone brightly.</p><p>Among them, the profound yellow aura ranked among the top three, indicating its exceptional value.</p><p>Yu Kong might be unwilling to part with it.</p><p>"It seems those Hook Serpents were indeed the guardian beasts left behind by the cave's master," Yu Kong nodded slightly, his voice filled with excitement as he looked at the numerous spirit herbs. "Once we break the restriction, these spirit herbs will be ours.  The final obstacle requires our combined efforts!"</p><p>Hearing this, the others tore their greedy gazes away from the herbs and turned towards the dense fog.</p><p>The restriction lay hidden within the fog. Even before entering, they could sense the faint presence of danger within.</p><p>This restriction was not easily broken.</p><p>They circled the mountain, probing the fog several times, and discovered that the entire mountain was sealed by the fog and the restriction, with no apparent path leading upwards. They had to abandon any hopes of an easy ascent.</p><p>"We simply don't have the time to slowly decipher how to break this restriction. Fortunately, I possess some knowledge in the art of restrictions, however..."</p><p>Yu Kong paused, his gaze sweeping over Qin Sang and the other two. "This restriction is vast and powerful.  Someone needs to enter the restriction and trigger its power, allowing us to see its true form. I must concentrate on finding a way to break it, so I'll have to rely on you fellow Daoists to take turns probing the restriction. What are your thoughts? Do you have any other suggestions?"</p>
