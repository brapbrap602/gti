<h1></h1><p>Qin Sang's protective True Essence surged, yet the venomous needles pierced through instantly, unable to offer the slightest resistance.</p><p>Insidious and specialized in breaking through protective True Essence, the venomous needles were a formidable threat.</p><p>At this critical juncture,</p><p>a rosy glow erupted from Qin Sang's dantian, revealing glimpses of pearly shadows within.</p><p>The Venom Pearl gifted by Fei Can had been refined within Qin Sang's body, allowing him to unleash its poison-repelling divine ability at will.</p><p>Perhaps calling it a Poison-Repelling Shield was a more fitting description of the rosy glow's current form.</p><p>The seven-colored glow condensed between Qin Sang and the venomous needles, forming a small, radiant shield, no bigger than a baby's palm.  It appeared precisely in front of the oncoming needles.</p><p>‘Thud!’</p><p>Facing the sharp venomous needles, the seven-colored glow appeared exceptionally fragile and, unsurprisingly, was pierced.</p><p>However, after penetrating the glow, the needles encountered resistance, their unstoppable momentum faltering. Although they ultimately pierced through, a noticeable pause occurred mid-flight.</p><p>Even this briefest of pauses was enough for Qin Sang to react. With a powerful flap of his Phoenix Wings, a lightning-fast streak of遁光 (escape light) left a zigzag trail in the air.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>The venomous needles grazed past the escape light, shooting towards the sky and vanishing without a trace.</p><p>The grotesque man's sinister grin froze on his bark-like face.</p><p>Qin Sang reappeared nearby, completely unharmed. With a thought, the Venom Pearl flew out of his dantian, retracting the rosy glow. Looking at the Venom Pearl, still somewhat ethereal and not fully solidified, he was slightly surprised.</p><p>He knew that the Venom Pearl, extracted from Fei Can's body, was undoubtedly weaker than Fei Can itself.  And Fei Can, only at the early stage of the Fourth Transformation, was clearly inferior to the Jade-Armored Beetle.</p><p>The venomous needles were more than just the Jade-Armored Beetle's divine ability.</p><p>The grotesque man, willing to endure backlash, had stimulated the Jade-Armored Beetle's potential, unleashing its venomous power through meticulous planning, culminating in this single strike of the Heaven-Severing Soul-Shaking Needle.</p><p>Such a deadly attack had been neutralized by the Venom Pearl!</p><p>Despite possessing the Venom Pearl, Qin Sang wouldn't stake his life on a single treasure without a clear understanding of the enemy's and his own strength.</p><p>Facing the Heaven-Severing Soul-Shaking Needle, he had at least three countermeasures.</p><p>The Venom Pearl was only the first.</p><p>If the Venom Pearl failed, he had the Heaven's Eye Butterfly. The Heaven's Eye Divine Light was already charged and ready. The venomous needles, in essence, were a divine ability unleashed by the grotesque man borrowing the power of the blood-armored beetle.</p><p>As a last resort, he had the item gifted by the Myriad Venom Mountain.</p><p>The grotesque man was now significantly weakened and suffering from backlash. Activating the fine hairs to assault his mind and disrupt the venomous needles would create an opportunity for escape.</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't used this item yet, firstly for his own safety, in case the grotesque man had a devastating trump card and became desperate. Secondly, the situation was still under control. He would wait for the right moment to strike while the iron was hot.</p><p>After all, his goal was to eliminate the grotesque man permanently, not merely repel him.</p><p>The Venom Pearl's performance exceeded expectations.</p><p>The two backup plans weren't needed.</p><p>Qin Sang realized he had underestimated Fei Can. The creature hadn't disgraced the Divine Silkworm bloodline.  If Fei Can itself had come along, it might have been able to clash with the Jade-Armored Beetle. Even if defeated, it wouldn't have been a devastating loss.</p><p>Joy and sorrow rarely coexist.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang and the grotesque man's moods were polar opposites.</p><p>The meticulously planned death trap, foiled by a mere seven-colored glow, was unacceptable to the grotesque man. He knew all too well what the neutralization of the Heaven-Severing Soul-Shaking Needle signified.</p><p>Adding insult to injury, the blood-armored beetle began to disobey, ignoring the grotesque man's urging.  The sharp, rapid buzzing of its wings betrayed its agitation as it abruptly turned and lunged towards the grotesque man.</p><p>‘Thud!’</p><p>The blood-armored beetle burrowed into the blood hole on the grotesque man's forehead.</p><p>The grotesque man's expression became even more contorted and terrifying. All fighting spirit vanished as he let out a furious howl towards the heavens.</p><p>The ancient trees yet to be consumed by fire suddenly turned withered and yellow, their leaves rustling down as the grotesque man frantically absorbed their Wood Spirit energy.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The grotesque man stomped the ground with both feet and charged towards the ring of fire like a wild bull.</p><p>After this prolonged battle, vast swathes of the forest had been burned by the demonic flames, drastically reducing his maneuvering space.</p><p>Qin Sang knew it was time to close the net and naturally did everything he could to prevent the man's escape.  His main body made slight adjustments, his palm pressing outwards as three Solar Divine Birds flew out from the Divine Tree, pursuing the grotesque man.</p><p>His avatar, no longer holding back, unleashed the spiritual treasure once more, awakening the Flood Serpent, regardless of the True Essence expenditure.</p><p>The ravaged forest became a scene of utter devastation.</p><p>Ash filled the air, alongside withered old trees, broken branches, scorched black and red earth, collapsed ancient halls and huts, and deep craters carved out by the residual force of their battle…</p><p>All beauty was gone.</p><p>The jet-black demonic flames constricted inwards.</p><p>Within the ring of fire, the Solar Divine Birds and the Flood Serpent circled above, forming an inescapable net, trapping the tree-man within.</p><p>The main body focused on precisely controlling the fire birds, waiting for the right moment.</p><p>The avatar, meanwhile, spared no effort, relentlessly attacking with the spiritual treasure, disregarding the True Essence flowing out of him like water.</p><p>The grotesque man, exhausted from his desperate flight, was repeatedly forced back by the combined efforts of Qin Sang and his avatar. He roared incessantly, but his voice was filled with helplessness. The incessant chatter of the Wailing Cave Master further aggravated him.</p><p>“Shut up!”</p><p>The grotesque man roared furiously, crushing the evil spirit in his hand.</p><p>The Wailing Cave Master let out a shriek and fell silent.</p><p>With a fierce glare, the fleeing grotesque man raised his head and shouted at Qin Sang, “We have no quarrel. I'll offer you a Nascent Soul opportunity. Let me live, and we'll call it even! I swear on my heart demon, from this day forward, I'll bear no grudge. Whenever I encounter you, I'll retreat three miles!”</p><p>“You know where to find a Nascent Soul opportunity?”</p><p>Qin Sang’s tone was playful as he appeared beside the Solar Divine Tree, looking down at the grotesque man.</p><p>At the mention of 'Nascent Soul,' even with his unwavering killing intent, Qin Sang couldn't help but respond. This man clearly possessed the legacy of the Formless Immortal Sect and might actually know something.</p><p>Of course, Qin Sang had no intention of stopping his attack, his strikes remaining ruthless.</p><p>The grotesque man hurriedly exclaimed, "The opportunity lies in Emperor Bestowal Mountain! Zhu Wudao and Purple Thunder Old Dao are watching like tigers.  No matter how strong you are, you can't fight them all.  Let's turn hostility into friendship, and I'll help you seize the Nascent Soul opportunity!"</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>A divine bird swooped down.</p><p>The grotesque man was about to use his old trick, but the Flood Serpent seized the opportunity and attacked, spewing a mouthful of icy flames onto him. The coordination between Qin Sang's avatar and main body was, naturally, impeccable.</p><p>The grotesque man felt a bone-chilling coldness, his body stiffening.  Startled, he hastily used a secret technique to escape.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The withered wood was blasted to smithereens by the Southern Bright Flame.</p><p>The grotesque man escaped to another location, his left arm severed at the elbow, the charred smell emanating from the wound mixing with his distorted, pained scream as he finished his sentence.</p><p>Enduring the excruciating pain, the grotesque man looked up and saw Qin Sang relentlessly summoning the three Solar Divine Birds again, his eyelids twitching.</p><p>Qin Sang pressed his attack while questioning, “If Emperor Bestowal Mountain held a Nascent Soul opportunity, why didn’t Zhu Wudao and the Eight Scenery View go there first instead of the cliff?”</p><p>“Because the teleportation formation led to the Immortal Palace, which held even greater opportunities, easier to obtain! The Sword Tomb alone could sustain the endless stream of Nascent Soul cultivators from both the Dao and Buddhist sects!”</p><p>The grotesque man clearly knew many secrets.</p><p>Hearing this, Qin Sang understood why the Dao and Buddhist sects had sealed off the Immortal Palace and eradicated the Formless Immortal Sect. Such a secret realm couldn't be shared.  By controlling it, their sects could ensure their continued prosperity.</p><p>He wondered what the Sword Tomb was.</p><p>The name sounded like a place where swords were buried.  Could the Earth-Slaying Sword fragments have been found there?</p><p>"Why did the teleportation formation fail?" Qin Sang asked, knowing the answer.</p><p>"Something changed in the Immortal Palace!"</p><p>The grotesque man, unsure of the specifics, spoke vaguely, "The path is broken! Only Emperor Bestowal Mountain remains! Zhu Wudao was intercepted by the Dao Sect and used the secret of Emperor Bestowal Mountain to exchange for the Wailing Cave Master and Mo Xingdao’s help to escape…"</p><p>"Zhu Wudao… that formation master escaped?"</p><p>Qin Sang muttered to himself. If he hadn’t been preoccupied with the cultivation technique and had retreated a bit slower from the palace on the cliff, Zhu Wudao would likely have tried to recruit him as well.</p><p>The Water Phase Hall concealing a Tribulation Transcendence Formation meant that a Nascent Soul opportunity in Emperor Bestowal Mountain wasn't too surprising.</p><p>His thoughts raced, and he suddenly barked, "So, you just learned this secret from Zhu Wudao and didn’t know it before.  If that's the case, what could the Formless Immortal Sect possibly have that's more important than the Sword Tomb, worth giving up the chance to be among the first to enter the Immortal Palace?"</p><p>The grotesque man's expression faltered.</p><p>Qin Sang sneered, “Letting you help me seize the opportunity is like making a deal with a tiger! The descendant of the Formless Immortal Sect contending with the Dao Sect is like two tigers fighting, benefiting the fisherman. Besides, with my cultivation, I'd be a valuable asset to either side, so why bother with such a charade!”</p><p>The avatar chimed in, "Not having you is more important to us!"</p><p>Before the words faded, Qin Sang intensified his attack.</p><p>The ring of fire contracted drastically, the grotesque man now a trapped beast in a cage of flames.</p><p>The grotesque man's eyes flickered, "You guessed right. There's a legacy in the Wood Phase Hall that interests me more, and I already have it. It's a Nascent Soul secret technique, a hidden secret of the Formless Immortal Sect!"</p><p>"Such profound fortune, fellow Daoist! Nascent Soul opportunities abound for you!"</p><p>Qin Sang scoffed, his face full of disbelief.</p><p>The Wood Phase Hall was equal in status to the Water Phase Hall.  Perhaps it once held treasures comparable to the Tribulation Transcendence Formation, but could they be obtained so easily?</p><p>The grotesque man trying to persuade him with empty words was nothing but a fool's dream.</p><p>"Do you know the key to Nascent Soul?"</p><p>The grotesque man's tone suddenly calmed.</p><p>"Still trying to play tricks!" Qin Sang roared, his attacks merciless.</p><p>Forced back step by step, the grotesque man had to suppress his rage and quickly said, “Nascent Soul surpasses Core Formation in its ability to initially mobilize Heavenly and Earthly energy, commanding wind and rain like a deity, overwhelming others with heavenly might. Therefore, the difficulty of Nascent Soul lies in Celestial Resonance!”</p><p>“Celestial Resonance?”</p><p>Qin Sang paused.</p><p>The term Celestial Resonance had broad implications.</p><p>Nascent Soul cultivators shouldn't be able to sense the Heavenly Dao yet.</p><p>The grotesque man was likely referring to its most superficial level.</p><p>Like a bolt of lightning, this statement flashed through Qin Sang’s mind, and he seemed to grasp something.</p><p>"You don't know? No wonder I couldn't trace your origins.  You're a rogue cultivator!"</p><p>The grotesque man noticed Qin Sang’s reaction and couldn't resist a jab, but quickly added, fearing he might enrage Qin Sang, "Heavenly and Earthly energy is divided into the Five Elements, and the key lies within these Five Elements!"</p><p>"Spiritual roots!"</p><p>Qin Sang was both shocked and astonished.</p><p>Five Element Spiritual Roots facilitated Celestial Resonance, sensing the Five Element energies between Heaven and Earth.  The universally acknowledged waste, actually turning the tables at Nascent Soul, transforming into a genius!</p><p>No!</p><p>Qin Sang reflected on his own arduous cultivation journey, every step marked by blood and tears.</p><p>Possessing all Five Element Spiritual Roots meant his True Essence was mixed, making cultivation and breakthroughs significantly more difficult than those with Heavenly Spiritual Roots. Five Element Spiritual Root cultivators didn't even dare dream of Core Formation.</p><p>If not for his numerous fortuitous encounters and relying on the Jade Buddha to traverse unorthodox paths, his hope of forming a Nascent Soul would have been incredibly slim.</p><p>How could there be such a drastic change at the Nascent Soul stage?</p><p>“Anyone who has cultivated to our level is a genius, and even Three Element Spiritual Roots are rare.  A pseudo-spiritual root waste, even with immense fortune, would struggle immensely at the Nascent Soul threshold. I can gift you a secret technique to compensate for flawed spiritual roots!"</p><p>The grotesque man was convinced Qin Sang couldn’t be a pseudo-spiritual root cultivator.</p><p>The value of this secret technique was immense. If it were spread, sects throughout the cultivation world would flock to it.  He didn't believe Qin Sang could resist.</p><p>“Spiritual roots can be mended!"</p><p>Qin Sang was surprised.</p><p>"Not exactly. It's about using external objects to replace the function of spiritual roots, achieving the same effect of sensing Heavenly and Earthly energy," the grotesque man, left with only negotiation, revealed everything, "The replacement is the natal magic treasure, which every cultivator possesses. This technique is also a refining technique, used to create a unique treasure called the Heavenly Exquisite Jade.  By integrating it into your natal magic treasure and nurturing it over time, it aids in Celestial Resonance. Back then, only two Hall Masters of the Wood Phase Hall were qualified to learn this technique, and the Heavenly Exquisite Jade was only traded among the true disciples of the Formless Immortal Sect."</p><p>“I have a Fire Heavenly Spiritual Root. What spiritual root would a Heavenly Exquisite Jade replace? Would it encompass all five elements?”</p><p>Qin Sang immediately spotted the flaw in the grotesque man's words.</p><p>Su Zinan had nicknamed him the Fire Demon.</p><p>Qin Sang claiming to be a Fire Heavenly Spiritual Root cultivator shouldn't arouse suspicion.</p><p>To convince Qin Sang, the grotesque man had to explain in detail while dodging attacks, "The Heavenly Exquisite Jade can freely transform among the Five Elements, allowing cultivators of any element to refine it. That's the meaning of 'exquisite.' However, after integrating it into a natal magic treasure, it can only be fixed as one of the Five Elements, and each person can only integrate one."</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang frown,</p><p>The grotesque man hurriedly added, "Fellow Daoist, with your Heavenly Spiritual Root, one Heavenly Exquisite Jade is enough to greatly increase your chances of reaching Nascent Soul!"</p><p>Unbeknownst to him, a genius remained a genius.</p><p>Celestial Resonance was the key, but it was only one aspect of Nascent Soul. One also needed to achieve personal transformation.</p><p>A Heavenly Spiritual Root didn't mean an inability to achieve Celestial Resonance, only that it was more difficult. Moreover, their pure True Essence made personal breakthroughs easier, forging a path from within.</p><p>Five Element Spiritual Root cultivators could more easily reach Celestial Resonance, but refining themselves was incredibly complex.</p><p>Solely considering the Nascent Soul stage, Five Element Spiritual Roots seemed advantageous. However, considering the entire cultivation journey, Heavenly Spiritual Root cultivators encountered the Nascent Soul bottleneck earlier and had more time to comprehend it. They didn't necessarily need all Five Elements. Supplementing a single element also offered immeasurable benefits.</p><p>The grotesque man didn't dare hold back, emphasizing the preciousness of the Heavenly Exquisite Jade.</p><p>He thought it would be enough to sway Qin Sang.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Qin Sang seemed indifferent to Nascent Soul, showing no signs of holding back, much to his resentment.</p><p>Rage surged within him.</p><p>The grotesque man roared towards the sky, "The Wood Phase legacy is broken, and I'm the only one who knows the refining method of the Heavenly Exquisite Jade! If you dare kill me, you'll never obtain it from anywhere else!"</p><p>With that, the grotesque man suddenly raised his right arm.</p><p>The evil spirit was imprisoned in his hand.</p><p>Soul energy churned, repeatedly flashing with the Wailing Cave Master's pained and terrified face.</p><p>"Don't…"</p><p>‘Thud!’</p><p>With a ferocious glint in his eyes, the grotesque man squeezed, obliterating the evil spirit!</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The Ice Instrument Palace trembled violently.</p><p>The palace crumbled layer by layer.</p><p>The ethereal blue light bulged high, on the verge of collapse. The flag formation finally gave way!</p>
