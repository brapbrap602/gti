<h1>Chapter 295: Luo Xingnan</h1><p>Yu Kong heard his account and immediately understood. The two of them had failed to coordinate. Wu Chen had tried to save Yan Wu and had nearly been killed himself.</p><p>Wu Chen’s injuries were more serious than Shangguan Lifeng’s, but he just needed to swallow a medicinal pill and he would soon recover. However, time was against them, they could not wait.</p><p>Yu Kong realized they had both entered the wrong directions. The real exit was in a different direction. He had no choice but to let Wu Chen and Yan Wu stay to heal, and let Qin Sang and Yan Wu carry on exploring.</p><p>“Taoist Qingfeng...”</p><p>Yan Wu bowed to Qin Sang, looking rather awkward.</p><p>Earlier, Yu Kong had given Yan Wu a severe warning. Yan Wu no longer dared to harbor any ulterior motives, otherwise, Yu Kong would not hesitate to teach him a lesson.</p><p>Yan Wu’s tone lacked any hint of resentment. Qin Sang had to wonder, was it an illusion that he felt Yan Wu stabbing him in the back?</p><p>Qin Sang squinted at Yan Wu, hesitated, then suggested that they explore in turns, he would go first followed by Yan Wu.</p><p>He would rather face the dangers of the sea of flames on his own than carry a ticking time bomb with him.</p><p>Yan Wu had no objections and quickly agreed.</p><p>After the previous incident, the risks of exploring were greatly reduced. However, Qin Sang still did not trust Yan Wu. He remained vigilant.</p><p>Qin Sang went up to the sea of flames and was about to enter.</p><p>At that moment, he suddenly felt an abnormal fluctuation in the sea of flames. He instinctively paused.</p><p>Before Qin Sang could figure out what this ripple meant, he suddenly heard an extremely angry roar from behind him, and a groan.</p><p>He recognized both voices.</p><p>The roar came from Yu Kong, and the voice that groaned was Shangguan Lifeng!</p><p>What happened?</p><p>Qin Sang was shocked. He suddenly turned around.</p><p>He saw Shangguan Lifeng being struck in the chest by a palm attack from Yu Kong. There was a ghastly hollow in his chest. Shangguan Lifeng spat out blood and flew backwards.</p><p>His blood splattered into the sky and was instantly evaporated by the fierce fire.</p><p>This palm strike was a blow from a furious Yu Kong. Shangguan Lifeng failed to dodge. He took it head-on and his injuries were severe. If he had not turned his body sideways at the last moment, avoiding the vital organ, his heart, he might have died on the spot.</p><p>Shangguan Lifeng could barely stand now. His face was as pale as paper, and his breathing was weak. However, there was a smug smile on his lips.</p><p>For the price of his life, Shangguan Lifeng had wrapped a long yellow rope tightly around Yu Kong’s body.</p><p>This yellow rope was evidently a top-grade magic weapon. It not only bound Yu Kong’s body but also restrained the spiritual energy in his body.</p><p>At this point, five figures suddenly appeared around Yu Kong. They surrounded Yu Kong and Wu Chen, who was completely shocked and bewildered.</p><p>Qin Sang had seen these people before.</p><p>The man facing Yu Kong turned out to be Luo Xingnan!</p><p>Beside Luo Xingnan were four other people. The old man Gong, who was working as a spy beside Sheng Yuanzi, a white-clothed scholar, a middle-aged man with an eagle-nosed nose, and Yunyouzi!</p><p>“Luo Xingnan, you are not dead!”</p><p>Yu Kong was even more shocked than Qin Sang.</p><p>Yu Kong was puzzled as to why Luo Xingnan had not been killed by the Sky-Reaching Serpent. After all, his plan was flawless. How could it have failed? But that did not matter now.</p><p>At this moment, Yu Kong realized his situation and immediately made the right decision.</p><p>Run!</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The yellow rope was broken.</p><p>Yu Kong’s face was flushed. He recklessly squeezed his dantian to condense spiritual energy, and finally self-destructed the magic weapon, breaking free from the yellow rope.</p><p>Although he had forcibly freed himself, he had also injured himself.</p><p>Yu Kong did not have time to worry about this. He suppressed his injuries brutally and sped up. He charged towards the white-clothed scholar, the weakest of the five.</p><p>However, Luo Xingnan and the others had planned this and would not let him escape.</p><p>The five of them formed a formation. The white-clothed scholar seemed to be a breakthrough, but in fact, it was a trap, a giant net waiting for its prey.</p><p>Before he reached the white-clothed scholar, an ancient seal appeared silently, carrying an immense force, and descended from the sky.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The ancient seal slammed into Yu Kong, injuring him further. He suddenly spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>"Old Dog Yu, you're not dead yet, so how can I bear to die?"</p><p>Luo Xingnan laughed out loud and pointed a finger. Two sword beams, one blue and one red, flew out from his palm. The spirit swords complemented each other, their sword qi crisscrossing as they attacked like a storm, denying Yu any chance to catch his breath and not even giving him time to beg for mercy.</p><p>However, Luo Xingnan still let Yu die a well-informed ghost.</p><p>"I never thought Shao Chunhui would have such a promising disciple."</p><p>Yu's eyes went round and he understood everything.</p><p>Luo Xingnan's concubine, Crescent Moon Immortal, was just a pawn, a decoy to distract his attention.</p><p>Perhaps Luo Xingnan had even leaked Crescent Moon Immortal's identity to him on purpose.</p><p>To someone like Luo Xingnan, what did a woman matter?</p><p>The true hidden blade was Shangguan Lifeng, Shao Chunhui's disciple whom Luo Xingnan had found from somewhere!</p><p>Yu's eyes glazed over as he recalled a phrase he had never believed in.</p><p>Cause and effect...</p><p>When they saw their main target had been completely suppressed by Luo Xingnan and had no chance of turning the tables, with his death sooner or later a foregone conclusion, the other four withdrew from the battle one after another.</p><p>The White-robed Scholar landed beside Wu Chen and pressed a palm on his shoulder. Wu Chen's wounds still hadn't healed and his eyes darted around nervously, not daring to move. The other three leaped towards Qin Sang and Yan Wu.</p><p>Qin Sang and the Cloud Wanderer exchanged glances mid-air before separating abruptly after a brief exchange. Then they charged into the sea of flames without hesitation.</p><p>Yan Wu was a beat slower, but he also fled hastily in the end.</p><p>These people hadn't fought Wu Chen to the death, and it seemed like they only wanted to kill Yu, but he wasn't like Wu Chen and didn't dare bet his life. Even if he were to be captured alive, he would be used as a scout and wouldn't have a good end.</p><p>Although the sea of flames was extremely dangerous, there was a glimmer of hope within it.</p><p>As long as Luo Xingnan and the others still had their eyes on the spirit herbs on the mountain, they wouldn't waste time here searching for them.</p><p>The Cloud Wanderer and his two companions followed closely behind.</p><p>"Split up and chase them!"</p><p>The Cloud Wanderer shouted and summoned his spirit bamboo flying shuttle, his speed skyrocketing instantly. He disappeared into the depths of the sea of flames as he chased after the direction Qin Sang had fled.</p><p>The other two looked at each other and shook their heads helplessly. Their speed couldn't compare to the Cloud Wanderer's, so they could only chase after Yan Wu together.</p><p>...</p><p>As soon as Qin Sang entered the sea of flames, he activated the Nine Dragons Celestial Chariot Talisman. The cracks on the talisman still hadn't completely healed, but it was enough to increase Qin Sang's speed to a level comparable to the mid Core Formation stage.</p><p>With the dragons swirling around him, Qin Sang easily shook off Yan Wu and flew out a certain distance before stopping.</p><p>Yu Kong inquired and learned that the two hadn't coordinated well. Wu Chen, in trying to save Yan Wu, nearly got himself killed.</p><p>Wu Chen's injuries were more severe than Shangguan Lifeng's, but with medicinal pills, they weren't difficult to heal. However, time wasn't on their side.</p><p>Yu Kong realized the two paths they'd taken were dead ends. The true exit lay among the remaining six directions. He had no choice but to leave Wu Chen and Shangguan Lifeng to recover while Qin Sang and Yan Wu continued exploring together.</p><p>“Daoist Qingfeng…”</p><p>Yan Wu cupped his hands towards Qin Sang, his expression somewhat unnatural.</p><p>He had just received another stern warning from Yu Kong, forbidding him from harboring any further ulterior motives, lest Yu Kong teach him a harsh lesson.</p><p>Yan Wu's tone seemed devoid of resentment, which made Qin Sang wonder if the prickling sensation he'd felt earlier had been his imagination.</p><p>Qin Sang eyed Yan Wu suspiciously, pondered for a moment, and proposed they take turns exploring, one after the other, as he had agreed with Shangguan Lifeng.</p><p>He'd rather face the dangers of the sea of fire alone than keep a ticking time bomb by his side.</p><p>Yan Wu readily agreed, raising no objections.</p><p>Their prior experience made exploring less perilous, yet Qin Sang's distrust of Yan Wu remained, and his vigilance didn't waver.</p><p>Qin Sang arrived at the edge of the sea of fire, ready to enter.</p><p>Just then, he sensed an unusual disturbance within the fiery space, instinctively halting his steps.</p><p>Before Qin Sang could grasp the meaning of this fluctuation, a furious roar and a muffled groan suddenly erupted from behind him.</p><p>Both sounds were very familiar.</p><p>The roar belonged to Yu Kong, while the groan came from Shangguan Lifeng!</p><p>What happened?</p><p>A wave of astonishment washed over Qin Sang as he abruptly turned around.</p><p>He caught sight of Yu Kong striking Shangguan Lifeng's chest with a palm strike. A horrifying dent appeared on Shangguan Lifeng's chest as he coughed up blood and stumbled backward.</p><p>The blood sprayed through the air, instantly incinerated by the intense flames.</p><p>Yu Kong's palm strike, fueled by rage, landed squarely on Shangguan Lifeng, who couldn't evade it. The severity of the injury was evident. If Shangguan Lifeng hadn't shifted his body at the last moment, sparing his heart, he likely would have died on the spot.</p><p>Shangguan Lifeng, now barely able to stand, his face ashen and his breath faint, nevertheless wore a triumphant smirk.</p><p>Follow the official account: Book Fan Base, follow and receive cash and points!</p><p>What Shangguan Lifeng had traded his life for was a long yellow rope tightly coiled around Yu Kong.</p><p>This yellow rope was clearly a high-grade magical artifact, binding not only Yu Kong's physical body but also stagnating his spiritual energy.</p><p>At this moment, five figures had materialized around Yu Kong, encircling him and the utterly shocked, bewildered, and clueless Wu Chen.</p><p>Qin Sang recognized these individuals.</p><p>Facing Yu Kong directly was Luo Xingnan!</p><p>Beside Luo Xingnan stood four others: the elderly Gong, who had been undercover with Sheng Yuanzi, a scholar in white robes, a middle-aged man with a hooked nose, and Yun Youzi!</p><p>“Luo Xingnan, you're alive!”</p><p>Yu Kong was even more astonished than Qin Sang.</p><p>Although Yu Kong couldn't fathom how Luo Xingnan had survived the Hook Serpent's attack, or where his flawless plan had gone awry, none of that mattered now.</p><p>In that instant, Yu Kong grasped his predicament and made the only sensible decision.</p><p>Escape!</p><p>‘Bang!’</p><p>The yellow rope snapped back.</p><p>Yu Kong's face flushed as he desperately channeled his spiritual energy, ultimately detonating the artifact to break free from the binding rope.</p><p>Though he'd forcefully escaped the restraint, he suffered internal injuries.</p><p>Yu Kong ignored the pain, suppressing his injuries and lunging towards the weakest of the five, the scholar in white.</p><p>However, Luo Xingnan and the others, having planned this, wouldn't allow his escape.</p><p>The five had formed a formation. The scholar, seemingly a weak point, was actually a trap, a net waiting for its prey.</p><p>Before Yu Kong reached the scholar, an illusory ancient seal appeared silently, descending from the sky with immense force.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The seal slammed into Yu Kong, his face paling further as he coughed up another mouthful of blood.</p><p>“Old dog Yu, you're still alive, how could I die before you?”</p><p>Luo Xingnan roared with laughter, extending a finger. Two beams of sword light, one blue and one red, shot from his palm. The spiritual swords intertwined, their energy swirling around Yu Kong like a tempest, giving him no respite, not even a moment to beg for mercy.</p><p>Still, Luo Xingnan allowed Yu Kong to die knowing the truth.</p><p>“Didn't expect Shao Chunhui to have such a capable disciple, did you?”</p><p>Yu Kong's eyes widened in realization.</p><p>Luo Xingnan's lover, Crescent Moon Immortal, had been a pawn, a decoy to divert his attention.</p><p>Perhaps Luo Xingnan had even deliberately leaked Crescent Moon Immortal's identity to him.</p><p>To someone like Luo Xingnan, what was a woman's life worth?</p><p>The true hidden agent was Shangguan Lifeng, a disciple of Shao Chunhui whom Luo Xingnan had somehow unearthed.</p><p>Yu Kong's gaze grew distant, recalling a concept he'd never truly believed in.</p><p>Karma…</p><p>Seeing their primary target, Yu Kong, completely suppressed by Luo Xingnan, with no chance of recovery and his death imminent, the other four disengaged from the fight.</p><p>The scholar gracefully landed beside Wu Chen, placing a hand on his shoulder. Wu Chen, still injured, dared not move, his eyes darting around. The remaining three lunged towards Qin Sang and Yan Wu.</p><p>Qin Sang and Yun Youzi's gazes met mid-air, exchanging a brief, silent message before swiftly parting ways. Without hesitation, Qin Sang turned and plunged back into the sea of fire.</p><p>Yan Wu reacted a moment later, also fleeing into the inferno.</p><p>They hadn't killed Wu Chen, seemingly intent only on Yu Kong, but Qin Sang wasn't like Wu Chen. He wouldn't gamble his life on their mercy. Even if captured alive, he'd be used as a pawn to explore, his fate no better.</p><p>While the sea of fire held numerous dangers, it also offered a sliver of hope.</p><p>As long as Luo Xingnan and the others still coveted the mountain's spiritual herbs, they wouldn't waste time searching for them.</p><p>Yun Youzi and the other two followed closely.</p><p>“Split up and pursue!”</p><p>Yun Youzi bellowed, summoning his Spirit Bamboo flying boat. His speed surged as he chased Qin Sang, vanishing into the depths of the sea of fire.</p><p>The other two exchanged glances, shaking their heads helplessly. Their speeds were no match for Yun Youzi's, so they joined forces to pursue Yan Wu.</p><p>…</p><p>Upon entering the sea of fire, Qin Sang activated the Nine Dragons Heavenly Chariot Talisman. Though the talisman's cracks hadn't fully mended, it was enough to boost Qin Sang's speed to a level comparable to a mid-Foundation Establishment cultivator.</p><p>With the dragon coiling around him, Qin Sang easily outpaced Yan Wu. After flying a certain distance, he came to a stop.</p>
