<h1>Chapter 2086: The Younger Brother</h1><p>Green Sheep Temple, Creek Peak.</p><p>After Qin Li broke through to the Foundation Establishment stage, he was allowed to have a cave dwelling here. The new temple grounds were vast; even with all the Green Sheep Temple disciples moving in, it didn't feel crowded.</p><p>He built a small hut on the banks of the river at the foot of Creek Peak, according to the little fox's preferences.  It was secluded, with an unobstructed view of the mountains and rivers in the distance; breathtaking scenery was visible upon waking.</p><p>One day, Qin Li was summoned by an attendant.  Upon returning to his hut, he felt a weight on his shoulder and heard a sweet voice.</p><p>"Hey! What did the attendant want?"</p><p>The little fox was naturally gifted in concealment, appearing and disappearing without a trace. Qin Li had been startled many times, but he was now used to it.</p><p>He sat down heavily on the bluestone in front of the door and said, "Attendant Tan wants to take me to the North Sea."</p><p>"The North Sea?  Are we going back to the ancestral temple? Great, great! I miss home; it's been so long since I left the Thousand Mountains Bamboo Sea!"</p><p>The little fox jumped to the ground and paced excitedly in front of Qin Li.</p><p>Qin Li chuckled, "Attendant Tan said we're going to Langdu Island. I don't think that's the ancestral temple?"</p><p>"Langdu Island?"</p><p>The little fox froze, then suddenly remembered something. Its fur stood on end, and it shrieked, "Langdu Island is a spirit island in the outer North Sea, a major military base. He's sending you to the battlefield!"</p><p>Green Sheep Temple, under the guise of expanding its grounds, recalled most of its disciples, but still bore the responsibility of defending the territory.  At intervals, a batch of disciples would be dispatched to the front lines.</p><p>"Battlefield?"</p><p>Qin Li was a bit dazed, seemingly not yet understanding what this meant for him.</p><p>"Did you agree?" The little fox clung to his knee, standing upright, its face full of anxiety.</p><p>Qin Li scratched the back of his head, "Attendant Tan just informed me; he didn't ask if I was willing."</p><p>"It's over, it's over, it's over…"</p><p>The little fox instantly slumped, dejected and pacing restlessly, its expression increasingly agitated.</p><p>Qin Li was only at the early stage of Foundation Establishment, and the little fox was only at the mid-stage of Spirit Transformation.  That was a battlefield where cultivators at the Divine Transformation stage frequently appeared.  If they went, they probably wouldn't even leave ashes behind.</p><p>It had chosen Qin Li, thinking it could benefit, but instead of receiving any benefit, it was about to be pushed into the abyss.</p><p>The little fox angrily said, "Couldn't you have refused?"</p><p>"Attendant Tan said it was a sect decision, and that Brother Chi and the others also agreed," Qin Li said.</p><p>"What are their surnames, and what's yours? You are a Qin! If you're unwilling, who dares make you go to your death!" The little fox was heartbroken.</p><p>Qin Li suddenly put away his goofy smile and said solemnly, "The ancestor said that precisely because we are of the Qin bloodline, with countless eyes in the sect watching us, we must always be the first to act, uphold the Qin family's reputation, and live up to the glorious name of our ancestors!"</p><p>The little fox glared at Qin Li with an exasperated look, but mostly with helplessness.  Having spent time together, it understood this fellow's temperament very well.  He wasn't stupid, but sometimes he was incredibly naive, and it would be impossible to dissuade him.</p><p>It was already tied to Qin Li and couldn't escape, so it could only rack its brains for a solution. "Did Attendant Tan say which general you'll be under?"</p><p>"The general Attendant Tan mentioned… his name sounds like…Fifth Grandfather," Qin Li said uncertainly.</p><p>"A Qin family master?"</p><p>The little fox's eyes rolled, and its worried expression vanished instantly.  It said disdainfully, "I understand. They're sending you to gain merit!  Typical of a noble family scion, hmph…"</p><p>The little fox gave Qin Li a contemptuous look and gracefully leaped into the bamboo basket hanging from the rafter.  A mountain breeze blew, gently swaying the basket. The little fox stretched comfortably and quickly fell fast asleep.</p><p>Several days later, Qin Li and a group of Green Sheep Temple disciples boarded a magic vessel, left Green Sheep Temple, crossed the North Sea, and were directly sent to Langdu Island.</p><p>Upon landing on Langdu Island, an order was issued, and the group was divided into several smaller groups. That night, someone led Qin Li's group away.</p><p>Standing on a plantain leaf-shaped magical artifact, learning that they were being sent to the front-line camp, Qin Li and the little fox were still somewhat dazed.  In the blink of an eye, they had gone from the safe haven of the sect to the dangerous battlefield, without even seeing the "Fifth Grandfather" Qin Li had mentioned.</p><p>They stood at the back of the crowd.  Ahead of them were hundreds of Green Sheep Temple disciples, of varying cultivation levels. The highest-ranking was a Nascent Soul stage master, chatting and laughing with the people who had come to escort them.</p><p>Resisting the Changyou tribe was the duty of every cultivator in the Storm World, and also the best opportunity for cultivation.</p><p>Qi Condensation disciples were too weak; Foundation Establishment cultivators were eligible to join the battlefield. Qin Li was the lowest-cultivation among this batch. The usually lively little fox now quietly huddled in Qin Li's arms.</p><p>A banana leaf carried them far away, until a lush, butterfly-shaped island appeared on the horizon, its shores shimmering with magical energy.  The leaf stopped above the island, and a figure emerged from behind, looking back.</p><p>This person, clearly battle-hardened, had a fierce gaze that filled Qin Li and his companions with apprehension.</p><p>“Chi Wei Yong, Qin Li… come out!”</p><p>He called out several names, all Foundation Establishment cultivators.  With a flick of his sleeve, Qin Li and the others were suddenly falling towards the ground, scrambling to summon their flying artifacts.</p><p>“Don’t panic! It’s good news!”</p><p>The little fox, the calmest of them all, sent a voice transmission. “This isn’t the front lines. As long as we guard this island, we’ll be safe!”</p><p>Qin Li fumbled, a flying dagger appearing beneath his feet as he wobbled towards the ground. A figure in shimmering light descended from the island, a martial-looking cultivator approaching them.</p><p>Seeing the insignia on his belt, they all felt a surge of respect.  They had done their homework; the insignia denoted rank and authority. This was the island's commander, their future superior.  And his aura clearly indicated he was a Golden Core cultivator.</p><p>After the initial chaos, the commander gathered everyone. Despite facing a group of Foundation Establishment cultivators, he was approachable and kind.</p><p>“I am You Feng, commander of Butterfly Island. You are all new here, so it may take some time to adjust…”</p><p>Reassured by the commander’s amiable demeanor, the group relaxed.  Though You Feng seemed friendly, the imposing aura of a Golden Core cultivator prevented anyone from being careless; they listened attentively to his explanation of their duties and regulations.</p><p>The day was spent settling in. They were assigned quarters on the left wing of Butterfly Island, each with their own private room, magically separated but close enough to facilitate cultivation. The opportunity to cultivate, even amidst the war, was fortunate. Their duties were straightforward: several patrols daily and general island defense. As long as they fulfilled their duties and didn’t stray too far from Butterfly Island, the commander would not interfere.</p><p>“Quick! Get them out!”</p><p>Back in their quarters, the little fox excitedly urged Qin Li.  That day, their rewards were plentiful. In addition to specialized surveillance and alert devices, the commander provided each of them with a full set of high-quality equipment: weapons, defensive tools, flying artifacts, concealment devices, and even specialized items for the little fox, perfectly suited for a spirit beast.  Such equipment would normally require significant merit to obtain from their sect, and Qin Li wouldn't have received such preferential treatment.</p><p>Various items lay scattered on the ground. The little fox excitedly rolled around, examining each piece.  “I told you, you were here to get some serious upgrades!”</p><p>After a night’s rest, the commander summoned a group, including Qin Li and the little fox, for a morning patrol.  Initially tense, Qin Li gripped his fists tightly, but after circling for a while without encountering any enemy, they relaxed.  The vast blue sea, with the occasional seabird, felt serene and beautiful.</p><p>Returning to Butterfly Island, Qin Li headed for his quarters, but the little fox stopped him.</p><p>“Let’s go out.”</p><p>Qin Li hesitated. “It’s too dangerous out there!”</p><p>“We’ve already been out; where's the danger? We’ll just explore the area near Butterfly Island, we won't go far…”</p><p>The little fox pressed, offering a convincing excuse. “If the enemy attacks, we need to know the terrain, so we know where to run!”</p><p>Though skeptical about the “running” part, Qin Li eventually relented, summoning his flying artifact. The commander didn’t object.</p><p>They circled Butterfly Island, then ventured further out, enjoying the scenery. The little fox sighed, “If only there were no enemies…”</p><p>“Yeah,” Qin Li agreed wistfully, “but without external enemies, there would be internal conflict.”</p><p>“Huh?”  The little fox tilted its head, surprised. “Where did you learn that?”</p><p>“I heard Elder Tan say it once,” Qin Li admitted.</p><p>“I knew it wasn't your own brilliant insight!”  The little fox scoffed, returning to enjoying the view.  Suddenly, it sensed something, let out a surprised yelp, and leaped from Qin Li’s shoulder, its paws a blur as it sped across the water, quickly becoming a white streak.</p><p>“Where are you going?”</p><p>Qin Li called out anxiously, but seeing the little fox fleeing relentlessly, his heart pounded with worry.  He pursued it closely, and finally, the little fox slowed down. Qin Li then noticed a magical battle unfolding on the sea ahead.</p><p>Waves churned, concentric ripples spreading outward.  From the center of the turmoil came roars, and flashes of gray light, sharp and menacing.</p><p>The little fox didn't conceal its aura.  Both combatants, sensing the uninvited guest, paused their fight slightly.  Their figures emerged from the waves: a human cultivator and a fish demon.</p><p>The fish demon, its mouth full of fangs, looked vicious, its body covered in blood. The cultivator was a young man in gray robes, a gray flying sword hovering before him.</p><p>Neither was particularly powerful; the fish demon was at the Mortal Demon stage, while the youth was a Qi Refinement cultivator.</p><p>“Hey! Where did you come from? This isn't a place for you. Leave now, uh…”</p><p>Seeing the fish demon's pitiful state, the little fox felt displeasure and tried to drive the young man away, but then noticed an official badge at the young man’s waist.</p><p>The fish demon sensed the powerful aura of a great demon from the little fox and, no longer daring to fight back, trembled on the surface of the water, whimpering to the little fox.</p><p>The young man retracted his sword and turned.</p><p>“You came from Butterfly Island?” the little fox asked, landing before the youth.</p><p>The young man nodded.</p><p>“Only Foundation Establishment cultivators are supposed to be here,” the little fox questioned.</p><p>“I’m a wandering cultivator,”</p><p>the young man replied calmly.</p><p>At that moment, Qin Li finally caught up, offering an apologetic smile to the youth and whispering to the little fox, “There are Qi Refinement cultivators on Butterfly Island too, handling menial tasks.”</p><p>The little fox understood, continued to observe the young man, and sighed, “Wandering cultivators have it rough!”</p><p>A Qi Refinement cultivator having to fight on the front lines, without a single decent magical artifact; his only flying sword looking dull and worn. Yet, this fellow seems to possess a strong spirit, remaining composed before them.</p><p>The little fox developed a slight fondness for the young man, softening its tone. “What are you killing this demon for? Our enemy is the Changyou Tribe; human and demon races must unite against them!”</p><p>The young man’s voice was unruffled. “I am practicing my swordsmanship.”</p><p>“Practicing swordsmanship?”</p><p>The little fox snorted. “You’ll have plenty of opportunities to practice against the Changyou Tribe! Stop fighting it, let it go; it has two children in its lair.”</p><p>The young man didn't need one or two more opponents, so he gently nodded and sheathed his sword.</p><p>Pleased by the young man’s compliance, the little fox gestured to the fish demon. “Go now, and stay away from the surface!”</p><p>The fish demon let out a whimper, splashing water as it dove beneath the waves.</p><p>As the young man turned to leave, he slightly frowned, then felt a weight on his shoulder—the little fox had unceremoniously hopped onto it.</p><p>“What's your name?”</p><p>“Jian Yi,” the young man replied.</p><p>“Jian Yi? What an odd name!”</p><p>The little fox patted his shoulder. “Don’t be afraid, we’re all colleagues. We won't harm you. Call me Fox Immortal, and you'll be our little brother. We'll protect you, so you'll be safe!”</p><p>Jian Yi looked at the little fox, then at Qin Li who had caught up, and after a moment, nodded.  “Okay!”</p><p>Qin Li was about to explain, surprised that Jian Yi actually agreed, waving his hands repeatedly. “Brother, don't take it seriously. We don't take little brothers. We'll be friends…”</p><p>But the little fox was persistent, grabbing Jian Yi’s collar. “Okay, what? You haven’t called me Fox Immortal yet!”</p><p>…</p><p>Sacred沐Plain, Sacred Lake.</p><p>One morning, the Changyou Tribe elders in secluded meditation, the Sacred Lake guards, and the servants of various households, almost simultaneously heard a voice full of authority.</p><p>“Everyone, leave Sacred Lake before sunset!”</p><p>The elders were startled awake, then shocked.  “It’s the Chieftain’s order!”</p><p>Including the Chieftain's residence, all the houses were thrown into chaos. Fortunately, Min Shu stepped in to calm everyone and organize the evacuation.</p><p>Then the Sacred Lake guards also withdrew from the lake's center.</p><p>The elders couldn’t find the Chieftain, so they approached Min Shu, anxiously asking, “Third Young Master, what happened?”</p><p>The order caused widespread panic; everyone thought something had happened to Sacred Lake.</p><p>Just then, the elders suddenly noticed that the center of Sacred Lake was radiating dazzling light, while the surroundings grew dark, as if the daylight had been absorbed by the lake in an instant.</p><p>Within the intense light, a figure appeared—the Chieftain, Min Zhuo.</p><p>“Father is going to use the Sacred Lake Grand Array!” Min Shu said, his voice filled with suppressed excitement.</p><p>“Use the Grand Array? Could it be…?”</p><p>The elders suddenly thought of a possibility, and were overjoyed.</p>
