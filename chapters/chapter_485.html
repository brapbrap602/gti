<h1>Chapter 478: Ambush</h1><p>Chapter 478: Ambush</p><p>Although he hadn't successfully created a living corpse, the gains were significant.  This experience gave Qin Sang a thorough understanding of the False Core realm, making him more confident in his next attempt at corpse refinement.</p><p>After the earth-sha spirit dissipated, Qin Sang carefully erased any lingering traces of his presence before leaving the plaza and stepping onto the stone path.  He hadn't expected so many events to unfold, and less than two quarters of an hour remained before he needed to leave the Finger-pointing Peak.</p><p>Time was short. Qin Sang retraced his steps, abandoning the idea of seeking out the Tianxing League cultivator, intending to leave this area riddled with restrictions as quickly as possible.  He would then return to the outer reaches of the canyon to collect more starstones.</p><p>The Snow Spirit Lotus and the Iris flower were paramount; he couldn't let them fall into the wrong hands.  The surrounding restrictions had been slightly altered by the spatial storm caused by the Star-grasping Elder, but the changes were minor and manageable.</p><p>After traveling some distance, Qin Sang found a fiery expanse created by a restriction. He tossed the deceased young man's belongings into it, watching as the flames consumed them.</p><p>Resuming his journey, Qin Sang finally had time to assess his condition. His fight with the young man had been relatively effortless, leaving him unscathed. However, due to his reliance on the Cold Gold Sword, several clashes with the young man's magical weapon had dulled the flying sword, diminishing its luster. The damage was minor and could be repaired with a day's refinement.</p><p>After a moment's thought, Qin Sang put away the Cold Gold Sword and took out the long-unused Ten Directions Yama Banner. These ghost banners had been gathering dust since the start of the battle in the Chaos Island waters.  Unfurled after several years, holding it, he felt a surge of eager excitement emanating from the banner's main spirit.</p><p>Qin Sang smiled, channeling his spiritual energy to unfurl the Ten Directions Yama Banner. His cultivation far surpassed his past self, making the weapon far easier to wield. It was more than enough to protect himself until he left Finger-pointing Peak.</p><p>Ten small ghost banners spun around Qin Sang, the surging Yin energy contained around him, forming a swirling mist.</p><p>Shortly after, Qin Sang reached the end of the stone path. He glanced back with a pensive expression, then continued, his pace quickening.</p><p>He passed safely through the dense restrictions.  Two massive black stones emerged, resembling crouching black tigers, imposing and majestic, like guardians at a gate.</p><p>Qin Sang clearly remembered these stones; their presence indicated that the danger had lessened and he could begin collecting starstones.</p><p>Looking up into the inky blackness above, dotted with a dozen or so points of light, Qin Sang realized most of the starstones had merged with the restrictions, leaving only a few harvestable.</p><p>I'll go a little further, he thought, accelerating towards the black stones.</p><p>As Qin Sang was about to pass between the two black tiger stones, a sudden wave of dread washed over him, followed by a violent gust of wind from above.</p><p>Qin Sang's face turned pale. He looked up sharply to see a massive stele plummeting from the top of the left black stone!</p><p>The stele, heavy as a thousand jun, descended with crushing force.  Square and imposing, it bore the three characters 'Earth-shaking Stele', exuding a heavy, ochre aura.  Despite its apparent bulk, its speed was astonishing.</p><p>In an instant, Qin Sang was enveloped in the ochre aura, his vision completely obscured by the stele.  Even before contact, the aura exerted a terrifying pressure, locking onto Qin Sang.</p><p>A tremendous force pinned him to the ground, his feet sinking into two deep craters. His eyes widened, his bones cracking, his body trembling violently, utterly immobile. He could barely maintain a standing posture, narrowly avoiding being crushed flat.</p><p>A talisman treasure! Qin Sang cried internally. Only such an item could possess this kind of power.</p><p>The stele's ochre aura obscured Qin Sang's view, hiding the assailant's face, but it was almost certainly the Tianxing League cultivator from earlier.</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't expected to be attacked first, especially given the seeming foreknowledge of his presence and the prepared ambush.  Had the Old Woman Jing’s concealment failed?</p><p>Doubt arose, but the situation demanded immediate action. Fortunately, Qin Sang’s usual caution had led him to prepare.  His Ten Directions Yama Banner was ready.</p><p>'Whoosh!'  The Earth-shaking Stele was inches away, its fine details clearly visible.</p><p>'Whoosh!' Yin energy surged.</p><p>The Yama Banner billowed in the wind, instantly expanding into a gigantic ghost banner nearly twice the height of a man.</p><p>Ten ghostly banners were planted in the ground, forming a flag array.</p><p>In an instant, the area between the black stones transformed into a ghostly realm, filled with an eerie atmosphere and mournful howls.</p><p>Then, Yin energy swirled in the center of the flag array, and black ghost flames shot into the sky.  These flames were exceptionally powerful, instantly dispersing the pervasive yellowish-brown color and coalescing into a single force, firmly resisting the Mountain-Shaking Stele.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The Mountain-Shaking Stele collided with the ghost flames.</p><p>The Ten Directions Yama Banners merely trembled slightly, remaining firmly planted.</p><p>The Mountain-Shaking Stele hung suspended in mid-air, unable to descend even an inch.</p><p>Qin Sang finally saw the attacker's face.</p><p>Atop the black stones, a man in yellowish-brown armor stood at the edge, looking down. He wore a helmet of the same color, revealing only his features.</p><p>The Mountain-Shaking Stele was obstructed.</p><p>The armored cultivator's eyes widened in astonishment. He clearly hadn't expected his carefully planned ambush, even resorting to a magic treasure, to be so easily thwarted.</p><p>"It's you!"</p><p>Qin Sang snorted coldly. He finally remembered who this person was.</p><p>This man was a master dispatched to this area by the Skywalking League a year ago.  In less than a year, he had achieved remarkable feats, with many experts from the Lesser Cold Region falling victim to him.</p><p>His armor wasn't mere decoration; it was a complete set of magical artifacts. Each piece seemed magically connected, enhancing its power far beyond other top-grade artifacts.</p><p>His name was unknown; Qin Sang and his companions referred to him only as the Yellow-Armored Man.</p><p>Qin Sang had never fought the Yellow-Armored Man, so he hadn't recognized him before, but he remembered him well—one of the few masters he feared most.</p><p>He would avoid encountering him if possible.</p><p>"So it's the renowned Shadowless Sword. No wonder you caused such a commotion and yet lived to tell the tale," the Yellow-Armored Man said, his tone laced with sarcasm when mentioning Qin Sang's title.</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly understood. The impact of the spatial storm was greater than he'd imagined, possibly disrupting the entire valley's restrictions and attracting the Yellow-Armored Man.</p><p>Whatever reward the Skywalking League promised must be comparable to, if not better than, Stargazing Island.</p><p>Collecting starstones one by one with the Spirit-Binding Bracelet was unproductive, especially in such a dangerous place as the valley.  It was far too restrictive.</p><p>Ambushing an opponent and seizing their starstones was the fastest method.  No wonder the Yellow-Armored Man was tempted.</p>
