Chapter 1907: Entering the Mortal World


Zhuque entered the cave dwelling, flew to the stone bed opposite Qin Sang, extended a small claw to touch the forehead of the Five Elements Crown's spirit, then landed on the spirit's arm, tilting its head as it looked at Qin Sang.

"When will she wake up?"

"Soon."

Qin Sang also looked at the Five Elements Crown's spirit, recalling the spirit's changes over the years.

During these years, without opportunities for combat, Qin Sang hadn't intervened much, allowing the spirit to suppress the demonic Qi on its own.

Now, the spirit had the appearance of a lovely little girl in a black dress, exquisitely delicate and endearing.

She lay quietly on the stone bed, her eyes tightly closed, her small mouth as red and plump as a flower, her small hands resting flat at her sides, her ten fingers slightly curled, her skin as fair and tender as her little face.

She looked just like a normal little girl, sleeping peacefully, harmless to humans and animals.

Anyone who saw such a girl wouldn't associate her with a demonic being.

However, Qin Sang knew very well that despite the past three hundred years, although the demonic Qi on the spirit was almost imperceptible, the demonic intent was still deeply rooted within her, like a persistent ailment, impossible to eradicate.

Suddenly, a mass of black flames appeared between Qin Sang and Zhuque, transforming into a fire lotus, suspended in the void.

With a slight thought from Qin Sang, the lotus petals unfolded, revealing the 'lotus seed' at the heart of the lotus.

Because of this Qilin Source Seed, Qin Sang still couldn't fully utilize his divine sense.  Subtly, the Qilin Source Seed had also undergone significant changes.

Before, the Qilin Source Seed only had a faint fluctuation, and it was rapidly weakening.

When Qin Sang followed Zhuque's method, changing the strategy of extracting the seed's essence, the Qilin's spiritual awareness stabilized and began to gradually grow stronger.

Now, he could clearly sense the fluctuation within the Qilin Source Seed; it was the fluctuation of life.

Qin Sang had a premonition that it might be approaching a critical point. He himself couldn't grasp it precisely and asked for Zhuque's opinion.

Zhuque flapped its wings and flew around the fire lotus, its small claws touching the fire lotus, then the Qilin Source Seed, before landing on Qin Sang's shoulder.  It answered with a seemingly unrelated question, "Do you think... Qilins lay eggs?"

What kind of question was that?

Qin Sang realized that this Zhuque's thoughts were becoming increasingly whimsical.

Were the things it had taught him before truly reliable?  Wouldn't it eventually resurrect the Qilin itself?

Qin Sang couldn't help but look at Zhuque with suspicion, "Legend says there are five types of creatures in the world, three hundred and sixty kinds of furry creatures, and the Qilin is the chief of them."

"Can't furry creatures lay eggs?"

Zhuque scoffed, "I think you might be hatching an egg.  When it hatches, it will be the day the Qilin is reborn."

"You think?"

Qin Sang was becoming more and more uneasy about this bird.

He gazed at the Qilin Source Seed, recalling his feelings over the years, and the fluctuating changes in the Qilin's spiritual awareness.

Apart from following Zhuque's guidance, he didn't seem to have a better method.

"So be it," Qin Sang shook his head slightly, "We'll do as you say.  If I can't find the Qilin's true essence in the end, I can't blame anyone else.  Anyway, your body has already recovered; you don't need the Qilin's true essence anymore."

"I knew you had ulterior motives!"

Hearing these words, Zhuque suddenly bristled, yelling loudly, "You dare to take my half! I'll fight you to the death!"

The enraged Zhuque even extended its claws, wanting to scratch Qin Sang.  Unfortunately, the difference in strength was too great; it was restrained by an invisible force and could only scratch the air.

Qin Sang ignored it, activating the fire lotus, drawing the Qilin Source Seed into its heart. The lotus petals closed one by one.

Strands of Nine Nether Demonic Fire separated from the fire lotus, and under Qin Sang's intent, they formed into a series of strange patterns. Some entered the heart of the lotus, and some merged with the petals, adding a touch of magnificence to the fire lotus.

By the time Qin Sang finished, Zhuque had also calmed down.

Qin Sang withdrew the fire lotus and took Zhuque to the copper pillar space beneath the mountain, asking, "Is it set up there?"

Zhuque was still sulking, turning its head away without answering.

Within the copper pillar space, besides the copper pillar, several clusters of spiritual light floated, each with a different color.

They were the Grey Warbler Sword, the Four-Carriage Serpent Seal, the Mingshan Armor, the Blood Sword, and other items.

Previously, Qin Sang had asked Zhuque to modify the copper pillar space.  Zhuque's cultivation wasn't high, but its ability to manipulate flames was truly unprecedented in Qin Sang's experience. This was an innate divine ability, as if it was born to be the master of all flames, something others could only envy.

Precisely because it had this ability, many tasks could be entrusted to it, saving Qin Sang a great deal of effort.

The rudiments of a fire chamber were already present here.

"Very good!"

Qin Sang didn't hold back his praise.

Hearing the compliment, Zhuque snorted, reluctantly turning its head back.

Qin Sang planned to transform this place into a fire chamber, and not an ordinary one. He intended to forge a sword for himself here in the future.

It wasn't just about transforming the Grey Warbler Sword into an ordinary spiritual treasure; it had to be perfect!

In addition, treasures like the Four-Carriage Serpent Seal could be further refined using the Chongxuan Temple's secret techniques, enhancing their power and quality.

"Let's begin!"

Qin Sang spread his hands, and the flames within the space suddenly became violent.

Zhuque plunged into the sea of fire.  With its presence, the violent flames were restrained, allowing Qin Sang to act without reservation.

Qin Sang guided the flames with his hands, wave after wave, the tremors spreading from the copper pillar space to the outside world.

'Rumble!'

The stone peak in the center of the lake trembled.

Violent waves also appeared on the magma lake.

Luo Hou was training the fire spirits in front of the mountain.  Sensing the anomaly, the fire spirits all showed expressions of unease.

"You, lead a squad east!"

...

"Anyone who dares approach this area will be killed without mercy!"

Luo Hou mobilized all the demon soldiers in the Dao Field to patrol in all directions. The demon soldiers were disciplined and obeyed orders without question, forming a considerable force.

The tremors continued until dawn several days later.

The rising sun ascended amidst the sky-reaching flames.

The copper pillar space returned to calm, its appearance greatly changed.  The flames transformed into fire dragons, one end connected to the earth's fire veins, the other end coiled around the copper pillar, and finally, all the power of the flames converged at the top of the copper pillar.

The flames there were incredibly deep, yet their aura was extremely subtle.  It looked like just an exceptionally tranquil flame. This was the 'furnace' Qin Sang had created using the Chongxuan Temple's secret techniques.

Qin Sang sat cross-legged at the edge, beckoning the Grey Warbler Sword, forcing out his essence blood, and refining it with secret techniques.

He repeated this process, leaving the treasures in the furnace for further tempering even after the initial refinement.

After completing this in one go, even Qin Sang, who also cultivated his physical body, felt a hollowness within him.

In the past three hundred years, his progress in the *Celestial Demon Body Tempering Art* had been slow.

Improvement was easy; Qin Sang had already commissioned the Cloud Cauldron City Lord to collect virulent poisons.  Unfortunately, the Poison Pearl was destroyed. Although he could still utilize the secret techniques in the *Poison God Canon* to temper his body, he couldn't be as reckless as before.

Reaching the peak of the fifth transformation and breaking through to the sixth would definitely take more time and comprehension.

There were too many things to do; he could only prioritize them one by one.

Returning to the cave dwelling, Qin Sang had just pushed the door open when his expression shifted slightly, his gaze falling upon the spirit on the stone bed.

"Ah! She's awake!"

Zhuque also noticed, its cry full of surprise as it rushed into the cave dwelling.

The spirit's long eyelashes trembled slightly, and her eyelids slowly opened, revealing eyes as black as ink.

These eyes were like deep pools, reaching into the Nine Nether, bottomless.

Zhuque's surprised expression was reflected in the spirit's eyes.

Meeting her gaze, Zhuque felt a chill, its entire body stiffening. It couldn't help but shiver, darting behind Qin Sang and pointing at the spirit, stammering, "She, she, she..."

Qin Sang also saw the spirit's eyes.

These were demonic eyes that could draw one's mind and spirit in. They seemed to be a gateway to an endless demonic realm, from which there was no escape.

The black dress didn't diminish this feeling; instead, it intensified it.

Anyone who saw these eyes wouldn't find the spirit cute; they would cry out "Demoness!" or "Demon Child!"

Even if she did nothing.

When she first awoke, the spirit's eyes were vacant, gradually showing a bewildered look, like a newborn infant opening its eyes for the first time to see this strange world.

The first thing she saw was Zhuque, her attention captured by it.  Her head turned to follow it, her movements somewhat stiff. Then she saw Qin Sang standing at the entrance.

Something about Qin Sang seemed to attract her. The spirit stared intently at him, her eyes fixed.

Perhaps inspired by Qin Sang's posture, the spirit moved her arms, her small hands groping to press against the stone bed, propping up her upper body, and then slowly standing up on the bed.

Throughout this process, the spirit's eyes remained on Qin Sang, bewilderment mixed with confusion.

The scene in the cave dwelling was somewhat eerie.

Qin Sang and the spirit faced each other, their eyes locked, gazing at each other without a word.

The spirit's expression softened the impact of her demonic eyes.

Zhuque grew bolder again, peeking out from behind Qin Sang's neck, cautiously flying in front of the spirit.

The spirit's attention was drawn to it again, tilting her small face up to observe Zhuque.

"Hey! Little one, this Zhuque is your master!  Call me 'Master'!"

Zhuque, seeing the spirit's dazed and confused look, became even bolder, chattering loudly.

"...Mas...ter..."

The spirit seemed to understand Zhuque's meaning, her small mouth opening slightly, slowly and stiffly repeating the two words.

She seemed to be pondering the meaning of these two words, but her gaze shifted to Qin Sang as she spoke, filled with innocence, bewilderment, and confusion, just looking at him.

Seeing no advantage to be gained, Zhuque hung its head and sighed.

The Five Elements Crown had been with Qin Sang for many years, and it already bore his mark. Now, only Qin Sang was qualified to be the Five Elements Crown's master.

This was the reason for the spirit's behavior.

Also a spirit, this little girl was only similar in appearance to the Earthly Dao on Emperor Bestowal Mountain.  Her temperament, demeanor, and intellect were completely different.

Qin Sang walked to the bedside, reaching out to rub the spirit's small head.

The spirit didn't dodge or attack, letting Qin Sang rub her hair, tilting her head slightly upward, her pitch-black eyes fixed on him, as if wanting to imprint his face in her memory.

"From now on, your name will be Xiao Wu."

Qin Sang said softly.

"My...name...is...Xiao Wu..."

The spirit spoke more fluently, slowly closing her eyes, leaning into Qin Sang's large hand as if she enjoyed it.

Qin Sang hadn't expected things to go so smoothly, with the spirit accepting him as her master upon awakening.

Looking at the docile Xiao Wu, he felt like he hadn't taken in a spirit, but a daughter.

"Hey! Xiao Wu, it was this Zhuque who kept you company while you slept!"

Zhuque hopped up and down, wanting to rub Xiao Wu's head too, but not quite daring to.

It knew the power of the Five Elements Crown and feared that if Xiao Wu became displeased, she might reward it with a blast of the Five Elements Absolute Extinguishing Divine Light, instantly obliterating its soul.

Xiao Wu opened her eyes again.  While there was no hostility in her gaze towards Zhuque, it wasn't as gentle as when she faced Qin Sang. There was an aloofness about her that discouraged closeness.

Qin Sang led Xiao Wu to the stone table on one side of the cave dwelling and sat down, having Xiao Wu sit opposite him.

Xiao Wu imitated Qin Sang, sitting upright on the stone stool.

"Highly intelligent, but ignorant of the ways of the world..."

Qin Sang thought to himself, but when he saw those demonic eyes gazing at him, he overturned this judgment.

"No, her expression hasn't fluctuated much since she woke up, not even smiling at me.  These eyes are enough to show that the demonic intent within her hasn't dissipated. If I'm not around, can she maintain this calmness?"

Qin Sang pondered for a long time, Xiao Wu watching him the entire time, motionless.

"How can I resolve the demonic intent within Xiao Wu?"

Qin Sang found this problem more difficult than he had imagined.  Relying on time to erode it and allowing her to recover naturally was probably not feasible.

What could he do?

"Demonic intent, demonic intent..."

Qin Sang's expression shifted as he remembered something.

Perhaps, forcibly dispelling the demonic intent wasn't the only path!

There had always been a debate among mortals: whether human nature at birth was inherently good or inherently evil, leading to the theories of innate goodness and innate evil.

Wasn't a newly born spirit equivalent to an infant with inherent demonic intent?

Regardless of whether one believed in innate goodness or evil, both acknowledged the power of education and upbringing in shaping a person's future, determining whether they would become good or evil.

As the saying goes, experience the world, understand principles, and discern good from evil…

Qin Sang's thoughts raced, and he thought of his own cultivation.

After learning the origins of the *Primordial Spirit Sword Nurturing Chapter*, Qin Sang felt that the name didn't befit the majesty of the Purple Star Emperor. Since the sword spirit said the sword scripture was nameless, he had the audacity to privately name it the *Purple Star Sword Scripture*.

The twelfth level of the *Purple Star Sword Scripture*, the key to enlightenment, lay in killing those who deserved to be killed!

Over the years, Qin Sang had been pondering the meaning of this phrase.

Who deserved to be killed?

For Qin Sang, it was naturally those who had become his enemies, but this was no different from the Soul Formation stage; the sword spirit needn't have specifically mentioned it.

If one shifted their perspective from oneself and looked at the world as a whole...

Soul Condensation cultivators pursued unity with heaven and man, the vastness of heaven, the thickness of earth, and the profoundness of the Dao.  How could the pursuit of the Dao be limited to oneself?

Some said the Heavenly Dao was impartial.

But people had emotions and desires; no one could ascend to heaven in a single step. Enlightenment had to begin with oneself.

For the people of the world, who deserved to be killed?

None other than those who slaughtered innocents and committed evil deeds!

What was the likelihood of a blood-soaked killer suddenly becoming enlightened and transforming into a chivalrous warrior dedicated to upholding justice?

Looking at the *Purple Star Sword Scripture* as a whole, from before Golden Core, condensing killing sigils through slaughter, to the confusion of the Nascent Soul stage, and then to the Soul Formation stage's sheathing of the sword and drawing it only with cause…

It seemed to make sense.

Stopping killing with killing was also a path of the sword!

Qin Sang recalled myths and legends of immortals and buddhas sending incarnations down to the mortal world to experience life and cultivate.

Perhaps, he too should journey into the mortal realm.
