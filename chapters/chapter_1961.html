<h1>Chapter 1952: The Abyss</h1><p>Qin Sang drifted within a sea of stars, drawing them into his cave abode.</p><p>The starlight was, in truth, formed by countless strands of sword energy, coalescing into sword stars.</p><p>These sword stars constantly shifted and changed, their numbers indeterminate, arranging themselves into a myriad of formations.</p><p>Their gathering and scattering reflected Qin Sang's ongoing deduction of the Southern Vermilion Bird's Seven Lunar Mansions Sword Formation.</p><p>Within this sea of stars, a single point of crimson light shone most brilliantly, a cluster of fiercely burning flames.</p><p>This mass of fire currently possessed no defined shape, existing in its most primordial form.</p><p>However, within the flames, a Vermilion Bird soared with outstretched wings, manipulating the True Fire and harmonizing with the shifting sword stars.</p><p>Qin Sang intended to use the Vermilion Bird to comprehend the Southern Vermilion Bird's Seven Lunar Mansions Sword Formation. This proved equally arduous, yet his deductions over this period had revealed a glimmer of hope.</p><p>Normally, Qin Sang would rely on his understanding of the Sword Dao to deduce the sword formation, at least constructing its rudimentary form and nurturing its unique sword intent, eventually transforming this sword intent into the Vermilion Bird's baleful aura.</p><p>Now, with a true Vermilion Bird to stand in for the baleful aura, and with the Seven Lunar Mansions Sword Formation as a reference for his deductions, Qin Sang only needed to find the point of convergence between the two.  Then, he could fuse the Vermilion Bird and the sword formation.</p><p>At that point, it could, to a certain extent, be considered a formation spirit!</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't entirely certain whether this idea would ultimately succeed.</p><p>He hoped for an auspicious start, otherwise, comprehending the other two Four Symbols Sword Formations would be even more difficult.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>The sword light abruptly vanished.</p><p>“This Vermilion Bird has really suffered a loss!”</p><p>The Vermilion Bird landed on Qin Sang's shoulder, complaining loudly. Before Qin Sang could speak, it tilted its head and fell asleep. It was truly exhausted, having poured its heart and soul into assisting Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang quietly contemplated the insights gained from this deduction. After a while, he rose and walked out of his cave abode.</p><p>……</p><p>“This is the place!”</p><p>Fu Xiao was at his wit's end.  Fortunately, the terrain here favored him, allowing him to narrowly escape death several times from attacks that would have otherwise been fatal.</p><p>But could this place truly help him shake off his pursuer?</p><p>Fu Xiao smiled bitterly.  He likely didn't even have a one in ten chance.</p><p>Yet, his will to survive hadn't diminished. Cultivators who had reached the Nascent Soul realm were all undeniably strong in spirit.</p><p>Submerged in the magma, he felt the temperature drop lower and lower as a chilling aura gradually permeated the surroundings.</p><p>Behind him, the green flames threatened to overtake him once more.</p><p>Fu Xiao gripped the object in his palm, his body plunging abruptly into the deeper depths of the magma.</p><p>As expected, his pursuer reacted immediately.</p><p>The tall man suddenly spat out a mouthful of tainted blood into the green flames, causing them to surge.  From within the green fire shot forth a dozen black chains.</p><p>At the end of each chain hung a head wreathed in green flames. The heads wore狰狞expressions, their empty eye sockets replaced by flickering green fire, emitting howls like those of malicious ghosts.</p><p>These eerie heads traversed the magma unimpeded, catching up to Fu Xiao in an instant and surrounding him in a macabre dance.</p><p>Screaming, the heads opened their gaping maws and lunged at Fu Xiao.</p><p>Fu Xiao seemed truly spent. He only managed to summon a crimson jade bracelet, which expanded into a ring of fire.  However, not only did it fail to repel the heads, but it also shattered after only a brief resistance.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>The crisp sound of shattering echoed.</p><p>The heads descended upon Fu Xiao, tearing at his flesh.</p><p>At the same time, in the lower layer of magma, Fu Xiao’s figure reappeared. His breath came in ragged gasps. Forcibly circulating his True Essence, he slammed his palm downwards.</p><p>He struck at a spot that shimmered with a strange light.</p><p>Within the light, the ruins of a palace materialized.</p><p>Long deserted, the palace appeared deathly still and desolate, exuding an aura of decay.</p><p>Yet, the murals on the palace walls remained as vibrant as new, depicting all manner of fire beasts.</p><p>These lifelike fire beasts surrounded a Fire Phoenix, their positions subtly arranged, resembling a grand formation.</p><p>Some of the fire beasts seemed strikingly vivid, as if they were ablaze and about to step down from the wall.</p><p>Not all the fire beasts were so vibrant. Many had lost their luster, but the situation was better than Fu Xiao had anticipated.</p><p>Fu Xiao's face lit up with joy.  He quickly produced a bronze mirror and aimed it at the Fire Phoenix at the center of the mural. Muttering an incantation, he drew the Fire Phoenix into the mirror. Then, mustering all his remaining strength, he hurled the mirror forward.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The Fire Phoenix burst forth from the mirror, soaring majestically within the magma.</p><p>Simultaneously, the palace exploded.</p><p>Amidst the fragments of the palace, streaks of crimson light shot out, transforming into illusory forms of fire beasts. Drawn to the Fire Phoenix, they arranged themselves around it, mirroring the mural.</p><p>However, the 'beast mural' had now come to life.</p><p>Roars rose and fell.</p><p>The beasts guarded the Fire Phoenix, circling it faster and faster, as if all the fire beasts were being drawn into a vortex of flames. A terrifying aura rapidly intensified.</p><p>By now, the tall man realized he had been tricked. The flesh torn from Fu Xiao by the heads had transformed into pieces of withered wood.</p><p>He scoffed inwardly. Just as he was about to cast a spell to locate Fu Xiao, a sudden premonition made his expression change drastically.</p><p>‘Rumble!’</p><p>A earth-shattering explosion erupted below, followed by a surge of astonishing fire elemental energy.</p><p>The scene resembled the eruption of an underground fire vein, but even more powerful and destructive!</p><p>The tall man bore the brunt of it. By the time he sensed the anomaly, the crimson torrent was already upon him.</p><p>‘Swish! Swish! Swish!’</p><p>Undaunted, the tall man hastily recalled the heads, the chains weaving into a net around him.</p><p>Simultaneously, every pore on his body erupted in flames. The green fire formed a thick armor of fire, protecting him completely.</p><p>Almost the instant the fire armor formed, the tall man was engulfed by the crimson torrent.</p><p>The next moment, the power of the fire beast formation fully erupted.</p><p>Looking down from above, one could see the surrounding magma and even the earth and mountains tremble violently. The center bulged upwards, and then scorching magma erupted, filling the sky.</p><p>The magma continued to erupt, the crimson torrent visible from afar, larger than any mountain peak.</p><p>Amidst the terrifying spectacle created by the fire beast formation, even the tall man couldn't maintain his footing.</p><p>The heads and chains finally succumbed, cracking and shattering.</p><p>However, this fire beast formation wasn't enough to kill the tall man.</p><p>Green fire surged from within him. Donning a pair of jet-black gloves, he bombarded the torrent with his palms, relying on his physical strength to resist the onslaught, and gradually began to regain his stability.</p><p>His eyes, deep and piercing, searched the crimson torrent for something.</p><p>Suddenly, he frowned, a sense of unease washing over him.</p><p>Soon, his unease was confirmed. He felt his internal Qi flow become strangely sluggish, a subtle disharmony appearing, as if he had been poisoned.</p><p>“Poison?”</p><p>Since joining the Fallen Soul Abyss and becoming a Corpse Cultivator, he hadn’t felt this sensation in a long time, having become immune to all poisons.</p><p>Just then, a mocking voice suddenly rang out beside him.</p><p>“Did that old Corpse Devil not teach you the wisdom of not pursuing a desperate foe?”</p><p>“Who’s there!”</p><p>The tall man was startled.  Catching a glimpse of a figure to his left, he immediately recognized Ling E.  “It’s you!”</p><p>“And this Marquis! We invite you to return to our residence for a chat!”</p><p>Another figure appeared on his right, closing in, trapping him between them.</p><p>The tall man's heart sank to the bottom of the abyss.</p><p>……</p><p>After activating the fire beast formation, Fu Xiao used the chaos created by the eruption to conceal himself, desperately fleeing through the magma below, hoping the fire beast formation would buy him some time.</p><p>He was truly at his limit now, leaving everything to fate, a faint sense of despair clinging to him.</p><p>After fleeing for some distance, Fu Xiao couldn't help but glance back.  Behind him was a scene of utter chaos.  He couldn’t sense anything, but he was only concerned with the Corpse Devil, who hadn’t caught up!</p><p>“The incomplete formation actually trapped the Corpse Devil!”</p><p>Fu Xiao, having survived a near-death experience, couldn't contain his elation.  As he fled, he silently thanked the Six Harmonies Sect's ancestors.</p><p>Not long after he escaped, the magma in the sky began to recede.  Two streaks of light broke through the fire.</p><p>Marquis Gui held a figure in his hand, the now powerless tall man.</p><p>The two had laid an ambush, and with the tall man poisoned, the fight had concluded quickly.</p><p>……</p><p>At the Daoist sanctuary.</p><p>Marquis Gui returned with the tall man and, upon hearing the orders, immediately took him to the Fire Chamber.</p><p>“Reporting to Master, the man has been brought here.  Prior interrogation revealed he has an accomplice lurking elsewhere. Fellow Daoist Ling E has gone to capture that person as well.”</p><p>Qin Sang sat cross-legged atop the bronze pillar, the Grey Warbler Sword floating before him, which he was refining with his lifeblood.</p><p>Marquis Gui stood respectfully by his side.</p><p>A short while later, Qin Sang stopped the refinement and looked at the slumped figure of the tall man.</p><p>The man’s senses hadn't been sealed.  Seeing Qin Sang and the arrangement of the Fire Chamber, his face was filled with shock.</p><p>But Qin Sang didn't see the reaction he was looking for.</p><p>Without any visible movement from Qin Sang, an object suddenly flew out from the tall man’s chest: a crimson jade disc, the Flame Heart Jade.</p><p>Qin Sang looked at the Flame Heart Jade, sensing a familiar fluctuation emanating from it, a power of the same origin as the bronze pillar!</p><p>This was why he had suddenly decided to have Marquis Gui bring the man here.</p><p>But judging by the man’s reaction, he didn’t seem to recognize the bronze pillar.</p><p>“Where did you get the jade disc?”</p><p>Qin Sang asked indifferently.</p><p>Marquis Gui undid the restrictions on the tall man and whispered a threat, “Fellow Daoist, you’re an intelligent man.  It’s wise to submit to circumstances.  Once Master uses the Soul Searching technique, you’ll regret it.”</p><p>In truth, the tall man no longer had any will to resist.</p><p>Seeing Marquis Gui’s respectful demeanor towards Qin Sang, addressing him as Master, a terrifying thought arose in his mind, filling him with dread.</p><p>“R… Reporting to Senior, the Flame Heart Jade was bestowed upon us by our ancestor. He commanded Senior Fei Luo to lead us into the Fire Domain to search for something that would react to the jade disc…”</p><p>The tall man, fearing for his life, revealed everything.</p><p>Qin Sang’s heart stirred. He subtly activated the Fire Chamber’s spirit formation, releasing a trace of the bronze pillar’s Qi.  The Flame Heart Jade immediately began to glow.</p><p>The tall man’s eyes widened.  None of the ruins they had found contained this bronze pillar.  The Flame Heart Jade’s reaction reminded him of a scene from two hundred years ago.</p><p>“Something’s wrong!”</p><p>At that moment, Qin Sang detected an anomaly.</p><p>Before he could investigate further, the Flame Heart Jade cracked with a snap and shattered.  But Qin Sang was faster, instantly sealing the core of the Flame Heart Jade.</p><p>“A replica, as expected!”</p><p>The crafter of the Flame Heart Jade had been extremely cautious, planting a fail-safe within it.  However, it also revealed some clues to Qin Sang.</p><p>The true Flame Heart Jade and the bronze pillar clearly shared the same origin, likely representing a crucial component of something larger.</p><p>“What is the origin of these items? What is the Fallen Soul Abyss ancestor looking for them for?”</p><p>Qin Sang had initially believed that the secret of the bronze pillar had been lost to the annals of history.</p><p>He glanced at the tall man. The Fallen Soul Abyss ancestor certainly wouldn't reveal the true secret to them, so asking wouldn't yield any valuable information.</p><p>After inquiring about the other ruins, Qin Sang pondered for a moment and waved his hand.  “Take him away.”</p><p>Marquis Gui bowed in acknowledgement and withdrew from the Fire Chamber.</p><p>……</p><p>Several months later.</p><p>Marquis Gui and Ling E stood side-by-side on a rocky outcrop, watching two streaks of light streak across the sky.</p><p>“Recently, there have been more and more mysterious figures wandering the Fire Domain, making it inconvenient to venture out. Fortunately, we gathered enough spirit herbs earlier,” Marquis Gui said.</p><p>Ling E raised his hand, pointing at one of the streaks of light.  “The escape technique that person is using… it closely resembles the renowned Xiao Yun Extreme Heaven Great Dharma of the Cloud Capital Heaven!”</p><p>“Cloud Capital Heaven?  It must be related to the incident a few months ago.  Could it be that after escaping back to his sect, Fu Xiao of the Six Harmonies Sect reported it to the Cloud Capital Heaven?” Marquis Gui speculated.</p><p>“Is the Cloud Capital Heaven simply targeting the Fallen Soul Abyss, or are they also interested in what the old devil is searching for? What kind of treasure could be so valuable!”</p><p>Ling E was equally curious, turning to look at the cave abode on the mountaintop.  “Master hasn’t issued any commands. I wonder what his plan is. Will he secretly seize the treasure or wait and see how things unfold?”</p><p>“Master naturally prioritizes his cultivation and comprehending the Great Dao.  How could he be easily moved by some ruins of unknown value? Fellow Daoist, there’s no need for needless speculation.  We only need to follow orders,” Marquis Gui shook his head and returned to the cave abode.</p><p>The entire Daoist sanctuary had been concealed by activating the spirit formations, as per Qin Sang’s instructions.</p><p>……</p><p>The Fallen Soul Abyss.</p><p>True to its name, the entire sect was located within a lightless abyss.</p><p>Situated west of Mount Mu Luo, the abyss was a fissure in the earth, wide at the top and narrowing towards the bottom.</p><p>Deeper into the abyss, tomb-like caves and coffins suspended from the cliff faces gradually appeared.</p><p>Even insects and beasts dared not enter this place.  There were no other sounds besides the whistling wind, the eerie and terrifying atmosphere growing ever more intense.</p><p>Shadows occasionally flickered past, resembling ghostly apparitions.</p><p>At the very bottom of the abyss flowed a river of black, murky water, leaving behind sludge-like residue on its banks, yet emitting a faint, sweet fragrance.</p><p>The black river flowed silently.</p><p>Suddenly, a figure in black robes descended, landing on the riverbank.  He addressed the river respectfully, “Master, your disciple requests an audience.”</p><p>The river remained silent.</p><p>The black-robed figure waited patiently.  Finally, a voice responded, “Speak.”</p><p>The voice was icy cold, devoid of any emotion.</p><p>The black-robed figure didn’t dare hesitate, quickly saying, “Junior Brother Fei Luo and the others have been exposed.  The Cloud Capital Heaven has dispatched experts into the Fire Domain. They’ve likely realized we’re searching for the Coiling Dragon Ancient Formation. Junior Brother Fei Luo, feeling he has failed his mission, is currently kneeling outside, awaiting Master’s judgment.”</p><p>This time, the river didn’t remain silent for long, although the voice remained indifferent.</p><p>“Earlier than anticipated.  However, once begun, it was inevitable that the Cloud Capital Heaven would notice.  What else do you have to report?”</p>
