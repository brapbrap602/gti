<h1>Chapter 1501: The Ritual of the Yuan (4k)</h1><p>Chapter 1501: The Ritual of the Yuan (4k)</p><p>A Heavenly Tribulation loomed overhead.</p><p>Thunderbolts were imminent.</p><p>The first thunderbolt, though the weakest, was repelled by Gu Jin and Yin Changsheng.  The remaining energy failed to completely destroy the Blood Pool of Slaughter.</p><p>However, the second thunderbolt would inevitably level the pool, leaving Tong Lingyu no chance of survival.</p><p>‘Bang! Bang! Bang!’</p><p>Tong Lingyu, her face etched with anxiety, frantically pounded against the Blood Pool's walls.</p><p>Sealed within the pool, her senses blocked, she hadn't witnessed the subsequent battle. She couldn't see what was happening outside, unaware of the situation.</p><p>Even through the pool, the oppressive weight of the Heavenly Tribulation was keenly felt, filling her with despair.</p><p>The Blood Pool cracked, significantly weakening the sealing power. But Tong Lingyu was severely injured, and most of the restrictions on her body remained unbroken, her strength only partially restored.</p><p>Barriers she once effortlessly shattered now stood like impregnable walls.</p><p>Seeing this,</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes flashed.  He swiftly flew towards the top of the crater, pointing at his Golden Sinking Sword and sending a sword qi hurtling towards the edge of the Blood Pool.</p><p>His reasons were twofold.</p><p>First, Qin Sang knew Tong Lingyu's condition; rescuing her posed no threat. His main body still had energy, currently refining pills to recover his true essence. By the time Tong Lingyu was freed, unsealed, and had stabilized her injuries, he would also have recovered some strength, especially with the Four-Rank Serpent Seal in his possession.</p><p>Second, after Yin Changsheng's death, Tong Lingyu's assistance was needed. The crater's traces would be obliterated by the tribulation. If both Tong Lingyu and Yin Changsheng died here, leaving only him and Liuli alive, how would the cultivators of the Xuan Tian Palace react?</p><p>He himself could come and go freely, unafraid of the Palace's resentment, but he still had enemies – the Demon Elder Hun Mo, the Great Saint Tian Peng, and countless other demons.</p><p>He needed to remain in the Sacred Land to seek fragments of the Killing Sword, and at the very least, couldn't allow the Xuan Tian Palace to become an obstacle.</p><p>Furthermore, the Xuan Tian Palace had occupied the Sacred Land for years, familiar with its secrets; perhaps he could glean information from Tong Lingyu.</p><p>Tong Lingyu had to be saved!</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>The sword qi arrived instantly, precisely striking a fissure.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>The sword qi pierced through, its light erupting. The crack exploded, sending blood surging.</p><p>Inside the Blood Pool, Tong Lingyu, nearly succumbing to despair, suddenly felt a sharp energy approaching. The sealing power on her lessened, and she glimpsed the blurry scene outside the pool.</p><p>Overjoyed, she mustered her remaining strength and burst free!</p><p>Before she could assess the situation, Qin Sang's voice echoed in her ears, “The thunderbolt is coming, quickly come up, Daoist Tong!”</p><p>Tong Lingyu didn't hesitate, managing in that final moment to grab Luo Yun, who was sealed in ice, before hurriedly flying towards Qin Sang.</p><p>Finally, Qin Sang successfully escaped the crater.</p><p>Above the crater was a clear area, surrounded by dark mist.</p><p>No one else was in sight.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression softened. He flew towards the dark mist, feeling safe enough to stop, gently setting Liuli down before turning back to the crater and the tribulation clouds.</p><p>“Thank you, Daoist Qin, for saving my life,”</p><p>Tong Lingyu said, having escaped alongside him.</p><p>Her face was pale, her beautiful features marred by two long, bleeding wounds, adding a touch of tragic beauty. Her breath was ragged.</p><p>She mistakenly believed that the Heavenly Thunder had been summoned by the Sky-Eyed Butterfly and that Qin Sang had followed her plan, delaying until Yin Changsheng's demonic possession triggered the tribulation.</p><p>Qin Sang’s depleted essence also indicated a grueling battle.</p><p>“This is Xuan Tian Palace’s Fei Xue Pill; it rapidly replenishes true essence. I hope, Daoist Qin, you won't refuse it.”</p><p>There was no longer any need to conceal her identity as Daoist Qingfeng.</p><p>Tong Lingyu produced a vial of pills and gave them to Qin Sang.</p><p>She then collapsed, sitting down, closing her eyes, taking medicine to heal and break through the restrictions on her body.</p><p>Fei Xue Pill, one of the Xuan Tian Palace's top-grade spiritual pills, was well-known to Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang opened the vial, confirming there was no trickery, before taking two pills. A coolness spread through him as his true essence recovered much faster; the quality was indeed superior to the pills he had prepared.</p><p>He glanced at Luo Yun beside Tong Lingyu.</p><p>Luo Yun was like an ice sculpture.  His essence was even weaker, almost imperceptible, leaving unclear how much strength he retained after being released; he certainly needed extensive rest to recover.</p><p>‘Rumble…'</p><p>The tribulation clouds churned violently.</p><p>Azure lightning, like thick pythons, radiated a terrifying aura of destruction.</p><p>Deep within the Sacred Land…</p><p>Several figures moved through the darkness and turbulence, their speed fluctuating.  Occasionally, the currents forced them to change course, but their goal was clear, and they quickly recovered their trajectory.</p><p>Soon, they sensed the turbulence slowing considerably.  They immediately accelerated, finally seeing something real.</p><p>A stele!</p><p>Its base was intact, shaped like a lotus flower, thirteen tiers supporting the stone monument.</p><p>The stele was uninscribed, devoid of runes, its surface flawlessly smooth.</p><p>It stood fixed in the void, unmoving.  The chaotic energies of ancient prohibitions and other turbulent forces somehow avoided it, diverting around the stele.</p><p>In the endless darkness, this single stele stood as testament to its extraordinary nature.</p><p>“This is it!”</p><p>Hun Mo Lao Ren dashed ahead, reaching the stele with a delighted expression.</p><p>Tian Peng Da Sheng and the others followed closely.</p><p>Seeing the stele, their eyes gleamed with anticipation.</p><p>“The stele’s found! Xuan Tian Palace won’t be able to pursue us here for a while.  Fellow Daoist, may we now unseal the Ruyi?”</p><p>Tian Peng Da Sheng looked intently at Hun Mo Lao Ren.</p><p>Hun Mo Lao Ren remained impassive, though inwardly regretful.</p><p>He’d invited Tian Peng Da Sheng and the other demonic cultivators, intending to use them against the Palace Master and Grand Elder of Xuan Tian Palace.  Unexpectedly, Xuan Tian Palace hadn’t interfered at all, offering no resistance. They found the stele effortlessly.</p><p>The demonic cultivators were unharmed; he, however, was now in a difficult position.</p><p>If he'd known, he would have brought fewer people.</p><p>As it was, Hun Mo Lao Ren couldn’t risk making a move; he'd become a target for everyone.</p><p>However, the Lingzhi Ruyi remained in his possession, giving him the best chance of benefiting from it.</p><p>Hun Mo Lao Ren slowly nodded, taking out the Lingzhi Ruyi.  As he prepared to unseal it, his expression froze. He turned towards the entrance of the sacred ground.</p><p>The others felt it too.</p><p>They were in the deepest part of the sacred ground, far from the floating mountain where the tribulation clouds were gathering, separated by the turbulent darkness.  Their perception of the heavenly tribulation was muted.</p><p>“Is that…a human tribulation? Someone’s undergoing ascension here?”</p><p>A Yao Wang voiced their suspicion.</p><p>“The Xuan Tian Palace sacred ground… could this also be a tribulation sacred ground?  No wonder Yin Changsheng lived so long!”</p><p>Yu Yi Yuan Jun’s eyes sparkled, her mind racing with speculation. Her breath grew heavier.</p><p>Even with life-extending elixirs, heavenly tribulations were formidable, their power increasing with each successive ordeal, like a death knell.</p><p>Others showed similar surprise and avarice.</p><p>Hun Mo Lao Ren chuckled, "I've investigated for many years, but I've never heard of a tribulation sacred ground. Perhaps my information was lacking. If any of you are interested, you can investigate. I, however, can't wait any longer, I'll unseal the Lingzhi Ruyi now.”</p><p>With that, Hun Mo Lao Ren lightly tapped the Lingzhi Ruyi.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>Finally freed, the Lingzhi Ruyi vibrated intensely, releasing an incredibly bright white light.</p><p>The light was blinding,</p><p>like a second sun, illuminating the heavens.</p><p>The demonic cultivators instinctively squinted, awestruck.</p><p>Hun Mo Lao Ren had anticipated the unsealing would be spectacular, but not this intense.</p><p>Fortunately, he’d been cautious, waiting until they found the stele.</p><p>Then, they sensed an unprecedented, strange energy emanating from the Lingzhi Ruyi. Before they could react, it shot towards the stele with astonishing speed.</p><p>They couldn't—and wouldn't—stop it.</p><p>‘Click!’</p><p>The Lingzhi Ruyi embedded itself seamlessly into the lotus base.</p><p>The stele then creaked, slowly sinking back into the lotus base. Mist billowed, dispersing the darkness, revealing a vast space shrouded in white mist, ethereal and seemingly otherworldly.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The light vanished abruptly.</p><p>Everyone stared intently at the space behind the stele, astonished to discover a hidden realm.</p><p>The sacred ground had been thoroughly searched by Xuan Tian Palace countless times, and the Lingzhi Ruyi had been brought in by Hun Mo Lao Ren. This space seemed to have opened for the very first time.</p><p>An untouched realm!</p><p>At this thought, their breaths quickened.</p><p>The treasures on the floating mountains alone sustained Xuan Tian Palace's power; this space was clearly far more mysterious.</p><p>Greed simmered in their hearts.</p><p>Hun Mo Lao Ren's expression, however, darkened. His gaze shifted from the space behind the stele to the lotus base.</p><p>The Lingzhi Ruyi was embedded, becoming a perfectly fitting part of the lotus base, as if it had always belonged there.  Hun Mo Lao Ren tried everything to remove it, but the treasure was beyond his control.</p><p>The result was unexpected.  The Lingzhi Ruyi seemed to be merely a key, and it was unclear whether it could only be retrieved after the stele space closed again.</p><p>Even the Hunmo Elder didn't know how to close the stele.</p><p>Losing the Lingzhi Ruyi, his advantage vanished completely.</p><p>Tianpeng Saint quickly noticed this and burst into laughter.  "Hunmo Daoist friend, it seems obtaining treasures here will depend on individual luck, haha..."</p><p>Before his voice faded, Tianpeng Saint transformed into a golden light and rushed into the fog.</p><p>Hunmo Elder snorted and followed closely, others quickly followed suit.</p><p>...</p><p>The strange phenomenon created by the Lingzhi Ruyi was also visible on the Floating Mountain.</p><p>Shang Lu, Jiang Dianzhu, and others also noticed the white light that suddenly bloomed and then abruptly extinguished deep within the sacred land.</p><p>However, due to the obstruction of the dark turbulence, they couldn't see the stele space opening, and had no time to spare; the tribulation clouds were about to brew the next tribulation thunder.</p><p>They eagerly wanted to break through the ancient prohibition and witness the Palace Master's tribulation firsthand.</p><p>The tribulation thunder surged.</p><p>The azure light dispelled the darkness.</p><p>Thunder pythons frantically converged towards the center of the tribulation clouds.</p><p>At this moment, a figure burst from the ground.</p><p>Yin Changsheng's face was completely disfigured; he had gone completely mad.</p><p>'Crack!'</p><p>The tribulation thunder was dense, like a river overflowing, its azure light illuminating the heavens.</p><p>The thunderous roar shook the earth.</p><p>Tong Lingyu was awakened and looked at Yin Changsheng battling the heavenly tribulation, her gaze complex.</p><p>He had once been Xuan Tian Palace's mainstay, an unparalleled genius, reputed as the most promising person in the North Sea to break through to the Divine Transformation stage.</p><p>His supernatural powers were renowned, commanding respect throughout the land, forcing the boundless sea demons to avoid the Hidden Sun Realm and keeping the Nine-Headed Saint from daring to step out of the demon realm.</p><p>Tong Lingyu, Luo Yun, Bing Yao, and others grew up listening to Yin Changsheng's legends, holding him in the highest esteem.</p><p>But at some point, Yin Changsheng changed...</p><p>Her thoughts tumbled, and Tong Lingyu suddenly noticed the Xuanjian Tower above Yin Changsheng's head; her distracting thoughts instantly vanished, leaving only intense shock.</p><p>The Xuanjian Tower possessed the power of a spiritual treasure!</p><p>Tong Lingyu was not only shocked by this.</p><p>How did Qin Sang and Liu Li survive in front of the Xuanjian Tower?</p><p>Liu Li's state was somewhat strange, not quite normal, but Qin Sang seemed unharmed, only having depleted his true essence.</p><p>This person's strength... was unfathomable!</p><p>Tong Lingyu couldn't even imagine.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The tribulation thunder, like a raging storm, struck the defiant figure.</p><p>Yin Changsheng spread his arms, roaring wildly amidst the thunder, his demonic might overwhelming, with an aura of wanting to charge into the tribulation clouds.</p><p>'Bang!'</p><p>The Xuanjian Tower finally shattered.</p><p>The tinkling sound ceased abruptly.</p><p>The remaining light transformed into brilliant rays of light, ultimately blocking a tribulation thunder for its master.</p><p>With his natal treasure destroyed, Yin Changsheng inevitably suffered a heavy blow, his body trembling, his breath weakened, already heading towards his end.</p><p>Perhaps it was a last flicker of life.</p><p>The madness on Yin Changsheng's face dissipated, his eyes regaining clarity, his entire demeanor undergoing a drastic change, reverting to the person Tong Lingyu was familiar with.</p><p>The thunder was like a sea.</p><p>Yin Changsheng didn't look at the thunderclouds above.</p><p>Past events flashed through his mind.</p><p>Whether it truly stemmed from his heart or was influenced by evil sorcery, those things had been done and were irreversible; he would not regret them.</p><p>His eyes held only a hint of melancholy.</p><p>His gaze fixated on the entrance to the sacred land, as if wanting one last look at this vibrant world.</p><p>Then, without looking back, he flicked his wrist, sending a stream of light towards Tong Lingyu.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The tribulation thunder engulfed him.</p><p>Tong Lingyu reached out and caught the stream of light, discovering it was a token inscribed with the words 'Xuan Tian,' the Xuan Tian Order of the Xuan Tian Palace Palace Master.</p><p>Scanning the token with her divine sense, Tong Lingyu's face showed surprise, followed by a degree of understanding.</p><p>At this moment, she noticed Qin Sang's gaze and quickly handed the Xuan Tian Order over.</p><p>Qin Sang probed with his divine sense, seeing that the Xuan Tian Order contained a secret technique called the 'Sacrifice Essence Technique,' more accurately described as a method of refining artifacts.</p><p>Through the Sacrifice Essence Technique, nurtured with one's own divine sense, one could refine an exquisite artifact, artificially cultivating the artifact's spirituality until it ascended to a spiritual treasure.</p><p>In this process, the artifact's power would surpass that of an exquisite artifact but fall short of a true spiritual treasure; it would be called a pseudo-spiritual treasure.</p><p>The power of a pseudo-spiritual treasure varies greatly, depending on the artifact's material and the degree of refinement by the Sacrifice Essence Technique.</p><p>However, the requirements and difficulty of performing the Sacrifice Essence Technique were extremely high.</p><p>First, the Sacrifice Essence Technique could only be used on natal treasures – one of the unique aspects of natal treasures.</p><p>Second, cultivators must at least reach the Divine Sense Manifestation stage to have any chance of success, generally only late-stage Nascent Soul cultivators dare to attempt it.</p><p>Third, refining a natal treasure into a true spiritual treasure is an incredibly long process, and even Yin Changsheng was far from achieving it.</p><p>Seeing that it was such a secret technique, Qin Sang was initially somewhat disappointed, but then a thought occurred to him.</p><p>If he used the Sacrifice Essence Technique on the Ebony Sword, could it help stabilize Yun Youzi's true spirit and accelerate the process of spiritual cultivation?</p>
