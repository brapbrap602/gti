<h1>Chapter 790: Flower Fairy Lake</h1><p>Chapter 790: Flower Fairy Lake</p><p>Qin Sang pondered for a moment, then flew towards the teleportation array.</p><p>He revisited the valley, but found nothing new.</p><p>Finally, he retraced his steps, descending layer by layer until he exited the Sky Tower.</p><p>Both the Yuan Ying cultivators from the two clans were gone.  There were clear signs of intense fighting outside the plaza, indicating a battle that raged from inside the tower to outside.</p><p>It remained unclear who had won.</p><p>The area outside the tower was calm. Qin Sang cautiously surveyed his surroundings, then darted into the forest.</p><p>He checked the time.  He had some time left, but it was clearly impossible to attempt the heavily guarded secret realms.  At most, he could search the mountains for a while, hoping to find some spirit fruits.</p><p>Just as Qin Sang was about to leave, he looked down at his insect container and remembered a perfect place to go.</p><p>Within the Seven Killing Palace, there are three highly toxic areas: the Purple Mist Wasteland, the幽谷 (Yougu -  literally "dark valley"), and the Flower Fairy Lake. Others fear them like tigers, but Qin Sang could move freely within them.</p><p>The Fat Silkworm has repeatedly proven its abilities; places inaccessible to even the most potent antidotes are no match for it.</p><p>The Yougu is only accessible during the Seven Killing Palace's periodic opening.</p><p>The Flower Fairy Lake, like the Purple Mist Wasteland, can be entered and exited at will.</p><p>This location is a depression in the terrain. Before becoming a toxic zone, it was likely a large lake, hence the name "Fairy Lake". The "Flower" is derived from a unique plant ubiquitous in Flower Fairy Lake—the plant is the source of the lake's toxicity.</p><p>The Flower Fairy Lake is also in these mountains; he could go there on his way back.</p><p>A deadly poison permeates the area. Very few cultivators dare venture into these three toxic zones, making the chances of finding something there far greater than outside.</p><p>Xiang Yi and the young man both relied on antidotal treasures bestowed by the Merchant League to enter the Purple Mist Wasteland. Besides them, Qin Sang hadn't encountered a single person in the Purple Mist Wasteland, highlighting the rarity and preciousness of such antidotal treasures.</p><p>The Flower Fairy Lake is probably no different.</p><p>Even if he could find food similar to the purple crystal for the Fat Silkworm in Flower Fairy Lake, it would be a worthwhile trip.</p><p>Along the way, he could also try to sense the bone flute's location again.</p><p>With so many cultivators gathered in the Sky Tower, and even after encountering the two clans' Yuan Ying cultivators, the bone flute hadn't glowed again.</p><p>"I hope that person didn't die in the Seven Killing Palace,"</p><p>Qin Sang stood on a mountain peak, gazing into the distance, thinking to himself.</p><p>The Seven Killing Palace has countless secret realms and intricate restrictions. If that person died in some corner, the treasure would remain buried.</p><p>A gloomy cloud hung in the distant sky, faintly tinged with green. He activated his talisman and sped towards it.</p><p>There are two dock-like structures near Flower Fairy Lake, serving as entrances. Qin Sang headed straight for the closest one and arrived smoothly.</p><p>"I still haven't found that person. I'll take a look around Flower Fairy Lake. If the Fat Silkworm doesn't find anything, I'll go to the Wasteland early to wait. Maybe I can find that person there..."</p><p>Qin Sang pondered this thought,</p><p>while simultaneously checking his possessions.</p><p>He had plenty of spirit stones and demon pills. The young man from the Xi You Alliance was a top-tier Foundation Establishment cultivator with a strong background, leaving him a considerable fortune.</p><p>It would be best if he could buy the bone flute with spirit stones.</p><p>However, Qin Sang thought this was unlikely.</p><p>This situation was different from last time. The person from Huntian Island was desperate and had to sell the bone flute to survive.</p><p>If he specifically sought to buy the bone flute, the other party wouldn't let go easily; he would need a strategy. He had already decided that the magical treasures he had taken from others, including the Golden Yao Lock and the Golden Light Armor, could be used for trade.</p><p>"Without the spiritual plants from Xuanpu Palace, the Three Lights Jade Liquid is merely a healing elixir, comparable in value to ten-thousand-year spirit milk. If necessary, using a drop for trade wouldn't be a problem…"</p><p>With these thoughts in mind, Qin Sang gradually approached Flower Fairy Lake.</p><p>The Flower Fairy Lake is no smaller than the Purple Mist Wasteland. It is said that there are no abysses or ravines in the lake, but the dangers in the lake's center are no less than those of the Purple Mist Wasteland.</p><p>From afar, Qin Sang saw a vast green lake.</p><p>A vibrant toxic algae grew everywhere in the lake. The algae emitted a green bioluminescence, standing tall and slender, illuminating Flower Fairy Lake like a gigantic, beautiful jade.</p><p>From a distance, Qin Sang could vaguely see the dense algae. A gentle breeze rippled the surface, creating waves of light.</p><p>When these algae mature, they shoot out seeds from their tips.  Shaped like buds, they are light as willow fluff, swirling and dancing in the air, yet strangely unable to leave the confines of Flower Fairy Lake.</p><p>The buds slowly bloomed,</p><p>countless beautiful petals danced gracefully above Flower Fairy Lake, forming a breathtaking picture under the bioluminescence, captivating the viewer.</p><p>But beneath the beauty lurked deadly poison.</p><p>The pollen from this algae carries a poison that terrifies cultivators.</p><p>By the shore of Flower Fairy Lake, a wooden bridge extended into the water, its entrance partially hidden by swirling flower petals.  The bridge, old and weathered, was one of two entrances to the lake.</p><p>Qin Sang landed softly, ensuring no one followed, and approached the ancient bridge.  Midway, he sensed something amiss, quickly ducking behind a rock, his brow furrowed as he observed the bridgehead.</p><p>Poisonous algae surrounded the bridge, but it appeared deserted.  No one was visible. Yet, Qin Sang felt uneasy.</p><p>From his vantage point, he quickly spotted a spirit array, cleverly concealed near the bridge entrance.  The camouflage wasn't sophisticated, but the pervasive pollen within Flower Fairy Lake would mask it from anyone approaching from the lake – a perfect trap.</p><p>“Who set this trap?” he muttered.</p><p>The location was remote, one of two entrances to the lake, and whether anyone had even entered remained unknown.  To set a trap here to kill and steal treasure seemed a gamble.</p><p>Qin Sang felt this was strange.  Searching further, he noticed an unusual mist shrouding a nearby grove.  He sensed a concealed, poised sword aura.</p><p>The aura was familiar.</p><p>“It's her!”</p><p>Qin Sang was astonished.  Hidden there was Madam Liu!</p><p>Of the eight who entered the Seven Kill Hall, Qin Sang had a positive impression of Madam and Master Liu. They hadn't participated in the plot against him.  </p><p>Madam and Master Liu had mentioned entering the Seven Kill Hall to find a rare herb for Madam Liu.  To find her here, lying in wait, was unexpected.</p><p>Qin Sang usually avoided others' conflicts, but this scene made him thoughtful. He noticed she was alone; Master Liu was absent.</p><p>The Lius were known for their devotion. Unless something drastic had happened, Master Liu wouldn't leave her alone in such a dangerous place.  The Seven Kill Hall was fraught with peril.</p><p>“Who is Madam Liu ambushing? Could it be… something that happened after they left the Purple Mist Wasteland?”</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes lit up. He decided to remain hidden, donned his cloak, and found a place to observe.</p>
