<h1>Chapter 822: The Demon Lord</h1><p>Liangqiu Island.</p><p>The island's appearance had drastically changed, now dominated by a flag formation.</p><p>Spectral banners, each ten feet tall, some planted in the ground, others floating in mid-air, filled the area.  At the formation's center, a formation disk hovered, magnified countless times.</p><p>The banners shone with a rich yellow light, all converging towards the formation disk.</p><p>At the heart of Liangqiu Island, a yellow light shot skyward, transforming into a massive cocoon of light.</p><p>On the cocoon's surface, countless runes and miniature spectral flags flickered, rotating along with the cocoon. Inside, a small human figure, trapped and frantic, relentlessly assaulted the light cocoon.</p><p>If anyone were to witness the scene within the cocoon, they would be astonished. For it was a Nascent Soul, its physical body destroyed by the killing formation, leaving only the lone Nascent Soul desperately attempting to teleport to freedom.</p><p>However, the cocoon proved incredibly resilient.  Not only did it withstand the attacks, but it also rapidly compressed inwards. Each attempted teleportation by the Nascent Soul was effortlessly blocked.</p><p>Powerless to resist, the Nascent Soul watched in despair as the cocoon shrunk.</p><p>“Who are you?!”</p><p>The Nascent Soul roared in fury, but its cries went unanswered.</p><p>Countless flag shadows drifted towards the Nascent Soul, seemingly carrying a restrictive force.  The Nascent Soul's resistance weakened, on the verge of being completely subdued.</p><p>Meanwhile, two mysterious figures floated on either side of the light cocoon, pouring their energy into the formation disk.</p><p>One of the figures, clad in grey robes, seemed to sense something. He glanced towards the distance but remained focused on manipulating the flag formation and trapping the Nascent Soul within.</p><p>The combined power of the two figures, amplified by the flag formation, left the Nascent Soul utterly helpless.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>Finally, the formation disk shattered, dissolving into a shower of yellow light.</p><p>The cocoon shrank dramatically, and the Nascent Soul within fell silent. A Nascent Soul cultivator had been captured alive.</p><p>With a flick of his sleeve, the grey-robed figure absorbed the cocoon, then swept his gaze across the area, ensuring no trace of the formation disk remained.</p><p>His companion flew over.</p><p>“It went smoothly. We finally captured Yin Laomo alive.  We need to leave. Those old monsters have probably been alerted and are heading this way. We’ll be trapped if we don’t leave now.”</p><p>The black-robed figure looked around.  “Where is your soul servant?”</p><p>“Dead.”</p><p>The grey-robed figure gazed towards where the woman had fallen. “Killed in retaliation.”</p><p>The black-robed figure exclaimed, “Dead?  There was only one opponent?  You invested considerable effort in refining those soul servants. Even when we were at the late Core Formation stage, we could defeat them, but killing one would have been nearly impossible…We’ve truly encountered a formidable foe!”</p><p>“However formidable, they’re still just a Core Formation junior…”</p><p>A hint of anger laced the grey-robed figure's voice as he transformed into a streak of light and shot away.</p><p>Soon, the two arrived at the spot where the woman had fallen.</p><p>The sea surface was empty. The culprit had long since escaped, leaving no trace.</p><p>…</p><p>Qin Sang immediately fled after eliminating the soul entity.</p><p>After making a large detour and hiding for a day, Qin Sang, convinced there were no pursuers, began flying towards Quheng Island, hoping to gather information.</p><p>On his way to Quheng Island, he sensed a distinct unease in the air.  Most islands along the way had activated their protective formations, and the cultivators he encountered seemed hurried and anxious.</p><p>Qin Sang inquired everywhere, eventually stopping a Core Formation cultivator to ask about recent events.</p><p>“The Island Lord of Yinzhu Island is dead.  It’s said that two nights ago, he was besieged by mysterious experts in broad daylight. A Nascent Soul cultivator, his fate remains unknown.  Not only the Island Lord, but also several Core Formation cultivators near the battlefield were caught in the crossfire and perished. The losses were heavy.  Those villains were so brazen!  The two Island Lords are furious and have ordered a thorough investigation. Both righteous and demonic factions in the Liefeng Archipelago have been mobilized, and many cultivators of unknown origin have been apprehended. Everyone is on edge now. Fellow Daoist, it's best not to wander around. Like me, return to your cave and wait for the storm to pass, lest you arouse suspicion.”</p><p>The cultivator spoke frankly, sharing everything he knew.</p><p>“Yinzhu Island? I recall that Island Lord was a demonic cultivator. Could it be revenge?”</p><p>Qin Sang frowned in surprise. He initially thought Luo Daotong’s backer was one of the two Island Lords of Quheng Island. He searched his memory and remembered that Yinzhu Island was a prominent island nearby, and its Island Lord was indeed a demonic cultivator.</p><p>“I wouldn't know. After all, he was a powerful demonic cultivator. How could he lack enemies? Many fellow Daoists share the same speculation…”</p><p>Lowering his voice, the cultivator spoke mysteriously, “There are rumors on Quheng Island that this Island Lord wasn’t ordinary. He had close ties to the Demon Lord. That’s why the two Island Lords are so alarmed and diligent. They fear the Demon Lord’s wrath.  If the Demon Lord were angered, millions could die, and even the Liefeng Archipelago wouldn't be spared!  No matter where those attackers hide, they will likely be found.  The cultivation world is about to be thrown into chaos…”</p><p>The cultivator shook his head as he bid farewell to Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang watched him leave.</p><p>“The Demon Lord!”</p><p>A chill ran down his spine.</p><p>Even the demonic path wasn't monolithic.</p><p>But as the most powerful demonic cultivator, the Demon Lord’s faction was undoubtedly the strongest.  Who else could command the Island Lord of Yinzhu Island and summon several Nascent Soul experts?</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly understood why Senior Qingzhu had been so cautious, concealing his identity and hiding in a remote corner for two hundred years.</p><p>His enemy was the Demon Lord!</p><p>This was a truly despairing opponent.</p><p>No matter how talented Senior Qingzhu was, it was impossible for him to gain the strength to confront the Demon Lord in a mere two hundred years.</p><p>Qin Sang recalled the near-fatal experience in the Heavenly Tower, when he was swept by the residual energy of the battle between the Demon Lord and the Great Shaman.  He felt even more despair than Senior Qingzhu, lacking even the qualification to stand before the Demon Lord.</p><p>“Finally, I’ve learned their identity and know who to be wary of… but this enemy is too terrifying, one of the great cultivators standing at the peak of the Canglang Sea. How can I defend against him?  Aside from avoiding him, there’s nothing I can do.  I hope Senior Qingzhu didn’t make an enemy of the Demon Lord because of the teleportation formation…”</p><p>Qin Sang smiled bitterly.</p><p>At the same time, he was puzzled by the recent events.</p><p>The other party, like him, had targeted Luo Daotong and the Island Lord of Yinzhu Island, and at the same time. Was it truly just a coincidence, a matter of revenge against the Island Lord of Yinzhu Island?</p><p>The situation was complex, but he lacked the ability to find the true culprit and unravel the mystery.</p><p>“Forget it.  Although I didn't meet Senior Qingzhu in person, I haven’t come away empty-handed.  The other party dared to target someone connected to the Demon Lord, so they must be prepared.  This turmoil won’t subside easily.  It's time to leave, lest I get caught up in it. I’ve been out long enough.  It’s time to return to Tianxing Island.  There’s still much to do.”</p><p>Qin Sang made up his mind and immediately left the Liefeng Archipelago. His origins were unclear, and if he were captured and mistaken for an accomplice of the attackers, it would be a grave injustice.</p><p>He changed direction and flew away from the Liefeng Archipelago.</p>
