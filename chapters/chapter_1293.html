Chapter 1285: The Earthen Puppets

The Heavenly Eye Butterfly observed in secret.
There were no other Nascent Soul cultivators nearby; Qiu Zhi Xianzi was alone.
Qin Sang did not attempt to retreat or hide.
He was well aware that once his identity was exposed, the Sin Abyss would not allow him to rampage unchecked. They would either send powerful experts to suppress him or dispatch opponents capable of countering him to restrict his actions.
Qin Sang was not surprised by Qiu Zhi's appearance.
Moreover, it was unclear who would be restraining whom.
Qin Sang had already slain Yue Sanren and restrained a mid-stage Nascent Soul cultivator from the Sin Abyss. His achievements had already exceeded expectations. Now, he could focus solely on dealing with Qiu Zhi, leaving the other battlefields to his allies.
Thinking this, Qin Sang raised his arm and suddenly retracted all the Netherworld Demonic Flames into his sleeve.
As the demonic flames vanished, Qin Sang summoned the Ebony Wood Sword once more. He swiftly executed a series of sword techniques, the sword's radiance flickering unpredictably as the flying sword pointed directly at Qiu Zhi Xianzi.
"So you are Qin Sang!" Qiu Zhi Xianzi said coldly. "Why not use your demonic flames?"
Qin Sang's Demonic Flame Banner had been the subject of much awe and fear, especially after the self-destruction of the Blood Demon Avatar by Old Demon Ye. It had become a terror to the cultivators of the Sin Abyss.
However, Qiu Zhi Xianzi showed no fear. Instead, she seemed eager to test the power of the demonic flames.
"Ending the battle in an instant would be rather dull. Why don't you first try to block my flying sword, Xianzi?" Qin Sang replied indifferently.
The Ebony Wood Sword gleamed brilliantly, splitting into numerous sword lights that materialized in the void, each one pointing at Qiu Zhi Xianzi. The killing intent merged with the sword's will, creating a chilling aura that subtly sealed off the surrounding space.
Qiu Zhi Xianzi, being somewhat accomplished in the sword path herself, felt the depth of Qin Sang's skill more acutely than others. A trace of gravity flashed in her eyes.
No wonder Yue Sanren had lost his life so easily after being trapped in the sword formation. With just his sword techniques, this man could already claim a place among the top cultivators of the Northern Star Realm.
Qiu Zhi Xianzi snorted disdainfully. "You killed Yue Sanren without using your more powerful Demonic Flame Banner, opting instead for a sword formation. This shows that you lack confidence in using the banner to trap and kill him. Either the demonic flames have flaws, or you cannot control them perfectly, leaving gaps for him to escape. Now it seems the limitations of the Demonic Flame Banner go even further. The power of the demonic flames is unparalleled in my experience, but you've only recently formed your Nascent Soul. It must be difficult for you to sustain the consumption of such a treasure, isn't it?"
Qin Sang's expression darkened.
This woman's cunning was extraordinary. Without even engaging in combat, she had deduced the weaknesses of his Demonic Flame Banner merely by observing his actions.
The reason he had abandoned the Demonic Flame Banner and switched to the Ebony Wood Sword was precisely this.
Deploying all eighteen demonic banners consumed too much energy, making it difficult to sustain for long periods. In previous uses, it had only been during critical moments, when facing powerful enemies or in life-and-death situations.
Moreover, controlling the banners required intense focus. Now that he was deep in enemy territory, he needed to conserve some strength to avoid being dragged into a trap.
If he couldn't use the banners freely, it was better to rely on his natal spirit sword and the Seven Souls Slaughter Formation.
Seeing Qin Sang remain silent, Qiu Zhi Xianzi became even more certain of her speculation. For someone who had just formed their Nascent Soul to slay the Blood Demon Avatar seemed too fantastical. No matter how powerful a treasure was, it remained an external tool. True strength lay in one's cultivation.
The battle at the Blood Lake had been forced by the circumstances. If the Blood Demon Avatar had wanted to escape, Qin Sang would not have been able to stop it.
'Whoosh!'
Qiu Zhi Xianzi's jade-like fingers formed a sword seal, and a ball of yellow light flew out from her palm, transforming into a massive Xuanhuang Great Sword, which she grasped firmly.
Her slender fingers tightly gripped the hilt of the great sword, which she pointed diagonally at Qin Sang.
Seeing the great sword, which was as large as a door panel, Qin Sang couldn't help but be momentarily stunned.
Qiu Zhi Xianzi's petite frame contrasted sharply with the massive sword, creating a strange yet violent beauty as she wielded it.
'Buzz!'
Qiu Zhi Xianzi's jade arm trembled slightly.
A dense yellow light erupted from the Xuanhuang Great Sword, but instead of attacking Qin Sang, it scattered onto the ground beneath her.
At the same time, her other hand flicked out repeatedly, releasing streams of lightâ€”spiritual talismans. As the talismans merged with the yellow light, the ground began to writhe.
Then, earthen puppets emerged from the ground.
These puppets were tall, their bodies composed of angular stone blocks. Despite their seemingly cumbersome appearance, they moved with surprising agility. Each puppet held a stone sword, a replica of the Xuanhuang Great Sword.
'Swish!'
The puppets raised their swords high, resonating with Qiu Zhi Xianzi's Xuanhuang Great Sword. An unusual ripple of energy spread out.
"A sword formation!" Qin Sang, also a sword cultivator, recognized it immediately.
The scene before him reminded him of the puppet sword formation he had encountered in the Seven Slaughter Hall. It seemed Qiu Zhi Xianzi had fused her understanding of the sword path with talisman techniques, summoning earthen puppets to create a unique sword formation.
Qin Sang would not let Qiu Zhi Xianzi have her way. Without hesitation, he urged the Ebony Wood Sword forward, striking with lightning speed!
Sword lights rained down.
Qiu Zhi Xianzi stood firm, unmoving. Suddenly, she reversed her grip and plunged the Xuanhuang Great Sword into the ground.
'Boom!'
The earth shook.
The Xuanhuang sword light surged into the earthen puppets, as if coating them in a golden layer. Their aura intensified, and they turned abruptly, glaring at Qin Sang as their great swords slashed down!
In the next moment, a thick Xuanhuang sword light, swift and fierce, cleaved toward the Ebony Wood Sword. Simultaneously, a sword screen materialized before Qiu Zhi Xianzi.
The Ebony Wood Sword shattered the Xuanhuang sword light and pierced into the sword screen, only to encounter immense resistance. It felt as though countless spiritual swords were continuously attacking the Ebony Wood Sword.
Qin Sang rapidly changed his sword techniques.
The Ebony Wood Sword, sharp and unyielding, finally closed in on Qiu Zhi Xianzi. With a flick of the sword, the void dimmed, and even the Xuanhuang Great Sword lost some of its brilliance.
Just as Qiu Zhi Xianzi seemed about to meet the same fate as Yue Sanren, she suddenly twisted the great sword. The earthen puppets merged with the Xuanhuang Great Sword in her hand, and the sword formation was complete!
The two sword masters clashed head-on.
All the earthen puppets were connected by their auras, moving in unison as they encircled Qiu Zhi Xianzi. Despite Qin Sang's continuous changes in formation, he could not harm Qiu Zhi Xianzi's true body.
Unbeknownst to him, Qiu Zhi Xianzi was also inwardly shocked.
She had fused her understanding of the sword path and talisman techniques, and her cultivation was a level higher than Qin Sang's. Yet, unlike Yue Sanren, who had been helpless, she found herself unable to overcome the Seven Souls Slaughter Formation. If not for her strong spiritual sense, she would have been greatly affected.
This man's sword techniques must have an extraordinary origin!
Qiu Zhi Xianzi narrowed her eyes and raised the Xuanhuang Great Sword to counterattack.
'Rumble...'
The Gale Formation and the Sin Abyss's defensive formations clashed violently, with fierce winds and towering waves.
Qin Sang and Qiu Zhi Xianzi fought for countless rounds, their battle reaching deep into the formation.
Their duel lacked the earth-shattering spectacle one might expect.
In the dim void, undercurrents surged, and bursts of Xuanhuang sword light occasionally erupted. It looked more like a sparring match between two skilled sword cultivators than a life-and-death struggle.
Suddenly, the Heavenly Eye Butterfly issued a warning. Qin Sang's expression changed slightly, and with a flap of his Thunder Wings, he instantly shifted dozens of feet to the side.
As Qin Sang moved, the ground beneath him silently writhed. Four earthen puppets leaped out without warning, their great swords raised high. Four sword lights crisscrossed, sealing off all directions as they slashed toward Qin Sang's previous position.
Qiu Zhi Xianzi had somehow hidden these puppets within the ground, merging them with the rocks without the slightest ripple of energy.
Fortunately, the Heavenly Eye Butterfly had been vigilant.
