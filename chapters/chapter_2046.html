<h1>Chapter 2037 Qiong Zhe Mountain</h1><p>“Senior, you’ve returned!”</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang, Gu Ya’s anxious heart finally eased.</p><p>Ever since the Beast Taming Hall escorted her to Silver City, she had been on tenterhooks. Every day, cultivators from near the Feng Ju Jade Gate migrated here. The situation hadn’t improved; instead, the number of migrating cultivators had increased sharply yesterday, including long-established clans who had uprooted themselves entirely.</p><p>News had spread that two peerless experts had clashed outside the Feng Ju Jade Gate, a world-shaking battle that nearly overturned the gate itself. Fortunately, a mysterious figure appeared at the last moment and mediated the fight.</p><p>Those who witnessed the battle recounted the sky filled with blood rain and earth-splitting azure dragons, their hearts still pounding. Even sheltered within the city's protective formation, they felt as if they were adrift, the blood rain threatening to fall upon them at any moment.</p><p>After the battle, the Feng Ju Jade Gate was practically a ghost town, and no one knew how long it would take to recover. Moreover, the chaos had just begun. Powerful figures continued to appear outside the Feng Ju Jade Gate. Perhaps one day, the Jade Gate would be destroyed in the fighting.</p><p>Gu Ya had rented a secluded courtyard as temporary lodging. However, Silver City was overflowing with people, land prices had soared, and the rent was not cheap.</p><p>“Is the matter settled?” Qin Sang asked, entering the courtyard.</p><p>He had previously instructed Gu Ya to keep an eye out for any treasures appearing in Silver City.</p><p>The chaos of the Feng Ju Jade Gate also presented opportunities. The properties at the Jade Gate were worthless, and the cultivators who had abandoned their homes and businesses found it difficult to settle elsewhere.  They might be forced to sell treasures they had cherished for years.</p><p>As Qin Sang predicted, auctions were held daily in Silver City. He wasn't the only one trying to profit from the disaster.</p><p>Gu Ya responded affirmatively, and a dozen spheres of spiritual light flew out from her waist.</p><p>“Following Senior’s instructions, I’ve exchanged for some spirit materials. Also, I’ve inquired about the Golden Moon Jade.”</p><p>“Oh?”</p><p>Qin Sang's interest was piqued. Golden Moon Jade, like Azure Trace Essence and Thousand-Feathered Spirit Silk, were indispensable spirit materials for constructing the Thunder Altar.</p><p>“Who possesses the Golden Moon Jade, and how much is there?”</p><p>Gu Ya replied, “It belongs to the Huang family, who migrated from the Feng Ju Jade Gate. I don’t know how much Golden Moon Jade they have. Limited by my cultivation, I can’t always receive the news immediately. I’ve heard that several seniors have visited them, but none could reach an agreement. I intended to visit them tonight…”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, deciding to visit the Huang family directly.</p><p>He wouldn’t stay in Silver City for long. He took Gu Ya with him, preparing to go to the Xin family to claim the estates of Cultivator Pei and Recluse Zhong Liang, and then find a good buyer.  Nascent Soul estates were extremely valuable; plenty of people would be willing to take them over.</p><p>The Xin family resided in the northern part of Dui Prefecture, a region known as the Darklands by human cultivators. While not as chaotic and bloody as the legends suggested, it was far from peaceful. They needed to depart quickly to avoid unforeseen complications.</p><p>Determined to acquire the Golden Moon Jade, he made careful inquiries and learned that the Huang family wanted to exchange it for a specific spirit pill.</p><p>Qin Sang didn’t have the spirit pill, but he did have several rare spirit herbs collected from the Chen family's secret vault.  Taking a chance, he offered two of the spirit herbs and successfully obtained the Golden Moon Jade.</p><p>Human cultivators mostly focused on cultivating themselves. It was generally believed that spirit herbs of the same rank were more valuable than other spirit materials. It seemed the Huang family knew it would be difficult to exchange the Golden Moon Jade directly for the spirit pill, so they had to take an indirect approach.</p><p>Leaving Silver City, Qin Sang soared into the sky on his sword, enveloping Gu Ya in sword light as they flew north.</p><p>“Senior, where are we going now?”</p><p>Gu Ya’s thoughts had already flown back to the Small Cold Realm.</p><p>Transferring to Kan Prefecture, then eastward to the East Sea, they would have to pass through the territories of various outsider tribes before reaching the Storm Realm. She didn’t know what hardships they might face along the way. She couldn't do it alone.</p><p>“First to Qiong Zhe Mountain, then we’ll go to Xu Wei City,” Qin Sang said.</p><p>Xu Wei City, the capital of Kan Prefecture, was the legendary Immortal City built on the back of an ancient giant turtle.</p><p>Gu Ya was overjoyed but then realized something, her expression falling. “Does this mean we can never enter the Violet Firmament Palace again?”</p><p>From the time she joined her sect, she had practically grown up listening to legends of the Violet Firmament Palace. In her youth, she yearned to visit it, but by the time she had the ability to explore it independently, the Palace had already ascended, a lifelong regret.</p><p>Qin Sang hummed in agreement. “With so many powerful figures gathered at the Feng Ju Jade Gate, they must be there to divide the Violet Firmament Palace. From now on, the Immortal Palace will have a master, and the world might never see the Violet Firmament Palace again!”</p><p>Gu Ya felt a pang of sadness. She had never witnessed the true grandeur of an Immortal Palace. Even though she knew the Violet Firmament Palace didn't belong to the Storm Realm, she couldn’t sever her emotional attachment. She couldn't help but sigh, “I wonder if there are any seniors inside who ascended from the Storm Realm?”</p><p>Qin Sang had also considered this question.</p><p>For countless years, the Storm Realm had produced generations of geniuses, and those who successfully ascended to the Greater Thousand World shouldn't be few in number.</p><p>Not to mention the Yao and Wu tribes, just considering the human race in the Central Continent, both the Buddhist and Daoist lineages had produced Nascent Soul cultivators in almost every generation. The Formless Immortal Sect, which previously dominated the Central Continent, with its five elemental branches, must have had more than one Nascent Soul cultivator in each generation. Going further back, there was also the mysterious Wuwang Temple.</p><p>These sects, with their unbroken lineages, likely established branches in the Greater Thousand World, continuing their heritage. But during his years at the Feng Ju Jade Gate, Qin Sang hadn't encountered a single one.</p><p>For him, this wasn’t necessarily a bad thing.</p><p>Having learned of Liu Li’s whereabouts and the Storm Realm's ascension, Qin Sang’s interest in contacting ascended cultivators from the lower realm had gradually waned.  His plan was to establish the Thunder Altar in the Storm Realm as his personal cultivation ground, using it to comprehend the Great Completion Killing Dao.</p><p>Since it would be his own cultivation ground, he wouldn't allow others to pry.</p><p>If the ascended cultivators only relocated their sect's descendants, it would be acceptable.  However, he feared they might want to control the Storm Realm.</p><p>This was very likely. The Violet Firmament Palace had caused such a stir in the Greater Thousand World that anyone could see the Storm Realm was extraordinary and would want to hold it in their grasp to study it thoroughly.</p><p>If that happened, faced with their overwhelming power, Qin Sang would either have to leave or become their subordinate, neither of which he desired.</p><p>Regarding Su Nu, Qin Sang had thought long and hard and decided to tell her the truth.</p><p>The Storm Realm had landed within the territory of the Outsider tribes, surrounded by alien races and isolated. He feared he would be unable to cope alone if he returned. Perhaps the Storm Realm was already in a precarious situation, about to be drawn into war, requiring him to seek allies.</p><p>After careful consideration, there was no better choice than Su Nu. Of course, Su Nu might not be willing to fight for the Storm Realm; he still had to ask her opinion.</p><p>Su Nu had been waiting at the agreed-upon location. By the time Qin Sang and Gu Ya arrived, her injuries had healed by eighty percent.</p><p>Qin Sang recounted his experiences at the Feng Ju Jade Gate. Seeing that Su Nu wasn't surprised, he guessed she had heard some rumors.</p><p>“It’s a pity about the treasures within the Violet Firmament Palace. They’re completely beyond our reach now,” Su Nu sighed. “What are your plans, Brother Qin?”</p><p>“Do you still remember the Xin family?”</p><p>Qin Sang briefly described the situation. “The Xin family seeks my protection, and I’ve instructed them to obey you. There are also two Nascent Soul cultivators’ estates there, now without owners. You can choose one as your cultivation ground.”</p><p>Su Nu sensed the underlying meaning. “Brother Qin has other destinations?”</p><p>Qin Sang said, “I need to go to Kan Prefecture, then to the East Sea, to attend to a matter. I’m just afraid you wouldn’t be able to endure the arduous journey.”</p><p>Su Nu straightened. “There are Great Teleportation Formations between the Eight Great Celestial Prefectures, so what hardship would there be?  Without Master, I am but a solitary wanderer, like a feather in the wind, going wherever fate takes me. If Brother Qin’s task is dangerous, I can assist you, giving me a chance to repay my debt.”</p><p>She paused, then suddenly realized something and quickly explained, “If this matter concerns Brother Qin’s secrets and shouldn’t be known to me, I will stay with the Xin family and await your return!”</p><p>“If you have no urgent matters, come with me to Kan Prefecture,” Qin Sang said.</p><p>Having reunited with Su Nu, the three continued north. Once they left Dui Prefecture, the Feng Ju Jade Gate behind them was no longer their concern.</p><p>…</p><p>The Darklands, a place that Dui Prefecture cultivators spoke of with fear.</p><p>In reality, the Darklands was a gathering place for cultivators and factions unwilling to submit to the Great Zhou Dynasty. It wasn't truly lawless.  At least in the southern part of the Darklands, near the Great Zhou Dynasty, it was mostly populated by human cultivators, with their own order.</p><p>Qiong Zhe Mountain, where the Xin family resided, was located in this area.</p><p>When the three arrived at Qiong Zhe Mountain, Qin Sang stopped in mid-air and looked down. The area around Qiong Zhe Mountain, though without swamps, was surrounded by over a dozen rivers, shimmering under the sunlight, a network of abundant waterways.</p><p>He remembered Young Master Xin mentioning that most of these rivers converged into a lake called Qiong Lake.</p><p>The cultivators here were referred to as Qiong Lake cultivators.</p><p>There was no single dominant force around Qiong Lake.  Including Cultivator Pei, Recluse Zhong Liang, and previously the Xin family, various factions surrounded Qiong Lake, balancing each other's power, rising and falling in turn.</p><p>Qin Sang crushed the jade talisman in his hand and focused his gaze. Qiong Zhe Mountain was shrouded in thick fog, sealed by a formation.  The cultivators within were fully armored, hurrying about, the atmosphere tense.</p><p>Within the mountain:</p><p>Most of the Xin family cultivators had not yet returned; only Young Master Xin and a few others had secretly slipped back.</p><p>“Young Master, the spies from Azure Water Stronghold have been frequently lurking outside the mountain these past few days. Something feels amiss. How long until Elder Qin arrives?”  The Xin family’s Grand Elder asked worriedly.</p><p>Azure Water Stronghold was a sect under Recluse Zhong Liang’s command. They were a powerful force, occupying one of the most spirit-rich cultivation grounds by Qiong Lake thanks to Recluse Zhong Liang’s formidable cultivation.</p><p>Cultivator Pei had no interest in managing a sect and only took a few disciples, but each one was exceptionally talented and highly cultivated.</p><p>To avoid alerting the enemy, they had kept the deaths of Cultivator Pei and Recluse Zhong Liang a secret since returning from the Feng Ju Jade Gate, planning to wait for Qin Sang’s arrival to sweep them away in one fell swoop.</p><p>Young Master Xin looked at Steward Luo beside him. “Steward Luo, have you found out if Recluse Zhong Liang left a Blood Spirit Lamp at Azure Water Stronghold?”</p><p>The Blood Spirit Lamp was a treasure similar to a soul lamp, capable of indicating the well-being of sect members outside.  However, Recluse Zhong Liang might not have been willing to leave his soul essence behind.</p><p>They needed to ascertain whether Azure Water Stronghold knew about Recluse Zhong Liang's death. If they knew and still dared to harass them, it meant they had likely found a new backer, adding another variable.</p><p>Cultivator Pei's disciples, on the other hand, hadn’t shown any unusual activity, suggesting they were still unaware of their master’s demise.</p><p>Steward Luo shook his head. “Those who know about the Blood Spirit Lamp would certainly keep it a secret. It's impossible to find out. I’ll try to keep an eye on the core members of Azure Water Stronghold.”</p><p>Young Master Xin nodded and said gravely, "Our Xin family's only path is to rely on Elder Qin. However, we have no prior relationship with him. We must not expect Elder Qin to solve all our problems.  Such minor matters of intelligence gathering shouldn't trouble Elder Qin…"</p><p>As he spoke, Young Master Xin seemed to sense something. He looked up and gazed for a moment, then smiled.  “Elder Qin has arrived!”</p><p>Everyone was overjoyed and hurried out to greet him.</p><p>Back in the main hall, the Xin family surrounded Qin Sang, ushering him to the seat of honor. Learning that Su Nu was also a Nascent Soul cultivator, the last trace of unease in their hearts vanished. Two Nascent Soul cultivators against Azure Water Stronghold; there was no possibility of failure.</p><p>Upon seeing Su Nu, Xin Sheng observed her discreetly.</p><p>During the years she slept beside Qin Sang, she wasn't completely oblivious to the outside world. On the contrary, her spiritual senses were incredibly sharp at that time.  Seeing Su Nu now, she still felt a sense of familiarity.</p><p>Only when Qin Sang inquired did Xin Sheng collect her thoughts and quickly explain the situation at Qiong Lake. The allies of Azure Water Stronghold were bound by shared interests. Recluse Zhong Liang was their greatest reliance. Without him, they only needed to breach Azure Water Stronghold's formation, and the rest would be insignificant.</p><p>With Qin Sang and Su Nu joining forces to attack, Azure Water Stronghold would find it hard to resist. However, doing so would create too much commotion.  What they wanted was an intact cultivation ground, not a ruined one.</p><p>“Have your people lure out a core disciple of Azure Water Stronghold. I’ll use a secret technique to control them.  With someone on the inside, we can break the formation,” Su Nu said.</p><p>Since Su Nu was willing to act, Qin Sang didn't need to worry. He turned to Xin Sheng. “I won’t stay here long. If the Xin family encounters trouble, I might not be able to assist in time. Consider whether you want to relocate the Xin family to Dui Prefecture. After you break through to Nascent Soul, you can reclaim your ancestral lands.”</p><p>Although Xin Sheng had gained opportunities in the tomb, breaking through to Nascent Soul wasn’t something that could be achieved overnight. With Ming Ling perishing alongside Cultivator Pei and Recluse Zhong Liang, the Xin family had lost their Nascent Soul combat power and would struggle to maintain their footing in the Darklands.</p><p>Xin Sheng was taken aback. She hadn’t expected that even the Azure Water Stronghold wouldn’t keep Qin Sang there.</p><p>She was naturally happy for Qin Sang that he had better options, but she also worried it would become harder to meet. However, since she had chosen not to reveal herself, she would bear the pain of longing silently.</p><p>Fortunately, as long as she maintained her connection with the Xin family, she could reveal herself at any time.</p><p>Xin Sheng immediately bowed. “We will follow Elder Qin’s arrangements.”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded. As a guest elder of the Five Elements Alliance, it wouldn't be difficult for him to ask the alliance to arrange a place for the Xin family to settle.</p><p>At this moment, after discussing with Steward Luo and the others, Su Nu decided to personally visit Azure Water Stronghold.</p><p>Qin Sang remained at Qiong Zhe Mountain, keeping Xin Sheng behind, and asked, “Do you know of any trade routes to the Wu tribe within the Darklands?”</p><p>Xin Sheng raised her head slightly, her almond eyes fixed on Qin Sang, concealing a hint of tenderness within her heart. She lowered her gaze and said, “It’s rumored that after the Feng Ju Jade Gate’s destruction, there were several more battles between the two races. The formation of the Darklands is related to this. The Wu tribe has always been wary of the human race, stationing troops north of the Feng Ju Jade Gate. Even if one could safely traverse the Darklands, they would be blocked by the Wu tribe’s army. If Elder Qin wishes to go to the Wu tribe, it’s safer to travel through Li Prefecture. It’s said that at the border between Li Prefecture, the Western Buddhist Lands, and the Wu tribe’s territory, there is some trade and the conflict has eased somewhat. But the two races have always been at odds, even hostile to each other.  It's unwise to venture deep into their territory.”</p><p>Qin Sang gave a noncommittal response, waved his hand to dismiss Xin Sheng, and furrowed his brow in thought.</p><p>Just as Xin Sheng said, the two races were at odds, and travel was difficult.  His Natal Insect Gu technique might fool ordinary people, but it likely wouldn’t conceal his true nature from powerful Wu tribe figures.</p><p>He would have to wait to find Ghost Mother and Liu Ying.  After helping the Storm Realm gain a firm foothold, he could bring along a few Wu tribe cultivators from the Storm Realm for cover. That might be better.</p>
