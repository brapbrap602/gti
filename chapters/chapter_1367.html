<h1>第一千三百五十九章 Grand Ceremony</h1><p>At the summit of the Main Peak, a clear spring flowed.</p><p>Above the clouds, on the Immortal Platform, exquisite fragrance wafted in the air, accompanied by thousands of auspicious glows.</p><p>Golden tables and jade platters were laden with delicacies, rare flavors, immortal fruits, and fine nectar.</p><p>The assembled Nascent Souls were ushered onto the Immortal Platform, exchanging congratulations.</p><p>As instructed by Qin Sang beforehand, Mu Yifeng was also led onto the Immortal Platform and given a seat.</p><p>Surrounded by numerous Nascent Souls, Mu Yifeng answered every question posed to him with neither servility nor arrogance.</p><p>The unexpected and unannounced departure of Dongyang Bo took everyone by surprise.</p><p>Seeing the attitude of the Azure Goat Temple towards Mu Yifeng, the Nascent Souls realized that there must be some connection between them. Taking Qin Sang into consideration, they refrained from further investigation, suppressing their various thoughts.</p><p>Jing Yu spared no effort, personally receiving guests on behalf of Qin Sang.</p><p>Only the master seat remained vacant.</p><p>Before long, the Netherworld Demon Lord actually arrived in person, causing the Nascent Souls to rise and welcome him with astonishment.</p><p>As time passed, more and more cultivators arrived at the Azure Goat Temple.</p><p>Beneath the Main Peak, the crowd bustled with activity. Regardless of the level of their cultivation, all were treated with spirit fruits and fine wines, eliciting waves of praise.</p><p>The auspicious hour arrived.</p><p>The bells tolled once more, one after another, continuously. The deep, sonorous sound of the bells echoed throughout the Azure Goat Temple.</p><p>In that instant, Heaven and Earth fell silent, the void became clear, and only the sound of the bells lingered.</p><p>Beneath the Main Peak, ten thousand cultivators held their breath, looking up in anticipation.</p><p>On the Immortal Platform, the Nascent Souls also fell silent, turning their gazes toward Jing Yu.</p><p>Jing Yu walked to the master seat, surveyed the four directions, and, with a surge of true essence, his voice overwhelmed the sound of the bells, "Respectfully invite the Azure Goat Temple Master, Qin Sang!"</p><p>A slight commotion rippled through the crowd, but it was quickly silenced.</p><p>The Immortal Platform trembled.</p><p>From the core forbidden area, a cloud bridge suddenly stretched out, directly connecting to the Immortal Platform of the Main Peak.</p><p>In the next moment, everyone felt a blur before their eyes, and a figure appeared out of thin air on the cloud bridge.</p><p>This person was as handsome as a youth, clad in a simple azure Daoist robe, with a calm demeanor, smiling as he looked at the crowd. It was none other than Qin Sang.</p><p>The Nascent Souls on the Immortal Platform cupped their hands in salute from afar.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded slightly and strode toward the Immortal Platform.</p><p>At the same time, Li Yufu and the others had somehow arrived at the Main Peak.</p><p>All disciples of the Azure Goat Temple gathered together, and Shangguan Lifeng also descended the mountain slightly.</p><p>There were Golden Core cultivators such as Li Yufu, Shangguan Lifeng, Aunt Mei, Zhao Ying, Tan Yien, and others.</p><p>There were also Demonic Core stage demonic beasts, such as Chi Lei, Old Monkey, White Crane, and White Cat, who were brought to bolster the occasion.</p><p>The disciples climbed the mountain a short distance, quietly waiting beneath the Immortal Platform, looking up at the cloud bridge, their faces filled with fervor and a sense of pride.</p><p>Qin Sang remained focused, walking leisurely amidst the sound of the bells.</p><p>On his body, there seemed to be an indistinct fluctuation, brewing.</p><p>The Nascent Souls were the first to notice Qin Sang's little trick, and their smiles deepened.</p><p>But as Qin Sang drew closer, the smiles on the faces of a few people faded.</p><p>That fluctuation turned out to be sword intent. At that moment, Qin Sang seemed to have transformed into a sword. With each step he took, his sword intent intensified.</p><p>This sword intent represented Qin Sang's own understanding of the Sword Dao, the *Yuanshen Sword Nurturing Chapter* , and the *Seven Souls Killing Formation*, rather than relying on the power of spirit swords. It was incomparably pure.</p><p>The first to lose their smiles were the sword cultivators. They understood the astonishing achievements Qin Sang had attained in the Sword Dao.</p><p>In the past ten years, Qin Sang had refined a Corpse Flower Blood Amber, and his cultivation had greatly improved.</p><p>More importantly, he had comprehended the techniques and gained deeper understanding, especially in the *Seven Souls Killing Formation*, where he had accumulated much and was now flourishing, mastering the Sword Formation!</p><p>Now, even when urging the high-grade Golden Obsidian Sword to unleash the Sword Formation, its power surpassed that of using the Cloud Wanderer Sword.</p><p>Qin Sang had once considered holding the grand ceremony together after breaking through to the mid-stage of the Nascent Soul realm, astonishing the world in one fell swoop.</p><p>But he was unsure how long it would take him to break through.</p><p>Moreover, he would need to concentrate on closed-door cultivation later, without the energy to attend to outside matters.</p><p>The name of the Azure Goat Temple was already widely known, and there was no point in delaying any longer.</p><p>In any case, his achievements in the *Seven Souls Killing Formation* would prevent anyone from looking down on him.</p><p>The sword intent he emanated was an illusion of the *Seven Souls Killing Formation*, causing the Nascent Souls on the Immortal Platform to widen their eyes one by one.</p><p>By the time Qin Sang walked off the cloud bridge and ascended the Immortal Platform, only the Netherworld Demon Lord, Lu Boyuan, and a few others could maintain a calm demeanor.</p><p>But in their eyes, a look of fear emerged.</p><p>If it was said that Qin Sang had previously earned a great reputation, most of the credit belonged to external objects such as the demonic banner, demonic fire, and Cloud Wanderer Sword.</p><p>Now, they truly acknowledged Qin Sang!</p><p>The other Nascent Souls looked solemn, as if facing a great enemy.</p><p>As long as Qin Sang drew his sword, they had no confidence in being able to withstand it!</p><p>The bell rang eighty-one times and stopped, just as Qin Sang reached the peak of the Immortal Platform.</p><p>He looked up at the firmament, his expression unchanged, but in his eyes there was a hint of remembrance.</p><p>Qingzhu, Yun Youzi, Jixin Daoren, Mingyue…</p><p>Familiar faces flashed through his mind.</p><p>The carefree days in the Azure Goat Temple, the journey through many difficult obstacles with Yun Youzi, Qingzhu's final brushstroke of peach blossoms…</p><p>Scene after scene, event after event, remained fresh in his memory.</p><p>Finally, he had reached this step, fulfilling the last wishes of his old friends.</p><p>At the same time, he would also leave a striking mark on this world!</p><p>Qin Sang sensed Yun Youzi's true spirit, a gleam flashing in his eyes, and the sword intent that had been brewing to its peak suddenly erupted!</p><p>Amidst countless gasps of shock, a phantom sword shadow left his body and slashed toward the void!</p><p>In an instant, the wind and clouds changed, and a Sword Formation manifested in the void. Countless sword lights roamed, appearing and disappearing unpredictably, changing endlessly, mysterious and unfathomable, as if transforming into a chaotic Sword Domain.</p><p>The Nascent Souls were all solemn, staring intently at the Sword Formation.</p><p>The low-level cultivators down the mountain couldn't help but cover their eyes after a glance, their eyes stung by the sword light, and tears streamed down their faces.</p><p>When the changes in the Sword Formation reached their limit, it suddenly went from movement to stillness, the sword light became restrained, leaving only three ancient characters — Azure Goat Temple!</p><p>The characters formed by the sword light slowly descended.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>One side of the Main Peak's cliff was shaved off, the mountain did not shake, and no dust was raised, but the three characters were eternally engraved there!</p><p>Li Yufu's eyes were excited, and he led the disciples to kneel down, "Greetings, Temple Master!"</p><p>Subsequently,</p><p>Jing Yu cupped his hands, "Congratulations to Temple Master Qin on establishing the sect!"</p><p>The Nascent Souls congratulated in unison.</p><p>Ten thousand cultivators down the mountain congratulated again.</p><p>"Congratulations to Temple Master Qin on establishing the sect!"</p><p>…</p><p>"Qin, upholding the wishes of his predecessors, establishes the Azure Goat Temple, being reckless and fearful… Thank you, fellow Daoists, for attending the ceremony!"</p><p>Qin Sang turned around, returned the greeting, and then his gaze fell on Li Yufu and the others.</p><p>The Nascent Souls knew that the grand ceremony was not yet over, savoring the sword intent Qin Sang had just displayed, patiently observing the ceremony.</p><p>In fact, in the world of cultivation, there are many intricacies in the grand ceremony of establishing a sect.</p><p>If one were to delve into them, it would not be completed even after several hours.</p><p>Qin Sang did not want to waste time with too many formalities. After admonishing the disciples and ordering them to kowtow to the spirit tablets of Yun Youzi and Qingzhu, the grand ceremony was nearing its end.</p><p>Finally, Qin Sang flicked his sleeves, and eighty-one Beast King Banners flew out.</p><p>"Thank you, Temple Master, for the treasure!"</p><p>Li Yufu and the others took charge of the Beast King Banners and demonstrated the changes in the Banner Formation in public.</p><p>In an instant, black smoke billowed beneath the Immortal Platform, and the souls of the cloud beasts roared, captivating and frightening.</p><p>Fortunately, the souls of cloud beasts could be used to replace demonic beasts; otherwise, it would be difficult to reveal this to the public.</p><p>The Banner Formation transformed endlessly.</p><p>It was only a demonstration, and its power was not fully displayed, but it still attracted the attention of the Nascent Souls.</p>
