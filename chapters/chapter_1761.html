<h1>Chapter 1752: The Demon Altar</h1><p>"Deities are conferred by mortals!"</p><p>Qin Sang's expression shifted slightly.</p><p>From the words of the Wolf Demon, he had learned that the City God and Mountain Deities under the jurisdiction of the Dao Court were not only responsible for restraining the demons and ghosts within their territories but also had to dispatch troops to capture any rampaging demons or ghosts to prevent disturbances to the common folk.</p><p>Moreover, in this realm, when mortals offered sacrifices to the gods, gathering at local temples, the deities could use their divine power during the rituals to cleanse the mortals of the Six Heavens' Ancient Qi that had invaded their bodies.</p><p>Outside the Dao Court's jurisdiction, however, mortals lived in chaos, left to fend for themselves. It was said that their appearances resembled those of malevolent ghosts, and they were referred to as "Ghost People."</p><p>According to this, could it be that the Dao Court maintained order in this realm by conferring divine titles?</p><p>Qin Sang knew little about the divine path and couldn't fathom how it was achieved. However, he had no intention of becoming a deity. Being under the Dao Court's control meant he couldn't leave his conferred territory at will, and he wasn't sure what other restrictions might be imposed on his cultivation. He would be bound for life, subject to the will of others.</p><p>Moreover, receiving a divine title required passing through the Dao Court's ritual altars or the altars of various sects, indicating that it wasn't something easily obtained.</p><p>Thinking this, Qin Sang couldn't help but glance at the Wolf Demon a few more times. This demon had seized an altar after destroying it and could still manipulate the altar, commanding demonic troops. Could there be some profound mystery behind this?</p><p>When Qin Sang questioned him, the Wolf Demon guessed his thoughts, realizing that this Daoist was far from a benevolent figure. He immediately became more cautious.</p><p>Reflecting on the matter, the Wolf Demon also felt a pang of regret.</p><p>Many of the intricacies had only become clear after he seized the altar.</p><p>The Wolf Demon's former master was a True Person who had attained the Mystic Ascension rank.</p><p>The Wolf Demon was not a soldier of the Danxiao Prefecture. The True Person, seeing his unique talents, thought he could be a valuable asset and took him under his wing, only to end up with a disaster.</p><p>The True Person had encountered a powerful enemy, suffered severe injuries, and his personal guards were slaughtered. Coincidentally, he had obtained a treasure that was extremely useful to the Wolf Demon. Seizing the opportunity, the Wolf Demon turned against him, leading the wolf troops to destroy the altar.</p><p>After the Daoist was betrayed by his troops and the altar was seized, because the troops had always meditated on the deity alongside the Daoist, a mysterious connection remained. Thus, the Wolf Demon could still utilize and seek refuge in the altar.</p><p>However, the Wolf Demon was merely a usurper of the altar, not its true master.</p><p>In daily cultivation, the meditation on the deity had to be led by the altar's master, unifying the thoughts of the troops to connect with the heavens and meditate on the deity.</p><p>The Wolf Demon, unaware of these intricacies, could no longer continue the meditation and couldn't activate the altar's guardian deity at all. He could only passively receive its protection, which was inevitably diminished.</p><p>At the time, the Wolf Demon was only at the late-stage Demon Core realm. Initially, he didn't notice anything amiss and thought he had succeeded. It wasn't until he used the treasure to break through to the Transformation stage that he realized something was wrong. The altar's guardian deity could no longer fully protect him.</p><p>Moreover, as the Wolf Demon's cultivation improved, the protective effects would weaken further.</p><p>For a demon cultivator like him, the chaotic energy was actually more beneficial for refining his demonic body. The most crucial aspect was the altar's guardian deity.</p><p>If he only sought freedom, it would be one thing. As long as he suppressed his ferocious thoughts, he might not descend into madness within his lifetime.</p><p>But this Wolf Demon also had ambitions. As his cultivation deepened, even if there were no immediate signs of trouble, over time, he would inevitably follow the same path as his predecessors.</p><p>Hearing this, Qin Sang fell into deep thought.</p><p>Upon hearing about the meditation technique, he had initially thought it was a form of visualization. In fact, he had encountered such techniques long ago.</p><p>When he first practiced the "Heavenly Demon Body Refinement," he had to visualize a great demon. He had chosen the Azure Phoenix. By cultivating this technique in human form, not only had he developed a pair of thunder wings, but after integrating the Azure Phoenix's essence, he had even manifested a Heavenly Demon Avatar. This showed that visualization techniques were not mere illusions.</p><p>But according to the Wolf Demon, the meditation technique seemed more complex than simple visualization.</p><p>If it were just a visualization technique, once the altar's master perished, the guardian deity would lose its foundation and, even if it continued to exist, would be nothing more than a lifeless object.</p><p>The Wolf Demon, as a Transformation-stage great demon, was not far behind his former master in cultivation, yet he couldn't activate the guardian deity at all.</p><p>From this, it seemed the key lay in the "altar," which must possess unique powers.</p><p>"Heavenly Deities..."</p><p>Qin Sang frowned slightly.</p><p>If there truly were deities in the heavens overseeing the mortal world and ruling the universe, such an important secret would surely have been mentioned by Bai or the Ghost Mother, even if Bai couldn't remember. Yet neither had spoken a word about it.</p><p>It was a pity the Wolf Demon had lost the altar; otherwise, Qin Sang could have studied it.</p><p>However, Qin Sang didn't feel regret. Knowing the key to cultivation in this realm was enough. There would be opportunities to study altars and guardian deities in the future.</p><p>After pondering for a moment, Qin Sang asked, "Who ordered you to plot against the Celestial Pivot Court's immortal official?"</p><p>Knowing the strength of the Dao Court, he had no desire to offend such a behemoth. The Wolf Demon must have had a reason, as he hadn't lost his mind!</p><p>Without hesitation, the Wolf Demon revealed everything.</p><p>After his cultivation breakthrough, he had found his path increasingly difficult. He dared not linger within the Dao Court's jurisdiction and spent his days wandering outside. He had considered going to the Eastern Demon-Ghost Kingdom but was deterred by the long and perilous journey.</p><p>As a rogue cultivator, any Daoist True Person he encountered would immediately capture him.</p><p>After aimless wandering, he had stumbled upon a fortuitous encounter, meeting a Transformation-stage great demon.</p><p>This demon was a snake demon, unaffiliated with any master, who had cultivated on his own. His cultivation was higher than the Wolf Demon's, yet he hadn't been driven mad by the chaotic energy.</p><p>Overjoyed, the Wolf Demon sought his guidance. The snake demon didn't hide the fact that he practiced a demonic altar technique passed down from the Demon-Ghost Kingdom. He could teach it to the Wolf Demon but demanded that he capture an immortal official of the Dao Court, at least a sub-altar master, as payment.</p><p>Killing a Dao Court immortal official was a heinous crime, especially a sub-altar master.</p><p>However, the Wolf Demon, having already betrayed a True Person and offended the Danxiao Prefecture, and with his own cultivation path at stake, had little regard for such consequences. After a brief hesitation, he agreed.</p><p>Being cunning by nature, the Wolf Demon carefully scouted and chose this location, targeting a newly appointed altar master who lacked experience. Unfortunately, the other party proved more skilled, and the Wolf Demon lost both his altar and his troops.</p><p>Hearing this, Qin Sang's expression shifted slightly. "A demonic altar?"</p><p>So, altars weren't exclusive to the Daoist sects.</p><p>This realm also had a Demon-Ghost Kingdom, which, being able to form a kingdom, suggested some level of order. Moreover, it could rival the Dao Court, indicating formidable strength.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered.</p><p>He urgently needed to accomplish two things.</p><p>First, he needed a method to stabilize his spiritual energy, allowing him to cultivate in this realm.</p><p>Second, he needed to confirm that using chaotic energy to refine his body wouldn't have any adverse effects beyond his soul.</p><p>The divine path was unclear.</p><p>Since he had seen hope in the Daoist altar system, he wouldn't consider the divine path unless absolutely necessary.</p><p>For him, the altar's guardian deity wasn't essential, but as a Soul Formation cultivator, he needed a high-grade altar to protect his cultivation.</p><p>From what he understood of the Dao Court, its hierarchy was strict and well-defined, leaving little room for exploitation.</p><p>The entire Dao Court was interconnected. If he used unconventional methods, it wouldn't be surprising if he attracted the attention of a Grand True Person.</p><p>While low-grade altars might be easier to obtain through deception, high-grade altars, whether from Daoist sects or the Dao Court, wouldn't be granted lightly. If he faced a Grand True Person or even a True Monarch, he would have nowhere to hide.</p><p>Qin Sang had considered approaching the local powers directly, revealing his origins, provided the cultivators of this realm weren't overwhelmingly powerful, and Soul Formation cultivators held significant influence, making them likely to recruit him.</p><p>Given the strength displayed by the Dao Court, Soul Formation cultivators, while not weak, weren't overly esteemed.</p><p>Moreover, his current strength was far from what it once was.</p><p>If they probed too deeply, he would have no defense, and the Heavenly Phoenix Feather, crucial for the Vermilion Bird's revival and his own cultivation, might be exposed. He couldn't afford to lose it.</p><p>Qin Sang was struggling to find a way out when the Wolf Demon mentioned the demonic altar, sparking an idea.</p><p>If the demonic altar could also stabilize spiritual energy, he would need to be cautious. If it only protected the soul, he could safely use chaotic energy to refine his body and quickly enhance his strength.</p><p>By focusing on body refinement first and gradually exploring, he would be in a better position once the "Heavenly Demon Body Refinement" broke through.</p><p>Additionally, through the demonic altar, he might gain some insight into the mysteries of the Daoist altars.</p><p>As these thoughts flashed through his mind, Qin Sang didn't act rashly. He keenly noticed a suspicious point. "The snake demon's lair is in the western extremity of the Dao Court's jurisdiction, thousands of miles from the Demon-Ghost Kingdom. How did the snake demon obtain the demonic altar technique?"</p><p>According to the Wolf Demon, the Nine Dragons Kingdom, where they were located, was in the southwestern part of the Zhongmao Prefecture. Traveling westward along the coast and crossing a sub-altar's territory would lead to the western extremity of the Zhongmao Prefecture.</p><p>That area was beyond the Dao Court's control, a chaotic land of demons and ghosts, but they were disorganized. The Demon-Ghost Kingdom was located in the eastern extremity of this realm, separated from the western extremity by two Dao Court prefectures. Under normal circumstances, the technique shouldn't have spread here.</p><p>The snake demon was hidden deep within.</p><p>"This is also my confusion. But at the time, I was desperate and afraid of angering the snake demon, so I didn't dare ask too much. Perhaps... perhaps..."</p><p>The Wolf Demon scratched his head, then his eyes lit up. "Perhaps a powerful figure from my kind has established a lineage here to counter the Dao Court!"</p><p>He became more convinced as he spoke.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded slightly, deep in thought.</p><p>Having made his decision, Qin Sang didn't hesitate. He immediately ordered the Wolf Demon to lead the way. The two traveled westward along the coast for over a month without incident, eventually arriving at a vast mountain range.</p><p>"Immortal, the place where I encountered the snake is just ahead. Although I've only seen the snake demon twice, I could tell he was extremely cautious. He usually only communicated with me through shadow projections and voice transmissions. I don't know where his true body is hidden. We need a foolproof plan to avoid alerting him and letting him escape."</p><p>The Wolf Demon stood on his hind legs, deliberately bowing beside Qin Sang, speaking in a fawning tone as he offered advice.</p><p>Qin Sang stood atop a mountain peak, scanning the surrounding peaks, remaining silent.</p><p>Once they left the Dao Court's jurisdiction, he had noticed that the Six Heavens' Ancient Qi was more rampant outside, growing stronger the further they traveled. He had to use more spiritual sense to stabilize his true essence.</p><p>Thinking of the Dao Court's establishment of altars, sub-altars, and main altars, Qin Sang felt there must be a reason, though he wasn't sure what role the deities played.</p><p>At that moment, sharp howls and the sounds of pursuit echoed from the foot of the mountain.</p><p>Qin Sang had already noticed the commotion but only now turned his gaze downward.</p><p>The trees at the mountain's base swayed, and the sound of breaking branches and rustling leaves filled the air.</p><p>A white figure leaped and darted through the branches. Upon closer inspection, it was a white rabbit, as large as a wolfhound, occasionally glancing back with panic in its eyes. It was clearly a rabbit demon.</p><p>Chasing it was a humanoid figure, towering over ten feet tall, with bulging muscles and a robust build, moving with the speed of the wind.</p><p>This person's hands were larger than palm leaves, possessing immense strength. A single slap could shatter a tree. The rabbit demon was no match, chased to the point of having no escape.</p><p>"Immortal, that's a Ghost Person."</p><p>The Wolf Demon peeked over and pointed at the figure, proactively explaining to Qin Sang.</p><p>Although the humanoid figure had the upper hand and killing the rabbit demon was only a matter of time, Qin Sang felt a sense of heaviness.</p><p>This Ghost Person would undoubtedly be considered a giant in the mortal world. His features and limbs resembled those of a human, but no one would mistake him for one.</p><p>Yet, the truth was that Ghost People were indeed humans!</p><p>The reason was simple: Ghost People lived perpetually in the Six Heavens' Ancient Qi, without the Dao Court's protection, and had undergone drastic changes.</p><p>Ghost People had bodies as tough as iron and immense strength, far surpassing ordinary humans, but at the cost of impaired intellect.</p><p>The animalistic nature of this Ghost Person was evident.</p><p>At that moment, the rabbit demon was cornered at a cliff face. Knowing death was inevitable, a ferocious glint appeared in its eyes. It suddenly turned, exhaling a foul wind from its mouth and nose, its sharp teeth turning blood-red as it lunged to bite.</p><p>The Ghost Person, instead of being alarmed, let out a delighted cry. Without dodging, he threw a punch, striking the rabbit demon's throat with precision.</p><p>A crisp sound of bones breaking echoed, and the rabbit demon let out a shrill cry. The pain triggered its survival instinct, and it tried to flee, but the Ghost Person grabbed its neck and crushed it with a single squeeze, silencing it forever.</p><p>Blood gushed from the rabbit demon's neck. The Ghost Person lifted the corpse, drinking deeply from the wound. Satisfied, he dragged the body toward a hidden valley.</p><p>Inside the valley was a cave, sealed with a large rock. The Ghost Person knocked a few times, and the rock was pushed open from within, allowing him and his prey to enter before slamming shut again.</p><p>Qin Sang observed everything. Ghost People had lived here for generations, battling countless demons and ghosts, undergoing a transformation. Even if they returned to the Dao Court, it would take generations to gradually revert to normal.</p><p>In fact, the Dao Court didn't reject Ghost People. Some Dao Court members even ventured out specifically to find and escort them back.</p><p>Qin Sang, however, had his own troubles and no extra concern for others. He turned his gaze away and said to the Wolf Demon, "You may go. I have my own plans."</p><p>The Wolf Demon was momentarily stunned. He had expected Qin Sang to use some method to control him, but instead, he was being allowed to lure the snake demon out.</p><p>The Wolf Demon secretly checked his body but found nothing amiss. Deciding not to overthink it, he bowed to Qin Sang and leaped off the cliff, disappearing into a forest.</p><p>At that moment, a butterfly perched on his shoulder, its wings fluttering with his movements, unnoticed by the Wolf Demon.</p><p>Qin Sang stood with his hands behind his back, a faint smile on his lips. Concealment was the natural ability of the Heavenly Eye Butterfly. Even a Soul Formation cultivator might overlook it if not paying close attention, let alone a Transformation-stage demon king.</p><p>Qin Sang lightly tapped his foot, following at a leisurely pace. Soon, he found a cave and stopped, taking out the Dao Comprehension Tree, deep in thought.</p><p>Unaware of Qin Sang's methods, the Wolf Demon remained anxious. However, he was skilled at deception and quickly made his way to a secluded altar. He took out a fang and drew three circles clockwise and three counterclockwise in the water.</p><p>With a splash, a stream of water rose from the pool, forming a seven-foot-long brocade snake. It cautiously surveyed its surroundings before turning to the Wolf Demon, sensing his cultivation, and spoke in a cold tone, "You failed!"</p><p>(End of Chapter)</p>
