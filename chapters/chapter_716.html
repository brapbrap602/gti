Chapter 708: Coldflame

It seemed as if something had exploded.

Qin Sang's heart skipped a beat, a tightness in his chest. His escape light flickered, then stabilized. He looked back in astonishment. 
Such a massive disturbance, even a late-stage Core Formation demon couldn't create!

Moreover, following the massive sound, a demon's enraged roar echoed, filled with intense pain.
The setting sun cast a lingering glow, the sky already darkening.
On the eastern sea, a tiny, crystal-blue light appeared, remarkably conspicuous where the water met the sky.
The blue light intensified and expanded, then suddenly erupted.
In an instant, a blinding blue light illuminated the area like daylight. Qin Sang was forced to squint, but he stared unblinkingly at the mass of light.
A slender blue ray shot out from the light, piercing the heavens!
A sliver of the moon hung in the sky, and the ray seemed to streak directly towards it.
At this moment, Qin Sang felt the surroundings grow even darker. His jaw dropped, and he couldn't close it for a long time.
Giant waves surged, the entire sea trembling.
Soon, the ray weakened and slowly receded. Sparkling remnants drifted down like starlight, dissipating in the wind like fireworks from a past life, a captivating sight.
Qin Sang finally saw clearly: the blue light's source was some kind of blue spiritual fire, and those sparks were individual flames.
"Could it be spiritual fire hidden deep within the cavern?  The spiritual fire was undisturbed in the depths, showing no signs. How could it suddenly erupt?  Either the demon accidentally triggered a restriction in the cavern, or those cultivators did something, intentionally releasing the fire. Leaving early was wise; the cavern definitely holds more than just a Nascent Soul cultivator's cave..."
Qin Sang swallowed, secretly alarmed and grateful.

He gazed at the spiritual fire. After the eruption, a blue glow still lingered in the eastern night sky and over the sea. The fire had shrunk back to its original size but continued to violently fluctuate, expanding and contracting restlessly.  Clearly, it was extremely volatile, not as beautiful as it appeared.
Then Qin Sang noticed a layer of ice on the sea surface around the fire. He saw waves freeze mid-surge, transforming into icy mounds.
The sea breeze from that direction became a biting, icy wind.
"Freezing the sea surface, affecting such a vast area, what terrifying power!  So my previous guess was correct; the spiritual fire must be a Coldflame.  The cold mist is related to it, carrying its aura, which is why the Nine Yin Devilfire reacted."
Qin Sang muttered to himself, comparing the Coldflame to the ancestral sacred fire of the Green Sun Demonic Sect in his mind.
Of the spiritual fires he'd seen, the Nine Yin Devilfire was sealed within a magical treasure, and the Southern Bright Flame was only a fraction of a demon's fire power, its true form said to be small. He hadn't seen its true form with his own eyes.
Only the ancestral sacred fire, dancing freely atop Divine罡 Peak, had he seen clearly.
Because of the distance, he couldn't accurately sense the Coldflame's aura, but judging by the eruption's intensity, it was likely comparable to the ancestral sacred fire.
This meant the Coldflame possessed the astonishing power of at least Nascent Soul level!
"Did Winter冥 establish his cave here to subdue this Coldflame? He suddenly disappeared, unable to retrieve his treasures. Could it be that something went wrong while subduing the Coldflame, he suffered backlash, and died inside?"
Knowing so little, he could only speculate wildly.

Qin Sang hovered in midair, gazing towards the Coldflame.
"Besides that scream, the demon hasn't made any other sound, nor have I seen any cultivators. Could they all have perished in the eruption?"
Qin Sang hesitated, unsure if the Coldflame had truly settled. If another eruption occurred as he approached, he'd be caught in it as well.
But the Coldflame tempted him.
Back then, Patriarch Kui Yin had subdued the Nine Yin Devilfire and refined it into the Ten Yama Banners, shaking the Small Cold Region.
After learning about the Nine Yin Devilfire and the Ten Yama Banners, Qin Sang was deeply envious and had always hoped to emulate Patriarch Kui Yin, subduing a spiritual fire himself.
If he could control the Coldflame, his power would instantly leap to unimaginable heights.
Qin Sang was uncertain if he could contend with a Nascent Soul cultivator with the Coldflame, but he could confidently proclaim himself the strongest below the Nascent Soul realm.
Could a Core Formation cultivator like himself possibly control such a terrifying Coldflame?
Qin Sang had no confidence. Patriarch Kui Yin's method of subduing the devilfire was difficult to replicate. He had happened upon a treasure that could restrain the Nine Yin Devilfire and, even with his cultivation, it took him over a hundred years to fully understand and devise a method to exploit it.
Let alone finding a treasure that could restrain the Coldflame, even if he did, Qin Sang wasn't confident he could refine a treasure comparable to the Ten Yama Banners.
"A quick look, just to see, shouldn't be a problem. Even if I can't subdue it now, I might find a way later. The spiritual fire is hidden here, unlikely to be discovered by other cultivators..."
With this thought, Qin Sang's figure flashed, turning back towards the path he came from.
Unexpectedly, before he'd flown far, still some distance from the Coldflame, Qin Sang's expression changed abruptly, and he stopped.
His eyes, sharp as lightning, scanned the area and fixed on a spot on the ice.
A faint cracking sound emanated from there, growing louder. Then, the ice suddenly exploded, sending ice shards flying. A massive figure emerged.
The demon wasn't dead!

Qin Sang was startled and was about to retreat, but he noticed something strange: the demon's body was much smaller than before.
Upon closer inspection, the demon's lower half was gone, almost as if it had been cut in half at the waist. Even the remaining upper body was covered in wounds, its flesh mangled.
Bloody icicles erupted from the wounds, falling onto the sea surface and staining the water red.
'Roar!'
The demon roared after freeing itself.
Despite such grievous injuries, it was still alive, but its aura was much weaker. It glanced fearfully at the Coldflame, then its upper body swung around, and it fled without hesitation, returning to its lair.

Seeing this, Qin Sang's eyes flickered.
Aside from the demon, no one else was in sight. Judging by the demon's惨状, the Coldflame's eruptive power was unimaginable. The chances of others surviving were slim.
Unable to subdue the Coldflame, obtaining a late-stage Core Formation demon core would still be a tremendous gain.
Although the demon appeared severely injured, its strength shouldn't be underestimated. Qin Sang quickly assessed his own power and decided to give it a try.
With that, he turned without hesitation and pursued the demon.
The Blood Defilement Divine Light technique wasn't very effective against demonic beasts, so Qin Sang didn't summon his Ebony Sword.  He opened his palm, and three Ten Yama Banners slid silently into his grasp.
At the same time, two Flying Nightmares stood ready.
Battling a demonic beast at sea allowed for no carelessness.
