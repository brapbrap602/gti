<h1>Chapter 1782: The Thunder Jade Mansion</h1><p>A spirit armor enveloped him.</p><p>Qin Sang chanted an incantation, activating the armor. He raised his left arm while simultaneously silently forming a Demon-crushing Seal with his right hand.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The instant the Demon-crushing Seal struck the arm armor, the armor's texture vanished, transforming into rippling, dark water.</p><p>Qin Sang, of course, couldn't actually injure himself, nor did he use his Spirit Wood body.  However, he still used about sixty percent of his strength.</p><p>The Returning Wind Armor brought him a great surprise.</p><p>The rippling dark water resembled an unfathomable abyss. The power of the Demon-crushing Seal was almost entirely blocked and absorbed by the fragments of the true treasure, leaving his left arm unharmed.</p><p>“How is it?  I told you, when the true treasure was intact, it was likely a supreme defensive treasure!”</p><p>Master Qi stroked his beard, a triumphant smile spreading across his face.  He then sighed, “I wonder what kind of powerful cultivator could shatter such a treasure!”</p><p>The Returning Wind Armor wasn’t a complete success, falling short of their expectations.</p><p>Yet, even Master Qi, who had once refined a pseudo-spiritual treasure, still considered it his greatest achievement in his life!</p><p>Most importantly, he had a sudden epiphany at the last moment.</p><p>After digesting this gain, he would undoubtedly reach a higher realm in the art of refining.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded in agreement.</p><p>The Returning Wind Armor hadn't reached its limit, but Qin Sang didn't intend to continue testing it in front of Master Qi.</p><p>He was certain that this armor could protect him in a battle against a Nascent Soul cultivator. The only drawback was that the area protected by the true treasure fragments wasn't large enough.</p><p>If he encountered a devastating divine power, the true treasure fragments might withstand it, but the armor itself might not be able to endure.</p><p>Seeing Master Qi's reluctant expression, Qin Sang smiled, handed back the Returning Wind Armor, and remained at Master Qi’s mansion.</p><p>Observing Master Qi’s refinement process had yielded considerable benefits, and he urgently needed to close himself off for cultivation.</p><p>Each improvement Qin Sang made in the art of refining benefited the nurturing of the spiritual fetus within the Yunyou Sword.</p><p>…</p><p>On the water surface not far from Sword Heart Island, Qin Sang flew slowly, his fingers wrapped around a circling line of fire.</p><p>Upon closer inspection, it was a centipede, crawling on his hand.</p><p>After the protective formation's completion, Qin Sang continued to cultivate his inner true essence. Now that his protective inner true essence could barely protect the Fire Jade Centipede, Qin Sang awakened it.</p><p>The Fire Jade Centipede was still at the mid-fourth transformation stage.</p><p>However, Qin Sang could sense that its aura was stirring. If it weren't for the influence of the Six Heavens' Ancient Qi, it would have likely broken through already.</p><p>Late-fourth transformation spirit insects weren’t weak; each possessed life-saving abilities. However, their capabilities were not as comprehensive as human cultivators.</p><p>In the future, when encountering opportunities, he could safely let the Fire Jade Centipede search for treasures in most places.</p><p>There were still leftover fire spirits captured from the Flowing Fire Illusionary Pool of the Wuxiang Immortal Sect, as well as many spirit pills left uneaten by the Sky Eye Butterfly. Combined with the insect-controlling techniques taught by the Ghost Mother, it wouldn't be difficult to push the Fire Jade Centipede to its peak fourth transformation stage.</p><p>According to the Ghost Mother, the Fire Jade Centipede's potential could support it reaching the peak of the fourth transformation, and a lucky breakthrough to the fifth transformation would be its limit.</p><p>The Fire Jade Centipede coiled into a ball in his palm, carefree.</p><p>Qin Sang hadn’t yet found a way to cause the Fire Jade Centipede to mutate, so he could only first help it break through.</p><p>“Qingshuang Pill…”</p><p>Qin Sang thought of this medicine. Unfortunately, he had searched for a long time in Star Island Immortal Lake without any news of the Hundred-Knot Bamboo.</p><p>Master Lingxu had promised to keep an eye out for it, so he should write a letter when he had the time.</p><p>Mulling over these thoughts, Sword Heart Island came into view. Qin Sang put away the Fire Jade Centipede and released his aura.</p><p>The island's restrictions flickered once, and the Sword-Wielding Real Person flew before Qin Sang.  “Fellow Daoist, are you ready?”</p><p>Qin Sang bowed slightly.  “Thank you for accompanying me, Fellow Daoist, to visit Real Person Zangui.”</p><p>“I’ve been waiting for news from Fellow Daoist,” the Sword-Wielding Real Person smiled faintly. After saying ‘please wait a moment’, he flew back to Sword Heart Island. A moment later, he returned to the sky, flying alongside Qin Sang towards the north.</p><p>They first arrived at a spirit island with a teleportation array, teleporting to the northern part of Star Island Immortal Lake.</p><p>The islands in the northern part of the lake were as numerous as elsewhere, but as they continued to fly north, Qin Sang noticed the presence of cultivators becoming increasingly sparse, and he even saw large stretches of desolate spirit islands.</p><p>Qin Sang knew that upon reaching the northern shore of Star Island Immortal Lake, they would be at the edge of the Jusan Prefecture.</p><p>Continuing north would lead them into the Nial Plains, a place that made people's hearts turn cold.</p><p>Deep within the Nial Plains, ferocious beasts roamed, far more ferocious and bloodthirsty than the demons of Guifang Kingdom.  They were savage and frenzied.</p><p>Near the Dao Court's two prefectures, there would be celestial guards and earth patrol teams stationed and cleaning up. The Jusan Prefecture, however, was a disorganized mess and couldn't organize such a force.</p><p>The joint efforts of the sects in Star Island Immortal Lake only dispatched some personnel to patrol the area, preventing the beasts from charging into the lake's interior.</p><p>Beasts intruding into the Immortal Lake happened frequently, thus the closer to the northern shore, the more dangerous it was.  Few cultivators dared to set up their caves there.</p><p>This is just the surface danger.  It is said that the deeper one goes into the Vile Origin, the stronger the miasma becomes, and even talismans can't always protect cultivators.  Many cultivators who venture too deep or stay too long become lost.</p><p>Cultivators from Jushan Mountain always set a range and time limit for hunting demonic beasts.  Regardless of their success, they must return by the appointed time.</p><p>"We've arrived."</p><p>The Sword-Wielding Real Person pointed ahead.</p><p>Qin Sang looked intently and saw a towering cliff face, not very wide, forming a small island.  A hundred li north lies the northern shore of Star Island's Celestial Lake.  There were no other cultivators nearby; it was truly peaceful.</p><p>The two flew up and landed on the cliff top.  Before them lay lush greenery.  A light mist shrouded the scene, the shadows of trees danced, and spiritual plants grew densely.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced casually, his gaze tightening slightly.</p><p>Then, a calm voice came from the woods, "Distant guests, welcome, fellow Daoists."</p><p>As the words fell, the ancient trees in front of them swayed and then uprooted themselves.</p><p>*Boom! Boom! Boom!*</p><p>One by one, the ancient trees moved their roots, parting to create a path through the woods.</p><p>"The trees and plants here are all under the command of Real Person Zangui,"</p><p>the Sword-Wielding Real Person explained through voice transmission.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded and walked into the woods beside the Sword-Wielding Real Person, where they saw several ancient wooden halls.  A Daoist priest in a high crown stood before the hall. It was Real Person Zangui, who smiled and greeted them with a bow, "Long time no see, Sword-Wielding Real Person. You are as impressive as ever. My apologies for not welcoming you properly... and who is this Daoist friend?"</p><p>"Greetings, Real Person," the Sword-Wielding Real Person returned the bow, and introduced them.</p><p>As they spoke, they entered the hall and took their seats.</p><p>Upon learning that Qin Sang sought advancement, Real Person Zangui sized him up, nodding in approval. "The friends of the Sword-Wielding Real Person are indeed extraordinary!"</p><p>Qin Sang modestly denied the compliment, about to speak further, when the Sword-Wielding Real Person suddenly rose, saying, "I am merely here to guide you. You two should discuss your business, I should excuse myself."</p><p>The Sword-Wielding Real Person left the hall, leaving only the two of them.</p><p>Real Person Zangui got straight to the point, "What cultivation method do you practice, Real Person Qingfeng?"</p><p>"The Supreme Celestial Thunder Method!"</p><p>Qin Sang didn't hide it; he couldn't have.</p><p>Real Person Zangui looked surprised.  "You aren't an inner disciple of the Thunder Palace?"</p><p>Among cultivators, the Left and Right Thunder Palaces are generally referred to as the Thunder Palace.</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head, "I am an outer disciple, fortunate enough to be taught the Supreme Celestial Thunder Method."</p><p>Real Person Zangui understood.</p><p>The Thunder Palace was extremely renowned in Star Island's Celestial Lake and had ties to the Dao Court.  If Qin Sang were from the Thunder Palace, he would have heard of him already and wouldn't need to come in person; he could have contacted the Dao Court through his sect leader.</p><p>"The third level of the Supreme Celestial Thunder Method is the Five Thunder Secret Technique. Both academies of the Dao Court teach this technique…"</p><p>Real Person Zangui was intimately familiar with various cultivation methods.</p><p>Qin Sang felt relieved. The worst thing about cultivation methods is encountering an incomplete technique, forcing a switch and weakening the cultivator's foundation.</p><p>"However," Real Person Zangui's tone shifted, "the Dao Court can grant you advancement, but it depends on which Thunder God from the Myriad Gods Thunder Department Celestial Guide you choose to enshrine, and whether you succeed; that is something you must explore yourself."</p><p>The enshrined God is the most crucial aspect of a cultivation method. Without guidance from predecessors, cultivators can only try one Thunder God after another from the Myriad Gods Thunder Department Celestial Guide.</p><p>Qin Sang frowned. "What if I can't enshrine a protective God?"</p><p>"You can choose to advance in a different method. To my knowledge, the Nine Lights of Spirit Flight Method could replace the Five Thunder Secret Technique. Of course, if you don't want to change methods, you can temporarily enshrine your inner true essence as a stopgap measure and gradually attempt to enshrine a Thunder God."</p><p>Real Person Zangui paused, "If, even when your primordial spirit shows signs of unrest, you still haven't successfully enshrined a God, you can come to the Dao Court to advance in the Nine Lights of Spirit Flight Method."</p><p>"How long can inner true essence last? What are the conditions for advancement?" Qin Sang seemed very concerned and asked in detail.</p><p>"Before breaking through to the late stage of the Cave Profound Dao Realm, you don't need to worry too much. As for advancement, the Dao Court won't give it to you for free, but they won't make it difficult either," Real Person Zangui said lightly.</p><p>According to Real Person Zangui, using inner true essence for protection could only last until the late stage of the Nascent Soul Realm; no wonder cultivators in this world chose to enshrine Gods.</p><p>Demon cultivators who enshrine inner true essence can still rival the Dao Court, likely due to their inherent demonic bloodline power.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered and said, "The Thunder Palace should have relevant texts, right?"</p><p>Thunder Palace cultivators all practiced the Supreme Celestial Thunder Method.  There were undoubtedly Nascent Soul realm experts who had experience.</p><p>Real Person Zangui shook his head. "You might as well ask the Thunder Palace yourself."</p><p>Hearing this, Qin Sang asked no further.  In fact, whether he could enshrine a God didn't matter much to him. At least until he knew the details of the Gods, he didn't intend to invite one into his body.</p><p>These questions are merely a formality, to avoid arousing Master Zanggui's suspicions.</p><p>"I choose the Five Thunder Secret Technique!" Qin Sang declared firmly.</p><p>Master Zanggui nodded, murmuring, "Since you two are such close friends, Master Zhijian must have explained the rules…"</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, indicating understanding.</p><p>"What is your choice, Master?" Master Zanggui gazed at Qin Sang, his voice low.</p><p>Qin Sang bowed, saying solemnly, "I request a Daoist summons!"</p><p>A request for a summons, not an offer of service to the Daoist court.</p><p>Master Zanggui's eyes showed regret.</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't concealed his aura.  He had already discerned Qin Sang's cultivation level. Those who break through before ascension are exceptionally talented. The Daoist court is eager to recruit such geniuses, but these individuals are invariably proud and arrogant; who would willingly submit to another's control?</p><p>Since the Daoist court controls high-level techniques, why not use them to force compliance, instead of deliberately leaving an opening?</p><p>Master Zanggui had once asked his master, and the answer was that Guifang could also bestow certain high-level Daoist techniques!</p><p>Upon first learning this secret, Master Zanggui was greatly shocked and gained a deeper understanding of Guifang.</p><p>Knowing these people's unwavering resolve, Master Zanggui did not press further. He rose, saying "Please wait a moment," then turned towards the back hall.</p><p>Shortly afterward, Master Zanggui returned, holding two jade slips.  "These two summonses, Master, you may choose one."</p><p>Qin Sang rose and thanked Master Zanggui.</p><p>In this place, there's typically no room for negotiation. The fact that he could choose suggests it was due to Master Zhijian's influence.</p><p>Qin Sang examined one jade slip with his spiritual sense, pondered for a moment, and then checked the other.</p><p>As expected, both summonses involved Guifang, requiring infiltration deep into its territory—sufficiently dangerous, yet not involving truly sensitive information.</p><p>The level of difficulty would depend on Qin Sang's abilities and magical treasures.</p><p>"I choose this one."</p><p>After some consideration, Qin Sang selected the second slip and swore an oath as requested.</p><p>Master Zanggui then released the restrictions on the jade slip, revealing its full content, and handed Qin Sang a porcelain bottle.</p><p>Qin Sang opened the bottle to find a snow-white pill emitting a faint, fragrant aroma—a Tranquility Pill.</p><p>"Master, remember to escape the danger before the pill's effect wears off. Do not be reckless. I await your good news…" Master Zanggui cautioned.</p><p>Qin Sang put away the items and took his leave without delay.</p><p>He had accepted the summons, but was not obligated to act on it.</p><p>Not all predecessors had succeeded. Failure could mean starting over, but there was only one Tranquility Pill.</p><p>Master Zhijian should have news. He would weigh the pros and cons before deciding.</p><p>…</p><p>After seeing Qin Sang off, Master Zanggui paused for a moment before heading to the back hall.</p><p>An old Daoist was seated in the back hall, a half-finished game of Go before him.</p><p>Master Zanggui sat opposite the board, picking up a piece, considering his move.</p><p>The old Daoist, watching the game, said, "Jushan Prefecture has produced another expert, has it?"</p><p>Master Zanggui nodded. "This person took a summons, and cultivates the High Celestial Thunder Technique."</p><p>"What?"</p><p>The old Daoist looked up in surprise. "Not a descendant of the Thunder Palace?"</p><p>Master Zanggui nodded.</p><p>"Interesting," the old Daoist clicked his tongue, shaking his head. "Not cultivating scriptures, only techniques, yet reaching the Xuan level… no ordinary person!  A pity, such a pity…"</p><p>'Snap!'</p><p>Master Zanggui placed a piece, considering it a masterful move, and took a sip from his jade cup. "You're so certain this person will fail?  Could it be that the Right Palace Master's attempt at divine ascension also failed?"</p><p>The old Daoist pointed at Master Zanggui.  "After all these years, your judgment remains as sharp as ever. You miss nothing. Yes, the Right Palace Master gave up.  Generations of disciples from the Thunder Palace have tried, all in vain… Well, perhaps this person has profound good fortune and can succeed, bringing about a turning point."</p><p>Master Zanggui sighed.  "So tragic! So lamentable! In ancient times, the Jade Thunder Palace was on par with our Tianshu Academy and the North Polar Exorcism Academy, perhaps even surpassing them.  The Thunder Marshal's authority was so formidable, they were called the masters of thunder, summoning the Thunder Ancestor, commanding all thunder! Just reading the ancient records fills me with excitement, yet now it's fallen to this!"</p><p>"All that is past!"</p><p>The old Daoist shook his head. "The Thunder Gods are silent, few remain. The esteemed High Celestial Thunder Technique, a third-order technique, has no gods to answer its call, and few respond below third-order. Decline is inevitable!"</p><p>Suddenly, the old Daoist picked up a piece and dropped it onto the board, laughing heartily, "Your mind wandered, boy.  Today, old me wins!"</p><p>Master Zanggui was startled and looked at the Go board.</p>
