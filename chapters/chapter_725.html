<h1>Chapter 717: Divided Mind</h1><p>Chapter 717: Divided Mind</p><p>After some thought, Qin Sang had an idea.</p><p>Could he use the Golden Core and the Corpse Pill to simultaneously activate two magic treasures?</p><p>This way, while engaging an opponent with one treasure, he could seize the opportunity to unexpectedly unleash the other, surely throwing them into disarray.</p><p>Thinking this, Qin Sang began a long process of experimentation.</p><p>Simultaneously activating two magic treasures wasn't simply a matter of multitasking; it was an immense test of a cultivator's spiritual sense and true essence.</p><p>The Corpse Pill contained abundant true essence, but the difficulty lay in Qin Sang's ability to prevent conflict between the two streams of true essence after unsealing the Corpse Pill, allowing them to coexist harmoniously and avoid chaos when activating the treasures.</p><p>Initially, Qin Sang was clueless.</p><p>After unsealing the Corpse Pill, any attempt to simultaneously activate both true essences turned his dantian and meridians into a battlefield.  The worst incident nearly resulted in serious injury to his dantian.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't give up. He made various attempts, undergoing an incredibly long experimental process, and finally found a breakthrough, a glimmer of hope.</p><p>He discovered that to simultaneously activate both true essences, his spiritual sense had to be strong enough.  The biggest limitation now seemed to be his spiritual sense.</p><p>Although cultivating the "Chapter of Soul Cultivation and Sword Nurturing," Qin Sang's spiritual sense was superior to that of cultivators at the same level, it still wasn't enough.</p><p>Moreover, the spiritual sense impacted more than just the true essence; activating two treasures demanded an even higher level of spiritual sense.</p><p>Overjoyed, Qin Sang devoted more energy, setting aside some cultivation time to select from the methods of refining spiritual sense he had obtained, trying them one by one. Unfortunately, these methods were not very profound, and their effects weren't significant.</p><p>Even so, as time passed, he was finally able to make the two true essences coexist within his body!</p><p>Although he couldn't fuse the two radically different true essences, this was enough to exhilarate Qin Sang. He immediately began trying to activate two treasures simultaneously.</p><p>By now, he had made some progress.</p><p>When he used the Ebony Sword to besiege the two-headed sea monster, Qin Sang had already prepared the Ten Directions Yama Banner.</p><p>He couldn't yet simultaneously activate two treasures to engage an enemy, but while using the Ebony Sword, he could silently deploy the Ten Directions Yama Banner and unleash it instantly.</p><p>Previously, this required some preparation time, leaving him vulnerable to attack.</p><p>It was thanks to this ability that Qin Sang had been waiting for the opportunity, pushing the two-headed sea monster to the brink of death. He immediately deployed the magic banner, and the Nine Nether Demon Fire instantly engulfed Qingxia and the monster's core.</p><p>Sensing the Nine Nether Demon Fire's aura,</p><p>the two-headed sea monster became frantic.</p><p>Whatever could make a creature with a death wish feel uneasy must be an even more terrible fate.</p><p>It tried to self-destruct its core, but it was too late. The Nine Nether Demon Fire easily pierced Qingxia, assaulting the core, which instantly dimmed.</p><p>With the demon fire directly assaulting its core, the two-headed sea monster screamed. Qingjiao and the Flying Sky Rakshasa seized the opportunity, attacking from both sides without mercy.</p><p>Shrill cries echoed amidst the waves.</p><p>When the waters calmed, the two-headed sea monster was pinned to the surface, its neck held down, its body covered in wounds.  It still breathed, not yet dead, but it remained defiant, its two heads stubbornly raised, glaring at Qin Sang, as if wishing to devour its enemy.</p><p>Qin Sang flashed, appearing before the two-headed sea monster.</p><p>At that moment, a wave crested, and Qingjiao swam to Qin Sang's feet, looking at him anxiously.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at Qingjiao, struck his dantian, and a clear chime echoed.  Then, the sun ring on Qingjiao's neck trembled slightly and fell off, flying back into Qin Sang's palm.</p><p>Qingjiao shook its head, sensing the removal of the restraint.</p><p>It was incredulous.  The yoke it had thought it would wear for life had been so easily undone?</p><p>Qingjiao plunged into the deep water, surfacing far away from another part of the sea. Seeing that Qin Sang didn't pursue it, but simply watched it calmly, it finally believed that Qin Sang truly let it go.</p><p>Qingjiao gave Qin Sang a deep look, let out a long cry, showing only its sharp dorsal fin, and gradually disappeared from sight.</p><p>Qin Sang watched Qingjiao leave.</p><p>He spared its life partly because Qingjiao had served him faithfully for so many years, and partly because he'd had a rich harvest lately, so the loss or gain of one more demon core meant little to him.</p><p>The two-headed sea monster, seeing this, immediately understood the effect of the Hun Yuan Tong Xin Ring.</p><p>It struggled violently, but it was at the end of its strength, easily suppressed by the Flying Sky Rakshasa.</p><p>Qin Sang looked around.  The area was calm; no sign of powerful demons.  But he remained uneasy.</p><p>The chase and the battle from last night until now—it might have disturbed some powerful demon.</p><p>He wouldn't stay.  He ordered the flying night-demon to seize the two-headed creature and they left quickly.  Finally, they found a calm stretch of sea and stopped to subdue the creature.</p><p>Qin Sang waved his hand. The Yang Ring flew towards the two-headed creature and hovered.</p><p>Meanwhile, Qin Sang sat cross-legged in mid-air, muttering incantations. The Yang Ring shimmered, and ring-shaped projections flew from it and landed on the two-headed creature.</p><p>The two-headed creature suddenly froze, stiff and motionless.</p><p>But the fight had just begun.</p><p>Qin Sang closed his eyes, fully activating his treasure. As more ring projections entered the creature, the two-headed creature struggled wildly, putting Qin Sang on high alert.</p><p>A silent battle raged between them.  The two-headed creature's eyes burned with rage.</p><p>As time passed, its eyes lost some of their ferocity; it showed signs of distraction.</p><p>“If I hadn't deliberately cultivated my spiritual sense, I might not have been able to subdue this beast!”</p><p>Qin Sang thought, opening his eyes to see the dazed two-headed creature. He smiled slightly, and shouted, “Fall!”</p><p>The Yang Ring shook, and without warning fell onto the two-headed creature.</p><p>Instantly, the two-headed creature's struggles ceased. It lay still on the surface of the water.</p><p>Qin Sang summoned the flying night-demon back into his corpse puppet bag. He approached the two-headed creature and found it unconscious—exhausted, heavily wounded, and affected by the Hun Yuan Tong Xin Ring.</p><p>After checking the creature, Qin Sang took out a spirit pill and gave it to the two-headed creature. Then, with a thought, the Yang Ring emitted a white light.</p><p>The next moment, the two-headed creature disappeared, replaced by a slender bracelet on Qin Sang's wrist.</p><p>The two-headed creature was heavily injured, but Qin Sang had plenty of pills left. With some rest, it would recover.</p><p>He would soon have a powerful mount!</p><p>Even Qin Sang, known for his composure, couldn't help but smile. He shook his wrist, then soared into the air, choosing a direction and flying away.</p>
