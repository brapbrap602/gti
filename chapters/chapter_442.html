<h1>Chapter 435: One Sword</h1><p>The people on the black-canopied boat, seeing the flying cultivator, exerted all their strength, increasing the boat's speed.</p><p>Just then, from the center of the violet glow, a 'bang' suddenly echoed, as if something had shattered.</p><p>Countless violet rays shot out in all directions, and the glow quickly dissipated.</p><p>The violet bottle had been forcibly destroyed by the Ninefire Divine Blade!</p><p>Though not completely destroyed itself, the Ninefire Divine Blade's luster dimmed considerably. Fine cracks appeared on its surface, and of the nine fire dragons that encircled it, six had vanished, leaving only three, each with a faint aura and dissipating form.</p><p>"Go!" Mu Yifeng roared.</p><p>Crimson light surged from the Ninefire Divine Blade, pouring into the remaining three fire dragons.</p><p>Like a final burst of brilliance, the three dragons' auras swelled rapidly. Then, their bodies intertwined and lunged at their opponent with astonishing speed.</p><p>The Heavenly Alliance cultivator, caught off guard by the power of Mu Yifeng's weapon, his face filled with shock, retreated frantically, barely managing to disperse the fire dragons with a flurry of techniques.</p><p>Mu Yifeng seized the opportunity, retrieving the Ninefire Divine Blade and fleeing into the distance.</p><p>The distance between them, already close, now widened significantly.</p><p>"Let's see where you can run!"</p><p>Infuriated, a grim smile spread across the Heavenly Alliance cultivator's face.  Without waiting to recover, he propelled himself forward, continuing his relentless pursuit.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang made his move.</p><p>Still hidden underwater, he employed a water遁 technique, concealing his presence while maintaining a swift pace.</p><p>No one noticed Qin Sang. Firstly, he was cautious and still quite far away. Secondly, both Mu Yifeng's pursuer and the people on the black-canopied boat were preoccupied with the fight.</p><p>Qin Sang's target was the direction of Mu Yifeng's escape.</p><p>As he sped through the water, he mentally calculated the distance between them.</p><p>The black-canopied boat lagged far behind, and Mu Yifeng, at the cost of overexerting his Ninefire Divine Blade, had put considerable distance between himself and his pursuer, making it difficult for him to catch up in the short term.</p><p>As long as Mu Yifeng didn't give up or change direction, Qin Sang was certain he could make it in time.</p><p>As he raced forward, Qin Sang's eyes flickered, strategizing.</p><p>The vast expanse of water was devoid of birds, fish, or any sign of life.</p><p>Between the water and the sky, two streaks of light pierced the tranquility.</p><p>On the surface, the black-canopied boat cut through the waves, its momentum fierce.</p><p>Below, a figure moved stealthily through the depths.</p><p>Mu Yifeng glanced back at his relentless pursuer, a faint, bitter smile on his face. The spiritual power in his sea of Qi was almost depleted, and soon he would be completely drained.</p><p>He had sacrificed a weapon that had been with him for decades, yet he still hadn't managed to kill his opponent.</p><p>But even if he had, what then?</p><p>He couldn't escape the pursuit of the treasure ship.</p><p>What a pity, he hadn't even glimpsed the realm beyond Gold Core.</p><p>Regret flashed in Mu Yifeng's eyes. He looked down at the Ninefire Divine Blade in his hand. This veteran, which had accompanied him in countless battles since his Foundation Establishment stage, was now dim and cracked.</p><p>Although not completely destroyed, it would need at least several years of nurturing to recover.</p><p>Mu Yifeng tightened his grip, feeling the familiar aura of the Ninefire Divine Blade, his heart seeming to settle.</p><p>For a cultivator like him, dedicated to the pursuit of the Dao, this divine blade was his only solace.</p><p>"Don't worry, I'll take you with me. I won't leave you in the hands of those thieves," Mu Yifeng murmured, looking at the Ninefire Divine Blade.</p><p>He had already decided to end his own life. Falling into enemy hands was worse than a swift end.</p><p>Just then, Mu Yifeng suddenly heard a faint whisper.</p><p>"Senior Brother Mu…"</p><p>Mu Yifeng, his face full of doubt, looked at the endless expanse of water ahead, thinking he was hallucinating in his dying moments. But then a clearer voice followed.</p><p>"Senior Brother Mu… It's me… It's Qin Sang!"</p><p>A flash of lightning struck Mu Yifeng's mind. He suddenly remembered someone and was overjoyed. However, his vast experience immediately alerted him that Qin Sang must be hidden, so he maintained his speed and gaze.</p><p>"Senior Brother Mu, I'm underwater…"</p><p>By now, Qin Sang had reached a position ahead of Mu Yifeng, lurking below the surface.  Fully activating the *Escaping Spirit Art*, he contacted Mu Yifeng secretly.</p><p>Time was of the essence, and he spoke rapidly, "Senior Brother Mu, how many experts are on the boat?"</p><p>"Junior Brother Qin, are you alone?"</p><p>Mu Yifeng immediately realized something, and the joy on his face was instantly replaced by deep disappointment. He remembered Qin Sang's cultivation level, which was far inferior to his own the last time they met.</p><p>Even if Qin Sang had some miraculous encounter, he would at most be at the early stage of Core Formation.</p><p>Adding a spent force like himself, if exposed, the only outcome would be their mutual demise.</p><p>Hearing Qin Sang's question, Mu Yifeng, without time to consider why Qin Sang was there, hurriedly transmitted a warning, "Junior Brother Qin, don't reveal yourself! There are two Core Formation experts on the boat. Don't let them find you…"</p><p>Upon hearing this, Qin Sang had a clear understanding of the situation.</p><p>In fact, before acting, he had already guessed as much.</p><p>The people on the black-canopied boat, no matter how powerful, couldn't possibly have a Nascent Soul cultivator. Otherwise, crushing Mu Yifeng would be as easy as crushing an ant. Why would they tolerate him escaping for so long?</p><p>But just in case, he didn't act rashly, choosing to first contact Mu Yifeng and inquire about the opponent's strength.</p><p>Saving someone was one thing, but sacrificing himself was another.</p><p>Mu Yifeng, with his extremely fast escape technique, sped past, receiving no further response from Qin Sang. A mix of emotions churned within him, and he sighed inwardly.</p><p>Suddenly, a thunderous boom erupted from behind.</p><p>A bolt from the blue!</p><p>Mu Yifeng was startled. He turned to see a flash of lightning tear through the calm water's surface.</p><p>A sword beam shot out of the water at an unbelievable speed, like thunder and lightning, soaring into the sky.</p><p>At that moment, the Heavenly Alliance cultivator happened to be flying overhead.</p><p>Qin Sang's timing was impeccable. In an instant, the Ebony Sword, transformed into a bolt of lightning, reached the cultivator.</p><p>This attack was completely unexpected.</p><p>The cultivator, whose protective artifact had been destroyed by Mu Yifeng, was filled with rage.  His entire focus was on Mu Yifeng, pouring all his energy into the chase. Facing the sudden attack of the Ebony Sword, he had no time to react.</p><p>Furthermore, the sword's thunderous aura was a shocking and unparalleled divine ability. Once the divine sword appeared, thunder followed, its speed far exceeding imagination.</p><p>Even if the cultivator hadn't been distracted, at such close range and under Qin Sang's deliberate sneak attack, he would have met the same fate.</p><p>By the time he noticed the Ebony Sword inches away, the deafening roar of thunder had just reached his ears.</p><p>"Ambush!"</p><p>The thought barely registered in the cultivator's mind before his senses were overwhelmed by the deafening thunder. Then he felt a chill below, and lost consciousness.</p><p>*Splash!*</p><p>Blood splattered across the sky.</p><p>The bisected body, its momentum unchecked, flew forward a considerable distance before separating.</p><p>The scene was horrifying.</p><p>Having slain its enemy with a single strike, the Ebony Sword was retrieved by Qin Sang, who vanished without a trace.</p>
