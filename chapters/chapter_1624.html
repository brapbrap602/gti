<h1>Chapter 1615:  Whispers</h1><p>Jinyuzhou.</p><p>The Qinghu Saint King showed little interest in the human cultivator's assembly. After learning of the beast attacks, he forcibly brought the Huiguang Saint to the storm zone and had just returned.</p><p>Before them lay a giant map, primarily of northern Zhongzhou, with most markings in the storm zone outside the barrier.</p><p>“Information gathered by the Zen Temple over the years shows that over 80% of the beasts appeared in the north of Zhongzhou,” Huiguang Saint gestured, circling an area on the map.</p><p>Qinghu Saint King seemed distracted.</p><p>“At midnight last night, did you sense a strange whisper within the Heavenly Dao's incantation?”</p><p>Huiguang Saint's expression stiffened slightly.</p><p>“You heard it too.”</p><p>Qinghu Saint King sighed, “Though the whisper was extremely brief, I don't believe it was a hallucination.  Before, we could attribute the Heavenly Dao's incantation to changes in the Dao, but what about this whisper? Could someone be corrupting the Heavenly Dao itself?”</p><p>Huiguang Saint remained silent for a long time, then said, “It may not be a person, perhaps still a Heavenly Dao anomaly, creating an illusion of a whisper. That sound clearly lacked reason; its meaning is unclear.”</p><p>“Whatever is behind it, it's not a good sign.”</p><p>Qinghu Saint King asked, “Whether it has meaning or not, we'll only know after trying to communicate. Only you and I can perceive the Heavenly Dao's incantation in this world.  Old Monk, do you dare to actively communicate with it?”</p><p>“We'll most likely receive no response. The whisper, like the Heavenly Dao's incantation, is filled with boundless madness.”</p><p>Huiguang Saint didn't explain this deduction.</p><p>Qinghu Saint King added, “Directly perceiving the whisper might accelerate the speed at which we are consumed by madness, shaking our foundations, and even attracting great terror.”</p><p>This was the most fatal consequence.</p><p>“What is wrong with this world?”</p><p>Qinghu Saint King couldn't help but sigh.</p><p>When the nest falls, the eggs break.</p><p>This world's Heavenly Dao is undergoing changes. First came the incantation, then the whisper. What comes next?  If we are pessimistic, one day, those affected by the incantation may no longer be limited to those with profound cultivation, and the madness will spread to all living beings.</p><p>If this small world is heading towards destruction, billions of lives will be sacrificed!</p><p>Qinghu Saint King and Huiguang Saint were among the most reluctant to accept this.</p><p>They had already reached the pinnacle of this world.  All they needed to do was diligently cultivate, accumulate sufficient power, and then cross to Guihu, pass through the Dao Marker Gate, and escape this cage.</p><p>Just as they were about to transcend, they encountered such an unheard-of strange event, leaving them helpless despite their divine abilities.</p><p>Below immortals, all are ants.</p><p>They had heard this countless times when their cultivation was low and felt it deeply.</p><p>As their cultivation improved and their status rose, they could take whatever they wanted in this world and control life and death.  They had long forgotten the feeling of being an 'ant'.</p><p>Huiguang Saint couldn't answer.</p><p>Their gazes fell back on the map.</p><p>Qinghu Saint King said, “The frequency of beast attacks is clearly lower than at the beginning. We must capture the next beast that passes through. I don't want to wait another few hundred years!”</p><p>Huiguang Saint said, “Even if it's a beast whose cultivation is comparable to ours, capturing it alive will be extremely difficult.  Beasts know no fear.  Instead of surrendering when injured, they will become even more ferocious. We must be fully prepared.”</p><p>“My Guardian Palace Formation, half of whose flags are ancient immortal flags, combined with the Vajra Subduing Demon Formation you personally preside over, gives us a significant chance of success. However, to lure the beast into the formation step by step, we need to plan ahead and start setting up traps from the previously selected location...”</p><p>Qinghu Saint King spoke, tapping several points on the map.</p><p>While the two were discussing hunting the beast...</p><p>The assembly was in full swing.</p><p>Huiguang Saint intended to lure the beast out, not only erasing the memories of cultivators near the Wuwang Hall but also deliberately concealing his actions.  Only a few people, including Master Xingji, knew about the return of the profound cultivators.</p><p>Today, the assembly proceeded to the most exciting part: the martial arts competition.</p><p>The Jinyumen had specially refined a Golden Gate Array.</p><p>Four golden gates, each a thousand meters high, stood in the void, positioned in the east, south, west, and north.</p><p>In the middle of the golden gates, clouds gathered like a sea.</p><p>This was the arena for the cultivators' competition.</p><p>The waves of clouds churned, the vast space large enough for Nascent Soul cultivators to display their magical powers freely.</p><p>Runes flickered on the gate pillars. Jinyumen experts were stationed in each direction, guarding the golden gates and standing by to deal with any emergencies.</p><p>At this moment.</p><p>Around the arena, seats formed of condensed clouds filled all directions, layered and packed tightly.</p><p>The seats were packed with people; almost no space was visible.</p><p>The northern area was relatively sparse, reserved for the seats of the powerful cultivators from various sects.</p><p>Jin Wudai, the Jinyumen sect master, as the host, sat in the middle, pleased with the scene before him.</p><p>The Ganlu Zen Temple and the Eight Scenery Sect were seated on either side, and the other sects took their respective positions.</p><p>Qishen Zhenren of the Eight Scenery Sect disguised himself as the sect leader, Zilei Zhenren.  After arriving in Jinyuzhou, he had mostly stayed indoors and only appeared once at the grand opening ceremony.</p><p>The final distribution of benefits depended on the outcome of this magical duel, so even urgent matters couldn't justify absence today.</p><p>On the dueling platform,</p><p>two figures clashed amidst the clouds.  A man and a woman, Yang Zhenren of the Eight Scenic Views and Yu Zhi, a master from the Golden Jade Gate, were locked in an intense magical battle.</p><p>Yu Zhi, a petite cultivator, possessed skin as delicate as a baby's, seemingly flawless.  She wielded a ten-foot-long red ribbon.</p><p>As the ribbon danced, it emitted a clear, metallic sound.  Embedded within the ribbon were small, gold coins with square holes, and with each movement, golden and red light flickered alternately.  Her movements were fluid and graceful, as if she and the ribbon were one, a captivating sight.</p><p>But this beauty was deceptive.</p><p>Only Yang Zhenren, her opponent, understood the ribbon's true power.  He controlled a thumb-sized jade sword, his life-bound treasure, forged from a rare spiritual jade. It could easily pierce through an opponent's protective energy, making it incredibly powerful.</p><p>Yet, facing Yu Zhi, Yang Zhenren felt increasingly frustrated.</p><p>Hidden within the ribbon's dazzling display were incredibly fine gold threads.  Each time his sword struck, it encountered significant resistance from these threads, greatly weakening its force, allowing Yu Zhi to easily evade his attacks.</p><p>Most troubling was that when the sword neared the threads, they would unexpectedly reverse roles, clinging to the sword like a leech.</p><p>*Pfft!*</p><p>The sword again failed to land a blow.</p><p>Yang Zhenren changed tactics, intending to engage Yu Zhi in a prolonged duel, looking for an opening.</p><p>However, as the sword circled Yu Zhi, it suddenly trembled violently, nearly slipping from his control.</p><p>Yang Zhenren's face turned pale. With a long bellow, he forcefully retracted the sword, putting distance between himself and Yu Zhi, his expression wary.</p><p>Seeing this, Jin Wu Dai showed a satisfied expression, subtly turning his head.  "Observant Master, what is your assessment of the duel between Seventh Sister and Yang Zhenren?"</p><p>"Yu Zhi's 'Golden Thread Jade Control Technique' has reached perfection. Yang Zhenren's life-bound treasure is completely countered. He is about to lose."</p><p>Seventh Sage Zhenren appeared distracted.</p><p>His peripheral vision caught a monk hurrying into the arena, quickly approaching Master Xing Ji.</p><p>---</p><p>---</p><p>Drove home for several hours yesterday afternoon, fell asleep immediately, and didn't wake up until noon. My mother didn't have the heart to wake me…</p><p>I've written two thousand words already, I’ll eat something and continue writing.</p>
