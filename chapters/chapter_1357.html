<h1>Chapter 1349: A Lifetime of Seeking the Dao </h1><p>Under the gaze of the Demonic Elder Ye, Bai obediently activated the final restriction of the Ascension Platform and then took a step back, clearing the path for the elder. </p><p>The Demonic Elder Ye retracted his gaze and took a step forward. </p><p>All eyes were on him as he ascended step by step, walking toward the formation diagram at the center of the storm. </p><p>Within the tempest, the elder moved as if strolling through a garden. The Yin-Yang Halberd danced around him, shielding him from the storm's fury as he steadily climbed to the peak of the formation diagram. </p><p>This process appeared effortless, but in reality, it was fraught with peril. </p><p>The chaotic spatial currents had already reached this area. </p><p>The storm's ferocity grew increasingly terrifying, tearing through everything and creating a scene of utter chaos. Its power was beyond imagination. </p><p>The formation diagram hung high, directly facing the Ascension Platform. </p><p>A dazzling azure light emanated from it, its contours becoming clearer by the moment. </p><p>The Demonic Elder Ye stepped onto it with steady footing, lowering his head to examine the diagram beneath his feet. </p><p>The formation diagram was the same size as the top of the Ascension Platform. </p><p>Its current form could no longer be considered a mere diagram; it had transformed into a square azure platform. </p><p>The platform was covered in tadpole-like runes, each one profoundly mysterious. A single glance was enough to induce dizziness, forcing the elder to quickly avert his gaze. </p><p>Standing here, the storm's power grew even more intense. </p><p>The Demonic Elder Ye had to activate the Yin-Yang Halberd to protect himself, allowing him to remain steady on the azure platform. </p><p>The moment he stepped onto the platform, a faint sensation arose within him. This sensation came from beyond the void, from a distant and unknown place—the destination the Ascension Platform would take them to. </p><p>Ascension? </p><p>Or teleportation? </p><p>The Demonic Elder Ye wasn't sure. </p><p>He remained wary of the Jade Bone, and the Jade Bone, in turn, was cautious of him betraying their agreement. They had sworn an oath that only after successfully leaving this realm would the Jade Bone reveal everything to him. </p><p>Thus, the elder knew very little. </p><p>But one thing was clear to him: no matter what lay on the other side or what dangers awaited, he had to leave. </p><p>He had traversed every corner of the Northern Dipper Realm. </p><p>He had even ventured beyond it, traveling through the Three Realms of the North Sea and challenging their most powerful experts. </p><p>In the end, he discovered that it was merely a larger cage. </p><p>The Three Realms were surrounded by endless storms. No matter which direction one tried to leave, the result was either death from exhaustion or a humiliating retreat. </p><p>It was said that within the storms of the Three Realms of the North Sea, there was a path that might lead to other realms. </p><p>But like the legend of becoming a Deity Transformation cultivator, it remained an unverified myth. </p><p>No matter how exceptional one's talent or how unparalleled one's cultivation, they were still prisoners within this cage. </p><p>The Demonic Elder Ye refused to spend his life trapped here. Breaking through to the late Nascent Soul stage had brought him little joy, for he knew his chances of reaching Deity Transformation were slim. </p><p>He refused to live like a mayfly. </p><p>He would seize every opportunity to see and experience the broader world, even if the other side of the Ascension Platform was a dragon's den or a tiger's lair. He would have no regrets! </p><p>Ye sought the Dao. </p><p>A lifetime of seeking the Dao. </p><p>Pressing forward without hesitation. </p><p>Even death would bring no regrets! </p><p>At this thought, the Demonic Elder Ye glanced down at Bai, his eyes flickering with thought. </p><p>Extracting information from the Jade Bone was impossible. He would rather venture alone into the unknown, facing danger head-on, than rescue the Jade Bone or negotiate with it. </p><p>As for Bai, it seemed he had a close relationship with Qin Sang and Qing Jun. His origins were mysterious, and his deep understanding of the Ascension Platform suggested he knew much. Cooperation might not be out of the question. </p><p>The azure platform hung high in the sky. </p><p>The Demonic Elder Ye scanned his surroundings and noticed that under the continuous influence of the inner palace's anomalies, the outer palace had also begun to shake violently, collapsing in sections. </p><p>The Soul Infant Grand Array had been used to unseal the Ascension Platform. Without the influence of the evil array, the surrounding ghostly mist gradually thinned. </p><p>Through the mist, the elder caught glimpses of the anomalies within the Purple Subtlety Palace's inner palace. </p><p>The inner palace could now truly be called a celestial palace. It had completely separated from the outer palace, towering a hundred zhang above it and continuing to rise. </p><p>The celestial palace had originally been hidden deep within the ancient battlefield's sea of clouds. Its recent premature appearances were signs of its impending departure from this realm. Today, it had finally broken free from the sea of clouds. </p><p>Beyond the void, something seemed to be summoning the Purple Celestial Palace. </p><p>At first, its ascent was slow, but it gradually accelerated. </p><p>With each zhang the palace rose, the outer palace's tremors grew more violent. </p><p>The demonic cave had completely vanished. </p><p>The mountains and secret realms collapsed one after another, beginning their descent into destruction as the Purple Subtlety Palace departed. </p><p>As the celestial palace continued to rise, the hole in the sky grew larger. The spatial collapse made the storms outside the Northern Dipper Realm seem insignificant in comparison. </p><p>At the same time, the Demonic Elder Ye faced increasingly intense impacts, forcing him to fully activate the Yin-Yang Halberd for protection. </p><p>Within the inner palace, the recently revived paradise had once again turned into a wasteland. </p><p>The mountain range housing the Sword Path Hall and the ancient teleportation formation began to crumble from the outside, crushed into dust by the spatial currents. Less than one-tenth remained. </p><p>The ancient medicinal garden's restrictions, once as solid as a piece of jade, now showed faint cracks. </p><p>At the summit of the Celestial Mountain, the celestial palace flickered in and out of existence, sometimes dispersing, sometimes solidifying. The glow of immortal restrictions flashed everywhere, and the ancient halls on the mountain collapsed in droves. </p><p>...</p><p>One after another, the secret realms and ancient restrictions vied for survival, struggling to maintain their integrity under the onslaught of the spatial currents. </p><p>During this process, the celestial palace suffered severe damage. Continent after continent broke apart, spinning into the spatial storm before vanishing completely. </p><p>The secret realms and ancient treasures within were naturally lost as well. </p><p>Only the palace's most mysterious core restricted areas managed to survive. </p><p>Even the ancient medicinal garden was not spared. </p><p>The ancient restrictions could not protect the living beings within. The spiritual herbs' glow extinguished one by one, crushed by the invading storm. Occasionally, a few streaks of light could be seen—cultivators who had lingered too long, now fleeing in panic. </p><p>'Swoosh! Swoosh!' </p><p>They scrambled for their lives, filled with regret. </p><p>Among them, two streaks of light stood out. </p><p>One was Lu Boyuan, who had just exited the ancient medicinal garden. A frost lizard perched on his shoulder. As they took in the scene outside, the joy on their faces faded, replaced by shock. Without hesitation, they joined forces to flee toward the outer palace. </p><p>The other was the Feather Demon King. </p><p>He was even slower than Lu Boyuan, still struggling within the ancient medicinal garden, forced to reveal his true form. </p><p>Given the Feather Demon King's status, he should have known when to cut his losses. Yet, he had been lured by some immortal herb, and now it was too late for regrets. </p><p>His head occasionally lifted, his eyes filled with anxiety as he gazed at the sky. </p><p>The heavens had split open, revealing a massive hole. </p><p>The spatial storm hung like dark clouds, wreaking havoc in all directions. </p><p>The Purple Subtlety Palace was hurtling toward it with unstoppable force! </p><p>The spatial storm was one thing, but once it collided with the immortal restrictions within the inner palace, the resulting devastation would be unimaginable. Those trapped inside would have no chance of surviving the aftermath. </p><p>...</p><p>In the outer palace, atop the blood-red altar. </p><p>Under Qing Jun's control, the Heart Demon Puppet Seal covered the Jade Bone's entire body. </p><p>But this did not last long. </p><p>The Jade Bone had completely abandoned its flesh and meridians, retreating into its skeletal form. </p><p>The attacks from the others' magical treasures and techniques struck the Jade Bone repeatedly, but at best, they only damaged its skin. Not even a mark was left on its bones. Even the secret treasure unleashed by Elder Zhenyi had little effect. </p><p>This Jade Bone had been refined over countless years by an ancient cultivator. Its hardness far surpassed what Nascent Soul cultivators could easily destroy. </p><p>Qin Sang's Nine Nether Demon Flame might have had some effect. </p><p>But he dared not let the demonic flame near the Jade Bone, lest it be seized and turned against them. </p><p>It was a pity that the Sun God Tree was still unstable. Otherwise, summoning the South Bright Flame would have prevented the Jade Bone from acting so arrogantly. </p><p>The Jade Bone was not idle. It continued to wrestle with Qing Jun for control, and in the process of clashing with the Heart Demon Puppet Seal, it began to discern some of the seal's secrets. </p><p>With the Jade Bone's knowledge, it naturally had countermeasures. </p><p>It immediately changed its strategy. The purple light contracted, becoming dim and obscure, transforming into turtle shell-like purple crystals that covered its entire skeletal frame. </p><p>The lightning released by the Demon-Binding Rope struck the purple crystals, crackling and shattering them. </p><p>But the purple light was inexhaustible, quickly replenishing the crystals. </p><p>As this process continued, the purple light diminished, but it was unlikely to run out before the Jade Bone broke free! </p><p>The purple crystals clung tightly to the bones. </p><p>A strange ripple emanated from them, permeating everything and seeping into the Heart Demon Puppet Seal. </p><p>The Jade Bone, now reduced to a skeleton, trembled as if convulsing, its bones creaking. </p><p>Before long, one of the puppet seals nearly broke through, on the verge of collapse. Fortunately, Qing Jun reacted swiftly, restoring the seal before the Jade Bone could escape. </p><p>The Jade Bone let out a maniacal laugh. Once it saw through the seal, such trivial tricks and the Demon-Binding Rope could not hold it. Otherwise, it would have been unworthy of surviving to this era! </p><p>A group of ants dared to dream of harming its life! </p><p>Seeing this, Qing Jun no longer dared to divide her attention, focusing entirely on controlling the seal. </p><p>Qin Sang, while controlling the Demon-Binding Rope, also commanded the Heavenly Eye Butterfly to observe the Jade Bone's weaknesses and relay them to Qing Jun. </p><p>The effect was evident. Qing Jun saw through the Jade Bone's plans and responded in time, temporarily stabilizing the situation. </p><p>At this moment, Qing Jun's voice echoed in Qin Sang's ears, "Go up!" </p><p>Qin Sang was momentarily stunned but quickly understood her intent. With a thought, he directed the Demon-Binding Rope to fly into the storm. </p><p>Once in the storm, Bai took control of the rope, wielding it with greater power than Qin Sang could. Together with Qing Jun, they dragged the Jade Bone toward the azure platform. </p><p>Qin Sang finally had a moment to breathe. </p><p>The battle with the Jade Bone, though seemingly prolonged, had only lasted an instant. </p><p>Qin Sang inspected his condition. After two consecutive battles, his true essence was mostly depleted. A little longer, and he would have been drained dry by the Demon-Binding Rope. </p><p>The Jade Bone's strength left a deep impression on him. </p><p>Despite deploying all his treasures and having a Nascent Soul puppet by his side, he had only been able to endure and flee. Without the Demon-Binding Rope and the Heart Demon Puppet Seal, no one could have restrained the Jade Bone! </p><p>'Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh...' </p><p>Figures appeared around Qin Sang, all gazing up at the azure platform. </p><p>The platform seemed to possess a magnetic allure, drawing everyone's attention. </p><p>It represented the unknown. </p><p>It represented the possibility of the Great Dao! </p><p>For cultivators, what could be more important than a broader path to the Dao? </p><p>Even the slimmest chance was enough to drive them to madness. </p><p>At this moment, their grievances with the Demonic Elder Ye seemed trivial. They could even empathize with his ruthless schemes to seize this opportunity. </p><p>The chance was too precious to miss. Without hesitation, they threw themselves into the storm. </p><p>Of course, some hesitated. </p><p>Some had too many attachments in the mortal world—lovers, sects. </p><p>They could not let go. </p><p>Others had endured countless hardships to reach the Nascent Soul stage. With a bright future ahead, they were unwilling to risk their lives for such a slim possibility. </p><p>The Ascension Platform was here. There would be other opportunities. </p><p>They chose to give up, standing quietly beneath the blood-red altar to observe. These pioneers would pave the way for them. </p><p>The Nascent Soul cultivators who charged into the storm quickly realized its power, their expressions changing. </p><p>Seeing the Demonic Elder Ye ascend so easily, they had assumed the storm's power was manageable. </p><p>In reality, not everyone could reach the azure platform. </p><p>The early-stage Nascent Soul cultivators hit their limits first, unable to progress beyond halfway. </p><p>Unwilling to give up, they unleashed their trump cards, forcing themselves a few steps further before sighing and retreating. </p><p>Only a handful remained. </p><p>Bai and Qing Jun led the way. </p><p>They dragged the Jade Bone forward. </p><p>Qing Jun had the hardest time, needing to both control the puppet seal and resist the storm. </p><p>Bai only had to maintain the Demon-Binding Rope. </p><p>Qing Jun's delicate frame trembled, but her steps were resolute. </p><p>Bai glanced at her and nodded slightly. His body exuded a dense corpse aura, mingled with the glow of bone curses, his power surging. Within the ghostly mist, he was like a fish in water, even able to help Qing Jun bear some of the pressure. </p><p>The Demonic Elder Ye retracted his gaze, giving them a faint look. </p><p>Bound by his oath, he could not help them against the Jade Bone, but he could assist them in reaching the azure platform. </p><p>As for the others, most had grievances with him. He was not so generous. Moreover, the storm was intensifying, and even he dared not be careless. </p><p>'Bang! Bang!' </p><p>Qing Jun and Bai successfully ascended the azure platform. </p><p>Close behind were Elder Zhenyi, Cang Hong Zhenren, and the Nether Demon Lord. </p><p>As for the others, they gradually gave up. </p><p>After taking a spirit pill to recover some true essence, Qin Sang also made a few attempts. Using the demonic flame, he pushed further into the storm than his peers, but even if he could reach the platform, he lacked the strength to stand firm. </p><p>Of course, he longed to venture beyond the storm, to a more vibrant world, and pursue a higher level of the Dao. </p><p>But the timing was wrong. His cultivation was too weak. </p><p>This opportunity was not meant for him! </p><p>He gave up, landing on the ground and watching Bai and Qing Jun from afar, a trace of worry in his eyes. </p><p>Bai's origins were mysterious, and Qin Sang had long prepared for their eventual parting. But he had not expected to bid farewell to his senior sister so soon. </p><p>What dangers lay beyond the Ascension Platform? </p><p>Could they safely traverse the spatial currents? </p><p>Would he have another chance to follow in the future? </p><p>Everything was uncertain. </p><p>His two closest friends were about to leave him. Standing by his side now was only the clueless Nascent Soul puppet. </p><p>This parting might very well be eternal! </p><p>Qing Jun's strength was unparalleled in the cultivation world. With the Heart Demon Puppet Seal, no one dared to underestimate her. </p><p>Moreover, she was still young, free from the pressure of heavenly tribulations, with a boundless future ahead. </p><p>Yet, after learning the Ascension Platform's purpose from Bai, she had not hesitated to join him in seeking a broader world. </p><p>Though not as ruthless as the Demonic Elder Ye, her determination to pursue the Dao was no less fervent. </p><p>Unbound by worldly karma, she had nothing to lose. </p><p>Jing Yu attempted to charge into the storm a few times before giving up, landing beside Qin Sang. Noticing his expression, she understood his worries but could only shake her head silently, unsure how to comfort him. </p><p>Everyone knew the truth. </p><p>The cultivation world was full of variables, especially for those like Qing Jun, who sought the Dao with unwavering resolve. Their actions, like moths to a flame, had little chance of success. </p>
