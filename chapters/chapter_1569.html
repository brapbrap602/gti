<h1>Chapter 1560: Bizarre Poison</h1><p>When danger loomed, the Stone Toad instinctively employed its life-saving illusion technique, scattering Spirit Illusion Seeds to shed its mortal coil.</p><p>Unfamiliar with the Stone Toad's nature, the Grotesque-Faced Man inadvertently missed his chance. </p><p>Seeing the Stone Toad fall into his master's hands, only to transform into a flower seed in the blink of an eye, the Grey-Robed Man's burgeoning joy turned to despair, the smile that had just graced his lips freezing in place.</p><p>At this moment, the Treasure-Colored Bell shimmered once more.</p><p>Qin Sang merely caused the Treasure-Colored Bell to flicker, momentarily averting the crisis.</p><p>The Grotesque-Faced Man's expression remained inscrutable, his eyes, however, darted about before fixing on Qin Sang, their pupils now bloodshot crimson, mirroring the centipede-like scarlet marks on his face.</p><p>Taking in the Grotesque-Faced Man's appearance, Qin Sang felt a wave of unease.  It was difficult to imagine what this Nascent Soul Late Stage cultivator had done to reduce himself to such a state.</p><p>Bathed in the treasure light, the Stone Toad's figure reappeared, trapped between Nascent Soul cultivators, a small, helpless creature with nowhere to flee but in another direction.</p><p>Lu Zhang, after initial shock, expressed his delight with a hearty cry of approval.</p><p>Forewarned by Qin Sang, he had braced himself before the Grotesque-Faced Man sensed anything amiss.  In an instant, he twisted his body, rapidly closing in on the Stone Toad.</p><p>The Grotesque-Faced Man's gaze swept over Qin Sang, a strange glint in his eyes.  Suddenly, he spewed forth a blood-red sword, which instantly transformed into a streak of crimson light.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>A thick, bloody stench permeated the air.</p><p>The blood sword flickered, appearing behind the Stone Toad, its tip pointed directly at it, its speed unwavering.  Judging by the Grotesque-Faced Man’s posture, he intended to obliterate the Stone Toad outright!</p><p>A purely spiteful act, benefiting no one.</p><p>Not only was Lu Zhang enraged, but the Grey-Robed Man was also stunned. They had merely lost the initial advantage, the treasure’s final destination still uncertain. Yet his master, without a word, was destroying the Stone Toad, even expending his vital essence to do so.</p><p>His master’s command left no room for further contemplation.</p><p>The Grey-Robed Man hastily produced a five-colored whip.</p><p>It was a short whip, vibrantly colored, similar to his Five-Colored Venomous Spiders, each segment intricately linked by bone.</p><p>*Crack!*</p><p>The Grey-Robed Man lashed out with the five-colored whip, a whip shadow striking towards Lu Zhang like a bolt of lightning.</p><p>Wherever the whip shadow passed, the miasma was drawn in like a vortex in the void, the surrounding miasma almost completely absorbed before the outer miasma could rush in to fill the gap.</p><p>The main body of the whip shadow grew increasingly solid.</p><p>A direct hit would undoubtedly injure Lu Zhang severely.</p><p>Fortunately, Qin Sang finally had an opening.</p><p>A sharp blade aura slashed towards the whip shadow.</p><p>The Grey-Robed Man's cultivation was a mere step away from the Mid-Stage, still a level below Qin Sang's avatar.  Despite the advantageous environment, he could, at most, only equalize the difference in their cultivation levels.</p><p>The temperature plummeted.</p><p>Snowflakes danced in the air.</p><p>A cacophony of cracking sounds echoed through the subterranean space.</p><p>The Snow-Treading Divine Blade unleashed its divine might, slashing through the air.  The whip shadow writhed like a serpent, but with each twist, a blade aura intercepted it, keeping it at bay from Lu Zhang.</p><p>Lu Zhang remained focused.</p><p>The Stone Toad, crucial to his cultivation and hard-won, could not be destroyed here before his eyes.</p><p>Lu Zhang flicked his wrist, the jade bracelet on his arm flying off, spinning rapidly, transforming into a white halo in mid-air, perfectly encircling the blood sword.</p><p>Layers of illusory bracelet shadows rapidly contracted inwards, each imbued with a binding and suppressing force, pressing towards the blood sword at the center.</p><p>The blood light on the surface of the sword began to dissipate, but the core remained unshaken.</p><p>*Bang, bang, bang!* The sounds rang out in succession.</p><p>Despite being a hasty attack, the blood sword's power was still astonishing. It managed to obliterate a dozen bracelet shadows, its tip penetrating halfway through the center of the jade bracelet before its momentum finally began to wane.</p><p>Seizing this fleeting opportunity, Lu Zhang closed in on the Stone Toad, flicking his sleeve and casting out a silver net, which descended from above.</p><p>The Stone Toad continued its desperate flight, morphing into various forms, yet its transformations were rendered useless under the Treasure-Colored Bell’s light. It was about to be caught in the net.</p><p>Yet, Qin Sang felt something was amiss.</p><p>Especially the Grotesque-Faced Man's gaze, like a venomous snake, seemed fixated on him, giving him a chilling sensation.</p><p>Just then, as the blood sword struggled to break free from the jade bracelet's confinement, a white light emerged from within, faintly revealing the silhouette of a Jade-Armored Beetle.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced over, his expression momentarily stunned.</p><p>This was a type of spirit insect he had never seen before.</p><p>None of the ancient texts he had perused contained any record of such a creature.</p><p>However, seeing the Jade-Armored Beetle's wings, identical to those of the Corpse Flame Moths, and recalling the swarm they had just slaughtered, he knew there had to be a connection between the two.</p><p>“Careful!” Qin Sang roared.</p><p>At that moment, the Jade-Armored Beetle spread its wings, hovering in mid-air.  Its tiny eyes, just as crimson and demonic as the Grotesque-Faced Man’s, devoured the remaining vital essence from the blood sword, then expelled a milky white, otherworldly light.</p><p>The white light’s target was not only the Stone Toad but also Lu Zhang himself!</p><p>This light did not possess a world-shattering aura.</p><p>The Jade-Armored Beetle’s appearance was even beautiful and endearing.</p><p>Yet this combination concealed a terrifying danger.</p><p>Lu Zhang clasped his hands together, the silver net tightening around the captured Stone Toad.  He quickly retrieved the net and retreated, but he was still grazed by the edge of the white light.</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>The white light arrived in an instant.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>Lu Zhang’s robes billowed, forming a layer of protective True Essence, which proved ineffective against the penetrating white light.</p><p>Lu Zhang’s nostrils flared, his face abruptly paling as a greyish-white aura rapidly spread across his features, draining the color from his skin.  His protective True Essence shuddered violently, showing signs of instability.</p><p>Lu Zhang pressed his fingers together against his chest several times, suppressing the greyish-white aura momentarily before it surged back with renewed ferocity.</p><p>To his horror, the flow of Qi and blood throughout his body began to stagnate.</p><p>“Haha!”</p><p>The Grotesque-Faced Man cackled, “Excellent! Excellent! Even more potent than I anticipated!  A pity my Gu King is not yet fully matured.  Otherwise, this single strike would have sent your soul to the netherworld!”</p><p>As his laughter echoed, the Grotesque-Faced Man’s fingers morphed into claws, his skin becoming rough like bark, his arm grotesquely extending into a long vine, lashing out towards Lu Zhang’s forehead like a hawk swooping down on its prey.</p><p>A direct hit would undoubtedly leave five gaping wounds in Lu Zhang’s skull.</p><p>Whether his Nascent Soul could escape then was uncertain.</p><p>In this critical moment, Lu Zhang retrieved a bottle of unknown pills, tipping his head back and swallowing them all in one gulp.  A distorted howl escaped his throat.</p><p>*Hummm…*</p><p>The Azure Bell, previously entangled with the wooden beads, vibrated frantically, suddenly vanishing from its position, breaking free from the beads and appearing above Lu Zhang's head.</p><p>The Azure Bell trembled, aligning itself above Lu Zhang, then plummeted downwards.</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>The wooden claw struck the Azure Bell squarely.</p><p>*Dong!* A resounding clang reverberated through the cavern. The surface of the Azure Bell rippled but remained incredibly sturdy, completely unscathed. It was merely knocked aside, crashing into the nearby stone wall.</p><p>Lu Zhang’s fate remained unknown.</p><p>The Grotesque-Faced Man narrowed his eyes, choosing not to pursue the Azure Bell.  Instead, his gaze shifted to Qin Sang, filled with avarice. He hissed, a grotesque smile twisting his features, "Such pure Wood Spiritual Aura!"</p><p>--</p><p>Two thousand first--||</p>
