<h1>Chapter 1655: First Encounter</h1><p>The celestial fire returned to its place.</p><p>The stench of blood, previously burned away, seeped back from the corpses and the female cultivator, filling the cave dwelling.</p><p>Her hair was disheveled, and she appeared mad.</p><p>She sat there, her expression contorted, alternating between fear and blankness.  Blood mixed with saliva dripped from her mouth. Her breath grew stronger, as if she were absorbing the blood essence and nascent soul of the white-robed cultivator.</p><p>*Thud!*</p><p>Blood splattered on the ground.</p><p>The sound seemed to startle her.  She shuddered violently, and a strange gleam appeared in her vacant eyes. Slowly, stiffly, she turned her neck.</p><p>She ignored her师兄’s corpse.</p><p>Her gaze fell upon the Crimson Fire Sword beside the fiery barrier.</p><p>When the white-robed cultivator died, the Crimson Fire Sword was about to break through the barrier.  Because the female cultivator had drawn the celestial fire to ambush him, the sword had been flung to the ground, landing near a fire rhinoceros horn and a ring.</p><p>Using her hands and feet, she crawled closer and grabbed the spirit sword.</p><p>The Crimson Fire Sword, now ownerless, lost its fiery aura, revealing its true form.  It seemed to be crafted from some kind of crystal, similar to the firefly chain on the female cultivator’s wrist.</p><p>The sword’s reflection showed her own face.</p><p>She raised her bloody hand, gently touching her features, tracing her brow, lips, and ears, carefully stroking her face.  A look of curiosity filled her eyes.</p><p>In the process, she smeared the blood all over her face, obscuring her pretty features.</p><p>Suddenly, she froze, staring intently at her reflection.</p><p>An instinct, not her own, told her she looked unattractive.</p><p>She tilted her head, drew a wisp of celestial fire from the barrier, and let it burst forth. The flames surrounded her, washing away the blood, then, finding the smell of blood unpleasant, she burned the corpses and bloodstains, erasing all traces of the fight.</p><p>The cave dwelling was cleansed.</p><p>The female cultivator straightened her robes, looked at her reflection again, and found it much more pleasing. She twitched her mouth, producing a clumsy, strange smile.  After smoothing her lips with her finger, the smile improved. She practiced a few times until she mastered it.</p><p>She held the sword, testing its weight, then summoned the ring and both cultivators’ storage pouches. Using the celestial fire, she destroyed the restrictions on them, scattering their contents on the ground.</p><p>She touched and examined each item, tossing them aside as if they were trash, consuming anything edible. Finally, her gaze settled on the fire rhinoceros horn.</p><p>“Celestial tribulation…”</p><p>Her tone was completely different. Though a murmur, it was sharp and strange, like a non-speaker struggling to utter words. Her expression was hazy and unclear.</p><p>After examining the horn for a long time, she decided to take it. She lifted the Crimson Fire Sword, propped herself up on her legs, and slowly stood. She took a step forward.</p><p>*Crash!*</p><p>Despite the smooth ground, she fell flat on her face.</p><p>“Ugh…”</p><p>She pushed herself up, a picture of awkwardness, then burst into laughter, a laugh that held a hint of innocence.</p><p>She climbed to her feet again, this time more steadily. With a few steps, she fully adapted to her body, walking with long strides.</p><p>Exiting the cave, she suddenly turned toward the west, as if listening intently.  A moment later, she vanished.</p><p>…</p><p>Qin Sang and the other two were still pursuing.</p><p>However, Qin Sang noticed that Su Zi Nan and Mo Xing Dao had become cautious, no longer as aggressive, focusing on dealing with the divine prohibition.</p><p>In fact, Qin Sang also faced a challenge.</p><p>The power and difficulty of the Yang Yan Divine Prohibition far exceeded his expectations, giving him a deeper understanding of the Wuxiang Immortal Sect's strength.</p><p>After entering the prohibition, having confirmed that Su Zi Nan and Mo Xing Dao could only follow behind and posed no immediate threat, Qin Sang focused on finding a way to break the prohibition.</p><p>He tried various secret techniques and treasures, but ultimately had to start with the Fire Seed Golden Lotus.</p><p>After careful analysis, Qin Sang discovered that the prohibition targeted intruders based on the celestial fire's own perception, automatically attacking discordant auras.</p><p>This gave him an idea: he would use the Nine Netherworld Devil Fire to create a fiery cage, capturing some of the celestial fire's power during its fluctuations.</p><p>Within the black fire dragon, the Yang Yan celestial fire automatically condensed into a ball.</p><p>Qin Sang rapidly changed his hand seals, working with the prohibition to forcefully sever the connection between this ball of celestial fire and the divine prohibition, then immediately used the Fire Seed Golden Lotus technique to refine a trace of the celestial fire.</p><p>The refinement process was unexpectedly smooth.</p><p>The Yang Yan celestial fire was of a lower grade than he had anticipated.</p><p>Things weren't so simple.</p><p>Qin Sang sensed that the celestial fire he had refined and the external Yangyan celestial fire were essentially two different types of spiritual flames.  He wasn't sure if the difference arose during capture or during the refining process.</p><p>Trying to use refined celestial fire to deceive the divine restriction wouldn't work!</p><p>The divine restriction, the divine restriction – the root cause lay in the restriction itself. He had only refined the external appearance of the celestial fire; it was merely a superficial imitation.</p><p>This was troublesome.</p><p>The deeper he went, the more terrifying the celestial fire became.  If he continued, the power deep within the divine restriction would undoubtedly be extremely formidable, enough to threaten the lives of Grand Cultivators.  Forcing his way through was impossible.</p><p>Escaping his pursuers wouldn't be difficult once he reached the destination, but the challenge lay in traversing the divine restriction to reach the Jade Tablet.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't think of a better solution for the moment.</p><p>The divine restriction was essentially ownerless. Qin Sang was confident that his abilities and the Celestial Eye Divine Ability would allow him to pass, but breaking the restriction would take time.</p><p>While climbing, Qin Sang had noticed flickering lights at the entrance to the Wuxiang Immortal Gate.  He guessed that the Yunlong power was weakening and cultivators were starting to enter, undoubtedly bringing significant reinforcements to the Daoist sect and the Wuxiang Immortal Gate.</p><p>To make matters worse, news of the legacy's appearance would inevitably spread, attracting experts from all sides.</p><p>Soon, various sects would converge at the Wuxiang Immortal Gate.</p><p>A free-for-all would be preferable.</p><p>But Central State valued order.  They were likely to establish rules first and divide the spoils of the Wuxiang Immortal Gate amongst themselves. Those of unknown origin, like them, would be excluded and become targets.</p><p>How to break this deadlock?</p><p>While Qin Sang pondered, Su Zinan and Mo Xingdao faced similar dilemmas.</p><p>They pursued him, firstly to kill Qin Sang, and secondly to drive him deeper into the divine restriction to scout the path ahead.  Both had not forgotten about the Jade Tablet; neither wanted to miss the chance for apotheosis.</p><p>As they ventured deeper into the Yangyan Divine Restriction, the desire to kill Qin Sang diminished. Instead, they were wary of Qin Sang using the Yangyan Divine Restriction to set traps.</p><p>If not for watching Qin Sang and seeing how he would navigate this, they might have abandoned the chase.</p><p>Su Zinan knew he couldn't kill Qin Sang here.  He was merely tracking Qin Sang's movements, observing the surrounding celestial fire, and thinking of a way to break the restriction.</p><p>Mo Xingdao seemed to be doing the same.</p><p>'Whoosh! Whoosh!'</p><p>The celestial fire ahead was drawn in, continuously surging towards them.</p><p>They moved in perfect coordination, using skillful maneuvers to swiftly dart between the flames, their figures fleeting, the flames unable to touch them.</p><p>While it looked effortless, they both knew this evasion had limits.  Without a better method, they wouldn't be able to traverse the divine restriction.</p><p>At that moment, two clumps of celestial fire surged into Su Zinan's line of sight.</p><p>Beyond the dazzling flames, Su Zinan noticed a smaller celestial fire.  He found it strange, and as he watched it quickly dart through the larger flames, a warning bell rang, and he knew something was wrong.</p><p>"Retreat!"</p><p>Su Zinan, who had been habitually guiding the trajectory of the celestial fire, immediately stopped and retreated.</p><p>Mo Xingdao, even more alert, retreated without hesitation.</p><p>The next instant, the clump of celestial fire split from within. A firebird spread its wings and flew towards them, only to collide with another clump of celestial fire.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The firebird and the celestial fire exploded like fireworks, scattering countless streams of fire.  The aftershock triggered a chain reaction of explosions amongst the surrounding celestial fire.</p><p>Simultaneously, a cold voice echoed in their minds, "Dare to pursue further, and don't blame Qin for being ruthless!"</p><p>Su Zinan and Mo Xingdao evaded the shockwave, their expressions grave as they looked at the chaotic scene before them.</p><p>Ahead.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced back, then sped up.</p><p>Earlier, he had used the refined celestial fire to envelop the firebird, masking its presence.  Although the celestial fire was merely a superficial imitation, it looked identical from the outside.</p><p>The firebird was an inanimate object and wouldn't trigger a major reaction from the divine restriction.</p><p>This allowed him to discreetly leave the firebird behind, setting a trap for them.</p><p>However, the Nanming Li Fire's aura was too unique, and the celestial fire couldn't perfectly mask it.  Prolonged use would attract counterattacks from the divine restriction.  Furthermore, the trap could only utilize three firebirds; he couldn't yet control six.</p><p>If he got too close to them, they would definitely sense it.  The trap had its limitations.</p><p>Qin Sang had carefully considered the situation.  Even if he subdued more celestial fire or used demonic fire, this type of trap would have limited effectiveness, as they were now extremely cautious.</p><p>Luring them deep into the divine restriction would leave Qin Sang himself struggling to cope, let alone attacking.</p><p>Knowing the trap’s limitations, Qin Sang still used it.</p><p>Firstly, to force them back and facilitate his actions later.</p><p>Secondly, as a warning, mainly targeting Mo Xingdao.</p><p>Qin Sang had used the Sun God Tree against Lao Wu, a fact not hidden from Su Zinan.  Su Zinan certainly knew the power of the Nanming Li Fire, but may not have told Mo Xingdao. If Mo Xingdao knew he was facing such a powerful weapon, he would hesitate.</p><p>It would be even better to frighten him off directly.</p><p>As expected, the fire bird's appearance caused the opponent to retreat.</p><p>Seeing the pursuers give up, Qin Sang continued inward for a while, then unexpectedly reversed course, flying towards the outer Yangyan Divine Barrier.</p><p>During their chase, his avatar should be nearing the end of the outer fog. His main body couldn't pass the barrier, so his avatar wouldn't be able to either.</p><p>He planned to rendezvous with his avatar first.</p><p>Furthermore, Qin Sang had a vague idea.</p><p>He worried that a prolonged struggle with the barrier would attract the attention of Zhu Wudao and the other remnants of the Wuxiang Immortal Sect.  Were they not afraid?</p><p>Was Zhu Wudao's deliberate sabotage of the outer array a ruse?</p><p>Sometimes, retreating a step can reveal a shortcut.</p><p>Meanwhile...</p><p>Mo Xingdao narrowed his eyes, watching the dissipating aftereffects of the Nanming Li Fire, his expression grim.  "Is this the ultimate fire he commands?"</p><p>His tone implied a question.</p><p>Su Zinan's description of the fire was too brief.  While it indicated immense power, it failed to convey its true terror—clearly intentional.</p><p>"Correct."</p><p>Su Zinan nodded impassively.  "Lao Wu was driven back by this fire bird years ago.  Incredibly, he's grown even stronger in just a few decades."</p><p>Mo Xingdao, noticing Su Zinan’s nonchalant tone, refrained from further questioning and asked about their next move.</p><p>"It's unwise to pursue Huo Mo further... Mo Daoyou, do you recall what Elder Zhu said when he urged us to destroy the Jade Pavilion?" Su Zinan pondered before asking Mo Xingdao.</p><p>Mo Xingdao gave an evasive answer. "Elder Zhu held the Golden Seal."</p><p>Su Zinan glanced at him, smiling. "So, Mo Daoyou suspected something. This place’s barriers follow the Five Elements’ generative cycle.  There must be four other divine barriers, each as powerful as the Yangyan barrier. His deliberate destruction of the Jade Pavilion suggests a change in the location of the Metal barrier!"</p><p>Mo Xingdao nodded, and the two began their return journey, but in a different direction from Qin Sang. Based on their deduction, they headed towards the Metal barrier's predicted location.</p><p>…</p><p>Outside the barrier…</p><p>Below the square, the fog churned.  A figure emerged—Qin Sang's avatar.</p><p>Though damaged, the fog formation remained treacherous.  Fortunately, the connection with his main body remained.  Holding onto that connection, he found his way out of the chaos.</p><p>The avatar acted cautiously, hiding in an abandoned dwelling after emerging. He carefully surveyed the surroundings.</p><p>Blocked by the barrier, he couldn't communicate with his main body.  He was unfamiliar with the area, but he could vaguely sense his main body's location.</p><p>At that moment, the avatar's eyes narrowed.  He saw golden clouds in the west, their edges trembling, thunder rumbling—clearly a powerful clash was underway!</p><p>The combatants moved deeper into the clouds.  The golden clouds themselves seemed affected, their light shimmering.</p><p>"Not my main body's location…"</p><p>The avatar relaxed slightly, continuing his observation.  Confirming the square was empty, he cautiously approached the clouds and entered the Five Elements barrier.</p><p>Upon entering, the Fire Jade Centipede awoke.</p><p>After devouring the fire spirit, the centipede had fallen into a deep sleep. The avatar had been periodically prodding it to prevent it from sleeping too soundly, but now it was suddenly awake.</p><p>From experience, this meant it sensed something.</p><p>"A treasure within the barrier?"</p><p>Surprised, the avatar was about to summon the centipede to pinpoint the location, but the creature's agitation intensified, emitting shrill cries.</p><p>"What is this?"</p><p>The avatar paused, immediately sensing something amiss.</p><p>The centipede's reaction indicated a nearby treasure rapidly approaching it.</p><p>The area was saturated with Five Elements energy, yet seemingly empty.</p><p>But the centipede's behavior was clearly abnormal!</p><p>Before he could investigate, the avatar's eyes turned white.  With a flash, his Ice Soul Divine Light erupted.  The white chill surged, instantly freezing everything around him. The barrier's power was weak in the periphery and couldn't withstand the light.</p><p>But the light struck nothing!</p><p>The avatar's expression changed, the situation increasingly bizarre.  He enveloped himself in the light and immediately retreated from the Five Elements barrier.</p><p>As soon as he left the golden clouds, the centipede calmed down.</p><p>Simultaneously, from a spot beyond the avatar's sight, the clouds twisted, and a woman's figure abruptly materialized.</p><p>Half her body remained hidden within the barrier, invisible.</p><p>The visible half, however, was exposed.</p><p>The woman frowned and retreated back into the barrier.</p><p>The avatar, sensing something, whirled around, but saw nothing.</p>
