<h1>Chapter 1709: Scouring the World</h1><p>The Seven Provinces of the Western Reaches.</p><p>Zhen Province.</p><p>This province bordered the Western Desert to the west, the frontier a labyrinth of mountains and valleys that shielded it from the encroaching sandstorms.</p><p>The mountains were verdant and lush, brimming with spiritual energy, a stark contrast to the boundless yellow sands.  Nearly every mountain in this region housed a cave dwelling.</p><p>Countless sects, both large and small, and hermits cultivated here, earning it the name "Thousand Mountains, Thousand Sects."</p><p>The Profound Strategy Manor was one such sect.</p><p>Though not a lineage of singular inheritance, the entire sect numbered only thirty-odd members.  Their acceptance of disciples followed the principle of quality over quantity, each meticulously chosen.</p><p>While smaller in scale than renowned sects, the Profound Strategy Manor held considerable prestige. Its Sect Master, Venerable Ming Ce, enjoyed widespread respect in the surrounding area.</p><p>Beneath a waterfall.</p><p>Within a mountain pavilion.</p><p>Venerable Ming Ce, feeling the intense gaze of the Daoist before him, furrowed his brow. "Daoist, from whence did you learn that my sect possesses the Everlasting Dendrobium?"</p><p>"Three hundred years ago, an Everlasting Dendrobium was discovered in an oasis within the Western Desert. It sparked a fierce struggle, but its whereabouts ultimately remained unknown. Coincidentally, this humble Daoist discovered that Fellow Daoist was near the oasis at the time, appearing in a nearby market town…"</p><p>The Daoist opposite him frankly revealed the source of his information, openly admitting to having investigated Venerable Ming Ce's movements.</p><p>The Daoist was Qin Sang in disguise!</p><p>The Nether Moon Guard, dispersed throughout the cultivation world to gather information on various treasures, were ready to draw in their net.</p><p>The Everlasting Dendrobium was one such treasure. It could be refined into a medicinal pill described in the "Panhu True Scripture," enhancing the cultivation of the Skyeye Butterfly. However, this spiritual herb also held immense benefits for cultivators, making it difficult to persuade Venerable Ming Ce to part with it.</p><p>The Nether Moon Guard had traveled far and wide, collecting most of the treasures on the list. The remaining items were either untraceable or inaccessible, requiring Qin Sang's personal intervention.</p><p>"The Everlasting Dendrobium is of great use to this humble Daoist. If Fellow Daoist is willing to part with it, I will do everything in my power to ensure your satisfaction."</p><p>The disguised Qin Sang spoke with unwavering confidence.</p><p>This confidence stemmed from overwhelming strength!</p><p>Even disregarding Qin Sang's true body, his transformed self alone was virtually unrivaled in the world. Only the two Divine Transformation powerhouses could confidently suppress him.</p><p>Considering his true body as well, he no longer held the same level of apprehension towards Divine Transformation cultivators.</p><p>After only fifty years of secluded cultivation, Qin Sang's true body had reached the peak of Late Nascent Soul!</p><p>Considering the timeline, it had been a considerable period since Qin Sang's breakthrough to Late Nascent Soul. The Formless Immortal Sect had been opened by Zhu Wudao more than eighty years after his breakthrough.</p><p>However, cultivating the "Fire Seed Golden Lotus" had consumed the majority of his time.  He had truly begun his cultivation seventy years ago, after refining the Demonic Fire.</p><p>Reaching the peak in merely seventy years, despite being frequently distracted by other matters for the first twenty!</p><p>Such astonishing cultivation speed at the Late Nascent Soul stage was exceedingly rare, even among the renowned sects of the Central Continent.</p><p>The insights from the Wordless Jade Tablet and the Buddha Bone Relic were paramount.  Even when encountering bottlenecks, Qin Sang only needed to patiently contemplate for a period to smoothly break through.</p><p>The "Soul Nourishing Sword Scripture," the Slaughter Talisman, and the Cleansing Pool had enhanced his talent. Coupled with the Four Saints Spirit Gathering Formation, Qin Sang's cultivation advanced by leaps and bounds.</p><p>Now, Qin Sang still held some apprehension towards the two Divine Transformation powerhouses, but with his current strength and the Deerfield Grand Formation, even if the Azure Fox Saint King reneged on their agreement and came seeking him, he possessed the ability to contend with her.</p><p>With such assurance, his transformed self didn't need to remain hidden within the Sweet Dew Zen Monastery. This appearance marked his intent to scour the world!</p><p>"Daoist, you possess quite the imposing spirit!"</p><p>Venerable Ming Ce scrutinized Qin Sang's disguised form.</p><p>Various signs indicated that Daoist Qing Feng had close ties with the Sweet Dew Zen Monastery and was himself a grand cultivator who had reached the pinnacle of this world, possessing sufficient strength to fulfill his promises.</p><p>Conversely, Venerable Ming Ce had to consider the consequences of provoking him.</p><p>Qin Sang's disguised form responded with a smile.</p><p>Venerable Ming Ce fell silent, then sighed softly. "The Everlasting Dendrobium was originally intended for my next breakthrough. Since Daoist has taken a liking to it, although I feel reluctant, I am willing to fulfill your wish…"</p><p>Seeing the other party concede so readily, Qin Sang's disguised form didn't reveal any joy, knowing there must be more to it.</p><p>As expected, Venerable Ming Ce's tone shifted. "However, I have a small request…"</p><p>After a pause, Venerable Ming Ce spoke gravely, "If Daoist could lend a hand and save my beloved disciple's life, I will immediately present the treasure to you!"</p><p>Qin Sang's disguised form was slightly taken aback. "Has your disciple offended some powerful figure?"</p><p>"No, although my disciple is mischievous, he knows his limits."</p><p>Venerable Ming Ce shook his head, flicking his finger towards the mountain peak to send a Dharma decree, summoning his disciple. He then explained in detail to Qin Sang, "My disciple, Yu Zhensheng, has been intelligent since childhood. I have placed great hopes on him, hoping he will inherit my mantle and revitalize the sect. My disciple has lived up to expectations, having reached the Late Golden Core realm, just a step away from Nascent Soul. Unfortunately, at the crucial moment of his breakthrough, we discovered that my disciple possesses an extra hidden meridian in addition to the ordinary eight extraordinary meridians!"</p><p>"A hidden meridian?"</p><p>Qin Sang's disguised form was surprised, searching through his knowledge for records of hidden meridians.</p><p>Possessing a hidden meridian could be considered a special physique. Some were easy to open, while others might remain undiscovered until death.  Whether it was beneficial or detrimental depended on the meridian's location.</p><p>Some hidden meridians not only posed no harm but also granted cultivators special talents upon opening, providing a multiplier effect when cultivating specific techniques.</p><p>Judging from Venerable Ming Ce's tone, Yu Zhensheng's case didn't seem to fall into this category.</p><p>"I have consulted countless texts. My disciple's hidden meridian is not inherently harmful. For others, forcibly opening it would grant them an enviable opportunity with a ninety percent success rate. However, our sect's cultivation method is unique. Forcibly opening the meridian carries the risk of endangering my disciple's life, a risk that increases with higher cultivation levels. If left unchecked, the hidden meridian will, in turn, limit my disciple's potential…"</p><p>Venerable Ming Ce explained everything.</p><p>At this moment, a figure swiftly descended from the mountain peak, standing beside the pavilion. He was a handsome young man.</p><p>Guided by his master, Yu Zhensheng bowed deeply to Qin Sang's disguised form.</p><p>"From Fellow Daoist's words, it seems you have already found a solution?" Qin Sang's disguised form extended his senses.</p><p>Yu Zhensheng's body trembled slightly as he struggled to restrain his instincts, allowing Qin Sang's disguised form to examine him, a glimmer of hope flashing in his eyes.</p><p>"I have acquired a Meridian Opening Secret Art that can ensure my disciple's safety. However, this art requires someone to act as a guardian, expending their Origin Essence to protect him should a crisis arise. The guardian is ideally a Late Nascent Soul cultivator. If I were to undertake this myself, the success rate is only fifty percent…"</p><p>Venerable Ming Ce glanced at Qin Sang's disguised form.</p><p>He had originally intended to do it himself.</p><p>It wasn't that he didn't want to invite a grand cultivator, but rather that he lacked the means to move them.</p><p>Expending Origin Essence inevitably required prolonged secluded cultivation to replenish. For grand cultivators striving for Divine Transformation, time was incredibly precious.  Should the meridian opening fail and Yu Zhensheng perish, the guardian would also be implicated.</p><p>Who would be willing to risk themselves for an unrelated person?</p><p>After receiving the Meridian Opening Secret Art and examining it, Qin Sang's disguised form pondered briefly before agreeing. "Have your disciple prepare himself according to the secret art. Once this humble Daoist has concluded other matters, I will return to act as his guardian! Fellow Daoist, prepare the Everlasting Dendrobium!"</p><p>With that, Qin Sang's disguised form rose, gave a slight bow, and gracefully descended the mountain.</p><p>"Master, he…"</p><p>With his life hanging in the balance, Yu Zhensheng was filled with anxiety and uncertainty. Seeing the other party leave with only a single sentence, he couldn't help but worry.</p><p>Venerable Ming Ce stood at the edge of the pavilion, watching Qin Sang's disguised form depart, a sense of relief washing over him. "Do not fret, my disciple. Daoist Qing Feng is a man of his word!"</p><p>…</p><p>Ning Province, Central Continent.</p><p>Yin Flame Sect.</p><p>Having left the Profound Strategy Manor, Qin Sang's disguised form appeared before the gates of the Yin Flame Sect.</p><p>As his figure materialized, the Yin Flame Sect immediately opened its gates. Disciples lined up in two rows, their expressions solemn, respectfully welcoming Qin Sang's disguised form with impeccable courtesy.</p><p>Then, the Yin Flame Sect Master, accompanied by several elders, emerged to greet him outside the gate.</p><p>"Daoist Qing Feng's presence graces our humble sect…"</p><p>After exchanging pleasantries, Qin Sang's disguised form was escorted into the main hall.</p><p>The Yin Flame Sect offered fragrant tea and immortal wine.</p><p>The Yin Flame Sect Master was a white-haired elder, exceedingly tactful. Every sentence was laced with flattery, yet he refrained from inquiring about Qin Sang's disguised form's purpose.</p><p>Qin Sang's disguised form attempted to broach the subject several times, but the Sect Master skillfully steered the conversation elsewhere.</p><p>"Does your esteemed sect still possess that piece of True Flame Gold?"</p><p>Qin Sang's disguised form grew tired of the charade and inquired directly.</p><p>True Flame Gold was an essential material for the Icefire Token.</p><p>The Yin Flame Sect Master's gaze flickered as he stroked his white beard, feigning difficulty. "This… I informed Daoist Qing Feng previously that this item was intended as a gift for Elder Fan of the Skyhawk Tower, to celebrate his thousandth birthday. It wouldn't be proper to…"</p><p>The Yin Flame Sect, being affiliated with the Skyhawk Tower, was unafraid of Qin Sang's disguised form using his influence to pressure them.</p><p>Before he could finish, a flicker of fire suddenly appeared in Qin Sang's disguised form's palm.</p><p>The firelight was reddish, tinged with blue and black. Within it were four folding screens, each bearing a simple design: a single flame in the center, seemingly eternally burning.</p><p>The Yin Flame Sect Master nearly pulled out his beard in astonishment. "This is…"</p><p>"I heard that Fellow Daoist has long desired to refine the Fire Cloud Smoke Screen.  Does this treasure's grade meet your requirements?"</p><p>Qin Sang's disguised form lightly shook his hand, the miniature screens flying towards the Yin Flame Sect Master.</p><p>The Fire Cloud Smoke Screen was a unique treasure. Its grade wasn't determined by the screens themselves but by the four spiritual flames fused within them.</p><p>Qin Sang's disguised form, aiming to cater to the Sect Master's desires, had instructed the Nether Moon Guard to find the refining method for the Fire Cloud Smoke Screen and relayed it to Deerfield, where his true body personally refined it. The flames sealed within the screens weren't Nine Nether Demonic Fire but Ancestral Sacred Fire separated from the fire lotus, causing the Yin Flame Sect Master's eyes to widen.</p><p>An hour later.</p><p>The Yin Flame Sect Master, beaming, escorted Qin Sang's disguised form out of the gate, appearing somewhat reluctant to part.</p><p>…</p><p>The sky was overcast.</p><p>The undulating mountains below seemed shrouded in a layer of grey gauze.</p><p>An ethereal grey mist permeated this world. As far as the eye could see, the rocks were all grey, devoid of any greenery, as if all life had been extinguished in this region.</p><p>"Ahead lies the core region of the Grey Mountain Forbidden Zone. If Daoist can venture deep within and locate my master's remains, I only require a single jade slip. Everything else belongs to Daoist, and my junior sister will immediately deliver the Rootless Stone!"</p><p>Two figures flew at a steady pace. The speaker was a young man in black robes, deliberately keeping half a step behind, his demeanor respectful.</p><p>The other person was Qin Sang's disguised form, his gaze fixed on the depths of the Grey Mountain Forbidden Zone.</p><p>The Rootless Stone was a supplementary material for the Icefire Token, but Qin Sang's disguised form's true objective wasn't the stone itself but an item among the young man's master's belongings.</p><p>The young man in black robes wasn't an ordinary figure either. His master, Gui Tuo, had a notorious reputation, having once betrayed the Subduing Heaven Valley.</p><p>Their current location was at the southernmost point of the Seven Provinces of the Western Reaches, bordering the Savage Province. For this grey mountain range to be designated a forbidden zone, its dangers were evident.</p><p>From a distance, it appeared as a grey blur, obscuring vision.</p><p>Legend had it that this forbidden zone was teeming with countless ferocious and malevolent creatures.  Numerous Nascent Soul Patriarchs had perished here, making searching for a single skeleton akin to finding a needle in a haystack.</p><p>The two didn't hesitate. After a brief discussion, they entered the forbidden zone directly.</p><p>Qin Sang's disguised form raised his hand, summoning the Three Corpses Death God Banner. Demonic souls coalesced into form.</p><p>Seeing the demonic soul transformed from Su Zinan, the young man in black robes was dumbfounded, finally realizing that the rumors were true. His gaze towards Qin Sang's disguised form inevitably carried a hint of fear.</p><p>With the demonic soul leading the way, grey mist billowed along their path. Malicious creatures formed from Yin energy, such as Yin Wolves and Demonic Apes, emerged, but none were a match for the demonic soul.</p><p>After slaughtering their way through, the grey mist ahead suddenly thinned, and the ferocious creatures vanished without a trace.</p><p>Qin Sang's disguised form immediately understood that someone was manipulating things from behind the scenes, most likely the legendary master of the Grey Mountains. Seeing the overwhelming power of the newcomer, it adopted a stance of indifference, allowing them to pass unhindered.</p><p>"Considerate of it!"</p><p>Qin Sang's disguised form sneered, recalling the demonic soul to his side. He began to meticulously search the Grey Mountain Forbidden Zone.  As expected, his path was unimpeded, no malicious creatures daring to appear before them.</p><p>Three days later.</p><p>The two found a cave within a valley in the forbidden zone.</p><p>Inside the cave lay only a skeleton.  The young man in black robes identified it as his master's, who had perished here from grievous injuries.</p><p>Since the master of the Grey Mountains was so accommodating, Qin Sang's disguised form didn't bother it. After obtaining the desired item, he left the Grey Mountain Forbidden Zone.</p><p>Only after Qin Sang's disguised form departed did a sigh of relief echo from a certain underground cavern.</p><p>…</p><p>The East Sea.</p><p>Water Mirror Seven Islands.</p><p>Seven immortal islands resided overseas, each hosting a sect. All seven sects excelled in refining techniques, each specializing in a different area. Although individually not particularly powerful, the seven sects were united, forming a considerable force, free from the constraints of the Jade Shadow Sect.</p><p>Qin Sang's disguised form's visit to the Water Mirror Seven Islands wasn't to commission refining but to request access to their treasuries, seeking to purchase spiritual materials.</p><p>"The seven sects have decided. If Daoist is willing to become a Guest Elder of the Water Mirror Seven Islands, these two treasures will be gifted to you, free of charge!" The one receiving Qin Sang was the Sect Master of the Luo Mirror Sect, one of the seven sects. His appearance spoke of shrewdness.</p><p>"This…"</p><p>Qin Sang's disguised form feigned hesitation.</p><p>It wasn't that he wasn't qualified to be a Guest Elder, but rather that the Water Mirror Seven Islands were located in the East Sea, posing an inconvenience due to the threat of the Azure Fox Saint King.</p><p>This meeting took place at a Water Mirror Seven Islands outpost near the mouth of the Fu River.</p><p>"Do not worry, Daoist. We wouldn't ask you to confront powerful enemies. We merely hope that Daoist can put in a good word for us within the Three Doctrines Alliance, securing some advantages for us," the Luo Mirror Sect Master hastily explained.</p><p>"The Water Mirror Seven Islands wish to join the Three Doctrines Alliance?"</p><p>Qin Sang's disguised form was surprised. After a moment of thought, he nodded in agreement.</p><p>The so-called Three Doctrines Alliance was a pact formed thirty years ago between the Sweet Dew Zen Monastery, the Eight Scenery Pavilion, and the Skyhawk Tower. Its announcement had sent shockwaves throughout the cultivation world.</p><p>No one had expected the Dao, Buddha, and Demon, inherently incompatible, to set aside their differences and unite.</p><p>The alliance of these three sects filled the cultivation world with apprehension!</p><p>The name "Three Doctrines Alliance" was actually coined by outsiders, but it was fitting and became commonly accepted.</p><p>Discerning individuals could see that the driving force behind this alliance was undoubtedly Sage Hui Guang, but the reason remained unknown. Sage Hui Guang had only appeared once, on the day the pact was formed thirty years ago, and had remained in secluded cultivation ever since.</p><p>Although the Xie family had also joined the Three Doctrines Alliance, Qin Sang, engrossed in his cultivation, paid little attention to the details of the pact.</p><p>Qin Sang's disguised form, having contributed to the demon slaying efforts, could easily put in a good word for the Water Mirror Seven Islands.</p><p>…</p><p>As Qin Sang's disguised form journeyed far and wide, acquiring treasure after treasure, the necessary spiritual materials gradually came together.</p><p>His true body remained in Deerfield, intending to resume the "Celestial Demon Body Refinement."</p><p>Unexpectedly, while sensing the Unborn Demonic Seal within him, Qin Sang felt a strange stirring.</p>
