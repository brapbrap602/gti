<h1>Chapter 405: The Fat Chicken</h1><p>Chapter 405: The Fat Chicken</p><p>Since beginning his cultivation of the *Yuanshen Yangjian Zhang*, Qin Sang has focused on collecting as many spirit woods as possible, content with simply ensuring that his Ebony Sword isn't held back by his cultivation.</p><p>He treated the secrets Yun Youzi shared as mere legends, never daring to hope for more.</p><p>The Ten Great Spirit Woods existed only in legend; at least, not something a Foundation Establishment cultivator like him could aspire to.</p><p>Perhaps after forming his Golden Core, he might dare to consider it.</p><p>Fate, however, presented him with a piece of one of the Ten Great Spirit Woods!</p><p>Qin Sang gazed at the Bloodwood with rapt fascination, sensing the potent aura of the Wu Jian Blood Mulberry, and could only think, "The name befits the reality!"</p><p>This piece of Wu Jian Blood Mulberry was clearly unrefined.</p><p>If the Ebony Sword could absorb this wood, it would undoubtedly be reborn, instantly ascending to the rank of a magical treasure, and also gain a powerful divine ability.</p><p>Qin Sang suppressed his eagerness, forcing his gaze away from the Wu Jian Blood Mulberry and toward the other half of the jade pool.</p><p>There, amidst the lava-like crimson "water," a stark white root extended from within.  The slender root was as white as jade, clearly no ordinary thing.</p><p>However, the stem and leaves were gone, leaving only a section of the main root standing alone in the pool; the broken end showed clear signs of being gnawed!</p><p>At this sight, Qin Sang's eyes narrowed. After a moment's thought, he took a step forward, then suddenly sensed something and looked up towards the thunder orb.</p><p>He saw that the thunder within the orb surged, and several thin bolts of lightning broke free!</p><p>After leaving the orb, these hair-thin bolts instantly expanded to the thickness of a man's arm.  With deafening thunder, they struck fiercely at Qin Sang's hiding place.</p><p>The cave shook, the lightning dazzling.</p><p>Qin Sang seemed prepared. He pushed off the ground and retreated explosively.</p><p>However, as he moved, a strong wind arose from his right.  He caught a glimpse of a silvery, round shadow darting towards him—a shadow that moved like lightning, eerily familiar.</p><p>Thunder Escape!</p><p>Qin Sang immediately recalled the scene he'd witnessed earlier: the Swallowing Thunder Hawk using Thunder Escape, using only its physical body to force the black-robed man out of hiding.</p><p>Qin Sang thought, "So that's it!"</p><p>Upon seeing the jade pool and the thunder orb, and the white fragments within the orb, he found the arrangement strange, like some kind of nest, incubating something.</p><p>Coupled with the gnawed remains of the unknown spirit herb...</p><p>Qin Sang was almost certain: a Swallowing Thunder Hawk chick was hidden in the cave!</p><p>He knew that the Swallowing Thunder Hawk's Thunder Eyes could see through invisibility.</p><p>No wonder the Swallowing Thunder Hawk had risked its life to stop the two Nascent Soul experts—it was protecting its young. The remaining fragments in the thunder orb suggested that the chick had recently hatched, so Qin Sang wasn't overly fearful.</p><p>But what Qin Sang didn't expect was that the Swallowing Thunder Hawk chick could actually manipulate the lightning within the thunder orb, and its strength far exceeded his expectations!</p><p>"Rise!"</p><p>At this point, Qin Sang had only just dodged the attack from the thunder orb, his strength depleted, unable to dodge further, he could only fight.</p><p>Qin Sang roared, activating the long-prepared Ten Directions Yama Formation.</p><p>Facing the Swallowing Thunder Hawk's Thunder Escape, he dared not be careless; the black-robed man's fate was a stark warning—even a Nascent Soul cultivator couldn't withstand the power of the Swallowing Thunder Hawk's Thunder Escape.</p><p>The formation had barely unfolded, its banners shielding Qin Sang, when the Swallowing Thunder Hawk used Thunder Escape, narrowly colliding with the formation.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The Ten Directions Yama Formation's Yin energy and the Thunder Escape collided; the Yin energy and lightning devoured each other, and the formation showed signs of collapse.</p><p>Within the formation, the ghost banners fluttered wildly, their surfaces rustling.</p><p>The main spirit roared, its voice shaking the cave, resisting the impact of the Thunder Escape with all its might.</p><p>Qin Sang, within the formation, groaned, his blood churning, his body reeling back several steps before barely regaining his footing.  He hastily stabilized the formation, secretly shocked.</p><p>When the aftershocks dissipated, Qin Sang, hiding within the Ten Directions Yama Formation, dared not reveal himself.  Through the gaps in the Yin energy, he saw a hawk-like creature standing on one leg at the edge of the jade pool.</p><p>This hawk was not majestic; it looked more like a fat chicken.</p><p>Its feathers lacked a bright sheen, instead a mass of fluffy, pale yellow down covered its body, even its tiny beak was a soft yellow.  A small piece of white eggshell was held in its beak.</p><p>The chick, plump and fluffy, resembled a small yellow ball of fur, entirely lacking any menace; it was rather cute.</p><p>‘Cackle… cackle…’</p><p>Its little beak moved.</p><p>A crisp crunching sound echoed in the cave.  The eggshell, unharmed by the thunderball, proved remarkably fragile in the chick's beak, easily crushed.</p><p>‘Cheep… cheep…’</p><p>The chick was crunching the eggshell when it suddenly widened its eyes, its tiny claws gripping the jade pool as it let out a sharp squawk.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression changed slightly, becoming subtly alert. He then saw it turn its head and peck at the spirit spring behind it.  Then, lifting its neck high, it hopped, vigorously flapping its small, disproportionate wings.</p><p>After a moment of throat-pumping, it swallowed the eggshell mixed with spring water.  Its chirps became noticeably cheerful.</p><p>Qin Sang stared, dumbfounded.  Was it choking?</p><p>Consuming its food with spirit spring water?  How extravagant!</p><p>After swallowing the eggshell, the chick seemed relaxed, contentedly tilting its head. Its round eyes held a trace of naivety and curiosity as it openly observed Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang had a feeling it considered him a plaything.</p><p>Seeing its adorable clumsiness, who would imagine it would eventually grow into the magnificent Thunder Swallow Falcon, powerfully battling two Yuan Ying cultivators, displaying incredible might?</p><p>Qin Sang twitched the corner of his mouth.  The Thunder Swallow Falcon's chick actually looked like *this*!</p><p>Its appearance clearly indicated it had just hatched.</p><p>Most people would have their hearts melted by the chick's endearingly large eyes.  However, Qin Sang didn't find the chick cute at all; he found it terrifying.</p><p>Despite having just hatched, this chick already possessed the peak cultivation of the Yaoling stage, no less powerful than Yu Hua!</p><p>This was normal.  Powerful spirit beasts, blessed by heaven, are born with terrifying strength.</p><p>Furthermore, the spirit herbs grown in the Thunder Swallow Falcon's cave were certainly no ordinary plants; likely meticulously prepared for the chick.  The chick consuming them and breaking through to the peak Yaoling stage was unsurprising.</p><p>Peak Yaoling stage wasn't necessarily fearsome; the chick was clearly very young.  In actual combat, it wouldn't be able to utilize its full strength.</p><p>What was truly frightening was its ability to manipulate the power of the thunderball!</p><p>The thunderball was undoubtedly left behind by the adult Thunder Swallow Falcon to incubate and protect its young.  The chick's control over the thunderball meant even a Golden Core cultivator would need to be cautious in its presence.</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze moved past the chick to the Seamless Blood Mulberry lying in the spirit spring.</p><p>He clenched his fist; the demonic fire within his Red Pill was nearly half-consumed.  He didn't have much time left; he had to leave before the demonic fire burned out, or he would be trapped in the cave forever.</p><p>He wondered how the adult Thunder Swallow Falcon would deal with him upon its return.</p><p>Becoming the chick's food or toy were both outcomes Qin Sang desperately hoped to avoid.</p>
