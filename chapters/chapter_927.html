<h1>Chapter 919: Corpse Refinement Technique</h1><p>Chapter 919: Corpse Refinement Technique</p><p>A miasma of Yin energy permeated the swamp.</p><p>Countless creatures had been swallowed by the swamp, nurturing this vast expanse of extreme Yin.  The outer edges of the swamp had weaker Yin energy, but the spiritual energy was more abundant than elsewhere. However, unless one practiced ghost cultivation techniques that utilized Yin energy, few would establish their cultivation cave here.  Deep within the swamp, thick Yin energy lingered, devouring all life, leaving few living creatures—similar to the Yin煞 Abyss of the Kuiyin Sect.</p><p>In this desolate place, a stone tower stood, half-submerged and half-floating.</p><p>Three figures hovered before it.</p><p>A large pit had opened in the swamp below, with the surrounding black mud closing in on the center.  Rotten mud, black and yellow, was churned up, emitting a foul stench. The indescribable scene was enough to make one retch.</p><p>A cultivator with a square face stood before the tower.  His complexion was ashen, his left hand hidden in his sleeve, trembling uncontrollably, though he forcefully suppressed it with his True Qi.</p><p>“Impressive technique!”</p><p>The square-faced cultivator clenched his fist, his face contorted in anger. “Fine! Luo accepts defeat. The Corpse Refinement Technique is yours!”</p><p>With a flick of his sleeve, he sent a stream of light towards his opponents, containing a jade slip.</p><p>Two figures stood opposite him, one behind the other, both masked with ghostly visages. Though not magical treasures, the masks were top-tier artifacts. Even the black-robed cultivator, a formidable Golden Core stage expert, couldn’t penetrate the masks with his divine sense to see their faces.</p><p>“Thank you, Daoist friend.”</p><p>The foremost figure caught the jade slip, scanned its contents with his divine sense, a hint of delight in his tone. He then tossed back another jade slip.  “We apologize for any offense. We will uphold our promise and not leak your Corpse Refinement Technique. In exchange, this is a corpse cultivation secret technique I previously acquired. It might be helpful to you. Farewell!”</p><p>Before the words faded, the two figures soared into the air, disappearing without a backward glance.</p><p>Moments later, several cultivators emerged from the stone tower, landing behind the square-faced cultivator. Their expressions were resentful and defiant. “Master, why did you let them go?”</p><p>The square-faced cultivator’s face darkened.  “Not let them go? Should we have kept them? Didn’t you see? That person matched me blow for blow in swordsmanship alone. The person behind him seemed even stronger, possibly a late Golden Core stage cultivator.”</p><p>“Late Golden Core!”</p><p>The disciples were shocked.</p><p>Another disciple spoke, “But Master, you haven’t fully activated the formation. Even a late Golden Core cultivator couldn't easily break through Master’s Nether Corpse Formation. Besides, Master’s main Nether Corpse is comparable to a Golden Core cultivator. If we hold out, Elder Mao will arrive with reinforcements…”</p><p>Upon hearing this, the square-faced cultivator’s expression worsened. He coldly snorted,  “Look at where they stood—precisely the formation's weakest point. This is no coincidence! The Nether Corpse Formation is my own creation; others couldn't possibly know how to break it. That person must be extremely proficient in formations, easily seeing the formation's flaws…”</p><p>The disciples were even more astonished, realizing how dangerous the situation had been.</p><p>“Forget it! They weren't after the core techniques of our Nether Corpse Sect.  Without the core techniques, many secret arts are unusable. The rest is similar to other corpse cultivation sects' techniques. Giving it to him is fine. Besides, this technique he gave me seems quite valuable. After I understand it, I might be able to improve the Nether Corpse Formation…”</p><p>The square-faced cultivator gradually calmed down and returned to the stone tower.</p><p>…</p><p>Meanwhile, the two figures had already flown beyond the swamp: Qin Sang and his clone.</p><p>For over a decade, Bai Zhongqiu and his wife, following Qin Sang’s orders, had discreetly investigated renowned corpse cultivators on the Liefeng Islands.</p><p>Qin Sang selected those he could reasonably approach and visited them, exchanging knowledge on corpse refinement techniques and corpse cultivation insights.</p><p>The jade slip Qin Sang gave them didn’t contain the *Heavenly Yin Corpse Manual*, but another incomplete corpse cultivation technique he'd obtained in the Xiao Han Domain.</p><p>Incomplete cultivation techniques weren't rare in the Xiao Han Domain; most were ancient cultivation inheritances unearthed from the ancient Immortal battlefield, still valuable enough for fellow corpse cultivators to learn from.</p><p>Therefore, Qin Sang used this to trade, and coupled with his and his clone's strength, the exchange was quite smooth.</p><p>Qin Sang's actions served a dual purpose: to find a way to unravel the Heavenly Corpse Talisman, and to seek inspiration from other necromantic techniques, hoping to unlock the later stages of the *Heavenly Yin Corpse Scripture*.</p><p>While working for the trading house in the Demon Sea, Qin Sang had been diligently collecting such techniques – purchasing some with spirit stones, others obtained through force in the treacherous Riftwind Archipelago.</p><p>Cultivators who manage to gain a foothold in the Riftwind Archipelago are all quite capable.  Several of the necromantic techniques Qin Sang acquired possessed unique merits.</p><p>Unfortunately, none followed a path similar to the *Heavenly Yin Corpse Scripture*.</p><p>Among these techniques were some capable of creating flying night demons, but all required lengthy corpse nurturing and refinement processes, along with various stringent conditions, making them no easier than a typical cultivator's core formation.</p><p>His external incarnation already consumed significant resources and energy; he couldn't afford to divert attention to corpse cultivation.</p><p>For over a decade, Qin Sang relentlessly focused on strengthening his incarnation, finally breaking through to the late Core Formation stage not long ago.  Achieving this level in less than thirty years would fill other cultivators with envy.</p><p>But for Qin Sang, it was still too slow.</p><p>From the information he'd gathered, the Seven Killing Hall would open in seven or eight years, insufficient time for his incarnation to reach peak Core Formation. A faster method was necessary.</p><p>The good news was that his cultivation of the *Heavenly Demon Refining Form* proceeded smoothly, breaking through to the mid-third stage ten years ago, keeping pace with his cultivation base.</p><p>Though the rate of improvement slowed thereafter, Qin Sang's immunity to star煞 meant his progress still far outpaced others.</p><p>He even considered taking a Dominating Blood Fruit before the Seven Killing Hall opened to attempt a breakthrough to the late-third stage.</p><p>"冥尸…"</p><p>Landing in a safe location, Qin Sang had his incarnation act as a guard while he focused on studying the newly acquired necromantic technique.</p><p>"The necromantic techniques of the冥尸宗 are indeed unlike others, but require cultivation of a unique冥阴energy beforehand.  No wonder this person readily handed it over!"</p><p>Qin Sang retracted his divine sense, letting out a soft sigh.</p><p>Aside from the冥阴energy, this technique was not significantly different from others, offering no help in deciphering the Heavenly Corpse Talisman.</p><p>"There are still a few people I haven't contacted, but there's no time.  The Wind Hidden Island auction is about to begin; I must obtain the jade pendant granting access to the Seven Killing Hall.  It seems I'll have to use those precious spirit materials obtained from that person in Black Serpent Mountain…"</p><p>Qin Sang pondered for a moment before heading west.</p>
