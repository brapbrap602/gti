Chapter 1836: The Chase


A sudden, unstoppable change.

Although unsure of the nature of this fluctuation, Qin Sang could guess a few things, instinctively sensing trouble.

Lightning flashed.

Qin Sang turned and rushed towards Zi Jiaren.

Zi Jiaren was within the black sea of fire, enduring the siege of the four Jiao Serpents.

The two demons only had one jade bracelet, held by the shorter one. Qin Sang's choice was to first trap Zi Jiaren with Demonic Fire and the Four Jiao Serpent Seal, leaving one alive to personally slay the other.

Unfortunately, despite meticulous planning, the situation took a sharp turn for the worse.

‘Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!’

Waves of fire surged, continuously rushing towards Zi Jiaren, unexpectedly forming a fiery mound within the sea of flames.

The Jiao Serpents thrashed their heads and tails, spewing frigid air. The cold air and Demonic Fire intertwined without conflict, creating a bizarre spectacle.

The frigid air condensed into ice mountains, and the flames burned within the ice.  Zi Jiaren, trapped within the mountains, became a caged beast.

At the instant of the attack, a string of wooden beads hanging from Zi Jiaren's neck flew up.

The wooden beads shimmered with golden light, their material exceptionally peculiar.

As they rose, all the beads on the string rapidly expanded, like strung-together boulders, each bead containing power comparable to a mountain.

It was as if several mountain peaks were colliding at once.

Zi Jiaren attempted to use this treasure to smash a path through the frigid air and Demonic Fire.

But though the wooden beads were strong, how could they be a match for a spirit treasure? Moreover, Zi Jiaren's cultivation was already a level lower than Qin Sang's.

The Jiao Serpents locked onto the wooden beads, and frigid air surged forth, instantly transforming the area into the depths of winter. Amidst cracking sounds, a layer of glistening frost quickly formed on the surface of the wooden beads, thickening at a visible rate.

The beads' precious light dimmed, their momentum visibly slowing, seemingly about to be completely frozen.

Seeing the terrifying frigid air spreading past the wooden beads, Zi Jiaren's face was filled with terror as the purple armor on his body radiated a dazzling purple light.

Tiny vortexes formed in his purple pupils, and purple light, like water, rapidly spun and expanded outwards.

In an instant, the vortexes detached from his pupils, spreading out in rings of purple ripples, as if trying to absorb the surrounding space.

The center of the vortexes targeted the four Jiao Serpents, and a strange power emanated, rushing towards the frigid air.

When the vortex continued to expand, encompassing the wooden beads, purple light diffused over their surface. The previously dimmed precious light suddenly brightened, their momentum surging as they slammed against the ice layer.

Amidst booming sounds, cracks appeared in the ice, but the four Jiao Serpents, vigorous and unaffected, continued to spew frigid air, constructing their prison.

Meanwhile, Zi Jiaren's form shifted, transforming into a harrier eagle. The eagle was covered in purple feathers, majestic and extraordinary, its hawk eyes particularly bright.

‘Poof!’

The harrier eagle spat out a mouthful of vital essence blood, which merged with the purple armor, unleashing the treasure's full potential.

With a flap of its purple wings, the harrier eagle transformed into a purple lightning bolt.

Wooden beads, bloodline divine ability, vital essence blood merging with armor, demonic form – Zi Jiaren had exhausted all his strength, making a desperate gamble.

But Zi Jiaren could never have imagined that his companion would be so weak, becoming a soul under the sword in the blink of an eye!

‘Boom!’

The purple vortex permeating the void suddenly trembled violently, its rippling edges shattering as if struck by a heavy blow.

Within the fragmented ripples, a palm suddenly appeared, carrying unimaginable pressure, descending from the sky!

At this moment, Zi Jiaren's mind was shaken, his terror amplified, feeling as if the sky was collapsing, and he was the only living creature beneath it, with nowhere to escape!

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

The Jiao Serpents roared excitedly, unanimously spewing frigid flames, erupting in a blinding cold light.  Boundless chill merged with the descending palm.

All Zi Jiaren saw was a deep blue sun, heavily smashing onto the wooden beads!

Under Zi Jiaren’s horrified gaze, the wooden beads exploded, deflating as if their air had been let out, reverting to their original form. The entire string of beads was scattered, each bead flying in all directions amidst the raging frigid flames.

Immediately afterwards, a figure stepped out from the frigid flames, instantly closing in on Zi Jiaren.

Zi Jiaren was horrified. In the next moment, everything in his vision vanished, filled with blue light, sword light, and overwhelmingly powerful vital energy, rushing towards him.

In despair, he could only fully activate his purple armor, but it was to no avail.

‘Crack!’

Fragments flew as he was pierced on the spot.

The Four Jiao Serpent Seal, the Seven Souls Killing Formation, and the Great Vajra Wheel Seal!

Qin Sang didn’t dare delay for even a moment, unleashing three ultimate techniques at once, overcoming the demon's divine ability and treasure in one fell swoop.

The earth trembled with a rumbling sound, and dust and smoke billowed.

The purple light dissipated.

Within the smoke, a deep crater appeared in the ground. Qin Sang held the harrier eagle by the neck with one hand, driving it directly into the earth!

The harrier eagle's eyes rolled back, its breath weak. It wasn't dead, but it was completely powerless, unable even to self-destruct.

Qin Sang spared the harrier eagle's life, his gaze sharp, fixed on its eyes. "Speak! What is the purpose of the fluctuation emitted by his corpse!"

The harrier eagle regained consciousness, but didn’t answer Qin Sang's question, instead snarling, "You dare…"

Before he could finish, Qin Sang frowned, True Essence surging into the harrier eagle's body, locking onto its spirit. Amidst the harrier eagle’s shrill screams, he performed a soul search.

Soul searching was a last resort, something Qin Sang was reluctant to do if the harrier eagle cooperated.

The higher the opponent's cultivation, the more difficult the soul search, and whether or not he obtained crucial information depended entirely on luck.

With the situation urgent, he didn't have time to tame the harrier eagle and could only resort to soul searching.

A moment later, Qin Sang withdrew his hand, his expression grim.

The memory fragments obtained from the soul search contained a few pieces related to the matter, but they didn’t reveal the whole picture. He could only勉强 piece together the general story.

The fluctuation emitted after the other Demon Marquis's death was a warning technique.  When they separated from Fu Hou, they took the jade bracelet and left behind a soul mark. If their true body perished, the soul mark would immediately react and locate their true body’s position.

The moment Qin Sang killed this demon, he had exposed himself.  Fu Hou and the other demons were likely already on their way.

He slightly raised his head, looking towards the seemingly peaceful mountains and wilderness in the distance.

Unsure how far away they were, Qin Sang now needed to consider where to escape.

If it were only Demon Marquises, he wouldn’t be afraid.

But this matter involved a Demon King!

From some of the memory fragments, he could glean a little about the cause of this incident.

In the harrier eagle’s memory, they were summoned urgently by Ling Yue Wang.  Almost all the experts under Ling Yue Wang had been mobilized, and along the way, other Demon Marquises, attracted by the hefty reward, had joined the chase.

It seemed someone had infiltrated Ling Yue Wang's territory, done something to enrage him, and triggered this pursuit.

Moreover, Ling Yue Wang had recently fought a great battle with a Daoist in the Nie Yuan. The Daoist was also a Void Refinement expert, possibly the one providing support.

Unfortunately, the memory fragments regarding this battle were too brief. The outcome of the fight between the two mighty figures was unclear, but since these Demon Marquises had chased all the way here, it was highly likely that Ling Yue Wang had the upper hand.

Learning this, Qin Sang became even more tense.  No one knew whether his actions would attract the Demon King.

He could only hope that Ling Yue Wang was still entangled with that Daoist expert.

He had to escape!

But how could he escape?

Unknowingly, he had stumbled into their encirclement, with Demon Marquises scattered all around.

This was truly an unexpected disaster. Qin Sang was inwardly annoyed, most worried that the soul mark had other functions, such as sensing the aura of its enemy.

"This matter originated in Ling Yue Wang's territory and has nothing to do with the Ju Shan Zhi Altar. The vicinity of the altar should be safe…"

Qin Sang's thoughts raced.

Turning back was definitely too late.  He had originally worried that the Dao Court and the Ghost Fang Kingdom had resumed their conflict over the altar, and that there would definitely be Void Refinement experts guarding outside, making it impossible to return.

As long as it didn't involve the Ju Shan Zhi Altar, he had a way out.

His only option now was to escape into the altar to ensure absolute safety.

Void Refinement experts wouldn’t dare enter the altar. No matter how many Demon Marquises were sent after him, he wouldn’t fear them.

In an instant, countless thoughts flashed through Qin Sang’s mind.  Making his decision, the Demonic Fire suddenly expanded, incinerating everything around him, obliterating any traces.  Then, Qin Sang grabbed the harrier eagle, summoned his escape light, and flew northeast.

That was the direction of the Ju Shan Zhi Altar.

During the soul search, Qin Sang had held back, preserving the harrier eagle's remnant soul for another purpose.

Activating his Thunder Escape, using only three-tenths of his power, Qin Sang made no attempt at concealment.  Lightning pierced the sky, thunder echoing through the mountains before quickly fading away.

…

Not long after Qin Sang left, a streak of rainbow light pierced the sky, landing at the edge of the battlefield, revealing three figures.

The one in the middle had a high nose bridge, a hairless head, a high forehead, long earlobes, and a rather peculiar appearance. It was Fu Hou, the foremost Demon Marquis under Ling Yue Wang.

“This is where Chai Hou fell,” Fu Hou said, his eyes glinting coldly.  He only saw devastation, but he could determine from the void’s fluctuations that it wasn't the work of a Grand True Man.

The person to his left said in a low voice, “The Listening Conch was in Chai Hou’s possession. Chai Hou died first, and the conch shattered later. It was likely crushed by the enemy. I wonder if Chai Hou didn’t have time to crush the Listening Conch, or if there’s another reason.”

Fu Hou surveyed the battlefield.  "Is Zi Hou still alive?"

The person nodded. "The soul mark indicates that Zi Hou is heading northeast, constantly moving…"

He hesitated for a moment, then said tentatively, “Could it be that the two fellow Daoists were careless during their hunt, allowing the murderer to counterattack?  Is Zi Hou currently pursuing the murderer?”

Fu Hou snorted coldly. “Chai Hou has always been cautious.  If it were a certain victory, he would never have taken such a risk. Zi Hou must have been captured alive. The murderer’s strength is considerable, and they likely already know the secret of the soul mark, yet deliberately took Zi Hou away.  They must have other motives!”

“Master is wise!”

The person bowed in subservience, feigning contemplation. “According to Master’s analysis, the murderer deliberately used Zi Hou to lure us over, then escaped in another direction?  The direction Zi Hou is going is towards the Ju Shan Zhi Altar.  Following conventional reasoning, we would naturally assume the murderer entered the altar to seek refuge… Fortunately, Master is discerning, otherwise we would have truly fallen for the murderer’s trick!”


“Regardless of whether it's a decoy or not, we must first rescue Zi Hou to understand the situation! Send a message to Gu and Ying to gather their forces and lead teams to block off other directions.  We absolutely cannot let the murderer escape!”

“As you command!”

Fu Hou memorized every detail of the battlefield, then transformed into rainbow light and flew away, following the direction indicated by the soul mark.

The two demons quickly followed.

…


Elsewhere.

Qin Sang concealed his aura, moving silently through the mountains and wilderness.  Although not comparable to the Thunder Escape technique, his speed was still considerable.

Leaping over a mountain range, Qin Sang suddenly stopped and flicked his finger, releasing a black dog, one of the remaining puppets.

Ordering the black dog to carry the barely alive harrier eagle, Qin Sang continued his flight without pause.

The black dog, following its orders, ran with the harrier eagle in its mouth, deviating slightly from Qin Sang's direction, but still heading northeast, as if competing with its master.

Qin Sang didn't look back, quickly vanishing from sight.


After a while, Fu Hou arrived, immediately spotting the black dog. A single glance froze the black dog in place, but the potent poison hidden within its mouth instantly erupted.

The harrier eagle's remnant soul perished from the poison.


Fu Hou exhausted all methods but couldn't save the harrier eagle's life. Obtaining no useful information from the black dog, the killing intent in his eyes intensified.

The two demons behind him flew with all their might, barely keeping up. Seeing Fu Hou’s expression, they couldn't help but tremble, carefully reporting, “Gu and Ying have already set up a dragnet, tightening it step by step.  As long as the murderer tries to escape in those directions, they will definitely be trapped!”

Fu Hou scanned all directions.  The encirclement was closing towards the north, with only two openings remaining: due north and northeast.


When did the murderer separate from Zi Hou, and where did their true body escape to?

According to his previous deduction, he should pursue north.


But was the harrier eagle truly just a diversion? What if the murderer had anticipated their thoughts?

The harrier eagle had clearly been subjected to a soul search, making the murderer’s intentions impossible to predict. Either choice carried risk.


Fu Hou glanced towards the altar, ultimately deciding to personally pursue north.

Experts were always stationed outside the altar, and he had specifically arranged for reinforcements to move closer to it. They could at least stall for a while.


And if the murderer fled north, they had a chance to break through the encirclement!

With his decision made, Fu Hou immediately set off.


Meanwhile, Qin Sang was getting closer and closer to the altar.


Familiar scenery came into view.  Ahead, all was calm.


Beneath the calmness, there might be hidden currents, but Qin Sang still breathed a sigh of relief. There were no celestial phenomena near the altar.

The Demon King wasn't here!

As he gradually approached, he used his Divine Eye to detect several hidden auras.


There was an ambush, as expected!


Qin Sang was not surprised. This was within his expectations.


The altar was the best hiding place, so the demons were sure to have made arrangements.

Qin Sang had never expected smooth sailing. Leaving the harrier eagle behind would force them to divide their forces, weakening the defenses here.


He mentally calculated the distance.

Suddenly, Qin Sang erupted from the forest, his Phoenix Wings unleashing a thunderbolt that tore through the void, charging towards the auspicious clouds!


The moment Qin Sang appeared, several powerful auras erupted from the valley outside the altar.


One of them was particularly powerful, belonging to a late-stage Nascent Soul demon!


This demon surpassed the others, swiftly intercepting Qin Sang, shouting, "Halt!"

As he flew, Qin Sang saw the enemy's appearance clearly.  It was a delicate woman with average looks, clad in light armor, her aura no less potent than Xia Hou's.


Besides the demoness, the others were insignificant.

Qin Sang quickly scanned the demons.  With his strength, if he entangled with this woman, he might have a chance to take down a few more.

But he would never gamble his life on it.

‘Swish!’

‘Crack!’


The two were like colliding comets. Just as they were about to crash into each other, a torrential crimson light surged from within the lightning.

Seeing the nine Solar Divine Birds flying towards her, the demoness’s expression changed drastically. Her forward momentum faltered as she hurriedly deployed her divine abilities to defend, dodging repeatedly.

Qin Sang, however, didn't even glance at her, increasing his speed by another three-tenths, heading straight for the altar.

His path was clear.

Just as Qin Sang’s mind slightly relaxed, a cold snort suddenly echoed in his ears, and a terrifying pressure instantly descended.


Qin Sang's blood seemed to freeze, his hair standing on end. He looked up in horror.

He saw that the southern sky had become covered in dark clouds at some point. Within the clouds, a gigantic shadow appeared, blotting out the sun as it approached!
