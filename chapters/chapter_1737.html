<h1>Chapter 1728: Thunder Turtle</h1><p>The storm belt was a realm of perpetual darkness.</p><p>Qin Sang flew forward alone, with no one to converse with.</p><p>It was as if he were the only being left in the world, surrounded by the howling wind and the eerie demonic whispers of the Heavenly Dao. He felt like he was trapped in an endless hell, enveloped by an immeasurable loneliness, forever unable to see an end.</p><p>Soaring through the storm, Qin Sang's figure appeared small and fragile, a negligible black dot against the gray curtain wall. Any single hurricane could swallow him whole, carrying him to an unknown fate.</p><p>His figure flickered in and out of existence. Just as it seemed a hurricane had consumed him, he would reappear ahead in the next instant.  It turned out he hadn't been swept away, but had merely grazed the edge of the hurricane with an exquisite display of movement skill, refined to the utmost peak.</p><p>Back when he and Liuli piloted the Ten Directions Earth-Splitting Shuttle, they wouldn't have dared such recklessness.  Only a Nascent Soul cultivator could navigate this chaos with such ease.</p><p>He had repeated this maneuver countless times, making it almost instinctive.</p><p>Most of his attention wasn't on dodging the hurricanes.</p><p>His right arm was raised and held horizontally across his chest. A dagger-sized spirit sword, the Gray Warbler Sword, danced between his fingertips.</p><p>The Gray Warbler Sword, like its master, appeared and vanished erratically. When the sword's shadow disappeared, a small patch of space in Qin Sang's palm suddenly became chaotic and indistinct, shimmering with tiny points of light, as though he held a miniature starry sky in his hand.</p><p>Clearly, Qin Sang was comprehending the Seven Lunar Mansions Sword Formation.</p><p>The starry sky in his palm was merely a phenomenon manifested during his comprehension, but it was more complete than when he had trapped and killed the Great Sage of the妖 clan, already exhibiting an aura of profound immensity.</p><p>For twenty years, aside from the time spent on recuperation, he had wasted not a single second. He cycled through various secret arts and formulas, making progress in each.</p><p>However, his physical body wasn't strong enough yet. The Seven Teachers Buddha Seal and the Inner Lion Seal wouldn't significantly enhance his combat prowess, unlike the Seven Lunar Mansions Sword Formation, which offered immediate results. Therefore, Qin Sang prioritized comprehending the sword formation.</p><p>The sword's shadow flickered.</p><p>As Qin Sang experienced the cycle of stellar birth and death, feeling the profound transformations of the sword formation, he was almost lost in its intricacies. Suddenly, his heart stirred, jolting him awake.</p><p>His expression shifted slightly, his eyes flashing with sharp light as he abruptly looked up.</p><p>The surrounding scenery offered nothing new. As far as the eye could see, there were only gray hurricanes encircling him.</p><p>Between heaven and earth, the distant void was a deep abyss. The towering waves churned up by the hurricanes were the only real things he could perceive.</p><p>There were no human figures, no birds, no fish, no beasts, not even a single island.</p><p>What had caused the disturbance?</p><p>Qin Sang stared ahead for a long time, as though sensing something. His expression gradually grew grave, but he didn't stop, only restraining his aura.</p><p>Soon, the deafening wind carried the faint rumble of thunder.</p><p>Thunder was not uncommon here.</p><p>Wind and thunder had always been companions. Over the years, Qin Sang had often seen dragon-like bolts of lightning coursing through the storm. But this thunder was different from heavenly thunder!</p><p>The instant he heard the thunder, Qin Sang's heart pounded fiercely. A chill ran down his spine as he instinctively sensed danger!</p><p>"Could it be a ferocious beast?"</p><p>Qin Sang's expression flickered.</p><p>This was his twenty-fourth year in the storm belt, and the first time he had encountered any sign of a ferocious beast. Perhaps it was because he was getting closer to the Returning Ruins.</p><p>Back then, the two Nascent Soul cultivators had led the hunt for ferocious beasts, searching their souls after killing them.</p><p>The ferocious beasts had lost their sanity, driven completely mad by the demonic whispers of the Heavenly Dao, and hadn't yielded any useful information.  Experience had proven that provoking ferocious beasts was a losing proposition.</p><p>But Qin Sang always believed in seeing for himself. If possible, he desperately wanted to hunt a ferocious beast himself, preferably capturing it alive.</p><p>Hunting ferocious beasts in the storm belt was actually very disadvantageous for cultivators.  This place was far from the cultivation world, and there were no nearby refuges. During combat, one couldn't unleash their full power.</p><p>Especially now, with the Heavenly Dao changing, ferocious beasts roamed everywhere.  He had to conserve his strength to deal with unforeseen circumstances.</p><p>Qin Sang had one advantage over Sage Hui Guang and Sage Qing Hu: the Jade Buddha shielded him from the demonic whispers of the Heavenly Dao, relieving him of many worries.</p><p>He suddenly stopped, pondered for a moment, and summoned his second Nascent Soul, restoring his Avatar.</p><p>He wasn't summoning his Avatar for assistance.</p><p>Although he hadn't seen the ferocious beast yet, Qin Sang could sense a powerful threat, at least at the Nascent Soul level.  His Avatar's strength hadn't fully recovered. It was best to have it stand guard on the periphery, ensuring there weren't any other ferocious beasts nearby, before seizing the opportunity to strike.</p><p>The Avatar nodded at its original body, summoned the Snow-Treading Divine Saber, and held a demonic banner in its other hand, flying in another direction.</p><p>Qin Sang flickered and flew straight towards the source of the thunderous sound.</p><p>The thunder grew increasingly clear.</p><p>Finally, Qin Sang heard it clearly.  It wasn't thunder at all, but the roar of a ferocious beast. However, as he approached the beast, he saw that there really was lightning.</p><p>Within the dark storm, a bright mass of lightning was particularly conspicuous.</p><p>Qin Sang focused his Heavenly Eye divine ability and finally saw the ferocious beast at the center of the lightning.</p><p>This ferocious beast's innate divine ability was definitely related to lightning.  It was constantly surrounded by bolts of electricity. Its body was shaped like a turtle, round, but larger than any demonic turtle Qin Sang had ever seen.</p><p>Its neck was long and slender, like a snake attached to a turtle shell. It had no legs, only a short, pointed tail.</p><p>Looking closely, he realized it didn't actually have a shell. Instead, silver-white lightning formed a net of thunder, covering its body like a suit of lightning armor.</p><p>Qin Sang remembered seeing records of a similar ferocious beast in ancient texts.</p><p>Although not a demonic turtle, due to its appearance, the ancients had named it the Thunder Turtle. Unfortunately, there were no detailed descriptions of its divine abilities, only that the Thunder Turtle's breath summoned lightning, its movements were as fast as lightning, and its power was unmatched, making it impossible to defeat through brute force.</p><p>However, the Thunder Turtle before Qin Sang was somewhat different.</p><p>Qin Sang noticed that a large chunk of the Thunder Turtle's round body was missing. The gap pulsed with lightning, revealing a gaping wound where flesh was missing, as if a large bite had been taken out of it.</p><p>This was a potentially fatal wound, yet the Thunder Turtle was still alive and kicking, suggesting an old injury.</p><p>Fortunately, it was an old injury. Otherwise, Qin Sang would be considering an immediate retreat. Even facing this wounded Thunder Turtle, he still felt immense pressure and dared not relax.</p><p>What kind of ferocious beast could inflict such a wound on a Thunder Turtle?</p><p>The Returning Ruins truly was a dragon's pool and tiger's den!</p><p>Qin Sang sighed inwardly and, without hesitation, charged towards the Thunder Turtle!</p><p>It was difficult to completely conceal one's presence within the storm belt.  As Qin Sang approached, the Thunder Turtle quickly detected him.</p><p>'Crack!'</p><p>A sudden, startling thunderclap.</p><p>This was the Thunder Turtle's roar. Its slender head snapped around, its blood-red eyes flashing with madness and killing intent.</p><p>In that instant, Qin Sang's vision was filled with a blinding white light as he was engulfed by dazzling lightning. A sense of danger welled up within him.  With a thought, black flames erupted from his body. Without hesitation, he ignited the Fire Lotus, activating the Mani Pearl's罡 fire shield.</p><p>Qin Sang's figure vanished, leaving a black fireball in its place.</p><p>The罡 fire shield and the lightning, one black and one white, formed a stark contrast.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>A bolt of lightning slammed into the罡 fire shield.</p><p>The shield vibrated violently, and even tiny flames were scattered by the impact, but they were instantly replenished by demonic fire, firmly blocking the lightning!</p><p>Qin Sang, sheltered within the罡 fire shield, instantly retreated a thousand zhang, unharmed, but the danger wasn't over.</p><p>Before the lightning dissipated, a dark figure emerged from the radiant light. The Thunder Turtle, almost simultaneously with the arrival of the lightning, rushed towards Qin Sang.  Its terrifying physical body, accompanied by raging thunder, left no doubt that it could crush anything in its path.</p><p>Even more terrifying, as the Thunder Turtle charged, the world seemed to compress around it. Although the lightning was dazzling, it only illuminated the area immediately surrounding the Thunder Turtle. Its body was like a gigantic millstone formed from heavenly thunder, exuding a terrifying aura.</p><p>The howling wind was completely drowned out by the earth-shattering thunder, like collapsing mountains, inspiring fear and trepidation.  And Qin Sang was the 'ant' at the foot of the mountain!</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes flashed. He chose not to clash head-on with the Thunder Turtle.</p><p>The firelight dimmed, and then another bolt of lightning appeared. At the same time the Thunder Turtle charged, this lightning, with no less speed, shot in the opposite direction. This was Qin Sang's Lightning Escape technique.</p><p>With his cultivation breakthrough and improved physical body, Qin Sang could now withstand the backlash of the Azure鸾's lightning power.  Unleashing the escape technique at full power, his speed was naturally unparalleled, likely unmatched among his peers.</p><p>The lightning instantly shot out of the battlefield, disappearing into the vast storm.</p><p>But even this incredible speed couldn't shake off the Thunder Turtle.</p><p>Consumed by madness, once the Thunder Turtle locked onto its prey, it wouldn't let go. Dragging its massive body, it transformed into a pillar of lightning several times larger than Qin Sang, ferociously giving chase.</p><p>Qin Sang's heart sank. This Thunder Turtle, born of lightning, was truly formidable. Even injured, it still possessed such power.  Unless he could trigger its primal fear, it would be very difficult to escape.</p><p>However, he had come prepared. The Thunder Turtle's madness and loss of reason were its greatest weaknesses.</p><p>With this in mind, Qin Sang focused his mind on the Gray Warbler Sword, silently chanting the sword incantation.</p><p>Within the dark storm, two bolts of lightning were in pursuit.</p><p>Suddenly, the smaller lightning bolt in front vanished into thin air. Then, the surrounding space seemed to be covered by a shadow, darker and more desolate than the outside world, enveloping the chasing lightning bolt as well.</p><p>The Seven Lunar Mansions Sword Formation!</p><p>However, Qin Sang had only deployed the formation, not yet unleashed its true power. There was no starlight whatsoever.</p><p>Any cultivator of the same level would have been instantly alerted and would never allow themselves to be enveloped by the sword formation, let alone charge into it willingly. But the Thunder Turtle, filled with madness and killing intent, sensed no mortal threat and charged into the formation without hesitation, just like the manta ray that had been lured into the Five Elements Grand Formation.</p><p>The moment it entered the formation, the Thunder Turtle's surroundings changed dramatically.</p><p>The omnipresent storm vanished, and its prey disappeared.  Sword stars rose all around it.</p><p>Within the sword formation, Qin Sang divided himself into seven Sword Souls, each presiding over a lunar mansion, while his true body remained hidden, silently observing the Thunder Turtle. He manipulated the formation, the scattered stars converging into a river, the entire starry sky revolving around the Thunder Turtle.</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>A sword star flickered, transforming into a sharp sword that pierced towards the Thunder Turtle with razor-sharp sword intent.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The Thunder Turtle roared furiously. It had no patience to slowly search for flaws in the formation.  Still acting on instinct, it opened its mouth and spewed a ball of lightning, shooting straight towards the sword star.</p><p>The next moment, the lightning ball and sword star collided mid-air, starlight and lightning exploding in a dazzling burst, like a great sun igniting in the night sky.</p><p>Then, with a roar, the ferocious Thunder Turtle, its massive body appearing at the site of the explosion, plowed through the remnants of the explosion, smoothing out the aftershocks. Its lightning armor trembled, but it remained unscathed.</p><p>Within the sword formation.</p><p>Qin Sang stood upon a sword star, clearly witnessing this scene. He sighed inwardly at the Thunder Turtle's ferocity, waved his sleeve, and was about to summon more sword stars to attack when his expression suddenly changed. He hastily switched to another sword incantation, his figure flickering and vanishing.</p><p>At this moment, the Thunder Turtle was rampaging through the river of stars like a meteor composed of lightning. Wherever it passed, sword stars shifted, and the starry sky trembled, vividly demonstrating what it meant to overcome skill with brute force.</p><p>Just now, the Thunder Turtle had abruptly changed direction, charging straight towards Qin Sang's true body!</p><p>Qin Sang's expression darkened.  The Thunder Turtle, acting purely on instinct, hadn't been fooled by his Sword Soul clones and had so quickly sensed the location of his true body within the formation.</p><p>This was partly due to his limited time spent comprehending the formation.  He hadn't fully grasped its intricacies, and he had inadvertently revealed a trace of his presence while manipulating the formation. After all, maintaining the formation single-handedly required attending to numerous details.</p><p>But it also demonstrated the Thunder Turtle's acute perception. Before its injury, it must have been at least mid-Nascent Soul!</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The sword star where Qin Sang had just stood was engulfed by a silver-white beam of light, shattering instantly. The Thunder Turtle appeared in its place, its slender head darting around, searching for its prey.</p><p>It didn't notice that as it shattered the sword star, the starry sky transformed.</p><p>Qin Sang had spent so much effort comprehending the Seven Lunar Mansions Sword Formation, and naturally, he wasn't limited to just these few tricks. Many variations had yet to be revealed. This was another aspect of the formation.</p><p>Qin Sang's true body moved constantly between the seven Sword Souls, not merely for concealment.</p><p>Different enemies demanded different strategies. The auras of the seven Sword Souls manifested in the positions of the seven lunar mansions, each appearing as the true one.</p><p>How had his prey multiplied?</p><p>Confusion flickered in the Thunder Turtle's eyes as its head swiveled around, but its madness prevented it from thinking clearly. It immediately chose the closest aura and lunged towards it.</p><p>Everything was within Qin Sang's expectations.  As his thoughts flickered, the starry sky shifted, and the formation transformed drastically.  The Thunder Turtle was charging towards the Kui mansion. The Kui mansion remained stationary while Qin Sang rearranged the other six mansions, completely surrounding the Kui mansion.</p><p>The Thunder Turtle fell into the heart of the river of stars, the stars above it swirling and suddenly becoming incredibly bright. Dazzling starlight converged, forming an intangible sword of light above the Thunder Turtle, plunging straight down!</p><p>'Crack!'</p><p>As expected, the Sword Soul clone that the Thunder Turtle had targeted, along with its sword star, was instantly shattered.  But the power of the rotating sword formation had already manifested in the sword of light.</p><p>The sword intent was world-shaking, its sharpness unparalleled.</p><p>With the sword of light descending, the Thunder Turtle roared, its body flashing with lightning as its lightning armor rapidly expanded.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The resulting shockwave formed a halo that swept outwards in all directions.  All the sword stars of the Kui mansion trembled, as if on the verge of collapse.</p><p>Another enemy might have used this opportunity to discern a flaw in the formation and break free.</p><p>But this was the maddened Thunder Turtle.</p><p>Before the shockwave dissipated, Qin Sang's aura reappeared within the sword formation.  The Thunder Turtle's attention was immediately diverted. With a roar, it turned and charged towards another lunar mansion.</p><p>Within the starry sky, swords of light formed one after another.</p><p>The purpose of this was not just to gradually weaken the Thunder Turtle.</p><p>Qin Sang secretly activated the Poison Pearl.  As the swords of light attacked, wisps of poisonous light separated and merged with them, penetrating the lightning armor during the collisions and silently infiltrating the Thunder Turtle's wounds.</p><p>(End of Chapter)</p>
