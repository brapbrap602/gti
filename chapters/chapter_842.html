<h1>Chapter 834: The Yuan-Restricting Talisman</h1><p>The small pagoda's ferocious assault intensified the pressure on Qin Sang dramatically.  His Nine Nether Demonic Fire flickered erratically, unable to advance and instead suppressed by the crimson glow emanating from the pagoda.  Qin Sang relied on his exceptional swordsmanship to fend off Xiang Yi, his True Yuan draining rapidly.</p><p>Xiang Yi's cultivation far surpassed Qin Sang's.  Relying on brute force, Xiang Yi gradually gained the upper hand, and Qin Sang began to show signs of faltering.</p><p>Despite the assistance of the Two-Headed Hound, Xiang Yi's protective robe was comparable to Qin Sang's Golden Radiance Armor.  With the help of these two extraordinary treasures, Xiang Yi could easily escape if he truly desired.</p><p>The failure of the Blood Defilement Divine Light meant Qin Sang's ambush plan had fallen apart.</p><p>He had to pour all his effort into stalling Xiang Yi until Lady Liu could activate the Yuan-Restricting Talisman.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>Xiang Yi suddenly flung out a talisman.</p><p>The talisman shattered, releasing a stream of vibrant light.</p><p>Qin Sang felt a surge of caution as the burst of light transformed the surrounding vast ocean into a lush jungle.</p><p>The jungle was verdant, with a light mist and the scent of vegetation.</p><p>Along with the scenery, Xiang Yi's figure also vanished.</p><p>"An Illusion Talisman?"</p><p>Qin Sang's heart stirred. He activated the Skyeye Butterfly, and his gaze pierced through the illusion's disguise.  To his surprise, he discovered a dozen Xiang Yi phantoms within, attempting to break out in various directions.</p><p>The talisman was potent, and Xiang Yi's method of creating these phantoms was peculiar, making them appear remarkably lifelike.</p><p>This tactic might deceive others, but under the Skyeye Butterfly's gaze, it was transparent. Qin Sang easily located Xiang Yi's true form.</p><p>He didn't act rashly, instead mentally contacting the Two-Headed Hound.</p><p>The Two-Headed Hound hesitated, whining softly, showing a degree of reluctance.  However, it dared not disobey.  With a flicker, it left behind a phantom to distract Xiang Yi while its true form stealthily circled around to intercept Xiang Yi's escape route.</p><p>Simultaneously, Qin Sang rendered the Ebony Sword invisible. As he closed in on Xiang Yi, the sword erupted in a brilliant burst of sword light, resembling a blossoming lotus, its sharp edges glinting menacingly.</p><p>Xiang Yi realized his disguise had been seen through. He knew this tactic couldn't last forever, but he hadn't expected it to be exposed so quickly, rendering his efforts almost futile.  He still couldn't shake off his opponent.</p><p>He acted decisively, immediately abandoning the other phantoms and urgently summoning his natal magic treasure for defense.</p><p>‘Bang!’</p><p>The sword lotus collided with the small pagoda, scattering sparks of light. The chaotic True Yuan nearly shattered the illusion itself.</p><p>Despite his hasty defense, Xiang Yi managed to repel the Ebony Sword with his profound cultivation.</p><p>Before Xiang Yi could breathe a sigh of relief, a sense of impending danger washed over him.  He felt a chill down his spine, a warning sign in his heart.</p><p>Then, a dark shadow materialized behind him.</p><p>It was the Two-Headed Hound. It appeared largely unchanged, except for faint wisps of cyan energy swirling around its fur. It was this energy that sent shivers down Xiang Yi's spine.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The Two-Headed Hound lunged towards Xiang Yi, its speed even greater than before.</p><p>"No!"</p><p>Xiang Yi's expression shifted dramatically.  He desperately channeled True Yuan into his protective robe.</p><p>Radiant light flashed as an illusory image of the robe materialized around Xiang Yi's body.</p><p>Though the garment appeared incredibly thin, the fluctuations emanating from it were extraordinary.</p><p>"Roar!"</p><p>The Two-Headed Hound let out a painful roar.  Its bones cracked, and the cyan energy coalesced into a cyan shadow, which abruptly shot out, striking Xiang Yi with brutal force.</p><p>After the cyan shadow separated, the Two-Headed Hound panted heavily, seemingly exhausted.</p><p>The cyan shadow wasn't like the hound’s previous phantoms. It was a wind manipulation technique the hound had grasped during its cultivation, which involved channeling its bloodline power and focusing its entire being into the cyan shadow to tear apart its enemy.  It was a devastating attack.</p><p>However, the cost was substantial.  The hound's failed breakthrough made using this technique extremely strenuous, putting a heavy burden on its flesh and bones. Not only was it agonizing, but it also significantly weakened the hound's combat strength afterward.</p><p>This was why the Two-Headed Hound had been reluctant earlier.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The cyan shadow collided with Xiang Yi's protective robe, producing a deafening roar and a blinding flash of light.</p><p>A ripping sound followed, and both the cyan energy and the robe's radiance diminished, as if canceling each other out.</p><p>The cyan shadow revealed its form. Its claws and fangs had pierced the robe, tearing a gash in it.</p><p>Xiang Yi's quick reflexes and timely activation of the robe saved him. Though his True Yuan was greatly depleted, his hair disheveled, and blood trickling from his body, his injuries weren't severe.</p><p>He hastily used the small pagoda to shatter the cyan shadow and examined his robe.  The damaged treasure had dimmed, its power significantly reduced.</p><p>"This is what you were relying on for your ambush?"</p><p>Xiang Yi roared in fury.</p><p>Killing intent flared in his eyes. He wished he could tear Qin Sang to shreds.</p><p>This encounter had been far too dangerous.  He had been caught off guard by the Two-Headed Hound, and the chilling fear still lingered.</p><p>If he hadn't been prepared and his natal magic treasure intact, the claws might have pierced his flesh instead of just his robe.</p><p>Qin Sang remained silent.  He recalled the Two-Headed Hound, instructing it to recover, then continued his assault with his sword.</p><p>The Two-Headed Hound's attack had been taxing, but it had also significantly depleted Xiang Yi's True Yuan and destroyed his protective treasure.</p><p>Xiang Yi's gaze was cold. He judged that Qin Sang had exhausted his tricks.</p><p>They had been fighting for so long without any other reinforcements appearing, suggesting his earlier worries might have been unfounded.</p><p>Someone with such formidable strength wouldn't need assistance.</p><p>Anyone else facing such a terrifying ambush would likely be in grave danger.</p><p>But based on past experience, Xiang Yi knew he couldn't let his guard down. He decided to stick to his initial plan: escape first, and then plot his revenge later.</p><p>Just then, shimmering scales surfaced on the sea.</p><p>A white talismanic apparition shot out from the water without warning, heading straight for Xiang Yi.</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang finally breathed a sigh of relief. Lady Liu had finally prepared the Yuan-Restricting Talisman. Otherwise, he would have been forced to use the Star Conch.</p><p>While he was 80% confident the Star Conch would severely injure Xiang Yi, it would also expose his greatest trump card.</p><p>If any unforeseen circumstances arose, he would have no recourse.</p><p>In the perilous Demon Sea, he preferred to keep a trump card to deal with any potential crisis.</p><p>As the Yuan-Restricting Talisman shot out, Lady Liu's figure appeared on the sea surface. Her gaze, fixed on Xiang Yi, her husband's killer, burned with deep-seated hatred.</p><p>"It's you! You're not dead!"</p><p>Xiang Yi's face was filled with astonishment as he understood everything in an instant.</p><p>The Yuan-Restricting Talisman shattered with a 'crack'. A mass of interwoven golden patterns spread rapidly towards Xiang Yi, entangling him like tendrils.</p><p>Each thread clung to him like a leech. Xiang Yi frantically tried to sever them with his magic treasure, but to no avail.</p><p>The next moment, the golden threads seeped into his body.</p><p>To his horror, he found his True Yuan stagnating.</p>
