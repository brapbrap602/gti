<h1>Chapter 782: Pond Fish</h1><p>Suddenly, someone appeared in the teleportation circle, clearly descending from the level above.  Seeing the person's appearance, everyone was stunned, then their expressions changed dramatically.</p><p>The newcomer was a woman wearing a half-mask. She had a full head of white hair, like an old woman, and wore a brightly colored robe, incredibly dazzling, with strange patterns outlined in gold thread.</p><p>Gazing at the patterns on the robe, one felt a strange pull, as if it contained a scene of ultimate beauty.  It was very eerie.</p><p>Qin Sang had never seen this person before, but he had heard of the renowned Great Priestess.</p><p>Moreover, the terrifying pressure emanating from the old woman was enough to prove her identity!</p><p>The Witch Tribe's Great Priestess!</p><p>Nascent Soul late stage, one of the top experts in the Canglang Sea!</p><p>"Great Priestess!"</p><p>The Di Clan man exclaimed, his expression as if he were on a pilgrimage.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the Great Priestess didn't even glance at them.  With a gentle tap of her foot, she floated up effortlessly, her robe billowing. The golden threads on it seemed to come alive, weaving themselves into a pair of golden wings behind her.</p><p>At this moment, the Great Priestess's posture was like a butterfly, her figure breathtakingly beautiful.</p><p>Just then, the teleportation circle suddenly lit up again, and a square-faced middle-aged man walked out.</p><p>This man had a resolute face, his aura no weaker than the Great Priestess's. A strange light surrounded him. His tiger-like eyes swept over, fixing on the Great Priestess with her spread wings.</p><p>The moment Qin Sang saw the strange light, a familiar feeling surged in his heart.</p><p>Bloody hues churned within the strange light, as if imprisoning countless evil spirits, giggling and attempting to devour their minds.</p><p>"Taiyin Devilish Ghostly Light! He's the Demon Lord!"</p><p>Qin Sang was horrified. He never expected to encounter both the Demon Lord and the Great Priestess simultaneously, and just as they were about to step into the teleportation circle.</p><p>"Leave it!"</p><p>The Demon Lord's face was grim as he stared at the Great Priestess. Suddenly, he attacked.</p><p>The Taiyin Devilish Ghostly Light transformed into a beam of light and shot out with unparalleled power, like a vast ocean wave, surging forth.</p><p>Demonic energy erupted from the light, and the ghostly figures within bared their fangs, emitting soul-stirring cries.</p><p>For a moment, the void seemed filled with the wails of ten thousand ghosts, transforming into a hellish abyss, chilling to the bone.</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>The strange light descended from the sky, aimed directly at the Great Priestess.</p><p>"The treasures within the Seven Kills Hall are unclaimed. You live up to your name, Demon Lord, truly overbearing.  You don't even know what it is, yet you resort to plunder!"</p><p>A mocking smile appeared on the Great Priestess's lips. A silver bell-like laughter echoed in the void, and the wings behind her flapped violently, surrounding her with a brilliant golden light, transforming into a golden ocean.</p><p>As the strange light was about to collide with the Great Priestess,</p><p>Qin Sang's face showed a look of terror. He yelled, "Not good!"</p><p>Red and white escape lights suddenly lit up on his body. He had actually activated both the Nine Dragons Chariot Talisman and the Sword Qi Thunder Sound simultaneously.  His figure shot across several dozen meters in an instant, fleeing frantically without looking back.</p><p>Qin Sang had witnessed the terrifying power of Nascent Soul Patriarchs clashing in the Small Cold Realm.</p><p>Let alone these Nascent Soul late stage powerhouses, whose might was unseen in the Small Cold Realm.</p><p>Even if they were grazed by a ripple of the battle's aftershock, they had no chance of survival, no power to resist. Staying here would be a certain death.</p><p>When the Great Priestess and the Demon Lord fought, they wouldn't care about the lives of ants.</p><p>The others' reactions weren't much slower than Qin Sang's.</p><p>The Yin Clan woman summoned a flying shuttle, which transformed into a silver streak, only a step slower than Qin Sang, but its speed was far inferior.</p><p>The Di Clan man, who had been in a state of pilgrimage, as if he had encountered a deity, was instantly pulled back to reality by this scene, breaking out in a cold sweat.</p><p>He slapped his dantian forcefully, and an eight-winged insect shadow suddenly appeared on his body, carrying him away in another direction.</p><p>The old woman hurriedly took out a talisman, her eyes showing a pained expression. Gritting her teeth, she activated the talisman, but her speed was still slower than Qin Sang's.</p><p>As they fled frantically,</p><p>The Taiyin Devilish Ghostly Light plunged into the golden light, like a meteor falling into the ocean.</p><p>There were no waves, no loud noises, only silence in the void, as if time had frozen.</p><p>The next moment,</p><p>The golden ocean collapsed.</p><p>The Taiyin Devilish Ghostly Light shattered inch by inch, the demonic energy within dissipating, the evil spirits letting out silent screams as their bodies crumbled.</p><p>Immediately afterward, a terrifying wave suddenly erupted from the center of the collision, spreading outward at an alarming speed.</p><p>The golden light dispersed, and the Great Priestess's figure trembled slightly.  There were no wounds on her body, her colorful robe was intact, only the wings behind her were incredibly dim. True Essence surged within her, and the golden wings regained their brilliance, gently flapping, carrying the Great Priestess away at high speed.</p><p>The Demon Lord snorted coldly. Demonic energy surged in his palm, transforming into a black saber. He slashed out a blade of light, tearing open a passage. Then, his figure flashed, chasing after her.</p><p>The two disappeared one after another.</p><p>From beginning to end, they hadn't even glanced at the others.</p><p>Qin Sang and the others were wailing.</p><p>As expected, the aftershock of the battle erupted, fragments of golden light mixed with demonic energy袭来 at an alarming speed.</p><p>Of the five of them, the Wu Clan cultivator, who had been manipulating the small shield, was engulfed by the aftershock simply because he was a step slower at the critical moment. He didn't even have time to let out a scream before he was reduced to nothing.</p><p>Even his magic treasure, the small shield with decent defensive capabilities, vanished without a trace.</p><p>The person who had been talking to them moments ago was caught in the crossfire of two great powers and perished just like that.</p><p>Everyone was terrified.</p><p>Qin Sang flew a long distance in one breath, the chill on his back still lingering. He turned his head and saw that the aftershock was still spreading. Its power had weakened considerably compared to the initial burst, but its speed remained astonishing.</p><p>At this rate, he wouldn't be able to escape the aftershock's range.</p><p>At the same time, he saw the old woman behind him, who was about to be caught by the aftershock. She was looking at him with a terrified expression, her eyes seeming to plead for help.</p><p>The power of the talisman on her body had become very thin, clearly unable to last much longer.</p><p>Qin Sang's heart sank. Then, he actually stopped in place and turned back to face the old woman.  With a flash of shadow on his wrist, the Two-Headed Flood Dragon emerged.</p><p>The old woman's face was filled with surprise and gratitude.</p><p>"Join forces to resist the aftershock!"</p><p>Qin Sang said in a deep voice, summoning the Ten Yama Banners.</p><p>He had taken out the demonic banners the moment he sensed danger.</p><p>He was also doing it to save himself. The aftershock was too fast; he couldn't escape. It was better to calmly face it.  More people meant more power, and a greater chance of survival.</p><p>Moreover, the old woman's cultivation wasn't weak, and she had a magic treasure specializing in defense.</p><p>The Two-Headed Flood Dragon sensed the terrifying aura and instinctively felt threatened. All its fur stood on end. It glared at Qin Sang resentfully, lowered its head slightly, and shot out a green light from its vertical pupils, forming a storm.  Then, it rapidly compressed inward, transforming into a shield shape.</p><p>The old woman landed beside them, panting. She understood Qin Sang's intention and hurriedly urged her bronze mirror.  This wasn't the time to be stingy with magic treasures. She could only position the main body of the magic treasure in front of them.</p><p>In an instant, a triple barrier consisting of the bronze mirror, demonic fire, and wind shield was formed.</p><p>The aftershock arrived.</p><p>The figures of the two humans and one beast were engulfed.</p>
