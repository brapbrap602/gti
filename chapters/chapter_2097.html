<h1>Chapter 2088: Collusion in the Shadows</h1><p>“General, I wonder how the last battle went?”</p><p>The shadowy figure inquired with cupped hands.</p><p>Min Shan burst into laughter, his face beaming with pride. “The compensation you requested, my friend, has been fully prepared by the clan. We were just about to send it to your designated location. You can have someone retrieve it in ten days.”</p><p>The shadowy figure also smiled. “I naturally trust the General.”</p><p>Through several exchanges, both sides had kept their promises. Min Shan achieved victory, the shadowy figure reaped benefits. Both were satisfied, and their relationship grew closer.</p><p>“Your personal visit this time must mean you have important news?” Min Shan narrowed his eyes.</p><p>“Has the General prepared the Azure Spirit Essence?” the shadowy figure asked meaningfully.</p><p>Min Shan couldn't help but feel a surge of excitement.</p><p>The shadowy figure was undoubtedly greedy, otherwise he wouldn't have betrayed his side. But he also knew his limits. Every time he asked for compensation, it corresponded to the value of the intelligence, never exceeding the mark.</p><p>He dared to ask for Azure Spirit Essence, indicating he had sufficient confidence in this piece of intelligence.</p><p>“I have a wisp of Azure Spirit Essence in my tent right now!”</p><p>Min Shan's expression turned solemn. “As long as your intelligence proves true, the Azure Spirit Essence is yours. If we can conquer the Northern Sea, I can also offer you more!”</p><p>“The General is indeed straightforward!”</p><p>The shadowy figure laughed, a hint of urgency in his voice. “This news concerns the Green Ram Temple. As for its importance, I believe I don't need to elaborate…”</p><p>Min Shan remained unmoved. “I'd like to hear the details!”</p><p>“The Green Ram Temple intends to re-establish its mountain gate, which I believe the General should already know,” the shadowy figure said.</p><p>Min Shan nodded. They had other channels to obtain information from those foreign races. Shortly after the three races’ council, they had learned of this matter.</p><p>However, he didn't think there was any opportunity to exploit this.</p><p>The Green Ram Temple held a high reputation among those foreign races and was a top-tier Grand Sect. Their intention to establish a mountain gate to bolster their prestige was a common occurrence.  It was said that this move by the Green Ram Temple had shaken the hearts of those foreign races, but its impact wouldn't manifest immediately.</p><p>“The General only knows half the story. The Green Ram Temple's new mountain gate’s protective formation is extraordinary…”</p><p>The shadowy figure's tone became mysterious as he gradually revealed the secrets of the Green Ram Temple's protective formation.</p><p>After listening, Min Shan’s eyes flickered slightly. “Such a secret, outside the Green Ram Temple, I'm afraid not many people would know. How did you find out, and why are you so certain?”</p><p>The shadowy figure said indifferently, “The General doesn't need to ask about these matters. You can send people to investigate. However, this is a once-in-a-millennium opportunity. Once the timing is missed, the General will only be left with regret!”</p><p>“You say the Green Ram Temple has closed its mountain. How can we verify it?”</p><p>Min Shan frowned slightly, a contemplative look on his face.</p><p>This news did have some value, but it was a far cry from his expectations. The Green Ram Temple was only one of the top-tier Grand Sects. Even if the Green Ram Temple’s experts were all tied up, the strength of the other sects couldn't be underestimated and they could still defend the Northern Sea.</p><p>The shadowy figure shook his head. “It's not about having the General investigate the Green Ram Temple directly, as that would alert them. The General might as well keep an eye on some sects and cultivators who are on good terms with the Green Ram Temple. Such a complex protective formation cannot be completed by the Green Ram Temple alone. They will inevitably seek help.  The Green Ram Temple’s ancestral grounds are located in the North Star Realm of the Northern Sea, and most of their allied sects also originate from the Northern Sea. Their most important ally is the Profound Sky Palace. By then, the experts of the Profound Sky Palace, as well as Fairy Liu Li, are likely to be invited to the Middle Continent, along with other allies of the Green Ram Temple. With so many experts gone, the Northern Sea will be vulnerable. Isn't that precisely the General’s opportunity?”</p><p>Hearing this, Min Shan was truly tempted. If the situation developed as the shadowy figure said, it would indeed be a once-in-a-millennium opportunity.</p><p>Provided the shadowy figure's intelligence was accurate.</p><p>Thinking this inwardly, he feigned hesitation. “Even if this is true, with the Transportation Formation, they can quickly return. Our time is actually very limited, and it’s unlikely we can achieve significant results…”</p><p>The shadowy figure suddenly burst into laughter, his mockery of Min Shan unconcealed. “Does the General intend to conquer the Northern Sea in one fell swoop?  These are not the old days!”</p><p>He paused, then continued, “Once the Green Ram Temple begins activating the formation, it’s not something they can stop immediately. And the forces of the Middle Continent will certainly choose to wait and see at first. The time is actually more ample than you imagine. The General shouldn’t be impatient for success. It would be better to advance step by step, taking advantage of this opportunity to break through the Northern Sea's carefully laid defenses, perhaps even occupying a certain region, and then gradually conquer the Northern Sea. Of course, if the General can make a deep push, conquer the Crescent Moon Realm, destroy the Ancient Transportation Formation, and cut off the Northern Sea from the Middle Continent, turning the Northern Sea into an isolated island, there might not be no chance!”</p><p>These were two strategies, and both sounded somewhat feasible.</p><p>Min Shan remained hesitant.</p><p>The shadowy figure said, “There is still plenty of time. The General should go back and carefully weigh your options before making a decision. I will closely monitor the movements of the Green Ram Temple and its allies. After the matter is accomplished, I hope the General will not go back on your word! However, once the General makes a decision, remember to make adequate preparations.”</p><p>Regarding the Azure Spirit Essence, it was natural for him to appear a bit eager.</p><p>Having said that, the shadowy figure didn't wait for Min Shan's response, his figure gradually fading.</p><p>Min Shan came back to his senses, cupping his hands in farewell. “Farewell, my friend.”</p><p>Inside the command tent.</p><p>Min Shan’s true body sat at his desk, lost in thought.</p><p>What the avatar saw and heard was as if experienced by the true body. He had too much to consider about this matter.</p><p>They couldn't place all their bets on a single piece of intelligence.</p><p>Was the shadowy figure trustworthy?  Were those foreign races playing a long game, luring them into a trap?</p><p>However, they weren't without means of verification.</p><p>Min Shan pondered silently, considering how to approach the Green Ram Temple or obtain corroborating evidence from elsewhere.</p><p>If they were to attack the Northern Sea, there were even more things to consider. The Northern Sea’s military strength wasn't abundant. If they dispatched a large army from the Middle Continent, losing their deterrent force, the Middle Continent might seize the opportunity to cause trouble. Trying to attend to both fronts would be detrimental.</p><p>The Demon Sea and the Boundless Sea mentioned by those foreign races had now become the garrison locations for the Chang You Clan army. Firstly, to guard against any designs those foreign races might have on the Tainted Lands, and secondly, to allow several armies to rotate and rest.</p><p>Once they decided to act, they would definitely dispatch troops from there, but they would have to take a detour to avoid detection by those foreign races’ spies. The shadowy figure was right; they had to prepare in advance.</p><p>In the quiet hall, Min Shan sat alone, motionless for a long time.</p><p>…</p><p>Green Ram Temple.</p><p>Forbidden Grounds.</p><p>Two figures sat cross-legged in the valley: Qin Sang and Shen Chen.</p><p>Shen Chen couldn't help with the construction of the Thunder Altar, only watching, but he looked even more exhausted than Qin Sang.</p><p>At this moment, a majestic altar appeared before Qin Sang out of thin air.</p><p>Daoist altars were often divided into three levels: a circular upper altar, an octagonal middle altar, and a square lower altar.  Qin Sang was about to complete the lower two levels.</p><p>Nearly half of the floating spiritual objects in the air had vanished. Suddenly, a cluster of spiritual light was drawn into Qin Sang’s palm. Fire ignited in his palm, enveloping the treasure within the spiritual light and beginning to refine it. The refining process was extremely fast. In just the time it took to brew tea, a golden brilliance emerged from the flames, and a stream of molten gold-like liquid slowly flowed out.</p><p>Shen Chen watched Qin Sang’s palm intently, afraid to miss any detail.</p><p>Most of his master's actions were beyond his comprehension, but he had to force himself to memorize them, as they would be invaluable treasures in the future.</p><p>The mental strain of this was immense. His master couldn't wait for him to digest it slowly, and Shen Chen was desperately trying to keep up. Such an opportunity, once missed, would be difficult to come by again.</p><p>The molten gold flowed into the altar, as if plating its surface with gold foil. Spiritual light flickered within the molten gold, and one after another, runes that Shen Chen had never seen before flashed, making his head spin.</p><p>Gradually, the molten gold seeped into the altar's interior. Finally, the altar suddenly trembled, and the earth rumbled.</p><p>The tremors could be felt both inside and outside the Green Ram Temple.</p><p>Over the years, such tremors had occurred more than once. The Green Ram Temple disciples had become accustomed to them, assuming they were caused by the construction of the protective formation.</p><p>As the tremors occurred, the altar erupted in a dazzling golden light that shot straight into the sky. Qin Sang pressed down with his palm, suppressing the golden light. As the golden light gradually dispersed, the complete double-layered altar appeared before them.</p><p>Looking at the altar, Qin Sang nodded in satisfaction. This Thunder Altar was similar to the one in Mooncry Bay, but not entirely the same.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't fully decipher the spiritual materials used by the previous owner of that Thunder Altar, and some of them were beyond his reach. But he held the Five Thunders Seal, which contained much of the Daoist Thunder Lineage's inheritance, including the construction methods for various altars, as well as the properties of various spiritual objects and their compatibility.</p><p>Qin Sang modified the design based on his own understanding, and its power was no less impressive. The foundation had been laid, and the next step would be the most crucial.</p><p>“Shen Chen.”</p><p>Qin Sang called out.</p><p>“Disciple is here!” Shen Chen quickly rose, pulling himself together to respond.</p><p>“Go out first,” Qin Sang said.</p><p>Shen Chen wouldn't benefit from observing the next part, and he had reached his limit. It would be better for him to go out and help Li Yufu; they were short-handed outside.</p><p>“Disciple obeys!”</p><p>Shen Chen bowed and withdrew from the valley.</p><p>Qin Sang waved his sleeve, sealing the Forbidden Grounds, and slowly floated up, landing on top of the altar, sitting motionless.</p><p>His mind sank into the altar, and a thunder rune appeared in his mind.</p><p>The type of thunder rune inscribed within the Thunder Altar determined its power.</p><p>The fourth-rank Daoist thunder runes corresponded to the Body Integration stage, but the Five Thunders Seal only recorded up to third-rank thunder runes. The only fourth-rank thunder rune Qin Sang knew was the Thunder Sacrifice Oath he obtained from the Thunder Altar.</p><p>It wasn't necessarily the case that the higher the rank of the rune, the better. It couldn't exceed one's own capabilities.  But Qin Sang had invested so much effort, he naturally didn't want to simply inscribe a third-rank thunder rune and be done with it.</p><p>A third-rank thunder rune, empowered by the altar, would undoubtedly be greatly enhanced, but it was still insufficient to deter a powerful race like the Zhu Yan Clan.</p><p>Qin Sang's attempt to personally inscribe a fourth-rank thunder rune was undoubtedly extremely difficult.</p><p>At Mooncry Bay, with the help of the Thunder Altar, Qin Sang had thoroughly comprehended the Thunder Sacrifice Oath. Even so, if he were to create the rune on his own, even at his current late Soul Formation stage, the chances of success were very low.</p><p>However, if he completed all the subsidiary altars before inscribing the thunder rune, he could have people preside over the subsidiary altars and borrow some of their power to aid him in forming the rune. Then, the main altar and the thunder rune would be completed simultaneously.</p><p>In addition, the success of rune creation also depended on the spiritual materials used, the rune brush, rune paper, ink, and so on.</p><p>This was Qin Sang’s greatest confidence, because he possessed the Azure Phoenix True Thunder!</p><p>Qin Sang still couldn't control the Azure Phoenix True Thunder.  It was at least at the Body Integration stage level of power, perhaps even higher. Using the Azure Phoenix True Thunder as 'ink', with its rank, it was more than enough to carry the might of the Thunder Sacrifice Oath.</p><p>The previous owner of that Thunder Altar might not have had such favorable conditions.</p><p>At the same time, this was also the biggest hurdle. Both the fourth-rank thunder rune and the Azure Phoenix True Thunder were beyond his current realm, requiring the most precise control, with no room for error. Otherwise, Qin Sang could only settle for a third-rank thunder rune.</p><p>Before that, Qin Sang still needed to activate the altar's foundation, combine it with the Azure Phoenix True Thunder, and further contemplate his chances of success.</p><p>He sat cross-legged on the altar. Azure light flashed behind him, phoenix wings unfurled, and a thread-thin bolt of lightning drifted towards his palm.</p><p>His mind connected with the altar. Qin Sang activated the Thunder Observation Technique in his palm. The lightning twisted and turned, creating waves, all blocked by the formations here.</p><p>…</p><p>Above the Green Ram Temple, Lu Ye had been hovering here ever since the new mountain gate was opened.</p><p>Si Lu pushed open the door of his cave dwelling and slowly walked out, now radiant and fully recovered from his injuries.</p><p>He flashed to the edge of Lu Ye, overlooking the land, his divine sense sweeping across the Green Ram Temple unnoticed, pausing briefly at the Forbidden Grounds.</p><p>Seeing the dramatically changed Green Ram Temple, Si Lu murmured, “It seems I’ve been in seclusion for at least several decades…”</p><p>He had been focused on stabilizing his cultivation, losing track of time.</p><p>The rapid changes in the Green Ram Temple couldn't surprise Si Lu. His focus was on the entire Storm Realm, and of course, most importantly, on Qin Sang.</p><p>Noticing the sealed Forbidden Grounds, Si Lu was considering whether or not to disturb Qin Sang when he suddenly heard Qin Sang's voice transmission.</p><p>“Fellow Daoist has emerged from seclusion.”</p><p>Si Lu's expression shifted slightly, and he appeared outside the Forbidden Grounds.</p><p>A passage opened in the Forbidden Grounds, and Si Lu stepped inside. Seeing Qin Sang, he bowed deeply.  “Thanks to Fellow Daoist Qin’s protection, I was able to recover in peace.”</p><p>He couldn't help but look at the altar beneath Qin Sang, surprise flashing in his eyes.</p><p>From Qin Sang and Su Nu's previous conversation, he knew that Qin Sang was constructing some kind of altar, but he didn't know the full picture.</p><p>Seeing it now with his own eyes, Si Lu realized the altar was still incomplete, yet it seemed to contain endless profound mysteries that he couldn't fathom.</p><p>“Fellow Daoist’s foundation has also stabilized. Congratulations,” Qin Sang nodded with a smile.</p><p>Si Lu wasn't complacent. “I've wasted too much time after my breakthrough. Compared to other fellow Daoists of the same realm, especially in terms of divine abilities, spells, and combat techniques, I am still lacking.”</p><p>“These things must be cultivated gradually; there's no need to rush. I have a matter I'd like to ask for your assistance, Fellow Daoist. I wonder if you have the time?” Qin Sang asked.</p><p>Si Lu didn’t hesitate.  “Please, Fellow Daoist, instruct me!”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded. “This main altar beneath me is one step away from completion.  I need to establish subsidiary altars first. The three most crucial subsidiary altars are already under construction, but I have some new ideas, and those juniors are likely not up to the task. You may need to make a personal trip, Fellow Daoist.  In the future, when activating the altar, you will also need to personally preside over one of the subsidiary altars!”</p><p>Si Lu readily agreed. He was curious about this altar, so he immediately accepted.</p><p>“The details regarding the altar are all recorded in this jade slip. Please take a look, Fellow Daoist.”</p><p>Qin Sang produced a jade slip. Si Lu reached out and took it, spoke with Qin Sang for a while longer, and then took his leave.</p><p>Several days later, Si Lu quietly departed from the Green Ram Temple, first visiting the Four Saints Palace to inspect the first core subsidiary altar.</p>
