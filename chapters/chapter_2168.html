<h1>Chapter 2158:  First to Arrive</h1><p>Streams of Changming Fire transformed into fiery dragons, relentlessly pursuing Qin Sang and Shaoshi. By the time Qin Sang and Shaoshi retreated to the vicinity of the Wu Ding Ba Ji Tu, the area was already enveloped in a sea of azure flames.</p><p>The Jiao Nu pressed on, her figure flickering in and out of sight, constantly shifting her position using mirror magic, making her unpredictable and preventing a sudden counterattack from Qin Sang and Shaoshi.</p><p>The Wu Ding Ba Ji Tu was close at hand, but Shaoshi hadn't fully unleashed its power. The two seemed to have forgotten about the treasure map, focusing solely on their escape.</p><p>This was, of course, a deliberate tactic. They didn't want to engage in a prolonged fight with the Jiao Nu, but if she became overconfident, failing to notice the danger and stumbling into their trap, they wouldn't mind teaching her a lesson.</p><p>As they retreated into the area of the Wu Ding Ba Ji Tu, Qin Sang prepared to unleash the Kun Tian Jin Suo. Both kept a close watch on the Jiao Nu's movements.</p><p>Unfortunately, the Jiao Nu was extremely cautious. As she neared the Wu Ding Ba Ji Tu, she sensed danger, her gaze sweeping across the peaks, her expression shifting slightly before she suddenly dispersed into water droplets.</p><p>The next moment, she reappeared on a mountain thousands of meters behind them, while the Changming Fire retreated, the fire dragons circling back to the Jiao Nu, watching Qin Sang and Shaoshi warily.</p><p>Seeing the lost opportunity, Shaoshi gestured, and a yellowish-brown light flowed across the earth, transforming into a scroll that appeared in his hand.</p><p>Qin Sang looked towards the Jiao Nu's rear. A long, expansive fungal mat stretched to the horizon.</p><p>In a short time, the elite fighters of the Junren tribe had arrived at their previous battleground.  A giant red mushroom, taller than the surrounding peaks, had sprung from the earth.</p><p>Its cap spread wide like a strange building.</p><p>A fissure opened on the mushroom, revealing a gigantic eye. The pupil shifted, fixing its gaze on them.</p><p>Qin Sang's pupils constricted. Without hesitation, he and Shaoshi used their escape techniques, fleeing without looking back.</p><p>The Jiao Nu, eager to pursue, seemed to be dissuaded.  She complained, "Sister, why didn't you intervene? They've likely plundered all the treasures from the Great Calamity Nest!"</p><p>Moments later, a faint voice echoed from the sky, "There's no chance! Shaoshi is the right-hand man of the Si Huang. That human cultivator, having gained the recognition of the Siyou tribe, may not be showing his true strength. We should focus on completing our mission within the initial timeframe. Any gains we made are a bonus; their absence isn't a loss. It's just that we arrived too late."</p><p>The Jiao Nu violently shook her long tail, letting out a snort, extinguished the Changming Fire, and flew towards the giant mushroom.</p><p>…</p><p>Qin Sang and Shaoshi flew for a while, confirming that they weren't being pursued, before descending.</p><p>Their journey to the Sacred Land had been eventful from the start. Fortunately, their efforts weren't fruitless; they now had a better understanding of the terrain, confirming that they weren't on Wu Gen Island.</p><p>After a brief discussion, they decided to investigate separately, agreeing to meet at a designated spot in two hours.</p><p>"Qin Zhenren, what have you found?" Shaoshi asked.</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head. "I haven't found the special markers on the topographic map, but there are a few locations that might help Daoist Si..."</p><p>He explained his findings. Shaoshi nodded. "Qin Zhenren's findings largely support my assessment. We should be near Mount Bai Zhu!"</p><p>"Mount Bai Zhu…"</p><p>Qin Sang recalled information about Mount Bai Zhu. It was a massive mountain range consisting of a main ridge and countless branching ridges, located in the western part of the Sacred Land. The main ridge ran north-south with a slight incline, while the branches ran east-west, resembling legs extending from the main mountain – hence its name.</p><p>"Are we on the eastern or western slope?" Qin Sang immediately asked.</p><p>The eastern and western slopes were vastly different. Their rendezvous point with the Si Huang was east of Mount Bai Zhu. If they were on the western slope, they'd have to cross the main ridge.</p><p>"Judging by the terrain, I initially thought we were on the western slope, but I've noticed some details that suggest we're on the eastern slope!" Shaoshi said calmly.</p><p>Qin Sang relaxed slightly. Mount Bai Zhu wasn't easy to cross. While they weren't afraid of danger, less trouble was always preferable.</p><p>"Qin Zhenren, unless you have other matters to attend to, let's set off," Shaoshi suggested.</p><p>Qin Sang agreed. They determined their direction and flew east.</p><p>As they continued their journey, the terrain gradually flattened, the peaks becoming lower, while the waterways became more abundant.</p><p>They followed a large river for several days, which eventually flowed into a vast, boundless body of water marked as Zhui Kong Lake on the topographic map.</p><p>Reaching Zhui Kong Lake confirmed Shaoshi's judgment. They only needed to cross the lake to be near their meeting point.</p><p>They flew without pause into the lake, taking turns keeping watch.  Their journey was largely uneventful, only sensing the presence of other cultivators twice, but they didn't investigate.</p><p>In truth, while many powerful outsiders entered the Sacred Land, they were spread across a vast area.  Initially, most had specific goals and avoided conflict.  With a little effort at concealment, encounters were rare.</p><p>Had it not been for the great beast's furious rampage, creating such a disturbance, they wouldn't have encountered three groups of opponents.  Qin Sang wasn't worried about Liuli's safety; Master Ning would certainly have given her protective artifacts.</p><p>On the eighteenth day, they finally crossed Falling Sky Lake and reached the eastern shore.</p><p>The eastern shore's landscape was drastically different from the west.  The ground was crisscrossed with cracks, like parched earth after a long drought.  The bottom of the ravines, however, teemed with life. But the plants, like the soil, were mostly inky black, creating a somber atmosphere.</p><p>Flying above the ravines, the Master used his spiritual senses to pinpoint their destination.</p><p>Three days later.</p><p>They arrived above a ravine, looking down into its depths.</p><p>The view was similar to other places, perhaps with denser vegetation, but they sensed nothing unusual.</p><p>The Master crushed a jade token.  A moment later, a calm voice echoed from the ravine depths, "Is it Master Shao who has arrived?"</p><p>"It's the Crown Prince!"</p><p>The Master informed Qin Sang via telepathy, bowing from the air, "It is I, Your Highness."</p><p>As the voice spoke, ripples appeared on the ravine's surface, forming a gateway.</p><p>Qin Sang followed the Master through the gateway to the valley floor, where they met the Crown Prince. He possessed an imposing presence and regal bearing, but certain aspects suggested a deliberate imitation of the Emperor.</p><p>The Crown Prince was said to be the Emperor's only son born through the harmonization of Yin and Yang, the one most resembling him, and therefore, the most favored. He had not disappointed, already surpassing the mid-stage of the Sky Realm , poised to inherit the throne.</p><p>Standing beside him was a person veiled in light gauze, appearing more feminine.  This individual also possessed mid-stage Sky Realm  cultivation, yet the Master treated them with respect, addressing them as "Guest Minister Chao."</p><p>This person, known only as Chao, was shrouded in mystery; their family background was unknown.  Serving as a guest minister in the Crown Prince's palace without any official post, yet treated with the utmost respect.</p><p>The Master, the Emperor's right hand, was not the Crown Prince's teacher.</p><p>The Crown Prince turned to Qin Sang, "Si Ge greets Master Qin! I've long admired Master Qin's accomplishments.  We only arrived hastily before the Sacred Land event to improve our strength, sadly missing the opportunity to meet you."</p><p>"I'm unworthy of such high regard, Your Highness."</p><p>Qin Sang bowed in return, noticing the absence of the Emperor's aura, furrowing his brow.</p><p>"Has the Emperor not yet arrived?" the Master asked.</p><p>"We happened to be nearby and have been waiting for several days without news from Father…"</p><p>A flicker of worry crossed the Crown Prince's eyes, not concerning the Emperor's safety, but the potential consequences of delay.</p><p>With the Emperor absent, they lacked knowledge of their precise target, patiently awaiting his arrival.  Their wait was not long; the Emperor's voice reached the valley on the third morning.</p><p>The three parties united.  The Emperor appeared weary, suggesting a difficult journey.</p><p>His gaze swept over them, "Only four of you?"</p><p>The Crown Prince replied respectfully, "We've yet to find others. Should we wait longer?"</p><p>"No!" The Emperor said sternly, "Time is of the essence. Leave a mark; let's go immediately!"</p><p>He had certainly invited more help, but the Master and Qin Sang were clearly his most valued assets; the others were secondary.  Bringing them together ensured their timely arrival.</p><p>The six left a trail marker and, using their abilities, vanished instantly.</p><p>Traveling with the Emperor was his consort, Empress Anling, whose cultivation was on par with the Crown Prince, a formidable warrior.</p><p>Their combined strength was among the most elite in the entire Sacred Land.  Few could stand against them, barring a Saint-level beast.</p><p>The Emperor led the way, followed closely by the others, flying northward along the eastern shore of Falling Sky Lake.</p><p>Hours passed, and as dusk settled, they sped through the night, finally reaching their destination.</p><p>Above a ravine, the Emperor halted, gazing down into the valley.</p><p>The eastern shore of Falling Sky Lake at night differed greatly from its daytime appearance.  The ravines were cloaked in darkness, trees like clawing demons, even more eerie and terrifying.</p><p>Qin Sang awakened his Sky Eye Butterfly, secretly using the Sky Eye technique, but detected nothing unusual below.</p><p>The Emperor then sat cross-legged in the air, raising his right hand, gently pinching his fingers.  A fine dust sprinkled down, scattering on the wind.</p><p>Immediately, Si Huang made a series of hand seals, striking the void and causing mystical changes.  He seemed to be searching for something, but after a full quarter of an hour, there was still no reaction.</p><p>Those in the know, such as the Shaoshi and others, were not surprised.  The place they sought wasn't fixed, constantly shifting. Ever since the Imperial family discovered it, each search had been arduous.</p><p>An hour later, Si Huang suddenly stood and sped off in one direction; everyone quickly followed.</p><p>There were no other cultivators nearby, yet they remained cautious, silently following Si Huang to a large, circular valley.</p><p>It was the largest and deepest valley in the vicinity, bottomless, emanating an aura that surprised everyone.</p><p>"There are so many ferocious beasts living here!"</p><p>the Crown Prince exclaimed in astonishment.</p><p>The valley contained beast nests, more than one species.  Two distinct groups occupied the east and west sides, each with powerful beasts comparable to the Transcendence Void stage.</p><p>It was unimaginable how they coexisted peacefully. Perhaps the valley was simply vast enough, or perhaps they had recently migrated and hadn't yet clashed.</p><p>Everyone looked to Si Huang for a decision.</p><p>"Eliminate them.  Otherwise, any unforeseen incident, any beast riot, will only worsen the situation," Si Huang declared firmly. "Clean up all traces thoroughly!"</p><p>"Yes!"</p><p>Shaoshi and Qin Sang flew toward the eastern beast nests, Anling, the Crown Prince, and the Imperial Attendant went west, while Si Huang vanished into the center of the valley.</p><p>…</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>Qin Sang and Shaoshi silently arrived before the beast nests.</p><p>"Master Qin, please use the Heavenly Binding Golden Lock to subdue the beasts," Shaoshi said.</p><p>It was an open secret that the Heavenly Binding Golden Lock, belonging to the Grand Attendant, was now in Qin Sang's possession; there was no reason not to refine such a treasure.</p><p>They needed to eliminate these beasts, while avoiding creating too much disturbance to attract attention. The Unstable Eight Poles Diagram's drawback was that it required advance preparation time.  The Heavenly Binding Golden Lock wasn't overkill; there was a beast below comparable to the mid-Transcendence Void stage, its abilities unpredictable, so caution was warranted.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, swept his sleeve, and golden light burst forth, transforming into the golden lock.</p><p>This immediately alerted the beasts below, and a powerful aura erupted.</p><p>"Grrr!"</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>A grey vapor shot from the forest, incredibly fast.</p><p>Within the vapor was a strange beast, toad-like but with eight legs, a single vertical eye on its face, glaring at Qin Sang as if flames were about to erupt.</p><p>"Grrr!"</p><p>Its throat pulsed, its mouth slightly open, as if about to spew something forth.</p><p>Just then, golden light descended from the sky, washing over the beast.  The light appeared gentle and harmless, yet it rendered the beast rigid, its eyes vacant, its throat unable to release whatever it held.</p><p>A being comparable to the mid-Transcendence Void stage was ultimately unable to resist the power of the Void Realm. Shaoshi, waiting nearby, wasted no time, decisively acting; a huge, furry hand materialized in the void, smashing down on the beast.</p><p>The beast offered no resistance.  With a *pop*, its head exploded, brains splattering.</p><p>*Pop! Pop! Pop!*</p><p>Shaoshi delivered several more blows, ending the beast's life, then struck the forest, utterly annihilating the entire beast clan.</p><p>Qin Sang stayed to finish the cleanup while Shaoshi went to assist on the other side.</p><p>Soon, the beasts were eliminated, and Si Huang found the entrance.</p><p>They arrived before a dark forest.  Si Huang used some technique, revealing a small path winding into the depths.</p><p>At the path's end, a mountain appeared before them – a rounded peak resembling a grave mound. A cave lay at its foot, built of blue bricks, like a tomb entrance.</p><p>A flash of joy crossed Si Huang's eyes. As he was about to enter the blue-brick tomb passage, his expression suddenly changed, his gaze fixed on the side of the passage.</p><p>The others noticed his change, following his gaze, but saw nothing.</p><p>Si Huang's face grew darker, coldly saying, "Someone beat us to it!"</p>
