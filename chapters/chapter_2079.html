<h1>Chapter 2070: Azure Spirit Qi</h1><p>Several cultivators were still worshipping before the sacred statue, but none noticed the presence of someone standing beside it, identical in appearance to the statue itself.</p><p>At this moment, two streaks of light flew out from the depths of Deer Wilderness. Li Yufu, having learned from Shen Chen about his grand-uncle's return, hurried out to greet him.</p><p>Seeing his grand-uncle, Li Yufu's expression brightened, his heart stirred with excitement. He hastily took two steps forward, about to bow in obeisance, but sensed something unusual in his grand-uncle's aura. He saw Si Lu shake her head at them from the side.</p><p>Suppressing his excitement, he glanced at the surrounding cultivators and revealed his presence.</p><p>“Eh? This person's appearance… seems to be Sect Master Li?”</p><p>“That one is Alliance Leader Shen of the Heavenly Crafts Alliance!”</p><p>“Greetings, Sect Master and Alliance Leader!”</p><p>…</p><p>Seeing the two of them, the cultivators gathered around.</p><p>In the eyes of the world, they were legendary figures. The cultivators were extremely excited, feeling their pilgrimage had been worthwhile.</p><p>“Greetings, fellow Daoists!”</p><p>Li Yufu bowed deeply and said in a clear voice, “Our sect has a pressing matter and must temporarily close its gates. We are unable to entertain guests at this time. We apologize for any inconvenience and hope you will not take offense.”</p><p>“No worries, no worries…”</p><p>“What are you saying, Sect Master? You honor us.”</p><p>The cultivators returned the courtesy, all saying it was no problem. For such a matter, sending a deacon from the Green Ram Sect would have sufficed. For the Sect Master of the Green Ram Sect to personally explain, it was a great honor. What was there to be upset about?</p><p>Some even asked with concern, “Is your esteemed sect facing any trouble? Though our cultivation is meager, we are willing to offer our assistance!”</p><p>Others also showed concern. The Green Ram Sect had long been a sacred place in the hearts of cultivators. If the Green Ram Sect encountered problems, it could very well affect the entire Storm Realm.</p><p>Li Yufu cupped his hands and said, “Thank you for your concern, fellow Daoists. There is no real difficulty. We will reopen our gates soon. You are all welcome to visit again.”</p><p>Hearing this, the cultivators were relieved. They bid farewell one after another, and in a blink of an eye, only a few of them remained before the sacred statue.</p><p>Li Yufu then brought out the Sect Master's command talisman, activating a layer of the protective formation and concealing Deer Wilderness. Immediately afterward, the Green Ram Sect disciples within Deer Wilderness heard the Sect Master's voice transmission, ordering them not to leave.</p><p>After seeing off the cultivators, Li Yufu and Shen Chen stood respectfully to the side. But soon, they sensed something amiss from Qin Sang's Qi.</p><p>So profound and ethereal…</p><p>Li Yufu and Shen Chen exchanged glances, thinking of a possibility. Their hearts were filled with shock and reverence.</p><p>Qin Sang was still immersed in a peculiar state.</p><p>The fragmented divine will fragments melted within his consciousness. Qin Sang instinctively refined them, transforming them into a pure stream of divine will that melted the membrane.</p><p>Qin Sang felt his comprehension of the *Purple Star Sword Canon* and the Great Ascension Path deepen, more than enough to help him break through his bottleneck.</p><p>At the same time, Qin Sang truly confirmed one thing. Though both belonged to the Great Ascension Path, the path of the *Purple Star Sword Canon* and the Divine Path prevalent in the Great Thousand World were vastly different. Unlike Divine Path cultivators who fed on the worship of incense and faith, his power was not derived from such means.</p><p>In Moonpool Bay, he annihilated the Fallen Soul Abyss and banished the Cloud Metropolis Heaven, earning the reverence of the world.</p><p>In the Storm Realm, people erected sacred statues and worshipped him.</p><p>Though he benefited from both of these sacred grounds, he did not directly draw power from them. What was elevated were his own realm, his comprehension of the *Purple Star Sword Canon*, and his understanding of the Dao. Previous doubts found their answers. Thus, the bottleneck ahead was invisibly dissolved for the most part, making his cultivation twice as effective and breaking through the bottleneck much easier.</p><p>However, to increase his cultivation level, he still needed to cultivate diligently.</p><p>Divine Path cultivators, while receiving the worship of their followers, were also bound by them. Once they lost all their followers, their Dao foundation could collapse. If the *Purple Star Sword Canon* were the same, it would not be what Qin Sang desired. He always believed that only oneself was the true foundation.</p><p>Because of this difference between the two, Qin Sang couldn't make a definitive judgment. But he couldn't just sit back and watch the Storm Realm be destroyed for the sake of verification.</p><p>Qin Sang guessed that during the Void Refinement stage, the Purple Star Sword Sovereign was likely still on his path of seeking the Dao, and hadn't truly chosen the Great Ascension Slaughter Path.</p><p>If the Dao was compared to a perilous peak, a cultivator's journey was like grabbing a ladder leading to the summit and climbing upwards. Perhaps the Purple Star Sword Sovereign discovered midway that the ladder of the Great Ascension Slaughter Path was quite suitable for him and tried walking a section of it, but hadn't yet decided to fully cross over.</p><p>If this were the truth, whether the Purple Star Sword Sovereign would choose the Great Ascension Slaughter Path in the future was uncertain.</p><p>Qin Sang looked inward, ‘seeing’ the sword intent he had obtained in the Taiyin Divine Hall. Since that was the case, he didn't need to rush to change his path. He could wait until the peak of Void Refinement or even the Body Integration stage, comprehend the Dao within the sword intent, and then make a decision.</p><p>With this, his path of Void Refinement was truly established!</p><p>Next, he would follow his plan, establish a sacred ground here, protect the beings of the Storm Realm, and expel foreign enemies. The more prosperous the sacred ground, the more beneficial it would be for him to comprehend the *Purple Star Sword Canon*.</p><p>Qin Sang awoke from his contemplation and slowly opened his eyes, seeing Li Yufu. He nodded slightly.</p><p>“Unworthy disciple, pays respects to Grand-Uncle!”</p><p>Li Yufu prostrated himself.</p><p>Qin Sang lifted Li Yufu with spiritual power, looked him over, and said, “Senior would be very pleased to know your current achievements.”</p><p>He had initially thought that if Li Yufu could break through to the Nascent Soul stage, it would be a great fortune for master and disciple to meet again in this lifetime. Unexpectedly, this disciple was quite ambitious and had already stepped into the mid-Nascent Soul stage. It was not in vain that Yun Youzi and he had nurtured him!</p><p>Li Yufu's lips moved, and excitement flashed in his eyes. As the Sect Master, he had to maintain his dignified demeanor at all times, and it had been a long time since he had lost his composure like this.</p><p>“Let’s go inside and talk.”</p><p>Qin Sang stepped inside.</p><p>Li Yufu acknowledged with a "Yes," quickly followed, and asked, “Grand-Uncle, should I have the sect disciples come out to pay their respects?”</p><p>“Not yet,” Qin Sang shook his head. “Don't reveal my return for the time being. You are the Sect Master. From now on, the internal and external affairs of the Green Ram Sect are still up to you.”</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>Li Yufu knew his grand-uncle must have his considerations, so he didn't ask further and bowed, leading Qin Sang and the others into the main hall.</p><p>The Green Ram Sect's main hall was built next to Qin Sang's former cave dwelling.</p><p>“You two, please rest in the main hall for a while. I have some matters to attend to,” Qin Sang said to Si Lu, with whom he was very familiar, and there was no need for formalities. He left Shen Chen to entertain them and, calling Li Yufu, went to his cave dwelling.</p><p>His cave dwelling was now a forbidden area. Except for the absence of the Taiji Celestial Platform and the Ice and Fire Tokens that formed the tribulation-crossing formation, it basically maintained the same furnishings as when he left.</p><p>The objects of the past appeared before him vividly. Qin Sang looked at them one by one and sighed, “I hastily broke through the realm back then, thinking I would never return in this lifetime. I only learned about the Storm Realm's ascension from Gu Ya…”</p><p>As for the twists and turns of his ascension experience and the matters of the Talisman Symbol Realm, there was no need to inform Li Yufu for now.</p><p>“Gu Ya?”</p><p>Li Yufu recalled her identity and understood the reason. He said joyfully, “Unexpectedly, the Mist Waterfall is not a dead end. It seems that other fellow Daoists swept away by the Mist Waterfall, like Fellow Daoist Gu Ya, might still be alive. It must be fate that Fellow Daoist Gu Ya could encounter Grand-Uncle in the vast Great Thousand World!”</p><p>He hadn't expected to see his grand-uncle again in this lifetime. After the storm dissipated, they had all gone to the Witch God Mountain in the Canglang Sea.</p><p>This sacred mountain of the Witch Clan, serving as their spiritual totem, had even been moved here by the Witch Clan and was now located in the Central Continent.</p><p>On Witch God Mountain, traces left by Qin Sang during his ascension still remained.</p><p>Though the strange power had dissipated, anyone with a discerning eye could see how powerful it had been, not to mention it had pierced through the realm barrier and been eroded by the power of the barrier.</p><p>It was hard to imagine how terrifying the master of this strange power was. It was almost impossible for Qin Sang, who had just stepped into the Nascent Soul stage at that time, to survive.</p><p>Combining the Heavenly Dao Demonic Sound and the scene described by the Witch Clan, everyone made a reasonable deduction. Behind the Heavenly Dao Demonic Sound was a monstrous beast attempting to devour an entire realm. The barriers between the various regions could not only block the storm but also isolate the beast’s gaze, but the power of the barriers was constantly fading.</p><p>Those who had ascended before had long since perished at the beast’s maw. Qin Sang left the Central Continent and crossed the storm to the Canglang Sea, so he was targeted.</p><p>All signs indicated that the lower realm's integration into the Great Thousand World was likely because Qin Sang had led the monstrous beast away, at the cost of his own life. Because of this, the various races and sects willingly revered him as a saint.</p><p>Qin Sang looked around and said, “We were very worried about your current situation. Now it seems that both the Storm Realm and the Green Ram Sect are much better than we anticipated.”</p><p>“It's also by the grace of fate. If the lower realm had directly merged into the Great Thousand World and encountered the Changyou Clan at its peak, we might have already been annihilated.”</p><p>Li Yufu revealed a hint of lingering fear and recounted his past experiences.</p><p>“Later, we learned that our integration into the Great Thousand World was a long process, and it also affected the Great Thousand World, causing the turbid Qi here to surge and rise.</p><p>“During this period, many powerful monstrous beasts escaped from within. These beasts were inherently ferocious, slaughtering all living beings in sight, causing chaos within the Changyou Clan. They paid a huge price to resist the beasts and suffered heavy losses, so they didn’t discover us immediately.</p><p>“We suspect that during the lower realm’s integration process, as the realm barrier gradually dissolved and the world underwent drastic changes, those monstrous beasts wandering in the storm and the Return to Ruin instinctively felt uneasy and tried to escape. After the realm barrier weakened to a certain extent, they were the first to rush into the Great Thousand World, blocking a disaster for us.</p><p>“Even so, our situation at that time was extremely dangerous. Because after encountering the heavenly changes, although the spiritual Qi became increasingly abundant, all sorts of terrifying celestial phenomena made everyone worry that this world was about to face its end, leaving them at a loss.</p><p>“At that time, the most powerful and most promising to break through, such as Grandmaster Xing Ji of the Sweet Dew Zen Monastery and Sect Master Situ of Mount Bu Nian, were like the monstrous beasts, wanting to escape and forcefully attempt a Nascent Soul breakthrough.</p><p>“They meticulously prepared various treasures to counter the Heavenly Dao Demonic Sound, but encountered gray tribulation lightning during their tribulation crossing and were almost completely wiped out. Fairy Liu Li was a step slower, received a warning, and with the help of the tribulation-crossing formation left by Grand-Uncle, she successfully crossed the tribulation.</p><p>“Fairy Liu Li managed to negotiate with the Changyou Clan and found a way to accelerate the restoration of the Ice and Fire Tokens' power in a timely manner. She also obtained a type of Azure Spirit Qi in the turbid lands. This Azure Spirit Qi can help cultivators break through bottlenecks. Fairy Liu Li didn't keep it to herself and summoned the various races and sects for discussion. Only then did the number of fellow Daoists breaking through to the Nascent Soul stage gradually increase.</p><p>“Therefore, by the time the Changyou Clan raised a large army and launched a full-scale attack, we had a certain ability to resist, even though we still lost the Canglang Sea and the Demon Sea.</p><p>“This disciple also obtained a wisp of Azure Spirit Qi, which led to my current achievements…”</p><p>Li Yufu's words were filled with gratitude towards Liu Li. It was not just him; now, every race and sect owed Liu Li a debt of gratitude.  Coupled with Qin Sang's travels throughout the various regions and his connections with various forces, the Storm Realm was smoothly unified by Liu Li and followed her commands.</p><p>Qin Sang could imagine Liu Li busily running around, the burden of an entire realm’s survival resting on her delicate shoulders. But Liu Li shouldn't have had to do this. She didn’t cultivate the Great Ascension Path, yet in the end, it was he who benefited.</p><p>Li Yufu noticed Qin Sang’s expression. Everyone in the Green Ram Sect saw Fairy Liu Li’s contributions and had immense respect and recognition for this "Sect Mistress."  But Li Yufu knew that the grand wedding back then was a sham marriage.  Now, he couldn’t be sure if Grand-Uncle and Fairy Liu Li were truly Dao companions.</p><p>It wasn’t appropriate for him to comment on matters between his elders.  He hesitated and said, "There is one thing I need to report to Grand-Uncle."</p><p>"What is it?"</p><p>"Fairy Liu Li is not currently in the Storm Realm. It’s been announced that she’s in secluded cultivation at the Profound Sky Palace. This is to avoid causing unrest and alerting the Changyou Clan. Only this junior and Palace Master Tong are aware of this," Li Yufu said in a heavy tone.</p><p>Qin Sang was stunned.  "Liu Li isn't in the Storm Realm? Where did she go?"</p><p>Li Yufu shook his head. "This disciple doesn't know! Before leaving, Fairy Liu Li said that the patriarch of the Changyou Clan was attempting to break through to Void Refinement. Once he succeeded, no one would be able to stop him! Fairy Liu Li then went on a journey to seek an opportunity for a breakthrough. The Changyou Clan also knows about the Azure Spirit Qi and is competing with us for it, recovering a great deal of their strength. That patriarch's rapid cultivation progress is likely due to this.”</p><p>Qin Sang frowned slightly.</p><p>Liu Li’s journey was undoubtedly extremely dangerous. She only had Nascent Soul cultivation. How could she travel among countless foreign races? Even if she used secret techniques to disguise herself, encountering any random Empty Realm Second Stage expert could expose her.</p><p>Moreover, the Heavenly Division was too far from the Kan Continent. Using the Otherfolk’s teleportation formation to leave the Mist Sea and cross the vast ocean to reach the Kan Continent was practically impossible.</p><p>The best-case scenario was that she hadn't left the Zhu Yan Clan’s territory yet, and he could find a way to bring her back.</p><p>Liu Li's whereabouts were unknown.  There was no use in overthinking it now.  Qin Sang's eyes flickered, and he asked, "You said that the Azure Spirit Qi was discovered in the turbid lands.  Did it drift out from the Return to Ruin?"</p><p>Hearing from Li Yufu that the Return to Ruin hadn't appeared after the Storm Realm merged with the Great Thousand World, Qin Sang suspected that the Return to Ruin had sunk into the turbid lands, or perhaps the two were one and the same.</p><p>Back then, he had personally gone to the Return to Ruin and, gazing from afar, was shocked by the mysterious scene within. The Return to Ruin definitely held many secrets.  Unfortunately, Li Yufu didn't have any Azure Spirit Qi on hand now, so he couldn’t determine what kind of power it was from the description.</p><p>“No one has personally seen the Return to Ruin. I’ve only seen some descriptions in ancient texts, so I’m not certain. The turbid Qi ebbs and flows. Every hundred years or so, there’s a small ebb tide, and parts of the turbid lands are exposed. At that time, Azure Spirit Qi will drift out. Because there’s still residual turbid Qi there, anyone with insufficient cultivation will perish if they get close.  Moreover, the ebb tide is short-lived, and no one dares to explore deeply. We can only collect the Azure Spirit Qi from the outside," Li Yufu said.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, thinking that he should personally go and see what the turbid lands looked like and whether it was truly the River of Misfortune.</p><p>Putting aside this thought, Qin Sang then asked, "How is the Green Ram Sect doing now?"</p><p>--</p><p>--</p><p>Taking a day off for the Dragon Boat Festival to spend time with family.</p><p>Wishing everyone a healthy and happy Dragon Boat Festival.</p>
