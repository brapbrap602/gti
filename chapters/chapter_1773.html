<h1>Chapter 1764: Luring the Serpent from its Hole</h1><p>Deep within the Guidi Mountains, an almost imperceptible fluctuation registered in Qin Sang's perception, fleeting and easily missed with the slightest distraction.</p><p>Finally, a reaction!</p><p>Qin Sang's spirits lifted.  He focused all his attention, diligently employing his secret technique to search the area where the fluctuation had occurred.</p><p>An incense stick later, Qin Sang slowly opened his eyes, muttering to himself, "Is this the seed of the Dream Weaving Four Seasons Flower?"</p><p>He hadn't found the main plant, but he had sensed a unique aura at that location—a crevice in the earth.  Even if someone were to enter the depths of the earth at that moment, they wouldn't see anything unusual.</p><p>But using his secret technique, Qin Sang could perceive the aura hidden within a piece of earth and stone beside the crevice, perfectly blending with it.</p><p>This was a seed of the Dream Weaving Four Seasons Flower.</p><p>This spiritual plant's characteristic was to scatter its seeds as it moved. At a specific time each day, the flower moved randomly among its seeds. Only during those moments of movement could it be sensed with this technique.</p><p>Qin Sang's failure to find the main plant meant it had just moved.  However, he wasn't discouraged because even if he had located it, he wouldn't dare to harvest it rashly.</p><p>He had to find all the seeds and seal them off. Only by simultaneously excavating the plant and its seeds could he ensure success.</p><p>Missing even one seed risked the flower escaping and moving to a new location, making it far harder to find again.</p><p>Having confirmed the flower's existence, Qin Sang could afford to be patient.</p><p>With each movement, the Dream Weaving Four Seasons Flower revealed the location of a seed through Qin Sang's continued use of his secret technique.</p><p>Gradually, repetitions started to emerge, becoming increasingly frequent.</p><p>Furthermore, as Qin Sang became more familiar with the flower, he could use the seeds he had already located to find others.</p><p>At this point, the main plant of the Dream Weaving Four Seasons Flower was also revealed to Qin Sang.</p><p>It seemed to shift between reality and illusion. Its seeds could be sown within rocks, water, or even nestled within other plants.</p><p>The Dream Weaving Four Seasons Flower could exist anywhere, perfectly blending with its surroundings. Qin Sang only saw its true form when it moved into water.</p><p>It was a four-petaled flower. The color of the petals wasn't fixed; Qin Sang saw different colors each time, all exceptionally vibrant.</p><p>After expending considerable effort to locate the flower and all its seeds, ensuring none were missed, Qin Sang didn't act immediately.</p><p>Marking the location of all the seeds, he left the cave, his gaze sweeping across the mountain range as he silently flew towards one end of the Guidi Mountains.</p><p>The territories of the Red-tailed Demon Marshal and the Radiant Shadow Demon Marshal were located at opposite ends of the Guidi Mountains. He was heading towards the Radiant Shadow Demon Marshal's estate.</p><p>Qin Sang was planning ahead, considering the possibility of exposure and choosing the optimal location and timing for his actions.</p><p>...</p><p>While Qin Sang was busy in the Guidi Mountains…</p><p>On the border of the Gui Fang Kingdom.</p><p>Two figures descended from the clouds and entered the desolate mountains.</p><p>They moved through the forest, their figures fleeting, their auras subdued, leaving no trace.</p><p>The demons they passed seemed oblivious to their presence, as if the two didn't exist.</p><p>One wore a Daoist robe, his long beard flowing, exuding a refined and ethereal aura.</p><p>The other was peculiar, unlike any ordinary person.</p><p>This individual wore black armor, tall and powerfully built, but their exposed skin was also black.</p><p>Their skin had a metallic sheen, seemingly not flesh and blood, but a body forged from some type of spirit metal. Their movements lacked the lightness of the Daoist, possessing a heavy quality.</p><p>Their face was like cast iron, expressionless. Anyone they looked at would feel intense pressure.</p><p>Silent and reserved, they trailed half a step behind the Daoist, saying nothing, easily mistaken for a guardian automaton if not for their sharp, alert eyes.</p><p>After crossing several mountain peaks, the Daoist looked around, pausing for a moment before saying, "Friend Mo, ahead lies the territory of the Marquis of the Demon Kingdom. It's time to contact Friend Cui Wei."</p><p>The black-skinned person, without speaking, produced a jade talisman, crushing it. A flash of light passed, followed by an invisible wave.</p><p>The Daoist sensed it briefly, then said, "It seems Friend Cui Wei is not nearby. Let's continue."</p><p>The two set off again. Though on foot, their speed was unimaginable.</p><p>As they traveled, the Daoist remembered something. He took out a scroll and handed it to the dark-skinned man.  "This scroll contains eight talismans.  When they're activated together, they have the power to restrain him. During the upcoming battle with Liuhou,  Mo should hide and wait for the opportunity to unleash them. It will surely severely injure him."</p><p>The dark-skinned man silently accepted the scroll, unfurled it, and examined it closely. He frowned. "Doesn't the Daoist have a way to capture Liuhou alive?"</p><p>He knew the other man's identity: a highly esteemed official, a Ninth Heaven Golden Que Imperial Censor!</p><p>In the Daoist court, even Shengxuan Zhenren, who can preside over a regional altar, only holds the rank of a Fifth Rank Upper-Clear Xuan Du Physician.</p><p>Above him are the Fifth Rank Upper-Clear Yí Wèi Immortal Ministers, the Fourth Rank Upper-Clear Xuan Du Censors, and then finally, the Fourth Rank Ninth Heaven Golden Que Imperial Censors.</p><p>Rank represents power. This man's position in the Daoist court is second only to the five-talisman Grand Masters.  </p><p>If he remained in the heartland of the Daoist court, he would be a supreme ruler!</p><p>Their comrade Cuiwei, whom they were meeting, was also no ordinary person – a Fourth Rank Ninth Heaven Investigating Envoy from the North Pole Exorcism Institute, half a rank below this man.</p><p>"Cuiwei has clashed with the demon Liuhou once on the battlefield, and reportedly did not gain the upper hand.  We don't know how much stronger he's become in these years. It's better to be safe than sorry. We are in Gui Fang territory, so caution is necessary," the Daoist explained calmly.</p><p>The dark-skinned man was surprised. "If you don't have complete confidence, why not ask a more powerful senior to ensure success?"</p><p>"You mean ask a Grand Master?"</p><p>The Daoist slowly shook his head.  "Grand Masters must remain at their posts.  Such a trivial matter shouldn't disturb them."</p><p>The dark-skinned man disagreed. "The Daoist court's two institutes are working together, using various illusions to conceal the movements of you two. This meticulous effort shows how important Liuhou is to you. Why not ask a Grand Master to ensure success?  You're not someone who wouldn't adapt."</p><p>"It seems Mo is sincerely concerned for the Daoist court. I'm comforted by that," the Daoist smiled slightly. "There are some things you'll understand later. If a Grand Master were to come here, they wouldn't be able to hide their presence like we can."</p><p>The dark-skinned man's eyes flashed with curiosity. Seeing the Daoist's reluctance to speak further, he didn't press the matter.</p><p>The Daoist continued, "This foray into Gui Fang to hunt demons is actually Cuiwei's own initiative. Our colleagues don't approve, and I believe it's too rash. But I owe Cuiwei a favor, so I can only accompany him on this risky mission.  Liuhou probably doesn't expect us to dare infiltrate his territory to cause trouble. Cuiwei has set a trap to lure him out. If it works, our chances of success are high."</p><p>"I'm afraid the trap might be discovered, turning into a trap for us instead," the dark-skinned man was pessimistic.</p><p>"Cuiwei has been preparing for this for many years, and his plan is thorough.  It shouldn't go wrong. Once the bait is revealed, along with the subsequent plans, it will surely disrupt Liuhou's territory. Whether it can lure Liuhou out of his manor depends on luck."</p><p>The Daoist explained the plan, pausing before adding, "Of course, if things go wrong, I will advise Cuiwei not to take the risk."</p><p>The dark-skinned man seemed convinced and said no more.</p><p>The two silently flew through the mountains.</p><p>…</p><p>Liuhou's manor was as usual.</p><p>Except Liuhou, the master of the manor, was not there.</p><p>After transforming into a human, Liuhou had become a handsome man in white robes, elegant and graceful.</p><p>It was hard to connect him to the terrifying demon everyone feared.</p><p>In a secluded mountain area far from the manor, several bamboo pavilions were nestled among the mountains, with babbling streams and towering pines, absorbing the beauty of the surrounding area.</p><p>Liuhou sat cross-legged on a bamboo couch, a tea table with fragrant tea and steaming cups before him. The spiritual tea emitted a strange fragrance.</p><p>Opposite him sat a man in golden armor.</p><p>The man in golden armor sat less elegantly, sprawling carelessly.  He picked up the spiritual tea poured by Liuhou and gulped it down.</p><p>Seeing his companion's crude way of drinking the rare tea, Liu Hou shook his head repeatedly.  "This is an exceptionally rare celestial tea, highly sought after by Daoist officials.  Brother, drinking it like this is like burning fine paintings to boil water for tea!"</p><p>"Bullshit celestial tea! It's not as good as the fine spirits in my manor!"</p><p>The man in golden armor grunted in disdain, tossing the cup back onto the table. Leaning against the bamboo couch, he said lazily, "Brother, you don't plan on returning to the Marquis's manor? Just going to hide out in the wilderness?"</p><p>Liu Hou replied with a smile, "When we were uncivilized, weren't we all roughing it in the wilderness? Brother, it's only been a few years, and you're already uncomfortable?"</p><p>"I don't mind, Brother," the man in golden armor sighed, "but we haven't even seen the enemy, and we've been hiding out here, not even daring to return to the manor. It doesn't sound good, and it's likely to invite ridicule."</p><p>"Losing some face is better than losing your life!"</p><p>Liu Hou's smile vanished.  "Such a simple mission, and yet it went wrong here.  Losing a general is one thing, but I fear it might expose the upper levels' plans prematurely. Yuan Ming Wang didn't punish me, I was lucky, but there's no guarantee that the human race won't suspect me as the culprit and send people after me."</p><p>The man in golden armor was startled, sitting up straight. He said gravely, "Brother, how much do you know?  The Daoist court's designated territories, since ancient times, have only served as guardians for the Daoist court.  They haven't been of much use. We emulate the human race in establishing demon gods; is there some hidden mystery?"</p><p>Liu Hou shook his head. "Brother, I only follow orders; I couldn't possibly know more than you. However, Brother, you should remember that the term 'demon god' has been circulating for a long time. Also, the last mission to probe the human race's reaction was personally initiated by Yuan Ming Wang.  There must be a larger plan above."</p><p>Pausing, he pointed towards the heartland of Gui Fang, "Brother, have you noticed that in recent years, not only Yuan Ming Wang, but also the other kings have disappeared as if into thin air?"</p><p>The man in golden armor fell into thought, hissing, "Now that you mention it, Brother, I haven't heard of any of the kings making any significant moves these past few years."</p><p>"Exactly!"</p><p>Liu Hou said seriously, "Regardless of the truth, we must be cautious! If Yuan Ming Wang is undertaking something major, he may not be able to attend to external matters. If I am attacked, the manor may not be able to send reinforcements in time. It's better to hide outside."</p><p>The man in golden armor clicked his tongue. "Hearing you say this, Brother, I'm getting more and more curious. If the Daoist court is as you suspect, and they send people after you, then the so-called territories and demon gods may hold a shocking secret!"</p><p>He exclaimed in amazement, "The Daoist court claims to be able to summon celestial soldiers and generals and the gods of the Milky Way, yet they only fiddle with these insignificant territories. I originally scoffed at them. Could the Daoist myths and legends be true?"</p><p>"As long as the Daoist court doesn't deploy a Grand Master, capturing one might reveal some information."</p><p>Liu Hou said calmly.</p><p>"Difficult!"</p><p>The man in golden armor shook his head. "We've fought the Daoist court countless times and have captured Daoist court's Cave Xuan Masters before, and yet we still haven't found out anything. The real secrets are probably only known to Grand Masters."</p><p>At this moment, Liu Hou's expression changed drastically. He reached out to the void and grasped something, a small transparent insect appearing in his palm.</p><p>"Someone from the Daoist court?" The man in golden armor stood up, his face full of killing intent.</p><p>"Eagle Commander was suddenly killed…"</p><p>Liu Hou looked puzzled. The Eagle Commander ranked first among his subordinates, his death was a significant loss.  But if it was an assassin sent by the Daoist court, why would they reveal themselves so early, targeting such a minor commander?</p><p>Liu Hou couldn't understand it.  Was it an attempt to lure him out? It seemed too reckless.</p><p>"How many came?" the man in golden armor pressed.</p><p>Liu Hou hesitated. "It seems like only one."</p><p>The man in golden armor coldly snorted. "It's definitely a trap to lure us out. Since there's no aura of a Grand Master, let's see if they can handle us! Let's go!"</p><p>The two demons vanished in a flash.</p><p>Meanwhile.</p><p>Qin Sang was on Gui Die Mountain, collecting the Four Seasons Dream Flowers.</p><p>He had investigated two commanders' manors, then left Gui Die Mountain, continuing deeper to ascertain the surrounding terrain, the demonic army's strength, and estimate the time it would take for the Marquis to arrive, finally formulating a strategy.</p><p>Silently, he had set up restrictions around all the Dream Flowers' seeds.</p><p>Qin Sang locked onto the main flower, formed a hand seal, his gaze darkening, and suddenly pressed down on the ground.</p><p>At the same time.</p><p>Northwest of the Marquis’s manor, only a few hundred miles away, Cui Wei Zhenren was waiting for reinforcements.</p><p>The reinforcements were arriving.</p><p>But then, he saw the body of a giant black eagle at his feet, his face turning ashen.</p><p>He was hiding here, waiting for the right moment, believing himself to be perfectly concealed.  Since he was in enemy territory, he didn't dare to unleash his spiritual sense recklessly.  He didn't know what kind of supernatural power the eagle used to suddenly appear and break in.</p><p>The eagle was extremely alert, sensing something was wrong, and was about to send a warning signal.</p><p>In a hurry, Cui Wei Zhenren had no choice but to kill the eagle, but he was unable to prevent the warning.</p><p>The plan had failed before it even started!</p><p>Cui Wei Zhenren could already feel the Marquis's aura approaching rapidly.</p><p>What alarmed him was that there was more than one aura!</p><p>At that moment, in the Marquis's manor.</p><p>A Daoist quietly arrived, glanced to the north, a slight smile on his lips.  He flicked his finger, a sword light shooting from his fingertip, heading straight for the manor. </p>
