<h1>Chapter 1963: Revenge</h1><p>Sand, scattered stones in water.</p><p>A descendant of the illustrious Sha Clan, yet reduced to a stray dog, living a precarious existence, until now not daring to reveal his true name.</p><p>The Shi surname…</p><p>More precisely, the young man of the Sha Clan, shifted his 'gaze' from Bai Li Qingkong, 'looking' towards the group of Yin Clan members, and Nian Hui!</p><p>Among them, perhaps only the Yin Clan hadn't kicked the Sha Clan while they were down.</p><p>But he and the Yin Clan, and the former Fourth Miss of the Yin Clan, now Nian Hui, shared a profound connection!</p><p>However, the young man of the Sha Clan didn't treat the Yin Clan members differently. At this moment, everyone, including Nian Hui, were mere pawns in his hands!</p><p>The young man's eyes flashed, and he vanished in a blink.</p><p>The underground tunnels, like a net, trembled incessantly in utter chaos, yet the young man remained unaffected, silently speeding through them.</p><p>Soon, he entered a tunnel where the fluctuations of colliding Dao techniques echoed, accompanied by furious curses and shouts.</p><p>At the tunnel's end, two groups suddenly encountered each other, colliding without warning.</p><p>The two sides were cultivators from the Cold Moxibustion Valley and the Parrot Mountain You Clan.</p><p>With the sudden upheaval, everyone's nerves were on edge, instinctively acting in self-preservation, and they immediately clashed.</p><p>Enmity already existed between the Cold Moxibustion Valley and the Parrot Mountain. Recognizing each other, they didn't cease their attacks but instead roared furiously, launching fierce assaults.</p><p>The cultivators of the Cold Moxibustion Valley were each adept at wielding Frost Needles.</p><p>Acting in unison, they launched hundreds, even thousands of Frost Needles towards their enemies. The needles' trails dragged blue icy energy, resembling a surging glacial inferno, a truly magnificent sight.</p><p>Compared to the Cold Moxibustion Valley, the You Clan cultivators were fewer in number.</p><p>The Parrot Mountain You Clan specialized in Spirit Formations, but the narrow terrain was highly disadvantageous to them. Their formations were disrupted by the upheaval, and they had no time to regroup. As soon as the battle began, they were at a disadvantage.</p><p>"Kill them! Don't let a single one escape!"</p><p>Someone from the Cold Moxibustion Valley shouted excitedly.</p><p>This was a rare opportunity.  Slaying all these You Clan cultivators here, no one would know it was their doing.</p><p>If the You Clan knew the secrets of the Heavenly Pulse Sect, they had to be eliminated!</p><p>The Cold Moxibustion Valley's assault intensified, ferocious and relentless.  The You Clan cultivators, trapped between a rock and a hard place, were quickly driven into a desperate situation.</p><p>This was precisely what the young man of the Sha Clan wanted to see.</p><p>He concealed himself in the shadows, coldly observing, like a venomous viper waiting to strike.</p><p>Similar scenarios were unfolding in other parts of the ruins.</p><p>Some had prior grudges, some encountered Heavenly Pulse Sect treasures and fought over them, while others clashed over the slightest disagreements.</p><p>In the dark depths, slaughter was ubiquitous.</p><p>The fiercest battle took place where the Yin Clan was located.</p><p>Yin Heqian and Bai Li Qingkong were already locked in combat.</p><p>The shockwaves emanating from the duel between these two Nascent Soul cultivators were enough to deter others from approaching.</p><p>The remaining members of the Yin Clan and the Bai Li Clan could only engage in separate skirmishes nearby.</p><p>Logically, the Bai Li Clan, with only three members, wouldn't be able to withstand the Yin Clan. However, shortly after their clash began, other forces arrived one after another.</p><p>The Yin Clan, the first to trigger the upheaval and the strongest present, immediately became the target of everyone's attacks, finding themselves besieged.</p><p>Yin Heqian and Bai Li Qingkong were entangled, unable to extricate themselves.</p><p>All the Yin Clan members gathered around Nian Hui, jointly resisting the onslaught. Yet Nian Hui, who should have been their pillar of strength, appeared dazed, putting the Yin Clan in grave danger.</p><p>"Nian Hui!"</p><p>An elder of the Yin Clan shouted, his face filled with anxiety.</p><p>Nian Hui's vacant eyes finally flickered, as if awakening from a dream.</p><p>The bitterness in her heart deepened.</p><p>Her gaze swept across the surroundings and then towards the bottom of the well.  Nian Hui tried to search, wanting to find that person, that familiar yet unfamiliar figure, but to no avail.</p><p>Glancing at Bai Li Qingkong, Nian Hui's gaze lingered for a moment.</p><p>The Sha Clan, the Bai Li Clan…</p><p>She recalled the past, when the entire Yin Clan, including herself, stood by and watched as the Bai Li Clan annihilated the Sha Clan.</p><p>Even though she had been confined by her clan back then.</p><p>Yet Nian Hui couldn't convince herself, couldn't imagine his despair at that time.</p><p>But she couldn't do anything, not even stay by his side.</p><p>All their vows of eternal love had become a cruel joke.</p><p>Those scenes from the past haunted her like a nightmare, tormenting her, causing sleepless nights, even to this day.</p><p>Nian Hui had initially thought that this time, he was merely using the Yin Clan's power to open the Heavenly Pulse Sect ruins and obtain its inheritance. She was willing to cooperate, seeing it as a form of atonement.</p><p>Upon seeing Bai Li Qingkong, Nian Hui finally understood.</p><p>As expected, he wouldn't forgive her so easily.</p><p>At this moment, it felt as though a pair of eyes were watching her from the shadows, as if demanding: What will you do this time?</p><p>"Are you watching me?"</p><p>Nian Hui's lips moved, uttering a silent question, but she received no response.</p><p>At this moment, she finally made up her mind, making a certain choice, transmitting her voice to the surrounding clan members.</p><p>The Yin Clan members agreed to Nian Hui's proposal.</p><p>The Yin Clan elder reminded, "Alright, lest the night grow long and dreams become reality! Nian Hui, be wary of Bai Li Qingkong. That scoundrel has some treacherous and insidious techniques."</p><p>The Yin Clan members secretly activated their Dao techniques.</p><p>In the next instant, the Yin Clan's formation drastically shifted, and everyone took out identical tokens.</p><p>The tokens were wooden, with naturally formed tree rings resembling a real tree, inlaid on their surface, lifelike and exquisite.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>The tokens left their hands, soaring into the air.</p><p>In the next moment, a rich green light erupted, emitting a refreshing aura, sweeping away the stagnant and earthy atmosphere of the underground space.</p><p>The green light enveloped everyone on the battlefield, except for the two Nascent Soul cultivators.</p><p>Before the enemies could react, roots sprouted from above their heads, then transformed into towering trees, lush and vibrant, as solid as if they were truly real.</p><p>These trees took root atop everyone's heads, gently swaying.</p><p>At this moment, everyone felt an astonishing pressure descend upon them, an unavoidable pressure that carried a binding and restraining force.</p><p>Almost all the enemies' bodies stiffened for a moment, and even their True Essence faltered for an instant.</p><p>"Mountain Stabilizing Divine Tree!"</p><p>Someone cried out in alarm, recognizing the divine ability, but it was too late.</p><p>Including the three members of the Bai Li Clan, their fierce offensive momentarily stagnated, creating an opening, giving the Yin Clan a chance to breathe.</p><p>Nian Hui had been waiting for this opportunity.</p><p>Without hesitation, she stomped her right foot heavily in the void, and a burst of azure light erupted beneath her foot, giving rise to dozens of emerald green vines.</p><p>The vines were slender but exceptionally tough.  They lashed out fiercely at the enemies, like steel whips, producing ear-piercing whistling sounds that made people's faces change color.</p><p>With the force of the vines, Nian Hui broke through a gap in the encirclement, successfully escaping, then wrapped herself in the green vines and plummeted downwards.</p><p>*Thud!*</p><p>*Bang! Bang! Bang!*</p><p>Several attacks followed closely behind, all blocked by the green vines.</p><p>The vines shattered, and Nian Hui within, her aura in disarray, but without significant injuries.</p><p>"You dare!"</p><p>Suddenly, a furious roar came from the side.</p><p>Nian Hui felt an incredibly scorching aura approaching, like molten lava pouring down. The shattered vine fragments instantly turned to ash, and even her hair curled from the heat.</p><p>But Nian Hui showed no fear, her descent accelerating.</p><p>On the nearby battlefield.</p><p>The moment Nian Hui moved, Yin Heqian unleashed his long-prepared divine ability.  A gray light shot out from his sleeve, transforming into a blade aura mid-air, aimed directly at Bai Li Qingkong's head, cleaving down from above!</p><p>Unexpectedly, Bai Li Qingkong was even more formidable. Facing the blade aura, he showed no intention of dodging.  A golden light flickered on his chest, and a golden necklace flew out, its pendant a crimson crystal.</p><p>*Crack!*</p><p>The crystal shattered.</p><p>A deafening roar instantly erupted.</p><p>Faintly, a giant turtle materialized, its entire body composed of flames. The color of its shell was exceptionally deep, and the flames strangely gave off a sense of heaviness.</p><p>As the giant turtle appeared, it completely shielded Bai Li Qingkong beneath it.</p><p>*Thud!*</p><p>The blade aura struck the giant turtle, stirring up滔天 waves of fire. The giant turtle was nearly cleaved in two, but the blade aura's momentum was greatly diminished, no longer enough to threaten Bai Li Qingkong.</p><p>Bai Li Qingkong, extremely confident in the giant turtle, completely ignored the blade aura!</p><p>Yin Heqian hadn't expected him to block the attack so easily. His heart sank.  If Bai Li Qingkong attacked Nian Hui now, she would be in extreme danger!</p><p>"Careful!"</p><p>Yin Heqian yelled, shaking his sleeve forcefully, launching a large net that enveloped Bai Li Qingkong in an attempt to remedy the situation.</p><p>Bai Li Qingkong snorted disdainfully, lunging forward, narrowly avoiding the net. Simultaneously, a crimson rainbow shot out from his waist, instantly transforming the surroundings into a sea of fire.</p><p>Nian Hui was engulfed by the flames, struggling desperately, her eyes filled with terror.</p><p>Bai Li Qingkong looked at Nian Hui, his eyes glinting with killing intent, flicking his finger to shoot a crimson spike.</p><p>The spike, formed from intensely condensed flames, was incredibly sharp, its speed like lightning, about to pierce Nian Hui's vital point in the blink of an eye.</p><p>At this moment, the panic on Nian Hui's face suddenly vanished. Facing the spike, she didn't flinch.  She opened her right hand, revealing a green orb the size of a baby's fist in her palm.</p><p>"Ethereal Wood Sky-Splitting Thunder!"</p><p>Yin Heqian's pupils constricted sharply.</p><p>The Ethereal Wood Sky-Splitting Thunder was the Yin Clan's ultimate treasure. Only those who cultivated the Yin Clan's core cultivation method to a very high level could refine it, and it required a tremendous amount of the refiner's energy and time, so it wasn't created lightly.</p><p>The one Nian Hui possessed was given to her by the previous Clan Head, their father, as a means of protection, a form of compensation.</p><p>Seeing Nian Hui take out the Ethereal Wood Sky-Splitting Thunder, Yin Heqian wasn't pleased, but alarmed.</p><p>The Ethereal Wood Sky-Splitting Thunder's power was immense, but if activated by someone other than its creator, it would also backfire, causing great harm to the user.</p><p>Using the Ethereal Wood Sky-Splitting Thunder at this time might not severely injure Bai Li Qingkong, but it would be no different from suicide.</p><p>"No! Fourth Sister, dodge!" Yin Heqian roared.</p><p>Nian Hui remained deaf to his pleas, holding the Ethereal Wood Sky-Splitting Thunder in her hand, her True Essence surging into it madly. Green lightning crackled across the orb's surface.</p><p>Silently, the green orb exploded.</p><p>Green light filled the entire space, and everyone was enveloped in a layer of green armor.</p><p>Then, ear-splitting thunderclaps resounded.</p><p>Underground thunder, even suppressing the tremors of the earth.</p><p>The flame spike was also detonated by the Ethereal Wood Sky-Splitting Thunder, thunder light mingling with crimson flames, engulfing Nian Hui at point-blank range.</p><p>At the last moment, Nian Hui still showed no fear or regret.</p><p>"Is this enough?"</p><p>Nian Hui asked silently in her heart, a look of relief appearing on her face.</p><p>Somewhere underground.</p><p>The young man of the Sha Clan 'watched' this scene.  The moment Nian Hui detonated the Ethereal Wood Sky-Splitting Thunder, he hesitated slightly, but ultimately suppressed it, not intervening.</p><p>As Nian Hui disappeared amidst the thunder light and flames, the young man's fingers twitched, a hint of regret in his expression, and he sighed softly.</p><p>Upon seeing Nian Hui at the Green Ram Temple, he had discerned her state of mind and decided to use her for his revenge.</p><p>But at the moment of its realization, he realized that while he could stop at nothing for revenge, his true nature still couldn't be completely indifferent.</p><p>"Bai Li Qingkong, I will kill you!"</p><p>Yin Heqian roared, ignoring the residual waves of the Ethereal Wood Sky-Splitting Thunder, rushing forward madly, his entire body radiating green light, transforming into an ancient tree, slamming heavily into his opponent.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>Bai Li Qingkong was exerting all his effort to withstand the Ethereal Wood Sky-Splitting Thunder when he suddenly felt a tremendous impact on his chest, a sharp pain that instantly drained the color from his face.</p><p>"Pfft!"</p><p>Bai Li Qingkong spat out blood. Relying on his protective armor to dissipate the force, his body contorted as he was sent flying sideways.</p><p>Yin Heqian gave up on pursuing Bai Li Qingkong, reaching out towards the center of the thunder light with a grasping motion, retrieving a limp body.</p><p>Nian Hui's robes were severely damaged, chaotic thunder and fire energies rampaged within her body, wreaking havoc. Her eyes were tightly shut, seemingly lifeless.</p><p>After a brief check, a glimmer of hope flickered in Yin Heqian's eyes.</p><p>Nian Hui still had a breath of life left!</p><p>Perhaps the Ethereal Wood Sky-Splitting Thunder had blocked the force of the flame spike, buffering the impact for Nian Hui, allowing her to narrowly escape death.</p><p>But Nian Hui's internal condition was extremely dire. He could help her gather the thunder energy, but the power of the flame spike was very strange and not so easily suppressed.</p><p>Yin Heqian embraced Nian Hui, repeatedly tapping acupuncture points on her body. Suddenly, a sense of danger arose in his heart.  A tree shadow projected from his body, blocking Bai Li Qingkong's sneak attack.</p><p>Bai Li Qingkong wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth.  Injured, his expression was no longer as relaxed as before. Facing Yin Heqian's murderous gaze, he was secretly wary. Glancing at Nian Hui, he sneered, "So this is the reclusive Fourth Miss of the Yin Clan?  Daring to let my Fire Poison enter her body, if Clan Head Yin doesn't personally purge the poison for her, I'm afraid she'll wither away within a hundred breaths."</p><p>"Good! Good! Good! Yin has witnessed your methods today, brother, and I will certainly remember them!"</p><p>Yin Heqian gritted his teeth, repeating the word "good" three times.</p><p>Just then, a more violent tremor came from the bottom of the well. Several spheres of spiritual light flickered unsteadily, as if some restriction had been triggered by their battle, instantly generating a storm that erupted from the well.</p><p>The storm's power was astonishing. For a moment, no one could stand their ground, and they were all blown away.</p><p>Seeing this, although Yin Heqian knew that treasures of the Heavenly Pulse Sect were likely about to appear, saving a life was paramount. He retreated, holding Nian Hui in his arms.</p><p>Bai Li Qingkong, intending to seize the treasures as quickly as possible while the opportunity presented itself, activated his protective treasures after a brief investigation and plunged into the heart of the storm.</p><p>…</p><p>At this time, the fighting elsewhere hadn't ceased, and the situation was escalating.</p><p>Few noticed that the blood from the dead and injured seeped into the ground, flowing into the stone pools, staining the murals crimson.</p><p>(End of Chapter)</p>
