<h1>Chapter 1739:  The Human Field</h1><p>The cabin was sealed by a magical barrier, isolating the noisy waves outside.</p><p>In the silent space, a strange voice suddenly spoke, saying he was going to die.  One can imagine how terrifying this was.</p><p>Especially when Qin Sang discovered the voice originated from the Sun God Tree, he felt a chill run down his spine, and his back almost broke out in a cold sweat.</p><p>In an instant, Qin Sang's mind raced, his body tensing.</p><p>Fortunately, he maintained his composure and didn't lose his composure on the spot.</p><p>"Who are you?"</p><p>Qin Sang stared at the Sun God Tree, confirming the sound was coming from within the tree.</p><p>"Just as you think,"</p><p>The child's voice rang out again, its tone profound and enigmatic. Then, it emphasized, "You are going to die!"</p><p>This time, Qin Sang saw it.</p><p>As the voice sounded, the nine divine birds perched on the branches of the Sun God Tree turned their heads, all staring at him at once.</p><p>Being stared at by nine pairs of eyes made of flames would make anyone's heart pound.</p><p>Each word spoken was accompanied by a sunbird opening its beak, the next word spoken by the next bird.</p><p>Thus, the entire sentence was spoken in turn by the nine divine birds, yet without any hesitation, flowing smoothly as one entity.</p><p>The speaker likely had the ability to control the sunbirds; at such close range, if the nine birds attacked together, the consequences would be unimaginable.</p><p>Yet Qin Sang didn't dodge, remaining cautiously alert.</p><p>The Sun God Tree had followed him for centuries. If the entity had wanted to harm him, it wouldn't have waited until now.</p><p>"Are you the spirit of the Vermilion Bird?"</p><p>Qin Sang's mind raced.</p><p>The Sun God Tree was crafted by his own hands, but it was vastly different from a normal magical artifact.</p><p>Its creation followed the method deduced by the Kui Yin Ancestor, similar to the Ten Directions Yama Banner; it was essentially a container for the Vermilion Bird's true feathers.</p><p>The power of the Nan Ming Li Fire within the Vermilion Bird's true feathers was too violent; it needed the core of the Sun God Tree, namely the green copper piece, to suppress it, along with the Nine-Lives Xuan Turtle shell, mysterious white copper, and other spiritual objects, all pieced together.</p><p>The Sun God Tree was not quite a magical artifact; Qin Sang, intending to refine the Nan Ming Li Fire, had never used secret techniques to refine it, and according to common sense, it shouldn't have spontaneously developed sentience.</p><p>Only one possibility remained.</p><p>The Vermilion Bird's true feathers!</p><p>After obtaining the Vermilion Bird's true feathers, although Qin Sang had repeatedly used the Sun God Tree to repel strong enemies, he could only manipulate the Nan Ming Li Fire to condense the sunbirds; he could never touch the Vermilion Bird's true feathers themselves.</p><p>Later, many attempts to refine the Nan Ming Li Fire using the *Fire Seed Golden Lotus* all failed.</p><p>He actually knew nothing about the Vermilion Bird's true feathers.</p><p>"Did you even hear what I'm saying!"</p><p>The Vermilion Bird spirit seemed impatient. "I'm not lying to you, you really are going to die!"</p><p>These words didn't sound like they came from a cunning old ghost who had been lurking for years.</p><p>It sounded like an unsatisfied child.</p><p>Or was it deliberate deception?</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes flashed; he exhaled softly, "My lifespan isn't over, nor do I have any powerful enemies; why would I die?"</p><p>The Vermilion Bird spirit let out two sneers in succession, but because the voice was clear and sounded like a child's, it gave a rather childishly cute impression.</p><p>"You don't have powerful enemies hunting you; you're courting death yourself!"</p><p>Seeming to feel that this threat wasn't enough, the Vermilion Bird spirit sneered twice more, "You have the aura of a Kirin!"</p><p>But to its disappointment, Qin Sang's expression remained unchanged, his eyes showing not terror, but more bewilderment and confusion.</p><p>Qin Sang simply didn't understand what it was saying!</p><p>The Kirin, a legendary beast, is mentioned in ancient texts, a being no less significant than dragons and phoenixes.</p><p>He had actually interacted with quite a few divine beasts—the Vermilion Bird's and Celestial Phoenix's true feathers were nearby, and he had absorbed the Green Luan's true blood, rebuilding his phoenix wings.</p><p>But where did the Kirin come from?</p><p>"I don't understand what you're saying," Qin Sang replied honestly.</p><p>"Humph! Humph! By the time you understand, it'll be too late. The Kirin's essence has awakened within you. Oh, in your terms, it should be called possession!"</p><p>The Vermilion Bird's voice was low, but it felt like it was trying its best to create a terrifying atmosphere to frighten the other party.</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze shifted, and he suddenly snorted coldly, "This cultivator has never seen any Kirin; don't spread false rumors! You've been lurking beside this cultivator for so many years, and now you suddenly appear; what exactly is your purpose?"</p><p>The Vermilion Bird spirit spoke in a tone of exasperation, shouting, "This Vermilion Bird has appeared to save you! If a little more time passes, the Kirin's source will awaken within you, and it will be impossible to reverse!"</p><p>"Kirin's source?"</p><p>Qin Sang was startled, finding it even more absurd.</p><p>At that moment, Qin Sang noticed the divine bird on the Sun God Tree shifting its gaze from him to the hovering fire lotus.  A sudden thought struck him.</p><p>“You mean this?” Qin Sang pointed at the fire lotus, his expression finally changing.</p><p>“The aura is faint, likely due to dormancy, but it's definitely a Qilin!”</p><p>The Vermillion Bird spirit mumbled a couple of times before speaking louder, “When the fire lotus blooms, the primordial seed will sprout. The Qilin is nurtured within the lotus platform and will return to the world. Though you nurtured it, it won’t thank you; it will eat you first!”</p><p>Fire lotus, lotus platform…</p><p>Qin Sang had cultivated the *Fire Seed Golden Lotus* technique for many years and knew exactly what these terms meant.</p><p>This technique had three stages: the first, condensing the fire lotus seed; the second, birthing the fire lotus; and the third, the lotus transforming into a lotus platform!</p><p>According to the Vermillion Bird spirit, once he painstakingly cultivated this technique to its third stage, creating the lotus platform and achieving ultimate mastery, he would be replaced by the Qilin.</p><p>Would he become nothing more than a cultivator who unwittingly nurtures the Qilin’s primordial seed, his spiritual fire serving as sustenance—sustenance he actively sought?</p><p>Qin Sang's face turned grim.</p><p>The *Fire Seed Golden Lotus* was the most powerful refining technique he had ever encountered. By refining enough spiritual fire, one could possess divine sense far exceeding one's cultivation level, a tremendous boon when breaking through to the Transcendence stage.  Who would have thought it held such a trap!</p><p>So what exactly was this Qilin primordial seed?</p><p>It couldn’t be that everyone who cultivates this technique has a Qilin reviving within them.</p><p>Qin Sang immediately recalled the transparent lotus seed, something he had once deemed useless, even almost traded away!</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang's distress, the Vermillion Bird spirit said with satisfaction, “See? Your fire lotus has already formed many petals, showing your high cultivation. The Qilin primordial seed has already taken root. Otherwise, why do you think it was so easy to cultivate?”</p><p>“Thank you, senior, for the warning,” Qin Sang’s expression shifted several times before he offered his thanks, even addressing the spirit as a senior, seemingly intimidated.</p><p>In truth, he only believed about half of it.</p><p>During his cultivation of the *Fire Seed Golden Lotus*, he hadn't noticed anything unusual.</p><p>Was this technique easy to cultivate?</p><p>Qin Sang didn't think so.</p><p>While it granted divine sense far surpassing his peers, allowing him to rival Transcendence cultivators at the Nascent Soul stage—a testament to the technique’s profoundness—he also had to thank the Nine Netherworld Inferno.</p><p>The Nine Netherworld Inferno was not of this world; others would almost certainly never obtain such high-grade demonic fire.  If Qin Sang had to collect spiritual fire bit by bit, it would have taken him an immeasurable amount of time.</p><p>Looking back on his cultivation journey, he had encountered numerous bottlenecks, forced to use various rare and precious spiritual items to break through.</p><p>But could this be related to his not keeping the transparent lotus seed within him?</p><p>Initially, Qin Sang had placed great importance on the transparent lotus seed, repeatedly experimenting with it, feeling that it could aid in refining spiritual fire, preventing the cultivator from being consumed by the fire and protecting their soul.</p><p>Refining spiritual fire into the Purple Mansion and condensing the fire lotus seed with one's soul was inherently extremely dangerous.</p><p>But Qin Sang had the Jade Buddha for protection, needing no other assistance.</p><p>He had experienced similar setbacks before and, seeing no need to keep the transparent lotus seed in his Purple Mansion, had stored it away.</p><p>According to the Vermillion Bird spirit, the Qilin primordial seed gradually revived during cultivation, perhaps gradually revealing unexpected benefits, making further cultivation less arduous.</p><p>Unbeknownst to him, the faster the cultivation, the faster the death!</p><p>“Warning you is useless. The Qilin primordial seed is progressively reviving; you are gravely ill and powerless to stop its awakening, only a matter of time!” The Vermillion Bird spirit seemed to sigh for Qin Sang, yet its tone held an uncontainable lilt.</p><p>Qin Sang frowned. “Senior means that even if I stop cultivating this technique now, there's no cure?”</p><p>“Correct!”</p><p>Nine sun god birds nodded in unison. “Unless you end your own life, allowing it to seek another host, you will inevitably die! Only this Vermillion Bird can save you!”</p><p>The Vermillion Bird spirit suddenly fell silent.</p><p>Qin Sang understood; the other party was clearly waiting for him to ask for help.</p><p>The Vermillion Bird spirit's intentions were too obvious.  Qin Sang complied, bowing respectfully, “Please, senior, save me!”</p><p>The Vermillion Bird spirit chuckled. The nine divine birds on the tree stirred, seeming to want to spread their wings and take flight, but ultimately remained still.</p><p>Qin Sang’s eyes flashed, his expression unchanged.</p><p>He heard the Vermillion Bird spirit say, “I have a method to help you suppress the Qilin primordial seed, which won't harm your cultivation and will prevent possession.”</p><p>“Since senior has appeared, you must be kind-hearted, unwilling to see this humble cultivator suffer.  You wish to save me from this calamity. But I wonder, what must I do to receive senior’s technique?” Qin Sang’s tone was extremely respectful, his expression pleading.</p><p>The Vermilion Bird spirit, sensing Qin Sang's compliance, became smug.  "If you agree to my three… no… four… four requests, I will save you!"</p><p>Each sentence from the Vermilion Bird spirit was spoken by nine divine birds in turn. The change from three to four requests mid-sentence, sounded like the birds were arguing, a peculiar sight.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes narrowed.  "What four things, senior? Please be specific."  If the situation were reversed, with another's life in his hands, wouldn't he simply dictate the terms?  This Vermilion Bird spirit was either incredibly naive or toying with him.</p><p>The Vermilion Bird spirit spoke rapidly: "First, I, the Vermilion Bird, will teach you how to suppress the Kirin Primordial Essence. You must follow my instructions and help me extract the essence from it."</p><p>Qin Sang's expression shifted slightly. "This essence is useful to you, senior?"</p><p>"It will help me recover…"</p><p>The Vermilion Bird spirit realized it had misspoken and quickly changed its tone. "You've earned your keep. I won't take all the essence, and the extraction process will also greatly benefit you."</p><p>Qin Sang feigned ignorance, nodding. "What's the second condition?"</p><p>"Give me that feather!"</p><p>The Sun Birds all looked at the Heavenly Phoenix True Feather in Qin Sang's hand, their eyes burning with intense flames, radiating heat.</p><p>So it was after the Heavenly Phoenix Feather! Qin Sang had already suspected this. The Vermilion Bird spirit hadn't appeared sooner or later, but precisely when he obtained the feather.</p><p>"Is this feather also a divine beast's primordial essence, containing phoenix energy?" Qin Sang looked down at the remaining feather fragment.  He paused, then said, "A Kirin nearly killed me; I dare not let another divine beast's essence enter my body."</p><p>"Don't ask so many questions.  Just give me the feather, follow my orders, and I guarantee your safety." The Vermilion Bird spirit's tone suddenly became firm.</p><p>Seeing he couldn't get more information, Qin Sang hesitated. "I tried to refine the demonic fire within the feather and failed, as you witnessed. I don't dare cultivate the ‘Fire Seed Golden Lotus’ anymore. I lack phoenix bloodline; I can neither refine nor control it. This treasure is useless to me.  I wouldn't mind giving it to you, senior, but I need to hear your other conditions first. If you ask for something I can't do, I'd rather die with it."</p><p>The Vermilion Bird spirit snorted. "My remaining conditions offer you incredible benefits, opportunities others would kill for. You dare haggle?"</p><p>Qin Sang responded with an "Oh," listening attentively.</p><p>The nine birds raised their heads, haughty and arrogant. "That Kirin, capable of condensing primordial essence, must have been extremely powerful.  Perhaps it faced a formidable enemy, had to rely on the essence to escape, and ended up here. Its true essence must be hidden elsewhere. Once it recovers its essence, it will quickly regain its strength."</p><p>"The Kirin's true essence?" Qin Sang was intrigued.</p><p>He didn't know the Kirin's former cultivation level, but the fact it could exist in essence form for countless years and set traps that even Transcendence cultivators couldn't detect spoke volumes!</p><p>"The Kirin's true essence must be deeply hidden, but it's connected to the primordial essence. We can use it to find it. I'll help you refine the primordial essence, and you'll feel it. Help me find the Kirin's true essence, and I'll reward you accordingly."</p><p>The Vermilion Bird spirit's voice was crisp and enticing. "The Kirin's true essence is a wondrous thing, capable of transforming you!"</p><p>"This…"</p><p>Qin Sang hesitated. "Kirins are divine beasts, I'm human. Our bloodlines are different. I doubt I can refine it."</p><p>The Vermilion Bird spirit scoffed. "The Kirin's true essence is the purest energy in the world.  Erase the Kirin's mark, and it can be refined.  Even if you can't handle it, I'll find a way!"</p><p>Its tone was confident.  But Qin Sang could tell the Vermilion Bird spirit wasn't entirely sure.  The existence of the Kirin's true essence was probably just speculation.</p><p>"What's the fourth condition?"</p><p>The Vermilion Bird spirit hesitated. "I haven't thought of the fourth one yet. But don't worry, I need your help to find the Kirin's true essence; I won't ask you to do anything beyond your abilities. From now on, you can't leave my side. Obey my commands, focus on refining the Kirin's primordial essence, and find its true essence."</p><p>It seemed to be already envisioning a bright future, becoming more excited, speaking faster and faster, the nine birds chattering excitedly.</p><p>"Once we find the Kirin's true essence, I'll share some with you and accept your offerings. Offer enough tributes, and I will protect you and your descendants!"</p>
