<h1>Chapter 1585: The Vast World</h1><p>The turbulent currents shifted.  Whether this was a normal phenomenon or a result of Su Zinan forcibly opening the Wuwang Hall remained unclear.</p><p>Qin Sang remained cautious.</p><p>After passing the previous point, the turbulent currents revealed a different scene.</p><p>Su Zinan continued moving forward, circling the outer edges of the turbulence, his purpose unknown.</p><p>The depths of the ruins should be above.</p><p>At that moment, Qin Sang sensed something and looked up.  A dark shadow plummeted from above.  She quickly dodged, narrowly avoiding several currents that brushed past her.</p><p>Upon closer inspection, it was a massive stone.</p><p>The stone was perfectly square, tumbling within the turbulent currents.  The glow of runes flickered, indicating protective enchantments that prevented it from being pulverized.</p><p>Qin Sang noticed colorful patterns etched on the stone's surface, their meaning unclear.  Clearly man-made, it was likely part of a larger structure.</p><p>The entire structure had disintegrated.</p><p>After the stone passed, more and more luminous points appeared above, clearly various fragments, erupting from the turbulent currents like a tidal wave.</p><p>“Hiss…”</p><p>Qin Sang took a deep breath and quickly dodged.</p><p>The fragments were extremely dense, though thankfully Qin Sang wasn't in the direct center.  However, it was still troublesome.  Initially, she could dodge, but eventually had to use her demonic fire to forcibly blaze a path.</p><p>To avoid detection by Su Zinan, Qin Sang suppressed the fluctuations of her demonic fire, nearly losing track of him.</p><p>Thanks to her cultivation and abilities, Qin Sang emerged unscathed.  Others weren't so lucky.</p><p>Many Nascent Soul cultivators, already struggling to reach this point, were struck by the fragments.  Many were injured and retreated in defeat.</p><p>After the wave of fragments, the secret realm calmed down for a while.</p><p>The situation was too chaotic.  The Sky-Eye Butterfly was focused on Su Zinan's movements and couldn't be distracted, leaving Qin Sang to be vigilant against changes from the depths of the turbulent currents.</p><p>“Could the entire Wuwang Hall have been shattered? There should still be things preserved inside.  Why is Su Zinan wandering around instead of entering?”</p><p>This thought had just crossed Qin Sang's mind.</p><p>Moments later, the Sky-Eye Butterfly transmitted a message: Su Zinan and his group had changed direction and were heading upwards.</p><p>…</p><p>In the leading group,</p><p>Su Zinan led the way, Mo Xingdao and the Underworld Guards flanked him, followed by the assistants Su Zinan had recruited, including the Crying Spirit Cave Master.</p><p>Even late-stage Nascent Soul cultivators found this location challenging.</p><p>Maintaining formation within the turbulent currents was extremely difficult; a moment's carelessness could lead to dispersion.</p><p>The Crying Spirit Cave Master remained silent, secretly observing Su Zinan.</p><p>When the fragments flew past, he sensed the commotion behind him, glanced back, and clicked his tongue in amazement: “Thankfully, we had Daoist Su leading the way, preventing a reckless charge and avoiding this wave of impact. I heard that the Eight Scenery Pavilion and the Ganlu Chan Monastery were scattered by a similar wave. They should have invited Daoist Su as a guide, then they wouldn't have suffered such heavy losses.”</p><p>Su Zinan replied calmly, “Cave Master, you flatter me.  I simply learned about the previous incident and, with this precedent, made my plans accordingly.”</p><p>The Crying Spirit Cave Master nodded slightly, but inwardly he didn't believe a word.</p><p>He had been a firsthand witness to the previous event.</p><p>After the Ganlu Chan Monastery and the Eight Scenery Pavilion entered, the fragments erupted some time later.</p><p>The ruins were full of chaos; based on the previous event alone, it was impossible to predict the pattern.</p><p>Unless Su Zinan knew something beforehand.</p><p>Su Zinan fell silent after his reply.</p><p>His back to the others, his expression was somewhat gloomy.</p><p>He blamed Old Master Lu for not explaining things clearly back then; Su Zinan hadn't dared to ask further questions.</p><p>The power of the turbulent currents within the Wuwang Hall ruins far exceeded Su Zinan's expectations, stronger than during its last opening.</p><p>Even with the full assistance of his helpers, he couldn't reach his goal and had to abandon one of his objectives.</p><p>Unbeknownst to him, the secret realm had a cyclical pattern of change.</p><p>When the power of the turbulent currents was at its weakest, the secret realm's marker stabilized, and its connection to the outside world was clearest. During this period, it was relatively easy to locate. The Eight Scenery Pavilion and the Ganlu Chan Monastery had exploited this timing to access the secret realm last time.</p><p>This cycle lasted several hundred years.  Missing the opportunity drastically increased the difficulty of finding the secret realm.</p><p>This is why countless cultivators who came to the Chi Nan Island chain after the last disappearance of the ruins found nothing.</p><p>Su Zinan's current attempt to open the secret realm meant facing even stronger turbulent currents.</p><p>They were far from the core of the ruins, still in the outermost periphery, and were already struggling to cope.</p><p>In all likelihood, they wouldn't even be able to traverse these turbulent currents and would be forced to return.</p><p>One can only imagine how dangerous the interior of the ruins is.</p><p>No wonder, after discovering the Wuwang Hall ruins, his foster father, after careful consideration, did not force his way into the core.</p><p>Su Zinan sighed inwardly, a dark look flashing in his eyes.  He glanced at Mo Xingdao from the corner of his eye, but maintained a normal appearance, feigning ease, and began to chat with the Crying Spirit Cave Master, “I had planned to visit several Daoist friends in Nan Zhou after this matter was concluded, but unexpectedly I met the Cave Master here.  There's something I would like to ask you.”</p><p>The Cave Master, quite surprised, said, "Su, what troubles you? Speak freely, I will tell you all I know."</p><p>Su Zinan, observing the turbulent currents, replied, "I'm seeking information about someone.  Their cultivation is comparable to mine. They're a master swordsman and exceptionally skilled in fire manipulation, wielding two unusual types of spiritual flames."</p><p>"A Grand Cultivator! Fire manipulation!"  The Cave Master's eyes narrowed. "What kind of flames?" he pressed.</p><p>Su Zinan sighed, "I haven't directly fought this person, so I don't know much. One flame is black, almost demonic; the other is extremely violent. Both are incredibly powerful, unlike anything I've ever seen…"</p><p>After hearing Su Zinan's description, the urgency in the Cave Master's eyes faded. He mused, "Many cultivators are skilled in fire manipulation, but there are always clues. I can't think of anyone who could cultivate such flames on their own. Since this person is a Grand Cultivator, even if they're far away in the Western Desert or overseas, they couldn't be unknown! I wonder what their background is, and why they've offended you?"</p><p>"This person killed one of my elders. We have an irreconcilable feud!"</p><p>Su Zinan's voice was cold, his killing intent palpable.</p><p>"I've investigated extensively in the Northern Wastelands and Central Plains for years, but to no avail. This person seems to have appeared out of thin air.  We both know such power can't be achieved overnight. There must be traces. I'm confident I'll find them eventually."</p><p>The Cave Master paused, his eyes widening in shock. "The elder you mentioned… could it be Old Wu?"</p><p>In Luye, only a handful of people could be considered elders by Su Zinan.  Unless under extraordinary circumstances, it’s unlikely Old Lu would be killed by a mere Yuan Ying cultivator.</p><p>Su Zinan questioned, "Does the Cave Master know Old Wu?"</p><p>"I've only heard of his great name, sadly I've never met him."</p><p>The Cave Master's eyes flickered. After a moment's thought, he asked, "I hear Old Wu followed Master Lu since the Golden Core stage and was highly regarded. Why didn't Master Lu personally avenge Old Wu?  No matter how powerful that person is, they couldn't escape."</p><p>"My foster father is currently unable to act."</p><p>Su Zinan fell silent for a moment, deliberately vague.</p><p>The Cave Master understood and didn't press further, returning to the previous topic. "In my opinion, a Grand Cultivator appearing out of nowhere is illogical, unless this person is deliberately concealing their origins. But their fire manipulation is so powerful, even Old Wu wasn't a match. If this isn't even their ultimate ability, it's terrifying! Have you considered that they might be from another realm?"</p><p>"Another realm?"</p><p>Su Zinan was taken aback, lost in thought.</p><p>The Cave Master referred not to places like the Western Desert, Northern Wastelands, or Eastern Sea, but to other realms beyond the Central Plains, protected by barriers within the storm belt.</p><p>This world, the Central Plains is not the only one!</p><p>The Cave Master nodded. "Beyond the Central Plains lie other cultivation realms, isolated by the storm belt. But over countless years, legends persist.  It's said that Transcendent Ascension cultivators can manipulate celestial mechanisms, refining the chaotic spiritual energy within the storm belt with less restriction, allowing travel almost anywhere.  The storm belt would hardly pose a threat to Master Lu. I've only heard of a Western Land; my knowledge is limited, and I wouldn't presume to show off before you, Su."</p><p>The Cave Master looked expectantly at Su Zinan, hoping for confirmation.</p><p>After a long pause, Su Zinan said, "Thank you for your insight! My foster father mentioned once that the Western Land is real, that there are other realms surrounding the Central Plains, and not just the Western Land."</p><p>Their conversation wasn't private.</p><p>The Cave Master wasn't surprised.</p><p>Others, especially Mo Xingdao, cultivators not from established sects, were both shocked and delighted, thrilled by this revelation.</p><p>While they'd heard rumors, to hear confirmation from a Transcendent Ascension successor was a first!</p><p>"Can we go to the Western Land?"</p><p>"Has Master Lu been to the Western Land?"</p><p>"Where is the Western Land?"</p><p>…Questions poured forth.</p><p>Su Zinan didn't hide anything.  "Have you been west of the Western Desert? Beyond the barrier there isn't an ocean, but a torn land, with endless, flowing magma. In ancient times, the complete landmass was unimaginably vast. The Western Land is on the other side of this land. Whether through legends or my foster father's own experience, the Central Plains is a cultivation paradise, unlike any other. You shouldn't abandon the essential for the trivial. My foster father didn't say much, only that the Western Land is far smaller and poorer than the Central Plains, and it's a Buddhist realm."</p><p>Pausing, Su Zinan continued, "Getting to the Western Land is perilous, with magma everywhere, and it's easy to get lost. Unless there's another way, only Transcendent Ascension cultivators can cross.  It's certain that the Ganlu Monastery and Master Huiguang know about the Western Land."</p><p>"Whether the Western and Central Buddhist sects are connected is unknown," someone said.</p><p>The group took a while to process this information. Someone continued, "Ganlu Monastery's enduring success... isn't it due to monopolizing resources from both regions?  Were any high-ranking monks from the West brought in?"</p><p>The weeping spirit master interjected, "Everyone, think back. Those monks who suddenly rose to fame, some might have come from the West."</p><p>"Besides the West, how many places has Elder Lu visited? How vast is this world?"</p><p>This was the first time Mo Xingdao, who had remained silent until now, spoke.</p><p>Su Zinan glanced at him. "My foster father only went to the West and returned disappointed. There are rumors of similar places north of the Central Plains, even farther than the West. Don't think that Nascent Soul cultivators are omnipotent. After entering the turbulent flows, even my foster father had to be cautious, and wouldn't travel far lightly…"</p><p>"There's another reason," the weeping spirit master sighed, his words implying more. "Nascent Soul isn't the end of the path.  The Heavenly Tribulation hangs like a sword, those who don't advance will die. Even Nascent Soul cultivators dare not relax, they must constantly cultivate in seclusion."</p><p>Everyone looked at him; this person seemed to know a lot.</p><p>Then—</p><p>A loud roar echoed from above, interrupting their conversation.</p><p>Gray turbulent currents coalesced into massive gray clouds, descending from the sky, leaving only narrow gaps between them.</p><p>"Careful!"</p><p>Su Zinan shouted, raising his hands, palms facing each other. Veins bulged on his arms, and his meridians turned visibly black, twisting beneath his skin—an ominous sight.</p><p>Eventually, all five of Su Zinan's fingers turned black, a black orb appearing in his palms.  An astonishing force circulated within, its roar even overpowering the sound of the turbulent flows.</p><p>The orb faced the gap between the two gray clouds.</p><p>Before the force was unleashed, the edges of the gray clouds vibrated, impacted by its might.</p><p>Su Zinan seized the moment, his arms jolting. The black light transformed into a black demonic dragon, its horns sharp, roaring as it lunged into the gap in the clouds.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The force exploded, creating a vortex between the gray clouds.  Touching the edges of the clouds, streaks of gray were torn and devoured, the gap widening.</p><p>"Quickly!"</p><p>Su Zinan surged upwards.</p><p>Others used their treasures and abilities to help, successfully passing through the gray clouds.</p><p>Once they were safe, the weeping spirit master exclaimed, "What a magnificent Zhu Long Demon Force, truly deserving of its reputation!"</p><p>Su Zinan withdrew his power, looking at the weeping spirit master. "This isn't the place for a detailed discussion. After leaving the Wuwang Palace, I will visit you."</p><p>"Agreed!"</p><p>The weeping spirit master readily nodded. "I also have matters to discuss and would like to invite Daoist Su as a guest."</p><p>A strange look flickered in Su Zinan's eyes, and he gave a slight nod.</p><p>…</p><p>Behind them,</p><p>Qin Sang found it increasingly difficult to follow.</p><p>He couldn’t openly follow, while also having to withstand the turbulent flows—a strenuous task.  </p><p>By now, Qin Sang was considering giving up.</p><p>Su Zinan was surrounded by many experts, who also knew the area better and had the advantage of time, place, and people.</p><p>Furthermore, as they ascended, the intensity of the turbulent currents increased rapidly.  Qin Sang judged that unless Su Zinan had another solution, they wouldn’t get far.</p><p>After a moment of thought, Qin Sang decided to wait and see.</p><p>Less than an incense stick's worth of time later,</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly heard a deafening roar like thunder, coming from high above.</p><p>Sensing something unusual, Qin Sang was startled, quickly ordering his Sky-Eyed Butterfly to search for the source. He saw a massive gray tide appear in the depths of the void.</p><p>It was a gray expanse.</p><p>All the turbulent flows along the way were defeated, swallowed by it.</p><p>The tide came from the sky, engulfing everything!</p><p>"Rumble…"</p><p>The heavens and earth trembled.</p><p>The cultivators who had entered the secret realm now felt as if the place was about to collapse.</p><p>Under the tide, Su Zinan and the others seemed minuscule. After a brief glance upward, they made an immediate decision.</p><p>Escape!</p>
