<h1>Chapter 1099: Subduing the Corpse King</h1><p>The Corpse King suddenly clutched its head with both hands, letting out a piercing, agonized scream. Bai, who had stopped in front of it, looked on with wild excitement in his eyes.</p><p>"It's working!" Bai exclaimed.</p><p>Qin Sang was equally thrilled. Through the use of the Heavenly Corpse Talisman, Bai had actually managed to affect the Corpse King. Qin Sang continued to wield his Ebony Sword, slashing at the back of the Corpse King's neck.</p><p>The Corpse King let out a fierce roar. Whether Bai's actions had dredged up unbearable memories or inflicted extreme pain, the Corpse King now regarded Bai as its mortal enemy. Even as sword energy surged toward it, the Corpse King's hate-filled gaze remained fixed on Bai.</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>The sword wheel struck the Corpse King, tearing through the corpse energy surrounding its body but failing to harm its true form. The Corpse King didn't even turn its head, completely ignoring the sneak attack from behind.</p><p>Seeing this, Bai didn't dare to slack off. He continuously activated the Heavenly Corpse Talisman within the Corpse King's body while merging his own form with ghostly energy, retreating rapidly.</p><p>Qin Sang, noticing that the Corpse King was ignoring him, smirked coldly. With a flick of his sleeve, a demon banner flew in front of him. Now wasn't the time for a decisive strike, so Qin Sang temporarily summoned nine demon banners while secretly preparing three more. </p><p>The Nine Nether Demon Fire surged forth, transforming into fiery spears. With a sizzling sound, the ghostly energy floating in the air was incinerated by the demon fire, instantly turning to ash.</p><p>"Go!" Qin Sang's mind stirred slightly as he raised his hand.</p><p>The fiery spears shot straight toward the Corpse King's back.</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>As expected, the spears were shattered by the Corpse King, but what followed was an overwhelming wave of Nine Nether Demon Fire. Before the Corpse King could react, it was completely enveloped in flames.</p><p>In an instant, the Corpse King was wrapped in raging fire, the aura of the Nine Nether Demon Fire unmistakable. Feeling the pain and sensing the danger, the Corpse King finally stopped underestimating its tormentor. Its corpse energy surged, forcefully dispersing the demon fire.</p><p>After the brief clash, the Corpse King's black fur was completely burned away, leaving it looking rather disheveled, though it bore no significant injuries.</p><p>Bai seized the opportunity to quicken his movements. At the Corpse King's brow, the faint shadow of a talisman flickered, causing it even greater agony.</p><p>The Corpse King roared in fury, continuing its relentless pursuit, creating another scene of peril. Fortunately, Bai, merged with ghostly energy, was fast enough to evade. With Qin Sang occasionally stepping in to assist, they managed to hold their ground.</p><p>As time passed, the Corpse King's corpse energy grew thinner, the bloodlust in its eyes dimmed, and its speed slowed slightly, giving the two of them more breathing room.</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't expected the process to go so smoothly. At its peak, this Corpse King was equivalent to an early-stage Nascent Soul cultivator. Now, weakened by the Heavenly Corpse Talisman, it posed little immediate threat to them. However, capturing or killing it would still require considerable effort. Ordinary methods would hardly scratch it.</p><p>Before long, Qin Sang heard Bai's urgent voice, "This is about the limit. The beast is still struggling. If we take too long, the Heavenly Corpse Talisman's effect might weaken. I'll keep it occupied. You find an opening to strike!"</p><p>Qin Sang nodded in agreement, secretly retrieving the three additional demon banners and consuming a Soul-Cleansing Elixir and a pill to replenish his true essence. He glanced ahead. The battlefield had shifted to the center of the pit, where the Corpse King's lair was located. With the balance of power shifting, Bai now had the ability to hold his own against the Corpse King.</p><p>The Corpse King, enraged, used every means at its disposal but still couldn't overcome Bai, who was protected by his tortoise shell. However, Bai also found it difficult to harm the Corpse King. Even when he channeled ghostly energy to form blades and swords, they could only inflict superficial wounds on the Corpse King's flesh after breaking through its corpse energy.</p><p>Qin Sang scanned the area, quietly moving to the edge of the pit to avoid the Corpse King's line of sight. After setting up his hidden formation, he activated the twelve demon banners. The banners fluttered noisily in the wind.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang's expression relaxed slightly, and he let out a quiet sigh of relief. Although he was seventy to eighty percent confident, he had been worried about losing control of the banners and ruining their plan. Fortunately, with his previous experience, his control over the banner formation and the fire lotus had improved, and the consumption of demon fire wasn't as overwhelming as before. The Soul-Cleansing Elixir and pills would be enough to sustain him.</p><p>As he set up the formation, Qin Sang sent a message to Bai.</p><p>*Bang! Bang! Bang!*</p><p>The pit echoed with deafening roars as the battle between Bai and the Corpse King grew more intense. On the surface, Bai's attacks seemed even more ferocious than the Corpse King's. He drew in endless streams of ghostly energy, creating massive waves that lashed out at the Corpse King.</p><p>The Corpse King's body was battered, its skin gleaming with a metallic sheen as it relied solely on its physical strength to resist the onslaught, its ferocity undiminished.</p><p>Bai pretended to be overwhelmed, steadily retreating and luring the Corpse King toward Qin Sang's hidden position.</p><p>In the next moment, the twelve-demon banner formation was complete!</p><p>As soon as the formation was activated, Qin Sang's eyes snapped open, and he shouted through their mental link, "Now!"</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>The demon banners resonated. Streams of demon fire shot out from the banners, converging into a blazing inferno at the center of the formation. With a flick of Qin Sang's finger, the fire surged toward the Corpse King before it could fully coalesce.</p><p>After unleashing this attack, Qin Sang's true essence and spiritual sense were nearly depleted. If the Corpse King targeted him now, he would be defenseless.</p><p>A flash of white light streaked across the battlefield.</p><p>The White Crane arrived just in time, carrying Qin Sang away from the fray.</p><p>The Corpse King wasn't entirely without intelligence. Having suffered from the Nine Nether Demon Fire before, it recognized the flames and sensed an even more terrifying power this time. Its blood-red eyes flickered, and it actually attempted to retreat.</p><p>Bai, however, was prepared. He immediately reversed his retreat and lunged at the Corpse King.</p><p>"Gather!" Bai roared.</p><p>The surrounding ghostly energy surged toward the Corpse King like chains, forming a prison around it.</p><p>The two of them worked in perfect harmony, leaving the Corpse King no room to escape. Even if they could only trap it for a moment, that would be enough.</p><p>The Nine Nether Demon Fire followed close behind!</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The Nine Nether Demon Fire erupted!</p><p>Flames scattered in all directions, plunging the battlefield into chaos as black demon fire filled the air. The Corpse King, at the center of the explosion, was completely obscured from view.</p><p>Then, a deafening, agonized roar erupted from within the flames. The demon fire trembledâ€”the Corpse King wasn't dead yet.</p><p>Bai wasn't surprised. He kept his eyes fixed on the center of the inferno. Qin Sang was now out of the fight. If this attack hadn't severely wounded the Corpse King, continuing the battle would be pointless.</p><p>Finally, the Corpse King burst out of the flames.</p><p>Seeing the Corpse King's current state, Bai couldn't hide his delight. The Corpse King's body was riddled with wounds, its skin cracked, its chest blown open by the demon fire, revealing broken bones. Its face was torn, and one of its eyes was missing. While its appearance was even more terrifying, its aura was clearly weakening.</p><p>Bai threw his head back and laughed maniacally, then twisted his body, shifting from defense to offense!</p><p>Meanwhile, Qin Sang hid in the distance, too exhausted to fight. Since Bai hadn't called for his assistance, it was clear the situation was under control. Qin Sang decided to conserve his Three Light Jade Elixir and sat cross-legged, using pills and spirit stones to recover.</p><p>After a brief period of rest, Qin Sang summoned the Heavenly Eye Butterfly to guard him and sent the White Crane to assist Bai, hoping to end the battle quickly.</p><p>In the pit, the battle raged on. The Corpse King's roars continued, but they now carried a hollow, desperate tone.</p><p>After some time, the Corpse King's cries finally ceased.</p><p>Qin Sang stopped his recovery, opened his eyes, and stood up just in time to see Bai rushing toward him, carrying the Corpse King's mangled body.</p>
