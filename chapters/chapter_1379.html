<h1>Chapter 1371: A Chase Across Thousands of Miles</h1><p>Chapter 1371: A Chase Across Thousands of Miles</p><p>A small fox lay on the back of a one-legged bird.</p><p>The bird’s bloody aura couldn't taint the fox.</p><p>The fox’s fur was pure white, delicate and adorable, truly beautiful.</p><p>Its aura, however, was far from as cute and weak as its appearance suggested; it was clearly a powerful transformed demon!</p><p>However, one of the fox's hind legs was bloody and limp, and within the torn flesh, black tendrils writhed and twisted like malignant tumors, impossible to remove.</p><p>A small beast, fox-like but only the size of a mouse, clung tightly to the one-legged bird’s feathers with its forepaws, its round eyes fixed on the green light, full of anger.</p><p>Another black streak of magical energy appeared behind them.</p><p>It looked even stranger and uglier than the one-legged bird.</p><p>Its upper body was a fish head and body, covered in black scales, while its lower body had two frog legs.  Its flight was a jerky, comical hop.</p><p>The frog-fish was fast, but slower than the green light and the one-legged bird, quickly falling behind.</p><p>It opened its mouth, revealing rows of fangs, screamed, and leaped into the sea.</p><p>‘Splash!’</p><p>Water sprayed everywhere.</p><p>The frog-fish was in its element.</p><p>A black shadow appeared beneath the surface, its speed surging as it rose and fell, rapidly pursuing.</p><p>The three streaks of magical energy vanished into the distance.</p><p>A faint crimson hue drifted in from the north.</p><p>The red intensified, blood staining the water; countless people had died there. Gradually, fragments of a large ship appeared.</p><p>Most striking was a lifelike golden dragon's head.</p><p>It must have been a dragon ship, now shattered beyond repair!</p><p>Qin Sang, the one fleeing in the green light, felt the terrifying demonic energy behind him.</p><p>He glanced back at his relentless pursuer and inwardly groaned.</p><p>He had already crossed the storm belt and reached the Three Regions of the North Sea.</p><p>The journey had been relatively smooth, without major incidents.</p><p>The Moon Rhinoceros's sensing ability hadn't weakened.</p><p>However, the storm belt was wider than he anticipated, and the energy expenditure far exceeded his expectations, even taxing his current cultivation.</p><p>As he hadn't found a safe place to rest along the way, he had only managed to summon his Yuan Ying spirit puppet to defend him during brief lulls in the storm, seizing every moment to recover.</p><p>Even with ample preparations, Qin Sang’s true essence was almost completely depleted by the time he emerged from the storm belt.</p><p>Emerging from the storm, Qin Sang breathed a sigh of relief, muttering to himself about how close he came.  He had barely broken through to mid-Yuan Ying stage before coming, it was too much.</p><p>In this new land, Qin Sang wanted to find a place to recover, but like the other side, after searching carefully for a long time, he found no safe haven.</p><p>During his search, Qin Sang encountered a dragon ship.</p><p>The dragon ship was enormous.</p><p>Even in the Canglang Sea, such a large vessel was extremely rare.</p><p>Even more surprising was that the ship was heavily warded, protected by spirit formations, and there were actually Golden Core cultivators aboard.</p><p>Qin Sang concealed his true cultivation, disguising himself as a loose cultivator. Upon inquiry, he learned that this sea area was very chaotic, frequently beset by powerful demons, and quite dangerous; even Golden Core cultivators traveled in groups.</p><p>The language these people used was similar to that of the Northern Star Region, something Qin Sang was used to.</p><p>Knowing that it was unwise to stay, Qin Sang didn't want to linger and paid spirit stones to rent a private room on the ship, planning to cultivate and recover his strength.</p><p>But as Qin Sang entered meditation, the dragon ship was suddenly attacked!</p><p>There was no prior warning.</p><p>The ship’s protective spirit formations were useless, instantly breached, and the ship was broken in two!</p><p>The people on board then discovered in terror three figures appearing out of thin air, their demonic aura unrestrained – three transformed demon kings!</p><p>Qin Sang's Yuan Ying spirit puppet, tasked with protecting him, immediately counterattacked. By the time Qin Sang was startled awake, his cover was blown.</p><p>Trying to again disguise himself as a demon king was now impossible. Even if the Yuan Ying spirit puppet hadn't acted, it would likely have been difficult to deceive them.</p><p>His previous successes in deceiving demon kings were due to other factors; the opponents had preconceived notions that prevented suspicion.</p><p>But Qin Sang, a newcomer unfamiliar with the Three Regions of the North Sea and the local demons, was easily exposed.</p><p>Moreover, demon kings might not show mercy to an unfamiliar, lone member of their own kind.</p><p>Qin Sang's weakened state was impossible to hide, transparent to their eyes.</p><p>The three demon kings seemed to be passing through, casually destroying the human dragon ship when they spotted it.  Upon catching such a big fish, their eyes lit up. Ignoring the lower-level cultivators, they all focused on Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang's true energy was only at 30% recovery, making direct confrontation impossible.  Facing a single demon king, Qin Sang, aided by his Nascent Soul puppet, could hold his own and even potentially kill the opponent. However, he was now facing three, especially a one-legged avian demon whose power surpassed even the serpent king's.  The frog-fish demon also possessed peak early transformation stage cultivation, and its abilities were exceptionally strange. Qin Sang estimated that unless he could deploy his sword array or magic banner unexpectedly at close range, killing it would be difficult.</p><p>Upon waking to this situation, Qin Sang immediately and decisively cast the "Summoning Thunder Technique."  The thunders struck, and the Nascent Soul puppet seized the opportunity to attack, managing to injure the small fox demon.  However, the puppet was immediately forced back.  Fortunately, Qin Sang hadn't intended to kill them, only to buy time.</p><p>The three demon kings seemed very familiar with each other and coordinated exceptionally well.  The moment the "Summoning Thunder Technique" was cast, the one-legged avian demon transformed, its crimson energy surging.  Instead of attacking Qin Sang, it turned towards its companion, spewing a beam of blood energy towards the thunder.  It underestimated the technique's power; the blood energy collided with the thunder and was dispersed.  The technique's aftershock heavily impacted the weakest, the small fox demon.</p><p>The frog-fish demon, similarly prioritizing its companion's safety, unleashed a blob of green light. This viscous, green mass instantly filled the void. The Nascent Soul puppet, unprepared, was ensnared, its movements severely hampered. If Qin Sang hadn't promptly ordered its retreat, freeing it from the green light, it would have been surrounded.</p><p>"So, it's not everywhere like the Northern Star Realm, where humans and demons coexist peacefully," Qin Sang wryly thought. "Even in the Northern Star Realm, there's friction and suspicion between different races."</p><p>He sighed, "I wonder how rampant the demons are in the North Sea Three Realms. To encounter so many demon kings at once! I never heard this area was demon territory…"</p><p>He regretted his haste in focusing on recovery after boarding the ship, neglecting to thoroughly inquire about the North Sea Three Realms' situation from his fellow cultivators.  However, they were at most Golden Core cultivators, unlikely to have much insight.  Fortunately, he'd purchased a sea chart from the ship's captain, knowing that the land ahead was human territory—a place where even three demon kings wouldn't dare pursue him.</p>
