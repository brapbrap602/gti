<h1>Chapter 550: The Summons</h1><p>Chapter 550: The Summons</p><p>Qin Sang followed them into the dark clouds, seeing that Qiu Mu Bai's Skull Guard were mostly disciples from Shangyuan Qingjing Palace and Shaohua Mountain. After exchanging greetings, Qin Sang readily obeyed orders and acted with them.</p><p>These dark clouds were a special forbidden artifact that stabilized spiritual energy.  Fighting within the cloud cover, everyone was shielded from the chaotic spiritual energy.</p><p>However, it was said that this artifact had limited power and was only effective during periods of low spiritual tide.</p><p>Experienced Foundation Establishment cultivators at Skull Pass cleared out large numbers of cloud beasts.</p><p>The Skull Guard's role was mainly to fill gaps, relay messages; the danger was relatively low, though accidents did happen, such as the unfortunate death of Yu Yangzi.</p><p>It was evident that Qiu Mu Bai was very curious about Qin Sang, and the two chatted amicably.  Qin Sang was also adept at slaying cloud beasts. With his participation, they quickly completed the mission and returned to Skull Pass.</p><p>"Junior Brother Qin, please go to Junpan Mountain to register your merits first. We'll talk again later."</p><p>After a moment's thought, Qiu Mu Bai said in a deep voice, "Junior Brother Qin, given your temperament, you shouldn't fear external gossip. If any fellow disciples act inappropriately, just tell this senior brother, and I will discipline them."</p><p>Qin Sang was startled.  He bowed, "Thank you, Senior Brother Qiu."</p><p>Bidding farewell to Qiu Mu Bai, Qin Sang went to Junpan Mountain to report his accomplishments and then rented a cave dwelling in the city. The price was exorbitant, causing Qin Sang some pain.  There were free dwellings in the military camp, but he needed a private space to treat Flying Night Fork, which made the camp inconvenient.</p><p>Then he went to find Yun Youzi.</p><p>On the way, Qin Sang recalled his conversation with Qiu Mu Bai. When asked about Dongyang Bo, Qiu Mu Bai was very cautious in his words, leaving Qin Sang with little information; the image of Dongyang Bo in his mind remained blurry.</p><p>"Let's talk another day…"</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head and activated the restriction of Yun Youzi's cave dwelling.</p><p>…</p><p>"After the Ziwei Palace opens, the three sect masters will arrive at Skull Pass. They will lead us to the inner layers of the Ancient Immortal Battlefield to rendezvous with others. Anyone holding a Ziwei Secret Tome will be protected."</p><p>Yun Youzi had already gathered information and made the necessary preparations.</p><p>"Won't we be too conspicuous?"</p><p>Most people possessing a Ziwei Secret Tome were Foundation Establishment cultivators. Their presence as two fake-Core Formation cultivators might attract unwanted attention from Dongyang Bo, which could be detrimental.</p><p>Yun Youzi shook his head. "Even if we go to other passes, we will have to rendezvous eventually, and we'll be discovered anyway. It's better to stay with our own sect master, who will genuinely protect us. The Ziwei Palace is in the deepest part of the Ancient Immortal Battlefield; the journey will not be safe."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded. The Ziwei Palace was unavoidable; other concerns were secondary.</p><p>The two discussed their plans and then went their separate ways to prepare.</p><p>Afterwards, Qin Sang patiently waited at Skull Pass. He didn't just idle about as a hanger-on. When he had free time, he joined Qiu Mu Bai's team and went out hunting cloud beasts.</p><p>…</p><p>'Pfft!'</p><p>A pitch-black hand appeared out of thin air, leaving a deep claw mark on the cave's wall before the figure of Flying Night Fork materialized.</p><p>Qin Sang sat cross-legged on a cushion, thoughtfully observing the claw mark left by Flying Night Fork.</p><p>Nearly half a year had passed, and the treatment had been effective.  Flying Night Fork's strength had been restored to the level of a fake-Core Formation cultivator. The recovery rate would increase, ensuring a full recovery before the opening of the Ziwei Palace.</p><p>"Good thing I refined many Shao Yin Magnetic Bottles.  The consumption is truly enormous,"</p><p>Qin Sang muttered, putting Flying Night Fork back into the Corpse Puppet Bag. He took out a jade pendant, opened the cave dwelling, and strolled towards an auction.</p><p>With countless experts gathered at Skull Pass, Qin Sang naturally wouldn't miss this opportunity. He had participated in several auctions, hoping to find Wan Shi Chang, Tian Du Yan, and Yin Hun Cao.</p><p>Unfortunately, the first two herbs had never appeared, and even if Yin Hun Cao did, it was always sent to the demon cultivator territories.</p><p>Qin Sang had been unsuccessful during this time.</p><p>This time was no exception.  After the auction, Qin Sang walked out of the auction house with a disappointed expression.  He noticed his Skull Guard token flashing and immediately flew towards Junpan Mountain.</p><p>"Junior Brother Qin."</p><p>Qiu Mu Bai had already assembled his men.  "This might be our last chance to leave Skull Pass before the end of the spiritual tide. I'm sure you wouldn't want to miss it, so I took the liberty of calling you."</p><p>Qin Sang was surprised.  "They're closing the pass?"</p><p>"Almost," Qiu Mu Bai nodded. "The spiritual tide is about to reach its peak.  It's said that this might be the last period of decline; going out after this will be a death sentence. We'll probably have to seal the pass and hold out until the spiritual tide subsides."</p><p>Luckily, we arrived in time!</p><p>Qin Sang breathed a sigh of relief, then asked, "Is the Purple Micro Palace about to appear?  With the border closed, have the Elders already arrived?"</p><p>"I don't know,"</p><p>Qiu Mu Bai shook his head and ordered immediate action.</p><p>Opening the city gates, as they left, Qin Sang looked back.</p><p>On both sides of Xuanlu Pass, and high in the air, a boundless, seemingly thin barrier firmly blocked the spiritual tide, protecting countless beings behind it.</p><p>High above, the spiritual tide, which could easily crush them to dust, surged wave after wave, continuously impacting the barrier, yet it was so pale and powerless.</p><p>Compared to the original barrier, the protective spiritual array at Xuanlu Pass, amassed over countless years and countless Yuan Ying experts' efforts, seemed extremely dim.</p><p>Who created this barrier?</p><p>When was it erected?</p><p>Qiu Mu Bai noticed Qin Sang's gaze and sighed, "In the distant past, a powerful immortal could easily block the spiritual tide and protect the people with a wave of their hand. Such prowess is truly inspiring…  In our lifetime, who among us could possibly reach such a level!"</p><p>Qin Sang hesitated for a moment, then slowly nodded.</p><p>The waning period of this spiritual tide was unusually short.  Shortly after Qin Sang and the others went out, they noticed something amiss, hurriedly returned, and finally made it back to Xuanlu Pass before the waning period ended.</p><p>Unexpectedly, as soon as they entered the pass, they heard someone calling their three names. Looking in that direction, it was Zhan Yi, a direct disciple of Che Yu Tao.</p><p>"Junior Brother Zhan, what's so urgent?"</p><p>Seeing Zhan Yi's anxious expression, they approached and asked.</p><p>Zhan Yi, already a False Core cultivator and a direct disciple of Che Yu Tao, showed no arrogance; he bowed to them before saying, "Senior Brothers, Master just sent word for all Foundation Establishment late-stage cultivators in Xuanlu Pass to gather. I couldn't find you three and only then learned that you had left the pass."</p><p>"What important matter does Master Che require?"</p><p>The three exchanged glances and quickly asked.</p><p>Zhan Yi urged, "We're just waiting for you few senior brothers. You'll know once you arrive."</p><p>Qin Sang and the others didn't dare delay, immediately selected two Foundation Establishment late-stage fellow disciples from their team, and hurried off with Zhan Yi.</p><p>They rushed along, and upon entering Che Yu Tao's residence, Qin Sang quickly scanned the room.</p><p>At a glance, she saw…</p><p>Che Yu Tao sat in the main hall, but on the side seat.</p><p>On the main seat, sat a woman wearing a cloak.</p>
