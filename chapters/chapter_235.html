<h1>Chapter 228: Attempt to Break the Prohibition</h1><p>Qin Sang looked at Cloud Wanderer, saw him with several fellow disciples of the Greater Unity Dan Sect, looked at each other, nodded to each other, did not talk much, stared at Che Yutao, not knowing what these Core Formation masters would assign them to do.</p><p>After seeing the previous scene, everyone's face became exceptionally heavy, their hearts very uneasy, the smile on Mu Yifeng's face had long since disappeared, secretly knowing that this time may not be a good thing to do.</p><p>Uniting together, the four Core Formation masters were unable to deal with the black hole, to the point that when the black light counterattacked they even had to retreat and dodge, before entering the Ancient Cultivator's Remains there was such a powerful prohibition, how could the inside not be even more dangerous?</p><p>Before, someone joked, saying that they were the cannon fodder for those that came after, could it be a self-fulfilling prophecy?</p><p>Unfortunately, they did not know the complete contents of the clues, knew very little about the Ancient Cultivator's Remains.</p><p>Qin Sang's mind was racing, thinking of himself, he has those magic tools and the three baleful corpses, amongst these people, his strength could not be considered the weakest.</p><p>To weigh the pros and cons, things worth his life may not exist in the Ancient Cultivator's Remains, after going in, he did not ask to find many treasures, first priority was keeping his life, so that it should not be difficult.</p><p>"Senior Apprentice Brother Mu..."</p><p>Qin Sang quietly messaged Mu Yifeng, "Besides Daoist Master Che and Daoist Master Xuanyu, this junior has never seen these seniors, I don't know if senior apprentice brother can introduce them to this junior, to avoid being失礼in the future, offending these seniors."</p><p>Although Qin Sang knew which Nascent Soul stage cultivators were in Xuanguan Pass, he was unable to match the people to the names, to the other three he had never met, could only guess at their identities, afraid there would be errors.</p><p>The thing he asked was not a secret matter, not afraid of these Core Formation stage cultivators noticing.</p><p>Mu Yifeng stood beside Qin Sang, quietly messaged him back: "That palace clothed woman who controls the phoenix hairpin, is Senior Fellow Disciple Sigong Muyue of the Greater Unity Dan Sect. That middle-aged literati is Senior Fellow Disciple Dui Yi, he is the Sect Master of the Green Silk Sect. The one with the crutch Senior Fellow Disciple Di Que was originally a rogue cultivator, later became the guest elder of Xuanguan Pass, having the best relations with the several sects like the Green Silk Sect and Medicine Sovereign Sect."</p><p>Listening to Mu Yifeng's explanation, Qin Sang looked at them one by one, remembering them inside, confirming that there were no Core Formation masters from the Medicine Sovereign Sect, nodded secretly.</p><p>Yin Xingge was very likely instructed by a Core Formation master, entering the mine to find the yang essence crystal, and his fire jade centipede came from Yin Xingge, if a Core Formation master of the Medicine Sovereign Sect were present, even if there was no mark on the fire jade centipede, Qin Sang would not release the fire jade centipede, now he did not have to worry about that.</p><p>Taking advantage of the fire jade centipede to find the path, maybe he could obtain an advantage in this group of people.</p><p>The things the fire jade centipede can sense were all fire attributed spirit objects, not as useful as spirit wood but could be used to exchange, rather than blindly searching for spirit wood, the correct thing was to first take what he could get.</p><p>Deciding on a plan, Qin Sang calmed down, carefully listened to Che Yutao's orders.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Sigong will immediately transmit to each of you a combination array formula, called the Nine Luminaries Milky Way Formation, you will have one hour to comprehend it, then relying on this array formula, enter the Ancient Immortal's Remains..."</p><p>Finishing, Che Yutao nodded to Sigong Muyue, Sigong Muyue flicked her finger, twenty or so flows of light flew out from her jade like fingers, separately flew towards Qin Sang and the others.</p><p>Qin Sang saw the flow of light come straight at his brow, endured and did not resist, when the flow of light entered his brow, a thing instantly appeared in his mind, it was the deployment method for the Nine Luminaries Milky Way Formation.</p><p>Nine Luminaries Milky Way Formation, required nine people to take positions of the nine luminaries, then through the array, combine the strength of the nine people together, releasing a power far exceeding the individual strength of the nine.</p><p>The array formation was very complex, with extremely harsh requirements of the nine people in the array, Qin Sang did not dare to be neglectful, immediately calmed his mind and began to comprehend, luckily he had looked at Senior Sister Qingting's array understanding, had a certain knowledge of the way of array formations, comprehending was not difficult.</p><p>In less than an hour, Qin Sang opened his eyes, his eyes seeming to twinkle with starlight, withdrawing his mind from comprehending the array formation, looking at the other people.</p><p>Some people had already comprehended the array formation, expression calm, there were some with their brows locked together, struggling to think through.</p><p>After an hour, everyone had comprehended the array formation, without needing Che Yutao to give orders, the nine people made a group, stood according to the positions required by the array formation.</p><p>Che Yutao nodded with satisfaction, "Now try to operate the array formation, then the three groups crowd together, forming a three layered array!"</p><p>The crowd was surprised, actually having to layer the array formations, did that not mean having to combine the strength of twenty-seven people together才能破除the prohibition?</p><p>Under Che Yutao's urgings, they did not dare to hesitate, hurriedly crowded together, during their gathering they already urged their spiritual power, flying out from each person's body, assembling in the air above their heads.</p><p>As soon as the array formation was formed, the spiritual power above stirred up a storm, then they began to fuse with each other, after this spiritual power stabilized, they actually formed a dazzling river of stars.</p><p>Like a section of the Milky Way was taken down from the sky, descending to the mortal world.</p><p>The river of stars was absolutely beautiful, those who set up the array formation were drawn by the power of the array formation, slowly floating into the river of stars, brilliant lights surged around them, turning into the nine brightest stars in the river of stars.</p><p>The nine members of Star River brought the power of the stars together. The spiritual power was hidden within the stars, where it faintly started to surge dramatically.</p><p>However, the members of the group did not forget the order from Che Yu Tao. After the three separate Star Rivers were created, they connected together to form an even deeper and vaster starry sky!</p><p>“Well done!”</p><p>Seeing how the formation was so powerful, Che Yu Tao showed his approval. Raising his voice, he stated, "From now on, proceed slowly towards the restriction of the Ancient Cultivator's Abode. Everyone must calm their minds, activate the power of the Star River with all their strength, and protect themselves. No matter what happens, you are not allowed to resist even in the slightest. Rest assured that if any of you end up in danger, we will rescue you."</p><p>Everyone focused on activating the Nine Shining Star River Formation and had no strength left for a response, but they followed the order immediately and moved slowly towards the center of the gravel area.</p><p>Qin Sang placed himself within the Star River and let the power from it carry him. With Che Yu Tao around, he would not be able to do anything else by his own will anyway. He could only move with the river.</p><p>As the Star River entered the gravel area, spiritual energy was drawn to it, which made the black hole in the middle appear out of nowhere.</p><p>Within the Star River, everyone remembered the order and protected themselves with all their strength. The Star River did not make any move to attack. That is why the surge inside the black hole, despite becoming increasingly violent, did not unleash the kind of destructive black light seen before.</p><p>In the meantime, Che Yu Tao and the others exchanged looks and began to move. The five of them formed a circle around the black hole, watching the Star River approach it nervously.</p><p>Right before the Star River touched the black hole, the tension reached a critical point. Spiritual power started surging out of the five Core Formation cultivators as they got ready to rescue the others at any moment.</p><p>At the moment the Star River touched the black hole, it appeared to shrink slightly under the pressure and compressed force, but it did not break. Part of the Star River had already smoothly entered the black hole.</p><p>Seeing this, Che Yu Tao and the others were overjoyed, and excitement appeared on their faces.</p><p>“Indeed, the restriction encountered by Foundation Establishment cultivators is not the same as what we face!”</p><p>Che Yu Tao shouted, “Listen up! Reverse the formation and exit the black hole!”</p>
