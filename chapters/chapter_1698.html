<h1>Chapter 1689: The Collapse of the Imperial Mountain</h1><p>Crimson fire illuminated the heavens. The cultivators outside Mount Chi witnessed a scene that shook them to their core. From the nearly closed chasm within the golden clouds and mist, a crimson light erupted. The golden clouds instantly transformed into burning scarlet, and a terrifying power surged forth with the red light, rapidly parting the layers of clouds and mist to both sides.</p><p>The three illusory bodies of the Azure Fox Holy King stood in a triangular formation, one in front and two behind. Their imposing aura remained as powerful as ever, yet now, bathed in the crimson light from within and without, they seemed to be on the verge of melting.</p><p>Before them was a ball of fire.</p><p>The fire itself shouldn't have been large, but its brilliance was blinding, its aura savagely intense, stinging the eyes of all who looked upon it. Cultivators who knew ocular secret arts quickly circulated their cultivation methods, attempting to discern the true nature of the fire.</p><p>But all they saw was a raging inferno.</p><p>Even from a great distance, the ominous signs from the mountain revealed the brutal energy within the fireball.  The scene reminded them of the rising sun, shaking their very souls.</p><p>Behind the fireball, the Sun God Tree gently swayed. No one could have imagined that such terrifying power originated from this small tree.</p><p>Qin Sang's true body and avatar were bathed in the firelight, their entire bodies crimson, as if ignited by the Southern Bright Emberfire, burning intensely.</p><p>The avatar flashed, catching the true body.</p><p>The true body was bathed in blood, its expression contorted in agony, its entire body trembling.</p><p>The intense pain originated from within. Having suffered two successive waves of impact, his flesh, meridians, and blood vessels had been ravaged by a violent torrent, leaving no part unscathed. This time, he truly injured himself before harming his enemy.</p><p>Qin Sang suspected that if he hadn't cultivated the Demonic Clan's secret arts and achieved some proficiency in body refinement, he would have already exploded without the Azure Fox Holy King needing to lift a finger.</p><p>His eyes bloodshot, Qin Sang's gaze passed over the Sun God Tree, peering into the depths of the Southern Bright Emberfire, unsure how much damage it would inflict upon the Azure Fox Holy King.</p><p>He knew full well that trying to slay a Holy King so easily was nothing but a delusion.</p><p>However, as long as he could wound the Azure Fox Holy King, rendering her unable to sow further chaos, it would suffice.</p><p>As for whether this would cause the collapse of the Suspended Lake, affecting the battle above and unleashing the Ancient Devil, Qin Sang didn't consider it. If anyone was to blame, it should be the instigator. He couldn't simply surrender and be slaughtered.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>The flames swept past, shaking the sword formation.</p><p>The scene from moments ago replayed itself. The Seven Lunar Mansions Sword Formation was torn open by a larger fissure, almost splitting the entire expanse of golden clouds and mist.</p><p>Raging flames surged forward.</p><p>The robes of the three illusory bodies fluttered, their imposing aura suppressed by the flames.</p><p>The Azure Fox Holy King sensed the overwhelmingly violent power. Her eyes deepened, a flicker of astonishment crossing her face.  Previously, the Southern Bright Emberfire had initially erupted within the sword formation, and only a portion of it had escaped. She hadn’t fully grasped its intensity then. Now, facing the Southern Bright Emberfire directly, she realized that this fire was far stronger than she anticipated.</p><p>She hadn't expected Qin Sang to be capable of unleashing such flames with his true essence nearly depleted, nor had she anticipated his ability to use her charm technique against her, setting a trap.</p><p>'Crack!'</p><p>The illusory fox claws were the first to touch the Southern Bright Emberfire.</p><p>Under the impact of the spiritual fire, the azure light exploded. Cracks appeared in the fox claws, and they shattered with a resounding crack. The fragments scattered like falling petals, instantly swept away by the flames, meeting the same fate as Su Zinan’s Giant Demonic Soul.</p><p>In an instant, the Southern Bright Emberfire was upon them.</p><p>At this critical juncture, the Azure Fox Holy King didn't attempt to retreat or dodge.  Her posture didn't even change.  Her body remained rigid, while the light within her eyes receded like the tide.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>The flames swept over the illusory bodies.</p><p>Not just one, but all three illusory bodies were engulfed.  At this moment, the Azure Fox Holy King could only focus on preserving herself, unable to protect her illusory bodies.</p><p>Before everyone's eyes, the three illusory bodies offered almost no resistance, instantly consumed by the sea of fire. Only at the last moment did the shadow of a fox tail flicker before vanishing.</p><p>Utterly destroyed, leaving nothing behind!</p><p>An uproar erupted within the Legacy Realm.</p><p>Some gaped, speechless in shock.</p><p>They were unaware of the Azure Fox Holy King’s illusory bodies, but the imposing aura of the three figures was undeniable. Everyone believed that their demise was certain. Unexpectedly, not only did the three fail to capture their enemy, but they were incinerated by the flames, without even a chance to escape.</p><p>“What kind of spiritual fire is that?”</p><p>“Is it a spiritual treasure or a divine ability?”</p><p>“Just who is that fierce individual who wiped out the three illusory bodies of the Demonic Clan’s Holy King in one fell swoop?”</p><p>“No wonder they dared to kill the Holy King’s disciple!”</p><p>“Damn it! These old geezers are only good at scheming against each other. If they could unite and use such powerful methods, how could they allow these devils to run rampant?”</p><p>…</p><p>Exclamations and discussions echoed throughout the Legacy Realm.</p><p>Their gazes couldn't leave Mount Dis bestowment, watching as the raging flames burst out of the golden clouds and mist, their momentum unchecked, surging towards the outside of the mountain, piercing the sky with unstoppable force, finally exploding in mid-air.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The explosion shook the four directions.</p><p>The exploding fireball could be seen from every corner of the Legacy Realm. The crimson flames split into thousands of streams, each exploding like fireworks, dyeing the heavens red, creating a strangely beautiful scene.</p><p>No one was truly captivated by the beauty, only chilled to the bone. After the explosion, there was no trace of the Holy King's illusory bodies, not even ashes remained.</p><p>As if echoing the explosion, a greater rumble came from Mount Dis bestowment. The slowly tilting mountain peak suddenly accelerated its descent.</p><p>'Rumble…'</p><p>The entire Legacy Realm trembled.</p><p>The Imperial Mountain collapsed, the earth shattering!</p><p>It appeared as if it had been destroyed by the Southern Bright Emberfire.</p><p>In truth, the rapid collapse of Mount Dis bestowment was indeed inseparable from the Southern Bright Emberfire.  The Five Elements Divine Prohibition, already strained, was twice shaken to its core by the sword formation’s disruption, its structure thrown into chaos, becoming the weakest point for a breakthrough, indirectly accelerating the destruction of the Five Elements Divine Prohibition.</p><p>The collapsing mountain peak crashed into the Five Elements Divine Prohibition, causing clouds and mist to surge, filling the sky.</p><p>Within the clouds, various strange lights flickered chaotically. This was the mountain’s formations making their final resistance, though it was clear that most of them couldn’t withstand the Five Elements Divine Prohibition.</p><p>Countless secret vaults, countless treasures collected by the Formless Immortal Sect, countless cultivation methods and secret manuals left by past generations would be buried here.</p><p>The cultivators who witnessed this scene felt a pang of heartache.</p><p>By now, the more astute among them could sense what was coming.  Connecting the dots to the most terrifying consequence, their expressions changed drastically as they looked towards the Suspended Lake.</p><p>The lake water was black as ink.</p><p>The moonlight and the streams of light unleashed by the cultivators' formation converged into a single force, striking heavily against the demonic body.</p><p>The Azure Fox Holy King’s eyes glazed over for an instant, quickly regaining their usual luster. Such a subtle change would be difficult for the average person to notice.</p><p>According to her plan, this joint attack on the demonic body, even if it couldn’t injure it, would trigger its defensive instincts, preventing it from causing trouble at this time.  She could then seize this opportunity to descend with her illusory bodies, capture Qin Sang, and immediately return to calmly control the situation.</p><p>As long as everything went smoothly, there shouldn’t be any problems.</p><p>Yet, unexpectedly, an accident occurred.</p><p>As the Azure Fox Holy King returned to her true body, she suddenly trembled. Having witnessed the power of the demonic fire, even with victory seemingly assured, she remained vigilant, sensing danger, and chose to return without hesitation.</p><p>However, although she reacted swiftly, escaping the calamity, her three illusory bodies were completely obliterated.</p><p>The illusory bodies were formed from her fox tails, so their destruction wouldn’t harm her essence.  However, the fragments of her consciousness within the illusory bodies hadn't dissipated in time, and were also incinerated by the flames.</p><p>Especially the illusory body she had descended with, its fragment of consciousness had just merged with her true body and wasn't easily separable.</p><p>A flush crept across the Azure Fox Holy King's cheeks, and she let out a soft moan of pain.</p><p>Even so, her voice held an indescribable allure, and her slightly furrowed brows appeared pitiful, unintentionally displaying a myriad of charms.</p><p>The Azure Fox Holy King’s unusual state directly affected the battle.</p><p>With her moan, the bright moon in the sky seemed to be veiled, its light dimming. Simultaneously, waves surged on the Suspended Lake, its surface shaking not from the demonic body's attacks, but from the lake’s own turbulence.</p><p>The Suspended Lake and the bright moon were the foundations for trapping the demonic body. Old Demon Fan and the others relied on these forces to contend with it.</p><p>In an instant, everyone sensed the anomaly.</p><p>The demonic body felt the pressure upon it lessen, and its battle instincts allowed it to seize the opportunity. It let out an earth-shattering demonic roar, endless demonic qi surging from its body, transforming into demonic claws.</p><p>This time, the number of claws was fewer, but they were more terrifying.</p><p>At the same time, the Five Elements Crown atop the demonic body radiated a fierce aura. Five-colored light intertwined with the demonic claws, becoming indistinguishable, their malevolent aura terrifying as they reached towards the cultivators.</p><p>By now, the Demon Spirit's consciousness had been completely consumed by madness, acting purely on instinct.  With Poison King's grey cocoon acting like a turtle shell, the demonic body no longer focused on him, allowing Poison King to gradually escape from the center of the vortex.</p><p>Old Demon Fan and the others were more enticing targets.</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>The demonic claws tore through the air, their five fingers like hooks.</p><p>Old Demon Fan's scalp tingled. Seeing the Suspended Lake and the bright moon failing to restrain the demonic body in time, he knew that something must have happened to the Azure Fox Holy King.  He inwardly cursed her profusely.</p><p>A Nether Lotus manifested beneath him, ready to act.</p><p>The others were also in dire straits, preparing to use their trump cards to save themselves.  Their priority was to escape, unable to maintain the Meditative Arhat Formation.</p><p>With this, their joint attack crumbled, and the subsequent situation became unpredictable.</p><p>At this moment, a brilliant light radiated from the halo behind Sage Huiguang.  Immense light bathed the entire Suspended Lake.  Within the halo, the illusory figure pressed its palms together, a faint chanting resonating in everyone's ears.</p><p>In the next instant, the illusory figure stepped out of the halo and pointed a finger at the demonic body. Golden light shot forth.</p><p>The golden light ultimately condensed into a golden ring, encircling the demonic body.</p><p>Having unleashed the golden light, the illusory figure vanished. Before disappearing, it turned its head to glare furiously at the Azure Fox Holy King, like a wrathful deity.</p><p>“Azure Fox!”</p><p>The thunderous shout, deep and resonant, carried anger and warning.</p><p>'Crack, crack, crack…'</p><p>The demonic body’s flesh bulged, the golden ring trembling violently, clearly unable to hold for long.  Fortunately, Old Demon Fan and the others had sensed the illusory figure's actions and reacted accordingly.</p><p>Knowing she was at fault, the Azure Fox Holy King remained silent.  She intertwined her jade-like hands, performing a technique to forcibly suppress her injuries and stabilize herself. Then, she closed her eyes slightly, murmuring an incantation.</p><p>The lake calmed, and the moonlight returned.</p><p>The golden ring shattered at that precise moment. Before the demonic body could retaliate, the surrounding pressure surged once more.</p><p>With their combined efforts, they finally managed to salvage the precarious situation.</p><p>Sage Huiguang's contribution was paramount. Fortunately, he knew that once the Heartfire Blood Refinement began, it would be difficult to divide his attention. He had prepared a contingency plan just in case, otherwise, the consequences would have been dire.</p><p>Looking at Sage Huiguang’s true body, his current state wasn't relaxed. He too was affected.  As the illusory figure acted, the Demon Sealing Stakes creaked, the surrounding blood light intensifying. Sage Huiguang's arms trembled, veins bulging.</p><p>"Roar!"</p><p>The demonic body roared, launching another attack.</p><p>Now that the Suspended Lake and the bright moon were stabilized, and the Azure Fox Holy King had just suffered a setback, she no longer glanced downwards, focusing entirely on the demonic body, gradually regaining control of the situation.</p><p>However, the Azure Fox Holy King hadn't abandoned her pursuit of Qin Sang.</p><p>Outside the mountain, Bai Xiao led the demonic cultivators, advancing and pausing intermittently. Seeing the situation stabilize, and believing the danger had passed, they increased their speed to assist the Holy King, only to encounter an unexpected turn of events.</p><p>He witnessed the destruction of the Holy King's illusory bodies, unsure of her true body's condition.  As he hesitated, the Azure Fox Holy King's icy voice rang out: "He is at the end of his rope.  Do not let him escape.  Otherwise, you will answer to me!"</p><p>Bai Xiao's heart leaped.</p><p>The Holy King's tone was vastly different from her previous commands, filled with severity.</p><p>While he dared to delay before, he didn’t dare hesitate now. He didn't doubt that if he returned without Qin Sang, the Holy King would first flay him alive and then dismantle his lair.</p><p>"Quickly! Seize that brat! Whoever dares to delay, I'll flay them alive!"</p><p>Bai Xiao fiercely kicked the bird demon in front of him, transforming into a white streak of light, his speed exploding.</p><p>Seeing this, the other demons revealed their true forms, a chaotic frenzy of demonic energy.</p><p>…</p><p>As the Southern Bright Emberfire surged out of the mountain, more people were stunned by its might, unable to recover.  Suddenly, someone pointed towards Mount Dis bestowment and shouted.</p><p>"There!"</p><p>Behind the flames, within the fissure in the golden clouds and mist, an escaping light followed the fire.</p><p>"It's him!"</p><p>The one who had destroyed the Holy King’s three illusory bodies, he was still alive and had escaped.</p><p>Where was he going?</p><p>The question arose in everyone's minds.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the escaping light paused briefly, not fleeing towards the entrance of the Legacy Realm, but instead heading straight for a region east of Mount Dis bestowment, an area filled with strange, sword-like peaks.</p><p>The peaks there resembled swords, their arrangement forming a cohesive whole, their qi tightly knit, clearly protected by a powerful formation.</p><p>"That's the Gold Aspect Hall..."</p><p>Someone recognized the location.</p><p>It wasn't that Qin Sang didn't want to escape directly or hide within Mount Dis bestowment to recover.</p><p>It was that during his escape, demonic qi surged towards him.  The Azure Fox Holy King had followers, a considerable number of Demon Kings among them. Within the demonic qi, there were presences that threatened him, beings he couldn't handle in his current state.  Moreover, with the Five Elements Divine Prohibition on the verge of collapse, he feared he would be buried within it before his enemies could even catch up.</p><p>Surveying the entire Legacy Realm, the Gold Aspect Hall seemed to be his best option.</p><p>Among the golden swords he possessed was the Gold Aspect Hall's inherited sword formation. Part of this sword formation was integrated into the Gold Aspect Hall’s protective formation.  By escaping into the Gold Aspect Hall, even if he couldn't use the sword formation to slay his enemies, he could at least use it to hold them off.</p><p>Qin Sang flew directly towards the Gold Aspect Hall, unhindered along the way.</p><p>In reality, hardly anyone dared to approach Mount Dis bestowment now. Even those who did had to consider whether they could withstand the Southern Bright Emberfire.  No one knew Qin Sang's current condition.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>The escaping light was like lightning.</p><p>Qin Sang reached the edge of the Gold Aspect Hall, seeing below the forest of sword peaks, each seemingly radiating sword intent, connected to the protective formation, the arrangement sharp and natural.</p><p>The demons were closing in.</p><p>Using his Heavenly Eye divine ability, Qin Sang quickly located several familiar formations. Without hesitation, he chose one and plummeted downwards, his figure emitting a faint azure light, vanishing among the peaks in the blink of an eye.</p>
