<h1>Chapter 1205: Bone Curse</h1><p>Chapter 1205: Bone Curse</p><p>The twelve magic banners and the ebony sword protected Qin Sang, but he wasn't directly attacked; the tremors simply intensified.  He steadied himself, cautiously observing his surroundings. The sealing power here was identical to what he'd encountered outside.  This was the core of the seal; the outer realm was merely a part of it, somehow protruding from the Abyssal Ruins.  The Sky Corpse Sect was using the altar to communicate with the trapped individual, exploiting the link between the altar and the seal.</p><p>The tremors originated from above. However, drawing on past experience, Qin Sang analyzed the underwater restrictions and discovered that the sealing power converged in the opposite direction – below the water.</p><p>After some thought, Qin Sang used his spirit sword to clear a path and decided to investigate below.  Towering, blade-like peaks rose from the water. These peaks were barren, devoid of any life. Atop each peak was a dark, bottomless cave.  The seal seemed to suppress these mountains, or perhaps the unknown beings within them. These caves resembled individual cages, their entrances open.</p><p>Qin Sang remained vigilant, using his Heavenly Eye to silently observe his surroundings.  Nothing could escape the Heavenly Eye's scrutiny.  </p><p>Satisfied that there were no anomalies, Qin Sang reached the edge of a peak, deploying the twelve magic banners as a retreat route. If anything strange lurked within the caves, this would give him a better chance.</p><p>The peaks and caves all appeared similar.  Qin Sang randomly chose one at the edge and cautiously entered.</p><p>Upon entering, Qin Sang immediately felt a suppressing force. Although the seal was broken, residual power still attempted to subdue the prisoner.  His protective aura fluctuated. He realized the seal wasn't simply suppressing; the sealing power manifested as needle-like threads of lightning, a form of punishment, still retaining some of its power.  If the seal were intact, it was unimaginable how anyone could endure such torment for countless years.</p><p>Qin Sang protected himself with sword energy, resisting the punishment, and slowly descended into the mountain's belly. This was the end.  The mountain's interior was a square, regular space.  Arcing bolts of lightning snaked through the chamber.  The sealing punishment targeted living beings; sensing Qin Sang, they lunged at him, but he easily deflected them.</p><p>This was the strongest point of the seal and punishment, yet the place was empty, devoid of any unusual traces. He explored several caves, all with the same results.</p><p>Qin Sang then went to the tallest peak in the center, the location with the strongest sealing power. He immediately noticed something unusual. Unlike the others, this mountain's interior wasn't empty. From above, he spotted a deep white light.  Upon seeing its source, his expression changed slightly, and he abruptly stopped.</p><p>Unlike the other caves, there was a stone platform, though it was empty.  Before the platform was a bone array!</p><p>Qin Sang recognized immediately that the array was constructed from human bones.  The array had been there for countless years, devoid of any blood. The stark white light emanated from the bones themselves, creating an especially eerie atmosphere.  Humeri, tibiae, clavicles, patellae, phalanges, ribs… every bone in a human body was present, including a complete spine, curved in the center of the array like a yin-yang symbol, all refined and transformed.</p><p>It was from a single person! The creator had meticulously stripped the flesh from a complete corpse to construct the array.  However, Qin Sang noticed the absence of a skull.</p><p>The array was somewhat disorganized, but Qin Sang could still discern its purpose: to resist the sealing punishment.</p><p>“Was the skull damaged, or…” Qin Sang paused.</p><p>He may have been mistaken. Perhaps the creator hadn't dismembered someone else, but themselves!  In such a place, there would be no second person to provide the bones for the array.</p><p>Unless there were two people trapped initially, or it was a corpse refinement technique.  Strange occurrences were numerous in the cultivation world.  A trapped individual, near death, refining their body into a bone array while sheltering their soul within the skull to cling to life, was entirely plausible.</p><p>Qin Sang now understood why the mysterious person had desperately sought help.  The bone array likely couldn't hold, and she was on the verge of death, making a final, desperate gamble.  The broken seal and missing skull indicated her escape.</p><p>The thought sent a chill down Qin Sang's spine.  Even he might not have the resolve to perform such a bone array ritual on himself.</p><p>Qin Sang carefully examined the surroundings, searching for any clues.  Otherwise, the trail might go cold.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Tan Hao had rescued the mysterious woman, but then vanished without a trace. This was Qin Sang's biggest puzzle.</p><p>This mountain, like the others, had smooth ground and walls, devoid of patterns or inscriptions.</p><p>Finally, Qin Sang's gaze fell upon the bone formation.</p><p>"Hmm…"</p><p>Qin Sang noticed something unusual and quickly moved to the formation.  Each bone bore intricate, curving markings—an unfamiliar type of rune.</p><p>These runes were directly carved into the bones, appearing to be a unique kind of bone spell.</p><p>"Bone spells…corpse refinement…could there be a connection?" Qin Sang mused.</p><p>The Way of Bones and the Corpse Path differed, yet both manipulated corpses.  He suspected the Heavenly Corpse Sect's legacy originated from this mysterious woman, through the altar.</p><p>The Heavenly Corpse Sect once possessed a Corpse King-level refined corpse, yet failed to rescue the woman. Perhaps they were wary of her, only wanting the benefits without releasing her. Or maybe the seal was too strong, even for a Corpse King to break…</p><p>Qin Sang's thoughts raced. He collected the bones one by one.  Since he couldn't find Tan Hao or the woman, these bone spells were a valuable find.  He might glean something from them later.</p><p>As he picked up a vertebra, Qin Sang's eyes widened, fixated on a section of runes.</p><p>"This rune…"</p><p>A thought struck him. The Heavenly Corpse Rune flashed in his mind.  This bone rune strongly resembled a rune on the Heavenly Corpse Rune.</p><p>"There is a connection!" Qin Sang rejoiced.</p><p>The latter half of the Heavenly Corpse Sect's legacy might not be purely Corpse Path techniques, but a fusion with the Way of Bones.  That explained his lack of progress.</p><p>Unfortunately, he still couldn't decipher the Heavenly Corpse Rune.</p><p>Qin Sang collected the bones, memorizing the runes. He hoped studying them would help him unlock the Heavenly Corpse Rune.  He could also show them to Bai for his insights.</p><p>Bai had possessed the Corpse Soul Orb for decades, remaining in seclusion, unable to refine it and advance to Corpse King.  It seemed the problem wasn't a lack of strength, but a flawed approach.</p>
