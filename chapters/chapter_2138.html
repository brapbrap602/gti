<h1>Chapter 2128:  Message Arrives</h1><p>On the edge of the Foul Lands.</p><p>Compared to its peak, the foul miasma has receded thousands of miles. Several elders of the Changyou tribe, leading the tribe's experts, are stationed here by order, watching the vast expanse of sea that has been revealed, and dare not act rashly.</p><p>The miasma's changes can incite the ferocity of the beasts. Although beasts rarely surge out from the Foul Lands, precautions must be taken.</p><p>Among the crowd, a blue-haired man stares constantly towards the north.</p><p>"Tenth Elder, you needn't worry. Those outsiders are preoccupied with their own affairs; they wouldn't dare to send troops to contend for the Qingling Qi," a cultivator in blue armor says smugly beside him.</p><p>"It's better to be cautious. Most of our tribe's experts are engaged on the battlefield…"</p><p>The blue-haired man is the Tenth Elder of the Changyou tribe. He turns his gaze to the depths of the Foul Lands. "In a few more days, the foul miasma will retreat to its designated position, yet the Chieftain has still not issued any orders. Some time ago, the young chieftain sent a message that the Chieftain was seriously injured and had returned to the Sacred Lake for treatment.  We don't know the extent of the injury."</p><p>"If the Chieftain were to arrive personally, everything would certainly be safe," says the cultivator in blue armor.</p><p>"Indeed!"</p><p>The Tenth Elder nods slightly.</p><p>A Void Realm Second Stage expert, even if injured, is not someone a Void Realm First Stage cultivator could challenge.</p><p>Just as they are speaking, the Tenth Elder's expression suddenly changes. He takes out a jade talisman, senses it for a moment, and says in a deep voice, "The Chieftain's order: after the Qingling Qi appears, we are to immediately act to collect it, without any hesitation!"</p><p>To the north of the Changyou tribe's hiding place, a group of people from the Xuantian Palace, sent by Tong Lingyu, are also concealed. However, their numbers and strength are inferior to the Changyou tribe. The Xuantian Palace is large and has many constructed altars; it was already quite difficult to spare these people.</p><p>Without even seeing their opponents, they understand their disadvantage. Fortunately, their Palace Master doesn't have high expectations for them; they just need to do their best.</p><p>Unnoticed by all, a hidden presence lurks behind them.</p><p>Qin Sang's Dharma Image is hidden in the clouds. The auras of the Changyou tribe cultivators are crystal clear to his senses. He doesn't act; he is waiting, to see if Min Zhuo, the chieftain, will appear.</p><p>The injuries he inflicted on Min Zhuo should be severe, unless Min Zhuo possesses healing elixirs.</p><p>Qin Sang waits patiently.  The Changyou cultivators show no unusual signs, and there is no trace of Min Zhuo.</p><p>As the foul miasma is about to reach its position, Min Zhuo is still nowhere to be seen. If Min Zhuo has not come, it means his deduction about the Qingling Qi may be wrong.</p><p>At this moment, near a distant islet, ripples appear on the surface of the sea from time to time. Occasionally, a fish surfaces, its eyes bright, glances towards the location of the Xuantian Palace cultivators, then sinks beneath the surface, like an ordinary fish swimming around the islet.</p><p>The fish is secretly controlled by Min Zhuo. His real body is hidden further away, a large lotus leaf, as big as a fan, shading him, concealing his figure and aura.</p><p>From multiple encounters, Min Zhuo knows that Qin Sang possesses a mysterious method of detection, so he has taken two precautions.</p><p>Unbeknownst to him, Qin Sang hasn't brought the Sky-Eyed Butterfly.  The next battle might be crucial, and the butterfly needs to remain to assist his main body.</p><p>Min Zhuo and Qin Sang are both searching for each other, yet neither can detect the other's presence.  Therefore, neither dares to act rashly.</p><p>Three days later.</p><p>The foul miasma recedes a significant distance.</p><p>At this time, Min Zhuo receives a message.</p><p>After reading the contents, Min Zhuo lets out a long sigh of relief, a triumphant smile spreading across his face. "They're finally making a move! Thankfully, I haven't missed the opportunity!"</p><p>The message states that after a period of rest, the Reed King has issued an order to launch another attack. Moreover, all divisions are mobilized this time; the scale is larger than any previous attack!</p><p>Min Zhuo has been waiting for this day.  The lack of news before this had made him rather anxious.  He took a great risk, positioning himself at the heart of the situation – both to create an opportunity for himself to escape, and to use himself as bait to further push the battle forward.</p><p>The facts prove him correct. With the Reed King's fierce attack, the Storm Realm experts can be completely contained on the battlefield.</p><p>However, he still doesn't reveal himself.  He puts away the message, looks towards the depths of the Foul Lands, calculates with his fingers, and mutters, "The Qingling Qi should be about to appear."</p><p>Two more days pass.  The foul miasma continues to recede, the deep sea becoming increasingly profound, as if an abyss lies beneath, unseen.</p><p>Confirming the absence of beast auras, the Tenth Elder leads the tribe's experts, slowly approaching the edge of the foul miasma.</p><p>The Xuantian Palace cultivators also cautiously move towards it.</p><p>On the following evening, Qin Sang, who has been silently searching for Min Zhuo, his gaze sharpens; he abruptly turns his head towards the Evil River.</p><p>Grey-white mist churns in the sky. Between two streams of mist, a streak of blue-green light suddenly appears.</p><p>A faint, fleeting azure glow appeared within the murky air.  Like a tiny, shimmering fish with scales of pure light, it darted and weaved, impossibly agile.</p><p>"A wisp of Azure Spirit has appeared!"</p><p>The Changyou cultivators stirred, greed flashing in their eyes.</p><p>"Min Ying, Old Seven…"</p><p>The Tenth Elder, vigilant, scanned his surroundings, quickly naming several people.  "Retrieve this Azure Spirit."</p><p>"Yes!"</p><p>Several immediately pushed forward, diving into the murky air like hungry wolves.</p><p>The Azure Spirit was elusive, behaving like a living creature, constantly shifting direction.  This was a mystical essence; ordinary containment methods were useless. Its speed was incredible, defying spiritual sense detection; losing it was a real possibility.</p><p>However, years of experience had yielded effective methods for its capture.</p><p>The cultivators quickly surrounded the Azure Spirit. One produced a jade vial, aiming its mouth at the spirit. Others formed a formation, preparing a restrictive spell.</p><p>A faint white glow emanated from the vial's opening, drawing the Azure Spirit in with a powerful suction.</p><p>The Azure Spirit struggled violently, but it couldn't escape the pull, gradually being drawn towards, then into, the vial.</p><p>'Snap!'</p><p>The cultivator instantly sealed the vial, still cautious, swiftly forming hand seals.</p><p>Shortly after, the violently shaking vial calmed. A bluish glow emanated from it, like the purest jade.  A wisp of azure essence, thin as a hair, could be seen swirling within.</p><p>They searched the area but found no other Azure Spirits. They weren't worried; their appearance was erratic – sometimes one would appear after a long interval, sometimes dozens would burst forth at once, causing chaos.</p><p>The Tenth Elder and his group arrived.</p><p>"An Azure Spirit so quickly! This will be a bountiful harvest," the cultivator holding the vial exclaimed excitedly.</p><p>"Those outsiders clearly dare not compete. This is far more than we've ever obtained," someone sneered.</p><p>The cultivator holding the vial's expression turned serious. "Have you found their tracks?"</p><p>The Tenth Elder nodded. "Only a few outsider experts are watching from afar.  Ignore them, let's proceed!"</p><p>They immediately delved deeper into the murky air.</p><p>Outside, the Xuantian Palace cultivators, unable to confront the enemy directly, could only watch helplessly as the first Azure Spirit was captured. After a while, they cautiously approached.</p><p>Qin Sang, from afar, observed everything.</p><p>His gaze pierced through the Changyou cultivators, focusing on the Azure Spirit's source.</p><p>From the moment the first wisp appeared, he sensed a strange fluctuation; the murky air noticeably vibrated.</p><p>The tremor originated from the place he had once attempted to enter, only to retreat in fear.</p><p>Logically, the Evil River was receding, its murky air should have thinned. However, that specific location remained unchanged, as dark and dense as ever, like a persistent shadow.</p><p>Simultaneously, Qin Sang perceived that as the murky air receded, the power that had once filled him with unease and dread was gradually weakening.</p><p>This weakening was natural, without any backlash. Once it reached a certain point, the threat to intruders would significantly diminish, essentially opening the area to outsiders.</p><p>Of course, this only applied to Nascent Soul cultivators. For those at the Divine Transformation stage, it remained extremely dangerous.  Even the Changyou experts wouldn't dare approach too closely, only waiting for the Azure Spirits to drift out, retreating at every tremor to avoid the resulting shockwave.</p><p>After some time, another tremor occurred, and another azure glow emerged.</p><p>The Tenth Elder and his group reacted swiftly, capturing this wisp as well.</p><p>As time passed, tremors became frequent, with Azure Spirits appearing intermittently, while the Xuantian Palace cultivators could only watch from afar.</p><p>Then, a tremendous tremor shook the area, unleashing several azure glows at once. Despite their speed, the Changyou group let one escape.</p><p>The Xuantian Palace cultivators, eyes bloodshot from watching helplessly, immediately snatched it.</p><p>"You're courting death!"</p><p>A Changyou cultivator roared, about to attack, but the Tenth Elder stopped him.</p><p>"Collecting Azure Spirits is paramount; we'll settle accounts with them later!" the Tenth Elder coldly commanded.</p><p>Thus, a sort of uneasy truce settled. More and more Azure Spirits emerged, the vast majority ending up in the Changyou's hands.</p><p>Outside the Evil River.</p><p>Min Zhuo silently counted the frequency of the tremors, seemingly calculating something, delaying his actions.  It wasn't excessive caution; though he used wax figures as substitutes, facing strong enemies and sustaining new injuries would accelerate the wax figures' burning. He had to be prudent, avoiding a dangerous situation.</p><p>After waiting so long without incident—gathering resources from Mount Taiyu also takes time—Min Zhuo knew it was time to move.  He quietly left his hiding place, a lotus leaf above his head, approaching the source of the green spiritual energy.</p><p>Shortly after he entered the impure air, Qin Sang felt a subtle shift, detecting something unusual.  Then, Min Zhuo reached the source of the green spiritual energy, seizing a moment during a tremor to slip inside without alarming anyone.  Qin Sang soon followed.</p><p>Gazing at the spot where Min Zhuo disappeared, the Qingluan Dharma Image's eyes shone brightly. This was a contest of patience, and clearly, he had won. However, who the ultimate victor would be remained unknown.  After a moment's thought, the Qingluan Dharma Image also submerged himself.</p><p>…</p><p>Western Lands.</p><p>Lu Wang's Royal Carriage.</p><p>After speaking with the Grand Minister, the Imperial Tutor had remained secluded in the carriage, never leaving.  On this day, Lu Wang, the Grand Minister, and numerous powerful figures all emerged from seclusion; a great battle was to commence that night.</p><p>On a mountain beside the carriage, Yuan Miao stood atop the peak, secretly worried.  Qin Sang and those from the Storm Realm had held out this long and even fought Lu Wang to a standstill, exceeding his expectations.  However, he knew that Lu Wang's forces had not yet used their full strength.</p><p>In this battle, the Grand Minister would personally descend. The outcome was uncertain.</p><p>Before the carriage, dark clouds obscured the sky, the army massed like ants, each unit prepared for battle, their momentum soaring to the heavens.  Lord Mo Shan and Shi Mu, among others, paid their respects to Lu Wang before dispersing into their formations, practicing their maneuvers.</p><p>In the clear pool, Lu Gan's expression was serious. The Xuandi Huangjuan technique had been exposed once; the upcoming battle would be a test for him as well.</p><p>Before the carriage, the Grand Minister and the Imperial Tutor stood on either side of Lu Wang.</p><p>When the army was assembled, the Grand Minister bowed.  "The time has come; I take my leave!"</p><p>"May the Grand Minister defeat the enemy and return victorious! I await good news from you," Lu Wang said solemnly.</p><p>A light emanated from the Grand Minister's brow, forming a nine-colored spirit deer upon landing.  It appeared to be a young fawn, with two small horns and large, bright eyes—seemingly adorable and hardly what one would expect as the Grand Minister's spirit beast.  The deer stretched, lay down on the grass, buried its head in its chest, and fell fast asleep.</p><p>"Please watch over my companion beast," the Grand Minister said.</p><p>"The Grand Minister can rest assured," Lu Wang said impassively, standing between the deer and the Imperial Tutor.</p><p>The Imperial Tutor said with deep meaning, "I've never heard of such a companion beast. The Grand Minister's resources are indeed profound! However, I'm surprised that even with your strength, you're so cautious. It's a pity that we won't see you unleash your full power!"</p><p>"Caution is key."</p><p>The Grand Minister replied calmly. His figure flickered, appearing before the army. He gazed deeply at the battlefield on the horizon, and commanded in a thunderous voice, "Forward!"</p><p>…</p><p>Qingyang Temple.</p><p>Qin Sang sat on the altar. As soon as Lu Wang's forces marched, warnings arrived.  Instantly, Qin Sang's eyes snapped open, radiating brilliance.</p><p>"It's time…"</p><p>Qin Sang murmured, his ten fingers moving slightly. The thunder altar beneath him rumbled, resonating within the mountain-protecting array. He raised his hands, casting a series of hand seals. The thunder intensified, and with each successive seal, the altar shone with dazzling lightning, bathing Qingyang Temple in a blinding white light.</p><p>Inside the thunder altar, a green light flashed, revealing a green 'thunder paper'—the Thunder Oath Scroll forged from Qingluan True Thunder!  The scroll slowly rotated, initially indistinct and wavering, gradually solidifying.</p><p>During this process, Qin Sang's expression didn't change noticeably. But outside the main altar, Su Nu, Zhu Que, and Si Lu, stationed at the three core sub-altars, felt an immense pressure.</p><p>Accompanying the pressure was excitement. During this period, they had witnessed the thunder altar's power, but knew Qin Sang had not yet displayed his full strength; he had been holding back. Finally, they would see the true power of the thunder altar!</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang's will reached them. Without hesitation, the three immediately entered a state of deep meditation, following Qin Sang's will, silently chanting incantations to activate the altar's power, the decrees relayed layer by layer through the array.</p>
