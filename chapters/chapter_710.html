<h1>Chapter 702: Cold Mist</h1><p>After entering the Thousand Demon Sea.</p><p>The group followed the markings on the sea chart, resting on islands along the way whenever their vital essence was depleted.  For two days, their journey was calm, without encountering any danger.</p><p>Guided by the sea chart, they remained cautious, their progress steady but not rushed.</p><p>Their journey continued without major incident, and they soon found themselves seven days into the Thousand Demon Sea.</p><p>By now, they had reached the inner regions.</p><p>Occasionally catching glimpses of powerful demons, they felt a growing sense of dread and unease. The terrifying auras of the great demons kept them on edge, and their patience began to wear thin.</p><p>The stout cultivator repeatedly reassured them.</p><p>"The chart marks a reef ahead. Let's rest there before continuing," the scholar in blue suggested, holding up the sea chart. The others readily agreed.</p><p>Within the Thousand Demon Sea, they dared not deplete their vital essence completely.  Encountering a demon beast in such a state would put them in grave danger.</p><p>As they spoke, a dark spot appeared on the horizon.  Upon closer inspection, it proved to be a small reef, barely large enough for a dozen people to meditate.  Such a find was precious in the vast expanse of the sea.</p><p>After ensuring no demon beasts lurked nearby, the group landed on the reef, taking turns keeping watch while the others sat in meditation, replenishing their vital essence with spirit stones.</p><p>Soon, everyone's vital essence was fully restored.  Just as they were about to depart, the stout cultivator pointed in another direction. "Let's go there!"</p><p>Everyone's faces lit up. "Have we reached the grotto?"</p><p>The stout cultivator nodded. "Your efforts have not been in vain, fellow Daoists. The grotto is located on an island not far from here. We should arrive within two hours."</p><p>"Then what are we waiting for? Let's go!" the gaunt old man exclaimed excitedly, leaping into the air.</p><p>The others quickly followed.</p><p>…</p><p>This area was unmarked on the sea chart, seemingly unoccupied by any major demon beasts.  The stout cultivator led them in a straight line.  Two hours later, a dark line appeared on the horizon.</p><p>As they approached, the line grew clearer, gradually revealing the outline of an island.</p><p>The sight of the island surprised everyone.</p><p>It was far larger than they had imagined, spanning at least several dozen miles from north to south.  Such a large island was rare in the Thousand Demon Sea; this was the only one they had encountered so far.</p><p>Lush vegetation covered the island, vibrant and full of life.</p><p>After confirming the absence of demon beast auras, they increased their speed.  Just as they neared the island, the stout cultivator suddenly cried out, "No! Look there! The Cold Mist is spreading! The barrier is about to fail!"</p><p>Even without his warning, the others, from their vantage point, had already noticed the only unusual feature on the island.</p><p>In the southern central part of the island lay a hill.</p><p>The hill was covered in green grass, but at its center, a blue mist swirled.  Even from this distance, under the midday sun, they could feel a faint chill emanating from the mist.</p><p>This must be the Cold Mist the stout cultivator had spoken of.  For some reason, it was seeping out of the grotto, resembling a sapphire embedded in the ground.</p><p>However, the area surrounding the Cold Mist was far less idyllic.</p><p>Almost the entire grassy area on the hill was now encased in ice. The blades of grass, frozen solid, stood like sharp swords, gleaming white.  Even the ancient trees surrounding the meadow had not been spared, their branches laden with frost, transformed into ice sculptures.</p><p>The chill from the Cold Mist was slowly spreading outwards.  It was easy to imagine that, given time, the entire island would become a frozen wasteland, devoid of all life.</p><p>No wonder they hadn't detected any demon beasts around the island – they had likely been driven away by the Cold Mist.</p><p>"How could it happen so fast?"</p><p>The stout cultivator appeared distraught and hurried towards the Cold Mist.</p><p>While the stout cultivator examined the barrier, Qin Sang also flew over, encasing his hand in vital essence before cautiously reaching into the mist.</p><p>Upon entering the mist, there was no immediate reaction. However, Qin Sang instantly felt a bone-chilling cold penetrate his vital essence and reach his hand.  Almost immediately, his hand began to lose feeling, threatened by frostbite.</p><p>It was then that Qin Sang realized the Cold Mist was subtly trying to invade his body.</p><p>His expression changed slightly. He quickly circulated his cultivation technique, expelling the Cold Mist. Sensing the sudden drain on his vital essence, he fell into deep thought.</p><p>This Cold Mist was strange.  In terms of sheer coldness, it was not as severe as the Blackfrost Gale.  However, the Blackfrost Gale could be blocked with vital essence, and the chill within the body could be dispelled with items of Yang energy.  This was not the case with the Cold Mist.</p><p>The Cold Mist's penetration was insidious, unaffected by external defenses. It seemed that once inside the grotto, he would need to constantly circulate his cultivation technique to resist the Cold Mist.</p><p>With this in mind, Qin Sang followed the stout cultivator.  After a few steps, they reached a circular opening, about ten feet in diameter, resembling a pool of water. This was the grotto. It was deep and sealed by a peculiar barrier, which was now slowly leaking Cold Mist.</p><p>The others were also experimenting with the mist, coming to similar conclusions as Qin Sang. Their expressions varied.</p><p>The stout cultivator reached the grotto and inspected it for a moment.  He let out a sigh of relief and gestured for everyone to step back. Then, with a look of relief, he said,</p><p>"Fortunately! Fortunately! We arrived just in time. The barrier is still intact. However, due to my previous recklessness, a crack has appeared, allowing some of the Cold Mist to escape.  For now, there's no need to worry about the barrier collapsing.</p><p>"However, if we wait any longer, the escaping Cold Mist will eventually attract the attention of nearby demon beasts, forcing us to flee.</p><p>"Fellow Daoists, we should enter without delay. Shall we?"</p><p>The scholar in blue flew to the top of an ice-covered tree, surveyed the surroundings, and said, "Fellow Daoist Fan, we've just arrived.  Wouldn't it be unwise to rush into the grotto? We don't know if there are any demon beasts lurking nearby. What if, after we enter, they surround the island? We'll be trapped."</p><p>He narrowed his eyes and looked at the stout cultivator.</p><p>Everyone immediately grasped the underlying meaning of his words.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded in agreement.  Inside the grotto, their vital essence would be greatly depleted.  It was essential to eliminate any nearby threats before entering.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Lan makes a valid point," the gaunt old man agreed.</p><p>The stout cultivator's face stiffened, but under everyone's gaze, he had no choice but to concede.  "What do you suggest we do, Fellow Daoist Lan, to ensure our safety?"</p><p>The scholar in blue smiled and said, "It's simple. We just need to conceal our auras and spend some time patrolling the area. Although some Cold Mist has escaped, its influence is limited, and not a cause for concern. In my opinion, the grotto's barrier is still strong and shouldn't be breached by the Cold Mist anytime soon. Fellow Daoist Fan is overly worried."</p>
