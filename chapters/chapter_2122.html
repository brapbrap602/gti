<h1>Chapter 2112:劫难-Free</h1><p>Could these scenes be heart demons?</p><p>Qin Sang was wary.</p><p>Immortality was his lifelong pursuit, his greatest obsession.</p><p>The Heart Demon Tribulation wasn't limited to conjuring the deepest fears and most unforgettable traumas; exploiting obsessions was also very likely.</p><p>It would wait until he let his guard down, then deliver a fatal blow, turning joy into sorrow.</p><p>The Heart Demon Tribulation followed the Lightning Tribulation, highlighting its danger. Once lost within it, escape would be nearly impossible.</p><p>“Martial Uncle!”</p><p>“Young Master Qin!”</p><p>…</p><p>Everyone flew to the island. They saw Qin Sang sitting cross-legged, his body scorched black, his appearance somewhat comical, but very much alive.</p><p>Unexpectedly, as soon as they landed beside him, Qin Sang’s figure flickered. He retreated several zhang, his face full of vigilance as he watched them like they were mortal enemies, sword light flashing in his palm.</p><p>“Master, you don’t recognize me? I’m your Little Fatty!”</p><p>With Qin Sang’s successful breakthrough, Fatty’s attitude changed dramatically. His face was full of flattery as he tried to scurry forward and fawn, only to be grabbed by Bai.</p><p>“Brother Qin, do you still think you’re in the Heart Demon Tribulation?”</p><p>Bai guessed the reason.</p><p>A moment might have passed in the real world, but for someone enduring the Heart Demon Tribulation, countless years could have passed in the illusion. Suddenly awakening, it was difficult to distinguish reality from illusion.</p><p>Bai signaled everyone to retreat, giving Qin Sang enough time.</p><p>Qin Sang looked at everyone, then down at his disheveled self. His gaze flickered, finally confirming that he wasn’t in the Heart Demon Tribulation. This was real.</p><p>He had succeeded in overcoming the tribulation!</p><p>There truly was no Heart Demon Tribulation!</p><p>There was only one explanation for this situation—the Jade Buddha!</p><p>Qin Sang was shocked by the Jade Buddha’s immense power.  He had anticipated that under the Jade Buddha’s protection, the heart demons’ power might weaken, making the tribulation slightly easier.</p><p>Incredibly, the Jade Buddha had completely erased the Heart Demon Tribulation, the most feared ordeal for any cultivator!</p><p>“Just what level of treasure is the Jade Buddha?”</p><p>Qin Sang was lost in thought.</p><p>If this were to spread, the entire cultivation world would go mad.</p><p>Even the most precious and rare heavenly materials and earthly treasures recorded in ancient texts could at most stabilize the mind and increase the chances of success in overcoming the tribulation. He had never heard of anything capable of eliminating the Heart Demon Tribulation entirely.</p><p>He had already held the Jade Buddha in high regard, but now it seemed he had still underestimated it.</p><p>“I… I’m a Nascent Soul cultivator now?”</p><p>Qin Sang murmured to himself, looking inward at his Nascent Soul. His eyes gradually regained clarity. Spiritual light washed over his body, healing his external injuries. He changed into a fresh set of Daoist robes.</p><p>“Congratulations, Brother Qin, on forming your Nascent Soul and ascending to sainthood!”</p><p>Bai cupped his hands in congratulations.</p><p>“Congratulations, Martial Uncle!”</p><p>“Congratulations, Young Master Qin!”</p><p>“Congratulations, Master!”</p><p>…</p><p>Li Yufu and the three demons bowed simultaneously, their greetings varied, their faces filled with joy and envy.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded with a smile, glancing around. Everything felt fresh and new.</p><p>The spirit lake, the island, the flying birds, and swimming fish.</p><p>Everything around him was within his grasp!</p><p>An immense sense of exhilaration surged through Qin Sang. He abruptly looked up at the sky and let out a long roar that shook the clouds.</p><p>…</p><p>An hour later.</p><p>The group flew across the Vast Azure Swamp, returning to the cave dwelling.  Qin Sang, newly ascended to the Nascent Soul realm, still needed to enter secluded cultivation to consolidate his cultivation.</p><p>“Martial Uncle, should we hold a Nascent Soul celebration and establish a sect?”</p><p>Li Yufu proactively inquired.</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head, saying indifferently, “I still have unsettled grudges! Holding a Nascent Soul ceremony now wouldn’t give that person the greatest surprise. Besides, we must continue to conceal Bright Moon Demon King's identity.  As for establishing a sect…”</p><p>After a moment of contemplation, Qin Sang continued, “The Abyss of Sin remains, and the cultivation world is in turmoil. Now isn't the best time. When you travel, if you encounter promising individuals, you can take them in and guide their cultivation, but don't publicly accept disciples yet. In the future, the sect will be called the Green Ram Temple.”</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't fixated on establishing a sect. He intended to take on a few disciples to handle trivial matters, freeing himself from such tasks.</p><p>Since Cloud Wanderer wished to re-establish the Green Ram Temple, and Qin Sang had received much kindness from three generations of its disciples, he decided to continue using this name for his future sect.</p><p>“Disciple thanks Martial Uncle on behalf of Grandmaster!”</p><p>Li Yufu’s tiger-like eyes welled up with tears. He carried the burden of his grandmaster’s wish, but he was only at the Golden Core realm.</p><p>The responsibility was immense, weighing heavily on him.</p><p>Qin Sang’s decision was akin to taking that burden upon himself.</p><p>“No need for formalities.”</p><p>Qin Sang helped Li Yufu up, encouraging him, “You are the true inheritor of your predecessor. I observe that you should be able to break through to the mid-Golden Core realm soon. With your talent, reaching the Nascent Soul realm is highly probable.  From now on, do not be distracted by external matters, focus on cultivation, and achieve Nascent Soul as soon as possible. Then I can entrust the Green Ram Temple to you with peace of mind and go out to travel.”</p><p>After speaking, Qin Sang looked at the three demons and said to Bai, “You don’t need to return with me. Go back to the Thousand Mountains Bamboo Sea now and tell Fellow Daoist Liu the good news. I will temporarily remain in secluded cultivation at the Yuan Mirage Sect. If anything major happens, send me a message.”</p><p>“Yes, Master!”</p><p>The three demons reluctantly bid farewell to Qin Sang and returned to the Thousand Mountains Bamboo Sea.</p><p>Soon after, Qin Sang and the others arrived near the Yuan Mirage Sect. Li Yufu parted ways with them and returned to his cave dwelling alone.</p><p>That cave dwelling was suitable for Golden Core cultivators, but it was somewhat shabby for a Nascent Soul ancestor.  Fortunately, Qin Sang held the Yuan Mirage Sect Elder Token and could freely enter and exit the sect, so he wasn't in a hurry to find a new cave dwelling.</p><p>It would be even better if he could see Senior Sister Qing Jun.</p><p>Li Yufu returned and shared the good news with Tan Yi’en and the others. Their excitement went without saying.</p><p>Yuan Mirage Sect.</p><p>Qin Sang concealed his cultivation, disguising himself as a Golden Core cultivator. Arriving at the mountain gate, he noticed that the Yuan Mirage Sect’s defenses were much tighter than usual.</p><p>“Who goes there!”</p><p>A group of disciples flew out from the mountain gate, challenging Qin Sang.</p><p>Sensing the fluctuations of Qin Sang’s cultivation, their expressions stiffened. When they saw the token in Qin Sang’s hand, their faces paled with panic. They hurriedly opened the formation and bowed, “Greetings, Elder Qin! This disciple has failed to recognize you, please punish us!”</p><p>“You are guarding the sect, what crime is there? Rise.”</p><p>Qin Sang was in excellent spirits and naturally wouldn’t make things difficult for these disciples.</p><p>Entering the Yuan Mirage Sect, Qin Sang paused and asked, “Is the Ancestor in the sect?”</p><p>“Reporting to Elder Qin, as far as this disciple knows, the Ancestor and the elders went to the front lines and haven’t returned.”</p><p>The leading disciple replied.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded and flew towards the Yuan Mirage Sect’s forbidden grounds.</p><p>After Qin Sang’s figure disappeared into the forbidden grounds, the other disciples crowded around.</p><p>“Is that the legendary, most mysterious Elder Qin?”</p><p>“So young! And so approachable!”</p><p>“That’s called charismatic!”</p><p>“I heard that Elder Qin appeared out of nowhere, already a late Golden Core expert, deeply trusted by the Ancestor, and permitted to cultivate in the forbidden grounds. Do you think he might be the Ancestor’s chosen successor?”</p><p>“It’s possible! With so many elders gone to this war, leaving such a highly cultivated Elder Qin behind must mean the Ancestor wants to protect him!”</p><p>…</p><p>(End of Chapter)</p>
