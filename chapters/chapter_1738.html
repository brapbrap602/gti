<h1>Chapter 1729:  Demonic Eye</h1><p>The poisonous pearl successively absorbed the poisonous smoke from the Gu King and the sacred object of Wan Du Mountain.  </p><p>The two poisons merged within the pearl, recreating the original poison of the Bloodthirsty瘴灵 (Zhanling).  This infused the pearl, transforming it beyond recognition.</p><p>After Qin Sang’s refinement, the pearl's seven-colored radiance now possessed both detoxification and poisoning abilities, its power naturally greatly increased with this transformation.</p><p>The power of its poisonous light is comparable to the abilities of a five-transformation Bloodthirsty瘴灵 (Zhanling) in its prime, enough to threaten even a Nascent Soul-level beast.</p><p>Qin Sang only used the poisonous light, not the Heaven-Severing Soul-Destroying Needle.</p><p>The Heaven-Severing Soul-Destroying Needle is a powerful poison-based technique. Cultivating it with the poisonous light would undoubtedly make it extraordinarily powerful.</p><p>Unfortunately, he hasn’t completed its cultivation; he has too many things to do, and is spread too thin.  He can only prioritize and gradually comprehend it.</p><p>However, against an opponent like the Thunder Turtle, the poisonous light might be no worse than the Heaven-Severing Soul-Destroying Needle.</p><p>With the Heaven-Severing Soul-Destroying Needle, the opponent would either die or be severely injured.  The Thunder Turtle, sensing the mortal threat, would inevitably unleash its instinctive ferocity, counterattacking or escaping – making the situation unpredictable.  The poisonous light's subtle approach is far safer.</p><p>Within the sword array.</p><p>Qin Sang's figure was ethereal and unpredictable, continuously launching incantations into the array.</p><p>Wherever the Thunder Turtle charged, the stars constantly revolved around it, as if it were the center of the universe.  This, however, was not a good thing.</p><p>The myriad sword-stars flickered, brightening and dimming. Each time their light surged, beams of starlight would descend.</p><p>In a flash, the starlight instantly merged, forming a single, mighty sword that pierced towards the Thunder Turtle!</p><p>A crackling sound filled the sword array.</p><p>The Thunder Turtle's radiance was no less brilliant than the starlight, its entire body bathed in thunder. Its thunder armor would shrink back onto its shell, then suddenly expand, threatening to turn half the sky into a sea of lightning.</p><p>Like a giant beast bearing a thunder mountain, the Thunder Turtle rose up angrily.</p><p>The impact of its thunder armor sent the sword's momentum reeling. In the earth-shattering collision, the light swords shattered into countless specks of light, dissipating into nothingness – the beast's ferocity on full display.</p><p>In this head-on collision, the Thunder Turtle was naturally affected. Even in its prime, it might have been unscathed, but its old wounds were inevitably reopened by the shock, causing blood to flow.</p><p>This slight pain was nothing to it, and it remained ferocious.  However, it didn't notice the potent poison seeping into its wounds.</p><p>Qin Sang used the Seven Mansions Sword Array to maneuver against the Thunder Turtle, slowly "delivering" the poisonous light into its body. The Thunder Turtle was of high cultivation and possessed a powerful body, so the effects of small amounts of poisonous light were minimal; he needed to proceed gradually.</p><p>The potent poison, carried by the Thunder Turtle's blood, flowed throughout its body, silently penetrating its organs. The more ferocious the Thunder Turtle's counterattack, the more violently the poison would erupt!</p><p>Unfortunately, the Thunder Turtle lacked the patience to let Qin Sang manipulate it.</p><p>Just as Qin Sang was becoming more adept at manipulating the sword array and preparing to repeat his tactic, he suddenly sensed something was wrong with the Thunder Turtle.</p><p>The Thunder Turtle raised its head high, its slender upper body stretched straight, glaring at the starry sky. A rustling sound came from its body – it had scales.</p><p>These scales now exploded, rising one by one before detaching from its body. Countless light points shot out in a dense swarm, but not at its prey. Instead, they targeted its own thunder armor.</p><p>The light points were vaguely real, resembling countless fist-sized thunder beads imbued with the Thunder Turtle's blood.  They merged with the thunder armor, causing continuous explosions.</p><p>After the explosions, the light points turned into wisps of light, completely merging into the thunder armor, causing visible changes.</p><p>The thunder armor began shrinking, the silver lightning tinged with crimson.  A demonic, terrifyingly violent power emanated from it, instantly transforming into a thunder disc.</p><p>The thunder disc spun rapidly, suddenly shooting towards the starry sky.</p><p>Where it passed, it left a striking scar across the night sky.  The disc's aftershocks created streaks of lightning, the silver flashes scattering like cracks in space, or a celestial scar splitting the starry river in two!</p><p>Even without the power to break through space, the thunder disc was an unmatched and terrifying ability – a fusion of the Thunder Turtle's blood energy and thunder techniques, something extraordinary.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression changed slightly.  He immediately stopped his incantations. A glow flickered in his dantian, revealing the phantom of the Mani Pearl, but it didn't materialize. A black flame separated from the Mani Pearl, reforming into a fire lotus before Qin Sang.</p><p>"Go!"</p><p>Qin Sang moved his mind.</p><p>A fiery lotus, incredibly swift, appeared before Lei Pan.  Bathed in lightning, the lotus seemed even more profound.  Its still-unfurling petals slowly rotated, colliding directly with Lei Pan.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>A magnificent flower bloomed in the vast starry river. Half black, half silver.  Even the starlight couldn't obscure this extraordinary bloom.  The instant it appeared, it exploded.  The silver half unleashed furious thunder, while the other side erupted in an endless torrent of black fire.</p><p>Instantly, the starry river trembled. Half the sky was inky black, shrouded in flames; the other half blazed like daylight, filled with dancing lightning serpents. The heavenly thunder and black fire seemed to possess world-ending power, swallowing the sword stars one by one. The countless sword stars dimmed, tottering, utterly defenseless.</p><p>Below, the thunder tortoise retracted its head, flung back by the force of the impact. Qin Sang, on the other side, was battered and bruised, his sword array nearly collapsing.</p><p>Swords hummed. Deep within the starry river, a long sword shadow materialized – Qin Sang's Grey Warbler Sword, also trembling, its true form forced out by the collision.</p><p>Qin Sang took a deep breath, quickly changing his sword technique, rebuilding the Seven Mansions constellation.  He then heard a piercing shriek.  The thunder tortoise, truly formidable, had quickly regained its composure and charged at Qin Sang.</p><p>Only a blinding flash of lightning was visible to the naked eye, but Qin Sang sensed the fierce, crazed eyes within, fixated on him, ready to devour.</p><p>*Clang!*</p><p>Qin Sang showed no panic.  With a flick of his finger, the Grey Warbler Sword vanished again.  Stars twinkled around him; sword stars reformed or were drawn from afar.</p><p>Though the thunder tortoise drew closer, sword stars inexplicably appeared between them.  Qin Sang didn't move, yet the distance seemed infinitely stretched.  Even a Yuan Ying cultivator would struggle to touch Qin Sang's clothes, yet the thunder tortoise, a higher realm than Qin Sang, surged forward like a rainbow, smashing through with irresistible force.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>When the thunder tortoise struck, it shattered another sword star and a sword spirit clone of Qin Sang.  Then, it was enveloped by the starry river again, venting its fury and frustration with roars.</p><p>Qin Sang consistently followed his strategy. He certainly had other options; he could have used the Solar God Tree to directly counter Lei Pan, and the six celestial birds would likely have yielded better results than the fiery lotus. But the Solar God Tree consumed too much energy. Even at the Transformation God realm, he couldn’t use it many times.  In a place like the Storm Belt, it was best to conserve strength.</p><p>The battle seemed to return to its starting point. Qin Sang moved between the Seven Mansions, continuously using the sword array to manifest light swords and attack the thunder tortoise.</p><p>The thunder tortoise, increasingly agitated by the relentless assault, found it harder to notice the changes within its body.  It roared like thunder.</p><p>The thunder tortoise exploded in rage, merging with the thunder, transforming into a true thunder tortoise, its ferocity unmatched.  It pursued Qin Sang within the sword array.</p><p>Sword stars scattered wildly, leaving bright trails in the starry river.  However, it was clear the thunder tortoise's momentum was waning; it was being gradually worn down by its entanglement with Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang too was greatly depleted, but he remained in control.  Unseen, the poison within the thunder tortoise had accumulated to a critical level!</p><p>Watching the thunder tortoise rampage through the sword array, Qin Sang's eyes flashed.  He raised his hand to the void, and a sword materialized in his palm—the Grey Warbler Sword.</p><p>The starry river suddenly dissipated, the sword stars extinguished.  The howling of the storm returned.</p><p>This wasn't land; it was impossible to tell how far Qin Sang and the thunder tortoise had moved during their battle.  However, when they reappeared, they were close, facing each other!  The starry river seemed like an illusion.  The thunder tortoise shook its head, fixing its gaze on its reappearing prey, eyes filled with extreme ferocity. It transformed into a huge ball of lightning and charged.</p><p>A cold glint appeared in Qin Sang's eyes. He made no attempt to evade. The Grey Warbler Sword flashed and vanished. Simultaneously, shimmering light appeared around the thunder tortoise, revealing seven Qin Sangs, each wielding a sword.</p><p>Seven swords pointed at the thunder tortoise, suddenly transforming into seven beams of light, crisscrossing above it.</p><p>Sensing the overwhelming killing intent and sword energy, the thunder tortoise was enraged, poised to counterattack, when a strange sensation erupted within its body.</p><p>While deploying the Seven Souls Killing Formation, Qin Sang silently activated the poison bead, awakening the accumulated poisonous light within the thunder turtle.  The potent poison and the Seven Souls Killing Formation attacked from inside and outside simultaneously.</p><p>The thunder turtle's cry was distorted with pain.</p><p>Even its powerful body, capable of resisting the potent poison, saw its thunder light dim, its thunder armor losing its luster and appearing thin.</p><p>At that moment, seven sword lights converged and slashed down!</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>Tiny cracks, almost invisible to the naked eye, suddenly appeared on the thunder armor, then it shattered.</p><p>The sword light pierced through the armor, deeply embedding itself within the thunder turtle!</p><p>‘Roar!’</p><p>The thunder turtle let out an agonizing roar, its body drenched in blood.  Besides the external sword wounds, raging sword energy wreaked havoc within its body.  Though not yet dead, it trembled violently, diving into the sea.</p><p>‘Splash!’</p><p>Bloody water surged into the air, instantly swept away by the storm.</p><p>The thunder turtle thrashed in the sea, its frantic eyes showing fear for the first time. It fled without looking back.</p><p>However, before it had escaped far, a blue light blocked its path. Two giant snakes coiled and danced, attacking the thunder turtle together.</p><p>Having broken through to the late Yuan Ying stage, and having refined the Four-Ride Giant Snake Seal in my external avatar for many years, I can now control two giant snakes.  However, it still feels somewhat strenuous, not as effortless as Yin Changsheng's skill back then.</p><p>My external avatar surveyed the surroundings, confirming there were no other ferocious beasts, and came to assist.</p><p>Qin Sang's main body didn't stop either. The fire lotus descended almost simultaneously with the snakes, falling from the sky. Flames instantly engulfed this area of the sea, encircling the thunder turtle.</p><p>The snakes spewed icy flames, a striking contrast to the demonic fire.</p><p>Qin Sang and his external avatar appeared one after the other, observing the thunder turtle below. One controlled the Grey Warbler Sword, manipulating the demonic fire to attack; the other, adorned with the Four-Ride Giant Snake Seal, silently manipulated hand seals.</p><p>Of course, the main body was the main force, while the avatar acted opportunistically, also restraining the thunder turtle.</p><p>The thunder turtle's cries grew increasingly shrill. Its enormous body thrashed in the fire, but it was more like a death throe. Old injuries added to new ones, along with the poison and sword energy rampaging within; how could it be Qin Sang's opponent?</p><p>If Qin Sang hadn't intended to capture it alive, the thunder turtle would have been killed already!</p><p>Facing attacks from both front and rear, the thunder turtle had no chance to escape.</p><p>Qin Sang and his avatar cooperated seamlessly, unleashing their powers to continuously drain the thunder turtle's strength.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>The Grey Warbler Sword slashed through the air.</p><p>The thunder turtle desperately dodged, but it failed to avoid the combined attack of the giant snakes. With a ‘boom’, the thunder turtle stiffened, its body covered in a layer of ice.</p><p>Simultaneously, a figure flashed above, and the external avatar struck out with a blindingly white icy blast.  The Ice Soul Light swept across the thunder turtle, freezing it.</p><p>‘Crackle… crackle…’</p><p>Cracks spread across the ice.</p><p>Even in its weakened state, the thunder turtle remained ferociously resistant. The external avatar alone couldn't completely freeze it.</p><p>Qin Sang snorted coldly.  Seizing the opportunity, his main body reached out, drawing the demonic fire to swiftly coalesce into a black rope, binding the thunder turtle tightly. The demonic fire seeped into its wounds, targeting its vital points.</p><p>Then, the Grey Warbler Sword's energy soared, rotating as it struck the thunder turtle's head, stunning it. Qin Sang then moved swiftly, his fingers like clamps, gripping the demonic fire rope and pulling it taut.</p><p>The avatar retracted its spiritual treasures and powers, and the second Yuan Ying returned to the main body.</p><p>Qin Sang dragged the thunder turtle and sped away, disappearing into the depths of the storm.</p><p>Unsure if there were other ferocious beasts nearby—the Abyssal Ruins had some beasts with extraordinary and dangerous abilities, sensing disturbances from afar—his true energy was heavily depleted, so he needed to leave the battlefield quickly.</p><p>…</p><p>After leaving, Qin Sang contemplated how to deal with the thunder turtle, completely unaware of the consequences of his battle in the storm zone.</p><p>After he departed, the blood-red seawater on the battlefield was immediately swept away by the storm, revealing once more the sky-obscuring tempest and the tumultuous waves.  The fierce battle left no trace behind.</p><p>Yet, as time passed, this area of the sea seemed to undergo unknown changes.</p><p>The changes were incredibly slow, imperceptible even to someone constantly present. Only after a long period would one suddenly realize that the surroundings had altered.</p><p>After a long, unknown time, the sea faintly turned red.  The color remained unchanged even after the storms, indicating the anomaly wasn't from the seawater.</p><p>Looking at the sky, a faint red glow had appeared, as if a red veil was cast, even the hurricanes passing through were stained crimson.</p><p>The eerie red light gradually intensified, but still at an extremely slow pace, spanning months or even years.</p><p>A very, very long time passed.</p><p>The area finally transformed into a sea of blood.</p><p>Then, the source of the change became apparent.  The red light shone down from the boundless sky, an unknown force piercing through even the storms.</p><p>The storms in the areas bathed in the red light were suppressed, the hurricanes subtly gentler than elsewhere, their howls less harsh. Yet, the Heavenly Demon's sound in this area intensified, its madness seeming to infect the very heavens and earth.</p><p>The red light was most intense high above.</p><p>If anyone were standing on the sea surface, gazing upwards, they could clearly see the source of the red light, even through the layers of hurricanes.</p><p>Like a faintly visible red moon hanging in the sky.</p><p>Or, like a slowly opening demonic eye!</p><p>(End)</p>
