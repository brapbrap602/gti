<h1>Chapter 1331: A Hundred Birds Pay Homage to the Phoenix</h1><p>An unprecedented phenomenon appeared at the entrance of the passageway.  </p><p>Continuous streams of multicolored light shot out from within, forming a radiant cloud in the void that gradually expanded outward, becoming increasingly conspicuous.  </p><p>However, the ring of thunder did not continue to grow. It hung in the distant sky, embedded within the dark clouds.  </p><p>If not for Canghong Zhenren and the others being certain that the Old Demon Ye lacked the ability to destroy the passageway, everyone would have already been on edge.  </p><p>At this moment, Canghong Zhenren and Tongyou Mojun finally arrived.  </p><p>The two groups hurried over, both having noticed the anomaly.  </p><p>"Has the ancient restriction of the entire forbidden zone been destroyed by the Old Demon Ye?"  </p><p>Canghong Zhenren looked toward the end of the stone path.  </p><p>Qin Sang briefly described the scene within the forbidden zone, then turned his gaze to the passageway in the sky. "Zhenren, did you anticipate such a phenomenon? Could it be the work of the Old Demon Ye?"  </p><p>Canghong Zhenren's expression remained calm. "The thunder wandering around the passageway could obliterate us with a single strike. No matter how powerful the Old Demon Ye is, he cannot destroy the passageway. At most, he can set up obstacles to delay us. Even if we rush over now, it would be futile. It's better to first investigate what the Old Demon Ye has done here. If we can find any clues and discern his intentions, we can achieve twice the result with half the effort!"  </p><p>Hearing this, everyone agreed and set aside other thoughts. They formed a formation and re-entered the forbidden zone.  </p><p>Soon, they arrived at their previous location.  </p><p>The area was still eerily silent, with no sign of the Old Demon Ye or any traps. Although part of the ancient restriction had been broken by the Old Demon Ye, many dangers still remained.  </p><p>Working together, they passed through layers of ancient restrictions and finally reached the end of the stone path, where they saw the seal!  </p><p>"The Old Demon Ye has already left!"  </p><p>Qin Sang activated his Heavenly Eye Divine Ability, confirming that the Old Demon Ye was not hiding nearby.  </p><p>"There are cracks on the stone pillars. The seal has been damaged..."  </p><p>Canghong Zhenren swiftly moved behind a stone pillar, his pupils flickering with a strange light. After a brief inspection, he revealed a look of surprise. "The seal was broken not long ago. The Old Demon Ye has only just left!"  </p><p>Among the three forbidden zones, only this one's seal had been broken by the Old Demon Ye.  </p><p>This was no coincidence!  </p><p>"Has the Old Demon Ye been scheming to break the seal here for the past twenty years?"  </p><p>Zhenyi Daozhang's eyes widened in astonishment as he stared at the mud pit at the center of the four stone pillars. "What was sealed in this forbidden zone that he released?"  </p><p>Canghong Zhenren and the other cultivators from the Sin Abyss shook their heads.  </p><p>This place was a forbidden zone precisely because of its powerful and dangerous ancient restrictions. Countless Sin Abyss cultivators had attempted to explore it, but all had failed.  </p><p>Before this, they could only speculate about the purpose of the stone pillars.  </p><p>The remaining traces indicated that the sealing power here was extremely strong. It was unclear how the Old Demon Ye had managed to open the forbidden zone and break the seal single-handedly.  </p><p>Qin Sang flew to the side of the stone pillars and examined them for a moment, easily finding several cracks in the seal. He moved closer and ordered the Heavenly Eye Butterfly to activate its divine ability to investigate.  </p><p>"It's empty inside. Unfortunately, the traces have been destroyed by filth."  </p><p>Qin Sang sighed softly. "There must have been a demon sealed here originally!"  </p><p>The expressions of the group varied.  </p><p>If a demon could survive in the Blood Lake until recently, it was entirely possible that the demon sealed in this forbidden zone was still alive.  </p><p>Canghong Zhenren's doubts were finally resolved, and he couldn't help but feel a surge of anger. "The remnants of the demon we killed must be connected to this demon! The Blood Lake expedition was also part of their scheme. The Jade Bone Brocade Skin, the Dark Crystal Tower, and the Nascent Souls of those fellow cultivators were all key to the demon's escape!"  </p><p>He was close to guessing the truth.  </p><p>Qin Sang flew around the four stone pillars several times, occasionally using the Ebony Sword to test the power of the seal. "Both the demon and the Old Demon Ye have disappeared, making it impossible to determine their intentions. Perhaps the Old Demon Ye is also a pawn, manipulated against his will."  </p><p>At Yitian Peak in the Seven Slaughter Palace, Qin Sang had witnessed the tragic fate of the three alliance leaders controlled by the Demon Lord, and he couldn't help but speculate along those lines.  </p><p>And that was only a fragment of the Demon Lord's soul.  </p><p>The Old Demon Ye's cultivation was on par with the three alliance leaders. If he too had been controlled by an ancient demon, his fate would likely be no better.  </p><p>Qin Sang's expression grew solemn. His worst fears had come true.  </p><p>Beneath Yitian Peak, so many top experts of the Canglang Sea had sacrificed their lives, and even then, they had only managed to suppress the Demon Lord with great difficulty by relying on an ancient seal.  </p><p>Now, with the seal here broken, the demon had escaped!  </p><p>The only silver lining was that the power of this seal was far inferior to that of Yitian Peak.  </p><p>Yitian Peak not only had the ancient restrictions of the three races but also the heavy treasures left behind by them, which worked in tandem with the restrictions to suppress the Demon Lord. Here, there were only four crude stone pillars.  </p><p>Although the material seemed extraordinary, it was undoubtedly no match for the Demon-Suppressing Stele or the Dragon Corpse.  </p><p>This indicated that the being sealed here was not on the same level as the Demon Lord, and the situation had not yet reached an irreparable state.  </p><p>Qin Sang shared his findings with Qingjun, instructing her to prepare the Demon-Binding Rope. Fortunately, his senior sister had previously refined the array diagram during her seclusion, and this treasure might truly come in handy now.  </p><p>"It seems we can only understand the Old Demon Ye's intentions by meeting him in person! We have another enemy now, but the demon has only just escaped and is surely still in a weakened state. With all the top experts of the Northern Dipper Realm gathered here, there's no need to fear anything..."  </p><p>"The anomaly in the passageway must be the work of the demon!"  </p><p>"This is no place to linger. We must leave quickly."  </p><p>...  </p><p>The demon was unfathomable.  </p><p>Feeling a sense of urgency, the group made a swift decision and turned to leave the forbidden zone.  </p><p>At this moment, Qingjun suddenly spoke up. "You all go ahead. I'll try to analyze the seal. Perhaps I can discover something. It won't take long, and I'll catch up shortly."  </p><p>Qin Sang was concerned that his senior sister would be alone and vulnerable, but the two of them couldn't both stay behind. After discussing with Jingyu, he said to Qingjun, "Fellow Daoist Jingyu will also stay. If anything unexpected happens, you can support each other."  </p><p>With Bai and the Nascent Soul Talisman Puppet by his side, Qin Sang didn't need to worry about his own safety.  </p><p>Qingjun accepted the suggestion gracefully and thanked Jingyu.  </p><p>After the group flew out of the forbidden zone, they headed straight for the passageway at top speed.  </p><p>Once they had left, Jingyu stood on the stone path, summoning the Thunder Thought Bead. Its light illuminated the surroundings as he kept watch while observing Qingjun's actions, curious about what she planned to do.  </p><p>Qingjun lingered outside the seal for a moment before actually passing through the cracks and entering the mud pit!  </p><p>Although the seal had been broken, its remaining power was still formidable.  </p><p>Qingjun had already summoned the Five Directions Tower, suspending it above her head to protect herself. At the same time, her jade fingers moved like wheels, forming a series of intricate hand seals that dazzled the eyes.  </p><p>Finally, with a wave of her sleeve, the Green Luan Puppet, draped in the Hidden Moon Map of the Rivers and Mountains, flew out from her sleeve.  </p><p>Simultaneously, dozens to hundreds of green light orbs appeared around her. As Qingjun infused them with puppet seals, they transformed into lifelike Green Luans.  </p><p>A hundred birds paying homage to the phoenix!  </p><p>The Green Luans circled around Qingjun, emitting melodious chirps. They were exceptionally lively, their movements graceful, and their eyes bright and alert, as if searching for something.  </p><p>Even Jingyu, seeing this for the first time, couldn't help but marvel in secret.</p>
