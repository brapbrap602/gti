<h1>Chapter 1022: True Demon Skill</h1><p>Chapter 1022: True Demon Skill</p><p>Hearing Bai’s words, Qin Sang’s heart stirred,</p><p>“I’ve met her before!  Back then, I was trapped in the Demon Sea due to a demonic disturbance.  At the invitation of  Yue Xian Gu, I rescued her from a place where True Demon Qi was concentrated.  I don’t know if it was due to her constitution or her cultivation technique, but she could directly absorb True Demon Qi into her body—something even Yuan Ying cultivators couldn’t do…”</p><p>“We haven’t seen each other since.  Su Nu somehow ended up under the Eastern Extreme Alliance leader…”</p><p>Qin Sang quickly recounted Su Nu’s origins, hoping to awaken some of Bai’s memories. True Demon Qi, also known as Ancient Demon Qi, was very likely from the same era as Bai.</p><p>“True Demon Qi…”</p><p>Bai fell silent, deep in thought.</p><p>Seeing that Bai didn’t respond, Qin Sang looked up at Su Nu, who was fleeing, and had a sudden idea. He put on a mask and took out an ordinary spirit sword from his pouch.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>Su Nu was focused on escaping and didn’t notice Qin Sang hidden nearby, flying past overhead.</p><p>Then, a huge snow eagle, carrying a gust of cold wind, arrived.</p><p>The moment the snow eagle flew by, Qin Sang struck.</p><p>‘Whizz!’</p><p>The spirit sword cut through the wind, sword light flashing, instantly transforming into a whirling sword wheel, aimed straight at the snow eagle’s abdomen.</p><p>Su Nu had seen the Blackwood Sword during their last meeting and might recognize it.  The Qingfeng Daoist identity was connected to Old Demon Mu, and Qin Sang didn't want to reveal it, so he used a different sword.</p><p>He had independently mastered the technique of dividing sword light, allowing him to use a sword wheel even without his main spirit sword.  </p><p>As for the Heavenly Demon Transformation, very few people knew about it, and Su Nu hadn’t seen it firsthand, so there was no need to hide it.</p><p>The snow eagle was incredibly powerful, its perception exceptionally acute. The moment Qin Sang appeared, it sensed danger, twisting its body mid-air to avoid the vital blow to its abdomen.  It swung its iron-like wings, striking at the flying sword.</p><p>How could Qin Sang’s full-powered swordsmanship be so easily broken?</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>A loud bang.</p><p>The snow eagle cried out in pain, flying off at an angle, stumbling. After a few frantic flaps of its wings, it managed to stabilize itself.  A trail of blood appeared on the ice, with several feathers torn from the snow eagle’s wing and a long gash revealed.</p><p>The snow eagle, in pain, let out a sharp shriek.</p><p>At this time, Su Nu, hearing the commotion, turned her head to see the scene, momentarily stunned.</p><p>“What are you standing there for! Come quickly and help me kill this beast, do you want to attract more monsters?!”</p><p>Qin Sang gave Su Nu a cold look and pursued the snow eagle with his sword. Su Nu looked at the mask on Qin Sang’s face, unable to figure out why he would save her, her mind racing.  But considering her current predicament, what was the point of overthinking?</p><p>She steeled her heart, took a healing pill to suppress her injuries, summoned her magic blade, and joined Qin Sang in hunting the snow eagle.</p><p>Although Qin Sang wasn’t using his full strength, his swordsmanship was superb.  His sword wheel alone forced the snow eagle into repeated retreats.  Simultaneously, not wanting to expose his trump cards, and to speed up the battle, he summoned the white crane.</p><p>The white crane was weaker than the snow eagle, but it fought dirty, flying around erratically, targeting the snow eagle’s lower body, inflicting immense pain.</p><p>Ever since following Qin Sang, the white crane had always used this sneaky fighting style.</p><p>Every time Qin Sang saw it, he felt a chill down his spine. He swore it wasn't his teaching; the creature was just inherently that way. Seeing it worked quite well, he let it be.</p><p>With the white crane and Su Nu joining the fight, the snow eagle was almost defenseless.</p><p>It instinctively sensed danger and turned to flee, but it was too late.</p><p>‘Plop!’</p><p>The white crane unexpectedly dug its claw into the snow eagle's rear.</p><p>The snow eagle let out a 'whoosh', its eyes bulging.</p><p>‘Bang!’</p><p>Su Nu seized the opportunity, her magic blade striking the snow eagle squarely.</p><p>White feathers scattered, the snow eagle screamed, its body unbalanced, crashing heavily onto the ice.</p><p>Immediately, a brilliant sword light, like a silver river falling from the sky, engulfed the snow eagle. The next moment, blood stained the ice, quickly freezing into crimson ice shards.</p><p>The snow eagle lay on the ice, a corpse.</p><p>The white crane’s claws were blood-soaked, its eyes showing clear disdain as it wiped them on the snow eagle’s white feathers.</p><p>Su Nu glanced at the snow eagle and the white crane, then looked at Qin Sang, politely bowing and gratefully saying, "My name is Su Nu. Thank you for saving me!"</p><p>Qin Sang, ignoring the white crane's protests, put it away into the ring, then burned the snow eagle's corpse, wiping away the blood. She coldly said, "Hmph! You dared to lure ferocious beasts, endangering me. If I weren't looking for herbs nearby and didn't want this place to be disrupted, I wouldn't care if you lived or died!"</p><p>Hearing this, Su Nu felt relieved.  She said seriously, "Regardless, you saved my life, that's undeniable.  May I ask your identity?  If I have the chance in the future, I will repay your kindness."</p><p>Her eyes fluttered, her face full of hopeful expectation as she looked at Qin Sang, looking pitiful.</p><p>Unfortunately, such tactics were useless against the cold-hearted Qin Sang.</p><p>"Let's talk after we leave this place..."</p><p>Qin Sang tapped her foot, activating her movement technique, and flew into the distance.</p><p>Su Nu stamped her foot in frustration, but dared not leave on her own, and quickly followed, saying, "Thank you for reminding me. I killed two minor demons and stayed too long in one place, inadvertently drawing the attack of a pack of ferocious beasts. I barely escaped them, only to attract this snow eagle. I was at the end of my strength, and thankfully I met you, or I would have lost my life."</p><p>This wasn't entirely a fabrication.</p><p>She had been hunted by the Ice Jiao King. After activating a talisman, she was about to shake him off, but the Ice Jiao King lured other demons. She used every means to escape the Ice Jiao King, but this snow eagle was incredibly fast and relentlessly pursued her.</p><p>Remembering the danger she had just faced, Su Nu still felt a lingering fear.</p><p>The two flew a distance apart.</p><p>Qin Sang stopped, turning to look at Su Nu.</p><p>Su Nu clenched her hands, nervous.</p><p>"I find your cultivation technique quite strange, unlike anything I've ever seen," Qin Sang examined Su Nu, feigning ignorance. "The aura you used to condense the black long sword, it wasn't spiritual energy, was it? It resembled demonic energy, yet it's completely different. What kind of power is it?"</p><p>Su Nu's expression relaxed slightly. She softly said, "The power I wield is indeed not spiritual energy. However, even if you haven't seen it, you must have heard of it. It's called True Demonic Energy."</p><p>"True Demonic Energy?"</p><p>Qin Sang showed a surprised expression. "The legendary demonic energy from ancient times, now only found in a few special places, feared even by demon cultivators. You actually cultivate using it?  Do you practice some ancient demonic technique?"</p><p>Su Nu shook her head, honestly replying, "I don't know if it's an ancient demonic technique. My senior gave me this technique, simply calling it the 'True Demon Technique,' without revealing its true origins."</p><p>"True Demon Technique."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, secretly asking Bai if it remembered anything.</p>
