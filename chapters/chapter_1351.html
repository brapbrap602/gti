<h1>Chapter 1343: Void Storm</h1><p>After devouring countless spectral souls, the Soul-Gathering Gourd solidified into a tangible form.  </p><p>Old Demon Ye observed the movements of the Jade Bone Demon and knew that this fiend was inherently unruly and would never heed his advice. Thus, he chose to remain silent.  </p><p>*Crack!*  </p><p>A thunderous roar erupted out of nowhere, shaking the entire Purple Palace, both inside and out.  </p><p>The Blood Altar, which had been glowing with an ominous red light, began to flicker uncontrollably. This was the first time since the anomalies in the Purple Palace began that the Blood Altar had experienced such violent fluctuations.  </p><p>Old Demon Ye was slightly startled and abruptly raised his head.  </p><p>The dense ghostly mist obscured his view of the inner hall, making it impossible to see what was happening inside.  </p><p>However, at the far end of the crimson light that shot into the sky, the heavens seemed to have been torn apart. The void collapsed, and a gray storm veiled the horizon, more terrifying than even the deepest reaches of the ancient battlefield of immortals.  </p><p>Witnessing this apocalyptic scene, Old Demon Ye's heart trembled. His breathing grew rapid, and his expression shifted unpredictably. When his gaze fell upon the Blood Altar, his eyes were filled with a complex mix of eagerness and worry.  </p><p>The Jade Bone Demon withdrew his gaze from the Soul-Gathering Gourd and glanced toward the inner hall. He let out a strange laugh, his eyes shifting before finally landing on the Blood Altar. With a cold shout, he commanded, "Merge!"  </p><p>*Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!*  </p><p>Blood threads shot back from all directions.  </p><p>One by one, the blood infants were summoned back. They circled around the two figures a few times before diving into the Blood Altar, merging with the ancient blood seals. Their true forms became almost indistinguishable.  </p><p>The Jade Bone Demon's fingers flicked rapidly as he sent a series of runes toward the altar, working with intense focus.  </p><p>*Boom!*  </p><p>A fierce gale erupted!  </p><p>Countless intricate and mysterious runes appeared on the altar, suddenly glowing with a brilliant light.  </p><p>An unprecedented wave of energy burst forth from the altar, shooting straight into the heavens!  </p><p>The crimson light was shattered by the energy wave, and the area around the altar was filled with a storm-like, chaotic force.  </p><p>Old Demon Ye was struck by the impact and let out a muffled grunt. He quickly channeled his true essence to stabilize himself. Seeing the astonishing phenomenon caused by the altar, his eyes revealed a hint of terror.  </p><p>He and the Jade Bone Demon hovered in the upper part of the altar, surrounded by the storm.  </p><p>The center of the storm was the top of the altar.  </p><p>There, a faint layer of cyan light appeared. Ancient runes projected into the void, forming a phantom image that seemed to resemble some kind of ancient formation diagram, slowly rotating.  </p><p>The altar continued to tremble violently.  </p><p>The Jade Bone Demon stopped his movements and stared intently at the altar. Sensing the energy waves emanating from it, he nodded in satisfaction.  </p><p>"How much longer?" Old Demon Ye licked his lips, his voice hoarse and urgent.  </p><p>"That depends on when the anomalies in the Purple Palace come to an end," the Jade Bone Demon replied indifferently, glancing toward the inner hall.  </p><p>Before his words had fully faded, he grabbed the Soul-Gathering Gourd and took a step forward. In a flash, he vanished from Old Demon Ye's sight.  </p><p>Old Demon Ye remained where he was.  </p><p>A flicker of displeasure crossed his eyes, but he quickly suppressed it.  </p><p>...  </p><p>Neither of them noticed.  </p><p>Not far from the Blood Altar, amidst countless spectral beings, a figure stood motionless.  </p><p>He had no cover or concealment, standing there boldly and openly.  </p><p>Not only had the Jade Bone Demon and Old Demon Ye failed to detect him, but even the spectral beings and drifting blood clouds that passed by him were completely unaware of his presence.  </p><p>His entire body was shrouded in an aura of death, blending perfectly with the ghostly mist, hiding him flawlessly.  </p><p>This person was none other than Bai!  </p><p>Just as Qin Sang had anticipated, the ghostly mist and blood clouds posed no hindrance to him. In fact, within the mist, his strength in all aspects had increased, making him even more powerful than he was outside.  </p><p>However, Bai had not returned to find Qin Sang. Instead, he had been standing here all along, gazing upward. His focus was not on Old Demon Ye or the Jade Bone Demon, but on the Blood Altar itself and the mysterious ancient blood seals.  </p><p>Bai's eyes were a pale gray, devoid of pupils, and completely motionless. His gaze appeared utterly hollow.  </p><p>His expression was one of confusion, his brows tightly furrowed into a deep crease as he struggled to recall something.  </p><p>When he saw the phenomenon on the altar, Bai's eyes finally shifted. The confusion on his face gradually dissipated, replaced by shock. His eyes grew brighter and brighter, his gaze shifting back and forth between the altar and the Jade Bone Demon.  </p><p>Finally, Bai took a deep look at the Blood Altar and slowly retreated.  </p><p>In the next moment, his figure paused slightly as he turned his head to look to his side.  </p><p>...  </p><p>Inside the inner hall of the Purple Palace.  </p><p>The fragments of the continent that had once floated on the outskirts were nowhere to be found, having long been crushed into dust and scattered by the five-colored immortal winds. A vast chasm now separated the inner hall from the outer hall.  </p><p>The inner hall was even more chaotic than when Qin Sang had first emerged, teetering on the brink of losing control.  </p><p>The void storm that Old Demon Ye had witnessed was merely the tip of the iceberg; the true source lay within the inner hall.  </p><p>The sky was dark, with heavy leaden clouds hanging low.  </p><p>The five-colored immortal winds were not mere gusts; they were intertwined with heavenly thunder, creating a terrifying spectacle. It was as if spatial turbulence was raging everywhere within the inner hall, causing the entire structure to tremble violently, as though it might be overturned at any moment.  </p><p>Yet, the scenery within the inner hall possessed a strange beauty, a kaleidoscope of colors. The immortal seals had been activated by the five-colored winds, revealing the full majesty of the immortal palace.  </p><p>Even in its ruined state, it remained magnificent and dazzling.  </p><p>Unfortunately, few had the luxury of appreciating the masterpiece left behind by the ancient cultivators.  </p><p>Several figures were fleeing for their lives.  </p><p>They had grown too greedy, lingering in the inner hall for too long. By the time they realized something was wrong, the anomalies had escalated to a dangerously uncontrollable level, forcing them to flee.  </p><p>They did their utmost to navigate through the ancient seals, their escape lights appearing as small as ants amidst the overwhelming five-colored winds, looking pitifully insignificant and fragile.  </p><p>Suddenly, one of the escape lights flickered out.  </p><p>Shortly after, a beam ofå¹½blue light shot into the sky from where the escape light had vanished. It turned out that another immortal seal had erupted, and the unfortunate individual had stumbled right into it.  </p><p>After a long while, the escape light did not reappear. The chances of survival were slim.  </p><p>...  </p><p>Within the ghostly mist.  </p><p>After capturing the blood infant, the group began to employ various secret techniques to analyze the evil formation.  </p><p>The blood infant was connected to the evil formation.  </p><p>To be more precise, the blood infant was a part of the evil formation itself.  </p><p>They had made some new discoveries, but with only one blood infant in their possession, it was impossible to easily decipher the formation.  </p><p>Now, their group had grown larger.  </p><p>Another team of cultivators, having detected the commotion caused by Qin Sang's battle with the blood infant, had approached and joined forces with them. This new group was even larger than Qin Sang's original team.  </p><p>To their delight, Elder Canghong was among them.  </p><p>With three top-tier experts gathered together, they at least no longer had to worry about their safety.  </p><p>"Without a doubt, Fellow Daoist Tongyou should be in that direction. As for Fellow Daoist Leng and the others who were scattered first, I didn't catch sight of their movements..." Elder Canghong pointed to the left as he spoke.  </p><p>Great minds think alike.  </p><p>His thoughts aligned with those of Elder Zhenyi. They agreed that their first priority was to gather more allies, at least enough to form a proper formation. Only then could they confront Old Demon Ye at the Blood Altar. Otherwise, it would be nothing short of suicide.  </p><p>Elder Canghong had been luckier. When he was scattered, he had a few fellow Daoists by his side, and over time, he had managed to gather quite a number of people.  </p><p>After some discussion, they decided to first regroup with Demon Lord Tongyou.  </p><p>Once again, Qin Sang and the Nascent Soul puppet took the lead.  </p><p>The resistance they faced grew stronger, but their speed increased as well.  </p><p>After advancing for a while, Qin Sang, who was wielding the Ebony Sword to slay spectral beings, suddenly sensed something. His expression shifted slightly.  </p><p>(To be continued...)</p>
