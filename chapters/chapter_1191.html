<h1>Chapter 1183: Luring the Enemy</h1><p>*Boom...*</p><p>The deafening roar echoed across the mountains and wilderness.</p><p>The protective light barrier flickered, alternating between brightness and dimness. In some places, cracks and fractures had begun to appear. Nearby cultivators were either injured or killed, some coughing up blood as they retreated. Immediately, new squads rushed forward to replace them, pouring their energy into repairing the barrier.</p><p>The battle formation remained unshaken.</p><p>The first wave of attacks from the two realms' cultivators had failed to breach the defenses of the Sin Abyss.</p><p>Unwilling to be outdone, the Sin Abyss seized the opportunity to charge forward, launching a fierce counterattack.</p><p>After several waves of clashes, the distance between the two sides grew closer, and the protective light barrier began to waver precariously.</p><p>Within the cold mist...</p><p>A group of cultivators simultaneously summoned shield-like magical artifacts. These shields were wide at the top and narrow at the bottom. Once activated, they radiated brilliant light, projecting a massive phantom image many times larger than the actual shield.</p><p>These phantoms soared into the air, overlapping and interlocking to form a sharply defined light shield, hovering above their respective squads.</p><p>After years of resource scarcity and facing threats from both sides, the Celestial Alliance, through generations of research, had developed these uniform magical artifacts.</p><p>The results proved their effectiveness on the battlefield.</p><p>Following the alliance of the two realms, these shields quickly became widespread.</p><p>In addition to the shields, another group of cultivators in the squads summoned heavy iron swords and broadswords.</p><p>The moment the light shields formed, sword energy and blade light surged out from the battle formation in perfect unison. Rows upon rows of gleaming, icy light swept toward the enemy like a tidal wave.</p><p>In contrast, the Sin Abyss side appeared far more sinister.</p><p>Some squads formed circular formations, their hands shaking black bells while chanting incantations, as if performing some strange ritual.</p><p>Soon, clusters of black energy began to condense above the center of these squads.</p><p>Under the watchful eyes of all, the black energy twisted and morphed, resembling thick, viscous sludge, taking on grotesque and nauseating shapes.</p><p>When the black energy came into contact with the dark rays emitted by the Obsidian Crystal Towers, it seemed to come alive, extending tendrils before forming torsos and limbs.</p><p>The shapes of the black energy varied—some took the form of birds and beasts, while others resembled human figures.</p><p>However, their forms were unstable, with what appeared to be sludge flowing across their surfaces.</p><p>They emitted eerie screeches, sharp and piercing.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang and Jing Lin quietly slipped away from the Cold Bell Formation, stealthily making their way toward the Obsidian Crystal Towers.</p><p>Qin Sang clearly saw that the demonic Elder Pei, who controlled the Obsidian Crystal Towers, was no longer positioned between the three towers but had instead hidden himself beside one of them.</p><p>Elder Pei believed he was invincible under the protection of the Obsidian Crystal Towers, but Qin Sang had seen through his ruse.</p><p>"What are the origins of these creatures?" Qin Sang's attention was drawn to the monsters summoned by the Sin Abyss cultivators. The bizarre scene made him frown deeply.</p><p>Jing Lin replied, "From what I know, this should be a type of mimicry spell, combined with those strange bells they're using. But the core of it lies in the Obsidian Crystal Towers. These monsters are difficult to kill, but they are not indestructible..."</p><p>Qin Sang stared at the nearest monster but couldn't discern anything unusual.</p><p>At this moment, Elder Tan, seeing the incoming waves of blade light and sword energy, let out a cold snort and issued an order.</p><p>With a series of roars, the monsters swiftly floated to the front of the battle formation, fearlessly charging toward the razor-sharp attacks.</p><p>*Rip!*</p><p>The sound of tearing fabric echoed repeatedly.</p><p>The front row of monsters was torn apart, limbs flying in all directions, but they did not die. Their broken bodies continued to fight back, clawing and entangling the blade light and sword energy.</p><p>Row after row of monsters were shattered, but the blade light and sword energy were also rapidly depleted.</p><p>Both sides were clearly familiar with each other's tactics. Before the monsters and the blade light could determine a victor, a second wave of attacks was launched.</p><p>Under Elder Tan's leadership, the Sin Abyss cultivators charged forward relentlessly, finally reaching the edge of the cold mist. Without hesitation, they led their forces into the formation!</p><p>Suddenly, a fierce gale erupted.</p><p>Within the cold mist, a heavy snowfall began. Endless snowflakes drifted down from the sky, swept up by the hurricane and blown toward the Sin Abyss forces.</p><p>At this moment, the light membrane bestowed upon the Sin Abyss cultivators by the Obsidian Crystal Towers proved its worth. The snowflakes melted away silently upon contact with their bodies.</p><p>Seemingly realizing that this attack was ineffective, the Cold Bell Formation emitted a series of chimes. The formation's controller altered its configuration, reducing the heavy snow to a moderate snowfall. The gales formed walls of wind and snow, blocking the Sin Abyss's advance.</p><p>The cultivators of the Minor Cold Realm seized the opportunity to launch a full-scale assault.</p><p>Seeing this, Elder Pei, who was controlling the Obsidian Crystal Towers from the rear, let out a cold snort. He changed his incantation, and the crystal spheres atop the towers shot out countless black beams, crashing directly into the wind walls and forcibly tearing open a path.</p><p>During this process, the cultivators of both sides engaged in fierce combat. The light barriers of the battle formations were already in tatters, on the verge of collapse.</p><p>Finally...</p><p>*Crack!*</p><p>The protective light barrier of the Sin Abyss shattered first, resulting in a sudden increase in casualties. Blood stained the ground.</p><p>Elder Tan's face twisted in anger, and he immediately ordered all the monsters to be released. These fearless creatures surged forward, enduring wave after wave of attacks, and finally managed to tear apart the light barrier above the two realms' cultivators.</p><p>Si Di's expression remained cold and stern, his gaze fixed firmly on Elder Tan.</p><p>Seeing this scene, his expression did not waver in the slightest.</p><p>Within the formation, they held the advantage of terrain. Their defenses should not have been breached so quickly—it was Si Di's deliberate ploy.</p><p>If the two sides continued to exchange blows in this manner, their Nascent Soul cultivators would never be able to engage directly. Si Di feared that if the battle dragged on too long, the Golden Core cultivators controlling the Cold Bell Formation would be unable to hold out, leaving them vulnerable.</p><p>The plan to ambush Elder Pei would then fall apart.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>A golden light circled around Si Di—it was his renowned treasure, the Golden Mirror of Transcendence.</p><p>This treasure was only the size of a palm, with a mirror-like surface at its center, polished from an unknown material. The rest of the mirror's surface was uneven, covered in bumps and golden nodules.</p><p>The Golden Mirror of Transcendence flew faster and faster, leaving behind streaks of golden light.</p><p>At the same time, Elder Tan grinned ferociously, locking eyes with Si Di without a hint of fear.</p><p>The fire rope coiled around his arm trembled slightly, emitting scorching flames that distorted the surrounding air.</p><p>The two Nascent Soul experts had long since set their sights on each other!</p><p>The Sin Abyss forces advanced rapidly.</p><p>The cultivators in both battle formations were tense, holding their breath as they prepared for the brutal battle to come.</p><p>A hundred zhang!</p><p>Fifty zhang!</p><p>Ten zhang!</p><p>...</p><p>"Kill!"</p><p>In an instant, earth-shaking roars erupted simultaneously.</p><p>The two battle formations collided violently, plunging the battlefield into chaos. The sounds of battle cries filled the air.</p><p>The chaos did not last long.</p><p>Both sides, seasoned in battle, gradually stabilized their formations, engaging the enemy in close combat.</p><p>From above, it looked as though the two forces had spread out like streams of water, merging and separating, the entire process filled with bloody slaughter.</p><p>Si Di and Elder Tan, each with their own schemes, paid no heed to the others. They soared over the crowd, heading straight for each other, their treasures clashing before they even met!</p><p>---</p><p>---</p><p>Thanks to Nanwang JF for the generous reward as an alliance leader.</p><p>I still owe you a chapter.</p><p>These past few days, I've been affected by the pandemic. Since my neighborhood is mostly elderly with few young people, I've been helping out and haven't had time to make up for it.</p><p>But the pandemic is almost over, and things are returning to normal.</p>
