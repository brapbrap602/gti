<h1></h1><p>While Great Sage Tianpeng and Demon King Huangmei were communicating.</p><p>Several other demon kings were busy around them.</p><p>The various demons and devils were currently standing on a white jade platform.</p><p>This was the deepest part of the Sea of Clouds.</p><p>After considerable effort, the group of demons and devils had forced their way through layers of ancient restrictions, arriving here one after another.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the deep valley was a scene of utter desolation.</p><p>Upon arriving, they did not see the treasures they had imagined, or any place resembling a treasure vault. There was only a three-tiered circular platform of white jade, the full extent of which could not be seen at a glance.</p><p>The circular platform was enormous, each tier the height of two men. Although its surface lacked beautiful patterns or designs, it was constructed from flawless white jade.</p><p>Against the backdrop of the surrounding rugged cliffs and scattered stones, it appeared exceptionally pure and magnificent.</p><p>From the center of the circular platform, a raging inferno erupted.</p><p>The pillar of fire soared a hundred *zhang* into the sky.</p><p>This was a kind of spiritual fire they had never seen before, multicolored and vibrant. Even standing at the edge of the platform, they felt no searing heat; it gave the impression of not being truly real.</p><p>Having endured for countless years, the spiritual fire had not been extinguished to this day, and it could still produce such an astonishing display, which was enough to awe everyone.</p><p>It was hard to imagine what the scene must have been like in ancient times!</p><p>When they first saw the great platform and the raging fire, the group of demons and devils were stunned, and it was only after a moment of shock that they remembered to rush to the top of the platform to observe it up close.</p><p>The center of the platform was originally hollow, and the surrounding area could only accommodate a few people standing side-by-side.</p><p>Looking down, all they could see was the raging flames, making it impossible to discern anything.</p><p>The demons and devils vaguely sensed that there was something beneath the flames. They walked around the platform and indeed found two enormously thick chains, hanging down into the depths of the fire.</p><p>The two chains were precisely fixed to opposite sides of the platform, jointly pulling on something. It was unknown what material they were made of, but they had been tempered by the flames for countless ages, yet remained completely unscathed.</p><p>The demons and devils tried to pull on the chains, but they could not budge them in the slightest.</p><p>Several demon kings even manifested their true forms, wielding strength capable of shaking mountains, but they still could not lift a single chain.</p><p>If this were any other place, they might have suspected that some evil entity was being suppressed beneath the platform, and they would not have dared to act so rashly.</p><p>However, based on the patterns on the cauldron of the Fragrant Pill Pavilion and their discoveries in other locations, they had targeted the deep valley, analyzing that it was most likely a treasure trove.</p><p>The platform resembled a giant cauldron for refining artifacts, and these flames were spiritual fire, which had been tempering the treasure at the end of the chains for countless years.</p><p>What kind of power would this treasure possess once it emerged?</p><p>At the thought of this possibility, the breathing of the demons and devils couldn't help but become somewhat heavier.</p><p>Through exploration, they discovered that the flames within the platform were very special, five parts resembling spiritual fire and five parts resembling the power of manifested restrictions, a strange force they had never seen before.</p><p>However, this did not hinder them from figuring out a solution.</p><p>The treasure seemed to be sealed below by the flames. As long as they continued to attack, scattering the flames and destroying the power of the seal, they would most likely be able to retrieve the treasure below.</p><p>Upon this discovery, the group of demons and devils, who had previously been at each other's throats, temporarily set aside their grudges.</p><p>The treasure had not yet been seen, and the Profound Heaven Palace was still watching them like a hawk, so fighting to the death now was meaningless.</p><p>Led by Great Sage Tianpeng and Elder Hunmo, the demons and devils tacitly separated, each occupying one of the iron chains on either side, and busied themselves.</p><p>The results proved to be quite effective!</p><p>The demons and devils spared no effort, each displaying their unique abilities. Various kinds of magical treasures and divine abilities emerged one after another, and the power of the fire pillar was already far less than before, with the sealing force greatly reduced.</p><p>If nothing unexpected happened, it wouldn't be long before the treasure appeared.</p><p>While Great Sage Tianpeng and Demon King Huangmei were communicating, they did not forget to attack the flames in the pit.</p><p>The Profound Heaven Palace did not come earlier or later, but chose to appear at this crucial moment.</p><p>After a moment of contemplation, Great Sage Tianpeng's figure flickered, transforming into a streak of golden light, circling to the other side of the platform. The devils along the way stopped their actions, their faces full of vigilance.</p><p>Great Sage Tianpeng, ignoring everyone else, went directly to find Elder Hunmo.</p><p>After listening to him, Elder Hunmo narrowed his eyes slightly and said coldly, "Every step within the valley is fraught with danger. It won't be so easy for Yin Changsheng to get here! However, the fact that the Profound Heaven Palace has only arrived now is already beyond my expectations. We wasted a lot of time opening the Yong'an Pavilion. I originally thought Yin Changsheng should have entered then."</p><p>Losing the Ganoderma Lucidum Scepter, they could not control the opening and closing of the space within the stone tablet, nor could they conceal the commotion of the space opening.</p><p>If the Profound Heaven Palace sent people to investigate, they would easily discover the anomaly.</p><p>Therefore, after entering the space within the stone tablet, the demons and devils had no interest in infighting; they were all focused on searching for treasure, unless a treasure appeared right in front of them, only then would they fight fiercely.</p><p>The Yong'an Pavilion was the most central location among all the halls within the space of the stone tablet.</p><p>Great Sage Tianpeng said indifferently, "Perhaps our arrangements in the Yong'an Pavilion played a role, delaying them a bit. The Yong'an Pavilion is so grand, it's the likes of which this Great Sage has never seen before, comparable to an immortal palace, far more attractive than this place. They will definitely go there first. However, since Yin Changsheng has already come looking, we can no longer harbor any wishful thinking. The Profound Heaven Palace has controlled the sacred land for many years. Who can say for sure how many things they have in their hands? Perhaps they have a way to influence this place! If you, Fellow Daoist, have found any treasures in the Yong'an Palace that are related to this place, you should take them out now. If you wait any longer, you might end up with nothing."</p><p>Elder Hunmo smiled without a word, revealing nothing.</p><p>Seeing that he could not probe the old devil's secrets, Great Sage Tianpeng snorted inwardly. He lowered his head and looked at the chains, "After attacking for so long, the power of the seal is already much weaker. It's time to pull the chains out. This Great Sage has a divine ability that can increase brute strength. Fellow Daoist should have similar means, right?"</p><p>"Forcefully pull it up?"</p><p>Elder Hunmo furrowed his brow, turned, and looked towards the entrance of the valley.</p><p>Shrouded in clouds and mist, and layered with ancient restrictions, the scene at the valley entrance was invisible, but one could imagine that the Profound Heaven Palace was rapidly approaching.</p><p>Great Sage Tianpeng's words were not without reason.</p><p>Even if the demons and devils joined forces, they could still contend, but who among them wasn't cunning and valued their lives above all else?</p><p>The Profound Heaven Palace not only had Yin Changsheng and a spirit treasure, but they also came from the same sect, unlike them, who each harbored their own schemes and were like scattered sand. Once they encountered each other, they would definitely be at a disadvantage.</p><p>"Very well," Elder Hunmo nodded slightly. "I observe that the object to which the chains are attached is probably not a single magical treasure or spirit treasure as we猜测, but a colossal entity. If it's a treasure vault or something similar, there would be enough for everyone to share."</p><p>Great Sage Tianpeng chuckled, noncommittal. He leaped back to the other side, summoned the other demon kings, and discussed the matter.</p><p>The other demons and devils were equally wary of the Profound Heaven Palace. Once Yin Changsheng arrived, their chances of obtaining the treasure would be even slimmer.</p><p>A consensus was quickly reached. The demons and devils unleashed their most powerful techniques, sparing no effort in attacking the seal.</p><p>For a time, the flames at the center of the platform fluctuated wildly, and the seal became increasingly chaotic.</p><p>Great Sage Tianpeng stared intently at the iron chain, seized the opportune moment, and suddenly erupted with golden light all over his body. He directly manifested his true form, transforming into a Golden-Winged Peng Bird, his giant wings like clouds obscuring the sky, majestic and extraordinary.</p><p>――</p><p>――</p><p>Returned late, so I'll publish one chapter today and make up for it tomorrow.</p>
