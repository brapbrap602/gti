<h1>Chapter 1776: Thunderclap Left Mansion</h1><p>Regardless of what kind of tempest this action would stir within the Three Suns Sect, Qin Sang drifted down outside the mountain, gradually walking further and further away, recalling the process of the just-concluded investiture ceremony.  The Supervising Master had shattered the golden talisman, failing to complete the final step of immolation, and thus unable to present it to the Divine Court and announce it to the realms of Yin and Yang. This essentially meant the investiture had failed.</p><p>However, the moment his divine sense and lifeblood fused with the blank golden talisman, a multitude of insights surged within him.  Combined with the secrets he had previously learned, Qin Sang gained a deeper understanding of the Ancestral Altar and the Dharma Decrees.</p><p>That golden talisman could only be considered a blank Dharma Decree.  Because when his divine sense, lifeblood, and the golden talisman merged, Qin Sang felt nothing special.  For the Three Suns Sect disciples, it was only after the seal was affixed and the talisman immolated, then presented, that the golden talisman transformed into a true Dharma Decree.</p><p>This clearly indicated that the immolation and presentation were the most crucial steps.</p><p>If a forced analogy were to be made, it could be compared to certain mortal nations where officials possessed the authority to recommend virtuous individuals under their jurisdiction.  However, they must first submit a memorial to the Grand Councilor or even the Emperor, and obtain the approval of the Imperial Court before the virtuous individuals could be officially appointed.</p><p>The Dharma Decree is akin to the official credentials and seal of the Imperial Court. Only with these credentials and seal could one officially assume office, and military commanders could mobilize troops.</p><p>As for this 'Imperial Court,' there are multiple interpretations. Some say it’s the Azure Heavens, the Great Dao; others say it's the Divine Court, the Celestial Court.</p><p>What these individuals obtained was not an official position, but the qualification to cultivate in this realm.  Through the Dharma Decree, they secured a place within this chaotic world, and obtained the recognition of the Celestial Deities, enabling them to invoke divine descent.</p><p>Because of this, in Qin Sang's view, the Bestowing Master and Supervising Master of the Three Suns Sect were more like officials with the authority to recommend candidates.  They had the power to recommend, but not to appoint. They could only open the altar and submit the memorial, acting as intermediaries.</p><p>It was even possible they lacked the ability to control the Ancestral Altar and the Dharma Decrees.</p><p>After all, the Investiture Dharma Altar of Mount Ju was so rare, and no sect could construct one on their own; they were all inherited from antiquity.</p><p>Therefore, the presiding master of the investiture could not detect Qin Sang's cultivation level. Even if someone could discern it, it should be the entity receiving the immolated and presented talisman.</p><p>Qin Sang looked up at the heavens. The sky was azure and vast, its limits unknown.</p><p>Where was the Dharma Decree sent?</p><p>And… where were the Gods?</p><p>Were there heavens beyond the heavens?</p><p>He had initially held a skeptical attitude towards the legends of the Daoist sects, but the existence of the Dharma Decrees forced him into deep contemplation.</p><p>Could the Two Courts of the Daoist Order be that 'Imperial Court'?</p><p>Was the immolated and presented talisman directly sent to the Two Courts?</p><p>If he were ultimately to be targeted by the Two Courts, all his actions over these years would seem utterly ridiculous.</p><p>However, Qin Sang felt the likelihood was small.  Fusing with the blank Dharma Decree involved only a sliver of divine sense and a drop of lifeblood; it shouldn't be so easy for them to see through his cultivation.</p><p>If the Two Courts could control the Ancestral Altars of all sects, they could completely decide who received the Dharma Decree and who didn't.  The cultivators of Mount Ju wouldn't be able to escape the grasp of the Daoist Order, and there would be no need to issue Dharma Edicts and offer merits for appeasement.</p><p>More importantly, Qin Sang had been pondering the implications of the Dharma Decree's existence.</p><p>The heavens and earth were in chaos, the Six Heavenly Ancient Qi ran rampant, and even Nascent Soul cultivators were helpless, even risking the ruin of their Dao path.  Could it be that this was simply the nature of the Great Dao's rules in this realm?</p><p>If so, the Dharma Decree, which allowed cultivators to cultivate in this environment, possessed a power akin to reshaping heaven and earth.  What kind of powerful being could wield such immense power?</p><p>Qin Sang believed the Dharma Decree's function might be to connect with this immense power, sheltering cultivators.  As for the source of this power, it was beyond his comprehension.</p><p>If the Two Courts possessed such power, they would have likely eradicated the demons of the Ghost Fang Kingdom long ago.</p><p>Perhaps, above the azure heavens, there truly existed a Celestial Court and divine beings!</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head involuntarily, withdrawing his gaze.</p><p>Regardless, if he wanted to continue cultivating, he could only adapt to local customs. The Dharma Decree was essential.  Further contemplation was futile; it was best to continue according to his plan.</p><p>Do one's utmost and leave the rest to fate.</p><p>After this test, Qin Sang was confident he wouldn't be exposed during the investiture.  His next goal was to obtain the High Divine Sky Decree!</p><p>…</p><p>Light flashed.</p><p>Qin Sang emerged from the teleportation formation.  Before he could steady himself, he was surrounded by several armored cultivators.</p><p>He was not surprised by this. He took out a square seal engraved with thunder runes and handed it to the leader of these men.  He was then allowed to pass.</p><p>The streets were sparsely populated, far less bustling than the immortal cities Qin Sang had seen before.</p><p>He glanced around casually and quickly lost interest, heading swiftly towards the city center.  Before long, he arrived in front of a magnificent mansion. After being announced, he entered and met a dignified Daoist.</p><p>“Fellow Daoist, are you Realized Master Mingyue?”</p><p>The Daoist had sword-like eyebrows and starry eyes, especially his pair of eyes.  The depths of his pupils seemed to contain two bolts of lightning, and his gaze upon Qin Sang was bright and captivating.</p><p>“Indeed, it is this humble Daoist. Greetings, Realized Master Zhang,” Qin Sang cupped his hands, presenting the square seal.</p><p>The person opposite him was a Realized Master of the Thunderclap Left Mansion. This immortal city was also a property of the Thunderclap Left Mansion.</p><p>The next investiture ceremony of the Thunderclap Left Mansion was in half a year, while the Thunderclap Right Mansion was still two years away.  Thus, Qin Sang sought out the Thunderclap Left Mansion first.</p><p>He still used the pretext of seeking a Dharma Decree for his disciple to make contact with the Thunderclap Left Mansion, hence his arrival in this city.</p><p>"This humble Daoist empathizes with Fellow Daoist’s profound love for your disciple. However, this endeavor requires infiltration into the Demon Kingdom, fraught with peril.  Would Fellow Daoist perhaps reconsider?  Your disciple might possess exceptional talent and need not undertake such a risk."</p><p>Realized Master Zhang spoke warmly.</p><p>The Thunderclap Left Mansion reserved a portion of the Dharma Decrees for cultivators outside the sect for each investiture, but these could not be purchased with spirit stones.</p><p>There were two ways to obtain the High Divine Sky Decree.</p><p>One was for the recipient to undergo a talent test alongside the disciples of the Thunderclap Left Mansion. Those with exceptional talent could directly qualify.</p><p>The other was for the recipient's master to perform a task for the Thunderclap Left Mansion, which was said to be generally difficult and highly dangerous.</p><p>Naturally, the level of danger depended on the strength of the one undertaking the task.</p><p>Qin Sang, considering that the rules for the second-rank Flowing Gold Fire Bell Decree were certainly stricter than the first-rank decree, planned to have Grandmaster Qi intervene when he went to the Thunderclap Right Mansion for promotion. This time, he would personally handle the matter.</p><p>“Many thanks for Realized Master Zhang’s kind intentions. This humble Daoist has already made up his mind.”</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head.</p><p>He was unsure how the Thunderclap Left Mansion tested talent, and if he displayed exceptional talent and attracted attention, it might lead to unforeseen variables. It was better to make an extra trip.</p><p>Seeing his resolve, Realized Master Zhang said no more. With a flip of his palm, he produced a jade slip.</p><p>Qin Sang accepted it and saw a map of a Demon Kingdom drawn within the jade slip. It was not particularly detailed, but some locations were marked in blood-red, very conspicuous.</p><p>“We call this Demon Kingdom the Thunder Eagle Demon Kingdom. The Demon King is a Golden-winged Thunder Eagle.  The locations marked on the map are the fiefdoms of the Demon King’s direct descendants. We hope Fellow Daoist can bring back the original lifeblood of the Thunder Eagle Demon Kingdom’s royal family…”</p><p>Realized Master Zhang explained.</p><p>Qin Sang imprinted the map in his mind, pondering, “Must it be from a Demon Commander level royal?”</p><p>“Not necessarily.  As long as it is a descendant of the royal family, and a sufficient amount of original lifeblood is collected, it will suffice. However, Fellow Daoist must not lower your guard.  Those who can be designated as royalty possess potent bloodline power, and the Demon King values them greatly.  They are never short of powerful guards. Moreover…”</p><p>Realized Master Zhang paused. "Fellow Daoist has arrived a little late.  Two other Fellow Daoists have already departed.  It would be best for Fellow Daoist to set off as soon as possible."</p><p>“Does Realized Master mean that the three of us are competing for one spot?”</p><p>Seeing Realized Master Zhang nod, Qin Sang couldn’t help but frown.</p><p>This task was not difficult for him to complete with his strength, but he was afraid that someone else would beat him to it.</p><p>Since that was the case, Qin Sang didn't hesitate any longer and immediately took his leave of Realized Master Zhang and left the city.</p><p>This city was located southeast of the Star Island Immortal Lake, bordering several Demon Kingdom territories.</p><p>Although they were all under the jurisdiction of Mount Ju, there was no harmony between the human race and the demon race, and conflicts between them were frequent.</p><p>Flying eastward for less than three days, Qin Sang arrived within the territory of the Thunder Eagle Demon Kingdom. He had memorized the map and had a preliminary plan based on the locations of the royal fiefdoms.</p><p>…</p><p>More than ten days later.</p><p>Qin Sang reappeared at the border of the Thunder Eagle Demon Kingdom, taking out a jade bottle.</p><p>The jade bottle was filled with golden lifeblood, glittering brilliantly in the sunlight.  It was indeed the lifeblood of the Golden-winged Thunder Eagle royal family.</p><p>The Demon King of the Thunder Eagle Demon Kingdom was only at the late stage of Form Transformation. If Qin Sang went all out, the entire Demon Kingdom wouldn't be able to stop him.</p><p>However, Qin Sang didn't want to cause too much commotion and attract suspicion. If it weren't for the worry of being preempted, he would have waited longer.</p><p>After patiently investigating for several days, he learned that several royal descendants were traveling together.  He seized the opportunity and collected all the lifeblood in one fell swoop.</p><p>Those royal descendants were guarded by Form Transformation stage Great Demons, but how could they detect Qin Sang's presence?  He acted without a trace, rendering the young demons unconscious and collecting their blood.</p><p>…</p><p>“This…”</p><p>Realized Master Zhang took the glittering bottle full of lifeblood, looking at Qin Sang with surprise.</p><p>“It is indeed royal lifeblood. I didn't expect Fellow Daoist to be so swift!”</p><p>Cultivators infiltrating the Demon Kingdom would certainly be cautious and plan their escape routes before acting. He had expected it to take at least a month or two.</p><p>Qin Sang laughed heartily.  “It was also this humble Daoist’s luck. I encountered a few young demons on an outing. This humble Daoist happens to be proficient in concealment techniques. Although the young demons’ guards were powerful, their spiritual senses were not sharp enough, allowing this humble Daoist to exploit a loophole, rendering them unconscious and collecting their blood.”</p><p>Realized Master Zhang suddenly understood. No wonder he hadn't received any reports of someone causing a disturbance in the Demon Kingdom.</p><p>“Please accept this Thunder Rune, Fellow Daoist. On the day of the investiture, your disciple may enter the mountain with this rune.”</p><p>Realized Master Zhang took out a shimmering silver talisman, resembling woven lightning threads.</p><p>Qin Sang accepted the Thunder Rune, expressed his thanks, and then returned to Star Island Immortal Lake, waiting patiently in the Island in the Pot.</p><p>During this period, Qin Sang frequently visited Grandmaster Qi, receiving his guidance, and his understanding of the Dao of Artifact Refinement deepened day by day.</p><p>What delighted him most was that some of this experience could be applied to nurturing the Cloud Wanderer Sword. With his broadened horizons, Qin Sang gained a certain degree of control over the state of the Cloud Wanderer Sword, unlike the previous ignorance.</p><p>If his judgment was correct, within this century, the Cloud Wanderer Sword should give birth to a spirit embryo, ascending to become a spiritual treasure in one fell swoop!</p><p>The reason for estimating a hundred-year timeframe was that Qin Sang's mastery was still insufficient, and it might happen sooner.</p><p>Under normal circumstances, refining a spiritual treasure would require far more than a few centuries.</p><p>After all, Qin Sang had only recently broken through to the Nascent Soul stage.</p><p>The speed at which the Cloud Wanderer Sword, his natal magic treasure, was nurtured was also related to his cultivation level.</p><p>Refining a spiritual treasure required favorable timing, location, and people, a combination of various conditions for the birth of a spirit embryo.</p><p>However, the Cloud Wanderer Sword, infused with Cloud Wanderer’s True Spirit, would naturally find it easier to give birth to a spirit embryo than starting from scratch. If Qin Sang hadn’t been worried about damaging Cloud Wanderer’s fragile True Spirit, the process might have been even faster.</p><p>Furthermore, the Cloud Wanderer Sword's body was forged with the Soul Nurturing Wood, one of the Ten Great Divine Woods, and Qin Sang constantly refined it with the 《Sacrificial Offering Technique》, finally seeing a glimmer of hope!</p><p>Confirming this, Qin Sang was overjoyed.</p><p>Transforming into a spirit embryo, with a stable True Spirit, he would no longer need to worry when wielding the spirit sword against enemies.</p><p>Moreover, the Cloud Wanderer Sword would directly transform into a spiritual treasure. As his natal spirit sword, no other spiritual treasure could match its compatibility with him.</p><p>Of course, to unleash the full power of the spirit sword, he needed to recover his cultivation as quickly as possible.</p><p>Subsequently, Qin Sang remained at Grandmaster Qi's residence, even reducing his outings, continuously employing the 《Sacrificial Offering Technique》 within his cave dwelling to refine the Cloud Wanderer Sword. He only ventured out once, on the day of the auction held by the Mount Ju Assembly.</p><p>As the attendant had described, the treasures at the auction were either exchanged through barter or traded using Daoist Order merits.</p><p>"Returning Wind Armor."</p><p>Qin Sang's heart stirred. A set of azure armor materialized on his body, covering him completely, even his face.</p><p>This armor was something he had exchanged for at the auction, belonging to the highest grade of magic treasures.</p><p>Qin Sang naturally longed for a set of armor comparable to a pseudo-spiritual treasure, even considering refining one himself.  However, after consulting with Grandmaster Qi and considering his current resources, he temporarily abandoned the idea.</p><p>In addition to this, there was an unexpected delight at the auction.</p><p>Qin Sang obtained materials for two types of Imperial Bell True Runes in one go. Now, he only lacked the Earthly Blood Sand.</p><p>Several months passed in the blink of an eye.</p><p>In a certain area of water in the eastern part of Star Island Immortal Lake, thousands of islands formed a cluster. Cultivators passing through this region would rather choose a detour, taking several extra days, than dare to trespass.</p><p>Because this was where the mountain gate of the Star Island Immortal Lake's top sect, the Thunderclap Left Mansion, was located!</p><p>Three days later, the Thunderclap Left Mansion would commence its investiture ceremony.</p><p>Starting a few days prior, the subordinate sects of the Thunderclap Left Mansion began sending their newly initiated disciples.</p><p>Each investiture ritual was also a rare grand occasion.</p><p>On the largest island in the outer periphery, a jade stele inscribed with ‘Thunderclap Left Mansion’ stood tall.</p><p>The area before the jade stele was bustling with people, with streams of light constantly flying in and out.</p><p>This island was the Welcoming Island, where disciples about to undergo the investiture waited.</p><p>Unnoticed, Qin Sang disembarked alone from a treasure ship.  After discerning his bearings, he walked towards a pavilion beside the jade stele.</p><p>“Which subordinate sect are you from? Why didn't your sect elders come?” A female cultivator frowned at Qin Sang.</p><p>“My master has other important matters. This junior came alone.”</p><p>Qin Sang behaved respectfully, presenting the Thunder Rune.</p><p>The female cultivator, upon seeing the Thunder Rune, glanced at Qin Sang with surprise and handed him a token.  “Take this token to the other side of Welcoming Island and choose a room in the Jia-character designated dwelling.  Someone will come for you in three days. Oh? I forgot you haven't started cultivating yet.  I'll have someone take you there…”</p><p>A disciple of the Thunderclap Left Mansion led Qin Sang to the dwelling and settled him in.</p><p>Three days later.</p><p>The restrictive formation outside the door was triggered.</p><p>Qin Sang pushed the door open and saw a handsome youth with a sword at his waist smiling at him. “Little brother, are you participating in the investiture ritual? Come with me.”</p><p>The handsome youth gathered a few more people and they boarded a flying boat together, soaring through the air towards the depths of the archipelago.</p><p>The flying boat travelled amidst the clouds.</p><p>Before long, dark clouds gathered ahead, and the sound of thunder rumbled incessantly.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>The flying boat plunged into the depths of the dark clouds, suddenly descending rapidly, landing on a gloomy island.
