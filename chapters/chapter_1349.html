<h1>Chapter 1341: Blood Infants</h1><p>Qin Sang suppressed his urge to ask about Bai's whereabouts and patiently listened as Daoist Zhenyi continued.</p><p>Bai had managed to break the Corpse Seal, but the seal's essence still lingered within his body. As long as neither of them deliberately concealed themselves, they could sense each other within a certain range through the Corpse Seal. However, despite Qin Sang having been in the ghostly mist for so long, Bai had shown no reaction. Could it be that the ghostly mist was capable of blocking even the Corpse Seal's perception?</p><p>"Unexpectedly, before we could get close to the altar, the Old Demon Ye suddenly attacked. He took advantage of the ghostly mist's eruption. Although we were prepared, we were still forcibly scattered and didn't have time to set up a formation. I was unlucky enough to be separated, and my perception was severely limited. Moreover, the closer we got to the blood-colored altar, the greater the interference and resistance became. For safety's sake, I had to retreat a distance and regroup with a few fellow Daoists. Just as we were about to turn back, you arrived, Fellow Daoist Qin..."</p><p>Daoist Zhenyi briefly recounted the events.</p><p>"With Fellow Daoist Qin here, I feel much more at ease. Let's quickly regroup with the others. The Old Demon Ye and the demon are currently on the blood-colored altar, and we don't know what they're doing. If there's another demon sealed inside, things could get troublesome."</p><p>Qin Sang now had a rough understanding of the situation. His Heavenly Eye technique was less restricted here, so finding his senior sister and the others shouldn't be too difficult.</p><p>He glanced at the surrounding ghostly mist and blood clouds. "What are these things? Were they originally part of the Immortal Tomb, or are they the work of the Old Demon Ye?"</p><p>A nearby Nascent Soul cultivator chimed in, "Fellow Daoist Qin, do you remember the Nascent Souls that the Old Demon Ye captured? I vaguely saw that those Nascent Souls were refined into Blood Infants using the Nether Crystal Tower's crystal orbs. The Old Demon Ye then used them to set up some kind of sinister formation. The limited perception, the pervasive blood clouds, and the controlled ghosts—all of these are likely influenced by the sinister formation."</p><p>Qin Sang glanced sideways, recalling that this person's surname was Guan, and he hailed from the Great Desert of the North Star.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Guan is skilled in the Thousand-Foot Pupil technique," Daoist Zhenyi added, concerned that Qin Sang might not be familiar with him.</p><p>The Guan cultivator modestly said, "My Thousand-Foot Pupil technique requires condensing the power of the spiritual eye into a fine needle, allowing it to instantly traverse space and barriers to see objects beyond normal vision. However, it consumes a great deal of energy, and each use causes intense pain in my eyes, requiring a period of rest afterward. I've heard that Fellow Daoist Qin's spiritual eye technique is also extraordinary. I wonder when I might have the honor of exchanging insights with you?"</p><p>"I would be delighted. After this matter is settled, you are welcome to visit the Illusory Mist Sect at any time," Qin Sang replied warmly. After a moment of thought, he added, "So, the Old Demon Ye deceived the Sin Abyss, stole the crystal orbs and Nascent Souls, all to set up this sinister formation. Fellow Daoist Guan, did you happen to see the Jade Bone Brocade Skin or the demon that the Old Demon Ye released?"</p><p>"The Jade Bone Brocade Skin is suspended on the other side of the blood-colored altar, standing alongside the Old Demon Ye. But it remains completely motionless, and it's unclear whether it's alive or what its relationship with the Old Demon Ye is," the Guan cultivator replied.</p><p>Daoist Zhenyi glanced in the direction of the blood-colored altar. "Our best course of action now is to regroup with the others as quickly as possible. The longer we delay, the more likely it is that something unexpected will happen."</p><p>Qin Sang agreed and took the lead without hesitation. "I'll take the front, and Daoist Zhenyi can guard the rear."</p><p>"Agreed!"</p><p>The group quickly rearranged their formation, with Qin Sang and the Nascent Soul puppet taking the lead, while Daoist Zhenyi brought up the rear.</p><p>As Daoist Zhenyi had said, the closer they got to the altar, the greater the resistance became. The blood clouds thickened, and the Nascent Soul puppet charged ahead, carving a path through the mist.</p><p>Qin Sang followed closely behind the puppet, his Ebony Sword hovering inverted above his head. The sword's hum was constant, and streaks of sword light continuously shot forward, each one cutting down swathes of ghostly creatures. However, the cleared space was immediately filled again as the ghosts surged forward relentlessly, unafraid of death. Among them were even Golden Core-level entities.</p><p>The group couldn't help but feel as though they had stumbled into hell itself.</p><p>The others also didn't hold back, either summoning their magical treasures or casting spells to clear the way. Daoist Zhenyi's horsetail whisk was almost invisible, transformed into a rain of white light.</p><p>With Qin Sang's addition, their progress became significantly faster.</p><p>As they advanced, Qin Sang didn't forget to have the Heavenly Eye Butterfly continuously use its abilities, scanning for any anomalies in the surroundings, trying to discern the patterns of the sinister formation.</p><p>After pressing forward for a while, the Heavenly Eye Butterfly finally detected traces of another group. Just as Qin Sang was about to change direction to join them, the butterfly suddenly sent him a warning.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes flickered, and he casually glanced toward an area outside the blood clouds. To the naked eye, it looked no different from the rest of the ghostly mist. But in the Heavenly Eye Butterfly's vision, a blood shadow was lurking there!</p><p>Recalling what the Guan cultivator had said about the Blood Infant formation, Qin Sang's heart stirred. He subtly communicated with the others, pretending to wander aimlessly while trying to approach the blood shadow.</p><p>However, after several attempts, he failed. The blood shadow seemed to possess intelligence, flickering to a different location each time they got close, proving to be quite cunning.</p><p>Still, during this game of cat and mouse, Qin Sang wasn't without gains. He made a new discovery: there wasn't just one blood shadow!</p><p>These three blood shadows were intricately connected to the blood clouds. Without a doubt, the blood shadows were the Blood Infants, and the blood clouds and ghostly creatures were under their control, attacking the group.</p><p>The number of Nascent Souls the Old Demon Ye had captured was limited. Each one they eliminated would weaken the sinister formation. If they could capture the blood shadows, it might help in breaking the formation.</p><p>Not wanting to miss this opportunity, Qin Sang secretly discussed with Daoist Zhenyi and decided to make a move.</p><p>After maneuvering for a while longer and observing the Blood Infants' movements, Qin Sang grew concerned that the Old Demon Ye, who was controlling the formation, might see through their plan. He decided not to wait any longer.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The Nascent Soul puppet suddenly changed direction, smashing through a cluster of blood clouds.</p><p>At the same time, all the magical treasures, without any warning, turned in unison. In an instant, a dazzling array of lights erupted—a horsetail whisk transformed into a rain of light, golden blade rays, a small seal engraved with ancient characters...</p><p>The Nascent Soul puppet charged forward with ferocious determination, working in tandem with the treasures to clear a path for Qin Sang.</p><p>In the next moment, a bolt of lightning tore through the void.</p><p>Qin Sang's Phoenix Wings unfurled, and he combined Thunder Evasion with Sword Evasion, reaching an unparalleled speed. Like a meteor streaking through the darkness, he shone brilliantly and strikingly within the pitch-black ghostly mist!</p><p>His target was a seemingly empty space.</p><p>An ear-piercing shriek rang out.</p><p>The Blood Infant hiding there sensed the danger and finally emerged from the void.</p><p>Seeing their appearance, Qin Sang couldn't help but feel a chill in his heart.</p><p>These Blood Infants were refined from Nascent Souls, about the same size as a Nascent Soul. Their facial features were still intact, but their bodies were transparent, fused with the crystal orbs. Their minds were completely lost, turning them into terrifying monsters.</p><p>They opened their tiny mouths, shrieking at Qin Sang in warning.</p><p>Surprisingly, however, the Blood Infants didn't attempt to counterattack. Instead, as they shrieked, they transformed into streaks of blood light and fled at astonishing speed.</p><p>(To be continued...)</p>
