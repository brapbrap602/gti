<h1>Chapter 1910:  Grand Elder Guan</h1><p>Tian Liang Mountain, Yu Daozi.</p><p>Qin Sang learned a new name.</p><p>“Does Yu Daozi know about the Yin family’s collusion with the Thirteen Hawks of the Northern Desert?” Qin Sang asked.</p><p>The head of the Yin family suddenly went blank.</p><p>“I am only a registered disciple of my master.  After breaking through to the Golden Core stage, I was sent down the mountain to manage the Yin family in Sihuo Town. I rarely see my master. While the Thirteen Hawks of the Northern Desert have some connection to my family, it was actually orchestrated by Senior Brother Huang…”</p><p>“Senior Brother Huang, originally my master’s third disciple and a Yuan Ying cultivator, was expelled for unknown reasons and became a disgraced disciple. He then joined the Ming Mountain, one of the Three Mountain Bandit Strongholds…”</p><p>“My master has countless registered disciples. Not only our Yin family, but families across the desert send their offspring to Tian Liang Mountain, many of whom become registered disciples…”</p><p>“These registered disciples maintain contact with Senior Brother Huang after leaving the mountain.  He ordered us to secretly recruit sand bandits, and occasionally Ming Mountain sends orders, instructing us to carry out tasks and relay messages…”</p><p>“If we succeed, we get at least 30% of the spoils…”</p><p>The Yin family head, sitting upright in his high chair, spoke frankly and revealed the secrets, as if reporting to a superior.</p><p>He described acts of murder, arson, and plunder, yet his tone and demeanor were unnervingly calm.</p><p>Gu Family Head, witnessing this strange scene, remained stiff, unable to move, his forehead throbbing, his body drenched in cold sweat.</p><p>“Another Three Mountain Bandit Stronghold. Looks like we'll have to visit them all,” Qin Sang shook her head and turned to Gu Family Head.</p><p>“Are you also a registered disciple of Yu Daozi?”</p><p>Meeting Qin Sang's gaze, Gu Family Head’s heart skipped a beat. He swallowed nervously.</p><p>‘Gulp!’</p><p>The sound echoed uncomfortably in the hall. He wanted to slap himself.  He cautiously said, “Senior, please understand, my Gu family has absolutely no connection with Tian Liang Mountain or the Three Mountain Bandit Strongholds. I never imagined the Yin family would dare to harbor sand bandits and murder innocent people…”</p><p>Under Qin Sang’s amused gaze, Gu Family Head found himself unable to continue, finally giving a wry smile.</p><p>“If I say I knew nothing, Senior wouldn't believe me.  While the Yin family always stayed in the shadows, traces were inevitably left. I had long suspected something. However, the Gu family’s position as ruler of Sihuo Town depends on Hunye City, and Hunye City is no match for Tian Liang Mountain. I could only secretly restrain the Yin family, preventing them from being too blatant…</p><p>“To be honest, Senior, I only just learned of the Yin family's connection to the Three Mountain Bandit Stronghold.</p><p>“Fortunately, Tian Liang Mountain considers itself righteous, and the Three Mountain Bandit Stronghold also has its concerns, thus maintaining a fragile balance. If I confronted the Yin family directly, the Gu family would likely be overrun by sand bandits the next day…”</p><p>Gu Family Head lamented, venting his anxiety and fear.</p><p>He rambled on without receiving a reply, only then realizing that the two had vanished.</p><p>Turning his head, he saw the Yin family head already dead.</p><p>“Hiss…”</p><p>Gu Family Head rushed out of the hall.  All the Yin family guards lay on the ground, seemingly asleep, silently deceased.</p><p>Sounds of conversation still came from within the Yin Mansion.</p><p>Some were dead, some were alive.</p><p>“They weren’t wiped out?”</p><p>Gu Family Head was puzzled, unable to fathom the mysterious person's intentions. He quickly returned to the Gu family, immediately ordering all family members to return home and forbidding them from going out, secretly sending people to investigate.</p><p>Soon, a report came.</p><p>“How is the Gou family?” Gu Family Head asked anxiously.</p><p>“The second and third branches, close to the Yin family, suffered heavy casualties; many even died in their own rooms.  The entire Gou Mansion is in chaos, and the news has spread throughout the city…”</p><p>“Karma… karma… Could it be that there really is a judgment in this world?”</p><p>People often say that the gods watch from above.</p><p>But cultivators know that divine power is weak, and such talk is only prevalent among the common people in the south and is not taken seriously by cultivators.</p><p>It is said that mountain gods and local deities also possess power, but their numbers and influence are no match for cultivators; the dominant force in this region is the Yun Du Heavenly cultivation sect.</p><p>Gu Family Head dismissed his subordinates, collapsing into his chair, staring blankly at the ornate ceiling.</p><p>After a long time.</p><p>A faint sigh echoed in the room.</p><p>“When people commit too many evil deeds… they'll eventually face retribution.”</p><p>…</p><p>A chilling wind blew.</p><p>The sky was grey.</p><p>The grey mist was actually swirling sand.</p><p>For hundreds of miles around, the soil was grey.  Once the wind picked up, even during the day, the sky was dark and gloomy, creating a sinister atmosphere.</p><p>Below the wind and sand, majestic mountains stretched like giant dragons across the earth.</p><p>The mountains exuded a sinister aura, like a man-eating beast, deterring anyone who dared to approach.</p><p>Several figures appeared at the foot of the mountain, slowly walking towards the range.</p><p>“This is Ming Mountain.”</p><p>Qin Sang had already dealt with numerous bandits along the way, yet he carried no trace of bloodlust.  He had gained a deeper understanding of the Three Mountain Bandit Strongholds.</p><p>These strongholds – Ming Mountain, Luomeng Mountain, and Ji Mountain – were reputedly the lairs of the three most powerful bandit groups in the northern deserts, and the headquarters for their alliances.  Interconnected, each mountain was protected by a Yuan Ying master. Though originating as bandits, they had become three immensely powerful and unpredictable forces, feared even by the northern desert's cultivation sects.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at the mountain range and headed towards the main peak. They didn't attempt to conceal their presence; upon entering Ming Mountain, they were immediately detected.</p><p>"State your name!"</p><p>A towering pillar of fire erupted from the summit, accompanied by a thunderous roar.  In the firelight, several shadowy figures appeared, their auras sharp and their voices filled with killing intent.</p><p>Before they could finish, their words were cut short by a clap of thunder.</p><p>"Rumble…"</p><p>The sky rumbled.  In an instant, dark clouds gathered, plunging the already dusky Ming Mountain, obscured by sandstorms, into near total darkness.</p><p>"Crack!"</p><p>A lightning bolt descended from the heavens, striking the pillar of fire.  Amidst screams, the flames extinguished. The figures beneath, though not struck by lightning, were involuntarily flung into the air.</p><p>"I have plundered nine times…"</p><p>"I followed the mountain lord in slaughtering three sects…"</p><p>"I seized women as concubines, killing their families if they resisted…"</p><p>…</p><p>Under the watchful eyes of all, several figures confessed their crimes, their voices echoing across Ming Mountain.  Upon completion of their confessions, heavenly thunder descended, instantly obliterating them, their blood painting their confessions onto the ground.</p><p>"Rumble!"</p><p>The thunder echoed throughout Ming Mountain.</p><p>Qin Sang seemed to stroll through the mountains, yet his speed was unimpeded.  At each peak, a similar scene unfolded.</p><p>"Boom! Boom! Boom!"</p><p>Lightning rained down, one strike after another.  The scene resembled divine retribution.</p><p>The thunderclouds and lightning followed Qin Sang's movements. Qin Sang appeared like a god, though to the mountain dwellers, a terrifying demon.</p><p>Under the lightning, Ming Mountain was lit as bright as day, revealing faces contorted in terror.  In Ming Mountain, who had clean hands? For a time, Ming Mountain was filled with fear.</p><p>On Ming Mountain's main peak, the summit shimmered with gold and splendor, with figures constantly appearing and disappearing, among them powerful Yuan Ying cultivators.</p><p>The leader was a refined man in scholar's robes and a feathered fan – the Yellow Brother mentioned by the Yin family head, Huang Daoxun. His composure was gone, replaced by furious anger.</p><p>"Who is he?! Which blind fool provoked such a formidable enemy?!"</p><p>His furious roar echoed across the peak.  Everyone remained silent, unable to provide an answer.</p><p>An elderly man in black robes beside him spoke, "Earlier, there were reports of several bandit groups in the north mysteriously wiped out. It's likely this person's doing. I was planning to investigate, but he dared to attack Ming Mountain.  This person's strength is unfathomable. Perhaps someone accidentally injured his kin. Mountain Lord, calm yourself. Let's find out, hand him over…"</p><p>Huang Daoxun took a deep breath, steadying his nerves, and shouted, "Activate the Youtian Nine Formation!"</p><p>He then, along with the elder in black robes and others, flew towards the front mountain.</p><p>…</p><p>"The Daoist lightning techniques are indeed extraordinary. Using the Jade Pure Summoning Lightning Talisman to channel low-level High Shang Xiao lightning; I thought I had already mastered it, yet there are still so many variations…"</p><p>Qin Sang rode into the mountains, accompanied by heavenly thunder. He didn't even glance at the bandits struck by lightning; instead, he focused on understanding the lightning techniques.  He started with the most familiar talismans, those channeling three lightning paths, gradually comprehending the Five Thunder Courtyard's lightning arts.  In a short time, he made considerable progress.</p><p>At that moment, the ground shook violently.  Nine peaks surrounding the main peak erupted in a brilliant yellow-gold light, clearly activating the mountain protection formation.  Between the bursts of light, several figures flew towards him, weapons drawn, their faces filled with caution.</p><p>The leading Huang Daoxun bowed from afar, "I am Huang Daoxun, the lord of Ming Mountain. I don't know what offense I have committed, why…"</p><p>Before he could finish, Huang Daoxun saw Qin Sang look up, smiling warmly at him.  His heart inexplicably pounded violently.</p><p>Then, Huang Daoxun witnessed a sight he would never forget.</p><p>The seemingly harmless child on the horse raised her right hand, extending a finger.  A slender beam of five-colored light shot out, as thin as the child's finger.</p><p>The light was silent.</p><p>Struck by the light, one of the peaks forming the base of the Youtian Nine Formation, exploded.  A mountain peak, right beside them, simply vanished.  In their minds, the supposedly indestructible Youtian Nine Formation was as if it didn't exist.</p><p>"Good girl,"</p><p>Qin Sang gently patted Xiao Wu's hand.</p><p>He could have used thunder magic to break the formation, but his descent from the mountain was largely for Xiao Wu's sake; he wanted her to feel involved.  A gaping hole instantly appeared in the newly formed array.</p><p>Huang Dao Xun hadn't recovered from the shock when cries of confession rang out behind him, thunderclouds obscuring the main peak. Among the voices were those of Ming Mountain's Yuan Ying stage elders!</p><p>"My master is Yu Daozi, the Grand Elder of Tian Liang Mountain! You can't kill me!" Huang Dao Xun cried out in terror.</p><p>"So, your master supported your evil deeds in the lowlands?" Qin Sang asked.</p><p>"My master secretly ordered me down the mountain..." Huang Dao Xun's eyes glazed over as he spoke, slowly rising into the air before perishing under the heavenly thunder.</p><p>When the dark clouds dispersed and the thunder subsided, Ming Mountain was eerily silent, with a few survivors fleeing in panic.</p><p>…</p><p>Tian Liang Mountain was a highly respected sect throughout the Fire Domain and the desert.  While it lacked Nascent Soul cultivators, its Grand Elder and Sect Master were both powerful late-stage Yuan Ying cultivators.  Unlike the demon-ridden Mulu Mountain Range, the Fire Domain, connected to Yun Du Mountain, had established forces that, while powerful, generally acted honorably. Tian Liang Mountain enjoyed a good reputation.</p><p>One day, two uninvited guests arrived at Tian Liang Mountain.</p><p>Inside the guest hall, Tian Liang Mountain's Sect Master, a rare sight, personally greeted them.  However, the atmosphere was tense.</p><p>"Are you jesting, friend?  It's preposterous to suggest that Tian Liang Mountain's Grand Elder would collude with bandits! Who dares to slander us?!" The Sect Master slammed his fist on the table.</p><p>The Daoist and the young girl across from him remained unmoved.</p><p>"Indeed a renowned sect. These spirit fruits are excellent. Xiao Wu, try one…" Qin Sang handed Xiao Wu a fruit, then addressed the Sect Master. "Whether it's slander or not can be easily verified by confronting your Grand Elder. Hiding in seclusion won't wash away your sins."</p><p>His last sentence, booming like thunder, echoed out of the hall, shaking the entire sect.</p><p>"Audacious!"</p><p>The Sect Master's face turned pale, then froze.  Eastern lightning blazed across the sky, descending like a dragon towards a spiritual peak.  Tian Liang Mountain's protective array didn't even have time to react.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The mountaintop exploded, accompanied by a terrifying roar. A distorted figure burst out, shimmering with lightning, bound by chains, its limbs splayed as if hanging in mid-air. A lightning whip spell directly seized Yu Daozi from his secluded chamber.</p><p>All the disciples of Tian Liang Mountain witnessed their revered Grand Elder, helpless, being dragged towards the guest hall.</p><p>"Y-y-you…" The Sect Master pointed at Qin Sang, trembling with rage and fear.</p><p>"Who are you?! If you kill me, my ancestor will avenge me! Ancestor, save me!" Yu Daozi, brought before the hall, struggled wildly, screaming like a madman.</p><p>Hearing the screams, the Sect Master was stunned. If Tian Liang Mountain had such a powerful ancestor, how could someone act so brazenly within the sect?</p><p>"You have someone above you?"</p><p>Qin Sang chuckled wryly.  Others would go after the superiors after dealing with inferiors, but he'd killed the subordinate and was now going for the superior. Judging by the Sect Master's expression, a conspiracy seemed to shroud Tian Liang Mountain, and even the cultivation world, a conspiracy Qin Sang had inadvertently disrupted.</p><p>"Grandmaster Guan is a powerful cultivator from an outside realm, hidden in the Fire Origin Valley.  I, on his orders, secretly sent disciples down the mountain to cultivate power, gather various blood medicines and sacrificial vessels for him.  When the time is right, I was to replace the Sect Master…"</p><p>Yu Daozi suddenly stopped struggling, willingly recounting his plans.  As he spoke, his expression became increasingly contorted.  Even as a late-stage Yuan Ying cultivator, he couldn't escape Qin Sang's control.</p><p>Tian Liang Mountain was in an uproar.  The Sect Master regained his composure, watching the disgraced Yu Daozi without a word.</p><p>'Bang!'</p><p>The Grand Elder's body suddenly exploded, leaving behind a confession written in blood on the mountain wall, much like the bandits. The crimes were numerous and heinous.</p><p>Before anyone knew it, Qin Sang and Xiao Wu had vanished. The Sect Master remained motionless for a long time.</p><p>…</p><p>Leaving Tian Liang Mountain, Qin Sang abruptly accelerated, flying straight towards Fire Origin Valley.</p><p>As he sped across the wind, Qin Sang pondered. He had slain countless evildoers on his journey, yet it seemed to have little effect on his comprehension.</p><p>"Did I misunderstand the sword spirit's meaning? Or are these opponents too weak?  Do evildoers also have different levels of strength? Grandmaster Guan, a mid-stage Nascent Soul cultivator, is a formidable opponent, perfect for testing my theories…"</p><p>Qin Sang mused, soon spotting the fiery valley.</p>
