<h1>Chapter 1825: Sword Breaks Spiritual Insight</h1><p>A woman in a green skirt was leading demonic soldiers in collecting the Five Elements Crown, her back to the palace gate, completely unguarded.  Here, they only had Xia Hou as an enemy. Xia Hou, to break through, first needed to overcome the demonic fox's magical barrier and then the Green Fox Saint King.  They were solely focused on Xia Hou, never expecting an uninvited guest.</p><p>Furthermore, retrieving the Five Elements Crown was difficult; it could easily trigger a backlash from the spirit within. The woman in green had to fully concentrate on controlling the demonic array, and her attention relaxed slightly as she was about to succeed.</p><p>Just then, venomous snakes, carrying boundless cold air, arrived!</p><p>Four venomous snakes writhed, their icy breath filling the palace. The palace interior became a blinding white, as if frozen solid.  Nine Netherworld flames manifested as a line of fire, arriving simultaneously with the cold air.</p><p>The venomous snakes above, the Nine Netherworld flames below, ignored Xia Hou and the Green Fox Saint King, heading straight for the woman in green.  The two attacks were incredibly fast, but another light was even faster.</p><p>It was a bolt of lightning, its speed beyond normal comprehension.</p><p>Seeing the venomous snakes and flames, the Green Fox Saint King was startled.  The four venomous snake seals and the Nine Netherworld flames stirred distant memories. After the battle at the Wuxiang Immortal Sect, she had thoroughly investigated Qin Sang's background.</p><p>The magical treasures and abilities were too similar to be a coincidence!</p><p>When the lightning entered her sight, her expression completely changed.  She had never seen anyone move so fast.  Even Xia Hou couldn't match this speed!</p><p>With his breakthrough in the *Sky Demon Transformation* and the evolution of his Green Luan divine form, Qin Sang, if he fully unleashed the Green Luan's innate lightning power and used lightning escape, could rank among the top cultivators among late-stage Nascent Soul experts from both races.</p><p>The instant the lightning appeared, it approached the demonic array. As it neared, the electric light scattered, revealing a strange figure.</p><p>This person was covered in green fur, his body emitting poisonous gas. Through the gaps in the fur, rough skin like tree bark was visible, like a humanoid monster or an old tree covered in moss, yet he had a pair of exquisitely beautiful phoenix wings on his back.</p><p>The wings weren't fully spread; the lightning escape was merely a single flap of the wings!</p><p>Qin Sang stared at the woman's back, his body unhesitating, and charged into the demonic array with his bare body!</p><p>He arrived before the two demons, having been alerted by Mo Xingdao about the anomaly with the Five Elements Crown. He guessed at the Green Fox Saint King's plan, withdrew from the palace, and waited outside, rested and prepared.</p><p>He had planned to let the two demons fight, reaping the rewards when they were both weakened.  But Xia Hou was incredibly skilled, instantly turning the tide, and the Green Fox Saint King reacted decisively, immediately stopping.</p><p>Seeing the Green Fox Saint King gaining the upper hand, and about to take the Five Elements Crown, with Xia Hou still trapped, it was uncertain whether he could stop her, so Qin Sang had to act.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>Qin Sang, like a human beast, his blood surging, crashed into the array like a heavy hammer. This impact contained not only the power of his Wood Spirit body but also the might of the Buddha seal.</p><p>Instantly, the demonic altar shook violently. Demonic soldiers tumbled forward, spitting blood and screaming. The fine net encasing the Five Elements Crown burst.</p><p>The demonic soldiers, warned by the woman in green about the Crown's power, remained vigilant, but they never expected an attack from behind, and such a sudden one.</p><p>*Crack!*</p><p>A thunderclap echoed through the palace, deafening. The demonic array was in chaos.</p><p>The venomous snakes arrived! Four venomous snakes surged above the array, their eight menacing eyes locked on the woman in green.</p><p>*Roar!*</p><p>The venomous snakes roared in unison, opening their gaping maws.  Dazzling blue light burst forth. Four intensely condensed balls of icy flame, like four cold,幽蓝 suns, descended from the heavens, bringing boundless cold.</p><p>The four venomous snake seals were true magical treasures. Although Qin Sang didn't cultivate the ice path, hindering their power, they were far superior to ordinary imitation treasures.</p><p>In terms of inherent power, the Gray Warbler Sword was undoubtedly inferior to the four venomous snake seals, but Qin Sang didn't use them often as they were not as easy for him to wield.</p><p>The treasure's might was immediately apparent.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>In an instant, the area where the woman in green stood was engulfed in icy flames.  Amidst the blue, the flames flickered, making cracking sounds, as if trying to freeze the woman into an ice sculpture.  At that moment, the woman felt a terrifying chill.</p><p>A biting cold pierced through her, numbing her flesh and seemingly freezing her very soul.  The woman in the green dress hadn't even seen her attacker's face.</p><p>Escape!</p><p>That was her only thought.  The enemy was terrifying.  Only by fighting desperately could her benefactor have a chance to save her.</p><p>Her expression contorted.  Scales sprouted on her neck, glowing green as she struggled against the icy flames, fighting to break free.</p><p>But Qin Sang gave her no chance.  The Nine Netherworld Demon Fire followed the serpent-like attack, the flames like arrows, aimed at her back.  It pierced her as she fought the icy flames.</p><p>*Pff!*</p><p>Blood sprayed from the woman's mouth.  Her face turned pale, a searing pain ripping through her chest.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The demon fire erupted, engulfing her instantly. The demon fire and icy flames merged, consuming her.</p><p>Whether from the intense cold or the burning of her soul, she felt a moment of disorientation in the crisis.  She gritted her teeth, her body twisting like a snake, becoming strangely pliable.  Before she could react, she felt a hand clamp down on her neck.</p><p>Qin Sang had appeared behind her, his right arm plunged into the flames, his hand like a vise, gripping her neck.</p><p>*Crack!*</p><p>Bones shattered.  A destructive force surged into her body, extinguishing her life.</p><p>With a flash of light, the corpse in Qin Sang's hand transformed into a lifeless green serpent.</p><p>The Nine Netherworld Demon Fire, born from the Fire Lotus, was a technique of soul manipulation.  The power controlled the Four-fold Serpent Seal.  Combined with Qin Sang's physical strength, comparable to a mid-stage Divine Transformation cultivator, the combined might of soul, spiritual energy, and body swiftly killed the woman.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>A burst of demon fire exploded from the serpent's corpse, creating a sea of fire. The residual power was still devastating, killing countless demon soldiers. Even those shielded by formations were severely injured. Mo Xingdao, eyes burning with hatred, charged into the formations, slaughtering the survivors.</p><p>Qin Sang wouldn't waste time on them. He unleashed the remaining flames, leaving the remnants to Mo Xingdao, and turned to the Qinghu Saint King.</p><p>From his appearance to the serpent's death, it took less than a heartbeat.</p><p>The Qinghu Saint King instinctively tried to intervene, but before she could attack, she saw the serpent's corpse.  She met Qin Sang's gaze—a cold smile playing on his lips.  His eyes held no hatred or mockery, only indifference, as if looking at a corpse.</p><p>That image became fixed in her mind.</p><p>Darkness fell.</p><p>The Qinghu Saint King felt herself ripped from the palace.  The Five Elements Crown, the well platform, the palace—even the black dragon's roar, Xia Hou's battle cries, and the howling gales—all vanished.</p><p>Only an oppressive silence remained.  An endless loneliness descended.  Only starlight pierced the darkness. She felt pulled into the boundless void, adrift with no support.</p><p>"It's him!"</p><p>The Qinghu Saint King knew of the Seven Lunar Mansions Dividing Sword Formation, the famed array of the Wuxiang Immortal Sect.  On Emperor's Grant Mountain, she'd noticed Qin Sang's ease within the formation.  She’d searched the Jinxiang Palace's legacy for information about it, finding nothing.</p><p>He was here!  How did he achieve Divine Transformation? How did he reach this realm? When did he become involved with Mo Xingdao?</p><p>She didn't have time.  She knew her greatest crisis was at hand. She'd used almost all her power to deal with Xia Hou; her three Dharma Bodies were still engaged in the formation against him.</p><p>Her rise from ordinary fox to peak power was due to cunning, ruthlessness, sharp perception, and a masterful grasp of timing.  She recognized the cold precision of Qin Sang’s attack.</p><p>Qin Sang had instantly killed the serpent, disrupted the formations, eliminating her chance to use external forces, and trapped her in the sword array, preventing her from rejoining Xia Hou.</p><p>She was alone.</p><p>However, Xia Hou could break free in an instant.  The Qinghu Saint King didn't believe Qin Sang would abandon such a treasure, allowing Xia Hou to seize the Five Elements Crown, out of vengeance.</p><p>Mo Xingdao was nearly crippled, able only to slaughter demon soldiers; she lacked the strength to retrieve the Five Elements Crown.  However, she still had a chance!</p><p>The Qinghu Saint King's eyes flashed with ferocity.</p><p>Sword stars glittered across the sky.</p><p>All seven constellations burst forth with dazzling starlight, the leading star of each constellation shining particularly brightly.</p><p>The seven leading stars grew increasingly luminous, and ethereal figures emerged from the sword stars.</p><p>Seven figures, all of Qin Sang, his seven sword spirits, appeared.  They gazed at the Qinghu Saint King beneath the starry sky, their expressions somewhat vacant, but the boundless killing intent emanating from them was undeniable.</p><p>Seeing the seven sword spirits, the Qinghu Saint King's unease deepened.</p><p>Qin Sang's ability to independently deploy a complete sword array surprised her, but it wasn't the source of her anxiety.</p><p>The "Seven Constellations Division Sword Array" could seal off heaven and earth, functioning as a trapping formation.</p><p>If Qin Sang merely intended to trap her, he would have hidden the seven sword spirits within the sword stars, making it significantly more difficult to break the formation.</p><p>Instead, the seven sword spirits appeared openly.</p><p>Simultaneously, the seven sword spirits made a hand gesture, and all the sword stars erupted in brilliant starlight.</p><p>The Huiying Sword, hidden within the array, seemed to sense its master's killing intent, resonating with a ringing sound.</p><p>The night sky shone as bright as day!</p><p>Between the constellations, starlight coalesced, forming seven magnificent sword-like constellations, emitting an astonishing sword intent.</p><p>The sword intent locked onto the Qinghu Saint King, and stars suddenly fell.</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>The Qinghu Saint King's pupils constricted. In her eyes, the countless stars vanished, leaving only seven divine swords.</p><p>No, at the center of the seven divine swords, there was another sword!</p><p>This sword contained the power of the seven divine swords, forming the core of the entire array.  Endless starlight was drawn to this sword, emitting a earth-shattering tiger's roar.</p><p>In an instant, the starlight twisted, transforming into a white tiger, radiating unmatched ferocity, leaping down.</p><p>Simultaneously, a bolt of lightning, no less brilliant than the starlight, tore through the void and charged into the array.</p><p>Qin Sang, his green hair flowing, rapidly approached, his overwhelming aura and the white tiger's ferocity converging on the Qinghu Saint King, his killing intent unrestrained.</p><p>Her spirit shaken, the Qinghu Saint King hurriedly tossed a silver ring into the air.</p><p>A ring of light rose, transforming into a stream of light that met the white tiger's ferocity.  The moment it made contact, the ring suddenly expanded, encasing the white tiger.</p><p>The Qinghu Saint King rapidly formed hand seals, her breathing quickening, her face drained of color. The ring constricted, tightening around the white tiger's neck.</p><p>She was determined to stop the white tiger's assault at any cost.</p><p>Since Qin Sang intended to kill her, the sword array must have a weakness.  By withstanding this fatal blow and escaping the array, she might still have a chance of survival.</p><p>At the same time, the Qinghu Saint King transformed, revealing her true form as a fox.</p><p>The fox's size was similar to an ordinary fox, small and frail, inexplicably evoking a sense of pity.</p><p>She raised her fox head high, uttering unintelligible incantations, a white light appearing on her forehead.</p><p>Within the white light was a fox mark.</p><p>The mark detached from the fox and soared, resembling a full moon, clearly showing a demonic fox within.</p><p>The fox simultaneously released a ball of warm jade, soft as water, which merged with the moon and was immediately absorbed by the demonic fox within.</p><p>The demonic fox transformed into a blood fox, exuding astonishing ferocity.  With a single step, its body expanded, emitting a sharp cry, like a blood-red sword, it lunged toward Qin Sang.</p><p>Simultaneously, the fox's eyes fixed on Qin Sang, her alluring gaze filled with intense charm.</p><p>Her enchantment technique had failed against Qin Sang before, but that was when she used a physical manifestation.</p><p>Now, using her true form and holding nothing back, if she could enchant Qin Sang even for a moment, she could escape, or perhaps even reverse the situation!</p><p>However, Qin Sang's gaze remained indifferent, unmoved, unaffected.</p><p>The next moment, something even more shocking occurred.</p><p>As the blood fox approached, Qin Sang neither dodged nor evaded.  A faint, luminous light suddenly emanated from his body, clear and pure.</p><p>Under the light's glow, his green hair seemed translucent, transparent and pure as glass.</p><p>The Diamond Glass Body!</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes, like crystal, showed no fluctuation. His speed increased, he charged straight toward the blood fox, and raised his right arm, delivering a palm strike.</p><p>'Slap!'</p><p>It landed squarely on the blood fox's face.</p><p>A blinding light gathered in Qin Sang's palm, shimmering like water.  An overwhelmingly powerful force erupted, not a single seal, but a fusion of countless seals, transcending the limitations of any single technique.</p><p>Before Qing Hu's shocked eyes, Xue Hu let out a piercing shriek.  Its ferocious aura was utterly suppressed by a far greater power; it couldn't even pierce Qin Sang's palm, exploding into a bloody mist with a deafening roar. Qin Sang emerged from the dissipating blood.</p><p>Lightning flashed, instantly closing in.</p><p>For the first time, Qing Hu’s expression turned to utter terror.  Its fur bristled, and strange threads connected to form a protective armor, a final desperate defense.</p><p>Then came another simple palm strike.</p><p>Qing Hu's armor shattered.  It spat blood and flew back, its footing unsteady. Suddenly, an overwhelming killing intent descended, sending a shock through its heart.</p><p>Unseen until now, the Hui Ying sword appeared above Qing Hu's head, seven sword spirits forming a Seven Souls Killing Formation.</p><p>In an instant, the sword struck!</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>The sword light crisscrossed, the killing intent sky-high.  Shattered armor fluttered like fallen leaves, blood sprayed everywhere. Qing Hu's eyes glazed over; a horrific wound, nearly piercing its entire body, sent it crashing to the ground.</p><p>Outside the palace.</p><p>Amidst the turmoil, a faint blue light flickered, revealing a spectral Qing Hu—Qing Hu Sheng Wang.  Even facing near-death, even in her extreme weakness, her eyes remained resolute. She turned to flee without hesitation. But a sword energy, appearing from nowhere, exploded with devastating force on her brow.</p><p>Instantaneously, she froze, life extinguished.</p><p>Inside the palace.</p><p>Qin Sang slowly turned, his gaze cold as he looked towards the palace exterior.</p><p>This sword technique, he had mastered from the Cheng Ying sword. Within a certain range, it locks onto the spiritual energy of those harboring murderous intent.  Those targeted by the sword's will, regardless of any escape techniques or illusions, could not evade it unless they escaped his perception instantly.</p><p>He knew Qing Hu Sheng Wang. Given even a sliver of hope, she would cling to it. Similarly, faced with certain death, she would self-destruct, taking a piece of her enemy with her.</p><p>With a strong enemy remaining, Qin Sang needed a swift victory, avoiding mutual destruction.</p><p>Therefore, Qin Sang deliberately left a flaw in the Seven Souls Killing Formation.</p><p>The path to life, was also the path to death!</p><p>(End)</p>
