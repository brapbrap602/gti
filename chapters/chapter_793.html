<h1>Chapter 785: Guidance</h1><p>Among the numerous sword marks, this one, the most inconspicuous, was also the most peculiar!</p><p>Upon seeing the sword mark, Qin Sang felt a sudden tremor in his heart.</p><p>He stared intently at the mark, suppressing his inner turmoil, and calmly glanced back at the cultivators searching behind him. Seeing that no one had noticed, he pretended to search the area while keeping his gaze fixed on the sword mark.</p><p>The stone wall was crisscrossed with countless sword marks, and this was just one of them, showing no indication of being recently made.</p><p>This particular sword mark contained a unique sword intent. The moment Qin Sang saw it, a sense of familiarity washed over him. A Killing Rune within his Ebony Wood Sword vibrated, as if sensing something.</p><p>To his astonishment,</p><p>This Killing Rune wasn't one of the first five from the "Primordial Spirit Sword Nurturing Chapter," but the still incomplete sixth rune, created by Senior Qing Zhu!</p><p>Only someone who had cultivated this specific rune would notice the difference.</p><p>Qin Sang's face was filled with surprise.</p><p>Unless Senior Qing Zhu had taken on a disciple, they were the only two in the Cang Lang Sea who had cultivated this technique.</p><p>He had been unable to find any trace of Senior Qing Zhu and assumed something unfortunate had happened. Now he knew that Senior Qing Zhu was not only alive but had also left this sword mark here!</p><p>Was it left unintentionally, or did it hold a deeper meaning?</p><p>It was certain that if Senior Qing Zhu were still alive, he wouldn't give up searching for a way back. Coming to the Seven Kill Hall and the Heavenly Tower was perfectly reasonable.</p><p>He still had old friends in the Small Cold Realm, as well as sworn enemies seeking revenge.</p><p>But why hadn't Senior Qing Zhu returned? Was he unable to find the teleportation formation, or had something else happened?</p><p>Perhaps this sword mark held the answer.</p><p>Qin Sang waited until the last person had left.</p><p>After searching for a long time, they found nothing.</p><p>Everyone believed the previous person's claim that the Grand Sorcerer had likely retrieved the treasure from within the valley. Having lost hope, they were unwilling to waste more time there.</p><p>Qin Sang discreetly searched the area but found no other similar sword marks.</p><p>Once he was sure everyone was gone, Qin Sang returned to the stone wall. After a moment of contemplation, he channeled his Ebony Wood Sword and gently sent a wisp of sword Qi towards the mark.</p><p>The sword Qi was minuscule as it floated towards the mark.</p><p>Qin Sang had examined the sword mark carefully for a long time but couldn't discern anything from it. He was unsure if Senior Qing Zhu had left it unintentionally or if it concealed some secret.</p><p>Recalling a scene from the Violet Palace, he decided to test it with a sword strike.</p><p>The shape of the sword Qi perfectly matched the sword mark.  Upon contact, it silently merged into the mark.</p><p>The sword mark remained unchanged.</p><p>Suddenly, a ripple appeared within the nearby black light, and dozens of black threads shot out towards Qin Sang with astonishing speed.</p><p>These threads were but a tiny fraction of the black light, yet they filled Qin Sang with alarm. He had no doubt that he would be riddled with holes if struck.</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>Qin Sang's figure flashed with light as he retreated dozens of meters. Seeing the threads finally retract, he breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p>No wonder the Grand Sorcerer and the Demon Lord didn't dare fight near the edge of the threads. They could sense the fluctuations of True Essence, affecting even cultivators outside.</p><p>Once the black threads retreated and stabilized, Qin Sang returned to his original spot, gazing thoughtfully at the unchanged sword mark.</p><p>He seemed to recall something, his eyes lighting up.</p><p>Then, he closed his eyes slightly, his demeanor subtly shifting.</p><p>He immersed himself in the technique created by Qing Zhu.</p><p>Although he cultivated this technique, he hadn't followed Senior Qing Zhu's path exactly. His state of mind remained unaffected by the technique, maintaining his true self with the help of the Jade Buddha.</p><p>Now, he actively immersed himself, attuning to the Killing Rune, and sent out another wisp of sword Qi.</p><p>While retreating from the threads, Qin Sang kept his eyes locked on the sword mark.  The moment the sword Qi touched the mark, a change occurred.</p><p>A faint light flickered within the sword mark, and a dim orb emerged from the stone wall, shooting towards Qin Sang.</p><p>"It worked!"</p><p>Qin Sang's face lit up with joy as he reached out and grabbed the orb.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the orb dissipated. Qin Sang's expression changed, but he immediately received a message.</p><p>More accurately, it was guidance!</p><p>"It should be a nearby fragment!"</p><p>Qin Sang confirmed the content of the guidance. Senior Qing Zhu had directed him to a specific mountain fragment. Nothing more.</p><p>"Did Senior Qing Zhu leave this guidance specifically for me, or for his disciple?</p><p>"If it was for me, it means Senior Qing Zhu was still alive at least fifty years ago, when I fell from the Heavenly Tower.  Having arrived through the same teleportation formation and learning about the ancient corpse descending from the sky, he would have certainly connected the dots. He might even have been looking for me.</p><p>"What was he trying to tell me?</p><p>"It's hard to tell when the sword mark was made. Senior Qing Zhu not only disguised it well but also left guidance here, undetected by the Grand Sorcerer and the Demon Lord. That's not something achievable solely through a unique cultivation technique. What was Senior Qing Zhu's cultivation level when he left the sword mark?</p><p>"If he had already formed his Nascent Soul, why was he so unknown?"</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes flickered with countless questions.</p><p>He cautiously scanned his surroundings, then pushed off the ground, flying out of the valley.  After a quick glance, he flew off.</p><p>Soon, Qin Sang appeared on a fragment of mountain rock.</p><p>He looked straight ahead at a smaller fragment than the valley.</p><p>This was a precarious area. A stone staircase snaked upwards towards an ancient temple built into the mountainside.</p><p>The temple, nestled against the stone wall, backed onto a cliff.  There was nothing else noteworthy about the location.</p><p>The temple had no protective formations and was severely damaged and dilapidated. Even the roof had mostly collapsed, leaving only a corner near the cliff with a few tiles precariously clinging on.</p><p>There were no plaques, dragon pillars, or similar inscriptions.</p><p>At first glance, it appeared like any other common fragment, devoid even of ancient restrictions.  Any treasures would have been looted long ago. Yet, Senior Qing Zhu's guidance pointed here.</p><p>Qin Sang's figure flashed as he stealthily moved to the stone staircase, sensing nothing unusual.  He then quickly walked towards the temple.</p><p>The temple was tall, and its broken walls and remnants revealed its former grandeur.</p><p>He stood before the temple, trying to find other sword marks, but to no avail. After pondering for a moment, he focused on the stone wall behind the temple.</p><p>The temple was clearly and thoroughly destroyed. The most likely place was this stone wall.</p><p>Senior Qing Zhu's guidance wouldn't lead him here without a purpose.</p><p>'Clang!'</p><p>He swiftly set up a Spirit Sealing Formation around the area. At the same time, his Ebony Wood Sword shot out, delivering a diagonal slash.</p><p>The sword Qi silently merged into the stone wall as if swallowed.</p><p>This familiar scene made Qin Sang's eyes brighten. Without hesitation, he continued to channel his Ebony Wood Sword, sending wisps of sword Qi into the stone wall, causing faint flickers of light to appear.</p>
