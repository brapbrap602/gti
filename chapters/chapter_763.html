<h1>Chapter 755: Thwarted Plans</h1><p>However, trying to kill him with the poisonous mist was pure wishful thinking.</p><p>The Fat Silkworm, trembling within the Golden Radiance Armor, diligently performed its duty, protecting Qin Sang. Any poison entering Qin Sang's wound was immediately sealed off by the armor's detoxification properties.</p><p>Of course, Cui Ji couldn't see this.</p><p>Qin Sang clutched his wound, rolled to his feet, and simultaneously recalled the battered Nightfiend.</p><p>The Nightfiend, riddled with holes, lay motionless on the ground. Qin Sang had no time to assess its condition; retrieving it was his priority.</p><p>Another wave of violet light descended.</p><p>Grimacing, Qin Sang could only barely parry with the Ebony Sword. He appeared utterly spent and unwilling to fight, a picture of exhaustion and distress.</p><p>The Ebony Sword was slightly inferior to the Violet Orb, making the fight incredibly difficult for Qin Sang, forcing him to constantly react defensively.</p><p>Blood flowed freely from his shoulder, staining his clothes crimson.</p><p>The lingering blade aura within his wound continued to wreak havoc. Qin Sang could only suppress it with his true essence, unable to expel it quickly.</p><p>Cui Ji remained cautious, keeping his distance from Qin Sang. He didn't reveal the Bone Lotus or the Violet Orb and refrained from using his throwing knives, clearly intending to wear Qin Sang down.</p><p>If the Blood Defilement Divine Light could disable the Bone Lotus, the tables would instantly turn.</p><p>Observing Cui Ji's tactics, Qin Sang knew he had no chance if this continued.  His condition was worsening. He decided to retreat and lure the enemy deeper.</p><p>Just then, both Qin Sang and Cui Ji felt a sudden tremor and looked in the same direction.</p><p>The next moment, the earth quaked violently.</p><p>A deafening explosion echoed through the air.</p><p>The frenzied Violet Star Eagles shrieked in terror, scattering in all directions.</p><p>Qin Sang saw a blue pillar of light erupt in the distance, dispersing the surrounding poisonous mist.  The mist slowly reformed after the light vanished.</p><p>"What exploded?"</p><p>Qin Sang was startled. The explosion seemed to have originated near the stone hall.</p><p>Judging by the sheer force, the explosion's power must have been immense.</p><p>None of the eight of them possessed such destructive capability.</p><p>"What happened?"</p><p>Unease gnawed at Qin Sang. He glanced at Cui Ji, noticing a slight furrow in his brow and a hint of worry in his eyes.</p><p>Cui Ji's expression suggested he knew something.</p><p>A flurry of speculations raced through Qin Sang's mind. The Bone Lotus changing hands, Cui Ji's desperate ambush, the explosion, and Cui Ji's reaction all hinted at something more complex than a simple treasure hunt for the Merchant Alliance.</p><p>Something unexpected had occurred.</p><p>The beast horde attack might not have been a natural disaster!</p><p>Perhaps someone had deliberately lured the Violet Star Eagles and the subterranean beasts.</p><p>He recalled the identities of the eight individuals. Aside from Xiang Yi, whose origins were shrouded in mystery and seemed to have a close relationship with the Alliance Leader, the others were members of various merchant guilds.</p><p>He himself, formerly a guest elder of the Qiongyu Merchant Guild, had been required to join the guild by Elder Zou when purchasing his entry qualification.</p><p>The Merchant Alliance wasn't like a sect. The guilds within it were united by shared interests on the surface, but in reality, they harbored suspicions and often undermined each other.</p><p>The Liu couple, the cultivator surnamed Pan, the young man with the sword...</p><p>Their images flashed through Qin Sang's mind.  From their initial meeting until now, everyone had acted normally, betraying no suspicious signs.</p><p>He couldn't trust anyone now, unsure how many harbored ulterior motives.</p><p>A sense of dread washed over Qin Sang. He abandoned the idea of regrouping with the others. His only thought now was to kill Cui Ji and flee, avoiding the undercurrents within the Merchant Alliance.</p><p>It was best to stay far away from anything involving the Alliance Leader and the guilds.</p><p>Qin Sang parried the violet light while simultaneously dispatching a sword beam behind him to clear a path through the Violet Star Eagles.  He was hard-pressed, caught between the eagles and Cui Ji.</p><p>His breathing grew ragged, his aura weakened, and the effects of his injuries became increasingly apparent. Even his natal flying sword dimmed, indicating his dire situation.</p><p>Cui Ji glanced at Qin Sang, then at the explosion site, hesitation evident on his face.</p><p>Finally, he poured all his true essence into the Violet Orb, unleashing another attack as potent as the first.</p><p>Struggling against the onslaught of violet light, Qin Sang couldn't fully deflect the attack.  His body was repeatedly struck, his shoulder wound splitting open, gushing blood.</p><p>The Golden Radiance Armor was even more battered, covered in dents and cracks.</p><p>Fortunately, it hadn't completely shattered and could still be salvaged, though its full restoration would be difficult.</p><p>Qin Sang himself was in the worst shape.  The constant defense against the violet light drained his true essence rapidly. If not for the Fat Silkworm's detoxification, the poison would have overwhelmed him.</p><p>By now, he might have been on the verge of death.</p><p>Qin Sang retreated explosively, about to vanish into the depths of the Violet Star Eagle swarm.</p><p>Cui Ji took one last look at Qin Sang and, surprisingly, didn't pursue. Instead, he changed direction, heading toward the explosion site.</p><p>In his eyes, the severely injured Qin Sang, with depleted true essence, suffering from both blade aura and poison, and with his armor failing, had no chance of survival amongst the Violet Star Eagles.</p><p>Without the Bone Lotus's protection, Qin Sang would have to constantly channel true essence for defense, making his presence obvious to the beasts and escape impossible.</p><p>Qin Sang was as good as dead.</p><p>Let him savor his final moments of despair.</p><p>A cruel smile played on Cui Ji's lips. Though he yearned to kill his enemy personally, he feared contaminating his magic treasures.  Killing Qin Sang quickly would be difficult, and the matters at the stone hall were more pressing.</p><p>Cui Ji withdrew.</p><p>Qin Sang stopped, his expression shifting.</p><p>Cui Ji's choice surprised him.</p><p>The explosion was definitely related to Cui Ji. He wondered which of the other six were conspiring with him and who was the victim. There had been no prior indication.</p><p>Cui Ji's actions disrupted Qin Sang's plans.</p><p>He had intended to feign poisoning, lure Cui Ji closer, and unleash the Twin-Headed Serpent in a surprise attack.  Together with the serpent, he had a good chance of killing Cui Ji.</p><p>After avenging the ambush, he would leave this dangerous place.</p><p>Now, with Cui Ji gone, he couldn't very well chase after him.</p><p>Qin Sang sighed.</p><p>He had to kill Cui Ji!</p><p>Even if Cui Ji hadn't injured him, the feeling of being targeted was unsettling.  Nipping the threat in the bud was the wisest course of action.  He simply hadn't had the opportunity, and Cui Ji had gained the upper hand.</p><p>Unfortunately, killing Cui Ji here was now almost impossible. He would have to find another chance.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced in the direction Cui Ji had disappeared.</p><p>He couldn't wait any longer; he had to leave immediately.</p><p>He released the Twin-Headed Serpent and mounted it.  The Fat Silkworm intensified the detoxification, enveloping both Qin Sang and the serpent.</p><p>"Clear the path. I need to expel the blade aura from my wound..."</p><p>Qin Sang instructed the Twin-Headed Serpent in a low voice, then calmed his mind and focused inward, circulating his cultivation technique.</p><p>True essence converged at his wound, slowly forcing out the lingering blade aura.</p><p>A hint of color returned to Qin Sang's face.  He swallowed a healing pill.</p>
