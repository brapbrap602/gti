<h1>Chapter 1258: The Nine Palaces Formation, Right and Wrong</h1><p>A deafening roar!</p><p>Jing Yu's unleashed lightning formed a devastating storm, wild electric serpents danced, covering the sky and earth, intent on tearing apart the bloody mist.  At the same time, Tong You Mozhu's dark thunder exploded.</p><p>Chong Yi Daochang, his expression calm, activated his magical artifact, swiftly unleashing strange lights. Qin Sang and the others also used their abilities to help.</p><p>Their target was the central black tower!</p><p>‘Boom! Boom!’</p><p>Jing Yu's words proved true; the black tower withstood their attacks, appearing as solid as reality, giving no sign of being an illusion.</p><p>Thunder burst forth, churning the bloody mist into chaos, rumbling incessantly.</p><p>The shockwaves spread far and wide, alarming the entire formation.</p><p>Meanwhile, at the core of the Black Tower Formation…</p><p>The Cultivators of the Abyss of Sin had broken through the illusion, found the passage, and entered the real world hidden beneath it.</p><p>It was a vast space, grim and terrifying, filled with extremely dense bloody mist.</p><p>From here, the four black towers at the corners were clearly visible.</p><p>These four towers were real.  Between them, a barrier of restrictive magic sealed this space off from the outside world.</p><p>The restriction, like the Black Tower Formation itself, was not without damage, but being at the formation's core, it was well-protected, its damage minimal.</p><p>This space contained no other structures, only a vast, lake-like square pool of blood, filled to the brim with blood; the blood lake manifested from the outer seal was of this same blood.</p><p>The stench of blood was overpowering, carrying a potent blood poison; a single breath brought on a splitting headache and disorientation.</p><p>At the edge of the blood pool lay countless black ropes.</p><p>These ropes, of unknown material, shone with a gem-like luster, covered in strange runes; some were broken, others intact.</p><p>Each was as thick as a man's head, interlinked, incredibly heavy.</p><p>One end of each rope was anchored to the edge of the blood pool; the other extended into the pool, sinking deep into the bloody water, their ends unseen.</p><p>Above the blood pool, Ye Lao Mo sat cross-legged in mid-air.</p><p>Flanking Ye Lao Mo were two figures: Tian Zheng Laoren on one side, and Ye Lao Mo's blood demon avatar on the other, having apparently returned to rejoin them.</p><p>The group, centered around them, stared down at the blood pool, continuously attacking the seal with their magical artifacts.</p><p>The blood pool remained calm.</p><p>But the black ropes constantly emitted runes, deflecting all incoming attacks.</p><p>With their continuous attacks, the light emitted by the runes became fragmented.</p><p>At that moment, Tian Zheng Laoren's face changed, and he produced an ancient mirror.</p><p>Before he could activate it, a violent tremor shook the ground with a ‘rumble’.</p><p>Tian Zheng Laoren poured his spiritual energy into the mirror; he had left a backup outside, and sure enough, he saw figures attacking the illusory black tower.</p><p>But before he could see clearly, a cold snort came from the mirror, shattering the image.</p><p>“Not good! They’ve caught up!”</p><p>The others were shocked.</p><p>“Impossible!”</p><p>“They found the core of the formation so quickly, understanding the Black Tower Formation's rules!”</p><p>…</p><p>They were all baffled.  They had used tactics to force their opponents to split their forces, delaying them, believing it foolproof, yet the unexpected had happened.</p><p>The opponents had arrived here ahead of them, seeing through the illusion.</p><p>Completely unforeseen!</p><p>Tian Zheng Laoren's expression shifted, glancing at Ye Lao Mo, who remained focused on the blood pool, attacking the seal, ignoring the commotion outside.</p><p>He then looked at Ye Lao Mo's blood demon avatar.</p><p>The blood demon avatar sneered, “Don't look at me. I'll personally draw them away. Unless they have a grandmaster of formations among them, there's no telling how they found this place.”</p><p>“Even Yuan Shen Men's Leng Yun Tian doesn't have that ability!”</p><p>Tian Zheng Laoren declared, completely perplexed, unsure where they had gone wrong.</p><p>But the facts were undeniable; they had no time to ponder, they needed to act, to repel the enemy.</p><p>He looked at the blood pool, then surveyed his surroundings, making arrangements, “The seal is about to break; under no circumstances can we let them in.  A while ago, using the secret technique obtained from the Soul-Searching Demon Head, I and Ye Dao You carefully investigated; the person sealed beneath the blood pool should be unable to cause trouble, not a concern.  My Dao You and I are sufficient here; please assist Dao You Jiang Chenzi in setting up the Treasure Banner Formation at the entrance to block the enemy!”</p><p>Saying this, Tian Zheng Laoren looked at Jiang Chenzi and the other two holding the treasure banners.</p><p>The banners were the formation's eye.</p><p>Jiang Chenzi and the others exchanged glances and activated the treasure banners.</p><p>Outside the illusion…</p><p>Under the continuous bombardment of Tong You Mojun and the others, the illusory black tower was severely damaged, violently shaking before collapsing with a thunderous crash.</p><p>The moment the black tower collapsed, its fragments vanished, leaving behind only a gaping black hole.</p><p>Jing Yu signaled that this was the entrance. Everyone rejoiced, about to investigate, when suddenly three small, ornate flags rose from within, followed by a burst of bloody light.</p><p>Simultaneously, a loud roar echoed, "Get back!"</p><p>"Flag formation!"</p><p>Qin Sang coldly snorted.</p><p>The Cultivators of the Abyss were indeed here.  Their illusion had been broken, alerting them, and they'd set up this flag formation, waiting for them.</p><p>To proceed, the flag formation had to be broken first.</p><p>The next moment, the flag formation enveloped everyone, flashing past in a blur, then boundless bloody light filled their vision, engulfing them.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>Experienced as they were, the moment the formation appeared, everyone attacked simultaneously, targeting one of the flags.</p><p>That flag transformed into a flag gate, flapping noisily. Seeing their attack, figures emerged from behind the gate, led by Jiang Chenzi.</p><p>"Break!"</p><p>Jiang Chenzi roared, pointing a finger at them.</p><p>The flag gate surged, streams of bloody light like a raging river, carrying immense force that scattered their spells. Their magical treasures flickered and flew about.</p><p>Everyone was startled, quickly recalling their treasures.  Then, a great burst of bloody light erupted ahead, and the flag gate and Jiang Chenzi and his companions vanished.</p><p>"That's the true power of the flag formation. Luckily I reacted quickly, or the Serpent King and I might have been captured!"</p><p>Qin Sang was secretly alarmed.</p><p>Back then, only three people, including Jiang Chenzi, had controlled the formation, and it hadn't been fully set up before he'd defiled a flag with his Blood-Defiling Light, breaking it.</p><p>Now, with the Yuan Ying cultivators of the Abyss working together, the formation's power was incomparable.</p><p>The Blood-Defiling Light had been used, and the Abyss wouldn't give him another chance to attack the flags.</p><p>For a time, they were trapped in the bloody light, unable to locate the three flag gates. The flag formation intensified, boundless bloody light forming towering waves, a terrifying sight that was suffocating.</p><p>"Tong You, quickly activate the Nine Palaces Formation!"</p><p>Qing Jun shouted.</p><p>Tong You nodded, producing several slender jade talismans.</p><p>These talismans were thin as paper, each engraved with a vivid celestial palace image.</p><p>This Nine Palaces Formation was a specially crafted array, created by the Two Realms Alliance specifically for this Blood Lake expedition, requiring enormous effort and resources.</p>
