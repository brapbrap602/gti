<h1>Chapter 1137: Schemes</h1><p>After that, Qin Sang stayed in the Thousand Bamboo Sea, cultivating in the cave abode that once belonged to the wandering sage Yunyouzi. The affairs of the Thousand Bamboo Sea were managed by the Willow Tree Spirit, and Qin Sang had no intention of interfering, rarely showing himself.</p><p>Later, the Willow Tree Spirit brought the old horse monkey to meet Qin Sang and informed him of the truth. Seeing the aged horse monkey weeping bitterly, Qin Sang couldn't help but feel a pang of sorrow.</p><p>For the time being, only the Willow Tree Spirit, the old horse monkey, and the white cat knew of his existence in the entire Thousand Bamboo Sea. Unbeknownst to him, he had already been in the Thousand Bamboo Sea for over a year.</p><p>The investigation into Demon King Qianji and the stone slab was personally arranged by the Willow Tree Spirit. However, this was clearly not something that could be accomplished overnight, and Qin Sang was patient, quietly awaiting good news.</p><p>...</p><p>Nine Caverns Mountain.</p><p>The cave abode of Demon King Jiuku was located within this mountain. Demon King Jiuku was a transformed yin bat, and many of his subordinates were also bat demons. Among all the demon kings, his cave was the closest to the Thousand Bamboo Sea.</p><p>The area around the mountain was shrouded in yin energy, with no vegetation growing, presenting a stark contrast to the lush Thousand Bamboo Sea.</p><p>At this moment, in the cave abode of Nine Caverns Mountain, Demon King Jiuku was personally receiving a man clad in feathered robes. This man, known as Demon King Lihong, was of significant status, being a trusted subordinate of the Feather Demon King.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Jiuku, you must already be aware of my purpose. The Feather Demon King has decreed that once the frontlines send word, you must dispatch your subordinates in the numbers specified to join the battle," said Demon King Lihong, handing a jade slip to Demon King Jiuku.</p><p>Demon King Jiuku, with his sharp features and a pair of strange fleshy wings on his back, extended his slender fingers to take the jade slip. After reading it, he exclaimed in distress, "Why so many? Last time, I sent out my most trusted warriors, and only a handful returned alive. If I send out this many again, my Nine Caverns Mountain will be emptied!"</p><p>Demon King Lihong remained expressionless. "Fellow Daoist, you must have heard the news. The current situation is different from before. The Sin Abyss is making frequent moves, showing signs of a large-scale offensive and a decisive battle. On this journey, I have visited many fellow Daoists, and all are required to send this number of troops. It's not just you. Moreover, if the situation becomes critical, the Feather Demon King will personally go to the frontlines and select some of you to accompany him..."</p><p>"The Demon King himself will join the battle?" Demon King Jiuku interrupted, even more displeased. "It's just those two-legged sheep fighting among themselves. Like last time, sending some warriors is already going above and beyond. Why should we rush to sacrifice ourselves for them? Let them fight to the death, and we can benefit... At worst, we can abandon the Heavenly Demon Hills and live freely in the Ice Sea!"</p><p>"The Ice Sea is desolate and barren, with nothing but seawater and icebergs. Finding a place to settle is difficult. If the Ice Sea were suitable for cultivation, why would our ancestors have fought so fiercely with the humans to seize the Heavenly Demon Hills?" Demon King Lihong dismissed Demon King Jiuku's words. "Our ancestors formed an alliance with the Cold Domain, a pact of mutual defense, to stop the war. The human race's foundation is not so easily destroyed. Tearing up the alliance would not be good for us. Once we leave the Heavenly Demon Hills, it will be hard to return."</p><p>Demon King Jiuku had no rebuttal and sighed as he put away the jade slip.</p><p>"I hope Fellow Daoist prepares early and does not delay the greater plan. I must take my leave," said Demon King Lihong, rising to depart.</p><p>"Wait!" Demon King Jiuku suddenly called out. "Fellow Daoist, are you heading to the Thousand Bamboo Sea next?"</p><p>"Indeed," Demon King Lihong nodded.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist, don't rush. This is a spirit wine I've treasured for many years. Have another cup," said Demon King Jiuku, pulling Demon King Lihong back to his seat with a wide smile.</p><p>His sudden enthusiasm left Demon King Lihong puzzled. "Fellow Daoist, if you have something to say, speak plainly."</p><p>Demon King Jiuku filled their cups and chuckled oddly. "I wonder, how do the Feather Demon King and you view the master of the Thousand Bamboo Sea?"</p><p>"What do you mean?" Demon King Lihong's eyes flickered as he asked calmly.</p><p>Demon King Jiuku pointed in the direction of the Thousand Bamboo Sea, his tone mysterious. "Fellow Daoist, have you ever considered how many years it's been since that bamboo demon last showed himself?"</p><p>Demon King Lihong drank the spirit wine and leaned back in his stone chair, teasing, "I recall that Fellow Daoist Jiuku used to follow the Bamboo Elder's every word. Now he's just 'that bamboo demon'?"</p><p>After a pause, Demon King Lihong pondered, "Thinking about it, it must have been nearly three hundred years since I last saw the Bamboo Elder. However, plant spirits naturally have long lifespans, and their heavenly tribulations come much slower than ours. Besides, the Bamboo Elder is just a title. No one knows his true origins. He might not even be a bamboo demon from the Thousand Bamboo Sea who achieved enlightenment. Secluding himself for a few centuries is normal. The last time I visited the Thousand Bamboo Sea, I spoke with him."</p><p>"Three hundred years without showing himself is normal? Think carefully. Did you see his true form the last time you were in the Thousand Bamboo Sea?" Demon King Jiuku sneered. "No matter how long-lived plant spirits are, they are not exempt from the heavenly tribulations, which grow stronger each time! How many years has that guy lived?"</p><p>Demon King Lihong shook his head. "All I know is that the Bamboo Elder was the master of the Thousand Bamboo Sea even during the reign of the previous Feather Demon King. You can't possibly be..."</p><p>"I do have my suspicions!" Demon King Jiuku no longer hid his thoughts. "Although the Thousand Bamboo Sea is somewhat remote, it is one of the few fertile lands in the Heavenly Demon Hills. That bamboo demon has occupied it for so many years. Most of the plant spirits in the demon realm are in the Thousand Bamboo Sea, under the old fellow's protection. If we send these plant spirits out, regardless of their strength, as long as we meet the numbers required by the alliance, the humans cannot fault the Heavenly Demon Hills. It would also help us preserve some of our strength."</p><p>Hearing this, Demon King Lihong was startled by Demon King Jiuku's ambition. "You are truly audacious to scheme against the Thousand Bamboo Sea! Do you know how many souls have perished at the hands of the Bamboo Elder? His strength is unfathomable. The previous Feather Demon King treated him with great respect. If not for his lack of ambition for dominance..."</p><p>"Of course I know how powerful he is. Otherwise, why would I have endured all these years?" Demon King Jiuku chuckled dryly. "I value my life too much to incite you to oppose him. I just want to test the waters. If he's still alive, then we drop the matter. But if he's truly been struck down by a heavenly tribulation, what do we have to fear?"</p><p>The more Demon King Jiuku spoke, the more convinced he became, his tone growing more fervent and persuasive.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist, think about it. That bamboo demon's lifespan rivals that of the Black Tortoise. Over the years, who knows how many treasures he has gathered. Plant spirits cultivate much slower than us. In the Thousand Bamboo Sea, how many are truly formidable? Should all those treasures just fall into their hands?"</p><p>Demon King Lihong was momentarily stunned and fell silent.</p><p>Seeing this, Demon King Jiuku knew he had made his point and pressed on, "I'm not the only one with this idea. Many are watching, restrained by the old fellow's lingering influence, not daring to act rashly. With the Feather Demon King backing you, you might not truly fear him. A little probing could reveal the truth. When the time comes, we two could take the lead. I'm willing to let you have the lion's share..."</p>
