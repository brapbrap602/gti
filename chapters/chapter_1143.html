<h1>Chapter 1135: The Thousand Peaks Bamboo Sea</h1><p>Qin Sang had once met the Feather Demon King.</p><p>Before entering the Purple Palace, one had to pass through the outer immortal formation. The Feather Demon King used a treasure of the Witch Clan to find a flaw in the formation, and only then could he set up the Little North Star Array to break into the Purple Palace.</p><p>The Feather Demon King was an enigmatic figure.</p><p>Both the Red-Haired Ancestor and the True One Elder were wary of him.</p><p>"It seems that the Heavenly Demon Hills are not as stable as they appear," Qin Sang mused thoughtfully.</p><p>The white cat, seemingly having experienced danger, said with lingering fear, "Other places are not like the Thousand Peaks Bamboo Sea, where there are many gentle spirits of plants and trees. The territories controlled by the major demon kings are relatively stable, but only internally. If an outsider beast were to wander in, it would surely be devoured alive..."</p><p>Qin Sang sat across from the white cat, inquiring in detail about the situation in the demon realm.</p><p>"Does Fellow Daoist Liu know of my existence?" Qin Sang continued to ask.</p><p>He needed allies to help him obtain the stone slab, but he was unsure of Old Liu's temperament. The Wanderer had not had time to say much about it before.</p><p>The little white cat seemed trustworthy, harboring no ill will toward him, and they had a prior connection.</p><p>However, he was unsure whether the other beasts of the Thousand Peaks Bamboo Sea would despise humans.</p><p>"They know!" Due to the Wanderer's influence, the white cat trusted Qin Sang deeply. "After the Bamboo Demon sent me a message, I relayed it back to the Thousand Peaks Bamboo Sea. Grandfather Liu ordered me to stay in the Immortal-Demon City and wait for either the Bamboo Demon or you to return. Rest assured, Grandfather Liu is very amiable and utterly loyal to the Bamboo Demon."</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at the white cat.</p><p>The cat demon's tone was urgent, as if she had sensed his concerns and was eager to dispel them.</p><p>"Has something happened in the Thousand Peaks Bamboo Sea?" Qin Sang's heart stirred, and he decided to be direct, not hiding his suspicions.</p><p>The white cat was startled, then lowered her head. "I can't hide it from you... In recent years, the demon race has been continuously sending troops to the front lines. Some time ago, I received news that the Feather Demon King had issued orders for all major demon kings to continue training their troops and prepare for a decisive battle. It is said that this time is different from before, and the outcome could be extremely brutal. With the Bamboo Demon absent, I fear that the disguises left by Grandfather Liu and the Bamboo Demon might not hold. If they are discovered..."</p><p>The war was still brewing, and for now, the demon race was mobilizing troops according to the old rules, proceeding step by step.</p><p>But if the situation became urgent and the master of the Thousand Peaks Bamboo Sea still did not appear...</p><p>The thought of the terrible consequences made the white cat shiver.</p><p>The Wanderer had not anticipated that the Sin Abyss would return so quickly, and the situation would become so tense.</p><p>The preparations he had made earlier might not last much longer.</p><p>The beasts of the Thousand Peaks Bamboo Sea understood the principle of "when the lips are gone, the teeth will be cold." They were not refusing to join the war, but they feared that other demon kings might see through their weaknesses, and all the beasts, regardless of age or strength, would be driven to the front lines.</p><p>On the battlefield, without the protection of a demon king, they would only serve as cannon fodder.</p><p>Some of the demons in the Thousand Peaks Bamboo Sea were spirits of plants and trees, and many of these spirits had limited combat abilities. Sending them into battle would be a death sentence.</p><p>"The Bamboo Demon held you in high regard, Fellow Daoist Qin. Do you have any ideas?" The white cat looked at Qin Sang with hopeful eyes.</p><p>With the Wanderer gone, she could only place all her hopes on Qin Sang.</p><p>Hearing this, Qin Sang also felt the immense pressure.</p><p>The Wanderer had entrusted the Thousand Peaks Bamboo Sea to him before his death, and Qin Sang was determined to do his best. But he had not yet reached the Nascent Soul stage, and protecting an entire territory was an overwhelming task.</p><p>However, for Qin Sang, the crisis in the Thousand Peaks Bamboo Sea might also be an opportunity.</p><p>The Thousand Peaks Bamboo Sea desperately needed a powerful backer, and the best option was to fully support him in obtaining the mysterious stone slab and help him form his Nascent Soul.</p><p>Thinking this, he decided to go to the Thousand Peaks Bamboo Sea first.</p><p>Qin Sang stood up and began pacing, pondering. "Before the situation becomes critical, I might be able to buy you some time. But once things escalate, there's little I can do unless I can form my Nascent Soul before then."</p><p>Qin Sang's response made the white cat's eyes light up.</p><p>But then she heard something unexpected.</p><p>"Can you leave now and take me to the Thousand Peaks Bamboo Sea to meet Fellow Daoist Liu?" Qin Sang paused, then asked.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Qin, you want to go to the Thousand Peaks Bamboo Sea?" The white cat's face was full of concern. "I stayed in the Immortal-Demon City to wait for you, so I can leave at any time. However, the journey to the Thousand Peaks Bamboo Sea is long, and we must bypass the territories of other demon kings. I should be fine on my own, but you are a human."</p><p>Human cultivators entering the Heavenly Demon Hills would stand out and easily be discovered.</p><p>"If I weren't human, would that work? What about this..."</p><p>Qin Sang silently activated a spell, using the Heavenly Demon Transformation technique.</p><p>A pair of phoenix wings sprouted from his back, and a surge of pure demonic energy emanated from his body. If one ignored his human form, he could easily be mistaken for a demon beast.</p><p>The white cat's eyes widened in shock. "Fellow Daoist Qin, were you once a demon? No wonder!"</p><p>Qin Sang sighed.</p><p>This cat demon seemed to think that, like the Wanderer, he was a fusion of human and demon souls.</p><p>"I am not a demon. I merely cultivated a secret technique that allows me to grow wings and emit demonic energy. Also, look at this!"</p><p>As he spoke, Qin Sang activated the disguise technique passed down to him by Yuan Zhu. His aura immediately became obscure and profound, unfathomable.</p><p>"I can disguise myself as a transformed great demon. If I make an appearance, I should be able to intimidate those with ill intentions and prevent them from oppressing the Thousand Peaks Bamboo Sea for a time. However, this technique will fail if I use my true essence, so it's only a bluff."</p><p>Qin Sang also explained the limitations of the technique to the white cat, sighing, "Safety obtained through external means is only temporary, like a reflection in a mirror or a bubble in a dream. In the world of cultivation, strength is the foundation."</p><p>The white cat nodded in agreement, deeply moved.</p><p>Hearing that Qin Sang truly had a way to resolve the crisis in the Thousand Peaks Bamboo Sea, even if only temporarily, the white cat could not hide her excitement, her tail swishing back and forth.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Qin, we must not delay. Let's set off as soon as possible!"</p><p>The white cat acted swiftly, handling all necessary arrangements that very day.</p><p>With just the two of them, their journey would be much faster.</p><p>Even with the Heavenly Demon Transformation active, Qin Sang's appearance was still too conspicuous. He did not want to encounter other demon kings along the way, lest one of them take a fancy to sparring with him and expose his ruse.</p><p>They traveled as discreetly as possible, choosing remote and difficult paths, and with additional disguise techniques, they managed to reach the Thousand Peaks Bamboo Sea without major incident.</p><p>The Cold Domain and the Heavenly Alliance were separated by the vast Yun Cang Marsh to the north and south.</p><p>West of Yun Cang Marsh, the terrain gradually narrowed into the Yun Cang River, which flowed westward into the desolate ice sea at the western edge of the North Star Realm.</p><p>The Heavenly Demon Hills occupied the northwestern coastline of the North Star Realm, stretching in a long, narrow strip all the way to a significant distance south of the Yun Cang River.</p><p>However, the area south of the river was a desert, and most demon kings preferred to establish their domains north of the river.</p><p>North of the river, near the coast, lay a region of rolling mountains covered in endless bamboo forests.</p><p>Thus, it was named the Thousand Peaks Bamboo Sea.</p>
