<h1>Chapter 546: Strange Insects, Spirit Insects</h1><p>Chapter 546: Strange Insects, Spirit Insects</p><p>These two unorthodox methods can be used to enhance one's combat abilities.</p><p>Qin Sang had considerable experience with this during his Foundation Establishment stage.</p><p>His success to this point, including his ability to consistently outperform peers at the same cultivation level during his Foundation Establishment stage, wasn't solely due to his cultivation technique; he also relied heavily on external forces.</p><p>Besides magical treasures, the greatest help came from cultivating a separate Corpse Path.</p><p>Rapidly increasing combat strength is one of the hallmarks of the Heavenly Corpse Sect's corpse refinement techniques.</p><p>Unfortunately, Qin Sang only possesses the first half of the *Heavenly Yin Corpse Scripture*. He hasn't stopped searching for the latter half, diligently inquiring about the Heavenly Corpse Sect whenever he has free time, but to no avail.</p><p>While the Flying Night Rakshasa is powerful, that's the extent of it.</p><p>Like living corpses, their strength peaks the moment they're refined.  In the early Golden Core stage, the Flying Night Rakshasa is a useful asset, but at higher cultivation levels, it becomes useless.</p><p>Even when Qin Sang himself refined corpses, he couldn't find ways to improve them, let alone improve the Flying Night Rakshasa.</p><p>He wonders if the Heavenly Corpse Sect has other secret techniques that can further enhance the Flying Night Rakshasa's strength, similar to refining Corpse Pills.</p><p>Other sects' corpse refinement techniques are clearly different from those of the Heavenly Corpse Sect.</p><p>The only thing that might be useful is borrowing their corpse body refinement methods to see if the Flying Night Rakshasa can break through the limitations of the Heavenly Corpse Talisman.</p><p>Qin Sang needs to plan ahead and avoid limiting himself to a single path.</p><p>After thoroughly studying the *Tai Xuan Array Fragments* and the Golden Core cultivation notes, Qin Sang sighed. He realized he wouldn't find any more quick, low-effort techniques like the *Heavenly Yin Corpse Scripture*.</p><p>Both the Spirit Array and Beast Taming paths require a massive investment of time and effort.</p><p>Without sufficient mastery of Spirit Arrays, it's impossible to understand the *Tai Xuan Array Fragments*. Qin Sang would need a master to guide him and start from scratch.</p><p>However, he hasn't given up completely. He frequently studies the scroll, using his understanding to improve his skills in formations.</p><p>The Beast Taming path is also difficult.</p><p>Although the Golden Core cultivator's notes from the Spirit Controlling Sect aren't obscure, it's difficult to achieve anything without the necessary resources.</p><p>Beast Taming is a vast and profound subject.</p><p>Spirit beasts encompass various types, such as birds, beasts, fish, and insects.</p><p>Some beast tamers, like the Snake Woman, focus on a single spirit beast, feeding it their own essence blood, creating a life-bond.  The beast's strength is comparable to the tamer's, offering a two-on-one advantage in combat.</p><p>Others take the opposite approach, relying on sheer numbers.</p><p>Some specialize in cultivating venomous beasts, collecting a variety of strange and poisonous creatures, converging with the methods of poison-cultivating demonic cultivators.</p><p>The Golden Core cultivator's notes mention the Spirit Controlling Sect's use of beasts in formations, called Beast Arrays. The most powerful Beast Arrays are comparable to famous Spirit Arrays, but the requirements are incredibly stringent.</p><p>This Golden Core cultivator was a specialist, uninterested in the previously mentioned methods. He favored Insect Control within Beast Taming, emphasizing it in his notes.</p><p>To utilize these notes, one must follow the same path, explaining why the Old Man Di Que collected so many strange and spirit insects.</p><p>The difficulty is obvious: it requires a significant amount of effort to find and cultivate these strange insects.</p><p>Qin Sang lamented this.</p><p>Back in the ancient cultivator's relic, he snatched only Old Man Di Que's pouch, missing the spirit beast pouch, which would have made things much easier now.</p><p>Spirit insects are relatively easier to find, though rare. A Golden Core cultivator should have no trouble finding them.  However, their potential is far less than strange insects. Insects like the Green Coin Insect, even after considerable effort to cultivate them to adulthood, can only serve as auxiliary tools.</p><p>Actually, in the cultivation world, there's no clear distinction between strange insects and spirit insects; they're generally called spirit insects.  The term "strange insect" is a designation created by the Spirit Controlling Sect.</p><p>They have compiled a list of what they consider strange insects based on two criteria:  the power and strangeness of their abilities, and their potential.</p><p>Strange insects have greater potential.</p><p>Some strange insects require multiple transformations to reach adulthood, and their adult forms can rival, or even surpass, Yuan Ying stage cultivators!</p><p>However, not only are they extremely rare, each type of strange insect is incredibly difficult to cultivate.</p><p>The conditions for their transformations are incredibly demanding, comparable to human cultivators' breakthroughs.</p><p>According to the Spirit Controlling Sect's records,</p><p>after hatching, a strange insect or spirit insect's first transformation is analogous to a human cultivator's Foundation Establishment, the second to Golden Core, and so on.</p><p>Spirit insects generally only undergo one or two transformations before reaching adulthood, while strange insects have the potential for at least three.</p><p>The difficulty of transformation increases with each stage.</p><p>Especially after adulthood, when potential is exhausted, further transformation is nearly impossible without a stroke of incredible luck.</p><p>However, having potential doesn't guarantee transformation.</p><p>The old man from Dique didn't know how long he'd had the Fire Jade Centipedes. They had reached the limit of their growth, yet were unable to begin their first transformation, so he only used them for treasure hunting.</p><p>Because even the Yu Ling Sect didn't know how to help the Fire Jade Centipedes transform.</p><p>The Yu Ling Sect's understanding of strange insects is actually limited.  There are very few such creatures left in the current cultivation world, and very few cultivators have actually interacted with them.</p><p>Their knowledge comes from ancient texts and the experience of their predecessors.  They only have records of the auxiliary spirit herbs needed for the transformation of a few types of strange insects.</p><p>And that knowledge is mostly limited to the first two transformations.</p><p>Like Qin Sang's Blood Winged Devil Bees; he didn't know how to help them, leaving them to fend for themselves.</p><p>If those two Fire Jade Centipedes hadn't luckily encountered the Crimson Gold Vine fruit, which helps spirit insects break through, they might still be unable to transform.</p><p>The Blood Winged Devil Bees are worse off.  Their growth stagnated before they even reached their first transformation.  Even giving them Crimson Fire Gold was useless.</p><p>Qin Sang only has one Crimson Gold Vine fruit, and his supply of Crimson Fire Gold is limited.  He wouldn't waste it on them.</p><p>After careful consideration, Qin Sang couldn't decide, so he decided to take things one step at a time. If he encounters a suitable insect to cultivate, he can always pursue the Beast Taming path later.</p><p>Besides, he doesn't necessarily have to choose between them.</p><p>Shaohua Mountain is one of the Eight Great Righteous Sects.  There are so many Yuan Ying and Jiedan stage masters within the sect.</p><p>After he reaches the Jiedan stage, he can ask them for guidance or consult the cultivation scriptures that are only accessible to Jiedan stage cultivators, perhaps finding a more suitable secret technique for himself.</p><p>Having thought this through, Qin Sang no longer worried and turned his attention to refining.</p><p>He spent over twenty years studying refining. While not incredibly skilled, compared to the refining masters, his skills are still respectable. He can't neglect this craft after he reaches the Jiedan stage.</p><p>Qin Sang plans to refine his own magic treasures in the future.</p><p>Qin Sang secretly planned to make friends with a few cultivators from the Xu Ling Sect after he reaches the Jiedan stage, and ask them for advice. After all, his refining techniques came from Shopkeeper Wu, so it's completely above board.</p><p>His sect certainly also has treasured refining texts, although not as profound as the Xu Ling Sect's, he can still find them to study.</p>
