<h1>Chapter 1281: The Battle of Twin Mirror Mountain</h1><p>The moment Qin Sang took hold of the jade hairpin, a soul-shaking roar emanated from the Kirin Hairpin, resonating deep within his heart. Without needing any guidance from Lady Luo, Qin Sang, through the talisman seal, immediately understood. He tossed the Kirin Hairpin into the air.</p><p>"Roar!"</p><p>A furious roar echoed out.</p><p>The Kirin Hairpin transformed into a swirling mass of azure light, circling around Qin Sang. At times, it took the form of a jade hairpin, and at others, it morphed into a small kirin.</p><p>After making all the necessary arrangements, the two of them stepped out of the snow cave.</p><p>Lady Luo, disguised as Qin Sang, flew directly to the center of the grand formation, revealing herself within the formation to assist Qing Jun.</p><p>Meanwhile, Qin Sang, swaying with a graceful figure, flew leisurely toward the front lines. He would lead the low-level cultivators in a charge into the enemy's grand formation.</p><p>Along the way, the low-level cultivators, unaware of the truth, did not realize that beneath this enchanting exterior was a man. Many cast eager glances his way.</p><p>Fortunately, the urgency of the battle and Lady Luo's status as a Nascent Soul Ancestor deterred anyone from daring to approach him.</p><p>However, they inevitably encountered those who knew the truth.</p><p>"Uh... Fellow Daoist Luo."</p><p>Jing Lin, who was aware of their plan, greeted Qin Sang with a strange look in his eyes, though his expression remained calm. However, when he saw the charming smile on Qin Sang's face, he felt a shiver run down his spine and quickly fled.</p><p>Qin Sang's heart was already numb at this point. Without changing his expression, he flew to the front lines and looked up at the sky-encompassing lake above, convincing himself that this was a sacrifice for the greater good.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>A deafening explosion shook Twin Mirror Mountain, signaling the start of the assault.</p><p>'Whoosh...'</p><p>Countless sharp whistling sounds suddenly filled the battlefield. A tempestuous gale swept across the land, scattering snowflakes in all directions, turning the world into a vast, white expanse.</p><p>At the center of the storm, the figures of Qing Jun and Lady Luo flickered in and out of view. Around them stood other figures, along with neatly arranged, peculiar wooden tablets.</p><p>Each of these tablets was as large as a door panel, inscribed with strange runes. They seemed to be the source of the raging wind.</p><p>On the battlefield, a group of cultivators stood around similar, though smaller, wooden tablets. The runes on these tablets flickered, forming a mysterious array. The cultivators formed hand seals, channeling their energy into the tablets, resonating with Qing Jun and the others.</p><p>All the tablets shone with dazzling light as spiritual energy converged madly toward them. The wind grew even fiercer, so much so that those with weaker cultivation could barely keep their eyes open and felt as though they might be blown away.</p><p>At that moment, a strange phenomenon suddenly appeared.</p><p>The wind reached its peak intensity, and gray streaks of wind energy could be seen swirling in the void, manifesting the power of the hurricane. These gray streaks began to gather and merge, forming a funnel-shaped vortex.</p><p>Seeing this, everyone knew that the spiritual formation was about to unleash a terrifying tornado.</p><p>The wind columns were restrained in place, rapidly taking shape and expanding. Thick columns of wind twisted and spun wildly, pointing directly at the azure waves above. They swept away everything on the mountainâ€”rocks, snow, dead trees...</p><p>Leaving behind a scene of utter devastation.</p><p>...</p><p>"The Gale Formation! The Two Realms Alliance is actually willing to deploy this formation. They're really going all out! Find an opportunity to destroy their core formation artifact. Let's see if they can refine another set!"</p><p>At the summit of Twin Mirror Mountain, the Nascent Soul cultivators of the Sin Abyss hid within their formation, looking down at the mountain below. One of them growled fiercely.</p><p>"Huh? Those two people... they seem to be the ones who blocked Elder Ye at the Blood Lake."</p><p>One of them activated a secret technique, vaguely catching sight of two figures at the center of the formation. However, his vision was quickly obscured by the raging wind, and his spiritual sense couldn't penetrate further. He muttered in confusion, "It seems these two are the ones leading the assault on Twin Mirror Mountain. They're as timid as mice, not daring to come up and fight personally. Could there be other experts?"</p><p>"Perhaps they're not in a hurry to take Twin Mirror Mountain. Instead, they're testing and containing us. Their main force must be at Wangdong City and Stone Bend Mountain. Controlling the Gale Formation isn't easy. These two have no prior reputation and have suddenly risen to prominence. Though their treasures are powerful, their foundation can't be as solid as Elder Ye's. They must work together to maintain the formation..."</p><p>Someone speculated, and it sounded reasonable.</p><p>"For now, we'll focus on defense and see what they're up to. Look for an opportunity to destroy the core of the Gale Formation, and wait for news from Senior Canghong!"</p><p>The purple-robed woman made the decision and turned back to personally oversee the formation.</p><p>...</p><p>The hurricane seemed capable of tearing apart the heavens.</p><p>The force of the wind reached the summit of Twin Mirror Mountain.</p><p>The Sky Lake above was affected, its surface rippling and waves rising. Strangely, the waves surged downward, creating a bizarre sight.</p><p>Qin Sang stood within the battle formation, maintaining a graceful posture. His slender, jade-like fingers curled slightly, holding a palm-sized wooden tablet.</p><p>This was the Wind Tablet, which connected to the power of the Gale Formation. It ensured that once they broke into the enemy's formation, they could maintain communication and formation alignment, preventing them from accidentally straying from the protection and being hunted down by the enemy.</p><p>The Gale Formation was no ordinary formation. It was one of the most powerful formations refined by the Two Realms Alliance. Not only was it extremely difficult to control, but the amount of spirit stones required to sustain it was staggering.</p><p>The increasingly thick wind columns showed signs of losing control.</p><p>Suddenly, all the wooden tablets shone with a strange light, trembling violently as if on the verge of shattering.</p><p>At that moment, the battlefield fell into an eerie silence for a brief instant. Then, all the wind columns shot up from the ground like spears of wind, aiming straight for the summit of Twin Mirror Mountain!</p><p>The Sky Lake, sensing the threat, gathered layers of water waves toward this direction, its color deepening to a near-black indigo.</p><p>However, the power of the Gale Formation was no less than the carefully laid restrictions of the Sin Abyss. Moreover, under Qing Jun's deliberate control, all the wind columns concentrated their attack on a single area.</p><p>Under the gaze of countless eyes, the wind columns plunged unimpeded into the Sky Lake, sinking deep into its waters. Only then did a deafening roar follow.</p><p>'Boom...'</p><p>Like a series of heavy hammers striking Twin Mirror Mountain, the impact reverberated in everyone's hearts.</p><p>The mountain, which had stood for countless years, now seemed fragile, as if on the brink of collapse. The terrifying scene in the sky was etched deeply into everyone's eyes, evoking feelings of awe, longing, and anticipation...</p><p>'Crash!'</p><p>The power of the Gale Formation erupted deep within the Sky Lake. The terrifying force tore apart the lake's surface, causing the water to surge inward. The fissure grew larger and larger, unable to close for a long time.</p><p>Through the fissure, everyone could clearly see the Sin Abyss cultivators standing ready for battle, even making out their horrified expressions.</p><p>The collision of the two formations dissipated the strongest wave of residual energy, leaving them locked in a stalemate, each devouring and destroying the other.</p><p>"Kill!"</p><p>A cannon blast rang out.</p><p>The battlefield was filled with the sounds of battle cries. Countless dark figures charged up the steep slope, rushing toward the Sky Lake.</p><p>War was cruel, yet awe-inspiring.</p><p>Qin Sang had experienced war more than once, but this was his first time leading troops on such a large scale, charging at the forefront. In the world of cultivation, where individual strength reigned supreme, low-level cultivators could still unleash astonishing power.</p>
