Chapter 1900: A Century


Spring was warm and the scenery bright.

Fish leaped and kites soared.

The fresh air filled his nostrils, and Qin Sang couldn't help but take a deep breath.  This place held no trace of the Six Heavens Realm!

The Heavenly and Earthly Yuan Qi was stable, and far richer than in the Storm Realm.

The Great Thousand World!

Finally, he no longer needed to constantly worry about the chaotic Heavenly Dao, nor rely on the Soul Altar for survival.

This meant he had escaped the reach of the River of Misfortune.

Qin Sang looked around.  Shimmering waves stretched as far as the eye could see, a vast expanse of azure. There was no sign of the River of Misfortune, the mysterious man, or the flatboat. They had vanished without a trace.

“What form does the River of Misfortune take in the Great Thousand World? A black river? An endless black fog? Or a little-known, mysterious place? Am I on the banks of the River of Misfortune, or have I been transported to a specific location?”

Qin Sang wondered where the mysterious man had sent him.  He hadn't the slightest awareness of how the man had departed.

No one could answer Qin Sang's questions. Neither the First Sword Attendant nor the Sword Spirit had ever told him about these things.

“Cough, cough, cough…”

Qin Sang suddenly coughed violently, feeling a wave of searing pain, like knives cutting through his insides.

As the power of the Inner Lion Seal faded, his injuries worsened. His body was depleted, yet he still had to maintain the Altar-Protecting Divine General. An intense weakness washed over him, and Qin Sang almost fell into the water.

Vermilion Bird flew out, a cloud of crimson fire surging from her body, catching Qin Sang.

“Find… find a deserted island nearby…”

Qin Sang said with difficulty.

The most urgent task was to heal his injuries and stabilize the Thunder Ancestor. He didn't need an exceptionally good spiritual vein, just a safe cave dwelling where he could cultivate in peace.

Whether in a Small Thousand World or a Great Thousand World, superior spiritual veins were likely already claimed.

Qin Sang needed to avoid contact with cultivators as much as possible. He didn't know how many people in the Great Thousand World were searching for the Violet Vibrance Emperor Sword and the Violet Vibrance Emperor's successor.

The scenery in all directions looked the same.  Vermilion Bird chose a random direction and flew close to the water's surface.

Newly reborn, she flapped her small wings, struggling to carry Qin Sang, but that didn't stop her from complaining.

“Around you, it's either being chased or being beaten!”

“You can't die now…”

“Wait until I grow up and can protect myself, then you can die!”

…

As the power of the Inner Lion Seal continued to fade, Qin Sang's life force ebbed away. At first, he thought the damned bird had developed a conscience, but later he almost laughed in exasperation.

They proceeded cautiously.  Thousand-Eyed Butterfly scouted ahead, and Vermilion Bird slowed down.  After only the time it takes an incense stick to burn, Thousand-Eyed Butterfly sent a mental message that she had spotted land.

A moment later, some undulating contours appeared on the horizon.

“An island or a continent?”

Qin Sang didn't know if he was in the sea or a river or lake.  As he pondered, his expression shifted slightly.  “There’s the aura of cultivators, it seems the highest is only Golden Core stage…”

Vermilion Bird set Qin Sang down on a reef, and Thousand-Eyed Butterfly concealed herself, flying alone towards the land.

As the butterfly fluttered, Qin Sang could perceive everything Thousand-Eyed Butterfly saw and heard.

This place was clearly inhabited.

Thousand-Eyed Butterfly flew to the shore and saw several fishing boats tied up, not the kind of large ships that could withstand ocean storms.

Then, as expected, she saw wisps of smoke rising from a village of about a hundred households nestled at the foot of a mountain, surrounded by cultivated fields.

It was dusk, and the villagers in the fields had stopped working, returning home with their hoes, walking along the paths between the fields.

Some chatted and laughed, walking at a leisurely pace, while others, hungry, hurried back.

It was a peaceful and harmonious scene.

These villagers were no different from the mortals of the Storm Realm, but they were healthy and rosy-cheeked, suggesting that while they weren't wealthy, they were at least well-fed and clothed.

Unseen, a colorful butterfly gently flew over the village, up to the mountain peak, and soared into the heights.

If this was an island, it was a gigantic island, comparable to a continent.

In the distance, mountains rose and fell, stretching endlessly.  Paths and roads could be vaguely discerned, connecting villages and towns.

It could be said that there was a village every ten li and a city every hundred li.  The main roads were straight and wide, free of bandits. Even as night approached, merchants still traveled along them.

Thousand-Eyed Butterfly paused for a moment, then continued to fly, crossing mountains and valleys, until she reached a mountain.

This wasn't a particularly steep or spectacular peak, but it seemed to gather the spiritual essence of the surrounding area.  The spiritual energy was rich, making it a good place for cultivation.

The cultivator auras Qin Sang sensed emanated from this mountain.

There was a Daoist temple on the mountain, called the Smoke and Water Temple, divided into a front and a rear mountain, a common layout for many temples.

The front mountain welcomed mortal worshippers, and incense burned heavily. The mountain path was bustling with activity.

The rear mountain was a forbidden area, a place for cultivation.

Thousand-Eyed Butterfly quietly flew into the temple and discovered a protective formation around the rear mountain, isolating it from the mundane world.  However, the formation wasn't strong. In the eyes of Qin Sang and Thousand-Eyed Butterfly, it was full of flaws.

Not daring to intrude rashly, Thousand-Eyed Butterfly landed on a rock and used her Thousand-Eyed Divine Ability, confirming again and again that the highest cultivation level in the temple was only Golden Core late stage.

Judging by the location of the quiet chamber where this person resided, he was the highest-ranking person in the Smoke and Water Temple.

Night fell.

Thousand-Eyed Butterfly lingered for a while, then continued onward, flying a circle before returning to the reef.

"There's no shortage of cultivators nearby, but most are rogue cultivators.  Only the one in the Daoist temple has the highest cultivation. Golden Core late stage is enough to occupy this Daoist site, and the temple buildings are ancient, seemingly having existed for many years without experiencing war.  It's a good, quiet place to heal…"

Qin Sang made his decision and ordered Vermilion Bird and Thousand-Eyed Butterfly to carry him to the Smoke and Water Temple.

After landing, they continued to move cautiously.

Qin Sang discovered that this place also had deities. Mortal cities all had City God temples.

The City God Temples were bustling, clearly with a supernatural presence, albeit not a strong one.

The same was true for Earth God Temples and Mountain God Temples, but not every mountain had a Mountain God. For instance, the mountains near the Smoke and Water Temple had none.

This scene was similar to what he had seen when he first entered the Talisman World, but there were no rampaging ferocious beasts here.

Unsure of the strength of the deities in the Great Thousand World, Qin Sang remained cautious, avoiding contact with them for the time being.

Arriving at the Smoke and Water Temple, Qin Sang didn't alert anyone. He quietly passed through the formation, chose a secluded cliff face on the rear mountain, carved out a cave dwelling, set up restrictive formations, and settled down.

…

The furnishings within the cave dwelling were simple.

Qin Sang sat cross-legged on the stone bed, his eyes closed.

Thousand-Eyed Butterfly perched on his left shoulder.

Vermilion Bird lay on his right shoulder, her head buried in her body, curled into a ball like a clump of fire, fast asleep.

The First Sword Attendant had molded Vermilion Bird’s spirit, an act no different from rebuilding her Dao foundation.  For Vermilion Bird to regain her former strength, to "grow up," she first needed to stabilize her Dao foundation.

Qin Sang sensed the Soul Altar.

Currently, the Soul Altar housed two demons and one insect: Marquis Gui, Marquis Luo, and the Fire Jade Centipede.

Qin Sang had planned to repair the Taiyi Star Carriage and then return to Mount Ju to manage the Soul Altar, so he had brought the two Demon Marquises with him when he left Sword Heart Island.

When the Thunder Ancestor descended, the impact on them was far less than on Qin Sang himself.  Perhaps because the Thunder Ancestor's descent into the Soul Altar, the scattering of his Inner Truth, and the shaking of the Soul Altar had caused them to be in even worse condition than Thousand-Eyed Butterfly. They had all fallen into a coma, and their current state was unknown.

Looking at the two Demon Marquises, Qin Sang couldn't help but ponder. He absolutely could not reveal his identity, but he had used the Seven Souls Killing Formation and the Cloudroaming Sword in front of others more than once, including when he captured these two Demon Marquises.

He would tentatively call the previous world the Talisman World.

In the Talisman World, the Dao Sect surely had made arrangements regarding the cultivators and demon cultivators who had witnessed him using sword techniques.

He had to handle these two Demon Marquises himself.

Their lives were in his hands. He had made promises to them before, so he wouldn't necessarily kill them. Keeping them by his side to serve him, they surely wouldn't be able to escape his grasp.

Although he had stepped into the Void Refinement stage, his foundation wasn't solid. He would inevitably need to seclude himself for a long time, and he also needed a few people he could use.

To be safe, he would erase their memories after he recovered his cultivation.

“I wonder how the Court will arrange things for Fellow Daoist Mo…”

Qin Sang thought of Mo Xingdao.  It was a pity that their previous agreement couldn't be fulfilled.

The Dao Court would bring Mo Xingdao into the Great Thousand World, but that wasn't what Mo Xingdao wanted.  The Dao Court likely wouldn't kill innocent people, but they might not let Mo Xingdao go either.  Perhaps they would show him a clear path.

Qin Sang could barely protect himself and couldn't worry about others. He gathered his thoughts and examined his internal injuries.

‘Pop! Pop! Pop!’

More than a dozen jade bottles floated in front of Qin Sang, opening one after another.  Pills flew out and were swallowed by Qin Sang in turn.

Having suffered the consequences of the Inner Lion Seal's power fading, Qin Sang had prepared in advance.  These pills could help him stabilize his injuries quickly, preventing them from worsening.

After refining the medicinal power, Qin Sang took out the corpse of the black demon roc.

‘Poof!’

As the corpse was taken out, a burnt smell, like something struck by lightning, immediately filled the cave dwelling.

Qin Sang waved his sleeve, clearing the unpleasant odor, and examined the demon corpse.

The demon roc was entirely blackened, its flesh damaged in many places. But the remaining demon bones, flesh, and demon core were priceless treasures.

It seemed that the treasures on the demon roc had been destroyed by the thunder. Just as Qin Sang was greatly disappointed, he noticed something in its belly. He cut it open and found a coral pearl.

"It really is a Mustard Seed type artifact!"

Qin Sang was overjoyed.  After studying it for a long time, he finally unlocked the restrictions on the coral pearl.

As expected, it contained the demon roc’s collection accumulated over many years, including numerous healing elixirs.

This was precisely what Qin Sang needed.  He gathered up the other treasures indiscriminately, keeping the medicinal pills, feeling more confident about his healing.

There was still residual snake venom in his body. It was no longer a threat, and Qin Sang suppressed it within his body, planning to use it for body refinement.

When his injuries improved slightly, Qin Sang summoned the Soul Altar and examined the Altar-Protecting Divine General.

Even with the Five Thunders Emissary Seal stabilizing the altar, the Thunder Ancestor's phantom image showed obvious signs of restlessness. The Five Thunders Emissary Seal alone was almost unable to maintain it.

Although the Thunder Ancestor's phantom image hadn't completely lost control, in this state, the Earth Slaughter Sword Qi couldn't be completely concealed. It would be completely exposed before a powerful being. Fortunately, the mysterious man hadn't kept him because of the Yin-Yang Go pieces.

He needed to wait at least until the Thunder Ancestor's phantom image stabilized before venturing out.

Qin Sang calmed his mind and examined the Five Thunders Emissary Seal, sensing the Thunder Ancestor's phantom image.

"Hiss!  This divine seal actually contains a Thunder Technique inheritance!"

Qin Sang was both surprised and delighted.  He hadn't expected that the Five Thunders Emissary Seal was not only a symbol of status but also contained records of some Thunder Dao cultivation techniques, and most importantly, various Thunder Talismans!

Summoning Divine Thunder Talisman, Illuminating Golden Country, Heaven and Earth Decree Talisman, Mending Clouds and Making Rain Technique, Commanding the Heavenly Emperor Incantation…

Qin Sang was almost lost in the vastness of the Thunder Techniques, constantly marveling at the profoundness of the Dao Sect's heritage and the exquisiteness of the Thunder Techniques.

He cultivated the High Divine Empyrean Scripture but hadn't received a true inheritance, only learning three Thunder Talismans, including the Five Thunders Heavenly Heart True Seal Talisman.

These perfectly compensated for his deficiencies in the Thunder Dao.

"Celestial Master Zhang has given me a great gift!"

Qin Sang sighed inwardly.

His cultivation had increased too rapidly, and his “Demonic Refinement of Form” hadn't caught up. Many of his divine abilities were difficult to utilize against Void Refinement stage opponents.

Unable to use the Cloudroaming Sword and the Seven Souls Killing Formation was like losing an arm.

He wouldn't change his cultivation techniques, but he could choose some Thunder Talismans to cultivate as his primary means of combat in the future.

Not in a hurry to study the Thunder Techniques, Qin Sang used the Five Thunders Emissary Seal to sense the Thunder Ancestor's phantom image.

Suddenly, Qin Sang frowned.

"The connection with the Divine Court has been severed…"

He couldn't sense the Divine Court, nor could he sense the Nine Heavens Responding Yuan Thunder Sound Universal Transformation Heavenly Venerable.

He didn't know if the connection was truly broken or if his cultivation was insufficient.

"The Daoist scriptures say that Dao Sect cultivators can summon deities and generals even when they're outside, deterring demonic evils.  Could that be an exaggeration?  Could something have happened to the Divine Court?"

Qin Sang couldn't help but worry. The Dao Sect was their ally, and he naturally didn't want anything to happen to them.

He didn't know yet whether the loss of contact would affect his Altar-Protecting Divine General, but there were many obvious adverse consequences.

The Great Thousand World was vast and boundless.

Without this connection, he couldn't determine the location of the Divine Court, and thus wouldn't know where Celestial Master Zhang would establish his Daoist site.

After stabilizing the Thunder Ancestor, Qin Sang wouldn't be able to seek refuge there.  He would be like a rootless duckweed, drifting in the Great Thousand World.

Furthermore, most of the talisman inheritances within the Five Thunders Emissary Seal were related to summoning deities, transforming into deities, and commanding Thunder Deities.  These talismans would become unusable, and he wouldn't be able to cultivate them.

Qin Sang shook his head and dismissed these distracting thoughts.

Gradually, Qin Sang confirmed that with the help of the Five Thunders Emissary Seal, stabilizing the Thunder Ancestor's phantom image wasn't difficult, it just required a long time.

…

Spring turned to winter.

Heat and cold alternated.

A hundred years passed in the blink of an eye.

The moss on the cliff face grew thicker, the bottom piled high with fallen leaves, overgrown with weeds.

Few people came to this place.  Over the past century, the Smoke and Water Temple had welcomed several new waves of disciples, and some accomplished disciples had gone down the mountain for training, but no one had discovered the hidden world behind the cliff face.

During these hundred years, Qin Sang had only awakened once, twenty years ago.

That day, the Temple Master of the Smoke and Water Temple had reached the peak of the Golden Core stage. After years of refinement, he decided to attempt to break through to the Nascent Soul stage.

Qin Sang had been awakened by the fluctuation of the Heavenly and Earthly Yuan Qi and looked through the cliff face towards a quiet chamber in the temple courtyard.

Unfortunately, the phenomenon of the Heavenly and Earthly Yuan Qi only lasted for a quarter of an hour before the clouds dispersed and the sky cleared.  He failed to attract the Heavenly Tribulation.

Qin Sang shook his head and sighed softly, then continued his meditation.

Today was the one hundred and fifth year since he entered the Great Thousand World.

Inside the cliff face, Qin Sang had carved out another cave dwelling for Marquis Luo and Marquis Gui.

And in Qin Sang's cave dwelling, a bed had appeared.

Lying on the bed was a young girl, the spirit of the Five Elements Crown, asleep until now.

A Vermilion Bird nestled beside the girl, also sound asleep.

Qin Sang sat cross-legged, motionless for a long time.

At this moment, the Soul Altar floated before him.  In the position of the Altar-Protecting Divine General, the Thunder Ancestor's phantom image was clearly more distinct and solid.

‘Crackle…’

Thunder rumbled within the cave dwelling, but the restrictive formations contained it, not disturbing the cultivators of the Daoist temple.

Suddenly, a blinding thunderous light erupted from the Soul Altar, then instantly retreated back into the altar.  The Thunder Ancestor's phantom image could be seen, holding the Decree Golden Book in one hand and the Five Thunders Emissary Seal in the other, sitting firmly in the center of the altar.

Qin Sang slowly awakened, looking at the Soul Altar and nodding slightly.

"It should be foolproof now!" (End of Chapter)
