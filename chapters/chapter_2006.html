<h1>Chapter 1997: The Dark Star</h1><p>Qingyang Temple, Outer Peak.</p><p>From Qin Sang's palm, pearl after pearl was born, flying into the air, radiating starlight.  Countless pearls formed a miniature galaxy within the cave.</p><p>Qin Sang gazed at this galaxy, divine light glittering in his eyes, emitting a mysterious brilliance that contained the evolution of countless stars. He was comprehending the Heavenly River Reversal Killing Formation.</p><p>Beside him, the broken components of the Heavenly River Reversal Killing Formation were neatly arranged, but he had yet to begin refining them.</p><p>Refining magical treasures and refining formation components had similarities, but also differences. Refining formation components wasn't extremely demanding on refining skills, but it required mastery of the Dao of Formation Restrictions. One must, at least, have a thorough understanding of the spiritual formation about to be deployed.</p><p>All formation components must be united in their energy flow.  A complete understanding of each component before refining was essential for achieving momentum, forming the formation. Otherwise, the refined products would be nothing more than a pile of scrap metal.</p><p>After gazing for a while, Qin Sang raised his head, his gaze piercing through the mountain, looking towards the sky.</p><p>A moonless night.</p><p>In the clear night sky, the Milky Way, a gathering of countless stars, was so dazzling, making one deeply aware of the vastness of the void.</p><p>Qin Sang imagined himself swimming in the Milky Way, shuttling between stars. Space seemed boundless, without boundaries, neither coming nor going. He was a tireless fish.</p><p>This fish, however, had the ambition of leaping the Dragon Gate, constantly flicking its tail, attempting to stir the 'waters' of the Milky Way, even becoming the master of the river.</p><p>Mastery was, of course, merely a delusion. Qin Sang could, at most, only influence the Milky Way, connecting the formation of the Heavenly River Reversal Killing Formation with the stars of the galaxy.</p><p>But when comprehending a grand formation, delusion wasn't necessarily a bad thing. Qin Sang didn't restrain himself, letting his thoughts wander freely.</p><p>In this way, at a certain moment, a sudden epiphany would arrive, locking onto a point that resonated with the Heavenly River Reversal Killing Formation, and the rest would follow naturally.</p><p>He dared to do this because he had accumulated a certain understanding of the Dao of Stars. If it were someone else, they would only wander aimlessly and be unable to converge their thoughts, unless they were exceptionally lucky. Otherwise, they would only waste time.</p><p>While Qin Sang was comprehending the Heavenly River Reversal Killing Formation, Taiyi was diligently cultivating at Qingyang Temple.</p><p>Qin Sang had briefly revealed his plan to leave and travel the vast world, and Taiyi immediately felt immense pressure.</p><p>He naturally wanted to follow his Lord, but he knew his priorities. He was now an Immortal Official of the Dao Court, and his position meant responsibility.</p><p>By staying, he could look after Qingyang Temple, freeing his Lord from worries, and he could also continuously comprehend the Fourth-Order Thunder Talismans, promising a bright future.</p><p>His Lord would certainly not forget him.</p><p>Throughout the history of the Dao Court's development, the Twenty-Four Orthodoxies all grew from a single city or region. Qingyang Temple, overseeing the world, could already be considered a Wandering Orthodoxy. If his Lord so desired, it might eventually grow into the Twenty-Fifth Orthodoxy of the Dao Court.</p><p>His Lord had entrusted him with guarding this legacy, a truly heavy responsibility.</p><p>At the Azure Sky Dharma Assembly, his Lord had also spent a fortune to purchase various treasures that could enhance his cultivation.</p><p>Fearful of disappointing Qin Sang's expectations, Taiyi didn't dare to relax for a moment, sitting on the main altar, immersed in cultivation, day after day for ten years.</p><p>During these ten years, Qin Sang and the others hadn't visited the Azure Sky Grotto-Heaven again. The Four Sects were still in the preparatory stage.</p><p>On this day, Qin Sang finally emerged from the cave and entered a separately constructed fire chamber. With a wave of his hand, countless spiritual materials flew out in a magnificent stream, circling above his head.</p><p>These spiritual materials were all rare treasures of the world. Even sealed by restrictions, they displayed various wondrous qualities, illuminating the room with shimmering light.</p><p>Ignoring these materials, Qin Sang first picked up a broken formation component, examining it closely as it floated before him.</p><p>Suddenly, Qin Sang's mind stirred. Several streams of light descended from above. Without any visible action from Qin Sang, these streams of light were enveloped in balls of flame, burning spontaneously in the void, purging impurities and leaving behind an essence like liquid metal.</p><p>Immediately afterward, the broken formation component also flew over, melting in the flames, mixing and merging with the essence, appearing like a chaotic pot of porridge to ordinary eyes.</p><p>Qin Sang remained unhurried. One after another, restrictions left his hand, merging into the mixture, gradually revealing an extraordinary texture, a nascent form taking shape.</p><p>At this point, Qin Sang suddenly stopped, lost in thought. After a long while, he continued, patiently refining.</p><p>After a period of busy work, a complete formation component finally took shape. The process was remarkably smooth, exactly as Qin Sang had envisioned.</p><p>The auspicious start boosted Qin Sang's confidence, and his refining speed increased. One after another, formation components took shape.</p><p>Qin Sang became completely oblivious to time.  An unknown amount of time passed, and the torrent of spiritual materials above his head vanished, replaced by numerous formation components.</p><p>These components varied in form. Some were round and bright like jade beads, while many others were gleaming swords with the sheen of metal.</p><p>These swords were identical in shape, each with seven stars engraved on the blade. The only difference was in their luster; some were deeper, exuding a more profound aura.</p><p>*Clang!*</p><p>The final Seven Star Sword took shape.</p><p>Qin Sang let out a long breath and flicked his finger. The Seven Star Sword emitted a clear, resonant sound.</p><p>"Finally, they are all complete!"</p><p>With a brief breath regulation, Qin Sang recovered and flew above the Outer Peak, overlooking the land.</p><p>This formation, intended as a world-protecting grand formation, naturally needed to be connected to the spiritual veins, harnessing the power of heaven and earth to aid in its deployment.</p><p>Before going to the Azure Sky Grotto-Heaven, Qin Sang planned to test it at the Outer Peak first. If all went well, he would perform Stellar Essence Infusion here.</p><p>This required modifying the Outer Peak to harmonize with the grand formation. If the sect didn't have a Void Refinement cultivator, it would take a long time to complete, even with the entire sect's combined effort.</p><p>Qin Sang's divine sense swept out, awakening those cultivating in the mountains.</p><p>The Red Plum Twin Demons had also been brought here by Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang valued these two demons highly.  They were able to cultivate to the late stage of Transformation in a shattered small thousand world, standing at the peak of their realm, which demonstrated their talent.</p><p>After experiencing the gray tribulation lightning of the great thousand world, their cultivation had soared, and they had a high probability of breaking through to Nascent Soul.</p><p>In the future, they would be the pillars of Qingyang Temple.</p><p>Dozens of streaks of light flew out from the mountains. There were disciples sent by Qingyang Temple for secluded cultivation, the Red Plum Twin Demons, Ling Shi, and the remaining Fallen Soul Abyss remnants, including Jing Cang.</p><p>Over the years, they had been imprisoned at the Outer Peak, neither killed nor released, as Qin Sang ignored them, wearing down their spirit.</p><p>Subduing the Fallen Soul Abyss remnants would provide Yu Lang and Taiyi with manpower in the future.</p><p>Qin Sang had considered every aspect.</p><p>"Greetings, Great Lord."</p><p>The Red Plum Twin Demons bowed. They had adopted the Two Demon Marquises' way of addressing him, adding the word 'Great' before it. Xiao Wu found it amusing and followed suit, leaving the Two Demon Marquises with no choice but to comply.</p><p>Ling Shi, having no master-disciple relationship with Qin Sang, followed Taiyi's example, addressing him as Lord.</p><p>The other disciples all called him Patriarch.</p><p>A gust of spiritual wind enveloped everyone, transporting them to the sky.  Those with keen senses had already realized what was happening, their faces filled with excitement as they watched Qin Sang's actions from afar.</p><p>Qin Sang deactivated the previous protective formation and raised his palms, facing the sky.</p><p>The earth rumbled loudly, the mountains shaking violently, the magnitude so great that one worried they might collapse.</p><p>But these mountains were far more robust than imagined. The ground on both sides of the canyon rippled like a blanket, rising and falling as if countless dragons were swimming beneath.</p><p>The world's spiritual energy fluctuated wildly, causing clouds to churn and the heavens and earth to overturn!</p><p>The Red Plum Twin Demons were stunned, and the Qingyang Temple disciples were witnessing this world-altering scene for the first time.</p><p>In their eyes, the figure at the center of the storm was as majestic as a god!</p><p>The clouds parted, the mountains remained, the earth, the canyon, and the greenery were all as before, yet there was a sense of a transformed world.</p><p>Qin Sang unleashed the formation components, one after another, then conjured a ball of light that transformed into a star, scattering across the void and vanishing in an instant.</p><p>Finally, Qin Sang waved his hand, and the Seven Star Swords flew out in unison, points downward, piercing the earth and disappearing from sight.</p><p>The commotion subsided only after Qin Sang completed the Heavenly River Reversal Killing Formation.  Everyone awoke as if from a dream, unable to recall how much time had passed, but this experience left an indelible mark on their minds.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced towards them, and the Seven Star Swords flew out of the ground, shooting towards them.</p><p>Everyone grasped a Seven Star Sword.</p><p>"Focus on comprehending the Dharma Swords."</p><p>Qin Sang commanded.</p><p>Entrusting the Seven Star Swords to his disciples, the sect united in spirit, jointly resisting external enemies, was the true strength of the Heavenly River Reversal Killing Formation.</p><p>The formation was versatile, varying depending on the individual, and could be refined into a sword shape or other forms.</p><p>Qin Sang preferred swords.</p><p>No one dared to delay, immediately sitting cross-legged in the clouds, placing the Seven Star Swords flat on their laps. Profound knowledge flowed into their minds, and they eagerly began their comprehension.</p><p>Qin Sang released his divine sense, fully perceiving the grand formation.</p><p>After a while, streaks of light arrived from the east. It was Taiyi, Yu Lang, and the Two Demon Marquises, along with a group of elite disciples from Qingyang Temple.</p><p>Upon arrival, they were met by the incoming Seven Star Swords.</p><p>After over a hundred years of establishing the sect and accepting disciples, the highest cultivation level among Qingyang Temple disciples was only at the Golden Core realm.  Having them control the Seven Star Swords was naturally far inferior to Nascent Soul cultivators, and they couldn't execute many variations.</p><p>However, Qin Sang only needed the Heavenly River Reversal Killing Formation for Stellar Essence Infusion, without requiring other variations.  Having Taiyi and the others assisting was sufficient, and it would also allow the younger generation to experience the wonders of a top-tier grand formation.</p><p>Leaving the others to comprehend the Seven Star Swords, Qin Sang descended into the abyss, circulating the Shadow Bone Technique, adjusting his state, preparing for Stellar Essence Infusion.</p><p>Three years later.</p><p>Ripples appeared on the Black River, and a figure slowly emerged.</p><p>Qin Sang was completely naked, revealing a perfect physique, every part of his body brimming with powerful energy!</p><p>Donning a Daoist robe, Qin Sang appeared on the mountain peak.  Taiyi and the others were leading the disciples in practicing the formation, having already grasped a certain level of understanding and able to barely operate it.</p><p>As long as they didn't hinder him, it was enough. The true formation master was Qin Sang himself.</p><p>With a single command, everyone's faces became solemn as they unleashed their Seven Star Swords.</p><p>*Swish, swish, swish!*</p><p>Taiyi and the others led the disciples, scattering across the Outer Peak, each occupying a node.</p><p>At the same time, starlight diffused, enveloping the Outer Peak.</p><p>In an instant, the enormous mountain and everyone within it vanished into thin air.</p><p>From the outside, only chaotic starlight could be seen, as if a thousand stars were contained within.</p><p>Inside the Heavenly River Reversal Killing Formation, stars slowly rose into the sky, eventually merging with the Milky Way above, becoming indistinguishable.</p><p>If anyone were to intrude into the formation, they would discover that there were no mountains or earth here, only a vast and brilliant Heavenly River.</p><p>Everyone became a part of the grand formation, their minds completely merged with it, isolated from the world, forgetting everything outside, only following the guidance of the formation master.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang stood on the mountain peak, closing his eyes, observing the formation with his mind.</p><p>Xiao Wu stood beside him, the Skyeye Butterfly fluttering and playing around her. Xiao Wu occasionally let out a silver bell-like laughter.</p><p>After returning to the mountain, Xiao Wu seemed to have completely forgotten her experiences below, reverting to the pure, innocent, and carefree little tool spirit she had been when she first gained sentience.  Able to suppress her demonic nature, she appeared even more harmless.</p><p>Suddenly, the starlight flickered.</p><p>Xiao Wu stopped laughing, her gaze sharpening as she looked towards the outside of the mountain, guarding Qin Sang alongside the Skyeye Butterfly.</p><p>*Screech!*</p><p>A phoenix cry resonated through the galaxy.</p><p>Green light emanated from Qin Sang's back as the Azure Phoenix manifestation appeared behind him.</p><p>He kept his eyes closed, diverting part of his mind to connect with the grand formation and circulating the *Celestial Demon Body Refinement*.</p><p>Every inch of his skin, every muscle, every bone in his body was fully mobilized.</p><p>His blood surged, roaring like thunder.</p><p>The Azure Phoenix manifestation raised its head towards the sky, restless, as if about to spread its wings and soar.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang's mind flickered, and the long-dormant grand formation suddenly activated!</p><p>*Clang, clang, clang!*</p><p>Everyone felt their Seven Star Swords vibrating wildly. Gritting their teeth, they exerted all their strength to control the Dharma Swords, following the movement of the formation.</p><p>The grand formation mirrored the Heavenly River, resonating with the Milky Way in the void. The starlight in the sky grew increasingly brighter.</p><p>Starlight converged.</p><p>A celestial phenomenon appeared.</p><p>Cultivators of Twilightfall Mountain were startled, flying out of their caves to find the west illuminated as bright as day. Starlight descended from the night sky, clearly visible, like an inverted Heavenly River, rushing downwards towards the former site of Fallen Soul Abyss.</p><p>Such a stunning celestial phenomenon must indicate the actions of a great power.  Everyone couldn't help but recall the events of a hundred years ago, feeling uneasy, unsure of what changes were occurring.</p><p>Cloud Capital Heaven.</p><p>Old Man Solitary Cloud, who was in meditation, frowned slightly, also alerted by the phenomenon.  He appeared in the sky, looking towards the west, then at the somewhat unusual starry sky. After sensing for a moment, he murmured, "It seems Daoist Qingfeng has finished refining the grand formation."</p><p>With that, Old Man Solitary Cloud's figure flickered, travelling westward.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>At this moment, it was as if all the starlight in the sky was drawn here, shining solely upon this place!</p><p>Substantial starlight descended from the heavens, the Milky Way hanging upside down, cascading from the Ninth Heaven.</p><p>Beneath this Milky Way was Qin Sang!</p><p>Vast starlight descended upon the world. Compared to it, Qin Sang's figure was incredibly small, even the entire mountain peak couldn't withstand the scouring of the Milky Way.</p><p>"Screech!"</p><p>The Azure Phoenix manifestation faced the Milky Way without fear, abruptly spreading its phoenix wings and soaring.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>The Milky Way descended.</p><p>The true power of the killing formation was revealed. Qin Sang's blood nearly froze as he sensed the impending danger.</p><p>Yet he didn't dodge or evade, completely immersed, suppressing the urge to flinch. He flew up from the mountain peak, receiving the Milky Way with his physical body!</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>A thunderous boom exploded beside Qin Sang's ears.</p><p>In that instant, Qin Sang felt as if countless swords and blades were piercing his body, the familiar pain washing over him like a tide.</p><p>Qin Sang was long accustomed to it. Despite the pain of this Stellar Essence Infusion far surpassing previous experiences, he remained unmoved, allowing the starlight to tear and simultaneously temper his physique.</p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang suddenly realized that this Stellar Essence Infusion was unusual.</p><p>Not only was his true body bathed in starlight, but the Azure Phoenix manifestation was also undergoing refinement.</p><p>Moreover...</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>Qin Sang and the Azure Phoenix manifestation simultaneously raised their heads, gazing towards a certain point in the night sky.</p><p>There were no stars there, yet he faintly sensed, within the emptiness, a seemingly dark star resonating with the Azure Phoenix manifestation.</p>
