<h1>Chapter 192  Swordplay Divides</h1><p>Chapter 192  Swordplay Divides</p><p>After the Evil Corpse was made, it had a green face with bared fangs and evil energy flowing from its body. Its evil nature was obvious. The decent cultivators should better not use it if possible. After he was capable of controlling the Evil Corpse skillfully, Qin Sang put the Evil Corpse into the Corpse Puppet Bag and let it feed itself and returned to his cave.</p><p>The refining process seemed complicated. In fact, it took only less than five days. Qin Sang glanced at the pool, which had no change and left it alone. He then sat down with crossed legs.</p><p>After consideration, he took the trophies he got from the branch of Heavenly Corpse Sect from his Mustard Seed Bag and reviewed himself to prepare himself for the travel to the Ancient Immortal Battlefield.</p><p>Firstly, it was the talisman treasure given by Senior Sister Qing Ting. Although it had a crack, it was far from being exhausted. If it was not overused, it could be used several times. It could be called his strongest trump card. Of course, it must be kept well.</p><p>Qin Sang showed the Cracked Iron Stake to Storekeeper Wu, but he could not tell what it was. He guessed that it could be some kind of formation equipment. They were all rare materials and of appreciated quality.</p><p>Qin Sang recalled the scene when he saw the skeleton. The large area of the ground was covered by the debris of spirit stones around the Cracked Iron Stake, while the possessions of the skeleton were not looted. Storekeeper Wu was probably right in his guess that it should be able to make some invisibility formation, but the man was too badly injured that he could not escape death in the end.</p><p>The iron stake was already broken to the point of being almost useless.</p><p>Then, there was the Dragon-subduing Staff of White Cloud Hermit and the spirit sword named Smokescreen Sword, which was taken from Yuèshēng Wu. Its quality was not as good as Scarlet Flame Sword.</p><p>These two magic tools were the best of the best among the high-grade magic tools. They were the strongest tools apart from the strongest tools of the two. Smokescreen Sword was no doubt a good tool. Dragon-subduing Staff also had many clever uses and could deal with many complex situations.</p><p>After entering the Ancient Immortal Battlefield, Qin Sang planned to use these two magic tools as his main tools. Ebony Sword could hide in the dark and launch surprise attacks. Then, he would use Myriad Yamaraja Banner or talisman treasure according to the situation.</p><p>With the addition of the Evil Corpse, Dark Yin Thunder, and two Soul Devouring Cones, Qin Sang realized that he had quite a few ways to protect his life. He should not have a problem staying alive by not doing anything stupid.</p><p>It was a pity that Fallen Cloud Wings, the most useful tool, was an Evil Tool and could not be used for a long time.</p><p>Qin Sang actually looked at the escape technique of Yuèshēng Wu, but he could not find similar magic formulas either in his Mustard Seed Bag or in the Pagoda Peak. It was very likely that it was the innate Godly Power that came with the technique, so those not practicing the same technique could not learn it.</p><p>Although he did not find the escape technique, it made Qin Sang discover the Sword Formation of Thousand Mechanisms.</p><p>After breaking through the period of Foundation Establishment, the Finger Profound Sword诀 became a bit simple. Qin Sang had been planning to change his swordplay, but the Primordial Spirit Nourishing Sword Chapter was more important. He could not attend to both at the same time.</p><p>Pagoda Peak contained comprehensive swordplay. There were dozens of swordplay that were able to be performed by the cultivators in the period of Foundation Establishment only. They had different powers and different characteristics. The strongest five swordplay, in addition to being very difficult to perform, were very expensive to buy. They were almost as expensive as a superb magic tool!</p><p>Those without masters or those Foundation Establishment disciples who were not valued seldom selected these five swordplay. Instead, it was better to use the spirit stones to buy a useful magic tool, which was more practical.</p><p>Moreover, without the guidance of a master, it would be necessary to spend an astonishing amount of time and energy to gain enough accomplishments in the area of swordplay, which would inevitably conflict with cultivation.</p><p>Qin Sang released his spiritual consciousness into the jade slip and pondered over the Sword Formation of Thousand Mechanisms carefully. His eyes flashed continuously. Sword Formation of Thousand Mechanisms was of course not comparable with the five swordplay, but it also had its ingenious之处.</p><p>The core of this swordplay was to split sword energy and control the forces of repulsion and attraction of sword energy to build a Sword Formation of Thousand Mechanisms, which allowed the maximum use of the power of sword energy.</p><p>Splitting sword energy was far different from Swordplay Divides. Swordplay Divides was an extremely high-level realm of swordplay. It was said that at least the Golden Core Period was needed to comprehend it. It also required extraordinary natural talent in the Swordplay.</p><p>This was also confirmed by the Primordial Spirit Nourishing Sword Chapter. The small innate Godly Power after practicing the Primordial Spirit Nourishing Sword Chapter to the fifth level, which was after the Golden Core period, was Swordplay Divides. It could make the Natal Spirit Sword split into a swordplay.</p><p>Swordplay Divides had endless amazing uses. Of course, the most important use was to establish the complicated sword formation through the connection of heart and will. However, it was not to say that the swordplay could be invincible by just having multiple swordplay. Otherwise, everyone would find a suit of spirit swords as magic tools.</p><p>It was a pity that Primordial Spirit Nourishing Sword Chapter had no following chapters, so he did not know what formations the Godly Power was in the latter chapters. Besides, it was hard to form a formation with two swordplay.</p><p>The creator of the Swordplay of Thousand Mechanisms had comprehended this swordplay based on Swordplay Divides. He split sword energy and changed it to sword formation. He was not limited by his cultivation. As long as he could carry out the sword energy, he could practice the swordplay.</p><p>The more advanced your cultivation level is, and the stronger your mind power is, the more sword Qi you can control.</p><p>The sword Qi from the [Thousand Machines Sword Art] each only inherits a small portion of the Ling sword's power, which is originally not very useful, but it becomes different after forming the sword formation. All the sword Qi are connected to each other within the formation, and fuse together into one, overcoming the Ling sword itself.</p><p>As the cultivator’s attainment in sword art increases, the sword formation will be even more powerful.</p><p>In the cave, although Qin Sang didn't see Wu Yu Sheng release the sword formation, he could see from the aura when the sword formation was formed that its power was certainly not weak.</p><p>Had the three of them not harbored evil intentions, they would have killed the living corpses long ago.</p><p>Furthermore, the difficulty of cultivating this sword art is not as high as the five sword arts of Mount Shaohua. You split into two sword Qi, combine with the Ling sword itself, and then you can form a mini sword formation. Later on you can slowly comprehend at your leisure. With each split of the sword Qi, it is a visible improvement.</p><p>After reading the [Thousand Machines Sword Formation], Qin Sang immediately decided to make it his main cultivation sword art, not just to save the spirit stones needed to exchange for it.</p><p>Swoosh!</p><p>The Yan Li Sword flew out of Qin Sang's palm, releasing sharp sword Qi, flying around Qin Sang for a week.</p><p>The Wumu Sword was still being cultivated within his Nascent Soul, so he temporarily borrowed the Yan Li Sword to comprehend the sword art.</p><p>After a round of consecrating, Qin Sang took the Yan Li Sword as his own, then closed his eyes, submerged his mind power into the jade slip, and absorbed the [Thousand Machines Sword Formation] with full concentration.</p><p>The Yan Li Sword's divine light was restrained, lying across Qin Sang's knees, the entire cave was suddenly plunged into silence.</p><p>The spring water was clear, the orchids bloomed silently, and the divine flowers' exceptional aroma were firmly locked in by the prohibition above the pool, which was such a shame.</p><p>Time passed day by day, Qin Sang was like a statue.</p><p>A month passed in the blink of an eye.</p><p>On this day, a long sword wail suddenly rang out in the cave.</p><p>The Yan Li Sword, which had been motionless on Qin Sang's knees the entire time, suddenly shot without warning to above Qin Sang's head!</p><p>Qin Sang abruptly opened his eyes, his eyes flashed with an essence, staring intently at the Yan Li Sword.</p><p>Over the past few days, the various insights he had gained from comprehending the [Thousand Machines Sword Art] flashed quickly in Qin Sang's mind, and he felt that he could try to split the sword Qi, and without hesitation urged his spiritual power to infuse it into the Yan Li Sword.</p><p>Buzz!</p><p>The Yan Li Sword released a great deal of sword Qi!</p>
