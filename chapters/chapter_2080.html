<h1>Chapter 2071:  Different Destinies</h1><p>Li Yu Fu understood what Qin Sang truly wanted to ask, and his expression suddenly grew heavy.  He spoke slowly, and even though Qin Sang was prepared, she couldn't help but sigh.</p><p>Those disciples and friends who had left Beihai for Zhongzhou, once the pillars of Qingyang Temple, were almost all gone.</p><p>Bai Han Qiu had long abandoned her pursuit of the Dao and was enjoying family life.  As Qin Sang's disciple, she held a high position in Qingyang Temple. With the temple's growing prosperity, she had ample access to elixirs, but she struggled to advance beyond the Golden Core stage, eventually passing away peacefully.</p><p>Perhaps because of this, she wasn't as strict as other elders, and the younger generation of Qingyang Temple loved to be close to her.  Knowing she wouldn't achieve enlightenment, she focused on caring for her juniors and the mundane world during her life. Whenever a promising talent emerged in the Great Sui Dynasty, she would bring them back to the mountain.  Under her influence, the Qin and Bai families intermarried, and along with other disciples of Great Sui origin, they formed the Great Sui lineage, now one of the most prosperous branches of Qingyang Temple.</p><p>Mei Gu enjoyed seeing different parts of the world. After Qin Sang left, she traveled extensively, and luckily had several breakthroughs, barely reaching the Nascent Soul stage.  However, Mei Gu believed that it was unlikely a Nascent Soul cultivator, let alone a Transcendent cultivator, would appear in the four regions of Beihai in a thousand years. After achieving Nascent Soul, she became even more free-spirited, her footprints covering almost all of the four Beihai regions, exploring places she hadn't dared to go before.</p><p>When the celestial changes arrived and spiritual energy revived, she found that her past indolence had caught up to her, and it was too late to catch up. She ultimately perished in a Heavenly Tribulation.</p><p>After Mei Gu's death, the Moyan sect lineage failed to produce any outstanding successors, gradually fading away.</p><p>A similar fate befell the Yuan Shen sect lineage.</p><p>This lineage originated from the Yuan Shen sect.  It was the legacy left after Zhao Ying, Qing Jun's disciple, joined Qingyang Temple.</p><p>After Zhao Ying's death, no outstanding successors emerged from her line.  However, this lineage focused on formations and prohibitions, indispensable in war.  Li Yu Fu placed great importance on this lineage, cultivating several excellent disciples, who unfortunately fell in battle. He could only allocate as many resources as possible, hoping for the lineage's revival one day.</p><p>Of the original lineages, the Sword Cultivators were exceptionally prosperous.</p><p>The first head of this lineage was Shangguan Li Feng. He cultivated the Qingzhu Sword Scripture, passed down by Qingzhu and annotated by Qin Sang.  He himself stopped at the Golden Core stage and perished during a training excursion, but he had a remarkably talented student.</p><p>This disciple, Dao name Huan Hen, was exceptionally gifted. After mastering the sword, he went out to avenge his master, single-handedly slaying his enemies and distinguishing himself among his peers, subsequently making rapid progress.</p><p>Huan Hen possessed exceptional talent, comprehension, and courage.  He dared to fight in battles, honing his swordsmanship against the Changyou tribe. Combined with the sect's devoted cultivation, he broke through obstacles and reached the Transcendent stage, becoming the most outstanding junior of Qingyang Temple. He is currently stationed at the front lines.</p><p>Tan Yi En dedicated his life to managing the sect, allowing Li Yu Fu and others to focus on cultivation. He managed the sect impeccably, and with the solid foundation Qin Sang had laid, Qingyang Temple flourished. Seeing the sect's growing prosperity, Tan Yi En passed away peacefully at the Golden Core stage. Many of his descendants still serve as officials within Qingyang Temple.</p><p>The one Qin Sang regretted most was Tan Hao.</p><p>He was originally the most powerful cultivator in Qingyang Temple. Without any unforeseen events, with the aid of the Qingling energy, he was expected to be the most likely to break through to Transcendent.  However, he failed to overcome this barrier and died of old age.</p><p>Li Yu Fu said in a mournful tone:  “Elder Tan Hao had the potential to become a Transcendent cultivator, but to allow us younger generations to cultivate peacefully, he actively took on the sect's external affairs. Especially during the celestial changes, he relentlessly supported our cultivation, giving us all the spirit treasures and elixirs he found, keeping nothing for himself, hoping that at least one or two of us could break through to Transcendent before the catastrophe and escape, preserving the legacy of Qingyang Temple.  But because of this, Elder Tan Hao himself missed the opportunity..."</p><p>Tan Hao is now buried together with Shi Hong, with Tan Yi En's tomb beside theirs; the family reunited in the afterlife.</p><p>Qin Sang gazed at the vast blue sky, silent for a moment. Another good friend, someone she could sit with and reminisce about the past, was gone.  Of the fellow disciples who had joined the Kuiyin Sect, only she remained. That period of her life had completely become a memory.</p><p>While some passed away, others emerged.</p><p>For example, Huan Hen, the foremost among his juniors, who has already reached the Divine Transformation stage, and Qin Nian Sui, the current leader of the Da Sui lineage.</p><p>Qin Sang still remembered this disciple, the first member of the Qin family to show talent for cultivation. Bai Han Qiu had once brought Qin Nian Sui to meet him.  This young man is currently stationed in Bei Chen, guarding the ancestral temple of Qing Yang Temple. He possesses a good temperament and may have the potential to reach the Divine Transformation stage in the future.</p><p>Among them, Li Yu Fu also mentioned an unexpected person—Bai Ying’er.</p><p>"Bai Ying’er repeatedly expressed to me her lifelong regret at not becoming a disciple under Master Uncle's tutelage. After learning of her connection to Master Uncle and witnessing her outstanding aptitude and genuine sincerity, without a hint of falsehood, I asked the Glass Fairy to preside over her paying respects before Master Uncle's statue, allowing her to become Master Uncle's disciple and join Qing Yang Temple.  I acted without Master Uncle's permission, and I beg for your punishment!"</p><p>Li Yu Fu knelt down to plead guilty.</p><p>Qin Sang remembered this woman, a connection stemming from Cang Lang Sea.  He had simply guided her in the past, leaving her a cave abode.  Unexpectedly, she eventually became his disciple through a twist of fate.</p><p>He wouldn't blame Li Yu Fu for this, "I did offer her some guidance back then, establishing a master-disciple relationship. As long as she wholeheartedly pursues the Dao and doesn't disgrace Qing Yang Temple, I will accept her as my disciple.  There's nothing wrong with giving her this status."</p><p>Speaking of which, Qin Sang suddenly recalled his return to Cang Lang Sea and his request to the Four Saints Palace to find the two-headed… creature.  He only received rumors, some sightings of it with a young woman.</p><p>"Was that two-headed… creature with Bai Ying’er…? It might not have two heads anymore."</p><p>Li Yu Fu breathed a sigh of relief and nodded.  "Disciple Ying’er is incredibly gifted and diligent in her cultivation, and she will never bring shame to our sect! The one Master Uncle mentioned, I believe it’s that… creature. When I saw it, it already had three heads. Disciple Ying’er relied on that… creature’s help to overcome countless dangers.  Only…"</p><p>Qin Sang remembered that the two-headed… creature was in its transformation period, about to grow a third head. It seems it successfully broke through. He also remembered that stubborn creature’s strong will, ultimately sacrificing itself to draw away a powerful enemy for him. He felt quite happy to hear this outcome.</p><p>At that moment, Li Yu Fu's expression changed, showing distress.  Qin Sang frowned and asked in a low voice, "Something happened to them?"</p><p>Li Yu Fu hadn't dared to stand up, sadly bowing her head.  "I am incompetent. I failed to issue a timely warning, resulting in my junior sister and that… creature suffering a simultaneous attack by the mist waterfall and mist beasts, and being unfortunately swept away by the mist waterfall.  Also swept away were Elder Jing Yu, Chi Lei, Bai He, and many other friends from the Qianshan Bamboo Sea…"</p><p>With each name mentioned, Li Yu Fu's tone grew heavier, filled with immense grief.</p><p>The Storm Realm was comprised of outsiders, initially unaware of the dangers lurking in the unpredictable weather patterns of the Mist Sea, resulting in the loss of many friends.</p><p>Even after establishing some patterns, even the indigenous people couldn't guarantee completely accurate predictions. Therefore, casualties still occurred with each mist tide, with this one being the most devastating.</p><p>Because of the relationship between Qin Sang and Yun Youzi, Qianshan Bamboo Sea and Qing Yang Temple were inseparable, essentially one lineage.  With many powerful cultivators among the yokai, that mist waterfall almost wiped out half of Qing Yang Temple's fighting strength.</p><p>Qin Sang felt heavy-hearted.</p><p>He had thought that Qianshan Bamboo Sea, with his passed-down 《Tian Yao Lian Xing》technique, further refined after reaching the Greater Thousand World, aided by the Qing Ling Qi, would produce one or even several Divine Transformation experts. Instead, he received this tragic news.</p><p>No wonder he couldn't sense any of their auras in Lu Ye.</p><p>Gu Ya's experience proved that being swept away by the mist waterfall didn't necessarily mean death, but it was very likely to be flung to the ends of the earth. The Greater Thousand World was vast and boundless, making it unlikely they would ever meet again.</p><p>Losing so many experts at once would likely cripple Qianshan Bamboo Sea.</p><p>"Qianshan Bamboo Sea is currently being supported by Elder Liu and Elder Yu Nu. Because they also need to cooperate with the Northern Sea Yokai through Qianshan Bamboo Sea, after suffering heavy losses, the Glass Fairy and I fully supported Elder Yu Nu's cultivation. Elder Yu Nu also obtained some fortuitous opportunities, finally reaching the Divine Transformation stage."</p><p>Li Yu Fu’s following words brought Qin Sang some comfort.</p><p>Yu Nu was the white cat that had sold him the cave abode. Because she was personally enlightened by Yun Youzi and considered an equal to Qin Sang, Li Yu Fu always referred to her as Elder.</p><p>Being favored by Yun Youzi showed her exceptional talent, and she later also cultivated the 《Tian Yao Lian Xing》. Of course, her achievement was inseparable from her own efforts.</p><p>Good news finally arrived, easing Qin Sang's gloomy mood somewhat.</p><p>He understood this was fate, the work of Heaven; there was no blame to be placed on Li Yu Fu.  He asked Li Yu Fu to rise, then inquired about the situation of various individuals.</p><p>“Oh, is the Black Lion still alive?”</p><p>Li Yu Fu nodded.  “Disciple saw that the Black Lion Daoist friend did not wish to be constrained, and also wished to unite with the demon races against outside enemies.  Therefore, I discussed it with Shen junior brother and proactively released the Black Lion Daoist friend from his bonds.  The Black Lion Daoist friend stated that the Master Uncle had not mistreated him, and he did not wish to cause trouble for the Green Sheep Temple. He wishes to remain forever on friendly terms. He returned to the East Sea to gather his former subordinates. His position among the demon races is extremely important; he contributed greatly later when various parties united.”</p><p>Next, they discussed the sect's Daoist practices.</p><p>As Qin Sang expected, many people encountered difficulties after breaking through to the Transformation God stage, facing the predicament of having no path to further cultivation. Their cultivation was stuck at the early Transformation God stage; only a very small number reached the mid Transformation God stage.</p><p>And even more of the various sects' true inheritances were not even completely at the Nascent Soul stage.</p><p>Li Yu Fu said, “The crisis is imminent.  Faced with external pressure, and in order to quickly acquire the strength to resist the Chang You race, various parties were forced to share some of their treasured Daoist practices to examine them together. However, many problems were encountered.</p><p>“Some cultivation methods are complete, capable of cultivation to the Transformation God stage, but they have various biases or flaws, numerous obstacles that are difficult to overcome.  Ordinary people almost cannot cultivate to the realm described in the cultivation method.</p><p>“Some cultivation methods are extremely exquisite, and at a glance, they are known to be superior methods, but these methods are mostly incomplete fragments. Unless someone of exceptional talent can complete the cultivation method, it is even more difficult to cultivate…</p><p>“For various reasons, most people are unwilling to change to the first type of cultivation method, but instead think of studying the second type of cultivation method, hoping to gain inspiration and improve their sect's true inheritance.</p><p>“This disciple did likewise, studying several fragments of cultivation methods, and frequently seeking guidance from the Glass Fairy, hence my current achievements.”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded slightly; the facts matched his expectations.</p><p>Those fragments of cultivation methods were probably all related to the ancient secret realms like the Zi Wei Palace, and might contain superior Daoist practices no less significant than the *Zi Wei Sword Scripture* and the *Heavenly Demon Transformation*. However, only fragments were unearthed, which is truly frustrating.</p><p>If he had not had various opportunities, he would not have been able to collect the complete cultivation methods.</p><p>As for the second type, he had obtained a cultivation method called *All Heaven Demon Sound* long ago. The Green Sheep Temple had always had disciples cultivating it, but their progress was mediocre.</p><p>Despite this situation, Liuli managed to break through to the late Transformation God stage.  Although she is extremely talented, achieving this is still unexpectedly remarkable.</p><p>Qin Sang had entered the Xuan Tian Palace treasury to study Daoist practices. He remembered that the Xuan Tian Palace should not have this kind of great inheritance, and the same was true for the practices of the Listening Snow Tower. The inheritances of various schools in the Central Plains and the Wu Xiang Immortal Sect are higher, but they should not have true inheritances that directly point to the Void Refinement stage.</p><p>Perhaps Liuli had other opportunities. After all, there were great changes in the world at that time, and some secret realms unknown to the world might have been exposed. She was the first to break through to the Transformation God stage, and she could have been the first to enter and gain the opportunities inside.</p><p>For example, the Azure Spirit Qi was discovered by her.</p><p>At this time, Li Yu Fu thought of something and said, “The situation of the three races is different. The demon races' situation is actually better than that of the human and witch races. Their cultivation methods are incomplete, but they can continuously refine their bloodlines to improve themselves, although the speed may be slower.</p><p>“Especially those from the various departments of the Demon Sea, their ancestral lands still exist, and they seem to be able to gain benefits from them.  Entering the richly spiritual Great Thousand World, breakthroughs are easier. Some demon race strong cultivators have long lifespans, but have been trapped by bottlenecks for a long time. They have a strong foundation; once they break through, they will achieve great progress, their cultivation will advance rapidly, and experts will emerge one after another.</p><p>“If we don't count Glass Fairy, the demon races now have a tendency to surpass us.”</p><p>Qin Sang heard the implication in Li Yu Fu’s words. He glanced at him and nodded noncommittally.</p><p>The various races and sects of the Storm World united to resist outside enemies, but this does not mean there are no internal worries.  People have selfish desires, let alone other races. It's just that the enemy is too powerful, suppressing any internal conflict.</p><p>It can be imagined that the day the external enemy is defeated will be the beginning of internal division.</p><p>Qin Sang wanted to establish a Daoist field here, and naturally did not want to have so many hidden worries in his own Daoist field. Although he could suppress everyone with his strength, it would still be a hidden danger.</p><p>He can tolerate others having different intentions, even his own disciples may not be on the same side as him, but those who are deceitful and wavering must be purged.</p><p>This is also why he has not publicly appeared.</p><p>Next, the spearhead must be aimed both outward and inward. Therefore, he will not suppress the Chang You race for the time being.  First, seeing that the attack on the Storm World is hopeless, and facing the crisis of survival, they will inevitably seek external assistance. Even with his high cultivation, it is impossible for him to blockade an entire race. Second, this opponent is a perfect touchstone.</p><p>Thinking of this, Qin Sang said to Li Yu Fu, “Come with me for a walk around.”</p>
