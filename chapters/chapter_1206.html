<h1>Chapter 1198: Godly Markings (6000 words, today's update plus one chapter owed)</h1><p>Edge of the Abyss.</p><p>Qin Sang looked down into the chasm.</p><p>He descended slowly along the cliff face, entering the Abyss for the first time.</p><p>Unlike the Ancient Immortal Battlefield, the interior of the Abyss showed no signs of desolation; instead, the scenery was incredibly beautiful.</p><p>Lush green trees carpeted the slopes of the cliffs, like a layer of emerald carpet.</p><p>Various flowers and plants unseen in the mortal world bloomed vibrantly, vying for attention.  Waterfalls cascaded down like silken ribbons, sometimes converging, sometimes diverging, flowing into the abyss below.</p><p>Were it not for the occasional dangerous fragments of ancient prohibitions, it would truly seem like a fairyland.</p><p>This minor danger did not deter Qin Sang.</p><p>His speed increased, and he noticed the terrain becoming steeper, the scenery increasingly desolate and broken. After descending further, all traces of greenery vanished.</p><p>Bare rock and soil were exposed; dark, ink-black stones radiated a sinister aura, hinting at an unusual environment.</p><p>Qin Sang sensed a familiar icy chill, realizing he was approaching an area of concentrated earth-煞 energy.</p><p>This thought had barely crossed his mind when he saw wisps of earth-煞 energy emanating from the caves below.</p><p>The steep cliff face was riddled with countless irregular caves, filled with dense earth-煞 energy, deeply embedded within the cliff walls, even more intense than the Earth-Sun Cave.</p><p>Qin Sang activated his protective true energy, casually chose a cave entrance, and dashed inside.</p><p>With his powerful cultivation, Qin Sang endured the erosion of the earth-煞 energy, delving deep into the cliff, thoroughly searching the surroundings before returning empty-handed, confirming that the Tian Shi Sect ruins were not here.</p><p>After refining the煞 corpse, Qin Sang returned the same way.</p><p>Once his external avatar regained its Qi Refinement stage cultivation, Qin Sang took it to a market town.</p><p>His real body waited outside while he controlled the external avatar into the town.</p><p>Using his old identity, the avatar passed without hindrance, entering the market town and gathering with old acquaintances in a courtyard on the outskirts.</p><p>“Old Qi, didn't you say you had a new deal, a potential rookie? Why disappear for so long? Did you run into someone tough?”</p><p>Qi Lao’er was Qin Sang’s avatar, and his friends were all like-minded individuals from his past life.</p><p>This was spoken by a fierce-looking, powerfully built man with a somewhat gloating expression.</p><p>The avatar coldly snorted, “Wu Chang, you’ll have your day of reckoning. I'd like to see when you’ll be snatched away by a true grim reaper and dragged to the eighteenth level of hell.”</p><p>Wu Chang sneered, “When I reach the eighteenth level of hell, will your misdeeds be any less than mine, Old Qi?”</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>A beautiful woman in red, impatient, interrupted them, “I just hooked a little darling, we're in the middle of something, I didn’t come here to listen to your bickering. Old Qi, why did you gather us?”</p><p>The avatar and Wu Chang glared at each other but didn't continue their argument.</p><p>“I have a matter requiring your assistance, friends,”</p><p>The avatar paused, “I need help investigating someone. A hundred years ago, there was a Golden Core cultivator known as the ‘Corpse Ghost Immortal,’ said to be active near Near Scar Mountain. Any information related to this person will be handsomely rewarded.”</p><p>Wu Chang and the others exchanged glances.</p><p>“Old Qi, aren’t you tired of living? Trying to provoke a Golden Core cultivator?” Wu Chang looked at him like he was an idiot.</p><p>The beautiful woman pondered, looking intently at the avatar, “A Golden Core cultivator from a hundred years ago, with such a flamboyant name as ‘Corpse Ghost Immortal,’ we've never even heard of him. He’s probably dead by now.  Did you find some clue relating to some Golden Core inheritance or treasure?”</p><p>At this, the others' eyes lit up.</p><p>The avatar’s expression stiffened under their scrutinizing gazes, feeling immense pressure. He chuckled nervously, “I knew I couldn’t hide it from you! I've been working on this for days, my cultivation is too low, I can't handle this alone, so I invited some familiar friends. However, let me make it clear, we’re all close,  don't have any ulterior motives…”</p><p>“There’s really a Golden Core treasure? Looks like Old Qi’s luck has changed,”</p><p>Wu Chang rubbed his hands, thrilled.</p><p>The others were equally interested. After discussing, they dispersed. The avatar watched them leave, his eyes deep and unreadable. Soon, he left the courtyard himself and began his investigation.</p><p>After investigating extensively, he found nothing.</p><p>Qin Sang sent the avatar to another market town, with the same result.</p><p>Time erases all traces.  A Golden Core cultivator's mark is but a speck of dust in the river of time.  A mere hundred years, and it's already vanished.</p><p>The search yielded nothing. Qin Sang initiated Plan B, sending his avatar back to the market town with a zombie corpse comparable to a Foundation Establishment cultivator.  Unabashed, the avatar even summoned his former companions.</p><p>Feeling the immense pressure emanating from the avatar's powerful zombie, Wu Chang and the others cursed under their breath.</p><p>This old geezer clearly kept the spoils for himself!</p><p>While tricking them into investigating, he secretly took the Golden Core treasure. Otherwise, with his abilities, how could he have refined such a strong corpse?</p><p>Yet, outwardly, they all maintained respectful demeanors, just as they would before a true Foundation Establishment cultivator.</p><p>The meeting lasted the afternoon before the avatar finally dismissed them.</p><p>As Wu Chang walked into the shadows, he glanced back at the courtyard, his eyes flickering with uncertainty.  He scoffed inwardly, "His cultivation isn't even higher than mine.  A stroke of luck gets him a Foundation Establishment-level corpse, and he thinks he can make me work for him?  He's dreaming!"</p><p>Earlier, Qi Lao had proposed bringing them under his command, to search for treasure in Tian Hen together. A Foundation Establishment-level corpse would allow them to venture deeper into Tian Hen.</p><p>But Wu Chang didn't believe Qi Lao's goodwill for a second.  He was certain Qi Lao would abandon them without hesitation in any danger, perhaps even using them as shields.</p><p>At this thought, Wu Chang coldly snorted, and quickly walked in another direction.</p><p>Soon, he arrived near a rather elegant courtyard deep within the market town. After ensuring he wasn't followed, Wu Chang entered, head bowed, smiling obsequiously as he explained his purpose to the gatekeeper, before being ushered inside.</p><p>Moonlight, stars.</p><p>Central courtyard, jade table.</p><p>Fine wine, delicious food.</p><p>A cultivator dressed as a Daoist was drinking, his face flushed. Several beautiful female cultivators danced gracefully before him, their eyes alluring.</p><p>Wu Chang swallowed hard, filled with envy.</p><p>These female cultivators were higher in cultivation than him.  Clearly disciples of a major sect, they lived so freely and enjoyed themselves!  While he could mimic such displays, he could only find commoner women to dance for him at best, and dared not act so arrogantly within the heavily guarded city under Near-Scar Mountain's control. He was limited to remote areas, a world away from this man.</p><p>The gatekeeper announced his arrival.</p><p>The Daoist glanced over.</p><p>Wu Chang jolted, quickly standing straight.  The Daoist dismissed his attendants and said to him, "What is it? Come closer."</p><p>…</p><p>"Golden Core treasure?  Is this true?"</p><p>After Wu Chang recounted the events, the Daoist's drunkenness vanished.</p><p>Wu Chang nodded repeatedly, "Absolutely true. Qi Lao's Foundation Establishment corpse definitely came from there."</p><p>"Ghostly Corpse Immortal…"</p><p>The Daoist searched his memory, but couldn't recall such a person from a hundred years ago.</p><p>A thought suddenly struck him.  He shot a sword beam from his sleeve, instantly pressing it against Wu Chang's throat, sneering, "Qi Lao obtained the Golden Core treasure and still dares to flaunt it, meeting you openly? Using earth-sha Qi instead of Yin Qi for his corpse, does he think I'm a three-year-old? You're quite brave to scheme against me with such a clumsy ploy!"</p><p>"Senior, please understand! I wouldn't dare scheme against you or Near-Scar Mountain even if I had a hundred lives!"</p><p>Wu Chang trembled, defending himself repeatedly, "According to Qi Lao, his corpse is comparable to a mid-Foundation Establishment cultivator.  He likely felt that other seniors were deployed to the front lines, leaving the market town empty.  With the mountain lacking tigers, the monkeys reign supreme, so he dared to act so brazenly.  Qi Lao is still in the market town, Senior can investigate whether I'm lying…"</p><p>The Daoist's eyes narrowed, surprised, "A mid-Foundation Establishment corpse?"</p><p>He had only recently reached the Foundation Establishment stage himself, and wouldn’t be a match for such a corpse.  If Wu Chang truly meant him harm, he wouldn't have spoken so frankly.</p><p>"Hmph! I'll spare your life for now!"</p><p>The Daoist retracted his sword.  Seeing Wu Chang's expectant expression, he hummed, "Go and deal with Qi Lao. Don't reveal anything.  If the Golden Core treasure exists, you won't be unrewarded!"</p><p>"I obey!"</p><p>Wu Chang's face lit up, and he bowed and left.</p><p>The Daoist fell into contemplation, and decided to send a message to his sect, consulting with a few close senior brothers about whether there was someone with the Daoist name 'Ghostly Corpse Immortal'.</p><p>A Golden Core cultivator's treasure was very tempting.</p><p>Having his senior brothers come, even if it were a trap, they could simply break through it!</p><p>Qin Sang never expected that his avatar, before even showing off his zombie, would coincidentally and easily deliver the news to Near-Scar Mountain's disciples' ears.</p><p>Quickly, the Daoist received a reply.  After reading it, his face was filled with surprise.  "There really was a Golden Core cultivator named Shigui Xian, who could refine corpses using earth-sunder energy, and who had quite a connection with Master Wu. However, this person, who had only recently gained some fame, died on the battlefield. No wonder I'd never heard of him. It seems he may have foreseen something. Before being sent to the battlefield, he left his Daoist legacy here, which was obtained by Old Qi…"</p><p>The Daoist immediately sent a reply inviting his senior brother to assist, lest Old Qi react and escape with the treasure.</p><p>Two days later.</p><p>The transformed being, along with the refined corpse, left the market town.  Shortly after entering the deep mountains, he suddenly saw a blur, and a person appeared out of nowhere, blocking his path.</p><p>Just as he was about to turn back, another person blocked his rear.</p><p>Both were Foundation Establishment mid-stage cultivators!</p><p>Then, a figure emerged from behind an ancient tree – the Daoist.</p><p>Looking at the refined corpse beside the transformed being, his eyes gleamed.  He gently swayed his feather fan and said smoothly, "I hear that Daoist Qi is blessed by heaven and has obtained the legacy of a Golden Core cultivator. Would you allow us to observe it?"</p><p>The transformed being showed no fear, calmly replying, "We've been waiting for you."</p><p>Seeing the transformed being's fearless demeanor, the three felt very strange. Yet they had just carefully searched the surroundings and found nothing unusual.</p><p>Before they could react, they suddenly felt their bodies tighten, their vision darkening, and they were immobilized, instantly filled with terror.</p><p>Their opponent's power was terrifying; they hadn't even seen a shadow.</p><p>No matter how they struggled, the restraining force remained unmoved.</p><p>As they were terrified, a strange voice rang out, "You're quite bold, daring to track my disciple."</p><p>One of them managed to compose himself, realizing he could speak, and repeatedly pleaded, "We are blind and ignorant, unaware that Daoist Qi is your disciple. Please, senior, show mercy, and forgive us for not causing any major trouble. We are willing to return to Jinhen Mountain and offer all the treasures in our cave to apologize to Daoist Qi."</p><p>They thought they had offended Old Qi.</p><p>"Heh, don't threaten me with Jinhen Mountain. I'm not easily scared. However, for Jinhen Mountain's sake, answer my few questions, and I'll spare your lives."</p><p>The three felt slightly relieved.  Their opponent still feared their sect, and they quickly agreed.</p><p>A short while later, Qin Sang flew out of the forest with the transformed being.</p><p>The three were not killed, but Qin Sang had used a Golden Core level restriction to imprison them in the forest. When they would be released depended on when Jinhen Mountain found them.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't want too much trouble.</p><p>Killing three true disciples would certainly not leave Jinhen Mountain unmoved.</p><p>It was a troubled time. As long as no one died, Jinhen Mountain likely wouldn't aggressively pursue a mere Golden Core legacy and provoke a mysterious opponent.</p><p>"If we can't find out any more, I'll have to make a scene, raiding the various forces near Jinhen Mountain and forcing them to answer one by one."</p><p>Looking west, Qin Sang thought to himself, "So Shigui Xian's real surname is Chen, and he came from Nanyin Mountain Range west of Tianhen.  Unfortunately, the Wu surname Golden Core cultivator who was friendly with Shigui Xian is currently fighting on the front lines and can't be questioned in the short term. I can only go to the Nanyin Mountain Range first. None of these three have ever seen Tan Hao, and I don't know if Tan Hao has been here, or went directly to the Nanyin Mountain Range."</p><p>One of the three Jinhen Mountain disciples had served as a Daoist attendant to the Wu surname Golden Core cultivator. He was present when Shigui Xian visited and heard the Wu surname cultivator call Shigui Xian "Daoist Chen" and knew that he had previously cultivated in the Nanyin Mountain Range.</p><p>Qin Sang suspected that Shigui Xian had only come to Jinhen Mountain to absorb earth-sunder energy and refine corpses after obtaining the Tian Shi Sect legacy. He decided to try his luck in the Nanyin Mountain Range.</p><p>Without delay, he set off immediately.</p><p>Crossing Tianhen again, Qin Sang headed straight for the Nanyin Mountain Range.</p><p>By noon on the third day, Qin Sang arrived, having already investigated the forces in the Nanyin Mountain Range along the way.</p><p>The Nanyin Mountain Range had a peculiar shape.</p><p>On the Tianhen border, numerous peaks formed a semicircle, extending outward in concentric circles.</p><p>This place was dangerous and full of treacherous waters. There were no top-tier sects nearby, mostly independent cultivators, though these forces had more or less intricate connections with the outside top-tier sects.</p><p>Qin Sang sent out the transformed being, using the same trick.</p><p>Unfortunately, although he lured out a few unscrupulous individuals, none knew anything about Shigui Xian.</p><p>Qin Sang knew this wouldn't work, so he directly approached the various forces in the Nanyin Mountain Range.</p><p>Among these forces were cultivation families, independent cultivator alliances, and branch sects.</p><p>Qin Sang investigated, finding the protective formations of the cultivation families and the Loose Cultivator Alliance relatively weak.</p><p>One cultivation family's formation had a significant flaw, imperceptible to others but evident to her spirit butterfly companion.  This allowed for stealthy infiltration, saving considerable trouble.</p><p>The Li Family.</p><p>A family producing two Golden Core cultivators would normally signify prosperity.</p><p>However, in wartime, even prosperous families prioritize survival.</p><p>Fortunately, the Li Family fared better than those with only one Golden Core cultivator.  Not all their Golden Core cultivators were conscripted; at least one remained, allowing for rotation.</p><p>Li Yutian had just been relieved by his grandfather from the front lines and returned home for recuperation.</p><p>The memories of the carnage still haunted him. Even Golden Core cultivators faced imminent danger and death on the chaotic battlefield.</p><p>The only positive was witnessing high-level confrontations and experiencing constant combat, leading to rapid improvement.</p><p>He couldn't understand why the Yuan Ying masters forsook comfortable lives to invade the Tianxing Alliance; the Crime Abyss was not yet depleted of resources.</p><p>Outside his cave, two maidservants stood attendance.</p><p>Suddenly, Li Yutian's voice echoed from within, "Inform everyone, this ancestor has gained new insights and will be entering seclusion for a breakthrough.  Under no circumstances are you to disturb me."</p><p>The two maids rejoiced. Their ancestor was already at the peak of the early Golden Core stage; another breakthrough would give the family two mid-stage Golden Core cultivators.  Moreover, given his youth, Yuan Ying cultivation was a real possibility.</p><p>The maids curtsied and withdrew, noticing the glow of the newly activated restriction on the cave door without suspicion.</p><p>Inside the cave, Li Yutian stared in horror at a cloaked figure that appeared out of thin air.</p><p>"Yuan Ying master!"</p><p>Overwhelmed by the terrifying pressure, despair washed over him.</p><p>Qin Sang appeared ghostlike before Li Yutian, placing a hand on his head and performing a soul search.</p><p>Knowing this man had slaughtered countless cultivators from the Two Realms Alliance on the battlefield, Qin Sang showed no mercy.  After obtaining the information she sought, she erased Li Yutian's body and all traces of her presence, then silently departed.</p><p>The Li family remained oblivious.</p><p>Only upon the return of their other ancestor, who forcibly opened the cave, was Li Yutian's disappearance discovered.  There were no clues; he seemed to have vanished into thin air, becoming a major unsolved mystery in the Nan Yin Mountains.</p><p>Afterwards, Qin Sang and Pang Ji separately created several more unsolved cases, targeting Foundation Establishment cultivators.</p><p>Corroborating various pieces of information, Qin Sang gained a clearer picture of the "Ghostly Corpse Immortal."</p><p>His name was Chen Heng.</p><p>He was originally an unremarkable loose cultivator, like many low-level cultivators, barely making a living in the Tianhen region.  Then, one day, he inexplicably gained incredible advancement in cultivation.</p><p>He gradually broke through to Golden Core stage and became a Golden Core cultivator.</p><p>He practiced wood-attribute cultivation methods, possessing exceptionally pure wood-attribute spiritual power and extraordinary abilities, gaining a minor reputation in the Nan Yin Mountains.</p><p>Li Yutian's memories revealed a considerable apprehension towards Chen Heng, who was solitary and vindictive.  However, it was clear that at that time, Chen Heng had no connection with corpse cultivation practices, nor the title "Ghostly Corpse Immortal."</p><p>A hundred years ago, following an unknown event, Chen Heng suddenly left the Nan Yin Mountains and disappeared without a trace, with many speculating he perished.</p><p>This proved to be the case.</p><p>Qin Sang concluded that Chen Heng obtained the corpse refinement techniques of the Heavenly Corpse Sect during his time away from the Nan Yin Mountains and his travels near the Near Scar Mountain.</p><p>However, Qin Sang still lacked leads on the Heavenly Corpse Sect.</p><p>Chen Heng had no family in the Nan Yin Mountains. If he obtained the corpse refinement techniques elsewhere, the trail might end here. Qin Sang could only return to the Tianxing Plateau and seek information from the Golden Core cultivator near Scar Mountain.</p><p>Since she was already there, Qin Sang decided to continue investigating in the Nan Yin Mountains, sifting through the memories of Li Yutian and others for significant events in the years before Chen Heng's departure, such as the discovery of ancient ruins.</p><p>Ultimately, Qin Sang pinpointed four locations, all deep within the Tianhen region.</p><p>Three were ancient restricted sites sealed by ancient formations; ruins where ancient treasures had once surfaced, causing a sensation.</p><p>The fourth was located in the deepest part of the Tianhen region.  For unknown reasons, there had once been a violent eruption from the abyss, sweeping across the ancient restrictions.  Many cultivators searching for treasures in the Tianhen region were caught unprepared, either killed or injured.</p><p>Later, powerful cultivators from the Nan Yin Mountains attempted to investigate, but the depths proved too dangerous, leaving the cause a mystery.</p><p>With this information, Qin Sang decided to personally explore the Tianhen region.</p><p>A cultivator of Qin Sang's level could easily enter the secret realm; no preparations were needed.  He flew down the cliff face without stopping.</p><p>Many cultivators risked their lives searching for treasures within the Heavenly Scar.  They were completely unaware of Qin Sang passing close by.</p><p>Deeper into the Heavenly Scar, the light dimmed, and danger lurked at every turn.  Qin Sang carefully avoided two ancient barriers.</p><p>Soon, he reached the first secret realm.  Its entrance, a crack in the mountainside, pulsed with vibrant light.  After the recent upheaval, chaotic ancient barriers had resealed the opening.</p><p>Tianmu the butterfly rested on Qin Sang's shoulder, its wings pointed towards the entrance. After observing for a while, Qin Sang sensed Tianmu's thoughts, smiled, and then, with perfect precision, swung his Golden Sinking Sword.</p><p>The ancient barriers were activated, converging on the sword light. The mountain wall shook, sending stones flying.  A fissure appeared in the barriers, and Qin Sang slipped through.</p><p>He found himself beside a dried-up lake. The surrounding palaces were ruins, a landscape of broken walls and rubble.  Clearly, the place had been thoroughly looted.</p><p>Qin Sang carefully searched the area with his spiritual sense, leaving no inch unexplored.  He found no trace of the Heaven Corpse Sect. Undeterred, he left the secret realm and flew towards his next destination.</p><p>The second secret realm sealed a mountain range, where ancient palaces stood, hinting at former glory. Qin Sang unexpectedly found a rare medicinal herb, but still no sign of the Heaven Corpse Sect.</p><p>He pressed on, reaching the third secret realm. Its entrance was a chaotic space, even showing spatial rifts, ravaged by colliding ancient barriers.  Working together, Qin Sang and Tianmu painstakingly deciphered the barriers, finally locating a fragment of the ruined secret realm – to no avail.</p><p>"Only the fourth location remains," he murmured.</p><p>Qin Sang looked down into the abyss, into an endless darkness.  Guided by Tianmu, he plunged downwards without hesitation.</p><p>Two hours later, he finally found the source of the previous energy surge.  Surprisingly, beyond the most dangerous area, lay a vast wasteland with unusually few fragments of ancient barriers.</p><p>This unusual sight piqued Qin Sang's suspicion. He ordered Tianmu to use its full power, and then cautiously began to search.</p><p>The wasteland was larger than he anticipated.  It took an entire incense stick's worth of time before he reached the far edge.</p><p>Suddenly, Qin Sang’s gaze fixed on a smooth, mirror-like stone wall.  Moments later, his pupils dilated, his face filled with shock.  "This aura… runes!  The unique restrictions of the Witch Clan!"</p>
