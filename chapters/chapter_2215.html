<h1>Chapter 2205: The Summons</h1><p>Both parties exchanged identities.</p><p>The sword-wielding Daoist, Zhan Yan, hailed from Bi Chen Xuan; the short-tempered Daoist, Zhang Yan, came from Jin Xia Mountain;  Xu Mu was a disciple of Yi Xing Mountain; and finally, there was Jing Zhen, a female Daoist from Xing Yue Wu.</p><p>Qin Sang noticed that their cooperation was merely nominal, with varying degrees of closeness between them. Only Zhan Yan could control Zhang Yan's temper.</p><p>While Zhang Yan's suggestion was blunt, it now seemed to be the only option.  They didn't know that Qin Sang had just captured one of their opponents, but hadn't extracted any useful information.</p><p>Naturally, Qin Sang didn't reveal this. He also suspected that the powerful disciples, once they arrived, might receive guidance from the talismans.</p><p>Everyone exchanged glances; none had a better plan.</p><p>Zhan Yan, being cautious, questioned Qin Sang further. However, Qin Sang's answers, carefully considered beforehand, were flawless.</p><p>After their discussion, they left the valley to search for the powerful disciples.  Lacking knowledge of their movements, they could only improvise upon finding them.</p><p>Once, this was a vast plain, with green mountains and clear waters, rarely visited by humans. Now, only the secluded realm itself had undergone a dramatic transformation; the outside scenery remained untouched.</p><p>Within the realm, storms and radiant lights raged, seemingly poised to break through the boundaries and destroy everything.</p><p>According to Zhan Yan and the others, the scene had been the same since their arrival. They initially thought the chaos would continue expanding, destroying the entire island, blooming in the heart lake, until it merged with the radiant lights outside.  Unexpectedly, an invisible force seemed to restrain it, preventing its spread.</p><p>This was why they hadn't given up. They guessed that the realm's power was preventing the expansion of the radiant lights and storms, meaning the realm wasn't completely destroyed, and they still might have a chance.</p><p>Flying along the edge of the realm, the distinct boundary between the inside and outside was clearly visible.</p><p>Concerned about unforeseen events, the six decided against splitting up, opting to travel together. Zhan Yan, the strongest and skilled in divination arts, led the way.</p><p>Although Qin Sang's cultivation was lower, he possessed the crucial information, so he also walked in front. To prevent his lower cultivation from exposing their presence to the enemy, Jing Zhen cast a concealment spell on him.</p><p>Thus, Qin Sang and Zhan Yan flew in the lead, while the others followed far behind.</p><p>The area was far more expansive than they'd imagined. They flew over countless peaks, yet still found no trace of the powerful disciples.</p><p>Upon discovering the changes in the realm, Qin Sang and Liu immediately sought out Zhan Yan and the others, losing little time.  They only spent some time battling the celestial children. Logically, before the signs appeared, the powerful disciples were wandering aimlessly around the heart lake, at varying distances and speeds. Surely, some were lagging behind!</p><p>Qin Sang, patient, flew onward, his expression shifting subtly. Zhan Yan, with his sharper senses, noticed sooner.</p><p>“Someone!”</p><p>Zhan Yan signaled Qin Sang to stop, simultaneously informing the four behind them via telepathy.</p><p>The two landed stealthily in a forest, surveying the distance. They saw only endless hills and fields, but sensed an unusual aura.</p><p>“At least four distinct auras!” Zhan Yan's expression darkened.</p><p>He raised a finger, drawing a circle in front of him, conjuring a circular mirror. The mirror reflected a scene of a forest.</p><p>The mountains were hazy and lush, yet no one was visible.</p><p>“Among them are top-tier experts. I dare not directly scrutinize them with my arts. What are they doing here?” Zhan Yan questioned.</p><p>Qin Sang secretly admired the technique. The mirror didn't reflect their figures, but it revealed the true nature of the forest, where the actual scene was concealed by an array.</p><p>“Perhaps they also lack a way to enter?” Qin Sang guessed, a sense of foreboding settling upon him.</p><p>If so, their situation would be dire, and they might have to abandon this opportunity.</p><p>Zhan Yan's face fell. The right to enter the Yi Ren tribe's sacred land wasn't given freely. They had to defeat their rivals within their sects.  Some sects lacked the qualification themselves and had to compete with others from different Daoist lineages.  After so much effort, were they to end it all so anticlimactically?</p><p>After some thought, Zhan Yan said: “I have another method to peek inside this array, perhaps uncovering some information. However, it might alert them. Some preparations are needed…”</p><p>Then, Zhan Yan used telepathy, instructing Liu and the others to retreat to a distance. He also instructed Qin Sang to hold a talisman and go to another location.</p><p>Everyone complied. Qin Sang, carrying the talisman, moved far away from Zhan Yan, to a mountain stream, activating the talisman. The talisman burned without fire, transforming into a transparent flame, shifting in his palm.</p><p>Simultaneously, Zhan Yan exerted his full strength to employ his secret technique.</p><p>Shortly after, Qin Sang received a warning from Zan Yan.  His eyes narrowed, and the fireball he wielded suddenly split, revealing faint transparent figures scattering in all directions. Zan Yan himself vanished from his spot.</p><p>Meanwhile, Zan Yan put away his orb and left hastily.</p><p>Moments later, waves of fluctuation appeared above the mountain forest, followed by several figures emerging.  They carefully sensed their surroundings, puzzled, then split up to investigate, ultimately finding nothing.</p><p>"What masterful technique! Which cultivator is spying on us?" a raspy voice asked.</p><p>A female cultivator responded, "The other party is extremely cautious; their abilities are indiscernible. They probably noticed we don't recognize each other and decided to look for other cultivators instead."</p><p>"Everyone!"</p><p>A heavy voice boomed from within their group, "You all know Brother Luo's abilities. His perception is impeccable.  The other party's stealth and skill... could this be what Cultivator Qi predicted?"</p><p>Upon hearing this, everyone's expressions darkened.</p><p>At this time, Qin Sang and Zan Yan, the source of the commotion, had already escaped to rendezvous with Liuli and the others.</p><p>"What happened?" Everyone looked at Zan Yan.</p><p>Zan Yan said, "There are top-tier experts inside; they even managed to avoid my detection. I just glimpsed some conversations inside the formation before being discovered..."</p><p>He then recounted the conversations without reservation.</p><p>Most were ordinary exchanges. The most valuable snippet revealed that powerful members of the Yi Ren tribe were gathering in several locations, belonging to different factions, considering which side to join or even forming their own.</p><p>While the full picture remained unclear, this fragment offered valuable insight. It seemed these Yi Ren powerhouses were also blocked outside, awaiting some kind of opportunity.</p><p>What that opportunity was, however, remained unknown.</p><p>Hearing this news, the group's mood turned heavier, a mixture of hope and worry.  They were hopeful due to infighting within the Yi Ren tribe, giving them a chance to fish in troubled waters.  But they were worried because the tribe members possessed protective talismans bestowed by their ancestors, allowing them to remain in the Heart Lake for an extended period.  This was unlike their group, who could only stay for two more days before having to leave the island and complete the task given by the Nascent Soul cultivator, and escape the Heart Lake.</p><p>Whether they would have another chance to enter was uncertain.</p><p>After a brief discussion, the group continued toward one of the gathering points.</p><p>After a rapid flight, they sensed a chaotic aura ahead. Unlike the previous group, these cultivators were completely unconcealed, sparsely scattered across the surrounding peaks.</p><p>Qin Sang and Zan Yan landed in the distance, observing secretly. At that moment, ripples appeared within the rosy glow, and two figures shot out.</p><p>One was simply out of breath, while the other's robes were torn, causing a wave of good-natured laughter.  Clearly, they had attempted a forceful entry and failed.</p><p>"As I feared," Zan Yan sighed.</p><p>Even these disciples of powerful cultivators were helpless here; it seemed they had to give up!</p><p>At this point, Qin Sang also recognized some figures—the black-robed cultivator who had hunted him, and the two women who had arrived later.</p><p>The three were still together, seated on a rock.</p><p>Seeing the other two's disheveled state, the black-robed cultivator showed no amusement; he kept looking outwards with a worried expression.</p><p>A strange glint flashed in Qin Sang's eyes. He wondered whether this person had spread news of his deeds.  It was best not to reveal his identity here, as it would invite suspicion from both sides; concealment was crucial.</p><p>Shortly after, Qin Sang and Zan Yan quietly withdrew, proceeding to another location, only to find a similar situation—no opportunity to attack, leaving them with no choice but to lay an ambush.</p><p>"These people seem to have a way to communicate; they're calling for reinforcements.  If we choose the wrong target, we'll face a united assault," Zan Yan worried.</p><p>The more intelligence they gathered, the more disadvantageous their situation seemed. Regardless, they pressed on, setting up their plan. However, after two days of waiting, they still had no chance to strike!</p><p>Unbeknownst to them, this was thanks to Qin Sang and Liuli.</p><p>Previously, the immortal boy, in order to assassinate Qin Sang, had contacted several experts. Only the black-robed cultivator and a man in green robes had agreed.  Those aware of their actions noticed only the black-robed cultivator arrived, while the other two were missing.  They inevitably inquired about this absence.</p><p>Though uncomfortable, the black-robed cultivator knew he couldn't keep it hidden forever. He vaguely explained that the immortal boy and Tang Yi (names altered for fluency) had disappeared without a trace.</p><p>In fact, the black-robed monk still couldn't believe that Xian Tong and Tang Yi had died at the hands of a mid-stage Nascent Soul cultivator.  The news spread quickly, causing quite a stir. No one believed they could be killed by someone of that cultivation level. A more believable explanation readily presented itself:  the Panlong Cave held a secret, the island undoubtedly harbored unknown dangers.  Why else would the ancestor send them down the mountain, bestowing talismans and defensive treasures?</p><p>Fear gripped everyone. Some frantically used secret techniques to warn friends, spreading the news even faster. Consequently, many arriving later chose to wait outside and travel in groups. Only those supremely confident in their abilities dared to enter alone.</p><p>The deadline loomed, hope dwindling.</p><p>However, Qin Sang and Liuli weren't entirely without progress.  They made new discoveries. The chaos in the secret realm seemed to be subsiding, a fact confirmed by conversations between the Yi Ren cultivators, who were also waiting for things to calm down.</p><p>"No chance left!"</p><p>Zan Yan's tone was heavy. He instinctively looked up at the sky, only to realize they were enveloped in thick fog.</p><p>The radiant light and storm hadn't subsided, yet they could wait no longer, leaving them to sigh in frustration.</p><p>"Whether anyone else can enter depends on their own skills!" Zhang Yan said, his face grim, waving his wide sleeves.</p><p>"We take our leave! Fellow Daoists, until we meet again!"</p><p>Xu Mu and Jing Zhen bowed and departed.</p><p>The others then dispersed, their plan having utterly failed.  Time was pressing. Qin Sang and Liuli, without hesitation, used escape techniques to flee the island, speaking little on their journey.</p><p>Two streaks of light sped across the wide lake.</p><p>Qin Sang and Liuli could only accept the situation, but hadn't given up entirely.  Since the chaos in the secret realm was subsiding, if they could somehow return to the Heart Lake, they still had a chance!</p><p>They retraced their steps at top speed, following the route marked on their map. To save time, they forcefully navigated some perilous areas.</p><p>Working in perfect harmony, they navigated the dangers without incident, venturing deeper into the Heart Lake.</p><p>Passing through the middle of a secret realm, a vast expanse of lake water opened before them.</p><p>The surface was calm. Suddenly, the jade bracelets on their wrists vibrated, emitting a bright light.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>The bracelets flew into the air, radiating dazzling light, as if drawn towards something, about to pierce the sky.</p><p>Through the bracelets, Qin Sang and Liuli sensed a distant response, yet its origin remained unknown.</p><p>Liuli restrained the bracelets, while Qin Sang rapidly executed dozens of hand seals, activating the bracelets' restrictions. He discovered that the inside of each bracelet was like a bottomless pit, greedily consuming his true energy.</p><p>Finally, the bracelets seemed 'satisfied', erupting in golden light.</p><p>Qin Sang narrowed his eyes. The bracelets vanished, transforming into golden rings.  The rings rapidly expanded, sweeping outward, exceeding their field of vision in an instant and disappearing.</p><p>Where the golden light passed, the mist churned, and an invisible force spread.</p><p>The task proved easier than expected. After waiting a while to ensure nothing unusual occurred, Qin Sang and Liuli quietly left.</p><p>With their prior experience, the return journey was far smoother.  They traveled without stopping, arriving at the edge of the Heart Lake well before the ten-day deadline.</p><p>From afar, Qin Sang and Liuli saw the island they'd departed from, teeming with people, most already back.</p><p>Suddenly, Qin Sang signaled Liuli to stop, frowning at the lake.</p><p>'Splash!'</p><p>A figure emerged from the water.  Seeing Qin Sang, he bowed politely, "May I ask if you are Master Qin?"</p><p>"Who are you? Why are you stopping me?"</p><p>Qin Sang frowned, observing the stranger, a young man he'd never seen before.</p><p>The young man broke into a smile, "I am…"</p><p>He was interrupted by a whistling sound.</p><p>Qin Sang looked up, surprised. It was Hong Yue, heading straight for them.</p><p>"You are Master Qin?"</p><p>His voice preceded him, "Lord Hong Tian requests your presence!"</p>
