<h1>Chapter 2050: Yuan, Kong, Sheng, Zu</h1><p>Merit.</p><p>It sounds similar to the Daoist Court's merit, but it's even more convenient to use.  Exchanging Daoist Court merit for treasures requires going to the Heavenly Pivot Academy or the North Pole Exorcism Academy to have it processed by a Daoist official.  In Qianzhou, one simply sets up an altar on the spot, and the treasures arrive.</p><p>Could the Merit system be an imitation of the Daoist Court?</p><p>Behind the Merit system, there must be an entity similar to the Divine Court; otherwise, it wouldn't be so miraculous. The Divine Court allows for receiving offerings, transmitting teachings, summoning deities, and now, apparently, material objects.  It should have other uses as well, working similarly to the Daoist Court but with very different consequences.</p><p>With the decline of the Divine Court and the Daoist Court forced into seclusion, the Greater Thousand World seems to tacitly approve of Qianzhou's implementation of the Merit system.</p><p>“If Merit is as convenient as you say, why not extend it to the Eight Great Heavenly States, or even the entire human territory?” Qin Sang feigned confusion and asked.</p><p>Master Songfeng chuckled, seemingly amused by Qin Sang's naiveté.  "Regardless of whether Merit has only advantages and no drawbacks, it's said that to enter this system, a strand of vital energy must be taken. Only then can one receive Merit.  Although it's just an ordinary strand of vital energy, and no inconvenience has been reported, who can guarantee there are no hidden dangers? Moreover, once we cultivators become accustomed to Merit and rely on it for everything, we will be controlled by it.  At that time, Merit, or whoever controls Merit, wouldn't they be able to dominate all cultivators?  We are of low cultivation, even if the sky falls, it won't fall on us, so we can afford to be unconcerned. But those powerful cultivators would never tolerate such a thing.”</p><p>“A strand of vital energy is all it takes?”</p><p>Qin Sang pondered.  Qianzhou's Merit system is indeed quite different from the Daoist and Divine Courts. He wondered what exactly this 'vital energy' referred to. If it involved spiritual sense, he would absolutely refuse.</p><p>Even if it isn't as Qin Sang suspected, the Greater Thousand World has countless mysterious techniques; perhaps this would lead to karmic entanglements, unknowingly placing one under someone else's control.</p><p>He sensed a great secret behind the Merit system, perhaps related to the dispute between Mahayana and Hinayana Buddhism, causing him to realize that his previous observations had been superficial.</p><p>Their conversation didn't last long. Getting to the main point, Master Songfeng began describing the item he wished to refine to Qin Sang.</p><p>“I haven't named the spirit array yet, but the object to be contained has a reference: our sect's Supreme Yuan Order.  It will be called the Supreme Yuan Banner. If I fail this time, my senior brothers will mock me for a thousand years.  If I succeed, I will mock them for a thousand years. Elder Qin, please be very careful.”</p><p>Seeing Master Songfeng's serious expression, Qin Sang glanced outside the cave dwelling, sighing inwardly that it was indeed good to have a powerful backing. He noted how much importance was placed on petty squabbles among sect members. Some called it a childlike heart, but those cultivators from small sects and independent cultivators would never possess such a mentality.</p><p>He, too, had a powerful backing, but now he couldn't rely on it and was instead facing repercussions, walking on eggshells.</p><p>Qin Sang had never seen the Supreme Yuan Order, but he listened attentively to Master Songfeng's description of the Supreme Yuan Banner. He believed they had a 70% chance of success.  Master Songfeng was overjoyed upon hearing this and immediately pulled Qin Sang into the inner chamber.</p><p>A ground fire furnace had already been set up, and all the necessary spirit materials were prepared. Qin Sang dissuaded Master Songfeng from immediately starting the furnace and discussed the Supreme Yuan Banner further.</p><p>Master Songfeng already had a clear plan for this treasure, so Qin Sang couldn't alter the treasure itself but could offer suggestions on the refining method, which greatly benefited Master Songfeng, who exclaimed that he had found the right helper.</p><p>For some time, flashes of fire occasionally appeared in the cave dwelling, and the island occasionally trembled, arousing the curiosity of others. However, the island's protective array was activated, preventing anyone from intruding. After a brief look, everyone dispersed, eventually becoming accustomed to it.</p><p>One day, a joyous burst of laughter erupted from the cave dwelling. If not for the protective array, it would have startled the entire Qiandie Divine Abode.</p><p>Qin Sang smiled and returned to the front hall, pouring himself a glass of water, savoring it slowly.</p><p>After a moment, Master Songfeng also emerged, looking weary yet refreshed. With a flick of his sleeve, a purple-gold light flew out. “This jar of Nine-Reed Earth is yours, Elder Qin!”</p><p>Qin Sang accepted it, seeing a purple-gold gourd. Opening it, a strong earthy spiritual energy rushed out, revealing a swirling mass of yellow-brown energy—the Nine-Reed Earth!</p><p>“Thank you, Master,” Qin Sang bowed, putting it away.</p><p>Songfeng Jushi waved his hand, his eyes flashing.  "Without Elder Qin's all-out assistance, this treasure would never have been refined so easily. I should be thanking you."  He paused, then asked, "I recall Elder Qin mentioning a trip to Lansha Prefecture?"</p><p>Qin Sang nodded. "That is my intention."</p><p>"I happen to have a letter for a Daoist friend in Lansha Prefecture. Could Elder Qin perhaps deliver it?" Songfeng Jushi inquired.</p><p>Qin Sang's mind stirred.  If it were simply delivering a letter, Qie Die Divine Abode certainly wouldn't lack communication channels; why ask an outsider like himself? This clearly held deeper meaning. Songfeng Jushi, mindful of Qin Sang's help in refining the Taiyuan Banner, was using this as a pretext to introduce him to influential figures in Lansha Prefecture, fostering goodwill.</p><p>Of course, the letter was merely a stepping stone; how far things went depended on him. Still, it undeniably gave him a chance to leverage a powerful connection.</p><p>With this in mind, Qin Sang readily agreed.</p><p>Songfeng Jushi channeled his true essence, quickly writing a letter which he handed to Qin Sang.  The two then left the cave abode.</p><p>Watching Songfeng Jushi excitedly go to show off his achievement to his fellow disciples, Qin Sang shook his head and, summoning his flying light, continued on his journey.</p><p>He arrived in Wumian City without stopping. Like other immortal cities in Kan Prefecture, Wumian City was prosperous but lacked refinement; the spiritual energy within was far inferior to Qie Die Divine Abode.</p><p>Having corresponded with the two women beforehand, Qin Sang knew where they were staying and quickly found their residence – a mansion built by a spiritual lake, backed by immortal mountains and facing the lake, surrounded by lotuses and willows.  While not a place of spiritual cultivation, it was a rare tranquil spot in the city.</p><p>The gate carried a plaque that read: Xuling Manor.</p><p>Finding the gate closed and the manor seemingly deserted, Qin Sang flicked his finger, sending out a beam of spiritual light.</p><p>The light activated the protective formation, and a figure hurried out – Gu Ya.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang, Gu Ya was overjoyed. "Senior Qin, you've finally arrived!"</p><p>After entering the manor, Qin Sang didn't sense Su Nu's presence.  "Su Nu isn't here?"</p><p>Gu Ya replied, "Senior Su Nu has been in Lansha Prefecture. My cultivation is too low to assist Senior Qin, so Senior Su Nu instructed me to manage things here in Wumian City while she investigated in Lansha Prefecture, sending messages periodically. Six months ago, Senior Su Nu sent a message saying she had a matter to attend to, taking anywhere from six months to a year."</p><p>Gu Ya produced a message token and presented it.</p><p>Qin Sang examined it. The message didn't specify the matter, but he trusted Su Nu's intelligence and wasn't worried.</p><p>After questioning Gu Ya further, he learned that she'd remained in Wumian City and knew little of Su Nu's plans, needing Su Nu's return to know what information she’d gathered.</p><p>Su Nu should be sending word soon, Qin Sang reasoned. He decided to wait a while before going to Lansha Prefecture.</p><p>He went into the inner courtyard.  Another lake, rich in spiritual energy, lay within.  On a small island at its center, several young men and women sat in pavilions or meditated on rocks, practicing some spell.</p><p>Upon noticing the group, the young people hastily rose, standing in a neat row.  As they approached the island, they bowed deeply.  "Greetings, Grandmaster."</p><p>After Gu Ya, the Xuling sect had continued for many generations. Gu Ya established this branch but hadn't taken disciples, instead using the title of Grandmaster for this manor.</p><p>Qin Sang noticed an older person among the youths, the highest cultivator, a Golden Core stage practitioner.</p><p>"Senior Su Nu instructed me to find some people, preferably those rooted in Wumian City, to serve as a contact point. After much deliberation, I decided to take on a few disciples here, passing on the lineage, as my own descendants would be trustworthy and would allow the sect to grow. Since I wasn't sure of Senior Su Nu's intentions, I took the liberty of teaching our sect’s methods here, establishing this Xuling Manor to teach them the art of refining," Gu Ya explained, indicating the old man and a young man beside him. "This grandfather and grandson are named Peng. Their family possesses incomplete Daoist techniques, which allowed them to enter the immortal world.  Seeing their aptitude, I took them in. The others were also carefully selected."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded. With this Xuling lineage, he wouldn’t need to make other arrangements. However, these youngsters were still weak. After settling in, he would need to send a strong cultivator to oversee them.</p><p>"I too have benefited greatly from studying the Xuling sect’s methods. You must diligently cultivate and not disappoint the Grandmaster.  As we’ve just met, I’ll pass on a technique. Once your cultivation improves, study it often, comparing it to your sect’s techniques, to gain deeper understanding,” Qin Sang said, flicking his fingers. Several green lights shot into the young people's foreheads.</p><p>They trembled slightly, feeling a profound and extremely arcane secret technique enter their minds. Their current cultivation levels were insufficient to comprehend it fully.</p><p>Gu Ya's face lit up with surprise upon seeing the technique, realizing its remarkable compatibility with the Xu Ling sect's alchemic arts.  Many of the Xu Ling sect's practices rely on alchemy; advancements in alchemy greatly benefit their cultivation, possibly even elevating the sect's techniques to a new level.</p><p>After ascension, the Xu Ling sect, like many sects in the Storm World, faced the awkward situation of having advanced cultivation but lacking further cultivation methods.</p><p>Without ascended cultivators returning to the lower realms, even the prominent sects in the Storm World didn't possess orthodox methods beyond the Nascent Soul stage. Of course, exceptions existed for those bringing significant legacies from the Sword Pavilion.</p><p>Gu Ya had harbored this idea for a while, lacking the opportunity, until Qin Sang conceived of it.  She recalled her master's promise to let Qin Sang peruse the Xu Ling sect's scriptures, sighing that past events had paved the way for the present.</p><p>"This is the upper part; this is the lower," Qin Sang handed Gu Ya a jade slip.</p><p>The Xu Ling sect originally only had Yuan Ying-level inheritances.  Creating this technique for them was a simple task for Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't help but ponder the future of sects like the Xu Ling sect. He couldn't personally develop methods for each, so he needed a universal solution, offering a choice for those unwilling to see their path cut short—establishing altars to transmit teachings and impart orthodox Lei Department methods.</p><p>He possessed not only the Dao Court's Lei Department techniques but also the Bi Shui Village lineages and other inheritances. Any technique at the Void Refinement level would suffice for the Storm World's cultivators.</p><p>Those schools unable to break through would gradually fade into obscurity.</p><p>Of course, these techniques wouldn't be freely given.  This would foster loyalty and resolve internal strife.</p><p>Gu Ya, solemn and composed, performed a formal bow. "Thank you, senior, for bestowing this method!"</p><p>After instructing her disciples to cultivate, Gu Ya produced a pouch.  "These are the spiritual materials Senior Su Nu and I acquired.  Senior Qin, please check if anything is missing."</p><p>Qin Sang briefly examined them, highly satisfied. With all materials for the Lei Altar and the Dharma Transmission Altar gathered, he could focus on searching the Storm World.</p><p>He asked Gu Ya to keep an eye out for Su Nu's message. After Gu Ya took her leave, Qin Sang summoned the brothers Qing Jia and Qing Yi.</p><p>He held another jade slip containing information on the Yi Ren tribe gathered by Su Nu and the others over the years.</p><p>After a moment's contemplation, Qin Sang looked at the two, who were visibly anxious. "Practice your techniques here, and let me observe the methods of your Ju Fu clan."</p><p>"Yes!"</p><p>The brothers, unable to refuse, sat down and began cultivating.</p><p>Qin Sang sensed their cultivation, quickly understanding.</p><p>The Ju Fu clan members are born with unusually strong arms marked with strange patterns; possessing innate strength, they can tear apart tigers and leopards even as teenagers without cultivation. With training, activating their arm's abilities leads to various transformations.</p><p>The Ju Fu clan's, and indeed the entire Yi Ren tribe's, cultivation centers around innate abilities.</p><p>This differs from the Yao race's bloodline power. The Yi Ren tribe's innate abilities are often linked to a specific organ or body part.</p><p>The *Heavenly Yao Body Refinement* technique draws upon the pure bloodline power and strengthens the connection between bloodline and stars, birthing a Dharma Image that resonates with a dark star in the heavens.  Bloodline power acts more like a catalyst for refining stellar essence.</p><p>The Yi Ren tribe believes their ancestors' path is the true path. At birth, each member inherits a trace of their ancestors' essence; some strong, some weak.</p><p>By constantly honing their abilities, they gradually approach their ancestors.  Other methods, including body refinement, breathing techniques, and external objects, serve this goal.  Their innate abilities form their foundation.  The higher their cultivation, the closer they get to their ancestors, even becoming their ancestors!</p><p>The Yi Ren tribe's cultivation stages differ significantly from the human race, divided into Yuan, Kong, Sheng, and Zu realms, yet there are similarities.</p><p>The Yuan realm signifies the primal essence, corresponding to the human races' Qi Refinement, Foundation Establishment, Golden Core, and Nascent Soul stages; it is also divided into four stages in the Yi Ren tribe. Yuan realm cultivation focuses on the self, similar to human cultivators, only touching upon the Dao at the Nascent Soul stage, requiring a strong foundation for a transformative breakthrough.</p><p>The Kong realm, like for humans, allows harnessing celestial energy, reflecting their abilities, corresponding to the human race's Transformation God and Void Refinement stages, with said ability to manipulate celestial energy to improve themselves.</p><p>The Yi Ren tribe's Sheng realm corresponds to the human race's Unity stage. Such powerhouses rarely appear openly in the Yi Ren lands; Su Nu did not investigate their specific cultivation or abilities.</p><p>As for the Zu realm, it's equivalent to the human race's Mahayana stage. The Yi Ren tribe believes that at this stage, one can return to their true nature and transform into their ancestor, hence the name.</p><p>Like Mahayana cultivators, Zu realm Yi Ren cultivators are largely legendary, their existence only known.</p>
