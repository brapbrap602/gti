<h1>Chapter 2149  The Thunder Pearl</h1><p>This tribulation yielded the greatest benefit to Tianmudie, who has already returned to slumber and digest the power of the tribulation thunder.  Beyond that, only Yunyoujian itself gained much.</p><p>Qin Sang inquired about Yunyou's feelings before the breakthrough, hoping for some experience to help the Five Elements Crown advance, but Yunyou couldn't explain much, having been a hazy, unformed spirit before taking shape.</p><p>The Five Elements Crown had developed a spirit long ago. Little Five, having experienced both the mundane world and seclusion, could control the demonic intent within, yet the breakthrough opportunity had yet to arrive.</p><p>The situations of Yunyoujian and the Five Elements Crown are vastly different, making them unsuitable for comparison; they can only patiently wait.</p><p>Soon after, Qin Sang returned to the Green Sheep Temple.</p><p>At the appointed time, Shaoshi visited again, bringing the Thunder Pearl, with Silu accompanying him.</p><p>Welcoming Peak.</p><p>On the jade table between Qin Sang and Shaoshi, rested a pearl the size of an infant's fist.  The pearl emitted a dazzling light, shimmering like lightning, with rumbling thunder echoing through the hall.</p><p>Qin Sang examined it closely; the interior seemed to contain a compressed thunder domain, a miniature universe. Countless tiny lightning bolts constantly formed and dissipated within, unable to escape the pearl yet radiating genuine thunderous might, a truly awe-inspiring sight.</p><p>Shaoshi, relaxed and confident in this treasure, smiled gently. "Master Qin, may you explore this treasure with your spiritual sense."</p><p>"Is this treasure artificially refined or a natural wonder?"</p><p>Qin Sang raised his head, asking this because he sensed no trace of artificial refinement.  Of course, the crafting method might simply be unknown to him.  </p><p>He could confirm that the pearl lacked sentience; it wasn't a spiritual treasure.</p><p>"I do not know! This treasure was obtained from an unclaimed hidden realm within the Saint Lands; its true origin is unknown. It might be a natural wonder, or perhaps crafted by some ancient master," Shaoshi explained. "The Emperor has invited several cultivators who control the Mirage Towers to a banquet. If Master Qin has no objections, you may begin refining this treasure."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded. After a thorough examination revealing nothing unusual, he needed only to verify the treasure's power as described by Shaoshi to solidify their pact.</p><p>The Saint Lands of the Yi Ren Clan would then be open to him!</p><p>"I humbly accept!"</p><p>Qin Sang raised his right hand, and the Thunder Pearl floated into his palm.</p><p>He closed his eyes, activating his true essence and spiritual sense to penetrate and sense the interior of the Thunder Pearl.  The original owner had left no mark, no opposing spirit-embryo, and Qin Sang faced no resistance during refinement – the process was remarkably smooth.</p><p>Soon, Qin Sang refined the Thunder Pearl. Its divine light subsided, appearing much more ordinary.</p><p>"Master Qin, how do you feel?" Shaoshi asked.</p><p>Qin Sang mused, "The treasure's power is indeed as Daoist Si said.  However, I cannot be certain whether the Thunder Oath will exceed its limits."</p><p>Qin Sang turned to Silu. "Daoist Silu, I would be grateful for your assistance in opening the Thunder Altar again!"</p><p>Silu readily agreed, rising and departing for Xitu Jing.</p><p>Simultaneously, Zhuque and Su Nu headed for Canglang Jing and Beihai Jing respectively, to activate the core branch altars.</p><p>"Daoist Si, come with me."</p><p>Qin Sang rose and left the temple with Shaoshi, arriving at a vast, uninhabited wilderness where they would seal the thunder talisman.</p><p>"Please wait here, Daoist Si."</p><p>A hill with a stone platform was located here. Qin Sang placed the Thunder Pearl on it and returned alone.</p><p>Within the Green Sheep Temple, clouds and mist billowed, the protective formation activated.</p><p>Qin Sang appeared in the forbidden area, activating his true essence. The thunder altar in the valley vibrated, sending lightning soaring towards the heavens.</p><p>The next moment, a phantom thunder altar appeared above the Green Sheep Temple.  The other branch altar masters simultaneously felt it, and under Silu's guidance, immediately began their incantations, resonating with the main altar.</p><p>The Green Sheep Region's Thunder Altar array reappeared!</p><p>Qin Sang sat cross-legged on the altar, his mind merging with it, activating the thunder talisman engraved within.  Shaoshi, observing from nearby, though partially obscured by the Green Sheep Temple's protective array, could vaguely see the phantom thunder altar in the air. Looking up at the zenith and surveying his surroundings, he sensed the immense might of the thunder, and the altar's impending activation!</p><p>Despite having witnessed the power of the Thunder Oath, Shaoshi was still secretly startled. Even with caution, he wasn't confident in escaping unharmed once targeted by the thunder talisman.</p><p>If he could seal this thunder talisman within the Thunder Pearl, it would be an incredibly strong asset within the Saint Lands!</p><p>Shaoshi suppressed his inner turmoil, intently sensing the changing power of the thunder altar.</p><p>'Rumble…'</p><p>After several decades, the countless beings in the Green Sheep Region once again felt the terrifying might of Heaven, trembling in fear.</p><p>The Five Thunder Temple had sent out talismans in advance, summoning everyone, including the common people, so the celestial phenomenon did not cause significant unrest.</p><p>The birds and beasts of the mountains were terrified, sensing an impending catastrophe.  Dark clouds blotted out the sun, and thunder roared.</p><p>As Qin Sang and the masters of Zhutan performed their rites, the celestial phenomena grew more terrifying.  Finally, the Ritual Thunder Decree was activated!</p><p>Thousands of lightning bolts pierced the heavens, the earth's energy surged wildly, lightning pythons writhed, and electric serpents darted, countless bolts hurtling towards Qingyang Temple.</p><p>The Shaoshi watched the hilltop intently. Suddenly, Qin Sang appeared, nodded slightly, and also looked towards the sky.</p><p>Where the thunder converged, a ball of green lightning formed.  This descended, revealing a sheet of green lightning paper, which gently fluttered down.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression was grave. He channeled his energy, activating the *Baoshu*. The jewel rose on its own, hovering above him, radiating light.</p><p>The *Baoshu* and the Ritual Thunder Decree, one above the other, resembled two bolts of lightning about to collide.</p><p>Qin Sang sat cross-legged beneath the lightning, performing hand seals, repeatedly striking the *Baoshu*.  The jewel's radiance intensified until its form seemed to melt into the light, the luminescence shimmering and shifting.</p><p>The light then expanded, quickly forming a huge silver sphere. The sphere itself was ethereal, with lightning flashing within, but it appeared more like an image or illusion, not truly solid; the jewel's physical form seemed to disappear.</p><p>With the silver sphere created, the Ritual Thunder Decree was close at hand. The silver sphere was far larger, seemingly poised to engulf the decree.</p><p>Qin Sang controlled both.  With a thought, the lightning on the Ritual Thunder Decree subsided, restraining its power to prevent an outburst.</p><p>The green lightning paper, light as a feather, drifted onto the silver sphere. The sphere's edge seemed empty; the decree passed through without resistance, entering the sphere's interior.</p><p>If the silver sphere could contain the Ritual Thunder Decree, and the decree remained stable, the sealing would be successful.</p><p>The next moment, a sudden change!</p><p>Black lightning erupted around the Ritual Thunder Decree, like fissures in the void, rapidly spreading within the sphere.</p><p>The Shaoshi's face changed, watching the silver sphere anxiously.</p><p>"Boom!"</p><p>The silver sphere could no longer withstand the onslaught; more and more black lightning appeared, causing it to collapse.</p><p>Qin Sang, prepared for this, instantly cast a prepared spell to isolate the Ritual Thunder Decree and the chaotic energies surrounding it.</p><p>While he could use the Ritual Thunder Decree, he couldn't fully control its power. Every action required extreme caution; disruption of the internal balance could cause an explosion, potentially injuring him.</p><p>The Ritual Thunder Decree hung motionless.</p><p>The illusion within the silver sphere rapidly crumbled, and a streak of light sprang forth – the *Baoshu*. Qin Sang's timing was perfect; the jewel's physical form was unharmed.</p><p>Reflecting on the process, Qin Sang realized the cause of failure: the power of the Ritual Thunder Decree exceeded the *Baoshu*'s capacity.</p><p>However, having only recently obtained the *Baoshu*, and this being his first attempt, failure was expected.  He would not give up.</p><p>After reviewing the process, he identified several oversights and devised countermeasures, and resumed activating the *Baoshu*.</p><p>The silver sphere reappeared; the Ritual Thunder Decree trembled slightly, and once again entered it. Black lightning appeared again, repeating the previous collapse.  Qin Sang retrieved the *Baoshu*.</p><p>"Master Qin?"</p><p>The Shaoshi felt a bad omen and called out.</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head silently, and after a moment's thought, tried again.</p><p>Within a dozen breaths, he had attempted six times, all failing, yet the Shaoshi saw a glimmer of hope; the silver sphere lasted longer each time.</p><p>Seventh attempt!</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at the Ritual Thunder Decree.  As time passed, the thunder's power continued to build, nearing its breaking point. He had at most three more attempts.</p><p>The silver sphere again contained the Ritual Thunder Decree.  The black lightning was still present, but noticeably less and thinner.</p><p>As the Ritual Thunder Decree slowly descended into the sphere, the black lightning rapidly increased.</p><p>"Crack!"</p><p>A huge black fissure pierced the sphere, signifying the seventh collapse of the silver sphere!</p><p>And the eighth... another collapse!</p><p>Qin Sang let out a long breath, gazing at the *Baoshu* before him.  Eight attempts; he had done almost everything he could, using all his ingenuity.</p><p>Chapter 2149 The Thunder Pearl</p><p>This tribulation brought the greatest gains to Tianmudie, aside from Yunyou Sword itself.  Tianmudie departed to slumber and absorb the power of the tribulation thunder.</p><p>Qin Sang inquired about Yunyou's feelings before its breakthrough, hoping to gain insights that could help the Five Elements Crown advance. Unfortunately, Yunyou couldn't articulate anything meaningful; before its transformation, it was merely a hazy spirit embryo.</p><p>The Five Elements Crown had developed a spirit long ago. Xiao Wu, having experienced both the worldly and transcendent realms, could already control the demonic intent within it, yet the opportunity for a breakthrough remained elusive.</p><p>Yunyou Sword and the Five Elements Crown were drastically different and offered no basis for comparison.  Only patience would suffice.</p><p>Soon after, Qin Sang returned to Qingyang Temple.</p><p>At the appointed time, Shaoshi visited again, bringing the Thunder Pearl, with Silu accompanying him.</p><p>Yingke Peak.</p><p>On the jade table between Qin Sang and Shaoshi, rested a treasure the size of a baby's fist.</p><p>The pearl emitted dazzling light, shimmering like thunder, with reverberating booms echoing through the hall.</p><p>Qin Sang examined it closely, observing that its interior seemed to contain a miniature thunder domain, a world within a grain of sand. Countless tiny lightning bolts were perpetually born and extinguished within;  they couldn't escape the pearl but still emanated true thunderous power, awe-inspiring.</p><p>Shaoshi, relaxed and confident in the treasure, smiled, "Master Qin, may you examine it with your divine sense."</p><p>"Is this treasure man-made or a natural wonder?"</p><p>Qin Sang looked up and asked. He sensed no artificial traces. Of course, it was possible the crafting method was beyond his knowledge.  </p><p>It was certain, however, the pearl lacked sentience and wasn't a spirit treasure.</p><p>"I do not know! This treasure was obtained from an unclaimed secret realm within the Saint Land. Its true origin is unknown. It may be a natural wonder, or perhaps the creation of some ancient master," Shaoshi explained.  "The Emperor has invited several cultivators who oversee the Mirage Towers to a banquet.  If you have no objections, Master Qin, you may begin refining this treasure."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded. After a thorough examination revealing nothing unusual, all that remained was to verify the treasure's power matched Shaoshi’s claims before the oath could be sworn.</p><p>The gates of the Yi Ren clan’s Sacred Land would then open for him!</p><p>"I will not be so impolite as to refuse!"</p><p>Qin Sang raised his right hand, and the Thunder Pearl settled into his palm.</p><p>He closed his eyes, activating his true energy and divine sense, probing within the pearl, sensing intently.</p><p>The original owner had left no mark, no opposing spirit embryo.  Qin Sang encountered no resistance while refining it; the process was remarkably smooth.</p><p>Soon, Qin Sang completed the refinement. The pearl's radiant light subsided, appearing far more ordinary.</p><p>"Master Qin, how do you find it?" Shaoshi asked.</p><p>Qin Sang mused, "The treasure's abilities are indeed as Daoist Si described. However, I'm uncertain if the Thunder Oath will exceed its limits."</p><p>Qin Sang then turned to Silu.  "Daoist Silu, please assist me again in opening the Thunder Altar!"</p><p>Silu readily agreed, rising and departing for Xitu Jing.</p><p>Simultaneously, Zhuque and Sunv went to Canglang Jing and Beihai Jing, respectively, to activate the core branch altars.</p><p>"Daoist Si, come with me."</p><p>Qin Sang rose, leaving the temple with Shaoshi to a vast, uninhabited wilderness where they would seal the thunder talisman.</p><p>"Please wait here, Daoist Si."</p><p>There was a hill with a stone platform. Qin Sang placed the Thunder Pearl on it and returned alone.</p><p>Qingyang Temple was enveloped in swirling clouds and mist, its protective formation activated.</p><p>Qin Sang appeared in the forbidden area, activating his true energy. The Thunder Altar in the valley trembled, its light shooting towards the heavens.</p><p>Instantly, a phantom Thunder Altar appeared above Qingyang Temple. The masters of the other branch altars simultaneously sensed it and, led by Silu and the others, immediately cast their spells to activate their altars, resonating with the main altar.</p><p>The Grand Thunder Altar Array of Qingyang Prefecture reappeared!</p><p>Qin Sang sat upon the altar, his mind merging with it, activating the thunder talisman inscribed within.</p><p>Shaoshi, able to observe closely this time, albeit through the barrier of Qingyang Temple's protective array, could vaguely see the phantom Thunder Altar in the sky. He looked upward towards the zenith and then surveyed his surroundings, sensing the immense thunderous power enveloping the land, the altar poised to unleash its might!</p><p>Despite having witnessed the power of the Thunder Oath firsthand, Shaoshi still felt a tremor of fear. Even with precautions, he had no confidence he could escape unscathed once targeted by the thunder talisman.</p><p>If this talisman could be sealed within the Thunder Pearl, it would be an incredibly powerful asset within the Saint Land!</p><p>Shaoshi suppressed his unease, concentrating on the changes in the Thunder Altar's power.</p><p>'Rumble…'</p><p>After decades, the countless beings of Qingyang Prefecture once again felt the terrifying celestial might, trembling in fear.</p><p>Wulei Academy had issued summons in advance to all parties, even warning ordinary people; thus, the celestial phenomenon did not cause major unrest.</p><p>The birds, beasts, fish, and insects of the mountains were thrown into chaos, believing a natural disaster was about to strike.  They fled in terror.</p><p>Black clouds blotted out the sun, thunder roared.</p><p>As Qin Sang and the Masters of Zhu Tan acted, the celestial phenomena grew increasingly terrifying.  Finally, the  Lei Shi Zhang  was activated!</p><p>Thousands of pillars of lightning pierced the heavens. The world's energy raged wildly, thunder pythons and lightning serpents darted about, and countless bolts of lightning surged towards Qingyang Temple.</p><p>The Shaoshi watched the sky above the hill.  Suddenly, Qin Sang appeared on the hilltop, gave him a slight nod, and then looked towards the heavens.</p><p>Where the lightning converged, a ball of green lightning was born.</p><p>The green lightning fell, revealing a sheet of green lightning paper which fluttered down gracefully.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression was grave.  He silently channeled his energy, activating the Baozhu . The bead rose on its own, hovering above Qin Sang, its light shining brightly.</p><p>The Baozhu and the Lei Shi Zhang, one above and one below, resembled two bolts of lightning about to collide.</p><p>Qin Sang sat cross-legged beneath the lightning, performing hand seals, repeatedly striking the Baozhu.  The bead's aura grew increasingly intense; gradually, its physical form merged with its radiant light, the light shifting and unstable like water.</p><p>Then, the light began to expand, quickly forming a huge silver orb.  The orb itself was ethereal, with internal flashes of lightning and thunder, but it appeared more like an illusion or image, not entirely real, the Baozhu's physical form seemingly vanished.</p><p>With the silver orb created, the Lei Shi Zhang was close at hand. The silver orb was far larger than the seal, appearing as if it would engulf it.</p><p>Qin Sang controlled both.</p><p>With a thought, the lightning on the Lei Shi Zhang's surface subsided, restraining its power and preventing its eruption.</p><p>The sheet of green lightning paper, light as a feather, floated onto the silver orb. The edge of the silver orb seemed empty; the Lei Shi Zhang met no resistance, passing through effortlessly and entering the orb’s interior.</p><p>If the silver orb could contain the Lei Shi Zhang, and the seal could remain stable, the sealing would be considered a success.</p><p>The next moment, a sudden change occurred!</p><p>Black lightning suddenly appeared around the Lei Shi Zhang, like cracks in the void, rapidly spreading within the orb.</p><p>Seeing this, the Shaoshi’s expression changed, and he anxiously watched the silver orb.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>Finally, the silver orb couldn’t hold, the black lightning multiplying, and it collapsed.</p><p>Qin Sang, prepared for this, immediately cast a prepared spell to isolate the Lei Shi Zhang and the surrounding chaotic forces.</p><p>He could use the Lei Shi Zhang, but that didn't mean he could control its power. Every movement had to be cautious; once the internal balance was disrupted, it could explode, potentially harming him.</p><p>The Lei Shi Zhang remained suspended in place.</p><p>The illusion within the silver orb quickly crumbled, and a stream of light leaped out – the Baozhu. Qin Sang's timing was perfect; the Baozhu itself was unharmed.</p><p>Recalling the process, Qin Sang's mind raced. The cause of failure was simple: the Lei Shi Zhang's power exceeded the Baozhu's capacity.</p><p>However, he had only recently obtained the Baozhu. This was his first attempt; failure was normal, and he wouldn't give up.</p><p>After reviewing the process, he identified several oversights and devised countermeasures, continuing to activate the Baozhu.</p><p>The silver orb reappeared, the Lei Shi Zhang trembled slightly, and re-entered.  Immediately, black lightning reappeared, repeating the previous collapse. Qin Sang could only retract the Baozhu again.</p><p>"Qin Zhenren?"</p><p>The Shaoshi sensed something was wrong and called out.</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head slightly, remaining silent. After a moment's reflection, he tried again using the same method.</p><p>Within a dozen breaths, he had attempted six times. The sixth attempt, unsurprisingly, failed, yet it gave the Shaoshi hope, as the silver orb lasted longer each time.</p><p>Seventh attempt!</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at the Lei Shi Zhang.  As time passed, the lightning power continued to build, nearing its breaking point, leaving at most three attempts.</p><p>The silver orb again contained the Lei Shi Zhang. The black lightning still appeared, but it was noticeably sparser and thinner.</p><p>As the Lei Shi Zhang slowly descended into the silver orb, the black lightning increased rapidly.</p><p>“Crack!”</p><p>A huge black crack pierced the orb, announcing the seventh collapse of the silver orb!</p><p>Then the eighth… another collapse!</p><p>Qin Sang let out a long sigh, gazing at the Baozhu before him. After eight attempts, he had practically reached his limit, racking his brains.</p><p>This is the final attempt.  If it fails again, there's no point continuing; we should consider sealing another thunder talisman.</p><p>He steadied his mind, banished distracting thoughts, and brought himself to peak condition, activating the Orb.</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>The Orb shone brightly, manifesting a silver sphere of light, appearing more stable and solid than before.</p><p>The Thunder Seal descended lower and lower, the power of the thunder nearing its breaking point. Qin Sang carefully manipulated the two forces, slowly merging them.</p><p>'Bang!'</p><p>Like a pebble dropped into a lake, ripples spread across the surface of the silver sphere.  Faint shadows could be seen within, though the resulting disturbance was smaller than the eighth attempt.</p><p>Qin Sang didn’t let the Thunder Seal fall directly, but waited for the ripples to subside before continuing.</p><p>From then on, he paused briefly with each movement, exerting every ounce of his strength with exquisite precision.  Under his guidance, the Thunder Seal steadily approached the core of the silver sphere.</p><p>Shaoshi watched the Thunder Seal intently. The black lightning around it became increasingly dense, but it didn't collapse; it successfully found its place!</p><p>'Hum!'</p><p>Heaven and earth seemed to tremble.  The silver sphere was thrown into even greater turmoil.</p><p>Qin Sang's face darkened. He used all his power to control the Orb, but couldn’t stabilize the silver sphere or mend the cracks.  In a decisive move, he forced the silver sphere to contract.</p><p>As the silver sphere contracted, countless tiny lightning bolts appeared within.  These bolts resembled mysterious runes, circling the Thunder Seal before drifting towards it like real runes, leaving faint marks on its surface before dissipating.</p><p>Though the master of the Orb, Qin Sang didn't recognize these runes, but sensed a sealing power within them, attempting to seal the Thunder Seal.</p><p>More and more runes merged with the Thunder Seal, seemingly progressing favorably.  However, Qin Sang keenly perceived that the black lightning around the Thunder Seal hadn't disappeared; it had merely stopped expanding, seemingly locked in a struggle with another force.</p><p>"No good!"</p><p>Qin Sang's expression changed instantly.  This thought flashed through his mind, followed by a sudden clap of thunder.  The black lightning spread wildly, as if it had only been gathering strength before now unleashing its full power.</p><p>"Retreat!"</p><p>Qin Sang shouted.</p><p>A streak of light shot from the silver sphere—the Orb itself—which Qin Sang caught in his hand as he retreated hastily.</p><p>Shaoshi reacted even faster, having already withdrawn to a safe distance when things turned south.</p><p>Meanwhile, Qin Sang threw the Thunder Seal high into the air with all his might.</p><p>At that moment, the thunderclouds froze, all things fell silent. A thunder paper hung in the sky, suppressing the world, its power undeniable!</p><p>'Boom! Boom! Boom!'</p><p>The power of the thunder raged across the land, leveling mountains and tearing the earth apart. The thunder's might lingered long afterward.</p><p>Fortunately, this place was far from human settlements and sects, preventing casualties.</p><p>Qin Sang and Shaoshi stood side-by-side, silently watching the Thunder Seal wreak havoc across the heavens.</p><p>"A pity!"</p><p>Shaoshi sighed, shaking his head. It was clear that Qin Sang had given it his all and hadn't held back.</p><p>In fact, Shaoshi wasn't overly surprised by the outcome.</p><p>After obtaining the Orb, Si Huang personally refined it, having already attempted multiple times and explored the Orb's limits.  It was only because Qin Sang possessed the Thunder Altar and exceptional thunder techniques that they decided to try for a breakthrough.</p><p>Qin Sang gazed at the fading light of the thunder, lost in thought.</p><p>It seemed that the Thunder Seal exceeded the Orb’s limits, leading to the failure at the final step.</p><p>However, the fundamental reason was his inability to control the Thunder Seal, preventing a harmonious resonance between the Seal and the Orb.</p><p>This resonance was extremely subtle and difficult to describe; he had only just discovered it. It had been triggered from within the Orb at the moment of the Thunder Seal's eruption, fleeting and elusive.</p><p>Perhaps only cultivators with profound mastery of the Way of Thunder could perceive this resonance.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at Shaoshi.  He wondered if Si Huang had ever commissioned a top-tier expert in the Way of Thunder to refine the Orb; otherwise, they might never have noticed this subtlety. But if they had known about the Orb’s hidden mechanism, they probably wouldn't have been so quick to give it to him.</p><p>Because of this resonance, this wasn't actually the Orb's limit, but whether it can seal the Thunder Seal remains uncertain.  Only when his cultivation improves and his control over the Thunder Seal strengthens can he try again.</p><p>Qin Sang, naturally, wouldn't reveal this secret. He showed an agreeing expression, saying, "We can only choose from other thunder talismans.  Which one has caught your eye, Daoist Si?"</p>
