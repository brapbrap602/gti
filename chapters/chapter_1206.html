<h1>Chapter 1198: Divine Patterns </h1><p>At the edge of the Heavenly Scar.</p><p>Qin Sang looked down into the abyss.</p><p>He slowly descended along the cliff face, entering the Heavenly Scar for the first time.</p><p>Unlike the Ancient Immortal Battlefield, the interior of the Heavenly Scar showed no signs of desolation. Instead, it was breathtakingly beautiful.</p><p>The slopes of the cliff were covered in lush greenery, like a verdant carpet. Rare flowers and plants, unseen in the mortal world, competed in splendor, while waterfalls cascaded like jade ribbons, converging and diverging before flowing into the abyss.</p><p>If not for the occasional dangerous remnants of ancient restrictions, it would truly resemble a paradise.</p><p>Such minor dangers couldn't hinder Qin Sang's progress.</p><p>His speed increased as the terrain grew steeper, and the scenery became more desolate. After descending further, all traces of greenery disappeared.</p><p>Exposed rocks, black as ink, gave off an eerie and sinister aura, indicating that this place was far from ordinary.</p><p>Qin Sang sensed a familiar chilling energy and knew that below lay the gathering place of Earth Fiend Qi.</p><p>As soon as this thought crossed his mind, Qin Sang saw wisps of Earth Fiend Qi seeping out from the stone caves below.</p><p>The steep cliff face was riddled with irregular caves, each filled with dense Earth Fiend Qi, deeper and more concentrated than the Earth Sink Cave.</p><p>Qin Sang activated his protective true essence and chose a cave entrance at random, slipping inside.</p><p>Relying on his formidable cultivation, Qin Sang withstood the erosion of Earth Fiend Qi, delving deep into the cliff. After thoroughly exploring the area, he returned empty-handed, confirming that the ruins of the Corpse Sect were not here.</p><p>After refining the Fiend Corpse, Qin Sang retraced his steps.</p><p>Once his external avatar regained its Qi Refining stage cultivation, Qin Sang brought it to one of the market towns.</p><p>He waited outside with his true body while controlling the avatar to enter the market.</p><p>Using his previous identity, the avatar moved unimpeded through the market, gathering old acquaintances in a courtyard at the corner.</p><p>"Old Qi, didn't you say last time you had a new deal, likely a novice? Why did you disappear for so long? Did you run into trouble?"</p><p>Old Qi was Qin Sang's avatar, and his friends were of similar ilk.</p><p>The speaker was a burly man with a fierce appearance, his expression tinged with schadenfreude.</p><p>The avatar snorted, "Evil Wuchang, your luck will run out someday. I'll see when the real Wuchang comes to drag your soul to the eighteenth layer of hell."</p><p>Evil Wuchang sneered, "If I go to the eighteenth layer of hell, Old Qi, do you think your misdeeds are any less than mine?"</p><p>"Enough!"</p><p>A charming woman in red interrupted impatiently, "I just hooked up with a little darling, and I'm not here to listen to you two bicker. Old Qi, why did you gather us here?"</p><p>The avatar and Evil Wuchang glared at each other but didn't continue their argument.</p><p>"I have a matter that requires your assistance," the avatar said, pausing. "Help me investigate someone. A hundred years ago, there was a Golden Core cultivator known as 'Corpse Ghost Immortal.' He was said to have been active near the Scar Mountain. Any information related to this person will be richly rewarded."</p><p>Evil Wuchang and the others exchanged glances.</p><p>"Old Qi, are you tired of living, trying to provoke a Golden Core cultivator?" Evil Wuchang looked at him as if he were a fool.</p><p>The charming woman pondered deeply, giving the avatar a meaningful look. "A Golden Core cultivator from a hundred years ago, with such a flamboyant title as 'Corpse Ghost Immortal'â€”we've never heard of him. He's probably dead by now. Did you find some clue related to his legacy or treasures?"</p><p>At her words, everyone's eyes lit up.</p><p>The avatar's expression stiffened under their intense gazes. He forced a smile, "I knew I couldn't hide it from you! I've been busy with this matter these past few days. My cultivation is too low to handle it alone, so I wanted to invite a few helpers. That's why I called you all here. But let me be clear, we all know each other well. Don't get any strange ideas..."</p><p>"Golden Core legacy? Old Qi, you've finally hit the jackpot."</p><p>Evil Wuchang rubbed his hands together, visibly excited.</p><p>The others were equally intrigued. After some discussion, they dispersed. The avatar watched them leave, his eyes deep and contemplative. Soon, he too left the courtyard to begin his investigation.</p><p>After some time, the investigation yielded no results.</p><p>Qin Sang sent the avatar to another market town, but the outcome was the same.</p><p>Time had erased all traces. A Golden Core cultivator's legacy was but a speck of dust in the river of time, and after a mere hundred years, it had vanished without a trace.</p><p>With no leads, Qin Sang initiated his second plan. He had the avatar bring along a Fiend Corpse with strength comparable to a Foundation Establishment cultivator and return to the market town. Without hesitation, he gathered his old acquaintances once more.</p><p>Feeling the oppressive aura of the avatar's Fiend Corpse, Evil Wuchang and the others cursed inwardly.</p><p>This old fox had clearly taken the treasure for himself!</p><p>While tricking them into helping with the investigation, he had secretly retrieved the Golden Core legacy. Otherwise, with his meager strength, how could he have refined such a powerful Fiend Corpse?</p><p>Though they thought this, they all maintained a respectful demeanor, treating him as they would a true Foundation Establishment cultivator.</p><p>After a secretive afternoon meeting, the avatar finally let them leave.</p><p>Evil Wuchang walked into the shadows, glancing back at the courtyard with a flicker of disdain in his eyes. "With your cultivation lower than mine, you got lucky with a Foundation Establishment Fiend Corpse and now think you can make me work for you? Dream on!"</p><p>Earlier, Old Qi had proposed recruiting them to explore the Heavenly Scar for treasures.</p><p>With a Foundation Establishment Fiend Corpse, they could venture deeper into the Heavenly Scar.</p><p>But Evil Wuchang didn't believe Old Qi's intentions were pure. If danger arose, Old Qi would undoubtedly abandon them, even using them as shields.</p><p>With this in mind, Evil Wuchang snorted and quickly headed in another direction.</p><p>Before long, he arrived at a quiet, elegant courtyard deep within the market town. Ensuring no one was following, he approached the gate with a smile, stating his purpose to the gatekeeper, and was led inside.</p><p>Moonlight and stars.</p><p>A central courtyard, a jade table.</p><p>Fine wine and delicacies.</p><p>A Daoist-robed cultivator was drinking, slightly tipsy, while several beautiful female cultivators danced gracefully before him, their eyes seductive.</p><p>Evil Wuchang swallowed hard, filled with envy.</p><p>These female cultivators were of higher cultivation than him. Truly, disciples of major sects lived in luxury and indulgence!</p><p>Though he could mimic such a lifestyle, at best he could only find a few mortal women to dance for him. He dared not act so boldly in cities controlled by Scar Mountain, only in remote areas. How could he compare to the man before him?</p><p>The gatekeeper approached to report.</p><p>The Daoist glanced over.</p><p>Evil Wuchang straightened up immediately as the Daoist dismissed his subordinates and addressed him, "What do you have to report? Speak."</p><p>...</p><p>"Golden Core legacy? Are you certain?"</p><p>After Evil Wuchang explained the situation, the Daoist's drunkenness vanished instantly.</p><p>Evil Wuchang nodded repeatedly, "Absolutely true. Old Qi's Foundation Establishment Fiend Corpse must have come from there."</p><p>"Corpse Ghost Immortal..."</p><p>The Daoist tried to recall but couldn't remember such a figure from a hundred years ago.</p><p>Suddenly, a thought struck him. With a flick of his sleeve, a sword light shot out, instantly pressing against Evil Wuchang's throat. The Daoist sneered, "Old Qi obtained a Golden Core legacy and dared to meet you openly? Using Earth Fiend Qi instead of Yin Qi for the Fiend Corpse? Do you take me for a fool? You have quite the nerve, conspiring to deceive me with such a clumsy scheme!"</p><p>"Senior, I wouldn't dare deceive you or Scar Mountain!"</p><p>Evil Wuchang trembled, pleading, "According to Old Qi, his Fiend Corpse is as strong as a mid-Foundation Establishment cultivator. He probably thinks all the seniors have been sent to the front lines. With the market town empty and no tigers in the mountain, he dares to act so brazenly. Old Qi is still in the market town. You can verify if I'm lying..."</p><p>The Daoist narrowed his eyes, surprised. "A mid-Foundation Establishment Fiend Corpse?"</p><p>He had only recently reached Foundation Establishment and was no match for such a Fiend Corpse.</p><p>If Evil Wuchang truly wanted to harm him, there was no need to be so detailed.</p><p>"Humph! I'll spare your life for now!"</p><p>The Daoist retracted his sword. Seeing Evil Wuchang's expectant expression, he snorted, "Go back and keep an eye on Old Qi. Don't let him suspect anything. If there really is a Golden Core legacy, you'll be rewarded!"</p><p>"Yes, Senior!"</p><p>Evil Wuchang left with a pleased expression.</p><p>The Daoist pondered for a moment, then decided to send a message back to his sect, seeking advice from a few senior brothers about whether there was ever a cultivator known as 'Corpse Ghost Immortal.'</p><p>A Golden Core legacy was indeed tempting.</p><p>If he invited his senior brothers, even if it were a trap, they could easily crush it!</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't expected that before his avatar could even flaunt the Fiend Corpse, the news would coincidentally reach the ears of a Scar Mountain disciple.</p><p>Soon, the Daoist received a reply. After reading it, his face showed surprise. "There really was a Golden Core cultivator named Corpse Ghost Immortal, who could refine Fiend Corpses using Earth Fiend Qi. He was also acquainted with Uncle Wu. However, he had just begun to make a name for himself when he died in battle. No wonder no one has heard of him. It seems he might have foreseen something and left his legacy here before being sent to the front lines, which Old Qi has now obtained..."</p><p>The Daoist immediately sent a message inviting his senior brothers to assist, lest Old Qi realize the danger and flee with the treasure.</p><p>Two days later.</p><p>The avatar, accompanied by the Fiend Corpse, left the market town. Not long after entering the mountains, a figure suddenly appeared before him, blocking his path.</p><p>As he turned to leave, another figure blocked him from behind.</p><p>Both were mid-Foundation Establishment experts!</p><p>Then, from behind an ancient tree, the Daoist emerged.</p><p>Looking at the Fiend Corpse beside the avatar, his eyes gleamed with interest. He fanned himself leisurely and said, "I heard Fellow Daoist Qi is blessed by heaven, having obtained a Golden Core legacy. May we take a look?"</p><p>The avatar showed no fear, replying calmly, "I've been waiting for you."</p><p>The three were puzzled by the avatar's confidence. They had carefully scouted the area and found nothing amiss.</p><p>Before they could react, they suddenly felt a tightness in their bodies, their vision darkened, and they were immobilized, filled with terror.</p><p>The opponent's strength was terrifying. They hadn't even seen his figure.</p><p>No matter how they struggled, the binding force remained unyielding.</p><p>As they panicked, an unfamiliar voice echoed in their ears, "You have quite the nerve, following my disciple."</p><p>One of them managed to speak, pleading, "Junior was blind, not knowing Fellow Daoist Qi was your disciple. Please, Senior, show mercy. We haven't caused any harm. I'm willing to return to Scar Mountain and bring all the treasures from my cave to apologize to Fellow Daoist Qi."</p><p>They thought they had offended Old Qi.</p><p>"Humph, don't try to intimidate me with Scar Mountain. I'm not easily scared. However, out of respect for Scar Mountain, answer a few questions honestly, and I'll spare your lives."</p><p>The three felt slightly reassured. The opponent still feared their sect and quickly agreed.</p><p>Soon, Qin Sang flew out of the forest with his avatar.</p><p>The three weren't dead but were bound by Golden Core-level restrictions in the forest. When they would be freed depended on when Scar Mountain found them.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't want to cause too much trouble.</p><p>Killing three true disciples would surely provoke Scar Mountain's wrath.</p><p>In these turbulent times, as long as no one died, Scar Mountain likely wouldn't pursue the matter too aggressively over a mere Golden Core legacy, not wanting to provoke a mysterious enemy.</p><p>"If I can't find anything, I'll have to make some noise and force my way into the various forces near Scar Mountain to interrogate them one by one."</p><p>Qin Sang looked westward, thinking, "So Corpse Ghost Immortal's surname was Chen, from the Southern Hidden Mountains west of the Heavenly Scar. Unfortunately, the Golden Core cultivator surnamed Wu, who was close to Corpse Ghost Immortal, is currently fighting on the front lines. It's impossible to capture him for questioning anytime soon. I'll have to head to the Southern Hidden Mountains first. None of these three have seen Tan Hao, nor do they know if he's been here or went directly to the Southern Hidden Mountains."</p><p>Among the three Scar Mountain disciples, one had served as a page for the Golden Core cultivator surnamed Wu. When Corpse Ghost Immortal visited, he had heard Wu refer to him as Fellow Daoist Chen, knowing he had once cultivated in the Southern Hidden Mountains.</p><p>Qin Sang suspected that Corpse Ghost Immortal had obtained the Corpse Sect's legacy before coming to Scar Mountain to absorb Earth Fiend Qi for refining Fiend Corpses. He decided to try his luck in the Southern Hidden Mountains.</p><p>Without delay, he set off immediately.</p><p>Crossing the Heavenly Scar once more, Qin Sang headed straight for the Southern Hidden Mountains.</p><p>By noon on the third day, Qin Sang arrived, having already gathered information about the forces in the Southern Hidden Mountains.</p><p>The Southern Hidden Mountains had a peculiar shape.</p><p>At the edge of the Heavenly Scar, peaks formed a semicircle, extending outward in rings.</p><p>The area was treacherous, with no top-tier sects nearby, mostly populated by rogue cultivators. However, these forces were more or less connected to the major sects outside.</p><p>Qin Sang sent out his avatar, repeating his previous tactic.</p><p>Unfortunately, though he lured out a few with ill intentions, none knew anything about Corpse Ghost Immortal.</p><p>Realizing this approach was futile, Qin Sang decided to directly approach the major forces in the Southern Hidden Mountains.</p><p>Among these forces were cultivation families, rogue cultivator alliances, and branch sects of major sects.</p><p>After making the rounds, Qin Sang found that the protective formations of the cultivation families and rogue cultivator alliances were relatively weak.</p><p>One cultivation family's formation had a significant flaw, unnoticed by others but detected by the Heavenly Eye Butterfly. This allowed Qin Sang to infiltrate without causing much commotion, saving a lot of trouble.</p><p>The Li Family.</p><p>A family with two Golden Core cultivators would have been considered prosperous in the past.</p><p>But in times of war, the survival of the family took precedence over prosperity.</p><p>Fortunately, the Li Family was better off than single-Golden Core forces. Not both Golden Core cultivators were conscripted, ensuring at least one survived, and they could take turns.</p><p>Li Yutian had just been relieved by his grandfather, returning from the front lines to recuperate at home.</p><p>Recalling the blood-soaked battlefields, Li Yutian still felt a lingering fear. Even Golden Core cultivators were at constant risk of sudden death in the chaos of war.</p><p>The only silver lining was witnessing Nascent Soul battles firsthand, which accelerated his progress through continuous combat.</p><p>He couldn't understand why the Nascent Soul ancestors, who could live in peace, insisted on invading the Heavenly Alliance. The Sin Abyss wasn't yet resource-depleted.</p><p>Outside the cave, two maids stood guard.</p><p>Suddenly, Li Yutian's voice came from within, "Inform everyone that I've had a new breakthrough and will be in seclusion. No matter what happens, do not disturb me."</p><p>The maids were overjoyed. The patriarch was already at the peak of early Golden Core. If he broke through again, the family would have two mid-Golden Core experts. Moreover, the patriarch was still young, potentially with the talent to reach Nascent Soul.</p><p>The maids bowed and left, seeing the formation light appear on the door, without a hint of doubt.</p><p>Inside the cave, Li Yutian was filled with terror, staring at a cloaked figure who had appeared out of nowhere.</p><p>"Nascent Soul ancestor!"</p><p>Li Yutian felt the overwhelming pressure, despair filling his face.</p><p>Qin Sang appeared like a ghost before Li Yutian, placing a hand on his head to directly search his soul.</p><p>On the battlefield, this man had killed countless allies. Qin Sang showed no mercy, extracting the information he needed before erasing all traces of Li Yutian's existence and leaving quietly.</p><p>The Li Family remained unaware.</p><p>Only when the other patriarch returned and forcibly opened the cave did they discover Li Yutian's disappearance. But the cave showed no signs of disturbance, as if Li Yutian had vanished into thin air, becoming one of the Southern Hidden Mountains' great mysteries.</p><p>Later, Qin Sang and Fatty Chicken split up, creating a few more unsolved cases, though these involved Foundation Establishment cultivators.</p><p>Cross-referencing the information, Qin Sang gained some understanding of Corpse Ghost Immortal.</p><p>His name was Chen Heng.</p><p>He had always been a rogue cultivator, unremarkable, like other low-level cultivators, eking out a living by venturing into the Heavenly Scar. Suddenly, he gained some unknown opportunity, and his cultivation advanced rapidly.</p><p>Step by step, he broke through to the Golden Core stage, becoming a Golden Core cultivator.</p><p>He practiced a wood-element technique, his wood spiritual power exceptionally pure, with formidable abilities, earning him some renown in the Southern Hidden Mountains.</p><p>In Li Yutian's memories, Chen Heng was feared for his solitary nature and vengeful tendencies. However, it was certain that at that time, Chen Heng had no connection to corpse path cultivation, nor did he bear the title 'Corpse Ghost Immortal.'</p><p>Until a hundred years ago, something happened, and Chen Heng suddenly left the Southern Hidden Mountains, vanishing without a trace. It was speculated he had perished outside.</p><p>This was indeed the case.</p><p>From this, Qin Sang concluded that Chen Heng had obtained the Corpse Sect's legacy during his journey from the Southern Hidden Mountains to Scar Mountain.</p><p>But Qin Sang still had no leads on the Corpse Sect.</p><p>Chen Heng had no close friends in the Southern Hidden Mountains. If he had obtained the corpse refining technique outside, the trail would likely end here. Qin Sang would have to return to the Heavenly Alliance Plateau to find the Golden Core cultivator from Scar Mountain.</p><p>Since he was already here, Qin Sang decided to continue investigating in the Southern Hidden Mountains, searching through Li Yutian's and</p>
