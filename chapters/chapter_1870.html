<h1>Chapter 1861: First Encounter</h1><p>Torrential rain poured down.</p><p>Each clash sent up huge splashes; raindrops shattered into a misty spray, shrouding both combatants.  Two gigantic figures constantly crisscrossed, their every move creating astonishing power. Fortunately, this was the illusionary scene of the sacrificial altar; in any other place, the battle would have shattered mountains and rivers.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>Water rose from the ground.</p><p>The downpour seemed to be buffeted by a gale; the rain slanted towards the battlefield, making the surrounding mist even denser. Only a long, slender figure could be vaguely seen, rising into the air.</p><p>As its long tail whipped back and forth, the rainwater was drawn towards it, forming a giant water spout.</p><p>‘Rumble!’</p><p>The spout rose from the ground. With a violent flick of its tail, like a true dragon, it swept across the battlefield with immense force.</p><p>Qin Sang was at the edge of the water spout, feeling the terrifying impact; his breath hitched, his feet firmly planted on the ground, his shoulders trembling.</p><p>‘Bang!’</p><p>A powerful punch, like an iron hammer, struck the water spout.  The spout momentarily paused; two large holes appeared where the fist connected. The force exploded within the holes, shattering the entire spout. The rainwater, losing its support, cascaded down, creating a spectacular scene.</p><p>Qin Sang wasn’t unscathed. He felt a searing pain in his arms, his blood churning, his internal organs feeling displaced. He staggered back, his feet splashing in the water.</p><p>“Huff… huff…”</p><p>After slightly calming his ragged breathing, Qin Sang sensed through his wood spirit body and found that the surrounding wood spirit energy had noticeably stagnated.</p><p>“Time to change the battlefield…”</p><p>Muttering to himself, Qin Sang glanced at the two long tendrils whipping down from above, his expression instantly rigid. His body lost its luster, its vitality fading.</p><p>Previously, his teleportation technique had been smooth and unimpeded.  Ling You Wang lacked the ability to influence the wood spirit energy of the entire forest domain. If he couldn't prevent Qin Sang’s teleportation and keep him trapped in the downpour, he couldn't stop him from absorbing wood spirit energy, rendering his powerful spell useless.</p><p>Qin Sang had been vigilant, suspecting Ling You Wang had other tricks up his sleeve, and he finally discovered one.</p><p>In the distance, a chosen ancient tree's leaves turned yellow, its life force visibly fading.</p><p>At that moment, the giant clam, which had been suspended in the air, solely adjusting the rainfall, suddenly turned, its opening aimed at the ancient tree. White energy flowed within its shell, then vanished instantly.</p><p>Simultaneously, a swirling mass of water vapor gathered above the ancient tree, and with a whoosh, poured into its trunk.</p><p>The nearly dead tree instantly revived; yellow leaves turned green, the bark becoming visibly more moist.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>Leaves unfurled, branches grew.</p><p>The entire tree resurrected and began to grow wildly, its canopy overshadowing the surrounding trees; more lush and vibrant than before!</p><p>Unlike before, only this single tree showed this change.  The nearby ancient trees remained unaffected.</p><p>‘Thump… thump… thump…’</p><p>Qin Sang’s wood spirit body suddenly moved again. His facial features reappeared, his stiff eyes rolled, revealing a shocked expression.</p><p>In an instant, Qin Sang was forcefully pulled back from his teleportation, and then felt a fierce gust of wind as two bolts of lightning struck from left and right.</p><p>Caught off guard, Qin Sang raised his right arm, hurriedly activating the Ming Mountain Armor. Fragments of the treasure coalesced on his forearm.</p><p>A sword beam shot from his brow, striking at the left tendril.</p><p>‘Bang!’</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>The Yunyou Sword flew back, its light protecting its master.</p><p>Qin Sang staggered back more than ten steps, instinctively shaking his arm.</p><p>Although the treasure fragments could withstand the tendrils, protecting him from the whiplash, the force still penetrated the armor, causing intense pain.</p><p>At this moment, however, Qin Sang ignored the pain, staring intently at the giant clam in the sky.</p><p>So that's how Ling You Wang broke his teleportation technique!</p><p>By precisely locating the tree Qin Sang chose *before* his teleportation was complete, infusing it with life force, he used the tree's wood spirit energy, abruptly interrupting the transformation of the wood spirit body.</p><p>It sounds simple.</p><p>The wood spirit body teleportation was almost instantaneous; without extremely keen perception, it was easy to misjudge.</p><p>One mistake, and all previous efforts were wasted.</p><p>Qin Sang sensed a connection between the Swallowing Sea Clam and the vapor in the void.  A strange power seemed to spread through the forest along with the vapor. Was the king using it to track his movements?</p><p>While Qin Sang observed the clam, King Ling You did not press his attack. Instead, he pondered his previous strike, a test that had apparently yielded excellent results.  A confident smile gradually spread across the king's face.</p><p>"This King hasn't had such a satisfying battle in a long time! Show me your other abilities!" he roared, his voice like thunder.</p><p>King Ling You looked at Qin Sang as one might look at a plaything.  The two strongest abilities of the Spiritual Wood body had been broken.  Complete neutralization meant Qin Sang had lost his geographical advantage.</p><p>Qin Sang remained silent, his thoughts stirring. The sword light surrounding him paused slightly, the sword tips tilting upward.</p><p>A deafening sword cry echoed as the sword light soared into the sky.  It did not strike the enemy, but instead transformed into a green beam that danced in the air.</p><p>In an instant, the sky darkened, plunging the world into night.  Myriad stars hung high above, their light carrying a fierce sword intent.</p><p>The Seven Constellations Division Sword Formation!</p><p>This time, Qin Sang’s formation was grander than ever before. The vast star river resembled a real cosmos in its immensity!</p><p>But vastness didn't equate to strength. The sword force lacked cohesion, making it harder to control, especially against a shrewd妖王.</p><p>To King Ling You, this starry expanse likely teemed with weaknesses. Locating the main star would require little effort.  Even shattering the star-shaped swords wouldn't be difficult. Escape would be easy for him if he chose it.</p><p>However, Qin Sang's purpose in deploying the formation wasn't to trap his opponent.  As he rose on his sword, his feet remained firmly planted on the ground, his expression fading. He used his translocation technique again.</p><p>The black fish dharma body raised its head, its gaze sweeping across the star river, yet it remained motionless.</p><p>King Ling You repeated his tactic. The same scene unfolded.</p><p>Outside the battlefield, an ancient tree withered without warning. The Swallowing Sea Clam immediately changed direction, white vapor swirling from its opening. A cloud of vapor condensed above the tree crown.</p><p>But before it fully formed, a powerful wave erupted from within, flashing with what seemed like lightning. The vapor exploded and dispersed.</p><p>In that instant, the ancient tree lost its life force, and Qin Sang leaped from its trunk.  His eyes narrowed as he met the dark gaze of the black fish dharma body.</p><p>Sword intent permeated the array.  However, the vapor was a manifestation of the Swallowing Sea Clam's power and not as light as it appeared. Dispersing it was no easy feat.</p><p>The timing was also critical.  A moment's delay, and the tree would be infused with life again, halting the translocation technique.</p><p>First, Qin Sang had to pinpoint the core of the clam's power and instantly unleash sufficient sword intent to disperse the vapor and disrupt the king's plan.  Before mastering sword intent, even within the array, Qin Sang couldn't achieve this.</p><p>A cold snort echoed through the air.  A torrential downpour followed, along with King Ling You's attack, as fierce as before. Qin Sang had to respond with all his might.</p><p>While relentlessly attacking Qin Sang, King Ling You used several abilities and produced a scale-like treasure, repeatedly bombarding the star sea.  The starry sky became chaotic.</p><p>"Bang! Bang! Bang!"</p><p>Streaks of light repeatedly tore through the sky.  Many sword stars exploded, and countless others shifted.  Large sections of the star field were even erased with a single blow.</p><p>Yet, King Ling You could not destroy the array.  This was no ordinary spiritual formation, but a sword formation, composed of only one spiritual sword; no other artifacts were used.  Only by destroying the Yun You Sword could King Ling You succeed.</p><p>The formation was inherently flawed, its purpose not to kill, but to achieve something else.</p><p>Two battlefields had been created, one in the heavens and one on the ground. The celestial battle was more spectacular, but the terrestrial clash was far more perilous.</p><p>Soon, it was time to relocate again. Qin Sang repeated his tactic, succeeding once more. Yet, after another fierce battle, his next translocation failed!  He had captured the core of the vapor, but failed to disperse it in time.</p><p>As time passed, the battlefield kept shifting.  The translocation sometimes succeeded, sometimes failed.  Two peak Nascent Soul cultivators clashed, each encounter causing the earth to sink and mountains to crumble.</p><p>Who would have thought that their victory or defeat hinged on such subtle details? If King Ling You could trap Qin Sang, he could cripple the Spiritual Wood body.</p><p>Qin Sang sensed that as long as he persevered, King Ling You would be unable to defeat him, and the situation would eventually turn. He couldn't claim victory, but at least he could hold his own against King Ling You.</p><p>Ling You Wang's power wasn't limitless. Unless more demonic cultivators joined the fray, he would exhaust himself before anyone else, and he would be the first to retreat.</p><p>Perhaps, seeing the situation was hopeless, Ling You Wang would simply give up.</p><p>As a powerful demon king, he understood the importance of knowing when to advance and retreat. He wouldn't fight to the death over something trivial and with an insignificant nobody.</p><p>*噗!*</p><p>Water vapor exploded.</p><p>Qin Sang successfully teleported again, eagerly absorbing the wood spirit energy, feeling a surge of comfort.</p><p>Reflecting on their previous clashes, Qin Sang wasn't optimistic.</p><p>He had truly experienced the power of a demon king. Though Ling You Wang's cultivation was reduced, his understanding of divine abilities and his precise control over his power were unmatched by Qin Sang.</p><p>In this level of confrontation, Ling You Wang's advantages were fully displayed.  Qin Sang had been several times outmaneuvered by Ling You Wang, missing crucial opportunities.</p><p>If not for the assistance of the Sky-Eye Butterfly, his wood spirit body would have likely been destroyed.</p><p>During the intense battle, Qin Sang and the Sky-Eye Butterfly were rapidly growing stronger, and Ling You Wang was constantly trying new strategies. The outcome remained uncertain.</p><p>More exhausting than the physical pain was the immense mental strain. Qin Sang had to focus all his attention on finding a solution within the jungle domain.</p><p>While he had other preparations elsewhere, sufficient to deal with other enemies, against Ling You Wang, he could only delay things.</p><p>Once forced out of the jungle domain, Qin Sang would likely have to rely on the Flower Field Formation to defend against Ling You Wang.</p><p>Even if he could ultimately escape, exposing the Flower Field was unacceptable to him.</p><p>Qin Sang wouldn't resort to that unless absolutely necessary.</p><p>As soon as Qin Sang stepped out from behind the tree trunk, he was engulfed by the downpour.</p><p>The black fish Dharma image lunged at him, its eyes flashing, its confidence starting to waver.</p><p>Ling You Wang hadn't expected Qin Sang to be so difficult. He lacked absolute confidence in winning this subtle contest.  He calculated that if the situation continued, he only had a 60% chance of victory.</p><p>Before this, Ling You Wang couldn't have imagined that his opponent could persevere to this point with his current cultivation.</p><p>A 60% chance meant any unforeseen event could alter the battle, even reverse it.</p><p>However, it wasn't yet time to retreat; his opponent was clearly only capable of defense.</p><p>Ling You Wang had left some markers on his way, wondering when Ding Xiang Hou and the others would arrive.</p><p>He didn't hold out much hope for their arrival. The dense illusions would likely prevent them from reaching him in time.</p><p>His thoughts flashed, Ling You Wang pondered silently, searching for Qin Sang's weaknesses while making calculations.</p><p>…</p><p>Outside the Heavenly Wall.</p><p>At the edge of the green spiritual wind, a fleeting figure clung to the Heavenly Wall, observing the battle below.</p><p>Zuo Zhenren was hidden there, perfectly silent, taking in the entire battlefield.</p><p>He seemed to be quite familiar with Ling You Wang.  His gaze swept across the scene before settling on Qin Sang, focusing his attention mainly on him.</p><p>When the Yunyou Sword appeared and deployed the sword array, Zuo Zhenren also observed the array.</p><p>After observing for a long time, Zuo Zhenren watched Qin Sang struggle to parry the attacks. He gently rubbed his two fingers together, and a streak of talisman light silently appeared.  Then, his lips moved slightly.</p><p>"What is your relationship with Zhi Jian?"</p><p>A voice, as thin as a mosquito's buzz, entered Qin Sang's ears.</p><p>Who's there?!</p><p>Qin Sang was startled.</p><p>There was a third person observing from the sidelines!</p><p>He and Ling You Wang had chased each other here, without seeing a single person along the way. He had assumed that the other cultivators and demonic cultivators had been drawn to the depths of the altar.</p><p>Using his strong will, Qin Sang appeared calm as he glanced at the black fish Dharma image. It showed no signs of having detected anyone in the shadows.</p><p>"The other party knows Zhi Jian. They sent a voice transmission to me; they must be a human cultivator.  They were able to hide their presence from Ling You Wang's perception.  Could they be a Grand Cultivator?"</p><p>Mulling it over, Qin Sang thought it was highly probable.</p><p>After a moment of consideration, he sent a wisp of his consciousness to contact the person. "I don't know which senior has arrived. I am Qing Feng, invited by Daoist Zhi Jian to cultivate on Sword Heart Island.  I often seek guidance from Daoist Zhi Jian in swordsmanship. He is both my teacher and friend…"</p><p>"Hehe…"</p><p>A faint chuckle echoed in his ears.  "No wonder my Daoist friend finds your swordsmanship so familiar."</p><p>After saying that, the other person fell silent.</p><p>Qin Sang's mind raced.</p><p>The other party had confirmed it; they were indeed a Grand Cultivator!</p><p>He had learned swordsmanship from Zhi Jian, inevitably influenced by him. Even if their sword techniques were different, his swordsmanship would naturally have traces of Zhi Jian's style.</p><p>This influence should not be very obvious, yet the other party saw through it at a glance.  Clearly, this Grand Cultivator was very familiar with Zhi Jian.</p><p>Judging by their tone, they were not an enemy of Zhi Jian.</p><p>For many years, Qin Sang had felt that Zhi Jian was very mysterious, unfathomable, yet he was connected to a Grand Cultivator!</p><p>The Grand Cultivator remained silent, and Qin Sang didn't speak either, waiting for a response.</p><p>"I am Zuo Feng Dao. You may have heard of me, or perhaps not…Since we are here, I also have old scores to settle with this old demon. Shall we eliminate this villain together?" Zuo Zhenren said coldly.</p><p>"Senior wants me as bait?" Qin Sang's heart was filled with suspicion.</p><p></p>
