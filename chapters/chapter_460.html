<h1>Chapter 453: High Noon</h1><p>This chaotic battle raged relentlessly.</p><p>Qin Sang had lost count of how many opponents he'd faced. All he could do was maintain his composure, carefully assess the situation, and never stray too far from his allies, refusing to let the fervor of battle cloud his judgment.</p><p>‘Bang!’</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>A sharp shattering sound drew Qin Sang's attention.</p><p>He saw Mu Yifeng's Ninefire Divine Blade shatter a corner of his opponent's golden shield. Several other talismans struck the shield in succession, leaving a deep crack running across its surface. It seemed like it could completely disintegrate at any moment.</p><p>His opponent, terrified, cried out and retreated in haste.</p><p>The Ninefire Divine Blade glowed crimson. Mu Yifeng was about to lead his men in pursuit when Qin Sang's expression suddenly shifted. "Don't chase! Come back!" he shouted.</p><p>The opponent appeared panicked, but their formation remained surprisingly organized.</p><p>More importantly, Qin Sang noticed that some enemies in the surrounding area seemed to be subtly observing their position. Their locations were strategically significant.</p><p>Quietly, an inconspicuous gap opened up ahead of them.</p><p>A trap, set at some unknown point, had silently taken shape, just waiting for them to fall in.</p><p>A cold sweat broke out on Qin Sang's back.</p><p>These men were decoys!</p><p>If they were blinded by the thrill of the chase, pursuing their fleeing enemy would be no different from walking into a trap. Teng Zhaogang had fallen prey to the same tactic years ago, and Qin Sang, having witnessed it firsthand, remembered it vividly.</p><p>"We're retreating too!"</p><p>Qin Sang transmitted his voice to Mu Yifeng, and they began an orderly withdrawal.</p><p>As expected, upon seeing their retreat, many Heavenly Firmament Alliance cultivators showed expressions of disappointment. Their seemingly fleeing opponents stopped, trying to lure them back.</p><p>Fortunately, Mu Yifeng and the others obeyed Qin Sang without question; otherwise, the consequences would have been dire.</p><p>Qin Sang quickly understood the reason: his squad was too conspicuous.</p><p>He had always prioritized survival.  Once the chaotic battle began, and everyone was preoccupied, he would instruct his teammates to maintain a low profile.</p><p>He only used the Ebony Sword to eliminate key figures, quickly moving to a different location to avoid becoming a target.</p><p>His reputation was built gradually, not through a single, glorious battle.</p><p>Now, with the powerful Mu Yifeng by his side, attracting attention was unavoidable.</p><p>Qin Sang's actions disrupted the Heavenly Firmament Alliance's plans.</p><p>For a brief moment, the battle around them came to a strange standstill.</p><p>"Consolidate the formation!"</p><p>Qin Sang seized the opportunity to contact the other captains, gathering the scattered forces and tightening their formation.  Then, another round of chaotic fighting ensued.</p><p>…</p><p>A ray of light fell on his face.</p><p>Qin Sang narrowed his eyes, suddenly realizing that this wasn't the light emitted by a talisman, but the morning sun!</p><p>He turned his head.</p><p>In the distant east, where the water met the sky, a fiery red glow appeared. The rising sun, seemingly just emerging from the watery depths, was still veiled by the morning mist.</p><p>Qin Sang finally realized: dawn had broken!</p><p>The battle had raged since the middle of the night. How many hours had passed?</p><p>His mind was still filled with the intensity of the fight, slightly dazed. Then, he suddenly realized something and looked up at the sky.</p><p>The battle between the Core Formation cultivators hadn't stopped!</p><p>And, that beam of light was still there.</p><p>Star Concealing Moon Hiding.</p><p>Under the rising sun, it appeared even brighter, a marvel to behold. However, the battlefield had shifted to the north of the beam, and Qin Sang had a bad feeling.</p><p>In the past, this would be the time for both sides to withdraw.</p><p>The battle had raged from midnight to dawn, with neither side gaining a clear advantage. The Heavenly Firmament Alliance held a slight upper hand, but the Small Cold Realm’s formation remained intact. Continuing the fight would likely only lead to exhaustion on both sides before a victor could be determined.</p><p>After a night of fierce fighting, both sides were worn out.</p><p>"There should be an order soon, right?"</p><p>Qin Sang gazed towards the Core Formation cultivators' battlefield, absentmindedly controlling his Cold Gold Sword and coordinating with Mu Yifeng.</p><p>Unfortunately, he miscalculated. After waiting for some time, the distant sky remained filled with dark, rolling clouds and flashes of lightning, showing no signs of stopping.</p><p>Qin Sang's heart sank.  Could they really be destined to fight to the bitter end here?</p><p>With a grim expression, he surveyed the surroundings and then suddenly transmitted his voice to Mu Yifeng.</p><p>Mu Yifeng, startled, looked at Qin Sang inquiringly.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded gravely. After a brief exchange, Qin Sang, using the excuse that Mu Yifeng was exhausted and needed to recover, instructed him to withdraw. Others stepped up to fill the gap.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang and Mu Yifeng took turns resting, maintaining the situation.  While it appeared that their squad's strength had decreased, putting them in a precarious position, everything was actually under Qin Sang's control.</p><p>As time went on, the battlefield began to change. The formations on both sides seemed to unravel. From afar, it looked like individual cultivators were fighting on their own, a disorganized mob brawling without any strategy.</p><p>Qin Sang dared not relax his vigilance. His gaze darted between the two battlefields, particularly the Core Formation cultivators' battle, but he couldn't discern any patterns.</p><p>The sun continued to rise.</p><p>Another hour passed.</p><p>Many cultivators were utterly exhausted. The fighting, though not as intense as it had been at the beginning, became even more grueling. Qin Sang became even more cautious as the casualties mounted.</p><p>Despite his foresight and early focus on conserving strength, he still felt overwhelmed, thankful he hadn't resorted to using the Ebony Sword.</p><p>Others were in far worse shape.</p><p>Time dragged on, each moment an agonizing eternity.</p><p>Hour after hour.</p><p>When the sun reached its zenith.</p><p>Precisely at mid-day.</p><p>A sudden change occurred!</p><p>Above the Core Formation cultivators' battlefield, a point of light descended from the sky.</p><p>It was initially so inconspicuous that even Qin Sang, who had been closely observing the area, hadn't noticed it.  Only when the light grew larger, reaching the top of the dark clouds, did he become aware of its presence.</p><p>Within the light was a gleaming silver talisman.</p><p>Qin Sang's heart tightened. He stared intently, following the talisman's descent.</p><p>Throughout the three-year standoff, this was the first time such a talisman had appeared. Who had sent it?</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't the only one to notice. More and more people looked up to observe.</p><p>The talisman's speed increased, plummeting into the dark clouds and rapidly expanding. When it reached its limit, it shattered silently.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>In an instant, the clouds dispersed, and the lightning vanished.</p><p>The figures of the Core Formation cultivators were finally revealed.</p><p>They were still engaged in a fierce battle.</p><p>As expected of Core Formation experts, they showed none of the exhaustion of the other cultivators.  Each exchange, each clash of their magical weapons, still carried terrifying power.</p><p>The appearance of the talisman caught everyone by surprise.  The intense fighting paused briefly.</p><p>‘Whoosh…whoosh…’</p><p>A gentle wind blew, carrying a force even the Core Formation cultivators couldn't resist.</p><p>Everyone was involuntarily separated from their opponents. The Small Cold Realm’s side was blown back, while the Heavenly Firmament Alliance was pushed south, the beam of light standing precisely between them.</p><p>They looked at each other in bewilderment, ceasing their attacks.</p><p>At the same time, several blurry figures appeared in the sky.</p>
