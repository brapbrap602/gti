<h1>Chapter 1393: The Black Swamp</h1><p>Seeing these threads,</p><p>Qin Sang paused, his expression growing more serious.</p><p>Then,</p><p>he tried to tug on a thread.</p><p>Initially, there was nothing unusual.</p><p>Inside the cave, the ice casket glowed, illuminating Qin Sang's solemn face.</p><p>After a while,</p><p>a sudden change occurred!</p><p>Without warning, the ice casket violently shook, emitting a blinding white light, and an extremely powerful wave surged out, rebounding along Qin Sang's force.</p><p>Qin Sang's hair stood on end, a terrifying feeling gripped his heart, his face changed slightly, and he quickly retracted his hand.</p><p>The ice casket gradually returned to normal.</p><p>Qin Sang stared intently at the ice casket, recalling the mysterious power he had just felt, and then discovered that the seal on the ice casket had changed.</p><p>The new sealing power was completely different from before.</p><p>All his efforts had been in vain.</p><p>"This is... a double safeguard left by the Xuan Tian Palace to prevent others from stealing their treasures and breaking the seal?"</p><p>Qin Sang had a faint guess.</p><p>He was silent for a moment, then tried again, with the same result.</p><p>The sealing power on the ice casket was extremely strong, unlike anything Qin Sang had ever seen before, and this change made breaking the seal even more difficult.</p><p>Even if he managed to break the seal with great difficulty, there was no guarantee that this power wouldn't change again.</p><p>The Xuan Tian Palace had truly gone to great lengths.</p><p>Don't even think about opening the casket in a short time.</p><p>"If Bai Zai were here, he might have a way to deal with these strange things."</p><p>Qin Sang furrowed his brow.</p><p>With no other choice, Qin Sang was about to put away the ice casket when he suddenly remembered something.</p><p>"Does the Xuan Tian Palace only have this one safeguard for such an important treasure?"</p><p>After hesitating for a moment,</p><p>Qin Sang focused his mind, and a Fire Lotus Seed flew out from his forehead, separating a wisp of demonic fire to form a fine fire net that adhered to the surface of the ice casket.</p><p>The ice casket became a fire casket.</p><p>Qin Sang added a layer of demonic fire seal to the surface of the ice casket, using the demonic fire's aura to isolate the casket.</p><p>This was all he could do.</p><p>"It's best not to go to the Yinri Realm before opening the ice casket,"</p><p>Qin Sang thought to himself, putting away the ice casket and taking out the Luofeng Jade and the Jincheng Sword.</p><p>In Qin Sang's plan, refining the Jincheng Sword required two more types of spiritual objects. The Luofeng Jade met the requirements, and its quality was even higher than Qin Sang had anticipated.</p><p>If he couldn't wait, he could try refining it.</p><p>However, this refinement would attempt to upgrade the Jincheng Sword to the top-grade, which would be a test for both the artifact and the refiner.</p><p>If the upgrade failed, it might damage the artifact itself.</p><p>Out of caution, he decided to wait a little longer.</p><p>After that, Qin Sang remained stationed on Hunting Dawn Island.</p><p>In the outside world,</p><p>the humans and demons waged a fierce war.</p><p>The war raged, even spreading to the Star Sand Islands.</p><p>Both sides suffered heavy casualties.</p><p>Blood stained the sea red, countless corpses and limbs floated along the currents, everywhere, especially those of demons.</p><p>The victor was decided in just a few months.</p><p>Even at the end, when the demons were defeated, Bifang rarely appeared on the battlefield, confirming Qin Sang's and his companionsâ€™ suspicions. Although the cunning fox and other demons invited some help, they could not resist the human offensive, suffered heavy losses, and fled back to the demon realm with their remaining forces.</p><p>The beasts that had been entrenched between the Star Sand Islands and the Xuan Yue Realm were mostly eliminated, and the shipping lanes were restored and increasingly prosperous.</p><p>Qin Sang also made several Daoist friends on the Star Sand Islands.</p><p>After the war ended,</p><p>Qin Sang attended a victory banquet hosted by Feng Shangshi on Fengyang Mountain.</p><p>He had personally experienced several battles.</p><p>Those demon kings fled as soon as the situation turned unfavorable.</p><p>Although he didn't kill any demon kings, he looted quite a few treasures from their lairs, adding them to his Qianjun Ring.  When he has a chance, he will attend more trading events and auctions to acquire the necessary spiritual objects to enhance the Jincheng Sword.</p><p>A month later,</p><p>two streams of light flew out from Fengyang Mountain, heading south.</p><p>They were Qin Sang and Feng Shangshi.</p><p>"Thank you, Daoist Feng, for accompanying me," Qin Sang thanked him.</p><p>Feng Shangshi laughed, "I haven't even mentioned that I kept you waiting.  It's all thanks to your valiant efforts that we were able to drive away the cunning fox and the other demons so quickly. Otherwise, if we had dragged it out, and they had summoned a Great Sage, there would have been many more uncertainties. Besides, I was just going to visit an old friend in the Southern Territory, and I happen to be passing by the Hundred Flowers Valley."</p><p>"I heard that the Hundred Flowers Valley is very low-key, and outsiders can't even find its mountain gate?"</p><p>Qin Sang didn't place all his hopes on Feng Shangshi alone.</p><p>During this time, he had been inquiring about the Hundred Flowers Valley whenever he had the chance.</p><p>The Hundred Flowers Valley was very famous, and the cultivators of the Star Sand Islands all knew about it.</p><p>Actually, the title of "best insect master" wasn't that remarkable. Their unique ability spread their reputation far and wide.</p><p>Cultivators specializing in insect control were rare in the cultivation world.</p><p>Cultivating spirit insects is slow, and most cultivators are unwilling to spend their energy on it.  Most who keep spirit insects do so because they accidentally found one with unique abilities and kept it as a tool.</p><p>Qin Sang, having learned from the Wu tribe's secret art of raising insects as companions, cultivates Sky Eye Butterflies using her own blood. Their growth rate is faster than other spirit insects, but still slow compared to cultivators.</p><p>How to improve further remains a mystery.  Of course, the Wu tribe's inheritance certainly extends beyond what she learned.  At the time, her cultivation was insufficient, and she couldn't access more advanced techniques.</p><p>Sadly, she can't go back.</p><p>Master Feng said, "I heard from Daoist Mu that it's a tradition of Hundred Flowers Valley: unless provoked, they never actively participate in the conflicts of the cultivation world. They simply shut themselves off to tend their flowers and insects. Many have heard of Hundred Flowers Valley near Blackwater Bay, but can't find their mountain gate."</p><p>The Daoist Mu he mentioned is the current valley master of Hundred Flowers Valley.</p><p>Blackwater Bay is located on the eastern coast, near the center of Crescent Island.</p><p>On the land bordering Blackwater Bay lies a vast swamp that nearly bisects Crescent Island, known as the Black Mire, dividing the island into what's commonly called the Southern and Northern Territories.</p><p>The Black Mire emits a foul odor and is extremely dangerous. Most of it is unsuitable for cultivation.  Few cultivation sects are located here.</p><p>Hundred Flowers Valley's location here offers relative peace.</p><p>"Such a sect is truly rare,"</p><p>Qin Sang exclaimed.</p><p>Secluding oneself from the world and avoiding conflict is merely an ideal in the cultivation world.</p><p>Master Feng reflected, "In casual conversation with Daoist Mu, I heard that the founder of Hundred Flowers Valley came from the Boundless Sea.  Alone, they traveled thousands of miles to establish their sect in Crescent Territory, completely isolated and without support.  Perhaps that's why they wish to avoid being entangled in the local cultivators' disputes.  Fortunately, Hundred Flowers Valley has remained strong, and the Black Mire acts as a buffer, allowing them to maintain their detached position."</p><p>Pausing, Master Feng continued, "The reason Hundred Flowers Valley is so renowned is their mastery of insect cultivation as their core practice.  In truth, several other groups are also skilled in insect control, but as a secondary skill, such as Star Mountain and the Thousand Saliva Alliance. However, I don't have any connections with them to introduce you."</p><p>Qin Sang thanked him.  She had already investigated the sects Master Feng mentioned.  "Thank you for the tip, Daoist. I intend to visit each one after leaving Hundred Flowers Valley."</p><p>Master Feng nodded and shared more about Hundred Flowers Valley, mostly rumors and anecdotes, avoiding any real secrets.</p><p>Qin Sang carefully memorized everything.</p>
