<h1></h1><p>'Boom!'</p><p>A deafening roar interrupted their exchange.</p><p>The group fell silent, collectively turning their gazes towards the center where the two mountain ranges converged.</p><p>Scarlet flames surged from the mountain pass.</p><p>Extremely dense scarlet flame energy formed a massive pillar of fire, soaring into the heavens.</p><p>On the surface of the mountain pass, the '�d' character seal, like a golden decree, floated in the void, its faint golden light enveloping the entire mountain pass, while the inside was a glaring expanse of crimson.</p><p>Even with the seal in place, the scarlet flame energy was still able to create such a powerful display.</p><p>It was difficult to imagine how terrifying the power accumulated beneath the seal was.</p><p>It was on the verge of breaking free.</p><p>The entire Pure Sea Sect (Quiet Ocean Sect) was about to face a calamitous event.</p><p>'Rumble rumble...'</p><p>The earth-shattering roars continued, and the ground shook.</p><p>The mountain pass and the seal were the source.</p><p>At this moment, they could clearly see that the '�d' character seal covering the mountain pass was in a very unstable state. The seal itself was constantly rotating, but its speed was decreasing, and the waning (slowing) power of the seal was clearly perceivable.</p><p>The seal had already begun to show signs of bulging, and the surrounding golden light was gradually dissipating.</p><p>This sight was clearly a sign that the seal was about to collapse.</p><p>Standing where they were, a distance away from the mountain pass, they could feel the incomparably violent power beneath the seal, causing their scalps to tingle.</p><p>Seeing this scene, the expressions of the several Nascent Soul cultivators turned somber.</p><p>Even without knowing the origin and history of the Pure Sea Sect (Quiet Ocean Sect), seeing the scene before them, they could tell that once the seal collapsed, the Pure Sea Sect (Quiet Ocean Sect) would be completely erased from the world.</p><p>They even suspected that the Pure Sea Sect (Quiet Ocean Sect)'s abandonment of their sect and the disappearance of all its members was related to that place.</p><p>Chijie Zhenren's (Precept Master) initial excitement was suppressed, and he exclaimed in alarm, "The seal is about to collapse, what a coincidence, we just entered... Could it be that breaking the formation triggered the change?"</p><p>Yu Yi Yuanjun's (Feather Robe Immortal Monarch) eyes kept flickering.</p><p>She was first attracted by the scarlet flame pillar and the mountain pass seal, then, as if discovering something, she looked at the Golden Summit, the Buddha Pagoda, and the Spirit Array above, through which they had just passed.</p><p>Hearing Chijie Zhenren's (Precept Master) words, Yu Yi Yuanjun (Feather Robe Immortal Monarch) snorted, "Chijie (Precept) fellow cultivator, haven't you seen it yet? The '�d' character gold seal is only part of it. Inside the Pure Sea Sect (Quiet Ocean Sect), all the restrictions, including the Golden Summit and the Buddha Pagoda, and the Sect Protecting Grand Array above, have been forcibly kneaded together with great divine power, merged into one, forming a complete seal, with their qi mechanisms connected to each other, supporting each other. Damaging any one of them will weaken the entire seal, even causing it to collapse..."</p><p>Chijie Zhenren's (Precept Master) expression was sheepish.</p><p>His understanding of the Pure Sea Sect (Quiet Ocean Sect) came from his master.</p><p>And his master, Jiu Jie (Nine Precepts), knew very little, unaware of the reason and process of the Pure Sea Sect (Quiet Ocean Sect)'s disappearance.</p><p>At this moment, the Hunmo Laoren (Chaos Demon Old Man), who had been silent all along, holding his black bamboo staff, suddenly spoke, "Not forcibly kneaded together. These restrictions were originally connected. The Pure Sea Sect (Quiet Ocean Sect) may have had a premonition from the very beginning of its founding."</p><p>As soon as he said this, everyone else was stunned.</p><p>"Fellow cultivator's judgment should be correct," Yu Yi Yuanjun's (Feather Robe Immortal Monarch) expression became even more grave, staring intently at the mountain pass, "Inside here, is it not just pure scarlet flame energy, but also something else sealed?"</p><p>Hearing Yu Yi Yuanjun's (Feather Robe Immortal Monarch)'s words, they felt even more creeped out (goosebumps arose even more).</p><p>The power displayed by the Pure Sea Sect (Quiet Ocean Sect)'s Sect Protecting Grand Array was enough to illustrate the strength of this Buddhist Sect.</p><p>Why was such a prestigious Buddhist sect little known and then suddenly disappeared without a trace?</p><p>Chijie Zhenren (Precept Master) chuckled dryly, "Let's not speculate randomly. Things have come to this point; it's irreversible. Yu Yi Xianzi (Feather Robe Fairy) said just now that Huang Laogui (Old Devil Huang) gathered a few old guys half a month ago, secretly plotting something in his cave. They must have received the news and won't miss this. They are probably already inside, breaking the formation. Let's get the treasures first and talk about other things. After spending so much effort, we can't return empty-handed..."</p><p>As he spoke, he stole glances at Hunmo Laoren (Chaos Demon Old Man).</p><p>Since Hunmo Laoren (Chaos Demon Old Man) and Yu Yi Yuanjun (Feather Robe Immortal Monarch) didn't move, he didn't dare to act without authorization, and could only feel secretly anxious.</p><p>The other two early-stage Nascent Soul cultivators remained silent, but their gazes kept shifting between the Golden Summit and the Buddha Pagoda.</p><p>These two places were too special, obviously important Buddhist sites.</p><p>"In case something unexpected happens, it's up to you fellow cultivators. Don't release some great demon, causing chaos to the Boundless Sea (Limitless Ocean). The beauties on this Immortal's island are all made of jade, collected with great difficulty, and can't withstand the turmoil."</p><p>Yu Yi Yuanjun (Feather Robe Immortal Monarch) withdrew her gaze from the mountain pass, her expression lazy but extremely seductive.</p><p>She curled her lips slightly, "This is quite different from what the two of you said before. The time left for us to retrieve the treasure is not much. It's impossible to explore carefully, little by little, and slowly comprehend the method of breaking the restriction."</p><p>*Then why are you wasting time here!*</p><p>*It's just a cauldron, if it dies, I'll just replace it with another batch.*</p><p>Chijie Zhenren (Precept Master) cursed inwardly.</p><p>Hunmo Laoren (Chaos Demon Old Man) paused his hand on the black bamboo staff, his tone indifferent, "Opening the Golden Summit Great Hall and the Thirteen-Story Buddha Pagoda should still be in time. To prevent the seal from collapsing midway, let's act together. Choose for yourselves."</p><p>Chijie Zhenren (Precept Master) and the other two remained silent.</p><p>Yu Yi Yuanjun (Feather Robe Immortal Monarch) asked, "Which place does Hunmo (Chaos Demon) fellow cultivator choose?"</p><p>"Golden Summit!"</p><p>Hunmo Laoren (Chaos Demon Old Man) lightly uttered the two words, his turbid eyeballs fixed on the Golden Summit, ignoring others, and with a slight movement, he flew towards the Golden Summit.</p><p>Yu Yi Yuanjun (Feather Robe Immortal Monarch) giggled and made an unexpected decision. "I believe fellow cultivator's judgment. The treasures in the Golden Summit will not disappoint this Immortal."</p><p>The two strongest people actually chose to go to the Golden Summit Great Hall.</p><p>This was something the other three hadn't expected.</p><p>Chijie Zhenren (Precept Master) almost couldn't suppress the joy in his heart, and said in a steady voice, "With senior and Yu Yi Xianzi (Feather Robe Fairy) taking action, success is assured. I'll go to the Buddha Pagoda, the restrictions there seem to be weaker."</p><p>At this moment, the tall cultivator who had been expressionless and seemed detached from the outside world, his ears twitched slightly, imperceptibly glanced at Yu Yi Yuanjun's (Feather Robe Immortal Monarch) back, and pondered for a while, "I'll go to the Buddha Pagoda too."</p><p>The two flew towards the Buddha Pagoda almost side by side.</p><p>Chijie Zhenren (Precept Master) slightly turned his head, smilingly said, "Fellow cultivator Sanyin (Three Yin), we must cooperate sincerely, so as not to fall behind senior and Yu Yi Xianzi (Feather Robe Fairy) and miss the Buddha treasures."</p><p>That Nascent Soul with the Dharma name Sanyin (Three Yin) only nodded lightly.</p><p>At this time, only the last person was left, still standing in place, hesitating.</p><p>The worry on his face diminished slightly.</p><p>Looking at the other four, he couldn't figure out their relationships.</p><p>He knew that these people were definitely not as harmonious as they appeared on the surface and wanted to avoid the center of the vortex, but throughout the entire Pure Sea Sect (Quiet Ocean Sect), he couldn't find a third place that could compare with the Golden Summit and the Buddha Pagoda.</p><p>Even if there were treasures hidden in the dark, by the time he found them, the seal would probably have collapsed.</p><p>After hesitating for a moment, he stamped his foot and chased after Chijie Zhenren (Precept Master) and Sanyin (Three Yin).</p><p>The five Nascent Soul cultivators split into two groups.</p><p>Yu Yi Xianzi (Feather Robe Fairy) lagged behind Hunmo Laoren (Chaos Demon Old Man) by half a body, giggling, "Fellow cultivator can tell me now, what exactly did you come for? I might as well avoid it, lest I accidentally take away the treasure you fancy and cause trouble for no reason. This Immortal doesn't want to follow in the footsteps of those old guys and die for no reason."</p>
