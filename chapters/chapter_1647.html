<h1></h1><p>The Avatar's attack was insidious.</p><p>The Ice Soul Divine Light blocked the strange-faced man's retreat.</p><p>At the same time, the strange-faced man also had to face the threat of the Seven Souls Killing Formation.</p><p>The strange-faced man's meticulously planned ambush against Qin Sang had failed, instead trapping himself in a precarious situation.</p><p>Divine light surged.</p><p>The vast, white, icy煞energy froze the space wherever it passed.</p><p>The strange-faced man felt the chill penetrate his protective True Essence, as if it was about to freeze his very lifeblood. Secretly alarmed, he instinctively summoned his Wooden Armor to meet the attack.</p><p>This treasure had protected him several times, proving its worth.</p><p>The Wooden Armor appeared above the strange-faced man's head, shimmering with light as the shadow of an ancient tree stretched between heaven and earth.</p><p>Unexpectedly, just as the ancient tree was about to fully form, the Divine Light's speed suddenly surged, instantly sweeping down, giving the impression that it had pierced straight through the tree's shadow.</p><p>The Ice Soul Divine Light excelled in stealth and speed. Although the Avatar's movements after refining the Ice Disc's icy煞energy were no longer concealed, the Divine Light's speed had only increased.</p><p>The Avatar, having observed the pattern of the Wooden Armor during their exchange, had deliberately restrained the Divine Light's speed to mislead the strange-faced man and lure out the armor.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>In an instant, the Wooden Armor was engulfed by the Ice Soul Divine Light.</p><p>The still-forming ancient tree shook violently and abruptly shattered.</p><p>Within the vast white divine light, only the Wooden Armor itself shone with a rich green light, as profound ice rapidly congealed around its edges.</p><p>The Wooden Armor tumbled erratically, a continuous stream of green light pouring out. Unfortunately, this treasure was primarily defensive and couldn't break through the profound ice, quickly becoming sealed within a thick ice platform.</p><p>With one move, the strange-faced man's defensive treasure was disabled.</p><p>The Snow-Treading Divine Saber followed close behind.</p><p>Saber energy arced like a rainbow!</p><p>By now, Qin Sang's true body had also recovered. The Sun God Tree was hidden in his sleeve, the Sun God Birds poised to strike, waiting for the right moment.</p><p>Once saber and sword united, the strange-faced man would face certain death!</p><p>To an ordinary observer, the strange-faced man had no room to maneuver. He could either choose a direction and attempt a desperate breakout or surrender.</p><p>“Trivial tricks!”</p><p>The strange-faced man snorted coldly, slapping his palm against his dantian.</p><p>A crimson light shot out from his dantian. Within the light was the illusory image of a spiritual tree.</p><p>The spiritual tree hovered before the strange-faced man, no taller than seven feet. Compared to the other ancient trees in the jungle, it seemed relatively young.</p><p>The spiritual tree's leaves were crimson, shining brilliantly as if magma flowed through its veins. The grey trunk was covered in cracks, resembling parched earth, yet exuding an ancient, vigorous aura.</p><p>Its well-developed roots, also crimson, were tightly intertwined.</p><p>The crimson light emanating from the spiritual tree connected to the strange-faced man's dantian, their energies merging seamlessly. The roots also swayed towards him, as if taking root within his body.</p><p>“A Crimson Profound Ancient Tree?”</p><p>Qin Sang's pupils constricted. He then realized that the ancient tree wasn't a manifestation of some divine ability but a tangible entity, which surprised him even more.</p><p>The Ebony Sword required devouring spiritual wood to upgrade. Therefore, wherever he went, Qin Sang would gather information about spiritual wood. He had heard of the Crimson Profound Ancient Tree but didn't know much about its power.</p><p>The strange-faced man had refined an entire spiritual tree and rooted it within his body.</p><p>This kind of divine ability was something Qin Sang had never seen before.</p><p>At that moment, the strange-faced man swiftly formed a hand seal and pressed it against the trunk of the Crimson Profound Ancient Tree. The tree trembled and plummeted downwards.</p><p>As it fell, the Crimson Profound Ancient Tree shifted from tangible to illusory, vanishing completely the moment it touched the ground, as if it had burrowed underground.</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze became grave.</p><p>In this moment, the jungle transformed. The feeling was completely different from before. Earlier, the strange-faced man had manipulated the motes of light using the wooden beads. Now, Qin Sang felt as if the entire jungle was connected by a strange force, becoming a single entity.</p><p>At the same time, a crimson light erupted behind the strange-faced man. The illusory image of the ancient tree reappeared behind him, then flashed and merged into his body.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>Crimson light soared to the heavens!</p><p>The strange-faced man leapt down from the air. The moment he landed, the earth was struck by an astonishing force. A booming sound resonated, like the beating of a war drum.</p><p>The tremors spread outwards, sending ripples through the jungle canopy. Several of the outlying halls on the edge of the jungle collapsed.</p><p>Even more shockingly, the strange-faced man disappeared upon landing, replaced by a towering giant. His skin was rough like bark, his arms and fingers long and slender like branches, resembling a spirit awakened from an ancient tree.</p><p>The giant's facial features vaguely resembled the strange-faced man's.</p><p>With the strange-faced man's feet planted firmly on the ground, Qin Sang had the feeling that he was a tree rooted here, an immortal monument within this jungle!</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>The Snow-Treading Divine Saber slashed through the air.</p><p>A blizzard descended.</p><p>The strange-faced man's hair instantly turned white.</p><p>He raised his head, his expression, combined with his rough skin, appearing even more ferocious. With a savage grin, he twitched his right shoulder and threw a heavy punch.</p><p>The blizzard stalled where the fist wind reached.</p><p>Snowflakes shattered, the scene resembling the shattering of the void itself, leaving a clear path in the blizzard.  A fist image appeared beneath the Snow-Treading Divine Saber's blade, unafraid of the sharp edge, striking out with a single punch!</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>Fist and saber clashed.</p><p>The Snow-Treading Divine Saber trembled violently. The Avatar's breath hitched as he felt an immense force transmitted through the saber. His body shuddered, nearly thrown backwards.</p><p>The Avatar's expression was grave as he channeled his cultivation technique with all his might, steadying himself. The Snow-Treading Divine Saber, however, couldn't withstand the force. With a ringing sound, the saber was jolted upwards. While it wasn't sent flying, its relentless offensive was momentarily halted.</p><p>Fortunately, the sword formation had closed in by now, pulling the strange-faced man into the array.</p><p>Both the Golden Sinking Sword and the Snow-Treading Divine Saber were magical treasures. However, one was wielded by the true body and the other by the Avatar. Moreover, Qin Sang's swordsmanship and saber techniques were worlds apart, resulting in a vast difference in power.</p><p>Seen from above,</p><p>A dark space was sealed off within the jungle by the sword formation. The strange-faced man, trapped within the array, became a blurred figure surrounded by a dense swarm of sword threads, radiating murderous intent!</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>The sword threads lashed out.</p><p>The strange-faced man howled repeatedly, his fists whirling like wheels.  A constant barrage of booming sounds resonated as he countered the attack solely with his fists, shattering countless sword threads.</p><p>The strange-faced man was inevitably cut by the sword threads. However, a layer of crimson light flowed beneath his skin, combined with his bark-like hide. It seemed he wasn't in mortal danger in the short term.</p><p>“Such immense strength!”</p><p>Qin Sang stared at the strange-faced man's fists, detecting no other treasures.</p><p>This indicated that the strength was derived from a divine ability.</p><p>Their previous exchanges had shown that this man couldn't be a body cultivator. Yet, through the Crimson Profound Ancient Tree and some peculiar divine ability, he had obtained a spiritual wood body and could merge with this ancient jungle, undergoing a heaven-and-earth-shaking transformation.</p><p>Qin Sang thought to himself that it was fortunate he hadn't placed his hopes on the treasure given by the Myriad Venom Mountain. With the resilience of this man's spiritual wood body, suppressing the violent poison within his body shouldn't be too difficult.</p><p>However, although his transformation into a spiritual wood body greatly increased his strength, it also made him seem clumsy…</p><p>A subtle change flickered across Qin Sang's face. He flashed to a position above the sword formation, flicking his sleeve.  A crimson flame shot out, revealing another spiritual tree.</p><p>The difference was, this was a tree of fire!</p><p>As the Sun God Tree appeared, three Sun God Birds took flight, merging in mid-air into a raging inferno that instantly hurtled towards the strange-faced man.</p><p>Sensing the violent aura of the Southern Bright Ember Fire, the strange-faced man's howls abruptly ceased. His expression changed drastically as he jerked back, retreating hastily.</p><p>But he was currently trapped within the sword formation, unable to dodge freely.</p><p>Just as the strange-faced man seemed trapped, with the Sun God Birds about to reach him,</p><p>Suddenly, his entire body stiffened, the luster of his skin rapidly fading as he bizarrely transformed into a withered, dead tree.  At the same time, a faint energy flow stirred within the shadowed depths of the jungle.</p><p>Qin Sang's face darkened. It was too late to alter the Sun God Birds' trajectory.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>Spiritual fire engulfed the ground.</p><p>Flames raged.</p><p>The withered tree instantly turned to ash, along with a large swathe of the surrounding jungle.</p><p>“Is this your trump card?”</p><p>The strange-faced man's voice echoed from the jungle beyond the scorched earth.</p><p>An ancient tree swayed, its leaves turning yellow and withering at a visible pace.</p><p>Cracking sounds emanated from within the trunk as a tree-man emerged.  He looked at Qin Sang, sneering, returning Qin Sang's taunt word for word.</p><p>The clumsy appearance of his spiritual wood body had been a deliberate act, meant to bait Qin Sang into revealing his trump card.  It had worked.</p><p>However, the strange-faced man wasn't as relaxed as he appeared. Upon seeing the Sun God Tree, a flicker of fear crossed his eyes. He finally understood why Su Zinan had called this man a fire demon!</p><p>Demonic fire and a fire tree, with these two spiritual fires alone, this man could run rampant throughout the cultivation world.</p><p>He also greatly regretted his arrogance. He should have retreated decisively when the Weeping Spirit Cave Master was struck.  Now, he was in a difficult position.</p><p>Hearing the taunt, Qin Sang's expression remained impassive.  Using his divine sense and Heavenly Eye divine ability, he keenly perceived that the strange-faced man's movements weren't entirely untraceable.  Furthermore, his aura became unstable after reappearing, indicating that this divine ability came with a significant burden.</p><p>Leaving the Sun God Tree hovering beside him, Qin Sang raised his right arm, reaching towards the distant vortex of deathly energy. His fingers formed a claw, gripping tightly.  The demonic fire within the vortex abruptly contracted, forming a lotus shape.</p><p>However, the demonic fire wasn't fully refined. The edges of the lotus appeared illusory, and some demonic fire remained outside, swirling around it.</p><p>As the demonic fire's power concentrated to its peak, the lotus trembled, radiating a force that seemed capable of shattering mountains and splitting the earth. A rumbling sound emanated from the center of the deathly energy vortex.</p><p>The vortex collapsed, countless strands of deathly energy scattering outwards.  Losing the strange-faced man's control, they quickly reverted to their original form as wood spiritual energy.</p><p>The jungle was instantly showered in green light.</p><p>Qin Sang pointed his finger again. The lotus expanded, transforming into a massive ring of fire large enough to cover most of the jungle, descending from the sky.</p><p>‘Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!’</p><p>Raging flames scorched the heavens.</p><p>Ancient trees crumbled.</p><p>Since the strange-faced man intended to utilize the jungle's terrain to his advantage, Qin Sang would simply incinerate the entire jungle!</p><p>Flames erupted, a black wall of fire encircling the battlefield.  Ancient trees were everywhere in the jungle, many of which had become spiritual wood due to their age, but they were no match for the Nine Nether Demonic Fire.</p><p>Dust billowed.</p><p>The wall of fire advanced inwards, the scorched earth rapidly expanding.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>At the edge of the fire wall, a tree had just transformed into a tree-man.  The strange-faced man, wanting to retreat, leapt towards this spot, but his connection to the outer jungle was severed by the Nine Nether Demonic Fire, forcing him out.</p><p>The strange-faced man hadn't expected Qin Sang to find the key so quickly.</p><p>After Zhu Wudao had sent him the Crimson Profound Ancient Tree, he had begun refining the Acquired Wooden Man Stele.</p><p>This divine ability was a core inheritance of the Wood Aspect Hall. Before reaching mastery, it could only unleash its full power in places rich with wood spiritual energy. He had spent most of his time cultivating the Gu King, leaving insufficient time for this practice, and was still some distance from mastering it.</p><p>No longer in the mood for taunts, the strange-faced man flashed, attempting to break through the demonic fire blockade.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>The Ice Soul Divine Light reappeared.</p><p>Seeing that the Snow-Treading Divine Saber posed little threat to this man, the Avatar sheathed the saber and focused on controlling the Divine Light.</p><p>The sword formation followed close behind.</p><p>The strange-faced man was first coated in a layer of frost, then ensnared by the sword threads.  No matter how resilient his spiritual wood body, it couldn't endure this.</p><p>Qin Sang even summoned the three Sun God Birds directly. He now had some control over them, no longer restricted to an irreversible attack. The divine birds circled above, poised to strike.</p><p>However, if the strange-faced man didn't dodge, the Sun God Birds would do more than just posture.</p><p>Furthermore, Qin Sang occasionally employed the Soul-Seizing Mantra.  Even with precautions, the strange-faced man couldn't completely avoid the stabbing pain that assaulted his Nascent Soul.</p><p>After several failed attempts to escape,</p><p>Anxiety gradually crept onto the strange-faced man's face.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>Crimson flames surged skyward.</p><p>Controlling the Sun God Birds for too long, while also managing the demonic fire and sword formation, exceeded Qin Sang's capacity, forcing him to attack.</p><p>As expected, the Sun God Birds missed again.</p><p>The strange-faced man's movement range was greatly reduced. He reappeared in another location, immediately confronted by the Divine Light and sword formation.  Unexpectedly, he deviated from his usual pattern, not immediately counterattacking, but instead looking at Qin Sang with what seemed like a sneer.</p><p>Noticing the strange-faced man's expression, Qin Sang's eyes narrowed.  A sense of inexplicable danger washed over him.  Without hesitation, he flapped his phoenix wings, soaring into the sky.</p><p>The strange-faced man's brow bulged as a blood-red beetle emerged from between his eyebrows.</p><p>In a short time, the jade beetle had turned completely crimson, exuding a sinister aura.</p><p>The blood beetle wriggled between his eyebrows, distorting his facial features. Despite the resilience of his spiritual wood body, his aura fluctuated erratically, clearly suffering backlash.</p><p>He squeezed out a sinister whisper, “Take my Heaven Severing Soul-Shaking Needle!  You won't survive this!”</p><p>‘Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!’</p><p>After the collapse of the deathly energy vortex, the motes of light scattered throughout the jungle.</p><p>Suddenly, all the motes of light surrounding the strange-faced man rose into the air.</p><p>Within each mote was the illusory image of a jade beetle.</p><p>Earlier, when the strange-faced man had launched his three poisonous light attacks, knowing from the Weeping Spirit Cave Master that Qin Sang's divine sense was exceptionally strong, he had anticipated the possibility of being detected and had prepared a backup plan.</p><p>If he succeeded, all was well.  If he failed, he could secretly make preparations under the cover of the poisonous light, converting the motes of light into the power of the jade beetles, until Qin Sang's Sun God Tree was forced out. Then, at the moment of transition between old and new power, he would reveal his killing move!</p><p>The Heaven Severing Soul-Shaking Needle possessed incredible power. Unfortunately, even with his late Nascent Soul cultivation, it required extensive preparation and couldn't be easily deployed.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>The motes transformed into poisonous needles, their tips gleaming with a cold, sinister light.</p><p>All the poisonous needles aimed at Qin Sang, firing simultaneously!</p><p>Although the needles were fast, Qin Sang had been wary of the strange-faced man, maintaining his distance and moving with lightning speed.  The poisonous needles seemed unable to catch up.</p><p>Crimson light erupted from the strange-faced man's brow as he muttered a low incantation, a cacophony of buzzing wings filling the air.</p><p>The next moment, an astonishing scene unfolded.</p><p>The blood beetle detached from the strange-faced man's brow, flying through the air to a position below the poisonous needles.  Its eyes fixed on Qin Sang, gleaming with ferocious bloodlust. The poisonous needles instantly fused, transforming into a single, hair-thin blood needle.</p><p>The blood needle flashed, traversing the void and catching up to Qin Sang.</p>
