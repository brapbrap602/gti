<h1>Chapter 1481: Slaying the Serpents</h1><p>The light mirror bought Shang Lu precious time.  </p><p>His mind was preoccupied with the Serpent Banner, and he had not anticipated that Liuli had already mastered the full power of the Frost Soul Divine Light. Caught off guard, he had no time to dodge.  </p><p>If not for this treasure protecting him at the critical moment, the outcome would have already been decided.  </p><p>Because what he faced was not only the Frost Soul Divine Light but also Qin Sang's Golden Sinking Sword. He was caught between two deadly forces.  </p><p>*Crack!*  </p><p>A series of explosive sounds rang out from the light mirror in front of Shang Lu.  </p><p>The mirror quickly became covered in cracks, its surface coated with a layer of frost. Before it could unleash its full power, it was frozen and rendered useless.  </p><p>The Frost Soul Divine Light surged forward silently.  </p><p>Liuli no longer concealed her power, and the bone-chilling cold sent shivers down Shang Lu's spine.  </p><p>The first divine ability of the Listening Snow Pavilion truly lived up to its reputation.  </p><p>At the same time, the roar of a sword echoed across the sky. A sword beam shot through the air, leaving a dazzling rainbow in the night sky, exuding an extreme sharpness as it aimed straight for Shang Lu!  </p><p>Outside the arena, Palace Master Yin and the others wore grave expressions, their true essence surging as they prepared to intervene at any moment.  </p><p>In a battle between Nascent Soul cultivators, victory or defeat could be decided in an instant.  </p><p>Shang Lu had failed to see through the trap and had been caught off guard by his opponent, losing the initiative. Defeat seemed almost inevitable unless he had some hidden means to turn the tide.  </p><p>With the Frost Soul Divine Light in front and the Golden Sinking Sword behind, Shang Lu was instantly plunged into a perilous situation.  </p><p>However, Shang Lu had not reached his current level of cultivation by being ordinary.  </p><p>Remaining calm in the face of danger, he did not even glance at the Golden Sinking Sword behind him and immediately recalled his jade ruler.  </p><p>The jade ruler, which had been heading toward Liuli, abruptly reversed course, passing over Shang Lu and transforming into a streak of white light as it shot toward the Golden Sinking Sword.  </p><p>*Boom!*  </p><p>The sword and ruler collided.  </p><p>Countless sword energies and white light scattered in all directions, creating a dazzling display of radiance, like a magnificent firework blooming in the night sky.  </p><p>The jade ruler, hastily summoned to battle, was undoubtedly sent flying by the sword strike.  </p><p>However, the momentum of the sword beam was also deflected.  </p><p>The pressure on Shang Lu lessened significantly, and he slapped the storage pouch at his waist. A snow-white scarf, about ten feet long, flew out.  </p><p>As soon as this treasure appeared, it shattered into pieces, scattered by the shockwaves from the collision between the sword and ruler, disappearing without a trace, appearing extremely fragile.  </p><p>Just as everyone was puzzled, a white mist inexplicably rose around Shang Lu, enveloping him.  </p><p>*Crack, crack, crack…*  </p><p>The Frost Soul Divine Light followed closely, freezing the surface of the mist into ice. Shang Lu was now encased in an ice sphere, with the Frost Soul Divine Light continuing to spread inward.  </p><p>…  </p><p>On the other side, Qin Sang darted forward.  </p><p>This was also the first time he had seen Liuli unleash the full power of the Frost Soul Divine Light. No wonder she had been confident in facing Shang Lu.  </p><p>If not for that self-protecting treasure, he and Liuli would have already subdued Shang Lu.  </p><p>Qin Sang's eyes flickered as he recalled the Golden Sinking Sword, then twisted his body and headed straight for the Serpent Banner, choosing not to join Liuli in attacking Shang Lu.  </p><p>Outside the arena, numerous Nascent Soul cultivators were watching intently, ready to intervene at any moment. Even if they won, they could not seriously injure or kill Shang Lu.  </p><p>Shang Lu's defeat was only a matter of time.  </p><p>Since that was the case, it was better to teach him a lesson.  </p><p>Qin Sang had made up his mind. Ignoring Shang Lu, his figure suddenly appeared above the Serpent Banner, and he pointed downward with his finger.  </p><p>*Whoosh!*  </p><p>The Golden Sinking Sword shot downward.  </p><p>The sword energy forced the Serpent Banner to sway precariously.  </p><p>The Serpent Banner's task was to suppress Liuli, but in the blink of an eye, the situation had changed drastically, leaving it no time to adjust. The three snow serpents, still recovering from the impact of the Frost Soul Divine Light, let out fearful hisses.  </p><p>*Crash!*  </p><p>The Serpent Banner was uprooted, roughly rolling up a jade-white light as it charged toward the Golden Sinking Sword.  </p><p>*Boom!*  </p><p>Due to the haste, the three snow serpents were forcibly ejected from the banner, disoriented and enraged, turning back to charge again.  </p><p>However, as soon as they materialized, the snow serpents felt a blur before their eyes, and a figure suddenly appeared in front of them—it was Qin Sang.  </p><p>Their intelligence was not low, and their demonic eyes glowed with ferocity as they let out sharp roars. Their long bodies twisted, and their three tails swung toward Qin Sang with terrifying force.  </p><p>A Nascent Soul cultivator without defensive measures would suffer severe injuries from such a blow.  </p><p>Demonic winds rushed toward Qin Sang.  </p><p>"Audacious beasts!"  </p><p>Qin Sang snorted coldly. With his mind focused on the Buddha Seal and his steps like lotus flowers, his figure moved like a ghost, easily dodging the serpent tails and suddenly appearing right above the snow serpents, within arm's reach!  </p><p>The first four seals of the *Seven Buddha Seals*, including the Demon-Shattering Seal, had been fully comprehended by Qin Sang, reaching the level of "mind-seeing the seal."  </p><p>He lightly extended a palm and pressed it against the forehead of one of the snow serpents.  </p><p>The snow serpent had no time to react.  </p><p>*Splat!*  </p><p>Brain matter splattered, and the skull cracked.  </p><p>Even though Qin Sang's *Heavenly Demon Transformation* was only at the early stage of the fourth layer, his physical body was equivalent to that of an early-stage demon king. With the Demon-Shattering Seal, how could a mere demon core-stage beast resist?  </p><p>The light in the snow serpent's eyes quickly faded, and it died on the spot!  </p><p>The guests, who had been focused on Liuli and Shang Lu, were now drawn to Qin Sang.  </p><p>"Body refinement?"  </p><p>They were shocked and uncertain.  </p><p>The groom's spiritual sword had been blocked by the Serpent Banner and the jade-white light, and he had no other treasures in hand. There was no sign of any spell fluctuations—he had killed the demonic beast with his bare hands!  </p><p>Qin Sang's *Heavenly Demon Refinement* had been neglected, and his physical body was now his least significant means, but it was perfect for diverting attention.  </p><p>The remaining two snow serpents were terrified and turned to flee.  </p><p>Qin Sang reached out and grabbed the tail of one snow serpent, his arm exerting force. Scales flew off, and the serpent's bones cracked as a terrifying force erupted within its body, shattering its internal organs.  </p><p>The last serpent was more alert. It coiled around the Serpent Banner and desperately rushed toward its master.  </p><p>*Whoosh!*  </p><p>The Golden Sinking Sword dispersed the jade-white light and shot westward, piercing through the serpent's head.  </p><p>*Clang!*  </p><p>The Yue family cultivator set down his jade cup and stood up abruptly, his composed expression gone.  </p><p>Qin Sang's movements were too fast—a palm strike, a grab, and a sword thrust. The three snow serpents were killed in an instant. Those outside the arena had no time to react, watching helplessly as the three precious snow serpents were slaughtered.  </p><p>By the time the last snow serpent died, the first corpse had not even begun to fall.  </p><p>Qin Sang grabbed the tails of the three snow serpents, extracted their demon cores, and with a light shake of his arm, tossed the serpent corpses to Shi Xue, laughing heartily, "I've heard that snow serpent meat is tender and a delicacy. Today, all of you will have the fortune to taste it."  </p><p>Shi Xue caught the serpents with a smile.  </p><p>Shang Lu had disregarded the bonds of their sect and caused trouble at the wedding ceremony. Shi Xue no longer cared about preserving the dignity of the Heavenly Mountain Sect and instead felt that Qin Sang had done well, venting her anger. She raised her voice and said, "Thank you, Sect Master Shang, for the generous gift!"  </p><p>At the same time, on the other side, Shang Lu finally managed to break free from the Frost Soul Divine Light.  </p><p>*Bang!*  </p><p>The ice sphere shattered.  </p><p>Shang Lu quickly darted out, his face slightly pale, and he forced a bitter smile. "Junior Sister Liuli is indeed a prodigy, having mastered the Frost Soul Divine Light to such an extent."  </p><p>Having personally experienced the power of the Frost Soul Divine Light, Shang Lu no longer had any doubts.  </p><p>Liuli did not respond, her eyes glowing with an icy blue light as she prepared to strike again.  </p><p>Qin Sang appeared beside Liuli, casually playing with the Serpent Banner in his hand.  </p><p>"There's no need to continue. I admit defeat," Shang Lu said with a resigned tone, knowing that without the Serpent Banner, he would struggle even against Liuli alone, let alone facing both of them.</p>
