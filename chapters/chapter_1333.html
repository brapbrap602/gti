<h1>Chapter 1325: Is It Beautiful?</h1><p>Time flies swiftly.</p><p>Four years later.</p><p>Qin Sang had been stationed in this place for three years on behalf of Qing Jun, adding to his own three years, making a total of six years. During this time, he had hardly left the Abyssal Ruins.</p><p>Throughout this period, he never relaxed his demands on himself.</p><p>After reforging the Golden Sinking Sword, Qin Sang identified his shortcomings and continued to instruct Li Yufu to deliver spiritual materials. His artifact-crafting skills grew increasingly refined.</p><p>At the same time, he began to seriously contemplate the creation of a treasure capable of subduing the Southern Brightness Fire.</p><p>This time, there were no other treasures for him to reference. He had to start from scratch.</p><p>Unable to enter the Purple Palace to observe the Southern Brightness Fire up close, Qin Sang could only prepare based on the information he had previously gathered.</p><p>Bai speculated that within the Southern Brightness Fire, there might be a true feather of the Vermilion Bird, which was why it had not extinguished to this day.</p><p>Qin Sang knew that his knowledge was far inferior to Bai's, so he could only trust his judgment.</p><p>Among the spiritual materials Qin Sang possessed, the most precious was the Green Copper Fragment.</p><p>This item originated from the Purple Palace and was a fragment of a supreme treasure. It still retained a power that even the Southern Brightness Fire feared.</p><p>The future treasure would be constructed with the Green Copper Fragment as its core.</p><p>Next was the shell of the Nine-Life Mystic Turtle.</p><p>This treasure had been refined by a great demon at the Transformation Stage, who had poured countless efforts into it. It was no less powerful than a treasure itself and had repeatedly shielded Qin Sang from attacks, helping him escape dangerous situations.</p><p>Qin Sang planned to combine these two treasures to capture the Vermilion Bird's true feather!</p><p>The profound water energy contained within the Green Copper Fragment and the turtle shell both had the ability to suppress fire.</p><p>By using the Green Copper Fragment to suppress the Vermilion Bird's true feather within the turtle shell, the chances of success were high.</p><p>However, Qin Sang still needed to consider how to suppress or contain the extremely violent Southern Brightness Fire after capturing the Vermilion Bird's true feather.</p><p>The power of the Southern Brightness Fire was unquestionable, surpassing even the Nine Nether Demon Fire.</p><p>Qin Sang turned his gaze to the mysterious white copper.</p><p>At the Void Spirit Sect, Qin Sang had scoured through countless典籍 but found no records of anything similar to the mysterious white copper.</p><p>Reluctantly, Qin Sang sought advice from Bing Han, but even she could not identify what the white copper was.</p><p>After arriving at the Sin Abyss, Qin Sang contacted the Sin Abyss cultivators and inquired whether Ye Lao Mo and others had obtained any典籍 after killing the evil spirits during the Abyssal Ruins battle.</p><p>The result was still nothing, as everything had been taken by Ye Lao Mo.</p><p>Qin Sang could confirm two things.</p><p>First, the mysterious white copper had been carried by the evil spirits, indicating that even in ancient times, it was not an ordinary item.</p><p>Second, the mysterious white copper shone like a blazing flame, comparable to the sun's intensity. It was undoubtedly a top-tier fire-attribute treasure and an excellent choice for containing the Southern Brightness Fire.</p><p>These three treasures, along with the various spiritual materials compensated by the Sin Abyss, were already far more precious than any top-grade treasure in terms of material alone.</p><p>To be cautious, Qin Sang did not rush to act.</p><p>If a conflict were to arise due to negligence, causing the treasures to self-destruct, it would be a regret too great to bear.</p><p>Over the four years.</p><p>Qin Sang exhausted every possible method to analyze the properties of the mysterious white copper.</p><p>The cultivation world was vast and boundless, with countless treasures. Artifact-crafting masters could not possibly know all spiritual materials, so there were naturally methods to analyze the properties of unfamiliar items, which Qin Sang had learned at the Void Spirit Sect.</p><p>Perhaps the mysterious white copper was of too high a grade, as the秘术 applied to it did not yield the expected results. Qin Sang had no choice but to use a笨 method, keeping the mysterious white copper close at hand, almost making it a part of his body.</p><p>It was effective, but he still could not draw a definitive conclusion.</p><p>This time, it was Yu Wang who came to replace him.</p><p>Qin Sang handed the jade pendant to Yu Wang and was about to leave the Abyssal Ruins when he encountered the Judge at the entrance.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Qin," the Judge said with great enthusiasm, handing over a mustard seed bag. "These are the spiritual materials you requested. Please take a look."</p><p>Qin Sang opened it and found that it contained only about sixty to seventy percent of the items on the list. He looked up at the Judge.</p><p>The Judge rubbed his hands together and smiled bitterly. "The Purple Palace is about to open, and I also wish to make some achievements. However, I lost my second main soul during the Battle of Yu City. Over the years, I have been trying to refine it again, but it has not gone smoothly. Recently, I discovered some spiritual materials in a forbidden area that might help me. Could Fellow Daoist Qin return the Death Jade to me first? The remaining few spiritual materials are extremely rare. I hope Fellow Daoist Qin can see my sincerity and grant me some extra time!"</p><p>Under the Judge's expectant gaze, Qin Sang thought for a moment and nodded in agreement.</p><p>The other party was also a Nascent Soul expert and cultivated the eerie path of the undead. There was no need to push him too hard.</p><p>Qin Sang put away the mustard seed bag and readily took out the Death Jade, returning it to the Judge.</p><p>The Judge was overjoyed.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist, have you made any discoveries in your investigation of the Heavenly Corpse Sect?"</p><p>Qin Sang had also instructed his juniors to keep an eye out, but they had found nothing.</p><p>Tan Hao and the mysterious person seemed to have completely vanished, leaving no trace.</p><p>The Judge said, "After parting with you last time, I secretly investigated. As you know, Fellow Daoist Qin, although we cultivators of the undead path are not universally reviled in the cultivation world, our situation is still very difficult. We are seen as more evil than demonic cultivators and can only help each other. I can contact several experts in this path from various regions, but so far, I have not found the person you mentioned, nor have I discovered anyone secretly recruiting undead path cultivators."</p><p>Could it be that Tan Hao has disappeared so thoroughly because something happened to him?</p><p>Qin Sang's brow furrowed slightly.</p><p>...</p><p>At the Yuan Shen Sect.</p><p>Qin Sang entered the spiritual vein to check on the Corpse Flower Blood Amber.</p><p>According to estimates, purifying the Corpse Flower Blood Amber would take at least twenty years, coinciding with the emergence of the Purple Palace. He wondered if he would make it in time.</p><p>Even if it was completed before the Purple Palace emerged, there would likely be no time to refine it.</p><p>Removing the restrictions, the spiritual plant appeared before Qin Sang.</p><p>Compared to over a decade ago, the spiritual plant remained verdant, but the Corpse Flower Blood Amber had changed dramatically!</p><p>Originally a piece of crimson blood amber, the blood color inside had now faded significantly, revealing the true appearance of the spiritual flower. Once the blood color completely disappeared, it would be fully purified.</p><p>After a careful inspection, Qin Sang restored the restrictions and left the forbidden area, unexpectedly encountering Qing Jun.</p><p>"Senior Sister, you've come out of seclusion?"</p><p>Sixteen years had passed.</p><p>As a Nascent Soul cultivator, even though he was accustomed to such separations, seeing her familiar face again, Qin Sang couldn't help but smile slightly.</p><p>Qing Jun nodded gently and said, "There's something I want to show you. Come with me, Junior Brother."</p><p>Qin Sang had guarded the Immortal Sect for her for three years, but Qing Jun did not offer any words of thanks.</p><p>Given their relationship, such formalities were unnecessary.</p><p>The two slowed their pace, leisurely admiring the beautiful scenery of the Yun Cang Great Marsh as they flew towards the Peach Blossom Valley.</p><p>Qin Sang spoke of the gains from his hard training over the past decade, and Qing Jun listened attentively, occasionally offering her own insights.</p><p>Although she was not skilled in artifact crafting, her expertise in the path of puppetry was unparalleled. The principles of the Great Dao were interconnected, and her suggestions provided Qin Sang with significant inspiration.</p><p>Finally, Qing Jun took the mysterious white copper and used her unique秘术 to help Qin Sang analyze it.</p><p>Before long, the two arrived at the Peach Blossom Valley. Qing Jun收起秘术, noticing Qin Sang's appreciative gaze.</p><p>"Is it beautiful?"</p><p>Qing Jun brushed a strand of hair.</p><p>Qin Sang waved his hand to open the Peach Blossom Valley, his gaze falling on the blooming peach blossoms. He deliberately examined them for a moment before shaking his head and sighing, "Though the peach blossoms are beautiful, they pale in comparison at this moment."</p><p>"Exaggerated!"</p><p>Qing Jun lightly scolded, a hint of a smile on her lips, but her eyes remained crystal clear.</p><p>The two flashed and disappeared into the valley.</p>
