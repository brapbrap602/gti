<h1>Chapter 886: Yin Yang Armor</h1><p>“Then this junior wishes Martial Uncle Huayang success. Although this elder brother cultivates the Wood Bending Scripture, we are of the same sect. Seeing the once prominent Yin Yang lineage decline day by day is truly heartbreaking.”</p><p>Senior Brother Lu lamented.</p><p>“If only everyone had such a broad mind as Senior Brother…”</p><p>The Dao Child sighed.</p><p>As they spoke, the avatar finished being questioned, his name already registered in the jade book. He didn't need to participate in the subsequent matters.</p><p>“This jade token represents your identity…”</p><p>Senior Brother Lu tossed the avatar a jade token, then took out a jade slip and beckoned to the Dao Child, “Junior Brother Yang, take a look yourself.  This contains all the places that are short-staffed. You've been in the sect for many years; you should know which positions are easy, right?”</p><p>The Dao Child stepped forward, his divine sense swept over the jade slip, and a contemplative look appeared on his face.</p><p>Meanwhile, the avatar was sighing inwardly.</p><p>Back then, when his original body joined three different sects, one after another, he had never received such treatment.</p><p>A four-spiritual-root disciple, to have the senior members of the sect care so much, could be said to be a tremendous stroke of luck.</p><p>A moment later.</p><p>The Dao Child opened his eyes and frowned slightly, "Senior Brother Lu, are all the positions guarding the White Rainbow Pagoda filled?”</p><p>Senior Brother Lu gently shook his head, “Junior Brother, don't even think about it. There won't be any vacancies in those places! In the jade slip, those few tasks, raising spirit beasts and managing the Green Smoke Lake, are already very leisurely. If Junior Brother Yang hadn't asked, I wouldn't have readily offered them."</p><p>The Dao Child pondered for a moment, then suddenly turned to ask the avatar, “Do you have any special skills?”</p><p>The avatar was taken aback, then after a quick thought, he replied, “This disciple has studied refining tools.”</p><p>From what he had heard them discuss, those tasks seemed rather idle with little interaction with outsiders.</p><p>This didn't align with the avatar's purpose. He needed to interact with more people to gather information.</p><p>Magical tools and pills were necessities for every cultivator.</p><p>“Oh?”</p><p>The Dao Child’s gaze shifted to the spirit sword behind the avatar, “No wonder you, a rogue cultivator with no family inheritance, possess a sword comparable to a top-grade magical tool. It seems your refining skills must be quite good. Then go to Senior Brother Jinyan. I have some connections with Senior Brother Jinyan and can offer you some support.”</p><p>“Has Junior Brother decided then?”</p><p>Senior Brother Lu retrieved the jade slip, glanced at the avatar, and instructed, “You, a mere four-spiritual-root disciple, have caused Junior Brother Yang such trouble.  Shouldn’t you quickly express your gratitude?”</p><p>“This disciple thanks Martial Uncle Yang and Martial Uncle Lu.”</p><p>The avatar obediently bowed.</p><p>The two Foundation Establishment cultivators exchanged smiles. The Dao Child nodded slowly, motioned for him to rise, and said calmly, “I also see that you have good talent in the Yin Yang Dao and might be able to make a name for yourself. I will first impart to you the Yin Yang Armor Condensation Technique, then send you to meet Senior Brother Jinyan.  You should cultivate diligently in the future and don't disgrace our Yin Yang lineage.”</p><p>“This disciple obeys.”</p><p>The avatar rose and followed closely behind the Dao Child into a side room.</p><p>The Dao Child tossed him a jade slip, “Here is the Yin Yang Armor Condensation Technique. Read it yourself first. If you have any questions, you can ask me. In the future, I won't have time to personally guide you!”</p><p>The avatar was surprised and hurriedly accepted the jade slip.</p><p>Seeing that the Dao Child had begun to meditate with his eyes closed, he remained silent, placed the jade slip on his forehead, and began to examine it.  He discovered it contained a spell called the Yin Yang Armor.</p><p>The spell wasn’t long, and the avatar quickly browsed through it.</p><p>"No wonder they offered it so readily. It turns out to be just a part of the secret technique..."</p><p>The avatar grumbled inwardly but immediately dismissed these distracting thoughts and carefully examined the spell.</p><p>He found that while the spell appeared simple on the surface, something a Qi Refining stage disciple could quickly learn, the true meaning it contained required even someone with his experience to carefully ponder.</p><p>The content of the spell was simple: to condense yin and yang energies into a suit of armor.</p><p>The armor wasn't like a magical tool, but rather could be donned instantly with a thought, providing a certain degree of defense, which was highly useful in combat.</p><p>The jade slip covered the process from initiation to the formation of the armor, then abruptly ended.  He would likely receive the next part only after successfully condensing the Yin Yang Armor.</p><p>“This secret technique has an extraordinary origin!”</p><p>The avatar was secretly astonished.</p><p>“The Lantern Fight Sect's true inheritance indeed has something special. This Yin Yang Armor Condensation spell likely originates from the Yin Yang Heaven Fighting Secret Art. Its application of yin and yang energies is truly exquisite. I wonder what the complete technique is like?”</p><p>In less than the time it takes to burn an incense stick, the avatar had memorized the spell and felt ready to begin practicing.</p><p>His talent was fake, but relying on years of experience, he could find alternative methods to condense a set of Yin Yang Armor. However, it would be impossible for his original body to cultivate this technique.</p><p>Such orthodox techniques of the profound sects each had extremely high requirements for aptitude, and the avatar knew his original body didn't possess such talent.</p><p>Even if he couldn't cultivate it, obtaining it for study would still be beneficial.</p><p>Furthermore, the effects of the Yin Yang Armor sparked the avatar's curiosity, and he wanted to condense it quickly to test it out. This armor didn't seem to be purely for defense; it likely had other uses.</p><p>Despite this thought, the avatar restrained himself.  Only after a full hour did he let out a long breath and remove the jade slip from his forehead.</p><p>The Dao Child opened his eyes and asked the avatar, “Do you have any questions?”</p><p>The avatar shook his head, then nodded, “This disciple’s mind is a jumble, seemingly grasping something, yet also full of doubts.”</p><p>“That’s normal. You’re just beginning to learn the techniques of the Yin Yang Dao. How could you comprehend it so quickly? However, with your talent in this Dao, you should be able to condense a rudimentary form of the Yin Yang Armor soon enough. I will first explain this technique to you. This opportunity comes only once. Whether you understand or not, memorize it all, and slowly comprehend it later…”</p><p>The Dao Child’s expression turned slightly serious as he gave this reminder, then softened his voice.</p><p>The avatar listened attentively, not underestimating this cultivator whose cultivation was far below his original body.</p><p>This person cultivated the orthodox Yin Yang Heaven Fighting Secret Art and certainly possessed insights that surpassed his own.</p><p>Perhaps to prevent the avatar from bothering him in the future, the Dao Child’s explanation expanded beyond the contents of the jade slip.</p><p>The avatar indeed heard some things he hadn't considered before, remarkably insightful.</p><p>But as he listened to the end, a suspicion arose in the avatar's heart.</p><p>Although the final part of the Dao Child’s explanation was only a few sentences, the avatar noticed it seemed quite different from the earlier parts.</p><p>The latter part was also quite profound, making even someone like him, who hadn’t cultivated it, listen with great interest. But compared to the earlier part, it paled in comparison.</p><p>“Is this kid’s cultivation lacking, or could it be…”</p><p>The avatar’s heart skipped a beat.  “Could this technique also be a fragmented piece, patched up by later generations?”</p><p>The cultivation world didn't lack complete techniques. Mount Shaohua alone housed multiple techniques leading all the way to the Nascent Soul stage, but regardless of their divine abilities or true meanings, they were all quite mediocre.</p><p>Techniques with extraordinary origins, like the Primordial Spirit Sword Nurturing Chapter, the Celestial Demon Body Refining Technique, and the Witch Clan’s Divine Rune Dao, were all incomplete.</p><p>This Yin Yang Heaven Fighting Secret Art seemed similar.</p>
