<h1>Chapter 862: The Heaven-Freezing Gale Array</h1><p>Chapter 862: The Heaven-Freezing Gale Array</p><p>In the distance.</p><p>Qin Sang and the others stood poised on the sea's surface, their expressions grave as they watched the small island.  They saw the shadow of the Kui dragon, felt the pressure of the great demon, and remained vigilant.</p><p>Splashes erupted on the sea's surface as a black light shot towards them, landing in Chu Heng's palm.  Everyone's hearts tightened, and they all looked over.</p><p>Chu Heng nodded slightly. "This demon is indeed the Kui dragon.  Attack!"</p><p>Before his words had even finished, everyone, holding the crystal steles, used their movement techniques to approach the island.</p><p>During their flight, the young man surnamed Fang had already engaged the Kui dragon.</p><p>The wind howled, the rain lashed down!</p><p>Mid-air, a golden light intertwined with the Kui dragon.  As the dragon breathed, silver light flickered, and even the lightning from the heavens seemed to be manipulated by the Kui dragon, striking at the golden light.</p><p>The battle between the man and the demon was fierce, with neither side clearly dominant.</p><p>Qin Sang and the others held their breath, quietly landing on the island and choosing a clear space.</p><p>Not far above them, the young man surnamed Fang and the Kui dragon battled furiously, wielding a golden chain to lash the dragon and distract it.</p><p>The young man was incredibly strong.</p><p>Though the golden chain couldn't break through the dragon's scales initially, it inflicted considerable pain.</p><p>The Kui dragon's ferocity was roused, spewing thunder and repeatedly knocking the golden chain away. Despite its massive size, it moved with incredible agility, twisting and turning in the air.  Its long tail, crackling with electricity, resembled a giant silver sword, forcing the young man to retreat repeatedly.</p><p>"Incredible!"</p><p>The onlookers stared in amazement at the Kui dragon's power.</p><p>This great demon's bloodline power was undoubtedly extremely strong, far surpassing ordinary beasts. Without the Heaven-Freezing Gale Array, they probably wouldn't be able to subdue it.</p><p>"Set up the array quickly!"</p><p>Chu Heng shouted.</p><p>At that moment, the young man surnamed Fang was retreating towards their position—not because he couldn't hold his own, but deliberately, to lure the dragon closer.</p><p>Everyone moved quickly, setting up the array before the Kui dragon arrived.</p><p>'Swish swish swish...'</p><p>The crystal steles landed, sinking instantly into the ground and disappearing from sight.</p><p>They stood hundreds of meters apart, forming a large circle around a central area. After the steles disappeared underground, a chilling aura spread beneath the surface. The roots of the plants in the central area turned bluish-green, although nothing was outwardly visible from above.</p><p>The cold air accumulated deep underground, hidden and unreleased.</p><p>Qin Sang and the others concealed themselves, waiting for the opportune moment.</p><p>"It's coming!"</p><p>Qin Sang watched the rapidly approaching figures, finally seeing the Kui dragon's true form.  This beast differed from the legendary Kui dragon; it resembled a long, one-legged Jiao (dragon).</p><p>Its scales were like fish scales, and its head was similar to a turtle's.</p><p>The demon's bloodline was a chaotic mix—a bizarre combination. However, its ability to control thunder was extraordinary, stemming directly from its Kui dragon heritage.</p><p>The Kui dragon roared repeatedly, sending bolts of lightning after the young man, as if it controlled the very thunder in the sky. The thunderballs it spat from its mouth were devastating, flattening a mountain peak with a single blow.</p><p>The two figures chased each other until they reached the array.</p><p>The young man flew past, suddenly accelerating and gaining altitude.  The Kui dragon pursued relentlessly, unaware that it was falling into a trap, and plunged directly into the array.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The ground exploded, debris flying everywhere in the wind and rain.</p><p>Then, a series of 'bang bang bang' sounds echoed as five crystal steles rose from the ground, radiating a blue light. A torrent of cold air erupted from the earth, spreading outwards, creating a cage of ice from thin air.</p><p>The cage was square, perfectly trapping the Kui dragon within.</p><p>The internal wind was bitterly cold, like chains lashing at the beast.</p><p>The crystal steles stood firm, constantly releasing cold air into the cage. Qin Sang and the others had already emerged, each sitting atop a stele, pouring their energy into activating the array.</p><p>Seeing this, the young man halted his flight, turning back, his face alight with joy. He watched the Kui dragon trapped within the icy cage and laughed aloud.</p><p>The Kui dragon, possessing considerable intelligence, immediately understood its predicament and let out a shrill scream.</p><p>The sound was ear-piercing. Qin Sang and the others frowned; the dark clouds in the sky seemed to scatter and churn restlessly.</p><p>The Kui dragon in the cage was practically frenzied.</p><p>It seemed to be clad in a thunder armor, each scale shining silver and emitting tiny sparks of electricity. The cold wind was shattered by the power of the thunder, unable to subdue the beast.</p><p>For a time, the cage was thrown into chaos.</p><p>The cold air and lightning clashed relentlessly, accompanied by the Kui dragon's roars and deafening thunder.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A ball of lightning slammed into the cage.</p><p>The cage shook violently. Qin Sang and the others paled, their hearts pounding in shock.  They didn't dare to slacken, pouring all their energy into the crystal stele to strengthen the cage.</p><p>But before the cage could stabilize, the Kui dragon's tail lashed out, even more powerful than its lightning attack, nearly tearing a hole in the cage.</p><p>The cage was newly formed and at its most vulnerable. Under the Kui dragon's frenzied assault, it began to disintegrate.  Maintaining the cage itself was becoming a struggle, let alone using the spirit formation's other abilities.</p><p>Noticing the cage weakening, the Kui dragon, sensing freedom, attacked even more ferociously.</p><p>Its roars held a strange rhythm, drawing down the power of the heavens.  Dark clouds churned, and lightning bolts gathered from all directions, swirling above them.</p><p>Seeing this, the young man surnamed Fang’s face fell.  He shouted, “Increase your energy output! We mustn't let the beast escape!”</p><p>As he yelled, he quickly summoned his golden rope, flinging it into the air. The rope shot upwards, striking at the gathering storm clouds, dispersing the lightning.</p><p>Everyone knew this was the most critical moment.  Ignoring everything else, they poured all their energy into the stele.</p><p>The stele shone brilliantly.</p><p>A wave of intense cold erupted, freezing the surrounding area. The effect extended outwards; the trees were instantly encased in frost, killed by the sudden cold.</p><p>Qin Sang frowned. He noticed his energy was depleting faster than expected; the Kui dragon was stronger than he’d anticipated.  Trapping the beast wasn't the end; they had to hold out until Fang could kill it.</p><p>If his energy reserves ran dry, even a minor mishap could be fatal. He glanced at the others; their expressions were grim, but they were driven by the situation.</p><p>Qin Sang silently unsealed a Corpse Pill, switching to using its energy. He wouldn't let himself reach a critical point; if the situation became untenable, he would withdraw immediately.</p><p>The island was in ruins.</p><p>On the battlefield, a colossal pillar of freezing air, hundreds of meters in diameter, shot into the sky, spinning like a whirlwind.  At its center, a long, slender figure was clearly visible—the Kui dragon, its body crackling with electricity, relentlessly pounding against the icy cage.</p><p>The violent shaking and the sheer power of the clash sent chills down everyone's spines, highlighting the intensity of the battle.</p>
