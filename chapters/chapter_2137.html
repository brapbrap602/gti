<h1>Chapter 2127: The Wax Figure</h1><p>Sacred Lake.</p><p>Min Zhuo dismissed everyone, ordering the elders to guard the entrance. He only took Min Shu into the sacred hall.</p><p>“Father…”</p><p>Min Shu began to speak, but Min Zhuo stopped him with a wave of his hand.</p><p>Min Zhuo sat cross-legged before the altar, took out a jade bottle, and swallowed the pills inside. As the medicine took effect, his breathing gradually steadied, and he seemed slightly better.</p><p>But the worry in Min Shu's eyes didn't lessen. His father's injuries were too severe; these pills could only temporarily delay the worsening of his condition, not bring about a quick recovery.</p><p>The foreign tribes were held back by the Lu King's army and were not a major concern, but the polluted lands still held various threats, including ferocious beasts.</p><p>The source of the Azure Spirit Qi was mysterious and perilous.  One wouldn't dare approach it without reaching the second stage of the Void Realm.  In his father's current state, forcing his way there would be extremely dangerous.</p><p>After refining the medicine's power and resting for a moment, Min Zhuo gestured, and a jade box flew out from under the altar.</p><p>Min Shu looked over curiously. His father had raised him to be the next clan leader, never hiding the clan's treasures from him, yet this jade box was something he’d never seen before.</p><p>*Click!*</p><p>The jade box opened.</p><p>Surprise flashed in Min Shu's eyes.  The box was filled with white wax!</p><p>It seemed like the most ordinary white wax; Min Shu sensed no unusual energy fluctuations.</p><p>Min Zhuo's lips moved, muttering incantations as he continuously cast several hand seals towards several stone pillars in the hall. Blue light flickered on the surface of the pillars, revealing densely packed runes that formed a formation.</p><p>The jade box hovered in the center of the array.</p><p>Then, all the stone pillars vibrated, simultaneously shooting out beams of blue light, all converging into the jade box.  Immediately, a pale blue flame ignited within the box.</p><p>The flame burned on the surface of the wax, seemingly burning away a layer of seal. The wax began to melt. Min Zhuo cast another hand seal, and the wax, like oil, flowed out.</p><p>*Drip!*</p><p>*Drip!*</p><p>…</p><p>The melted wax fell to the ground, piling up to a man's height. Then, as if alive, it began to writhe, gradually growing limbs and a head, forming a vaguely human shape – a 'wax figure'.</p><p>White wax continuously flowed from the wax figure's body. It had no features, no feet, and was surrounded by a pool of wax, leaving a distinct trail on the ground as it moved.</p><p>The wax figure slowly 'walked' towards Min Zhuo.  Its movements were very slow. Min Zhuo stood up, and when the figure reached him, he suddenly stepped forward.</p><p>The two figures overlapped.</p><p>The next moment, Min Zhuo passed right through the wax figure.  The instant he left the figure's body, his complexion visibly reddened, his breathing rapidly strengthened, and his weakness vanished, as if his injuries were instantly healed.</p><p>Min Shu widened his eyes in disbelief, quickly looking at the wax figure. He saw that features had appeared on the figure's face, identical to his father's.  Moreover, the wax figure’s complexion mirrored his father's previous appearance – incredibly weak.</p><p>The scene was as if Min Zhuo had taken the wax figure's life force, transferring his injuries to it, while he was completely restored.</p><p>Min Zhuo lowered his head, looked at his hands, then inwardly examined himself, and secretly breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p>The ancestors of the Chang You clan had once been powerful.  After countless years, some of their heritage remained, such as this box of wax.</p><p>In the vast world, besides the major races, countless peculiar species existed. Throughout endless ages, wars were constant. Some were enslaved, some hid in corners, struggling to survive in obscurity, while many more had become extinct.</p><p>Legend spoke of a creature called a wax figure, but Min Zhuo wasn't certain if this wax was made from one.</p><p>Clan records didn't document the origin of the jade box, only the wax's function:  A critically injured person could awaken the wax figure to bear their injuries, allowing them to recover their peak strength.  This didn't heal the injuries; it merely temporarily transferred them to the wax figure.</p><p>In this process, the wax figure continuously burned. Once it burned out, the injuries would immediately erupt on the original person, doubled in severity.</p><p>Once the wax figure burned out, it would completely vanish from the world.  Clan tradition dictated that it could only be used when the Chang You clan faced life-or-death situations.</p><p>Today, the Chang You clan only had this one jade box left.</p><p>The wax figure stood still, its eyes closed, flames burning on its body, emitting a pleasant aroma.</p><p>Min Zhuo turned to Min Shu, handing him a token. “Stay in the hall, activate this formation, and guard the wax figure.  Don't let anyone enter the ancestral hall!”</p><p>“This child obeys!”</p><p>Min Shu bowed, his face filled with excitement and reverence.</p><p>The Grand Minister emerged from the royal palanquin, instinctively gazing eastward for a long time. He then flew to a mountaintop, lightly alighting.</p><p>Moments later, a figure appeared – the Imperial Tutor.</p><p>"What is it that you require of me, Grand Minister?"</p><p>The Imperial Tutor asked, feigning ignorance.</p><p>The Grand Minister bowed, saying, "I wish to consult you, my lord.  Besides the Xuandi Huangjuan scroll, can the Wu Ding Ba Ji Diagram manifest other divine abilities?"</p><p>The Imperial Tutor uttered a noncommittal 'Oh.' "You plan to continue the assault?"</p><p>"Precisely!"</p><p>The Grand Minister explained, "Qin Zhenren's true cultivation has been revealed.  The importance of the Great Compassion Temple is undeniable; a crucial altar must be located there. The King has ordered its swift capture and the altar's destruction!"</p><p>"That's logical! But Qin Zhenren has truly surprised us. Li Yue is likely inadequate.  However, if you, Grand Minister, were to intervene personally, success would be assured, wouldn't it?" The Imperial Tutor probed cautiously.</p><p>The Grand Minister neither confirmed nor denied this, humbly replying, "I dare not presume.  The enemy might still be concealing their strength. I can only do my best."</p><p>"Are you referring to Xia Changshi? I know that old fellow relatively well. He's not one to swallow his pride; if still alive, he would have already attacked alongside Qin Zhenren!"</p><p>The Imperial Tutor shook his head slightly.  Like the Grand Minister, Qin Sang's revealed power reinforced their earlier judgment. However, the Imperial Tutor was unaware of the effort and hidden maneuvers the Grand Minister had employed to eliminate Xia Changshi years ago, so he remained hesitant to make a definitive statement.</p><p>"Though I am the master of the Wu Ding Ba Ji Diagram, I've entrusted its complete control to Lu Gan. The Xuandi Huangjuan techniques are currently its most profound ability. Even with Qin Zhenren's sharp insight, it's impossible to devise a countermeasure so quickly after its first deployment. There's no need for concern," the Imperial Tutor reassured him.</p><p>The Grand Minister grasped the key point, "Now?  Do you mean the Diagram can be further enhanced?"</p><p>"Once you capture Qin Zhenren, eliminate the foreign cultivators, and ideally kill several Nascent Soul realm masters, the Diagram's power may increase," the Imperial Tutor replied ambiguously, though the underlying tone was chillingly ruthless.</p><p>Upon hearing this, the Grand Minister's eyes flashed. "Are you using the lifeblood of both sides to nourish the Diagram?"</p><p>"No!"</p><p>The Imperial Tutor vehemently denied it, saying gravely, "I am wholeheartedly assisting the King Lu in overcoming his powerful foes!"</p><p>The Grand Minister remained silent.  The Imperial Tutor and the Wu Ding Ba Ji Diagram were summoned by King Lu personally; he couldn't blame him.</p><p>A classic case of two fighting, allowing a third to profit.  As long as they won, and the Imperial Tutor and the royal family gained some advantage, it was acceptable.</p><p>Turning towards the battlefield, the Imperial Tutor knew the Grand Minister was uneasy.  He said, "Lu Gan can now independently wield the Wu Ding Ba Ji Diagram with perfect mastery; I no longer need to supervise. In this battle, I shall personally assist you, Grand Minister!"</p><p>"Then I thank you greatly, my lord!"</p><p>The Grand Minister performed a formal bow.</p><p>The Imperial Tutor's guess was correct; he was indeed uneasy.</p><p>While confident in his ability to evade Qin Sang and Xia Changshi even in a combined assault, it was undeniable that, aside from their clan's unique abilities, everyone relied on the Wu Ding Ba Ji Diagram for protection.</p><p>Previously, there was no reason for the Imperial Tutor to betray them. But Qin Sang's formidable display, coupled with the lack of proof of Xia Changshi's demise, was enough to sway the Imperial Tutor and the royal family.</p><p>Forcing the Imperial Tutor out, keeping him under King Lu's watch, and leaving Lu Gan to control the Diagram independently—that was his goal. His personal intervention was meant to demonstrate who the true master was, and whose side was the correct one to choose!</p><p>After conferring with the Grand Minister, the Imperial Tutor didn’t return underground, but flew directly towards King Lu's palanquin.</p><p>Watching the Imperial Tutor enter, the Grand Minister withdrew his gaze, turning toward the west.</p><p>The battle’s progression had exceeded his expectations. He finally understood why that person had been so cautious toward the foreign cultivators. Even disregarding the attitude of the Zhu Yan tribe, these foreigners were not easy to deal with.</p><p>It was a pity that person refused to reveal their identity; otherwise, victory would be certain.</p><p>However, risk and reward were inseparable; they certainly would not retreat.</p><p>After much deliberation, the Grand Minister issued several consecutive orders.</p><p>Upon receiving these edicts, the assembled experts' hearts turned cold. They hastened to cultivate and recover, awaiting the upcoming decisive battle.</p><p>Qingyang Temple.</p><p>A thunder altar hung in the air, with a green luan bird perched on top – Qin Sang's Dharma form.</p><p>The Dharma form sat with closed eyes, appearing asleep.  His true body and Dharma body, far away in the Great Compassion Temple, also sat in the meditation hall, calmly contemplating.</p><p>An image continuously flashed through his mind: from the moment the Xuanhuang light was shattered, the Wu Ding Ba Ji Diagram manifesting eight clear pools, to the scroll's appearance, and finally, Min Zhuo's rescue.</p><p>It all happened almost instantaneously, yet Qin Sang dissected it into individual scenes.</p><p>He remembered every detail vividly; every image, every subtle anomaly, meticulously examined countless times.  As Qin Sang recalled, he also analyzed, his hands resting on his knees, fingertips occasionally twitching, emitting subtle energy fluctuations.</p><p>Gradually, the images in his memory shifted. The once-desolate landscape, transformed into verdant mountains and rivers, blurred into an indistinct painting in his eyes.  As the Master had said, a single observation wasn't enough to deduce much.  However, Qin Sang didn't need a detailed analysis; knowing the approximate rank and power of the artifact was sufficient.</p><p>He was undisturbed.</p><p>After the last battle, a long period of peace ensued. The enemy lines were unusually quiet, showing no signs of attack.  But everyone knew the truce was temporary. Cultivators stationed in the West and the masters of various temples were using this precious time to recuperate.</p><p>Then, the protective formation of Qingyang Temple was activated—Shi Xue had arrived again.</p><p>"The foul energy is receding, but my junior sister is still missing. What should we do now?"</p><p>Shi Xue was anxious.</p><p>Earlier, Qin Sang had told her to wait, but they hadn't heard from Liuli, who must have encountered some trouble.</p><p>As for the Azure Spirit Qi, Shi Xue dared not hope for it anymore.</p><p>She learned about the current situation from Su Nu and Tong Lingyu, understanding that this was the most critical moment for the Storm Realm.  Qin Sang and Su Nu both believed that Lu Wang's forces had been demoralized, and a fierce battle was imminent. At least one of the top experts, the Master or the Grand Deacon, would intervene—most likely the Grand Deacon.</p><p>With the foul energy receding, they couldn't split their forces and wouldn't be able to contend with the Changyou Clan this time. But if they won this battle, the Azure Spirit Qi would forever belong to the Storm Realm; temporary losses wouldn't matter.</p><p>"I understand. Go tell Palace Master Tong to send some experts from Xuantian Palace to the Foul Lands," Qin Sang said.</p><p>"Alas!  That many people won't be a match for the Changyou Clan."</p><p>Shi Xue sighed, resigned to fate, knowing that any gain would be a blessing.</p><p>As for Liuli's whereabouts, she trusted Qin Sang cared, but the timing was inopportune.  She could only hope Liuli was lucky.</p><p>After sending Shi Xue away, Qin Sang frowned, suppressing the urge to question the Minzhuo Clan leader, pondering the various unexpected changes.</p><p>He had previously deduced that the source of the Azure Spirit Qi might hold an unknown secret, attracting the Changyou Clan and influencing the Minzhuo Clan leader's seemingly irrational decisions.</p><p>Was the receding foul energy and the Minzhuo Clan leader's injury a mere coincidence?</p><p>Logically, facing the powerful Lu Wang army, even if Qin Sang had suspicions, he wouldn't have time for them now.</p><p>But the Minzhuo Clan leader could never have imagined that the power of the Thunder Altar couldn't be measured by ordinary standards.</p><p>Qin Sang had complete confidence in the power of the Thunder Altar and the fourth-order Thunder Talisman, the Thunder Oath Seal.  Years ago, he had wanted to use the Thunder Altar to negotiate with the Zhuyan Clan to secure a foothold for the Storm Realm, let alone against just one of the four great clans of the Siyou Clan.</p><p>A full-scale attack would only yield two results:</p><p>Either the Grand Deacon and others would be annihilated by thunder, and the Lu Wang army would be routed.</p><p>Or the Grand Deacon and others would survive by a hair's breadth, and Lu Wang would withdraw his troops.</p><p>Unless they summoned a Saint-level expert, they wouldn't dare to attack the Storm Realm again.</p><p>Qin Sang's careful planning aimed for the first outcome, which was also part of his path to enlightenment.  As for the Storm Realm's safety, he had ceased to worry the moment the Thunder Altar was completed.</p><p>So, did he truly dare not be distracted?</p><p>Not necessarily!</p><p>Provided that the secret of the Azure Spirit Qi's source was worth the risk of failure.</p><p>After all, in his opinion, the upcoming battle, if the Grand Deacon appeared, would be one of the best opportunities to act.  Dividing forces now could lead to failure and a missed chance.</p><p>Great Compassion Temple.</p><p>After weighing the pros and cons and pondering for a long time, Qin Sang, with his physical body and Dharma body, left the temple and returned quietly to Qingyang Temple.</p><p>On the Thunder Altar.</p><p>The Qingluan Dharma Image slowly rose, nodded to the main body, then spread its wings and soared into the sky, transforming into a beam of azure light that disappeared into the heavens.</p><p>—</p><p>—</p><p>Happy Qixi Festival, everyone!</p>
