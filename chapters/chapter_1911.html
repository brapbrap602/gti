Chapter 1902: Cloud Metropolis Mountain


Qin Sang flew through the air, neither too fast nor too slow, clouds forming beneath his feet.
For a cultivator a hair's breadth from Nascent Soul, the so-called enlightenment bestowed by Abbot Yu was but a trifling matter.
The mountains and rivers below stretched out before him, a panorama in miniature.
Mortals, like ants, lived and toiled. Compared to a hundred years ago, nothing much had changed.
Recalling Abbot Yu's description of the surrounding geography, Qin Sang looked eastward. He sought a master alchemist.
One capable of refining the Radiant Flower Pill, and guaranteeing a reasonable success rate, would need to be at least at the Deity Transformation stage.
To find such a lofty cultivator, he must travel east. Legend held that in the east lay the immortal Cloud Metropolis Mountain, the source of the world's spiritual veins, a gathering place for immortals.
Abbot Yu had also warned him that westward, where human settlements thinned, lay treacherous mountain ranges. Within them resided numerous immortal mountains and spiritual rivers, but also a profusion of demons, evil cultivators, and rampant killing. The situation there was extremely chaotic.
Limited by his Golden Core cultivation, Abbot Yu's perspective was narrow. However, through his words, Qin Sang could glean a general understanding of the surrounding environment.
To truly understand this cultivation world and its place within the greater universe, he first needed to reach Cloud Metropolis Mountain. Thus, Qin Sang followed the Lihu shore, flying directly eastward.
Before long, Qin Sang spotted the eastern shore of Lihu.  It was not the end, but merely part of a vast water system.
From the eastern shore flowed a great river, continuing eastward.  The records in the Smokewater Temple's library indicated that following this river would lead him to Cloud Metropolis Mountain.
Qin Sang didn't particularly hasten his flight or conceal his presence, simply riding a white cloud across the sky.
"Demonic spirits, earth gods, city deities, immortal cultivators…"
Without deliberately extending his divine sense, Qin Sang could perceive the various extraordinary auras along the way.
He saw a mortal hunting in the mountains, behaving disrespectfully, only to be swallowed whole by an enraged mountain demon.
He saw a ferocious demon attempting to raid a village for blood sacrifice, only to be slain by the City God summoned by the local Earth God.
He also witnessed a cultivator wielding a sword, slaying demons and eliminating evils, rescuing an oppressed Mountain God.
He even saw a wolf demon, radiating pure spiritual energy, sharing poetry and conversation with two cultivators and a Mountain God.
There were newly awakened lesser demons cautiously exploring the world; deities residing in temples, protecting mortals; and cultivators focused solely on their cultivation, indifferent to worldly affairs.
Qin Sang couldn't help but sigh, "What a grand world!"
Overall, this world was far more peaceful compared to other cultivation realms.
However, one point couldn't be ignored: the spiritual energy here was certainly no match for that of Cloud Metropolis Mountain.
Would Cloud Metropolis Mountain also be so harmonious?
The white cloud drifted leisurely.
Flying over countless rivers and lakes, Qin Sang's expression shifted slightly. He dispersed the cloud beneath him and gracefully descended toward a mountain peak below.
This mountain was far from the hustle and bustle of civilization, rarely visited.  Nestled within it was a market, known as the Hongshan Market.
The Hongshan Market was backed by an Immortal Sect, opening for half a month every six months.
This sect boasted a Nascent Soul cultivator as its leader, known for their fairness and impartiality. Consequently, the Hongshan Market was widely known in the surrounding area, attracting even deities and demon cultivators for trade.  As long as a demon didn't prey on humans, they wouldn't face any discrimination within the market.
Abbot Yu was a regular visitor to the Hongshan Market, gleaning much of his outside knowledge from there.
Before Qin Sang's departure, Abbot Yu had gifted him a calling card to facilitate his dealings within the market.
It just so happened to be during the market's opening period.
Qin Sang landed on a rock outside the market, choosing not to present Abbot Yu's card. Instead, he directly released an aura equivalent to that of a Nascent Soul cultivator.
Shortly after, there was a response from within the market. A rainbow streak of light shot out, paused briefly, and then swiftly approached, revealing an elderly man. It was the master of the Hongshan Market, known as Elder Luyang.
Seeing an unfamiliar face with a cultivation level no less than his own, Elder Luyang spoke and acted with caution.
Seemingly oblivious, Qin Sang fabricated a story, stating his purpose: "This humble Daoist has long heard that Cloud Metropolis Mountain is a sacred land for immortals, home to countless high cultivators.  I wish to travel there to seek a spiritual pill, but I'm unfamiliar with the customs and worried about committing a faux pas. Passing by your esteemed establishment, I've taken the liberty of asking for your guidance."
Hearing this, Elder Luyang's expression softened slightly. He pondered for a moment, then said, "May I ask what grade of pill Fellow Daoist Qingfeng seeks? I happen to be acquainted with several alchemy masters and could offer an introduction."
Qin Sang replied frankly, "Thank you, Fellow Daoist! However, this pill is rare and likely requires a Deity Transformation alchemy grandmaster to personally refine it."
"Hiss!"
A flicker of surprise crossed Elder Luyang's eyes. He shook his head with a wry smile. "So it is. No wonder Fellow Daoist has traveled so far.  To refine such a pill, you can only try your luck in Cloud Cauldron City."
"Cloud Cauldron City?"
Qin Sang inquired, "Is it within Cloud Metropolis Mountain?"
"Indeed!"
Elder Luyang nodded.  "The immortal cities within Cloud Metropolis Mountain often have the character 'Cloud' in their names. Among them, Cloud Cauldron City enjoys great renown, known throughout the mountain as a sacred ground for alchemy.  The City Lord is a Deity Transformation senior, a master of alchemy.  Many alchemists flock to the city, seeking his protection and enjoying high status.  It's said that even the Cloud Metropolis Heaven treats the City Lord with respect. However, securing his services is no easy feat…"
As he explained, Elder Luyang retrieved a jade slip containing a map encompassing part of Cloud Metropolis Mountain, marking the locations of certain immortal cities and sects.
Qin Sang expressed his gratitude and used his divine sense to examine the map.
The 'Cloud Metropolis Heaven' referred to a major Immortal Sect within Cloud Metropolis Mountain, bearing the same name as the mountain itself.
Now, no one could say for sure whether the mountain was named after the sect, or vice versa.
To distinguish them, and as a sign of respect, the cultivators of Cloud Metropolis Mountain honored the sect with the title 'Heaven,' calling it the Cloud Metropolis Heaven.
The Cloud Metropolis Heaven deserved this honorific.  Not only was it the largest sect within Cloud Metropolis Mountain, but its main peak pierced the clouds, its summit unseen by mortals, as if residing in the heavens.
Qin Sang studied the map carefully, his mind racing.
"A Deity Transformation cultivator can occupy an immortal city, protect other alchemists, and earn the respect of the Cloud Metropolis Heaven.  This suggests exceptional alchemy skills.  But it also implies that within Cloud Metropolis Mountain, Deity Transformation cultivators are considered powerful. Could it be that the Cloud Metropolis Heaven is merely a sect led by Void Refinement cultivators?"
It was impossible for every corner of the greater universe to be teeming with Body Integration and Grand Tribulation cultivators.  Perhaps this cultivation world he had landed in was relatively remote.
"Thank you, Fellow Daoist."
Qin Sang insisted on paying for the information.
This map was undoubtedly a treasured possession of Elder Luyang's sect.  In the unpredictable world of cultivation, even creating a map carried risks.
Bidding farewell to Elder Luyang, Qin Sang soared into the sky.
Elder Luyang watched the departing streak of light, detecting nothing unusual, dismissing it as a minor interlude.
Having obtained the map and observed the local scenery, Qin Sang increased his speed, heading straight for Cloud Cauldron City.
He flew over thousands of mountains and rivers.
The terrain grew noticeably more rugged, the rivers more turbulent, unsuitable for mortal habitation.
Human settlements became increasingly sparse, making it difficult for kingdoms to form.
Correspondingly, the spiritual energy gradually intensified, and the number of cultivators and immortal sects increased.
He flew over countless towering peaks and deep valleys.
"It truly deserves the name Cloud Metropolis Mountain," Qin Sang mused.
Even before reaching the heartland, the mountains were shrouded in white mist, their peaks perpetually capped with clouds that merged with the mist below, as if the entire range was submerged in a sea of clouds.  No wonder it was regarded as a fairyland.
Among the clouds and mist, the mountain shadows appeared hazy and ethereal.
Within Cloud Metropolis Mountain, the central peak in the heartland was occupied by the Cloud Metropolis Heaven.  Other sects and immortal cities occupied their respective spiritual peaks, arranged around the Cloud Metropolis Heaven.
The vastness of Cloud Metropolis Mountain far exceeded ordinary imagination.
Part of Qin Sang's amazement stemmed from this. He estimated that his journey from the Hongshan Market had already covered a distance equivalent to traversing the Central Continent of the Storm Realm.  He hadn't even reached the so-called heartland of Cloud Metropolis Mountain, and he still didn't know how vast it truly was.
The cultivators both within and outside the mountain range were all under the influence of the Cloud Metropolis Heaven. Such a vast expanse controlled by a single sect.
The greater universe truly lived up to its name!
Cloud Cauldron City was also located within the heartland, but at its edge, northwest of the Cloud Metropolis Heaven.
Continuing to fly for a while, the mist didn't thicken but instead seemed to gather upwards, forming a vast cloud canopy that blotted out the sky.
From all directions, mist continuously converged.  Qin Sang shifted his gaze and noticed cloud paths formed by formations within the canopy. He ascended and began walking along a cloud path.
Above the cloud canopy, the sky was a pristine blue, as if he were walking in the heavens.
These cloud paths connected in all directions, converging towards the center.  Soon, Qin Sang encountered other travelers.
Just as Elder Luyang had said, Cloud Cauldron City was renowned, attracting numerous cultivators seeking pills. Before long, the cloud path became bustling with activity.
When he finally saw the full view of Cloud Cauldron City, Qin Sang couldn't help but express his wonder.
The city was shaped like a gigantic cloud cauldron!
The colossal cauldron sat amidst the sea of clouds, its walls forming the city's boundaries, yet they were镂空, allowing glimpses of the interior.
The city's inhabitants lived within the cauldron.
Inside, cloud bridges crisscrossed, and the palaces and pavilions appeared to be constructed from white clouds, creating a predominantly white landscape with other colors serving as mere accents.
The city was divided into several levels, interconnected by cloud bridges.  Each level was arranged in a staggered fashion, with the lowest level resting atop a mountain peak, while the upper levels were entirely constructed from clouds and mist, becoming increasingly mysterious with height.
This scene reminded Qin Sang of the Thunder City of the Divine Court.
Standing before the southern gate, Qin Sang noticed that the security checks weren't particularly strict.
Cloud Cauldron City was home to alchemists, most of whom made their living through alchemy, so it naturally needed to be open to the outside world.
As expected, his approach had attracted attention.  The captain of the guard approached and greeted him respectfully, "Is this senior here to seek a pill?"
"Indeed," Qin Sang nodded.
"The City Lord has decreed that Deity Transformation seniors may directly enter the sixth level of the city. Please, senior, this way."
Cloud Cauldron City had seven levels in total, with the seventh level housing the City Lord's residence.
The captain spoke respectfully. Receiving Qin Sang's assent, he turned and led the way.
Seeing the captain personally escorting him, the nearby cultivators cast curious glances, speculating about Qin Sang's identity, but不敢 to stare too intently.
Qin Sang maintained a calm demeanor, following the captain into the city, appreciating the scenery. Before he knew it, they had ascended to the sixth level.
Looking down from this height, he could only vaguely discern the lower levels, suggesting the presence of formations obscuring the view.
The city had clearly been informed of his arrival. The captain led Qin Sang into a grand hall where another cultivator awaited.
"Late Nascent Soul."
Qin Sang immediately discerned the cultivator's level. Noticing the insignia on his robes, he realized this person held a high position within Cloud Cauldron City.
The cultivator wore white robes, adorned with a small cauldron on his chest.  He had a square face and a composed demeanor, exuding an air of reliability.
He dismissed the guards and bowed respectfully.  "This junior is Fan Rugui, the fourth disciple of Master. Greetings, senior."
"This humble Daoist is Qingfeng, here to seek a pill. I wonder if I might have the honor of requesting your master to personally refine it?"
Qin Sang returned the greeting and spoke directly.
Fan Rugui didn't commit, simply saying, "May I ask what pill senior seeks? Master is currently refining a pill and is occupied. If senior requires his personal attention, this junior will inform him."
"The pill I seek, you've likely never seen before. This is the recipe. I've also gathered some of the ingredients…"
With that, Qin Sang produced a jade slip and handed it to Fan Rugui.
Hearing that it was a recipe unknown to Cloud Cauldron City, Fan Rugui maintained a calm facade, though inwardly skeptical. However, upon receiving the jade slip and glancing at its contents, he became engrossed, unable to tear himself away.
Qin Sang observed Fan Rugui's expression. After a while, he smiled and said, "My words weren't exaggerated, were they?"
Fan Rugui snapped out of his trance, a hint of uncontainable excitement in his eyes.  He stammered, "This recipe… this recipe…"
Qin Sang intentionally furrowed his brow.  "Fellow Daoist Fan, is there something wrong with the recipe? I obtained it from an ancient text, which claimed it originated from the Witch Clan's heritage, vastly different from our human methods. I was worried that human alchemists might be unable to refine it.  Could it be mere fabrication?"
"No! No! No!"
Fan Rugui shook his head vehemently. "Some of the ingredients have different names than what's used today, but the recipe itself is flawless. It's just the principles… It truly is the legendary Witch Clan heritage, no wonder! No wonder!"
The legendary Witch Clan!
Qin Sang frowned and asked, "Cloud Cauldron City hasn't encountered this kind of Witch Clan recipe before?"
"Indeed, this is the first time," Fan Rugui replied honestly.  "Many thanks to senior for bringing this recipe. This junior now knows that such alchemy exists in the world. Master will be overjoyed to learn of this."
Hearing this, Qin Sang couldn't help but sigh inwardly.
The Witch Clan was considered legendary even here. Unless the Witch Clan had declined within the greater universe, or this world was a separate realm like the Talisman World, this place was truly remote.
It seemed his search for Liu Ying and the Ghost Mother would be fruitless for the time being.
"Very well.  I wonder if that star platform on Mount Wushen leads to the Witch Clan's territory.  What if the one I summoned was a Witch Clan Grand Tribulation cultivator related to the Ghost Mother, only to be slain by the First Sword Attendant and True Monarch Zhang at the River of Calamity?  How would I explain that to her when we meet again?"
This thought flashed through Qin Sang's mind. He continued, "Since it's a Witch Clan heritage, are you confident?"
Fan Rugui replied without hesitation, "Rest assured, senior.  Master's alchemy skills are unparalleled in Cloud Metropolis Mountain. He will certainly be able to refine this pill!  Moreover, Master has a standing rule: if someone brings a new recipe, the first refinement is free of charge, until the pill is successfully crafted! Thereafter, each subsequent refinement is half price, and he will mobilize the city's resources to help locate the ingredients!  Of course, the spirit stones and treasures required to purchase the ingredients will be borne by senior."
New recipes held great appeal for alchemists. Master Lingxu wasn't solely motivated by requests from others.
Qin Sang thought to himself as he handed over a mustard seed bag, "I've only managed to gather these.  I hope your master can assist in finding the missing ingredients."
(A recommendation for a great novel, many readers should have seen it, those who like it can check it out.
"I Never Intended to Become Immortal"
I was but a traveler, with no intention of becoming immortal.
After twenty years of cultivation in the deep mountains, my master told me, Song You, to descend the mountain, to witness the world of demons, ghosts, and the myriad forms of life, to visit famous mountains and rivers, and to seek out the legendary immortals, saying that this was true cultivation.
Unexpectedly, after traveling throughout the lands, I discovered that the immortal was myself.)
