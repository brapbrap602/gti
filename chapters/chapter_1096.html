<h1>Chapter 1888: The Witch Clan Cannot Be Without the Grand Witch Priestess</h1><p>The Leaf Cicada was completely drained of its life force.</p><p>Fang Laomo was reborn using the Starwing Cicada.</p><p>But no one knew what powers the Starwing Cicada possessed, that it could actually penetrate the crimson barrier.</p><p>The Ancient Demon's fragmented soul would not let Fang Laomo escape, and its figure flashed, lunging at him.</p><p>The Starwing Cicada's eyes were filled with anxiety.</p><p>Fang Laomo's primordial spirit had been severely damaged. Although he had taken the body of the Starwing Cicada and absorbed the essence of the Leaf Cicada, he only had the power to break through the crimson barrier.</p><p>Just then, Fang Laomo witnessed a scene he would never forget.</p><p>A frail figure suddenly leaped into action—it was the Grand Witch Priestess, standing between him and the Ancient Demon's fragmented soul.</p><p>"The Witch Clan cannot be without the Grand Witch Priestess!"</p><p>The Grand Witch Priestess smiled sadly, leaving behind her farewell words.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The Spring Thunder Silkworm phantom shattered, a point of silver light shining on the Grand Witch Priestess' forehead—her final light of life.</p><p>In an instant, countless threads of lightning spread across the sky, striking back at the Ancient Demon's fragmented soul.</p><p>The Spring Thunder Silkworm fell, and the lightning threads ceased.</p><p>Although she knew that Fang Laomo was not someone worthy of entrusting the entire clan to, she still chose to sacrifice herself, buying Fang Laomo a chance for survival.</p><p>The Witch Clan was far inferior to the Human Clan.</p><p>Even if Lingzhuzi and the others all died here, the Human Clan's foundation would remain, but the Witch Clan would be severely weakened and leaderless.</p><p>The gains from the Ancient God-紋ed Restriction needed someone to take them out, for there was a chance of revitalizing the Witch Clan.</p><p>Countless rays of lightning blocked the way.</p><p>The Ancient Demon's fragmented soul snorted coldly, its demonic energy erupting, intending to forcibly disperse the lightning and capture Fang Laomo.</p><p>At this moment, it felt the same frustration as Mo Qingzhu before.</p><p>Qingzhu's main body once again vibrated the Spirit Sword fragment, fiercely resisting.  Furthermore, because the Ancient Demon's fragmented soul had used the Mystical Art, "Riven Yuan Slash," its strength had greatly diminished, making suppressing Qingzhu's main body increasingly difficult.</p><p>The Ancient Demon's fragmented soul was caught off guard, its demonic energy surging, nearly being engulfed by the lightning.</p><p>A furious roar came from its throat, and it had to abandon its advance, forcibly suppressing Qingzhu, its demonic energy forming a curtain. At all costs, it endured the lightning’s attack, snatching out the Grand Witch Priestess, whose essence was almost completely consumed.</p><p>The Grand Witch Priestess died with her eyes closed and was placed in the blood coffin.</p><p>By this time, Fang Laomo had already penetrated the crimson barrier and disappeared.</p><p>Fang Laomo breaking through the crimson barrier was the second escape, after the Elder from the Four Saints Palace.</p><p>His eyes flickered.</p><p>He had thought that after cultivating to his realm, his heart would be as hard as iron, unmoved by external things or people, but the Grand Witch Priestess's final appearance and words remained lingering in his mind.</p><p>Previously, Fang Laomo had thought the Grand Witch Priestess was merely using the revitalization of the Witch Clan as an excuse to gain power and resources, and he had disregarded her.  Now he saw his mistake.</p><p>He had benefited from the Grand Witch Priestess’s belief.</p><p>Fang Laomo’s emotions were complex. He vibrated his Starwing Cicada wings and ultimately chose to rush to the location of the Divine Furnace.</p><p>The Grand Witch Priestess was dead.</p><p>Even if they could eventually seal the Ancient Demon, only Human Clan experts would be saved.</p><p>However, once the Ancient Demon broke free and the demonic calamity appeared, the Witch Clan would also suffer immense casualties.</p><p>Fang Laomo did not seize the Divine Furnace but chose to repair the Ancient God-紋ed Restriction.</p><p>At this time, the Elder from the Four Saints Palace had also arrived at the Dragon Corpse Ancient Temple, working against the clock to repair the Demon Clan's Ancient Restriction.</p><p>…</p><p>The Ancient Demon's fragmented soul was filled with rage. Its gaze shifted, fixing on the Demon Lord.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>The next moment, the Ancient Demon's fragmented soul appeared before the Demon Lord, reaching out to grab the person next to it. Demonic energy turned into shackles, wrapping around Nangui Xianzi and violently pulling her over.</p><p>Everyone present had become lambs to the slaughter, at the mercy of the Ancient Demon's fragmented soul.</p><p>Just as the Ancient Demon's fragmented soul began its killing spree.</p><p>Qin Sang was secretly transmitting a message to Lingzhuzi.</p><p>"Senior, I still have one strike left, with the power of a top-grade magic treasure, but I need your protection to prevent the Ancient Demon from noticing…"</p><p>At this time, Qin Sang finally condensed the fire seed into its final form.</p><p>Because of this, he suffered a splitting headache, enduring pain that was probably no less than Lingzhuzi and the others. If not for the Jade Buddha, he would have already turned to ashes.</p><p>The reason he cultivated this secret art at such a critical juncture, at all costs, was due to a conjecture Qin Sang had after seeing the "Fire Seed Golden Lotus."</p><p>If his conjecture was correct, he would be able to launch an attack with the power of a Nascent Soul cultivator, perhaps saving his own life at a crucial moment.</p><p>The Demon Banner Formation's key lies in the Nine Nether Demon Fire.</p><p>Eighteen Demon Banners, each sealing demon fire, the power of the array depends on how many banners and demon fires he can control.</p><p>With Qin Sang's current cultivation, he could only control nine banners to form an array at most.</p><p>The Nine Nether Demon Fire was unruly, and controlling it was extremely difficult.</p><p>But if he could tame a wisp of demonic fire, refine a demonic seed, and merge it with the Nether Demonic Fire, would his spirit sense, imbued with the Nether Demonic Fire's essence, gain its acceptance and lessen its resistance?</p><p>In the Purple Mist Forbidden Ground, he had confirmed this. Unclaimed Nether Demonic Fires didn't inherently harbor strong hostility towards each other and wouldn't fiercely retaliate.</p><p>Previously, Qin Sang had used demonic fire to shroud himself, successfully infiltrating the demonic restriction to reach the Ghostlands and meet Bai.</p><p>This way, he could control ten or more demonic banners, setting up a far more powerful demonic banner formation!</p><p>Qin Sang had never deployed more than nine demonic banners; he wasn't sure about the ultimate power, but it was worth a try.</p><p>One attack would suffice!</p><p>Qin Sang, single-mindedly, refined the fire seed until it finally took shape, a tiny black seed-like thing appearing in his Purple Mansion.</p><p>The demonic fire aura was extremely faint, as if a gust of wind could extinguish it.</p><p>This was Qin Sang's limit.</p><p>He understood that his cultivation was insufficient; he was far from being able to control demonic fire.  Maintaining the fire seed was already a stroke of luck.  To utilize demonic fire like Old Devil Mou, even after forming his Nascent Soul, it might still be impossible.</p><p>Even so, if Old Devil Mou saw how fast Qin Sang refined the fire seed, he would be absolutely dumbfounded.</p><p>Upon completing the secret technique, Qin Sang was horrified to discover that the situation had become irredeemable. After Ling Zhuzi and the others died, the ancient demon's remnant soul wouldn't mind throwing them into the blood coffin as well.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't know how effective his attack would be, but he would absolutely not just wait to die!</p><p>Seeing Ling Zhuzi not far away, Qin Sang immediately sent a voice transmission, quickly explaining the situation.</p><p>Critically injured and near death, Ling Zhuzi was astonished upon receiving Qin Sang's transmission.</p><p>A minor character unexpectedly drawn into the conflict, overlooked by both sides, was not gravely injured by the demonic howl and claimed to still possess the power to counterattack – how could this not surprise him?</p><p>At this moment, any assistance couldn't be missed.</p><p>They were severely wounded.</p><p>The ancient demon's remnant soul, eager for quick success, had also paid a price and suffered significant losses; it was a mutually destructive situation.</p><p>Ling Zhuzi immediately made a decision, transmitting, "Set up your formation. I'll help conceal it. Follow my instructions."</p><p>He gathered his remaining energy, erecting a barrier around Qin Sang to mask the formation's fluctuations.</p><p>Qin Sang let out a breath, sat cross-legged, and summoned the demonic banners.</p><p>He found that the banners were indeed easier to manipulate than before. The resistance he faced when directing the Nether Demonic Fire within the banners had weakened.</p><p>Qin Sang took out all eighteen demonic banners at once.</p>
