<h1>Chapter 2064: Yuanjiao Mirage Market</h1><p>“Thank you, Fellow Daoist, for your concern.”</p><p>Si Lu stood up and bowed solemnly.</p><p>“You’re welcome! You’re welcome! I haven't yet repaid Fellow Daoist for saving my life…”</p><p>Ji Hong waved his hands repeatedly, then suddenly widened his round eyes, finally noticing the change in Si Lu’s aura. “Fellow Daoist, have you already broken through to the second level of the Void Realm?”</p><p>“I was fortunate enough to pass this tribulation. I was in secluded cultivation for the breakthrough and was unaware that Fellow Daoist was looking for me.” Si Lu deliberately kept the details of his recent experiences vague.</p><p>Ji Hong was overjoyed, his small face beaming with anticipation. “Now that Fellow Daoist has emerged from seclusion, are you planning to gather your former subordinates and launch a counteroffensive?”</p><p>Si Lu gave a wry smile. “Including Senior Xia, several elders perished protecting me. I fear many of my former subordinates have already defected to the enemy. My current forces are far weaker than before. How can I speak of a counteroffensive?”</p><p>He glanced at Qin Sang beside him. “I will absolutely not give up, but the time is not yet right. Those people must be searching for me everywhere. Staying in the Siyou Tribe’s territory will only tie my hands and feet.  Operating in the shadows like a skulking rat is not the righteous path. It's better to leave first. I plan to leave this place temporarily, find a place to settle down, and accumulate strength.”</p><p>“Good idea!”</p><p>Ji Hong strongly agreed. “Leaving here is like a bird soaring into the vast sky! The Siyou Tribe's reach cannot extend to other places. Where does Fellow Daoist plan to go? Perhaps I've been there and can guide you.”</p><p>“I’m tentatively considering the Zhuyan Tribe…”</p><p>Si Lu briefly explained their plan.</p><p>“The Zhuyan…” Ji Hong wrinkled his small nose and snorted. “Those stinking monkeys are extremely barbaric!”</p><p>“Has Fellow Daoist been to the Zhuyan Tribe’s territory?” Si Lu inquired.</p><p>Ji Hong reluctantly nodded. Judging by his expression, the experience was clearly unpleasant. He complained, “Those uncivilized wild monkeys have no understanding of etiquette. I couldn't stand it after just a few days and never went back! Fellow Daoist must think twice!”</p><p>Qin Sang and Si Lu exchanged glances. It seemed Ji Hong held considerable resentment.</p><p>Si Lu said, “Whether the Zhuyan are barbaric or not is unimportant. I won't be staying in the Zhuyan Tribe’s territory. I plan to choose a Royal Tribe under their rule to reside in and avoid interacting with them as much as possible. Fellow Daoist, do you know how many Royal Tribes are under the Zhuyan’s jurisdiction?”</p><p>Ji Hong reached into a pocket on his robe and pulled out something melon-seed shaped, like some kind of seed, then suddenly cried out, “Wrong one!”</p><p>His robe had dozens of pockets. After rummaging for a while, he pulled out a ball of purple light from one of them.</p><p>As the purple light manifested, a book appeared. It was square, half a man tall, and quite thick.</p><p>The book's surface shimmered with radiant light, indicating its extraordinary material, as if made from some kind of beast hide. The cover was inscribed with characters Qin Sang had never seen before.</p><p>Ji Hong grasped the corner of the book with his small hand and lifted it as if he were a mighty warrior, making one wonder if the book would flatten him if it fell.</p><p>He pointed a finger, and the book tilted slightly, floating in mid-air. He hopped up, about to open the book, then suddenly turned to stare at Qin Sang.</p><p>“Brother Qin is not an outsider.”</p><p>Si Lu said.</p><p>Ji Hong withdrew his gaze and hesitated. “Fellow Daoist has saved my life. Anything I have obtained myself, I can give to you. However, this Myriad Tribes Record was brought out from my tribe. It records the divine abilities and secrets of various tribes. It was recorded by the adventurous travels of my tribe's sages. Without the Patriarch's permission, it cannot be shown to outsiders. Please, you two, do not peek.”</p><p>Si Lu quickly said, “Rest assured, Fellow Daoist, we definitely won't peek.”</p><p>Ji Hong seemed to trust him completely and didn't ask them to leave. A purple light flashed on his body as he slipped into the gap between the pages.</p><p>The surface of the book was enveloped in a purple haze. It wasn't opened, but the rustling sound of flipping pages came from within. Qin Sang and Si Lu sat to the side, communicating through sound transmission. Neither of them used any techniques to peek at the book.</p><p>A moment later, the flipping stopped, and Ji Hong's slightly muffled voice came from inside.  “…Jiaojiao, Zuzhi, Zhangyou…”</p><p>“Wait!”</p><p>Si Lu called out. “Under the Zhuyan’s rule, is there truly a tribe called Zhangyou?”</p><p>Purple light flickered, and a small head poked out from the gap between the pages, somewhat puzzled. “Yes! But the record says the Zhangyou are only a small tribe, likely not even qualified to participate in the Yuanjiao Mirage Market. Otherwise, how come I've never heard of their deeds before?”</p><p>After hearing Si Lu’s explanation through sound transmission, Qin Sang learned that the Yuanjiao Mirage Market was a grand gathering of the 異人族 (Yi Ren Zu, meaning unusual people, here referring to a specific, non-human race. For consistency's sake, they will be referred to as the Otherkin from this point forward), regardless of whether they belonged to the Celestial Division, the Aquatic Division, or neither. As long as a tribe possessed sufficient strength, it could receive an invitation.</p><p>The Yuanjiao Mirage Market was not only a place for the Otherkin to discuss important matters but also an opportunity for various divisions to exchange resources and test their divine abilities against each other. It held extraordinary significance in the eyes of the Otherkin.</p><p>Finally having found information about the Zhangyou Tribe, Qin Sang felt slightly relieved. The facts confirmed their suspicions that the Zhangyou were a small tribe. Thus, Storm Realm might be able to withstand them. Hopefully, the situation hadn’t changed.</p><p>Thinking of this, Qin Sang transmitted a few more words to Si Lu.</p><p>Si Lu said, “A small tribe is easier to control. We will go to the Zhangyou Tribe first.  Is there anything else recorded in the book?”</p><p>Ji Hong shook his head. “The book only mentions that the Zhangyou Tribe have four ears and are skilled in manipulating water.”</p><p>He crawled out from within, wiped his small hand over the cover, and the book transformed into purple light, disappearing into his pocket. He then hopped onto the table.</p><p>Now that they had a clear goal, Qin Sang was somewhat impatient. Without avoiding Ji Hong, he immediately discussed their next steps with Si Lu.</p><p>Ji Hong sat on the lid of a cup, swinging his small legs, occasionally interjecting. He seemed even more familiar with the area surrounding the Siyou Tribe than Si Lu.  Towards the end, Qin Sang and Si Lu were practically asking him for advice.</p><p>Si Lu understood Qin Sang's intentions and addressed Ji Hong with cupped hands. “Would Fellow Daoist be willing to accompany us on our journey?”</p><p>Ji Hong looked at him strangely.  “Of course I’ll go with you! Neither of you have traveled through the Mist Tide before. Only I have!”</p><p>He patted his small chest, his face full of confidence.</p><p>By now, he had realized that Qin Sang's identity was not simple, certainly not Si Lu’s attendant, but he didn't ask further. He was here to repay Si Lu for saving his life; everything else was irrelevant to him.  As long as he knew Qin Sang was Si Lu's ally, that was enough.</p><p>“Thank you, Fellow Daoist.”</p><p>Si Lu was overjoyed.</p><p>Although Qin Sang and Su Nu hadn’t made things difficult for him, as a member of another race, he always felt out of place. Traveling alone was inconvenient. Having Ji Hong's company would lessen his sense of isolation.</p><p>After careful discussion, they determined a clear route. Just then, Qin Sang suddenly caught a whiff of a fragrant aroma.</p><p>He saw Ji Hong take something out of his pocket and take a delightful bite, watching Qin Sang and Si Lu discuss their plans as he ate.</p><p>The object appeared to be a fruit, shaped like a grain of rice, its surface as white as jade, far larger than ordinary rice. Ji Hong needed both hands to hold it while he gnawed on it.</p><p>Qin Sang twitched his nose slightly, and the fragrance burst in his nostrils. However, the scent wasn't overpowering, but rather a pure aroma that diffused within his body, permeating his internal organs.</p><p>The bite mark on the fruit glowed with a lustrous sheen, like honeydew.</p><p>??????????.??????</p><p>Noticing Qin Sang’s gaze, Ji Hong’s expression froze, and a look of vigilance appeared on his face. He quickly shifted his body, shielding the object in his hand. “No!”</p><p>He quickly swallowed, finishing it in a few bites. His voice was muffled. “One is enough for me to be full. You're so big, you'd need… a whole bowl to be satisfied!”</p><p>As he spoke, he stretched out his arms to gesture, shaking his head like a rattle drum. “No! No!”</p><p>Qin Sang’s face stiffened slightly. He was merely curious, not about to snatch food from someone else’s mouth. A candid nature was a good thing, but it often led to unexpected actions.</p><p>However, Ji Hong wasn't being deliberately deceptive, acting entirely from his heart. Qin Sang wouldn't hold it against him.</p><p>Si Lu smiled. “Fellow Daoist Ji Hong, is this the Blessed Grain you cultivated yourself?”</p><p>He then turned to Qin Sang and explained, “The Jiaojiao Tribe excels at cultivating superior strains, capable of transforming the ordinary into the extraordinary. Spiritual seeds cultivated by Fellow Daoists of the Jiaojiao Tribe, if consumed regularly, have effects comparable to certain spiritual medicines, greatly benefiting cultivation and even improving one’s aptitude. They are extremely precious. This Blessed Grain is one such example. Fellow Daoist Ji Hong, unafraid of danger, travels everywhere, always venturing into uncharted territories, solely to gather exceptional seeds from across the world…”</p><p>“Cultivating superior strains?”</p><p>Qin Sang’s eyes lit up. He hadn’t expected Ji Hong to possess such an ability. His thoughts raced, but his expression remained unchanged. He bowed slightly. “Fellow Daoist not only possesses great divine abilities but also great perseverance and courage. I admire you.”</p><p>Ji Hong looked pleased, his gaze towards Qin Sang softening with a hint of closeness. He said, with a hint of reluctance, “I’m not very familiar with Fellow Daoist yet. Once we become more acquainted, I will gift you a Blessed Grain. I’ve never told a lie. If you don't believe me, ask Fellow Daoist Si Lu.”</p><p>Si Lu smiled. “I was fortunate enough to taste it once. Blessed Grain truly lives up to its reputation.”</p><p>Qin Sang thanked him, not feeling anxious. Once he lured this person back to Storm Realm, there would be plenty of opportunities.</p><p>This kind of straightforward person was easiest to deal with, but such individuals often had a keen understanding of the world and were very perceptive. One had to treat them sincerely for them to reciprocate.</p><p>Having settled on all matters, the three decided to depart the city without further delay.</p><p>They met up with Su Nu and the others outside the city.  Seeing Ji Hong perched on Si Lu’s shoulder, everyone was surprised after hearing Si Lu's introduction.</p><p>…</p><p>Above a stretch of sea, the flying boat slowly descended, revealing Qin Sang and the others as they gazed ahead.</p><p>A vast expanse of white fog stretched across the sea surface, a wall of mist spanning as far as the eye could see, with no end in sight, reaching towards the sky without a visible top.  The mist churned incessantly, thinning towards the outer edges, forming a somewhat indistinct boundary.</p><p>Qin Sang and his companions, after a long journey, passing through the territories of several Royal Tribes under the Siyou Tribe, finally arrived before the Mist Tide.</p><p>They had been extremely cautious along the way, only utilizing teleportation formations when absolutely certain of their safety, otherwise preferring to travel by their own flight, thus arriving safely at this location.</p><p>“The mist seems thinner here,” Su Nu observed.</p><p>Qin Sang gazed towards the edge of the mist wall.  “The place guarded by the Siyou Tribe experts is further ahead.”</p><p>The mist within the Mist Sea was ever-changing, dense in some areas and thin in others, but thinness didn't necessarily mean safety.</p><p>The group rested briefly, concealing their auras, and quietly approached their destination.</p><p>Soon, Qin Sang transmitted a message for everyone to stop. Focusing his senses, he detected fluctuations of a formation ahead.</p><p>It should be the grand formation set up by the Siyou Tribe. Faint auras emanated from within the formation, making it impossible to determine the number of experts inside. However, Qin Sang was certain there were beings who posed a threat to him.</p><p>With guardians watching, they couldn't directly enter the Mist Tide from there. Qin Sang looked around, signaling everyone to retreat, finding a deserted island to settle Gu Ya and the others. Then, the three Void Refinement cultivators separated to explore the periphery of the Mist Tide, quickly returning with results.</p><p>They chose to enter the Mist Tide from another location, gradually moving towards the main path.</p><p>Entering the Mist Tide, the familiar sensation immediately returned, even stronger than during the Mist Year season. If one were to get lost here, they might never escape the Mist Tide.  Moreover, within the Mist Tide, the threats of Mistfalls and Mist Beasts were magnified several times, and many known patterns no longer applied.</p><p>The Mist Tide could appear calm, then a Mistfall would suddenly descend. If one reacted too slowly, they would be swept away, their fate unknown.</p><p>And this wasn’t the only danger.  Everyone maintained their focus, not daring to relax for a moment.</p><p>Qin Sang, with Ji Hong on his shoulder, led the way, followed by Si Lu and Su Nu at the rear. The group silently traversed the white mist.</p><p>Qin Sang awakened the Heaven’s Eye Butterfly, stopping and starting, successfully guiding everyone back to the correct direction.</p><p>Perhaps due to good fortune, they encountered almost no danger.</p><p>After traveling through the Mist Tide for more than ten days, Qin Sang suddenly seemed to sense something. He signaled everyone to stop, his gaze fixed intently ahead.</p><p>“Fellow Daoist, have you discovered something?”</p><p>Ji Hong stood up on his shoulder, widening his eyes, but saw nothing.</p><p>“Ahead…”</p><p>Qin Sang hesitated. “There's a palace!”</p><p>“A palace?”</p><p>Ji Hong was startled, then immediately reacted, exclaiming joyfully, “It’s a mirage! It must be a mirage!”</p><p>The so-called mirage was a celestial phenomenon within the Mist Sea. Its appearance was unpredictable, most frequent during the Mist Year season.</p><p>“Are there no other people there? I’ve never seen a mirage in this area before. Let’s go take a look!”</p><p>Ji Hong urged repeatedly.</p><p>Qin Sang led the group in flight for a while, gradually seeing the shadowy outline of the palace he mentioned. It resembled a celestial palace amidst the clouds, nestled among towering mystical mountains, surrounded by swirling mist, with pavilions and palaces scattered throughout, shrouded in mystery.</p><p>The scene within the depths of the dense fog was unclear, the celestial palace seemingly endless.</p><p>The gates of the palaces were tightly shut, devoid of life or Mist Beasts, appearing deathly still.</p><p>However, the moment they saw the palaces, everyone was awestruck by their grandeur, unable to discern whether it was real or an illusion. Qin Sang was secretly astonished. Mirages were supposed to be illusions, yet the Heaven’s Eye Butterfly couldn't see through it, as if the celestial palace truly existed.</p><p>“Fellow Daoist Qin, should we venture inside and investigate?”</p><p>Ji Hong was completely captivated, his face full of anticipation as he looked at Qin Sang. “Legend has it that some mirages are illusory, and within them, one can experience all sorts of mystical events.  Upon exiting, it feels like waking from a dream. But there are also mirages that blend reality and illusion. Treasures obtained within them remain even after the mirage dissipates…”</p><p>Having experienced Ju Shan’s Zhi Zhi Altar and Feng Ju’s Jade Gate, Qin Sang knew that in the eyes of those great powers, the line between reality and illusion might not be clearly defined. He hadn't expected such mystical occurrences within the Mist Sea.</p><p>“Not advisable!”</p><p>Si Lu’s expression was serious. “There are indeed rumors of obtaining opportunities within mirages, but more often, those who enter are unable to return, vanishing from the world along with the mirage.  If a mirage appeared outside the Mist Tide, it might be worth exploring, but right now, it's best not to enter.”</p><p>As they spoke, the image of the palace began to fade, vanishing before their eyes in the blink of an eye.</p>
