<h1>Chapter 2201: Blood Pill</h1><p>Qin Sang observed the Xian Tong's demeanor, further confirming his judgment.  At this moment, Qin Sang's main body, his Dharma body, and the Thunder Beast Guards formed a siege, surrounding the Xian Tong. After Qin Sang's Dharma body appeared, the Xian Tong recalled the companion beasts that were charging towards Qin Sang, protecting them beside him.</p><p>The next moment, Qin Sang's Dharma body flickered, transforming into a stream of light and merging back into his main body. He still preferred to utilize the Qingluan True Thunder within his main body's phoenix wings to enhance the power of his thunder techniques. However, to unleash the true power of his thunder techniques, there was another obstacle to overcome. He slightly tilted his head, looking towards the top of the Xian Tong's head.</p><p>A black jade gourd, its true form concealed, floated in the river. This was the source of the Nine Turns Annihilation Wind, filled with a profound and persistent power.  At the bottom of the surging river, the Nine Turns Annihilation Wind showed no signs of weakening. The wind and fire seemed to ignore the river water, blowing towards every corner of the battlefield.</p><p>Qin Sang was at the very center of the Nine Turns Annihilation Wind, and his every move was affected by this domain of wind and fire.  "Hmph!" Qin Sang silently cast a spell, and a gust of dark wind suddenly arose. Within the Nine Turns Annihilation Wind, another wind blew—a dull yellow, evil wind, its color similar to the surrounding river water.  The wind howled like ghostly cries, eerie and terrifying.</p><p>The evil wind arrived, and the Xian Tong's expression tightened. Since Qin Sang's Dharma body and the Thunder Beast Guards appeared, he had been shrouded in a deep sense of unease. Even if he didn't want to believe it, the facts were undeniable: Tang Xiong was likely dead, and the balance of power had shifted dramatically!  And Qi Xiong... he couldn't believe that Qi Xiong, with his strength, would die at the hands of that female cultivator, but why was there no news from him?</p><p>Now, his concern was no longer revenge but his own safety!</p><p>Sensing this strange evil wind, the Xian Tong immediately became wary.  The snake scales on his robe shimmered with strange light, firmly blocking the evil wind. However, the evil wind wasn't aimed at him. It grew stronger and stronger, threatening to surpass the Nine Turns Annihilation Wind, dyeing the surrounding swirling wind and fire a dull yellow.</p><p>"Not good!"</p><p>The Xian Tong finally understood Qin Sang's intention: to use the evil wind to counteract the Nine Turns Annihilation Wind.  He couldn't let him succeed! The Annihilation Gourd spun rapidly, and the vortex of wind and fire at the gourd's mouth suddenly expanded, greatly increasing the power of the Nine Turns Annihilation Wind.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the evil wind did not yield. The dull yellow wind mixed with river water, like sharp daggers, fiercely pierced into the Nine Turns Annihilation Wind. The two winds, vastly different yet equally powerful, intertwined, with wind, fire, and yellow water merging everywhere.</p><p>The evil wind was a secret technique recorded in the *Poison God Codex*, called the Hook-Poison Divine Art, one of the few secret techniques effective even at the Void Refinement stage. This technique required a potent poison, ideally one made from a spiritual herb called Moon-Hook, to be used in conjunction. If this poison was unavailable, other poisons could be used, but the power would be affected and related to the potency and dosage of the poison used.</p><p>Qin Sang did not have Moon-Hook. With his mastery of poison techniques, it was almost impossible for him to counter the Nine Turns Annihilation Wind. However, they were deep within the Poison River, where the river's potent poisons were virtually limitless and readily available.  Along the way, Qin Sang carefully studied the river's poisons, and combining this with his previous readings, he had mastered their toxicity, making the Poison River his ally.</p><p>Once unleashed, the Hook-Poison Divine Art erupted with formidable power. The wind raged, growing increasingly violent, almost matching the Nine Turns Annihilation Wind.</p><p>Heaven, Earth, and People—before, the Xian Tong held the advantage of "People."  With one trapped and one slain, that advantage had crumbled. Qin Sang now held the advantage of "Earth," and the tide was turning in his favor.</p><p>With the Nine Turns Annihilation Wind held in check by the Hook-Poison Divine Art, Qin Sang felt a sudden lightness. The wind and fire's effect on his thunder power was greatly reduced, and even the lightning on the Thunder Beast Guards became brighter.</p><p>"Swish! Swish!" At that moment, four streams of light shot out from the battlefield—the Xian Tong's four companion beasts.  The Xian Tong was not without decisiveness. Seeing that the Nine Turns Annihilation Wind was faltering, he immediately ordered his companion beasts to charge in different directions, all avoiding Qin Sang and the Thunder Beast Guards.</p><p>The immortal remained motionless, his robes billowing, a jade bracelet soaring above him, transforming into a white halo of protective light.  This clearly shielded him from Qin Sang's Five Thunders Heavenly Heart Seal.</p><p>His intentions were obvious: revenge was a pipe dream; his priority was to escape Qin Sang and regroup. He would use his physical form as bait; if even one of his companion beasts escaped, he would survive.</p><p>But Qin Sang, intimately familiar with the powers of the Siyou clan, would never allow the immortal child to flee.</p><p>And this was exactly what Qin Sang wanted; it meant the immortal child had lost his fighting spirit!</p><p>A flash! Five-colored divine light shot from his sleeve toward one of the companion beasts.  This wasn't a deliberate action by Qin Sang; the direction of the light was controlled by Xiao Wu, conserving Qin Sang's energy.</p><p>Immediately, the battlefield blazed with lightning and sword light, each display of power overwhelming.</p><p>A tearing sound! The wind was drowned out by thunder as a lightning bolt cleaved the river, striking another companion beast.</p><p>Beneath the lightning, the shadow of the Grey Warbler Sword locked onto a third beast.</p><p>The last beast faced the Thunder Beast Guard, which transformed into a streak of lightning, piercing the void, easily intercepting its path.</p><p>The Siyou clansman's four companion beasts did not equate to four Transcendence Realm fighters. For most Siyou cultivators, a single companion beast could only harass and disrupt; facing a strong enemy, it would be severely weakened. Of course, they could use secret techniques to combine the power of all four beasts into one, even if the others were scattered and hadn't recovered. This was one key difference between companion beasts and spirit beasts. Similar techniques abounded, varied and unpredictable, with each cultivator specializing in different ones.</p><p>The immortal child's lineage was extraordinary; his companion beasts were also powerful and highly significant. Yet Qin Sang attacked relentlessly. If the immortal child continued to disperse his forces, he would be defeated piecemeal!</p><p>Despite having already witnessed Qin Sang's power, seeing his four companion beasts blocked, the immortal child's expression changed, a dark light flashing in his eyes.</p><p>He used some secret technique, and three of his companion beasts vanished, only to reappear beside the fourth.</p><p>The four beasts merged into one, and the Grey Warbler Sword stood in its path.</p><p>This was unexpected. Neither the Grand Deacon nor the Si Emperor, nor anyone else, had ever used such a technique before; it was likely a unique ability of the immortal child.</p><p>In the previous chase, Qin Sang had used overwhelming swordsmanship requiring instantaneous bursts, mostly employing layered formations, never fully revealing his Four-Image Sword Array.</p><p>Against layered formations, the merged beast would have a chance to break through.</p><p>The sword's shadow trembled slightly.</p><p>Sensing the fluctuations of the Four-Image Sword Array, the immortal child felt a surge of foreboding. The Thunder Beast Guard was charging towards him, now very close.</p><p>If all his companion beasts were trapped and cut off from him, the consequences would be disastrous!</p><p>"Return!"</p><p>The immortal child, momentarily flustered, hastily used a secret technique to recall the beast just as it was about to fall into the sword array.</p><p>He breathed heavily, his face pale; this technique was not easy to use, especially after having used it twice in quick succession.</p><p>The void trembled.</p><p>A white light flashed beside the immortal child as the merged companion beast returned, immediately facing immense pressure.</p><p>The Thunder Beast Guard thundered towards him. Its armor, forged from lightning, resembled a descending thunder god, a battlefield general, towering and fearless, existing only for battle!</p><p>Lightning seared the immortal child's eyes, his vision filled with a massive fist.  The terrifying might of the thunder enveloped the punch, like a silver sun, radiating an aura of destruction.</p><p>"Roar!"</p><p>The companion beast roared, like a dragon's cry.</p><p>This beast had a unique appearance: a fish body with a dragon's head.  Its long body was covered in dragon scales; its fins were like blades. Its head and snout resembled a dragon's, with long whiskers, but certain features clearly indicated it was a fish.</p><p>This was a rare and extraordinary creature, a dragon-fish. The immortal child had once obtained a drop of dragon-fish essence from his ancestor, which he used to create this companion beast.</p><p>Amidst its roar, the dragon-fish violently swung its tail, creating waves that crashed down with overwhelming force against the silver sun.</p><p>A deafening boom!  The collision was earth-shattering, causing a tidal wave to engulf the poisonous river.</p><p>Then, darkness descended!</p><p>The immortal child, having recalled the dragon-fish, missed his chance to escape. Qin Sang didn't stop his sword technique; the Four-Image Sword Array enveloped the battlefield!</p><p>The poisonous river disappeared from view; the immortal child found himself in boundless space, surrounded by sparkling stars.</p><p>But the Thunder Beast Guard hadn't vanished, and the thunder seal above was clearly visible.</p><p>BOOM!  BOOM! BOOM!…</p><p>Immediately, the Immortal Child and the dragon fish were engulfed by thunder and lightning. The Thunder Beast Guard attacked with all its might, its form splitting into thousands, appearing everywhere at once, completely surrounding the Immortal Child.</p><p>Simultaneously, Qin Sang mobilized the Azure Thunder True Lightning and summoned the Five Thunder Heavenly Heart Seal.</p><p>Having eliminated the influence of the Nine Turns Annihilation Wind, this was the Five Thunder Heavenly Heart Seal at its peak, once capable of withstanding even the Heavenly Prison Golden Lock.</p><p>*Crack!*  The Azure Lightning struck the halo above the Immortal Child's head. The halo, radiating a milky white light, actually blocked the lightning.</p><p>Sensing the fluctuations of the white light, Qin Sang's heart stirred. He discovered it was very similar to the golden light of the Heavenly Prison Golden Lock, even possibly originating from the same source.</p><p>Indeed, the jade bracelet of the Immortal Child and the Heavenly Prison Golden Lock of the Grand Protector were both gifts from the Ancestor, treasures of the same origin. The Immortal Child knew that Qin Sang was not afraid of the Heavenly Prison Golden Lock, so he hadn't used the bracelet to attack Qin Sang earlier.</p><p>Now, the Immortal Child only used the bracelet to defend against Qin Sang's attacks, leaving the Heavenly Eye Butterfly's Xu Xuan Divine Light unused.</p><p>However, Qin Sang's methods didn't stop there.  Surrounding sword stars continuously shone, countless sword lights rained down, and three-headed star demons flickered within the sword light.</p><p>Even with the Immortal Child's remarkable supernatural powers and treasures, facing the combined assault of Qin Sang and the Thunder Beast Guard, he was in a perilous situation.</p><p>At that moment, Qin Sang's gaze suddenly sharpened. He stared intently at the center of the star sea, sensing a strange aura.</p><p>As this aura spread, Qin Sang felt an indescribable threat, a warning bell ringing in his heart.</p><p>At this time, the Immortal Child held a blood pill in his palm. This pill was a recent gift from the Ancestor, originally intended for use only later in a critical moment.  Now, facing imminent danger, he no longer hesitated.</p><p>The pill had a special nature; the Ancestor had sealed it with a special technique. Once unsealed, its potency would be lost.</p><p>Unfortunately, breaking the Ancestor's seal required time; otherwise, upon hearing of Tang's death, the Immortal Child might have used the blood pill immediately.</p><p>This blood pill wasn't for him. The Immortal Child gently vibrated his palm, sending the blood pill flying towards the dragon fish, which swallowed it in one gulp.</p><p>The dragon fish suddenly stiffened, blood energy seeping from between each scale. It roared wildly, as if enduring immense pain, pain that the Immortal Child could clearly sense.</p><p>His temples throbbed, his expression contorted.</p><p>Qin Sang and the Thunder Beast Guard perceived the fleeting opening revealed by the Immortal Child. Their fierce attack came instantly.</p><p>"Roar!"</p><p>With a terrifying roar, the dragon fish violently lashed its tail.</p><p>*Slap!* The dragon fish's body, like a whip, made a tremendous sound. The moment its tail lashed out, even Qin Sang's expression changed.</p><p>The Thunder Beast Guard faced the tail without flinching. It let out a low growl, its body erupting with thunder and lightning, endless bolts converging before it into a wall of light, thick as a mountain.  Easily grabbing the light wall, it struck down forcefully.</p><p>*Rumble…*  In the vastness of space, thunder echoed endlessly, reverberating through countless stars.</p><p>The explosion swept across the star sea, shaking countless stars.</p><p>Suddenly, a figure flew from the center of the explosion – the Thunder Beast Guard.  It retreated repeatedly, its light wall now a shattered remnant.</p><p>The figures of the Immortal Child and the dragon fish then reappeared. The dragon fish also looked strained; large sections of its tail scales were shattered and bloody. Surveying his surroundings, to his disappointment, he had failed to break the sword array in one fell swoop. However, the impact of the tail had fully exposed a weakness in the array: the Four-Symbol Sword Array actually only had three symbols!</p><p>Standing on the dragon fish's neck, the Immortal Child activated his mental energy. The dragon fish undulated, heading directly towards the northern Chaos Nebula.</p><p>The power of the pill wouldn't last; he had to escape quickly.</p><p>The dragon fish, having swallowed the blood pill, experienced a surge in power, acting like a beast native to the stars, instantly traversing vast star regions. With the power it displayed, if allowed into the Chaos Nebula, the Four-Symbol Sword Array would struggle to contain it.</p><p>However, reaching the Chaos Nebula wouldn't be easy. The Thunder Beast Guard attacked again, and Qin Sang quickly shifted his formations.</p><p>The earlier tail swipe had been too powerful, its aftershocks continuously impacting the sword array.  Seizing a fleeting opportunity, the Immortal Child flicked his sleeve, releasing a black ray.</p><p>Enveloping a thin black needle, the black ray appeared above the Chaos Nebula in an instant, transforming into a towering black tower that crashed down.</p><p>The black tower plunged into the depths of the nebula, like a malignant growth, firmly rooted there.</p><p>Whatever this black tower was, regardless of how Qin Sang shifted his formations, he couldn't remove it from the nebula.</p><p>As long as the tower remained, the Immortal Child could receive guidance and easily calculate the sword array's weaknesses.</p><p>It seemed they had to destroy the black tower by force.</p><p>Qin Sang's face darkened, immediately making a decision. He changed his target and unleashed the Five Thunder Heavenly Heart Seal, sending a bolt of Azure Lightning crashing onto the tower's peak.</p><p>The black tower trembled violently; a crack spread from the peak to the base.</p><p>Unexpectedly, at that moment, the dragon fish lashed its tail again, with the same power as before, causing the sword array to shake once more.</p><p>The Immortal Child silently muttered an incantation, and the black tower instantly restored itself.</p>
