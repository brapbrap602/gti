<h1>Chapter 761: The Ninth Person</h1><p>Chapter 761: The Ninth Person</p><p>After they left, the area around the ancient altar was struck by a violent thunderstorm.</p><p>Lei Suo's fury unleashed a furious storm of lightning, causing the beasts to wail and their corpses to be reduced to dust.</p><p>When the storm subsided, the area around the ancient altar fell silent.</p><p>After a while, a figure appeared near the altar—Qin Sang.</p><p>From the moment Xiang Yi and the others began to crack the ancient prohibition until the beasts attacked, Qin Sang had been nearby, but he couldn't find an opportunity to intervene, only watching helplessly as they completed their task and left.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't follow them, knowing there would be no chance to act later. He decided to give up.</p><p>From their earlier conversation, he’d heard Xiang Yi agree to help Cui Ji and the Fat Man retrieve treasures; the three wouldn't be separating anytime soon. Following them alone after they left the purple mist would be too risky.</p><p>Besides, Qin Sang had his own business to attend to and couldn't trail them indefinitely.</p><p>This didn't mean he was giving up on revenge. There would be plenty of time in the future, with the enemy in plain sight and him hidden, he would always find an opening.</p><p>Qin Sang stood at the foot of the ancient altar, unwilling to get too close.</p><p>Having just witnessed Lei Suo slaughtering the beasts, he was still shaken.</p><p>He hadn’t been able to see clearly what Xiang Yi had done, but he noticed the ancient altar's prohibition remained intact.  This surprised him.  He circled the altar, trying to understand, but found no clues.</p><p>Even if there were treasures, Xiang Yi must have taken them.</p><p>Knowing Lei Suo's power, Qin Sang didn't dare to easily touch the ancient prohibition on the altar. After hesitating for a moment, he decided to leave.</p><p>"Let's leave the other matters aside and go straight to the Sky Tower. There's still plenty of time. This time, I must at least find a clue to the ancient teleportation array, or even better, find it directly…"</p><p>Qin Sang mused to himself, about to summon his two-headed creature to quickly leave the Purple Mist Wasteland, when he sensed something and spun around sharply.</p><p>"Who's there!"</p><p>He stared intently at the purple mist, his heart pounding, his expression changing.</p><p>In the purple mist, a figure flickered, slowly approaching him. Qin Sang felt himself locked in the gaze of two eyes – a stranger!</p><p>Someone had been following him, and he hadn't noticed.</p><p>Qin Sang had only appeared after confirming Xiang Yi and the others had left. Could there have been a ninth person who entered the Purple Mist Wasteland?</p><p>Who was this person?</p><p>Had they been drawn by the thunder and lightning of Lei Suo, or had they been tracking them all along?</p><p>Was this a coincidence, or did they have a specific purpose?</p><p>Qin Sang's thoughts raced, his nerves tense. He felt himself locked in by a faint aura.  The other party seemed confident, strolling towards him without attempting a sneak attack.</p><p>Of course, in the purple mist, it would be difficult to launch a surprise attack without being detected, unless one used a tactic like Cui Ji's, attacking when his opponent was surrounded by beasts.</p><p>Qin Sang quickly summoned his two-headed creature, preparing for battle.</p><p>The figure became clearer and clearer, finally stopping before Qin Sang. It was a young man with a hooked nose and hawk-like eyes, sharp and piercing, scrutinizing Qin Sang.</p><p>Seeing this man, Qin Sang's heart sank.</p><p>This man's aura was even stronger than Xiang Yi's, likely a peak Nascent Soul Stage cultivator—the strongest opponent Qin Sang had encountered since his own breakthrough to the Nascent Soul stage!</p><p>"Who are you! What is the purpose of following me?"</p><p>Qin Sang took the initiative, questioning him sternly.</p><p>The poisonous mist of the Purple Mist Wasteland was extremely dangerous, considered one of the three most toxic places in the Seven Killing Hall. Few cultivators dared to enter.  Meeting someone else here in such a vast area was certainly no coincidence!</p><p>The young man glanced at Qin Sang and his two-headed creature, his expression seeming dismissive.  In fact, he was only a hair's breadth away from the Core Formation stage; his cultivation was indeed enough to look down upon Qin Sang.</p><p>"Are you from the Beichen League, from the Righteous or Demonic Paths, or a spy bought by the Witch Clan? A three-variant spirit insect is rare among our human race."</p><p>The young man asked a question that left Qin Sang baffled.</p><p>He noticed the young man was staring at his sleeve and immediately realized the other person knew about the fat silkworm. His heart tightened, and he quickly signaled the silkworm to hide.</p><p>The fat silkworm was his reliance for moving freely in the purple mist. If the silkworm were killed, he’d be completely helpless.</p><p>The Beichen League, the Righteous and Demonic Paths, the Witch Clan…</p><p>Whether it was carelessness or intentional, the young man had named almost all the major forces on the surface of the Canglang Sea Region, but deliberately omitted the Xi You League.</p><p>Qin Sang was puzzled, but his expression didn't change. He countered, "So, you're from the Xi You League?"</p><p>The young man neither admitted nor denied it, saying coldly, "You managed to infiltrate Xiang Yi's group and escape during the beast attack. Your strategy is impressive."</p><p>I’m curious which other forces are after the Dongji Alliance, and what secrets they know. Confess honestly, and I’ll let you keep your body intact. Your escape techniques are decent, but trying to shake me off is a fool’s errand.”</p><p>Qin Sang’s eyes flickered, picking up a clue from the young man’s words.</p><p>The young man seemed to have been following them all along.  None of the eight, including Qin Sang, had noticed anything unusual, demonstrating the man's extraordinary abilities.</p><p>He appeared to have also been affected by the beast attacks. He didn't know that Cui Ji had ambushed him, forcing him to separate from the group. He assumed Qin Sang had other motives and was seizing an opportunity to escape.</p><p>“I’ve heard that the three major merchant alliances are closely allied, sharing weal and woe. Given your strength, your position in the Xiyou Alliance must be quite significant, wouldn’t you say? Cui Ji carries the Alliance Leader’s orders, yet you secretly follow. If the Dongji Alliance Leader found out…”</p><p>Qin Sang sneered, trying to stall for time and extract more information.</p><p>The young man remained calm and composed, subtly observing Qin Sang.</p><p>The young man held a spiritual sword, but no artifacts like the Bone Lotus. Yet, he moved freely within the poisonous mist. Qin Sang noticed a faint, ethereal blue light around him, seemingly protecting him from the poison.</p><p>Initially, Qin Sang thought the blue light emanated from the young man's robes.</p><p>Upon closer inspection, he realized it came from a jade bracelet on his left wrist.</p><p>The bracelet was a poison-repelling treasure!</p><p>Using the Fire Pearl directly would likely kill him, but this is the Purple Mist Wasteland. Perhaps using such a powerful artifact isn't necessary.</p><p>Unlike Cui Ji, this man has never seen the power of the Blood-Soiled Divine Light, so he’s likely unprepared. There’s a good chance of success.</p><p>Disabling the bracelet, if he doesn't have a second anti-poison artifact, how much of his strength would remain?</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at the ancient divine altar and said gravely, “The treasure on the altar has already been taken by Xiang Yi. You dared not reveal yourself earlier, and now you don't pursue him. What good is killing me?”</p><p>“Treasure? So you don't know the altar's secret?”</p><p>The young man frowned, studying Qin Sang in surprise.</p><p>Qin Sang was startled. He hadn't clearly seen Xiang Yi's actions at the altar, and didn't know if Xiang Yi had taken anything.</p><p>The young man saw this, a mocking expression crossing his face. He sneered, “So you’re a useless fool who knows nothing. What use are you?”</p>
