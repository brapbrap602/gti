<h1>Chapter 450: Peak Revealed</h1><p>The gloomy waters of the Chaotic Isles were covered by countless streaks of light, like a meteor shower, converging towards Observer Island, a truly magnificent sight.</p><p>As Qin Sang expected, everyone had received the order, and cultivators throughout the Chaotic Isles were alerted.</p><p>The appearance of the red light signaled a major event.</p><p>“Junior Brother Qin, what happened?” Mu Yifeng approached, flying alongside Qin Sang, looking at the distant Observer Island teeming with figures, and asked with concern.</p><p>This was the first time Mu Yifeng had witnessed such a scene.</p><p>Three years ago, Mu Yifeng was severely injured, but a blessing in disguise allowed him to return to his sect to recover.</p><p>Not only did he avoid the most dangerous period, but he also gained a lot from that battle.  After three years of diligent cultivation at his sect, he made astonishing progress and was close to forming a nascent soul.</p><p>This time, dispatched to the Chaotic Isles, with his strength, he should have been able to lead a small team. Due to his unfamiliarity with the situation, he was assigned to Qin Sang's side to familiarize himself with the battlefield.</p><p>It was also Mu Yifeng's bad luck that, having just returned and only participated in one mission, this change occurred.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't explain it either and could only tell his team to be alert.</p><p>……</p><p>When Qin Sang arrived, hundreds of cultivators had already reached Observer Island, forming ranks in the air, with a continuous stream of cultivators still arriving.</p><p>Glancing around, Qin Sang saw his fellow Shao Hua Mountain disciples gathered together, and he led his team towards them.</p><p>These fellow disciples were at least acquaintances, and he had collaborated with some of them several times.</p><p>“Senior Brother Rong, Senior Brother Kong…”</p><p>Qin Sang greeted them one by one.</p><p>The others were also polite to Qin Sang and Mu Yifeng.</p><p>The person in the center was Senior Brother Rong, who had succeeded Qi Yuanshou in guarding Xuangul Pass. Now a nascent soul cultivator, his mastery of the Five Elements Spells was exceptional.  After being summoned to the Chaotic Isles, he made a name for himself on the battlefield.</p><p>His reputation even surpassed Qin Sang's.</p><p>Currently, among the Shao Hua Mountain Foundation Establishment disciples in the Chaotic Isles, Senior Brother Rong was the strongest.  Previously, it was Teng Zhaogang, but unfortunately, during the first year of the war, he fell into a trap set by the Heavenly Cycle Alliance. He nearly had his core destroyed and was critically injured.</p><p>Fortunately, Qin Sang and the others discovered him in time, rescued him, and sent him back to the sect for healing. It was said that his condition wasn't good. While his life was saved, forming a golden core might be impossible.</p><p>There were many experts who suffered similar fates as Senior Brother Teng.</p><p>It was their experiences that repeatedly warned Qin Sang never to let his guard down.</p><p>“Junior Brother Qin, Junior Brother Mu, you're finally here.”</p><p>Senior Brother Rong was also polite to Qin Sang. After greeting him, he couldn't help but ask, “There were no signs before, why suddenly… I heard Junior Brother Qin and Junior Brother Mu just went out, did you notice anything unusual about the Heavenly Cycle Alliance?”</p><p>Observer Island summoned everyone, but there had been no further instructions.</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head, looking left and right: “Everything outside was normal.  Is Junior Brother Zhan not here?”</p><p>Zhan Yi was Che Yutao's closed-door disciple and his most favored one. Che Yutao represented Shao Hua Mountain at Observer Island.  If there were any inside information, Zhan Yi would definitely be the first to know.</p><p>Senior Brother Rong said helplessly, “Junior Brother Zhan is elusive. Everyone is waiting for him!”</p><p>Speak of the devil.</p><p>Just as Qin Sang and Senior Brother Rong were discussing, Zhan Yi finally showed up.</p><p>Compared to three years ago, Zhan Yi's cultivation had deepened considerably. Many people lost their magical tools, were injured, or even lost their lives in the great war, but a few benefited greatly from this upheaval. Qin Sang and Zhan Yi were among them.</p><p>Surrounded and questioned by Qin Sang and the others, Zhan Yi was overwhelmed.  Finally, he waved his hand, casting a soundproof barrier.  He cautiously looked around and whispered, “Master and the others have already left… I heard Master say that it seems Sky Pointing Peak has appeared.”</p><p>“Sky Pointing Peak?”</p><p>Qin Sang was surprised and uncertain. He glanced at Mu Yifeng, who nodded slightly.</p><p>They certainly wouldn't forget.</p><p>Three years ago, Mu Yifeng followed Senior Fang and others to search for the so-called Sky Pointing Peak and was ambushed. That battle was the catalyst for the confrontation between the two sides in these waters.</p><p>However, since then, no one had mentioned Sky Pointing Peak again.</p><p>Those present were not fools.  The emergence of Sky Pointing Peak causing such a commotion, combined with the orders from Observer Island over the years, immediately made them realize that Sky Pointing Peak must be related to the spatial fluctuations!</p><p>“Has someone found the location of the spatial fluctuations?”</p><p>“What exactly is Sky Pointing Peak?”</p><p>“Why were we suddenly summoned?  Could it be that the Heavenly Cycle Alliance has also discovered it? Are we going to have another war over Sky Pointing Peak?”</p><p>……</p><p>Everyone continued to ask, but unfortunately, Zhan Yi didn't know much either. However, they already had a general idea.</p><p>“I wonder which fellow Daoist found the spatial fluctuation, they’ve struck it rich!”</p><p>A senior brother said enviously.</p><p>Looking at the expressions of the others, it was clear they agreed with him.</p><p>Observer Island had decreed a great reward for anyone who discovered the spatial fluctuations.</p><p>Observer Island represented the face of the major sects in the Small Cold Domain. How could they go back on their word?</p><p>Qin Sang estimated that if he had found the spatial fluctuation, asking for a magical tool as a reward might be unrealistic, but requesting a high-quality pill to aid in forming a golden core from Observer Island would definitely not be a problem.</p><p>The Small Cold Domain and the Heavenly Cycle Alliance combined had thousands of Foundation Establishment cultivators who had searched back and forth for three years, scouring this area countless times, practically turning the silt at the bottom of the waters upside down.</p><p>Qin Sang was equally ambitious, diligently searching, but always coming up empty-handed.</p><p>Unfortunately, someone else had beaten him to it…</p><p>Missed opportunities were missed opportunities; he could only say that the other person was blessed with great luck, and it was not something to be envious of.</p><p>No sooner said than done.</p><p>Cultivators’ speed was swift.  Before Qin Sang and the others could finish their conversation, all the cultivators in the Chaotic Isles had arrived.</p><p>Above Observer Island, the multicolored escaping lights intertwined, like a vast expanse of vibrant sunset clouds. Within, a dense mass of figures were all Foundation Establishment cultivators.</p><p>Such a scene was a once-in-a-lifetime sight for ordinary cultivators.</p><p>The battle formation, practiced beforehand, was relatively tight.</p><p>Shao Hua Mountain disciples were positioned on the left flank of the formation, surrounded by fellow righteous cultivators, while the demonic sects were on the right flank, still maintaining a state of non-aggression.</p><p>As soon as the formation was complete, a figure flew out from Observer Island. It was Vice-Island Master Xiao. The absence of other Golden Core cultivators led to murmurs among the crowd.</p><p>“Silence!”</p><p>Vice-Island Master Xiao's expression was displeased. He shouted, his gaze sweeping across the battle formation, his voice filled with killing intent: “Listen up, everyone!  If you encounter any Heavenly Cycle Alliance scoundrels, show no mercy, kill them on sight!”</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>After speaking, Vice-Island Master Xiao summoned his flying sword.  The sword light revolved around him as he turned and sped towards the outer fog.</p><p>Everyone silently followed.</p><p>In an instant, the sunset clouds formed by the escaping lights flowed like water towards the outer fog.  Passing through the fog and arriving outside the grand formation, they saw Vice-Island Master Xiao's sword continuing without pause, heading southeast.</p><p>Vice-Island Master Xiao was likely considering the lower-level disciples, as his speed wasn't too fast, allowing everyone to maintain the battle formation.</p><p>Not long after they flew out, exclamations erupted from the battle formation.</p><p>At the horizon, where the water met the sky.</p><p>Dark clouds obscured the moon, and lightning danced.</p>
