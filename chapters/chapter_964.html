<h1>Chapter 956: The Change in the Immortal Restriction</h1><p>Chapter 956: The Change in the Immortal Restriction</p><p>“A sword cultivator…”</p><p>Bai sighed softly, “Hearing you say that, that person's aura was indeed quite unique. He's quite the figure… I hope your feeling is right! So, you've believed his words and are preparing to go directly to Pure Yang Sect to find the Ning surname sword cultivator he mentioned?”</p><p>“I don’t know, I need to think carefully.”</p><p>Qin Sang fell silent for a moment, somewhat bewildered, “I can't think of any reason why Elder Qingzhu would plot against me. Do you know what Pure Yang Sect is?”</p><p>“Is it some dangerous place?”</p><p>Bai curiously asked.</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head, “It's not a dangerous place, but a sect! However, the Pure Yang Sect Elder Qingzhu referred to should not be a sect in the Canglang Sea, but the leading sect among the eight righteous sects in the Xiaohan Region's cultivation world.”</p><p>Bai, having a general understanding of the Canglang Sea's situation, suddenly realized, “You mean…”</p><p>“Exactly, Elder Qingzhu should be using Pure Yang Sect to refer to the Heavenly Dao Sect, the leader of the righteous sects in the Canglang Sea.  Heavenly Dao Sect's Sect Master, Lingzhuzi, is in the Seven Killing Hall.  Elder Qingzhu didn't seek help from Lingzhuzi, and deliberately concealed Heavenly Dao Sect in front of the demonic soul. I don't know why.”</p><p>Qin Sang frowned.</p><p>“Perhaps it wasn't unwillingness, but inability. He just tried to condense a crystal bead, presumably to transmit a message.  Even this much was impossible, the demonic soul would certainly try its best to prevent him from seeking help. Besides, didn't he say that he couldn't rely on outside help?”</p><p>Bai guessed, “The Ning surname sword cultivator might be Qingzhu's true successor. Qingzhu might have left some kind of contingency plan on this person, something that can help him recover.  Afraid of accidents, he didn't dare to expose this person, so he sheltered him under the Heavenly Dao Sect. When the time comes, you truthfully recount Qingzhu’s situation, the Ning surname sword cultivator will naturally have his own considerations.”</p><p>“Perhaps…”</p><p>Qin Sang remained silent.</p><p>He exited the sword path, cautiously observing before removing the shielding restriction and immediately darted down the mountain.</p><p>Along the way, Qin Sang looked back at the valley.</p><p>He found that several Golden Core cultivators who had been spying on the valley outside, now only dared to stand far away on another mountain fragment, not daring to approach the valley at all.</p><p>The fluctuations emanating from the valley were countless times more violent than before, black light surging, grinding countless rocks into dust. The power was terrifying, and Qin Sang felt a pang of fear.</p><p>“Could the Great Shaman actually break the ancient restriction in the valley?”</p><p>Qin Sang paused slightly, showing a surprised expression, “What is behind the valley?  It wouldn't be a path to the eighth level cliff, would it…?”</p><p>Qin Sang was startled by this thought.</p><p>Could it be that Qingzhu's demonic soul was guarding the eighth level, harboring some earth-shattering conspiracy?</p><p>The Wu tribe's Great Shaman, Lingzhuzi, the mysterious Elder Fang, and the Demon Lord before.</p><p>These were all the top-tier figures in the Canglang Sea. Even if Qingzhu's demonic soul was powerful, its cultivation was still inferior to these people, especially since he hadn't completely devoured Qingzhu's primordial spirit and his power was greatly affected.</p><p>The most frightening aspect of these people was the power they represented. Daring to plot against them was tantamount to making enemies of the whole world.</p><p>Qin Sang dared not think any further, turning his head and flying downwards, first escaping from the Sky Tower.</p><p>He shook his head, putting aside these distracting thoughts, recalling his brief contact with Elder Qingzhu, trying to sort out useful information.</p><p>“Elder Qingzhu said my current predicament is not unrelated to him. I fell from the Sky Tower, disappeared out of thin air, and ended up in the Western Frontier. Was it Elder Qingzhu who manipulated this?”</p><p>The more Qin Sang thought about it, the more he believed this was highly likely.</p><p>“But why did he do this? How did he do it? Moreover, Elder Qingzhu could see me, which means he's already found the ancient teleportation array. His feelings for his wife and daughter were so deep, why didn't he return to the Xiaohan Region to avenge his blood feud and reunite with his long-lost wife and daughter, but instead returned to Spirit Turtle Island? Did the backlash of his external avatar occur before the Seven Killing Hall appeared or when Spirit Turtle Island was destroyed?”</p><p>The more Qin Sang thought, the more headaches he had, utterly bewildered.</p><p>Various clues intertwined, a chaotic mess, impossible to unravel.</p><p>To understand the truth, he probably had to understand Elder Qingzhu's experiences.</p><p>Unfortunately, every time he tried to ask, he was stopped by Qingzhu.</p><p>The two things he most wanted to know, the location of the ancient teleportation array and the relationship between the Seven Killing Hall and the *Primordial Spirit Sword Cultivation Chapter*, remained unanswered.</p><p>He didn't know how much the Ning surname sword cultivator knew, whether he could answer his questions.</p><p>As for whether to leave the Seven Killing Hall and immediately go see that Ning surname sword cultivator, he was still undecided. After all, these were only Qingzhu's words, and a demonic soul was present.</p><p>Qin Sang's attention was drawn to Elder Qingzhu's final warning: the celestial barrier was changing, and the intervals between the appearances of the Seven Killing Hall might shorten; preparations should be made.</p><p>The appearances of the Purple Micro Palace and the Seven Killing Hall, while unpredictable, historically followed a relatively stable cycle, averaging around three hundred years.</p><p>However, the last appearance of the Purple Micro Palace was unusually early, occurring after only two hundred years.</p><p>This time might be even shorter.</p><p>“The celestial barrier is changing; how short will the interval be? Two hundred years, or less?”</p><p>Qin Sang mused, “The celestial barrier of the Seven Killing Hall typically experiences a low-tide period every seventy years or more. After the last time, the major factions in the Canglang Sea acted unusually, breaking through the barrier after only fifty years. Could this be due to changes in the celestial barrier, resulting in an earlier low-tide period?  More than a hundred years have passed since my arrival in the Canglang Sea. Perhaps next time, I won't need to use an array to break through the barrier; the Seven Killing Hall will appear on its own.  But if so, I'll have no time, and I will absolutely have to see Ning the sword cultivator first...”</p><p>“No! Was Elder Qingzhu's advice to prepare early a casual remark, or something more profound? My current strength shouldn't be much worse than Elder Qingzhu's upon their arrival, right? Legend has it that the dangers within the inner hall far exceed those of the outer hall, with even Nascent Soul cultivators perishing there. Could the location of the ancient teleportation array be a dangerous place, difficult to access?”</p><p>Qin Sang's expression changed.</p><p>With these thoughts in mind, Qin Sang traversed several teleportation arrays, quickly reaching the first level of the Sky Tower. Pausing briefly at the exit, he resolutely stepped out.</p><p>The area outside the Sky Tower was deserted; in the distance, fleeting lights occasionally flickered among the mountain shadows.</p><p>Qin Sang narrowed his eyes, glanced back at the Sky Tower, and looked up at its peak.</p><p>Knowing that the Sky Tower might undergo some change, he didn't dare linger. With a flash of light, he flew straight towards the mountain range behind the tower.</p><p>That was the path to the inner hall of the Seven Killing Hall.</p><p>The location of the Sky Tower was not far from the entrance to the inner hall of the Seven Killing Hall.</p><p>Soon, Qin Sang stood on a mountain peak, facing a chaotic scene.  The celestial barrier, manifested as swirling mists, filled the sky and earth, everywhere.</p><p>He couldn't see the inner hall, and even the powers of his Sky-Eyed Butterfly couldn't pierce the barrier.</p><p>He turned back to look at the Sky Tower, looking back and forth several times, muttering, “Teleported to the inner hall, yet I fell to the Sky Tower…”</p><p>The next moment, with another flash, Qin Sang vanished from the mountain peak.</p>
