<h1>Chapter 821: Fatal Flaw</h1><p>With each injury, the woman's power visibly weakened. Her strongest attacks were ineffective against Qin Sang, and now, no longer focused on killing, she only dodged his attacks.</p><p>But whenever Qin Sang tried to shake her off, she would burn her spectral body to keep pace, clinging to him like a leech, much to his annoyance.</p><p>Clearly, the woman was not a mindless wraith.</p><p>She was intelligent and understood Qin Sang's intentions. She had a keen grasp of the situation.</p><p>However, Qin Sang's efforts weren't entirely fruitless. During their exchange, he had been observing her closely. He didn't believe a Nascent Soul spectral body could be truly indestructible; he must have overlooked something.</p><p>As the woman's power waned, a peculiarity finally revealed itself.</p><p>The Sky-Eye Butterfly activated its Sky Eye.</p><p>It discovered that every time the woman's spectral body shattered, unusual fluctuations arose within.</p><p>At first, even with the Sky-Eye Butterfly's focused gaze, it could only discern a faint, fleeting glimmer within her, so brief that it seemed like an illusion.</p><p>As the woman weakened further, she could no longer completely conceal it.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The Ebony Sword pierced through her chest once more.</p><p>With the Sky-Eye Butterfly locked onto her, Qin Sang finally grasped the true nature of the glimmer.</p><p>To his astonishment, the light emanated from a tiny, transparent crystal, invisible to the naked eye.  Every time the woman was injured, the crystal would emit light.</p><p>And the crystal was constantly moving within her body.</p><p>"What is this? I've never heard of it before. Let's call it a Soul Crystal…"</p><p>Qin Sang mused silently, making conjectures. His understanding of Corpse-Ghost Dao wasn't shallow, but this was the first time he had encountered such a strange spectral body. It was truly worthy of being refined by a Nascent Soul cultivator.</p><p>Intuition told him that the Soul Crystal was of vital importance to the woman, possibly akin to a fatal flaw.</p><p>But shattering the Soul Crystal wouldn't be easy. It was hidden and constantly moving, only exposed when the woman was severely injured, and she would undoubtedly guard it fiercely.</p><p>Qin Sang's mind raced, a plan forming. After discovering the woman could burn her spectral body, he completely abandoned the idea of fleeing.</p><p>The woman had to die, and quickly.</p><p>With every passing moment, his situation grew more precarious.</p><p>Just then, the woman seemed to hear something, pausing briefly and turning towards the nearby sea.</p><p>At the same time, Qin Sang also heard the sound of approaching flight.</p><p>Looking towards the sound, a black dot appeared on the sea's surface. A cultivator was approaching on a sword, heading straight for the location of the Nascent Soul battle, clearly drawn by the unusual phenomena.</p><p>Initially, the frequent flashes of light on Liangqiu Island did resemble the signs of a treasure appearing.  It wasn't strange for those who saw the phenomenon to think so.</p><p>As Qin Sang left the island, he had noticed cultivators on nearby islands stirring.</p><p>Lured by the prospect of treasure, they were coming to try their luck, even after the earth-shattering battle.</p><p>The woman let out a strange laugh and vanished, abandoning her pursuit of Qin Sang for the first time, rushing towards the approaching cultivator.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression changed slightly.  He had a bad feeling. He tried to intervene, but it was too late. Soon, a scream echoed, and the approaching light vanished.</p><p>When Qin Sang arrived, he saw the cultivator's body rapidly withering, a look of terror still etched on his face. The woman had devoured all his blood, flesh, and vital essence, leaving behind a desiccated corpse.</p><p>Men die for wealth, birds die for food. Such is life.</p><p>The woman leaped from the corpse, licking her lips with a look of satisfaction. Her spectral body had become noticeably more solid!</p><p>"She can devour flesh and blood to restore herself."</p><p>Qin Sang's expression darkened.</p><p>There were many cultivators around Quheng Island. If he delayed any longer, more people would be attracted, and if the woman found enough sustenance, his efforts would be wasted.</p><p>"Damned fiend!"</p><p>Qin Sang cursed, launching a thunderous, merciless attack.</p><p>The woman changed her tactics, completely avoiding direct confrontation with Qin Sang and resorting to evasive maneuvers. The Nine Nether Demonic Fire, despite its impressive display, repeatedly missed its mark, leaving Qin Sang frustrated.</p><p>Unable to kill her, unable to shake her off.</p><p>The woman laughed maniacally, her eyes gleaming with a strange light, as if already savoring the delicious meal Qin Sang would make.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The Nine Nether Demonic Fire missed again, but this time was different. As they passed each other, the flames suddenly exploded.</p><p>The woman cried out in pain and retreated rapidly.  Immediately afterward, sword lights converged, thrusting upwards from below.  The woman didn't panic. She dodged repeatedly, and seeing she couldn't avoid them all, she twisted her body, evading several sword lights, but one pierced her.</p><p>The woman's spectral body was damaged, then healed as she continued to evade.</p><p>In the Sky-Eye Butterfly's vision, light emanated from within her, flowing towards the wound, and the Soul Crystal's trajectory became visible near her chest.</p><p>Now!</p><p>Qin Sang had been waiting for this moment.  He cried out inwardly, "Go!"</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>A point of blue light emerged from Qin Sang's dantian, tracing a beautiful arc.</p><p>The Star Snail!</p><p>Since obtaining this treasure, it had been refining true essence within his dantian, reaching its peak power, but it had yet to see action.</p><p>The Star Snail had only one chance, a treasure that could decide the outcome.</p><p>Qin Sang would only use it when he was certain of its effectiveness.</p><p>The same treasure.</p><p>Qin Sang's role was reversed; he was now the one wielding the treasure, and the target was the woman.</p><p>The blue light emitted by the Star Snail arrived in an instant, appearing before her.  The smile vanished from the woman's face, replaced by terror. It wasn't just the Star Snail's astonishing power that frightened her, but its target - her precious Soul Crystal.</p><p>‘Ah…’</p><p>The woman screamed in despair.</p><p>A pale light erupted from her spectral body, rapidly converging towards the Soul Crystal, forming layers of protective barriers.</p><p>The Star Snail struck.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The pale light and the blue light clashed, canceling each other out, but ultimately, the blue light prevailed.</p><p>The barrier shattered.</p><p>The Soul Crystal was completely exposed to the Star Snail.</p><p>The woman looked down at her chest in disbelief, watching helplessly as her Soul Crystal was shattered.  The light in her eyes faded completely.</p><p>The Star Snail passed through the woman's chest, revealing its form.</p><p>This time, the woman's spectral body could not recover. Cracks spread rapidly from her chest throughout her entire form, shattering completely, dissipating in the night wind.</p><p>Qin Sang flashed forward, sweeping the area with the Nine Nether Demonic Fire.  Confirming the woman was truly dead, with no chance of revival and nothing left behind, he finally breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p>The woman wasn't the most dangerous opponent he had faced, but she was certainly the most difficult.  He had used all his treasures and the Sky-Eye Butterfly's assistance to finally destroy her.</p><p>Qin Sang felt utterly exhausted, but it wasn't time to rest yet.</p><p>He retrieved his treasures and looked towards the distance.</p><p>There, a thick yellow beam of light shone in the night sky, unchanging for a long time. This indicated the situation had likely stabilized, and the Nascent Soul cultivator backing Luo Daotong had probably suffered a heavy blow.</p><p>Once those people succeeded, their next target would be him.  Fortunately, he had eliminated the woman.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't dare linger.  He swallowed a few spirit pills and fled.</p>
