<h1>Chapter 490: The Gatekeeper</h1><p>Chapter 490: The Gatekeeper</p><p>The spirit array within the Peach Blossom Poison has countless variations, but it's not difficult to break if you understand the patterns.</p><p>However, Qin Sang didn't act recklessly. He cautiously approached the center of the Peach Blossom Poison, wary of any traps left by Jiupao Daoist that might expose his presence.</p><p>Entering the Peach Blossom Poison, Qin Sang felt as if the peach trees were clawing and snarling, far from their outwardly beautiful appearance. They resembled malevolent spirits, vicious trees entirely different from the Red Jade Peaches of Shaohua Mountain.</p><p>The buildings within the Peach Blossom Poison became clearer—a simple, square stone hut, devoid of any luxury.</p><p>The moment he saw the stone hut, Qin Sang abruptly stopped. He pushed his *Duan Ling Jue* to its limit, flashing behind a peach tree, and frowned.</p><p>A person was sitting before the hut's entrance.</p><p>This man, around fifty years old, wore a grey robe embroidered with black flames at the hem.  He sat cross-legged, his back to the hut, eyes closed, breathing steadily.</p><p>He likely didn't expect anyone to sneak in and showed no concealment, his False Core cultivation evident.</p><p>"It's him?"</p><p>Recognizing the man's face, Qin Sang immediately recalled his identity: Mo Yan, one of the Four Demon Flames of the Demon Flame Sect, a remnant of the Kuiyin Sect, whose real name was Huang Shizhong.</p><p>Qin Sang had now encountered all four Demon Flame Envoys under Jiupao Daoist, two of whom had fallen to him.</p><p>He had captured another in the Turbulent Island waters, but this one was only at the late Foundation Establishment stage. Qin Sang didn't want to waste a precious Sky Corpse Talisman on him, so after capturing Huang Jiaren, he killed him and made him into a corpse puppet.</p><p>Huang Shizhong's presence in the Peach Blossom Poison, sitting motionless before the hut, wasn't for cultivation; he was guarding.</p><p>Only Jiupao Daoist within the Demon Flame Sect merited such vigilant protection!</p><p>It seemed Jiupao Daoist was inside.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression shifted. He had come to the right place!</p><p>His gaze moved past Huang Shizhong to the hut behind him. The hut's door was shut, and the stone door was etched with runes, with the glow of a restriction flickering.</p><p>He couldn't discern the hut's interior through the restriction.</p><p>Qin Sang examined the hut's restriction closely, realizing it was quite intricate. While it would take him some effort to break, it posed no significant challenge to the Flying Night Rakshasa.</p><p>Where was Ji Wu?</p><p>Qin Sang scanned his surroundings, finding no one else.</p><p>With only two of the Four Demon Flame Envoys left, and Huang Shizhong guarding the gate, Ji Wu couldn't be absent; his status was higher than Huang Shizhong's.</p><p>Jiupao Daoist highly valued Ji Wu, grooming him as his successor. Qin Sang had learned from the captured Demon Flame Envoy that Ji Wu was even more favored than Yin Yan.</p><p>Could Ji Wu be inside the hut?</p><p>Qin Sang waited behind the tree for an hour, but Ji Wu remained unseen, and the hut was silent.</p><p>He couldn't wait any longer!</p><p>Qin Sang thought, Jiupao Daoist might be at a critical juncture. The longer he waited, the more unpredictable things would become.  He had to act immediately.</p><p>To kill Jiupao Daoist, he first had to deal with Huang Shizhong. Otherwise, against a Nascent Soul Jiupao Daoist and two False Core experts, he would only be able to flee for his life.</p><p>Qin Sang looked away, lost in thought. Jiupao Daoist was the primary target, so he didn't want any complications and had no intention of capturing Huang Shizhong alive.</p><p>He pondered how to swiftly eliminate Huang Shizhong before Jiupao Daoist noticed, a decisive strike against one opponent.</p><p>Ideally, he would kill Huang Shizhong without alarming Jiupao Daoist.</p><p>A plan formed in his mind.</p><p>…</p><p>Huang Shizhong sat still as a statue.</p><p>The Peach Blossom Poison was highly toxic. Birds and beasts dared not enter the valley, and even the surrounding ten miles were a lifeless zone.</p><p>Because of this, it was exceptionally quiet, any slight sound easily detected by Huang Shizhong.</p><p>Suddenly, Huang Shizhong seemed to hear something. His ears twitched, and he abruptly opened his eyes, staring intently at a nearby peach tree.</p><p>He saw a branch trembling slightly, as if disturbed by the wind, with a few peach blossoms gently falling.</p><p>Was it his imagination?</p><p>A hint of doubt clouded Huang Shizhong's eyes.  Besides the petals, he saw nothing unusual, including the spirit array within the Peach Blossom Poison; everything seemed normal.</p><p>He shook his head slightly, his mind relaxing for a moment.  Just as he was about to close his eyes again, he felt a strong gust of wind from his left, his expression instantly changing!</p><p>He caught a glimpse of a black figure from the corner of his eye; its speed was astonishing, and it was upon him in an instant.</p><p>Someone!</p><p>Huang Shizhong was shocked. His earlier feeling wasn't a mistake; there was an intruder.</p><p>The attacker had silently slipped past the protective array and the poisonous miasma, approaching him undetected until they were almost upon him!</p><p>Huang Shizhong, experienced as he was, reacted swiftly despite his shock. Instead of fleeing, he instantly twisted his upper body, facing his attacker, clenching his fists, ready to counterattack.</p><p>Seeing the masked Flying Night Rakshasa, Huang Shizhong's heart sank.  The Rakshasa's power was terrifying, leaving Huang Shizhong stunned and realizing he was no match. He opened his mouth to call for help from Jiupao Daoist.</p><p>“Heh heh…”</p><p>Huang Shizhong's mouth opened, but he suddenly felt a chill in his chest, his body went limp, unable to make a sound. A searing pain gripped his throat as a ghostly claw clamped around his neck.</p><p>He managed to lower his head, seeing through the claw a jade-green sword tip protruding from his chest. He'd been focused on the Rakshasa's attack, unaware of another enemy lurking in the shadows, wielding such a deadly flying sword.</p><p>His robes had been pierced with ease.</p><p>Chaotic sword energy surged into Huang Shizhong's body, wreaking havoc, draining not only his strength but his life. The light in Huang Shizhong's eyes rapidly faded.</p><p>He died instantly.</p><p>At that moment, Qin Sang, also masked, appeared beside Huang Shizhong, ordering the Flying Night Rakshasa to stop.  He gently touched Huang Shizhong's corpse.</p><p>The assassination, seemingly simple, was actually incredibly demanding, each moment requiring precise control to prevent Huang Shizhong from calling for help.</p><p>Qin Sang pressed down on Huang Shizhong's wound to prevent the blood from spreading, thinking,  "To die at the hands of the Flying Night Rakshasa and a magical weapon… a fitting end."</p><p>He tossed Huang Shizhong's body into a corpse bag. Qin Sang and the Flying Night Rakshasa stood side-by-side, watching the stone hut's entrance.</p><p>Huang Shizhong was dead.</p><p>The stone hut remained silent, Jiupao Daoist seemingly unaware of anything.</p><p>Regardless of Jiupao Daoist's intentions, Qin Sang, having gone this far, had no way back. He ordered the Flying Night Rakshasa forward, quickly producing the Ten Directions Yama Banner and raising the ten ghostly banners.</p><p>The formation was complete. Qin Sang glanced at the Flying Night Rakshasa.</p>
