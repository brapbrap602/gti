<h1>Chapter 1167:  Earlier Than Expected Again</h1><p>Chapter 1167:  Earlier Than Expected Again</p><p>The Feather Demon King, still imposing, showed little outward fluctuation yet radiated authority.  Scrying techniques were unusable in this location.  But facing him, Qin Sang felt a subtle pressure, instantly growing alert.  Legend had it that the Feather Demon King was mid-stage Transformation, slightly weaker than the Red-haired Ancestor and Zhenyi Daoist in their prime.  Years had passed since the Feather Demon King last made a significant move; his current strength was anyone's guess. The accumulated resources left by past Feather Demon Kings were immense; his true power undoubtedly surpassed appearances.  Qin Sang showed no disrespect towards this regional overlord.</p><p>"Greetings, Feather King."</p><p>The Red-tailed Demon King bowed, and Qin Sang followed suit.</p><p>"Please, have a seat, esteemed guests,"</p><p>The Feather Demon King gestured, his gaze falling upon Qin Sang with a smile. "This Daoist friend seems unfamiliar.  You must be the Mingyue Daoist Li Hong mentioned?"</p><p>"My Daoist name is Mingyue.  I hope for your guidance, Feather King, and all esteemed Daoist friends," Qin Sang nodded, bowing to the assembled Demon Kings in greeting.</p><p>Upon entering, Qin Sang felt probing gazes assessing him, though no overt hostility.  Clearly, Yun Youzi had maintained decent relationships.</p><p>Those present were all Transformation stage Great Demons, each returning his bow.  However, not all were fully humanoid. Some, like the Red-tailed Demon King, retained their most striking features. Others, despite their Transformation cultivation, hadn't fully transformed due to bloodline limitations.</p><p>In short, the Demon Kings were a motley crew of bizarre appearances. Qin Sang, having carefully inquired with the Red-tailed Demon King, could largely identify them.</p><p>The Qieji Demon King was absent.  However, Qin Sang noted a half-human, half-snake demon seated beside the Feather Demon King.  This demon's title was simple: Snake King.  That spoke volumes.  The Snake King's prestige and power were second only to the Feather Demon King, having recently broken through to the mid-Transformation stage.  Yet, rumor had it he was exceptionally smooth, never openly opposing the Feather Demon King.  He also held another notable identity: the father-in-law of the Qieji Demon King.</p><p>Qin Sang sat beside the Red-tailed Demon King.  His gaze accidentally met the Snake King's, who smiled and nodded, seemingly unaware of the thief who had infiltrated his son-in-law's abode.</p><p>Once seated, the Feather Demon King nodded slightly. "Most of the Daoist friends invited to this council have arrived. Let's proceed with the matter at hand."</p><p>The Demon Kings straightened.</p><p>The Feather Demon King paused, then stated directly, "This gathering concerns several key issues.  Firstly, the matter of Ziwei Palace, which is of paramount interest to all of you.  The timing of its appearances has become increasingly erratic. For years, we and the human cultivators have closely monitored the changes deep within the Ancient Immortal Battlefield. Recently, we discovered an anomaly."</p><p>"What anomaly?  There's still no spiritual tide in the Ancient Immortal Battlefield, is there?"</p><p>A powerfully built man, impatient, boomed the question.  He called himself the Black Wind Demon King, a transformed black bear, his face still bearing short, coarse black fur.  He looked remarkably bear-like.</p><p>The Feather Demon King, unperturbed by the interruption, explained, "While the Ancient Immortal Battlefield lacks a spiritual tide, I and a human Nascent Soul cultivator recently made a journey there and discovered unusual fluctuations in the Ziwei Palace's protective array."</p><p>The Demon Kings immediately grasped his meaning. Array fluctuations were a precursor to Ziwei Palace's emergence.</p><p>The Red-tailed Demon King interjected, "The intervals between Ziwei Palace's appearances are shortening.  The last time was only a century ago.  Could it be even sooner this time, perhaps within the next few years?"</p><p>"I imagine you all share Red-tail's apprehension. However, it likely won't be that soon…"</p><p>The Feather Demon King shook his head.  "There's still no sign of a spiritual tide; we must wait. However, it will certainly appear earlier than expected. I predict the interval, even if longer than before, will not exceed a century, and is likely shorter."</p><p>Upon hearing this, the Demon Kings exchanged glances.</p><p>A female demon sighed, "If shorter, fifty years? Seventy?  It's been around forty years since the last appearance.  Time is running out."</p><p>"At this rate, Ziwei Palace's appearances will become increasingly frequent.  Will it eventually be left completely exposed, allowing us free access to its treasures?"</p><p>A Demon King's voice held a hint of excitement. The possibility thrilled not only him, but all present.</p><p>The Purple Microcosm Palace is undoubtedly a treasure trove, concealing countless ancient secrets.  Many powerful cultivators have ventured inside over the years, but their stays have always been brief.  Numerous ancient formations and restrictions, while not insurmountable, have proved too time-consuming to fully decipher.  To date, they've only explored a tiny fraction of the Palace.</p><p>Especially the inner sanctum!  The Seal Chamber, the ancient medicinal gardens, Mount Heaven… each location is incredibly mysterious and captivating.  All signs suggest the Purple Microcosm Palace transcends the Yuan Ying stage; even a partial understanding would be beyond the wildest dreams of any demon king present.</p><p>Qin Sang listened silently, his mind elsewhere.  He was contemplating something else entirely.  The Purple Microcosm Palace connects to the Cang Lang Sea and even the Demon Sea. If access to the Palace were to become unrestricted, control of this unique passageway would rest with him – a prospect of immense benefit, clearly visible to all.  How to monetize this advantage without becoming a target required careful consideration.</p><p>"Let's not get ahead of ourselves," a female demon interjected, pouring cold water on their enthusiasm. "Unusual occurrences aren't always positive. What if this change is due to the Palace's formations failing, nearing collapse?"</p><p>"If the Palace self-destructs, that's one thing; we'd simply lose a treasure-hunting ground.  After so many explorations, the easily obtainable treasures are long gone. But the Palace is intricately linked to the Spirit Tide.  If it impacts the entire Ancient Immortal Battlefield, or even the outer barrier, imagine the consequences," she continued, the hall falling silent.</p><p>They understood the possibility of self-destruction.  The cracks in the inner sanctum's formations were clear evidence.  This barrier protects countless beings in the Northern Star Realm. If it's breached, it's uncertain how much of the realm would remain habitable. While some might relocate to the other three realms, most creatures would struggle to survive.</p><p>"My friend, perhaps you're exaggerating," Redtail Demon King broke the silence, turning to Qin Sang. "明月道友 (Mingyue Dao You), what's your opinion?"</p><p>Qin Sang nodded in agreement.  He reminded himself not to be blinded by ambition. Only by strengthening himself could he secure what was rightfully his.</p><p>******</p>
