<h1>Chapter 358:  Longevity</h1><p>“Sir, are you here to offer incense or for treatment…?”</p><p>A young boy, perhaps twelve or thirteen, likely the younger Daoist’s apprentice or assistant, was helping a woman whose leg was broken. He hurried over, his eyes widening in shock upon seeing Qin Sang’s face.</p><p>His eyes went wide, his face filled with astonishment.</p><p>Qin Sang’s heart stirred.  “Young Daoist, do you know me?”</p><p>“Mas…Master…”</p><p>The boy suddenly turned and urgently called out to the younger Daoist.</p><p>The shout drew the attention of everyone in the Qingyang Hall.</p><p>All eyes fell on Qin Sang with suspicion.</p><p>Qin Sang spread his hands innocently, indicating his innocence, that he had not bullied a child.</p><p>“What’s all the commotion? Have you forgotten the ‘Classic of Tranquility’?” The younger Daoist, who had been taking an old man’s pulse, looked over disapprovingly and reprimanded him.</p><p>“Master…he…he is…”</p><p>The boy pointed at Qin Sang, his face flushed, unable to speak coherently.</p><p>The younger Daoist frowned slightly, following the boy’s finger to Qin Sang. His expression then suddenly changed, a look of surprise and uncertainty appearing on his face.</p><p>“Old sir, please wait a moment…”</p><p>Hesitating for a moment, the younger Daoist got up, hurried to Qin Sang, bowed slightly, and tentatively asked, “I am Li Yu Fu, may I ask your name, sir?”</p><p>“My surname is Qin…”</p><p>Seeing their reaction, Qin Sang guessed something and no longer concealed it, asking, “What is your relationship with Mingyue?”</p><p>Qin Sang's question shocked Li Yu Fu.  His voice was filled with disbelief.  “Daoist Mingyue was my master.  Could you be… Master Qin?”</p><p>“My master?”</p><p>Qin Sang’s heart sank, his voice slightly hoarse. “Mingyue…he…”</p><p>Li Yu Fu nodded solemnly.</p><p>“Ah…”</p><p>Qin Sang let out a long sigh, noticing that the patients in the hall were all staring at them curiously, wondering why the Qingyang Temple’s master had such a young uncle.</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head and said to Li Yu Fu, “Go back to your work. We can talk later.”</p><p>“Yes, Master!”</p><p>Li Yu Fu obeyed Qin Sang immediately, returning to his patients but clearly distracted. Suddenly remembering something, he asked Qin Sang, “Master Qin, more people will be seeking medical attention soon, it might take several hours. Perhaps Jingtian could take you to the inner hall to rest?”</p><p>“Very well!”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded and followed the young boy into the inner hall of the Qingyang Temple.  Noticing the boy’s nervousness, he asked, “Is your name Jingtian?”</p><p>The boy nodded, nervously replying, “Reporting to Great-uncle Master, Master found me when it was the height of summer and night, fireflies dancing in the sky, so he gave me the Daoist name, Jingtian.”</p><p>Qin Sang said “Oh,” and then asked, “Where are the memorial tablets of Daoist Jixin and Mingyue?”</p><p>“In the Ancestor Hall…”</p><p>The so-called Ancestor Hall was quite simple, with three memorial tablets.</p><p>Yunyouzi, Jixin, and Mingyue.</p><p>The Qingyang Temple lineage started with Yunyouzi, a self-taught Daoist priest without a master, hence only a few names, appearing quite sparse.</p><p>Qin Sang sent Jingtian to help, took down Yunyouzi’s tablet, took incense sticks nearby, lit one for Jixin and one for Mingyue, and bowed.</p><p>“You’ve all gone…”</p><p>Qin Sang murmured almost inaudibly.</p><p>He sat cross-legged on the cushion, lost in thought, memories flooding back.  His time at Qingyang Temple, after arriving in this world, was the most impoverished, yet also the happiest period of his life.</p><p>Carefree and free.</p><p>Of the three ‘Daoists’ of Qingyang Temple, only he remained.</p><p>Daoist Jixin was a mortal, if still alive he would be well over a hundred years old. Qin Sang had expected this, but Mingyue's passing was so sudden.</p><p>Next to the three memorial tablets was a wooden box. Qin Sang found his own portrait inside, inscribed by Mingyue.</p><p>Unfolding the portrait, Qin Sang smiled fondly.</p><p>In the painting, his Daoist robe was wrinkled and dusty, his hands gripping stones, his eyes intently focused on a flock of birds in the air, poised as if ready to strike one down for a meal.</p><p>The portrait was remarkably lifelike, no wonder Li Yu Fu and his apprentice recognized him instantly.</p><p>…</p><p>The sun gradually climbed to its zenith.</p><p>Jingtian came in to ask Qin Sang what he would like for lunch.</p><p>“A bowl of congee,” Qin Sang said.</p><p>…</p><p>By evening, Li Yu Fu had finished seeing patients and hurried over.  “I apologize for the delay, Master Qin.”</p><p>Qin Sang looked at him with an amused expression. “Who told you to call me Master?”</p><p>Li Yu Fu was taken aback. He exclaimed, “Master instructed me to.”</p><p>Qin Sang chuckled and shook his head.  He’d never formally apprenticed under Jixin Daozhang.  The Daozhang probably saw his lack of commitment and never offered.</p><p>The whole "senior brother" thing was just a ploy to impress Mingyue and gain an advantage.  He hadn't expected Qin Sang to remember.</p><p>"If he's my senior master," Qin Sang asked, "why isn't my memorial tablet there?"</p><p>Li Yufu quickly replied, "Master said you went to seek immortality, that you'd surely achieve it and live forever. He said to simply remember you in our hearts..."</p><p>Qin Sang grunted in acknowledgement.  It seemed his faked death hadn't fooled Jixin Daozhang.</p><p>He then recounted his journey, asking, "...later, I came to Cuiming Mountain, only to learn that Daozhang and Mingyue had left. I sent people to search across many countries, but couldn't find them. Where were they, and when did they return?"</p><p>Li Yufu explained:</p><p>"After leaving Cuiming Mountain, Master and Grandmaster travelled south along the Jiang River, journeying through various countries, healing the sick and saving lives.  They finally settled in Chen, at the end of the Wu Ling River.</p><p>"A terrible plague was sweeping Chen at the time.  They risked their lives to treat the afflicted, even contracting the illness themselves, until they found a cure.  They saved countless lives.</p><p>"The people of Chen are eternally grateful. They built a shrine to them, still venerated to this day.</p><p>"I'm from Chen.  I lost my parents as a baby and was taken in by Master.</p><p>"When Master grew old, he longed for home and brought me back to Cuiming Mountain to revive the Qingyang Temple..."</p><p>Li Yufu spoke eloquently, and Qin Sang listened intently.  No wonder he couldn't find them – Chen was so far away, at the end of the Wu Ling River.</p><p>Li Yufu's voice was filled with pride when he spoke of the shrine.  Qin Sang deeply admired Jixin Daozhang and Mingyue’s compassion and perseverance. They never forgot their commitment.  The shrine was a testament to their deeds.</p><p>He mused that, as long as the shrine stood and offerings continued, Jixin Daozhang and Mingyue would gradually become deities in the hearts of the people, forever remembered.</p><p>Was this not a form of immortality?</p>
