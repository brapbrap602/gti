<h1>Chapter 1881: Breaking the Army</h1><p>The Divine Inspection Chariot, inspecting the gods!</p><p>Having had his origins revealed by Master Tianyue, the golden dragon seemed to sense something and let out an excited roar.</p><p>The sound shook the Divine Court!</p><p>However, no matter how earth-shattering the dragon's roar was, it couldn't compare to the shock that Master Tianyue's words brought to Qin Sang.</p><p>Master Tianyue!</p><p>Helping me achieve Void Refinement?</p><p>Qin Sang could hardly contain his astonishment.</p><p>Judging by Master Tianyue's tone, he had long seen through Qin Sang's identity and origins.</p><p>Since when had he been exposed?</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't judge Master Tianyue's cultivation level from a mere phantom, but it was definitely not mid-Transformation God stage.</p><p>He didn't feel this unfathomable aura when facing Left Realperson.</p><p>He had a premonition that Master Tianyue's strength might exceed his imagination!</p><p>If Master Tianyue had arrived in this world earlier and encountered him by chance, judging his cultivation methods and Taoist techniques to determine that he also came from Beichen Realm in the Storm World, why did he say he was acting on someone's behalf?</p><p>Who was that person?</p><p>Their initial encounter in Star Valley, their reunion in Guifang, were they all carefully orchestrated ambushes?</p><p>What was their purpose?</p><p>Why did Master Tianyue approach him in this way?</p><p>Hua Ling, the *Poison God Codex*, the King Kong fruit…</p><p>Li Hou, the Qinghu Saint King, and even Ling You Wang, who had self-destructed his cultivation.</p><p>Those rare opportunities, those perfectly timed opponents, made his cultivation and understanding of the Dao of Killing incredibly smooth; it was as if he had a pillow for every nap.</p><p>How much of it was custom-made for him?</p><p>Perhaps there was no King Kong Bodhi tree in the Jusan Temple at all; it was just a way to lure him out of the cave and face the crisis.</p><p>Beichen Realm had King Kong fruits; Master Tianyue must have been to the Ziwei Palace. With his strength, obtaining a few King Kong fruits wouldn't be strange.</p><p>But how did he know that Qin Sang would risk obtaining the King Kong fruit?</p><p>No wonder the Dao Court had always made things easy for him.</p><p>Magical techniques, spiritual materials, refining techniques—as long as he had a suitable reason, they never made things difficult, granting him whatever he asked for.</p><p>How many of the Realpersons he had befriended knew the truth and had been cooperating with him all along?</p><p>During this period, how many people unknowingly became pawns of powerful beings!</p><p>It was laughable that he thought he had been hiding so well.</p><p>Qin Sang felt a chill run down his spine.</p><p>Too many questions bombarded his mind; Qin Sang's feeling now was not one of honor but of terror!</p><p>The only comfort was that Master Tianyue hadn't harmed him before, and had even guided him in the Dao of the Sword several times.</p><p>With Master Tianyue's strength, if he wanted to harm him, he wouldn't have gone to such lengths.</p><p>Qin Sang opened his mouth, but saw Master Tianyue's expression change slightly. He glanced towards the depths of the cloud sea, then shifted his gaze back to Qin Sang's divine chariot, saying solemnly, "I'll transmit you a seal; control the chariot as quickly as possible!  I and the two Realpersons cannot all attend to you. Within the Divine Court, relying on the chariot, you should be able to hold your own against those demon kings for a while…"</p><p>Before he finished, Master Tianyue's phantom gradually faded, leaving behind an unusually complex seal.</p><p>"Senior…"</p><p>Qin Sang's words trailed off; before him was emptiness. Seeing the seal dissipating, he quickly focused on memorizing it.</p><p>For a time, Qin Sang was utterly bewildered, unable to make heads or tails of it.</p><p>What were Master Tianyue and the Realpersons doing? Shouldn't they be coming in quickly? Why did he have to hold his own against the demon kings?</p><p>At this time, Qin Sang noticed that the surrounding clouds and scenery were rapidly receding, realizing that the golden dragon hadn't stopped running.</p><p>The golden dragon pulled the Taiyi Star Chariot through the cloud sea; clearly, something was drawing the golden dragon deeper into the Divine Court.</p><p>Where were the demon kings?</p><p>Master Tianyue's warning still echoed in his ears; Qin Sang didn't dare to be careless, looking towards the direction Master Tianyue had looked.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't know what that cloud sea was, but even with his full Heavenly Eye Divine Ability, he could only see a deep void.</p><p>Initially, nothing seemed amiss.</p><p>Suddenly, the cloud sea surged, the clouds billowing, forming a massive cloud tide.</p><p>Amidst the churning clouds, pillars of energy suddenly shot out, as if coming from outside the heavens, bursting into the Divine Court.  They were of various colors, multicolored—blue, red, black…</p><p>Even from here, Qin Sang could sense the terrifying demonic energy emanating from those pillars!</p><p>Among them was the aura of demon kings, far surpassing that of a self-destructed demon king like Ling You Wang.</p><p>Demons had entered the Divine Court first, and there were demon kings at their full strength!</p><p>Qin Sang felt the gaze from that direction, a sudden shock, finally realizing how perilous his current situation was.</p><p>'Roar!'</p><p>The dragon's roar became more and more excited.</p><p>Qin Sang immersed all his attention in the Divine Inspection Chariot.</p><p>He could sense the golden dragon's 'emotions,' still unable to communicate, but it was no longer as resistant to him as it had been outside the Divine Court.</p><p>The seal appeared in his mind; Qin Sang didn't hesitate, doing his best to comprehend it.</p><p>…</p><p>Guifang.</p><p>The Great Saint's Mansion.</p><p>This place is one of the four subordinate regions of the Daoist Court, specifically the Gōngshān sub-prefecture's altar.  The altar is filled with golden palaces, a magnificent sight, devoid of any foul aura.</p><p>Judging from appearances alone, it's hard to believe this place is occupied by demons.</p><p>The true location of the Great Sage's abode is actually a stone cave atop a celestial mountain.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The mountain crumbled and split apart.  A terrifying force erupted from within the mountain in a tremendous roar, causing the mountain to collapse, sending countless boulders flying.</p><p>The next moment, the mountainside above the halfway point was completely destroyed, revealing a high altar and numerous figures.</p><p>A man in dragon robes and an imperial crown stood up.  The surrounding figures also noticed the lunar anomaly, rising one by one to gaze at the night sky, their expressions uncertain.</p><p>"The Divine Court?"</p><p>The man in dragon robes was the demon Great Sage.</p><p>A look of surprise also flashed in his eyes.</p><p>He was the mastermind behind the scheme to acquire the fragments of the Twenty-Four Celestial Prisons, and he knew perfectly well that the South Heavenly Gate in the Gōngshān altar was a fake.</p><p>The real Divine Court had actually appeared, on the moon, a place visible to everyone every night!</p><p>The demon Great Sage turned his gaze westward.  Even now, the Daoist Court showed no unusual activity.</p><p>"Could it truly be an accident?  Was the Daoist Court also caught off guard?"</p><p>This thought crossed the demon Great Sage's mind, but it didn't fill him with excitement.  He knew only too well the consequences of the Divine Court's sudden appearance.</p><p>Furthermore, a feeling of unease gnawed at him; things might not be as simple as they seemed!</p><p>The Daoist Court's True Monarch's continued inaction only heightened this unease.</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>The demon Great Sage shifted his gaze to the fragments of the Twenty-Four Celestial Prisons, his eyes gleaming.</p><p>"Where are the Demon Gods!"</p><p>His roar echoed throughout the Great Sage's mansion.</p><p>Figures rose from the foot of the mountain, rushing towards the high altar, their expressions filled with apprehension and terror.</p><p>Among them were those of low cultivation, far from achieving their final forms, as well as Demon Marquises.</p><p>Even among the figures seated around the high altar, some stepped forward.</p><p>These were the Demon Kings of Guǐfāng, regional overlords who had previously assisted the Great Sage in understanding the fragments and deducing the divine path.</p><p>All the summoned demon cultivators had adopted the new divine path, having truly merged with the spirit gods within the Twenty-Four Celestial Prison fragments. They were all carefully selected by the Great Sage – intelligent, capable, and exceptionally gifted.</p><p>While deducing the new divine path, they also relied on the fragments of the Twenty-Four Celestial Prisons to comprehend the Daoist Court's old divine path.</p><p>Guǐfāng had extremely deep roots with the Daoist Court; their progress in deduction was rapid, with Demon Kings successfully merging with the spirit gods within just a few decades.</p><p>"Demon Gods, enter the Celestial Prisons!"</p><p>The demon Great Sage swept his gaze across the Demon Gods, and with a wave of his hand, the fragments of the Twenty-Four Celestial Prisons swelled in the wind, with rolling yellow energy surging towards the Demon Gods.</p><p>The Demon Gods dared not resist, and were engulfed by the yellow energy, transforming into streams of light that shot towards the Celestial Prisons.</p><p>Simultaneously, the demon Great Sage raised his right hand and unleashed a palm strike.</p><p>A phantom palm shadow flew out, its palm glowing gold, transforming endlessly, instantly becoming a golden seal.</p><p>The golden light was dazzling; the inscriptions on the seal were impossible to make out.  It flashed and flew into the Celestial Prisons, merging with the yellow energy.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The Celestial Prisons trembled violently, suddenly erupting with a beam of yellow light, thick as a mountain, soaring towards the heavens.</p><p>At that moment, the demon Great Sage and the assembled demons sensed that this yellow light had touched an unknown entity, connecting that place to the Celestial Prisons.</p><p>"Quickly enter the Divine Court and seize it! Once we control the Divine Court, the Daoist Sect will be at our mercy!  Achieve immortal glory, and I, the Great Sage, shall grant you the River Map positions!"</p><p>The demon Great Sage roared, offering a great reward.</p><p>The divine path was established by the Daoist Court, and the River Map positions corresponded to the True Monarchs with River Map titles, equivalent to the demon Great Sages.</p><p>In the past, the demon Great Sage couldn't have made such a promise.</p><p>Now that the Divine Court had appeared, he could sense that the Gōngshān sub-prefecture's seal was gradually restoring its connection with the Divine Court, and there would be no more limitations!</p><p>*Roar! Roar! Roar!*</p><p>Excited roars came from within the Celestial Prisons, and streams of light surged upwards along the yellow light towards the heavens.</p><p>Then came screams of agony.</p><p>The Twenty-Four Celestial Prisons were only fragments after all; the connection to the Divine Court was precarious.  Those attempting to force their way in would inevitably face terrifying pressure. Those of weaker cultivation were instantly obliterated, with less than one in ten succeeding in entering the Divine Court.</p><p>The demon Great Sage watched the Celestial Prisons impassively, his expression unwavering.  He waved his sleeve, and a golden palace in the mountain emitted purple light.</p><p>The purple light shot into the air, revealing a large drum that hovered in the center of the altar – the Guǐfāng's treasured Demonic-Summoning Drum!</p><p>Without any apparent action from the demon Great Sage, the Demonic-Summoning Drum pulsed with purple light, and the drum sounded.</p><p>Unlike the drum's sound in the Gōngshān altar, this sound was very dull, carrying a sense of unease.</p><p>Hearing the drumbeat, the surrounding Demon Kings all looked solemn.</p><p>Within the kingdom of Guifang, all the residences of the Yao Kings, Yao Marquises, and even the Yao Marshals, simultaneously resonated with the sound of bells and bronze vessels.</p><p>At this moment, the entire nation was thrown into chaos.</p><p>The Yao cultivators recalled an ancient legend:  the ringing of these bells signified a moment of life or death for Guifang.  The entire nation, united in fate, would fight to the death against any external enemy!</p><p>Terror, fear, doubt, panic…</p><p>These negative emotions spread throughout Guifang, but this was the Great Sage's decree, which the Yao cultivators dared not disobey.</p><p>The Yao Marshals immediately descended from their mountain retreats, gathering their troops and marching.</p><p>Every Yao city shone brightly; small teleportation arrays, fueled by spirit stones, remained constantly active, transporting squads of elite soldiers—some towards the Huangquan Path, others from the Yao Marquis' and Yao King's residences, all converging on the Great Sage's Palace.</p><p>The Huangquan Path soon ran red with blood as the army relentlessly charged towards the Daoist sect.</p><p>The Yao Great Sage, eyes fixed on the west, ignored the chaos caused by the bells, and stomped his foot heavily on the ground.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>He stepped through the void, causing the celestial mountain to tremble.</p><p>Golden light burst forth from the four palaces, generating towering golden pillars.</p><p>Each pillar was adorned with lifelike carved dragons, their scales gleaming gold; closer inspection revealed unique patterns on each scale, resembling intricate talismans.</p><p>A total of one hundred and eight golden pillars rose above the Great Sage's Palace, forming a mystical array.</p><p>With countless soldiers and this pillar array, even without the Great Sage personally stationed in the palace, the Daoist court could not easily seize the  Yao Bell!</p><p>Having completed these preparations, the Yao Great Sage let out a long roar, suddenly transforming into a ball of golden light.</p><p>The next moment, a five-clawed golden dragon emerged from the light, clad in scales and crowned with horns.</p><p>Thunder roared in the heavens, as if wind and thunder accompanied him, even more majestic than the dragons that pulled his chariot.</p><p>Its dragon eyes swept across the land.</p><p>Upon meeting that ferocious gaze, the hearts of all the Yao Kings tightened, finally jolting them from the series of events.</p><p>“You shall strike the Yao Bell with all your might, and do not cease until I command!”</p><p>His voice boomed like thunder.</p><p>The Yao Kings were shocked.</p><p>The Yao Bell, a national treasure used to intimidate the Daoist court, had never been struck with full force, even at Guifang’s most critical moments.</p><p>Could the Great Sage intend to fight to the death, attracting endless ferocious beasts to perish with the Daoist court?</p><p>‘Dong!’</p><p>A purple light stung the eyes of the Yao, as a drumbeat with a strange rhythm echoed out of Guifang, reaching the Nial Plain and the Nial Sea…</p><p>The five-clawed golden dragon swung its tail, striking the drumhead with all its might, then leaped up, gathering the Twenty-Four Diagrams of the Celestial Prison, and broke through the sky.</p><p>…</p><p>Nial Plain.</p><p>The roars of beasts echoed through the mountains and fields, mixed with strange howls, and terrifying auras surged forth, wildly violent.</p><p>Dark clouds of demonic energy filled the sky above the Nial Plain.</p><p>…</p><p>Nial Sea.</p><p>The wind gathered clouds.</p><p>Giant waves rose from the sea, and countless shadowy creatures emerged, forming a terrifying storm that threatened the coast.</p><p>…</p><p>Tianyue Shangren moved through the air, ascending swiftly.</p><p>His previous communication with Qin Sang was merely a fragment of his divine sense; his true body remained elsewhere.</p><p>He gazed at the moon in the sky.</p><p>The Moon Palace seemed infinitely far, yet also incredibly close.</p><p>His steps appeared slow, yet each stride spanned vast distances through the void.</p><p>‘Dong!’</p><p>The drumbeat shook the heavens.</p><p>Tianyue Shangren had reached the edge of the lunar halo; slightly lowering his eyes, he extended his right hand, and softly said, “Sword!”</p><p>‘Zheng!’</p><p>Jianxin Island suddenly resounded with the sound of a sword.</p><p>A beam of sword light split open the cave, soaring towards the True Person of the Sword, revealing its blade.</p><p>‘Bang!’</p><p>The treasured sword hung upside down, and the talismans wrapped around it shattered, revealing an ancient divine sword inscribed with the ancient characters ‘Pojun’!</p><p>As if its seal had been broken, the sword radiated divine light.</p><p>Tianyue Shangren reached for the divine sword, which trembled slightly before he firmly grasped it.</p><p>With a slight tremor of his wrist, the divine sword trembled, splitting into two sword shadows.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>The sword shadows slashed through the air.</p><p>One struck towards the demonic clouds over the Nial Plain.</p><p>One struck towards the storm over the Nial Sea.</p><p>At that moment, the five-clawed golden dragon, carrying the Twenty-Four Diagrams of the Celestial Prison, flew down from the sky.</p><p>Seeing Tianyue Shangren, the dragon’s eyes narrowed, and it roared, “Who are you, daring to obstruct me!”</p><p>Tianyue Shangren, unafraid of the Yao Great Sage's might, stepped into the lunar halo and stood before the Southern Heavenly Gate.</p><p>He couldn’t enter the Divine Court, but he stood in front of it.</p><p>Standing with his sword before the Southern Heavenly Gate!</p><p>“Those who trespass in the Divine Court shall die!”</p><p>(End)</p>
