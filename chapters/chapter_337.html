<h1>Chapter 330: The Tranquil Spirit Pill</h1><p>Chapter 330: The Tranquil Spirit Pill</p><p>The strong man, still wearing his mask and without further disguise, was instantly recognized by Qin Sang.  That inexplicable familiarity, felt only once upon their first meeting, had been dismissed as a delusion.  Yet, here he was again.</p><p>“I was just about to seal the passage, friend. You've arrived just in the nick of time. Please, have a seat.”</p><p>The elder spoke, simultaneously waving his hand to create a magical barrier.  The dark entrance to the hidden chamber pulsed, and a wall spontaneously formed, sealing it shut.</p><p>The strong man, seemingly having rushed here, was breathless. Before even sitting down, he eagerly pressed, “Senior, you said a fellow cultivator was willing to trade a Tranquil Spirit Pill for my Thousand Vine Flowers? Is that true?”</p><p>Qin Sang silently mused at the reason.  The Tranquil Spirit Pill, while capable of nourishing the soul and healing the spirit, was less potent than the Heart Meditation Fruit. Clearly, the strong man desperately needed such a pill, failing to obtain one at the trade fair, and settling for this alternative.  His tone suggested the elder had invited him.</p><p>The elder's brow furrowed slightly.  He replied, “I never lie. There is indeed a cultivator with a Tranquil Spirit Pill who wishes to trade it, but whether a deal is made depends entirely on both of you. I'm merely facilitating the introduction and acting as a witness; I cannot guarantee anything further. Please be patient, friend. The secret market is about to begin, and you’ll soon know if my words are true.”</p><p>At that moment, a person seated to the elder's left spoke, “Senior, I see this cultivator is quite anxious. Since everyone's here, why don't we start this trade with them? It will set an example for others.”</p><p>The speaker was cloaked in dark robes, completely concealing their head.  Despite this, their small stature was evident, a stark contrast to the strong man.  From the voice, it was a female cultivator.</p><p>She seemed very familiar with the elder, her words casual and unrestrained.</p><p>The elder readily agreed, chuckling, “Since you say so, let me briefly explain the rules of the secret market, and we shall begin. The rules are simple: you will take turns presenting the items you wish to trade, stating your terms. If others are interested, they may bid, and the final decision rests solely with the two involved parties. I will not interfere.  The origin of the items and the identities of the traders are not to be discussed.  It's a simple exchange—goods for payment, and the matter is settled. No one may leave before the secret market concludes. Furthermore, while my cultivation may be modest, I do have certain means at my disposal. I urge those with ill intentions to reconsider and avoid causing any unpleasantness…”</p><p>After this, the elder gestured to the woman beside him.  She leaned forward towards the restless strong man, softly explaining, "Sir, I am not eligible to participate in the auction, and only learned about your three Thousand Vine Flowers from the Senior today. I have a Tranquil Spirit Pill in perfect condition, and I'm willing to exchange it with you. Would you be interested?"</p><p>The strong man eagerly nodded, “Yes, yes…”</p><p>He immediately produced the three Thousand Vine Flowers, placing them on the table for all to see.  The jade box held three plump blossoms, still vibrant despite being picked. The others' gazes were drawn to the flowers.</p><p>At this point, several individuals attempted to trade for the flowers with other items, but the strong man refused them all.</p><p>“I only need spirit herbs that nourish the soul!”</p><p>Seeing this, the female cultivator didn't delay, quickly nodding, “Those are indeed mature Thousand Vine Flowers.  This is my Tranquil Spirit Pill. Please inspect it. If you have no further requirements, we can exchange now.”</p><p>She produced a jade vial containing a teardrop-shaped pill.</p><p>The strong man cautiously examined the pill, confirming it was indeed a Tranquil Spirit Pill, and breathed a sigh of relief. He was about to agree, when he was suddenly interrupted.</p><p>“Wait!”</p><p>A man sitting lower down, wearing a wooden mask, spoke out, ignoring the strong man’s furious glare. He addressed the female cultivator, “Esteemed cultivator, I too am interested in the Tranquil Spirit Pill, and am willing to offer a top-grade magical artifact of greater value than the Thousand Vine Flowers.  Please consider my offer before making a decision.”</p><p>As he spoke, the masked man placed a bronze ring artifact on the table for inspection.  It was indeed a very fine top-grade artifact.</p><p>Unexpectedly, a further complication arose, captivating the onlookers. The Tranquil Spirit Pill, though less valuable than a top-grade artifact, was priceless to those in desperate need.  Both the strong man and the robed woman urgently required it, turning it into a highly sought-after item.</p><p>“This…”</p><p>The female cultivator hesitated, clearly tempted by the top-grade artifact.</p><p>Seeing this, the strong man became anxious, almost rising from his seat.  "I have magical artifacts too! Give me the Tranquility Pill, and I'll give you mine!"</p><p>He hastily produced several artifacts from his pouch, urging the female cultivator to choose, all of them high-quality items.</p><p>His voice changed, revealing his true tone; his earlier voice must have been a disguise.  This wasn't unusual; no one was surprised.</p><p>Except Qin Sang. Upon hearing the strong man's true voice, her eyes narrowed, peering intently at him from beneath her hood, trying to see past his mask.  Her expression was one of surprise, confusion, and deep curiosity.</p><p>In stark contrast to the strong man's urgency, the masked man calmly replied, "Friend, consider this carefully.  Many herbs have similar effects to the Thousand Vines Flower, but opportunities to exchange one for a top-tier artifact are rare. I wouldn't be making this trade if I didn't need the Tranquility Pill."</p><p>After some thought, the female cultivator bowed slightly to the masked man, apologizing, "Thank you for your generosity, but while a top-tier artifact is desirable, the Thousand Vines Flower is crucial for my cultivation. I'm sorry."</p><p>"A pity,"</p><p>The masked man shook his head slightly, not pressing the matter further, putting away his artifact.</p><p>The female cultivator turned to the strong man. "I'm satisfied to have exchanged the Tranquility Pill for the Thousand Vines Flower; I dare not be greedy for your artifacts. If you have no objections, let's exchange under the elder's supervision."</p><p>They handed their treasures to the elder, each paying 10% of the value in spirit stones. The transaction was complete.  The deal was final, neither party could renege.</p><p>After a series of twists and turns, the coveted Tranquility Pill was finally hers.</p><p>The strong man's excitement was palpable. He clutched the jade bottle, repeatedly examining it.  Later transactions, however impressive, failed to capture his interest.</p><p>If the Secret Market rules hadn't prohibited leaving prematurely, he likely would have departed immediately.</p>
