<h1>Chapter 1694:  Usurping the Nest</h1><p>"I have a matter I wish to ask the Immortal Lady."</p><p>Entering Manzhou Province and traveling for some time, Qin Sang recalled something.  He took out an ice plate and handed it to Liuli, "Immortal Lady, can you sense anything special about this treasure's energy?"</p><p>Qin Sang's mastery of the Way of Ice was no match for Liuli's.</p><p>Upon learning the origin and function of the ice plate, Liuli examined it carefully before closing her eyes and sensing the icy煞 energy within.</p><p>Qin Sang watched Liuli quietly.  Once she opened her eyes, he said,  "My avatar cultivated this icy煞 energy, perfecting the Ice Soul Radiance, and gained a breakthrough opportunity because of it."</p><p>Liuli suddenly understood.  No wonder the radiance her avatar used was so strange.</p><p>"It doesn't seem to be purely icy power, yet it's perfectly natural, not like a deliberate fusion. It can even weaken heavenly tribulations. I am truly ignorant..."</p><p>Liuli mused, shaking her head at last. "It doesn't suit my cultivation base, but it can serve as a reference."</p><p>Thereafter, Liuli studied the ice plate while traveling, with Qin Sang accompanying her silently.</p><p>They journeyed across countless mountains and rivers.</p><p>Finally, they arrived at the shore of a large lake.</p><p>This lake was a thousand miles in diameter, not the largest in Manzhou Province, but its most unique feature was its indigo-colored water, instantly recognizable to cultivators familiar with the region as highly toxic.</p><p>The lakeshore was abundant with lush vegetation, all kinds of poisonous plants.</p><p>Apart from a few naturally poisonous creatures, no other living beings could survive here.  Most of Manzhou Province, except for the northern part near the Central Plains, was like this—desolate, with barely any living things to be seen.</p><p>"The entrance is here!"</p><p>Qin Sang flew to the center of the lake, surveying the surface.  He flew west for a hundred miles, nodded to Liuli, and dived into the lake.</p><p>Liuli followed.</p><p>Using their true essence to protect themselves, they rapidly descended to the lakebed.  The deeper they went, the more intense the blue of the water became, and with the dimming light, they soon plunged into complete darkness.</p><p>After descending an unknown distance, a hissing sound came from the surface of their protective true essence—the lake water's toxins were corroding it.</p><p>However, their deep cultivation allowed them to withstand it.</p><p>Near the lakebed, they encountered some strange creatures swimming in the lower layers of the water, feeding on the corrupting poison—fiercely venomous things that would terrify anyone from the outside world.</p><p>These venomous creatures were deliberately left behind by the Lord of the Weeping Spirit Cave, not to stop top-tier experts, but to deter cultivators of lesser skill from intruding.</p><p>The Lord of the Weeping Spirit Cave's caution went further.</p><p>The lakebed contained countless large and small holes, connecting to underground rivers, forming a complex network of waterways extending in all directions.</p><p>After searching for a while, Qin Sang found an ordinary-looking hole, entered the underground river, and continued downward, deep into the earth's layers, before sensing a special fluctuation.</p><p>"We've arrived…"</p><p>Qin Sang sent a voice transmission, suddenly accelerating.</p><p>Liuli followed, and under Qin Sang's guidance, they broke through the protective formation of the dwelling.  Then, it felt like they passed through an invisible barrier.  A sense of freshness washed over them as the lake water was left behind.</p><p>Before them lay a cavern filled with blood-red and grey mist.  Upon entering, an icy chill permeated their bones, and the flowing mist sounded like countless resentful spirits weeping.</p><p>Seeing the scene within the mist, Qin Sang and Liuli fell silent.</p><p>It was less a medicinal garden and more a sacrificial ground.</p><p>White bone mounds, much like the human-made bone towers used to display military prowess, stood in the garden.  Zigzagging canals encircled the mounds, but instead of water, they flowed with bright red blood.</p><p>The blood rivers formed a blood array.</p><p>The blood held no stench; instead, a strange fragrance filled the air.</p><p>The fragrance came from the tops of the bone mounds.</p><p>A few mound tops were empty, but most glowed with a red light.</p><p>Inside the red light were various medicinal herbs of strange shapes. Some resembled ganoderma, others blood blossoms or ghost vines; even more bizarre were the blood-infant-like fruits with realistic features.</p><p>It was difficult to find real-world counterparts.  They were cultivated by the Lord of the Weeping Spirit Cave using secret techniques, nourished with refined souls, and had long since deviated from their original forms, becoming "blood herbs."</p><p>Liuli looked at Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang understood Liuli’s meaning:  Are these herbs really safe to eat?</p><p>If the information obtained through soul-searching was accurate, these blood herbs were painstakingly cultivated by the Lord of the Weeping Spirit Cave.  The cultivation process could be likened to alchemy, a unique approach.</p><p>Unless one wished to cultivate the path of corpse and ghost, consuming these herbs would have some effect, but these effects could be overcome with diligent refinement.</p><p>Their appearance might be strange, but their medicinal effects were genuine.</p><p>The cost was perfectly acceptable compared to the benefits.  The medicinal herbs in the bone tomb were not yet mature, significantly reducing their efficacy.  However, Qin Sang urgently needed them to heal, and didn't intend to use the soul-refining method to cultivate them, so decided to harvest them directly.</p><p>The information obtained from soul-searching was incomplete; Qin Sang didn't recognize some of the herbs.  Liuli went out to capture demonic beasts and poisonous creatures to test their properties, then categorized them.</p><p>After clearing away the bones and blood from the medicinal garden, the cave dwelling began to resemble a home.</p><p>In the quiet cave dwelling:</p><p>Qin Sang took the medicine to heal.</p><p>Liuli meditated on the ice plate nearby.</p><p>Once her condition improved slightly, Qin Sang focused on the toxins in her body—the main cause of her worsening injuries—which had to be eliminated first.  By harnessing the power of the poison pearl and using the pills, she slowly expelled the toxins.  Color gradually returned to her face.</p><p>Time passed slowly.</p><p>Qin Sang’s condition improved day by day, but her foundational injuries were severe and wouldn't heal quickly.</p><p>Her main body was recuperating in the south, protected by Liuli.</p><p>Her secondary body traveled north, entering the Northern Wastelands.</p><p>The snowstorm had just ended, and the weather had cleared.</p><p>The snow was thick.</p><p>The snow covered the land and mountains completely.  The wind whipped up the fine snow, swirling in a blinding white flurry.</p><p>The secondary body, disguised, flew over the snowdrifts.  After traveling for some time, it stopped above a snowdrift, gazed down for a moment, and then made a hand gesture, sending it into the snow below.</p><p>"Who's there!"</p><p>The snow suddenly cracked, revealing a mountain's shadow below, from which a figure flew upward.</p><p>"Senior, it's me."</p><p>The secondary body whispered.  It seemed that Gui Mu and Ya Gu were safe, finally putting her mind at ease.</p><p>The arrival was Gui Mu, who smiled wryly.  "So it's the Fire Demon, who recently turned Central State upside down, who has arrived.  Slaying a Nascent Soul heir and destroying a Saint King's phantom body—quite a reputation!  I underestimated you."</p><p>"Senior, please don't jest.  I'm being hunted by powerful enemies, a stray dog now."</p><p>The secondary body sighed.</p><p>Rumors about the Wuxiang Immortal Sect were already rife in Central State.  The capture of the ancient demon, the fall of Zi Lei—these major events were overshadowed by the colorful tales about Qin Sang.</p><p>She was depicted as an unparalleled villain, the likes of which hadn't been seen in millennia.</p><p>The rumors became more and more exaggerated.  Based on these descriptions, Qin Sang felt she didn't need to run; annihilating two Nascent Soul cultivators and then subduing the ancient demon single-handedly should have been easy.</p><p>Several more people emerged from the cave dwelling.</p><p>The commotion above had alerted others in the cave dwelling, prompting them to investigate.</p><p>The secondary body glanced down.  There were three people.</p><p>One was her nominal disciple Shen Chen.  Another was a boy leading a young girl, looking about six or seven years old, observing the secondary body with a mixture of curiosity and fear.  The boy appeared to be twelve or thirteen and quite composed.</p><p>"You even dared provoke Nascent Soul cultivators. The Xie family and Loutai View are implicated; their fate is uncertain.  Too many people would reveal our location, so I could only bring these few out.  Additionally, both families secretly sent away some promising disciples.  The others were difficult to move, so their entire families chartered a Dragon Residence Heaven's boat and openly went to Ganlu Zen Temple to beg for mercy.  As for these three, you'll have to arrange for them."</p><p>Gui Mu, experienced and forewarned, had handled Qin Sang's rear affairs.  With this arrangement, even in the worst-case scenario, the Xie family and Loutai View could maintain a line of succession.</p><p>The boy's name was Xie Yi.  Qin Sang remembered him as a rare genius, the Xie family's hope for the future.</p><p>The secondary body landed.  Shen Chen bowed, and Xie Yi, holding the girl's hand, also prostrated, already aware of the secondary body's true identity.</p><p>Examining the girl's features, they seemed familiar.</p><p>"Are you Zhou Jin and Ruan Yu's daughter?"</p><p>When the Zhou and Ruan couple had visited, they expressed their concern about failing to break through to the Nascent Soul stage and planned to leave behind their lineage first, using secret techniques for years, pointedly mentioning this to Qin Sang, hoping for a chance to become her disciples.</p><p>However, Qin Sang hadn’t given a response, so they dared not mention it again.</p><p>"My name is Zhou Li. My parents told me to follow the ancestor and be obedient," the little girl said crisply, bowing formally to Qin Sang.</p><p>The secondary body pointed to Zhou Li and Xie Yi and said to Shen Chen, "They are your disciples from now on."</p><p>The Demon Sealing Stake had already been given away, but the Meteor Iron Divine Whip remained, and Qin Sang couldn't exactly burn bridges.</p><p>Fortunately, this disciple might prove useful.</p><p>"This… this disciple obeys!"</p><p>Shen Chen was dumbfounded, looking at his two new disciples with a headache.  He had to look after children now.</p><p>But he couldn't disobey his master's orders.</p><p>Especially after hearing about Qin Sang's deeds in the South from Gui Mu, Shen Chen felt both respect and awe for his master.</p><p>He dismissed his disciples with a wave of his hand.</p><p>Huasheng and Guimu entered the quiet chamber and saw Ya Gu sleeping on a bed of ice.  Her breathing was steady, but seemed heavier than before.</p><p>"I hear your recent gains were substantial?" Guimu asked, raising an eyebrow without a hint of hesitation.</p><p>Huasheng replied, "I must thank you, senior, for your timely warning. I wouldn't have had this opportunity otherwise! Using the witch clan mark you left, I found the remains of that witch clan's Nascent Divinity cultivator in the legacy mansion. It seems, like those experts from the Wuxiang Immortal Sect, they were afflicted by demonic corruption during the demonic tribulation, sealed themselves within Mount Di Shou, and met with misfortune..."</p><p>How difficult it is to reach the Nascent Divinity stage in this world! This witch clan cultivator, on the verge of breaking free, suffered misfortune and died far from home.</p><p>Guimu said calmly, "It's fate."</p><p>"Among that senior's belongings was a sea chart of the Canglang Sea. Senior, are you interested in visiting the witch clan descendants?" Qin Sang had found the chart amongst the various items.</p><p>The Canglang Sea was located southeast of the Central Plains, even farther than the North Sea.</p><p>Because Qin Sang didn't know the exact location of Gui Xu, she didn't know if the Canglang Sea corresponded to it, or its relative position.</p><p>"With Ya Gu here, what's the point of going? My own path is unclear; I have no energy to spare helping others.  Those of the same clan aren't necessarily of the same lineage. Would you show favoritism to the Central Plains humans?"</p><p>Guimu's expression was cold. After a pause, she continued, "Ya Gu's condition is better than expected.  Progress has been very smooth lately! I am already preparing to traverse the void. Once ready, I will choose a day to ascend."</p><p>"So soon?" Huasheng frowned.</p><p>Guimu shook her head and murmured, "I've waited too long."</p><p>The void-crossing involved a witch clan secret technique, so Huasheng couldn't offer any input. Looking outside the cave, he said, "If there's anything I can do, Senior, please just ask. The most important thing is Ya Gu's safety.  But before that, we should find a safe place to settle."</p><p>With that, Huasheng flicked his sleeve, and two wisps of ethereal light flew out.</p><p>One contained a broken banner; the other, Su Zinan's infant soul. Huasheng had brought both.</p><p>The infant soul's eyes were closed, and its consciousness was unclear.</p><p>Su Zinan had first been poisoned, then burned.  After Qin Sang imprisoned him, he almost died from the poison. Fortunately, Huasheng discovered him in time, suppressing the poison and saving his life.</p><p>Qin Sang only wanted to use the infant soul to search his memories.</p><p>However, after finding his cultivation technique among his possessions and examining the Three Corpse Demonic Banner, she changed her mind.</p><p>Once the Three Corpse Demonic Banner collected three late-Nascent Divinity demonic souls and was fully subdued, it could use the three souls as a foundation to aid in the breakthrough to the Nascent Divinity stage. The problem was that the three-soul breakthrough required a specific technique to have that effect.</p><p>These were all products of Lu Lao Mo's experiments, combining blood path techniques, the Three Corpse Demonic Banner, and Lu Lao Mo's own cultivation method.</p><p>Two of the demonic souls Su Zinan had collected were destroyed by the Sun God Bird; the banner was damaged.  The third soul survived, but remained faceless, without a merged Nascent Divinity.</p><p>Qin Sang planned to use this slot for Su Zinan.</p><p>She didn't intend to change cultivation techniques.  The Three Corpse Demonic Banner in her hands could only be used as a weapon, and repairing it would be extremely difficult.</p><p>Su Zinan, relying on the legacy of a Nascent Divinity cultivator, and with Wu Lao and the Underworld Moon Guards under him, collecting the necessary spiritual materials would be incredibly hard.</p><p>However, if it could be simply repaired and Su Zinan's soul integrated into the demonic soul, she would not only gain a powerful force but also easily obtain the secrets Su Zinan knew.</p><p>On the journey north, Huasheng studied the demonic banner, gradually understanding it, but then encountered a problem.</p><p>Su Zinan's cultivation was one level higher than Huasheng's, meaning a high chance of failure. He needed Guimu's help.</p><p>After hearing the details, Guimu took the banner and the infant soul, beginning with a sneer, "A Nascent Divinity's adopted son reduced to this state. Even if Lu Lao Mo knew, he would only feel ashamed, probably too embarrassed to seek revenge."</p><p>"Hm?"</p><p>Guimu held the Three Corpse Demonic Banner, examining it carefully. She seemed interested. "This broken banner is rather interesting."</p><p>Huasheng recalled that the Heavenly Corpse Talisman came from Guimu, and his expression was strange.</p><p>One imprisoned a living infant; the other controlled a living corpse.  Could Guimu have some peculiar fetish?</p><p>Ten days later.</p><p>The group left the snow peak, heading east, towards Luye!</p><p>The demonic banner imprisoned the infant soul. From Su Zinan, they learned the origins of the Luye Plain.</p><p>The Luye Plain was an ancient cave dwelling Lu Lao Mo had unintentionally discovered while traveling in the North Sea.</p><p>Because the Luye Plain constantly moved between the Northern Wastelands and the North Sea without a clear pattern, and the Luye Formation was very secretive, the secret realm only reappeared after Lu Lao Mo occupied it, becoming his cultivation grounds.</p><p>Without the owner's guidance, no one knew where Luye was.  There was no better hiding place than Luye.</p><p>Su Zinan had left Luye on the East Sea coast; it was now ownerless.</p>
