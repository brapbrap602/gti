<h1>Chapter 1268: True Form</h1><p>Chapter 1268: True Form</p><p>Yu Gu was drawn by the magical energy of the artifact, involuntarily moving like an inanimate object.</p><p>Manacles bound her, their magical energy still connected to the blood pool seal.</p><p>No one could sense Yu Gu's aura; it was impossible to tell if the ancient cultivator was trapped by the manacles or already dead.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>At this moment, Ye Laomo and Qing Jun flew out of the blood pool almost simultaneously.</p><p>Qing Jun rode her Qingluan, surrounded by the Jiangshan Yin Yue (River and Mountain Hidden Moon) painting; the Qingluan puppet cried out repeatedly, its cries filled with rage.</p><p>Jing Yu landed last; her feathers were disheveled, her aura weak.  She had expended immense energy breaking the blood threads and had been injured in the subsequent battle.</p><p>After breaking the blood curse on the bones and obtaining the Corpse Flower Blood Jasper, she rushed over to see that Ye Laomo had already opened the cage and released Yu Gu. She quickly activated her Thunder Bead to assist Qing Jun.</p><p>Ye Laomo truly lives up to his reputation as the number one cultivator in Beichen.</p><p>Even together, she and Qing Jun were no match for him.</p><p>Jing Yu didn't dare approach the two in direct combat, so she used her innate divine ability from the perimeter, wielding thunder, shooting out beams of lightning at Ye Laomo.</p><p>Ye Laomo fought against two opponents.</p><p>Wherever he went, a blizzard raged, freezing the blood.</p><p>Beside him, a single white shadow – a fusion of several previous shadows – constantly appeared. It sometimes moved like a living creature, baring its fangs and claws, attacking Qing Jun and preventing her and the Qingluan puppet from approaching Yu Gu.</p><p>At other times, it transformed into a mass of icy mist.</p><p>Jing Yu's lightning bolts and Qing Jun's attacks dissipated into the icy mist like stones sinking into the ocean, absorbed without harming Ye Laomo in the slightest.</p><p>The white shadow originated from a ten-thousand-year-old piece of profound ice that Ye Laomo had unintentionally obtained in Yuanxu. It had been refined by an ancient cultivator. After years of study, Ye Laomo devised a way to utilize it.</p><p>He secretly refined others' Nascent Souls, fusing them with the profound ice to create an ice demon.</p><p>Though appearing like a puppet controlled by Ye Laomo, the ice demon's consciousness was chaotic and incapable of independent action. It was more akin to an artifact, capable of both offense and defense, having played a crucial role in breaking the seal.</p><p>However, despite having the ice demon, Ye Laomo did not dare to ignore Qing Jun and Jing Yu's attacks.  Several attempts to approach Yu Gu were thwarted.</p><p>The three harbored conflicting thoughts.  They were wary of Yu Gu, but also concerned that the conflict's shockwaves might damage her fragile form, rendering their efforts futile.</p><p>Thus, they fought cautiously, their battle moving from the bottom of the blood pool to outside.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>Finally, a manacle on Yu Gu was shattered by the residual energy of the artifact.</p><p>Everyone's pupils constricted.</p><p>Yu Gu, still showing no signs of revival, tumbled within their sight.</p><p>Qing Jun let out a sharp cry, the scenery of the Jiangshan Yin Yue painting manifesting into reality.</p><p>Her expression remained unchanged as she calmly gazed at Yu Gu, silently chanting an incantation. A beam of moonlight illuminated Yu Gu, the moonlight forming a path for the Qingluan.</p><p>“唳!”</p><p>The Qingluan let out a long cry, using the moonlight's power to swiftly swoop down.</p><p>Ye Laomo's face darkened; he also reached for Yu Gu.</p><p>A distance still separated him from Yu Gu. The ice demon transformed into a mist, flying into his palm, then turning into a giant hand of profound ice, instantly appearing beneath Yu Gu.</p><p>On the other side.</p><p>The Blood Demon incarnation used all its abilities, struggling under the demonic flames.</p><p>Qin Sang held nothing back, fully unleashing the power of the demonic flames before everyone.</p><p>The blood light of the Blood Moon Wheel was suppressed to its limit, barely protecting the Blood Demon incarnation. The blood light dimmed like a candle flame, almost invisible within the sea of black fire.</p><p>The blood light was in imminent danger of shattering.</p><p>The three blood shadows, unable to dodge, had no chance to breathe, their consumption horrifyingly rapid.</p><p>Seeing Qing Jun and Jing Yu safe, Qin Sang felt a little relieved.  The sight before him made it clear that victory hung in the balance.</p><p>Looking at the Blood Demon incarnation desperately trying to stop him, a cold light flashed in Qin Sang's eyes. With a cold snort, the endless demonic flames surged towards the center, condensing into a fire dragon that roared towards its target.</p><p>Fear appeared on the Blood Demon incarnation's face; it knew it likely couldn't withstand this attack.</p><p>Ye Laomo glanced in this direction, his lips moving slightly.</p><p>The Blood Demon incarnation's expression suddenly froze.  The three blood shadows rushed towards the center, merging into one, but not reverting to its original form. Instead, they turned into a blood bead the size of a fist, charging directly towards Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang frowned, sensing danger.  Without hesitation, he summoned his tortoise shell shield.</p><p>The next moment, a earth-shattering boom echoed from the heart of the demonic flames.</p><p>*BOOM!*</p><p>Ye Laomo actually self-destructed his Blood Demon incarnation!</p><p>The demonic flames charged head-on, ripped apart by the blast's aftershocks.  In an instant, countless demonic flames scattered wildly, a wave of fire engulfing everything. The Blood Demon incarnation and the blood beads vanished, leaving the battlefield in chaos.</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't expected Ye Laomo to self-destruct his Blood Demon incarnation and couldn't dodge in time. He and the demon banner were swallowed by the backwash of demonic flames, their fate unknown.</p><p>Everyone's attention was focused on the Jade Bone's struggle, so the devastating outcome of Qin Sang and the Blood Demon incarnation's fight came as a complete shock. Ye Laomo's Blood Demon incarnation, fighting Qin Sang alone, without any help from either side, had been driven to a desperate act!</p><p>The power of the demonic flames and the strength of the Moonlit Demon King were reassessed, leaving many aghast.  Some even suspected the Moonlit Demon King was a disguised feathered demon.</p><p>The Xiaohan domain was a mixture of shock and joy.  The self-destruction of Ye Laomo's incarnation was like losing an arm, severely weakening him. Even if they hadn't recovered the Jade Bone, it was still a worthwhile endeavor.</p><p>But their concern lay in the deathly silence at the heart of the demonic flames.  They didn't know the Moonlit Demon King's condition. The Blood Demon incarnation's self-destruction was incredibly powerful, and it had been aimed directly at the Moonlit Demon King.  Could he have perished, caught completely off guard?</p><p>*Whoosh! Whoosh!*</p><p>Suddenly, the demonic flames, scattered everywhere, swirled back inward. The scene at the center of the flames was revealed.  Eighteen demon banners lay askew.  The demon banner formation had been impacted, but most of the force had been absorbed by the flames.</p><p>Amongst the banners, a figure emerged from behind a tortoise shell. His breathing was ragged, his hair disheveled, his face ashen, yet he stood defiantly!</p><p>"Huh?"</p><p>Someone noticed that the Moonlit Demon King's mask was gone, destroyed by the Blood Demon's self-destruction, revealing his face. Ever since the Moonlit Demon King's emergence, he'd worn a mask.</p><p>Seeing the Moonlit Demon King's true face, many were puzzled.  Though he appeared excessively young, almost boyish, his features were unremarkable. Why the need for a mask, all that secrecy?</p><p>However, several who had attended the Cang Heng Island meeting felt a sense of familiarity, suddenly recalling a past event.  This person was Qin Sang, unexpectedly appearing to claim the reward promised to him two hundred years ago by the two domains' alliance.  A disciple of Shao Hua Mountain, he stood beside Leng Yuntian, also known as Qing Jun, at odds with their ancestor, Dongyang Bo, a simmering feud between them.</p><p>"It's him!"</p><p>"This man is a human cultivator, not a demon king! Good fortune for our people, good fortune for the Xiaohan domain!"</p><p>"So that's it!"</p><p>...</p><p>These shrewd individuals quickly understood why Qin Sang had hidden his identity, a sudden revelation.</p>
