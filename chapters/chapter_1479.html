<h1></h1><p>The gemstones melted, the corals burned, and the once magnificent underwater palace was reduced to a scene of devastation, as if ravaged by wind and fire.  </p><p>Qin Sang's praise sounded more like a taunt.  </p><p>As he surveyed the ruins of the underwater palace, he marveled at the power of the Solar Divine Tree while reflecting on his experience controlling the Solar Divine Birds.  </p><p>At present, he could only barely manage to control three of the divine birds. Due to his insufficient mastery of the *Seed of Fire, Lotus of Gold* technique, he was unable to refine the Southern Brightness Flame, let alone fully subdue it. His only option was to forcibly detonate the spiritual fire within the birds, using them as explosive projectiles akin to thunderbolts.  </p><p>Though the divine birds were immensely powerful, they lacked flexibility, and once unleashed, there was no turning back.  </p><p>The most Qin Sang could do was slightly adjust their flight paths.  </p><p>Thus, the Solar Divine Tree demanded precise timing when used in combat. Against an opponent like the Chaos Demon Elder, who possessed the ability to shift forms and shadows, meticulous planning was essential. Otherwise, the attack would likely miss its mark.  </p><p>The Fourfold Serpent Seal, wielded by Tong Lingyu, paled in comparison to the Solar Divine Tree in terms of raw power. However, thanks to her mastery of the treasure-controlling technique, she could wield it with relative ease, employing various transformations to adapt to different situations.  </p><p>Both treasures had their pros and cons.  </p><p>Which was superior depended on one's perspective.  </p><p>Moreover, the Solar Divine Tree consumed far more energy than Qin Sang had anticipated.  </p><p>In a single battle, the true essence within his body could only sustain two attacks. Even with the aid of spirit stones and elixirs, it was difficult to replenish his true essence quickly enough.  </p><p>Treasures like the Three Radiance Jade Nectar were rare and hard to come by.  </p><p>Furthermore, he couldn't rely entirely on the Solar Divine Tree during combat. He needed to conserve some strength to wield other treasures.  </p><p>Qin Sang's mind stirred.  </p><p>The Solar Divine Tree, which had been hovering behind his head, shot forward and landed before him. The divine birds on its branches quickly restored to nine in number.  </p><p>This treasure contained a sealed feather of the Vermilion Bird, and the Southern Brightness Flame within it was inexhaustible. The limitation lay in Qin Sang's cultivation level, not the treasure or the flame itself.  </p><p>After its first display of power, Qin Sang stored the Solar Divine Tree back into his Thousand Jun Ring.  </p><p>The light within the underwater palace dimmed.  </p><p>Qin Sang raised his head and met the shocked and terrified gaze of the Frogfish. He chuckled inwardly. For a Nascent Soul cultivator or a demon king, the power of the Solar Divine Tree was indeed overwhelming.  </p><p>The Frogfish's pupils trembled, and its courage shattered. As it watched Qin Sang stride out of the flames, its fear reached its peak, and it deeply regretted its past actions.  </p><p>Why had it been so blind as to provoke such a deadly foe?  </p><p>"Pfft!"  </p><p>The Frogfish spat out a burst of green light toward Qin Sang. Without waiting to see the result, it turned and fled.  </p><p>It had used this green light against Qin Sang before, and now it was resorting to the same trick.  </p><p>In an instant, the underwater palace was filled with a green glow, saturated with deadly poison. Even a mere touch of this poison would cause flesh and bones to dissolve, leading to a painful death as the victim turned into a pool of pus.  </p><p>Thus, despite being only at the early stage of transformation, the Frogfish was one of the demon kings that others least wanted to provoke.  </p><p>The green light dispersed the fiery aura, surging forward like waves, crashing toward Qin Sang with ferocious intensity.  </p><p>Though the Frogfish seemed to have gained the upper hand, it knew Qin Sang possessed methods to counter poison. It had nearly suffered a devastating loss the last time and didn't expect the green light to trap Qin Sang. Without looking back, it dashed toward another exit.  </p><p>Only by escaping into the underground river and navigating the complex network of waterways could it hope to shake off its powerful foe.  </p><p>Clad in his poison-resistant armor, Qin Sang charged into the green light without hesitation, relentlessly pursuing the Frogfish.  </p><p>At this moment, while the Frogfish appeared to be fleeing in panic, it remained vigilant, keeping a close eye on its pursuer. Seeing that Qin Sang had taken the bait, the Frogfish's mouth split open, revealing sharp fangs as it grinned maliciously.  </p><p>"Explode!"  </p><p>The Frogfish uttered a strange syllable from its throat.  </p><p>In the next moment, without any warning, dense green orbs materialized within the green light, surrounding Qin Sang. The orbs exploded in rapid succession!  </p><p>The underwater palace shook violently once more, its structures collapsing into ruins.  </p><p>Qin Sang's figure was engulfed by the thick green light.  </p><p>Within the green light, green lightning crackled, linking the orbs and triggering continuous explosions, the deafening roar echoing endlessly.  </p><p>The Frogfish smirked with satisfaction.  </p><p>After its failed ambush on Qin Sang last time, it had realized that its abilities were too one-dimensional. Against an opponent with powerful poison-resistance techniques, it was as good as defenseless.  </p><p>After much contemplation, the Frogfish had devised a new strategy. It had imitated the methods of demonic cultivators who refined Yin Thunder, combining Yin energy with condensed poison to create a unique type of poison thunder.  </p><p>When the poison thunder exploded, it not only released deadly toxins but also unleashed tremendous destructive power.  </p><p>In this life-or-death situation, the Frogfish remained calm. Its earlier display of fear had been partly genuine and partly an act, aimed at making Qin Sang underestimate it and let his guard down.  </p><p>The poison thunder hidden within the green light was its true killing move. Once the poison thunder breached Qin Sang's poison-resistant armor, the deadly toxins would invade his body.  </p><p>The plan had worked!  </p><p>However, even after seeing Qin Sang caught in the explosion, the Frogfish didn't look back, nor did it consider turning to counterattack.  </p><p>It had been utterly terrified by the power of the Solar Divine Tree. The divine birds were lethal on contact, and the Frogfish wasn't known for its physical resilience.  </p><p>Unless the poison thunder could kill Qin Sang outright, even if he were left with a single breath, he could deliver a fatal blow—a risk the Frogfish couldn't afford.  </p><p>The Frogfish only sought to escape its powerful foe.  </p><p>As long as it survived, there would be opportunities for revenge.  </p><p>But fate had other plans.  </p><p>In the next moment, a scene of despair unfolded before the Frogfish.  </p><p>After the poison thunder exploded, Qin Sang emerged unscathed from the green light, protected by a radiant barrier from the Ruyi Pearl.  </p><p>"Whoosh!"  </p><p>With a gentle flap of his phoenix wings, Qin Sang effortlessly overtook the Frogfish, blocking its path.  </p><p>The Frogfish's expression changed drastically, its fear now completely genuine.  </p><p>Qin Sang's gaze was cold as he glanced at the Frogfish. There was no need for words between them; their enmity was long-standing.  </p><p>He didn't summon the Demonfire or the Golden Sinking Sword. Instead, his blood and qi surged, and a faint chant of Buddhist mantras echoed around him as he lunged at the Frogfish, intending to engage in close combat!  </p><p>Having studied the *Seven Master Buddha Seals* for many years, Qin Sang's mastery had deepened. He no longer needed to form hand seals; merely visualizing the seals in his mind allowed him to unleash the first two seals.  </p><p>This was the first seal: the Seal of Auspiciousness!  </p><p>His blood and qi surged, and his fighting spirit soared. He even retracted the barrier from the Ruyi Pearl, intending to test the power of the *Seven Master Buddha Seals* against the Frogfish.  </p><p>"Seeking death!"  </p><p>Knowing there was no escape, the Frogfish's ferocity erupted. It let out a fierce roar and immediately transformed into its true demonic form. Though not renowned for its physical strength, it was still a demon king, far surpassing human cultivators in that regard.  </p><p>For Qin Sang to abandon the advantages of a human cultivator and engage in close combat was sheer folly—an opportunity the Frogfish couldn't pass up.  </p><p>In an instant, the Frogfish transformed into a monstrous creature with the head of a fish and the body of a frog. It let out a guttural roar, its demonic eyes filled with increasing madness.  </p><p>Qin Sang moved even faster, condensing his blood and qi into his palm as he closed the distance. With a powerful strike, he slammed his palm toward the Frogfish.  </p><p>"Boom!"  </p><p>A gust of wind swept past.  </p><p>The Frogfish's pupils contracted. In its vision, all that remained was that single palm strike, a Buddha seal that seemed to lock the surrounding space, making it feel as if it were trapped in quicksand.  </p><p>At that moment, its body twisted violently, as agile as a fish. The scales on its body shimmered, and the force of Qin Sang's palm strike slid off like water, skillfully deflecting the attack.  </p><p>Immediately after, the Frogfish's upper body twisted sharply, its mouth opening wide to reveal fangs that grew to half a foot in length, each gleaming with green light and dripping with deadly poison. Like venomous spears, they lunged at Qin Sang, aiming to bite him while he was still recovering from his strike.  </p><p>If bitten, Qin Sang's body would be riddled with dozens of bloody holes.  </p><p>However, the Frogfish's bite met only air, leaving it momentarily stunned.  </p><p>Qin Sang's movements were ghostly. With his mind focused on the Lotus Seal, he had somehow maneuvered to the Frogfish's side.  </p><p>This wasn't solely due to speed but rather a profound movement technique.  </p><p>As it turned out, the seven Buddha seals of the *Seven Master Buddha Seals* were not only ferocious but also possessed unique applications. Mastering all seven seals was akin to learning a complete set of close-combat techniques.  </p><p>Qin Sang's body was surrounded by a radiant lotus light, as if he were a Buddha born from a lotus.  </p><p>With each step, he seemed to move between lotus petals, his movements elusive and unpredictable, making it impossible for his opponent to anticipate his next move.  </p><p>Seeing Qin Sang suddenly vanish, the Frogfish was momentarily stunned.  </p><p>But this demon was experienced. It immediately refocused, not wasting time searching for Qin Sang. Instead, the scales on its body stood on end, clattering loudly, while a golden light erupted from within, merging with the scales to form a protective armor.  </p><p>Just as it completed these defenses, a sense of imminent danger surged within the Frogfish. It felt an overwhelming force erupting at its side.  </p><p>Qin Sang's hand seals changed once more, forming the fourth seal: the Demon-Subduing Seal. This seal was a true killing technique, delivering a crushing blow with no room for mercy. Its power surpassed that of the first three seals.  </p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang resembled a Vajra subduing tigers or an Arhat taming dragons, his eyes filled with a fierce light.  </p><p>Though Buddhism preached compassion, the Demon-Subduing Seal was a technique of ultimate destruction!  </p><p>"Boom!"  </p><p>Under the Demon-Subduing Seal, demons trembled in fear!  </p><p>The Frogfish was horrified, sensing a threat to its life. This human cultivator's physical strength was on par with a demon king's, and he wielded such a formidable technique.  </p><p>Even the most ferocious demon kings were no match for this!  </p><p>What was even more terrifying was that this man possessed countless rare treasures. He wasn't a pure body cultivator.  </p><p>What kind of monster was he?  </p><p>The Frogfish screamed inwardly, not daring to face the attack head-on. It twisted its body violently, retreating at full speed. However, it was a fraction too slow. A searing pain shot through its shoulder, and its body convulsed, staggering backward.  </p><p>"Bang!"  </p><p>A section of the Frogfish's scaled armor was torn away by Qin Sang's palm strike, flesh and blood flying in all directions.  </p><p>Fortunately, the Frogfish had reacted quickly. Had it taken the full force of the Demon-Subduing Seal, its injuries would have been far more severe.  </p><p>"Ah!"  </p><p>The Frogfish let out a bloodcurdling scream, its demonic eyes filled with rage as it glared at Qin Sang, who was closing in once more. It was now completely consumed by madness.  </p><p>In the next moment, its flesh bulged, and a small section of scales on its chest began to rise from its body, inch by inch, roots still attached and dripping with blood. The sight was horrifying to behold.  </p><p>The Frogfish bared its teeth, its expression twisted in pain. This scale-shedding technique was another of its deadly moves. Refining these poisonous scales had taken years of effort, and the process of shedding them was excruciating.  </p><p>It had been waiting for the perfect opportunity to strike, but Qin Sang's strength was overwhelming. If it waited any longer, it might not even get a chance to attack.  </p><p>The scales were as hard as metal and had been refined with the Frogfish's poison techniques for countless years, making them one of the most toxic substances in the world.  </p><p>"Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!"  </p><p>The poisonous scales rained down like a storm.  </p><p>They filled the air, blotting out the sky.  </p><p>Qin Sang, who was charging forward with unstoppable momentum, had no time to react. At such close range, it seemed impossible for him to dodge. He was about to be struck head-on.  </p><p>Facing this peril, Qin Sang remained calm. His figure paused slightly as his fingers formed a unique hand seal—another Buddha seal.  </p><p>The third seal: the Turning Altar Seal!  </p><p>As soon as the seal was formed, Qin Sang's aura transformed.  </p><p>At this moment, he no longer exuded the overwhelming force of the Demon-Subduing Seal. Instead, his blood and qi condensed around him, as if enveloped by an invisible altar.  </p><p>Within the space around Qin Sang, his blood and qi swirled, forming an intangible vortex at the center of the altar. The first wave of poisonous scales slowed as they entered the vortex, their trajectories slightly altered, preventing them from reaching Qin Sang.  </p><p>This was the wondrous power of the Turning Altar Seal.  </p><p>Not only could it deflect poisonous scales, but it could also neutralize magical treasures.  </p><p>As Qin Sang's physical strength grew and his mastery of this technique deepened, the range of the Turning Altar Seal would expand, allowing him to suppress treasures with his bare hands!  </p><p>After mastering the first four seals of the *Seven Master Buddha Seals*, Qin Sang couldn't help but marvel at the versatility of this technique. His understanding of body cultivation deepened, and he grew even more eager to explore the power and abilities of the remaining three seals.  </p><p>The Frogfish was shocked. Not daring to delay, it quickly merged the poisonous scales into a single drop of dark green liquid, which transformed into a slender poison arrow. The arrow shot toward Qin Sang, piercing through the Turning Altar Seal and vanishing in an instant.  </p><p>However, that brief moment of delay was enough for Qin Sang to step lightly, evading the deadly strike.  </p><p>The poison arrow missed its mark.  </p><p>The Frogfish was stunned. Qin Sang hadn't even used the Ruyi Pearl to dodge its killing move. The gap in their strength was like heaven and earth. Today, it seemed, there was little hope of survival.  </p><p>Knowing it was doomed, the Frogfish fully unleashed its ferocity. With a mournful roar, it lunged at Qin Sang, determined to make its opponent pay, even at the cost of its own life.  </p><p>In battle, there are no fixed patterns, just as water has no constant form.  </p><p>Qin Sang's movements were like lightning, the four Buddha seals shifting seamlessly. His performance now embodied this principle, effortlessly toying with the Frogfish.  </p><p>In the blink of an eye, the two had exchanged countless blows.  </p><p>The once-grand underwater palace was utterly destroyed, reduced to rubble as their battlefield.  </p><p>The Frogfish was forced into a corner, its situation growing increasingly dire as Qin Sang's dominance became absolute. It roared in frustration, but its anger did nothing to change its predicament.  </p><p>The Frogfish's poor performance was due to two reasons.  </p><p>First, the *Seven Master Buddha Seals* were truly extraordinary.  </p><p>Second, the Frogfish's poison attacks were completely countered by the Fat Silkworm. Despite its powerful abilities, it couldn't use them effectively, leaving it utterly frustrated.  </p><p>The Frogfish's roars were filled with resentment and helplessness.  </p><p>"Bang! Bang! Bang!"  </p><p>Seizing the opportunity, Qin Sang struck the Frogfish's chest with the Demon-Subduing Seal.  </p><p>The Frogfish spat blood, its body sent flying backward. It crashed through three stone pillars in the underwater palace, a large dent caving in its chest.  </p><p>Unexpectedly, the Frogfish still refused to give up. It had been waiting for this moment. In one swift motion, it flipped upright and spat out a beam of white light, which shot toward the exit at incredible speed.  </p><p>The Seven Souls Killing Formation descended!  </p><p>The beam of white light was ensnared within the formation, revealing a crystalline fish skeleton. Struck by sword energy, it shattered instantly, extinguishing the Frogfish's last hope.  </p><p>Having confirmed the power of the first four seals, Qin Sang decided to end the fight quickly. He summoned the Golden Sinking Sword and swiftly ended the Frogfish's life.  </p><p>Qin Sang's figure flashed as he grabbed the Frogfish's lifeless body.  </p><p>Surveying the ruins of the underwater palace, he meticulously erased all traces of the Solar Divine Birds to prevent any clues from falling into the hands of the demon race.  </p><p>---  </p><p>*Note: I went out yesterday and wanted to take a short nap when I got home, but ended up sleeping through the night.
