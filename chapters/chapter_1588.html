<h1>Chapter 1579: The Thousand Realms Mirror</h1><p>Chapter 1579: The Thousand Realms Mirror</p><p>Outside the tomb chamber, the fluctuations of the protective barrier intensified.</p><p>Qin Sang was about to arrive.</p><p>Yan Shan, not daring to hesitate, dashed to the edge of the spirit array, glanced at it, raised his palm, a silver light flashing from his palm as he launched a blast of Primal Origin Water at the array.</p><p>The array's function was to extract the chilling煞 energy from the ice platform, supporting the operation of the above mausoleum, not specifically to protect the ice platform itself.</p><p>However, Yan Shan's direct attempt to seize the ice platform triggered the array's counterattack.</p><p>‘Puff!’</p><p>The Primal Origin Water pierced through the outer spiritual light of the array, forcefully disrupting it.</p><p>Layers of cold light rippled within the array, the ice platform slightly trembling, the array's configuration drastically changing. The chilling煞 energy instantly condensed into a crescent-shaped ice blade, disappearing in a flash.</p><p>The ice blade hadn't vanished; it merely moved with extreme speed, its target being Yan Shan.</p><p>A chill ran down Yan Shan's spine. Without hesitation, he moved several meters away, leaving behind an afterimage that was pierced by the ice blade.  Had he been even slightly slower, his chest would have been impaled.</p><p>Even so, his left shoulder was cut by the ice blade, his protective true energy offering no defense whatsoever, easily pierced.</p><p>The blood froze before it could flow, a thin layer of ice covering his shoulder, the ice continuing to spread.</p><p>Yan Shan quickly channeled his true energy to force out the cold energy.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>The ice blade shattered in mid-air, reverting to pure chilling煞 energy, returning to the array to continue its operation.</p><p>Yan Shan stared at where the ice blade had been, breaking out in a cold sweat.</p><p>The Lord of Water had not forgotten to set traps even within the tomb chamber. If he were a true successor of the Water lineage, breaking the array and taking the ice platform would have been no problem.</p><p>But he wasn't even half a successor, having only learned the rudiments.</p><p>Even if he had a way to forcefully break the array, it would consume considerable time, and with pursuers closing in, he had little time to spare.</p><p>Even Lu Ye wasn't their match; how could Yan Shan dare linger in the tomb chamber alone?</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The tomb chamber suddenly shook violently several times.</p><p>Yan Shan turned to look out, his eyes seeing the chaotic light and shadow formed by the collapsing barrier.</p><p>Taking the ice platform by force would not only yield no treasure, but would cost him his life!</p><p>He shifted his gaze back to the ice platform, his heart aching.  With a final sigh, he retracted his Primal Origin Water, decisively abandoning the ice platform and moving to the ice bed to retrieve the jade box.</p><p>The seal on the jade box was far easier to break.</p><p>Yan Shan used some unknown incantation, closing and opening his eyes, his eyes turning into deep, dark pools, his gaze profound as he quickly scanned the three jade boxes, locking onto the middle one.</p><p>‘Pop!’</p><p>The Primal Origin Water shot out, expanding into a thin film of water, covering the middle jade box.</p><p>The ice bed trembled, and intense blue light erupted from it.</p><p>The tomb chamber was bathed in a bluish glow.</p><p>Yan Shan remained unaffected, his fingers moving like wheels, rapidly completing hand seals, and with a low shout, “Open!”</p><p>The Primal Origin Water rapidly retracted, tightly enveloping the jade box. With a ‘pop’, the seal on the jade box shattered, separating from the ice bed and automatically flying into Yan Shan’s hand.</p><p>Yan Shan didn't bother to examine it, using the same method to take the second jade box.</p><p>Just as he was about to unseal and take the third jade box,</p><p>a resounding roar came from outside the tomb.</p><p>Countless fragments of the barrier rained down, two powerful auras hurtling down, the ice floor reflecting two blurred figures.</p><p>Sensing the change, Yan Shan didn't turn back, leaping towards the back of the tomb chamber, raising his right hand and hurriedly pressing the round mirror he'd been holding onto against the wall.</p><p>The mirror disappeared, leaving a man-high circular pattern on the wall, with water rippling inside, like a water gate, as if a well had appeared in the wall.</p><p>Except this well stood upright, its depths unfathomable, its destination unknown.</p><p>Yan Shan leaped, directly entering the water gate, his left half disappearing, his right hand suspended in the air, his Primal Origin Water poised to break the third seal.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang, having broken through multiple barriers, finally saw the tomb chamber of the Lord of Water!</p><p>The barrier outside the tomb chamber was extremely intricate. Without Yan Shan clearing the way, entering would have taken considerable effort.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>Qin Sang landed, not yet steady, his gaze sweeping over the tomb chamber, seeing Yan Shan about to escape, then his expression shocked as he exclaimed, “Thousand Realms Mirror!”</p><p>It was not the jade boxes that caught his eye, but the water gate on the wall!</p><p>“Friend, please wait!”</p><p>Qin Sang shouted, quickly concentrating his spiritual energy, casting the fastest-acting, Soul Capture Incantation.</p><p>Yan Shan Laoren heard two strange sounds, "Humph! Ha!", and felt a sharp pain in his spirit, his face turning slightly pale.  Being a mid-Yuan Ying stage expert, he endured the pain, but the Yi Yuan Chong Shui (One Source Heavy Water) trembled, delaying him from taking the third jade box.</p><p>Simultaneously, the tomb chamber was illuminated by the Jin Chen Sword.</p><p>The sword light was dazzling.</p><p>The sword flashed out like lightning!</p><p>Its target was not Yan Shan Laoren, but the water gate in the wall!</p><p>Yan Shan Laoren was startled and hurriedly retrieved the Yi Yuan Chong Shui, diving into the gate. As his figure disappeared, the water gate shrank rapidly, becoming just a blue point in an instant.</p><p>*Pop!*</p><p>The Jin Chen Sword pierced the light point, but it was too late; the tomb chamber was empty.</p><p>In the snowy wilderness,</p><p>among the crisscrossing ravines, a row of stone walls lit up with a幽蓝 (dark blue) glow, transforming into identical mirrors embedded in the stone, reflecting each other, extending beyond the snowfield.</p><p>A white shadow flickered and leaped between countless mirrors; each jump caused a mirror to vanish without a trace.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the figure crossed the ravines and appeared at the edge of the snowfield—it was Yan Shan Laoren.</p><p>*Swish swish swish…*</p><p>Yan Shan Laoren materialized, took a few stumbling steps, and steadied himself.</p><p>His breath was ragged. Recalling the perilous encounter, he raised his right hand, noticing a clear sword mark on the surface of the treasure mirror—almost piercing it—and took a deep breath.</p><p>Putting away the mirror, Yan Shan Laoren took out his spoils, focusing on the first jade box, and eagerly opened it.</p><p>*Pop!*</p><p>Inside was only one object—a token.</p><p>It was strikingly similar to the one the strange-faced man had, differing only in some patterns and inscriptions. This token bore a "Water" character, while the strange-faced man's bore a "Wood" character!</p><p>Holding the token, Yan Shan Laoren's frustration at missing the ice plate lessened, and a satisfied smile appeared on his face.  He then remembered his precarious situation and quickly put away the treasure, escaping.</p><p>Inside the tomb chamber,</p><p>Qin Sang, failing to capture Yan Shan Laoren, stared at the restored wall, lost in thought.</p><p>He recognized the artifact Yan Shan Laoren used to escape, having read about it before.</p><p>However, the record wasn't from Central Plains but the North Sea.</p><p>Years ago, while in the North Sea investigating Xiao Xiangzi, Qin Sang also investigated the Jing Hai Sect.</p><p>Coincidentally, a disciple of Hun Mo Laoren offered up his spirit, and Qin Sang, through soul-searching, learned of a connection between Jiu Jie Island and the Jing Hai Sect.  He then personally went there and subdued Jiu Jie Island.</p><p>He discovered information from the texts left by Jiu Jie Zhenren.</p><p>Among them was a description of this artifact, the Qian Huan Mirror.</p><p>It's an unparalleled escape tool. Seeing Yan Shan Laoren using it, Qin Sang gave up the chase.</p><p>Its only drawback is the need for prior preparation.</p><p>Yan Shan Laoren was cautious; neither his disguise nor the Tianmu butterfly exposed his actions.</p><p>Jiu Jie Zhenren, upon discovering the remains of a Jing Hai Sect monk, obtained his belongings, including a damaged Qian Huan Mirror.  Unable to repair it due to a lack of knowledge, he used it twice before it shattered completely.</p><p>The Jing Hai Sect was founded by Xiao Xiangzi, and its legacy was also left by him.</p><p>Yan Shan Laoren also possessed a Qian Huan Mirror.</p><p>Yan Shan Laoren received the Water phase inheritance of the Wu Xiang Immortal Sect, making him a kind of disciple.  The Qian Huan Mirror likely originated from the Wu Xiang Immortal Sect.</p><p>Unfortunately, he had fallen out with Yan Shan Laoren, so he could not ask him any questions.</p><p>Even if Xiao Xiangzi wasn't from the Wu Xiang Immortal Sect, he had a strong connection to it!</p><p>Thinking further, could the two killing swords also come from the Wu Xiang Immortal Sect?</p><p>Qin Sang felt a surge of joy. His many years of investigation had yielded nothing, yet his trip to the Northern Wasteland brought an unexpected gain.</p><p>Of course, Qin Sang knew it was too early to celebrate.</p><p>If Xiao Xiangzi came from the Wu Xiang Immortal Sect, given his loyalty and sense of justice—he even mentioned the Xie family in his letter—why didn't he mention the Wu Xiang Immortal Sect?</p><p>And the Wu Xiang Immortal Sect had vanished from the cultivation world long ago.</p><p>Finding descendants of the Wu Xiang Immortal Sect wouldn't be easy.</p><p>While the main body pondered, the avatar continued to work.</p><p>Only one jade box remained on the ice bed.</p><p>The seal had been mostly broken by Yan Shan Laoren, so the avatar easily took it and gave it to the main body.</p><p>Upon opening it, there were two pills inside.</p><p>Without any markings, their purpose was unknown.</p><p>Round and snow-white, without any impurities, a faint, cool fragrance reached Qin Sang's nose. After a slight sniff, a refreshing coolness spread through his heart, making him feel comfortable.</p><p>"It doesn't smell like poison. I wonder what its effect is…"</p><p>Qin Sang mused to himself.</p><p>He knew little of alchemy and couldn't make a judgment.</p><p>The Water Aspect Master's relic must be very valuable.</p><p>There are only two pills.  Letting the secondary body test them is risky; if they don't enhance cultivation, it would be a waste. I'll investigate the Wu Xiang Sect later; there will be opportunities.</p><p>Qin Sang put the pills and the Shouzhen Pill together, then looked at the inscription on the wall, his expression growing grave.</p><p>From the writing, Qin Sang sensed the Water Aspect Master's intense resentment.  Most of it was directed at two people, accusing them of betrayal, taking advantage of a vulnerable situation, and attacking him.</p><p>One was named Huang Xi, the other Liao Su.</p><p>"Liao Su..."</p><p>"Liao Su..."</p><p>Qin Sang frowned,  He seemed to have heard the name before. After some thought, he finally remembered: a Grand Master of the Ganlu Monastery had the dharma name Liao Su!</p><p>Master Liao Su was a highly accomplished cultivator, the one who revived Ganlu Monastery and built its great legacy. It is said that the current state of Central State also owes him a debt.</p><p>"If it really is Master Liao Su, could the other one, Huang Xi, be the Patriarch of the Eight Views...?"</p><p>Qin Sang felt he'd stumbled upon a Central State secret.</p><p>His gaze fell on the last line:  "He who inherits my mantle shall slaughter Buddhas and destroy the Dao!"</p><p>The hatred was palpable.</p><p>The killing intent was overwhelming!</p><p>Unfortunately, despite all the Water Aspect Master's preparations, he didn't live to see a true successor. Qin Sang couldn't follow his orders, and Elder Yan Shan didn't even glance at the place.</p><p>No wonder the Wu Xiang Sect seemed deliberately hidden; it was impossible to find useful information before. If the Eight Views and Ganlu Monastery were behind it, everything made sense.</p><p>What roles did the Eight Views and Ganlu Monastery play in the Wu Xiang Sect's destruction?</p><p>Perhaps they rose to power on the sect's corpse.</p><p>Their actions were likely unsavory, which is why they sought to completely eliminate the Wu Xiang Sect, wishing to erase it from the cultivation world.</p><p>With no one remembering the Wu Xiang Sect, no one would discuss the past.</p><p>Realizing this, Qin Sang knew he couldn't openly investigate the Wu Xiang Sect, lest he attract the attention of the Eight Views and Ganlu Monastery.</p><p>Conversely, they must know the Wu Xiang Sect best. When other channels yield no information, he would need to contact them.</p><p>He would verify these things later.</p><p>His main body turned to the ice disk.  It was the only unusual item in the tomb; the ice bed was ordinary, merely enhanced by the Water Aspect Master's restrictions.</p><p>His secondary body, working with the Heavenly Eye Butterfly, had largely deciphered the spirit array's patterns.</p><p>'Swish swish swish...'</p><p>His main body summoned the Nine Netherworld Demon Fire, condensing it into dozens of thumb-thick fire ropes that rained down on the eight corners of the array, piercing the surface's spiritual light and wreaking havoc within.</p><p>The same scene repeated.  The chilling煞氣 coalesced into ice blades.</p><p>But before the blades formed, Qin Sang used his phoenix wings to teleport to the other side of the tomb, leaving behind only an afterimage.</p><p>The array's counterattack had no effect on him.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The secondary body seized the opportunity, cleaving the array with his sword, reaching in to securely grasp and retrieve the ice disk.</p><p>Without the ice disk, the array instantly dimmed and its energy dissipated.</p><p>Qin Sang inwardly praised, "Such pure chilling煞氣! So this treasure was the source! Using this, refining the Ice Soul Divine Light will be no problem..."</p><p>With the Lu Ye threat still present, he couldn't linger.</p><p>Without lingering to examine it closely, Qin Sang put away the ice disk, the secondary body merged with his main body, and he instantly flew out of the tomb.  He stopped suddenly, turned, and unleashed his sword.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>A powerful sword beam pierced the tomb. The tomb's restrictions, already damaged, couldn't hold and collapsed, erasing all traces.</p><p>Qin Sang flew out of the fissure, confirmed there were no enemies outside, concealed his aura, and secretly fled under the cover of the snow.</p><p>Shortly after Qin Sang's departure, Su Zi Nan arrived, following the trail to the supposed tomb. He only found two piles of rubble, empty and devoid of people, the treasures long gone.</p><p>He spread his divine sense, discovering some clues, but they vanished shortly after.</p><p>Su Zi Nan sneered. He murdered Old Wu quickly, but these people were faster than he expected.  He didn't regret it, though; the Three Corpse Death God Banner was paramount, and using late-stage Nascent Souls as sacrifices for the banner was the best start.</p><p>"Just who was that guy? The current Fire Aspect Master?"</p><p>Through the evil banner, Su Zi Nan learned the details of Old Wu's battle with Qin Sang.</p><p>He wandered the snowfield, finding nothing.</p><p>Meanwhile, Qin Sang returned the way he came, hurrying back to Elder Yan Shan's Daoist grounds.</p><p>As expected, Elder Yan Shan wasn't there; this sort of cave dwelling could be abandoned at any time.</p><p>Qin Sang circled the mountain briefly, then left without delay, heading home.</p>
