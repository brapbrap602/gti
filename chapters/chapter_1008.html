<h1>Chapter 1000: A Decade's Pact</h1><p>Chapter 1000: A Decade's Pact</p><p>Inside the cave dwelling.</p><p>Qin Sang had just sat down when she asked, "I wonder what relationship Daoist Ning and Senior Qingzhu have?"</p><p>Ning Wuhuai was only at the Core Formation stage. Qin Sang guessed he might be Senior Qingzhu's disciple.</p><p>As if guessing Qin Sang's thoughts, Ning Wuhuai said, "Senior never truly accepted disciples, but all cultivators who have received his kindness on Linggui Island treat him with the respect due a master. When and where did you meet him?"</p><p>Ning Wuhuai leaned forward slightly, his tone urgent.</p><p>"Last time, during the opening of the Seven Killing Hall, in the Heavenly Tower…"</p><p>Qin Sang did not hide anything, describing the scene when she met Senior Qingzhu.</p><p>"Senior Qingzhu wasn't in good shape. Another consciousness within him was dominant, bloodthirsty, cruel, and utterly demonic, like a demonic soul."</p><p>Hearing this, the expectant look in Ning Wuhuai's eyes gradually faded, his brows furrowed.  He fell silent for a long time. "He didn't ask you to bring any message?"</p><p>"No."</p><p>Qin Sang shook her head. "At that time, Senior could only temporarily suppress the other consciousness, and it was very strenuous. He wanted to condense a crystal bead for me to bring back to Daoist Ning, but it was destroyed by the other consciousness. Moreover, he couldn't reveal true secrets, he couldn't even think freely, for fear the other consciousness would pick up his thoughts."</p><p>"I see, thank you for bringing back this news."</p><p>Ning Wuhuai took a deep breath, bowed to Qin Sang, then changed his tone and asked, "Daoist Qin has personally come to visit, you must have other important matters?"</p><p>Qin Sang had many questions, but seeing that Ning Wuhuai didn't seem willing to explain, she didn't press further, stating her purpose. "Daoist Ning's perceptiveness is keen.  I indeed have something I wanted to ask Senior Qingzhu, but Senior Qingzhu is unable to answer, so he instructed me to find you."</p><p>"Oh?"</p><p>Ning Wuhuai was somewhat surprised. "Please tell me, Daoist Qin. I will be completely honest."</p><p>"In the inner hall of the Seven Killing Hall, there's a teleportation array that is very important to me. Only Senior Qingzhu knows the location of the ancient teleportation array…"</p><p>Since she was asking for help, Qin Sang couldn't hide anything and could only tell the truth.</p><p>Ning Wuhuai could gain Senior Qingzhu's trust; he should be reliable.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Ning Wuhuai looked troubled. "Daoist Qin might have misunderstood. I don't know much about the Seven Killing Hall, and I've never heard Senior mention a teleportation array."</p><p>Qin Sang's heart sank.</p><p>Ning Wuhuai's expression didn't seem fake.</p><p>Senior Qingzhu was trapped by the demonic soul, and it was unknown how long it would take for him to break free.</p><p>Ning Wuhuai knew nothing about this.</p><p>If Senior Qingzhu couldn't suppress the demonic soul, would she never be able to return?</p><p>The grievances and hatred in Xiaohan Domain were secondary.  She was now at the late Core Formation stage, and her cultivation techniques and spiritual sword were no longer a problem; she was about to face the Nascent Soul bottleneck.</p><p>Everything was ready except for the east wind; the Nine Illusory Sky Orchid was very important to her.</p><p>Ning Wuhuai stood up and paced back and forth, seeming to be pondering something important.</p><p>After a moment, he said to Qin Sang, "Senior must have had a reason for sending Daoist Qin to me. In that case, I have no reason to hide it. The next time the Seven Killing Hall opens, I must go to the inner hall myself. If I'm not mistaken, he might want Daoist Qin and me to enter the Seven Killing Hall together."</p><p>"Is this Senior Qingzhu's intention?"</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes lit up, suddenly thinking of something, she exclaimed in surprise, "In the inner hall, is there a way to help Senior suppress the demonic soul, to solve this problem?"</p><p>Ning Wuhuai shook his head. "I don't know much, I'm just following orders. If Daoist Qin is willing to go with me, we will meet at a designated place before the Seven Killing Hall opens. However, the interval between the openings of the Seven Killing Hall has been significantly shortened again. It's rumored that the next time it opens on its own will be in over ten years. Daoist Qin should prepare early. The Seven Killing Hall is not a benevolent place, especially the inner hall, which is a dangerous place that even Nascent Soul masters fear…"</p><p>"Over ten years, so soon?"</p><p>Qin Sang was startled; this was a huge surprise.</p><p>She thought she would have to wait another fifty years, by which time her cultivation would be close to the peak of the Core Formation stage, and she could return to Xiaohan Domain and start preparing for Nascent Soul stage.</p><p>"I heard this from a Nascent Soul master in my sect, it should be true. The Seven Killing Hall is opening more frequently, it's hard to say what will happen in the future."</p><p>Ning Wuhuai sighed.</p><p>Qin Sang subconsciously tapped the table with her finger, lost in thought for a long time.</p><p>She really didn't expect the Seven Killing Hall to open so soon, all her plans were suddenly disrupted.</p><p>Ten years wasn't enough time to refine a new external avatar.</p><p>She also needed to return to the Demon Sea to capture a spirit beast; there wouldn't be time to be picky.</p><p>The most important thing during this period wasn't cultivation.</p><p>Her cultivation and physique had just broken through; even with ten years of intense cultivation, her strength wouldn't make a quantum leap.</p><p>She could collect some scarce resources from Xiaohan Domain, making a fortune upon her return, such as demon cores, demon bones, and煞妖丹 (sha yao dan -  a type of demon pill).</p><p>The Shayao Pill, with its remarkable efficacy in increasing the chances of forming a Golden Core, will definitely fetch a high price – excellent value for money.  However, when selling it, I absolutely must not reveal my identity; otherwise, I'll be in serious trouble.</p><p>These thoughts flickered through my mind before Qin Sang suppressed them.</p><p>Whether I can return to Xiaohan Region remains uncertain.</p><p>Afterwards, the two of them had a long private conversation.</p><p>Two days later, Ning Wu Hui personally escorted Qin Sang down the mountain.</p><p>After bidding farewell to Ning Wu Hui, Qin Sang flew a distance, surveyed the surroundings, then altered course, disappearing into a mountain range.</p><p>Soon, Qin Sang arrived before a dense forest.</p><p>As the遁光 (light) arrived, Bai’s voice echoed from within, “Friend, what were the results of your trip?”</p><p>Before the words were finished, Bai emerged from the forest. Glancing behind Qin Sang to ensure there were no pursuers, Bai gestured towards the forest, and dozens of beams of light flew out, vanishing into Bai’s palm.</p><p>To be safe, before leaving, Qin Sang and Bai carefully laid out a spirit array.  It was intended to delay any pursuing Yuan Ying masters, but it proved unnecessary.</p><p>Qin Sang moved swiftly, landing before Bai. “I met the main person and have some leads on the ancient teleportation array. However, there’s news, whether good or bad, that Seven Killing Hall might appear in ten-odd years…”</p><p>Bai was taken aback by the news. “So, in ten years, you might be able to return to Xiaohan Region?”</p><p>“It depends on what arrangements Senior Qingzhu has made and whether I can resolve the hidden dangers within Senior Qingzhu's body.”</p><p>Qin Sang hesitated before asking, “What are your plans, Bai? Will you accompany me to Xiaohan Region to find a way to break the Heavenly Corpse Talisman, or will you remain in the Canglang Sea to search for your memories?”</p><p>The teleportation array is located within the Seven Killing Hall. Only when the Seven Killing Hall emerges can one travel between the two places. If unforeseen changes occur in the Seven Killing Hall, this passage may be severed.</p><p>Bai’s origins are inextricably linked to the Seven Killing Hall, which is near the Canglang Sea; the chances of recovering their memories there are far greater than elsewhere.</p>
