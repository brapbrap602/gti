<h1>Chapter 2107  Mind Your Own Business</h1><p>Qin Sang and Ji Hong received a message from Si Lu and immediately set off, arriving ahead of time at Storm Realm to make arrangements.  This time, only Yuan Miao was sent by the Zhu Yan tribe; Si Lu accompanied him.  They kept a low profile, avoiding the Chang You tribe and other races, and arrived at Storm Realm undetected.</p><p>They landed in the Western Lands, where the scars of the war between the two tribes were everywhere.  The devastation was evident, a testament to the bitter feud.</p><p>The Western Lands were a desolate expanse of sand and dust, even the oases deserted. Although the Chang You tribe had retreated, the cultivators of the Western Lands hadn’t rushed back, still wary of a renewed attack – a fact confirmed by Qin Sang’s words at the Qing Yang Temple ceremony.</p><p>After traveling through the desert for a while, they sensed the presence of cultivators.</p><p>“Slower,”</p><p>Yuan Miao said.</p><p>They slowed their pace.  In the distance, they saw an oasis with a Buddhist temple, but no civilians.  The temple glowed with golden light, its doors closed, peaceful and serene. Yet, with their cultivation, they sensed many cultivators within, and a tense atmosphere.</p><p>“This is a branch temple of the Great Compassion Zen Temple,” Si Lu explained.</p><p>The temple served as an outpost.  Si Lu didn’t elaborate, knowing Yuan Miao understood.</p><p>Yuan Miao nodded without speaking.  They continued onward, encountering several more similar temples.  Eventually, they saw ordinary people working diligently –  very close to the Great Compassion Zen Temple, an area untouched by the war, prosperous and thriving.</p><p>“I didn’t expect so many outsiders here; I was completely unaware,” Yuan Miao exclaimed in surprise.</p><p>Si Lu glanced at him.  Yuan Miao had been quiet on their journey, inscrutable.  His tone and expression now seemed to indicate no hostility towards humanity.</p><p>“This way, Daoist Yuan.  This array leads to the Central Plains.  Brother Qin should be waiting,” Si Lu gestured, leading Yuan Miao toward an ancient teleportation array.</p><p>Guards stationed at the array, already informed, stood in formation and bowed.  They were carefully selected to please the Zhu Yan tribe – seasoned veterans, eager for battle.</p><p>Yuan Miao’s eyes lit up. He praised their appearance and bearing.</p><p>Once on the array, a flash of light, and they appeared in the Central Plains.  Qin Sang was waiting, laughing heartily.  “Daoist Yuan, long time no see.”</p><p>“Daoist Qin!”</p><p>Yuan Miao's eyes brightened. He stepped forward, gripping Qin Sang’s arm excitedly.  “Since our last meeting, I’ve been longing to see you!”</p><p>Li Yu Fu and the others looked on in surprise.</p><p>Qin Sang silently scoffed; such words from this old monkey were truly awkward.</p><p>He smiled, “Our last battle was beneficial to me; I discovered many flaws in my skills.”</p><p>Yuan Miao’s eyes gleamed.  “Indeed!  We should fight again!”</p><p>Qin Sang and Si Lu exchanged a glance; Yuan Miao’s attitude was revealing.</p><p>Qin Sang relaxed, “I’ve been improving since then, but my skills haven’t improved significantly. Another fight would not provide much excitement.”</p><p>“No matter! No matter!”</p><p>Yuan Miao shook his head. “Since our last meeting, I’ve been pondering how to counter your Golden Sun Technique, and I’ve made some progress. I want to test it against you.”</p><p>Qin Sang was curious about Yuan Miao’s method, but this wasn't the time. “Daoist Yuan, your mission is crucial; it’s a matter of life and death for us. I can’t relax until this is resolved.  We can spar later.”</p><p>“Right! Right! Exactly!”</p><p>Yuan Miao wasn’t being unreasonable; he was simply excited.</p><p>Reminded by Qin Sang, he remembered his tribe's instructions, his expression turning serious.  Surrounded by Qin Sang and others, he flew toward Qing Yang Temple.</p><p>On the way, Yuan Miao subtly observed Li Yu Fu and the others, confirming their respect for Qin Sang was genuine.</p><p>Soon, they reached Qing Yang Temple.  The gates were open wide, bathed in auspicious light; cultivators stood in formation, bells and drums resonated – even grander than the previous ceremony.</p><p>Amidst the greetings, Yuan Miao surveyed the temple, finally looking up at Lu Ye in the clouds, his eyes narrowed.</p><p>After a moment's silence, he leaned towards Qin Sang, whispering something before they, along with Si Lu, flew towards Luye and landed before the statue.</p><p>The statue was weathered, yet possessed a smooth, almost jade-like quality.  Even without cultivating the Great Path, cultivators of their level could sense its extraordinary aura.  Yuan Miao immediately recognized it wasn't newly erected.</p><p>"Is this statue... of Daoist Qin?" Yuan Miao asked, turning to Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded. "To be honest, I did some insignificant things in the past, yet they were remembered by the world. People thought I was dead, so they erected this statue."</p><p>"To be revered as a saint, one must spend a lifetime cultivating and benefiting the land. Daoist Qin is too modest," Yuan Miao shook his head.</p><p>Qin Sang gazed at the statue in silence.  His status as a 'saint' was largely due to chance. However, as long as it protected the Storm Realm, the title was well-deserved.</p><p>His understanding of the Great Path was still developing.  At the Qingyang Temple ceremony, Qin Sang had inspired loyalty through both reward and punishment, but his cultivation hadn't advanced significantly.</p><p>Reflecting on his cultivation journey since achieving the Void Refinement stage, Qin Sang had an epiphany.  The Great Path of Slaughter – it was the Great Path, and it was the path of slaughter.</p><p>His use of the Thunder Altar at Yue Du Bay to annihilate the冥鹘老祖 and drive back the Yun Du Mountain forces, bringing peace to the land, had suddenly illuminated many principles within the *Ziwei Sword Scripture*. He was only a step away from the mid-Void Refinement stage, allowing him to break through upon seeing the statue.</p><p>This significant breakthrough came from two things: protecting the people, thus walking the Great Path; and more importantly, his audacity in facing two veteran Void Refinement cultivators, leaders of powerful factions, shortly after his own breakthrough and recovery from injury.</p><p>Cultivating the *Ziwei Sword Scripture* ultimately hinges on 'slaughter'.  Each vanquished opponent refines one's courage, beliefs, and pursuit of the Dao.</p><p>Facing strong enemies for the sake of those under his protection, the stronger the foe, the greater the self-improvement.  Simultaneously, the more powerful the enemy and the more desperate the protected, the greater their gratitude and reverence upon salvation.</p><p>Thus, protecting the Storm Realm and repelling powerful foes was also a journey of enlightenment for Qin Sang.</p><p>Si Lu didn't know, but upon completing the Thunder Altar, Qin Sang actually hoped the Si You clan's strong cultivators would come looking for trouble.  Of course, the Storm Realm was special, imbued with Liuli's efforts, and Qin Sang wouldn't recklessly jeopardize it.  If a peaceful resolution were possible, he preferred it.</p><p>As for enlightenment, he had ample lifespan; there was no rush. He could always seek another suitable place of cultivation; exploitation and oppression were ubiquitous in the Great Thousand World.</p><p>Yuan Miao didn't realize how many thoughts had crossed Qin Sang's mind in such a short time.  After confirming Qin Sang's identity, Yuan Miao solemnly stated, "I ask you again, Daoist Qin, have you decided to lead the Storm Continent under the protection of Daoist Si?"</p><p>Qin Sang answered seriously, "Indeed!"</p><p>"Good. Since it's your own decision, our clan will not interfere excessively." Yuan Miao turned to Si Lu. "Daoist Si wishes to find a place of cultivation, which conforms to the ancient alliance's conventions. However, remember not to cause needless trouble; otherwise, I will personally expel you."</p><p>Si Lu glanced at Qin Sang.  "Qin Xiong and the Chang You clan have a prior feud. If they return, our counterattack wouldn't be considered needless trouble, would it?"</p><p>"Of course not. But we hope your feud doesn't cause too much collateral damage. I plan to visit the Chang You clan to attempt mediation. What is your stance?"  Yuan Miao fixed his gaze on Qin Sang.</p><p>This was essentially gaining the Zhu Yan clan's approval, allowing the Storm Realm to establish itself legitimately. Furthermore, from Yuan Miao's tone, the Zhu Yan clan not only wouldn't side with the Chang You, but also seemed to wish to prevent other royal clans from getting involved.</p><p>This was precisely the outcome Qin Sang had hoped for by seeking refuge with Si Lu.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered, "We are outsiders, alone in the Mist Sea; we naturally wouldn't want to initiate conflict. If the Chang You clan is willing to compromise, I will give it serious consideration."</p><p>"Good," Yuan Miao's expression softened; he felt confident in persuading the Chang You clan. He then inquired about the details of the previous confrontation.</p><p>Qin Sang mentioned Zai Zhen's name.</p><p>Yuan Miao frowned. "When did this youngster become acquainted with the Chang You clan?  Who else was there?"</p><p>Qin Sang described the person who had intervened on behalf of Su Nu.</p><p>"Since he's sticking his neck out for others, why hide his identity? I want to see who this person really is!" Yuan Miao snorted, deeply displeased.</p><p>Afterwards, Qin Sang invited Yuan Miao to visit the main peak.</p><p>After the banquet, Yuan Miao rose and said, "I shall write a letter inviting the Chieftain Min Zhuo for a meeting.  Friend Qin, where do you think would be suitable?"</p><p>Qin Sang replied, "Between our tribe and the Chang You, there's a Flame Island, perfectly situated in the middle."</p><p>"Excellent, that's the place!"</p><p>Yuan Miao sent a message that night, but remained behind to spar with Qin Sang. Qin Sang, in return for his hospitality, obliged, and both gained much from the exchange.  Yuan Miao researched ways to decipher the Sun Wheel Seal, though with limited success, he did help Qin Sang identify some weaknesses.</p><p>Unfortunately, Qin Sang had grasped the true meaning of the *Purple Micro Sword Scripture*, making it his main focus. The *Celestial Demon Transformation* would have to take a backseat, leaving him a long way from breaking through to the mid-stage.</p><p>After a month of waiting, the message was like a stone thrown into the sea; the Chang You tribe gave no response, not even a reply.</p><p>Everyone found this unusual.</p><p>In the great hall, gathered together, Yuan Miao speculated, "Could Chieftain Min Zhuo think I'm acting without the tribe's knowledge, not representing the Zhu Yan?  Perhaps he suspects I've been bought off by you all, harboring ill intentions towards them, a misunderstanding?"</p><p>"Master Yuan's deduction isn't unreasonable. It seems a personal visit is necessary," Si Lu said.</p><p>"Very well, I shall go.  You two might as well wait at Flame Island for now," Yuan Miao said.</p><p>"Agreed!"</p><p>Qin Sang and the others set off immediately.</p><p>They sailed from the Western Lands, heading southwest, crossing the vast ocean, until they saw a fiery red island.  The redness came from the island's rocks, but at its center was a volcano, its magma churning, threatening to erupt at any moment.</p><p>Qin Sang and Si Lu landed on the island and watched Yuan Miao depart, patiently waiting.</p><p>…</p><p>Chang You tribe, Sacred Lake.</p><p>Yuan Miao arrived at the Sacred Lake without delay.</p><p>Although the Chang You were a small tribe, a vassal of the Zhu Yan, their lineage stemmed from ancient times. In the ancient pact, each tribe was equal.</p><p>Yuan Miao adjusted his robes, produced the credentials of a Zhu Yan elder, carefully wrote a formal invitation, and cast it into the Sacred Lake.</p><p>The invitation transformed into a stream of light, disappearing into the lake's formation.</p><p>Soon, the water curtain parted, several figures flashing towards them.  Leading them was Min Shu, Min Zhuo's son, followed by Chang You elders.</p><p>Min Shu glanced at the standing Yuan Miao, his expression nervous, quickly approaching and bowing deeply.</p><p>"We didn't know a distinguished envoy from the superior tribe was arriving, we failed to greet you properly, please forgive us!"</p><p>Yuan Miao frowned, "Who are you?"</p><p>"I am Min Shu, son of Chieftain Min Zhuo.  My father is in seclusion, and I'm acting on his behalf."</p><p>Min Shu replied respectfully.</p><p>"You're acting chieftain, yet you haven't received my message?" Yuan Miao questioned.</p><p>Min Shu was startled, exclaiming, "That message was from the esteemed envoy? I'm inexperienced and dared not act without permission, so I sent it to my father's residence for him to open. But my father has been in seclusion, hence the delay. Please punish me!"</p><p>Yuan Miao grunted, but didn't want to take it out on a junior, saying, "I've come on important business to discuss with Chieftain Min Zhuo. Quickly inform him."</p><p>"This…"</p><p>Min Shu hesitated, "My father recently broke through, and is at a crucial stage of consolidating his cultivation. I'm unsure if he can emerge immediately.  I beg the envoy to enter the Sacred Lake, while we offer our humble hospitality."</p><p>Yuan Miao understood, figuring it wouldn't hurt to let Qin Sang and the others wait a bit longer, and said, "The Sacred Lake is your tribe's sacred ground, I won't intrude. I prefer the serenity of mountains and springs, this place suits me well.  Please go and inform him."</p><p>He then sat down by the spring, closing his eyes.</p><p>The others dared not leave, sending Min Shu to report while they remained, ordering the tribe to bring forth fruit and wine.</p><p>By evening, Min Shu returned, his face filled with apprehension, reporting, "My father remains in seclusion, without response."</p><p>Yuan Miao hummed, his expression unchanged.</p><p>This went on for ten days, Min Shu reporting daily, but Min Zhuo still gave no response.</p><p>On the tenth day, Min Shu's voice trembled.</p><p>Yuan Miao abruptly rose, a hint of anger flashing in his eyes.</p><p>Min Zhuo was consolidating his cultivation, not seeking a breakthrough. Even if he were at a critical juncture, unable to immediately emerge, sending a thought to explain the situation would be entirely possible.</p><p>He was deliberately avoiding him!</p><p>Min Zhuo must have guessed his intentions, but stubbornly refused to negotiate with Qin Sang's group.</p><p>The Zhu Yan sent an envoy, yet he risked offending the envoy, refusing even to meet, clearly making up his mind.  He was certain of the Zhu Yan's nature, that they wouldn't resort to force or coercion.</p><p>If so, Yuan Miao staying would only bring humiliation.</p><p>"Manage yourselves!"</p><p>Yuan Miao left with a flick of his sleeve.</p><p>()</p>
