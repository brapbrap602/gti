<h1>Chapter 1566: Late Nascent Soul</h1><p>Qin Sang's avatar returned to the Clear Void Illusion Realm and immediately activated the restrictions, personally guarding the entrance to the cave dwelling.</p><p>Ten days later.</p><p>The avatar suddenly stood up and looked towards the sky.</p><p>The sky was high and the clouds were light.</p><p>Located at the summit of Mount Pu, the Clear Void Illusion Realm offered an unobstructed view of the outside world.</p><p>After Qin Sang ordered Mount Pu to be closed, Xie An had been very busy these days, arranging various matters in Fudù Prefecture and recalling the Xie family disciples.</p><p>At this moment, a few youths returned together, chatting and laughing as they flew to the sect gate. The disciples guarding the gate opened the entrance for them, exchanging greetings and talking about recent events inside and outside the sect.</p><p>Their conversation was lively, and none of them noticed the celestial phenomena changing within the Clear Void Illusion Realm.</p><p>First, a gentle breeze blew.</p><p>The wind grew stronger and stronger.</p><p>‘Rustle…’</p><p>Leaves fell like rain.</p><p>These leaves were still green, not yet the season for them to fall. They were forcibly broken from their branches, and the grass and trees in the forest were flattened, completely destroying the previous beautiful scenery.</p><p>The gale converged in mid-air, and the sky gradually darkened, as if covered by a layer of dark clouds.</p><p>The area above the cave dwelling was the darkest.</p><p>These were not real clouds, but a celestial phenomenon formed by the extreme concentration of spiritual energy. The spiritual energy in the void was converging there, its speed increasing rapidly.</p><p>The avatar quickly glanced around, confirming that the anomaly would not affect the outside world, then withdrew its gaze and focused on the cave dwelling.</p><p>Within a few breaths, a visible tide of spiritual energy appeared above the cave dwelling, vast and magnificent. Immediately afterward, with a sudden tremor, the entire Clear Void Illusion Realm shook, and a sharp whistling sound echoed.</p><p>The spiritual energy suddenly surged upwards, then crashed down.</p><p>A waterfall formed of spiritual energy appeared in the void, pouring into the cave dwelling!</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The cave dwelling trembled violently, and the restrictions shone, casting multicolored light onto the avatar's face.</p><p>The avatar's expression shifted slightly, its gaze fixed on the center of the cave dwelling.</p><p>The next moment, the spiritual energy waterfall suddenly reversed, and a figure appeared within it, rising against the current and rushing into the center of the spiritual energy. Not only was the figure unharmed, but its body absorbed all the spiritual energy like a whale gulping down water.</p><p>The celestial phenomenon appeared and disappeared just as quickly.</p><p>Revealing the true body.</p><p>The true body floated in mid-air, eyes closed, motionless.</p><p>This stillness didn't last long.</p><p>The true body likely hadn't fully refined the absorbed spiritual energy yet, when its aura suddenly began to surge, its momentum powerful and continuously climbing.</p><p>But the surge didn’t last.</p><p>The breakthrough momentum abruptly stopped, evidently encountering a bottleneck.</p><p>The true body let out a cold snort, and its aura, only stagnant for a moment, suddenly surged again. The so-called bottleneck only caused this slight hindrance before being broken through by the true body's momentum.</p><p>Late Nascent Soul achieved!</p><p>“Hahaha…”</p><p>Joyful laughter echoed through the Clear Void Illusion Realm.</p><p>The true body stood in mid-air, robes billowing, a look of satisfaction between its brows as it laughed heartily towards the heavens.</p><p>Hard work pays off.</p><p>After more than a hundred years of secluded cultivation, enduring boundless loneliness, today finally brought a breakthrough!</p><p>To this day, less than three hundred years had passed since Qin Sang formed his Nascent Soul, and the first Four Nine Heavenly Tribulation was still two to three decades away.</p><p>If this were to spread, it would surely create a huge uproar in the cultivation world.</p><p>Even those cultivators of the super sects in the Central Continent, with resources at their fingertips, rarely achieved such results.  Each one was an unparalleled genius.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>The laughter stopped abruptly, and the true body appeared beside the avatar. They exchanged a smile. The second Nascent Soul returned to the true body, all that had happened during these years now known to the true body.</p><p>Qin Sang absentmindedly browsed through the various news, still reminiscing about the experiences of his hundred-year seclusion.</p><p>After obtaining the Clear Void Illusion Realm, the true body set up the cave dwelling and began its seclusion, this being the first time it had emerged.</p><p>The tediousness of cultivation went without saying.</p><p>Twenty years ago, upon sensing the bottleneck of the Late Nascent Soul stage, Qin Sang began to prepare for the breakthrough.  Before that, he naturally needed to review his previous cultivation path, filling in gaps, consolidating his realm, and adjusting his state to perfection.</p><p>This process went very smoothly.</p><p>He could barely be considered a cultivator of essence, energy, and spirit, his foundation more solid than other cultivators.</p><p>More than ten years ago, Qin Sang had a premonition that he could attempt a breakthrough, with a considerable chance of success.</p><p>However, such a rapid pace made Qin Sang feel a little uneasy. He had no worries about the Heavenly Tribulation or lifespan, so after some thought, he decided to consolidate for a while longer, ensuring absolute certainty.</p><p>After ten years of accumulating momentum, he charged at the bottleneck with all his might, and it was indeed a natural success!</p><p>The Cleansing Pool and the Slaughter Talismans increased his cultivation speed but didn't change his innate talent.  The fact that it went so smoothly was largely due to the Buddha Bone Relic, and the role of the Fire Seed Golden Lotus couldn't be ignored either.</p><p>Reaching the realm of Divine Sense Manifestation in advance proved helpful for the breakthrough, once again confirming Senior Qingzhu's speculation from years ago.</p><p>Cultivating essence, energy, and spirit together was beneficial for breakthroughs.</p><p>Even in the Central Continent, Grand Cultivators were figures standing at the peak.  Nascent Soul cultivators were few and far between, and now they had mysteriously disappeared, leaving even fewer who could contend with Grand Cultivators.</p><p>Qin Sang was filled with pride as he looked inwards at his own body.</p><p>His Nascent Soul was more solidified, but it was, after all, just a minor realm advancement, unlike the qualitative leap between major realms.</p><p>The most obvious change was the increased depth of his True Essence.</p><p>Although he previously possessed strength comparable to Grand Cultivators, he was always restricted by his True Essence, either needing to end battles quickly or escape early.</p><p>Now, he no longer had such concerns.</p><p>Next was his Divine Sense.</p><p>Qin Sang had already achieved Divine Sense Manifestation, and after this breakthrough, with the improvement of his realm, his Divine Sense had also improved.</p><p>He could foresee that after breaking through to the Late Nascent Soul stage, his Divine Sense would definitely surpass that of ordinary Grand Cultivators. Such a significant change still surprised him greatly.</p><p>“Continue cultivating the Fire Seed Golden Lotus and refining the Demonic Flame. If all goes well, my Divine Sense has a chance to surpass the Nascent Soul stage and rival that of a Soul Formation cultivator!”</p><p>Qin Sang arrived at a conclusion that filled him with joy.</p><p>One must know that he had just broken through to the Late Nascent Soul stage, his realm not yet stabilized, and he already dared to harbor such ambitions, coveting the Soul Formation stage.</p><p>Even if it was only a breakthrough in Divine Sense, it was still shocking enough.</p><p>The Fire Seed Golden Lotus and the Nine Nether Demonic Flame, a top-tier divine ability and a rare spiritual flame, combined, would push him to unimaginable heights!</p><p>Not to mention the role of the Soul Nourishing Wood.</p><p>The benefits he had received from the Soul Nourishing Wood over time were immeasurable.</p><p>“If my Divine Sense breaks through again, rivaling the Soul Formation stage, would I be able to resist the Heavenly Dao suppression of Soul Formation cultivators?”</p><p>Qin Sang pondered this question.</p><p>The biggest difference between Nascent Soul and Soul Formation stemmed from this.</p><p>Qin Sang knew too little about the Soul Formation stage to conjure it out of thin air.</p><p>With this discovery, Qin Sang was now eager to return to continue his secluded cultivation, focusing on the Fire Seed Golden Lotus to see what level he could ultimately reach.</p><p>In his previous plan,</p><p>After breaking through to the Late Nascent Soul stage, Qin Sang planned to devote part of his energy to body refinement, cultivating the Demonic Physique Tempering Art.</p><p>After forming his Nascent Soul, he had barely cultivated this technique.</p><p>The Demonic Physique Tempering Art was still at the early stage of the fourth level, lagging far behind.</p><p>The Seven Masters Buddha Seal was a divine ability with both power and potential, but unfortunately, limited by his physical body, it was far inferior to Qin Sang's other methods and couldn't be effectively utilized in combat.</p><p>Cultivating essence, energy, and spirit, even if he didn't obtain a Soul Formation opportunity in the future, he could cultivate all three to their peak, increasing the probability of a breakthrough.</p><p>“I need to change my plans…”</p><p>Qin Sang rubbed his chin.</p><p>Soul Formation wasn't immediately urgent.</p><p>If his Divine Sense could break through, there would be countless benefits. Such a rare opportunity naturally took precedence. Even without considering the elusive Soul Formation cultivators, it would be enough to suppress cultivators of the same realm.</p><p>The winds of change were blowing in the Central Continent.</p><p>Qin Sang had always kept his avatar away from the turmoil, for one reason only—insufficient strength.</p><p>The accumulated power of the super sects in the Central Continent was absolutely terrifying. Moreover, some sects had more than one Grand Cultivator, with intricate relationships among them. Offending one could attract a whole group.</p><p>Compared to them, Qin Sang was alone and weak.  Only by becoming stronger could he have the qualifications to interfere in the world's affairs.</p><p>Putting aside these thoughts, Qin Sang focused his attention on other matters.</p><p>“Luye, Old Devil Lu.”</p><p>Qin Sang muttered to himself, then listed a few more terms, “Eight Sceneries Sect, True Monarch Danyu, Sweet Dew Monastery, Holy One Huiguang, Ghost Mother, the Yao Clans, the Gu God Sect, the South Sea Immortal Palace…”</p><p>These names, along with sects like the Unremembered Mountain, could roughly outline the distribution of power in the Central Continent.</p><p>However, many pieces were missing, preventing Qin Sang from connecting them.  A thick fog shrouded everything, obscuring his vision.</p><p>Where had the Soul Formation cultivators gone, and what were the Gu God Sect and Luye plotting?</p><p>After pondering for a long time,</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly chuckled.</p><p>Why was he thinking so much?</p><p>He had no ties in the Central Continent, free to come and go as he pleased.  As long as he remembered his purpose, he could adapt to any changes.</p><p>As for the Unrestrained Palace, Qin Sang not only wouldn't let his avatar go there, but his true body also had no intention of joining the excitement.</p><p>In his view, the Unrestrained Palace was likely to ignite the conflicts in the Central Continent.  The number of forces from the Red South Island Chain gathering openly and secretly was definitely astonishing.</p><p>His true body had just broken through to the Late stage and needed to stabilize its cultivation.</p><p>According to Cheng Weizi, those people had already locked onto the location of the Unrestrained Palace ruins. Going there now would probably be too late; it was better to wait for more news.</p><p>Afterwards,</p><p>Qin Sang left his avatar to guard the outside, contacted the Unremembered Mountain, and paid attention to the outcome of the Unrestrained Palace conflict.</p><p>His true body returned to the cave dwelling and continued its seclusion.</p><p>Besides cultivating, Qin Sang also needed to prepare for the Four Nine Heavenly Tribulation.</p><p>It was merely the first Heavenly Tribulation, and with his strength, there was no need to worry, but he couldn't be arrogant.</p><p>Especially before the Heavenly Tribulation arrived, the closer it got, the greater the pressure from the Heavenly Might that cultivators felt, which would affect them during combat.</p><p>Unless it was a major event, Qin Sang planned to keep his true body in seclusion until after the tribulation.</p><p>Back in the cave dwelling,</p><p>Qin Sang spent some time slightly stabilizing his cultivation, then eagerly summoned the Cloudroaming Sword.</p><p>A flash of light from his brow, and the Cloudroaming Sword appeared before Qin Sang.</p><p>The sword body was like jade, possessing a breathtaking beauty.</p><p>Qin Sang gazed at it for a long time, murmuring, “Old friend, it’s been a while.”</p><p>Bai had warned him that after accommodating Yunyouzi's True Spirit, he wouldn't be able to use the sword for a long time. He hadn't expected that he would already be a Grand Cultivator and still see no hope.</p><p>At the Mid Nascent Soul stage, Qin Sang had tried using the Essence Sacrifice Technique to refine the Cloudroaming Sword, but due to insufficient cultivation, he had repeatedly failed. Now, he decided to try again.</p><p>The Cloudroaming Sword trembled slightly and slowly landed in Qin Sang's palm.</p><p>Qin Sang placed his palms together, focusing his mind. The entire Essence Sacrifice Technique flashed through his mind.</p><p>A Natal Magic Treasure resonated with a cultivator's Dao and was their most important possession.</p><p>Through the Essence Sacrifice Technique, there was no need to search for various treasures; the cultivator only needed to expend energy and time to gradually improve it, refining it into a pseudo-spiritual treasure, or even a true spiritual treasure.</p><p>This alone was much less difficult than refining ordinary spiritual treasures.</p><p>Of course, this process was also very long.</p><p>Recalling the entire technique,</p><p>Qin Sang's mind connected with the Cloudroaming Sword. Part of his mind focused on the changes in Yunyouzi's True Spirit, while he began to circulate the Essence Sacrifice Technique.</p><p>At this moment, streaks of light appeared before Qin Sang, countless runes flashing and continuously entering the Cloudroaming Sword, all absorbed by it.</p><p>The runes were extremely complex, requiring the simultaneous mobilization of True Essence and Divine Sense.</p><p>The further he went, the more strenuous Qin Sang felt. At the Mid Nascent Soul stage, the final part of the Essence Sacrifice Technique exceeded his abilities, and he had been forced to give up every time he reached that point.</p><p>Now, it was clearly different.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>The last dozen or so runes were completed in one go.</p><p>A hazy light appeared on the surface of the Cloudroaming Sword, giving it a朦胧感.</p><p>Qin Sang let out a light breath, a joyful expression on his face. Without hesitation, he stored the Cloudroaming Sword into his Nascent Soul, circulating a secret technique and focusing on refining it.</p><p>The Essence Sacrifice Technique was extremely consuming.</p><p>In less than an hour, Qin Sang felt exhausted.</p><p>He came out of his meditative state, slowly ceasing his circulation, and sensing the Cloudroaming Sword.</p><p>There was a bloodline connection between a cultivator and their Natal Magic Treasure, and after refinement, it seemed to have become a bit closer, but Yunyouzi's True Spirit showed no obvious change.</p><p>At least, the Essence Sacrifice Technique wouldn't harm the True Spirit.</p><p>Confirming this, Qin Sang was relieved.</p><p>Next, Qin Sang adjusted his breath slightly and summoned the Fire Lotus Seeds and the Demonic Flame.  Refining the Demonic Flame after his Divine Sense had greatly increased, the speed was indeed faster than before.</p><p>…</p><p>While the true body was focused on refining the Demonic Flame,</p><p>The avatar finally received news from the Unremembered Mountain. It was Fu Han who personally delivered the invitation, and it wasn't just for him.  He was summoning all Nascent Soul forces under the Unremembered Mountain for a meeting.</p><p>Qin Sang closed the invitation, looked at Fu Han, and asked, “This poor Daoist hasn’t heard anything.  I didn’t expect the Unrestrained Palace matter to be over already.  I wonder when Patriarch Situ returned from the East Sea?  Patriarch Situ and Fellow Daoist Cheng Shenzi went out together, they must have gained quite a bit, right?”</p><p>It wouldn’t be long before this matter spread throughout the Central Continent.</p><p>Fu Han didn’t need to hide anything from Qin Sang. He shook his head and said, “Master and Martial Uncle returned empty-handed!  There were indeed strange phenomena near the Red South Island Chain, and it could basically be confirmed as the Unrestrained Palace ruins, but before anyone could enter, the entrance disappeared.”</p><p>“Oh?”</p><p>Qin Sang was startled, and asked in surprise, “And then?  They just gave up like that?”</p><p>Fu Han replied with a hum, “After the entrance disappeared, Master and the others searched everywhere but found nothing.  Actually, the strange phenomena lasted for a while, but it was very dangerous. Master had been observing from the outside. Unexpectedly, Patriarch Zilei of the Eight Sceneries Sect disregarded the danger and ventured in, only to be seriously injured. In the end, he couldn't even get past the outer restricted area. It is said that the Eight Sceneries Sect and the Sweet Dew Monastery lost several Nascent Soul cultivators inside.”</p><p>After a pause, Fu Han added, “Master said that the ruins of the Unrestrained Palace are a very dangerous place, even for Soul Formation cultivators.”</p>
