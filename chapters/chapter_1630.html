<h1></h1><p>Knowing that Lang Zhi was still unaware of the Scripture Repository's location, Qin Sang at least had a clear objective.  He memorized the inscriptions on the stone tablets, as well as their distribution.</p><p>He wondered if the layout of the teleportation formations had any connection to the various halls of the Boundless Immortal Sect. If a link existed, searching for Lang Zhi would become considerably easier.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't linger on the summit for long. He quietly descended the mountain and entered the stone beach.</p><p>Despite fully concealing his aura, he couldn't avoid detection by the flying sword formation. The moment he stepped onto the stone beach, his presence was exposed, and he was besieged by puppets.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't summon his Manifestation again.  Surrounded by puppets, his main body remained calm. The Golden-Sinking Sword hovered above his head, unleashing bursts of sword energy. However, his target wasn't the puppets, but the flying swords descending from above.</p><p>Under Qin Sang's precise control, the sword energy from the Golden-Sinking Sword was primarily defensive. Upon colliding with the flying swords, both would dissipate, minimizing any noticeable phenomena.</p><p>Simultaneously, Qin Sang manipulated the fire lotuses. Wherever the Nine Nether Demonic Fire passed, it carved a fiery path through the puppet horde. Once ignited by the demonic flames, the puppets found it nearly impossible to extinguish the flames, burning to ashes.</p><p>Handling the situation wasn't strenuous. Qin Sang moved with effortless grace, his speed increasing as he smoothly traversed the stone beach.</p><p>Though he hadn't yet found Zi Lei Zhenren or Yue Lingtian, Qin Sang knew they were not far apart.</p><p>Ascending another mountain peak, Qin Sang gazed intently towards the northeast.  The most prominent landmark lay in that direction, and it was likely that both the Scripture Repository and the Five Phases Halls of the Boundless Immortal Sect were located there.</p><p>But to Qin Sang's surprise, the path leading there showed no obvious unusual phenomena.</p><p>Instead, due north, the shadow of a sheer cliff loomed within the sea of clouds.  Flickering lights frequently flashed at the foot of the mountain, suggesting someone was assaulting a restrictive barrier.</p><p>Qin Sang observed both directions for a moment, then without much hesitation, flew north.</p><p>There had to be a reason why the Boundless Immortal Sect remnants chose the cliff first. The Immortal Halls were undoubtedly the most valuable secret of the Boundless Immortal Sect, and Qin Sang speculated that the entrance to the Halls might lie on that cliff!</p><p>By the time he arrived, the situation at the cliff should be nearing resolution.</p><p>The emergence of the Immortal Halls was an event not to be missed.</p><p>Qin Sang reflected on the major opportunities he had encountered on his cultivation path.  Almost all were intricately connected to the Purple Subtlety Palace and the Seven Slaughters Hall.  His foundational cultivation method even originated from the Immortal Halls!</p><p>He considered entering the Immortal Halls with his main body while leaving his Manifestation to search for Lang Zhi within the Boundless Immortal Sect.  Even with numerous Grand Cultivators present, his Manifestation could hold its own!</p><p>...</p><p>It was Zhu Wudao and his group assaulting the barrier.</p><p>The mountain was treacherous, a sheer vertical precipice.</p><p>Stone steps jutted out from the cliff face, leading in different directions and ultimately converging at the summit.  Pavilions and towers connected the steps, once intended for leisurely viewing. Now, they stood empty.</p><p>Unfortunately, the Boundless Immortal Sect was shrouded in mist, obscuring the magnificent scenery of its heyday.</p><p>Alongside Zhu Wudao remained the Wailing Souls Cave Master, Mo Xingdao, and the Swordsman.  The Qu Yangshan lineage hadn't entered in time, leaving Zhu Wudao short of allies. Yet, he seemed unconcerned about the Wailing Souls Cave Master and the others betraying him after entering the Tian Tong Hall.</p><p>He didn't inquire about the Swordsman's true identity, nor about the whereabouts of the Strange-Faced Man, the White-Robed Man, or Su Zinan. He focused solely on breaking the mountain's barrier.</p><p>The Wailing Souls Cave Master and the others silently assisted.</p><p>For a time, the atmosphere was somewhat peculiar. Yet, they cooperated effectively, ascending the mountain at a rapid pace.</p><p>Below the cliff, the void subtly distorted.</p><p>Zi Lei Zhenren and Yue Lingtian had followed.</p><p>Unlike Zi Lei Zhenren, Yue Lingtian appeared hesitant, glancing eastward from time to time.</p><p>He had promised to help Zi Lei Zhenren achieve his plan in exchange for his disciple's life and the opportunity to enter the Sword Tomb.</p><p>Another reason was his covetousness for the Earth Phase Hall's inheritance within the Boundless Immortal Sect. The Tai Yue Sect was founded on the *Thick Earth Record*. The inheritance was incomplete, and despite generations of ancestral masters' deductions, Yue Lingtian still believed it had flaws. If he could obtain the Earth Phase Hall's inheritance and compare the two, it might revolutionize the Tai Yue Sect.</p><p>Both were equally important to him and the Tai Yue Sect.</p><p>He and Hua Chenzi had divided their tasks. One would accompany Zi Lei Zhenren into the Tian Tong Hall, while the other would lead their people to plunder the Earth Phase Hall.  Unexpectedly, Hua Chenzi had been intercepted by Yun Long outside and remained unseen.</p><p>...</p><p>The White-Robed Man flew out of the stone beach, escaping the pursuit of the puppet army.</p><p>Beyond the stone beach, a mountain range blocked his path.</p><p>The mountain was eerily silent, devoid of birdsong or insect chirps. Intermittent flickering lights indicated the presence of numerous restrictive barriers.</p><p>From below, no grand halls or structures were visible on the mountain.  Its proximity to the mountain gate also suggested it wasn't a place of significant importance. No sect would store its most valuable treasures in such a location.</p><p>Treasures deemed worthy by Grand Cultivators were few and far between.</p><p>Rather than wasting time searching here, it seemed more prudent to bypass the mountain and proceed deeper into the Boundless Immortal Sect.</p><p>The White-Robed Man reached the foot of the mountain and paused briefly.  Instead of bypassing it, he chose to pass through the archway at the mountain path, directly venturing into the mountain.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>As he passed beneath the archway, a thunderbolt erupted overhead.</p><p>The stone archway transformed, crackling with lightning.  Triggered by the celestial thunder, it split the clouds, and silver-white electrical light formed a curtain as thunder cascaded down, threatening to engulf the White-Robed Man.</p><p>As if anticipating this, a surge of cold air emanated from the White-Robed Man's crown, forming a horizontal ice wall that shimmered with profound light.</p><p>In the next instant, the thunder struck the ice wall. The profound light flashed, reflecting all the thunder back.</p><p>The archway trembled, nearly collapsing.</p><p>The White-Robed Man remained unscathed and vanished into the mountain.</p><p>The mountain's restrictive barriers weren't limited to the archway.  However, shortly after passing through the archway, the White-Robed Man disappeared without a trace. The mountain fell silent, all phenomena ceasing.</p><p>Now, the White-Robed Man was wandering aimlessly through the mountains.</p><p>His movements inevitably triggered barriers, but with his acute spiritual sense and various divine abilities, he could dispel the phenomena before they fully manifested, concealing his presence.</p><p>While navigating the mountain range, the White-Robed Man constantly observed his surroundings and the path behind him.</p><p>His objective was clear.  He wasn't following Zhu Wudao's path but heading directly towards the core territory of the Boundless Immortal Sect.</p><p>The place Zhu Wudao had gone to was indeed a treasure trove, the legendary Immortal Halls, holding the promise of heaven-defying opportunities.</p><p>However, the White-Robed Man knew his strength was inferior to those individuals.  Alone and isolated, he preferred to abandon the Immortal Halls and avoid conflict.</p><p>If he could acquire the lost treasures of the Boundless Immortal Sect, it would still be a worthwhile trip, providing him with ample resources to cultivate for a long time.</p><p>His deliberate detour was a precaution, ensuring he wasn't being followed without his knowledge.</p><p>Finally, the White-Robed Man confirmed that no one was tailing him, all having been diverted by Zhu Wudao. Relieved, he removed the mask concealing his appearance and aura.</p><p>The man had an aged face, deep wrinkles etched into his skin, yet his eyes shone brightly, devoid of any senility.</p><p>If Qin Sang were present and saw this person, he would be greatly astonished. It was Old Man Yanshan!</p><p>After the Snow Plains battle, Old Man Yanshan had vanished without a trace.</p><p>Years later, he reappeared at the Boundless Immortal Sect, his cultivation having soared, breaking through to late-stage Nascent Soul!</p><p>Old Man Yanshan gazed towards the core territory of the Boundless Immortal Sect. A light flashed in his hand, revealing a Water Phase Token. He toyed with it for a moment before putting it away.</p><p>Outside the mountain gate, the imitation Water Phase Token had been destroyed, and his feigned rage had been for show.</p><p>"The Ice Ritual Divine Disc and the Boiling Snow Pill were both taken out by the Water Phase Master and fell into that person's hands.  The remaining treasures in the Water Phase Hall shouldn't be much. It's better to go to the Emperor Bestowal Mountain, the shared domain of the Five Phases Masters. The Five Phase Tokens are symbols of the Five Phases Masters' identities, so entering the Emperor Bestowal Mountain should be much easier… Hmm, it's best to visit the Fire Phase Hall as well. If I can get the Fire Rhinoceros Horn, I can go back and negotiate a deal with that person. That person hasn't appeared in the Southern Prefecture, so he likely doesn't know the true function of the Ice Ritual Divine Disc yet…  It's just that the Fire Phase inheritor hasn't shown up yet. I don't know if that treasure is still in the legacy grounds. Also, does that old devil Zhu know about this item?"</p><p>Old Man Yanshan pondered for a while, then, setting his sights on a direction, flew down the mountain.</p><p>He increased his speed, weaving through the mountains.  He caught a glimpse of unusual phenomena emanating from the direction of the cliff, paused briefly, and then looked away, putting aside thoughts of the opportunities within the Immortal Halls.</p><p>Crossing one mountain peak after another, he drew closer to the core territory of the Boundless Immortal Sect.</p><p>As he flew, he bypassed a perilous mountain and passed a valley.</p><p>The valley floor was overgrown with wild grass.</p><p>The Boundless Immortal Sect was abundant with spiritual energy, and the vegetation grew taller than elsewhere. The grass reached a height of ten feet, like small trees, concealing anyone who entered.</p><p>Reaching the edge of the valley, Old Man Yanshan was about to step into the grass when he suddenly sensed an unusual aura. His expression turned grave, and he immediately retreated.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist, you're quite fast. Su nearly failed to catch up."</p><p>The grass stalks rustled, and a figure emerged. It was Su Zinan!</p><p>Su Zinan smiled at Old Man Yanshan, his eyes like those of a predator eyeing its prey. "In the Northern Desolation Snow Plains, it was a pity we missed each other.  Fortunately, it's not too late to renew our acquaintance today."</p><p>"It's you!"</p><p>Old Man Yanshan concealed the Water Phase Token, precisely to guard against this person.</p><p>He hadn't expected Su Zinan to have been watching him all along!</p><p>"Zhu Wudao and the others treat the Five Phase Tokens as treasures. I assume these tokens still have significant use in the legacy grounds of the Immortal Sect. Would Fellow Daoist enlighten Su? Also, how about gifting your Water Phase Token to Su?" Su Zinan appeared confident of victory, his words arrogant. He walked with his hands clasped behind his back, his pace deceptively fast.</p><p>Old Man Yanshan's expression darkened.</p><p>Even if Su Zinan suspected him, he shouldn't be so certain the Water Phase Token was in his possession!</p><p>"When did this old man reveal his identity?"</p><p>Old Man Yanshan didn't deny it, as there was no point.</p><p>Recalling the Snow Plains battle, he had feigned death to escape and hadn't encountered Old Wu.</p><p>Although his scheme was later exposed by Daoist Qingfeng, Su Zinan had claimed to be seeking revenge against Daoist Qingfeng's companions, indicating the two sides hadn't colluded.</p><p>His identity shouldn't have been revealed. Why was Su Zinan so certain?</p><p>"When Su discovered the secrets of the Snow Plains, I noticed traces of a mysterious expert's visit.  That should have been Fellow Daoist, right? I left Lu Ye near the Snow Plains, waiting for Fellow Daoist, but instead, a fellow skilled in fire arts arrived. Old Wu was no match for him and retreated in defeat.</p><p>"If Fellow Daoist possessed such strength, you would have already succeeded, and there would be no need for such elaborate schemes. You must not be the same person.</p><p>"This fire devil is either your ally or your enemy!</p><p>"In my opinion, it's more likely you eventually turned against each other.</p><p>"Although the fire devil is powerful, he may not surpass Fellow Daoist, who had schemed in the Snow Plains for so many years.</p><p>"Moreover, if the fire devil obtained the Water Phase Master's legacy and learned the secrets of the Boundless Immortal Sect, why wouldn't he come to the Southern Border himself and miss this grand event?</p><p>"With the fire devil's continued absence, I presume the Water Phase Master's legacy fell into your hands, didn't it?  It's only natural that Fellow Daoist's cultivation has soared after obtaining such a great opportunity."</p><p>Qin Sang had become the 'fire devil' in Su Zinan's narrative.</p><p>Su Zinan didn't mind enlightening Old Man Yanshan.  This was his masterpiece of deduction.</p><p>Upon seeing the White-Robed Man, Su Zinan had become suspicious. After much contemplation, he had arrived at a plausible explanation.</p><p>It didn't matter if he was wrong; a test would reveal the truth!</p><p>As it turned out, Su Zinan had gambled correctly!</p><p>With a playful expression, he sized up the unsettled Old Man Yanshan, a smirk playing on his lips. "Fellow Daoist, are you afraid of Su, hence your reluctance to reveal the Water Phase Token?"</p><p>"Arrogant!"</p><p>Old Man Yanshan flew into a rage.</p><p>He hadn't broken through to late-stage Nascent Soul long ago, so his strength might be inferior to that of a seasoned Grand Cultivator like Su Zinan.  However, he wasn't a pushover either.</p><p>While conversing, he had been surveying the surroundings, confirming Mo Xingdao's absence.  Su Zinan coming alone to ambush him was underestimating him!</p><p>Su Zinan's smile vanished, his expression turning cold, his voice chilling. "A newly advanced Grand Cultivator, perfect to be the second main soul for my divine banner!"</p><p>Besides the Water Phase Token, he also wanted Old Man Yanshan's Nascent Soul!</p><p>Before his words even faded, Su Zinan's speed explosively increased, his killing intent soaring.</p><p>Old Man Yanshan had already formulated a plan.</p><p>He knew he wasn't Su Zinan's match and wouldn't foolishly engage in a deathmatch.</p><p>Along the way, Old Man Yanshan had been observing the surroundings, memorizing specific locations, precisely to prepare for such a situation.</p><p>Facing danger, he could utilize the Boundless Immortal Sect's terrain and restrictive barriers to escape.  Shaking off Su Zinan wouldn't be difficult.</p><p>Su Zinan rapidly closed in.</p><p>Old Man Yanshan stamped his foot heavily.</p><p>‘Splash!’  The sound of rushing water filled the air, and moisture permeated the rocks.</p><p>The previously dry ground was suddenly flooded.</p><p>The flood appeared without a source, surging forth with a momentum rivaling a raging river!</p><p>Old Man Yanshan stood atop the crest of a wave. Then, a towering wave erupted, and his figure was instantly shattered, vanishing into thin air. In its place, dozens of illusory figures appeared, all formed of water, their features resembling Old Man Yanshan.</p><p>Yet, his true body was nowhere to be seen!</p><p>The phantoms appeared and charged towards the rear.</p><p>Su Zinan sneered, and with a 'whoosh,' the Dragon Sinew Net shot out, unfolding in mid-air to form a massive net, aiming to ensnare all the phantoms.</p><p>‘Bang! Bang! Bang!’</p><p>As the Dragon Sinew Net tightened, the phantoms shattered, turning into splashes of water, but it wasn't enough to force out Old Man Yanshan's true body.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The flood reversed.</p><p>The raging torrent surged skyward, layers of water splashing up white crests like clouds, crashing against the giant net.</p><p>Old Man Yanshan, concealed among the phantoms, charged outwards without looking back.</p><p>Just then.</p><p>The ground ahead trembled, and the earth cracked open.</p><p>A demonic banner slowly rose from the fissure, blocking Old Man Yanshan's escape route.</p><p>Old Man Yanshan's heart clenched, a sense of foreboding washing over him.  Then, three sinister figures appeared before the demonic banner. One of them, a withered and aged human-shaped shadow, was Old Wu!</p><p>Old Wu's eyes were closed, his body somewhat translucent, devoid of any life force.  He clearly didn't resemble a living person.</p><p>Yet, he held a talisman disc in one hand, the Blood-Drinking Demonic Halberd circling beside him, wielding the divine abilities he possessed in life!</p><p>Suddenly, Old Wu opened his eyes.</p><p>The demonic halberd hummed and vibrated.</p><p>His lifeless gaze seemed to pierce Old Man Yanshan's soul, sending chills down his spine!</p>
