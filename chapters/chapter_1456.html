<h1>Chapter 1448: The Winter Talisman</h1><p>What secrets does the jade sword hold?</p><p>Is it connected to the Jinghai Sect?</p><p>…</p><p>Although the jade sword was found in a Buddhist temple, it was clutched in the hand of a corpse, so it may not be a Buddhist treasure.</p><p>Qin Sang looked at the jade sword, these questions flashing quickly through his mind. He recalled the seven-story pagoda of unknown use in his possession, wondering if the two artifacts might be connected.</p><p>However, Qin Sang had no intention of acquiring the jade sword. Instead, he speculated on the seller's motives.</p><p>There's a 50% chance that the person in the bamboo building is the Hunmo Elder. He shouldn't lack usable artifacts; he should value such an artifact with hidden secrets even more.</p><p>Is he trying to draw out someone who truly understands the secret?</p><p>Thinking this, Qin Sang leaned back in his chair. Whether the Hunmo Elder was trying to lure him or someone else, he wouldn't interfere rashly.</p><p>At this time, Qin Sang noticed that the surrounding discussions had quieted down significantly. The jade sword seemed truly unusual.</p><p>But it wasn't enough to make them spend a top-grade artifact.</p><p>Someone tried to bid several times, but seeing the owner's stubbornness, they lost interest.</p><p>The transaction ultimately failed.  The Chongtai Venerable moved to the next bamboo building.</p><p>Inside the bamboo building:</p><p>Hunmo Elder retrieved the jade sword. Holding the jade sword in one hand and a spiritual ginseng Ruyi in the other, he looked somewhat puzzled.</p><p>True energy poured in.</p><p>A faint white orb appeared inside the jade sword.</p><p>The Guanyin on the spiritual ginseng Ruyi also glowed; its closed eyes seemed poised to open at any moment.</p><p>If anyone had entered the bamboo building at this moment, they would have noticed that the two artifacts emitted very similar energy fluctuations.  The jade sword's fluctuation was slightly weaker, superficial.</p><p>However, unless the two artifacts were placed together, or one had seen them before, an ordinary person wouldn't notice the difference.</p><p>"The jade sword's crafting method is similar to the spiritual ginseng Ruyi. I spent two years carefully refining it, disguising its energy fluctuations to resemble it. The Xuan Tian Palace should buy it to investigate. This way, the information can be confirmed without alarming anyone. Why haven't they made a move? Did I guess wrong?"</p><p>Hunmo Elder muttered to himself.</p><p>Seeming unsatisfied with the lack of confirmation, Hunmo Elder repeatedly looked at the spiritual ginseng Ruyi in his hand, his gaze less resolute.</p><p>He somewhat regretted that in the past, to avoid being disturbed in his cultivation, he hadn't bothered to develop his forces. Things would have been much easier.</p><p>The Wanmo Conference is backed by several of the strongest forces in the Boundless Sea, mutually restraining each other. He could only push forward some less important matters and couldn't take control.</p><p>After much thought, Hunmo Elder put the jade sword up for sale again.</p><p>…</p><p>Qin Sang was still pondering Hunmo Elder's intentions when he saw his jade token light up.  Activating the token's restriction, he was moved to the Chongtai Venerable's side.</p><p>The "Seven Master Buddha Seal" and the materials for refining the Gold-sinking Sword were already obtained. He only used one幽煞棘(You Sha Ji), and things have become much easier afterward.</p><p>"Yuan Yin Water, Seven-Colored Ganoderma Fruit, Yinming Earth…"</p><p>Qin Sang didn't try to hide his request for these spiritual items.</p><p>Based on the information he had previously investigated, Qin Sang believed that Master Mu was very likely still alive.</p><p>It's better if Master Mu is here; he can take the opportunity to reconnect.</p><p>Even if Master Mu died at the hands of Hunmo Elder, he needn't worry. When Hunmo Elder entered the Jinghai Sect, he didn't go straight to the medicine garden, indicating that he didn't perform soul searching or that it failed.</p><p>Soon, Qin Sang received a response.</p><p>The other party had two Seven-Colored Ganoderma Fruits, but they weren't interested in the three spiritual herbs Qin Sang had.</p><p>Until the final period of free exchange, after several rounds of trading, Qin Sang paid for two types of spiritual herbs and finally got two Seven-Colored Ganoderma Fruits and the second drop of Tianmian Heavy Liquid.</p><p>Each spiritual ascension needs a whole Seven-Colored Ganoderma Fruit, so he could only prioritize the Fire Jade Centipede and the Sky Eye Butterfly.</p><p>As for Yuan Yin Water and Yinming Earth, they never appeared at the trade fair.</p><p>Qin Sang changed his strategy, asking if anyone knew the whereabouts of these two spiritual items, but to no avail.  It seems he must go to Hundred Flowers Valley again.</p><p>The trade fair was drawing to a close.</p><p>Qin Sang let out a sigh, feeling exhausted.  Wrestling with these old fellows, testing each other's limits, had consumed as much energy as a major battle.</p><p>His gaze shifted to the jade sword, which remained unsold.</p><p>During the trade fair, he had been watching that bamboo building. The jade sword's owner was stubbornly holding onto his price, even without any interest.</p><p>"If it's Hunmo Elder, why sell the jade sword separately?"</p><p>Qin Sang muttered to himself, unable to fathom the other party's intentions.</p><p>Soon, the Venerable Chongtai announced the end of the trading fair.  The layout of the Lake Heart Island shifted rapidly; the bamboo buildings moved and were completely rearranged, finally disappearing into the darkness.</p><p>Qin Sang got up, left her room, gave the jade pendant and spirit stones to the puppet maid, and boarded the light bridge to leave Lake Heart Island.</p><p>Shortly after, figures frequently appeared in the sky above Wanmo City, scattering in all directions.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't head south directly, instead changing direction several times to see if anyone was following her.</p><p>...</p><p>On Lake Heart Island.</p><p>The Hunmo Elder put away the unsold jade sword, his expression unusually gloomy.  Then his gaze suddenly sharpened, as if realizing something. He hastily left the bamboo building, his figure flickering and vanishing.</p><p>On the outskirts of Wanmo City, in a low, ordinary courtyard.</p><p>The interior was sparsely furnished, like an ordinary mortal's home. Yet, two figures in black robes sat cross-legged within, a stark contrast to the surroundings.</p><p>The two remained motionless, without the slightest fluctuation in their aura, like corpses.  Between them hovered a black demonic eye.  Its pupil dilated and contracted, extending several invisible threads outward, reaching an unknown destination beyond the courtyard.</p><p>Suddenly, both opened their eyes and looked towards the entrance.</p><p>A figure appeared at the door—the Hunmo Elder.</p><p>"Greetings, Master!"</p><p>The two hastily rose and bowed.</p><p>"The trading fair is over.  Has the Xuan Tian Palace not yet acted?" The Hunmo Elder asked, his voice grim.</p><p>"The trading fair is over?"</p><p>The two were startled, instantly realizing something was amiss.  They replied nervously, "The reports from our subordinates were all normal. The three Xuan Tian Palace elders should be waiting for news; there's been no movement..."</p><p>Before they could finish, the Hunmo Elder cursed them as fools, no longer concealing his anger. He transformed into a streak of light and dashed towards a distant courtyard.</p><p>The two disciples' faces flushed with shame as they hurriedly followed.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>Hidden restrictions within the small courtyard activated; several beams of icy white energy surged towards the intruders.</p><p>The Hunmo Elder coldly snorted, heavily striking his black bamboo staff, shattering the icy energy. He then burst into the main hall, glanced around, and dashed into the back hall.</p><p>There, he saw only three ice sculptures, their auras identical to the elders themselves!</p><p>*Bang! Bang! Bang!*</p><p>The Hunmo Elder laughed angrily, shattering the ice sculptures with his staff, then glared fiercely at his two disciples.</p><p>The two disciples stood dumbfounded.  Following their instructions, they had been secretly monitoring the Xuan Tian Palace elders' residence, using secret techniques to avoid alarming them.</p>
