<h1>Chapter 1299: The Spy</h1><p>Chapter 1299: The Spy</p><p>A moment later.</p><p>Everyone swiftly descended the mountain.</p><p>This time, their expressions held a degree of confidence and delight. Each used their own methods to conceal their auras and hide their figures, speeding towards Yucheng.</p><p>Their route seemed chaotic and without pattern, yet they proceeded smoothly, arriving near Yucheng without alarming anyone.</p><p>Outside Yucheng.</p><p>Qin Sang and the others appeared in the shadows, observing the large city.  Seeing the chaos within, they didn't hesitate, charging into the Lotus Formation!</p><p>…</p><p>Among the three Yuan Ying cultivators stationed in Yucheng, one was surnamed Qi. He had connections with and was highly regarded by the righteous cultivators,  Cang Hong Zhenren and Tian Zheng Laoren.</p><p>At this moment, the cultivator surnamed Qi stood on the city wall, personally overseeing and directing the defense.</p><p>The enemy army hadn't yet arrived, but the Yuan Ying cultivators of the Two Realms Alliance had mostly assembled. Even with the aid of the protective city formation, the situation remained extremely critical.</p><p>Worried about the battle, the cultivator surnamed Qi frowned.</p><p>Unexpectedly, his earlier words had proven true. The Two Realms Alliance's intelligence network far surpassed their expectations; they had attacked so quickly, appearing as if from thin air, catching them completely off guard.</p><p>He stared intently at the figures outside the city, not daring to relax in the slightest.</p><p>Fortunately, the Cuiyuan soldiers were seasoned veterans, their cooperation exceptionally smooth.  At a command, a tidal wave of attacks erupted, surging into the formation.</p><p>Although Qin Sang and the others possessed Yuan Ying cultivation, they were within the enemy's formation and facing a concentrated assault.  They dared not be careless, dodging and weaving, inadvertently slowing their progress in breaking the formation.</p><p>Seeing this, the cultivator surnamed Qi didn't show much joy.</p><p>Cang Hong Zhenren had gone to pursue Ye Laomo, and his return was delayed, leaving Yucheng at its weakest.</p><p>Due to the lack of high-level cultivators, all they could do was defend and delay, unable to charge out and fight the enemy.  Without the means to threaten the enemy's lives, the enemy had no need to hold back, daring to charge recklessly through the formation.</p><p>At this rate, the protective city formation would inevitably be broken.</p><p>Just then, an urgent voice came from the distance.</p><p>“Daoist Qi, the situation is dire! The previous city formation was built to cooperate with the Youjing Tower. The Youjing Tower has been destroyed, causing the city formation to be affected, revealing weaknesses. They've come too quickly; there's no time to repair the formation! Only the three of us remain in the city, and we lack the ability to seal all the breaches. Once they discover them, Yucheng will be in grave danger!”</p><p>The voice grew closer.</p><p>The next moment, a figure flew onto the city wall—another Yuan Ying cultivator stationed in Yucheng, named Qu Huan.</p><p>Seeing the critical situation, Qu Huan hurried over to consult with the cultivator surnamed Qi.</p><p>Landing beside the cultivator surnamed Qi, Qu Huan looked at the remains of the Youjing Tower nearby and sighed softly.</p><p>The base of the Youjing Tower was intact, but the tower itself was in ruins. Some parts were riddled with cracks, others reduced to rubble, and the crystal ball at the top was missing, having been taken by Ye Laomo.</p><p>The cultivator surnamed Qi frowned deeply.  He understood this, of course, but couldn't think of a good strategy. All they could do was hold on.  Seeing that Qu Huan seemed to have a solution, he quickly asked, “Daoist Qu, what is your plan?”</p><p>“Abandon the outer city!”</p><p>Qu Huan stated firmly.  “In times of necessity, sacrifices must be made.  If we wait for the outer city to fall, it will be too late to consolidate our forces. Please make a swift decision, Daoist Qi! The inner city is the old site of Yucheng, and its protective formation, left by our ancestors, has been tested over time. Even if the Two Realms Alliance launches a full-scale assault, they won't be able to break through quickly, giving us enough time until the arrival of the Zhenrens.”</p><p>The cultivator surnamed Qi's expression was grave, his eyes filled with struggle.</p><p>Abandoning the outer city was more than just losing territory.</p><p>The outer city held countless treasuries, currently filled with resources prepared for the war, all of which would fall into the enemy's hands.</p><p>And the city formation, constructed at great cost by Cuiyuan, would be lost.  Without the outer city as a shield, they would have nowhere to retreat!</p><p>“Daoist Qu…”</p><p>After a moment's hesitation, the cultivator surnamed Qi opened his mouth to speak, but a sudden premonition struck him. A cold gleam flashed, heading straight for his face.</p><p>An immediate, sharp pain pierced his brow.</p><p>“It’s you!”</p><p>The cultivator surnamed Qi's face changed drastically, he roared, and his figure retreated, his entire body radiating a blue light.</p><p>Within the blue light, the phantom of a suit of armor appeared.</p><p>The armor was ancient and rustic, to put it bluntly, old and dilapidated, as if patched together from pieces of old tree bark.</p><p>This seemingly dilapidated armor spun rapidly around the cultivator surnamed Qi.  Countless runes on the armor flickered mysteriously, emitting a rich, heavy blue light.</p><p>*Ding!*</p><p>A tiny, dark gold flying sword, about the size of a thumb, pierced the green light and struck the armor, eliciting a clang of metal on metal.</p><p>Unable to penetrate the armor, Qu Huan recalled his sword, a look of surprise flashing across his face. He hadn't expected the Qi cultivator to deflect his sneak attack so easily.</p><p>"You shameless wretch! Have you forgotten the kindness of your sect? You betrayed the Abyss, becoming a lackey for the Skyfaring League!"</p><p>The Qi cultivator roared in disbelief and anger. Qu Huan, a rising star from Haotian Manor, a major righteous sect within the Abyss, second only to the Supreme Grandmaster—a man poised for greatness—was a spy.</p><p>"Lackey? I hail from the Skyfaring League. My allegiance to the Manor was merely a pretense. My talent was lacking in my youth, and I received little attention. My current position is thanks to the League's covert support and my own efforts. Haotian Manor merely added the finishing touches; they owe me little…"</p><p>Qu Huan's face showed no shame as he spoke calmly.</p><p>"What? You were sent to Haotian Manor by the Skyfaring League?" the Qi cultivator exclaimed in shock.</p><p>Both the Skyfaring League and the Abyss knew that each side had spies within the other's ranks, but a spy reaching Qu Huan's level of achievement was unheard of.</p><p>"Impossible! If you were controlled by the Skyfaring League, you could never have hidden it this long!"</p><p>Qu Huan scoffed.  "Controlled? Old Master Zhen did try to control me, but I secretly countered his methods. Until today, even during the war against the Skyfaring League, I never sent them a single message or betrayed the Abyss in any way. Naturally, you couldn't find me out!  I played both sides, betting on whichever side suited me best. Today's events have clarified the situation, and I decided to gamble.  I just didn't expect you, Daoist Qi, to be so capable. You were poisoned by my Wu Xiang poison, yet your true essence remains unaffected, and you blocked my Chen Xi sword. With these two techniques, I've even slain a shapeshifting demon in the Transformation Stage!"</p><p>Hearing this, the Qi cultivator dropped his pretense and said coldly, "You think your cunning outmatches everyone? You and Old Monster Feng deliberately stayed to help defend the city; I naturally had to be wary.  Your Wu Xiang poison is potent, but useless against someone immune to it.  I was more suspicious of Old Monster Feng; I thought he was faking it, but it turns out you were the one with the problem!"</p>
