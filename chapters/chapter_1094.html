<h1>Chapter 186: The Millennium Pact</h1><p>The Demonic Stele's power was almost depleted. Fairy Southern Return handed the stele to the elder and personally joined the battle against Mo Qingzhu.</p><p>The elder, carrying the Demonic Stele, escaped through the opening created by the Heavenly Phoenix Plume.</p><p>Without a moment's delay, he sped towards the ancient temple on the cliff face.</p><p>Within the crimson space, the battle raged on.</p><p>The elder's successful escape alerted the Ancient Devil to the unfavorable turn of events.  Trapped within this space, everyone had been sitting ducks.  It wouldn't have been difficult for the two devils, working together, to eliminate them one by one.</p><p>The Heavenly Phoenix Plume, along with Qingzhu and Sunu's unyielding resistance, introduced unforeseen variables.</p><p>Lingzhuzi's Daoist robe was torn, his hair disheveled, and the whisk in his hand was in disarray.  The stardust around him had dissipated.</p><p>Thunder rumbled within the Great Witch. Her figure vanished, replaced by the Spring Thunder Silkworm's illusory form. She seemed to have merged with her natal Gu insect.</p><p>Old Devil Fang moved like lightning, his form difficult to grasp. However, the incessant, piercing shriek of cicadas, like a demonic chant, caused dizziness and confusion in anyone who heard it.</p><p>Tangible sound waves dispersed the Demonic Qi, sharp as blades, and besieged Mo Qingzhu.</p><p>Fairy Southern Return's cultivation had been forcibly elevated through a secret technique. After sending away the Demonic Stele, her power was slightly inferior to the other three.</p><p>She summoned her magical treasure, an elegant, clear sword.</p><p>Sword Qi enveloped her as she employed various sword techniques, focusing primarily on defense. She coordinated with Lingzhuzi and the others to avoid being isolated and defeated.</p><p>The four surrounded Mo Qingzhu.  Multicolored mystical lights burst forth, and a series of profound Daoist techniques unfolded. Each technique possessed extraordinary power and spectacle, dazzling to behold.</p><p>Mo Qingzhu faced the four great cultivators without yielding an inch.  Finally, the Nine-Lives Black Tortoise was also forced to join the fray.</p><p>If not for Qingzhu's true soul constantly resisting, they would likely have already been defeated, and the elder's escape would not have been so smooth.</p><p>Qingzhu's willpower was beyond imagination. He never gave up, and each time, he managed to disrupt Mo Qingzhu. The four cultivators, with their keen eyes, seized every opportunity to regain the upper hand.</p><p>The Devil Lord used the Ghost Seal to control the Ghost Mark, entangling the Ancient Devil's soul fragment.</p><p>The Ghost Seal no longer resembled its previous form. It now looked like the Myriad Ghosts Soul Seal, its influence on the Ancient Devil's soul fragment growing stronger.</p><p>The situation seemed to be developing favorably. They even secretly discussed seizing an opportunity to combine their strength and destroy the Ancient Devil's soul fragment before slowly dealing with Mo Qingzhu.</p><p>As long as they held out until the elder restored the ancient restrictions, sealed the Blood Coffin, and perhaps even cooperated with the sword Qi to slay the Ancient Devil, they would be saved.</p><p>The Ancient Devil was well aware of this.  Time was running out.</p><p>Just then, the Ancient Devil's soul fragment suddenly heard a whisper-like transmission from its main body.  A glint flashed in its eyes. "You want me to merge with the Devil Puppet and execute the Soul Severing Strike?"</p><p>The Soul Severing Strike was an incredibly powerful secret technique, but it came at a great cost.</p><p>The main body needed to contend with the sword Qi, and could only barely manipulate the Devil Puppet through the demonic restriction.  Furthermore, the Devil Puppet's original soul was constantly restless, making it impossible for the Ancient Devil to execute such a profound technique through it.</p><p>The Ancient Devil's soul fragment, on the other hand, lacked sufficient power.</p><p>The main body had no choice but to release the demonic restriction on Mo Qingzhu, handing him over to the soul fragment and instructing it to merge with Mo Qingzhu to execute the Soul Severing Strike, hoping for a swift victory.</p><p>The goal was to annihilate all the cultivators and complete the Blood River Formation before the seal was broken, allowing the main body to emerge.</p><p>The Ancient Devil's soul fragment was acutely aware of the main body's intentions.</p><p>Ever since this soul fragment developed independent thoughts, they had become rivals.  The main body had always been wary of it, which was why Mo Qingzhu had always been under its control.</p><p>Naturally, the soul fragment wouldn't completely obey the main body, but it was forced by the circumstances.</p><p>Firstly, its power was far inferior to the main body's control over the Devil Puppet.</p><p>Secondly, it sensed that the main body was speaking the truth.  That sword Qi was extraordinary, specifically designed to slay the Ancient Devil. It and the main body were two souls in one body, their energies connected.</p><p>If the sacred coffin couldn't withstand the sword Qi and the main body was slain, all soul fragments would be doomed, their souls annihilated.</p><p>But no one had anticipated so many unexpected events.</p><p>The descendants of the Four Sacred Palaces escaped with the Heavenly Phoenix Plume.  Time was of the essence, forcing the main body to compromise.</p><p>This was the opportunity the soul fragment had been dreaming of.  "I can do as you say, but you must promise me one thing!  After the seal is broken, you must grant me freedom and swear that you will not pursue me by any means for a thousand years. Otherwise, whether I save you or not, I'm doomed. I'd rather devour the Nascent Soul and leave, gambling on whether the sword Qi will slay me along with you!"</p><p>The soul fragment laid out its terms plainly.</p><p>The main body didn't hesitate.  "A thousand years? Fine! I'll give you a thousand years! We won't interfere with each other for a millennium. After that, we'll see who prevails!"</p><p>The two devils reached an agreement.</p><p>Lingzhuzi and the others were still oblivious to this, their minds taut, not daring to relax in the slightest.</p><p>…</p><p>On Mount Yitian, the elder had returned to the ancient temple on the cliff face.</p><p>The temple was in ruins, a fissure running through it.</p><p>The elder channeled his True Essence, examined the ancient restrictions, and placed the Demonic Stele back in its original position.</p><p>‘Hum!’</p><p>The Demonic Stele hummed softly as the power of the ancient restrictions was restored.</p><p>The elder hurried towards the mountain hollow.  Seeing the damaged altar, he retrieved various spiritual materials from his storage pouch and repaired the altar to its original state.</p><p>To fully restore the seal, Lady Li and her people would need to repair the entire sealing formation.</p><p>However, Lady Li had been gone for some time and wouldn't need much longer.</p><p>Moreover, with the return of the Demonic Stele, the power of the ancient restrictions had greatly increased, and it could suppress the Ancient Devil.</p><p>The elder glanced outside before rushing to the other two clans' ancient restrictions.</p><p>…</p><p>As the elder completed these actions, the light of the Blood Coffin dimmed as it was suppressed by the seal.  The sword Qi seized the opportunity to advance.</p><p>Everyone rejoiced at this sight, knowing that Fairy Southern Return's plan had worked.</p><p>At this moment, the Ancient Devil's soul fragment, instead of being angered, was delighted. It suddenly burst into maniacal laughter.</p><p>Simultaneously, Mo Qingzhu and the soul fragment abruptly changed their intentions and charged towards each other.</p><p>"No!"</p><p>"Stop them!"</p><p>…</p><p>Lingzhuzi and the others were caught off guard, a sense of foreboding rising within them. They shouted in unison.  Although they didn't know the Ancient Devil's scheme, they knew that they had to stop it, whatever it was.</p><p>The Devil Lord activated the Ghost Seal, and the other experts also exerted all their strength to obstruct them.</p><p>Ignoring the Devil Lord, the soul fragment, protected by Demonic Qi, charged towards the other battlefield. A black Qi suddenly surged from its body, accompanied by eerie laughter.  In a flash, it vanished into Mo Qingzhu.</p><p>With the soul fragment leaving its body, Ghost Marks instantly covered Sunu.</p><p>Sunu's expression was blank, eerily demonic.</p><p>Now, she had truly become the Devil Lord's soul slave.</p><p>However, Sunu's own cultivation was too weak, making this soul slave of little use to the Devil Lord. Moreover, he couldn't use her to restrain the Ancient Devil's soul fragment, essentially losing her greatest value.</p><p>The Ancient Devil's soul fragment merged with Mo Qingzhu.</p><p>Chaos erupted within Qingzhu.  His facial expression contorted.</p><p>Pain, madness, bloodlust, murderous intent…</p><p>At this moment, Qingzhu bore no resemblance to the refined appearance he had displayed when his true self was revealed.  He had become a true devil.</p><p>As the main body released the demonic restriction, the Ancient Devil's soul fragment instantly took control.</p><p>The eerie laughter grew louder and more piercing, echoing throughout the area.  The Demonic Qi swirling around Qingzhu's body abruptly retracted, returning entirely within him.</p>
