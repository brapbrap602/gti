<h1>Chapter 931 Ghost Land</h1><p>Elder Mu's expression stiffened. He forced a laugh, saying, "Blood Elder, when did you become so hesitant? If I wasn't sure of success, why would I ask for your help and invite trouble?"</p><p>"Humph! Among the Nascent Soul cultivators present, only I can help you.  Creating a blood soul consumes blood energy that takes me decades to recover.  Without the Heavenly Gang Ring, your eloquent pleas would be useless!"</p><p>The elder in blood-red robes secretly handed a fist-sized blood orb to Elder Mu. Inside the orb was a sealed, blood-red figure, its expression one of intense pain and agony.</p><p>"Once we arrive, leave the orb.  I'll handle the rest."</p><p>Elder Mu's face lit up. He pocketed the orb, then quickly put distance between himself and the blood-robed elder to avoid suspicion.</p><p>Watching Elder Mu's retreating back, the Blood Robe Ancestor's eyes flickered with suspicion.</p><p>"What incredible treasure did this old devil find in the Seven Kills Hall that he's willing to use his chance to borrow the Heavenly Gang Ring?  Isn't he afraid of a Heavenly Tribulation? I heard he plundered Dong Ming's cave in the Demon Sea.  Could he have really obtained something that drastically increased his power?"</p><p>……</p><p>Purple Mist Forbidden Zone.</p><p>Qin Sang followed the Purple River upstream, soon encountering the vast purple mist.</p><p>Along the way, Qin Sang kept the Sky Eye Butterfly vigilant, to avoid encountering people from the two major merchant alliances. But he didn't see a single soul.</p><p>Perhaps the East Pole Alliance had changed its target and hadn't sent anyone here.</p><p>Approaching the purple mist, Qin Sang noticed the edge seemed to have receded considerably since his last visit. He wasn't sure if it was a normal phenomenon.</p><p>He opened his spirit beast pouch and released the Fat Silkworm.</p><p>The Fat Silkworm, knowing it was about to get a feast, showed no resentment despite its long hunger.</p><p>Without needing Qin Sang's instructions, it eagerly hopped onto his shoulder, spitting out its detoxifying armor and staring intently into the depths of the Purple Mist Forbidden Zone, bobbing its head.</p><p>The Sky Eye Butterfly, still within Qin Sang's dantian, used its divine ability to assist.</p><p>Qin Sang needed to find the ghost creature that had stolen the Flying Night Rakshasa and couldn't reveal the Sky Eye Butterfly's presence too early.</p><p>With the detoxifying armor, Qin Sang flashed into the purple mist, disappearing from sight.</p><p>He headed straight for the Purple Star Eagle nest he had visited before, catching a few purple weasels along the way. This high cliff pass wasn't the only one, but it was the easiest to traverse.  Other routes were either too far or incredibly dangerous.</p><p>Unexpectedly, upon reaching the pass, Qin Sang was surprised to find not a single Purple Star Eagle.</p><p>During his previous visit, the eagles had been densely packed, with hundreds of adult eagles circling the valley at all times. The entire population was astonishingly large.</p><p>Few ferocious beasts could survive in the poisonous mist.  Adult Purple Star Eagles were strong, numerous, and had virtually no natural predators, having dominated this area for countless years.</p><p>Otherwise, Xiang Yi wouldn't have been so certain last time.</p><p>"I remember that last time, the cultivator Pan defected, leading the earth-splitting lizards to attack the Purple Star Eagles, creating a massive beast-tide battle. Could that battle have wiped them out?"</p><p>Qin Sang was astonished. "I wonder what kind of beast guards the pass now?"</p><p>He stopped at a distance, hesitant to approach, and ordered the Sky Eye Butterfly to observe.</p><p>However, there wasn't a single beast in sight; the valley was unusually calm.</p><p>"Empty?"</p><p>Qin Sang frowned.  Without a beast guarding it, he could simply walk through.  Yet, he had an unsettling premonition.</p><p>He had heard from Madam Liu that when Xiang Yi and his party returned, they were unexpectedly pursued by a ferocious beast comparable to a transformed great demon, leading to numerous complications.</p><p>"Could it be occupied by that great beast?"</p><p>Qin Sang stared intently at the valley, hesitant.  Finally, he decided to take a detour, not risking his life.</p><p>He didn't yet have the strength to fight a transformed great demon, especially not in the Seven Kills Hall.</p><p>"Good thing I made some extra preparations," Qin Sang muttered, slowly retreating. Then he flew westward along the mountain range, traveling a considerable distance before reaching a cave.</p><p>The cave was another passage to the other side of the cliff.  It was said to house many earthworms that could breathe purple mist. These earthworms usually slumbered in their burrows, only becoming active when disturbed.</p><p>However, the poison in their mist was second only to that deep within the Purple Mist Forbidden Zone.</p><p>Cultivators lacking sufficient strength or top-tier detoxification techniques wouldn't dare take this route. Thus, not much information had been passed down about the cave, and whether or not only earthworms lived there remained uncertain.</p><p>Qin Sang remained alert, concealing his presence, and slipped into the cave.</p><p>The cave was winding and sinuous, yet unusually spacious.</p><p>Inside, a deathly silence reigned.  Qin Sang walked a considerable distance without encountering any other beasts.  Then, he abruptly stopped, turning towards the cave wall.</p><p>A purple mist enveloped a strangely luminous area on the wall.</p><p>A closer inspection revealed that it wasn't a rock face at all, but a scale!</p><p>The entire body of the Earth Dragon was hidden within the wall, only this single scale visible.</p><p>“No wonder it’s called an Earth Dragon!”</p><p>Qin Sang was startled. Judging from the scale, the Earth Dragon's size was likely unmatched, even surpassing a Jiao Dragon; its strength, however, remained unknown.</p><p>He had no intention of testing it.  He quickened his pace, moving away. He discovered several more Earth Dragon nests along the way, all their inhabitants asleep.  He eventually exited the cave without incident.</p><p>Qin Sang breathed a sigh of relief.  After ascertaining his bearings, he headed towards the Great Rift Valley, taking a detour near the Ancient God Altar. He found no other cultivators.</p><p>The Ancient God Altar remained dormant beneath the earth. Whether due to powerful ancient prohibitions or the presence of genuine demonic energy, the Sky-Eyed Butterfly couldn't penetrate the depths below. Qin Sang had to abandon the attempt.</p><p>The Great Rift Valley.</p><p>A top-tier magical artifact was within reach.</p><p>Gazing at the purple mist, thick as colorful clouds, even Qin Sang's composure was shaken by excitement.</p><p>He employed the same tactic, stealthily climbing down the cliff face, carefully avoiding any unusual areas to prevent complications. Reaching the valley floor, Qin Sang summoned the Nine Netherworld Magic Fire, following its guidance towards the Ghostlands.</p><p>Fatty Silkworm, restless, rolled on Qin Sang's shoulder, grunting, wanting to obtain the Purple Crystals first.</p><p>“You've been eating more and more lately.  This time, we'll probably need to get several pieces to satisfy you. The beasts guarding the Purple Crystals are strong; we need a careful plan—grab them and run!”</p><p>Qin Sang spoke softly, explaining to Fatty Silkworm with unprecedented gentleness.</p><p>Fatty Silkworm finally calmed down.</p><p>Qin Sang secretly breathed a sigh of relief. If the creature had thrown a tantrum and retracted the Detoxifying Armor, he would have been finished.</p><p>Having appeased Fatty Silkworm, Qin Sang wound his way through the terrain, finally returning to the extremely secluded canyon.</p><p>In the canyon.</p><p>The Nine Netherworld Magic Fire still floated in its original position, firmly blocking the entrance to the Ghostlands, seemingly unchanged for decades.  Across from the magic fire, a pale white ghostly mist enveloped the entire Ghostland space.</p><p>—</p><p>—</p><p>Thank you to  庆2844225, 猎手老孟, 书友20211027175456835, 玄元清寰, 书友20180108170552370, 书友20190513135654262, 大红枣妈妈, 兔言兔语, 天生我才可能变废柴, 书友20210613191337721, and many other generous patrons for your generous contributions.</p><p>I'm a little surprised; we haven't reached the climax yet.
