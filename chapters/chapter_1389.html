That's enough. The more people who know about the Xuan Tian Palace treasure, the worse. Besides, an outsider... we don't have centuries of friendship like we do amongst ourselves, making a fair share difficult."</p><p>The scholar in white robes hesitated. "The situation isn't entirely under our control. I fear when things come to a head, he'll see through our deception and we'll have to reveal the truth."</p><p>Feng Shangshi, already having a countermeasure, said lightly, "That's fine! It's all a demon's plot, and we've been in the dark until now.  We only just uncovered it."</p><p>"Daoist Feng is absolutely right."</p><p>The black-clothed swordsman chuckled.</p><p>…</p><p>Qin Sang sped across the sea, playing with a bamboo slip-shaped treasure—a unique communication artifact from Fengyang Mountain.</p><p>Along the way, he sensed the atmosphere growing increasingly tense.</p><p>He learned from Feng Shangshi that at least five demon kings were lurking nearby.</p><p>The strongest, Bifang, whose power Qin Sang had already experienced firsthand, was undeniably powerful and a sworn enemy of Feng Shangshi.</p><p>Another to watch out for was Wa Yu. Qin Sang had also clashed with it; fortunately, Wa Yu's poison is neutralized by the Fat Silkworm.</p><p>The other three demon kings each possessed unique abilities, but their reputations were less formidable than the first two.</p><p>According to Feng Shangshi's plan, if a general battle erupted, Qin Sang would engage Bifang, allowing Feng Shangshi the freedom to either join forces with Qin Sang to kill Bifang or to eliminate the other demon kings.</p><p>Qin Sang recalled being pursued by the three demon kings.  Bifang had only displayed his superb escape techniques and blood-light abilities. He certainly had other abilities he hadn't had a chance to use.</p><p>Such a powerful cultivator wouldn’t lack trump cards.</p><p>Qin Sang decided that unless he was certain of killing Bifang, his top priority was securing his own escape route.</p><p>Hunting Dawn Island.</p><p>The island's shape was somewhat similar to the Crescent Moon Realm—long and narrow, stretching east to west like a wall, blocking the waves surging from the north and south.</p><p>Qin Sang discreetly flew to the edge of Hunting Dawn Island, produced a token, which transformed into a stream of light, shooting inwards.</p><p>Soon, a figure, a Golden Core cultivator, flew from the island.  This person was also a direct disciple of Feng Shangshi, tasked with guarding the island.</p><p>"Qian Cheng pays his respects to Senior Mingyue!"</p><p>His gaze sweeping over Qin Sang, he quickly flew over to pay homage.</p><p>Qin Sang instructed Qian Cheng to remain silent and entered the island with him. Qian Cheng led Qin Sang to the best cave dwelling on the island.</p><p>"You may leave now. If the demons make any moves, don't panic; simply report to me immediately."</p><p>Qin Sang didn't refuse, looking around calmly.</p><p>Qian Cheng responded repeatedly, overjoyed. With a Nascent Soul cultivator on the island, they now had a backbone; even if the demons attacked, they could still resist.</p><p>Qin Sang's cave dwelling was on a mountaintop, with no one in sight—extremely tranquil. He entered the cave and closed the door.</p><p>Shortly after, a faint figure quietly slipped out of the cave. Qin Sang looked around and went towards a desolate, low mountain on the edge of the island.</p><p>The cave dwelling was silent; a figure sat inside, holding a communication artifact—a Nascent Soul puppet in disguise!</p><p>Qin Sang reached the desolate mountain, his figure flickered, passing through the island's restrictions, and quietly left the island. He found an inconspicuous reef nearby and casually carved out a cave dwelling.</p><p>With a Nascent Soul deliberately concealing himself, even the island's cultivators searching high and low wouldn't be able to find him.</p><p>The reason for such elaborate measures was that Qin Sang didn't fully trust Feng Shangshi.</p><p>Nascent Soul cultivators were all cunning and shrewd.  Qin Sang and Feng Shangshi had only met twice, and he knew even less about Shen Daozhu and the others, so he dared not fully trust them.</p><p>He had come to the Outer Regions alone.  If the other party intended to set a trap, framing him would be effortless, leaving no one to avenge him.</p><p>At the very least, if they diverted the trouble and used him to draw the main force of the demons, his situation would be perilous.</p><p>One must be wary of others.</p><p>Qin Sang planned ahead, leaving his real body behind, keeping the Nascent Soul puppet in the cave dwelling, allowing for timely remedy in case of an emergency.</p><p>His breakthrough to mid-Nascent Soul stage had enhanced his control over the puppet.</p><p>Combined with his senior sister's previous careful guidance,</p><p>although it wasn't as flexible and convenient as a physical incarnation,</p><p>as long as the distance wasn't too far, or his perception wasn't blocked by powerful restrictions, he could control the Nascent Soul puppet through the soul imprint on it.</p><p>Feng Shangshi and Shen Daozhu hadn't seen Qin Sang act.</p><p>Only a few demon kings knew he possessed a Nascent Soul puppet.</p><p>Presumably, those demon kings wouldn't discuss this with Feng Shangshi.</p><p>With his preparations complete,</p><p>Qin Sang sat cross-legged in the cave, taking out the demonic banner.</p><p>He decided to focus on *Fire Seed Golden Lotus* and *Celestial Demon Refining Form* first, as they didn't demand such stringent spiritual energy requirements.</p><p>Time slipped by slowly during his seclusion.</p><p>The sea area was turbulent beneath the surface, though outwardly calm.</p><p>Guards on Hunting Dawn Island went about their duties as usual.  Nothing significant occurred, so Qian Cheng didn't dare disturb Qin Sang's meditation.</p><p>...</p><p>Unnamed Island.</p><p>A scholar in white robes sat alone in the hall, periodically attempting to use the demon rat's essence blood to locate the Xuan Tian Palace traitor.</p><p>However, his furrowed brow suggested little progress.</p><p>...</p><p>North.</p><p>Waves crashed violently.</p><p>Demonic energy soared to the heavens!</p><p>Any human cultivator witnessing this would tremble with fear, turning and fleeing without hesitation.</p><p>The sea surface was covered in a dense mass of demonic soldiers.  Thousands upon thousands of them, some circling in the air, others rising and falling in the water, completely surrounding a small island.</p><p>The remains of a human city were still visible on the island, but it was now utterly silent, devoid of any human presence.</p><p>The demonic soldiers surrounding the island seemed to fear it greatly, not daring to set foot on it.</p><p>Immortal Mountain on the Island.</p><p>The cultivator's cave dwelling was now occupied by several demon kings.</p><p>All three demon kings who had pursued Qin Sang were present, all having assumed human forms.</p><p>The Frog-Fish had transformed into a bald, muscular man with dark green skin and visible fish scales.</p><p>Bifang's bright red cranial growth remained prominent even in human form, making his appearance grotesquely ugly.</p><p>The Sly Fox, however, had become a stunningly beautiful woman, petite and draped in translucent gauze, her alluring features partially veiled. Her eyes, filled with a captivating watery light, were incredibly seductive.</p><p>In addition, two other demon kings, a male and a female, sat on stone chairs, meditating with closed eyes.</p><p>The Frog-Fish paced restlessly, occasionally glancing towards the cave dwelling.</p><p>"Why is there still no movement? Could Daoist Friend Hong's technique have failed?"</p><p>Bifang urged the Frog-Fish to calm down.  "You should know the ignorance of humans.  Daoist Friend Hong, a member of the Rainbow Rat clan, was born a twin, naturally linked in mind.  They cultivated together; the other body is a natural manifestation.  Although not very powerful, it possesses enviable, extraordinary abilities. If the main body dies, they can be resurrected via the manifestation. Daoist Friend Hong is always cautious. This time, they underestimated Old Ghost Feng's scheme and lost their main body. The manifestation hasn't been used yet and should succeed. It won't be easy, though. Just be patient."</p>
