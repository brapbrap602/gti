Chapter 1889: Silver Thread Descends from the Void


“Greetings, Demon Subduer!”

Upon the White Stone Ritual Altar, the two presiding Grandmasters, their faces alight with joy, bowed towards Kundao.

Kundao and Zhang Zhenjun both held the rank of Second Grade, Nine Heavens Golden阙 Upper Minister, serving in the Celestial Court as Nine Heavens Demon Subduers, presiding over the North Pole Exorcism Department.

Both of them appeared noticeably weakened.  The short time spent summoning deities had taken a significant toll, and they had been struggling to maintain the ritual.

Moments ago, an anomaly had manifested on the ritual altar.  Both had sensed it, recognizing it as a sign of a breakthrough.

However, Zhenjun's exit from seclusion was too swift, leaving them apprehensive.  Now, seeing Zhenjun before them, they breathed a collective sigh of relief.  Zhenjun had just broken through, and their auras were unstable. Even they could sense that Zhenjun's cultivation was vastly different, the breakthrough a resounding success!

Kundao nodded slightly at them, then with a gentle tap of her foot, ascended into the air.  Her eyes shimmered with divine light as her gaze swept across the battlefields to the north and south, paying particular attention to the locations of several Grandmaster-level calamities, including Ji Zhenjing.

Ji Zhenjing.

The female crown, having transformed into the Taiyin Yuanjun, experienced a surge in power, but it also brought her unimaginable shock and pain.

This pain stemmed not only from the forceful infusion of power far exceeding her own cultivation level but also from the impact on her Primordial Spirit and will.

Summoning a Talisman Deity was an immense test for those undergoing transformation.

If one's temperament was insufficient and their will not firm enough, summoning a high-ranking Talisman Deity would only result in a desperate struggle to maintain sanity, leaving them unable to control such immense power.

For this reason, the Daoist sect emphasized cultivating disciples' temperaments. From their ordination and acceptance of precepts to their daily cultivation, they were required to adhere to the Daoist precepts.

The most common were the Three Refuges, Five Precepts, and Twelve Great Vows. Many Daoist sects also had their own unique precepts, such as the Xiang'er Nine Precepts, the Mingzhen Twenty-Four Precepts, and even the Three Hundred Grand Precepts!

The Daoist sect believed that the mortal world was tainted by six emotions and five desires, clouding the inner heart and corrupting the external environment.

Upholding the precepts and regulations, abstaining from evil deeds, not only tempered one's Dao Heart but also refined their virtuous conduct and accumulated merit.

As a Grandmaster, the female crown's temperament was naturally exceptional, allowing her to withstand the impact.

Her delicate body trembled, fists clenched, and jade-like arms strained with visible veins as she arduously restrained the immense power within her.

“Roar!”

A tiger's roar echoed from beyond the city, resonating like thunder.

The Daoist cultivators who had charged out of the city had long since retreated, using the city walls as a barrier to cast spells and slay the beast tide outside.

Blood flowed like rivers outside the city, and the corpses of ferocious beasts piled up like mountains. Yet, the beasts were endless, trampling over their fallen comrades and frantically assaulting the city walls.

The city walls, protected by the city's defensive formation, shimmered with a golden light, appearing impregnable.

When the tiger's roar echoed, the beast tide's offensive noticeably slowed. However, the Daoist cultivators within the city showed no signs of joy, instead staring at the scene outside with fear etched upon their faces.

From amidst billowing yellow smoke outside the city, a ferocious tiger emerged, crushing mountains beneath its paws as it charged towards them. With a mighty leap from the final peak, it soared into the air.

‘Crack!’

The mountain crumbled.

The tiger, airborne, opened its blood-red maw and roared as it lunged towards the immortal city, completely disregarding the city's void-trapping formation.

Even through the city walls and the formation, everyone clearly sensed the tiger's terrifying aura.

The Daoist cultivators trembled with fear, while the demonic soldiers fared even worse.  They fidgeted restlessly, some even trembling and falling to their knees. Were it not for the strict laws binding them, they would have scattered in terror.

At this moment, the pain on the female crown's face subsided as the power within her finally stabilized.

She raised her right hand, her fingers tracing a delicate path through the void, her flowing sleeves dancing with her slender hand.

Spiritual energy coalesced at her fingertips, leaving a moon-white trail in their wake.

In an instant, a divine talisman materialized.

This talisman was known as the Taiyin Mirror Talisman.  Previously, the female crown would have required extensive preparation, supplemented by complex hand seals and incantations, to barely manage its casting, with no guarantee of success.

Now, she drew it in the air with ease, the talisman forming instantly!

With a flick of her wrist, she gently tapped the talisman.

The ferocious tiger was now within striking distance, its massive forepaws, like two colossal stone pillars, about to slam into the city walls!

The cultivators could see the fearsome glint in the tiger's eyes and the razor-sharp claws on its paws, filling them with terror.

‘Whoosh!’

The talisman transformed into a stream of light, shooting towards the tiger, stopping just before it.

The next moment, the light erupted, resembling a brilliant moon.

The moonlight was dazzling, and within it, the silhouette of a moon hung suspended before the tiger, like a precious mirror reflecting its image.

The tiger's roar abruptly ceased.  Its fierce gaze shifted from the immortal city to the Taiyin Mirror Talisman, its fur standing on end.

It sensed an inexplicable binding force emanating from the mirror, as if attempting to draw it in.

However, the threat posed by the Taiyin Mirror Talisman's aura was far less than that of the Pojun Divine Sword's shadow.

Facing the Taiyin Mirror Talisman, the tiger showed no sign of retreat. It roared even louder, its forepaws, originally aimed at the city, now lashing out, striking the mirror with savage force.

‘Slap!’

The mirror trembled violently.

It had actually withstood the blow!

Before anyone could cheer, a series of 'slap, slap, slap' sounds echoed as the tiger's claws relentlessly pounded the mirror.

Cracks quickly appeared on the mirror's surface, the sound of its shattering reaching the city, causing everyone's hearts to tremble.

The female crown's breathing grew rapid.  She stepped forward, hovering above the city walls, her arms outstretched as the city's defensive formation blazed with a blinding golden light.

Even transformed into the Taiyin Yuanjun, wielding power comparable to a Grandmaster, she was no match for the tiger.  Moreover, her divine power was gradually fading, forcing her to rely on the formation to defend the city.

Simultaneously, the Daoist cultivators understood their role. Led by Ruoquan Zhenren and others, they formed formations to support the female crown.

‘Crack!’

The mirror shattered!

The tiger roared triumphantly, charging forward and slamming headfirst into the city.

‘Boom!’

The earth shook violently.

A crack appeared on the city wall, countless buildings within the city collapsed, and many Daoist cultivators were thrown back by the impact.

The female crown cast several talismans in rapid succession, stabilizing the formation.

The tiger was nearly frenzied.  Its attacks were straightforward and brutal, its head like a battering ram, repeatedly striking the barrier of the city's defensive formation.

‘Boom! Boom! Boom!’

The formation teetered on the brink of collapse.

The cultivators within the city paled.

The female crown exerted all her strength, protecting the city beneath her and the Daoist disciples behind her.

‘Wah!’

The female crown suddenly spat out a mouthful of blood, her figure stumbling, eliciting cries of alarm.

“Li Zhenren!”

Ruoquan Zhenren cried out in alarm, flying forward to support her.

The female crown shook her head, pushing Ruoquan Zhenren away, swallowing a medicinal pill, and continuing to cast talismans.

…

Everything unfolded before Kundao's eyes.

She flashed between the two Grandmasters, holding the White Stone Capital Merit Seal, and softly said, "Take the pills."

Her voice, amplified by the ritual altar, reached every branch altar.

Furthermore, the Central Mao Capital Ritual Altar, as well as the Jing Altar and Zong Altar under the Tianshu Department's jurisdiction, could all hear her command.

Kundao took control of the Daoist sect's dual capitals, issuing a command that reverberated throughout the land!

Including the two Grandmasters at the Central Mao Capital Ritual Altar, the cultivators presiding over each altar, upon hearing Zhenjun's decree, were overjoyed. They followed the order, consuming the pills and seizing the opportunity to recover.

Kundao then retrieved a wooden sword, three feet long, crafted from an unknown type of spiritual wood.  The dark red blade displayed clear wood grain, and a tassel hung from the hilt.

This was a Daoist ritual sword, often used during altar ceremonies. It possessed the power to summon divine generals, exorcise evil spirits, subdue demons, and even break through hells to guide the deceased.

‘Swish!’

Kundao raised the ritual sword, pointing it towards the heavens.

“Flying celestial fiery winds, swirling divine dew.”

A faint chanting voice resonated.

The White Stone Capital Merit Seal, hovering before Kundao, shimmered with spiritual light, causing the ritual altar within the Ordination Hall to resonate, radiating a golden glow.

Simultaneously, similar phenomena appeared on the ritual altars throughout the dual capitals.

The cultivators presiding over the altars were still refining the pill's energy within their bodies. Seeing this, they were about to act but realized that this ritual was different, requiring no action from them.

This ritual only required Zhenjun and the Grandmasters to channel the power of all the ritual altars under the Daoist sect's jurisdiction!

Where the ritual sword pointed, talismanic light flickered in the void, talismanic characters the size of bushels appearing against the backdrop of heaven and earth, as if the very sky were a talismanic paper.

‘Swish!’

Kundao pointed the sword towards the East Pole.

“East rises the sun's valley, west moves the dragon's platform.”

Swiftly turning to the west, then moving north and south.

“South swirls the fire mansion, north turns the river's chief.”

The chanting voice, infused with divine power, reached the azure heavens.

Finally, Kundao once again raised the sword towards the sky. The divine talismans in the void ignited, flames filling the sky before transforming into a stream of light that shot towards the Nine Heavens.

“Drive the dragon, summon the rain, talisman arrives, swiftly pursue!”

The incantation concluded.

Suddenly, the battlefield was engulfed in a violent storm.

‘Crack!’

Thunder rumbled.

The cultivators desperately defending the immortal city looked up, seeing the sky above shrouded in dark clouds, obscuring even the moon.

‘Whoosh! Whoosh!’

The clouds gathered, signaling an imminent downpour.

This celestial phenomenon wasn't limited to a single immortal city.  The Daoist sect's dual capitals, as well as the Jushan Capital, at both the north and south ends, all locations under attack by the beast tide, were covered in dark clouds.

A heavy sense of oppression permeated the battlefield.

‘Rumble!’

Thunderclouds rolled.

Some noticed figures amidst the lightning above the clouds. These figures appeared menacing and indistinct, soaring through the clouds like descending deities.

Some wielded thunder cones, striking them repeatedly, sending bolts of lightning arcing through the air.

Some clutched enormous sacks, their mouths wide open, unleashing gusts of wind.

Some embraced earthen jars, pouring forth endless water that transformed into clouds.

…

“They are celestial soldiers and generals!”

“Zhenjun has summoned celestial beings to aid us!”

…

Some uninformed cultivators cheered.

This was another method of summoning deities, aside from transformation. Kundao, through talismans and commands, summoned celestial beings, harnessing the power of the Celestial Court's Talisman Deities, greatly enhancing the talismans' might.

The talisman she was currently employing was called the Rain Summoning Talisman. It sounded ordinary, but it possessed the power to:

Summon thunder with the Thunder God.

Stir winds with the Wind Lord.

Command rain with the Rain Master!

As the dark clouds converged, the battlefield's spiritual energy was devoured, a spiritual tide surging into the clouds, making the shadowy figures within appear even more mystical.

‘Crack!’

‘Whoosh!’

Torrential rain began to fall upon the battlefield.

This was no ordinary rain.

Raindrops falling upon enemies became blades and swords, while those falling upon their own cultivators were like sweet dew.

The downpour washed over the battlefield.

Beneath the curtain of rain, countless ferocious beasts perished.

The Daoist cultivators felt as if they had consumed miraculous elixirs. Not only were their injuries and pain alleviated, but their Qi Seas were also nourished.

Locations like Ji Zhenjing received particular attention.

The downpour cascaded down like a celestial waterfall. The female crown, bathed in the rain, regained some color in her face. Conversely, the ferocious tiger outside the city, battered by the cascading water, shook its head frantically, its expression pained.  It finally abandoned its assault on the city wall, spewing yellow clouds to shield itself from the rain.

In an instant, the Daoist sect's side gained a surge of momentum!

The dire situation on the battlefield was temporarily alleviated, especially for the critically endangered Jushan Capital, for whom this support was invaluable.

Kundao sheathed her sword, her gaze shifting as she suddenly looked towards the Gangshan Capital.

Within the Great Sage Mansion.

A demon king, currently beating the Demon Summoning Drum, felt a sudden chill in his heart.

The surrounding demon kings also experienced a similar sensation, their hairs standing on end, their faces filled with apprehension.

Fortunately, this ominous feeling was fleeting.

Kundao did not attack the Great Sage Mansion to seize the Demon Summoning Drum. Her gaze shifted upwards, towards the Southern Heavenly Gate.

At this moment, Tianyue Shangren and the five-clawed golden dragon were locked in a fierce battle, sword light and golden flames intermingling in a chaotic display.

Tianyue Shangren, alone with his sword, faced the transformed five-clawed golden dragon and the demon formations within the Great Sage Mansion.

He firmly blocked the enemy's path, repelling each of the dragon's assaults with his sword.

However, he paid a heavy price.

Tianyue Shangren's face was as pale as paper, a streak of blood staining the corner of his mouth. Yet, his demeanor remained unwavering, standing tall before the Southern Heavenly Gate like a guardian deity!

The two Grandmasters were unable to conceal the aura of their breakthroughs, which had already been detected by the five-clawed golden dragon in the sky.

The dragon grew even more frenzied, swirling with golden flames and demonic lightning, launching itself recklessly at Tianyue Shangren.

Kundao dared not act rashly at this time, only diverting a portion of the Rain Summoning Talisman's power to aid Tianyue Shangren's recovery.

Her gaze continued to ascend, passing through the Southern Heavenly Gate and into the Celestial Court.

She saw the celestial mountains and divine halls, and the streaks of light flitting between them.

Her gaze lingered on Qin Sang for a moment before continuing upwards, past the Nine Heavens and Nine Skies, the Thunder Ancestor's Hall, and the Divine Firmament Upper Palace, until she reached even higher.

There lay the profound night sky, which should have been tranquil and silent, but was now disturbed by the Celestial Court's emergence.

Within the boundless void, ripples appeared.

Like gentle waves on water, the ripples gradually spread, their range expanding.  At the center of the ripples, a silver glint suddenly flashed.

Immediately after, a silver thread probed into this realm, descending from the heavens.

The silver thread was thin and transparent, like an ordinary fishing line. Its tip flickered gently, causing ripples in the void as it rapidly descended, its target the Celestial Court!

In the blink of an eye, the tip of the silver thread reached the Celestial Court, pausing briefly before plummeting downwards!

‘Boom!’

The Southern Heavenly Gate shook violently.

Kundao's expression drastically changed.

…

Within the Celestial Court.

Qin Sang was fleeing for his life.

Two demon kings pursued and intercepted him, forcing him to rely on repeated instantaneous movements to survive.

But this was not a sustainable strategy. Even if Qin Sang himself could endure, the Celestial Patrolling Divine Prohibition was nearing its limit.

The golden dragon pulling the chariot became increasingly illusory. Its scales were still faintly visible, but after a few more uses, only a dragon's shadow might remain.

Even now, no reinforcements from the Daoist sect were in sight.

Qin Sang entered a divine hall. The spiritual light barrier outside the hall would be breached in an instant, giving him only a brief respite before he had to flee again. His expression was numb, bordering on despair.

This time was different from previous crises. He had no recourse, no idea how to escape the two demon kings.

‘Rumble!’

Before escaping, Qin Sang noticed that the divine hall's tremors felt unusual.

Initially thinking reinforcements had arrived, Qin Sang's hope was rekindled. However, after fleeing, he realized that wasn't the case.

The source of the tremors came from above!

At this moment, Qin Sang, the two demon kings, and the demon gods who had broken through the restrictions within Thunder City, all felt a premonition and looked towards the sky.

Ripples undulated in the void above the Celestial Court, and a silver thread pierced through the Celestial Court's barrier!
