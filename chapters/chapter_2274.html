<h1>Chapter 2264: Taking the Place Of</h1><p>There was no one else around, not a single living creature.  The silence was deathly, as if Qin Sang had entered a desolate realm.</p><p>Qin Sang believed that if the celestial omen targeted them, the outsiders, more than just him would have entered. Perhaps the place was simply too vast, and he hadn't encountered anyone yet.  In reality, only a fraction of those who set out had successfully reached the illusory realm and participated in the struggle for the divine mountain's seats.</p><p>“There are no changes in my body…”</p><p>Qin Sang frowned slightly. He paused, sensing himself, harboring a hope that this celestial event might restore his real-world cultivation. But it hadn't!</p><p>“Strange… hm?”</p><p>Qin Sang's expression suddenly shifted, as if sensing something. He looked up at the empty sky. To his perception, this world, though seemingly calm on the surface, was filled with countless chaotic energies. Among these chaotic energies, a peculiar fluctuation caught Qin Sang's attention. It was an unknown, mysterious force pervading the heavens and earth, flowing towards a single direction. That direction seemed to hold something extraordinary, exerting a strange pull on him.</p><p>There were no clues here, the mysterious Azure Bird had vanished, leaving him seemingly only one option: to follow his intuition.</p><p>Without hesitation, Qin Sang took to the air, flying in that direction. He silently calculated how long his Sky-Feeling Thunder Robe could last, hoping to uncover the secrets here before the robe dissipated.</p><p>At the same time Qin Sang entered, others appeared elsewhere in this world.</p><p>…</p><p>In a mountain stream.</p><p>A rock rose from the riverbed, a foot above the water's surface.  The rushing water splashed against it, keeping it perpetually wet, covered in a layer of moss.  Suddenly, a figure appeared on the rock.</p><p>This person had colorful hair and a pair of natural bird wings – a Shengyu tribesman of the Otherkin.  He materialized here, gazing at the utterly unfamiliar surroundings with a mixture of surprise and bewilderment.</p><p>He was the tribal chief who had vanished before everyone's eyes.</p><p>As the war intensified, several of the clan's elite warriors, the pillars of their strength, had fallen on the battlefield. Their deaths were a devastating blow. Continue this way, and the clan would be bled dry.</p><p>After much reflection, the clan decided they couldn't sacrifice any more youngsters.  He gathered the elders and was about to secretly hide away the most gifted children, feigning their deaths.  But then, the change occurred.</p><p>“What happened? How did I get here?”</p><p>He was filled with astonishment, confusion, and fear.  Anyone would be terrified by such an event. Given the formidable reputation of the Celestial City, his first thought was that their plan had been leaked!</p><p>But then, he sensed a strand of energy wrapping around him – an unfamiliar energy, yet strangely familiar, deepening his confusion and furrowing his brow.</p><p>After a moment, his brow relaxed slightly. He murmured, “I am Xi Rui.”</p><p>His voice was first shocked, but by the end of the sentence, he was calm, utterly understanding.</p><p>He’d always felt like something was missing, often gazing at the night sky until dawn.  He'd searched for it, but never knew where to begin. Years of contemplation yielded only fragmented images from his mind, their meaning elusive.</p><p>This wasn't his true self.  He was deceived by this hidden realm's power, whether a projection, an illusion, or something else.  His true body, in reality, should still be meditating on the divine mountain!</p><p>'Buzz...buzz...buzz...'</p><p>His wings vibrated, the colorful feathers trembling.  He instinctively clenched his fist.</p><p>Connecting with that strand of energy was like opening a door.  He felt his own power returning!</p><p>“This is the real me!”</p><p>Xi Rui’s voice was filled with excitement, his eyes gleaming as he surveyed his surroundings.  He had not forgotten his mission.  Everything indicated that, after so many years lost in this hidden realm, the time had finally come!</p><p>“Hm?”</p><p>Suddenly, Xi Rui’s expression turned uncertain again.</p><p>The energy, while restoring his strength, seemed to hold an ominous threat, rapidly approaching!</p><p>“Could it be…”</p><p>Xi Rui instantly understood, his face turning pale.</p><p>He spread his wings, several of the most vibrant feathers detaching themselves. These feathers transformed into pure light, forming a suit of shining armor that enveloped him.</p><p>A cloaking device concealed Xi Rui's presence, minimizing his energy fluctuations.  He vanished in a flash.</p><p>Shortly after Xi Rui's departure, a streak of light pierced the air.</p><p>The light was multicolored, like a rainbow bridge spanning the heavens.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>The light descended, landing precisely where Xi Rui had stood, revealing a figure.</p><p>This person also had colorful hair and bird-like wings, and looked exactly like Xi Rui.  He was even more like the real Xi Rui than the previous one!</p><p>He scanned his surroundings, a strange light flashing in his eyes. He coldly snorted, "He escaped quickly! Let's see how far he can run!"</p><p>Before he finished speaking, he too disappeared.</p><p>Between two mountains, a fertile plain naturally formed.  The plain was lush with vegetation and rippling green waves.  A young boy sat on the grass.</p><p>He sat with his hands on the ground, his face filled with terror.  He was the water-carrying boy, just moments before lost in daydreams of a bright future, now stranded in this unknown place.</p><p>His village and the stream were gone.  The scene before him was unlike anything he had ever seen.</p><p>"Ghost! Ghost!"</p><p>The boy, remembering terrifying tales from village elders, was overcome with fear. He hugged himself tightly, screaming.</p><p>"Please! Don't eat me! Don't eat me…"</p><p>The boy trembled uncontrollably.  Unnoticed, a wisp of energy wrapped around him.</p><p>Unlike Xi Rui, the boy had no cultivation and didn't sense this energy. In his extreme terror, he was unaware of the changes in his body.</p><p>His screams continued for a while before he noticed something, his expression becoming vacant.</p><p>"Ah!"</p><p>He suddenly clutched his head, rolling on the ground in agony.  Memories fragmented and his original power flooded into his body.</p><p>Unfortunately, he was too weak, not a cultivator, just an ordinary mortal.</p><p>But after the pain, the boy finally understood everything.</p><p>"My name is Xu Mu…"</p><p>The boy knelt on the ground, covered in mud and grass, breathing heavily. He was Xu Mu, from the Taishang Dao lineage, who had once competed with Qin Sang and Liuli for the Chunqiu Gui. He lacked Qin Sang's overwhelming power, but had allied with the Yi people and secured a position on the divine mountain.</p><p>Even now, the confusion and shock hadn't entirely faded.  The truth shattered the boy's worldview.</p><p>When Xu Mu finally regained himself, he felt an unsettling unease linger.  But he had wasted too much time; it was too late.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>A gentle breeze swept across the meadow, the green waves undulating. Xu Mu felt a chill and, ignoring his disheveled appearance, immediately began hand seals, transforming into a green light to escape.</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>The green light had only flown three meters when it struck an invisible barrier and was flung back with even greater force.</p><p>Then, Xu Mu saw another version of himself appear before him, his face filled with horror.</p><p>"You…"</p><p>The other Xu Mu stared at him, a strange smile on his face, "I am you!"</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>Several familiar threads shot towards him.</p><p>Xu Mu's heart pounded; he recognized his natal treasure, the Ju Yuan Spear.  Not only was the treasure identical, but the opponent's techniques were almost exactly the same.</p><p>In this critical moment, Xu Mu instinctively summoned his own Ju Yuan Spear. With his cultivation and memories restored, his possessions, including his treasure, had returned. Countering the opponent's spear was his best option.</p><p>Identical threads flew from Xu Mu, the seemingly delicate strands colliding in mid-air between the two.</p><p>*Bang bang bang…*</p><p>The shockwave was immense; the surrounding peaks trembled violently.</p><p>A blinding light erupted from the battlefield, and then a figure flew out, his breath ragged.</p><p>Surprisingly, it was the original Xu Mu who was on the defensive!</p><p>In that moment, Xu Mu understood. The other Xu Mu was likely the grey figure that had pursued him within the radiant light.  The light and this illusory domain were clearly deeply connected.</p><p>The grey figure had not only been reborn here, possessing all of Xu Mu’s abilities, but had also developed intelligence!</p><p>In reality, the grey figure was no match for Xu Mu because it lacked sentience, only knowing how to attack relentlessly. Xu Mu could have escaped by simply leaving the radiant light.</p><p>Now, the situation was drastically different. The grey figure's power was incomparable, even improving upon its learned abilities to become stronger.</p><p>Conversely, Xu Mu hadn't fully recovered his strength.  The disparity was clear; he was no match for the gray figure!</p><p>What did the gray figure want with him?</p><p>Could it be…replacement?</p><p>Another Xu Mu calmly emerged from the aftermath, unscathed.  The expectation and greed in his gaze sent a chill down Xu Mu's spine.</p><p>'Crack!'</p><p>A sharp sound suddenly echoed behind him, like something breaking.</p><p>A flash of yellow light flickered in the void. Above the yellow light, a talisman appeared, shattering the treasure within the light and annihilating it both.</p><p>Xu Mu was startled.  He felt true fear, for this Spirit Root Pearl was his last lifeline.</p><p>Ironically, the method used to break the pearl was a talisman learned from him!</p><p>'Plop plop plop!'</p><p>The other Xu Mu didn't give him a chance to breathe.</p><p>Xu Mu felt his body suddenly become incredibly heavy. The ground beneath him melted into mud, from which black, mud-like hands emerged, grasping at his legs.</p><p>Xu Mu fought back, but he was no match for the other Xu Mu. After several exchanges, he was completely overwhelmed.</p><p>Finally, a shadow enveloped him, and a gigantic spirit tree, larger than any mountain, descended from the sky, crashing down on him.</p><p>Xu Mu's protective aura shattered, and he fell heavily to the ground, spitting blood.</p><p>Then his vision darkened, and that all-too-familiar face appeared before him, inches away. Xu Mu felt an unprecedented sense of crisis, but he was powerless to resist.</p><p>"I am you, you are me! Hahaha…"</p><p>The gray figure stared intently into Xu Mu's eyes, laughing maniacally.</p><p>The laughter echoed through the mountains.</p><p>The next moment, a horrifying scene unfolded. The gray figure reached a hand into Xu Mu's forehead, then an entire arm, and finally its entire body, disappearing into Xu Mu's being.</p><p>The pain on Xu Mu's face gradually faded, replaced by a vacant stare.</p><p>On a mountain not far from the battlefield, Qin Sang watched this scene unfold, his expression changing.</p><p>He had discovered Xu Mu shortly after leaving and had been observing from afar, never expecting to witness such a terrifying sight.</p><p>"That was Xu Mu? What are the consequences of being possessed by a shadow demon? Will he be replaced in the real world too...?"</p><p>Qin Sang watched the fissure in Xu Mu's forehead slowly close, a chill running down his spine.</p><p>This scene was too terrifying!</p><p>This illusion was far more dangerous than he had imagined. If he couldn't recover after returning to reality, someone else would be walking around in his skin – a fate worse than death.</p><p>Xu Mu gave up struggling; his fate was sealed.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang sensed unusual fluctuations. Someone was flying towards him.</p><p>Protected by the Sky-Awakening Thunder Robe, he didn't fear exposure, and looked towards the horizon. At the same time, he caught a glimpse of Xu Mu's body, now possessed by the shadow demon, beginning to dissipate, eventually fading into nothingness.</p><p>In a flash, a streak of light appeared on the horizon. Qin Sang recognized it.</p><p>"That technique… it's Xi Rui!"</p><p>During the Divine Mountain battle, Qin Sang had paid close attention to the top experts, including the Feather Clan prince and Xi Rui.</p><p>Xi Rui seemed to be under attack, most likely by his shadow demon.</p><p>However, Xi Rui's condition was significantly better than Xu Mu's; his strength seemed almost fully restored.</p><p>Qin Sang mused that this difference probably stemmed from their performance in the illusion.</p><p>Xu Mu was merely a mortal in the illusion, possibly having been reborn countless times, his spirit gradually worn down until he completely succumbed, thus hindering his recovery.  Those who reincarnated fewer times, or even those who discerned the illusion's nature, would undoubtedly recover faster, like Xi Rui.</p><p>So why hadn't his own strength recovered? Was it because of the Sky-Awakening Thunder Robe?</p><p>Qin Sang pondered.</p><p>As the Xu Mu shadow demon had said, the shadow demon was actually himself within the illusion, only this self had betrayed him.</p><p>The meeting of two selves, essentially the convergence of the real world and the illusion, allowed him to find himself and break free from the illusion's constraints.  This realm seemed to be where reality and illusion intertwined.</p><p>However, the connection between him and his shadow demon was severed by the Sky-Awakening Thunder Robe given to him by the mysterious Azure Qilin, so the shadow demon couldn't find him, and his strength hadn't recovered.</p><p>––</p><p>––</p><p>I was too tired last night. I meant to rest for a bit, but I fell asleep. Luckily I woke up early and could finish this.</p>
