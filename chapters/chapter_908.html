<h1>Chapter Nine Hundred: Connecting the Threads</h1><p>Those present were all cunning and experienced, and naturally, they wouldn't be easily fooled.</p><p>However, Lándòu Sect did indeed have two Nascent Soul ancestors, and Elder Lu publicly acknowledged that the other party was his fellow sect brother from the most mysterious lineage.</p><p>Moreover, they didn't know what was happening inside the Bamboo Pavilion. They only heard the accusations but not Elder Lu's rebuttal.</p><p>Although the Bamboo Pavilion was enveloped by a sea of blood, which didn't seem like a righteous method, the crowd knew nothing about the true inheritances of the Bullfighting Peak.  Such secrecy must have a reason, even if it involved cultivating some demonic technique.</p><p>These coincidences combined made them suspicious.</p><p>If they got involved in the internal strife of the Lándòu Sect, their own safety was secondary. If their sects were implicated, one careless mistake could destroy the foundations left by their ancestors.</p><p>With the situation unclear, everyone had reservations. They stared intently at the Bamboo Pavilion, contemplating for a while, unsure whether or not to intervene, and how to intervene.</p><p>The young man surnamed Fang didn't expect to keep up the charade for long. As long as Elder Lu was trapped, once his junior brothers succeeded, they would immediately withdraw.</p><p>……</p><p>Amidst the chaos, no one noticed that Daoist Mingyue had disappeared.</p><p>Qin Sang was rushing towards his avatar's location.</p><p>He held the Qingfu Coin in his hand; the child coin had surprisingly returned.</p><p>Before the incident in the Bamboo Pavilion, Qin Sang sensed something amiss with the Qingfu Coin and received a message from his avatar, unsure what had happened. Just as he was anxious, wondering how to escape, the fight broke out inside the Bamboo Pavilion.</p><p>The Lándòu Sect's internal strife involved the Bullfighting Peak, which he was most concerned about.</p><p>Naturally, he was extremely curious about what was happening inside the Bamboo Pavilion, but he didn't expect his avatar to have an accident at this time.</p><p>Now he could only put this matter aside, seize the opportunity to escape, and prioritize rescuing his avatar.</p><p>"My avatar has the Soul Devouring Cone and the Sky Eye Butterfly. What on Clarity Island could threaten him? How could both things happen at the same time? I should have stopped him from going out…"</p><p>Qin Sang sighed inwardly, somewhat regretful.</p><p>He used his escape technique with all his might, racing against time, and soon arrived near the Lándòu Sect's territory.</p><p>At this moment, he noticed a chaotic stream of escaping light flying towards him from the front, clearly those Lándòu Sect disciples had discovered the anomaly at the entrance.</p><p>Qin Sang's figure melted into the shadows, his speed undiminished, flashing past them right under their noses.  Soon after, Qin Sang finally sensed his avatar's location and felt a sudden relief.</p><p>His avatar was safe.</p><p>Qin Sang's figure flickered, silently passing through the restrictions. At the same time, he captured his avatar's thoughts, learning about all that had happened, and was utterly astonished.</p><p>"Leave with them. Take the opportunity to get away!"</p><p>Qin Sang made a swift decision, instructing his avatar to withdraw.</p><p>At this point, there was no further need for the avatar. He should quickly leave this place of conflict and find a safe place to avoid being caught in the crossfire.</p><p>A mere Qi Refining stage disciple, as long as he was careful enough, those experts wouldn't notice him.</p><p>The avatar nodded slightly and turned to leave.</p><p>Standing on the mountaintop, Qin Sang gazed at the dark jungle ahead, his face still filled with surprise. He never expected things to develop like this. It seemed he had encountered an old foe.</p><p>His avatar and the Sky Eye Butterfly discovered Zhao Songqiao's unusual actions and witnessed him release a Witch Clan insect Gu.</p><p>This reminded the avatar of the Black Snake Mountain cultivators who infiltrated human territory and tricked him before.</p><p>The avatar thought it couldn't be such a coincidence, but one thing was certain: Zhao Songqiao was backed by a group of Witch Clan cultivators, also targeting the Lándòu Sect.</p><p>He just didn't know their purpose, or why they sent someone with a Gu insect into the Dark Thunderwood Forest.</p><p>Therefore, the avatar ordered the Sky Eye Butterfly not to disturb Zhao Songqiao and to wait and see.</p><p>Zhao Songqiao released the Gu insect and continued flying deeper into the forest, finally arriving at the deepest part of the jungle, right at the edge of Clarity Island's grand formation, sealed by white mist.</p><p>Then, he took out a dozen black flags, which the avatar had never seen before, and planted them in a nearby open space, where they disappeared from sight, seemingly some kind of forbidden magical tool.</p><p>Then, he remained motionless, seemingly waiting for the right moment.</p><p>The Gu insect began to fly around the forest, as if searching for something.</p><p>The Sky Eye Butterfly followed the Gu insect and watched as it finally stopped above an inconspicuous pool, hovering briefly before returning to Zhao Songqiao.</p><p>If not for the Gu insect leading the way, it would be difficult for anyone to notice anything unusual here.</p><p>Only after the Sky Eye Butterfly gazed at the pool did it discover that it was sealed by restrictions, far more powerful than the two layers of restrictions it had encountered after entering Clarity Island. They were simply incomparable.</p><p>There must be a secret of the Lándòu Sect hidden inside!</p><p>Seeing this, just as the avatar was considering whether to inform the main body, a sudden change occurred.</p><p>Zhao Songqiao and the Gu insect finally made a move.</p><p>Zhao Songqiao sent streams of incantations towards the open space. The black flags rose from the ground, forming a large flag formation. Billowing black smoke emerged from the flags, gathering more and more.</p><p>At the same time, the Gu insect's wings trembled, and its figure vanished into the black smoke.</p><p>The black smoke gathered by the formation slowly rose, drifting towards the white mist above. As the two distinctly colored mists met, they clashed fiercely, like fire meeting oil.</p><p>The black smoke seemed to possess some kind of corrosive power, gradually contaminating the white mist.</p><p>Simultaneously, strange movements appeared outside Clarity Island.</p><p>Upon seeing this, the avatar instantly understood. The other party was actually coordinating from both inside and outside to break through Clarity Island's grand formation!</p><p>This formation was set up by the Lándòu Sect's Sect Master with the combined efforts of several sects. Even Nascent Soul ancestors would likely find it difficult to break. But now, the formation's power was weakened due to the Dharma Assembly. Furthermore, these flag formations seemed specifically designed for breaking formations. Judging by the situation, with their coordinated efforts, they might actually be able to break through the white mist and enter.</p><p>He wondered how many people were outside the island and what their cultivation levels were.</p><p>However, there shouldn't be any Nascent Soul cultivators involved, otherwise, they wouldn't need to go to such lengths to infiltrate.</p><p>The avatar's cultivation was too low, and fearing exposure, he didn't dare remain nearby. He quickly crushed the Qingfu Coin to notify his main body, instructing the Sky Eye Butterfly to proceed with caution.</p><p>After understanding the whole situation, Qin Sang immediately realized that the incident in the Bamboo Pavilion wasn't an internal struggle at all. Those three Bullfighting Peak disciples were working with outsiders to infiltrate Clarity Island!</p><p>The control disc for Clarity Island's grand formation was in Elder Lu's hands. If any external enemies attacked the formation, Elder Lu would immediately detect it. With so many Core Formation cultivators on the island, it would be impossible for the enemy to intrude.</p><p>Now, Elder Lu was trapped in the Bamboo Pavilion, sealed by the sea of blood, unable to send out any messages. The attention of the others was also diverted, making it difficult to discover the anomaly here in a short time.</p><p>By the time the situation in the Bamboo Pavilion was resolved, these people would have already achieved their goal and escaped.</p><p>At the same time, Qin Sang connected even more things.</p><p>Witch Clan insect Gu, Lándòu Sect, Bullfighting Peak, an unknown treasure.</p><p>Dark Thunderwood Forest, the restricted pool…</p><p>Black Snake Mountain.</p><p>The mysterious person with unknown origins, capable of subduing the Kuilong and cultivating terrifying lightning techniques.</p><p>All these incidents seemed to be connected!</p>
