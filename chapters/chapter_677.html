<h1>Chapter 669: Departure</h1><p>Qin Sang filled all the Shao Yin magnetic bottles with earth煞 energy, preparing for any unforeseen circumstances, then took out the Black Water Mirror.  Having just performed a soul search, Qin Sang already understood this magical artifact. He couldn't help but feel fortunate that he hadn't allowed Du Han to unleash its full power; otherwise, capturing him so easily would have been impossible.</p><p>The Black Water Mirror could be used for both offense and defense, and was extremely versatile.  Especially on the defensive, the peculiar spiritual water sealed within the mirror could transform into a shield, a barrier, or many other forms to repel attacks, showcasing a remarkable ability to overcome strength with softness.  Its power increased by 10% when used in water battles, making it truly shine in the Stormy Demon Sea; a rare and valuable treasure indeed.</p><p>Qin Sang's face lit up with joy. Seeing that there was still ample time, he decided to refine the Black Water Mirror there.  The journey to the Stormy Demon Sea was long and perilous, and he naturally wanted to improve his strength as much as possible.</p><p>“By now, the Li Witch Palace must have noticed Du Han's death. By the time they send people to Xijiang to investigate, I'll be long gone from the Witch God Continent.”</p><p>Qin Sang sneered inwardly, erased Du Han's lingering aura from the artifact, and focused on refining it.</p><p>Three days later, a figure appeared above the canyon, then blurred and soared north.  At this time, the Black Water Mirror rested within Qin Sang's dantian. He familiarized himself with the artifact while using his Golden Core to nurture it and repair the spiritual essence damaged by the Blood-Soiled Divine Light.</p><p>Without Du Han as a hindrance, Qin Sang's speed increased significantly.  He returned to Pingbo Port in only seven days.  He made contact with several trading companies in the city, gathering information about the Canglang Sea and the Stormy Demon Sea.  He arrived at the east gate of Pingbo Port, their agreed meeting place, on the appointed day.</p><p>As soon as Qin Sang left the city gate, he heard Ran Luo's relieved voice, “Daoist Qingfeng, you're finally here! The caravan is about to depart. I haven't seen you, and I was afraid that you were detained by something important and would miss the time.”</p><p>Then, a figure emerged from the nearby distance—Ran Luo, looking at him with a slightly reproachful expression.</p><p>Clearly, Qin Sang's revealed skill in artifact refinement was highly valued by the Qiongyu Trading Company; otherwise, Ran Luo wouldn't be so enthusiastic.</p><p>“I apologize for keeping Daoist Ran waiting. I returned to the city earlier but didn't want to disturb your company, so I waited until now,”</p><p>Qin Sang bowed slightly and looked past Ran Luo, startled by the immense size of the caravan. He had assumed that even a large trading company would be of limited scale, greatly underestimating the situation.</p><p>Rows upon rows of large carts were lined up, pulled by tamed low-level demonic beasts.  But that was the least of it.  Within the caravan, Qin Sang sensed over a hundred powerful or concealed auras.  Each individual's cultivation base was no weaker than his own, and some were concealing their strength, making it impossible to gauge precisely.</p><p>“A single trading company with this many Golden Core experts?”</p><p>Qin Sang was secretly shocked. “Perhaps there's even a Nascent Soul ancestor among them.”</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang continuously observing the caravan, Ran Luo understood and smiled gently.  “Daoist, you misunderstand. Our Qiongyu Trading Company doesn't possess such deep resources.  Many others trusted us, and after we released news a month ago, many people contacted us, deciding to travel together. Adding to that many independent cultivators, this is the result. Such a large-scale caravan is quite rare.”</p><p>Qin Sang inwardly realized the situation.  With so many people, a diverse mix, there was less concern about the Qiongyu Trading Company harboring ulterior motives.</p><p>However, so many people traveling openly in Witch territory presented other concerns.</p><p>“Daoist Ran, have you noticed anything unusual about the major Witch clans recently? It seems to involve the Nascent Soul level.  I'm worried something might happen.  Isn't such a large-scale caravan too conspicuous…,”</p><p>Qin Sang carefully chose his words, using voice transmission to ask Ran Luo. He believed that the East Pole Alliance, with its resources, must have noticed certain signs.</p><p>Ran Luo's expression stiffened.  She looked Qin Sang up and down, glanced around cautiously, and gestured for him to go to a corner at the back of the caravan.  She said meaningfully, “I didn't expect you to be so well-informed, Daoist, to even know the Witch clan's secrets. You should know that I only learned some inside information from Elder Zou recently.”</p><p>“Great changes often start small.  The Witch clan's large-scale movements would inevitably show some signs.  I'm just more observant,” Qin Sang's words were vague, not revealing his source.</p><p>Ran Luo examined Qin Sang, her regard for him deepening. After a moment of thought, she transmitted her voice.</p><p>“Daoist, you don't know, but our Qiongyu Trading Company originally planned to depart for the Stormy Demon Sea six months later.  It was because we noticed the unusual activity of the Witch clan that we decided to leave now.</p><p>“If chaos erupts, and we're trapped in Pingbo Port, isolated and helpless, we'll certainly be abandoned by our kin.  Several major trading companies have also noticed this, so we secretly negotiated and decided to act together.”</p><p>To leave as quickly as possible, we only brought a small amount of light cargo, and all our personnel are at least Foundation Establishment cultivators.  Traveling light allows for greater speed.</p><p>“Elder Zou's previous visits to Houtu Sect and other places were to scout the situation.  The Wu tribes' sects are still calm; there's no need to worry. As long as we don't delay, we'll certainly escape.  And if we discover anything suspicious, we have a plan for a quick getaway.  Master Daoist, just follow me.”</p><p>The major trading companies are so pessimistic, they're already preparing to withdraw from the Wu God Continent?</p><p>Qin Sang's heart sank. The situation seems even more serious than he imagined.</p><p>Seeing that the Qiong Yu Trading Company had made proper arrangements, Qin Sang could only choose to leave with them.</p><p>After all, if a major conflict erupts, even choosing to leave Pingbo Harbor by ship won't escape Wu control; you'd be directly swept into the front lines of the battle. Going straight to Wu God Mountain is actually faster.</p><p>Reassuring Qin Sang, Ran Luo led him to a carriage.</p><p>Qin Sang was to share a carriage with Ran Luo. Besides them, there were two others, both Nascent Soul cultivators.</p><p>Four people in one carriage was a bit crowded and uncomfortable, but they had to endure it.</p><p>“Elder Zou is in the carriage ahead. Would Master Daoist like to meet him?” Ran Luo asked.</p><p>Qin Sang thought for a moment and shook his head.  “No, Elder Zou is busy managing the company.  I won't disturb him. I can visit him after we reach the Storm Sea.”</p><p>Ran Luo didn't insist. After settling Qin Sang, she flew to the front to oversee things. The lead carriages were already departing.</p><p>Qin Sang stepped onto the carriage's step, looking back at Pingbo Harbor one last time.</p><p>Most of the human cultivators on the Wu God Continent are gathered in this city.</p><p>The Qiong Yu Trading Company only took a select few important people. Those with insufficient cultivation were abandoned here.</p><p>If chaos breaks out, who knows what will become of these people?</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head. He could barely protect himself, let alone help others. He could only hope that the Wu tribe's Yuan Ying cultivators would remain peaceful, allowing this rare peace to continue.</p>
