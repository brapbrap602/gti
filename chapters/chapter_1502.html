<h1>Chapter 1493: Slaughtering Yin Blood Pool </h1><p>No one could have anticipated such an anomaly from touching the cicada shell.</p><p>Qin Sang had always been cautious, constantly guarding against unexpected changes from the ancient restrictions, attacks against himself. He had never expected, however, not an attack, but a suction force, so sudden and violent.</p><p>He was now in the void, standing between ancient restrictions, with no place to rely on, unable to resist the suction. He was pulled in on the spot.</p><p>Qin Sang felt a wave of dizziness, doing his utmost to maintain his form, urging the Wish-Fulfilling Jewel. After several attempts to break free from the suction failed, he could only focus on self-preservation.</p><p>'Whoosh… whoosh…'</p><p>Qin Sang heard the rushing wind, it felt as if he were falling rapidly.</p><p>But at this moment, he couldn't tell directions, unsure of where he was being pulled towards.</p><p>The good news was that the protective energy field was incredibly sturdy. Aside from the suction, there were no other attacks. He was unharmed.</p><p>"What caused this anomaly? Could the cicada shell be the key to opening some kind of secret realm?"</p><p>Qin Sang was temporarily safe, and these thoughts flashed through his mind one by one.</p><p>Just now, the instant he touched the cicada shell, Qin Sang faintly felt that this shell didn't seem to be left by the Eight-Winged Heart Cicada, it seemed like it had been refined.</p><p>Before he could understand, the anomaly occurred.</p><p>Just then, Qin Sang suddenly sensed something unusual nearby, catching a glimpse of a shadowy figure in his peripheral vision.</p><p>His expression changed slightly, his vigilance reaching its peak. He then discovered that it was a somewhat disheveled, familiar figure—it was actually Liuli, who should have been at Gluttonous Lake!</p><p>Liuli wasn't lacking in defensive Dharma treasures, but she didn't have the all-around protection of something like the Wish-Fulfilling Jewel.</p><p>She struggled against the suction, her衣裙 in disarray.</p><p>Noticing an uninvited guest beside her, Liuli's eyes flashed with vigilance. She also discovered it was Qin Sang, her expression relaxing, revealing a questioning look.</p><p>The two of them, who should have been in separate locations, were sucked into the same place.</p><p>They were like two dancers, dancing together within the suction, constantly spinning, but their movements were too chaotic, lacking any system.</p><p>The two exerted all their effort to get closer to each other, to avoid being separated again by the turbulent suction currents.</p><p>Faced with unknown changes, two people joining forces were clearly much more capable of dealing with danger than one alone.</p><p>Qin Sang spread his palm towards Liuli, revealing the cicada shell.</p><p>Just now, the instant the suction burst forth, Qin Sang didn't forget his duty, snatching the Eight-Winged Heart Cicada's shell at the fastest speed.</p><p>The cicada shell was the key.</p><p>Liuli cultivated the Ice Soul Divine Light; perhaps she could see something from it.</p><p>Seeing the cicada shell, Liuli's eyes lit up.</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>Just then, the suction suddenly disappeared into thin air.</p><p>The two were flung together into an unfamiliar space.</p><p>Qin Sang reacted extremely quickly, immediately stabilizing his body, breaking free from the inertia caused by the suction.</p><p>Before he even had time to take in his surroundings, Qin Sang flicked his sleeve, and demonic flames roared out, transforming into a fiery dragon circling his body, standing guard.</p><p>'Bang!'</p><p>Qin Sang landed heavily on the ground.</p><p>The sound of his landing echoed around him.</p><p>It was evident that this was an enclosed space.</p><p>He seemed to smell a faint scent of blood at the tip of his nose, which was abnormal.</p><p>Qin Sang's brow furrowed slightly, his heart filled with vigilance.</p><p>Immediately afterward, Liuli also landed beside him, transmitting her voice: "The ancient texts of Tingxue Tower record that this is the cicada shell of the Eight-Winged Ice Cicada, and it has an effect on the Ice Soul Divine Light…"</p><p>Eight-Winged Ice Cicada and Eight-Winged Heart Cicada, a difference of one word, both referring to the same spiritual insect, just with slight discrepancies in the records of different inheritances.</p><p>The Eight-Winged Heart Cicada's appearance was like a sculpture carved from profound ice; the name Ice Cicada was actually more fitting.</p><p>Liuli's words were abruptly interrupted by a voice.</p><p>"Over these years, you've continuously bought off the experts of various branches within the sect, eliminating dissidents. You've truly put in a lot of effort. Even if there hadn't been this incident in the sacred ground, you would have made a move against me after leaving. Now that your wings have grown, you're bold enough to gather them to assassinate your master in the sacred ground. Unfortunately, I've been planning for this day for hundreds of years. How could I let a little girl like you easily ruin it…"</p><p>The speaker's voice was hoarse and cold, like a demonic incantation.</p><p>There was actually someone else here!</p><p>Just hearing this voice, a deep chill rose in Liuli's heart, as if she were frozen, instinctively summoning the phoenix-shaped treasure sword, infinitely vigilant.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang, standing beside Liuli, his gaze like a sword, stared fixedly ahead, as if facing a great enemy.</p><p>They had been sucked into a spacious underground cavern, standing at the edge of the cavern.</p><p>The scent of blood Qin Sang had smelled earlier was not an illusion. In the center of the cavern, there was a circular blood pool, filled with bright red blood.</p><p>Three ice platforms extended from within the blood pool.</p><p>The ice platforms were covered in runes, densely packed, all drawn with blood-red threads. Under the reflection of the blood-red light, the ice platforms looked like blood platforms, scarlet and piercing, filled with a sense of evil.</p><p>This bizarre scene brought a huge shock to Qin Sang and Liuli's minds.</p><p>Most startlingly, on one of the ice platforms, a person was slumped.</p><p>This person was actually the Grand Elder of Profound Heaven Palace—Tong Lingyu!</p><p>Tong Lingyu was no longer her usual elegant self. She was covered in blood, her aura weak, severely injured. There were also two wounds on her beautiful face left by sharp blades, making her look pitiful.</p><p>Blood-red threads grew out from the ice platform, piercing deeply into the skin of Tong Lingyu's legs.</p><p>At this moment, her legs were already covered in blood-red threads, tightly entangled, unable to move.</p><p>And the blood-red threads were constantly spreading across her entire body, like chains, like blood-sucking worms, constantly devouring her vital energy, about to drag her into the abyss.</p><p>Tong Lingyu had almost lost the ability to resist, allowing the blood-red threads to devour her. The spirit treasure she controlled, the Four-Fold Flying Serpent Seal, was now thrown at the edge of the blood pool. She was no longer able to wield it, awaiting death.</p><p>This scene was extremely terrifying and chilling.</p><p>The person speaking was not Tong Lingyu. The voice came from an ice coffin standing at the edge of the blood pool.</p><p>The ice coffin had already been opened.</p><p>But the person inside had not come out. Cold mist lingered within the coffin, making the figure somewhat blurry.</p><p>This person wore a white robe, a jade crown, and had a dignified appearance, but his skin was extremely pale, with blue veins exposed, completely lacking in color, unlike a normal person, forming a stark contrast with the blood-stained Tong Lingyu.</p><p>The Four-Fold Flying Serpent Seal was thrown at his feet, as if expressing submission to this person.</p><p>In the vast underground cavern, besides Qin Sang and Liuli, there were only the person in the coffin and Tong Lingyu, no other cultivators of Profound Heaven Palace were seen.</p><p>Seeing this person.</p><p>Qin Sang's pupils contracted sharply.</p><p>He had heard Shi Xue describe the appearance of the Palace Master of Profound Heaven Palace. The person in the coffin was actually Yin Changsheng!</p><p>The bizarre scene caused Qin Sang's mind to tense abruptly, a sense of foreboding welling up within him.</p><p>From the Palace Master of Profound Heaven Palace, Qin Sang felt an extremely dangerous sensation. He hadn't felt this even when facing Old Demon Hun and the Great Sage Tianpeng.</p><p>Demons had invaded the sacred ground.</p><p>The two helmsmen of Profound Heaven Palace weren't driving away the demons, but were fighting amongst themselves here.</p><p>The area outside the blood pool was a mess, the ground covered in ice shards, clearly indicating a fierce battle had taken place. Tong Lingyu had been utterly defeated, her spirit treasure lost, herself captured alive, trapped in the blood pool.</p><p>What exactly had happened?</p><p>Why were he and Liuli pulled in to witness this scene?</p><p>The cicada shell… was a trap!</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly remembered the words Bing Yao had reminded Liuli of—Be careful of the Palace Master!</p><p>This trap was likely originally intended for Bing Yao.</p><p>Bing Yao probably hadn't discovered that the cicada shell was a trap either; otherwise, she would definitely have warned Liuli, and wouldn't have let Liuli come back to retrieve the treasure.</p><p>It was just that she sensed danger from the Palace Master, fled to the Northern Star Region, and was later trapped in the Purple Star Palace, inadvertently escaping this calamity.</p><p>He and Liuli had unwittingly taken her place.</p><p>What was the Palace Master's goal?</p><p>Were the other two ice platforms in the blood pool prepared for him and Liuli?</p><p>Was this person still Yin Changsheng, or why would the dignified Palace Master attack the rising stars of the sect?</p><p>These thoughts flashed through Qin Sang's mind at lightning speed.</p><p>He had personally witnessed the ancient demon's possession in the Seven Kill Palace and was very sensitive to such matters. He instinctively made the connection. Coincidentally, there was also a demon-sealing ground in the Northern Sea.</p><p>However, none of this was important. Qin Sang's only thought at this moment was to leave the stone cavern!</p><p>Tong Lingyu, in control of a spirit treasure, had met such a miserable end. Qin Sang wouldn't be arrogant, but he also didn't believe he could defeat the Palace Master with the Sun God Tree, which he couldn't truly control.</p><p>If the Palace Master had been possessed, possessing the strength of the original demonic soul, it would be even more terrifying!</p><p>Qin Sang's divine sense swept behind him, his expression changing slightly.</p><p>After they were sucked in, the suction and the entrance mysteriously disappeared.</p><p>The stone cavern was densely packed with ancient restrictions; it was easy to enter but difficult to leave.</p><p>Qin Sang remained calm, secretly coordinating with the Heavenly Eye Butterfly to search for a way out.</p><p>In the blood pool.</p><p>Tong Lingyu's breathing was rapid, gradually losing control, unable to stop the invasion of the blood-red threads, smiling miserably, "You haven't entered the sacred ground twice already. I knew you would make a move against me one day, but I didn't expect you to choose this place. If I had known, I wouldn't have wasted so much time confirming your injuries."</p><p>"I'm curious, what made you realize it? Over these years, other than secretly guiding you to cultivate special cultivation techniques and divine powers, I haven't interfered with anything you've done."</p><p>Yin Changsheng seemed not to see Qin Sang and Liuli at the edge of the stone cavern, or rather, he didn't care about them.</p><p>He lowered his head slightly, his frozen tone showing fluctuation for the first time, curious about where he had slipped up, that Tong Lingyu was certain that he, the Palace Master, harbored ill intentions.</p><p>Demons had invaded.</p><p>Tong Lingyu saw an opportunity.</p><p>She had originally planned to wait until after returning from the sacred ground to make her move, and had been preparing for this matter. Now that the sacred ground was in chaos, it was a perfect opportunity to let Old Demon Hun and the Great Sage Tianpeng test Yin Changsheng.</p><p>If there was an opportunity, she would not hesitate to surround and kill Yin Changsheng.</p><p>Profound Heaven Palace was facing both internal and external troubles.</p><p>She could only choose to resolve the internal troubles first.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Yin Changsheng was one step ahead, striking first. Tong Lingyu was caught off guard and captured alive.</p><p>Hearing this, Qin Sang understood.</p><p>At the entrance to the sacred ground, Tong Lingyu had transmitted a message to him to meet in the depths of the sacred ground. It wasn't the Palace Master's intention, but rather she wanted him to help her surround and kill the Palace Master.</p><p>Qin Sang secretly thought, "No wonder."</p><p>During the transaction after the Hunmo Assembly, Tong Lingyu readily agreed to all his requests and brought him into the Tingxue Tower camp, deliberately concealing his identity within Profound Heaven Palace.</p><p>When he and Liuli became Dao companions, Tong Lingyu blocked them at Lingxiao Peak, preventing him from facing the Palace Master directly.</p><p>Although the reasons were all very reasonable.</p><p>But one after another, these incidents all had traces of Tong Lingyu's guidance, keeping him out of the Palace Master's sight, so that he could strike unexpectedly in the future.</p><p>"Before Junior Sister Bing Yao left, she subtly reminded me to be careful. At that time, I didn't understand and wasn't vigilant. I never thought that the Palace Master, the teacher I've respected since childhood, would harbor ill intentions towards us!"</p><p>Tong Lingyu's tone was extremely complex, filled with pain.</p><p>Yin Changsheng's might shook the Northern Sea, his bearing supreme in the cultivation world. Who didn't respect him?</p><p>Within Profound Heaven Palace, Yin Changsheng was the stabilizing force, a respected teacher, caring for his juniors.</p><p>Was everything an illusion?</p><p>All a disguise?</p><p>"Bing Yao…"</p><p>Yin Changsheng's tone was faint, recalling this distant name, "Among you, she was the one I valued the most. She was very intelligent, with keen spiritual perception. Unfortunately, after she disappeared, I never found her again. Fortunately, she cultivated a good disciple. However, this alone wasn't enough for her to see through my plan."</p><p>Tong Lingyu took a breath, "At that time, I became a bit more vigilant, until… Senior Brother Luoyun attempted to break through to the late-stage Nascent Soul realm, and the Profound Heaven Branch claimed he failed, his true essence backlashing, causing his death. Only then did I confirm it was you!"</p><p>"Luoyun!"</p><p>Yin Changsheng was enlightened.</p><p>"You knew from that time. I wasn't cautious enough, I didn't notice you were spying in the dark. First, going berserk, then being injured by that mysterious expert last time, it turns out it was all intentional, deliberately suppressing your cultivation at the mid-stage Nascent Soul realm… I commend you for enduring for so long. With you as the Grand Elder, it should have been the fortune of Profound Heaven Palace."</p><p>Yin Changsheng sighed lightly.</p><p>Before his voice faded, the cold mist within the ice coffin flowed. Yin Changsheng waved his arm, and a piece of profound ice flew out from his sleeve, landing on another ice platform.</p><p>A handsome young man was frozen inside.</p><p>This person's aura was actually at the late-stage Nascent Soul realm!</p><p>The instant it landed on the ice platform, blood-red threads surged upwards frantically, easily penetrating the ice, piercing deeply into the handsome young man's body, quickly covering his entire body.</p><p>The young man's eyelids trembled slightly, as if he were still alive.</p><p>"Senior Brother Luoyun!"</p><p>Tong Lingyu cried out softly, her expression growing even more pained, "Senior Brother Luoyun respected you so much, regarded you as a teacher. How could you bear it!"</p><p>She sobbed in accusation, seemingly wanting to make a final effort to awaken a bit of Yin Changsheng's conscience.</p><p>"If Junior Sister Bing Yao hadn't disappeared, if Senior Brother Luoyun hadn't been harmed by you…</p><p>"Our generation should have produced at least three great cultivators!</p><p>"How prosperous would Profound Heaven Palace have been?</p><p>"Everything was destroyed by your selfishness!</p><p>"Where did that respected Palace Master everyone admired go?</p><p>"Was it… worth it?"</p><p>Was it worth it?</p><p>Was it worth it?</p><p>…</p><p>The questions echoed in the stone cavern.</p><p>Yin Changsheng's expression remained unchanged, but he was silent for a moment.</p><p>"What's wrong with destroying a generation!"</p><p>Yin Changsheng's tone was even colder than before, carrying a hint of madness, he shouted fiercely.</p><p>"Helping me reach the Deity Transformation stage, you could say you died for a worthy cause!"</p><p>Tong Lingyu was utterly despaired, closing her eyes in pain.</p><p>"You weren't injured by the tribulation. You should have died hundreds of years ago. To linger on, you used an evil technique to avoid the tribulation, sealing yourself in an ice coffin, defying the heavens. The evil technique has already caused you to fall into depravity, and now you're using an evil technique to break through! You've gone mad, you're no longer Yin Changsheng! You absolutely cannot succeed!"</p><p>The cold mist swirled.</p><p>Yin Changsheng let out a cold snort, his expression growing increasingly frenzied, "Although you've trapped yourself at the mid-stage Nascent Soul realm, your divine sense has reached the Manifestation stage, and your cultivation technique has a conception comparable to that of a great cultivator. You can barely support the Slaughtering Yin Blood Pool. I'll let you see it with your own eyes. As for the other ice platform…"</p><p>Yin Changsheng finally turned his gaze, looking directly at Qin Sang and Liuli for the first time!</p>
