<h1>Chapter 530: External Elixir</h1><p>Qin Sang stood in the shadows, his gaze fixed on the grand formation.</p><p>After observing it for a long time, he still couldn't locate the formation's core. Created by a Nascent Soul cultivator, the protective formation of the Verdant Sun Demonic Sect was incredibly intricate. Qin Sang felt a wave of dizziness and confusion, unable to make heads or tails of it, and had to give up.</p><p>He knew that even if he found the core, he wouldn't be able to break through.</p><p>His only way out was to wait for the Verdant Sun Demonic Sect to activate the formation themselves.</p><p>Qin Sang quickly pondered his options.</p><p>His presence had already been discovered, but the two disciples who spotted him were trapped and killed by the Ancestral Holy Fire, unable to relay the message.</p><p>However, time was running out. Once the Core Formation cultivator returned and rescued them, he would learn the truth and immediately lock down the mountain. The entire sect would then launch a relentless search, determined to capture him.</p><p>His previous tactic of hiding in the shadows and waiting for an opportunity to escape wouldn't work anymore.</p><p>He would be trapped like a turtle in a jar, with nowhere to run.</p><p>Qin Sang was currently weakened. Before fully mastering the power of the Corpse Elixir, he couldn't force his way into the green light to silence the witnesses.</p><p>He even doubted that even with full control of the Corpse Elixir, without Verdant Sun Demonic Fire to appease the Ancestral Holy Fire, he would likely perish before he could kill them.</p><p>He had experienced the power of the Ancestral Holy Fire up close. If it weren't for the two disciples cultivating Verdant Sun Demonic Fire and having that strange green banner for protection, they would have been instantly incinerated by the green light.</p><p>Although the green light wasn't the true form of the Ancestral Holy Fire, it was a manifestation of its purest essence. Once unleashed, it was far more terrifying than the Nine Nether Demonic Fire within the Ten Yama Banners!</p><p>What about using the Void Thunder Talisman?</p><p>Qin Sang considered this but shook his head, dismissing the idea.</p><p>The residual traces of a Void Thunder Talisman detonation couldn't be erased quickly, which would expose him.</p><p>The Void Thunder Talisman was his most reliable tool, not to be used lightly. Wasting it without achieving his objective would only put him in greater danger.</p><p>After pondering for a moment, Qin Sang decided to remain calm. Since he couldn't escape, he would find a place to familiarize himself with the Corpse Elixir. Once he regained his strength, everything would be easier than idly speculating here.</p><p>He had less than two hours.</p><p>Qin Sang had already realized that his mastery of the Corpse Elixir was far faster than Yu Hua's. With full concentration, there was a good chance he could control its power within this timeframe.</p><p>Then, with power comparable to the Flying Night Devil, along with the Ebony Sword and Void Thunder Talisman, he wouldn't necessarily fear that Core Formation cultivator.</p><p>The cultivator was only in the early stage of Core Formation.</p><p>With that in mind, Qin Sang looked around and found a hiding spot not far from the Verdant Sun Demonic Sect's gate. He settled into meditation, focusing entirely on sensing the Corpse Elixir within his body.</p><p>As time passed, Qin Sang's control over the Corpse Elixir grew more effortless. With increased familiarity, a realization dawned upon him.</p><p>His previous spiritual power was not on the same level as the true essence of the Corpse Elixir.</p><p>Although Qin Sang didn't have the same intimate connection with the true essence as he did with his spiritual power, he could control it without hindrance. It was truly his power to wield.</p><p>It was no exaggeration to say that Qin Sang had been completely transformed.</p><p>However, this transformation was only at the level of true essence. His divine sense and physical body remained unchanged. He hadn't undergone the complete metamorphosis of a true Core Formation cultivator, capable of drawing upon the world's energy and commanding the elements.</p><p>This was his fatal flaw, unless he embraced the irreversible corpse transformation, relinquished control of the true essence, and allowed his spirit and body to endure its impact.</p><p>The Flying Night Devil's strength lay in its physical body.</p><p>Its ghostly speed and ability to withstand attacks from cultivators of the same level were a result of the continuous tempering of its body during the corpse transformation.</p><p>Qin Sang refused to undergo corpse transformation, leaving his physical body largely unchanged. This meant abandoning the Flying Night Devil's greatest strength.</p><p>Logically, Qin Sang's power was even inferior to the Flying Night Devil's.</p><p>However, as time went on, Qin Sang was surprised to discover that even before fully mastering the Corpse Elixir, the true essence it unleashed already surpassed that of Yu Hua, who possessed a formidable physical body!</p><p>Qin Sang estimated that once the Corpse Elixir was fully under his control, his strength might not be far off from a true early-stage Core Formation cultivator!</p><p>What he lost on the swings, he gained on the roundabouts.</p><p>This was completely unexpected.</p><p>Was it because he used an active Golden Elixir, or was it the fusion of Earthly Yin Energy and Heavenly Yang Energy that caused this transformation?</p><p>Perhaps it was a combination of both.</p><p>This discovery filled Qin Sang with elation and boosted his confidence.</p><p>But then he noticed that his Corpse Elixir was completely different from Yu Hua's. The composition of the true essence was peculiar, a fusion of the Golden Elixir's power, Earthly Yin Energy, Heavenly Yang Energy, and corpse energy.</p><p>Spiritual power was only a negligible part; the key components were the Heavenly Yang and Earthly Yin energies.</p><p>After depleting the Corpse Elixir's power, although it could be replenished by absorbing spiritual energy from the world, the recovery rate was extremely slow and negligible in combat. Even absorbing spirit stones wouldn't make much difference.</p><p>To recover quickly during battle, he needed to absorb both Heavenly Yang and Earthly Yin energies simultaneously.</p><p>Earthly Yin Energy was readily available, but Qin Sang had no way to carry Heavenly Yang Energy with him.</p><p>This meant that no matter how strong he was, he could only maintain peak power for a limited time. He had to find a way to kill or escape his opponent before his true essence was depleted.</p><p>This felt eerily similar to the legendary External Elixir.</p><p>Qin Sang frowned.</p><p>Legends of the External Elixir were prevalent in the cultivation world, a dream for every cultivator.</p><p>But the true secret art of the External Elixir had never been revealed.</p><p>However, it wasn't difficult to imagine.</p><p>The External Elixir was still an elixir, and the secret art was likely no easier than true elixir formation, perhaps even more difficult.</p><p>It was said that only Nascent Soul cultivators could condense an External Elixir.</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't sure if Mount Shao Hua possessed the secret art of the External Elixir. He hadn't reached a level where he could access such high-level secrets. However, he had seen a fragmented ancient text in the Pagoda Peak that mentioned the External Elixir in passing.</p><p>It shared many similarities with the Corpse Elixir within him.</p><p>Thinking back, wasn't the method of refining a Flying Night Devil in the "Heavenly Yin Corpse Manual" akin to giving a refined corpse an External Elixir?</p><p>Deep within a damp ditch.</p><p>Qin Sang had awakened from his meditation at some point, his eyes open in contemplation.</p><p>He then slowly shook his head, putting these thoughts aside for now.</p><p>After all, it hadn't been long since he obtained the Corpse Elixir.  He hadn't had time to fully comprehend it, and there were bound to be overlooked aspects. He needed to be safe before carefully reflecting and drawing conclusions.</p><p>With this in mind, Qin Sang stood up. He had almost mastered the Corpse Elixir, faster than he anticipated, in just an hour and a half.</p><p>The Verdant Sun Demonic Sect's Core Formation cultivator still hadn't returned.</p><p>Qin Sang decided not to wait any longer. He would return to Divineç½¡ Peak and cause some trouble for the Verdant Sun Demonic Sect.</p><p>He couldn't take the Verdant Sun Divine Strength away, but he could disrupt it. If the Ancestral Holy Fire became unstable, they would likely be too preoccupied to bother with him.</p>
