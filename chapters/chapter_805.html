<h1>Chapter 797: The Might of the Fire Pearl</h1><p>Fortunately, the Star Conch encountered resistance while breaking the Golden Locking Chain, diminishing its power somewhat.</p><p>Qin Sang rallied his Demonic Fire, and the Twin-Headed Hound gathered wind blades, finally blocking the Star Conch.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>Demonic Fire and wind blades flew everywhere.</p><p>Qin Sang and the Twin-Headed Hound staggered back, their faces pale.  They managed to regain their footing, but both man and beast were shaken.</p><p>The Star Conch's light faded, revealing its jade-white luster, and was retrieved by the Hook-Nosed Man. He frowned slightly, seemingly dissatisfied.</p><p>Qin Sang stared at the treasure in astonishment. The Star Conch clearly surpassed mid-grade magical treasures, but he couldn't discern its exact rank.</p><p>The Star Conch showed no obvious signs of refinement; its entire shell was seamless, as if naturally formed. Qin Sang had never seen such a treasure before.</p><p>Its power was undeniable.</p><p>However, what puzzled Qin Sang was that the Hook-Nosed Man didn't press his attack with the Star Conch. Instead, he put it away and charged forward again.</p><p>"Daring to enslave a spirit beast! You must die!"</p><p>Seeing the Twin-Headed Hound, the Hook-Nosed Man’s killing intent intensified.</p><p>Qin Sang and the Twin-Headed Hound fought together, but the Hook-Nosed Man’s attacks were like thunder. Even with their combined strength, they felt overwhelmed, constantly retreating.</p><p>Their vision was filled with a flurry of fists and lightning-fast azure arcs.</p><p>Qin Sang manipulated the Ten Yama Banners with all his might, trying to create space. The Twin-Headed Hound fought alongside him, sometimes releasing phantom images, sometimes condensing wind blades.</p><p>They fought and retreated, navigating the storm, occasionally using the hurricane's force to gain a moment's respite.</p><p>Qin Sang kept a close eye on the Hook-Nosed Man, wary of another sneak attack with the Star Conch. He didn't have a second Golden Locking Chain, and the unexplained loss of that treasure pained him.</p><p>For a while, the Hook-Nosed Man didn't use the Star Conch again.</p><p>Qin Sang wondered if using the treasure came at a cost or required a charging period, preventing frequent use.</p><p>However, the Hook-Nosed Man was cunning, and Qin Sang dared not relax.</p><p>To Qin Sang's anxiety, despite the continuous clashes, he hadn't found a suitable opportunity.  He could only patiently endure the relentless assault.</p><p>Even with all his efforts, Qin Sang couldn’t stop his opponent from closing in.</p><p>He could clearly see the man's face.</p><p>"I must say, for your level of cultivation, it's remarkable that you've evaded me for so long. Given time, the human race might have gained another top expert.  Unfortunately for you, you met me…"</p><p>The Hook-Nosed Man sneered.</p><p>Although it seemed like a long time, the actual fight was brief, with Qin Sang mostly fleeing.</p><p>But in this perilous place, every extra moment increased the risk of unforeseen events, and the Hook-Nosed Man was losing patience.</p><p>Luminous wings, sharp as blades, cut through the Demonic Fire.</p><p>The Twin-Headed Hound’s eyes widened.  It was about to intercept, but sensing the power of the wings, it whimpered and turned to flee.</p><p>At the same time, the Ebony Sword was struck by the Hook-Nosed Man's fists and deflected.</p><p>The Hook-Nosed Man's sudden surge left Qin Sang vulnerable.  Seeing him rapidly approach, Qin Sang immediately activated a magic talisman, escaping into the gaps within the hurricane.</p><p>Suddenly, the Hook-Nosed Man raised his hand, and the Star Conch reappeared.</p><p>Qin Sang’s heart skipped a beat, and he shifted sideways.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the Hook-Nosed Man smirked, not launching the Star Conch. Instead, his wings flared with intense light, his speed surged, and as he closed in on Qin Sang, a cloud of dense green smoke shot from his forehead towards Qin Sang’s face.</p><p>Qin Sang cursed inwardly, dodging quickly.  He then smelled a strange odor and felt dizzy and drowsy.</p><p>"Poison!"</p><p>Qin Sang cried out in his mind, and a flash of inspiration struck him.</p><p>Just as the green smoke enveloped him, seemingly affecting his movements, Qin Sang stumbled, allowing the smoke to completely engulf him, seemingly trapping him.</p><p>The Hook-Nosed Man roared with laughter and flashed to the edge of the smoke, about to capture Qin Sang. Suddenly, his expression changed drastically, and he retreated with a horrified look.</p><p>The poisoning and fainting were a ruse.</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't expected the Hook-Nosed Man to cultivate poison techniques, but upon seeing the green smoke, he knew his chance had come!</p><p>The Fat Silkworm secretly protected him with its poison-repelling shell.  Qin Sang bided his time, and at the perfect moment, he unleashed the Fire Pearl. Although the Hook-Nosed Man reacted swiftly, it was too late.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>As the Hook-Nosed Man watched in terror, the Fire Pearl shot towards him, easily piercing his protective aura.  Even his prided physique was fragile against the Fire Pearl.</p><p>A tiny flame flickered on the pearl's surface as it burned through his skin and into his chest with devastating force.</p><p>‘Gasp…’</p><p>The Hook-Nosed Man gurgled, his eyes vacant.</p><p>Apart from a small hole in his chest, he had no other injuries, but he was dead.</p><p>A cold light flickered from the hole, and a layer of ice spread rapidly from within, quickly encasing the Hook-Nosed Man’s entire body. His internal organs were already frozen solid.</p><p>Unharmed, Qin Sang emerged from the green smoke, shielded by Demonic Fire. Ignoring the danger, he flew forward and snatched an armguard from the Hook-Nosed Man.</p><p>He sensed that the other half of the bone flute was hidden within.</p><p>Next was the Star Conch; this treasure had left a deep impression on him and could compensate for the loss of the Golden Locking Chain.</p><p>Moving swiftly, Qin Sang grabbed the man's storage pouch and fled without looking back.</p><p>‘Crack…’</p><p>The formidable expert, completely frozen, shattered into ice shards when struck by a wave, vanishing without a trace, replaced by a blue flame.</p><p>Freed from its constraints, the Cold Flame’s power erupted, freezing a large area of seawater.</p><p>But immediately after, the ice was shattered by the hurricane.</p><p>The Cold Flame’s power caused a violent disturbance, becoming entangled with the hurricane.  A terrifying energy began to brew.</p><p>Knowing he couldn't stay, Qin Sang didn't stop to examine his spoils, urgently fleeing.</p><p>The green smoke hadn't yet dispersed.  To Qin Sang's surprise, the Fat Silkworm jumped out of its basket and devoured the smoke in one gulp. It burped, returned to the basket, and fell fast asleep.</p><p>This was the first time the Fat Silkworm had willingly consumed poisonous smoke.</p><p>Confused, Qin Sang saw the intensifying hurricane behind him.  He knew he couldn’t linger and quickly rejoined the Twin-Headed Hound.</p><p>…</p><p>Demon Sea.</p><p>Unnamed Island, Unnamed Mountain.</p><p>Within the mountain’s belly, a vast cave, intricately furnished yet exuding a raw, untamed aura.  On a stone table sat a human-head-sized crystal, sealing a cyan feather within.</p><p>Suddenly, the feather vibrated violently, and the crystal creaked, exploding with a boom.</p>
