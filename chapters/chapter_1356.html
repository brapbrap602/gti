<h1>Chapter 1348: Ye Qiudao (6k, Three-in-One)</h1><p>The Demon-Binding Chains took the form of black iron links.</p><p>The Jade Bone was completely entangled by the Demon-Binding Chains, bound tightly from head to toe.</p><p>The chains grew tighter and tighter.</p><p>The lightning, though seemingly thin, could penetrate the purple light surrounding the Jade Bone, effectively suppressing it.</p><p>Qin Sang watched the Jade Bone calmly, not sparing any of his true essence.</p><p>However, what happened next completely defied his expectations.</p><p>Whether it was because the array diagram they had deduced themselves couldn't fully activate the Demon-Binding Chains' power, or because the ancient records had exaggerated their efficacy, the Jade Bone didn't lose its ability to resist as they had anticipated once bound by the chains.</p><p>"Hmph!"</p><p>After a brief moment of disarray, the Jade Bone clenched its fists, and a surge of purple light erupted from its body. A layer of armor-like purple light formed between the chains and the Jade Bone.</p><p>The Demon-Binding Chains, struck by the purple light, could no longer tighten beyond a certain point.</p><p>'Clang!'</p><p>The chains emitted a grating sound, each link straining and shaking violently, making one fear they might snap at any moment.</p><p>The Jade Bone suddenly raised its head, its expression twisted and ferocious, glaring coldly at Qin Sang. A bloodthirsty grin spread across its face as it opened its mouth wide and let out a piercing roar.</p><p>The sound was shrill, like the cry of a demon from the depths of hell.</p><p>Those who heard it felt their heads spin and their minds grow heavy.</p><p>Qin Sang felt a tightness in his chest, and his true essence began to stagnate. He was inwardly alarmed.</p><p>Amid the demonic roar, a dense, almost tangible purple light burst from the Jade Bone's body, instantly flowing through every corner of its form, radiating an eerie brilliance.</p><p>The Jade Bone's skin shimmered like brocade.</p><p>It was like a work of art!</p><p>This purple light was different from before.</p><p>Both Qin Sang and Qing Jun could clearly sense that the Jade Bone's resistance had grown significantly, as if it had unleashed some formidable secret technique, making it even more terrifying than before.</p><p>At the same time, the restrictions imposed by the Star Origin Stone array on the Jade Bone weakened.</p><p>'Snap!'</p><p>In the next moment, the Jade Bone's hands shot out like lightning, grabbing the main body of the Demon-Binding Chains. Its speed was so fast that neither Qin Sang nor Qing Jun could react in time.</p><p>...</p><p>Above.</p><p>Bai stood between Ye Laomo and the Jade Bone.</p><p>Although Ye Laomo showed no immediate intention to act, caution was still necessary.</p><p>Despite Qin Sang and Qing Jun joining forces, using both the array and the Demon-Binding Chains, they still couldn't suppress the Jade Bone. A flicker of surprise flashed in Bai's eyes, but his expression remained calm.</p><p>Ye Laomo's gaze was deep, his face unreadable.</p><p>He stood like an outsider, observing coldly.</p><p>After Qin Sang appeared, Ye Laomo's attention was drawn to the Demon-Binding Chains. When he saw that the chains were on the verge of being broken by the Jade Bone, his eyes flickered slightly, and he gave Bai a meaningful look.</p><p>Bai's heart tightened, and he gathered corpse energy in his palm, ready to act at any moment.</p><p>...</p><p>'Crack...'</p><p>The Jade Bone gripped the Demon-Binding Chains tightly, pulling with all its might to break them.</p><p>The chains were engulfed in purple light, turning into a purple chain.</p><p>As the controller, Qin Sang could clearly sense how terrifying the Jade Bone's power was. The Demon-Binding Chains might truly be destroyed by it!</p><p>His expression changed drastically, and he exerted all his strength to prevent the Jade Bone from destroying the chains.</p><p>Suddenly, a cold snort echoed in Qin Sang's ears, and a powerful shockwave surged through the chains. Qin Sang grunted, staggering back, his face flushing red.</p><p>At that moment.</p><p>Qing Jun suddenly broke away from the Star Origin Stone array, soaring high into the air.</p><p>She shed her disguise, revealing her stunning figure and face.</p><p>In that instant.</p><p>Around the blood-red altar.</p><p>Figures began to appear.</p><p>With the Jade Bone in danger and Ye Laomo holding back, the evil array, now unmanned, had greatly weakened. The cultivators trapped in the ghost mist finally broke through the blockade and arrived.</p><p>True One Daoist and Cang Hong Zhenren were a step behind Qin Sang.</p><p>The cultivators led by Guan were further back, some faster, some slower.</p><p>Figures also appeared from other directions.</p><p>The largest groups came from two sides.</p><p>Dongyang Bo and Tongyou Mojun led a group of Nascent Soul cultivators.</p><p>On the other side, Jingyu and the Snake King were accompanied by a group of demonic cultivators, along with human cultivators like Binghan and the City Lord of Yinshan Pass.</p><p>By now, nearly all the Nascent Soul cultivators who had entered the ghost mist had arrived.</p><p>They looked up, staring in awe at Qing Jun.</p><p>A red dress, eternal and unchanging.</p><p>Her sleeves fluttered like flames.</p><p>Her figure resembled a phoenix, soaring high!</p><p>The breathtaking scene was etched deeply into everyone's minds, unforgettable.</p><p>Qing Jun looked at the Jade Bone, her expression as calm as ever, just like when she had once told Qin Sang—everyone in her life was merely a passerby.</p><p>When the Jade Bone met Qing Jun's bright eyes, it was momentarily stunned. For some reason, an unprecedented sense of danger arose in its heart.</p><p>Qing Jun flew directly in front of the Jade Bone, her fair wrist lifting slightly, her jade-like fingers dancing with a unique rhythm and grace.</p><p>Qin Sang, standing nearby, was also stunned.</p><p>He couldn't fathom Qing Jun's intentions.</p><p>To better control the Nascent Soul puppet, Qin Sang had sought Qing Jun's guidance on the art of puppetry. Qing Jun had been generous, even sharing the ancient tome on puppet seals and personally instructing him.</p><p>He could guess that Qing Jun was likely performing a puppet seal technique, but he couldn't identify which one.</p><p>The puppet seals in the ancient tome each had different effects, but none matched Qing Jun's current actions, nor were they suitable for this situation.</p><p>"Could it be a new puppet seal? It feels even more complex than the ones recorded in the ancient tome. Wait! This is..."</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes filled with shock.</p><p>In the moment Qing Jun completed the puppet seal.</p><p>From the Jade Bone's left toe, deep within its marrow, a faint wisp of gray energy emerged.</p><p>The gray energy appeared weak amidst the purple light, but it was tenacious, rooted deep within the Jade Bone's skeleton, spreading rapidly throughout its body.</p><p>Ye Laomo's pupils contracted sharply.</p><p>The Jade Bone looked down, its expression changing drastically. The purple light around it surged madly toward the gray energy.</p><p>However, the gray energy was like a festering wound, deeply embedded in its marrow, already fused with its bones. No matter how powerful the purple light was, it couldn't expel the gray energy.</p><p>Qin Sang, no longer able to contain his shock, poured all his energy into controlling the Demon-Binding Chains to suppress the Jade Bone.</p><p>Qing Jun's eyelids fluttered slightly, and she exchanged a glance with Qin Sang, giving him an almost imperceptible nod.</p><p>Soon, the gray energy had spread throughout the Jade Bone's entire skeleton.</p><p>The gray energy shifted, gradually forming the outline of a puppet seal.</p><p>Qin Sang's mind raced, and he began to piece together the truth, his astonishment growing.</p><p>Without a doubt, the gray energy was the manifestation of a puppet seal, and it had been planted deep within the Jade Bone long ago, turning it into a puppet!</p><p>Given Qing Jun's current cultivation, no matter how profound her secret techniques, it would have been impossible for her to plant a puppet seal within the Jade Bone without its notice.</p><p>Even against an ordinary Nascent Soul cultivator, such a feat would be impossible.</p><p>Unless... Qing Jun had acted long ago!</p><p>After much thought, the only opportunity Qing Jun could have had to plant the seal was during the battle at the Blood Pool, during her final struggle with Ye Laomo.</p><p>The Green Luan had already seized the Jade Bone, and though it appeared to have been struck away by Ye Laomo, in reality, Qing Jun had secretly transferred the puppet seal into the Jade Bone's body!</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly understood.</p><p>No wonder, after leaving the Blood Lake, he had felt that something was missing from Qing Jun, though he couldn't pinpoint what.</p><p>She didn't seem severely injured, yet it took her a long time to recover. During that period, she couldn't even use the Green Luan puppet in battle.</p><p>It turned out that Qing Jun had transferred the puppet seal from the Green Luan into the Jade Bone, turning it into a puppet without anyone noticing!</p><p>That was exactly what had happened.</p><p>At that time, Qing Jun hadn't been powerless to fight Ye Laomo.</p><p>But first, it would have required a life-and-death struggle, and second, she might not have been able to snatch the Jade Bone from Ye Laomo's grasp.</p><p>The Jade Bone's consciousness had already perished, so obtaining its skeleton alone wouldn't have been of much use.</p><p>Qing Jun, assessing the situation, decided to go along with the plan, using the puppet seal to control the Jade Bone. She feigned defeat, allowing Ye Laomo to take it.</p><p>This way, if Ye Laomo did anything to the Jade Bone, she could use it to uncover the true secrets of the Sin Abyss, possibly even catching the Sin Abyss off guard.</p><p>However, the situation hadn't unfolded entirely as she had anticipated.</p><p>Ye Laomo, scheming against all, betrayed the Sin Abyss and fled into the Sin God Palace.</p><p>After receiving the news, Qing Jun left Yucheng overnight, circling the entrance to the Sin God Palace several times. Unable to sense the puppet seal's fluctuations, she had no choice but to return in frustration.</p><p>Earlier, when she had taken the rear in the Sin God Palace, she had actually been using a secret technique to sense the puppet seal.</p><p>She had been the first to detect Ye Laomo's traces.</p><p>All the previous questions about her senior sister now fell into place.</p><p>Understanding this, Qin Sang was left with even greater questions. He stared intently at the gray energy within the Jade Bone, utterly perplexed. "What kind of puppet seal is this? To evade Ye Laomo's detection is one thing, but even after the demon took over the Jade Bone's body and revived, it still didn't notice!"</p><p>Little did he know, this was the Heart Demon Puppet Seal!</p><p>Qin Sang had cultivated the "Heartless Demon Seal" and had been plagued by inner demons for many years.</p><p>With her extraordinary talent, shortly after advancing to the Nascent Soul stage by killing Leng Yuntian, she had devised a method to sever her inner demons and eliminate the hidden dangers.</p><p>But she felt that the inner demons that had troubled her for so long would be a waste if simply severed. Was there no way to utilize them?</p><p>She had never lacked courage, allowing the inner demons to coexist with her. She turned her attention to the art of puppet seals, pondering for a century, and eventually created a unique technique to refine the inner demons into a special Heart Demon Puppet Seal!</p><p>The Heart Demon Puppet Seal.</p><p>Astonishing and unprecedented!</p><p>If word of this spread, who in the cultivation world wouldn't be shocked?</p><p>This puppet seal inherited the intangible and formless nature of inner demons, hiding within the Jade Bone's body. Not only was Ye Laomo unaware, but even after the demon took over the Jade Bone, it hadn't detected the slightest anomaly.</p><p>Of course.</p><p>This was also related to the demon's recent escape and its unrecovered strength.</p><p>If the demon had been at its peak, or if Ye Laomo hadn't been so wary of it and had released it twenty years earlier, the Heart Demon Puppet Seal might have been discovered long ago.</p><p>Through a series of coincidences.</p><p>Who could have guessed that Qing Jun's sudden inspiration would play such a crucial role at this moment!</p><p>The Heart Demon Puppet Seal emerged.</p><p>The demon within the Jade Bone sensed the danger and frantically activated the purple light to suppress it.</p><p>Unfortunately, before the demon had possessed the Jade Bone, the Heart Demon Puppet Seal had already merged with its brocade-like skin. The demon had walked right into a trap, and the puppet seal couldn't be easily expelled. Moreover, without the Demon-Binding Chains, even if Qing Jun activated the Heart Demon Puppet Seal, it would have been difficult to control the demon.</p><p>With the two forces combined, panic finally appeared on the Jade Bone's face!</p><p>Through its brocade-like skin, one could clearly see the gray energy growing denser, transforming into a mysterious puppet seal. Its fluctuations were almost imperceptible, etched into every bone.</p><p>No matter how the purple light surged, it couldn't erase the puppet seal.</p><p>To make matters worse, the Jade Bone couldn't spare any attention to resist the Demon-Binding Chains.</p><p>The Demon-Binding Chains had fully merged with the array diagram, each link gleaming darkly, tightly binding the Jade Bone. Black lightning pierced deep into its body, suppressing the purple light and working in tandem with the Heart Demon Puppet Seal.</p><p>Even so, the Jade Bone hadn't lost its ability to resist, struggling wildly.</p><p>The Heart Demon Puppet Seal, the purple light, and the Demon-Binding Chains.</p><p>The three forces collided within its body, emitting a terrifying aura.</p><p>"Why aren't you acting? Kill her!"</p><p>The Jade Bone roared at Ye Laomo, pleading for help for the first time.</p><p>Ye Laomo, engrossed in the spectacle, was most captivated not by his ally, the Jade Bone, but by Qing Jun.</p><p>Though he didn't know the origins of the Heart Demon Puppet Seal, he could guess that Qing Jun had tampered with the Jade Bone during the Blood Pool battle. A chill ran down his spine as he realized how close he had come to disaster.</p><p>He prided himself on his cunning and intelligence, yet he had fallen into this girl's scheme without realizing it. During that time, he had carried the Jade Bone's brocade-like skin with him, essentially planting a ticking time bomb by his side.</p><p>Fortunately, his plans hadn't conflicted with Qing Jun's, and he had hidden in the Sin God Palace for twenty years. Otherwise, he might have truly met his end in an unexpected twist.</p><p>Hearing the Jade Bone's accusation.</p><p>Ye Laomo glanced at Bai, who was on high alert, and chuckled lightly. "Think carefully about the oath we swore. If our positions were reversed, would you stand by and watch, or would you save me? You know what lies beyond the Conveyance Platform. You deliberately left loopholes in the oath, never intending to spare my life, did you? Did you ever consider that one day you might be trapped by your own schemes?"</p><p>Ye Laomo looked at the Jade Bone, a mocking smile on his face.</p><p>"You!"</p><p>The Jade Bone was stunned, its expression fierce. "You're mad! Without my protection, you'll never survive the spatial turbulence!"</p><p>Ye Laomo remained unmoved by the threat, speaking calmly. "I remember you once said that when leaving this realm, the most terrifying spatial storms would be mostly blocked by the Purple Subtlety Palace. With the Purple Subtlety Palace's help, even a late-stage Nascent Soul cultivator would have a slim chance of surviving the spatial turbulence. Compared to constantly guarding against an ancient demon of unknown origin, I believe my chances of survival are better if I venture into the spatial turbulence alone. Your only use is to activate the Conveyance Platform's restrictions. If someone is willing to help me eliminate a major threat, I naturally welcome it..."</p><p>As he spoke.</p><p>Ye Laomo raised his head, his gaze seemingly piercing through the heavens, looking toward the unknown.</p><p>His eyes burned with fervor.</p><p>For countless years, countless genius cultivators had dreamed of this moment. Now, it was within his grasp.</p><p>He would step out of the North Star Realm, break free from this cage, and venture into a vaster world!</p><p>His words caused an uproar among the Nascent Soul cultivators.</p><p>His statement revealed too much, each piece of information earth-shattering.</p><p>"Is the Purple Subtlety Palace not just appearing but about to break through the void and leave?"</p><p>"What does 'leaving this realm' mean?"</p><p>"What is the Conveyance Platform?"</p><p>"Is this about ascension? But no! Legends say only Great Ascension cultivators can ascend through tribulation. The gap between Nascent Soul and Great Ascension is like heaven and earth. Where could they ascend to?"</p><p>...</p><p>Everyone was thrown into confusion.</p><p>They doubted their ears or wondered if Ye Laomo had gone mad.</p><p>How many secrets of this world remained unknown to them?</p><p>However, these doubts didn't affect their judgment. They had come here for a reason and wouldn't stand idly by. They quickly joined the battle.</p><p>Some rushed to aid Qin Sang and Qing Jun.</p><p>Others charged at Ye Laomo.</p><p>Old and new grudges were settled together!</p><p>The revelations from Ye Laomo had shaken them to their core. They couldn't let him leave without getting to the bottom of this.</p><p>Yet Ye Laomo seemed unperturbed, ignoring everything.</p><p>He stood with his hands behind his back, gazing at the sky.</p><p>The heavens had completely collapsed, as if a massive hole had been torn open. Terrifying spatial storms poured out from the hole, and deep within the void, a shadowy mass could be seen—the reflection of the Purple Subtlety Palace's inner hall.</p><p>Below the blood-red altar, a figure silently appeared. It was the tall, thin cultivator who had recently chanted the Rebirth Mantra for the Blood Infant.</p><p>He had also taken the Withering Origin Pill and was now suffering from its side effects, knowing his future was bleak.</p><p>Having witnessed the tragic fate of Yu Zhen being refined into a Blood Infant, his hatred for Ye Laomo burned even fiercer.</p><p>The tall, thin cultivator's eyes flashed with determination as he spat out a spiritual blade.</p><p>The blade was no longer than a finger, transparent as if forged from black ice.</p><p>His robes billowed silently as he channeled his energy into the blade. Wrinkles began to creep across his face, growing deeper as the blade absorbed his vitality.</p><p>Finally, he closed his eyes, merging with the blade!</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>The blade's radiance was dazzling!</p><p>Like a rainbow, it shot toward Ye Laomo faster than anyone else's magical treasures, aiming straight for his back.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the blade entered the storm, mere inches from Ye Laomo, poised to strike his heart.</p><p>Ye Laomo floated in place, seemingly entranced by the spectacle above, oblivious to the impending danger.</p><p>Just as the blade was about to strike.</p><p>A flicker of hesitation passed through Bai's eyes as he debated whether to intervene.</p><p>At that moment, a faint blood mist enveloped Ye Laomo, and a blood shadow stepped out from his body—a Blood Demon Avatar.</p><p>To everyone's shock, this Blood Demon Avatar's aura was on par with Ye Laomo's true body, even slightly surpassing it!</p><p>"Another peak mid-stage Nascent Soul Blood Demon Avatar!"</p><p>Someone exclaimed in disbelief.</p><p>Ye Laomo had lost a Blood Demon Avatar in the Blood Lake, yet within twenty years, he had created another.</p><p>However, Qin Sang and Cang Hong Zhenren sensed that things weren't so simple.</p><p>Especially Qin Sang, who immediately realized something</p>
