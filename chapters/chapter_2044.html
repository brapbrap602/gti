<h1>Chapter 2035: The Sword Hilt</h1><p>Irregular stones, varying in size, floated in the void, countless and boundless.</p><p>This expanse of stones stretched as far as the eye could see, likely spanning tens of thousands of miles. According to Young Master Xin, this place contained only stones, devoid of mystical illusions or Small World fragments. A formless power seemed to gather these stones together.</p><p>Though seemingly ordinary, these stones had withstood countless assaults from the wicked winds and treacherous lightning, enduring to this day.</p><p>However, within the Bountiful Jade Gate, such defiance of logic was commonplace, and everyone had long since grown accustomed to it.</p><p>Entering the heart of the stone field, they were met with a monotonous landscape of gray stones, like stepping into a colossal labyrinth.</p><p>‘Whoosh… Whoosh… Whoosh…’</p><p>A chilling wind howled incessantly through the stone field. While not as perilous as the wicked winds, it still presented a considerable nuisance. Qin Sang and Young Master Xin navigated through the stones.  Searching for a hidden secret realm in such a place was a daunting task, its difficulty readily apparent.</p><p>While previously searching for secret realms, Young Master Xin had gathered much information related to this location. People had noticed this place long ago, and it had been searched countless times. However, it was said to be barren, lacking any treasures, and gradually, interest waned.</p><p>Following the dying words of the Xin family's former patriarch, Young Master Xin had investigated in secret and found the secret realm. But to lay a trap for Steward Pei and Recluse Zhong Liang, he kept its existence hidden.</p><p>While the surfaces of the stones varied, their composition was similar, clearly originating from the same source. Young Master Xin speculated that they might have formed from the shattering of a single, gigantic stone.</p><p>If this were true, how massive must the original stone have been? Along their journey, they had encountered countless stones larger than mountains.</p><p>After a series of twists and turns, the wind carried a damp breath. A flat stone, vast as a continent, appeared before them. A jade ribbon, a great river, flowed through its center.</p><p>The river surged, its banks lined with desolate stone mountains.</p><p>The group traveled upstream, the secret realm located at the river's source.</p><p>With Young Master Xin leading the way, they quickly arrived above a large marsh.</p><p>This place was rich with water vapor, shrouded in mist.  Although there was no trace of living creatures, the Xin family cultivators still dispersed, maintaining a cautious vigilance.</p><p>“Elder Qin, the entrance to the secret realm lies beneath the water,” Young Master Xin said, pointing downwards.</p><p>Qin Sang extended his divine sense, discovering that the surrounding water was only a few fathoms deep, the bottom covered in sand and stones. Beneath them lay a narrow, elongated ravine, where gurgling water flowed from underground, showing no unusual signs.</p><p>This was to be expected. If the entrance to a secret realm were so easily discovered, it would have been claimed long ago.</p><p>Young Master Xin retrieved a silk handkerchief and gently tossed it into the water.  Upon entering the water, the handkerchief caused the surface to churn as if boiling, releasing a dense water vapor that quickly enveloped the surroundings in a white mist.</p><p>As it sank, the color on the handkerchief gradually faded until it became transparent, merging completely with the water.</p><p>In the next moment, a faint silver glow shimmered from within the ravine.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression shifted slightly as he glanced around.  They had remained stationary, and the surrounding mist remained undisturbed. Yet, within Qin Sang's perception, some unknown change was occurring nearby.</p><p>‘Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!’</p><p>Suddenly, a fierce wind swept through, causing the white mist to churn and twist into indescribable shapes.</p><p>The others also sensed the anomaly, their vigilance intensifying.</p><p>After some time, the wind not only persisted but intensified, its roar deafening, more piercing than thunder, as if the earth were tearing apart and the heavens were overturning.</p><p>Young Master Xin, his expression calm, stood beside Qin Sang, awaiting orders.</p><p>Qin Sang observed for a moment before instructing the Xin family members to proceed. He then lightly took a step forward. With just one step, he seemed to enter a new world. The wind grew more violent, and the white mist enveloped the entire space, swirling and shifting like a dream. Sadly, the terrifying wind shattered the dreamlike tranquility.</p><p>The wind carried an aura of chaos, causing unease to stir among the group.</p><p>“Is this the place?” Qin Sang asked.</p><p>Young Master Xin nodded, his gaze sweeping around as if searching for something.</p><p>“It seems this secret realm is on the verge of collapse,” Qin Sang said.</p><p>This fluctuation was familiar; they had just experienced it within the tomb. It was a sign that the secret realm was heading towards destruction.</p><p>This place was in even worse condition than the tomb. The secret realm was likely already unstable, and their entry had accelerated its collapse.</p><p>“Elder Qin, look,” Young Master Xin pointed towards the depths of the swirling mist, where a slender white shadow was faintly visible.</p><p>The white shadow, cylindrical in shape, floated in the wind, bobbing up and down.</p><p>Qin Sang stretched out his hand, summoning the white shadow before him. It was a jade pillar nearly two zhang long, requiring three people to embrace it fully. Several cracks ran along the pillar, and it was not whole, one end showing a clear break.</p><p>The jade pillar's texture was crystalline, its interior flowing like water.</p><p>Upon seeing the jade pillar, Young Master Xin breathed a sigh of relief. “This jade pillar must be used to support this secret realm. With the pillar damaged, the realm has lost its support. There must be more than one jade pillar here!”</p><p>Qin Sang formed a hand seal, carefully sensing, and indeed discovered a unique fluctuation, indicative of something artificially refined.</p><p>This was a unique refining method, piquing Qin Sang's interest. However, a single broken jade pillar wasn't enough to grasp the whole picture.</p><p>A moment later, at Qin Sang's command, the group continued deeper into the swirling mist, soon finding another damaged jade pillar, this one even more broken.</p><p>Having been inside for so long without encountering any signs of danger, Qin Sang ordered, “Split up and search. Bring all the jade pillars here.”</p><p>He then sat cross-legged in the air, placing one hand on the jade pillar and closing his eyes to sense, Young Master Xin standing respectfully beside him.</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>The group dispersed to carry out the order.</p><p>Subsequently, people returned with fragments of jade pillars, yet none were whole.</p><p>Then, someone hastily reported, “Young Master! Elder Qin! There's a complete jade pillar ahead, but it can't be moved!”</p><p>“Oh?”</p><p>Qin Sang immediately rose and followed the person to the jade pillar.</p><p>The jade pillar stood erect in the void, seemingly attached to neither heaven nor earth, yet remarkably stable, like a divine needle holding up the sky, almost entirely undamaged.</p><p>Qin Sang approached, gently stroking the jade pillar, his eyes gleaming. This jade pillar, along with the previous fragments, provided enough information for him to deduce much.</p><p>“The wind… seems to be getting stronger…” someone murmured, their face etched with worry. This meant the secret realm's collapse was accelerating, leaving them little time. They needed to find a solution quickly.</p><p>Young Master Xin opened his mouth to speak, but a shout suddenly echoed from the distance. A gray-robed youth, seemingly having discovered something, flew towards them in haste.</p><p>“Young Master!”</p><p>“Old Thirteen, you've already reached Nascent Soul. Why are you still so impetuous? What happened?” Young Master Xin’s brows furrowed slightly.</p><p>Reprimanded by the Young Master, the gray-robed youth’s face flushed. Glancing at Qin Sang, he said, “Reporting to Young Master, we’ve discovered an unusual place, but we're unsure of its nature. Elder Da is guarding there, not daring to act rashly, and ordered me to request your presence.”</p><p>Young Master Xin gave a noncommittal hum, her expression calm, as if she had already known.  Not rushing to depart, she respectfully asked Qin Sang, “Elder Qin, is there any possibility of repairing these jade pillars?”</p><p>“They can be repaired, and it doesn't require a master Artifact Refiner to do so. You've summoned this old man for something rather trivial,” Qin Sang replied.</p><p>“This matter is of great importance, and this junior wouldn’t dare be careless.  If these jade pillars are repaired, can they prevent the secret realm from collapsing?” Young Master Xin asked hopefully.</p><p>“They can, but only temporarily. The number of these jade pillars is clearly incomplete. To completely stabilize the secret realm, new jade pillars must be refined and added.”</p><p>Qin Sang pondered, “You likely don't have the necessary spiritual materials to refine the jade pillars right now, do you?”</p><p>Young Master Xin sighed. “Only upon entering the secret realm does its full picture become clear. This junior made various preparations, but I couldn't account for everything. I wonder if Senior has the time. Once we leave and gather the spiritual materials…”</p><p>Qin Sang waved his hand, interrupting Young Master Xin. “As this old man has said, as long as one understands the method, refining jade pillars is not difficult.  Once these pillars are repaired and erected, the secret realm will certainly hold for a while. This old man will comprehend the complete refining method and pass it on to you. After you leave, you can have others refine them.”</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't yet agreed to Young Master Xin's request for the Xin family to become his vassals.</p><p>Even if he agreed, it would be for the Xin family to work for him, not the other way around, with him attending to every detail personally.</p><p>Young Master Xin responded, “This junior obeys!”</p><p>Qin Sang didn't rush to begin refining. He was also curious about the treasures within the secret realm and instructed the gray-robed youth to lead the way.</p><p>Before long, they arrived at the location. Elder Da, who was guarding the area, immediately greeted them, his tone barely concealing his excitement, as if he had discovered some treasure.</p><p>“Young Master, there's likely Heavenly Frost Rune Silver here!”</p><p>Ahead, the thick mist still lingered, but a patch of silvery-white mist stood out, distinct from the rest. The silver mist remained condensed, and a gurgling sound emanated from within, as if a spring were flowing.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes flashed as he examined the silver mist. This was something he had never encountered before, and he hadn't even heard of the name Heavenly Frost Rune Silver.</p><p>Heavenly Frost Rune Silver sounded like some kind of spiritual material, yet the Five Elements Alliance's records contained no mention of it.</p><p>“Old Thirteen,” Young Master Xin called the gray-robed youth forward, whispering a few instructions.</p><p>The gray-robed youth muttered incantations and formed a hand seal. Light and shadow flickered across his body, and he took a step to the left, leaving behind an illusory shadow shaped like a gray wolf.</p><p>The gray wolf twisted its neck and leaped into the silver mist, letting out a silent howl. Its surface immediately became coated in the silver mist.</p><p>The silver mist continuously seeped into the wolf’s body, quickly absorbing more than half of it, revealing what lay within: a pool of mercury.</p><p>When the gray wolf emerged, it had transformed into a silver wolf, invigorated, its body solidified, its aura profound, clearly having undergone some kind of transformation.</p><p>Witnessing this, the Xin family members were overjoyed.</p><p>“It truly is Heavenly Frost Rune Silver!”</p><p>Young Master Xin's face also lit up with joy.  Noticing Qin Sang's gaze, she quickly explained.</p><p>“Reporting to Elder Qin, Heavenly Frost Rune Silver is not a naturally occurring spiritual silver, but rather something refined by humans.</p><p>“Our Xin family's Shadow Transformation technique, combined with certain special treasures, can undergo further transformation, greatly increasing its power. However, only a few substances, such as Heavenly Frost Rune Silver, meet the requirements.</p><p>“Among them, Heavenly Frost Rune Silver is the most compatible. However, the method for refining it has long been lost.  My father, through a fortunate coincidence, discovered that this place might contain Heavenly Frost Rune Silver, and that it could continuously regenerate…”</p><p>A continuous source of Heavenly Frost Rune Silver was indeed a treasure trove for the Xin family, a place they would strive to protect at all costs.</p><p>So it was artificially refined, no wonder he had never heard of it before.</p><p>Qin Sang summoned a drop of Heavenly Frost Rune Silver, carefully sensing it, and couldn't help but marvel at its ingenuity.</p><p>Unable to immediately discern its uses, driven by a Refiner's instinct, Qin Sang collected a casket of Heavenly Frost Rune Silver for further study. The Xin family naturally dared not object.</p><p>This pool of Heavenly Frost Rune Silver was the most important thing in the entire secret realm.</p><p>What followed was simple. Qin Sang found a suitable location and began repairing the jade pillars.</p><p>Young Master Xin gathered the Xin family cultivators, who lined up to refine the Heavenly Frost Rune Silver and enhance their mystical abilities. These were the elite, core members of the Xin family. After this journey, the overall strength of the Xin family would undoubtedly leap to a new level. Excluding Soul Formation cultivators, they might even be stronger than when the previous patriarch was alive.</p><p>When the first jade pillar was refined and erected, the trend of the secret realm's collapse was indeed alleviated.</p><p>…</p><p>While Qin Sang and the Xin family were busy, four streaks of light flew through the Bountiful Jade Gate, searching for something.</p><p>The attire of those within the light clearly marked them as Buddhist disciples: one bhikkhu and three bhikkhunis.</p><p>The monk had nine戒疤(jieba - burn marks from戒刀 - ordination knife) on his head, wore a gold-threaded kasaya, and held a string of prayer beads. Golden light surrounded him, resembling a Buddhist aura, indicating he was an enlightened monk.</p><p>The three bhikkhunis all wore haiqing robes and monk's hats.  One elderly nun continued to chant scriptures even as they flew.  Judging by her aura, her cultivation was comparable to the monk’s.</p><p>The other two bhikkhunis followed behind the elderly nun. One was a young nun whose natural beauty couldn’t be concealed by her simple robes. Despite being in the Buddhist order, the strands of hair visible beneath her monk’s hat indicated she hadn't been tonsured.</p><p>Soon, they arrived at a fragment of a sword pavilion, the fragment of the Purple Empyrean Palace where Heavenly Mountain had once stood.</p><p>Seeing the nearly destroyed Heavenly Mountain, the young nun's face was filled with anguish.  Her figure flashed, landing before the mountain.</p><p>The broken walls and ruins before her testified to the horrifying events that had transpired.</p><p>If anyone had been on the mountain at the time, they would have been pulverized along with it, leaving no survivors.</p><p>In this moment, all hope turned to dust.</p><p>The young nun trembled, closing her eyes in pain.</p><p>She had searched tirelessly for a thousand years, only to be met with such a cruel outcome.</p><p>The other three exchanged glances and slowly approached.</p><p>Seeing the young nun's expression, they knew without asking that this was the place they sought. They surveyed Heavenly Mountain, trying to find some hopeful sign, but in the end, the monk and the elderly nun exchanged a look, sighing in resignation.</p><p>“Amitabha!”</p><p>The monk chanted a Buddhist invocation.</p><p>The elderly nun sighed deeply, her eyes filled with compassion.  “Junior Sister, please accept my condolences.”</p><p>‘Plop!’</p><p>A teardrop struck the ground.</p><p>The elderly nun opened her mouth, about to offer further comfort, when a violent tremor suddenly reverberated through the void.</p><p>The change was so abrupt that everyone, except the young nun lost in grief, was startled.</p><p>“Are the wicked winds and treacherous lightning about to erupt?” another bhikkhuni asked.</p><p>“Something's not right!”</p><p>The monk’s expression was grave as he stared intently into the depths of the Bountiful Jade Gate.</p><p>In the next moment, a bolt of lightning, as if traversing millions of miles, tore through the Bountiful Jade Gate. A profound aura followed, permeating the entire ancient battlefield!</p>
