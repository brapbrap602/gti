<h1>Chapter 787: The Trial</h1><p>The appearance of this sword light is definitely related to the cultivation technique itself, involving secrets and deeper meaning.</p><p>Nurturing the sword with the Primordial Spirit.</p><p>Fusion of sword and soul.</p><p>Unfortunately, they only obtained incomplete scrolls, lacking the latter parts.</p><p>Qingzhu called this sword light "Sword Soul" because it truly fused with his own soul.</p><p>Strangely, he couldn't feel anything unusual, and the power of this sword light was no different from others. Outsiders couldn't sense any difference at all.</p><p>Qingzhu felt that if he could comprehend the Sword Soul, he might be able to glimpse the greatest secret of this cultivation technique, but he failed.</p><p>After obtaining the *Demonic Fetus Seeding Scripture*, Qingzhu was inspired. He studied this demonic art, and using the Sword Soul, created a similar secret technique, attempting to nurture a demonic seed with the Sword Soul.</p><p>Ultimately, he succeeded.</p><p>And because of the Sword Soul, the demonic seed was very stable. There was no need to harm anyone. He only needed to find a freshly deceased low-level cultivator's body to nurture the Primordial Embryo and refine it into an External Avatar.</p><p>However, the hidden dangers of the External Avatar still existed.</p><p>Qin Sang had long heard of demonic sect secret techniques for External Avatars, all exceptionally evil and dangerous. Unexpectedly, Senior Qingzhu was able to deviate from the norm and create his own path based on demonic arts.</p><p>The Ebony Sword trembled, splitting off a strand of sword light.</p><p>The Sword Soul puzzled him. He beckoned the sword light before him, gazing at it for a long time, but couldn't accurately perceive the difference that Senior Qingzhu mentioned.</p><p>He also couldn't figure out what the Sword Soul could do. Since forming his Gold Core, he had only used it as a surprise attack.</p><p>This was all the content of the jade slip.</p><p>The location of the teleportation formation that Qin Sang desired most, and the Nascent Soul part of the cultivation technique, were all missing.</p><p>"Senior Qingzhu successfully teleported here back then, assuming the alias Island Lord Linggui, and frequented the Seven Kills Hall… With his cultivation level, he must have discovered more than I have…"</p><p>Qin Sang regained his spirits, feeling that after leaving, he needed to investigate where Linggui Island was.</p><p>Perhaps Senior Qingzhu was still alive.</p><p>Qin Sang put away the jade slip, currently not in the mood to study the *Demonic Fetus Seeding Scripture*. He bowed towards where the jade slip was stored, then stood up and looked towards the depths of the passage.</p><p>Hope rekindled in his heart. Senior Qingzhu guiding his descendants here might have other deeper meanings. Could there be something hidden at the end of the passage?</p><p>Qin Sang glanced around, not finding anything unusual. Recalling the various puppets he encountered below, out of caution, he still raised the Ten Yama Devil Banner and summoned the Two-Headed Vulture.</p><p>This was the seventh level. If there were puppets, their strength would be extraordinary. He wasn't very confident.</p><p>Prepared, Qin Sang summoned a Corpse Soldier and stepped into the passage.</p><p>After walking about ten feet, a change occurred.</p><p>A blinding light suddenly shone within the passage. A large ball of cyan light had condensed on the ceiling at some point, and without warning, slammed down towards him.</p><p>The formless cyan light possessed terrifying power, like a mountain pressing down. The Corpse Soldier in front instantly vaporized, and Qin Sang's expression drastically changed.</p><p>Unexpectedly, at this moment, the cyan light seemed to sense something and suddenly dissipated silently, leaving only a few strands that shot towards Qin Sang.</p><p>The ball of light appeared abruptly and vanished just as quickly.</p><p>Qin Sang was bewildered, but seeing those strands of cyan light heading straight for him, he didn't dare let them touch him. He turned to escape, intending to study them slowly.</p><p>Immediately, his heart skipped a beat.</p><p>This shock was significant. Qin Sang was horrified to discover that his retreat was cut off!</p><p>There was nothing behind him, yet an invisible barrier appeared. No matter how hard he tried, he couldn't move an inch.</p><p>The next moment, the cyan light struck.</p><p>The cyan light didn't harm Qin Sang, but went straight for the magical treasures on him, arriving gracefully. Neither the Golden Yao Lock nor the Ten Yama Devil Banner were spared.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang discovered that the connection between him and the Ten Yama Devil Banner was severed.</p><p>Looking down, he saw that after the demonic banner was touched by the cyan light, the Nine Nether Demonic Fire was forced back, and the Golden Yao Lock also fell to the ground with a 'clang', bouncing a few times.</p><p>The Two-Headed Vulture also suddenly vanished, and the Mixed Yuan Concentric Rings fell to the ground.</p><p>Qin Sang was still in shock, staring blankly at all this. Realizing that the cyan light hadn't harmed him, he let out a long sigh of relief and hurriedly picked up his treasures to examine them.</p><p>He checked himself and found that his treasures weren't destroyed, but sealed by some strange restriction. The Two-Headed Vulture was snoring inside the Concentric Rings, and even the Fat Silkworm and the Sky-Eyed Butterfly had inexplicably fallen asleep.</p><p>"Eh? What about the Ebony Sword…"</p><p>Qin Sang's heart stirred and he summoned the Ebony Sword.</p><p>Sword light flashed. The Ebony Sword moved nimbly, without any abnormality.</p><p>"The Ebony Sword is my natal spirit sword, and the Sky-Eyed Butterfly is my natal insect Gu. Logically, their connection with me should be equally close, yet only the Sky-Eyed Butterfly is restricted…"</p><p>Qin Sang pondered, retracting the Ebony Sword and surveying his surroundings.</p><p>The cyan light dissipated, and the passage showed no change, but Qin Sang knew that this place was different now.</p><p>The barrier behind him remained. When he approached it, a gentle repulsive force prevented him from retreating.</p><p>Just then, the cyan bricks beside him suddenly lit up, and two shadowy figures lunged out.</p><p>"Here they come!"</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes flashed. He was surprised to find that it wasn't puppets that emerged, but two sword-wielding 'people'!</p><p>These two looked identical, with blank expressions, holding their swords. They seemed to be sword cultivators with the same devotion to the sword. Both their appearance and posture resembled humans, unlike the bizarre puppets on the lower levels.</p><p>The two shadowy sword cultivators appeared, bowed to Qin Sang with their swords, and then without a word, drew their swords and thrust.</p><p>"Trial! Sword Path!"</p><p>These two words popped into Qin Sang's mind. He roughly guessed the purpose of this setup.</p><p>Cultivators entering the passage had all external forces sealed by restrictions, and could only rely on the sword in their hand, one person, one sword, to defeat all the sword masters emerging from the walls.</p><p>No retreat, only forward!</p><p>This was the true Sword Path, befitting the way of the sword, and clearly prepared for cultivators practicing the *Primordial Spirit Sword Nurturing Chapter*. Recalling the power of the light ball, any other cultivator would likely have been crushed to paste.</p><p>From this, it could be confirmed that the *Primordial Spirit Sword Nurturing Chapter* originated from the Seven Kills Hall!</p><p>Cultivators cultivated external forces. With their treasures sealed, their strength would inevitably be greatly diminished.</p><p>Qin Sang knew his own limitations. Although he cultivated killing sword techniques, he had always treated cultivation techniques as tools to improve his cultivation. Compared to those cultivators who devoted their lives to the way of the sword, he wasn't a true sword cultivator.</p><p>His swordsmanship was also inferior to those true sword dao geniuses. He hadn't yet grasped sword light splitting.</p><p>He could steadily suppress cultivators of the same realm by relying on his magical treasures.</p><p>Now, with only the Ebony Sword, how far could he go here? How strong were the sword masters at the end of the passage?</p><p>Qin Sang didn't have time to think about these things, as the two had already arrived.</p><p>*Swish! Swish!*</p><p>The two vanished, leaving only dazzling sword light in his vision.</p><p>Two sword lights crossed and attacked, incredibly sharp.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes narrowed slightly, stung by the sword light. He reached out and grasped.</p><p>In an instant, the Ebony Sword transformed into a three-foot long blade, landing in Qin Sang's palm.</p>
