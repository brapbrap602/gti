<h1>Chapter 1209: Decision</h1><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The ice sphere and the azure light collided head-on.  </p><p>In an instant, ice shards scattered in all directions, and a massive shockwave swept outward.  </p><p>The ice sphere shattered on impact, and the snow pearl was immediately retrieved by the Frost Lizard.  </p><p>However, the azure light still carried residual power, surging directly toward the cultivator surnamed Lu.  </p><p>Just as it was about to engulf him, a streak of black light slashed through the air—it was the Black Blade, a treasure of the Serpent King.  </p><p>At this moment, the power displayed by the Black Blade was far beyond what it had been under the control of the Puppeteer Demon King. It successfully shattered the remnants of the azure light. Simultaneously, the black light twisted and shot backward, momentarily blocking the torrent of attacks from the two Abyssal Sin cultivators.  </p><p>The Serpent King and his companions seized this precious moment, swiftly shifting their positions.  </p><p>In the next instant, a long shadow brushed past them—dangerously close—it was the tail of the malevolent spirit, flung toward them.  </p><p>One attack followed another, leaving them no time to catch their breath.  </p><p>If it were just a mindless malevolent spirit or only the two Abyssal Sin Nascent Soul cultivators, even with the cultivator surnamed Lu injured, they wouldn’t have been a significant threat. But the current situation was far from ideal.  </p><p>The Serpent King and his companions were beginning to regret their earlier recklessness.  </p><p>They had spent over ten days following the ancient vine, painstakingly unraveling the ancient restrictions. The effort had drained them immensely, leaving them exhausted.  </p><p>When they finally succeeded in opening the demon king’s cave and saw the treasures within, their excitement was overwhelming.  </p><p>In this state, they hadn’t completely lost their vigilance. After confirming there was no immediate danger, they confidently began collecting the treasures.  </p><p>However, they had overlooked one critical detail: this wasn’t a demon king’s cave at all, but a prison holding a terrifying malevolent spirit.  </p><p>Caught off guard, the cultivator surnamed Lu, who was at the forefront, was struck by the malevolent spirit and immediately suffered severe injuries, spitting blood.  </p><p>The Serpent King and the Frost Lizard reacted quickly, protecting themselves and narrowly escaping harm.  </p><p>The three of them had initially planned to work together to retrieve the treasures and leave. However, they hadn’t anticipated the malevolent spirit’s overwhelming strength and terrifying attacks, which drew the attention of the Abyssal Sin cultivators, causing them to miss their chance.  </p><p>Now, they had no intention of continuing to fight for the treasures. They knew that lingering would only attract more Abyssal Sin Nascent Soul cultivators.  </p><p>The so-called “cave” was actually a deep pit below, which had been breached during their battle. They had tried several times to rush into the pit and escape, but each attempt was thwarted.  </p><p>*Rumble…*  </p><p>The battle erupted once more, the battlefield shifting rapidly, a chaotic blur of movement.  </p><p>Qin Sang observed from a distance.  </p><p>After a few exchanges, Qin Sang had a good grasp of the situation on the battlefield.  </p><p>What the Serpent King and his companions might not have realized was that there weren’t just two Abyssal Sin Nascent Soul cultivators—there were three!  </p><p>On the outskirts of the battlefield, another Abyssal Sin Nascent Soul cultivator lay hidden, concealing his aura and waiting for the perfect moment to strike.  </p><p>Unfortunately for them, this didn’t escape the notice of the Heavenly Eye Butterfly.  </p><p>Jiang Chenzi and his companion were so confident in confronting the Serpent King with just the two of them because they knew the third cultivator was lying in wait. They were merely the distraction.  </p><p>Qin Sang’s gaze momentarily left the battlefield as he carefully scanned the surroundings, confirming there were no additional enemies.  </p><p>He now faced two choices.  </p><p>The first was to pretend he hadn’t seen anything and leave immediately.  </p><p>This was the heart of Abyssal Sin territory, and the situation was too volatile. At any moment, more Nascent Soul cultivators could be drawn to the commotion. Out of caution, it would be reasonable to distance himself from the conflict.  </p><p>The second option was to intervene, seize the treasures, and rescue the Serpent King and his companions.  </p><p>If he joined forces with the Serpent King and the others, barring any unforeseen circumstances, escaping shouldn’t be too difficult.  </p><p>Jiang Chenzi and his companion, along with the hidden cultivator, were only at the early Nascent Soul stage. If not for the malevolent spirit, they might even have been able to turn the tables and eliminate one or two of them.  </p><p>The biggest concern was the malevolent spirit.  </p><p>However, according to the descriptions in his cultivation manual, the Seven Souls Slaughter Array should have some restraining effect on such spiritual entities.  </p><p>Qin Sang estimated that if he made his move, he had a good chance of seizing one of the three treasures from within the malevolent spirit. However, he wouldn’t have time to examine the treasures’ functions.  </p><p>While he was also tempted by the Blood Jade and the Broken Axe, he had to prioritize the White Copper. The White Copper had such a strong allure for the Fire Jade Centipede, which at least guaranteed that the risk he was taking wouldn’t be for something worthless.  </p><p>The longer he deliberated, the greater the chance of unforeseen complications.  </p><p>Qin Sang made his decision almost instantly: he would intervene.  </p><p>*Boom!*  </p><p>Another earth-shaking collision.  </p><p>On the battlefield, azure light, serpent shadows, icy frost, black blades, and crimson torrents intertwined, each taking center stage in turn, creating a dazzling spectacle.  </p><p>Qin桑暗中靠近，离战场还有一定距离，在碰撞发生的瞬间，便毫不犹豫以身合剑，化作一道惊虹，贯穿阴云！  </p><p>雷遁与剑遁合一，雷鸣之声不绝于耳。  </p><p>众人尽皆愕然。  </p><p>藏身暗处的那名罪渊修士，正全神贯注观察战局，寻找出手的时机，没想到附近另一个人抢先出手，动作因此迟疑了片刻。  </p><p>战场上，众人神色各异。  </p><p>蛇王最先意识到是秦桑，顿时又惊又喜，“明月妖王！”  </p><p>他神情连变，脑海中瞬间闪过无数念头。  </p><p>在三叠关，他亲自登门，力邀明月妖王一同来寻宝，许下重诺。对方明明拒绝，却突然在渊墟现身，怎能不让蛇王惊疑不定。  </p><p>如果明月妖王在，他们肯定不会这么狼狈。  </p><p>蛇王先是怀疑明月妖王一直暗中跟在自己身后，明面上拒绝，其实心怀不轨。  </p><p>但转念一想，他和卢道友修为都胜过明月妖王，即使明月妖王有什么隐匿秘术，也不可能从天行高原跟踪到罪渊，而他们毫无察觉。  </p><p>然后又怀疑明月妖王会不会是罪渊奸细。  </p><p>这也说不通，明月妖王曾在众目睽睽之下，阵斩裴老魔。  </p><p>罪渊损失一个货真价实的元婴祖师，付出这么大的代价，只为安插一个妖王近天妖丘，简直是无稽之谈。  </p><p>只剩一种可能，明月妖王也有要事，同样暗中潜入渊墟，感知到这里交手的波动，发现是他们，出手相救。  </p><p>这就说得通了，难怪明月妖王会断然拒绝自己。只能怪自己邀请的不合时宜，撞到一块去了。  </p><p>难为蛇王瞬间想到这么多。  </p><p>接着，他耳边便响起秦桑传音提醒，证实了他的推测。  </p><p>而卢姓修士和寒蜥虽然没亲眼见过秦桑，但不止一次听蛇王说起他，听到蛇王惊呼，尽管不明就里，也知道是自家帮手来了。  </p><p>三位都是久负盛名的高手，看到秦桑遁光指向恶灵体内的宝物，猜出他的目的。  </p><p>他们没有责怪秦桑这时候还想着夺宝。  </p><p>没有好处，别人凭什么冒险出手搭救？  </p><p>秦桑直取蛇灵，恰恰帮他们分担了最大的压力。如果这样还无法脱身，他们干脆自裁算了。  </p><p>一家欢喜一家忧。  </p><p>异变陡生，罪渊两元婴本已胜券在握，不料变生肘腋，顿时惊怒万分。  </p><p>另一名元婴也顾不得隐藏了，匆匆祭起法宝，从暗处现身。  </p><p>――  </p><p>――  </p><p>今天能十二点睡，还好，慢慢调整。</p>
