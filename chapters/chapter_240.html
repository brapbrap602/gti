<h1>**Chapter 233: Fire Spirit Beast**</h1><p>The last golden armored divine warrior was shattered and turned into golden brilliance.</p><p>Qin Sang breathed heavily. Fighting six golden armored divine warriors at the same time was not easy for him, but fortunately he managed to defeat them. He put away the evil corpse, swallowed a pill to restore his spiritual power, and after a short adjustment, he walked to the end of the passageway.</p><p>Scorching heat rushed at him, and the air was distorted.</p><p>Qin Sang activated his spiritual power to protect his body, blocking the scorching aura, and cautiously walked to the exit of the passageway.</p><p>As soon as he stepped out of the passageway, Qin Sang suddenly froze and quickly turned around. The passageway had disappeared, becoming a smooth stone wall as if by magic.</p><p>Qin Sang touched the stone wall and discovered that it was extremely hard, and he could not find any機關 or prohibition to open the passageway. It was as though the passageway had never existed.</p><p>He was now standing on a round stone platform with a three-zhang diameter. He was the only one on the platform, making him feel unusually empty.</p><p>In the center of the platform was a stone tablet, identical to the one at the entrance. The stone tablet was pitch-black and over ten zhang tall, exuding an ancient aura. There were no words inscribed on it.</p><p>Qin Sang carefully walked over and extended a wisp of spiritual power to probe it. The stone tablet seemed to be a bottomless pit, swallowing his spiritual power without causing any ripples.</p><p>After some thought, Qin Sang walked to the stone tablet and touched it. The moment his hand made contact, the prohibition on the stone tablet was triggered, revealing a deep whirlpool. Qin Sang suddenly understood that this was the exit of the trial. If he decided to give up, he could return here and exit through the stone tablet.</p><p>In other words, the previous passageway was just an appetizer. The real trial was still ahead!</p><p>Qin Sang looked into the distance, and saw a dense gray mist that made it difficult to see far ahead. There was also a faint mist surrounding him. Fortunately, the mist did not obstruct his divine sense, so Qin Sang extended his divine sense, sweeping it around him. He did not encounter any obstacles.</p><p>However, he did not extend his divine sense too far before retracting it.</p><p>The mist seemed ordinary, drifting and flowing, but Qin Sang did not dare to underestimate it. He had a feeling that there were unknown existences lurking within the mist, waiting for intruders!</p><p>The platform hovered in the air, and there was only a thick iron chain that extended into the depths of the mist. No one knew what was at the end of the chain.</p><p>Other than that, the area to his left and right was covered in mist, and he could not see anything. He could only look down and see a red line at the bottom, where fiery flames and scorching heat emanated from. It was indeed a lava river!</p><p>Due to the mist, he could only see a thin line, but Qin Sang knew that this was definitely not the full extent of the lava river. The real lava river was probably much wider than what he could see.</p><p>After understanding the surrounding environment, Qin Sang stood at the edge of the platform, deep in thought.</p><p>Since he had exited the passageway, dozens of breaths had passed, and there had been no change on the platform. Other than the shifting mist and the surging lava river, the entire space was deathly silent.</p><p>His gaze shifted and he stared at the iron chain under his feet. It was a clear hint that this level of the trial required him to walk along the iron chain.</p><p>He lifted a foot and stepped onto the iron chain. No matter how much force Qin Sang used, the chain did not move at all, leaving him secretly amazed. It was indeed a very stable path.</p><p>A black shadow flashed.</p><p>Qin Sang summoned a zombie and attached his divine sense to it, ordering it to step onto the iron chain and walk forward.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the zombie disappeared into the mist.</p><p>Moments later, Qin Sang's expression suddenly changed. His connection with the zombie had been severed by an unknown force. The change was so sudden that he did not sense anything before the connection was lost!</p><p>Then, the mist suddenly boiled as if it had been brought to a boil. The mist churned violently, as if a group of monsters had been startled by the zombie and were about to charge out of the mist.</p><p>Qin Sang frowned. He did not hesitate to summon his Ebonywood Sword for protection. He still felt insecure, so he also released the Yama Banner. The ghost banner formed an array, surrounding him.</p><p>He did not release the evil corpse. The creatures in the mist were most likely a nemesis for corpses. Losing a zombie would not matter, but losing the evil corpse would be unacceptable.</p><p>Qin Sang had just set up the Ten Directions Yama Array when the things in the mist finally charged out. Before he could see what they were, Qin Sang felt a buzzing in his ears, and his mind was instantly filled with endless noise.</p><p>These noises were strange birdcalls, and they sounded like a devil's chant, even impacting his primordial spirit.</p><p>If it were someone else, they would have been stunned by the sudden strange noise and become fish on a chopping block, at the mercy of others.</p><p>Qin Sang was protected by the jade Buddha, so he was naturally unafraid of this. He ignored the weird noises coming from all directions, opened his eyes wide, and finally saw clearly that a large group of strange red birds had emerged from the fog.</p><p>These birds were neither hawks nor phoenixes, and their bodies were petite, each one being only the size of a palm. Even more peculiar was that their entire bodies were bright red in color, their feathers like blazing flames, just like the legendary divine beast, the fire phoenix.</p><p>Qin Sang had never heard of any妖鸟 (demonic bird) with such an appearance.</p><p>The moment they appeared, a scorching aura rushed towards them, and the birds' cries were the noise they made.</p><p>"Are these... fire spirits?"</p><p>Qin Sang had a flash of inspiration and remembered what they were.</p><p>In places where the power of fire was strong, after a long period of evolution, this strange creature would naturally be born. It was also a type of妖 (demonic beast) known as a fire spirit. There were also similar creatures such as water spirits, earth spirits...</p><p>They were born from the spiritual energy of heaven and earth, so they possessed great power from the moment they were born. However, it was much more difficult for them to develop spiritual intelligence and complete their transformation than other妖兽 (demonic beasts).</p><p>Some fire spirits did not have a true form, while some transformed into the shape of birds and beasts, and there were even humanoid fire spirits. Their forms were varied and diverse, and the abilities of fire spirits were also strange and varied.</p><p>These firebirds were bird-shaped fire spirits.</p><p>There was a large magma river beneath this place that had existed for countless years, and the power of fire was extremely abundant. It was not surprising that fire spirits were born here.</p><p>In other words, the ones hiding in the fog were likely to be a group of firebirds, or perhaps other types of fire spirits.</p><p>Qin Sang looked at the group of firebirds with vigilance. There were densely packed, probably over a thousand of them. They rushed out together, like a cloud of fire, with an astonishing aura.</p><p>The Ten Directions Yama Formation suddenly opened, protecting Qin Sang within the formation, which was then swallowed by the fire cloud in the next moment.</p><p>"Huh?"</p><p>Qin Sang hid within the formation and urged the Ebony Wood Sword to pierce into the fire cloud. He discovered that these firebirds were unexpectedly fragile. They died when pierced by the Ebony Wood Sword and dissipated into a ball of flames.</p><p>Their only means of attack were their bird cries, which were like demonic sounds.</p><p>And, a group of firebirds flapped their wings together to create a hurricane, their feathers flying out in flames and turning into a flaming hurricane, but its power was not strong at all. It could not shake the Ten Directions Yama Formation.</p>
