<h1>Chapter 412: Sword Pavilion</h1><p>Time passed.</p><p>Seven days went by in a flash.</p><p>At Returning Dragon Abbey, everything proceeded as usual.</p><p>Inside the cave, the sword light and blood light, which had initially been evenly matched, finally reached a decisive moment. The Boundless Bloodwood Mulberry had shrunk to a corner, its blood light reduced to a thin layer covering its surface, its luster dimmed, no longer able to withstand the aggressive Ebony Sword.</p><p>The sword light contracted, completely enveloping the Boundless Bloodwood Mulberry in an egg-shaped form, floating in mid-air.</p><p>The Killing Talismans radiated brightly, operating on their own, aiding the Ebony Sword in eroding the blood light.</p><p>The last trace of blood light was gradually ground away, revealing the true form of the Boundless Bloodwood Mulberry. It was a seamless, whole piece of bloodwood without a single blemish.</p><p>As Qin Sang's divine sense approached the bloodwood, he felt a faint sensation of being tainted by it. This divine wood was too strange. He wondered if other divine woods possessed similar abilities.</p><p>Qin Sang eagerly anticipated the transformation of the Ebony Sword after it refined the Boundless Bloodwood Mulberry and the surprises it would bring.</p><p>His movements were extremely cautious as he manipulated the sword Qi to slowly refine the Boundless Bloodwood Mulberry.</p><p>Under Qin Sang's continuous refinement, the Boundless Bloodwood Mulberry melted like ice, transforming into blood-like liquid. The Boundless Bloodwood Mulberry was remarkably pure, the entire piece of spiritual wood being pure essence.</p><p>Qin Sang opened his eyes, gazing intently at the blood-like liquid. After a moment, with a slight thought, the Ebony Sword trembled, its sword light flashing as it plunged into the liquid.</p><p>The sword's body also melted, merging with the blood-like liquid, forming a sword embryo.</p><p>The sword embryo was unstable.</p><p>For a time, it was difficult to discern whether the Ebony Sword was devouring the Boundless Bloodwood Mulberry or vice versa.</p><p>However, within the blood-like liquid, the three Killing Talismans remained stable, like three pillars supporting the sea, firmly suppressing the sword embryo until everything stabilized.</p><p>By now, both the Ebony Sword and the Boundless Bloodwood Mulberry had vanished, leaving only a sword embryo before Qin Sang.</p><p>The sword embryo was divided into two colors.</p><p>Qin Sang could sense the Ebony Sword refining the power of the divine wood. When the blood color completely disappeared and the sword embryo returned to its clear state, it would mark the Ebony Sword's transformation!</p><p>However, this process would be extremely slow.</p><p>Qin Sang recalled the sword embryo to his Nascent Soul, entering deep meditation to carefully comprehend. After a full day, Qin Sang opened his eyes, his expression grave. His premonition had come true.</p><p>Despite the small amount of blood-like liquid, after a whole day, the Ebony Sword had only refined an insignificant trace.</p><p>At this rate, it might take nearly forty years to completely refine the Boundless Bloodwood Mulberry!</p><p>During this process, the Ebony Sword would remain in its embryonic form, its true body extremely fragile, unusable in combat, and requiring constant nurturing within his Nascent Soul.</p><p>Fortunately, with the assistance of the three Killing Talismans, the Ebony Sword could refine the divine wood independently, without requiring Qin Sang's attention.</p><p>Even so, the time required was far too long!</p><p>In its embryonic form, the Ebony Sword couldn't even be used in combat, let alone withstand new Killing Talismans. This meant Qin Sang had to wait until the Ebony Sword finished absorbing the Boundless Bloodwood Mulberry before he could break through to the late stage of Foundation Establishment.</p><p>He possessed spiritual medicines such as the Blood Drop Ghost Mushroom and the Severed Dragon Pill, and had experienced several life-or-death battles in Boundless Valley, deepening his understanding of the four Killing Talismans. Originally, he only needed a dozen or so years to naturally break through to the late stage of Foundation Establishment.</p><p>Because of the Ebony Sword, he would have to wait for nearly forty years.</p><p>Too long.</p><p>However, this problem was not without solutions. Otherwise, Qin Sang wouldn't have been so rash. He would have at least waited until he reached the late stage of Foundation Establishment before refining the Boundless Bloodwood Mulberry.</p><p>Qin Sang took out a jade slip, the one given to him by Shopkeeper Wu. It contained the refining insights of Shopkeeper Wu's ancestors, including even more precious insights on crafting magical treasures.</p><p>Previously, Qin Sang had a vague feeling, but now he was certain. The process of the Ebony Sword devouring the spiritual wood was, in fact, a form of refining.</p><p>The insights within the jade slip would also be helpful to the Ebony Sword.</p><p>As long as Qin Sang could comprehend the contents of the jade slip and achieve a certain level of proficiency in refining, he could significantly reduce the time required for the Ebony Sword to devour the spiritual wood.</p><p>Naturally, comprehending the jade slip was not easy.</p><p>Qin Sang had no foundation in refining and had to start from scratch, gradually accumulating experience.</p><p>The path of refining was equally vast and complex, far from something that could be mastered overnight. Fortunately, he didn't need to study other aspects, only focusing on the refining methods for spiritual swords.</p><p>Moreover, he wasn't aiming to actually create high-quality magical artifacts. He only needed to grasp the contents of the jade slip during the refining process and apply them to the refinement of the Ebony Sword, which would greatly benefit him.</p><p>Learning these things wouldn't be a waste in the future either.</p><p>The "Nascent Soul Sword Nurturing Chapter" was a unique cultivation method. With the natal spiritual sword residing within the Nascent Soul, cultivators could refine a second natal magical treasure, stored in their dantian and nurtured by their Dantian fire.</p><p>This experience could also be applied later when refining natal magical treasures after forming a Gold Core.</p><p>Qin Sang had read the contents of the jade slip numerous times, comprehending the basic parts but hitting a bottleneck. What he lacked was practical experience.</p><p>Therefore, the cave he rented in Sunny Market also came with an inconspicuous shop. The identities of a refiner and shopkeeper were the perfect disguise, killing multiple birds with one stone.</p><p>...</p><p>Sunny Market.</p><p>In a corner of the market, within a deep alley, an inconspicuous small shop opened quietly without any fanfare or grand opening.</p><p>A simple banner was newly hung above the shop, bearing only the two characters "Sword Pavilion" written in bold, elegant calligraphy.</p><p>The characters seemed to contain sword intent, possessing a certain unusual quality, perhaps the only highlight of this humble little shop.</p><p>Despite its name, Sword Pavilion, the shop didn't solely stock spiritual swords. Various types of magical artifacts filled the shelves, sharing a common trait: they were all of very low quality.</p><p>A Foundation Establishment cultivator passing by noticed the newly opened shop. Daring to call itself Sword Pavilion seemed rather ambitious. Intrigued, he entered, took a glance, then left, cursing under his breath.</p><p>These inferior artifacts wouldn't even catch the eye of slightly more experienced Qi Refinement cultivators.</p><p>Similar shops were common in the market, considered small businesses barely making ends meet.</p><p>However, the owner of this new shop seemed unreliable. Without any assistants, he ran the shop alone, working sporadically. In the half month since the shop opened, it had been closed for ten days.</p><p>With hardly any customers, it was likely he struggled to even support himself, let alone pay the rent.</p><p>The owner of 'Sword Pavilion' was Qin Sang.</p><p>Due to its location, although this cave with its attached shop was slightly more expensive than other caves, it perfectly suited Qin Sang's requirements.</p><p>After finishing his research in the pagoda at Pagoda Peak, he brought along a few refining manuals from Lesser Hua Mountain's collection and left the sect, returning to Sunny Market to prepare for the opening of his small shop.</p><p>Having just arrived, he hadn't begun to delve into refining.</p><p>The artifacts displayed in the shop weren't crafted by him. They were part of the possessions he had accumulated over the years of his travels, put on display as a facade. Their prices weren't high, nor did he expect to actually sell them.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't care much for these small amounts of spirit stones.</p><p>It wasn't that he didn't have valuable items in his storage pouch. He planned to wait until his refining skills improved before gradually releasing them, mixed in with the artifacts he would craft himself.</p>
