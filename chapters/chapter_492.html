<h1>Chapter 485: The Exchange</h1><p>“Fellow Daoist, please take a look!” Steward Bao plopped down opposite Qin Sang, producing a jade box seemingly out of nowhere and placing it before him.</p><p>The jade box opened.</p><p>An intensely rich demonic aura erupted. Inside the box lay a demon core!</p><p>The pressure of a Demon Core realm demon still emanated from the core. Qin Sang and Steward Bao, being so close, couldn't help but be affected, their breathing growing heavier.</p><p>The demon core, the size of a baby's fist, captivated Qin Sang's gaze.</p><p>He leaned forward, eyes wide, observing the radiant glow flowing on the core's surface.  However, this luster appeared somewhat dim, its vitality clearly lost, suggesting it had been extracted for quite some time.</p><p>If it were a freshly harvested core, Steward Bao would likely be reluctant to trade it.</p><p>Due to the restrictive seals within the jade box, it was difficult to discern its true state.</p><p>Qin Sang extended his right hand, intending to retrieve the demon core, but Steward Bao swiftly intercepted him.</p><p>“Hold on!”</p><p>Steward Bao placed his hand over the jade box, his gaze flitting to the restrictions within the quiet chamber, reminding Qin Sang to refrain from rash actions.  “Fellow Daoist, I have shown my sincerity. Shouldn't you also…”</p><p>Qin Sang withdrew his hand, nodding slightly.  His voice was deep, “My apologies. Please, Steward Bao, have a look.”</p><p>The Corpse Puppet Sack opened.</p><p>The living corpse refined from the Yellow-Armored man flew out.</p><p>After refinement, a living corpse retains one spell or skill from its previous life. The Yellow-Armored man's was a combat movement technique, well-suited for the limited intellect of a refined corpse.</p><p>Yu Hua's retained skill was a decent sword technique, comparatively less practical than the Yellow-Armored man's.</p><p>However, Qin Sang had decided to keep Yu Hua.</p><p>Yu Hua's identity was linked to the Kui Yin Sect and the Yuan Zhao Sect, and his presence outside might attract unwanted attention. The Yellow-Armored man, hailing from the Heavenly March Alliance, posed no such risk.</p><p>The moment the Yellow-Armored man appeared, Steward Bao's eyes lit up.</p><p>His stout body moved with surprising agility.  He practically pounced on the Yellow-Armored man, his gaze filled with adoration, as if facing a lover.  He examined him inch by inch, from head to toe, not missing a single detail.</p><p>“A living corpse! It truly is a living corpse! So full of spiritual essence! You didn't deceive me! Such exquisite corpse refinement techniques!”</p><p>Steward Bao exclaimed repeatedly. Finally, focusing his divine sense on the Yellow-Armored man's energy center, he let out his loudest cry, “Pseudo Core realm! It really is Pseudo Core realm!”</p><p>Steward Bao abruptly turned, staring at Qin Sang beneath his black robe. Deep within his eyes was a profound wariness and a hint of awe.</p><p>Qin Sang calmly met Steward Bao's gaze. After the inspection was complete, he promptly said, “This individual does not originate from the Small Cold Region.  Steward Bao need not worry about his identity causing any trouble for you.  You've examined him personally. Can we continue our discussion now?”</p><p>Qin Sang underestimated him.</p><p>As soon as business was mentioned, the feverish excitement on Steward Bao's face receded like a tide. He regained his composure and sat back down. "While my strength is limited, I'm not afraid of trouble. However... if I'm not mistaken, this kind of living corpse cannot further improve, correct? There's no hope of it transforming into a Skyfiend."</p><p>Qin Sang scoffed.</p><p>“Steward Bao, are you jesting? If it could transform into a Skyfiend, wouldn't I keep it for myself? Why would I trade it now for a mere demon core?</p><p>“Even if, as legend has it, such a malignant corpse cultivates itself to the Pseudo Core realm, it would still require an immense amount of time to transform into a Skyfiend.</p><p>“Moreover, do you possess the power to subdue it?</p><p>“We're discussing a trade. If you use unfounded reasons to devalue the living corpse I painstakingly refined, I won't agree!”</p><p>Qin Sang slammed his hand on the table in mock anger.</p><p>Steward Bao remained unfazed, shaking his head. “Fellow Daoist cannot deny that I speak the truth. Compared to a malignant corpse that cultivates itself to the Pseudo Core realm, your living corpse's strength seems somewhat lacking.”</p><p>A self-cultivated, top-tier malignant corpse, its flesh tempered by Yin energy to be harder than iron, possesses astonishing speed and is only a step away from becoming a Skyfiend. Their power is formidable, a force even Pseudo Core realm cultivators would hesitate to provoke.</p><p>Living corpses were indeed inferior in this regard.</p><p>“After witnessing this, do you still think so?”</p><p>Qin Sang didn't argue. He directly commanded the Yellow-Armored man to demonstrate his movement technique and a protective spell Qin Sang had imbued him with. "A demon core is merely a dead object. This living corpse, with strength second only to a Pseudo Core realm expert, is a tremendous asset. Whether for self-defense or passed down to future generations, it is highly sought after. Is it truly not worth a demon core?"</p><p>"Spells!"</p><p>Steward Bao was clearly taken aback once more, but he quickly noted, "They are not top-tier spells, their power is limited.  They can only serve as a surprise tactic, a minor advantage."</p><p>Qin Sang almost laughed at the man's audacity.</p><p>Steward Bao looked at Qin Sang with feigned sincerity, pleading, “Fellow Daoist, you're trading for a demon core! You have no idea the price I paid to acquire this core! I'm practically bankrupt!  Not to mention what Core Formation realm experts would offer, even trading it with the Taiyi Pill Sect would yield pills of equal value to this living corpse. Of course, if you're willing to exchange your corpse refinement techniques, I'd agree immediately…”</p><p>Seeing Steward Bao's stubbornness and realizing he knew Qin Sang needed the demon core, Qin Sang decided to cut to the chase. He summoned a Foundation Establishment late-stage malignant corpse.</p><p>"I'll add another malignant corpse."</p><p>Steward Bao declared firmly, "Two!"</p><p>Qin Sang considered for a moment, then took out a jade slip and inscribed it with a list of spirit materials. "Plus these."</p><p>After reviewing the list, Steward Bao hesitated briefly before saying, "Deal!"</p><p>…</p><p>Cloudsea Great Marsh.</p><p>Once the exchange was completed, Qin Sang immediately departed from the Truewater Mirage Formation and returned to the Earth Sink Cave.</p><p>Finding a secluded spot, Qin Sang opened the jade box, carefully examining the newly acquired demon core.</p><p>One Pseudo Core realm living corpse, plus two malignant corpses, in exchange for a single demon core.</p><p>Whether it was a gain or a loss was difficult to determine.</p><p>Most transactions in the cultivation world were like this. Treasures didn't have fixed values. For Qin Sang, the demon core was essential, something he needed to obtain at all costs.</p><p>"Please, don't let this hard-won demon core fail me."</p><p>Qin Sang sighed deeply, then sped back to the Earth Sink Cave.</p><p>Yu Hua, his skin pale, stood respectfully before Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang sat cross-legged on the ground, his hand resting on Yu Hua's energy center, his eyes closed. He had remained motionless for three days, meticulously recalling the secret art of ascending to the Skyfiend realm.</p><p>The secret art was incredibly complex, and he had only one chance. He had to proceed with extreme caution, hesitant to begin.</p><p>He had mentally reviewed the secret art countless times, simulating it with Yu Hua's specific circumstances. Each discovered problem required significant time and effort to devise a solution, preparing for every contingency.</p><p>On the evening of the fourth day, Qin Sang awoke.</p><p>He had done nothing, yet he was exhausted.</p><p>After meditating for a night, Qin Sang finally opened the jade box and retrieved the demon core.</p>
