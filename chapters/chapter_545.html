<h1>Chapter 538:  Jiū Páo Dàorén's Legacy</h1><p>Before attempting to unlock the Heavenly Corpse Talisman, however, I need to use the Corpse Pill for something else.  If the pill breaks, I won't be able to do it later.</p><p>Qin Sang and Yún Yóu Zǐ agreed to meet in a secluded location far from the Qingyang Demon Sect after the matter is concluded. To avoid disrupting the secret technique, Qin Sang added two extra days, so there’s no need to rush.</p><p>He took out four items and placed them before him:</p><p>the Yin ring of the Hun Yuan Tong Xin Huan, two damaged Shi Fang Yan Luo Banners, and the iron finger ring obtained from Jiū Páo Dàorén.</p><p>He picked up the Hun Yuan Tong Xin Huan and infused it with True Qi.</p><p>The white golden ring was full of cracks.  In the past, whenever Qin Sang probed it with spiritual energy, it was like a stone sinking into the sea – the Hun Yuan Tong Xin Huan showed no reaction.</p><p>This time was different.</p><p>As soon as True Qi entered, the Hun Yuan Tong Xin Huan emitted a faint white light, then gently trembled before Qin Sang’s expectant gaze.</p><p>However, no matter how much True Qi Qin Sang infused, the Hun Yuan Tong Xin Huan remained unchanged.</p><p>After a while, Qin Sang gave up.</p><p>“It seems I need to repair it and refine the Yang ring before I can use it. No wonder the old man Di Que couldn't use it back then.  I wonder when I’ll be able to gather Wan Shi Zhang and Tian Du Yan.”</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head, putting the Hun Yuan Tong Xin Huan back into his storage pouch, and then picked up the Shi Fang Yan Luo Banners.</p><p>Two Shi Fang Yan Luo Banners.</p><p>One was damaged by the fat chicken in the Thunder Hawk’s lair while stealing the Blood Mulberry.</p><p>The other was from Jiū Páo Dàorén; its spiritual essence was greatly diminished by the defilement of the Blood-Soiled Divine Light and further damaged in subsequent battles.</p><p>The damage to these two Shi Fang Yan Luo Banners wasn’t severe. Qin Sang initially thought that nourishing them with the Corpse Pill for a while would restore them, but now it seems not so simple.</p><p>Half an hour later, Qin Sang withdrew his True Qi, held the two Shi Fang Yan Luo Banners before him, and examined them carefully.</p><p>The cracks on the banners remained; there was no sign of repair.</p><p>“How could this be…?”</p><p>The damaged parts of both Shi Fang Yan Luo Banners were on the banner surface.</p><p>Qin Sang traced his fingers across the banner surface. The pale, cloth-like surface, hanging down in a long strip, felt as smooth as silk, and emitted a chilling sensation. He examined it for a long time but couldn’t determine the material.</p><p>This shouldn’t be the case. Once a magical artifact is refined, it becomes a whole.  Nourishing it with a Golden Core should restore it.</p><p>Although Qin Sang’s Corpse Pill was unusual, it wasn’t inferior to those of other Foundation Establishment cultivators; it shouldn’t be the pill’s fault.</p><p>Qin Sang was secretly puzzled, muttering, “Could it be that I need to find spiritual objects of the same material to repair the damage? That would be troublesome…”</p><p>He had no idea how the Shi Fang Yan Luo Banners were forged.  Unless he could find the refining method used by the ancestor Kui Yin, and then find the necessary materials.</p><p>The Kui Yin Sect was destroyed, and the three Foundation Establishment cultivators who were most likely to know the Shi Fang Yan Luo Banners' forging method were all deceased.</p><p>After pondering for a moment, Qin Sang put down the Shi Fang Yan Luo Banners and turned his attention to the iron finger ring.</p><p>The dark-grey iron finger ring was covered in rust and showed no unusual fluctuations.  Thrown into a scrap heap, no one would give it a second glance.</p><p>Only when held in the hand does one realize how heavy the small ring actually is.</p><p>Qin Sang remembered his first attempt to open the ring: it seemed to contain a space similar to a storage pouch, likely a magical artifact used by Jiū Páo Dàorén to store treasures.</p><p>The ring had a restriction left by Jiū Páo Dàorén, which Qin Sang lacked the ability to break before. Now, he might be able to try.</p><p>It might contain something he needs.</p><p>“I wonder what surprises await me…”</p><p>Qin Sang's face showed a thoughtful expression.</p><p>The restriction Jiū Páo Dàorén left in the ring was primarily based on spiritual sense. Since Qin Sang’s spiritual sense hadn't improved, he couldn't forcefully break it; he needed a strategy, using True Qi to help break the restriction.</p><p>Fortunately, Jiū Páo Dàorén was dead, the restriction was ownerless, making it easier.</p><p>Qin Sang held the ring, then dashed out of the cave to a spacious area, channeled a strand of spiritual sense, and probed the iron finger ring.</p><p>The next moment, the ring suddenly shone brightly, and an extremely sharp blade energy, swift as lightning, slashed towards Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang was prepared; he tapped his feet, leaving behind a series of afterimages.</p><p>His strength had improved significantly.  Without the Ebony Sword, he could easily dodge, playfully leading the blade energy around like a dog on a leash.</p><p>At the same time, Qin Sang’s True Qi surged in his palm, along with his spiritual sense, probing the ring. After several attempts, he figured out the pattern of the restriction. Finally, he used the Corpse Pill, concentrating all his strength, found the weak point of the restriction, and finally broke it.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Inside the iron ring, the restriction shattered, revealing a space dozens of times larger than a storage pouch.  Qin Sang cautiously examined it with a wisp of his spiritual sense. Finding nothing amiss, he began to explore. To his disappointment, the iron ring appeared to be a simple storage device, its only advantage being its greater capacity compared to a storage pouch.</p><p>However, it was more convenient and discreet to carry, worn directly on a finger, making access to items quicker and easier.</p><p>Clearly, Jiupāo Daoist had used it as a storage device, filling it with various items.</p><p>Returning to his cave, Qin Sang emptied the ring's contents, carefully inspecting everything to prevent finding anything similar to the ring itself.  He examined numerous jade slips and books.</p><p>Among them was a jade slip containing a cultivation technique called the "Yin Sha Ancient Manual," a fundamental technique of the Kuiyin Sect, passed down from the ancestor Kuiyin. Qin Sang had previously obtained the first two parts of the "Yin Sha Ancient Manual" – for Qi Condensation and Foundation Establishment stages – after killing Yin Yan and the others.</p><p>The jade slip in Jiupāo Daoist's possession contained the complete four-stage "Yin Sha Ancient Manual," capable of cultivation up to the late Nascent Soul stage.</p><p>Upon recognizing the "Yin Sha Ancient Manual," Qin Sang immediately focused his attention on it. The jade slip was densely filled with Jiupāo Daoist's annotations and insights.</p><p>The "Yin Sha Ancient Manual" was a demonic cultivation technique utilizing Yin Sha energy. This explained why the Kuiyin Sect was located in the Yin Sha Abyss.  With sufficient Yin Sha energy, cultivation progressed rapidly.  However, because Yin Sha energy was an external force, it presented additional obstacles at major cultivation bottlenecks, making breakthroughs more difficult than for cultivators practicing orthodox techniques.</p><p>Upon reading this, Qin Sang immediately dismissed the "Yin Sha Ancient Manual." Even without the "Chapter on Soul-Nourishing Sword," he wouldn't consider cultivating this technique.</p><p>The technique's accompanying divine abilities and incantations mostly relied on Yin Sha energy, leaving few, if any, useful options for Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang quickly skimmed the first two stages, locating the information on the "Yin Sha Ancient Manual"'s innate treasure in the third stage.  Unexpectedly, this technique offered two highly compatible methods for refining innate treasures: the Yin Xuan Pagoda and the Yin Thunder Pearl.</p><p>Of course, a cultivator could only choose one.  Neither, however, was a banner.</p>
