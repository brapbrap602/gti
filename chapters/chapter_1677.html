<h1>Chapter 1668: Relentless Pursuit</h1><p>Zi Lei Zhenren traversed the rainbow bridge, his steps seemingly slow yet surprisingly swift.  The bridge vanished in a flash.</p><p>The windstorm surged again, and the array formations were restored. Zi Lei Zhenren soared into the sky, disappearing from sight.</p><p>Had it not been witnessed firsthand, and had the array formations not seemed affected—the windstorm's ferocity was less than before—it might have been mistaken for an illusion.</p><p>Even so, the power displayed by the Eight Scenery Palace Lantern in calming the windstorm and breaking the array formations shocked everyone present, filling them with apprehension.</p><p>The array formations on Di Shou Mountain were complex and interconnected. While they had ways to trace the windstorm upward, it was impossible for them to reach the summit as easily as Zi Lei Zhenren had done.</p><p>What happened on the mountain?</p><p>The same question arose in everyone's minds.</p><p>In a fleeting glance, they saw that Zi Lei Zhenren's target seemed to be near the summit, but its exact location and the nature of the anomaly remained unclear.</p><p>They knew he wasn't going after Kun Dao.</p><p>The number of experts who could ascend Di Shou Mountain was limited, making it easier to guess.</p><p>In this battle at the Medicine Garden, most of those present, including the mysterious Kun Dao, were accounted for. Only the two major demons from Tian Hao Tower and the whereabouts of the Faceless Man and the Lord of Qi Ling Cave remained unknown.</p><p>The latter had yet to appear, their presence or absence on Di Shou Mountain uncertain.</p><p>The most likely candidates were the two old demons, Zhu Lao Mo and Fan Lao Mo. What had these two done to provoke such a strong reaction from Zi Lei Zhenren?</p><p>For a time, everyone openly and covertly observed He Gao Zhenren.</p><p>He Gao Zhenren's expression revealed surprise, but he clearly knew something, quickly regaining his composure.</p><p>However, some were uninterested in this matter.</p><p>Qin Sang was one of them.</p><p>He hadn’t approached the Medicine Garden, his attention focused on Kun Dao. He glanced briefly at the garden, spotting several rare spirit plants deep within the earthen slope.</p><p>Wan Li Xiang, Gan Lu Ming Tan…</p><p>One by one, the names flashed through Qin Sang's mind; he recognized most of them.</p><p>These spiritual herbs largely matched Zi Lei Zhenren's previous assessment.</p><p>"Rare and precious medicinal herbs, all unseen outside!"</p><p>Qin Sang clicked his tongue.</p><p>It was impossible not to be tempted.  The Wu Xiang Immortal Sect had been closed for so long, and this was the first time the Medicine Garden had been opened.  Securing some of these herbs would be a worthwhile gain.</p><p>However, there was a matter of priority. These herbs could, at most, save some cultivation time. How could they compare to a tribulation-passing treasure?</p><p>Of course, if the Ling Xi Immortal Fruit truly existed, Qin Sang would have taken it, but this was clearly a trap set by Kun Dao using the garden's restrictions, a mere illusion.</p><p>If the Ling Xi Immortal Fruit were real, Kun Dao would be mad to use it as bait.</p><p>Qin Sang understood the importance of making the right choice.</p><p>Zi Lei Zhenren's sudden departure also created a sense of urgency for Qin Sang.</p><p>He knew that even with the help of his Heaven's Eye Butterfly, it would be difficult to break through the many array formations and catch up to Zi Lei Zhenren and the others in time to reach the summit.</p><p>To compete for the Unwritten Jade Tablet, he had to focus on Kun Dao.</p><p>Therefore, after Kun Dao fled, Qin Sang followed without hesitation, using his Heaven's Eye ability to monitor further developments.</p><p>Another who was distracted was the Poison King.</p><p>The hasty glimpse of the Ling Xi Immortal Fruit had aroused his greed, but once he confirmed it was Kun Dao's trap, the Poison King quickly dismissed it, remembering his primary goal.</p><p>A black thread crawled out of his sleeve, across his arm, and into his palm, where he swallowed a drop of blood.</p><p>The Poison King's face turned pale.</p><p>Everyone was focused on Zi Lei Zhenren, unaware of the Poison King's unusual behavior.</p><p>The Poison King was repeating his actions from before the Jade Gate, using his insect Gu's ability to sense the Jade Armor Beetle.  With so many top experts gathered, it was the perfect opportunity to use his secret technique.</p><p>Furthermore, because of the proximity, the cost was lower than before.</p><p>The secret technique complete, the Poison King abruptly turned, his gaze fixed on the direction Qin Sang had disappeared.  The Gu insect in his palm chirped towards Qin Sang—there was no mistaking it.</p><p>The Poison King's heart sank. His guess was confirmed—the Gu King had changed hands!</p><p>Finally, he had locked onto the Gu King's location, but the Poison King felt even heavier.</p><p>Having lost even the Gu King, the Faceless Man's fate was imaginable.  Since entering the mountain, this Fire Demon had shown no helpers, meaning he had the power to kill great cultivators alone?</p><p>Knowing the Faceless Man, his taming of the Gu King and his mastery of poison and wood-type spiritual powers were unparalleled, placing him among the top cultivators.</p><p>He wondered if the Lord of Qi Ling Cave was present. If it was a two-on-one fight…</p><p>A chill ran down the Poison King's spine. He shook his head, deeming it unlikely, but his apprehension towards Qin Sang remained undiminished.</p><p>Of course, with the sacred object of Wan Du Mountain and this Five-Transformation Insect Gu by his side, the Poison King wasn't necessarily afraid of Qin Sang.</p><p>Thoughts raced.  The Poison King, abandoning the medicinal herbs in the garden, transformed into a seven-colored streak of light, pursuing Qin Sang.</p><p>The Poison King's action drew the attention of the remaining three.</p><p>Mo Xingdao and Su Zinan were both surprised. They hadn't heard of any feud between the Poison King and the Fire Demon.</p><p>Mo Xingdao pondered silently. He had intended to join forces with the Fire Demon to teach Su Zinan a lesson, but the other party retreated decisively, seemingly unwilling to be entangled in the chaos.</p><p>This was a wise move.</p><p>However, the Fire Demon's indifference to the medicinal herbs was intriguing.</p><p>Ultimately, the events on the mountaintop needed to be investigated.</p><p>Su Zinan knew more and thought more deeply.</p><p>He had already provoked two powerful enemies, and received a warning from the Daoist sect, leaving him in a difficult position, perhaps no better off than Zhu Wudao. His chances of obtaining the third soul were slim.</p><p>If he couldn't achieve his goal, he needed to carefully consider his next move.</p><p>Fortunately, the Eight Scenic Views, attracting the attention of the world, bought him time.</p><p>But the immediate matter was paramount. Su Zinan's gaze followed the Poison King's light, but his thoughts were on the Fire Demon.</p><p>Was the Fire Demon drawn away by events involving Zi Lei Zhenren, or had he targeted Kun Dao?</p><p>The Bingyi Divine Disk was undoubtedly in his possession.</p><p>The Fire Demon only attacked after Kun Dao appeared, indicating he was determined to obtain the Fire Rhinoceros.</p><p>Su Zinan looked doubtful.  According to Yan Shan Lao Ren's memories, the Bingyi Divine Disk and the Fire Rhinoceros were used to suppress the Yin-Yang Eye of the tribulation formation; they had no connection and wouldn't react to each other.</p><p>And the Poison King's actions...</p><p>Su Zinan instinctively moved, but unexpectedly saw that He Gao Zhenren hadn't pursued Zi Lei Zhenren, only glancing at the mountaintop before heading towards the depths of the medicinal garden.</p><p>He Gao Zhenren's movement again affected Mo Xingdao and Su Zinan.</p><p>As the head of the Eight Scenic Views, a prominent Daoist sect, they certainly wouldn't lack medicinal herbs.  He Gao Zhenren's lingering presence suggested he had noticed something significant.</p><p>Regardless of their thoughts,</p><p>Qin Sang had already disengaged, pursuing Kun Dao.</p><p>He no longer concealed his pursuit, unable to do so. He locked onto Kun Dao's position, almost brushing the edge of the barrier, his phoenix wings beating rapidly, his body a blur, in relentless pursuit.</p><p>Kun Dao had noticed, constantly changing direction. Even blending into the barrier, her speed was slower than before, and her movements were noticeably stiff, indicating serious injuries.</p><p>She had Zi Lei Zhenren to thank; the ability to weave sword techniques with thunder was indeed remarkable. Kun Dao had been struck by both the Seven Souls Killing Formation and the Six Laws of Capture and Killing.</p><p>Two extremely powerful, yet completely different sword intents invaded her body, causing widespread destruction. The sword intents clashed violently.</p><p>Although not of the same origin, both sword intents were supremely domineering, unyielding, and incapable of compromise.</p><p>Kun Dao's body was the battlefield.</p><p>This was also intentional on the part of Qin Sang and Zi Lei Zhenren.</p><p>Given time, Kun Dao could expel the sword intents, but Qin Sang's relentless pursuit prevented her from healing.</p><p>A lightning bolt snaked through the gale.</p><p>The area ahead of the lightning was empty, but Qin Sang could sense Kun Dao hidden within the barrier, the distance slowly closing.</p><p>Kun Dao's repeated failures had left her humiliated and enraged.</p><p>She didn't yet know how Qin Sang was tracking her, mistakenly believing he could sense the lingering sword intents within her.</p><p>She hadn't considered stopping Qin Sang.</p><p>But this wasn't the Five Elements Divine Prohibition; the spirit array restrictions weren't under her control.</p><p>The grand spectacle on the mountain was her manipulation of the gale's power to channel the barrier, skillfully activating all the array restrictions. This didn't mean she could control them.</p><p>Setting a trap using the medicinal garden's protective spirit array had taken considerable effort and was somewhat strained, nearly resulting in failure at the last moment.</p><p>Knowing this, she would have preferred to fail!</p><p>After activating the array restrictions, they attacked indiscriminately, preventing Kun Dao from moving freely. Of course, she had the barrier as a support, affording her a slight advantage over Qin Sang, allowing her to manipulate parts of it to create obstacles.</p><p>The problem was, Qin Sang had the Sky-Eyed Butterfly as an assistant.</p><p>Kun Dao's hasty actions made her methods sloppy, revealing clear flaws to the Sky-Eyed Butterfly. How could she stop Qin Sang?</p><p>The effect was minimal, and Kun Dao understood the problem.</p><p>Her only recourse was to escape to the Five Elements Divine Prohibition or expel the sword intents to shake off Qin Sang.</p><p>With this in mind, Kun Dao charged towards the Five Elements Divine Prohibition, simultaneously exerting all her strength to suppress the sword intents within her, expelling those belonging to Qin Sang.</p><p>She didn't want to abandon this body unless absolutely necessary.</p><p>Qin Sang, hot on her heels, sensed Kun Dao's predicament, just as he had anticipated.</p><p>During the pursuit, using his celestial eye ability, Qin Sang finally truly tracked Kun Dao's movements!</p><p>Wherever Kun Dao passed, subtle ripples appeared at the edge of the barrier.</p><p>The ripples were faint, only visible with the celestial eye, further proving Kun Dao's inability to perfectly integrate with the barrier.</p><p>Kun Dao's escape route revealed her intentions—a golden opportunity. Qin Sang wouldn't let her return to the Five Elements Divine Prohibition.  He flicked his fingers.</p><p>*Crack!*</p><p>Lightning illuminated the gale.</p><p>A bolt struck the ripples on the barrier.</p><p>This was the third time Qin Sang had used his lightning technique on Kun Dao, and it was still effective.  The technique was instantaneous, allowing little time for defense, even for a prepared opponent.</p><p>Especially since Kun Dao was severely injured.</p><p>*Sizzle!*</p><p>Lightning strands spread across the barrier like a spiderweb.</p><p>A part of the barrier bulged, faintly revealing a human silhouette, like a picture pasted onto it. Kun Dao, however, was prepared and avoided a direct hit, appearing at the edge of the lightning net.</p><p>The bulge quickly subsided, and Kun Dao vanished.</p><p>At that moment, a white spiritual energy surged upward, powerful and imposing.</p><p>A figure appeared beside Qin Sang. The white energy emanated from his head—the manifestation of the Xuan Tian Yi Qi Da Qin Na Shou, a technique specializing in capturing and restraining enemies.</p><p>The white energy ascended, forming a giant hand.  Even before it arrived, its restraining power had sealed off the target's surroundings.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>Another loud explosion as the energy hand struck the barrier.</p><p>This attack was unexpected, but Kun Dao, able to utilize the barrier's power, wouldn't be so easily caught. The barrier trembled, and countless silken threads descended.</p><p>Each thread was like a rope, swiftly wrapping around the fingers of the energy hand, then the entire palm, breaking through the restraining power.</p><p>The energy hand faltered, its attack failing.</p><p>Kun Dao, unconstrained, created more ripples in the barrier, preparing to flee, when a ringing sword sound came from below. Jin Chen's sword pierced the air, and as the sword light approached, a sword array unfolded, instantly plunging the area into twilight.</p><p>The sword array sealed off the area but couldn't penetrate the barrier, and Kun Dao was hidden within it. Trapping her would be difficult.</p><p>Just as Qin Sang thought this, he heard Kun Dao scream.</p><p>Sword intent had penetrated the barrier, triggering Kun Dao's painful memories.  Her scream was filled with rage, but she didn't lose control. Her ethereal body spread its arms, forcefully drawing on all the power she could control within the barrier, gathering it in her chest.</p><p>Qin Sang saw no obvious abnormality, but felt a sense of danger, causing him to frown.</p><p>*Rumble!*</p><p>A cataclysmic wave crashed down, like an angry sky. The sword array was disrupted, and the gale around Qin Sang was swept away.</p><p>The gale only dared to circle the outer perimeter.</p><p>Kun Dao's manipulation of the barrier was terrifying, but within Qin Sang's expectations.</p><p>Through repeated probes, Qin Sang realized Kun Dao's strength didn't reside within herself, but externally.  Though severely injured, as long as she could control the barrier, her power remained.</p><p>In the medicinal garden, Kun Dao had voluntarily left the barrier to ambush Mo Xing Dao. Now, hiding within it, she was like a turtle in its shell. Unless he could break the barrier or force her out, all his attacks would be ineffective.</p><p>He coldly snorted, and a protective罡 fire shield appeared around him.</p><p>The giant wave crashed down onto the罡 fire shield, only slightly shaking Qin Sang's figure, but failing to stop his upward momentum.</p><p>Qin Sang looked up at the faint ripples in the barrier. The Sun God Tree appeared in his palm.  He focused his mind, and three firebirds soared into the air, instantly transforming into a fireball that struck the barrier!</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>Red flames flew. A large portion of the barrier was engulfed in flames.</p><p>If anyone were observing from above, they would see a vast fire domain erupting from Di Shou Mountain, like an erupting underground magma vein, blasting a hole through the mountain.</p><p>In fact, cultivators outside Di Shou Mountain, those south of the mountain, could all see it.</p><p>Various cultivators’ minds raced. The strange occurrences on Di Shou Mountain indicated a momentous battle.</p><p>But the strange occurrences were far from over.</p><p>Next to the fire domain,  glacial ice spread, its幽 blue light as dazzling as the flames.  Even from a distance, it was chilling, undoubtedly incredibly powerful.</p><p>This was the combined attack of Qin Sang and his incarnation, the Fourfold Serpent Seal.</p><p>Two attacks of spiritual treasure level, terrifyingly powerful, even indirectly, they were enough to injure Kun Dao further.</p><p>Just as Qin Sang was about to press his advantage,</p><p>a voice came from behind: "Friend, wait…"</p>
