<h1>Chapter 652: Embers and Fireflies</h1><p>Ya Gu closed her eyes, a faint smile playing on her lips.</p><p>“Don’t sleep!”</p><p>A deep voice suddenly intruded upon her mind.</p><p>So clear, as if right beside her ear.</p><p>Then, she felt a warm hand gently cupping her face.</p><p>Everything felt so real.</p><p>It didn't seem like a dream…</p><p>Ya Gu abruptly awoke, her eyes snapping open to look at Qin Sang.</p><p>Suddenly, tears streamed down her face.</p><p>“Don’t cry.”</p><p>Qin Sang’s brow furrowed slightly.  After Ya Gu spoke, the fat silkworms in the insect basket inexplicably became agitated, frantically gnawing at the lid, trying to escape.</p><p>He didn't have the energy to deal with them right now.</p><p>Qin Sang gently wiped away Ya Gu’s tears, saying softly, “Tell me what happened. Who hurt you? I’ll avenge you.”</p><p>Hearing this, Ya Gu suddenly realized their predicament, her face showing alarm. She frantically pushed Qin Sang away with all her might.  “Brother Qin, leave quickly! Your enemies are looking for you; they’ve tracked you here…”</p><p>Ya Gu’s face and voice were filled with urgency.</p><p>Qin Sang channeled his true energy into Ya Gu to help stabilize her breathing, soothing her. “Don’t worry. Even if there are enemies, we’re not afraid. If I can’t win a fight, I can always escape. You say my enemies are looking for me. What kind of enemies? Why did they attack you? What happened to the Five Insects Sect?”</p><p>With Qin Sang’s reassurance, Ya Gu calmed down somewhat.  “It’s the Li Witch Palace! When I was training at the Five Insects Sect, I overheard a fellow cultivator from the Hundred Flowers Palace say that cultivators from the Li Witch Palace had gone to their mountain gate, carrying a Golden Core decree, ordering the Hundred Flowers Palace to find a corpse – its left arm severed, its body reeking of corpse qi…”</p><p>The more Ya Gu explained, the more surprised Qin Sang became.</p><p>Before he left, he had consolidated the three factions, ordering them to cooperate in searching for the secret realm. It wasn't strange that a cultivator from the Hundred Flowers Palace would be at the Five Insects Sect.</p><p>A severed left arm, reeking of corpse qi… wasn't that exactly his condition when he arrived?</p><p>His cultivation was sealed, his divine sense dormant, unable to suppress the latent corpse qi in his body. The corpse qi erupted instantly, making anyone who saw him think it was a long-dead corpse.</p><p>But calling him an ancient corpse was absurd.</p><p>What surprised Qin Sang even more was that those looking for him were from the Li Witch Palace, mistaken by Ya Gu as his enemies.</p><p>The Li Witch Palace was a large sect far west, with a Nascent Soul ancestor residing within. It was quite renowned throughout the Witch God Continent, incredibly powerful and a regional hegemon.</p><p>Qin Sang’s map clearly marked the Li Witch Palace, thousands of miles beyond the Western Frontier, one of the first major forces he would encounter after leaving the Western Frontier.</p><p>No wonder Ya Gu was so panicked, so worried for him.</p><p>She knew he had only recently achieved the Golden Core stage, his strength limited. If captured by the Li Witch Palace, there would be no hope of survival. The Li Witch Palace cultivator arriving at the Hundred Flowers Palace with a Golden Core decree meant that a Golden Core cultivator from the Li Witch Palace was nearby!</p><p>While the Li Witch Palace controlled some areas in the Western Frontier, the Xiong Mountain region was remote and barren. Even the strongest nearby force, the Hundred Legs Village, wouldn't attract the Li Witch Palace's attention.</p><p>He had awakened by the Green Clothes River, never having encountered Li Witch Palace cultivators before. Why were they looking for him, claiming to search for an ancient corpse?</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly realized there seemed to be a huge mystery surrounding his arrival in the Witch God Continent.</p><p>What had happened during the time he was unconscious?</p><p>“You said that after you left, a cultivator with the surname Tong, along with a stranger, came to capture you? Did you mention to anyone that I once lost an arm?” Qin Sang asked.</p><p>Of those he’d met since waking up, only Ya Gu and the old witch doctor knew about his missing arm.</p><p>Ya Gu was very alert.</p><p>Upon hearing about the search for a corpse with a severed arm, she guessed they were looking for Qin Sang. She immediately crushed a Qingfu coin, but received no response.  She then quietly left the Five Insects Sect, using the power of spirit runes to infiltrate the Green Clothes River and float downstream.</p><p>She feared Qin Sang might unwittingly encounter his enemies.</p><p>She planned to leave messages for Qin Sang in Thousand Households Village and other places where they had interacted.</p><p>However, just before reaching Thousand Households Village, she was overtaken by the cultivator Tong and his men.</p><p>“No,” Ya Gu said, “After Brother Qin left, I didn’t speak to anyone.”</p><p>Her voice was weaker than before, her complexion suddenly worsening.</p><p>“How did they confirm my identity? Did someone see me before?”</p><p>Qin Sang frowned in thought.</p><p>A Foundation Establishment cultivator from the Wu Chong Sect, a Tong family member, was only at the early stage of cultivation.  The person he brought, however, was a mid-Foundation Establishment expert, second only to Cui Xuanzi in skill. Someone like that wouldn't go unnoticed within the Wu Chong Sect, yet Ya Gu had never seen him before. He was likely a disciple of the Li Wu Palace!</p><p>Two cultivators pursued Ya Gu. Seeing that she was only at the third level of Qi Refinement, they became overconfident.  Especially the Li Wu Palace disciple, who, after seizing the Cold Gold Sword, became enamored with it, his guard down. This allowed Ya Gu a chance to ambush them, striking with the Devouring Yuan Cones.</p><p>Despite the protective markings on her body, Ya Gu was at a significant disadvantage against the Foundation Establishment cultivators and nearly perished in their counterattack. Ya Gu only saw the Tong family cultivator explode from the Devouring Yuan Cones; she didn't witness the Li Wu Palace disciple's fate, but his failure to pursue her suggested a grim outcome.</p><p>The two Devouring Yuan Cones Qin Sang crafted contained the venom from a peak-stage demonic spirit, even a late-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator would struggle to withstand them.</p><p>“Brother Qin… cough…”</p><p>Ya Gu opened her mouth, then began to cough violently. Her complexion was even more ashen than before.  Understanding her fate, she clung to Qin Sang's hand, forcing her eyes open, gazing at him with lingering affection, wanting to imprint his image forever in her memory.  Her soul was rapidly dissipating; even the powerful life force of the Three Lights Jade Liquid couldn't stop it.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression was one of sorrow. He had already administered the best elixirs, but her wounds were too severe, it was too late.</p><p>Looking into Ya Gu's eyes, Qin Sang hesitated, then softly said: “Ya Gu, I have a secret technique that can temporarily seal your soul, preventing its dissipation.  But… I don't know if I can ever undo it. You might become an undead creature, perhaps even forever losing the chance of reincarnation.  Are you… willing?”</p><p>Ya Gu didn't hesitate at Qin Sang's words, instead asking a question that surprised him, “Brother Qin, if that happens, will you keep me by your side?”</p><p>Qin Sang was startled. He said hoarsely, "Of course, I will always keep you with me."</p><p>"I'm willing."</p><p>Ya Gu whispered, without a trace of fear.</p><p>Qin Sang slowly exhaled, retrieving a Heavenly Corpse Talisman from his Qian Jun Ring.  A Heavenly Corpse Talisman, could kill, but also ‘save’.  Qin Sang had used it to ‘save’ Tan Jie, but never expected to use it again under similar circumstances.</p><p>The river flowed, the mountains were verdant. Qin Sang held Ya Gu in his arms, his head slightly lowered, their silence heavy.  Her gaze grew dimmer.</p><p>Qin Sang sighed softly, about to activate the talisman.  Suddenly, Ya Gu awoke, using her last strength to urgently say: "Brother Qin, Grandma said… my mother gave me a name, Jin Liuying. I'm not Ya Gu, I'm Jin Liuying!"</p><p>"Jin Liuying, what a beautiful name,"</p><p>Qin Sang smiled, "My name is Qin Sang."</p>
