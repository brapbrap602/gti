<h1>Chapter 676: Redleaf Island and Tempest Island</h1><p>“Fellow Daoist, you should know that Demon Beast Core Transformation brings about a tremendous metamorphosis. The benefits they gain are far greater than those of us cultivators. Demon Beasts with powerful bloodline abilities, such as descendants of royal lineages like the Flood Dragons and Phoenixes, can often fight above their cultivation level after Core Transformation, making them extremely formidable. There was once a story about a Core Formation late-stage Black Tortoise with Black Tortoise bloodline that battled a human Nascent Soul cultivator and escaped successfully, seemingly without serious injuries. This might be related to the Black Tortoise's innate defensive abilities, but it also demonstrates the prowess of these powerful Demon Beasts. Every year, we hear of Core Formation cultivators falling prey to Demon Beasts of the same realm.”</p><p>The burly man didn't directly provide the information Qin Sang sought, but instead launched into a lengthy discourse on Demon Beasts.</p><p>Qin Sang frowned. "Fellow Daoist, what's the point of prattling on about these well-known facts? What does this have to do with the island where the Six-Petal Butterfly Violet grows?"</p><p>Unlike cultivators who rely on external objects, Demon Beasts cultivate their own bodies. Core Transformation involves a simultaneous metamorphosis of their physical bodies and bloodline power, directly boosting their strength.</p><p>Post-Core Transformation Demon Beasts are difficult to deal with. If one encounters a Demon Beast of the same realm alone, it's best to assess the situation carefully unless one possesses powerful means.</p><p>Especially in a place like the Demon Sea.</p><p>Before entering the Demon Sea, Ran Luo had repeatedly warned them that it was best to hunt Demon Beasts of the same realm with companions to avoid accidents.</p><p>Of course, Qin Sang was not to be underestimated. He had the Flying Night Devil to assist him, and with his Pseudo Core, his sustained combat ability far surpassed others.</p><p>The burly man chuckled. "It's good that Fellow Daoist understands this. I, Wu, am also afraid that you might underestimate the danger, suffer a setback, and then return to cause trouble, ruining my reputation.  The island where the Six-Petal Butterfly Violet grows is deep within the Demon Sea. I call it Redleaf Island. Several Demon Beast groups occupy the area around this island. I've personally seen several Core Formation Demon Beasts there. I barely escaped with my life. Even if there were more spiritual herbs, I wouldn't want to go back..."</p><p>As the burly man described the environment of Redleaf Island, Qin Sang's expression gradually turned serious.</p><p>The burly man's aura was no weaker than Du Han's. He was a Wu Clan cultivator, and if nothing unexpected happened, he should also have a third-transformation spirit insect.</p><p>No wonder he repeatedly mentioned his narrow escape. The area around Redleaf Island was indeed very dangerous.</p><p>"How long until the Six-Petal Butterfly Violets on the island mature?" Qin Sang asked.</p><p>The burly man scratched his head and smiled sheepishly. "I don't know much about spiritual herbs. After I returned, I asked several people to appraise them before I learned that they were called Six-Petal Butterfly Violets.  However, the remaining few are still in bud. I estimate it won't be more than a few years."</p><p>Qin Sang asked for more details, silently estimating the time.</p><p>"Growing in such a place, it's impossible to harvest the Six-Petal Butterfly Violet alone, right? If one were to invite fellow Daoists and make a big fuss clearing out the Demon Beasts just for a few spiritual flowers, the cost would be too high, outweighing the gain!"</p><p>Qin Sang's tone was deliberately despondent. "Fellow Daoist Wu, what price are you asking?"</p><p>The burly man smiled slyly. "It depends on how Fellow Daoist wants to buy it. The location where those spiritual flowers grow is very secluded; otherwise, they would have been swallowed by Demon Beasts long ago. Without my guidance, even if Fellow Daoist reaches Redleaf Island, you won't be able to find them."</p><p>Although it was seemingly insignificant information, he didn't want to give it away for free.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered for a moment and said, "Fellow Daoist is acquiring Talisman Treasures, presumably for your descendants, right? Although Talisman Treasures are powerful, they have obvious flaws. Their uses are limited, and they can only be used in emergencies. A good magical tool, on the other hand, can grow alongside a cultivator..."</p><p>As he spoke, Qin Sang took out a spirit sword.</p><p>This sword was one of the batch he had refined with Cold Gold, and also the last one. The others had long been sold.</p><p>The Cold Gold Sword had been given to Ya Gu, and Qin Sang was now keeping it for her.</p><p>Cold Gold was as rare as other spirit materials in the Canglang Sea region, a fortunate encounter. This sword could serve as the base for a magical treasure, to be later refined with high-grade demon bones.</p><p>"Cold Gold?"</p><p>Sensing the Cold Gold aura on the spirit sword, the burly man was indeed greatly moved. Without much hesitation, he agreed to the exchange.</p><p>Having obtained the location of Redleaf Island and the Six-Petal Butterfly Violets, Qin Sang bid farewell to the burly man and returned to the building he had initially entered. The map and the auction list were ready.</p><p>Qin Sang first looked at the grand auction list but didn't find anything he urgently needed. Then, he opened the map.</p><p>From Sky Witch Island to Great Wilderness Island was a long and winding route. Every island and the surrounding environment along the route were unique.</p><p>The conditions on each island were very complex.</p><p>The attendant tactfully withdrew. Qin Sang patiently examined the islands one by one and soon found Allrock Island. The information on it was not as detailed as the jade slip Zou Lao had given him, but it served as confirmation.</p><p>After a quick browse, Qin Sang finally found an area where a large number of Strangefire Sparrows had been spotted!</p><p>But soon, the joy on Qin Sang's face gradually faded.</p><p>The strongest Strangefire Sparrow discovered in this area was only at the Demon Spirit realm. Not a single Core Formation Strangefire Sparrow had been reported.</p><p>This was good news. Based on the habits of Strangefire Sparrows, a flock could only have one king, meaning there was at most only one Core Formation Strangefire Sparrow here.</p><p>But the problem was, this area was too remote.</p><p>The map indicated that the location where the Strangefire Sparrows were found was deep within the Demon Sea. The nearest island was called Tempest Island, but the journey from Tempest Island to that location was extremely dangerous.</p><p>Not only was the journey long, but the route passed through the territories of powerful Demon Beasts.</p><p>Even worse, several of these Demon Beasts were extremely adept at遁术 .</p><p>The map advised against hunting demons in that area without late-stage Core Formation strength. Otherwise, if a demon horde was alerted, there would be no escape.</p><p>Although Qin Sang possessed the Sword Qi Thunder Sound technique, his escape speed was only comparable to that of a mid-stage Core Formation cultivator, which was insufficient in that area.</p><p>"Unless I can gather all the Flood Dragon souls for the Nine Dragons Chariot Talisman and unleash its full power."</p><p>Qin Sang muttered to himself.</p><p>Gathering the souls of ten peak Demon Spirit realm Flood Dragons was almost impossible in the Small Cold Region, so Qin Sang had always maintained a casual attitude. However, it was not difficult in the Demon Sea.</p><p>Only with all the Flood Dragon souls could the true power of the Nine Dragons Chariot Talisman be unleashed.</p><p>If the Upper Yuan Pure Serenity Palace hadn't exaggerated, Qin Sang believed that with the talisman and the Sword Qi Thunder Sound, his escape technique, while not surpassing that of a late-stage Core Formation cultivator, wouldn't be far behind.</p><p>"It seems I need to be patient for a while longer, first follow Zou Lao and the others to Allrock Island and establish a foothold. The distance between Allrock Island and Tempest Island isn't too far. After gathering the Flood Dragon souls, I'll go after the Eternal Camphor Tree. There's no rush for the Six-Petal Butterfly Violet. The Primordial Concentric Rings are a secret treasure of the Spirit Controlling Sect, exceptionally effective against Demon Beasts, and will be a great help in the Demon Sea. The sooner it's refined, the better."</p><p>Qin Sang made up his mind, put away all his belongings, and left the shop under the attendant's respectful farewell. He then began to stroll around Sky Witch Island.</p><p>Chapter 676: Crimson Isle and Gloomsky Isle</p><p>“Fellow Daoist, you should know that Demonic Beast Core Formation brings about a tremendous transformation, the benefits they receive are far greater than ours as cultivators.

This may be related to the Black Tortoise's innate defensive abilities, but it also demonstrates the formidable power of these powerful Demonic Beasts. Every year, there are reports of Core Formation cultivators tragically dying at the hands of Demonic Beasts of the same realm.”</p><p>The robust man didn’t directly provide the information Qin Sang sought, but instead began to talk at length about Demonic Beasts.</p><p>Qin Sang frowned, “Fellow Daoist, why are you rambling about these well-known facts? What does it have to do with the island with the Six-Petal Butterfly Iris?”</p><p>Unlike cultivators who cultivate external objects, Demonic Beasts cultivate themselves. Core Formation is accompanied by a transformation of their physical body and bloodline power, directly boosting their strength.</p><p>Demonic Beasts after Core Formation are very difficult to deal with.

I, Wu, was afraid that you wouldn't know your limits, suffer a setback, and then come back to cause trouble, ruining my reputation. The island where the Six-Petal Butterfly Iris grows is located in the depths of the Demonic Sea. I call it Crimson Isle. Around this island, several Demonic Beast groups dwell. I've seen several Core Formation Great Demons with my own eyes. I was lucky to escape with my life. Even if there were more spiritual herbs, I wouldn't want to go back..."</p><p>As the robust man slowly described the environment of Crimson Isle, Qin Sang's expression gradually turned serious.</p><p>The robust man's aura was no weaker than Du Han's. He was a Wu Clan cultivator, and if nothing unexpected happened, he should also have a third-transformation spirit insect.</p><p>No wonder he repeatedly mentioned escaping death.

Qin Sang inquired.</p><p>The robust man scratched his head and讪smiled, "I don't know much about spiritual herbs. After returning, I asked several people to appraise it before I learned that it was called Six-Petal Butterfly Iris. However, the remaining few plants are still in bud, so it probably won't be more than a few years."</p><p>Qin Sang asked a few more details and silently estimated the time.</p><p>"Growing in such a place, the Six-Petal Butterfly Iris simply cannot be harvested alone, right? If you invite fellow Daoists and make a big show of clearing out the Demonic Beasts just for a few spiritual flowers, the cost is too high, and it outweighs the gain!"</p><p>Qin Sang's tone feigned discouragement, "Fellow Daoist Wu, what price do you want to sell it for?"</p><p>The robust man gave a sly smile, "It depends on how Fellow Daoist wants to buy it. The location where those spiritual herbs grow is very hidden, otherwise, they would have been swallowed by Demonic Beasts long ago.

The others had long been sold by him.</p><p>He had already given the Cold Gold Sword to Ya Gu, so Qin Sang was now keeping it for her.</p><p>Cold Gold, like other spiritual materials, was rare in the Canglang Sea region and hard to come by.

Each island along the route, as well as the surrounding environment, was unique.</p><p>The situation on each island was very complex.</p><p>The attendant tactfully withdrew. Qin Sang patiently examined each island, one by one, and soon found the island of All Cliffs. The information on it was not as detailed as the jade slip Zou Lao had given him, but it served as confirmation.</p><p>After a quick browse, Qin Sang finally found a region where a large number of Fallen Fire Sparrows were found!</p><p>But soon, the joy on Qin Sang's face gradually faded.</p><p>Among these discovered Fallen Fire Sparrows, the strongest were only at the Demonic Spirit realm.
