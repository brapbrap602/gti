<h1>Chapter 255: Cleverness</h1><p>Chapter 255: Cleverness</p><p>Branches chased relentlessly, one after another blurred shadows shattered in succession, but none of them could catch Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang's figure flickered, using the power of Thousand Illusions Divine Melody, his speed was extremely fast, at first, his steps were a little chaotic, as if it was difficult to control the sudden surge of speed, and a few times he nearly got caught by the branches.</p><p>But as time passed, Qin Sang's figure became more and more steady, if you looked closely, you could see that the rhythm of his movements and the changes of the branches were completely congruent, every time the branches tried to encircle, he would predict it in advance and evade in time.</p><p>Residual images became more and more numerous, as if they were countless clones of Qin Sang, the branches swung more and more violently, gradually failing to keep up with Qin Sang's movements, knotting together, and getting into a mess.</p><p>However, Qin Sang's expression became more and more serious.</p><p>A moment later, Qin Sang's eyes suddenly lit up, his figure stopped abruptly, and he pulled back and retreated.</p><p>At the moment when Qin Sang retreated, a black light suddenly burst out from the tangled branches, shooting out like lightning, just like a bottle of ink being splashed out, chasing Qin Sang relentlessly.</p><p>Because Qin Sang seized the opportunity extremely quickly, and retreated in time, the black light never touched Qin Sang, and finally exhausted its strength, slowly dissipating.</p><p>The two withered trees returned to normal again.</p><p>Qin Sang looked down at the corner of his clerical robe, there was a black hole the size of a thumb on it, and it emitted a foul stench, which was caused by the aftermath of the black light, and Qin Sang had deliberately left this flaw.</p><p>This allowed Qin Sang to experience the power of the black light.</p><p>The black light was extremely corrosive, and it was the greatest killing move of the restriction here.</p><p>After this trial, Qin Sang has already understood seventy or eighty percent of the restriction.</p><p>Fortunately, he had the Sound Conveying Conch in his hand, otherwise he would not have dared to test the law in this way with his own body, he could only rely on himself, observing with his naked eyes from outside, the possibility of understanding the restriction was extremely slim, and breaking the restriction was even more out of reach.</p><p>Staring at the branches on the withered tree, Qin Sang pondered for a while, and had already made a plan in his heart, and set out again.</p><p>It was still a similar scene to the last time.</p><p>He was forced back several times in succession by the black light, but the confidence on Qin Sang's face grew more and more sufficient.</p><p>For the last time, Qin Sang responded to the encirclement of dead branches with ease, his eyes were always tightly fixed on the depths of the dead branches, and just as the black light was born, he suddenly activated the Sound Conveying Conch with all his strength, wrapping his whole body with the power of Thousand Illusions Divine Melody, and then made a shocking move.</p><p>Ignoring the black light that was rushing towards him, he turned around and rushed in!</p><p>Qin Sang fell into boundless darkness, his flesh felt a burst of sharp pain, the omnipresent colossal strength fiercely squeezed towards the middle, trying to compress him into minced meat, the Thousand Illusions Divine Melody wrapped around his body was forced to deform, but it was still tough and never shattered.</p><p>Everything before his eyes was covered by darkness, and the next moment his vision returned.</p><p>Qin Sang stood on the ground steadily, took a quick breath, and looked back.</p><p>The black light had disappeared, those withered branches were like dead snakes that had been killed, listlessly hanging down, revealing a small path below.</p><p>"Very good! Continue!"</p><p>The voice of the old man Di Que came from the Soul Space, Qin Sang sneered secretly, and turned around.</p><p>The Dead Forest seemed to have no end, there was a winding path behind Qin Sang, he could retreat at any time, and there was still a ghost land in front of him.</p><p>Layer after layer of restrictions were broken by Qin Sang, not without danger, during which he accidentally touched a hidden restriction, and nearly got sucked into a whirlpool by a strong suction force.</p><p>At that time, the Sound Conveying Conch was restrained, Qin Sang lost a magic weapon, and sacrificed a zombie, only then did he barely gain a little time, reversing the Sound Conveying Conch, and escaping from the whirlpool.</p><p>To say that it was a dangerous situation at every step is not an exaggeration at all.</p><p>Qin Sang's whole body was covered in sweat, his energy was rapidly consumed, and he did not dare to relax in the slightest. He secretly admired Daoist Xuan Yu, not only did he break through the restrictions effortlessly, he even had the spare energy to leave secret marks.</p><p>Along the way, the old man Di Que successively discovered three spirit runes and a hidden restriction.</p><p>Daoist Xuan Yu could be said to be extremely cautious.</p><p>One of them was ingeniously embedded in the restriction, once the restriction erupted, the spirit rune would be immediately activated, fortunately, the old man Di Que was not distracted by other matters, and was able to discover it in time, and seal it.</p><p>Another layer of restriction was broken, Qin Sang's expression suddenly relaxed, the Dead Forest had disappeared!</p><p>Finally, he had walked out, Qin Sang used spiritual power to wipe the sweat off his body, but the exhaustion in his body was not easy to eliminate, he turned around and looked below, the old man Di Que and Ren Hong only set off at this time, and entered the Dead Forest.</p><p>After they walked out of the Dead Forest, the three continued to climb the mountain, after a period of tranquility, they approached a thatched cottage. The wooden door of the thatched cottage was ajar, but it was filled with yellow light, and the furnishings inside the house were not visible.</p><p>Qin Sang had already given the Sound Conveying Conch to Ren Hong, for him to familiarize himself with it.</p><p>Mao Wu, naturally Ren Hong had to break through.</p><p>Ren Hong inhaled deeply, reached out to push open the wooden door, and walked inside.</p><p>Qin Sang's energy was severely depleted so he seized the moment to recover in meditation. After an unknown amount of time, Qin Sang suddenly heard Old Man Di Que sneer.</p><p>"Quite clever!"</p><p>Before he finished speaking, the wooden door made a 'bang' sound.</p><p>Ren Hong, who was covered by the Sky Tune conch, was thrown out from the wooden door with his body stiff. He crashed hard onto the ground, there was a long and narrow sword wound on his chest. There was still sharp sword energy wriggling around the wound, wantonly damaging it.</p><p>Ren Hong's complexion was extremely pale, it was obvious that his injury was not minor, it had already affected his internal organs.</p><p>Old Man Di Que turned a blind eye to his injury, waved his hand and threw him a jade bottle with spirit pills, and coldly said: "Take a pill by yourself. I have long since prepared enough healing pills for you guys! Now the only two people by my side are you guys, each of you will be responsible for one restriction. No matter how hard it is, none of you can escape. The power of the restriction will only grow stronger and stronger. If your strength is greatly reduced by the injury, you will only die faster! Swallow the pill and then go in again."</p><p>Having said that, Old Man Di Que glanced at Qin Sang with a warning in his eyes.</p><p>Qin Sang realized that Ren Hong might have intentionally got injured, which was seen through by Old Man Di Que. No wonder Old Man Di Que sneered. Even though there were restrictions in between, every movement he and Ren Hong made could not escape Old Man Di Que's eyes.</p><p>After this incident, Ren Hong also understood this point. He didn't argue, silently swallowed the spirit pill, healed the sword wound, and pushed the door open to go inside.</p><p>After a while, Ren Hong's figure appeared behind the shack.</p><p>In this way, each restriction was broken by them.</p><p>The three of them quietly walked towards the top of the mountain and slowly approached Daoist Xuan Yu.</p><p>Qin Sang and Ren Hong became more and more proficient. Although they were inevitably injured, they managed to get through each time with惊无险 (Editor’s note: This idiom 惊无险 means thrilling but without any danger, or exciting but not dangerous.). Old Man Di Que spoke the truth. The healing spirit pills in his hands were extraordinarily sufficient. He gave one pill after another to Qin Sang and Ren Hong without being stingy, as if they were endless.</p><p>Dark clouds weighed down the mountain, it seemed like it was about to collapse.</p><p>The closer they got to the clouds, the more Qin Sang's heart felt like it was covered by a layer of dark clouds.</p><p>The power of the restriction became more and more terrifying.</p><p>Although some of the restrictions they had broken through along the way were intended to attack their souls, they were also accompanied by other terrifying attacks. If they had lost the protection of the Sky Tune conch, Qin Sang would definitely die.</p><p>Only when they encountered a simple maze or a restriction that tested one's state of mind, could he borrow the power of the jade Buddha to gain a little bit of room to move.</p>
