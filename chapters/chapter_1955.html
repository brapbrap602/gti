<h1>Chapter 1946: Transformation</h1><p>“I’m not going back!”</p><p>“Help!  They’re killing the bird!”</p><p>A heart-wrenching scream shattered the tranquility above the Qingyang Temple.</p><p>Fortunately, Qin Sang had magically sealed off the area; otherwise, the patients inside would have been terrified.</p><p>Qin Sang's manifestation was seeing patients in the main hall.</p><p>His true body stood high above, watching the Vermilion Bird frantically flapping its wings below, screaming as if its life were in danger, fleeing towards the edge of the temple grounds.</p><p>Just now, Qin Sang had simply mentioned taking it back to his mountain retreat, and the Vermilion Bird had reacted like this.</p><p>The Vermilion Bird couldn't help but be agitated.</p><p>Staying at the Qingyang Temple meant being under Qin Sang's restrictions, albeit a somewhat boring existence.  However, it got to see different people every day, watch Qin Sang treat patients in the main hall, and hear their stories.</p><p>More importantly, the future looked promising.</p><p>The Vermilion Bird was planning to endure a little longer, until Yu Lang grew up and his cultivation improved to the point he could travel down the mountain.</p><p>With Qin Sang repairing the Thunder Altar and stretched thin, it could use protecting Yu Lang as an excuse to go down the mountain legitimately.</p><p>It was a perfect opportunity – the dragon returning to the sea, the tiger back to the mountains!</p><p>Just as it felt a bright future was ahead, Qin Sang announced he was taking it back.</p><p>“Your dilapidated temple has nothing!  It’s all fire and incredibly boring! Is that a place for a bird?”</p><p>Bubbles appeared in the air, trapping the Vermilion Bird inside.  It struggled to escape, to no avail.</p><p>The trapped Vermilion Bird was carried towards Qin Sang, emitting a desperate wail.</p><p>“Have you forgotten you’re a Vermilion Bird?”</p><p>Qin Sang almost laughed.</p><p>Taking the Vermilion Bird back to his temple wasn’t to control it.  Rather, while comprehending a sword array, Qin Sang had gained some insights, and the Vermilion Bird might be able to help him.</p><p>Qin Sang wanted to emulate the Seven Mansions Division Sword Array and create his own Four Symbols Sword Array.</p><p>The Seven Mansions Division Sword Array corresponded to the Western White Tiger Seven Mansions, ultimately condensing a White Tiger malevolent spirit.</p><p>Using this as a reference, the other three sword arrays would each condense a Vermilion Bird, Azure Dragon, and Black Tortoise malevolent spirit, until all four sacred malevolent spirits appeared, completing the sword array!</p><p>The celestial constellations include the Three Enclosures, Four Symbols, and Twenty-Eight Mansions.</p><p>The Four Symbols are named after four sacred beasts, hinting at some unknown mystery.</p><p>Lately, Qin Sang had been observing the celestial phenomena at night, feeling the starlight and the power of the stars.</p><p>It seemed destined to be so, a feeling deep inside him.  The Four Symbols star regions should be named after the White Tiger, Vermilion Bird, Azure Dragon, and Black Tortoise.</p><p>Even though he practiced the *Heavenly Demon Refining Form* and channeled starlight to refine his body, he hadn't felt this way before, limited by his realm and perspective.</p><p>It was an indescribable feeling, inexplicable; Qin Sang simply had this feeling, as if when his mind sank into the void, he could see the sacred beasts leap out from the starlight. He would then suddenly awaken.</p><p>However, he wondered if it was preconceived notions, like daydreams turning into night dreams, a kind of self-suggestion.</p><p>This is the difficulty of seeking the Dao!</p><p>The Dao is elusive, and the path to it is full of trials, including wrong paths, temptations, illusions, self-created hallucinations, and mental barriers.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't help but reflect on his own situation. His main body cultivating and his manifestations experiencing different lifetimes had yielded considerable results, but his Dao comprehension had not progressed significantly. He still felt like he was looking at flowers in a fog, at the moon in water.</p><p>Regardless of whether it was right or wrong, Qin Sang had indeed grasped something, something that resonated with the true meaning of the Seven Mansions Division Sword Array.</p><p>And he had a real Vermilion Bird by his side!</p><p>Perhaps, when he invoked the stars and created the Southern Vermilion Bird Sword Array, the Vermilion Bird could offer assistance.</p><p>Qin Sang flicked his sleeve, putting away the noisy Vermilion Bird, his figure gradually fading.</p><p>…</p><p>The day after Qin Sang's departure, in the late afternoon.</p><p>A white cloud slowly drifted in from the direction of Jinyang County.</p><p>Several people stood atop the cloud.</p><p>Two of them were the young lady of the Yin family and Lin Baoshan.</p><p>The Yin family young lady’s complexion was rosy, her eyes bright and shining.  It was a sign of improved cultivation, though not yet consolidated.</p><p>Even the emerald bird on her shoulder seemed more spirited than before, its movements brimming with intelligence.</p><p>The Yin family young lady stood behind a man in brocade robes, with an extraordinary bearing – the current head of the Yin family, Yin Heqian.</p><p>“Patriarch, the Qingyang Temple is not far ahead.”</p><p>Someone behind pointed forward.</p><p>Yin Heqian nodded. “Let’s descend.”</p><p>The clouds dispersed, and everyone landed by the roadside outside Qibai Village.</p><p>“Who could imagine that two such extraordinary individuals would be, one telling stories in a teahouse and the other treating commoners in an old temple. We've only read about powerful cultivators descending to the mortal realm in books. To actually witness it...,”  a Yin family retainer craned his neck to look, sighing in amazement.</p><p>"Yes! Those spirits were hesitant, I didn't expect to learn so much from ordinary people so easily..."</p><p>As they spoke, everyone looked towards the bamboo grove by the roadside.</p><p>Footsteps and laughter could be heard from within the grove; it was nearing evening, and the students should be heading home.</p><p>"It's that young Daoist!"</p><p>Lin Baoshan whispered, watching Yu Lang emerge from the bamboo forest.</p><p>"He's a cultivator, yet he studies at a mortal academy," a young man from the Yin family said, perplexed.</p><p>Yin Heqian snorted coldly, "I've told you all to read more! Mortals may not have the power to move mountains and fill seas, but they have sages with broad minds, who explore the heavens and earth, becoming teachers for generations. We study their classics and understand their thoughts, which is of great benefit to our cultivation!"</p><p>While lecturing the Yin family youth, Yin Heqian approached Yu Lang with a calm expression.</p><p>Yu Lang, having been warned by Xiao Wu, knew a group of cultivators were approaching.  He looked towards them as he emerged from the bamboo grove.</p><p>"You must be Daoist Yu Lang? I am the head of the Yin family, and I have come with my unworthy daughter to visit your master. I apologize for the unexpected visit, is it convenient?" Yin Heqian said pleasantly.</p><p>"Oh! It's you!"</p><p>Yu Lang recognized the girl, scratching his head. "Master hasn't said anything about forbidding cultivators from coming up the mountain."</p><p>The group climbed the mountain together.  At the entrance, Yin Heqian instructed the others to wait, only taking his daughter and Lin Baoshan into the temple.</p><p>Several patients were still in the temple. Yu Lang and Xiao Wu went to help them.</p><p>Yin Heqian didn't enter the main hall directly, but patiently waited at the back, glancing at Qin Sang before calmly observing the temple.</p><p>The girl pouted, but dared not show any displeasure, obediently following her father.</p><p>After seeing off all the patients, it was nearly the ninth hour of the night.</p><p>The three approached Qin Sang. Yin Heqian bowed. "I am Yin Heqian, I greet the Daoist."</p><p>Qin Sang looked up, "Are you all here to see a doctor as well?"</p><p>Yin Heqian was startled, and quickly said, "Daoist, you misunderstand! I came to express my gratitude for saving Qiao'er and bestowing a great opportunity upon her. Qiao'er!"</p><p>"Qiao'er greets the senior! Qiao'er will always remember the senior's kindness."</p><p>Yin Qiao'er bowed deeply.</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head, packing his medical kit, "I've already said, you suffered because of me, it was an unwarranted disaster, and it was only right that I intervene. Besides, it was Daoist Qingyuan who gave you the opportunity, there's no need for gratitude between you and me. It's getting late, if you're not here to see a doctor, please leave."</p><p>Yin Qiao'er was at a loss; her usual mischievousness seemed useless before this Daoist.</p><p>Fortunately, Yin Heqian remained composed.</p><p>"We apologize for disturbing your seclusion, we shall depart now. The Yin family resides in the southern part of Yan, on Yinping Mountain at the border of Nan Shu Prefecture.  If you ever need anything, please don't hesitate to contact me, and I will do my utmost to assist you."</p><p>Yin Heqian decisively took his leave.</p><p>The Yin family disciples were surprised by their quick departure from the main hall.</p><p>"Family Head?"</p><p>"We'll talk later!"</p><p>Yin Heqian whispered.  Reaching the foot of the mountain, he soared into the air and flew away.</p><p>Almost reaching the Yin family estate, someone couldn't help but ask, "Family Head, did you discern the cultivation level of that temple master?"</p><p>Yin Heqian frowned, pondering for a long time, "His aura was elusive, and difficult to probe with secret techniques. However, he's at least in the late Yuan Ying stage.  As for Qingfeng and Qingyuan...I've never heard of these people..."</p><p>After a pause, Yin Heqian instructed someone beside him, "Send a message to Daoist Qi, have him investigate whether they're from Yun Du Mountain.  However, they might be using aliases. Tell Daoist Qi that it's fine if he can't find anything, and to leave no trace. Even if he finds something, don't act rashly."</p><p>"We'll treat it with indifference," the person replied knowingly.</p><p>"Good!"</p><p>Yin Heqian nodded.</p><p>"Father, why don't you send me to school too? I've never been to an academy," Yin Qiao'er said eagerly.</p><p>Yin Heqian looked at his daughter, "It's good that you have such aspirations, but your intentions are too obvious, and superficiality will backfire. Moreover, these two are of unknown origin, and may be entangled in unknown karmic ties, it's best to maintain a distant yet amicable attitude for now. There will be opportunities in the future."</p><p>"Yes!"</p><p>...</p><p>Winter passed, and spring came.</p><p>Unknowingly, it became the height of summer.</p><p>Half a year had passed since the encounter with Qingyuan.</p><p>During this time, the Yin family hadn't visited again, and the spirits of Jian County were cautious, avoiding disturbing Qin Sang.</p><p>Qingyang Temple remained largely unchanged, with patients coming every day.</p><p>Yu Lang and Xiao Wu went to school during the day.</p><p>In the evening, the temple was closed, and the master and his two disciples each practiced their cultivation.</p><p>One day, Yu Lang and Xiao Wu asked their master for leave.</p><p>The patients who came to see the doctor found that Qingfeng Daozhang was not in the temple, only his two disciples were seeing patients.</p><p>At this time, Qin Sang was in the underground cellar.</p><p>Before him, a talisman floated, shining with thunderous light – Taiyi's essence.</p><p>This year, Qin Sang's understanding of the main altar had yielded significant results, his progress was remarkable.  This also sped up the improvement and transformation of Taiyi beyond expectations.</p><p>Feeling the time was right, Qin Sang hesitated no longer and decided to begin working on Taiyi's essence today!</p><p>"Taiyi!"</p><p>Qin Sang called out in a low voice.</p><p>The thunderous light on the talisman flickered, Taiyi's response, indicating his readiness.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression turned serious, he descended to the main altar and sat cross-legged.</p><p>Qin Sang's actions and procedures were almost identical to those when he made the Taiyi thunder talisman before.</p><p>However, there were subtle, yet earth-shattering, differences.</p><p>'Crack!'</p><p>'Crackle!'</p><p>…</p><p>Thunder echoed repeatedly in the cellar.</p><p>The thunder contained a resolute quality, like Taiyi's roar.</p><p>Taiyi completely trusted Qin Sang, completely releasing his spirit and essence, obeying him implicitly.</p><p>Qin Sang encountered no obstacles, everything went smoothly, but he remained extremely cautious.</p><p>A whole day passed, and less than ten percent of the work was completed.</p><p>Xiao Wu and Yu Lang sent away the patients, closed the door, finished their studies, then practiced cultivation, just as they did when Qin Sang was around.</p><p>This continued until the ninth day.</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly emerged from the cellar, informed his disciples, left the Qingyang Temple, flew for a while, and arrived at a deserted wilderness.</p><p>While flying, he kept the talisman in his hand.</p><p>Reaching the wilderness, Qin Sang set up formation flags, isolating the area from the outside world. He gently tossed the talisman into the air, and with lightning speed, pointed a finger, pressing heavily on a specific point on the talisman.</p><p>Suddenly, countless lightning bolts burst from the talisman, striking in all directions.</p><p>This was the final stroke, the one Qin Sang had been preparing for the longest, and now, it was finally completed!</p><p>Qin Sang's expression was solemn, he watched the center of the lightning, and after a moment, a smile touched his lips.</p><p>It worked!</p><p>'Crack!'</p><p>…</p><p>Lightning and thunder roared.</p><p>The thunderous light emitted by the talisman became increasingly dazzling, obscuring Taiyi's essence, and the light began to distort, vaguely forming a human outline, only the limbs and head were visible, the features were indistinct.</p><p>However, the aura emanating from the humanoid lightning was indeed Taiyi!</p><p>'Rumble!'</p><p>Rolling thunder, deafening.</p><p>High-altitude thunderclouds gathered, thick dark clouds obscuring the sun.</p><p>"A heavenly tribulation, as expected!"</p><p>Qin Sang looked up at the sky, a strange light flashed in his eyes, his figure flickered, and he retreated from the range of the tribulation cloud; Taiyi had to overcome this tribulation himself.</p><p>However, since Taiyi's essence had transformed into the Taiyi thunder talisman, the three calamities shouldn't be a problem; the key was the mental demon.</p><p>The three calamities came one after another, and the tribulation thunder in the cloud was golden.</p><p>In the vast world, when demonic creatures undergo tribulation, the thunder is also golden.</p><p>It seemed that Heaven regarded Taiyi as a talisman demon!</p><p>Qin Sang stood on the mountaintop, watching the tribulation thunder fall like raindrops, until the end, the tribulation cloud dissipated, and he remained motionless.</p><p>After waiting for a while, a lightning bolt flew from the tribulation site, landing before Qin Sang, and Taiyi appeared.</p><p>His appearance remained unchanged, he was extremely excited, bowing deeply: "Junior has finally achieved divine transformation, not failing the Lord's expectations!"</p><p>"Good!"</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, "Your cultivation is not yet stable, return to Qingyang Temple for seclusion. Once your cultivation is stable, go out and search for other thunder altars, find all the branch altars."</p><p>"Yes!"</p><p>Returning to Qingyang Temple, Taiyi returned to the cellar for seclusion.</p><p>The master and his two disciples returned to their normal life.</p><p>…</p><p>"...Knowing when to stop, then one can be determined; being determined, then one can be calm; being calm, then one can be at peace; being at peace, then one can reflect; reflecting, then one can achieve..."</p><p>From behind the bamboo forest, the sound of reading was clear and resonant.</p><p>All the students put in their best effort, studying diligently, not daring to be the slightest bit slack.</p><p>It wasn't that they truly wanted to strive for improvement, but it was said that this year's autumn examination, their master had failed again!</p><p>Yu Lang did not dare to offend his master at this time, shaking his head and reciting scriptures he had already memorized perfectly.</p><p>Xiao Wu sat beside him.</p><p>"Master said, 'Read a book a hundred times, and its meaning will become clear.' But I've read and memorized all the annotations of different schools of thought, I wonder how much more I can understand…"</p><p>Yu Lang was lost in thought, noticing that his senior sister suddenly raised her head and glanced out the window.</p><p>"Senior sister, what's wrong?"</p><p>Yu Lang looked over, but saw nothing.</p><p>"Someone... fell from the sky."</p><p>Xiao Wu raised her book slightly, and with her other small hand pointed subtly at the sky, then at the window. </p>
