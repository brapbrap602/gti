<h1>Chapter 1336: The Sun God Tree</h1><p>Chapter 1336: The Sun God Tree</p><p>Vermilion Bird True Feather!</p><p>Bai’s judgment was correct.</p><p>The Nanming Lihuo is indeed the power emanating from this sacred beast feather.</p><p>The Vermilion Bird True Feather floated within the flames. Its body was extremely thin, its color similar to the deep red Nanming Lihuo, without any impurities. Unlike phoenix feathers, it wasn't multicolored, yet its beauty was in no way inferior.</p><p>Thin, silky strands of feather were incredibly soft and gently swayed, appearing as a part of the fire itself, perfectly blending with the Nanming Lihuo.</p><p>It was unimaginable that such a raging demonic fire originated from this thin feather.</p><p>A blessing in disguise.</p><p>Originally, finding the Vermilion Bird True Feather within the raging Nanming Lihuo was a very troublesome and dangerous task. Qin Sang only had less than a 30% chance of success, and the most likely accident would have occurred in this step.</p><p>The Nanming Lihuo erupted, and the Vermilion Bird True Feather unexpectedly appeared.</p><p>Qin Sang carefully examined the Vermilion Bird True Feather and was surprised to discover that it was complete!</p><p>He remembered that when the Nine Phoenix King summoned the Heavenly Phoenix True Feather, even a single, broken feather was enough to pierce the ancient prohibitions within the Seven Killing Hall’s inner chamber. The appearance of the other great demon kings in the inner chamber must have been aided by the Heavenly Phoenix True Feather’s power.</p><p>While related to the Heavenly Phoenix's inherent spatial abilities, it was enough to demonstrate the power of a sacred beast feather.</p><p>The Nanming Lihuo originated from the sacred beast feather yet feared the green copper piece. Qin Sang wondered about the green copper piece's origins, a thought that brought a smile to his face.  He had prepared for this very scenario when refining his artifact, and today he had a strong chance of subduing the Nanming Lihuo!</p><p>Qin Sang stared at the scorching demonic fire, slowly approaching the Nanming Lihuo.</p><p>He focused on the Vermilion Bird True Feather, pondering his next move.</p><p>The Vermilion Bird True Feather was the source of the Nanming Lihuo.</p><p>He didn't need to worry about the surrounding demonic fire; all he had to do was obtain and subdue the Vermilion Bird True Feather itself, and the task would be complete.</p><p>Although he could clearly see the Vermilion Bird True Feather’s location, grasping it from the heart of the demonic fire wouldn't be easy and would require taking some risks.</p><p>Due to the demonic fire's eruption, his previous preparations were useless; he could only improvise.</p><p>Qin Sang stood there, pondering for a while.</p><p>His gaze swept back and forth between the Vermilion Bird True Feather, the Nanming Lihuo, and the golden silk prohibition, analyzing the feasibility of his actions, gradually developing a plan.</p><p>"Although I can't fully understand the golden silk prohibition, by observing the interaction between the prohibition and the demonic fire, I should be able to discover some patterns and then use the prohibition's power to achieve my goal."</p><p>Qin Sang thought and acted.</p><p>He retreated a short distance, the heat subsiding slightly, took out a bottle of pills, and swallowed them all. Then, regardless of his true energy consumption, he concentrated on observing the changes in the golden silk prohibition.</p><p>Time slowly passed.</p><p>There had been too many unexpected events, and the time consumed far exceeded Qin Sang's expectations. Fortunately, he hadn't received any messages from Bai, allowing him to focus without distraction.</p><p>After an unknown period.</p><p>Qin Sang's brow relaxed slightly, as if he had made a discovery.</p><p>At that moment, his Yuan Ying puppet transmitted a strange fluctuation, and Qin Sang realized that his true energy was also running low, so he left the secret passage.</p><p>He sat cross-legged at the entrance of the stone hall, took some pills, and fully recovered.</p><p>Returning to the secret passage, Qin Sang looked at the Nanming Lihuo with anticipation, a white light flashing from his hand as he produced his newly refined artifact.</p><p>The artifact was quite unique, resembling a white copper spirit tree.</p><p>Its base was a nine-lives Xuanwu tortoise shell. After Qin Sang's refinement, the shell's shape hadn't changed much, only the back patterns had faded slightly.</p><p>The real change was internal; the green copper piece had been embedded into the tortoise shell.</p><p>This step had been the most demanding on Qin Sang's mental energy, requiring countless attempts before achieving a perfect fusion of the two treasures without conflict.</p><p>The spirit tree grew from the tortoise shell.  Its trunk was strong, branching out with twigs crafted from mysterious white copper and other spiritual materials—primarily white copper, resulting in its white appearance.</p><p>At this moment, the white copper's power was restrained, not emitting its previous intense light, appearing somewhat pale.</p><p>Qin Sang held the spirit tree, approached the edge of the Nanming Lihuo, felt the demonic fire's power, held his breath, and suddenly raised his other hand, lightly pressing against the stone wall.</p><p>The golden silk prohibition was constantly changing, and at this moment, it was gradually brightening from a dim state.</p><p>A phantom handprint cleverly landed on a rune, causing the golden silk prohibition to become even brighter.</p><p>Correspondingly, the demonic fire's power was suppressed.</p><p>Of course, Qin Sang couldn't have deciphered the prohibition in such a short time; he had relied on the help of the Heavenly Eye Butterfly to understand the patterns of change and used the opportunity.</p><p>Seizing the opportune moment, Qin Sang poured all his spiritual energy into the spirit tree and charged into the demonic fire.  The green copper piece on the tree emanated waves, suppressing the power of the Southern Ming Li Fire.</p><p>Protected by the spirit tree, Qin Sang successfully entered, a look of delight flashing across his eyes. He immediately summoned the spirit tree to descend upon the Vermilion Bird feather.</p><p>An unexpected scene unfolded.</p><p>Without warning, the Vermilion Bird feather suddenly twitched and vanished, reappearing a yard away, still gently floating. The spirit tree missed.</p><p>Qin Sang was taken aback.</p><p>He never expected the feather to dodge; he'd miscalculated!</p><p>The protection of the green copper piece only lasted a short time, so Qin Sang had to grab the spirit tree and retreat.</p><p>Although the time was short, Qin Sang's mind and spiritual energy were greatly depleted.</p><p>He gazed at the Vermilion Bird feather, noticing it was motionless again, unchanged. It didn't seem sentient; it was more likely a conflict between the feather and the green copper piece, causing an instinctive avoidance.</p><p>Qin Sang found himself in a difficult situation. After recovering, he tried again.</p><p>Several attempts failed.</p><p>The Vermilion Bird feather was too elusive to grasp.</p><p>Remaining calm, Qin Sang pondered for a while, realizing he probably needed to further comprehend the golden thread seal and use its power to restrict the feather's movement.</p><p>With this in mind, Qin Sang once again turned his attention to the ancient golden thread prohibition.</p><p>Thanks to his Heavenly Eye ability and prolonged study, Qin Sang finally made a new discovery.</p><p>After regulating his breath, Qin Sang returned to the hidden passage, a newfound confidence on his face. He left his Nascent Soul puppet outside the demonic fire and charged into the Southern Ming Li Fire without hesitation.</p><p>The spirit tree descended towards the Vermilion Bird feather.</p><p>The familiar scene repeated itself—the feather twitched.</p><p>But at that very instant, the Nascent Soul puppet punched the ancient golden thread prohibition.  Golden light erupted, affecting the feather as expected. When it reappeared, its trajectory was precisely as Qin Sang had predicted!</p><p>And the spirit tree was right there, descending forcefully the moment the feather reappeared!</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The demonic fire raged.</p><p>Qin Sang ignored it, rapidly changing his hand seals. A green light suddenly appeared at the base of the spirit tree, falling precisely onto the feather’s main body.</p><p>The Vermilion Bird feather dimmed, and the green light pulled it in.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The tortoise shell violently shook. Its back markings turned crimson at a visible speed, rapidly spreading towards the spirit tree, staining the white copper red as well.</p><p>The buds on the spirit tree's branches bloomed, and a mass of crimson energy was born.</p><p>Nine in total!</p><p>“Too bad it's not a Three-Legged Golden Crow!”</p><p>Qin Sang looked at the spirit tree, this thought flashing through his mind.
