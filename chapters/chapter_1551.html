<h1></h1><p>Sezhou.</p><p>Six Provinces Hall.</p><p>Qin Sang held a jade cup, his gaze drifting over the river flowing eastward outside the window, lost in thought.  At this moment, the door was gently pushed open. The steward entered and returned the token to Qin Sang. “We’ve found some information.  Your friend left this token in Fudù County, Zhuozhou, seven years ago. More detailed information will take some time. We are contacting the branch hall in Zhuozhou; we'll have to wait for their reply.”</p><p>Zhuozhou.</p><p>One of the four northern provinces.</p><p>The four northern provinces were roughly arranged in a diamond shape.</p><p>Ze Zhou was in the northwest, adjacent to Sezhou, and naturally bordered the Northern Wilderness. When Qin Sang and Zhou Jin emerged from the Northern Wilderness, Zezhou was their first stop.</p><p>However, of the Nineteen Provinces of Yanyu, the northernmost was actually Zhaoyao Province, named after the famous Mount Zhaoyao.  The mountain range stretched across most of the four northern provinces and was one of the iconic boundaries between the Central Plains and the Northern Wilderness.</p><p>Located in the east of the four provinces, Jinyu Province, a coastal province, enjoyed prosperous trade year-round and was the most flourishing of the four. It was also known as the "Little Jiangzuo of the North."</p><p>Jinyu Province was home to the prominent Jinyu Sect, whose wealth was renowned throughout the Central Plains.  The sect sharing the same name as the province sparked much speculation, but the origins were now lost to time.</p><p>Zhuozhou was the southernmost of the four northern provinces, closest to the Six Provinces of Jiangzuo. Although not as prosperous as the latter, it was still one of the Nineteen Provinces of Yanyu and thus far surpassed the Western Desert and the Northern Wilderness.</p><p>Even in the most prosperous places, there were inevitably impoverished and vulnerable areas.</p><p>Fudù County was one such place.</p><p>However, it was here that Xiao Xiangzi had mentioned a superior cultivation ground. Qin Sang had previously instructed Zhou Jin to focus his investigation on this area.</p><p>Seven years ago, Zhou Jin entered Fudù County, and for the following seven years, there had been no news. He had either encountered an accident or had discovered a clue and was currently investigating.</p><p>Lost in contemplation, Qin Sang rose and thanked the steward.  Just as he was about to leave the quiet room, he paused, turned, and asked, "Has anything major happened in the Central Plains recently?"</p><p>The steward replied with a smile, "Peace reigns under heaven, tranquility upon the seas."</p><p>"Peace is a rare thing..."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded slightly and walked out of the Six Provinces Hall.</p><p>…</p><p>The Tiantu River originated from the Xuelian Mountains, flowed through Sezhou, and connected to the Great Marsh of Zezhou.</p><p>In Zezhou, it branched off into another great river, flowing south, then turning east, passing through the Six Provinces of Jiangzuo, and finally emptying into the Eastern Sea.</p><p>Some considered these two sections as parts of the same river, but with the changing times, they had acquired different names. The upper section was still the Tiantu River, while the lower section was called the Fú River.</p><p>The Six Provinces of Jiangzuo were situated along the banks of the Fú River.</p><p>"Honored guest, we've arrived at the county seat."</p><p>The attendant's voice came from outside the cabin.</p><p>Traveling by water was the most convenient way to get around the four northern provinces. Although not as fast as Qin Sang’s teleportation technique, it saved energy and didn't attract attention.</p><p>Traveling by boat, they crossed Zezhou, took a tributary of the Fú River, and smoothly arrived at the county seat of Fudù County in Zhuozhou.</p><p>Qin Sang awoke and looked at his avatar sitting opposite him.</p><p>The avatar's palms were pressed together, resting on its knees, facing upwards. Four snake seals floated above its palms, emitting a faint, cold light.</p><p>The light and fluctuations from the spiritual treasure were isolated within the small cabin by a spirit array set up by Qin Sang.</p><p>Along the way, Qin Sang had assisted his avatar in cultivating the *Tongbao Jue* to refine the spiritual treasure.</p><p>Since departing from the North Sea, the avatar had been attempting to cultivate the *Ice Soul Divine Light*, but unfortunately, progress had been unsatisfactory. Qin Sang simply had the avatar cease cultivating the divine ability and focus on refining the spiritual treasure, aiming to master a powerful technique as soon as possible.</p><p>He rose and opened the window.</p><p>Qin Sang stood at the window, his hands clasped behind his back. The Western Desert was no longer visible.</p><p>The setting sun shone into the cabin, illuminating his face.</p><p>Just like that day, the sky was filled with golden light.</p><p>Ever since Liuli’s departure, whenever he saw such a scene, Qin Sang would recall the silhouette disappearing into the sunset.</p><p>He understood Liuli, because if it were him, he would make the same choice.</p><p>Therefore, he wouldn't try to dissuade her.</p><p>Only silently offer his blessings and steadfastly pursue his own Dao. They would meet again in the future.</p><p>While refining the Buddha Bone Relic, Qin Sang had persevered for a long time and reaped the greatest benefits.</p><p>He had a premonition that breaking through the bottleneck would be much easier in the future. Coupled with the enhancements from the Killing Talisman and the Cleansing Pool, reaching Nascent Soul Late Stage was just a matter of time.</p><p>The only thing left to do was to find a secure cultivation ground and diligently cultivate until the breakthrough!</p><p>As for the avatar, both Kan Mirage Pearls had been refined. If used solely to increase cultivation, it would likely reach the Late Stage bottleneck earlier than his main body, but breaking through wouldn’t be as easy.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't harbor any unrealistic hopes of having an avatar of the same realm while he was breaking through to the Late Stage.</p><p>He had a plan.</p><p>In the future, his main body would remain in secluded cultivation, prioritizing the Dao. Once the avatar mastered the *Tongbao Jue*, it would travel the world, searching for clues in the Middle Continent.</p><p>To this end, Qin Sang had been contemplating how to strengthen his control over the avatar and prevent it from developing demonic thoughts and turning against him.</p><p>If the avatar was too far from the main body, and an accident occurred, he wouldn't be able to counter it in time.  In severe cases, it could even be controlled by a powerful enemy, leading to utter destruction.</p><p>Of course, an avatar wielding a spiritual treasure wouldn't be easily captured, unless it provoked a Deity Transformation Stage cultivator. Qin Sang's goal was merely to gather information; he wouldn't readily make enemies.</p><p>During the voyage, Qin Sang had been mostly preoccupied with this matter, studying the various cultivation techniques and secret arts obtained from the Xuantian Palace. He had already made some progress.  The avatar only needed to return to the cave dwelling periodically, allowing the secondary Nascent Soul to return to the main body, restoring harmony of mind and spirit.</p><p>All things considered, there was quite a lot to do.</p><p>Through the Six Provinces Hall’s channels, he hadn’t found any news of the Ghost Mother's whereabouts.  Qin Sang settled for the next best thing, inquiring whether there were any Witch Clan cultivators in the Middle Continent.</p><p>If the Ghost Mother had safely reached the Middle Continent, she would certainly be searching for the Witch Clan as well.</p><p>The Six Provinces Hall truly lived up to its reputation, producing several ancient texts containing records of the Witch Clan. Unfortunately, they were all vague, ancient legends.</p><p>At least, there was no Witch Clan on the continent.</p><p>As for overseas, the Six Provinces Hall’s influence couldn't reach that far.</p><p>The boat reached the shore.</p><p>The hull shuddered.</p><p>Withdrawing his avatar, Qin Sang disembarked.</p><p>Distant green mountains resembled dark eyebrows.  The docks bustled with people, peddlers, laborers, boatmen, and merchants coming and going in an endless stream.</p><p>Qin Sang merged into the crowd, seemingly jostled but actually remaining untouched, maintaining a certain distance from those around him, while mortals remained unaware of any peculiarity.</p><p>After entering the city and passing by the government office, Qin Sang sensed the presence of cultivators within.</p><p>This was the biggest difference between the Middle Continent and other regions.  The walled cities and county seats of the Middle Continent not only served as gathering places for cultivators but also bore the responsibility of governing and educating the common people.  Moreover, the position of Prefect was held by cultivators, preventing mortals from establishing dynasties and ruling independently.</p><p>Whether the cultivators of the Middle Continent truly valued mortals, Qin Sang didn't know.</p><p>But he knew that with these cultivator Prefects stationed everywhere, rogue cultivators and small sects would be greatly restricted, unable to act recklessly, every action confined within the rules, and requiring careful consideration.</p><p>Even in a remote place like Fudù County, there was actually a Foundation Establishment Stage Prefect.  Unsurprisingly, this person likely hailed from the Bu Nian Shan Sect, the largest sect in Zhuozhou.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't visit the Prefect, instead entering the market area discreetly and finding a small courtyard.  Fudù County was too remote to be of significant interest to the Six Provinces Hall.  They only maintained a small post in the county seat for communication.  However, the courtyard was elegant and refined, located in the heart of the market, demonstrating their wealth.</p><p>He met with the steward of the Six Provinces Hall in the courtyard.</p><p>Qin Sang presented the token and explained his purpose.</p><p>The steward bowed and immediately returned to the inner hall, retrieving the other half of the token.  After verifying its authenticity, he cupped his hands and said, "Your friend didn't leave any other messages, but he has visited us once every year for the past seven years, consistently.  By calculation, it will be less than two months until his next visit. If senior doesn't find the courtyard too crude, you may choose a room…"</p><p>It seemed Zhou Jin hadn’t met with an accident but was delayed by something.</p><p>He would learn the truth upon meeting him.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, tossing a pouch of spirit stones to the steward.  "I just happen to have some questions for you."</p><p>The steward weighed the spirit stones in his hand, his face beaming.  "Please ask, senior.  This junior will tell you everything I know."</p><p>Qin Sang was about to speak when his expression suddenly shifted. He let out a soft exclamation.</p><p>Then, apologizing to the steward, Qin Sang leaped into the air, his steps hurried, and flew out of the courtyard. With a few flashes, he vanished from the county seat.</p><p>By the time the steward rushed out, there was no trace of Qin Sang on the street.</p><p>Confused, the steward shook his head and muttered, "Strange!"</p><p>After leaving the county seat, Qin Sang looked around, chose a direction, and sped off.  Soon, he entered deep mountains and old forests, where signs of human habitation gradually diminished.</p><p>At the same time, he reached into his spirit beast pouch. When he withdrew his hand, a fat worm rested in his palm.</p><p>After devouring the Amber Worm Crystal, the Fat Silkworm was even plumper than before.</p><p>Over the years, the Fat Silkworm had been slumbering within Ya Gu, and finally, it had awakened. Yet, it rolled incessantly in Qin Sang's palm, emitting mournful cries as if enduring immense pain.</p><p>Ripples of seven-colored light emanated from its body, extremely unstable.</p><p>This aura…</p><p>Seemed like a transformation!</p><p>After depleting its origin energy in the transaction with the Putrid Phosphorus Worm King, the Fat Silkworm had become weak.  Qin Sang initially thought it would need some time to recuperate.</p><p>Refining the Worm Crystal would also take time, even centuries wouldn't be surprising. He hadn't expected it to break through so quickly.</p><p>Even stranger, Qin Sang sensed that it seemed about to attract a heavenly tribulation, directly undergoing tribulation!</p><p>"Why is there no cocoon formation process?"</p><p>Qin Sang recalled the Fat Silkworm's previous two transformations. Each time, it would first spin a cocoon for itself, slumbering for at least several years before completing its transformation.</p><p>This time, however, was an exception.</p><p>"Could it be that after devouring the Frogfish's poison sac, the Fat Silkworm was already on the verge of a breakthrough, needing just one final push?  While traveling through the storm belt, it slumbered within Ya Gu, which was essentially equivalent to forming a cocoon?"</p><p>Qin Sang pondered silently, this seemed to be the only explanation.</p><p>Within the Seven Kill Hall, after the Fat Silkworm merged with Ya Gu, both had undergone unknown changes.</p><p>‘Squeak…’</p><p>The Fat Silkworm's cry pulled Qin Sang from his thoughts.</p><p>Qin Sang extended his divine sense, scanning the Fat Silkworm's body.  He saw that its condition was still relatively good, suspecting that it hadn't fully absorbed the Amber Worm Crystal before its transformation.</p><p>This further demonstrated that the Amber Worm Crystal was indeed a rare treasure.</p><p>Transformation was always a good thing. The Fire Jade Centipede was still stuffing its belly with Fire Molten Pills, showing no signs of transformation.</p><p>However, Qin Sang was somewhat worried.  The Fat Silkworm was so useless, only capable of detoxification. Could it withstand the thunder tribulation? He wasn't the Fat Silkworm's master; he could only use spirit arrays to weaken the tribulation lightning.</p><p>Further contemplation was pointless.  Qin Sang spread his divine sense, heading towards a desolate, uninhabited area to avoid any unforeseen consequences from the heavenly tribulation.</p><p>Just then, the Fat Silkworm underwent another change.</p><p>The seven-colored light on its body stopped expanding and began to contract, ultimately converging into a seven-colored pearl of light.  The Fat Silkworm forced its head up and eagerly swallowed the pearl.</p><p>Then, new seven-colored light began to seep from its body.</p><p>It seemed unable to control its own power.</p><p>Next, Qin Sang noticed that the new seven-colored light was much more substantial than before, quickly covering the Fat Silkworm in a thick layer.</p><p>If the previous Detoxification Armor was a thin membrane, now it was a true armor!</p><p>"Spirit insects all have their own life-saving methods."</p><p>Qin Sang mused.</p><p>After the Detoxification Armor formed, the aura of heavenly tribulation around the Fat Silkworm grew stronger, and tribulation clouds began to gather in the sky.</p><p>Qin Sang looked up, sensing the tribulation.</p><p>As expected, the tribulation's power wasn't strong, much like the Sky Eye Butterfly’s back then.</p><p>Seeing the impending tribulation, Qin Sang glanced around, then flew to the mountaintop. Looking down, he saw that the Fat Silkworm's body was completely enveloped in thick seven-colored light, forming something akin to a cocoon of light.</p><p>Placing the Fat Silkworm on the ground, Qin Sang began to busy himself. The Qianjun Ring flickered repeatedly, and palm-sized golden talismans flew out.</p><p>Before embarking on this journey, he had anticipated the possibility of the Fat Silkworm's sudden tribulation and had made some preparations.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, dozens of golden talismans formed a grand array, merging into the void.</p><p>‘Rumble!’</p><p>Tribulation clouds churned, thunder shook the heavens.</p><p>Birds and beasts panicked throughout the mountains and forests.</p><p>Qin Sang swiftly completed the final hand seal and retreated.  Just as he landed on a distant mountain, a blinding flash of silver lightning descended from the sky.</p><p>The sun dimmed.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>The tribulation lightning struck the Fat Silkworm directly.</p><p>As it passed through the golden talisman array, strands of golden thread wove into a net.  However, because of the unique nature of the heavenly tribulation, imbued with the might of the Heavenly Dao, even the most profound array couldn't completely block it.</p><p>The tribulation lightning pierced the array, striking the Fat Silkworm with its residual power!</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>Mountains crumbled, the earth cracked.</p><p>The mountaintop where the Fat Silkworm lay was flattened, and huge boulders tumbled down the cliffs.</p><p>After the tribulation lightning, the tribulation clouds slowly dispersed.</p><p>Qin Sang hurriedly flew over.  Sweeping his divine sense, he found the Fat Silkworm in a crevice, flashed over, retrieved it, and after a brief examination, revealed a surprised expression.</p><p>After experiencing the tribulation lightning, the Fat Silkworm's cocoon of light seemed unharmed, whether due to its resilience or its rapid recovery speed, he didn't know.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>The cocoon cracked open, and the Fat Silkworm poked its head out.  There were no external injuries on its body, only a slightly fatigued expression.</p><p>Inhaling, it swallowed the seven-colored light, then nudged Qin Sang's finger, swaying its plump body, intending to return to its slumber.</p><p>Qin Sang wouldn't let it off so easily.  Moving swiftly, he erased the surrounding traces as much as possible and teleported away. Then, holding the Fat Silkworm between his fingers, he brought it before his eyes, ordering it to display its new abilities.</p><p>He had been with the Fat Silkworm for a long time. Although they hadn’t reached the point of perfect understanding, he could still make it comprehend simple commands.</p><p>The Fat Silkworm shook its head and spat out the familiar seven-colored light, transforming into the Detoxification Armor and enveloping Qin Sang.</p><p>Besides being thicker than before, giving the impression of stronger protection, there didn't seem to be any other changes.</p><p>They stared at each other.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression remained unchanged.</p><p>The Fat Silkworm looked innocent.</p><p>――</p><p>――</p><p>Thank you to Big Shot Qi Zhi You Zou for the Alliance Master donation.</p>
