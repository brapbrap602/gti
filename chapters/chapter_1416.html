<h1>Chapter 1408: The Nine Rings Signet</h1><p>Chapter 1408: The Nine Rings Signet</p><p>“They’ve gone inside,”</p><p>Chijie Zhenren whispered.</p><p>He subtly rotated the ‘Nine Rings’ signet on his other hand, concealing his apprehension and excitement.</p><p>Hunmo Laoren and Chijie Zhenren appeared before the Buddha Lotus.</p><p>The fiery-red energy and the Buddha Lotus fiercely resisted each other, creating utter chaos.  Qin Sang and the others couldn’t possibly have left any countermeasures here, so they weren’t worried.</p><p>Up to this point,</p><p>besides Qin Sang and the three others, only these two Yuan Ying stage cultivators had appeared in the Kongling Sea.</p><p>Of course, other Yuan Ying might have arrived secretly, remaining hidden and evading both Tianmu Butterfly and Hunmo Laoren’s senses.</p><p>Hunmo Laoren remained silent.</p><p>He stared at the center of the light pillar.</p><p>A strange black energy spread from his pupils, his cloudy eyes instantly transforming into black demonic eyes.</p><p>Where his pupils once were, two tiny vortexes now swirled, seemingly capable of absorbing even light, reflecting shadowy figures from beyond, impossibly deep.</p><p>After a moment,</p><p>Hunmo Laoren’s eyes returned to normal. He coughed lightly and asked, “Are you certain the ‘Nine Rings’ can guide us through the Jinghai Sect’s protective formation?”</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>Chijie Zhenren hesitated, unwilling to make a definite claim, “Unless something unexpected happens…this ring was obtained by my master from the corpse of a Jinghai Sect Buddhist cultivator; it might be an elder’s token.”</p><p>“Unexpected?” Hunmo Laoren sneered.  “If nothing unexpected happened, the Nine Rings would have already found the Jinghai Sect. Why wait until now?”</p><p>Chijie Zhenren dared not argue.</p><p>Hunmo Laoren spoke the truth.</p><p>Initially, the information his master, Nine Rings, received was limited.</p><p>At the very least, they knew nothing of the Buddha Lotus array outside the Jinghai Sect.</p><p>“Let’s go inside and see,”</p><p>Hunmo Laoren tapped his black bamboo staff.</p><p>An invisible force erupted, enveloping them both.</p><p>Chijie Zhenren, initially intending to summon his protective treasure, instead opted for a silver halberd, closely following Hunmo Laoren.</p><p>They passed through a gap in the Buddha Lotus and entered the light pillar.</p><p>The strange phenomenon impacted their protective energy.</p><p>The black bamboo staff in Hunmo Laoren’s hand trembled slightly, occasionally flashing a green light, yet their protective energy remained impenetrable.</p><p>Hunmo Laoren walked steadily towards the entrance.</p><p>His steps were firm and measured,</p><p>a stark contrast to Qin Sang and the others earlier.</p><p>Witnessing this, Chijie Zhenren’s awe of Hunmo Laoren deepened. He gripped his silver halberd tightly, ever ready for any unforeseen event.</p><p>Soon, they reached the entrance.</p><p>After a brief observation, they stepped inside.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The moment they entered, a scorching gale hit them.</p><p>Hunmo Laoren raised an eyebrow and pointed his bamboo staff forward, instantly forming a thin layer of protective energy to block the wind.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the energy shield lasted less than three breaths before being eroded, like it was being corroded, revealing tiny pinhole-sized holes.</p><p>Instantly, countless golden lights pierced the shield like needles, raining down upon them.</p><p>Hunmo Laoren let out a soft surprised sound, but remained calm. He flicked his sleeve, releasing a token— identical to the Hunmo token Chijie Zhenren had destroyed earlier.</p><p>However, this Hunmo token was significantly thicker than the previous one.</p><p>The Hunmo token expanded rapidly, instantly growing to the size of a door, completely shielding them from behind.</p><p>‘Clang…clang…’</p><p>A flurry of sharp sounds echoed.</p><p>The Hunmo token, and the two cultivators, retreated repeatedly as the gale was finally blocked.</p><p>Both were unharmed.</p><p>Hunmo Laoren examined the Hunmo token. Golden liquid clung to its surface, but before he could wipe it away, it vanished without a trace.</p><p>“What was that?  It treated true essence as nothing! If there had been more…what then?”</p><p>Even with Hunmo Laoren’s vast knowledge, he couldn't identify the liquid.</p><p>Most of the Northern Sea Buddhist sects were located in the relatively peaceful Xuan Yue Realm and were insignificant. Hunmo Laoren’s knowledge of Buddhism was only superficial.</p><p>After pondering for a while, unable to determine the liquid’s origin, he turned to Chijie Zhenren, commanding, “Take out the Nine Rings signet.”</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>Chijie Zhenren sheathed his silver halberd and removed the signet from his hand.</p><p>Protected by Hunmo Laoren, he didn't need to worry about his safety.  Chijie Zhenren assumed a lotus position, closing his eyes and holding the signet in his hands.</p><p>Instantly, Chijie Zhenren’s aura underwent a dramatic change, exuding a serene and majestic presence that even Hunmo Laoren couldn't help but notice.</p><p>“A Buddhist technique?”</p><p>This thought flashed through Hunmo Laoren’s mind. He moved the Hunmo token beside Chijie Zhenren, surveying the surroundings.</p><p>It was clear they had breached the protective formation, or some kind of barrier, of the Jinghai Sect.</p><p>The moment they entered, the door vanished.</p><p>Inside the formation, they couldn't tell where they were.</p><p>Above and below, all was chaos.</p><p>They floated in the void, suspended between heaven and earth.</p><p>The evil wind was only the beginning.</p><p>Hun Mo Lao Ren could sense other attacks were imminent.</p><p>Even between attacks, the intensely concentrated crimson flames were a serious threat.</p><p>Their protective energies were being steadily depleted by the flames.</p><p>The conventional approach was to force their way through, analyzing the formation's changes to find patterns and break it.  Since the formation was unclaimed, its operation would be sluggish, increasing the chances of success, but it would be slow.</p><p>Chi Jie, holding a ring from the Jinghai Sect, might guide them out easily.</p><p>But…</p><p>Hun Mo Lao Ren's expression grew increasingly grave as he surveyed their surroundings.</p><p>These crimson flames shouldn't have been here, yet they were everywhere, even dominating the scene!</p><p>What had happened at the Jinghai Sect all those years ago?</p><p>The crimson flames and the protective formation coexisted for countless years, subtly changing things.  No one could say for sure what transformations had taken place, or whether it was even the original formation.</p><p>Hun Mo Lao Ren's mind raced, and he looked at Chi Jie Zhen Ren.</p><p>Chi Jie Zhen Ren seemed to be enveloped in a layer of gold leaf, his posture like a Lohan, his true energy constantly flowing into the "Nine Rings" ring.</p><p>"嗡嗡…"</p><p>The Nine Rings ring vibrated gently, its characters emitting an uncertain, flickering Buddha light, as if calling out to something.</p><p>Suddenly, Chi Jie Zhen Ren jolted awake, his body trembling, almost dropping the ring before he caught it.</p><p>Before Hun Mo Lao Ren could question him, Chi Jie Zhen Ren continued his attempts.</p><p>After several more tries, sweat beaded on his forehead.</p><p>"This artifact can help me sense changes in the formation, but it's incredibly difficult.  I suspect it might only work on the outer perimeter. The formation here… seems to have been altered," Chi Jie Zhen Ren said hoarsely.</p><p>This was unexpected.</p><p>Hun Mo Lao Ren's earlier assessment had been correct!</p><p>The Nine Rings ring would likely offer little advantage.</p><p>Hun Mo Lao Ren remained calm, his eyes narrowed, a cold glint flashing through them. "They must still be on the outer perimeter. Can we locate them?  It seems… we must act soon!"</p><p>—</p><p>—</p><p>Thank you to Tong Ling Yu for the generous盟主 donation!</p>
