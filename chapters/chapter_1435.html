<h1>Chapter 1427: The Seven-Story Pagoda</h1><p>“As expected, the inner temple’s seals are weakened by the enchantment…”</p><p>Qin Sang thought, secretly relieved.</p><p>Otherwise, he would have been forced to change his plans.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The orb, enveloped in demonic fire, was as pure as a water droplet, without the slightest movement, allowing the demonic flames to engulf it.</p><p>But the instant the orb left the altar, a demonic hand formed from magic light swooped down, carrying a chilling gale, fiercely grabbing at the demonic fire surrounding the orb.</p><p>Hongluan Sha lagged slightly, but could reach it in a flash.</p><p>Qin Sang, in the secret passage, remained calm and collected.</p><p>His fingers moved like wheels, rapidly forming a hand seal.</p><p>Simultaneously, his other hand pressed firmly against the seal.</p><p>With a ‘bang’, a corner of the hidden door shattered along a crack.  Then, Qin Sang tossed the Yuan Ying puppet talisman into the Buddhist hall.</p><p>Inside the Buddhist hall.</p><p>The demonic hand was about to seize the pure orb.</p><p>As the seal broke, other demonic fires erupted, a surging tide of flames forming a wall of fire that rushed towards the demonic hand.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The Buddhist hall suddenly darkened.</p><p>The Buddha and stone statues swayed slightly.</p><p>Countless black flames, carrying destructive energy, scattered.</p><p>The demonic hand, severely damaged, was forced back into its magical light form, twisting and dissipating.</p><p>Yu Yi Yuanjun witnessed everything, secretly alarmed.  “Who is this person? What kind of spiritual fire is this? Even though the Hun Mo Elder only made a hasty move, its power is astonishing.”</p><p>Thinking this, she acted swiftly, about to urge Hongluan Sha to break through the demonic fire blockade.</p><p>At that moment, the shockwave from the collision of demonic fire and demonic hand swept out.</p><p>The bones on the ground, already decayed, turned to dust instantly.</p><p>Several magic treasures flew around clanging.</p><p>On the altar, the spiritual Ganoderma lucidum, no longer protected by the seal, was knocked off by the shockwave.</p><p>Most surprisingly, it was the Buddha niche.</p><p>Hit by the shockwave, the niche cracked with a ‘crack’, and the Guanyin statue inside shattered into countless porcelain pieces, completely destroyed.</p><p>This scene astonished all three present.</p><p>The Buddha niche's location was clearly more important than the pure orb and the spiritual Ganoderma lucidum, yet it was so fragile. Was it just an ordinary offering?</p><p>Was its importance on a different level?</p><p>“Unfathomable!”</p><p>The three, having thought of the reason, uttered the same thought simultaneously.</p><p>Regardless of the ancient times, at least in the current world of cultivation, there have never been Buddha or Daoist saints manifesting themselves. They have risen to their positions step by step, always believing in themselves, unable to understand the Buddhist's thinking.</p><p>“I hope the orb isn't merely a façade as well.”</p><p>Qin Sang, relieved he hadn't chosen the Buddha niche, suddenly felt a little worried. But it was done, he could only trust his judgment.</p><p>The Buddha niche's change caused a momentary distraction, but it didn't affect the struggle for the treasures.</p><p>But at that moment.</p><p>From the fragments of the Buddha niche, a point of seven-colored light suddenly shone, illuminating their eyes.</p><p>Among the countless fragments, the seven-colored light condensed into a thumb-sized point of light, its true form being a small, crystal-clear, glass-like pagoda!</p><p>A seven-story pagoda, radiating light, captivating the eye.</p><p>“This is…”</p><p>A hidden treasure within the Buddha niche!</p><p>This discovery made the hearts of the three jump violently.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The Yuan Ying puppet talisman flashed out from behind the stone statue and directly pounced towards the seven-story pagoda!</p><p>Seeing the seven-story pagoda, Qin Sang decisively changed his plan. As long as he could obtain the seven-story pagoda, he could abandon the other treasures.</p><p>In a flash.</p><p>The Yuan Ying puppet talisman rapidly closed the distance to the seven-story pagoda.</p><p>At this time, Hun Mo Elder's voice transmission reached Yu Yi Yuanjun's ears.  Hearing the Hun Mo Elder's conditions, her expression shifted slightly, and without hesitation, she enveloped the Yuan Ying puppet talisman with Hongluan Sha.</p><p>A silvery bell-like laughter echoed around the Yuan Ying puppet talisman.  A soul transformed into a beautiful woman danced gracefully within the Hongluan Sha, full of charm, igniting desire.</p><p>This wasn't even Hongluan Sha's most powerful technique.</p><p>Hongluan Sha, refined by Yu Yi Yuanjun using lustful demonic energy, once activated, emits an odorless and colorless lustful poison, arousing the opponent's deepest desires, extremely difficult to guard against.</p><p>Even Yuan Ying cultivators could fall victim.</p><p>*Pfft!*</p><p>In a moment of urgency, the Hun Mo Elder poured his true essence into his palm.  He thrust his black bamboo staff, and a strange ripple silently appeared in the Buddhist temple, the demonic light undergoing a bizarre change.</p><p>The demonic light, now deep and restrained, recoalesced and swirled towards the seven-story pagoda.</p><p>The next instant.</p><p>Suddenly, a change occurred.</p><p>A silver thread of lightning shot from behind the statue, silently striking the demonic light just as it was about to touch the pagoda.  The two cultivators were too late to stop it.</p><p>*Snap!*</p><p>The demonic light faltered, almost dissipating completely.</p><p>It was the Heavenly Eye Butterfly's Heavenly Eye Radiance! This divine ability is capable of breaking through magical defenses and can be incredibly effective in battle, but finding the right moment to use it is extremely difficult.  It finally showed its power just as the demonic light was forming.</p><p>Simultaneously, a startled cry echoed from the front of the temple: "He's not human!" from Yu Yi Yuanjun.</p><p>The Hun Mo Elder had just simultaneously broken the Buddhist prohibitions and prevented Qin Sang from seizing the treasure; he couldn't spare the focus to activate his pupil technique.</p><p>During the great battle before the Thousand Buddha Wall, when Qin Sang released the demonic fire and his soul-infused puppet, the chaotic power of the wall masked it, preventing Hun Mo Elder from seeing it clearly.</p><p>The situation was urgent.  Coupled with Qin Sang's partial understanding of the Red Luan Curse's effects, he’d purposely disguised his actions. They hadn’t realized that the soul-infused puppet wasn't a living being, but a mere puppet!</p><p>And a puppet is naturally immune to the Red Luan Curse!</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>A fist forcefully smashed through the Red Luan Curse.</p><p>The graceful dancer let out a shrill wail and vanished into ashes.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The doors and windows of the golden-topped hall suddenly shattered.</p><p>The Buddhist light dimmed abruptly, fragments of the protective barrier formed by the prohibitions flew about, and two figures smashed through the barrier, appearing before the hall entrance. Four pairs of angry eyes pierced through the swirling black flames, fixed on the area behind the statue.</p><p>Right before their eyes, a fist grabbed the seven-story pagoda.  The soul-infused puppet moved freely through the Red Luan Curse, retreating swiftly and evading the Hun Mo Order.</p><p>Qin Sang retrieved the Nine Nether Demonic Fire, along with the pure treasure bead, and even snatched the treasure staff on the way.</p><p>He didn't covet the other treasures; lingering would risk being cornered.</p><p>At this moment.</p><p>Hun Mo Elder and Yu Yi Yuanjun hadn't even entered the temple, too late to react.</p><p>The clash lasted only a moment.</p><p>Qin Sang had seized the two most valuable treasures in the hall.</p><p>From beginning to end, Hun Mo Elder and Yu Yi Yuanjun only saw a stiff puppet, never even catching a glimpse of their opponent's true form!</p><p>"Die!"</p><p>Hun Mo Elder roared in furious rage, his killing intent overwhelming.</p><p>The terrifying aura of a grand cultivator was undeniable, causing the Buddhist and stone statues in the hall to tremble violently.  Suddenly, numerous illusory images of Hun Mo Elder appeared in the hall, hurtling towards the secret passage at incredible speed.</p><p>In the secret passage.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't have time to examine the three treasures. He crammed them into his Qian Jun Ring.  Feeling Hun Mo Elder's rapid approach, he felt a chill run down his spine, his thunder wings beating frantically as he dashed deeper into the passage.</p>
