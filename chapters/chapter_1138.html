<h1>Chapter 1130: Star Altar</h1><p>Approaching the beam of light.</p><p>“You’ve been to the Sky-pointing Peak before, so you should know what to expect. Once inside, focus solely on cultivating the secret technique; do not engage in combat…”</p><p>Qing Jun beckoned Qin Sang forward, rapidly changing hand seals and imbuing Qin Sang with numerous restrictions.</p><p>Qin Sang offered no resistance.</p><p>Upon the restrictions entering his body, he felt his cultivation suppressed to the Foundation Establishment stage.</p><p>After completing the restrictions, Qing Jun stopped.</p><p>Jiu Gu and the demonic cultivator, feeling uneasy, also intervened, adding more layers of seals onto Qin Sang.</p><p>Suddenly, Qin Sang’s expression changed. His pouches, spirit beast bag, and Qianjun Ring—all his treasures—were sealed by Jiu Gu and the demonic cultivator.</p><p>“You must not take a single Star Origin Stone out of the Sky-pointing Peak!  I will personally remove these seals upon your return.”</p><p>Jiu Gu stared intently into Qin Sang’s eyes, delivering a grave warning.</p><p>This man was battle-hardened; his gaze held a palpable aura of bloodlust.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at his senior sister.</p><p>This action was clearly a precaution against the Yuan Shen Gate and Qing Jun.</p><p>The Yuan Shen Gate excelled in formations, and with their treasures now in Qing Jun’s possession, she certainly needed Star Origin Stones for ancient formations. Otherwise, Leng Yuntian wouldn't have schemed so hard to seize the Immortal Mansion and infiltrate Sky-pointing Peak to steal Star Origin Stones.</p><p>If Qing Jun were to dedicate the ancient formations to the Two Realms Alliance to resist the Abyss of Sin, they would welcome it. However, if she hoarded the Star Origin Stones, it wouldn't sit well with other factions.</p><p>“Go!”</p><p>Qing Jun said nonchalantly.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded silently, turning and flying towards the entrance.</p><p>A vortex and storm appeared on the water’s surface.</p><p>Without hesitation, Qin Sang plunged into the vortex.</p><p>The storm at the entrance of Sky-pointing Peak, once a formidable obstacle, now posed no challenge to Qin Sang’s powerful physique. The suction force pulled at him, but Qin Sang repeatedly broke free.</p><p>Soon, Qin Sang entered Sky-pointing Peak.</p><p>The landscape remained unchanged.  The shimmering light from the ancient restrictions blended seamlessly with the Star Origin Stones.  Abundant star energy permeated the area, most concentrated at the peak of Sky-pointing Peak.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Qin Sang went against expectations, heading straight for the foot of the mountain.</p><p>Before their trip to Cang Heng Island, Qin Sang and Qing Jun had anticipated this, making a prior visit to the Immortal Mansion. Qin Sang had already placed a Star Spirit Net and the Star Altar in the Mansion.</p><p>The Star Spirit Net was used to capture Star Origin Stones.</p><p>While assisting Qin Sang, Qing Jun also harbored intentions of acquiring Star Origin Stones.</p><p>The Star Altar—a half-moon altar Qin Sang had seized from a Wu tribe cultivator in Lan Dou Gate—was crucial for breaking through the third layer of the Heavenly Demon Transformation. It was the key to his star energy infusion.</p><p>This treasure could gather star energy, and might prove helpful.</p><p>Relying on his powerful physique, Qin Sang didn’t need to use his true essence; he proceeded unimpeded, reaching the location of the teleportation array.</p><p>Qing Jun had tampered with this location to conceal the teleportation array.</p><p>Qin Sang effortlessly activated the teleportation array, suppressing his cultivation to the Qi Refinement stage, and teleported to the Immortal Mansion to retrieve his treasures.</p><p>Then, he began collecting Star Origin Stones while heading towards the summit.</p><p>“Such rich star energy!”</p><p>The joy on Qin Sang’s face intensified.</p><p>At this rate, he wouldn't even need to reach the summit to fulfill the requirements for star energy infusion.</p><p>Soon, Qin Sang stopped, sensed his surroundings, and murmured, “This is sufficient.”</p><p>After circling Sky-pointing Peak, Qin Sang found an area free of restrictions, brought out the Star Altar, sat cross-legged, and silently recited the cultivation technique.</p><p>As he activated the secret technique, the ambient star energy was drawn towards Qin Sang.</p><p>A nebulous and mysterious power entered his body, laced with obscure and dark star煞 (sha).</p><p>As expected, the star energy within Sky-pointing Peak also contained this ominous star煞 (sha), identical to the outside world, and suitable for his star energy infusion.</p><p>‘Whoosh…’</p><p>Qin Sang sat motionless.</p><p>Star energy flowed in unceasingly, the Star Altar aiding in its condensation.</p><p>Upon entering Qin Sang’s body, however, it was like a tempestuous wave, violently surging within him.  Thunderous booms reverberated through his being with each impact.</p><p>His skin and flesh began to tremble slightly under the refinement of the star energy.</p><p>Having undergone star energy infusion before, Qin Sang anticipated the pain, prepared to endure it with sheer willpower.</p><p>The star energy around Qin Sang grew increasingly dense; his entire being was bathed in starlight, shimmering brilliantly.</p><p>The influx of star energy accelerated, finally reaching the requirements of the cultivation technique.</p><p>Qin Sang’s expression tightened, his hand seals shifting abruptly.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A surge of star energy violently flooded Qin Sang's body, wreaking havoc.  His flesh tore, his bones threatened to crumble.</p><p>Qin Sang groaned, his face flushed, his jaw clenched tight.</p><p>Ignoring the agony, he pushed forward with his cultivation technique.</p><p>Blood seeped out as impurities were refined. The star energy baptism, while excruciating, brought about transformation.  His bones felt shattered, his marrow cleansed, his flesh seemingly replaced countless times.</p><p>He wondered if all body-tempering cultivators endured such pain, or if it was solely due to his practice of this demonic art.</p><p>Qin Sang's will remained unshaken.  Despite waves of intense pain, his cultivation technique never faltered.  His body was repeatedly destroyed and then reforged.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>More star energy poured in.</p><p>Qin Sang's body trembled violently.</p><p>He cried out in his heart, "Why won't it break through?!"</p><p>The star energy drawn to him far exceeded the limits described in his cultivation manual. He was reaching his limit, yet there was no sign of a breakthrough.</p><p>Ignoring the pain, he visualized the Azure Bird, but couldn't grasp the key – the Celestial Demon Dharma Form!</p><p>He felt his body was stronger than before, having advanced further within the peak of the third stage. The fourth stage seemed within reach, yet remained impossibly distant, like a chasm.</p><p>"Aaaaargh!"</p><p>A roar erupted.</p><p>The star energy dispersed.</p><p>*Crack!*</p><p>Qin Sang propped himself up on the starstone, blood flowing from the cracks in his skin.</p><p>Hair dishevelled, his body covered in wounds, he ignored his injuries.</p><p>The breakthrough had failed!</p><p>Qin Sang's brow furrowed.  While he had benefited from the star energy infusion, he hadn't been able to condense the Celestial Demon Dharma Form, preventing his advancement to the fourth stage.</p><p>"So, visualizing only a puppet wasn't enough, the true essence of the Azure Bird was lacking?"</p><p>Qin Sang muttered.</p><p>He'd harbored this concern from the start; now it was a roadblock.</p><p>He rested, then tried again several times, but gained no further benefit. The bottleneck remained stubbornly impenetrable.</p><p>"It is a demonic cultivation technique after all!"</p><p>Qin Sang sighed.  "For cultivators, Nascent Soul formation is a major transformative tribulation! The fourth stage of *Celestial Demon Body Tempering* must be more than just physical strength; it involves the Celestial Demon Dharma Form, which can't be forced.  Is visualizing a puppet insufficient; would seeing a genuine Azure Bird apparition suffice?"</p><p>Qin Sang felt apprehensive.</p><p>If this path proved unworkable, he might be unable to continue cultivating *Celestial Demon Body Tempering*.</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head, about to rise and put away the star platform.</p><p>Then, he made an unexpected discovery.  While he'd been focused on the breakthrough, the star platform beneath him had undergone a surprising change – it was actively absorbing star energy!</p>
