<h1>Chapter 1684: Above and Below the Heavens</h1><p>Above the heavens.</p><p>Holy Sage Huiguang, having secured the Demon Subduing Stake, transmitted a message to Old Demon Fan and the others.  He then manifested a lotus platform beneath him, sat cross-legged, and raised a single palm.</p><p>In an instant, a sea of light seemed to surge beneath the lotus platform, boundless Buddhist Dharma, inconceivable and profound.</p><p>Tracing its source, it originated from the halo behind Holy Sage Huiguang's head.  Within the halo's center, a Buddha image appeared, its solemn and dignified countenance resembling that of a true Buddha.</p><p>As the sea of light drifted, the faint sound of chanting sutras echoed, transmitting itself into the hearts of everyone present.</p><p>Everyone knew this was no illusion. The halos behind their own heads were displaying a wondrous rhythm, resonating with Holy Sage Huiguang, exhibiting identical fluctuations.</p><p>This resonance was the foundation of the Dhyana Arhat Formation. Holy Sage Huiguang remained the formation's master, but his current tasks were too numerous to focus solely on the battle formation. Thus, the halo's Buddha image took his place.</p><p>This Buddha image could be considered a sliver of Holy Sage Huiguang's divine consciousness, or perhaps a Dharma Body, born solely for the formation, retaining only the instinct for battle and maintaining the formation's operation.</p><p>As such, though Holy Sage Huiguang couldn't personally participate, the Dhyana Arhat Formation's power would undoubtedly be weakened. However, the vital energies of those within the formation could still revolve around the halo's Buddha image, unifying them and allowing them to jointly confront the Ancient Demon, instead of being scattered and vulnerable.</p><p>Holy Sage Huiguang couldn't stray too far from the battlefield.  Ascending on the lotus platform, he flew to a relatively safe location on the periphery, entered meditative trance, and slowly closed his eyes.</p><p>In his other hand, he held the Demon Subduing Stake.</p><p>The severed halves of the stake had been rejoined, fitting seamlessly without any visible cracks.  However, repairing this treasure was far from easy.</p><p>Holy Sage Huiguang's white eyebrows twitched slightly, and his kasaya gently billowed.</p><p>Immediately after, observant individuals noticed a tiny glimmer of light slowly drifting from Holy Sage Huiguang's chest.  Upon closer inspection, it was revealed to be an extremely small flame.</p><p>Holy King Qinghu's expression shifted subtly, a hint of astonishment in her eyes.  According to her perception, this flame seemed non-existent, visible only to the naked eye, without any discernible spiritual fluctuations or temperature.</p><p>To the naked eye, the flame didn't appear real either, its form transparent, bordering on nothingness.</p><p>Is this the old monk's Heart Fire?</p><p>It's unlike true spiritual fire. Could it be some kind of Buddhist divine ability?</p><p>This thought flashed through Holy King Qinghu's mind, only to be interrupted by a piercing sound that split the air.  A five-colored radiance shot towards her like lightning, the demonic body driven by bloodthirsty instinct, drawn to the pure and vigorous vital energy within her.</p><p>Unaffected by the external disturbance, Holy Sage Huiguang's Heart Fire expanded, a pillar of fire several zhang high rising before him. The flames remained transparent and illusory, yet exuded a powerful aura.</p><p>An astonishing scene unfolded.  The Heart Fire continued to expand, and under the astonished gazes of everyone present, it engulfed both the old monk and the Demon Subduing Stake.</p><p>The Heart Fire blazed fiercely.</p><p>Holy Sage Huiguang's figure became blurred, seemingly merging with the Heart Fire, leaving only the lotus platform beneath him maintaining its original form.</p><p>In this moment, the old monk transformed into a furnace.</p><p>Within the flames, the Demon Subduing Stake vanished, replaced by an even denser mass of Heart Fire, exhibiting endless transformations as time passed.</p><p>Using oneself as the cauldron, using the heart as the fire, refining the Demon Subduing Stake!</p><p>Above and below the heavens, in every corner of the Legacy Realm, any cultivator observing the battlefield could see this mass of flames and felt a pang of worry for Holy Sage Huiguang.</p><p>The victory or defeat of this battle rested solely on his shoulders, the pressure unimaginable.</p><p>Moreover, Holy Sage Huiguang also had to maintain the True Wheel of the Lotus Sutra, protecting the Poison King, effectively multitasking with three crucial endeavors. The drain on his mental strength was terrifying, pushing even a powerful Nascent Soul cultivator to their limits, let alone Holy Sage Huiguang, who was already injured.</p><p>Holy King Qinghu, facing the Ancient Demon directly, was under equally immense pressure.</p><p>Within the five-colored radiance, energy converged to its utmost limit, forming a needle of light, sharp beyond compare.</p><p>Locked onto by the five-colored needle, Holy King Qinghu sensed a mortal threat. Her delicate eyebrows arched slightly, and ultimately, she dared not directly confront it, her figure vanishing in an instant.</p><p>In the next moment, water pillars erupted throughout the Hanging Lake, each transforming into a Holy King Qinghu, their expressions varied, their grace no less than the original.</p><p>Her true form divided into thousands, real and illusory indistinguishable, a manifestation of the renowned Celestial Fox Illusionary Body divine ability of the Eastern Sea.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the five-colored needle proved even more troublesome than anticipated.  Completely unfazed by the illusory bodies, it abruptly changed direction, piercing towards the empty space between two of them.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>A graceful figure flashed into view. Holy King Qinghu's true body was actually hidden there.</p><p>If they hadn't known the demonic body's current state, they might have thought it hadn't lost its reason and possessed some great divine ability to see through illusions.</p><p>Knowing this was likely the inherent power of the spiritual treasure, Holy King Qinghu ceased attempting to dodge.  Her jade-like fingers traced a circle in the air, conjuring a water mirror out of thin air.</p><p>‘Pfft!’</p><p>The five-colored needle pierced the water mirror.</p><p>At this moment, the copper bowl, profound energy, jade smoke stream, and three-legged cauldron arrived simultaneously, merging into a single stream of light descending from the sky.  The time Holy King Qinghu bought was enough for those within the Dhyana Arhat Formation to react, launching a combined attack.</p><p>The water mirror abruptly reversed.</p><p>Its surface facing upwards, it carried the five-colored needle, perfectly intercepting the incoming stream of light.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The five-colored needle was instantly engulfed by the various attacks.</p><p>Before anyone could see whether the needle had shattered, a piercing shriek echoed, demonic sound invading their minds, their nascent souls feeling as if pierced by countless needles, their heads splitting with pain.</p><p>A thunderous boom resounded.</p><p>The void suddenly turned dark, countless demonic claws blotting out the sky, as if to cover the Hanging Lake entirely. Black light flashed, leaving claw marks across the void.</p><p>These claw marks closely resembled spatial fissures, their power terrifying.</p><p>Facing such demonic might, Old Demon Fan and the others were filled with dread.  Their first instinct was to evade, and Holy King Qinghu also retreated gracefully, avoiding the brunt of the attack.  However, a flicker of doubt flashed in her eyes as she stared at the demonic body at the center of the claw shadows, a bad premonition rising within her.</p><p>In the next moment, a ferocious expression appeared on the demonic body's face, and it roared fiercely. Suddenly, it raised its right arm, demonic energy billowing, transforming into a zhang-sized demonic claw.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>The black light flashing from the demonic claw appeared directly beside the grey cocoon. Simultaneously, the Five Elements Crown emitted a five-colored spiritual light, which landed on the demonic claw.  The now multicolored demonic claw slammed down viciously towards the grey cocoon that the Poison King had transformed into!</p><p>The Poison King within the grey cocoon was struggling to maintain his form, relying on Holy Sage Huiguang's protection to endure until now, avoiding becoming a meal for the Ancient Demon.</p><p>They hadn't expected that the demonic body, not yet completely consumed by madness, would still employ such a tactic of diversion!</p><p>If the cocoon were to break, and the demonic body devoured the Poison King's Nascent Soul, even regaining just a fraction more of its strength would be unbearable for them.</p><p>Unbeknownst to them, this was the Demon Spirit's last vestige of reason, a desperate gamble.</p><p>Having devoured the Demonic Child that had shaped it, and then invaded by the Heavenly Dao's Demonic Sound, it had been constantly struggling against that terrifying madness, but ultimately lost the battle.</p><p>Holy King Qinghu reacted swiftly, bowing twice towards Mingyue Yingying. Moonlight converged on the grey cocoon, but the demonic claw was faster!</p><p>‘Bang!’</p><p>The silver rings on the surface of the grey cocoon shattered, exploding under the force of the demonic claw.</p><p>The True Wheel of the Lotus Sutra hummed above, reassembling the silver rings.</p><p>However, the demonic claw had already struck the cocoon, a muffled sound echoing as a giant palm-shaped indentation appeared on its surface, deeply sunken.</p><p>The five fingers of the demonic claw curled inwards, like five sharp swords piercing the cocoon, the sound of tearing fabric echoing.</p><p>At this critical juncture, the phantom of a black line suddenly appeared on the surface of the grey cocoon—the Sacred Artifact of Myriad Venom Mountain. The hairs on the Gu insect stood on end, its body tense, and a desperately opened mouth could be seen on its head, emitting a silent shriek as it frantically spewed grey smoke.</p><p>If it were any other Grand Cultivator present, they would likely have perished at this point.</p><p>Through the desperate efforts of the Poison King and the Sacred Artifact, the grey cocoon gained a newfound resilience, enduring the demonic claw's assault until reinforcements arrived.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>Moonlight enveloped the grey cocoon, continuously surging towards the demonic claw.</p><p>The True Wheel of the Lotus Sutra, following Holy Sage Huiguang's will, reassembled the silver rings, continuing to protect the Poison King.</p><p>The demonic body recoiled its claw in pain, its roar distorting completely in the latter half, the Demon Spirit's reason completely vanishing along with it.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>Demonic energy and five-colored spiritual light merged, the demonic body's form becoming terrifying, its demonic might even greater than before.</p><p>Meeting the demonic body's gaze, filled with boundless madness, everyone felt a chill run down their spines.</p><p>However, a hint of joy appeared on Holy King Qinghu's face. With its reason gone, no matter how strong the Ancient Demon was, it possessed only brute force and was easier to manipulate. At the very least, stalling for time shouldn't be a problem.</p><p>She immediately transmitted a message to the others, informing them of the situation and reorganizing their formation to confront the demonic body.</p><p>...</p><p>Emperor Bestowal Mountain.</p><p>The Avatar's figure vanished into the Five Elements Divine Restriction.</p><p>Qin Sang planned to wait until Holy Sage Huiguang began repairing the Demon Subduing Stake, and the battle reached a stalemate, preventing the Nascent Soul cultivators from diverting their attention. Then, he would immediately leave the Formless Immortal Sect.</p><p>On the other hand, with the treasure that suppressed the seal gone, the cycle of the Five Elements was broken.  The conflict between the Five Elements Divine Restrictions intensified dramatically, the aftershocks spreading outwards, triggering and collapsing other formations and restrictions.  It could be said that the entire Emperor Bestowal Mountain had descended into chaos, heading towards destruction.</p><p>The incredibly chaotic vital energies provided the perfect cover.</p><p>With their attention fixated on the demonic body, the Nascent Soul cultivators could no longer control this place.</p><p>Unexpectedly, others harbored similar thoughts, and had set their sights on him!</p><p>The Avatar entered the Seven Constellations Domain Sword Formation and was about to check for any tracking marks left on him when he suddenly sensed something amiss.</p><p>This was thanks to the golden sword he had obtained earlier.</p><p>From it, Qin Sang inherited the Golden Aspect Hall's "Seven Constellations Domain Sword Formation." Although he couldn't control the entire formation yet, he understood its structure intimately.</p><p>Even with the chaos within the sword formation, his awareness of its changes, especially the surrounding vital energies, was extremely acute.</p><p>Upon entering the sword formation, the Avatar suddenly felt a presence behind him. He was being followed!</p><p>What startled him was the incredibly subtle aura of the pursuer.</p><p>The other party was so close, yet the Avatar only just noticed. If not for his sensitivity to the vital energies within the sword formation, he might have been forced into close quarters completely unaware!</p><p>Both the Avatar and the main body's expressions changed drastically.</p><p>With a flap of phoenix wings, the main body transformed into lightning, leaving behind an angry snort.</p><p>The Avatar, without hesitation, turned his eyes white, unleashing the Ice Soul Divine Light towards the pursuer. The Four Soaring Serpents Seal rose, but the serpents didn't attack, instead circling the Avatar as it charged towards a sword star within the formation.</p><p>Within the Seven Constellations Domain Sword Formation, each sword star was a node of sword intent.  While Qin Sang couldn't control the entire formation, he could control the pure sword intent within a single sword star, thereby mobilizing a small portion of the formation's power.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>The Avatar merged with the serpents, his body like lightning.</p><p>At the same time, a soft gasp sounded from behind the Avatar. The void rippled, and a figure materialized, instantly splitting into three.  Su Zinan stood in the middle, flanked by Old Wu and Elder Yanshan.</p><p>"Su Zinan!"</p><p>Qin Sang was furious. It was him, as he'd suspected!</p><p>The reason he hadn't let the Avatar flee immediately but instead entered the sword formation, closer to his main body, was to guard against this very scenario. He had instructed the Avatar to remain vigilant throughout, with both spiritual treasures and divine light ready to be unleashed.</p><p>To reassure everyone, Holy Sage Huiguang had conducted all promises and transactions openly. Countless eyes outside Emperor Bestowal Mountain were watching.</p><p>The Avatar, wielding a spiritual treasure, was not weak, and ordinary individuals posed no threat.  But Su Zinan was an exception.</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't forgotten that Su Zinan had vanished without a trace ever since the Nascent Soul cultivators appeared, even Holy Sage Huiguang failing to find him. Naturally, he had to be wary of this devil fishing in troubled waters.</p><p>However, Qin Sang believed the likelihood of Su Zinan daring to act under the noses of Nascent Soul cultivators was low, at least not so soon, before the battle reached a stalemate.</p><p>Unexpectedly, this devil was audacious and decisive.</p><p>It seemed the allure of the Five Elements Pill was too strong, driving Su Zinan to take such a risk.</p><p>Repeatedly targeted by Su Zinan, even Qin Sang was enraged, his killing intent ignited.  But his priority was protecting the Avatar and the Five Elements Pill.</p><p>Qin Sang had witnessed Su Zinan's strength before.  Regardless of his own divine abilities, the demonic banner that enslaved two Grand Cultivators alone was undoubtedly the most powerful demonic artifact below the Nascent Soul realm.</p><p>Even Mo Xingdao, with his late Nascent Soul puppet, couldn't gain an advantage against Su Zinan.</p><p>Facing such an opponent, the Avatar's first reaction wasn't to counterattack, but to seek refuge within the sword star.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>The Ice Soul Divine Light surged forward, the white, vast light carrying a strange, chilling aura.</p><p>Su Zinan pointed a finger, and a thumb-sized black ruler flew from his hand, expanding in the wind to become a giant ruler, splitting into several copies in mid-air.</p><p>With a ‘boom,’ an invisible barrier seemed to form between the ruler shadows, obstructing the chilling aura.  The Ice Soul Divine Light's momentum slowed for a split second before continuing its fierce descent.</p><p>But Su Zinan had no intention of directly confronting it. Old Wu and Elder Yanshan had already bypassed the divine light, charging towards the Avatar.</p><p>Being discovered by the Avatar was unexpected for Su Zinan, catching him off guard.</p><p>Blood light erupted from Su Zinan's body. His main body suddenly transformed into a blood shadow, instantly frozen by the Ice Soul Divine Light. However, his true body materialized before the blood shadow and, without hesitation, charged forward.</p><p>Qin Sang's decisiveness saved the Avatar.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the Avatar merged with the nearest sword star, his figure swallowed by the bright sword light.</p><p>Simultaneously, Old Wu and Elder Yanshan's demonic souls had caught up.</p><p>‘Roar!’</p><p>Cold light erupted from the sword star, and the Soaring Serpents roared out, their long tails whipping fiercely towards the two demonic souls.</p><p>At the same time, the sword formation's power converged around the sword star, about to form a barrier of sword intent.</p><p>Old Wu raised his demonic halberd, while Elder Yanshan's demonic soul raised a hand, unleashing a drop of spiritual water – his long-refined treasure, the One Yuan Heavy Water.</p><p>Although the Four Soaring Serpents Seal was powerful, it was no match for the combined might of two Grand Cultivators transformed into demonic souls.  The Soaring Serpents were forced back.</p><p>By now, Su Zinan's true body had arrived.  He glanced at the sword star, waved his demonic banner, and, together with the demonic souls, positioned themselves in a triangular formation. Blood surged between them, forming a vast and imposing blood formation.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>Just as the blood formation was completed, a bolt of heavenly lightning struck down from above!</p>
