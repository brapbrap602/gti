<h1>Chapter 689: Decree of Thunder Talisman</h1><p>A spirit insect bit down on the Ebony Sword. Its fangs gnawed, and swirling masses of strange air erupted from its mouth. With a crunching sound, the sword's light shattered, the fragments seemingly absorbed by the insect's fangs.  The Ebony Sword barely escaped the insect's maw, thankfully unharmed.</p><p>"A third-transformation Gu Insect?"</p><p>Qin Sang was startled. This young man was a Wu practitioner.</p><p>There were Wu cultivators on Allrock Island, but far fewer than human cultivators. After all, the Island Lord was a human Nascent Soul cultivator. These Wu cultivators were usually low-key, actively befriending human cultivators. When had they become so brazen?</p><p>This spirit insect, known as the Devouring Essence Insect, ranked among the top hundred on the Wu Insect List.  This young man not only had inner armor but also such a high-ranking natal Gu Insect!</p><p>The Ebony Sword struggled to suppress the third-transformation natal Gu Insect.</p><p>Qin Sang decisively recalled his spirit sword and retrieved the Blackwater Mirror from his Spatial Ring.  Lifting his palm, he sent the mirror spinning towards the black-robed young man. The dark mirror surface seemed to contain an infinitely deep space.  Amidst the deafening roar of waves, the spiritual water sealed within the artifact surged forth, coalescing into a ferocious black dragon that lunged at the young man.</p><p>But at that moment, Qin Sang noticed a strange look on the young man's face. His gaze sharpened, fixated on the young man's right hand.  A silver light flickered in his palm – a talisman!</p><p>The instant he saw the silver light, a premonition of danger surged through Qin Sang.</p><p>Seeing that Qin Sang had noticed his actions, the black-robed young man no longer concealed them. He swung his palm fiercely towards Qin Sang, sneering, "Die!"</p><p>*Crack!*</p><p>A shimmering silver talisman shattered before Qin Sang.</p><p>In that moment, Qin Sang's hair stood on end. He felt a sense of impending doom.</p><p>Above him, a dark cloud had appeared in the previously clear sky. This cloud was the source of the terrifying feeling that washed over him.</p><p>Horrified, Qin Sang didn't even dare to look up.  His body moved faster than his mind. He hurled the Blackwater Mirror, originally aimed at the young man, upwards, then focused his mind on his dantian, unhesitatingly activating the Nine Dragons Chariot Talisman.</p><p>*"Roar!"*</p><p>A miniature image of a flood dragon appeared above Qin Sang's head, then swooped down, merging into his body.</p><p>The next instant, a crimson light shield enveloped Qin Sang, with the dragon's soul swirling within, majestic and divine.  He transformed into a streak of silver and red light, shifting several meters in the blink of an eye.</p><p>Just as Qin Sang vanished, an incredibly thin bolt of lightning descended from the sky, striking the Blackwater Mirror. It instantly destroyed the artifact and continued downwards, striking Qin Sang's afterimage, narrowly missing him.</p><p>The lightning bolt, having missed Qin Sang, struck the sea.</p><p>A deafening boom echoed as the terrifying power within the lightning exploded. A crater nearly ten meters in diameter was blasted into the sea, and silver light scattered like fish.</p><p>The seawater slowly closed back in as the power dissipated.</p><p>Qin Sang broke out in a cold sweat.</p><p>If it weren't for the Nine Dragons Chariot Talisman and the Sword Qi Thunder Sound, if it weren't for the Blackwater Mirror blocking the lightning for an instant…</p><p>If he had been even a fraction of a second slower, he would have been struck by that lightning, and there would have been no chance of survival. Qin Sang estimated that even a late-stage Core Formation cultivator would be gravely injured, at the very least, if hit by that lightning.</p><p>Qin Sang's face was grim as he stared at the black-robed young man, his eyes filled with killing intent.</p><p>That thunder talisman was terrifyingly powerful. In a fight between Core Formation cultivators, it could decide the victor.</p><p>If he hadn't had so many escape methods, if he hadn't been so vigilant and cautious, if he had underestimated the young man, he truly would have capsized in this encounter.</p><p>“The Decree of Thunder Talisman didn't kill you?"</p><p>The black-robed young man was stunned, clearly surprised that Qin Sang possessed such speed, dodging even a sure-kill attack.</p><p>Then, the young man saw Qin Sang summon three demonic banners, their power clearly extraordinary.  Panic finally showed on his face.</p><p>Qin Sang was still shaken, and the young man was even more frustrated.</p><p>This Decree of Thunder Talisman was a life-saving talisman given to him by his master.  Used unexpectedly, it could even kill late-stage Core Formation experts, yet it was dodged.</p><p>Moreover, the artifacts Qin Sang produced made him tremble.  This person's cultivation wasn't high, but his treasures were astonishingly numerous. The young man regretted provoking such a formidable opponent.</p><p>He hurriedly urged his natal Gu Insect towards Qin Sang and reached for his storage pouch, seemingly intending to retrieve something else.  However, at that moment, he felt a gust of wind behind him.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>Unbeknownst to him, the Ten Yama Banners were merely a distraction.</p><p>The Skyfiend, lurking in the depths, finally seized the opportunity while the young man's attention was fixed on the thunder talisman and Qin Sang.</p><p>The young man caught a glimpse of a dark shadow in his peripheral vision.  Too shocked to react, he was struck in the back by the Skyfiend's claw.</p><p>Although his inner armor provided some protection, the terrifying force still penetrated his body, instantly inflicting grievous injuries.  The young man screamed as he was sent flying.</p><p>His natal Gu Insect, sensing its master's danger, cried out and flew back to his rescue.  Unfortunately, Qin Sang was faster.  He and the Skyfiend attacked from both sides, closing in on the young man.</p><p>But at that moment, a crimson streak of light appeared in the distance. Someone was rapidly approaching.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes narrowed. The newcomer was likely the black-robed young man's accomplice. Although there was only one, judging by the momentum of their escape light, their cultivation was at least mid-stage Core Formation.  Weakened by the previous fight, he couldn't risk a confrontation.</p><p>Furthermore, the black-robed young man possessed several valuable treasures, indicating a high status within the Wu clan. He might not have only one accomplice.</p><p>Qin Sang, who had originally planned to capture the young man alive for interrogation, immediately changed his mind, ordering the Skyfiend to kill.</p><p>The gravely injured young man was practically defenseless. He barely dodged a sword strike before a ghostly claw pierced through the back of his head, killing him instantly.</p><p>His natal Gu Insect, linked to its master's life, also perished the moment he died.</p><p>With a cold expression, Qin Sang recalled the Skyfiend and swiftly took the storage pouch from the young man's waist, along with the nearly destroyed inner armor. Then, activating his secret talismans and Sword Qi Thunder Sound, he swiftly departed.</p><p>Before leaving, he even took the time to incinerate the young man's body.</p><p>He chose a direction that wasn't towards Allrock Island but back the way he had come.</p><p>Something unusual was happening on Allrock Island, and until he knew what it was, he didn't want to get involved.  Other directions might have the young man's accomplices, so the safest route was back to the Floating Gourd Sea.</p><p>The black-robed young man's accomplice arrived just after Qin Sang had killed him.</p><p>Witnessing the destruction of his companion's body, the newcomer flew into a rage, frantically chasing after Qin Sang.  But his escape technique was far inferior to Qin Sang's, and the distance between them grew wider and wider.</p><p>Soon, he lost sight of his target completely.</p><p>On the vast ocean, Qin Sang vanished without a trace.</p>
