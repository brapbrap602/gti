**Chapter 153: Heaven Severing Mountain**

Yu Daiyue's eyebrows knitted briefly, but he said nothing.

The Liu brothers and White Cloud exchanged hushed words before speaking to Qingting and Yu Daiyue, "Thank you, Fellow Daoists, for your consideration. We are willing to go. Rest assured, since we are here, we will not leave empty-handed unless the place is truly dangerous. Otherwise, we will certainly accompany you until the end."

Wu Yuesheng laughed, "Fellow Daoist Liu is right. However, if it is truly a perilous place, Senior Sister Qingting and Senior Brother Yu would not be throwing their lives away, right? Junior Brother Qin, what do you think?"

Qin Sang had been sitting quietly, but he looked up at Wu Yuesheng's question. Seeing his friendly smile, he felt something stir within him. He nodded, "Indeed. As long as we break the formation, everything will be revealed."

With that, everyone agreed to join forces and break the formation. Yu Daiyue's face lit up, and he clapped his hands together. "Good! Now that you have all agreed, I will no longer bother to invite others. I will now hand you the Fiery Raven Talismans. Refining the talisman will take ten days. In ten days, we will gather here on this island. Fellow Daoists, do not go back on your word."

They didn't know much about the ancient cultivator's ruins and had nothing to discuss. They would have to adapt as they went after breaking the formation. Each of them received a Fiery Raven Talisman and bid farewell.

As he flew towards his cave, Qin Sang took out the Fiery Raven Talisman he had received. It was different from Yu Daiyue's. The flames were not dark green but pink, and the Fiery Raven Essence was also different.

"It's probably because different corpses of spirit birds were used, which is why there is a difference," Qin Sang muttered.

He did not hesitate for long before agreeing to explore the ancient cultivator's ruins. It was also because unlike a year ago, he now had something to rely on.

Firstly, after learning the true power of the Profound Yin Thunder, he had gained some confidence. Moreover, Senior Sister Qingting's conditions were generous. If it was truly dangerous, they would simply turn around and leave.

Secondly, he had successfully broken through to the second level of the Divine Sword Nurturing Scripture and had also mastered the divine ability attached to it.

Man and sword become one, disappearing without a trace.

Qin Sang had thought it was a technique for concealing sword flight, but after truly mastering it, he realized that this phrase did not refer to the person who forged the sword but to the spirit sword itself.

Through the sword symbol on the Ebony Wood Sword, divine sense could not only allow the spirit sword to move silently but also, because the Ebony Wood Sword's material was so pure, it could transform the Ebony Wood Sword into a pure wood spirit sword embryo, concealing its sword form and making it difficult for opponents to detect. In the moment of approaching an enemy, it would erupt with powerful sword energy and killing intent, killing with a single strike. It turned the spirit sword into an invisible killing sword with endless uses.

Qin Sang's foundation was damaged, and the last thing he wanted was to engage in a head-on confrontation with an opponent. By making the spirit sword invisible, as long as he could gain the upper hand, he could kill the enemy before they even noticed him. It was perfect for him.

After returning to the cave, Qin Sang immediately closed it and seized the time to refine the Fiery Raven Talisman. The Fiery Raven Essence in the talisman was powerful. Thoroughly subduing it would require some effort. Ten days was a bit tight.

...

Ten days later.

Streams of light occasionally landed on the small island.

By the time Qin Sang arrived, most people had already arrived. After waiting for a while, a rather young man arrived on his sword. The young man's face was cold and stern, and his demeanor was similar to Jianwen's. He seemed to be a pure sword cultivator.

"This is Junior Brother Li Zai," Qingting introduced him to everyone.

At this moment, all eight people who had agreed to go were present. The Liu brothers, who had worried them the most, had also successfully subdued the Fiery Raven Essence.

Yu Daiyue flicked out a cloud of mist that floated into the air. He looked around at the crowd and said, "This cloud is my flying magic treasure. Since you have all agreed to follow Senior Sister Qingting and me, I will activate the magic treasure's restriction during the flight. You will not be able to see outside, and you must not use your divine sense to probe. We will release you when we reach the ancient cultivator's ruins."

Everyone hesitated upon hearing this, but they had already agreed and could not go back on their word. Moreover, they knew that this was Qingting and Yu Daiyue's way of being cautious. They agreed and followed Qingting into the White Cloud Magic Treasure.

The White Cloud Magic Treasure trembled slightly, and the clouds vanished into thin air. Then, it floated up into the sky and sped away.

The White Cloud Magic Treasure's speed was not very fast, and Qingting and Yu Daiyue took turns controlling it.

Qin Sang looked around. He was surrounded by thick clouds, blocking his view. He could not use his divine sense to probe. Since he was already here, he decided to take the opportunity to cultivate.

The flight lasted for two months.

The flying magic weapon suddenly shook while flying smoothly. Then its speed decreased sharply. Many cultivators in the magic weapon realized something had happened and woke up from their meditation. They looked towards two people in the front.

Qingting turned around and nodded, saying, “We’ll soon arrive at the ancient repair ruins. However, it’s also not peaceful. Everyone, take precautions.”

Before she finished speaking, the magic weapon immediately fell downwards. Soon it vanished into nothingness. Yu Daiyue put it away, and everyone regained their vision.

Qin Sang landed on solid ground and looked around carefully. Then he found that they didn’t land on an island but the top of a mountain. As far as he could see, there were towering mountains everywhere, standing high and reaching the clouds. It seemed there were more and huger mountains in the east like an iron screen.

The mountains were covered by dense primeval forests, where roars of wild beasts and songs of birds never ceased. There was no sign of human activities. No ordinary people could live in such a dangerous jungle.

It was noon at that time, but the sunlight was blocked by fog and smog in the mountains. The mountain wind was howling, making one feel cold to the bone. Therefore, the place was very gloomy.

How large should a place be for these majestic mountains?

Just when Qin Sang was surprised, he saw Baiyushanren’s face looking very bad. He questioned Yu Daiyue in a stern voice, “Didn’t you two say the ancient repair ruins were in the Great Swamp of Yunyun Cang? Why did you bring us here? Do you think we are all senile and can’t tell the difference between Mount Tian and the Great Swamp of Yunyun Cang?”

Mount Tian!

Qin Sang was slightly moved. No wonder the place was so desolate.

Mount Tian and the Great Swamp of Yunyun Cang were in the east and south, respectively. One was a high mountain range while the other was a wide water area. These two dangerous places were the border of Xiaohan Domain.

Such natural dangers could certainly not deter cultivators, especially high-level cultivators above the Golden Core Period.

But these two places were agreed to be the border between the immortal cultivation sects of Xiaohan Domain and the immortal cultivation world of other domains. Cultivators of each side could come and go freely but could not cross the border on a large scale.

There had been many huge battles previously.

Once another domain planned to invade Xiaohan Domain, the orthodox and heterodox cultivators would put aside their old grudges and unite. Even the Wicked Beast Plain in the west could not escape. The whole immortal cultivation world would get together to defend against foreign enemies and drive the invaders away.

At the most dangerous time, the orthodox and heterodox cultivators joined forces and monsters were willing to be driven by humans. Xiaohan Domain was unprecedentedly united.
