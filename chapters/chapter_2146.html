<h1>Chapter 2136 The New King</h1><p>The jade pendant was smooth and round, without any markings. Qin Sang held it, sensing a subtle vibration.  According to the Yuanxiang clan leader, using the Zhuyan clan's large teleportation array would lead to the southern part of the Mist Sea.  Once there, activating the pendant would provide guidance.</p><p>The Yuanxiang clan leader remained tight-lipped about the visitor's identity, unsure if it was a cultivator from Purple Cloud Mountain or even Master Liuli herself. Liuli should have returned before the ebb of the Vile River, but it seems she's encountered some problem that prevents her from leaving. She must have sent someone else to help the Storm Realm in their fight for the Green Spirit Qi.</p><p>The Green Spirit Qi is too important to both sides. Without Qin Sang's unexpected intervention, the amount of Green Spirit Qi secured would affect the next hundred years. Liuli still cares about this matter, so she shouldn't be in mortal danger, though what's keeping her is unknown.</p><p>“Thank you, Clan Leader Yuanxiang, for relaying the message,” Qin Sang put away the pendant and bowed in thanks, without mentioning when he would depart.</p><p>Yuanxiang didn't press further, took a sip of wine, and rode his cloud westward.</p><p>Qin Sang returned to his cave dwelling.  While Purple Cloud Mountain hadn't set a time limit for his visit, it was still best to leave as soon as possible.  He considered what needed to be done before his departure; two things were crucial: consolidating his insights from the recent battle, and helping Silu reclaim the Hanjiang Lu Manor and ascend to the position of Yan King.</p><p>Just as he was contemplating, Li Yu Fu activated the cave dwelling's protective formation, coming to report on the outcome of the negotiations with Clan Leader Minshu.</p><p>From then on, the border of Shengmu Plain would serve as the boundary between the two sides. The Changyou clan would withdraw all its people to Shengmu Plain and the southwestern sea area; the rest would belong to the Storm Realm.</p><p>Numerous other treasures were also acquired.  All the ancient texts Qin Sang requested were among them. This was all expected. Qin Sang left this matter to Li Yu Fu, and after spending several days in seclusion, he personally went to the Siyou clan.</p><p>…</p><p>Siyou Clan.</p><p>Hanjiang Lu Manor.</p><p>The Lu King led his army on a campaign, leaving the Manor unguarded. However, the once-powerful Si family of Yanshan, destroyed by the Lu family, and their formidable Grand Protector, were enough to deter prying eyes.</p><p>But recently, the atmosphere had become strangely tense. Overnight, rumors harmful to the Lu family spread, and many unfamiliar faces appeared around the Manor.</p><p>Rumors ran rampant, causing increasing pressure on the Manor, and various forces became restless. The Imperial Family remained strangely silent, with the Si Emperor secluded and inactive.</p><p>Just as people were trying to discern the truth from the rumors, and the Lu Manor cultivators were living in fear, the truth finally came to light.</p><p>Silu, leading the remnants of the Lu King's army, returned in triumph, shocking everyone and sending ripples through the Siyou clan.</p><p>No one could have imagined that the Lu King, having led his entire army to attack a small band of Yan King's remnants, suffered a crushing defeat.  When news of the Lu King's and the Grand Protector's deaths spread, it shocked everyone, leaving them disbelieving.</p><p>Silu led his army, openly advancing towards the Hanjiang Lu Manor.</p><p>On a magical vessel, Silu stood at the bow, with Su Nu by his side, and a Vermilion Bird dozing on her shoulder.</p><p>At that moment, Shi Mu flew back from the front and reported, “Someone is blocking our way ahead, claiming to be former retainers of the Yan King, requesting an audience with the Young Master!”</p><p>Silu gazed ahead, his expression shifting slightly, saying, "Bring them here."</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>Shi Mu went to fetch them, quickly returning with three individuals.</p><p>One was old and frail, another young, like a grandfather and grandson; the last wore a hat that was a spiritual treasure, shielding their face and appearing shrouded in mist.</p><p>Silu stared intently at the person in the hat, his expression subtly changing.</p><p>The person gently removed the hat, revealing a beautiful woman in court attire, her eyes filled with a gentle, affectionate look of relief and love towards Silu.</p><p>“Aunt!”</p><p>Silu exclaimed, moved beyond words, “You’re still alive!”</p><p>The Yan King's offspring were all born of Yin-Yang unions.  He had several concubines during his lifetime; Silu's mother had passed away early, but this aunt was Concubine Qi, the closest to Silu.</p><p>During the chaos, Summer Attendant could only take Silu, and they had assumed all the Yan King's concubines were killed.</p><p>Concubine Qi, looking just like an ordinary woman, couldn't help but shed tears, “Lu, you suffered so much these years. The King's spirit in heaven can finally rest in peace!”</p><p>“Your humble servant greets the Young Master!”</p><p>The old man prostrated himself, also weeping, “Your humble servant has failed the King's trust, unable to avenge him, only surviving to witness our enemy's triumph.  I am unworthy of living!”</p><p>The young man was more composed, reminding, “Grand Marshal, you should address the Young Master as King!”</p><p>After exchanging stories, Silu learned of their experiences, filled with emotion.</p><p>They had refused to surrender to the Lu King years ago, secretly rallying the remnants of the Yan King's forces.  They faced countless assassination attempts, surviving only because the Imperial family didn't want the Lu King to become too powerful.  An Imperial edict gave them a reprieve.</p><p>Thanks to their clandestine efforts, a portion of the Yan King's forces were preserved, preventing the complete collapse of morale.</p><p>After the Lu King's army marched, they learned its target was Silu.  They wanted to help but were under constant surveillance by Imperial masters, preventing any action. Only after the Imperial envoy returned did the surveillance end.</p><p>Now that they have joined forces with Silu, Silu welcomes them wholeheartedly.</p><p>With the return of Lady Qi and others, Silu's strength grew significantly. The army continued its advance, with more of the Yan King's former troops joining along the way.</p><p>These individuals weren't necessarily loyal to the Yan King. After the decline of the Si family of Yanshan, they each led their own forces, establishing their own territories. They had previously ignored Lady Qi and others, but hadn't actively harmed them either. Silu, recognizing that "still waters run deep," didn't shut them out.</p><p>The army quickly entered Lu territory. Silu ordered a three-pronged attack to sweep away Lu forces and prevent the escape of any remnants.</p><p>The advance was swift and decisive; the enemy surrendered readily, facing almost no significant resistance. The three columns successfully converged at the Lu Mansion in Hanjiang.</p><p>The Lu Mansion was surrounded on three sides, throwing it into turmoil.</p><p>Built along the Hanjiang River, the Mansion extended across both banks, surrounded by majestic mountain ranges resembling dragons.  The landscape was breathtaking, with mountains, rivers, and lakes all incorporated into the estate.</p><p>Now, the Mansion's protective array was at full power. A crimson banner, stretching for miles, rose from the river surface and billowed above the mansion, its fabric flowing like water in the wind, obscuring the estate.</p><p>This banner was the protective array itself. The soldiers sensed the array's power, and it didn't appear weak, indicating the Lu family cultivators hadn't abandoned the mansion.</p><p>With its remaining forces, the Lu Mansion couldn't withstand Silu's army, yet they waited.</p><p>"My Lord, should we order an attack on the array now?"</p><p>The Grand Marshal asked, clearly concerned.  Silu, not yet officially crowned, was still addressed as "My Lord."</p><p>"Not yet."</p><p>Silu shook his head, calculating the timing. He wanted to wait for Qin Sang to arrive, using this battle to establish his authority.</p><p>"Order Shimu and others to select some descendants of Lu's vassal clans and bring them to the front lines to urge surrender!"</p><p>The Grand Marshal's eyes lit up.</p><p>Many of the elite soldiers from Lu's vassal clans had been captured. This was a strategic move designed to break their morale. Faced with overwhelming odds,  it remained to be seen how many would choose to share the fate of the Lu Mansion.</p><p>At this time, various factions within the Siyou clan watched the battle unfold. The other two great clans were also restless. Surprisingly, the battlefield remained strangely calm for many days, with no sign of fighting.</p><p>...</p><p>Outside the Lu Mansion.</p><p>On a mountaintop stood the Imperial Envoy, hands behind his back.</p><p>Behind him, a dozen or so soldiers in silver armor stood silently. Their restrained killing intent was unmistakable; these were the Imperial Silver Guards, elite warriors known throughout the Siyou clan.</p><p>They watched the Lu Mansion intently.</p><p>After a while, a shadowy figure materialized before the Envoy—another Silver Guard. He bowed and reported,  "My Lord Envoy, the Lu Mansion has sent another petition."</p><p>The Envoy showed no surprise.  "What does it say?"</p><p>"It’s mostly the same as before. They agree to all conditions, but with one exception: they claim to have searched the entire Mansion and cannot find the Mirage Tower," the Silver Guard reported.</p><p>The Envoy frowned. "So the Mirage Tower was with the Lu King, and now it's in someone else's hands. What a pity."</p><p>After a moment's thought, the Envoy said, "Tell the Lu Mansion they have one day. Choose some people, and send them out along with those things. I will send them to safety."</p><p>The Silver Guard was inwardly shocked. He understood that this was a death sentence for the Lu Mansion, leaving only a few bloodlines.  How laughable that the Lu Mansion still imagined the Imperial family would help them drive away their enemies.</p><p>"Yes, My Lord."</p><p>The Silver Guard left.</p><p>Then, a Silver Guard who appeared to be a commander stepped forward. "It seems the Four Kings will become history."</p><p>The Envoy shook his head slightly. "Not necessarily! The Emperor originally intended to support the Si family of Wutan, allying them with the other two families against the Lu family.  If the new Yan King becomes too powerful, they may need to reinstate the Si family of Wutan."</p><p>"That Qin Zhenren is so powerful, I doubt the other two families combined would be a match for him," said the Silver Guard commander.</p><p>The four-king structure of the Siyou clan was most favorable to the Imperial family; it balanced power and enabled mutual restraint.</p><p>Previously, the strongest, the Si family of Yanshan and the Lu family of Hanjiang were locked in conflict, while the other two families checked each other.  Now, that balance has been shattered, and a new equilibrium must be found.</p><p>"It's a foreigner after all. Let's wait and see," the Shao Shi said confidently.</p><p>In his view, the biggest winner in this turmoil was actually the Imperial Family. The Yan Shan Si family and the Han Jiang Lu family fought each other to a standstill, with Xia Changshi and the Grand Protector, two top experts who posed the greatest threat to the Imperial Family, both perishing.</p><p>Now, Si Lu seems to be at the height of his power, but he is backed by a foreigner.  </p><p>Leaving aside his ignominious retreat from the battlefield, it's been a perfect outcome for him.</p><p>After a period of calm on the battlefield, Qin Sang finally arrived, much to everyone's anticipation.</p><p>Qin Sang and Si Lu appeared high in the air, overlooking the banners above the Lu Mansion.</p><p>Suddenly, Qin Sang seemed to sense something and glanced towards the edge of the battlefield, quickly returning his gaze.</p><p>The Silver Guard leader's eyes narrowed. "He's discovered us?"</p><p>"This Qin Zhenren's spiritual perception is exceptionally sharp.  The Lu King's defeat is partly due to this," the Shao Shi said without surprise.</p><p>After observing for a long time, Qin Sang noticed something.</p><p>"Although there are powerful cultivators directing the formation, the power of the array is weak and reveals many weaknesses. Perhaps your previous strategy worked. The Lu Mansion cultivators are in disarray, and their hearts are susceptible…"</p><p>After some thought, Qin Sang pointed out several locations and ordered Shi Mu and others to lead the army to attack.</p><p>The battlefield exploded into action. Si Lu's side launched a fierce attack in the initial battle, their momentum overwhelming. Beams of spiritual light rained down, covering the sky and earth, instantly engulfing the banners.</p><p>The earth trembled, and the wind and clouds changed color.</p><p>Occasionally, banners could be seen through the gaps in the spiritual light, looking unusually flimsy and precarious.</p><p>Except for Qin Sang and Si Lu who remained at the center, everyone else joined the battle.</p><p>Soon after the engagement began, the earlier efforts to persuade cultivators to surrender bore fruit.  Cultivators continuously fled the Lu Mansion and defected, and even through the great array, the chaos within the mansion was palpable.</p><p>Qin Sang keenly sensed the change in the banners. The Lu Mansion's array, much like the Thunder Altar, required the concerted effort of other cultivators to assist the main array master. Now that the Lu Mansion's hearts were scattered, its power was greatly diminished.</p><p>The only ones likely to remain steadfast are probably the Lu family's blood descendants.</p><p>In the face of the overwhelming tide, using force to establish dominance could not change the overall situation.  Not long after the battle began, the banners began to ripple.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes flashed. He rose into the air, his mind connected to the Thunder Altar, and pointed towards the heavens.</p><p>"Rumbling!"</p><p>Heavenly blue thunder appeared, with countless thunderbolts surging.</p><p>The thunder gathered, and in the center of the dazzling light, a thunder seal appeared, its power overwhelming!</p><p>"What kind of thunder technique is this?" Shock flashed across the Silver Guard leader's eyes.</p><p>The Shao Shi's expression was grave. He thought that while this thunder technique was powerful, the most shocking thing was the blue thunder paper, which was the reason he had strongly advocated against confronting them before the Imperial Lord.</p><p>Elsewhere, the spies sent by various factions were equally astonished, staring blankly at the thunder seal in the sky, their hearts filled with fear.</p><p>"Boom!"</p><p>The blue thunder descended, striking the banners.</p><p>A terrifying power erupted. Simultaneously, Su Nu and the others received Si Lu's orders and attacked with all their might.</p><p>The thunder echoed through the heavens and earth.</p><p>The Han Jiang River rose in tumultuous waves, the mountains seemed to crumble, and a layer of blue light enveloped the banners, obscuring their original color.</p><p>"Rumbling…"</p><p>The power of the thunder continued to explode, and the banners finally couldn't withstand it, collapsing on one side.  This seemed to be a signal, as countless cracks suddenly appeared on the surface of the banners. Before the despairing eyes of the Lu Mansion cultivators, the outer mansion began to collapse.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced down, then left the battlefield and flew towards the mountain peak where the Shao Shi was located.</p><p>"Qin Zhenren!" The Shao Shi bowed slightly.</p><p>"The situation was chaotic earlier, and I didn't have a chance to speak with you in detail, Shao Shi. Please forgive me," Qin Sang landed, returning the bow with a smile.</p><p>Hearing Qin Sang mention the past, the Shao Shi's expression remained unchanged. "It's been many days, but Qin Zhenren's power remains undiminished. You will certainly be able to help Young Master Si Lu restore the Yan Shan Si family."</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at the battlefield and said calmly, "I previously promised to help Daoist Friend Si Lu avenge his family. Now that revenge is taken, I have my own cultivation ground and cannot stay long."</p><p>"Oh?"</p><p>The Shao Shi's eyes flashed. This was undoubtedly the best outcome.</p><p>As long as this Qin Zhenren knew when to advance and retreat, the Imperial Family might be able to become friends with him.</p><p>Thinking of this, the Shao Shi's expression softened, and he smiled. "Even if Qin Zhenren leaves, no one will dare to provoke the Yan King. I almost forgot to mention that before departing, the Imperial Lord ordered me to bring a golden book and jade seal, officially appointing Young Master Si Lu as the new Yan King!"</p><p>Following this, the two talked amicably.</p><p>The Shao Shi seemed to have just remembered something and asked, "I wonder if Zhenren found the Mirage Tower among the Lu King's belongings?"</p><p>"The Mirage Tower, such a treasure, isn't it stored in the Lu Mansion? My cultivation ground has been ravaged by war, and I'm busy with many things. I haven't had time to check, I'm afraid," Qin Sang said with a smile.</p>
