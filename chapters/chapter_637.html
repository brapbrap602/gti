<h1>Chapter 629: Refining with Infernal Fire (Extra chapter for Patreons!)</h1><p>Not all souls retain remnants of sentience.  The soul-refining demonic artifacts Qin Sang had previously found in the ancient cultivator's estate had long since lost their spiritual essence.</p><p>The ghost banners seized from the Kuiyin Sect remnants, however, were recently imbued with souls taken from freshly killed victims, thus preserving a trace of their spiritual essence.</p><p>Ultimately, Qin Sang released the souls that still possessed sentience, extracting the pure soul energy from the remaining ghost banners and refining it into threads to repair his treasures.</p><p>Three Ten Directions Yama Banners floated in mid-air, forming a banner formation, slowly rotating before Qin Sang.</p><p>In the center of the formation, black infernal fire coalesced into a single mass.</p><p>The array of three banners amplified the power of the Nine Nether Infernal Fire far beyond a simple multiplicative effect, achieving a power comparable to that of a mid-grade magic treasure—no exaggeration.</p><p>But this also demanded a higher level of cultivation from the wielder!</p><p>Although originating from the same banner array and intimately connected, controlling them didn't require divided attention. Yet, simultaneously wielding three magic treasures still placed a significant burden on the cultivator.</p><p>When unleashing the Nine Nether Infernal Fire against enemies, the consumption of True Qi was incredibly rapid, demanding extremely high levels of spiritual awareness.</p><p>Qin Sang had corpse pills as external support, extending the duration he could sustain his True Qi.</p><p>However, due to insufficient cultivation and weak spiritual sense, he still found it extremely taxing.</p><p>Qin Sang attempted to activate the banner array.  The Nine Nether Infernal Fire transformed into a fire dragon, roaring out from the array, only to abruptly burst with a 'pop,' scattering infernal fire that filled the entire cave dwelling.</p><p>The banners trembled violently.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression changed slightly, and he quickly retracted the Nine Nether Infernal Fire.</p><p>"Several attempts have failed. I must practice diligently and master this banner formation soon. After all, it will be my trump card for a long time to come,"</p><p>Qin Sang muttered.</p><p>Then, he stored two of the Ten Directions Yama Banners into his Qianjun Ring and retrieved the corpse of the original owner of this cave dwelling, a black-winged eagle.</p><p>This was a mid-stage Spirit Transformation stage great demon, its iron feathers still exuding an untamed aura even in death.</p><p>Demon beast corpses can be used to refine magic artifacts.</p><p>For Qin Sang, the black-winged eagle's cultivation was too low; even if refined into a magic artifact, it wouldn't be of much use.  Qin Sang planned to use this demonic corpse to refine Soul Devouring Cones.</p><p>The Soul Devouring Cones were given to him by Master Wu at the Moonlit Pavilion Market.  They are disposable magic artifacts incredibly effective during the early Foundation Establishment stage but become increasingly less useful with rising cultivation.</p><p>Qin Sang rarely refined them anymore.</p><p>With the black-winged eagle's corpse, if the refining technique is properly applied, he should be able to obtain two Soul Devouring Cones.</p><p>Qin Sang kept one Ten Directions Yama Banner; firstly, to experiment with using the Nine Nether Infernal Fire for refining, and secondly, to create Soul Devouring Cones for the mute girl for self-defense.</p><p>This was predicated on her possessing spiritual roots and being capable of cultivation.</p><p>Two Soul Devouring Cones would be enough to ensure the mute girl's safety before the Foundation Establishment stage, a small repayment for saving his life.</p><p>The Nine Nether Infernal Fire floated out from the Ten Directions Yama Banner, hovering before Qin Sang. Under his control, it constantly shifted, gathering and dispersing before finally coalescing into a single mass.</p><p>Qin Sang closed his eyes slightly, sensing the flame's aura, and attempted to manipulate the infernal fire using refining techniques.</p><p>The Nine Nether Infernal Fire was a rare and unique flame. If it could be used for refining, it would be far more efficient than a pill fire, increasing the success rate of refinement—a significant advantage other refiners lacked.</p><p>With the Flying Night Rakshasa guarding the entrance, Qin Sang could focus on sensing the Nine Nether Infernal Fire.</p><p>Unknowingly, a whole night passed.</p><p>At dawn, Qin Sang suddenly opened his eyes, his gaze falling on the demonic corpse nearby. With a wave of his hand, his True Qi formed a claw, seizing the corpse and throwing it into the Nine Nether Infernal Fire.</p><p>The infernal fire stirred, then gradually calmed.</p><p>Qin Sang stared intently at the demonic corpse within the infernal fire, his expression tense.  Then he saw the black-winged eagle's iron feathers melting one by one, seemingly consumed by the Nine Nether Infernal Fire, ultimately leaving behind only two drops of pitch-black iron liquid.</p><p>Within the iron liquid, an extremely violent demonic energy was contained, yet firmly sealed by the Nine Nether Infernal Fire.</p><p>Qin Sang relaxed, a smile curving his lips.  The formation of these two drops of iron liquid indicated the success of his prediction—he could indeed use the power of the Nine Nether Infernal Fire for refining.</p><p>Without hesitation, Qin Sang boldly continued refining the demonic corpse.</p><p>Soon, the enormous demonic corpse was completely incinerated by the demonic fire.  Two palm-sized black horns appeared in the flames, shaped like the beak of a black-winged eagle.</p><p>Each horn tip was pierced by a slender needle forged from the venomous fang of a black dragon, imbued with potent dragon venom.</p><p>Qin Sang had slain the black dragon in Wuyagu Valley and preserved its corpse, unsure what to craft with it.</p><p>It was a peak Spirit Transformation stage black dragon, incredibly rare in Xiaohan Region, a precious material for refining artifacts.  However, it seemed less valuable in the Canglang Sea.</p><p>Rumor had it that in the Stormy Demon Sea, Demon Core stage great demons frequently appeared, with countless Spirit Transformation stage demonic beasts.</p><p>Qin Sang was already planning a trip to the Stormy Sea after finishing his current tasks, to gather the dragon essence needed for the Nine Dragon Heavenly Chariot Talisman, significantly boosting his survival capabilities.</p><p>The Nine Dragon Heavenly Chariot Talisman is one of the four secret talismans of the Taishang Qingjing Palace.  Once the dragon essence is complete, its incredible speed is a treasure coveted by all Nascent Soul stage cultivators.</p><p>Unfortunately, demonic beasts are scarce in Xiaohan Region; even Daoist Xuan Yu never managed to collect nine dragon essences in his lifetime.</p><p>The Devouring Yuan Cone is complete.</p><p>Qin Sang put away the Ten Directions Yanluo Banner and other items, storing the Flying Night Rakshasa in his corpse puppet bag before leaving the cave and flying towards Qianhu Village.</p><p>‘Quick!’</p><p>Across the wild mountains and fields,</p><p>a sword's hum echoed like thunder, shaking the mountains and wilderness.</p><p>Two streaks of light, like meteors, raced towards each other from afar.</p><p>Moments later, one light vanished.  The remaining light stopped, revealing its form: a breathtakingly beautiful flying sword.</p><p>A figure materialized, capturing the sword.</p><p>Qin Sang looked down at the ebony sword, recalling the process of the sword light splitting.</p><p>After reaching the Nascent Soul stage, his  《Yuan Shen Yang Jian Zhang》 cultivation advanced past the fifth stage, allowing Qin Sang to use the sword light splitting ability.</p><p>Sword light splitting is a far more profound ability than sword energy thunder, a swordsmanship realm countless sword cultivators dream of achieving.</p><p>The split sword images are almost indistinguishable from the real thing, inheriting part of the original sword’s power, making it impossible for opponents to defend against.</p><p>Qin Sang had consulted ancient texts, noting records of some sword cultivators capable of splitting their sword light into multiple images.  Even stronger cultivators could harness sword intent to create powerful sword formations.</p><p>One sword forming an array, daring to be called a match for ten thousand enemies!</p><p>That is a true sword cultivator.</p><p>However, the cultivation technique's innate ability only creates one split sword light. Only through independent comprehension can Qin Sang possibly reach that level.</p><p>Qin Sang suspected that the original technique would produce more split sword lights with increased cultivation.  He didn't know if Senior Qingzhu's self-created technique would enhance this ability.</p><p>His current priority is mastering the sword light splitting technique.</p><p>—</p><p>—</p><p>Happy Children's Day!
