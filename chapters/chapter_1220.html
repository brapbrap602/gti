<h1>Chapter 1212: The Divine Light Reappear</h1><p>Qin Sang hadn't yet clashed with Ye Laomo, but judging by the Serpent King's expression, it seemed true.</p><p>The Ye Laomo who emerged from the Blood Lake possessed an aura even stronger than the Serpent King's, his cultivation beyond doubt—a top expert at the peak of mid-Yuan Ying stage.</p><p>Ye Laomo felt even more dangerous to Qin Sang than the three grand alliance masters he'd encountered before the inner hall of the Seven Slaughter Pavilion.</p><p>It was unclear whether the Ye Laomo at the front lines had secretly returned, or if there were actually two Ye Laomos.</p><p>“A physical manifestation? A second primordial spirit? Or some other similar secret technique?”</p><p>Qin Sang's thoughts raced.</p><p>If Ye Laomo possessed an equally powerful manifestation, this person would be the undisputed number one expert in the Northern Star Realm.</p><p>Qin Sang had intervened to seize the treasure only after confirming it was safe, but unexpectedly, just as he was about to escape, a formidable enemy appeared, blocking his path.</p><p>It was unknown why Ye Laomo was hiding in the Blood Lake; the Sky Eye Butterfly hadn't detected any abnormalities there.</p><p>Qin Sang could only be thankful that he hadn't hesitated before acting; his strike was as swift as thunder.</p><p>Ye Laomo probably hadn't expected a sudden uninvited guest to disrupt their plans.</p><p>Otherwise, if Ye Laomo had been aware and had prepared a trap, luring Qin Sang into an ambush, his situation would have been far more perilous.</p><p>Taken completely by surprise, Qin Sang and the Serpent King watched helplessly as the Lu-surname cultivator and the Ice Lizard were swallowed by the blood.</p><p>‘Whoosh…’</p><p>The source of the blood wasn’t the Blood Lake; it seemed to surge from the void, instantly forming a crimson river, completely cutting off their escape route.</p><p>Faced with the turbulent waves, Qin Sang and the Serpent King were secretly startled, feeling a sense of foreboding.</p><p>After the Ice Lizard and the Lu-surname cultivator were swallowed, there was no reaction from them, seemingly powerless; their current state was unknown.</p><p>Did Ye Laomo truly possess such terrifying power, capable of instantly killing a transformed demon king and a mid-Yuan Ying expert?</p><p>Compared to the Serpent King, Qin Sang felt even greater pressure.</p><p>A malicious wind struck from behind, an evil spirit close at hand.</p><p>After Ye Laomo appeared, he first unleashed a blood river, then his gaze shifted to Qin Sang, his eyes icy, clearly targeting him as well.</p><p>It was all Qin Sang's fault; his earlier performance had been too dazzling.  He’d snatched a treasure from within an evil spirit right under everyone's noses and escaped unscathed.</p><p>The Sin Abyss cultivators feared him even more than they feared the Serpent King.</p><p>If this continued, Qin Sang would soon be caught in a pincer attack, facing enemies far stronger than himself. How could he escape from this predicament?</p><p>Simultaneously with Ye Laomo's appearance, Jiang Chenzi and the other two spread out in coordination, encircling Qin Sang and the Serpent King.  They unleashed pre-prepared hand seals, fully activating the treasure banners.</p><p>Three treasure banners pierced the air, their auras interconnected, linked to the blood below.</p><p>The banner formation's power generated blood mist, continuously flowing into the blood river and surroundings. A crimson veil instantly shrouded the void.</p><p>Their ambitions were immense; they not only aimed to completely subdue the Lu-surname cultivator and the Ice Lizard with Ye Laomo’s cooperation, sealing the exit, but also to lock down the space, preventing Qin Sang and the Serpent King from escaping in other directions.</p><p>The situation changed in an instant.</p><p>Qin Sang, struggling to dodge the pursuing evil spirits, saw this and knew that once the opponents' spirit formation was complete, both he and the Serpent King would be trapped here, facing almost certain death.</p><p>Within the blood river, the Ice Lizard and the Lu-surname cultivator remained motionless, their condition unclear.</p><p>This route was definitely impassable.</p><p>Looking at the blood river, Qin Sang felt a shiver run down his spine.  Uncertain of the river's nature, he didn't want to recklessly charge in, using his life to test Ye Laomo's strength.</p><p>Always decisive, Qin Sang immediately merged with his sword, changed direction, and lunged towards Jiang Chenzi.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang rushing towards him, Jiang Chenzi showed no sign of panic, a sneer playing on his lips.  His consciousness instantly communicated with his two companions.</p><p>The three treasure banners rotated, aiming at Qin Sang, the formation's power shifting in this direction.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The ebony sword shone brilliantly, attacking again.</p><p>The sword light pierced the blood mist, targeting Jiang Chenzi.</p><p>Jiang Chenzi's eyes narrowed; only when directly facing the sword did he realize its extraordinary nature, a top performer even among top-grade artifacts.  Sheltering behind the treasure banners, outside the formation, even he felt a faint stinging sensation after being locked on.</p><p>Thick blood mist surged forward, suppressing the ebony sword.</p><p>The sword light was forced to shrink; the ebony sword seemed to be restrained.</p><p>At that moment, the ebony sword vanished, the Seven Souls Killing Array reappearing!</p><p>Qin Sang held nothing back; the ebony sword, wielding the might of the sword array, tore through the blood mist, swiftly advancing.</p><p>However, they were facing three Yuan Ying experts; the ebony sword alone was insufficient.  Qin Sang had only recently formed his golden core; even the powerful Seven Souls Killing Array had its limits.</p><p>Twelve demonic banners constantly circled Qin Sang, while the Nine Netherworld Demon Fire spread behind him.  He appeared like a devil emerging from the inferno, leaving a trail of black flames.</p><p>Behind him, a tortoise shell floated, emitting a rhythmic *thump-thump* sound and radiating a gentle, protective玄水 energy, like a giant shield.</p><p>This was a desperate measure. Qin Sang could only barely protect himself from the evil spirits' attacks by relying on the Nine Netherworld Demon Fire and the Nine-Lives Xuanwu Shell.  He couldn't spare either.</p><p>Seeing the Blackwood Sword stalled, Qin Sang was about to unleash the 《Thunder Summoning Technique》, using all his remaining power, when a shockingly swift blade of light slashed from his side!</p><p>"The Serpent King has finally made his move!"</p><p>Qin Sang breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p>Earlier, while making his decision, Qin Sang had secretly contacted the Serpent King, explaining the impasse and revealing an alternative escape route.</p><p>However, he wasn't certain what the Serpent King would choose.  After all, the Serpent King and the Lu cultivator had come treasure hunting together, and their trust in each other was undoubtedly stronger.  Furthermore, the exit was directly below, and breaking through the Blood River blockade would secure their escape.</p><p>Fortunately, the Serpent King ultimately chose to believe him.</p><p>The black blade followed the Blackwood Sword, aiming for Jiang Chenzi.</p><p>The black blade's momentum was in no way inferior to the Blackwood Sword's.  A hundred-zhang-long blade-light resembled a spatial rift. The relaxed expression on Jiang Chenzi's face vanished, replaced by grim determination.</p><p>Three sacred banners, their divine patterns intertwined, spewed forth endless blood, solidifying into barriers.</p><p>The Blackwood Sword and the black blade, side-by-side, cleaved through the barriers.  However, they were rapidly depleting their own energy.  Just as they were about to break through the blockade and strike Jiang Chenzi, they were exhausted.</p><p>A smile returned to Jiang Chenzi's face.  He was about to activate the spirit array to repel them when he suddenly froze.</p><p>The Blackwood Sword, its blade dulled, flickered, instantly spraying a beam of blood-red light.</p><p>They were all too familiar with this light.</p><p>The Blood Profane Radiance!</p><p>Elder Ye, aiming for a decisive victory, had exhausted all means to find the boundless Blood Mulberry, barely gathering enough for the Profane Blood Array.  His efforts weren't in vain; it instantly destroyed most of the two realms' cultivators' treasures within the Purple Micro Palace.</p><p>Unfortunately, somehow the news leaked.  Despite destroying so many precious spirit woods, the surprise attack was only moderately successful, leading to a protracted conflict spanning centuries.</p><p>“Using their own methods against them…”</p><p>A sudden thought struck Jiang Chenzi.</p>
