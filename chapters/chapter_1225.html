<h1>Chapter 1217: Further Discussion of the Marriage Alliance</h1><p>Outside the city, the yellow sand turned to quicksand, and the Snake King emerged from the depths of the sand sea.</p><p>“Have Daoist Lu and Daoist Hanli arrived yet?”</p><p>Qin Sang glanced around, noticing only the Snake King.</p><p>The Snake King nodded, somewhat worriedly saying, “I only arrived a short while ago, and I have no news of the two Daoists.  When they charged out, they must have encountered further obstacles…”</p><p>“The combined secret technique Daoist Hanxi and Daoist Lu used at the last moment was extraordinary. If their goal was simply survival, it shouldn't have been difficult.”</p><p>Qin Sang recalled the aura Hanli displayed at the last moment, and the powerful energy released by the snow pearl, as if the two cultivators' power had been concentrated into one.</p><p>If it were him, he would have had to evade their attack, just like Elder Ye.</p><p>The Snake King, hearing the apprehension in Qin Sang's tone, relaxed slightly, and smiled.  “Mingyue, do you know why Daoist Hanxi and Daoist Lu were able to merge their cultivation bases?  Actually, Daoist Hanli was formerly Daoist Lu's spirit beast. They spent many years together, and had already mastered several combined attack techniques.  However, Daoist Lu was seriously injured and unable to use them; otherwise, the situation wouldn't have been so dire.  They only resorted to it at the last moment, and both Daoists must have paid a heavy price…”</p><p>“Daoist Hanxi was a spirit beast?”</p><p>Qin Sang was astonished. He truly hadn't noticed.</p><p>“That was a long time ago. Daoist Lu is easygoing. After Daoist Hanli transformed, he voluntarily released Daoist Hanli from his servitude and treated him as an equal. In fact, Daoist Lu even actively helped him find the opportunity to transform. Therefore, not only did Daoist Hanxi harbor no resentment for being enslaved, but he is deeply grateful to Daoist Lu. If the situation was dire, Daoist Hanxi would certainly risk his life to get Daoist Lu out…”</p><p>The Snake King recounted this hidden past.</p><p>As a member of the Yao race, it deeply hated the human race's enslavement of spirit beasts, yet its words expressed great admiration for the Lu cultivator.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't help but feel admiration as well.</p><p>Back then, the Lu cultivator was only at the early Yuan Ying stage, yet possessed a transformed spirit beast, doubling his strength. And he willingly let the beast go.</p><p>It's worth noting that Hanli had been captured by the Lu cultivator during his Foundation Establishment stage, and held no ill will toward him.</p><p>Qin Sang doubted he could have done the same.</p><p>Such detachment from worldly concerns... no wonder the Lu cultivator was able to break through to the mid-Yuan Ying stage and become one of the top experts in the Bei Chen region.</p><p>“Let's wait a little longer.”</p><p>Qin Sang also wanted to meet this Daoist Lu. He looked at the Snake King, “Your injuries…”</p><p>The Snake King chuckled bitterly, “I'm afraid I'll need decades of quiet recuperation to recover. I hope Daoist Lu and the others brought back that scale; otherwise, this will have been a huge loss.”</p><p>Qin Sang then learned of their experiences from the Snake King.</p><p>After finding the entrance to the ancient great demon's cave, they spent enormous effort painstakingly cracking the ancient prohibitions.  Just as the Lu cultivator obtained a snake scale recording secret techniques and an ancient treasure, they were ambushed by a snake spirit, alarming Jiang Chenzi and others in the Blood Lake, leading to a great calamity.</p><p>“Snake King, what are your thoughts on Elder Ye and the Blood Lake?” Qin Sang changed the subject, expressing his own conjecture.</p><p>“This was my first encounter with Elder Ye. If he truly is, as you say, a peak mid-Yuan Ying stage incarnation, then the power he displayed is likely just the tip of the iceberg, and his schemes are far-reaching!”</p><p>The Snake King's expression was serious, and his apprehension of Elder Ye deepened.</p><p>“As for the Blood Lake, I haven't been to the Wuyaya Valley and don't know much about it. However, I can testify for you before the Two Regions Alliance. Elder Ye has been hunting us for so long, no matter what he intends to do, we can't let him succeed easily!”</p><p>Seeing the Snake King grit his teeth, Qin Sang smiled slightly, “I think so too.”</p><p>They entered the cave the Snake King had created and waited for several days.</p><p>Suddenly, the Snake King opened his eyes, swept his spiritual sense outwards, and brought a small sand lizard wandering outside into the cave.</p><p>Strangely, as soon as the sand lizard entered the cave, it stopped struggling, and its eyes gradually turned blue, a deep,幽蓝.</p><p>“The two Daoists are out of danger, Lu finally feels relieved.”</p><p>The sand lizard's mouth opened and closed, transmitting the voice of the Lu cultivator.</p><p>“Daoist Lu!”</p><p>The Snake King's face lit up. “How are you and Daoist Hanli?”</p><p>“Hanli isn't doing well. To get me out, he self-detonated his treasure, and nearly self-detonated himself. I managed to retrieve his spirit essence, and I'll find a way to deal with it later. As for me, although my foundation wasn't affected, my injuries won't heal in a year or two. It's inconvenient for me to see the two Daoists, so I can only have this little guy relay a message.”</p><p>The Lu cultivator's tone was heavy, tinged with apology.</p><p>Qin Sang and the Snake King expressed their understanding.</p><p>Then, the sand lizard spat out a snake scale, “I'll accept that treasure on Hanli's behalf.”</p><p>This scale contains an ancient secret technique, originating from the Serpent Clan, most suitable for the Serpent King, though it doesn't strictly require Serpent bloodline;  Mingyue should also be able to cultivate it.  Thank you again, Mingyue, for your assistance. This technique is a small token of my gratitude.  Once Hanli and I recover, I will personally thank you."</p><p>Qin Sang modestly replied, "It was merely fortunate timing."</p><p>After a few more words, the blue in the Sand Lizard's eyes faded, its intelligence returning.  It leaped from the Serpent King's hand and disappeared into the sand.</p><p>The Serpent King eagerly pressed the scale to his forehead. After examining it, he passed it to Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang, without hesitation, examined it as well. It was a secret technique related to bloodline power,  impossible to cultivate unless he one day merges with the Qingluan's blood essence.</p><p>However, he could take it back to Qianshan Bamboo Sea; neither the Serpent King nor the Lu cultivator restricted him from passing it on to future generations.</p><p>The Serpent King and the Lu cultivator didn't mention the white copper Qin Sang had acquired.</p><p>"I've refined the pills and temporarily suppressed my injuries. Let's go back,"</p><p>the Serpent King suggested.</p><p>Qin Sang readily agreed.</p><p>On the return journey, Qin Sang and the Serpent King didn't rush.</p><p>Relying on the Sky-Eyed Butterfly's ability to break restrictions, they entered and exited various secluded areas and forbidden grounds in the desert.  With their combined strength, few could threaten them.  Had the Serpent King not been injured, they would have been even more unrestrained.</p><p>Qin Sang failed to find the fragments of the killing sword, but the Fat Chicken benefited greatly.</p><p>Although it always followed Qin Sang, being human, Qin Sang couldn't offer much guidance.</p><p>The Serpent King was different.  A few words pointed directly to the essence of妖族 cultivation, greatly benefiting the Fat Chicken.  Combined with its previous cultivation, it finally had an epiphany, breaking through to the late-stage Yaodan, surprising even the Serpent King.</p><p>"This fellow has excellent talent. No wonder Mingyue kept him by your side. Qianshan Bamboo Sea truly produces outstanding talents...Is he married?"</p><p>Seeing the Serpent King's look, the Fat Chicken felt a chill.</p><p>"Serpent King, you wouldn't have a niece, would you?"</p><p>Qin Sang thought to himself, "This old fellow really likes playing matchmaker."</p><p>The Serpent King laughed, "I not only have a niece, but also an unmarried daughter, though her cultivation is a bit low! However, if this marriage happens, you can't take advantage of Qianshan Bamboo Sea again; the couple must come to my Huolong Mountain."</p><p>"Let the children decide their own fate..."</p><p>Qin Sang said indifferently.</p><p>The Fat Chicken breathed a sigh of relief; the Baihe brothers were enough for a marriage alliance.</p>
