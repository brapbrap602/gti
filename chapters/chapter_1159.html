<h1>Chapter 1151: The Azure Bird Dharma Body</h1><p>Chapter 1151: The Azure Bird Dharma Body</p><p>Qin Sang pondered.  Bai's guess was likely correct; the Yin-Yang armor on his primordial spirit couldn't have shattered for no reason. When the Azure Bird phantom entered his body, he saw the bird soaring through a void of thunder and lightning; it was probably more than just an illusion.</p><p>With only Core Formation cultivation, he was able to withstand the impact of the Azure Bird's blood essence, showing how much its power had diminished. Otherwise, he would have exploded and died instantly.</p><p>Correspondingly, even if some of the Azure Bird's consciousness remained, it must have been at the point of death. Bai, hiding within the Soul-Nurturing Wood, was now just a wisp of a soul, his memories almost completely lost.</p><p>The Azure Bird's consciousness was likely scattered, blocked by the jade Buddha.</p><p>He searched his entire being inch by inch, including the Sky-Eye Butterfly, but found nothing unusual.</p><p>Bai didn't think that much about it. He looked at the Sky-Eye Butterfly fondly for a while, then remembered something and asked, "Your physical body and spirit insect both broke through; you should have a good chance of forming a Nascent Soul, right? When are you planning to break through the bottleneck?"</p><p>"As soon as possible! Once I settle the spirit beasts of the Thousand Mountain Bamboo Sea, I'll close myself off to sort through past events, adjust my state, and then go to the Yun Cang Great Swamp to find a place to transcend the tribulation."</p><p>Qin Sang said solemnly.  The situation was becoming increasingly tense; the cultivation world was in turmoil.</p><p>Although he now possessed the fighting power of almost a Nascent Soul cultivator, it wasn't enough.</p><p>The threat from Dongyang Bo was one thing. He had stolen treasures from the Myriad Serpent Abyss. Although he had temporarily concealed his identity, the Azure Bird Wings were too special. If the Qianji Yao Wang was determined to investigate, there was a significant chance he could uncover his origins.</p><p>Only after forming a Nascent Soul would he truly qualify to be a player in this game.</p><p>Bai nodded.  "I've also reached a critical point. After you transcend the tribulation, I'll continue my seclusion.  This time, it'll probably be a long time…"</p><p>Qin Sang's heart stirred, and he quickly asked, "After this seclusion, Brother Bai should be able to refine the Corpse Soul Pearl and advance to Corpse King, right? Have you figured out a way to unlock the Heavenly Corpse Talisman?"</p><p>Bai hesitated. "I wouldn't say for sure. I can only say there's a certain degree of certainty. As for the Heavenly Corpse Talisman, I'll have to wait until I completely refine the Corpse Soul Pearl before I can say for sure. The outcome is still uncertain.  You have an old friend who found clues about the Heavenly Corpse Sect; we can't give up on that lead. It's best to find the Heavenly Corpse Sect, even if it's just ruins."</p><p>"You mean Tan Hao?"</p><p>Qin Sang nodded.  "After forming a Nascent Soul, I'll have a good talk with Tan Yi'en and look for Tan Hao's old friends. Maybe we can discover some clues. Judging by the tone of Tan Hao's letter, he probably had a good lead. The Heavenly Corpse Sect's main hall is located within the Sinful Abyss, which is really unexpected.  In the future, whether I use my human or demonic identity, I'll definitely have to go to the battlefield. At that time, I'll find a way to infiltrate the Sinful Abyss to investigate."</p><p>…</p><p>The two chatted for a while.  The Sky-Eye Butterfly and Fatty Chicken showed no signs of waking up.</p><p>Qin Sang sent the Sky-Eye Butterfly back to his dantian, then picked up Fatty Chicken and flew towards their agreed meeting point.</p><p>A desolate mountain cave.</p><p>After receiving Qin Sang's signal, the demons dismantled the formation, withdrew from their ambush positions, returned to the mountain cave to hide, and waited for Qin Sang.</p><p>They had been lurking in the distance, only sensing the power of the tribulation from afar. They didn't know exactly what had happened or whether Qin Sang had escaped the pursuit of the Yao Wang.</p><p>They spent the whole night in fear.</p><p>Qin Sang finally returned!</p><p>"Meow! Master Qin is back!"</p><p>The white cat leaped out.</p><p>The demons were overjoyed and surrounded him.</p><p>Under their expectant gazes, Qin Sang smiled.  "I've succeeded! The harvest was even greater than expected. We'll talk about it when we get back."</p><p>The demons happily returned to the Thousand Mountain Bamboo Sea.</p><p>Qin Sang gave Fatty Chicken to the willow tree spirit, instructing them to guard the formation and not to disturb him unless something major happened, before closing his cave dwelling.</p><p>For several months.</p><p>Qin Sang never went out.</p><p>His top priority was to consolidate the fourth level of the Heavenly Demon Transformation.</p><p>The Azure Bird's blood essence was an external force. Even though Qin Sang practiced visualizing the Azure Bird, he still felt a slight split in his phoenix wings.  He calmed himself, understanding the fourth-level technique of the Heavenly Demon Transformation while refining the phoenix wings to achieve a state of unity.</p><p>Once that was done, the technique was completely stabilized.</p><p>Qin Sang also gained some insights into the subsequent techniques of the fourth level.</p><p>"Dharma Body! Appear!"</p><p>Qin Sang awoke from his meditative state, uttering these words.  A flash of blue light enveloped him, a gust of wind rose behind him, and the Azure Bird Dharma Body appeared out of thin air.</p><p>It was called a Dharma Body, but it was extremely illusory, almost too faint to even be called a phantom.</p><p>It was like a mirage, easily broken.</p><p>Of course, he couldn't have high expectations for such a Dharma Body.</p><p>"The Heavenly Demon Dharma Body's abilities require continuous refinement to gradually display their power. It is a gradual process."</p><p>Qin Sang studied the Celestial Demon Aspect, recalling the descriptions in the cultivation manual.  "At my current level, the Celestial Demon Aspect's function is to boost my strength after activating the Celestial Demon Transformation. The effect isn't very noticeable now, but as the Aspect solidifies, the benefits will increase. Also, the fourth level of the manual mentions that after comprehending the Celestial Demon Aspect, there's a chance to gain some of the Celestial Demon's divine abilities. But the Azure-Luán Aspect doesn't seem to have anything special…"</p><p>Qin Sang thought to himself: "If a demon cultivator practiced this technique, the divine abilities they'd comprehend would likely come from their ancestors, inherited through bloodline. I'm an outsider, practicing an incomplete technique, so that's why it's missing?"</p><p>Suddenly, his expression shifted.  "Could it be the Thunder Escape technique?  Incorporating Azure-Luán essence and inheriting Thunder Escape is very possible!"</p><p>In Qin Sang's view, mastering the Thunder Escape technique was more desirable than other abilities.</p><p>He'd been stranded overseas, ventured into the Seven Killing Hall three times, and experienced countless perilous situations. Many times, it was his superb escape techniques that allowed him to survive.</p><p>Attack or retreat, he had the upper hand!</p><p>After forming his Nascent Soul, the Nine Dragon Celestial Chariot Talisman became less effective. Thunder Escape was far superior to a mere talisman.</p><p>"The fourth level, like the previous three, only requires channeling the power of the celestial stars to temper the body systematically. However, the bone flute still hasn't revealed the fifth level. I've memorized the Azure-Luán essence. I wonder if I can break through to the fifth level the next time I use star energy to temper my body? That's comparable to the power of a Metamorphosis-stage cultivator!"</p><p>Qin Sang took out the bone flute, his consciousness probing inside. The subsequent chapters remained shrouded in mist.</p><p>After some thought, Qin Sang put away the Aspect and the flute, and summoned the Heaven's Eye Butterfly.</p><p>During his seclusion, the butterfly had mastered its newly acquired power. It had grown larger, but still preferred to revert to its smaller form, landing on Qin Sang's shoulder, gently rubbing his cheek.</p><p>"I wonder how the Heaven's Eye technique will improve after the butterfly's advancement?"</p><p>Qin Sang looked at the insect sideways, wondering if it could still be considered a Heaven's Eye Butterfly. Its Heaven's Eye and Thunder Control abilities had merged, completely changing its nature.</p><p>Qin Sang closed his eyes and entered meditation, his mind merging with the butterfly as he pondered the Nascent Soul bottleneck.</p><p>'Creak!'</p><p>Qin Sang pushed open the door and saw a white cat guarding the outer hall.</p><p>"Master Qin…"</p><p>The cat stood up.</p><p>Qin Sang said, "Go get Daoist Liu and the others. I have an announcement."</p><p>******</p>
