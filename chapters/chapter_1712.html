<h1>Chapter 1703: Breakthrough</h1><p>Two years later.</p><p>The avatar sensed the activation of the cave's restriction and awoke from meditation, welcoming the Sage Huiguang and the Saint King Qinghu into the chamber.  During this time, the Saint King Qinghu had traveled to the Jingkong Island in the East Sea to relocate an ancient spirit gathering array and collected the herbs and materials the avatar required from the demon race, only returning now.</p><p>‘Bang! Bang! Bang…’</p><p>The ground trembled.</p><p>Several beams of light shot out from Saint King Qinghu's fingertips, landing on the ground and transforming into four thirty-zhang-tall sculptures—statues of the four sacred beasts: Azure Dragon, White Tiger, Vermilion Bird, and Black Tortoise.</p><p>“The Four Sacred Beast statues are part of the spirit gathering array. I also call it the Four Sacred Beast Gathering Array. This is the core array disc.”</p><p>Saint King Qinghu flicked his wrist again, and an octagonal array disc flew towards the avatar. The disc shimmered with silver light, only the size of a normal compass. The avatar caught it, feeling its considerable weight, unsure of what material it was made from.</p><p>The disc was covered in many lines, not regular runes, but a dense network of cracks—a truly sorry sight.  Even though Saint King Qinghu had warned him beforehand, upon seeing the array disc's condition, the avatar's movements subconsciously slowed, afraid of damaging it.</p><p>The four sacred beast statues were only slightly better.  He couldn't help but look at Saint King Qinghu with suspicion.</p><p>Saint King Qinghu said lazily, “You’ve cultivated to the late Yuan Ying stage; you can't be completely ignorant of array formations.  Try it and you'll see I'm not lying; it's more than enough to support your cultivation. Of course, if you can comprehend the true Four Sacred Beast Gathering Array from these array instruments, even I would envy your good fortune.”</p><p>The avatar sensed the mockery in his tone.</p><p>It seemed Saint King Qinghu was confident that he couldn't comprehend the true spirit gathering array. If it were that easy, it wouldn't be so valuable.</p><p>“Please wait a moment…”</p><p>The avatar stood up, waved his hand, and the four statues shrunk, falling into his palm before being taken inside.</p><p>In the inner chamber, the avatar set up the four statues and the array disc according to Saint King Qinghu's instructions, precisely corresponding to the positions of the four sacred beasts.</p><p>There was also the Myriad Li Azure Profound Array brought by Sage Huiguang.</p><p>Ganlu Monastery had fully cooperated, having already prepared all the necessary array instruments for the Myriad Li Azure Profound Array.</p><p>Both arrays were set up in the avatar's cave.</p><p>As soon as the Four Sacred Beast Gathering Array was completed, the four statues vanished, and images of the four sacred beasts appeared in the four directions of the array disc, their heads pointed towards the center, their mouths slightly open, as if exhaling towards the center.</p><p>The avatar felt the spiritual energy in the cave surge, and spiritual energy from all directions converged above the gathering array, as if there were an invisible vortex there.</p><p>Up to this point in his cultivation, aside from legends related to several immortal palaces, this was the strongest spirit gathering array Qin Sang had ever seen!</p><p>Stepping into the array, the avatar silently circulated his cultivation cycle once, feeling refreshed and finding cultivation easier than before. If he hadn't been hindered by a bottleneck, the effect would have been even better.</p><p>Saint King Qinghu's earlier description was not exaggerated; this would be a significant boost for his cultivation.</p><p>“The Four Sacred Beast statues… I possess the South Ming Li Fire; can I use it to explore the secrets of this array…?”</p><p>The avatar's thoughts turned, and he looked at the Vermilion Bird image beside him.</p><p>Unfortunately, he did not sense any familiar energy from it. The existence of the Four Sacred Beast statues didn't necessarily mean they were truly related to the four sacred beasts; it could be a deception used by the array's creator.</p><p>Then, the avatar set up the Myriad Li Azure Profund Array and cast the incantation.</p><p>A gust of wind arose.</p><p>A stream of azure spiritual wind generated within the array, swirling slightly in front of the avatar before shooting upwards.  It dissipated without a trace upon reaching the cave's ceiling.</p><p>Meanwhile.</p><p>Qin Sang's main body in the Luye heard a clear bell sound.</p><p>To one side of his cave, he had arranged a Green Bell Array using dozens of fist-sized green bells to communicate with the Myriad Li Azure Profound Array. The cost of refining the bells was far less than the main body of the Myriad Li Azure Profound Array.</p><p>The ringing indicated a result from the avatar's side.</p><p>Qin Sang's spirits lifted.  He used a spell, and the bell's ringing became more urgent. A stream of azure spiritual wind gathered within the bell array, vaguely forming a human-shaped outline…</p><p>…</p><p>Three days later.</p><p>The avatar emerged from the inner chamber, Sage Huiguang and Saint King Qinghu still waiting outside, showing no impatience.</p><p>The avatar took out two newly engraved jade slips, “These are the formulas for the Spirit-Subduing Incense and the Unseen Immortal Sect's alchemical legacy. I've already arranged for someone to deliver the Myriad Spirit Fruits and other herbs…”</p><p>Saint King Qinghu received the jade slips, left the herbs and materials needed by the avatar, and departed, simply saying, "I'll verify this later."</p><p>“Amitabha, well, well, the two benefactors have turned enmity into friendship, a fortunate event for both races! A fortunate event for all beings!”</p><p>Sage Huiguang looked relieved and stood up, “This monk will not disturb your quiet cultivation.”</p><p>"Please proceed, Master."</p><p>After seeing off the two Nascent Soul cultivators from the two races, the avatar returned to the cave abode.  He carefully stored away various treasures, then sat cross-legged, palms pressed together.  A chilling aura emanated from his palms, coalescing into a white orb between them.  The cold energy was perfectly contained, not a single wisp escaping.</p><p>This was the avatar's attempt to comprehend the chilling aura and break through his late Nascent Soul bottleneck!</p><p>Meanwhile, the *Tian Mo Zhao Jing* scripture was transmitted to the main body via the Wan Li Qing Ming Array.  The Four Saints Gathering Spirit Array and other physical items were too cumbersome to send back for now, so he would wait for a more opportune moment.</p><p>Lu Ye.</p><p>Qin Sang's main body sat with his hands folded in his lap, holding a jade slip containing the complete *Tian Mo Zhao Jing*. He had read it dozens of times, meticulously studying each word. Compared to the *Hundred-Fold Yin Thunder* and other Nascent Soul-level techniques, this scripture wasn't particularly complex. Even without reaching the required cultivation level, Qin Sang could understand its key principles.</p><p>However, these principles were also the scripture's greatest danger. It involved actively setting up an altar, chanting incantations, and actively drawing near to a celestial demon – not the demon's actual body, but a strand of demonic essence, or demonic intent.</p><p>The scripture’s origins were unclear.  Qin Sang felt it was more like a demonic sect's evil art, similar to those techniques that disrupt one's emotions and desires.</p><p>Even if it only involved attracting demonic intent, the requirements for the cultivator were extremely high.</p><p>Firstly, one's mind had to be exceptionally firm, lest the demonic intent trigger inner demons.</p><p>Secondly, one's spiritual sense had to be incredibly strong to complete the entire incantation ritual. This was even more crucial than mental fortitude, as the ritual was extremely demanding. At the ritual's climax, after drawing in the demonic intent, one had to immediately sever the connection.  The slightest hesitation would attract the celestial demon's attention, leading to utter ruin.</p><p>After the ritual, the cultivator would constantly coexist with the demonic intent, using it to refine themselves, but also constantly risking being consumed by it.</p><p>According to the scripture, a Nascent Soul-level spiritual sense was the minimum requirement, and a spiritual cultivator was preferred.  For someone like him, a Yuan Ying cultivator who had received various fortuitous encounters and had the chance to raise his spiritual sense to the Nascent Soul level, extreme caution was necessary.</p><p>Possessing the Jade Buddha, Qin Sang felt much less pressure. He still recalled the incident at the Seven Killing Hall, when the Demon Lord's soul-attacking technique instantly severely injured everyone present, only to be effortlessly blocked by the Jade Buddha.</p><p>However, Qin Sang couldn't compare the strength of the extraterrestrial celestial demon and the Demon Lord.</p><p>Furthermore, this scripture came from a fox demon who harbored ill will towards him, making it even more perilous.</p><p>Time passed unnoticed in the cave abode.  Qin Sang couldn't remember how many times he had studied the scripture, but he was certain that the Qinghu Saint King hadn't tampered with it. Each sentence was concise and precise, and the exquisite techniques were no different from those found in scriptures from immortal palaces.  Adding or changing even a single word would make it jarring; its creator was certainly no ordinary person.</p><p>Caution was still paramount. The Jade Buddha could only protect his soul.  No one knew what other bizarre and unpredictable methods the extraterrestrial celestial demon possessed besides inducing inner demons and killing.</p><p>The ritual required the prior refinement of the demonic fire essence.  He also needed to wait for his avatar's return and prepare a backup plan.</p><p>For anyone else, if something went wrong during the incantation, they would have no means of coping, their inner demons would instantly proliferate, and there would be no hope of survival.</p><p>But Qin Sang was different. The Jade Buddha ensured the clarity of his mind; regardless of the celestial demon's power, he should be able to buy himself some time to react.</p><p>If an insurmountable problem arose, he would immediately have his avatar replace his main body, then sever the connection with the external avatar, sacrificing a pawn to save the king.</p><p>Whether using an external celestial demon to replace the inner demon to condense the demonic seal would work, Qin Sang wasn't entirely sure. But recalling Senior Sister Qing Jun's description of the *Wusheng Demon Seal*, it was worth a try.</p><p>Just like what Qin Sang was currently doing.</p><p>Failure meant sacrificing an avatar.</p><p>Success would grant him a Nascent Soul-level technique.  An extraterrestrial celestial demon could influence cultivators at the Void Refinement stage, and using demonic intent to create a seal should be more powerful than using inner demons.</p><p>His goal remained unchanged: to break through to the next realm. He would do whatever it took, even sacrificing an external avatar.</p><p>...</p><p>Daoist Qingfeng appeared at the Ganlu Zen Monastery. This turmoil didn't last long. The cultivation world's attention quickly shifted to other matters.</p><p>The most talked-about event was the deployment of forces by both humans and demons, led by two Nascent Soul cultivators, who gathered experts from all factions to establish defenses in the storm belts in the north, east, and south of Central State, preparing to hunt down the monstrous beasts.</p><p>Central State's west was a land of lava and raging flames, where the chances of encountering monstrous beasts were low.</p><p>By this time, news of the monstrous beasts’ rampage had spread throughout the cultivation world, with even many Golden Core cultivators aware of it.</p><p>After the initial panic subsided, people gradually calmed down as sightings of the beasts became increasingly rare.  Unlike before, when they roamed in packs, it had been decades since one had been seen near the Central Plains.</p><p>Over the years, aside from the reappearance of these creatures from an unknown origin, nothing much changed; the barrier protecting against the storm showed no sign of weakening.</p><p>Only those in the know worried about a change in the beasts' lair, affecting the Ascension Path.  Therefore, the two races' powerful cultivators called for a joint effort, and many responded.</p><p>Humans and demons, sects and schools, united in an unprecedented display of cooperation.  They deployed their top experts to patrol the storm zone in shifts, ready to report any beast sighting.</p><p>Fifteen years passed in this manner.</p><p>Ganlu Temple.</p><p>A series of 'click, click, click' sounds echoed from within the transformed body's chamber.</p><p>Anyone entering at this moment would have been astonished.  The chamber was frigid, transformed into an ice cave.  Thick icicles coated the walls, and a white chill constantly circulated.  Even a Nascent Soul cultivator could be injured by the cold if careless.</p><p>The chill constantly swirled around a seated figure – the transformed body.</p><p>The transformed body was coated in frost, seemingly frozen stiff.  It inhaled and exhaled the surrounding cold air; as time passed, the chill grew stronger.</p><p>The entire chamber was shrouded in a white mist.</p><p>Suddenly, the cold stopped moving.</p><p>Time within the chamber seemed to freeze. After a hundred breaths, the stillness gave way to intense activity.  The cold air visibly condensed into several streams, violently retracting before converging at the transformed body's crown and surging inward!</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The transformed body violently shuddered, its interior roaring like thunder.</p><p>On the other side of the mountain, within his chamber, a high priest suddenly opened his eyes.  He instantly appeared on the mountaintop, gazing towards the transformed body's chamber, his fingers rapidly circling his prayer beads.</p><p>A long howl echoed; the mountain's spiritual energy, as if drawn by some force, surged towards the chamber, causing the peak to tremble.</p><p>The extraordinary phenomenon gradually subsided.</p><p>Shortly after.</p><p>A figure shimmered into existence before the priest – the transformed body.</p><p>However, the transformed body's aura had drastically changed; it had reached the late Nascent Soul stage!</p><p>"I apologize for disturbing your meditation, Master."</p><p>The transformed body bowed.</p><p>"May blessings be upon you! Congratulations on achieving enlightenment, Daoist Master!"</p><p>The priest returned the bow with clasped hands.</p><p>The transformed body smiled. He hadn't expected such a smooth breakthrough; his external transformed body had successfully advanced on its first attempt.  It seemed his insights benefited the transformed body as well.</p><p>Unlike Qin Sang's previous approach, the transformed body, after breaking through, didn't remain in seclusion.  After stabilizing his cultivation, he made a high-profile appearance. News of Qingfeng Daoist's breakthrough to late Nascent Soul quickly spread through the cultivation world, with many predicting his imminent ascension to the Transformation stage, though some lamented his association with the Buddhist sect.</p><p>As Qingfeng Daoist resided at Ganlu Temple, he was generally inaccessible; thus, the Xie family and Loutai View became even more sought after.</p><p>While celebrating a late Nascent Soul breakthrough is customary in the North Sea, it's optional in the Central Plains.</p><p>When Master Xingji came to congratulate him, he casually suggested a celebration, which the transformed body readily accepted, to be hosted by Ganlu Temple.</p><p>This created a unique spectacle in the cultivation world; never before had a celebration been held at another sect's mountain gate.</p><p>The celebration was lavishly attended.</p><p>Ganlu Temple ensured everything went smoothly; Xie An and others busily scurried about, looking exceptionally proud.</p><p>At the celebration,  Sifu Yu, the headmaster of Buling Mountain, personally delivered gifts and mentioned that Lu Zhang had completed his cultivation and was attempting a breakthrough; the transformed body offered his congratulations.</p><p>Hegao Zhenren, the new headmaster of Baguan View, also came to celebrate.</p><p>The transformed body also met the renowned Yu Zongzhu of Tianhao Tower, and high-ranking members from top sects like Longju Cave Heaven and Qiongying Gate, encountering many prominent figures of the cultivation world.</p><p>Ganlu Temple clearly had other arrangements.  After a brief meeting with the transformed body, these individuals went to visit the Holy Saint Huiguang, presumably to discuss matters.</p><p>It's worth noting that the transformed body encountered the Poison King again at the celebration.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, the Poison King brought up the topic of the Gu King again.</p><p>The transformed body failed to extract the Gu King's origins from the Poison King, simply stating: "Friend Daoist, you should understand my situation; even if I wished to trade, I dare not reveal myself.  I will visit again when my cultivation is higher."</p><p>...</p><p>After the breakthrough, Qin Sang didn't rush to further improve his transformed body's cultivation.</p><p>The transformed body didn't continue his seclusion, instead studying the Four-fold Serpent Seal and examining the scriptures in Ganlu Temple's library, gaining greatly from this.</p><p>Furthermore, the transformed body began to learn the alchemic techniques of the Wuxiang Immortal Sect.</p><p>Using techniques like transformed bodies and divided spirits to learn various esoteric arts is not uncommon in the cultivation world, but often yields unsatisfactory results. After all, not everyone's transformed body possesses the same autonomy and equivalent cultivation base as his, enabling him to gain profound insights.</p><p>The two races' powerful cultivators convened human alchemic masters to analyze the formula for the Spirit-Subduing Incense.</p><p>After learning this, the transformed body met several masters. These individuals were tight-lipped about the Spirit-Subduing Incense, but readily offered assistance, and were happy to help by refining pills needed for Tianmu Butterfly cultivation at his request.</p><p>...</p><p>Six years later.</p><p>Within Luye.</p><p>The Mani Pearl floated before the original body. The flames around the Ruyi Treasure Pearl reappeared, red with several black threads.</p><p>(End of Chapter)</p>
