<h1>Chapter 636: Missing Little Cold Domain</h1><p>Chapter 636: Missing Little Cold Domain</p><p>“No, no…”</p><p>Cui Xuanzi shook his head repeatedly, unsure of Qin Sang’s meaning, stroking his beard and laughing, “This old man would be delighted if you joined the Five Insects Sect, but I fear my humble abode is not worthy of your attention.”</p><p>Unexpectedly, the mute woman stood up, walked to Cui Xuanzi, and knelt down, “Disciple greets Master!”</p><p>Qin Sang did not stop her, sighing inwardly.</p><p>The mute woman is very clever, she already understood his meaning.</p><p>By bowing to Cui Xuanzi in front of him, it was probably the best choice.  Her action was indeed decisive.</p><p>…</p><p>After settling the mute woman, Qin Sang and Cui Xuanzi discussed the important matter.</p><p>“Junior, as per senior’s instructions, I contacted many friends and did my best to help you investigate. However, most came up empty-handed…”</p><p>Cui Xuanzi looked somewhat embarrassed.</p><p>“I know a manager of a trading company. This company has a mysterious background, its business spans most of Western Xinjiang, and its intelligence network is very well-informed. He said that in the past two hundred years, only one Nascent Soul cultivator has emerged from Western Xinjiang.  This cultivator left Xinjiang, betrayed their master, joined a large sect outside, and only then successfully achieved Nascent Soul stage. Not many of our Witch Clan are proficient in swordsmanship, and it's even rarer in Western Xinjiang. There's no one matching your description. Even outside Xinjiang, there's no record of a Nascent Soul ancestor named Qingzhu.”</p><p>Qin Sang frowned slightly.  Senior Qingzhu was known as the Sword Demon in Little Cold Domain, deeply immersed in the Dao of Killing, his swordsmanship was so unique. If he had appeared in Western Xinjiang back then, even just once, he would definitely have been remembered.</p><p>There's not a single trace.</p><p>Cultivating the "Meta-Soul Sword Cultivation Chapter" requires participation in slaughter and understanding the Dao of Killing; it's difficult to remain low-key.</p><p>Could Senior Qingzhu have had a transmission error back then, resulting in an accidental death?</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head, finding it too absurd.</p><p>“What else?”</p><p>Cui Xuanzi said, “I also asked him to help purchase Everlasting Camphor and Soul-Guiding Grass. My friend has heard of them. But according to him, both are extraordinary treasures, and even the trading company has never recorded purchasing them. Finding them in Western Xinjiang is like a fantasy.  Even…”</p><p>He paused, carefully observing Qin Sang’s expression, “According to him, these high-level spiritual materials and herbs are hard to find in the entire Canglang Sea. Senior, you can only rely on luck to find them.”</p><p>Upon hearing this, Qin Sang's eyes flashed in surprise.</p><p>Everlasting Camphor is understandable, it's an extraordinary treasure.</p><p>Why is Soul-Guiding Grass so rare?</p><p>In Little Cold Domain, Soul-Guiding Grass is rare, but at least it sometimes appears at the auctions of the Demon Sect, used by Demon Sect cultivators to aid cultivation.</p><p>The Canglang Sea is extremely vast, just the Witch God Continent alone is comparable to several Little Cold Domains.</p><p>This trading company manager actually dares to say that Soul-Guiding Grass is hard to find in the entire Canglang Sea.</p><p>Unless this person is ignorant and rambling…</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly felt an ominous premonition and asked in a serious tone, “Your friend is knowledgeable and should hold a high position in the trading company, right? I wonder if he has any way to acquire pills that aid in Golden Core formation? I will buy them for the younger generation of my sect, price is no problem.”</p><p>“Aiding Golden Core formation?”</p><p>Cui Xuanzi smiled wryly, “To be honest, senior, I had the same idea before, but later I learned from that manager. Even if these divine medicines provide only a slight help to Golden Core formation, their appearance in the human race will cause countless factions to scramble for them. It's even rarer for our Witch Clan, it's impossible for them to appear in Western Xinjiang!”</p><p>Hearing this, Qin Sang finally realized where the problem lay.</p><p>It seems that the Canglang Sea is far less abundant than Little Cold Domain!</p><p>Little Cold Domain has the Ancient Immortal Battlefield, where ancient secret realms are occasionally discovered. Sometimes, if lucky, you might even find a whole medicinal garden, with precious spiritual materials constantly appearing.</p><p>For example, materials that aid Golden Core formation.  Just Shaohua Mountain alone can prepare a Kanli Golden Pill for each of its Core Formation disciples, and other orthodox sects and Demon Sects wouldn't be much different.</p><p>Only celestial treasures like Snow Spirit Lotus and Iris Flower are exceptionally rare.</p><p>Qin Sang originally thought that the storms outside the Canglang Sea were similar to the Ancient Immortal Battlefield.  Moreover, with such a vast Canglang Sea, its resources should be richer than Little Cold Domain.</p><p>Now he knows that the spiritual herbs and materials in the Canglang Sea are so scarce!</p><p>Qin Sang had suffered greatly during his Golden Core formation, and he knew how difficult it was.</p><p>Even without the necessary spiritual herbs for the auxiliary stage of Golden Core formation, how low must the chances of Canglang Sea cultivators achieving Golden Core be?</p><p>Witch clans have their soul-linked insect gu; could human cultivators have other methods?</p><p>Cultivating in such a barren place, what prospects could there be? Qin Sang suddenly missed Xiaohan region immensely.</p><p>However, this was only hearsay from Cui Xuanzi; seeing is believing.</p><p>Qin Sang's heart churned, but his face remained impassive.</p><p>Cui Xuanzi continued, "The Quehuo beast you inquired about isn't found in Western Xinjiang either. However, a manager mentioned a rumor of Quehuo sightings in the Storm Sea. You could try searching there..."</p><p>Cui Xuanzi spoke rapidly, detailing all the information he had gathered for Qin Sang, then handed him a jade slip.</p><p>The jade slip contained a simplified map of most of Western Xinjiang, sparsely marked with some long-standing dangerous and secluded locations – precisely what Qin Sang wanted.</p><p>But, these places are all deep within Western Xinjiang. Would I have drifted all this way from so far?</p><p>Qin Sang mused.</p><p>Additionally, several rumored locations of strange insect nests were included, all based on Qin Sang's list of peculiar insects.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes lit up. Resources here are scarce, yet there are many peculiar insects, unlike anything found in Xiaohan region.</p><p>He couldn't decide which insect to choose as his soul-linked insect gu. Each insect possessed extraordinary abilities, making each seem suitable.</p><p>However, these insects, with their unique talents, are well-hidden, their whereabouts unpredictable and difficult to trace. The rumors are largely speculative; whether they can be caught remains unknown.</p><p>"Good work, you've truly put in the effort..."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, but suddenly frowned, turning his head toward the entrance hall.</p><p>Dozens of differently colored遁光streaked through the mountains towards the Five Insects Gate, their momentum overwhelming.</p><p>Cui Xuanzi only then noticed the commotion outside, dashed out of the hall, and his expression drastically changed upon seeing the uninvited guests.</p><p>"All disciples, activate the protective mountain array!"</p><p>Cui Xuanzi shouted urgently.</p><p>The Five Insects Gate disciples, having also sensed the danger, flew out from the mountains, panic spreading.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The peaks resonated, emitting dazzling beams of light that converged in the air, forming a real lotus flower.</p><p>A boisterous laugh rang out from outside.  "Old Cui Xuan, distinguished guests have arrived.  Instead of a welcoming party, you activate the protective array? Is that your way of showing hospitality?"</p><p>Qin Sang remained seated in the hall, taking a sip of tea.</p>
