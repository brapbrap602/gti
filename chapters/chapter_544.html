Chapter 537: Starting Anew


High above, the Fire Gourd and the Ten Yama Banners drifted in and out of the sea of flames.
With each strike of the magical treasures, countless streams of fire shot out, impacting the forests below like falling meteorites, leaving shockingly deep craters.
Demonic fire filled the sky.
The mountains trembled.
This scene, like a natural disaster, terrified the creatures of the mountains.
Qin Sang countered with fire, his eyes scanning rapidly, searching for advantageous terrain.
Just then, Qin Sang suddenly noticed a sparrow-sized azure bird flying from the distant horizon. Inconspicuous in appearance, it flew towards Wu Youdao with astonishing speed.
Qin Sang's heart stirred. He restrained the Nine Nether Demon Fire and slowed his attack, allowing the azure bird to fly near Wu Youdao.
‘Poof!’
Wu Youdao reached out and grabbed it. The azure bird exploded into flames, returning to its origin.
Holding the flames, Wu Youdao focused and sensed.
After a moment, Qin Sang shouted, "How is it, Fellow Daoist Wu? I didn't lie to you! I only took the Qiantian Astral Qi, and I absolutely didn't touch your sect's forbidden grounds."
Wu Youdao looked up at Qin Sang, his eyes flickering.
Seeing this, Qin Sang felt a surge of joy. He said in a deep voice, "If Fellow Daoist continues to press me, I'll have no choice but to detonate this Void Thunder. I believe Fellow Daoist is capable of avoiding the explosion now, but when we're both exhausted and wounded, how much confidence will you have then?"
He continued earnestly, "This matter was my fault to begin with. It's a laughing matter. I absolutely will not breathe a word of this to anyone."
"If there's a next time, I will end your life!" Wu Youdao coldly warned Qin Sang. He suddenly waved his hand, retrieving the Fire Gourd.  Flames erupted beneath his feet, and he soared away.
"Thank you, Fellow Daoist, for your understanding!"
Qin Sang bowed from afar.
He didn't dare to linger. Once Wu Youdao disappeared from sight, he immediately retrieved the Ten Yama Banners and flew with all his might towards the depths of the mountains.
He remained vigilant as he traveled, only finding a hidden cave and slipping inside after confirming that no one was following him.
……
"Phew!"
He set up restrictions, sealing the cave.
Qin Sang collapsed on the ground, exhaling a long breath.
Although this battle wasn't a fight to the death, Qin Sang felt it was more thrilling than any previous battle, leaving him trembling with fear and walking on thin ice.
After all, this was the first time he had truly faced a Nascent Soul cultivator.
Whether it was using true essence or activating magical treasures, he was very unfamiliar. Although he grew in the midst of battle and gradually became more proficient, he was still quite a bit behind Wu Youdao.
Fortunately, he was not afraid of the Azure Sun Demon Fire, while Wu Youdao had to be constantly on guard, not daring to let the Nine Nether Demon Fire get close. This advantage allowed Qin Sang to avoid a swift defeat.
Wu Youdao must have seen this and thought he had a chance to capture him.
Without the threat of the Void Thunder, the outcome would have been uncertain.
Finally out of danger, Qin Sang rested briefly, then immediately sat down cross-legged and looked inward.
"The recovery speed of this true essence is truly slow!"
Qin Sang sensed his Corpse Pill and smiled wryly.
He calculated that when the Corpse Pill's true essence was exhausted, it would take half a day to recover. This meant that he would have to carefully manage his resources in every future battle.
Qin Sang let the Corpse Pill recover on its own and began to carefully examine his body.
The cave was silent.
Qin Sang sat motionless for a day and a night.
The next evening, he withdrew his divine sense from his body, his expression grave, lost in thought.
Throughout the day, he had finally sorted out his current situation.
First, his strength was undoubtedly on par with a true Nascent Soul cultivator.
Second, and the issue Qin Sang was most concerned about—could he cultivate techniques?
The answer was no.
Due to the dual constraints of the Heavenly Corpse Talisman and the restrictions, his true essence could only follow a fixed route. Qin Sang tried countless times, and just like before forming the Corpse Pill, he couldn't budge it.
This meant that he would never be able to cultivate any techniques and would not improve any further.
Now Qin Sang faced a choice, and with the corpse transformation deepening, he had less and less time to think.
Should he allow his body to fully transform into a corpse and follow the path of a corpse cultivator?
Or should he remove the Heavenly Corpse Talisman and gamble on whether he could retain the Corpse Pill?
Without much hesitation, Qin Sang decided to choose the second path.
He had no idea how to proceed after becoming a corpse.
Even those corpse cultivating sects had only heard of cultivators refining corpses, not of someone refining themselves into one.
Back then, even the brilliant Wu Shang hadn't found a method to break the limitations of the *Heavenly Yin Corpse Scripture*.
After the corpse transformation, the physical body would be strengthened, but the Nascent Soul would remain unchanged. This meant that Qin Sang's lifespan would likely be the same as a Foundation Establishment cultivator—only 250 years, not 500.
Within these 250 years, Qin Sang not only had to find suitable corpse cultivation techniques but also rely on his inferior talent to cultivate to the next realm.
Moreover, with the Heavenly Corpse Talisman present, could those corpse cultivation techniques even help him break through the shackles and advance?
Qin Sang had no confidence at all.
……
Should he possess the power of a Nascent Soul cultivator and enjoy a hundred years of freedom?
Or should he willingly give up this tempting power and continue to pursue the Great Dao?
In the cultivation world of the Small Cold Realm, Nascent Soul cultivators were revered, enjoying worship and having everything at their fingertips. But for Qin Sang, these were nothing but fleeting illusions.
After a hundred years, he would inevitably return to dust. What was the point?
……
He was about to become a true refined corpse, a transformation that couldn't be reversed.
If he couldn't find corpse cultivation techniques, aside from abandoning his body and seizing another, there would be no other path.
Soul seizing came at a cost. After seizing a body, one's lifespan wouldn't increase.
Moreover, due to the incompatibility between the body and the Nascent Soul, unless one obtained a legendary elixir to harmonize the body and soul, the chances of future breakthroughs would be slim.
The *Nascent Soul Sword Nurturing Chapter* gave Qin Sang hope of pursuing the Great Dao.  If there were no subsequent techniques, that would be one thing, but now he had a clue about Senior Green Bamboo's self-created technique.  Qin Sang was unwilling to give up unless absolutely necessary.
Of course, Qin Sang's decision wasn't without basis.
He could clearly sense that the Corpse Pill was highly compatible with him, and this compatibility wasn't just due to external factors.
The connection between them wasn't solely from the Heavenly Corpse Talisman and the *Heavenly Yin Corpse Scripture*, but also a result of the fusion of his divine sense and vital essence during the refinement of the Corpse Pill.
The most obvious example was during the Astral and Earthly Qi Infusion, when his spiritual power, wrapped in the astral and earthly qi, was infused into the Golden Core.
After careful consideration, Qin Sang estimated he had at least a thirty percent chance of retaining the Corpse Pill after removing the Heavenly Corpse Talisman!
If the Corpse Pill could continue to be used by him, it would be ideal.
He would return to the orthodox path and could still cultivate the *Nascent Soul Sword Nurturing Chapter*.
Even if the Corpse Pill couldn't become a true Golden Core, it could serve as an external elixir, allowing him to wield power comparable to a Nascent Soul cultivator at any time.
In the future, searching for hidden secrets and elixirs to aid in forming a Golden Core would undoubtedly be much easier.
If he failed…
Qin Sang's lips pressed tightly together.
Even if the pill shattered, so what?
He could just start anew!
