<h1>Chapter 1998: Dharma Manifestation Complete</h1><p>This sensation was extremely subtle, fleeting and elusive, yet undeniably real. Qin Sang was certain it wasn't an illusion.</p><p>In the profound night sky, the stars occupied only a tiny fraction of the vast, dark expanse.</p><p>Besides the brilliantly shining stars, there were also lightless, dark stars. These dark stars remained hidden within the darkness, unseen and unknown.</p><p>But what kind of existence were these dark stars?</p><p>Why could he perceive them, and why could his Azure Phoenix Dharma Manifestation connect with one of these dark stars?</p><p>Countless questions arose in Qin Sang's mind, but no one here could answer them, and the *Celestial Demon Physique Refinement Scripture* offered no explanation.</p><p>Then, a bewildered expression crept onto Qin Sang's face.  It wasn't just these unsolved mysteries that confused him.</p><p>When he perceived that faint connection and focused his senses, attempting to locate its source, it became even more ethereal, seemingly there yet not there.</p><p>Like willow catkins in the wind, impossible to grasp.  Someone with a weaker will might have already begun to suspect they were experiencing a Heart Devil, leading them astray.</p><p>Even stranger, the direction indicated by the connection grew increasingly blurred.</p><p>Qin Sang grew increasingly doubtful. Was it truly an invisible dark star resonating with his Azure Phoenix Dharma Manifestation, or was it an entire region of the starry sky?</p><p>Or perhaps it was a bright star in the void, one he could actually see, but his cultivation was insufficient, leading to a deviation in his perception.</p><p>In the vast starry sky, a small area could contain hundreds, even thousands, of bright stars, and potentially even more unseen dark stars.</p><p>Qin Sang scanned the bright stars in that area one by one, becoming increasingly perplexed. Each one seemed like a possibility, yet none felt quite right.</p><p>The harder he tried to sense it, the more blurred the target became.</p><p>‘Screech!’</p><p>Qin Sang was startled awake by the shriek of his Azure Phoenix Dharma Manifestation.</p><p>The Dharma Manifestation, positioned above him, bore the brunt of the Silver River's fierce impact.</p><p>Starlight surged like a tide, a vast and torrential flow, scouring both the Dharma Manifestation and his true body.</p><p>The Azure Phoenix's feathers were disheveled, breaking like real feathers, its body becoming translucent, like a flickering candle flame about to be extinguished by the starlight.</p><p>Simultaneously, waves of intense pain racked Qin Sang's body.  The sharper the Azure Phoenix's cries, the greater his agony, finally pulling him from his bewilderment.</p><p>This was the crucial moment of his breakthrough, and he was within a killing formation. How could he afford to be confused and hesitant at such a time?  He had to trust his judgment and proceed unwaveringly!</p><p>The confusion vanished from Qin Sang's heart. Discarding all distracting thoughts, he tightly closed his eyes, spread his arms, and focused entirely on absorbing the Star Essence.</p><p>"Screech!"</p><p>The Azure Phoenix Dharma Manifestation let out long cries, devoid of pain, filled only with unwavering resolve.</p><p>It raised its proud head, spread its wings wide, embracing the starlight, soaring against the current of the Silver River, like a moth drawn to a flame.</p><p>The Silver River stripped the luster from its feathers.</p><p>Its last feather broke away.</p><p>Then, its skin and flesh were also washed away, its body on the verge of annihilation within the Silver River.</p><p>The swirling broken feathers, like the phoenix's embers, were tragically beautiful and heroic.</p><p>Qin Sang's true body wasn't faring much better.  His entire body was covered in streaks of light, like cracks in his flesh.</p><p>His physical body was being torn apart by the Silver River, starlight penetrating the fissures. It felt as if he was about to shatter completely.</p><p>These torn areas were the weak points of his physical body, previously untempered, now exposed. The Star Essence would refine these weaknesses anew, but this also came with great danger.</p><p>The slightest misstep could lead to destruction.</p><p>Despite this, Qin Sang showed no sign of stopping the Heavenly River Reversal Killing Formation.  He even did the opposite, increasing the formation's power, as if determined to destroy himself.</p><p>‘Rumble…'</p><p>Gu Yun Sou, on his way, paused, stunned by the celestial phenomenon in the west.</p><p>A Silver River spanned the heavens and earth, connecting the nine heavens above and the nine earths below, a magnificent spectacle.</p><p>“Does testing the power of a Spirit Formation require such a grand display? Could it be a powerful enemy attacking?”</p><p>Gu Yun Sou muttered to himself, accelerating his flight.</p><p>At this moment, the starlight above Qingyang View's secluded peak blocked out the sky. Qin Sang and his Azure Phoenix Dharma Manifestation had vanished within the Silver River, seemingly shattered and reduced to dust, washed away completely.</p><p>Xiao Wu's expression was grave. The Heavenly Eye Butterfly also ceased its flight, nervously watching the sky.</p><p>Within the Silver River.</p><p>Qin Sang was immersed in a profound state.</p><p>He no longer attempted to locate the target but instead clung tightly to that faint connection.</p><p>This thread of connection proved his existence, and the existence of his Azure Phoenix Dharma Manifestation!</p><p>Qin Sang forgot everything.  He didn't know how severe his injuries were, nor did he care whether his Dharma Manifestation had been annihilated.</p><p>As long as this connection remained, the Azure Phoenix Dharma Manifestation lived!</p><p>This was the realization Qin Sang had reached in this critical moment.  Whether it was the right path remained to be seen.</p><p>However, Qin Sang was filled with confidence!</p><p>"Screech!"</p><p>From the depths of the Silver River, a long-awaited phoenix cry suddenly resounded.</p><p>This cry was very faint, like the first cry of a newborn phoenix, a celestial melody.</p><p>Xiao Wu's tense expression relaxed. He couldn't help but pat the Heavenly Eye Butterfly, glanced towards the east, and flew out of the secluded peak, leaving the butterfly behind.</p><p>Ripples spread through the starry river, a faint azure light emerging.</p><p>As soon as the azure light appeared, it grew rapidly, revealing the outline of an Azure Phoenix.</p><p>Qin Sang's figure appeared alongside the phoenix, his aura fluctuating wildly, as if impacting some crucial point.</p><p>Suddenly, after a momentary silence,</p><p>Accompanied by a phoenix cry, Qin Sang finally broke through the barrier, undergoing a transformation, successfully stepping into the sixth level of the *Celestial Demon Physique Refinement Scripture*!</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>Starlight surged as a true Azure Phoenix burst forth from the Silver River, soaring through the void.</p><p>It stretched its wings freely, its azure feathers scattering a clear radiance, appearing majestic and divine with every glance.</p><p>Qin Sang stabilized his surging blood and Qi, opened his eyes, and looked at the Azure Phoenix with satisfaction and a touch of emotion.</p><p>This time, he had truly broken through to the Void Refinement realm through his own power.  Previously, he had been forcibly imbued.</p><p>His cultivation technique had advanced, his Dharma Manifestation was complete.  The Azure Phoenix Dharma Manifestation no longer held any trace of illusion, appearing like a true Azure Phoenix.</p><p>It had to be said, his earlier creation of the *Hidden Bone Scripture* and decades of cultivating it had been the right move.</p><p>The accumulation of those years had laid a solid foundation, increasing his ability to endure the pain of Star Essence infusion, allowing him to focus entirely on sensing that connection and achieving this breakthrough.</p><p>Without the *Hidden Bone Scripture*, he might not have failed, but it certainly would have been far more difficult.</p><p>With his successful breakthrough, the Heavenly River Reversal Killing Formation ceased its operation, and the celestial phenomenon gradually dissipated.</p><p>On a mountain outside the secluded peak, Gu Yun Sou, stopped by Xiao Wu, stood watching.</p><p>He saw the starlight above the secluded peak gradually disperse, the Silver River receding, the starry sky returning to normal.</p><p>Gu Yun Sou was somewhat puzzled. “Fellow Daoist Xiao Wu, what was Fellow Daoist Qing Feng doing?”</p><p>He was certain Qingyang View wasn't testing a formation, but with Xiao Wu watching him, he couldn't openly investigate. Based on the aura he sensed, he couldn't quite grasp the situation.</p><p>“This poor Daoist gained some insight into the Heavenly River Reversal Killing Formation and couldn't wait to test it, causing Fellow Daoist concern,” Qin Sang's slightly weary voice drifted over.</p><p>Hearing this, even if Gu Yun Sou had suspicions, he couldn't press further. He simply said, “It’s good that Fellow Daoist is unharmed.”</p><p>“This poor Daoist is eager to enter seclusion and cannot invite Fellow Daoist in for a visit. Please forgive me. My insights can also be applied to the formation in reverse.  In the next two years, this poor Daoist intends to improve it slightly, so everyone can rest assured. I'll trouble Fellow Daoist to inform the two Sect Masters.  Two years from now, we'll go to the Azure Sky Grotto Heaven to set up the formation together,” Qin Sang continued.</p><p>Gu Yun Sou nodded.  “Gu He Yuan and Shang Ling Yuan should be almost ready. Two years from now will be the perfect time.  This old man must also return to prepare. I won't disturb Fellow Daoist any longer."</p><p>With that, Gu Yun Sou cupped his hands and departed in a streak of light.</p><p>In the Twilight Mountains, countless cultivators were still gazing at the horizon. Seeing no further celestial phenomena, they uneasily returned to their caves to cultivate.</p><p>"Is this going to happen every hundred and eighty years? This life is truly unbearable!" someone complained, considering whether to move away, far from this place of turmoil.</p><p>…</p><p>Qingyang View's secluded peak.</p><p>After dismissing his disciples, Qin Sang sat in meditation on the mountain peak, his Azure Phoenix Dharma Manifestation circling above his head.</p><p>Qin Sang was experiencing the changes brought about by his breakthrough.</p><p>His physical body had undoubtedly undergone a transformation, but the greatest change was in his Azure Phoenix Dharma Manifestation.</p><p>Previously, it was merely an illusory image.  Now, it was a true Dharma Manifestation, possessing the formidable power of the Void Refinement realm.</p><p>From now on, in combat, with his Dharma Body and Dharma Manifestation working together, it would be like two against one.  Cultivators of the same realm would likely find it difficult to withstand him.</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't in a hurry to test the power of his Dharma Manifestation.  He was most interested in what exactly resonated with it.</p><p>After the breakthrough, the connection had become somewhat clearer, but even after trying for a long time, Qin Sang still couldn't pinpoint its source.</p><p>"Could it be…"</p><p>A thought struck Qin Sang. He recalled the events of his breakthrough.  Could there be such a thing as a Natal Star?</p><p>After pondering for a moment, Qin Sang rubbed his Thousand Jun Ring and retrieved the bone flute.</p><p>Drawing his Azure Phoenix Dharma Manifestation close to the bone flute, the fog obscuring the sixth level of the cultivation technique slowly dissipated, revealing profound verses that flowed into his mind!</p><p>Qin Sang calmed his mind, scanned the verses, and his expression shifted. “Indeed!”</p><p>The scripture didn't mention Natal Stars but did detail the essential cultivation practices after reaching Void Refinement. One must grasp that faint, ethereal connection, continuously refining it until the target is locked, and one's Dharma Manifestation and the target's Qi become intertwined.</p><p>"What exactly is the target?  A bright star? A dark star? Or some unknown, mysterious existence?"</p><p>Qin Sang didn't find the answer in the scripture.</p><p>He guessed it was most likely one of the first two.  The first few levels of the *Celestial Demon Physique Refinement Scripture* could be summarized as Star Essence Body Refinement.  This step must also be related to the Dao of the Stars.</p><p>From passively receiving starlight to actively seeking a star, finding an anchor point for oneself in the vast starry sky, never to be lost again, and relying on this connection to draw upon even more vast and refined Star Essence power.</p><p>Having determined his future cultivation path, Qin Sang stopped dwelling on it. With further cultivation, it would surely become clearer.</p><p>Gently stroking the bone flute, Qin Sang noticed that fog still lingered beyond the sixth level.</p><p>This indicated that the *Celestial Demon Physique Refinement Scripture* was at least a cultivation technique reaching the Body Integration realm.</p><p>Putting away the bone flute, Qin Sang focused his mind on his Dharma Manifestation, experiencing its divine abilities and power.</p><p>The moment the thought arose, Qin Sang immediately sensed the difference.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>Phoenix wings suddenly unfolded from his back, feathers rustling, azure arcs of lightning dancing between them.</p><p>Not only the surface lightning, but the Azure Phoenix True Lightning hidden deep within the wings was also stirring!</p><p>“As expected, completing the Dharma Manifestation aids in controlling the Azure Phoenix True Lightning!”</p><p>Qin Sang's heart leaped with joy. Lightning flickered at the base of the wings, then a tiny bolt of azure lightning shot out, landing in his palm.</p><p>The azure lightning, like a small insect, wriggled in Qin Sang's hand, yet contained terrifying energy.</p><p>Qin Sang closed and opened his hand, the lightning darting between his fingers. Previously, even if he could summon the Azure Phoenix True Lightning, he wouldn't dare to toy with it like this.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang circulated the Palm Lightning Viewing Technique, and as expected, it was much easier.</p><p>At the same time, Qin Sang discovered that the rank of the Azure Phoenix True Lightning was indeed extremely high. He could manipulate it, but due to his newly formed Dharma Manifestation, there was still a sense of sluggishness.  Both the amount he could control and the power he could unleash had significant room for improvement.</p><p>However, with the Azure Phoenix Dharma Manifestation and the Palm Lightning Viewing Technique, he should be able to barely utilize Lightning Talismans.</p><p>He immediately put his thought into action.</p><p>Qin Sang carefully channeled the Azure Phoenix True Lightning, silently circulating the Five Thunders Heavenly Heart True Seal Talisman.</p><p>Thunder rumbled and lightning flashed in the night sky.</p><p>Amidst the dancing lightning, thin threads of azure lightning, though small, were extremely conspicuous.</p><p>Qin Sang continued to experiment, thunder booming in the sky for a long time, finally converging towards the center, barely forming a Five Thunders Heavenly Heart True Seal.</p><p>Sensing the power within the lightning seal, Qin Sang's expression shifted, secretly astonished.</p><p>After completing his Azure Phoenix Dharma Manifestation, Qin Sang could estimate the approximate power of the Sun Wheel Seal without testing it. The Five Thunders Heavenly Heart True Seal formed using Azure Phoenix True Lightning, once he mastered its use, would likely be no less powerful than the Sun Wheel Seal!</p><p>The strength of cultivating both Dharma and physical body was evident.</p><p>Until the Four Symbols Sword Formation was complete, and until he thoroughly comprehended the Lightning Oath Chapter and could cast it independently without the Lightning Altar… the Sun Wheel Seal and the Five Thunders Heavenly Heart True Seal Talisman would be his two greatest trump cards. The improvement brought by this breakthrough was beyond imagination.</p><p>Just as Qin Sang was secretly pleased, he suddenly noticed something else and frowned slightly.</p><p>A moment later, Qin Sang's eyes flashed.  His Lightning Escape technique had transformed once again, but apart from that, he hadn't comprehended any other divine abilities.</p><p>Qin Sang had thought he would at least comprehend one of the Azure Phoenix's divine abilities.</p><p>After carefully pondering and combining it with the scripture, Qin Sang gained some understanding.</p><p>After entering the sixth level of the *Celestial Demon Physique Refinement Scripture*, normal cultivation should involve actively merging one's own blood essence and Qi with the Dharma Manifestation, a step he had instinctively avoided.</p><p>Qin Sang suspected that if he did so, he might comprehend new divine abilities.</p><p>But what would he ultimately become?</p><p>Would he abandon his human form and transform into an Azure Phoenix?</p><p>As long as he could become stronger, if he had no other recourse, he wouldn't mind whether he was human or not.</p><p>But he had the *Purple Star Sword Scripture*, leading directly to the Great Ascension realm through the Great Ascension Killing Dao.  He also had two chess pieces that even Void Refinement cultivators couldn't understand, possibly containing the Dao of Yin and Yang.  He also had the Qilin Origin Seed incubating, and perhaps he could even walk the path of a Spirit Cultivator in the future…</p><p>He had too many choices; it wasn't time to put all his eggs in one basket.</p><p>"If I don't do this, will it leave hidden dangers, making it impossible to break through to the seventh level, or perhaps even encountering a bottleneck earlier and becoming stagnant?"</p><p>Qin Sang muttered to himself, knowing this was highly possible.</p><p>At this moment, the fork in the Dao reappeared before him!</p>
