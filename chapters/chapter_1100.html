<h1>Chapter 192: Sword Spirit</h1><p>“Cultivating essence, body, and spirit simultaneously would undoubtedly offer immense benefits. However, the resources, effort, and difficulty involved are far greater than simply triple the effort of cultivating a single aspect. Moreover, the Heavenly Tribulation hangs over one's head like a sword – advance, or perish.  Who would dare to divide their attention? Perhaps it was possible in the ancient cultivation world, but in our current era, with the loss of secret techniques and the depletion of resources, it's virtually impossible for anyone to achieve this. That's why most cultivators choose the easier path of spiritual cultivation, making spiritual roots the sole criterion for measuring a cultivator's talent.”</p><p>Qingzhu shared his insights.</p><p>“When I was transported to the Boundless Sea, I was just a step away from Nascent Soul formation. However, due to the fragmentation of my killing intent and the severe damage to my primordial spirit, I spent over a hundred years desperately seeking ways to heal before I finally, and with great difficulty, formed my Nascent Soul. This shows that any damage to essence, energy, or spirit will have repercussions, and vice versa. The Soul Cleansing Solution’s remarkable efficacy operates on the same principle.”</p><p>Qin Sang pondered this.</p><p>The Nine Phantasmal Sky Orchid and Soul Cleansing Solution were external aids.</p><p>The Celestial Eye Butterfly, once it reached the peak of its third transformation, could also help break through bottlenecks.</p><p>Unconsciously, he had already gathered so many methods to aid in Nascent Soul formation.</p><p>If what Qingzhu said was true, it seemed he would need to place equal importance on the “Demonic Refinement of the Physical Body” and the “Primordial Spirit Sword Nurturing Chapter”.</p><p>Qin Sang thought.</p><p>Once he cultivated the "Demonic Refinement of the Physical Body" to the peak of the third level, with the help of Stellar Essence Infusion, he might be able to directly break through to the fourth level.</p><p>By then, his physical body alone would be no weaker than a Nascent Soul cultivator, which would certainly be a great advantage.</p><p>The Foundation Establishment and Golden Core stages had given Qin Sang a taste of the hardships of cultivating with five spiritual roots.</p><p>He only had one Nine Phantasmal Sky Orchid, unlike the Soul Cleansing Solution, which continued to be effective after consumption. He would definitely have to wait until there was no chance of failure before using it.</p><p>After offering Qin Sang some guidance, Qingzhu returned to the main topic.</p><p>“Do you know that the ‘Primordial Spirit Sword Nurturing Chapter’ is hidden within the Violet Palace, in a place similar to the Nether Valley? When the ancestor of Mount Shaohua obtained the ‘Primordial Spirit Sword Nurturing Chapter’, he also discovered a fragment of a spirit sword. Only those who have mastered this cultivation method can gain the recognition of the spirit sword fragment. Even Duke Dongyang couldn't control this treasure, so the spirit sword fragment eventually fell into my hands.”</p><p>“Senior, you mean…”</p><p>Qin Sang almost held his breath.</p><p>“Precisely!”</p><p>Qingzhu didn’t keep him in suspense. “If nothing goes wrong, the other part of the ‘Primordial Spirit Sword Nurturing Chapter’ should be hidden within the Nether Valley. Whether it's the second part or not, we'll only know once we obtain it.  Back then, I had racked my brains and found it extremely difficult to further deduce the cultivation method. I was overjoyed to discover the Nether Valley.  Unexpectedly, the valley is protected by extremely dangerous ancient restrictions, which only a Nascent Soul Grand Ancestor has the power to break…”</p><p>As they spoke, they arrived at the Sword Qi Hall outside the Nether Valley.</p><p>“Entering a treasure mountain, yet leaving empty-handed.”</p><p>Qingzhu’s face was filled with regret. “To make matters worse, by severing my primordial spirit and forcibly cultivating the technique, I caused the killing intent to continuously accumulate, giving rise to a demonic soul. After being severely injured this time, the demonic soul finally found an opportunity.  Stimulated by the sword qi within this hall, the demonic soul lashed out, nearly causing me to lose control.  In the end, I was forced to use the spirit sword fragment to barely seal the demonic soul within this hall. I thought this place was rarely visited, but unexpectedly, the ancient demon sealed beneath the mountain influenced the demonic soul, leading to numerous incidents and leaving behind this calamity…”</p><p>Qin Sang carefully protected Qingzhu as he listened to his detailed account.</p><p>“After sealing the demonic soul, I barely escaped the Seven Killing Hall, only to discover I had arrived in an unfamiliar cultivation world. I traveled extensively and finally chose Spirit Turtle Island. I rarely interacted with other sects and remained there in seclusion, healing my injuries while attempting to form my Nascent Soul.”</p><p>“For the next hundred years, because I couldn’t enter the inner hall to retrieve the demonic soul, I could only try various methods, including teaching and cultivating disciples, to gain enlightenment through tranquility.  By sheer luck, I managed to forcefully break through despite the damage to my primordial spirit. However, this planted the seeds for future troubles. I must retrieve the demonic soul; otherwise, my cultivation path will be incredibly difficult.”</p><p>“Decades later, the Seven Killing Hall reappeared. I intended to subdue the demonic soul, retrieve the spirit sword fragment and the cultivation method, and then return to the Small Cold Realm to seek revenge and reunite with my friends and family. Alas, fate had other plans.”</p><p>Qingzhu sighed deeply.</p><p>Qin Sang knew they were approaching the most crucial part.</p><p>Why did he appear in the Sorcerer-God Continent?</p><p>What happened to Qingzhu?</p><p>All would be revealed.</p><p>Qingzhu looked at Qin Sang with an unreadable expression. “After the Seven Killing Hall reappeared, I first entered the trial grounds left by the Four Saints and then successfully reached the Nether Valley. Just as I was about to subdue the demonic soul, I discovered it was missing! Unexpectedly, you were then transported from the Violet Palace.  All my plans were disrupted by you and the sword spirit within you.”</p><p>“Sword spirit?”</p><p>Qin Sang was stunned for a moment, then realized that Qingzhu was likely referring to the grey qi within his body.</p><p>“Is it the sword spirit of the spirit sword fragment? Wasn’t it placed inside me by Senior after I arrived at the Seven Killing Hall?”</p><p>Qin Sang’s face was full of surprise.</p><p>This was completely different from what he had guessed.</p><p>Qingzhu was taken aback and shook his head. “Why would I create trouble for myself? The sword spirit within you sensed the spirit sword fragment upon arriving at the Seven Killing Hall and attempted to draw the fragment back. This caused an anomaly in the spirit sword fragment within the demonic soul. By then, the demonic soul had already been released by the ancient demon and had possessed a new body. Moreover, his cultivation was far superior to my original body’s.  Fortunately, the seal on the spirit sword fragment hadn’t been broken, and his memories hadn’t returned. The sword spirit's attempt to draw the fragment led the demonic soul here, and he nearly discovered the restrictions of the Sword Qi Hall and the Nether Valley…”</p><p>Qingzhu gently pressed his hand against the wall of the Sword Qi Hall, revealing an illusory door.</p><p>The two passed through the restriction and entered the Nether Valley.</p><p>Qingzhu glanced back and said, “I originally intended to forcibly subdue the sword spirit, but it possesses remarkable intelligence and had already recovered some of its power. After discovering me, it hid within your body and led you into hiding. If the demonic soul had found the Nether Valley and the ancient teleportation formation, regained his memories, and unleashed his killing intent, the situation would have been irreversible.  In desperation, I had no choice but to use a Minor Displacement Talisman to forcibly send you out of the Seven Killing Hall, severing the connection between the sword spirit and the spirit sword fragment.”</p><p>“I woke up and found myself in the Sorcerer-God Continent. Was it Senior who sent me away with the Minor Displacement Talisman? The sword spirit is within my body, so why has it always remained in the form of grey qi and taken no action for a hundred years?”</p><p>Listening to Qingzhu’s account, Qin Sang felt as if he were hearing a fantastical tale.</p><p>While he was severely injured and unconscious, the sword spirit had actually taken control of his body and so much had happened.</p><p>“Indeed. The Minor Displacement Talisman was an ancient talisman of extraordinary origin that I stumbled upon within the Immortal Restriction above. Upon activation, it can instantly transport one to another location, allowing escape from danger. It's a life-saving treasure, but the direction and destination of the teleportation are uncontrollable. In this instance, you were most likely to be transported to the depths of the Storm Belt, with slim chances of survival.  However, at the time, seeing your body surrounded by corpse qi, I assumed you were already dead.”</p><p>Qingzhu speculated, “Now it seems that the Minor Displacement Talisman was likely influenced by the sword spirit, sending you to the relatively safe Sorcerer-God Continent.  The sword spirit must have paid a great price for this, falling into a deep slumber. Otherwise, when the Sorcerer Tribe first opened the Seven Killing Hall, both the demonic soul and I were present.  Had the sword spirit activated the spirit sword fragment, your identity would have been exposed to the demonic soul.”</p>
