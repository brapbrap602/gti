<h1>Chapter 1629: Opportunity</h1><p>Chapter 1629: Opportunity</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>Yu Yan Fei Liu collided with the golden armor, waves surging and creating a thousand ripples.</p><p>After the collision, the golden armor violently shook, suddenly emitting a golden light, fast as an arrow, exceptionally sharp, penetrating Yu Yan Fei Liu.</p><p>Zhu Wu Dao, clad in battle armor, approached step by step, his momentum like a rainbow.</p><p>The vast smoke and waves stagnated, a path was abruptly plowed through the middle by the golden light, directly aimed at He Gao Zhenren.</p><p>Zhu Wu Dao was unharmed, the power of his battle armor was evident.</p><p>He Gao Zhenren's eyes narrowed slightly, but he didn't panic. He faced Zhu Wu Dao directly, having already deduced various possibilities.  Yu Yan Fei Liu seemed vulnerable, but it was intentional.</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>A crane shadow appeared behind He Gao Zhenren.</p><p>The immortal crane stretched its neck and let out a long cry, its posture graceful.</p><p>With the crane shadow appearing, He Gao Zhenren instantly rose several meters, almost touching the top of the ancient hall, avoiding the golden light's attack.</p><p>He chanted an incantation and changed tactics.</p><p>The momentum of Yu Yan Fei Liu suddenly dropped, as if transitioning from a rushing river to a tranquil autumn lake, light smoke swirling; the extremely rigid power turned extremely soft. The smoke filled the air, transforming into countless silk threads, layer upon layer, winding towards Zhu Wu Dao.</p><p>Simultaneously, purple electric light illuminated the space around the teleportation array, brightening Zhu Wu Dao's eyes, causing him to squint.</p><p>Five purple thunderbolts struck at once.</p><p>Looking at the thunderbolts, Qin Sang felt a slight stinging in his eyes, even though the thunder pythons weren't aimed at him.</p><p>At a critical moment, a white light suddenly arrived.</p><p>Mo Xing Dao's internal energy, cultivated for many years, was no ordinary force; it broke through the air and appeared directly above the path of the five thunder pythons.</p><p>With the internal energy's impact, the purple thunderbolts showed a tendency to solidify.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Zi Lei Zhenren made no attempt to remedy the situation. The thunder python's body violently swayed, using its overwhelming thunder power to forcefully break through the internal energy blockade.</p><p>Mo Xing Dao hesitated no longer, formed his hand into a knife, and made a swift cut in the air. His internal energy followed!</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>The five thunder pythons had their heads severed.</p><p>The latter half of the thunder pythons stiffened and collapsed, but the front segments remained swift, and Mo Xing Dao was powerless to stop them.</p><p>At this time, Mo Xing Dao finally realized that Zi Lei Zhenren's goal wasn't to destroy the teleportation array, but to directly target Zhu Wu Dao, purely to stop him.</p><p>This didn't match their expectations.</p><p>Mo Xing Dao couldn't help but be somewhat surprised.</p><p>On the other side.</p><p>Zi Lei Zhenren flew towards the teleportation array but was blocked by the red flowers of Qi Ling Dongzhu.</p><p>*Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!*</p><p>The flower shadows were like butterflies, beautiful and enchanting.</p><p>In an instant, a field of flowers was constructed in mid-air.</p><p>Beauty concealed killing intent.</p><p>Zi Lei Zhenren's escape technique did not diminish, the thunder light on his forehead blazed, revealing a thunder seal.</p><p>The seal was entirely forged from thunder power, radiating misty thunder light.  The internal thunder patterns flowed, and with their gathering and dispersal, the thunder light surged.</p><p>Seeing the seal, Qi Ling Dongzhu's expression changed.  It seemed the seal was an extraordinary divine ability.</p><p>Qi Ling Dongzhu changed his hand seals repeatedly, but it was already too late to respond.</p><p>Thunder roared, the seal transformed into a thunder cocoon, and a thunderbolt even more terrifying than the previous pythons broke through the air, destroying the flower shadows with devastating force.</p><p>Qi Ling Dongzhu roared, his eyes flashing with blood.</p><p>Among the collapsing flower shadows, the light in the center of the petals twisted, and pained human faces appeared—clearly evil spirit flowers.</p><p>Evil spirits roared, the flower shadows stabilized, and for a time, hundreds of ghosts ran rampant, baring their fangs and claws to counterattack Zi Lei Zhenren.</p><p>Qin Sang and Yue Ling Tian had also exchanged blows several times.</p><p>The three-legged cauldron's ability was very peculiar. The sword threads in the sword array, when illuminated by the cauldron's mouth, felt a delay and were directly absorbed into the cauldron. Qin Sang found that his connection with these sword threads was severed.</p><p>"Let's see how much you can absorb!"</p><p>Qin Sang sneered inwardly, pushing the sword array to its limit.</p><p>At the same time, the fire lotus rotated in his palm.</p><p>While engaging with Yue Ling Tian, Qin Sang's focus was elsewhere. Having noticed Qi Ling Dongzhu couldn't withstand Zi Lei Zhenren, he considered lending a hand.</p><p>At this moment, the actions of Zhu Wu Dao and Zi Lei Zhenren were both unusual, clearly about to use divine abilities to fight for the teleportation array.</p><p>Then, the teleportation light extinguished before them.</p><p>Everyone's movements stopped abruptly when the teleportation light went out.</p><p>Space froze, just like their gazes.</p><p>By this point, all changes in the teleportation array had been witnessed by everyone. In full view, even Zi Lei Zhenren and Zhu Wu Dao, closest to the teleportation array, had no chance to tamper with it, yet the teleportation array's light simply died out.</p><p>The spatial fluctuations also disappeared.</p><p>What did this mean?</p><p>A deathly silence fell within the hall.</p><p>Qin Sang clenched his fist, put away the fire lotus that was about to burst forth, silently paused, stared at the teleportation array, his expression strange.</p><p>Zi Lei Zhenren and Zhu Wu Dao stared at each other across the teleportation array.</p><p>Zhu Wu Dao's expression froze.  Zi Lei Zhenren wasn't faring any better.</p><p>The others looked at the two of them in bewilderment, waiting for an explanation.</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>Zi Lei Zhenren activated a new spirit stone.</p><p>Zhu Wu Dao's expression flickered, but he didn't stop him.</p><p>The others also stopped fighting, watching with a sense of absurdity.</p><p>After a chaotic battle, some were about to use their trump cards, yet they were fighting over a damaged spirit array?</p><p>The old spirit stone was pried out of the teleportation array's aperture. The stone's inner glow hadn't faded, indicating its energy wasn't depleted.</p><p>The new spirit stone was inserted, reactivating the array.</p><p>The ancient hall trembled; cracks multiplied.</p><p>Spatial fluctuations reappeared, but the good times were short-lived.  A violent flicker, and the result was the same!</p><p>The teleportation light, carrying everyone's hopes, died out, their hearts sinking.</p><p>Yet the spirit array was running smoothly, showing no damage.</p><p>Those present were all top-tier experts, incredibly rare in the world; they couldn't be mistaken.</p><p>"Daoist Zhu, what's going on?"</p><p>Qi Ling Dongzhu's face was grim.  He had agreed to get involved in this mess, partly because of the Immortal Palace. He had run around for it, and even suffered consequences, injured by the Poison King.</p><p>Was all this effort going to be in vain?</p><p>Mo Xing Dao's reaction was less obvious. He hadn't known what treasures were in the Immortal Palace; his entry was a gamble, so his hopes weren't high, and neither was his disappointment.</p><p>Zhu Wu Dao's expression changed constantly, clearly unexpected.</p><p>The statue in his sleeve was burning hot, scorching his mind.</p><p>Zhu Wu Dao's lips twitched in bitterness, mocking himself inwardly.  He had plotted and schemed, yet hadn't foreseen this.</p><p>For whom had he toiled so hard?</p><p>"We can only ask the Daoist masters," Zhu Wu Dao seemed to understand something, suddenly raising his head to question Zi Lei Zhenren, "What exactly did you do in Tian Tong Hall to destroy the teleportation array!"</p><p>Tian Tong Hall.</p><p>Qin Sang's heart stirred; the South Sea Immortal Palace was indeed his target!</p><p>Zi Lei Zhenren remained silent; his worst fears had come true.</p><p>By now, Zi Lei Zhenren understood; he suspected he'd blamed the wrong party.  It wasn't the Buddhist sect that had harmed Dan Yu Zhenjun, but some unknown incident at the Immortal Palace.</p><p>The situation was even worse than he'd anticipated: the path to the Immortal Palace was blocked!</p><p>The Zhenjun and Hui Guang Shengzhe had encountered an accident at the Immortal Palace, but the truth was beyond comprehension.</p><p>"Only Daoists, no Buddhist disciples—you intended to enter the Immortal Palace secretly, hiding it from the Buddhists!"  Recalling Zi Lei Zhenren's earlier actions, Zhu Wu Dao gradually grasped the truth, his speech quickening. "Have the Daoists and Buddhists turned against each other? Or is there a reason you had to enter the Immortal Palace?  Is the disappearance of the Nascent Soul cultivators related to the Immortal Palace?"</p><p>Zi Lei Zhenren couldn't answer a single question.</p><p>He Gao Zhenren's eyes held worry; the teleportation array's failure had cut off the road to the Sword Tomb.</p><p>Yue Ling Tian, however, stared directly at Zi Lei Zhenren without reservation.</p><p>Had Zi Lei Zhenren anticipated this beforehand?</p><p>Had the Immortal Palace already suffered some catastrophe?  Had he tolerated the remnants of the Wu Xiang Immortal Sect because the normal path was blocked?  With the Immortal Palace inaccessible, what did Zi Lei Zhenren's previous promises, and the Tai Yue Sect's recent sacrifices, amount to?</p><p>Yue Ling Tian clenched his fists secretly.</p><p>Zi Lei Zhenren, with his silver hair and youthful face, possessed the air of a grandmaster.  Even now, he maintained composure, shouting, "Tian Tong Hall is a place of demonic sealing! The Demon Lord's terror is described in ancient texts, passed down as ancestral precepts to both sects:  only Tian Xiang Hall could be explored, Tian Tong Hall's prohibitions were inviolable.  Among those present, only you, Master Zhu, had the ability to tamper with things secretly.  Are you trying to shake us off and enter the Immortal Palace alone, then dare to turn this around on us!?"</p><p>There was some truth to this claim.</p><p>Zhu Wu Dao had deep roots with the Wu Xiang Immortal Sect and understood them thoroughly.  He had personally opened the ancient hall and the teleportation array; only he had the capability to deceive everyone.</p><p>In this situation, even the cunning old foxes in the ancient hall couldn't determine the truth.</p><p>Though Yue Ling Tian suspected the eight scenic spots of ill intent, lacking evidence he didn't speak of it, maintaining a stance of shared fate with Zi Lei Zhenren.</p><p>Zhu Wu Dao's lips moved; it was unclear what he transmitted, but Qi Ling Dongzhu and Mo Xing Dao both looked hesitant.</p><p>At that moment.</p><p>A sword's hum echoed through the ancient hall, startling everyone. Qin Sang had suddenly retracted his sword array.</p><p>Sword light drew everyone's eyes, shooting into Qin Sang's sleeve and disappearing.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang, without a word, ignoring all transmissions, withdrew from the battle, swiftly exiting the hall and fleeing down the mountain without looking back.</p><p>Those in the ancient hall wore various expressions, struggling to recall any mysterious experts, each suspecting the other of bringing them, only to find the other equally thoughtful, increasing their confusion.</p><p>Qin Sang had been on the periphery, without deep enmity with either side, and nobody stopped him.</p><p>He arrived and departed swiftly, unconcerned with the outcome.  His speed and decisiveness surprised everyone; they didn't even know Qin Sang's name.</p><p>On the stone path.</p><p>Qin Sang fled down the mountain.</p><p>"Judging by Purple Thunder's tone," Qin Sang mused, "the Heavenly Harmony and Heavenly Concord Palaces were once controlled by the Wu Xiang Sect, both located in Central State and interconnected.  Purple Micro Palace and Seven Killing Palace, however, were independent…"</p><p>These palaces all held sealed fragments of the killing sword, indicating a connection. Before descending to this realm, they were likely a single palace.  The Heavenly Harmony and Heavenly Concord Palaces were clear evidence of this.</p><p>Earlier, Qin Sang had subtly used his celestial eye to analyze the teleportation array, confirming that its restrictions were undamaged.  Zhu Wu Dao could hardly have tampered with it undetected; the problem must have originated from the other side.</p><p>Zhu Wu Dao and Purple Thunder's expressions and actions clearly indicated an unforeseen incident at the palace!</p><p>They were unaware of the truth, but Qin Sang knew. He had witnessed the palace's ascension!</p><p>Upon learning of the Heavenly Harmony and Heavenly Concord Palaces, Qin Sang suspected that when Purple Micro Palace ascended, other palaces might have been drawn along, and he was right.</p><p>This explained the disappearance of the Nascent Soul cultivators.</p><p>Liuli's master was trapped in Purple Micro Palace and ascended with it.  If those Nascent Soul cultivators were drawn in by the palace's ascension, and were too slow to react, they were likely taken to another realm.</p><p>He remembered that even Yuan Ying stage cultivators who failed to escape Purple Micro Palace were crushed into pulp. Nascent Soul cultivators, with their vast powers, possessed much greater survival skills.</p><p>The palace ascended.</p><p>The remaining cultivators could only vie for the Wu Xiang Sect's opportunities.</p><p>No fewer than ten Grand Cultivators had entered the fray.</p><p>If not for Yun Long's intervention, even more Yuan Ying cultivators would have entered the Wu Xiang Sect.  The treasures here were limited, probably insufficient for everyone; it was a race against time.</p><p>The same applied to Qin Sang. His only hope lay in the Wu Xiang Sect's scripture repository; he only hoped they had preserved the fragmented cultivation techniques.</p><p>Seeing the imminent conflict, Qin Sang knew there was no point in lingering, and acted decisively!</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The stone path trembled, the restrictions faltered, and rocks tumbled from the cliff face.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced back.  Brilliant lights flashed from the cliff top, where several Grand Cultivators were locked in fierce battle. The ancient palace, finally unable to withstand the assault, completely collapsed.</p><p>He also guessed that Purple Thunder's insistence on capturing Zhu Wu Dao was not solely about questioning the changes to the teleportation array.  If they truly could not enter the palace, Zhu Wu Dao, being the most knowledgeable person about the Wu Xiang Sect, possessed valuable intelligence.</p><p>The Eight Scenic View Sect had the manpower and ability to do this.</p><p>If Zhu Wu Dao couldn't persuade the Weeping Spirit Cave Master and Mo Xing Dao to assist him, his chances of survival were slim.</p><p>Considering the situation, Qin Sang fled at high speed, escaping the cliff and flying into the mountains, following the path his clone had taken.  He was unaware of the battle's outcome.</p><p>His goal was clear: the core area of the Wu Xiang Sect.</p><p>His clone had paved the way, leaving secret markers along the route.</p><p>Qin Sang's main body effortlessly passed through numerous restrictions, traversing forests and mountains.</p><p>In the distance.</p><p>The core area of the Wu Xiang Sect was a prominent peak, still vibrant and majestic despite years of dormancy.</p><p>Each mountain housed pavilions and temples, imbued with a celestial aura.</p><p>The deepest mountain was the most imposing. While not as tall as the cliff, the details were still unclear from afar; its importance within the Wu Xiang Sect was evident.</p><p>Both his main body and clone were heading towards this mountain.</p><p>Unbeknownst to him, this mountain was the seat of the Five Phase Sovereign, known as Di Shou Mountain!</p><p>After traveling an unknown distance.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression shifted slightly. He suddenly altered his course, heading towards the west side of Di Shou Mountain.  Soon, he saw a figure approaching – his external clone.</p><p>His external clone was ahead, its primary task being to locate the scripture repository.</p><p>"Found it!"</p><p>The clone's face lit up.  It gestured towards a distant peak. "There's a jade pavilion within the mountain…"</p><p>He had just glimpsed the inscription on the pavilion's roof plaque from afar and was rushing over when he sensed his main body's arrival.</p><p>Their minds were connected.</p><p>Both the main body and clone understood each other's experiences and decided to jointly head to the jade pavilion.</p><p>Having traveled a short distance, Qin Sang suddenly paused, emitting a soft exclamation, and looked towards the jade pavilion.</p><p>Across several mountain ranges and plains.</p><p>There stood a fairy mountain, its summit ablaze with brilliant aurora, illuminating all directions in breathtaking beauty; clearly a place of great treasure.</p><p>In the depths of the radiant light, a corner of an ice palace was faintly visible, identical to the ice palace formed from the mysterious ice disc!</p>
