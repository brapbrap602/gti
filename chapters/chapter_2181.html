<h1>Chapter 2171:  The Heavenly Emperor's Talisman</h1><p>The two women from Langxian Garden were also their rivals; Qin Sang was naturally pleased to eliminate them beforehand.</p><p>Qin Sang agreed.  The next step was to locate the ornate-robed woman and her spirit beasts.</p><p>"Do you know when they'll separate?"</p><p>Liuli said, "Previously, one controlled the beast formation while the other, usually the woman, fought us under its cover."</p><p>Qin Sang understood. Liuli's plan was to use themselves as bait, revealing their presence to lure the ornate-robed woman.  Simultaneously, Liuli would use the Heavenly Emperor's Command to seize control of the woman's beasts.  While the formation faltered, Qin Sang would launch an ambush.</p><p>The problem was that Le Chen was severely injured, and Liuli, relying on the power of talismans, was still low-level.  Using the Heavenly Emperor's Command might leave her depleted. Any mishap would spell serious trouble.</p><p>"No need for you to lure the enemy. I have a cultivated corpse…"</p><p>Qin Sang changed the plan, deciding to use Min Zhuo as bait instead of Liuli and the others.</p><p>He had a drop of Le Chen's blood.  Injecting it into Min Zhuo would mask his presence as Le Chen.</p><p>The two women rejoiced.  Their original plan was risky; they could only target the woman first, leaving a stronger opponent behind.  Although Master Ning had said Qin Sang was influential and powerful, they couldn't guarantee he could defeat the enemy; there was a significant difference in cultivation levels.</p><p>Using a corpse as bait would give them time to recover, making things safer.</p><p>Qin Sang asked more questions, finalized the plan, and began preparations.</p><p>Their first task was to identify the ornate-robed woman's spirit beasts. This wasn't difficult; the Sky-Eyed Butterflies could detect flaws in the beast formation.  Like minute cracks in a flawless jade, these 'cracks' were caused by the forced merging of two sets of spirit beasts.  Following these 'cracks', they could separate the beasts into two groups.  The difference in cultivation between the two women made identifying the ornate-robed woman's group easy.</p><p>Meanwhile, Qin Sang needed to find the formation's eye. This would allow him to adapt his plan even if the ornate-robed woman suddenly took control, striking at the heart of the formation.</p><p>It wasn't that Qin Sang didn't want to deal with the other woman, but engaging a late-stage Void Refinement expert within an already established formation with the goal of a quick kill was risky. Even with the element of surprise, Qin Sang wasn't confident.  Cultivation heirs from powerful sects always possessed protective treasures; a desperate fight could be costly, especially with Liuli and Le Chen to protect.  It was better to strike at one arm first and then focus on the other woman, killing her if possible, or retreating safely if necessary.</p><p>The three fire cranes flew on, Qin Sang discreetly withdrew and began navigating between the 'cracks'.</p><p>The beasts on either side of the cracks seemed identical – similar cultivation and species, likely trained妖兵 from their sect. Yet, Qin Sang perceived differences in their interconnected spiritual energy.</p><p>Furthermore, Liuli had fought the enemy and witnessed their formation, providing a good starting point, enhancing Qin Sang’s assessment.</p><p>Soon, Qin Sang distinguished the ornate-robed woman's beasts, returned to his position, and found the fire crane controlled by Liuli.</p><p>"Once the corpse is revealed, control the beasts in this area…"</p><p>Qin Sang telepathically instructed Liuli.  He considered this a key node in the formation; destroying it would cause significant disruption.</p><p>After communicating with Liuli, Qin Sang glanced upwards.</p><p>He then quietly moved deeper into the formation, noticing the area the enemy was focusing on had shrunk.</p><p>Reaching the edge of that area, he waited, then summoned Min Zhuo. He crushed the drop of Le Chen's blood, transforming it into a blood mist that seeped into Min Zhuo's body.</p><p>…</p><p>In a mountain cave…</p><p>Liuli and Le Chen sat cross-legged, eyes closed.  A dense grey aura surrounded them like a dark cloud; the transformed Wuyang Dou concealed their presence and masked their auras from enemies.</p><p>Liè Chēn looked pale and unwell; the golden kasaya, his protective treasure, showed dull patches and faint cracks.</p><p>Liú Lí, clad in white, emanated an aura comparable to that of an early Transcendent Realm cultivator, thanks to her Heavenly Emperor Talisman.  She listened intently, then nodded slightly, saying, "Qin Daoyou, be careful!"</p><p>After a brief pause, she exchanged a few words with Liè Chēn before closing her eyes again in meditation.  Moments later, her aura shifted; a brilliant light appeared behind her head.</p><p>The "Heavenly Emperor" referred to the Gōuchén Shanggōng Heavenly Emperor, one of the Four Emperors of Daoism.  Legends of the Four Emperors are widespread in Daoism, not unique to the Talisman Sect; the sect drew inspiration from classic Daoist texts and lore when creating its divine court.  Regardless, the Four Emperors hold immense status in both the Dan Ding and Talisman Sects.</p><p>Qin Sang had witnessed the power of the Four Emperors’ talismans in the Talisman world, aiding Zhang Tianshi in reaching the Mahayana Realm—talismans with Mahayana-level power!  This talisman, invoking the Heavenly Emperor, sought the Emperor's decree.  Even if the Dan Ding and Talisman Sects' inheritances differed, this talisman was undoubtedly exceptional.  Thus, Qin Sang had no doubt Liú Lí could seize the elegantly dressed woman's spirit beast.</p><p>Within the light, wondrous phenomena unfolded: sometimes a vast, deep cosmos; sometimes, majestic, mystical immortal palaces.  Amidst these displays, a shadowy figure emerged, resembling a supreme emperor on his throne, radiating unmatched majesty, inspiring reverence.</p><p>…</p><p>Above the beast formation.</p><p>A white cloud floated, offering a commanding view of the array below.  Two women were on the cloud: the elegantly dressed woman Qin Sang had met, and a seemingly sixteen or seventeen-year-old girl, vivacious and charming in a peach-colored long-sleeved dress.  The elegantly dressed woman stood respectfully beside the girl.</p><p>The girl, in her red dress, sat cross-legged, her fingers moving as if dancing, invisible threads connecting her to the spirit beasts, completely under her control.</p><p>Despite the enemy's confinement, their search had yielded nothing—an unusual situation, yet neither woman showed any anxiety.</p><p>The elegantly dressed woman constantly scanned her surroundings.  While the enemy couldn't escape, the real threat came from other cultivators.  Fortunately, besides a lone Siyou clansman, no other unusual cultivators had passed by.</p><p>The Sacred Land trials were a contest of the Dao; no quarter was given.  A clash could erupt at any moment.  The unusual clans would show no mercy to outsiders.</p><p>Traditionally, Langxian Garden disciples avoided conflict within the Sacred Land, focusing on their tasks.</p><p>Suddenly, the girl's expression changed; her eyes snapped open, flashing with intensity.</p><p>"Found them!"</p><p>The elegantly dressed woman felt it too, a smile touching her lips.</p><p>That fleeting aura, within the beast formation, couldn't escape their senses.  The enemy was revealed; though only one person's aura was detected, they were surely together.</p><p>Without hesitation, the elegantly dressed woman vanished from the cloud.  The girl's fingers shot out ten crimson beams, striking the beast formation like falling fire.</p><p>"Roar!"</p><p>"Roar!"</p><p>…</p><p>The entire beast formation erupted; thousands of beasts roared, their cries shaking the heavens.</p><p>*Rumble…*</p><p>From above, a crimson wind swept across the land, soul-corroding and bone-chilling.  Countless spirit beasts surged towards the source of the aura, forming terrifying currents capable of shattering mountains and reversing rivers.  The pent-up power finally unleashed itself.</p><p>The beast formation’s might focused between two peaks, painting the world crimson.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>The wind blew.</p><p>The two peaks instantly turned to sand, scattering on the wind.  The valley was laid bare.  A violent disturbance appeared in the void, revealing a struggling figure, seemingly trapped in a cage, burdened by a mountain.</p><p>The elegantly dressed woman emerged from the crimson wind, a smile on her lips, ready to attack.  But seeing the figure, her expression changed.</p><p>The one trapped wasn't their target.</p><p>Who was it?</p><p>The elegantly dressed woman sensed a faint deathly aura from the person, like a corpse—perhaps a diversion tactic by the enemy, now exposed.</p><p>A Buddhist monk skilled in necromancy?  Preposterous!  And he'd never summoned anything before.</p><p>The elegantly dressed woman felt a sudden, ominous premonition, which quickly proved true.</p><p>At the exact moment she appeared, deep within the mountain, Liuli completed a spell.  The imperial phantom within the ethereal light seemed to open its eyes, its gaze piercing the light, the mountain, and finally, the mortal world!</p><p>Instantly, all the spirit beasts in the area Qin Sang had designated stopped, a stark contrast to the lively chaos elsewhere.  They looked out of place in the beast formation.</p><p>The beasts became like statues, heads tilted upward, staring rigidly at the sky, utterly motionless and eerily still.</p><p>“No!”</p><p>The two women's faces paled.</p><p>The elegantly dressed woman felt she had lost control of many of her spirit beasts, while the girl in red was alarmed by the formation's upheaval.  She wasn't their master; she controlled them only with the permission of the other woman. Now that control had shifted, she could no longer manipulate the beasts, creating a huge vulnerability in the formation.</p><p>She had fought countless battles, suffered devastating losses of spirit beasts, and experienced humiliating retreats. But those had always been predictable; they could adapt to the situation.  This was different.  Losing control of the beasts—the very foundation of the formation—was like pulling the rug from under them, and with no warning whatsoever. It was unprecedented and beyond their comprehension.</p><p>How could this be?</p><p>No matter how unbelievable it seemed, the reality was undeniable.</p><p>The elegantly dressed woman reacted swiftly.  Realizing something was wrong, she tried to use the beast formation's power to escape, but a blinding golden light seared her eyes.</p><p>A figure materialized, clad in a Taoist robe, a golden sun blazing above his head. The light was dazzling, its power immense.</p><p>They had used the beast formation to trap Min Zhuo.</p><p>Now, the elegantly dressed woman was horrified to find herself trapped by a terrifying force.  With the formation compromised and sluggish, she not only failed to escape but was sealed off from the world by the golden light.</p><p>It was Qin Sang, the sun emblem above his head countering the beast formation, but the true killer was the Grey Warbler Sword!</p><p>The elegantly dressed woman was aghast.  She barely managed to activate her protective garment before the golden light vanished, the fiery energy of the beast formation replaced by a deep void.</p><p>Within that void, there was no up or down.  Terror gripped the woman as she looked up and saw the stars.  They were far denser than in the outside world—Qin Sang had used a layered formation technique!</p><p>Liuli couldn't maintain this indefinitely; the formation master would soon react. The window was closing fast.</p><p>Dragon roars, tiger growls, and a sharp bird cry echoed.</p><p>The stars vibrated, forming three star demons, which coalesced into a brilliant beam of starlight, carrying immense sword intent, descending abruptly!</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>A bright light erupted from the elegantly dressed woman.  Even under the starlight, it shone brilliantly, revealing interconnected hexagonal patterns, like a tortoise shell.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The light was engulfed by starlight, flickering violently before dimming.</p><p>A moment later, a figure burst from the starlight. The elegantly dressed woman, her hair askew, was terrified beyond words.</p><p>The luster of her robe was dulled, a small green shield hovering before her, bearing a deep gash, almost cleaved in two.  It was the Nine-Gang Shield, a protective treasure she'd obtained from her sect for this sacred journey.</p><p>御兽修士 often find themselves the weakest link; enemies will target the master.  They prioritize self-protection. The Nine-Gang Shield, able to sense danger and protect its owner, was a coveted treasure.</p><p>If not for this treasure, she would be dead.  What was even more horrifying was that a single strike had nearly destroyed it!</p><p>Layered formations and the Four-Image Sword Formation had their strengths. The latter excelled at killing, but its ability to contain was significantly weaker. If it failed to kill the enemy, they could escape.</p><p>The elegantly dressed woman, having escaped death, felt utterly demoralized.  She'd discovered a weakness in the sword formation, a glimmer of hope.</p><p>But the next moment, the formation disintegrated, and she saw a sword light.</p><p>Words couldn't describe it.</p><p>The elegantly dressed woman could only watch as the Nine-Gang Shield was pierced by the light, shattering from the wound and falling from her grasp.  Next, her protective garment blazed, only lasting a moment.</p><p>Then, it was her turn.</p><p>She stared blankly at her chest, pierced by the sword light.</p>
