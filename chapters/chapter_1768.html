<h1>Chapter 1759: The Xuanji Sect</h1><p>So-called Orthodox Techniques refer to the techniques bestowed by the two Academies of the Dao Court, also known as Official Techniques.</p><p>In contrast, the techniques imparted by various sects and schools outside the Dao Court are known as Private Techniques.</p><p>Whether Orthodox or Private, they essentially refer to techniques with corresponding cultivation methods, allowing one to commune with the Heavenly Heart and invoke the Guardian Deities corresponding to the specific technique, progressing step by step in cultivation.</p><p>However, according to Qin Sang's understanding, there's another category of techniques within the Daoist world, those either lacking corresponding cultivation methods or unable to connect with their corresponding Guardian Deities.</p><p>The former can cultivate other methods, but because the cultivation method doesn't align with the technique, they can't enjoy most of the benefits the technique offers, making their cultivation and breakthroughs more arduous.</p><p>The latter can only forcefully meditate on other Guardian Deities, and due to the incompatibility, they risk mental instability.</p><p>These are known as Outer Techniques.</p><p>Upon learning this, Qin Sang immediately formed a plan. Obtaining an Outer Technique would clearly be easier.</p><p>His own cultivation method was sufficiently powerful; he didn't want to switch methods unless absolutely necessary, nor did he care about the benefits a technique could bring him.</p><p>With the Jade Buddha protecting his Nascent Soul, Guardian Deities were dispensable.</p><p>In other words, the various disadvantages of Outer Techniques posed no problem for him, as long as the power to stabilize his vital energy remained!</p><p>The more Qin Sang thought about it, the more suitable an Outer Technique seemed.</p><p>However, a damaged technique meant that the original sect's lineage had been broken. Receiving a technique required going through the sect's ancestral altar.  With the lineage broken, where could the ancestral altar be found? Who could bestow the technique upon him?</p><p>The Dao Court might possess this information, but the problem circled back to the beginning: how could he gain the Dao Court's trust to obtain these secrets?</p><p>Regardless, Qin Sang had at least found a feasible path, and not just one.</p><p>As far as he knew, there was also the practice of Supplementary Bestowal within the Dao Court.</p><p>If Daoist cultivators gained the Dao Court's recognition and joined as Immortal Officials, they could even receive a Supplementary Bestowal of an Orthodox Technique if they wished to leave their original sect, truly entering the cultivation hierarchy of the Dao Court's two Academies.</p><p>It sounded similar to being promoted in the secular world.</p><p>However, joining the Dao Court meant rigorous scrutiny. Obtaining a flawless identity was nearly impossible.</p><p>Within the Dao Court, one's actions were not their own.</p><p>Inevitably, numerous mundane affairs would burden him, impacting his cultivation, something Qin Sang didn't desire.</p><p>He was unwilling to expend much energy even on his own creation, the Green Ram Temple, preferring to establish the framework and then become a hands-off leader.</p><p>Coupled with various concerns, he wouldn't compromise unless absolutely necessary.</p><p>As his thoughts churned, a contemplative expression appeared on Qin Sang's face.</p><p>After a moment, he shook his head, saying, "This humble Daoist doesn't require a fellow Daoist skilled in Star Slaughter Talismans, but rather one proficient in Prayer, Exorcism, and Body Refinement."</p><p>Having seen the rewards on the decree, a sudden thought struck him. Since he couldn't find a place where starlight converged, why not approach it from another angle?</p><p>This world was filled with countless Daoist experts, and there was no shortage of talismanic arts related to the celestial stars.</p><p>If he could invite a powerful expert to channel starlight through talismans and perform Star Essence Infusion for him, it should also be feasible.</p><p>This would demand an extremely high level of skill from the caster, whose cultivation must be no lower than the Nascent Soul Transformation stage.</p><p>Inviting such an expert wouldn't be easy.</p><p>During the Star Essence Infusion, Qin Sang needed to focus on his breakthrough and also guard against the other party going back on their word or harboring malicious intent.</p><p>The Dao Court decree gave Qin Sang hope.</p><p>By accepting the decree and exchanging merit for the expert's assistance, it was equivalent to establishing a pact with the Dao Court, implicating the Dao Court's reputation.</p><p>The person assisting should not dare to defy righteousness and risk universal condemnation by harming him.</p><p>His worries were resolved.</p><p>However, the type of talisman to be used during the Star Essence Infusion needed careful consideration.</p><p>Star Slaughter Talismans, as the name suggested, were purely offensive talismans. Qin Sang sought a breakthrough, not death; they were clearly unsuitable.</p><p>This world's Daoist talisman system was comprehensive and all-encompassing. Since many talismans possessed multiple functions, no one made strict classifications, only a few conventionally accepted divisions.</p><p>Prayer, Exorcism, and Body Refinement referred to two categories.</p><p>Prayer and Exorcism talismans could dispel impurities and toxins, resolving various detrimental conditions affecting the body, with many also possessing healing effects.</p><p>Body Refinement were enhancement talismans, often used by Soldier and Horse Altar cultivators on their troops, and by Dragon and Tiger Altar cultivators on themselves. They were most adept at this; when Shen Huo's body swelled several times its size during their mountain-breaking and temple-destroying exploits, he used this type of talisman.</p><p>It could be seen that Prayer, Exorcism, and Body Refinement talismans were mostly beneficial and harmless, and this was precisely what Qin Sang needed.</p><p>The old Daoist grasped Qin Sang's requirements and, after a moment of contemplation, stroked his long beard, saying, "This old Daoist understands your intention.  Countless talismans exist in the world, but when it comes to this type of prayer and exorcism technique, none can surpass the Xuanji Sect, especially their Northern Palace Southern Dipper Preservation and Refinement Talisman, truly exquisite and unparalleled!"</p><p>"Northern Palace Southern Dipper…"</p><p>Qin Sang mused silently, pondering. Judging by the talisman's name, it seemed to only channel the power of the Big Dipper and Southern Dipper constellations.</p><p>He cultivated the "Celestial Demon Body Refinement" and hadn't specifically chosen any stars; the cultivation method itself didn't have such requirements.</p><p>From the beginning of his cultivation, he had indiscriminately absorbed all starlight from the void, encompassing all celestial stars.</p><p>He had encountered no issues along the way.</p><p>If he only channeled the starlight of the two Dippers for infusion, he wondered if the incomplete set of stars would have an adverse effect.</p><p>Concerning his own Dao path, Qin Sang naturally needed to inquire thoroughly about this talisman.</p><p>Hearing his question, the old Daoist chuckled, "You've asked the right person. Three hundred years ago, this old Daoist was fortunate enough to witness the Northern Palace Southern Dipper Preservation and Refinement Talisman's power from afar. Despite its name, this talisman begins with the Big Dipper and channels all celestial stars. As the saying goes, the Southern Dipper governs life; the talisman ultimately shifts to the Southern Dipper to cast the spell.  The power of all celestial stars is vast and complex, yet the talisman's deployment remains flawlessly organized. Precisely because of this, it has gained such great renown."</p><p>Hearing this, Qin Sang's expression eased slightly. It now depended on whether the Xuanji Sect had experts capable of assisting his breakthrough.</p><p>Observing his expression, the old Daoist softened his tone slightly, reminding him, "Don't get too excited just yet. The more profound the Northern Palace Southern Dipper Preservation and Refinement Talisman, the greater the difficulty in cultivating it, and the higher the demands on the caster. Such individuals are not easily swayed…"</p><p>Qin Sang's expression remained unchanged as he asked, "How many within the Xuanji Sect have mastered this talisman?"</p><p>The old Daoist held up a single finger, "To my knowledge, only one!"</p><p>"One?"</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze narrowed slightly. Could it be the Xuanji Sect's Sect Master?</p><p>"Just one, unless the Xuanji Sect has produced another Void Insight True Person, kept secret from the world," the old Daoist nodded.</p><p>A Void Insight Dharma Rank True Person was equivalent to a Nascent Soul Transformation cultivator.</p><p>In other words, this talisman could only be cultivated by a Nascent Soul Transformation cultivator. If he could persuade them to exert their full power, it would likely meet Qin Sang's requirements.</p><p>However, the only person who had mastered this talisman was the Xuanji Sect Master. As the old Daoist said, the leader of a sect was not easily persuaded.</p><p>After some thought, Qin Sang mentally noted the Xuanji Sect, intending to revisit the matter later. He still had thirty years.</p><p>He continued questioning the old Daoist about whether other sects possessed similar talismans, obtaining a few more leads.</p><p>The Dao Court also possessed similar talismans.</p><p>However, after comparing them, the Xuanji Sect's Northern Palace Southern Dipper Preservation and Refinement Talisman remained the most suitable.</p><p>"Many thanks, fellow Daoist!"</p><p>Qin Sang produced a magical treasure and offered it to the old Daoist.</p><p>The old Daoist's eyes lit up upon seeing the treasure and he accepted it with a smile, "If you have any further questions, fellow Daoist, this humble Daoist will certainly answer without reservation. This treasure's forging method is quite ingenious, more than enough compensation for the previous question. As for the following questions, unless they involve core secrets, this old Daoist will offer them freely."</p><p>Daoist cultivators in this world also used external objects, although they relied more on divine abilities and talismans. The three schools each had their strengths, equally formidable in power, unlike the cultivators of the Storm Realm who were so reliant on magical treasures.</p><p>Of course, if they encountered superior magical treasures or spiritual treasures, they wouldn't hesitate to compete for them.</p><p>Qin Sang possessed great skill in refining tools and had the opportunity to fully display his talent in this world. However, he didn't have time to consider this now; he needed to address the imminent threat first.</p><p>With the old Daoist offering to share more, Qin Sang naturally wouldn't be polite. He carefully inquired about some matters he wished to know, gaining a wealth of information.</p><p>Leaving the shop, it was deep into the night.</p><p>Before arriving, Qin Sang had heard that the night sky of Jushan was exceptionally dark, with few stars or moon visible.</p><p>Looking up, it was indeed so.</p><p>A layer of dark clouds seemed to shroud the night sky, obscuring the starlight. Only a halo of light could be seen in the heavens, presumably the moon.</p><p>With his wide sleeves fluttering, Qin Sang walked alone along the streets, pondering his next course of action.</p><p>He had previously asked the old Daoist about two peculiar zones within Jushan that inexplicably attracted converging starlight.</p><p>Due to their unusual phenomena, they were somewhat famous within Jushan. However, many Daoist cultivators had investigated them without discovering the cause.</p><p>Qin Sang had requested the records and, after reviewing them, confirmed that the Star Essence power in those two locations wasn't dense enough to meet his requirements, so he lost interest.</p><p>Following Qin Sang's habit, even if he had thought of other methods, he wouldn't place all his hopes on them. A two-pronged approach was necessary for absolute certainty.</p><p>He needed to continue searching for places where Star Essence converged!</p><p>This world wasn't solely ruled by the Dao Court. There was also the Ghost Fang Kingdom, as well as the boundless Calamity Sea and Calamity Plains.</p><p>Just because the Dao Court lacked such places didn't mean they didn't exist elsewhere.</p><p>With this thought, Qin Sang remembered the snake demon and狈 demon. It was time for them to play their part.</p><p>However, Qin Sang wasn't in a hurry to act. He hadn't yet met Shi Xuan and the others.</p><p>Crushing a jade talisman, Qin Sang stepped into a nearby inn.</p><p>The inn had separate courtyards, each a small cave dwelling.</p><p>Before long, the three hurried into the inn, activating the restrictive formation.</p><p>"Come in."</p><p>The formation opened.</p><p>Shi Xuan entered the courtyard first and, upon seeing Qin Sang, bowed deeply, "We three juniors greet Senior."</p><p>Facing Qin Sang again, the three appeared much more composed.</p><p>Their sect wasn't lacking in Ascendant Profound True People. Previously, they had been slightly flustered upon suddenly learning Qin Sang's true realm.</p><p>However, the strength of their sect didn't mean they dared to offend a True Person; their demeanor remained respectful.</p><p>"I've kept you waiting."</p><p>Qin Sang spoke amiably and gestured for them to sit.</p><p>The three quickly declined, saying they didn't dare, and sat down. Before Qin Sang could ask, Shi Xuan took the initiative to speak, "Reporting to Senior, after our return, we presented the tiger's corpse to the Immortal Officials of the North Pole Evil Warding Academy and received a reward of over ten thousand merit points, which should rightfully be returned to Senior."</p><p>"Over ten thousand?"</p><p>Qin Sang was slightly surprised.</p><p>Among the decrees he had seen, slaying a demon commander comparable in strength to the tiger demon offered at most three thousand merit points.</p><p>Decrees at the Nascent Soul level rarely exceeded ten thousand, and they were all extremely difficult.</p><p>Such a large amount of merit clearly wasn't solely due to the tiger demon. They had likely stumbled upon some conspiracy unintentionally.</p><p>Shi Xuan added that the North Pole Evil Warding Academy had expressed interest in inviting him over for further inquiries.</p><p>"There's no rush."</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head slightly.</p><p>Then, Shi Xuan recalled something else and said with a serious expression, "This junior remembers Senior inquiring about places where Star Essence converges. Without permission, this junior took the liberty of inquiring with the sect elders. Please punish this junior."</p><p>Qin Sang looked him up and down, his gaze profound, "What crime is there in inquiring about information for this humble Daoist?  Not only will there be no punishment, regardless of the outcome, this humble Daoist will reward you handsomely!"</p><p>Shi Xuan seemed to truly relax, his expression brightening, "Thanks to Senior's blessing, this junior hasn't failed in his mission. From the sect elders, this junior learned of a place, right here in Jushan. Due to its secluded location, it's unknown to most! However, this junior is uncertain whether the Star Essence power there is sufficiently dense to meet Senior's requirements."</p><p>Hearing this, Qin Sang immediately became interested. Upon further questioning, he learned that the location was north of Crane Cry Mountain, very remote. The Nine Flowers Grotto Heaven True Person who discovered it named it Star Valley.</p><p>According to the description, the Star Essence power there was far denser than the other two locations!</p><p>"Excellent!"</p><p>Qin Sang praised him and retrieved a whip-like magical treasure from his Spatial Ring as a reward.</p><p>Shi Xuan accepted it, his eyes full of admiration.</p><p>Transferring merit required visiting the Dao Court's residence. Qin Sang had already left a spiritual pact with the Dao Court, so Shi Xuan and the others could directly transfer the merit to him without needing him to be present.</p><p>Qin Sang only took the whole number, leaving the remainder for them.</p><p>After Shi Xuan and the others left, Qin Sang stayed in the immortal city for two more days before departing again.</p><p>This time, he left through the north gate, flying solo towards the northeast.  Nearing the boundary between the two major forces, he landed on a barren mountain and opened his spirit beast pouch.</p><p>*Thump! Thump!*</p><p>The snake demon and狈 demon tumbled to the ground, baring their fangs at each other upon seeing one another.</p><p>"Enough!"</p><p>Qin Sang shouted sternly.</p><p>The two demons startled and prostrated themselves on the ground.</p><p>"Not far ahead is the territory occupied by the Ghost Fang Kingdom."</p><p>Qin Sang looked at the snake demon and tossed the token to it.</p><p>The snake demon conjured a gust of demonic wind to catch it, staring at Qin Sang in disbelief. It couldn't believe he would let it go.</p><p>Qin Sang naturally wouldn't release it so easily. He needed an accomplice to infiltrate the Ghost Fang Kingdom, gather information for him, and he had planted the Bloodthirsty Miasma Spirit's source poison within the snake demon.</p><p>He looked at the snake demon and said, "Even with the token, gaining significant standing upon returning to the Ghost Fang Kingdom may not be so easy. We might as well cooperate."</p><p>"You... what do you want me to do, Immortal Lord?"</p><p>The snake demon grew wary.</p><p>"To establish merit. I also wish to gain merit."</p><p>Qin Sang pointed at it, then at himself, "If the opportunity arises, we can exchange information."</p><p>The snake demon fell silent. Although not highly experienced, it understood that the fate of spies was generally grim.</p><p>"Rest assured, this humble Daoist can swear an oath. Before taking any action, I will seek your consent first and won't force you to risk your life probing for secrets. After a hundred years, this humble Daoist will lift the restriction. However…"</p><p>Qin Sang's tone turned cold, "If you intend to betray this humble Daoist, consider this carefully. You were once captured by humans. Will they completely trust you?"</p><p>The snake demon's heart trembled. After a long silence, it nodded, "I hope you will keep your promise."</p><p>A short while later, the snake demon slithered away.</p><p>Qin Sang watched it go; it was a pawn he had placed.</p><p>The snake demon returning with the token might expose the hidden poison within it if it contacted the Ghost Fang Kingdom's upper echelons.</p><p>If it proved useful, he would rejoice. If it went rogue, he hadn't lost much.</p><p>The狈 demon watched the freed snake demon with envy.</p><p>However, Qin Sang had revealed quite a bit to this demon upon his arrival and couldn't release it yet.</p><p>(End of Chapter)</p>
