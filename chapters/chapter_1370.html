<h1></h1><p>At least until the Ebony Sword gestates spirituality and advances to a Spiritual Treasure, it won't need to be refined with spiritual wood.</p><p>A man who does not think far ahead must have worries close at hand.</p><p>If there's a chance to obtain the Ten Great Divine Woods, Qin Sang doesn't want to miss it.</p><p>Last time, when the monster in the Blood Lake awakened, he intended to wait for the chaos in the Blood Lake to subside, and after he became stronger, he would return to search for the Boundless Blood Mulberry (Blood Mulberry of Limitless Calamity). Unexpectedly, this kind of change occurred.</p><p>Real Person Cang Hong and the other Nascent Soul cultivators of Sin Abyss have been exploring the bottom of the Sky Imprint (Heavenly Scar), searching for fragments of the Abyss Ruins (Abyssal Ruins). If he's lucky, the main body of the Abyss Ruins might not be completely destroyed.</p><p>When he has free time, Qin Sang also wants to personally take a trip to search for the Blood Lake.</p><p>But according to the various pieces of news from Sin Abyss, the chance is probably not great, and the inner valley of Boundless Cliff (Limitless Valley) is even more thoroughly destroyed than the bottom of the Sky Imprint, so that's also a dead end.</p><p>Qin Sang has great expectations for the third type of divine wood and has always had the idea of contacting the Pure Yang Sect.</p><p>With the fall of Old Ancestor Crimson Hair and the Pure Yang Sect splitting, it's a good opportunity to take advantage of the situation.</p><p>But the news that Jiang Xue brought wasn't entirely satisfactory.</p><p>Back then, the Pure Yang Sect almost exhausted the strength of the entire sect, and Old Ancestor Crimson Hair even left the sect many times, personally searching for Vajra Solid (Adamantine Solid), but ultimately found nothing.</p><p>After hundreds of years, it's almost impossible to find any traces or clues.</p><p>The Pure Yang Sect had already given up.</p><p>That Blood Nether Sect disciple is probably already reduced to withered bones, and he and the Vajra Solid are buried under some piece of yellow sand.</p><p>That's why Jiang Xue easily revealed this matter to Qin Sang.</p><p>Searching for Vajra Solid in the Great Northern Chen Desert (Great Northern Star Desert) is like looking for a needle in a haystack.</p><p>However, now that he has received the news, how can he be willing if he doesn't try?</p><p>As the master of a sect, he doesn't lack manpower. He doesn't need to personally handle such trivial matters as investigating and collecting news; he has disciples to serve him.</p><p>Qin Sang flicked his finger and sent out a stream of light.</p><p>After the White Cat looked at it, it leaped out of Peach Blossom Valley, and soon brought Li Yufu back.</p><p>"Disciple greets Senior Uncle."</p><p>There was still joy remaining between Li Yufu's eyebrows.</p><p>Establishing the Azure Goat Temple (Azure Ram Temple) was Yun Youzi's last wish and also a heavy burden in Li Yufu's heart. Now that his long-cherished wish has been fulfilled, Li Yufu is even more excited than Qin Sang, the abbot.</p><p>"Come in and talk..."</p><p>Qin Sang asked about the trivial matters of the Azure Goat Temple.</p><p>Li Yufu entered the cave and answered one by one.</p><p>In short, the Azure Goat Temple is thriving and has a promising future!</p><p>As long as Qin Sang, the abbot, continues to become stronger, and there are successors, and Nascent Souls are constantly produced, it's not impossible for the Azure Goat Temple to grow into the number one sect in the Little Cold Domain (Lesser Cold Domain) and even the Northern Chen Territory (Northern Star Territory)!</p><p>With the Mind Light Prayer Mat (Heart Illumination Prayer Cushion) present, this is not a luxury.</p><p>After listening, Qin Sang said, "All I can do is this. In the future, you must not slack off in your cultivation. Otherwise, no matter how glorious the Azure Goat Temple is, it will only be a flash in the pan. Especially you, Yufu, a heaven-blessed genius whose talent is second only to a Heavenly Spiritual Root (Celestial Spiritual Root). Your Grandmaster and I have high hopes for you. In the future, leave the affairs of the temple to Yi En and Hanqiu."</p><p>"Disciple understands!"</p><p>Li Yufu solemnly responded.</p><p>Qin Sang further instructed, "I need to enter secluded cultivation again, which will probably take at least several decades, or even a century. During this time, do not come to Peach Blossom Valley to disturb me unless there is a major event. As for the Northern Chen Alliance (Northern Star Alliance) meetings, you will represent me and listen to Fellow Daoist Jing Yu."</p><p>Li Yufu agreed one by one and suddenly realized something, with a face full of surprise, "Senior Uncle is going to break through again?"</p><p>He felt incredible. How long has it been since Senior Uncle formed his Nascent Soul? Could he break through to the middle stage of Nascent Soul again within a century?</p><p>Grandmaster once said that Senior Uncle was born with Five Spiritual Roots. Could it be fake?</p><p>You must know that Senior Uncle was about the same age as him when he formed his Nascent Soul, and he is still stagnating in the Golden Core stage.</p><p>Li Yufu fell into deep self-doubt.</p><p>"There are two more things..."</p><p>Qin Sang took out a formal invitation and handed it to Li Yufu.</p><p>"After you go back, arrange for people to go out to train and look for clues for me. After arriving in the desert, first take this invitation to visit Fellow Daoist Lu..."</p><p>There are mainly two things.</p><p>One is the whereabouts of Tan Hao, and the other is news about the Vajra Solid.</p><p>After thinking about it, Qin Sang said in a deep voice, "If you discover Tan Hao's traces, report back quickly. Remember not to act rashly!"</p><p>Tan Hao has been missing for too long, and the mysterious person behind him is of unknown good or evil. Qin Sang always has a bad feeling.</p><p>Soon.</p><p>Li Yufu respectfully retreated from the cave, paused at the exit, said a few words to the White Cat, and then flew out of Peach Blossom Valley.</p><p>The White Cat raised its front paw, sealed the restrictions of Peach Blossom Valley, and returned to its own cave.</p><p>A gentle breeze is blowing.</p><p>The fragrance of peach blossoms wafts.</p><p>From then on, Peach Blossom Valley became a sacred place in the hearts of the Azure Goat Temple disciples.</p><p>And Qin Sang, the abbot, disappeared for decades.</p><p>â€¦</p><p>Inside the cave.</p><p>Qin Sang added several layers of protective restrictions, first awakened the Fat Silkworm (Plump Silkworm), and fed it a Poison Algae Fruit.</p><p>He has few Poison Algae Fruits left, and he hasn't found another food that the Fat Silkworm likes. He estimates that he can only raise the Fat Silkworm to the late stage of the Third Transformation at most.</p><p>The Heavenly Eye Butterfly (Celestial Eye Butterfly) is also facing the same predicament.</p><p>Qin Sang exchanged for several rare spiritual medicines at the trade fair, but the Heavenly Eye Butterfly was not interested in any of them. It usually only drinks some spiritual dew, which helps her very little.</p><p>Since breaking through to the Fourth Transformation, the Heavenly Eye Butterfly's cultivation has hardly improved. Qin Sang truly realized the difficulty of nurturing spirit insects.</p><p>The road connecting to Canglang Sea (Azure Wave Sea) is cut off, so he can't go to the Witch Clan to find secret manuals either.</p><p>All Qin Sang can do is collect various spiritual flowers and immortal dews that the spirit insects like and try them one by one.</p><p>The Fire Jade Centipede (Infernal Jade Centipede), on the other hand, is still very interested in the Fire Melting Pill (Inferno Congealing Pill) and faintly shows signs of breaking through to the middle stage of the Third Transformation. He expects that during the Third Transformation, he shouldn't have to worry about it anymore.</p><p>But the bottleneck of the Fourth Transformation is still a major hurdle.</p><p>Fortunately, Qin Sang doesn't rely on the Fire Jade Centipede to fight enemies; he only values its treasure-hunting ability.</p><p>After feeding the three spirit insects.</p><p>Qin Sang sat down cross-legged.</p><p>The Nascent Soul Talisman Puppet (Nascent Soul Talisman Avatar) sat cross-legged opposite him.</p><p>The Thousand Jun Ring (Thousand Weight Ring) flickered with light, and a jade box flew out.</p><p>The jade box opened, and inside was a Corpse Flower Ambergris (Corpse Bloom Amber).</p><p>After being purified by the spiritual vein, the Corpse Flower Ambergris was completely free of blood poison and extremely pure, crystal clear, like a spiritual flower carved from crystal.</p><p>He has already refined one Corpse Flower Ambergris.</p><p>Qin Sang's next actions seemed very skilled.</p><p>He closed his eyes tightly, silently mobilized his true essence, and used the secret technique that Jing Yu taught him.</p><p>Following Qin Sang's actions, the Corpse Flower Ambergris rotated gently, and streams of light flew out from Qin Sang, forming a small vortex around the Corpse Flower Ambergris.</p><p>The vortex rotated faster and faster.</p><p>'Crack, crack...'</p><p>The Corpse Flower Ambergris began to vibrate, and fine cracks appeared on the surface.</p><p>Qin Sang pointed his fingers repeatedly, and countless talismans submerged into it. The crystal 'pop' exploded, and then countless fragments melted, turning into a pure spiritual liquid.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>The spiritual liquid disappeared into thin air.</p><p>At the same time, a spiritual liquid appeared around Qin Sang's Nascent Soul, surrounding his body.</p><p>Finally, the spiritual liquid turned into a cocoon, wrapping the Nascent Soul, expanding and contracting like breathing.</p><p>Qin Sang's aura stabilized as he refined the medicinal power bit by bit.</p><p>No wonder it's a peerless spiritual medicine that can help transforming great demons break through!</p><p>And Qin Sang has three of these spiritual medicines!</p><p>In the process of refining, Qin Sang's cultivation is improving at an astonishing speed. If others were to see it, they would be dumbfounded!</p>
