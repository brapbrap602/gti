<h1>Chapter 1358: Guests from All Directions</h1><p>The palanquin sped through the clouds.</p><p>Inside sat two powerful妖 (yao) kings, Li Hong, under the command of the Serpent King and the Feather King.</p><p>Dragons and phoenixes soared through the mists, pulling the palanquin effortlessly.</p><p>From their vantage point, they could clearly see streaks of light between the mountains—undoubtedly, everyone was heading to the same place.</p><p>“Daoist Qin has just established his sect, and already it has the air of a major school,”</p><p>the Serpent King remarked.</p><p>“I hear Daoist Qin has been laying the groundwork for his sect for many years…”</p><p>Li Hong, looking somewhat distracted, spotted several cultivators from the desert, frowned, and sneered, “Even people from the desert have come from afar to celebrate. It seems the human race is becoming increasingly united!”</p><p>The Serpent King knew what he was worried about and sighed, “The tide is too strong.  Only internal rifts within the Northern Star Alliance could cause it to crumble. There's little we can do.  Fortunately, our yao are not excluded from the Northern Star Alliance; otherwise, we would be truly uneasy…”</p><p>Humans and yao have always been different, unable to fully trust each other.  The yao are weak, and the constant division within the Northern Star Region suits their interests. They are the ones least keen to see the human race form an alliance.</p><p>Unfortunately, the ascension of the Ziwei Palace was too shocking. All other grudges pale in comparison. Even if the yao secretly stirred up trouble, they could not achieve anything.</p><p>Right now, humanity isn't concerned with eliminating dissent. But if they can't find the Ascension Platform for a long time and things revert to the past, some people are bound to develop ambition.</p><p>Li Hong snorted, "Once the Great King breaks through to the late Transformation stage, he can suppress the human race single-handedly, buying us time to scheme… I don't believe the Northern Star Alliance is truly united!"</p><p>“Feather King…”</p><p>The Serpent King shook his head slightly, seemingly not very optimistic about the Feather King, then changed the subject, “For now, we can only lie low.  Among human Yuan Ying cultivators, only a handful have the potential to reach the late Yuan Ying stage.  Barring any surprises, Daoist Qin's position in the Northern Star Alliance will only become more important. Daoist Qin has a deep friendship with Daoist Jingyu, and is a successor of the Bamboo Yao. Even if someone harbors evil intentions, he won't stand idly by…”</p><p>Years ago, when Jingyu celebrated his breakthrough, the Feather King personally went to the Thousand Mountain Bamboo Sea to congratulate him. The death of the Bamboo Yao was revealed then, causing a huge stir among the yao.</p><p>Li Hong frowned every time he thought about it.</p><p>Back then, incited by the Nine Caves Yao King, he probed the Thousand Mountain Bamboo Sea, only to be driven away by Qin Sang's scheme.</p><p>Looking back, Qin Sang must have been bluffing; that was when the Thousand Mountain Bamboo Sea was at its weakest!</p><p>Now it’s too late to regret it.</p><p>“The Great King also feels the same way. We must not antagonize Daoist Qin. If it weren’t for the Great King being in a crucial stage of seclusion, he would have come to celebrate personally.”</p><p>The Serpent King chuckled, “Daoist Qin is riding high, extremely influential.  We will likely see quite a few old fellows today…”</p><p>Before he finished speaking, the Serpent King's expression changed, and he suddenly stood up.</p><p>Li Hong, noticing something was amiss, quickly got up and followed the Serpent King out of the palanquin.</p><p>In the distance, they saw a white cloud approaching, with two figures riding on it, exuding an ethereal aura and a relaxed demeanor.</p><p>One of them was Lu Boyuan.</p><p>Standing beside him was a young man emitting a faint yao aura.</p><p>“Daoist Lu! Daoist Hanxi! I didn't expect you to come in person,” the Serpent King invited them onto the palanquin, looking at Hanxi for a moment, “Congratulations, Daoist Hanxi, on your recovery, and with no lingering issues!”</p><p>“It was fortunate…”</p><p>Hanxi offered a faint smile.</p><p>Lu Boyuan said, “Daoist Qin's establishment of his sect, we couldn't not come!”</p><p>Then, turning to Li Hong, he asked, “Daoist Li Hong, how is the Feather King’s injury?”</p><p>Li Hong bowed, “The Great King has recovered eight out of ten, and is doing well.”</p><p>As they spoke, the palanquin flew over the mountains, and the magnificent Qingyang Temple came into view, surrounded by auspicious clouds.</p><p>Sensing the palanquin's presence from afar,</p><p>Li Yufu, along with several disciples, rushed out from the welcoming peak, “Li Yufu of Qingyang Temple, welcomes the seniors.”</p><p>“You are Daoist Qin’s outstanding disciple, Li Yufu?  A fine young man! Excellent!”</p><p>Lu Boyuan and the others stepped out of the palanquin.</p><p>Seeing so many yao kings and Yuan Ying cultivators, Li Yufu was initially startled. After hearing their introduction, he loudly proclaimed:</p><p>“Li Hong, representing the Wan Yao City and the Feather King, has come to offer congratulations!”</p><p>“Master Lu and Yao King Hanxi have come to offer congratulations!”</p><p>“The Serpent King of Mount Huolong and his followers have come to offer congratulations!”</p><p>…</p><p>The sound carried into Qingyang Temple, silencing the commotion within the sect.  A large number of scattered cultivators looked up at the palanquin, admiring the yao kings and Yuan Ying cultivators.</p><p>Immediately afterwards, nine melodious bell tolls rang out from the main peak, welcoming the most honored guests.</p><p>Li Yu Fu bowed and led Serpent King and the others towards the main peak, while others guided the royal carriage and the lesser demons.</p><p>Before they reached the peak, Mei Gu's shouts echoed from outside the Qingyang Temple.</p><p>"Master Yue Kui, Master Yue Wu, Master Ji…" Mei Gu called out a long list of names.</p><p>Yue Kui and Yue Wu were twin generals, disciples of Master Zhen Yi.</p><p>After the Northern Star Alliance was formed, the Skywalk Alliance became defunct, but the cultivators of the Skywalk Plateau still tended to stick together, led by the twin generals.</p><p>Serpent King and the others stopped, exchanging glances.</p><p>"Unexpectedly, most of the old fellows from the Skywalk Alliance are here.  Daoist Qin certainly has influence,"  Li Hong, the Demon King, chuckled.</p><p>Serpent King shook his head. "The Skywalk Alliance has reversed its decline and counterattacked the Abyss of Sin. Daoist Qin has made an indelible contribution; they should be here out of both obligation and sentiment."</p><p>Han Xi sneered, "There's another reason… among Master Zhen Yi's disciples, only the Yue brothers can still maintain appearances.  But even when Master Zhen Yi was alive, they couldn't break through to the mid-Yuan Ying stage. It'll likely be even harder now. If the Skywalk Alliance continues to lack successors, hmph."</p><p>The three Demon Kings openly and carelessly discussed the Skywalk Alliance.</p><p>Lu Bo Yuan, being human, felt uncomfortable participating, and turned to urge Li Yu Fu, who pretended not to hear anything, to continue leading the way.</p><p>After welcoming the Yuan Ying cultivators of the Skywalk Alliance into the Qingyang Temple, the sound of bells rang incessantly.</p><p>"Master Bing Han of the Xu Ling Sect and her disciples have arrived to offer congratulations!"</p><p>"Master Si Di and Master Yao Jing of the Taiyi Danzong and their disciples have arrived to offer congratulations!"</p><p>…</p><p>Qin Sang's establishment of his sect had become the biggest event in the entire Northern Star region, attracting the rarely seen Yuan Ying masters one after another.</p><p>The cultivators in the valley below craned their necks, their eyes darting about, listening to one thunderous name after another, feeling their necks stiffen from the spectacle, thinking the journey was well worth it.</p><p>Yuan Ying cultivators from the Sky Demon Hill, the Desert, the Skywalk Alliance, the Lesser Cold Region, and the Abyss of Sin all came to offer congratulations.</p><p>Master Cang Hong and the other Yuan Ying cultivators from the Abyss of Sin were exploring the bottom of the Heavenly Scar, hoping to find fragments of the Abyssal Ruins, so they sent Fairy Qiu Zhi as their representative to present their gifts.</p><p>Besides the Yuan Ying cultivators and the renowned sects, many smaller sects also attended.  Those from the Lesser Cold Region, closest to Qingyang Temple, were virtually all present.</p><p>When the names of Mu Yi Feng and Shao Hua Mountain were announced, a stir arose.</p><p>The conflict between Qin Sang and the Earl of Dongyang, while not common knowledge, was no secret among the higher echelons.</p><p>No one expected Shao Hua Mountain to attend, let alone that its sect master had changed so silently!</p>
