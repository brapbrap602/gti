<h1>Chapter 451: A Beam of Light</h1><p>From a great distance, the terrifying scene made everyone's hearts pound, their faces etched with tension.</p><p>Only Jindan cultivators could unleash such devastating power.</p><p>Qin Sang looked up, his mind racing.</p><p>He glanced at their battle formation.  Fortunately, their squad was assigned to the rear of the left flank. If things went south, they could withdraw quickly.</p><p>With Mu Yifeng by his side, and other fellow disciples nearby, ready to lend a hand, he wasn't worried about an untimely demise.</p><p>However, unless there was a complete rout, no one dared to desert, lest they be executed on the spot.</p><p>With the current strength of Xiaohan Territory, they were not afraid of the Heavenly Firmament Alliance.  A rout was unlikely; this battle would be a protracted one.</p><p>Qin Sang skillfully summoned his magical tools. The Cold Gold Sword circled him, and he also prepared the Yin-Yang Compass and a chain-like magical tool.</p><p>After countless battles, Qin Sang had replaced most of his magical tools, but the Yin-Yang Compass and the Cold Gold Sword remained, as they were the most familiar to him.</p><p>However, the Cold Gold Sword had changed significantly compared to three years ago. Every time Qin Sang obtained suitable spirit materials, he would reforge the Cold Gold Sword. Now, its power had soared, undoubtedly placing it among the top-tier high-grade magical tools.</p><p>Mu Yifeng, having never participated in such a large-scale battle, was a little uneasy. He transmitted his voice, "Junior Brother Qin, you are experienced. Give me some pointers. What should we do later?"</p><p>Qin Sang reassured him, "Senior Brother Mu, with your cultivation, there's no need to worry too much.  No matter what, stay calm! Remember, never be greedy for merit and rush forward, leaving the formation…"</p><p>Qin Sang gave the same advice to the other members of the squad.</p><p>This principle was the reason he was still alive and kicking.</p><p>Mu Yifeng exhaled slowly, making up his mind, "I'll follow you closely later…"</p><p>In the blink of an eye, they drew closer to the battlefield.</p><p>Qin Sang and Mu Yifeng were no longer in the mood to talk, their eyes fixed on the distant dark clouds, as if facing a formidable enemy.</p><p>Within the dark clouds, it was impossible to discern which side had the upper hand.  One could only see figures resembling demonic gods.</p><p>Every collision of magical treasures produced a flash of rainbow light, the mere aftershocks creating towering waves in the water below.</p><p>This wasn't the first time Qin Sang had witnessed a battle between Jindan cultivators, but each time, he was still filled with awe and longing.</p><p>This battle was more intense than any he had seen before.</p><p>All the Jindan cultivators on both sides were involved. Vice Island Master Xiao hurriedly left a brief instruction, then transformed into a streak of light, joining the battle at top speed.</p><p>Commotion rippled through the ranks.</p><p>Amidst the chaos, Qin Sang maintained a calm expression, his gaze scanning the area around the dark clouds and lightning. He didn't see any Foundation Establishment cultivators from the Heavenly Firmament Alliance. Had they not arrived yet?</p><p>Just then, Qin Sang's eyes narrowed.  He noticed something unusual within the dark clouds.</p><p>Mu Yifeng also noticed it and pointed it out to Qin Sang through voice transmission, "Junior Brother Qin, look at that beam of light!"</p><p>Mu Yifeng was pointing to the depths of the dark clouds.</p><p>Even the thick clouds couldn't obscure the beam.  It wasn't dazzling, unable to compete with the surrounding lightning, but soft like moonlight. Yet, even from such a distance, it was clearly visible.</p><p>The beam descended from the sky, like a sword piercing the clouds.</p><p>It connected the stars above with the water below.</p><p>The light within the beam pulsed rhythmically, as if some strange power was being transmitted.</p><p>Qin Sang craned his neck, but could only see the beam disappearing into the starry expanse, its origin unknown. He lowered his gaze to the vast waters, searching for its source.</p><p>The beam touched down on the water.</p><p>That area of water, affected by the battle, was turbulent with high waves and strong winds.</p><p>But where it met the beam, a small patch of water shimmered like mercury, as smooth as a mirror, eerily calm. No matter how large the waves, they were silently swallowed by the beam as they approached.</p><p>"This is…"</p><p>Qin Sang noticed that the beam's landing point was precisely the center of the battlefield.  His heart stirred.  Staring at the patch of water, he murmured, "Is Finger Peak within the mirror?"</p><p>Then, Qin Sang detected faint fluctuations of a restrictive formation within the mirror's shimmer.  However, this formation was unlike anything he'd seen before. Like the beam of light, it was beyond his comprehension.</p><p>He could only speculate based on experience that the mirror's formation could likely draw upon the power of the stars, and it was certainly not simple.</p><p>More and more people noticed the beam of light, their faces filled with wonder.</p><p>However, they soon lost their curiosity.</p><p>From the south, countless streaks of light formed a similarly vast expanse of radiance, entering their field of vision.  Their opponents had finally arrived.</p><p>Enemies meeting was like dry kindling meeting fire.</p><p>Both sides tacitly changed direction, avoiding the battlefield of the Jindan cultivators.</p><p>The distance between them shrank rapidly. Under the starlight, they could already see the ferocious expressions of their enemies.</p><p>"Form the formation!"</p><p>Qin Sang roared.</p><p>Within the battle formation, there were many focal points, occupied by renowned experts like Qin Sang and Senior Brother Rong. Each person "controlled" a specific area, gathering the power of their surrounding comrades to confront the enemy.</p><p>Although Qin Sang's cultivation was slightly lower, his reputation as the Shadowless Sword was well-established. He hadn't missed a single major battle, making him the most qualified.</p><p>The others remained silent, while these experts continued to communicate through voice transmission.</p><p>The moment had arrived. They issued their commands simultaneously.</p><p>As Qin Sang's command rang out, all the cultivators around him roared in unison, channeling their spiritual power, drawing it from within themselves, and converging it upon Qin Sang as the focal point.</p><p>Qin Sang raised his hands high. Their combined spiritual power fused in his palms, forming a dazzling sphere of light, rivaling the brightness of the moon in the sky.</p><p>A continuous stream of spiritual power surged towards him.  Merely controlling it was a strain. Qin Sang's arms bulged with veins, his body trembling slightly.</p><p>Their power was united, but unfortunately, the battle formation's power couldn't be infinitely amplified.  Otherwise, Qin Sang would surely explode.</p><p>They had reached the limit.</p><p>Mu Yifeng and the others protected Qin Sang, guarding against any unforeseen circumstances.</p><p>"Condense!"</p><p>When the sphere of light reached its peak density, Qin Sang gritted his teeth and rapidly formed a series of complex hand seals. With each change of the seals, the sphere also rapidly transformed, gradually taking the shape of a small, exquisite blade.</p><p>The blade, imbued with the power of so many Foundation Establishment cultivators, was not to be underestimated.</p><p>Its edge shimmered with a cold light, creating the illusion of being cut just by looking at it.</p><p>Along with Qin Sang, Senior Brother Rong and the others performed the same actions.</p><p>Identical blades formed above the battle formation, then, under the control of Qin Sang and the others, flew towards the front of the formation.</p><p>A row of blades pointed at the Heavenly Firmament Alliance's formation.</p><p>At the same time, their opponents were not to be outdone. They formed a wind formation.</p><p>A hurricane swept towards them, carrying countless chilling wind blades.</p>
