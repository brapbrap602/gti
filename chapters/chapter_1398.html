<h1>Chapter 1390: The Missing Nascent Soul</h1><p>The aura of tribulation lightning is too unique.</p><p>Once unleashed, it is difficult to conceal.</p><p>Spiritual insects capable of manipulating tribulation lightning possess unparalleled allure for any cultivator, even if the Skyeye Butterfly offers little assistance in enduring tribulations at present.</p><p>Once news spreads, it will inevitably invite greater troubles.</p><p>Qin Sang rarely allows the Skyeye Butterfly to act, partly out of this consideration.</p><p>The man in white of course understood this point.</p><p>To command tribulation lightning was unheard of.</p><p>The man in white was shocked into losing his composure, but more so worried about his own predicament.</p><p>If the opponent had not exposed tribulation lightning, there might still be room for negotiation, but now it was a matter of life and death. The opponent would never let anyone who knew the secret of tribulation lightning escape!</p><p>As the man in white anticipated.</p><p>After the Skyeye Butterfly acted, the Nascent Soul puppet’s offensive became even more ferocious, each move lethal.</p><p>‘*Hong! Hong!*’</p><p>The Skyeye Butterfly was very excited, dancing around the battlefield. The butterfly flitted elegantly, graceful in form, but the tribulation lightning she unleashed was anything but courteous.</p><p>She had been ordered by Qin Sang not to use tribulation lightning, and had been holding back for too long.</p><p>Finally, she could display her abilities to the fullest!</p><p>Targeted by the Skyeye Butterfly, the man in white’s spiritual body dared not show itself, and the fleshly body of the Rainbow Rat he controlled was no match for the Nascent Soul puppet at all, its flesh becoming tattered.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>A piercing scream suddenly came from within the Rainbow Rat’s body.</p><p>It sounded like two voices.</p><p>Immediately afterward, the Rainbow Rat’s flesh convulsed, its expression twisted, the scream more shrill and sharp with each passing moment, obviously the Rainbow Rat's consciousness was retaliating.</p><p>The Nascent Soul puppet was unaffected. The power of the puppet seal was driven to the extreme, like a black phantom, extending a huge demonic palm to grab the Rainbow Rat.</p><p>'*Pu!*'</p><p>The Nascent Soul puppet’s five fingers pierced the Rainbow Rat’s flesh, the power of the puppet seal surged in madly, wreaking havoc.</p><p>Blood splattered, instantly swept away by the surrounding violent storm, disappearing without a trace.</p><p>'*Ka!*'</p><p>Bones were shattered.</p><p>The Rainbow Rat’s eyes rolled back, the light in its eyes quickly fading.</p><p>At this moment, a phantom figure suddenly floated out of the Rainbow Rat’s head, precisely the Rainbow Rat’s essence soul. The figure, like a specter, shot toward the depths of the storm.</p><p>In the next moment, a bolt of lightning accurately struck the Rainbow Rat’s essence soul.</p><p>The essence soul collapsed on the spot.</p><p>The Rainbow Rat fell!</p><p>The Nascent Soul puppet grabbed the Rainbow Rat with one hand, flew over, and after confirming that no remnant soul had escaped, carefully examined the corpse in its hand.</p><p>Within the Rainbow Rat’s body, all aura was gone.</p><p>In the previous fierce battle, the man in white’s spiritual body had suffered internal and external troubles and was annihilated.</p><p>But strangely, the Nascent Soul puppet and the Skyeye Butterfly had never discovered the man in white’s Nascent Soul from beginning to end. It seemed to have vanished along with the spiritual body.</p><p>The Nascent Soul puppet stared straight at the Rainbow Rat, its expression stiff, its eyes mechanically turning. It retracted its palm, holding an ice box in its hand.</p><p>The ice box was exactly the same as those thrown out by the man in white on the deserted island.</p><p>However, the restriction on this ice box was obviously extraordinary.</p><p>This item was the only relic left behind after the man in white’s spiritual body dissipated.</p><p>Other things, including the fleshly body, were abandoned by the man in white.</p><p>Only this item was carried on his person.</p><p>From this, it could be seen that the contents of the ice box were very likely the Xuantian Palace treasure.</p><p>The Nascent Soul puppet grabbed the ice box, destroyed the Rainbow Rat’s corpse, and looked around. The traces of the battle had long been erased by the storm, leaving no hidden dangers.</p><p>The Skyeye Butterfly landed on the Nascent Soul puppet’s shoulder.</p><p>The butterfly and the puppet quietly left.</p><p>No one knew that a great battle had occurred here, in which a demon king and a Nascent Soul had fallen.</p><p>...</p><p>On the deserted island.</p><p>The experts of the two races were completely unaware of being deceived.</p><p>Demonic flames spread in the air, attracting the attention of the experts.</p><p>Bi Fang used his divine ability to transform, blood flame feathers covered his body. In order to fight for the treasure, he had an everything-or-nothing stance, forcefully breaking through the demonic flames.</p><p>Layers of demonic flames pounced toward Bi Fang.</p><p>The blood flame feathers resisted the demonic flames, appearing very sturdy.</p><p>In a short time, the demonic flames could not melt the blood flame feathers.</p><p>Seeing this scene, Bi Fang's confidence greatly increased, and he charged forward with all his might.</p><p>Little did he know, Qin Sang was dividing his attention to sense the Nascent Soul puppet, his main energy was not here. He symbolically blocked a few times, then no longer insisted. His figure merged with the demonic flames, and he charged toward the man in white as well.</p><p>At the same time.</p><p>Upper Master Feng and the Frog-Fish were chasing each other, and were already within reach of the man in white.</p><p>In the process of chasing.</p><p>The man in white was repeatedly injured, and now appeared very miserable, his white robes stained with blood, the wounds on his body shocking, his steps faltering, but he was still persevering.</p><p>Everyone present could not help but sigh at his tenacious will.</p><p>But it ended here!</p><p>Upper Master Feng caught the Frog-Fish off guard, urged the painting scroll to forcibly push it back, then turned his magic weapon and shot out a pillar of wind, bombarding the man in white’s back of the heart.</p><p>'*Pu!*'</p><p>The man in white was caught off guard and hit, suddenly lunging forward, falling to the ground, motionless.</p><p>Upper Master Feng’s face changed slightly, and the ominous premonition in his heart grew stronger.</p><p>The Frog-Fish rushed to the ground, fighting for the man in white’s body.</p><p>A fierce light flashed in Upper Master Feng’s eyes, and he fiercely struck out with a palm.</p><p>'*Peng!*'</p><p>The azure palm print hit the man in white.</p><p>The man in white’s fleshly body was instantly torn apart.</p><p>The next scene, however, made the experts of the two races change color.</p><p>No Nascent Soul was to be seen!</p><p>There was no aura of a nascent soul!</p><p>Only blood clots flying around.</p><p>Even the most dull-witted person felt that something was wrong.</p><p>'*Pu!*'</p><p>A shriveled mustard seed bag flew out of the flesh, and in the struggle, it was forcibly opened. What floated out were some worthless items. Where was any treasure to be seen!</p><p>"We’ve been deceived!"</p><p>The same thought flashed through everyone’s minds, and they were all furious.</p><p>So many demon kings and Nascent Souls gathered on the deserted island, but were played by a seriously injured guy. If word got out, they would be laughed at by the entire Northern Sea cultivation world.</p><p>At this time, the Nascent Soul puppet was already intercepting the Rainbow Rat.</p><p>Qin Sang learned the inside story through the Nascent Soul puppet and marveled.</p><p>He discovered that the Rainbow Rat had left the deserted island alone, and at first suspected that the Rainbow Rat might have done something, secretly stealing the treasure. He did not expect that it was really done by the man in white, who, in a desperate situation, still had the means to deceive everyone.</p><p>Qin Sang hung in mid-air, surrounded by demonic flames, quietly watching the situation.</p><p>The experts of the two races also stopped.</p><p>Upper Master Feng and Bi Fang did not hesitate, turning back to rush into the deep valley, but only saw the remains of the four jade pillars.</p><p>What the experts of the two races could not understand was, how did the man in white manage to separate his Nascent Soul under everyone’s eyes and disappear into thin air?</p><p>Bi Fang looked around, his eyes flashing with fierce light. He suddenly remembered something and shouted in a cold voice, "Where did the Rainbow Rat go?"</p><p>The demon kings looked at each other.</p><p>They then realized.</p><p>Just now, the Rainbow Rat had transmitted a sound to remind the man in white of the location of his true body, and there was no news of it after that.</p><p>The Rainbow Rat’s divine ability was mysterious. The mark left on the man in white could not be shaken off just by separating the Nascent Soul. As long as the Rainbow Rat was still around, it could easily expose the man in white.</p><p>However, the Rainbow Rat had also disappeared!</p><p>The demon kings looked at each other, and a ridiculous thought emerged in their minds. Could it be that they had all been working for the Rainbow Rat?</p><p>"You all truly have great methods! Feng admires you!"</p><p>Upper Master Feng also guessed wrong, sneering repeatedly.</p>
