<h1>Chapter 1320: The Mountain Within the Mountain</h1><p>The interior of the colossal peak was hollow!</p><p>They stood at the summit, where the footing was so narrow that only three people could stand side by side.</p><p>Within the vast mountain opening, crimson smoke filled the air, continuously rising from below. It was blocked by a barrier, gathering at the entrance and forming a thick layer of scarlet mist.</p><p>The scene inside the mountain was completely obscured by the scarlet mist.</p><p>Upon arriving here, the Fire Jade Centipede grew increasingly restless, but it was restrained by Qin Sang and unable to move.</p><p>Qin Sang lowered his head, staring at the scarlet mist for a moment before asking, "What kind of treasure does Fellow Daoist intend to refine, and what can Fellow Daoist Xiang and I do to assist?"</p><p>Bing Han replied unhurriedly, "Fellow Daoist Qin will understand once you go down and see for yourself."</p><p>As she spoke, she took out a Frost Jade Pendant and handed it to Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang accepted it and immediately felt a cool sensation flowing into his body.</p><p>The Frost Jade Pendant bore the character 'Void' . When he channeled his true essence into the character, he instantly sensed a connection to the grand formation of the forbidden land, and the surrounding heat seemed to dissipate.</p><p>"The fire poison below is fierce. This Frost Jade Pendant will save you a lot of trouble," Bing Han said before stepping lightly and disappearing into the mist.</p><p>Qin Sang followed closely behind.</p><p>He had initially planned to activate the Fire Lotus Seed to form a fire armor for protection, but since he now had the Frost Jade Pendant, he decided to hold off and observe the situation.</p><p>The two figures plummeted downward.</p><p>Under the influence of the Frost Jade Pendant, the scarlet mist parted around them.</p><p>Qin Sang had heard that the disciples of the Void Spirit Sect refined their treasures in the Mountain Within the Mountain, provided their cultivation was sufficient. However, as they descended, he didn’t see a single person.</p><p>They delved deeper and deeper.</p><p>Suddenly, Bing Han stopped ahead.</p><p>Qin Sang halted as well, noticing that the scarlet mist had disappeared, but the void around them was filled with an extremely pure and dense fiery aura. The entire space was bathed in a deep crimson hue.</p><p>"Is this the Mountain Within the Mountain?"</p><p>Following Bing Han’s gaze, Qin Sang saw the outline of a mountain in the distance.</p><p>In truth, it was a naturally formed stone.</p><p>The stone was pointed at the top and wide at the base, resembling a mountain peak. Its size was comparable to that of an actual mountain, truly deserving the name "Mountain Within the Mountain."</p><p>The entirely crimson stone mountain blended perfectly with the surrounding fiery aura. Its surface was uneven but lacked sharp edges, as if smoothed by the underground fire veins.</p><p>Qin Sang slowly descended, looking beneath the stone mountain.</p><p>To his astonishment, the space below was empty. The stone mountain floated in mid-air without any support.</p><p>He closed his eyes slightly, and upon careful sensing, he realized that the stone mountain’s suspension was not due to any barrier or spiritual formation but rather a naturally occurring phenomenon.</p><p>The underground fire veins pierced through the surrounding mountain walls, converging here to form a "Dragon Holding a Pearl" formation.</p><p>This kind of terrain was extremely rare, and the stone mountain was the pearl in the dragon’s grasp.</p><p>Perhaps the stone mountain had originally been an ordinary boulder.</p><p>Over countless years, it had been tempered by the fiery aura, transforming into its current state. The stone mountain was nearly transparent, its texture resembling jade, as if flames were burning within it.</p><p>Magnificent and dreamlike.</p><p>This was the work of nature’s divine craftsmanship, and Qin Sang couldn’t help but marvel at the beauty.</p><p>He found it strange that while he had sensed the fluctuations of the underground fire veins earlier, this place was now calm and still.</p><p>Bing Han flew toward the Mountain Within the Mountain. "Many years ago, a great earthquake shook the Cold Domain. Our sect’s founding ancestor discovered this place by chance and determined it to be the ideal location for our sect’s headquarters. Thus, the Void Spirit Sect was established here. The transformation of this mountain is partly due to the workings of heaven and earth, and partly due to the efforts of our founding ancestor."</p><p>As she spoke, Qin Sang and Bing Han landed on the mountain.</p><p>At this moment, the Fire Jade Centipede became even more agitated. Whatever was attracting it was inside the Mountain Within the Mountain!</p><p>Qin Sang finally sensed a faint pulsation coming from deep within the mountain.</p><p>The pulsation was weak, like the beating of a heart.</p><p>"Could it be…?"</p><p>Qin Sang’s eyes showed a hint of surprise.</p><p>Bing Han nodded. "Our founding ancestor predicted that a unique fire spirit would be born within this mountain. The grand formation of the forbidden land was set up to accelerate its birth. For many years, our sect has been preparing for this moment, but no one knew when it would happen or what form it would take. It wasn’t until a century ago that signs finally appeared, emanating from a core fire jade deep within the Mountain Within the Mountain."</p><p>"Fellow Daoist intends to refine the fire spirit and this fire jade into a treasure? No wonder you need Fellow Daoist Xiang and me to assist," Qin Sang said, now understanding Bing Han’s plan.</p><p>"Exactly! The fire spirit and the fire jade are symbiotic. By refining the fire jade into a spiritual embryo and continuing to nurture it within the Mountain Within the Mountain, there’s a possibility it will develop sentience!" Bing Han explained.</p><p>"This fire spirit was born here and is inseparable from the Mountain Within the Mountain. It can easily harness the power of the fire veins, and it will instinctively resist. The methods prepared by our ancestors have had little effect on it. After much deliberation, I came up with a plan to use a special spiritual formation to suppress it. However, we also need a high-grade spiritual fire that the fire spirit instinctively fears to easily subdue it."</p><p>As she spoke, Bing Han glanced at Qin Sang. "Throughout the North Star Realm, there are a few fellow Daoists skilled in fire manipulation, but the only spiritual fire that surpasses that of the Mountain Within the Mountain is the Ancestral Sacred Fire of the Azure Sun Demon Sect. Fellow Daoist Qin’s spiritual fire, as demonstrated at the Divine Peak, seems to surpass even the Ancestral Sacred Fire. Fellow Daoist Xiang Qing tried earlier, but the Ancestral Sacred Fire within him is still too weak to fully suppress the fire spirit. Instead, he was targeted by it, causing fire poison to invade his body and nearly leading to disaster. We had to stop hastily. If the two of you work together, it should be much easier. Refining this spiritual treasure is of great significance to the Void Spirit Sect. Now you understand why I demanded such a strict oath from you."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded.</p><p>The earlier fluctuations in the underground fire veins were caused by the fire spirit’s resistance.</p><p>Bing Han and Xiang Qing had tried countless times but failed, which was why they needed his help.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist has great courage! Once the spiritual treasure is refined, the Void Spirit Sect will prosper for generations. However, you mentioned earlier that you intend to refine it into a spiritual embryo and continue nurturing it here. By the time it develops sentience and becomes a spiritual treasure, it will be many years from now. It’s unlikely that you yourself will be able to use it, right?"</p><p>In truth, there might be another option.</p><p>Bing Han was skilled in artifact refinement. If she found a way to integrate the fire jade into her own life-bound treasure, it would be easier to refine a spiritual treasure.</p><p>However, this would only benefit her personally.</p><p>Moreover, it would require Bing Han to have the confidence to break through to the mid or even late Nascent Soul stage. Otherwise, the efforts of the Void Spirit Sect’s ancestors would be wasted.</p><p>Bing Han gazed quietly at the stone mountain and said softly, "If the spiritual treasure is refined and future generations of the Void Spirit Sect can benefit from it, I can rest in peace, knowing I have fulfilled my duty as sect master."</p><p>Qin Sang fell silent, feeling a newfound respect for Bing Han.</p><p>Among the righteous sect leaders of the Cold Domain, those he had interacted with—Chongyi Daoist, Bing Han, and even Dongyang Bo—all possessed the courage and vision to act in the best interests of their sects.</p><p>"Let’s go take a look at that fire jade," Qin Sang said.</p><p>It seemed that the treasure attracting the Fire Jade Centipede was indeed the fire jade.</p><p>The process of Bing Han refining the spiritual embryo would be of great reference value to him.</p>
