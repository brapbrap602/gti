Chapter 470: The Duel

After dozens of rounds, Qin Sang had a pretty good grasp of the young man's abilities.  His cultivation was comparable to Senior Brother Rong and Miao Xinglan, but his combat experience was far inferior, even to the mediocre Jindan stage cultivators on Guanxing Island.

However, he possessed a plethora of treasures. After using talismans, he consecutively unleashed several magical artifacts, dazzling and overwhelming. Each was extraordinary, possessing formidable power, making them difficult to guard against.  Qin Sang had to remain calm and composed to counter them.  He suspected the young man's background was extraordinary.

Unfortunately, the young man was ultimately too inexperienced. These artifacts couldn't translate his advantage into victory, and this was even without Qin Sang using the Ebony Sword.

As the exchange continued, Qin Sang found himself increasingly at ease, even able to multitask and discreetly observe another battle.  Madam Jing was fighting two opponents at once.

Qin Sang then realized that Qingluan was far more than just a mount; it possessed terrifying strength, matching the magical artifact wielder, Yu Shan Ting, blow for blow, without falling behind. Qingluan helped Madam Jing separate her two opponents, allowing her to focus on the Elder Zhangxing.

Yu Shan Ting knew that Madam Jing was the primary target and didn't want to remain entangled with Qingluan, attempting to force Qingluan back to join forces with Elder Zhangxing, but was consistently unsuccessful.

‘Dang!’

A loud bell resonated, shaking the heavens and earth, its echoes lingering. Purple energy filled the air, at times condensing into swords and blades, swift as lightning and razor-sharp; at others transforming into various ferocious beasts – dragons, phoenixes, lions, tigers, and more – their ferocity reaching the sky…

Whether blades or beasts, none were a match for Qingluan, quickly torn apart by its sharp claws and beak.  The bronze bell proved ineffective against Qingluan. Yu Shan Ting repeatedly failed, narrowly avoiding being pecked several times. His composure crumbled, his eyes blazing with rage.

‘Dang!’

This bell toll was extraordinary, deep and resonant. The bronze bell trembled violently. Amidst the lingering buzzing, it left Yu Shan Ting's head, soaring into the air before descending towards Qingluan.

Endless purple energy erupted, covering the sky and earth. At that moment, the bronze bell seemed like a towering mountain, its momentum unstoppable, wind and thunder surging, aiming to envelop, subdue, refine, and crush Qingluan into dust.

The bell itself wasn't actually larger than Qingluan's body.  Somehow, its immense shadow covered the entire sky, engulfing Qingluan.  The increasingly loud bell's reverberations were soul-stirring, like a cataclysmic roar, its power immense.

A look of human-like seriousness appeared in Qingluan’s eyes, further fueling Qin Sang’s doubts about whether it was a wooden carving or a true Qingluan.  Qingluan, an ancient divine beast, existed only in legends, comparable to dragons and phoenixes. Even with Madam Jing's strength, finding and subduing one would be impossible.

If it were a spirit puppet, how powerful a puppetry technique would be needed to imbue a wooden carving with such lifelike spirit?

Facing the menacing bronze bell, Qingluan let out a series of urgent cries, its fighting spirit intensifying.  Without calling for Madam Jing's help, it spread its wings wide.  Its green feathers radiated a green light, gathering into an ever-deepening glow. The feathers seemed to melt, igniting with green flames.  Qingluan transformed into a true divine bird, reborn from fire.

‘Li!’

With a magnificent cry, the bell's sound faded. Qingluan glared at the bronze bell, its green flames shooting skyward, a column of fire directly targeting the bell.

‘Boom!’

A loud explosion echoed as the bronze bell was engulfed in green flames.  But within the green fire, faint purple energy could be seen, the purple qi persisting, resisting the burning flames.

Yu Shan Ting rapidly changed his hand seals, the bronze bell continuously shaking. Qingluan, refusing to yield, continuously released its green flames.

Both the man and the beast were giving their all, locked in a stalemate. It seemed unlikely either would prevail quickly. Qin Sang couldn't tell who would ultimately win, so he turned his attention to Madam Jing.

Unexpectedly, the duel between Madam Jing and Elder Zhangxing was even more profound, lacking any trace of ordinary fighting techniques, making it even harder to predict. Qin Sang could discern some clues in the fight between Yu Shan Ting and Qingluan, but between Madam Jing and Elder Zhangxing, he could only watch, unable to determine who had the upper hand.

Night sky, moon, stars.  Under the starry sky conjured by two magical artifacts, Madam Jing and Elder Zhangxing hovered in mid-air. The moon seemed brighter than before, a silver disc hanging high above.


Old Madam Jing, serene as a bodhisattva, sat cross-legged in the air, her eyes closed.  Behind her, the Landscape and Hidden Moon scroll floated, though the moon within was gone.

A thousand miles of mountains and rivers stretched before them, a sea of clouds swirling and shifting, the painting seeming to come alive.

The Star-Master, ignoring Old Madam Jing, held his arms aloft. True to his name, his hands blurred, manipulating the stars.

He could pluck stars, but not the moon.

The stars became pieces in his game, forming various killing formations.  Different coloured starlight lashed out at Old Madam Jing and the moon.

These formations shifted rapidly, each with immense power.  The Star-Master's artifact left Qin Sang utterly amazed.

Starlight aimed at the moon was stopped by its light.

Starlight aimed at Old Madam Jing was absorbed by the Landscape and Hidden Moon scroll.  While causing the cloud sea to churn violently, it seemed to cause her no harm.

Soon, Qin Sang noticed something else.

Stars at the edge of the starry sky dimmed and vanished one by one, as if extinguished by the moonlight, never reappearing.

When a star disappeared, that area of space plunged into darkness, creating a strange ripple, within which barely visible cracks seemed to form.

While creating killing formations to attack Old Madam Jing, the Star-Master would draw other stars towards the edge, repairing the areas plunged into darkness.

This seemed necessary to prevent the artificial night sky created by his artifact from collapsing.

Qin Sang shifted his gaze to the Star-Master.

Under the increasingly bright moonlight, the Star-Master stared unblinkingly at the night sky, his expression grave.  His face, glistening with sweat reflecting the starlight, looked flushed.

This was in stark contrast to Old Madam Jing's composure.

Judging by their performance and their artifacts, Qin Sang thought Old Madam Jing had the upper hand, but was unsure.

Qin Sang couldn't remain focused, however, because the attack of the handsome young man suddenly intensified.

The young man noticed Qin Sang's divided attention, feeling insulted and enraged.

Worse, he’d used all his abilities against an opponent weaker than himself, one who dared to be inattentive in battle, yet still couldn't overcome him.

"You're courting death!"

He roared, his hatred for Qin Sang boiling over, unleashing the full power of his artifact.

The black light, produced by the artifact, danced in the air, swift and elusive, yet visible to Qin Sang.

The black hammer still couldn’t break through the blue mirror's defenses, not even touching Qin Sang's clothing.
