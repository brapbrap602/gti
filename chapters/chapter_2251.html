<h1>Chapter 2241: Stepping Forward</h1><p>“Once the truth is uncovered, Mount Yuanjing will never shield any murderer!”</p><p>Qing Yan stood before the mountain gate, facing the cultivators of the Qingjiang Sect, and declared loudly.</p><p>He only learned the full story after returning to the mountain gate. Seeing the state of the deceased Sha, he felt the gravity of the situation.</p><p>Qing Yan wanted to resolve this conflict, but the Qingjiang Sect didn't seem to want a solution.  Abusive language rained down on them, and some even openly cursed Master Tongshen, igniting a furious rage within Qing Yan, his disciple.</p><p>He suppressed his anger, trying to appease the Qingjiang Sect and prevent a war between the two sects.</p><p>Yu Chen, the Qingjiang Sect’s head disciple, sneered, abruptly pointing at Lan Jingchuan. “The murderer is right here. What more is there to investigate? Besides, a mere third-generation disciple, acting alone, dares to murder the great elder’s grandson? Do you think handing over the culprit is enough?”</p><p>Qing Yan’s face darkened.  “Brother Yu, what do you mean by that?”</p><p>“What do I mean?”</p><p>Yu Chen coldly snorted. “Not only the murderer, but all those behind him must be handed over to die and atone for their crimes, only then can we appease the spirits of Elder Sha and Sha the attendant!”</p><p>His words caused an uproar.</p><p>Even the dullest among them saw the signs.  The Qingjiang Sect’s intentions went beyond simple revenge.</p><p>Lan Jingchuan’s master was the second disciple of Master Tongshen, Qing Hong, who currently managed all affairs of Mount Yuanjing and was the acknowledged next leader.</p><p>Besides her, who else could be behind this?</p><p>If it were only Lan Jingchuan, Mount Yuanjing might have been able to cut off the rot and hand him over. But Yu Chen directly implicated Qing Hong, leaving Mount Yuanjing with no way out.  This matter could not end peacefully.</p><p>The question was, why was the Qingjiang Sect doing this?</p><p>Qing Yan's eyes turned cold.</p><p>Qing Hong and Shuang Luo's faces were frosty.</p><p>Lan Jingchuan, seeing that the trouble he caused had implicated his master, was filled with grief and anger.</p><p>In the distance, the elder in green robes and others observed the argument.</p><p>The young man in white finally looked away from the two women, glanced at the Qingjiang Sect leader, and said, “Tell him to stop wasting words.”</p><p>The Qingjiang Sect leader nodded, his lips moved slightly as he transmitted his voice to Yu Chen.</p><p>Following this, Yu Chen’s attitude became even more adamant.  After a heated argument, he proposed a duel with Qing Yan.</p><p>“Thanks to you, back then, Yu Chen still remembers it, vowing to avenge that shame. Dare you fight me again? If you win, this matter will be settled. I will immediately lead the Qingjiang Sect down the mountain and never mention it again!”</p><p>Yu Chen’s voice became increasingly agitated as he stared at Qing Yan, his eyes blazing.</p><p>It turned out that the two sects’ head disciples had once sparred, but Yu Chen had lost to Qing Yan, failing to restore honor to the Qingjiang Sect.</p><p>Everyone suddenly understood.  Enemies meeting is a fiery encounter, and Yu Chen's challenge made perfect sense. The Qingjiang Sect elders didn't stop him.</p><p>“Senior Brother, I fear they have a trick up their sleeves!” Qing Hong transmitted her voice to Qing Yan, worried.</p><p>Qing Yan sighed. “Even if Jingchuan atones with his life, the Qingjiang Sect won’t stop. Should we really hand over Junior Sister?”</p><p>Qing Hong lowered her head.  “It’s all my fault for poor guidance.”</p><p>“It’s not your fault, Junior Sister,” Qing Yan shook his head. “The Qingjiang Sect clearly planned this for a long time.  Master and I underestimated the Sect Leader’s ambition, leaving a hidden danger. The only way is to win this duel to solve this once and for all. Otherwise, if they attack the mountain and disturb Master’s cultivation, we will be unworthy of our lives.”</p><p>“But…”</p><p>“Junior Sister, no need to persuade me further. Yu Chen was defeated by me back then, and I can defeat him again today! My cultivation has improved recently. My younger brother sent me several secret techniques of the Way of Thunder, which I just perfected. I'm eager to test their power!”</p><p>A cold light appeared in Qing Yan’s eyes as he spoke coldly.</p><p>Seeing his determination, Qing Hong and Shuang Luo could no longer dissuade him.</p><p>Both sides retreated, clearing a large space for the battlefield, leaving only Qing Yan and Yu Chen.</p><p>Qing Yan and Yu Chen glared at each other, fiercely opposed.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>A thunderous roar shocked everyone.</p><p>Above Qing Yan, the sky was clear, yet a thunderball spontaneously formed. Within the ball, red and blue lightning twisted like dragons and snakes.</p><p>Initially the size of a fist, the ball gradually expanded, and the lightning within grew thicker.</p><p>The two colored lightnings, one burning like fire, the other calm as water, possessed completely different temperaments, yet combined perfectly without conflict.</p><p>Everyone’s gaze was drawn to the strange ball of lightning. Even knowing of Yuanjing Mountain’s unique lineage and its mastery of both water and fire, the onlookers were still amazed to see Qingyan wield such power.</p><p>“Indeed, there’s something to it,”</p><p>a young man in white, idly fanning himself, remarked.  “Qibo, if Tongshen were to emerge from seclusion now, what are your chances of victory?”</p><p>The elder in green robes replied, “Tongshen has long since established a formidable reputation, and his abilities are unique. I am no match for him. However, regardless, I will protect the young master with my life.”</p><p>“Of course, I trust Qibo’s abilities.  Can anything about Tongshen’s powers be gleaned from this person?”</p><p>The young man in white knew Qibo was a top-tier expert. Qibo called himself a servant because his father owed Qibo a life debt and had insisted on his servitude. His father had repeatedly warned him not to mistreat Qibo.</p><p>Qibo stared at Qingyan for a moment before shaking his head. “This person is different from Tongshen. He specializes in lightning techniques and is an anomaly within Yuanjing Mountain.  Furthermore, Tongshen's mastery surely surpasses this disciple's, making any deduction difficult.”</p><p>“Since he’s of little value, let’s not waste time. Let You quickly finish this,” the young man in white said dismissively.</p><p>On the field, the ball of lightning expanded to its limit, thunder echoing deafeningly through the mountains.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>The lightning ball shot out two bolts, one red and one blue, like two thunder dragons, their power awe-inspiring and terrifying as they lunged towards Youchen.</p><p>Youchen’s eyes narrowed. In his vision, the two bolts of lightning merged into one.</p><p>The speed and ferocity of the lightning were overwhelming, striking Youchen directly and causing his heart to pound.</p><p>Although his earlier words were a ruse, designed to provoke Qingyan into action, they also reflected his true feelings.  His past defeat at the hands of his former master and Qingyan remained a lifelong humiliation; he had since trained relentlessly, significantly improving his strength.</p><p>He had thought he would surpass Qingyan and avenge that humiliation. Now he realized Qingyan had also grown immensely stronger!</p><p>In an instant, the lightning was upon him.</p><p>A silver light shot from Youchen’s chest, hovering before him, revealing a small silver figure.  The figure had the same features as Youchen, like a puppet.</p><p>It carried a long blade on its shoulder and, facing the lightning, its eyes shone with light before it raised the blade and struck the lightning with force.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>Such a small blade unleashed a powerful wave, transforming into a terrifying blade aura.</p><p>‘Rumble…’</p><p>The clash of blade aura and lightning blotted out the sun and shook the earth.</p><p>The onlookers watched with wide eyes, the battlefield filled with chaotic air currents, making it impossible to discern whose power prevailed.</p><p>It seemed a draw.</p><p>Yet Youchen felt a bitter taste in his mouth.  With just that one blow, he understood he was still no match for his opponent. He simply couldn't defeat Qingyan with his own strength.</p><p>Perhaps he would never honorably defeat Qingyan in his lifetime.</p><p>Hearing his master’s urging, Youchen cast aside his thoughts, merging with the silver figure and charging towards his opponent.</p><p>At that moment, the lightning ball above Qingyan vanished, but lightning filled the entire battlefield.</p><p>Thunder roared, and lightning crackled across the battlefield, obscuring Qingyan and Youchen from view.  Yet, it was clear to all that Qingyan had gained the upper hand.</p><p>The crowd turned to the Qingjiang Sect, and their disciples’ faces showed clear apprehension. Conversely, those from Yuanjing Mountain were jubilant, except Qinghong and Shuangluo, who remained tense and vigilant.</p><p>It was obvious Youchen had been overconfident, overestimating his ability to defeat Qingyan. The disparity in their strengths was far greater than he anticipated. Unless Youchen had more up his sleeve, the Qingjiang Sect would be retreating in disgrace.</p><p>As the onlookers thought this, a sudden change occurred on the battlefield. A light brighter than the lightning erupted, seemingly composed of countless beams of light, accompanied by a roar.</p><p>The roar, filled with rage and surprise, appeared to be from Qingyan.</p><p>‘Swish swish swish!’</p><p>The light beams shot out, striking the lightning and causing it to dissipate.</p><p>Qinghong had a premonition of disaster. Upon seeing this, she felt a jolt of fear.  Immediately afterward, she saw a figure fly from the battlefield, its form contorted, blood spattering.</p><p>“Senior Brother!”</p><p>Qinghong and Shuangluo were startled and immediately rushed towards the battlefield.</p><p>“Those from Yuanjing Mountain are nothing but villains, trying to sabotage the duel!”</p><p>The Qingjiang Sect elders shouted, intervening to stop the two women.</p><p>Fortunately, Qinghong and Shuangluo had been on guard.  They immediately activated the mountain-protecting formation.  Waves of light surged from one of the pillars, blocking the Qingjiang Sect elders’ attack and shielding Qingyan.</p><p>“Senior Brother!”</p><p>The two women caught Qingyan. His face was ashen, his breathing shallow.  A gaping wound, reaching his vital organs, was visible on his chest.</p><p>Frantically, they gave him healing pills, helping him absorb their power.  Qingyan finally stabilized, glaring at You Chen. “卑鄙!  Cough…”</p><p>You Chen held a three-inch jade arrow, riddled with cracks.  It shattered, fragments scattering through his fingers.  His face was pale, not from injury, but from depleted energy.</p><p>The arrow was the weapon that had gravely wounded Qingyan. It wasn't an ordinary treasure, but a single-use artifact capable of unleashing all its power in an instant.  Such artifacts were incredibly powerful but extremely rare in the cultivation world, demanding high craftsmanship and a steep price.</p><p>This was a life-saving weapon. No one expected You Chen to possess one, much less use it in a duel.</p><p>“Hehe…”</p><p>You Chen sneered, refusing to answer. “You’ve lost. Hand over the culprit, open the mountain gates, and let us investigate!”</p><p>Having crippled Qingyan, their strongest fighter, You Chen knew the Qingjiang Sect wouldn't agree. He ordered a renewed assault on the mountain.</p><p>Then, an unexpected guest arrived.</p><p>“Wait!”</p><p>A figure flew down from the mountain.  His movements were graceful and effortless, parting the crowd as he passed.  All eyes were on him.</p><p>It was a young man in white.  In a flash, he was before the Source Purity Mountain gate, standing between the two factions.</p><p>“Who are you?  Do you want to die?!” You Chen roared.</p><p>Unfazed, the young man spoke calmly, “I am Chen Yuze of the Sky Purity Sect.”</p><p>His bearing was composed, even more striking in this tense situation.</p><p>He smiled gently at Shuangluo, “Miss Shuang, we meet again.”</p><p>“Master Chen?”</p><p>Shuangluo looked surprised.</p><p>“Junior Sister, do you know him?” Qinghong asked via telepathy.</p><p>Shuangluo replied, “Senior Sister, remember when you sent me to guard the Jade Rinse Valley?  On the way, I met some cultivators traveling from outside the region near the Qingtuo River.  This Master Chen was among them.  But I was in a hurry to reach Jade Rinse Valley and only spoke briefly to them.”</p><p>“Miss Shuang comes from a prestigious background.  No wonder your aura is refined, like a fairy descended to earth,” Chen Yuze complimented, turning to Qinghong. “May I ask this fairy’s name?”</p><p>“She’s my senior sister, Qinghong.  Our sect is in trouble.  Forgive the intrusion. Please step aside to avoid being caught in the crossfire,” Shuangluo bowed.</p><p>Chen Yuze smiled. “I came to resolve this conflict, not to retreat in the face of adversity!”</p><p>He turned to You Chen.  “You’ve already injured Miss Shuang’s senior brother.  May I suggest a compromise to end this hostility?”</p><p>You Chen looked surprised.  “You said you’re from the Sky Purity Sect?”</p><p>“Indeed!”</p><p>Chen Yuze remained calm. “Do I have the standing to mediate?”</p><p>You Chen's expression shifted, then he sneered. “So, that’s where they found their lover boy, a high-ranking cultivator from the Sky Purity Sect.  But as far as I know, the Sky Purity Sect has no connection with Source Purity Mountain.  Unless you’re their lover, why should you be here? The Sky Purity Sect's influence shouldn't reach the Qingtuo River!”</p><p>The onlookers, however, sensed You Chen’s bravado was a facade, and started inquiring about the Sky Purity Sect.</p><p>Qinghong quipped, “Junior Sister, judging by Mr. You’s words, if you marry Master Chen, this problem would be solved.”</p><p>Shuangluo retorted, “Why not Senior Sister?”</p><p>“I’m afraid he might not be interested in Senior Sister!”</p><p>Qinghong turned serious, “This Master Chen’s appearance is suspicious. Junior Sister, don’t be misled by appearances. Be cautious.”</p><p>Shuangluo said firmly, “I understand. But without outside help, how can we break this deadlock?  Are we really going to force Master to break her seclusion?”</p><p>Qinghong’s expression was grave. They had prepared some last resorts to buy time, but Qingyan’s defeat had rendered them useless. They were in a desperate situation.</p><p>You Chen gave them no time to think, immediately ordering a full-scale attack.</p>
