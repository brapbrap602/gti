<h1>Chapter 1838: Sword Song</h1><p>Qingluan's shadow fell on the cave walls.</p><p>Qin Sang bathed in the green light, his breathing deep and slow, then fell into a long silence.</p><p>The Qingluan Dharma image slowly flapped its wings, circling above Qin Sang's head, its beautiful light shimmering.</p><p>Shortly after, a drum-like sound echoed from within Qin Sang, as if all his flesh, blood, and marrow trembled simultaneously, and extremely powerful vital energy surged forth.</p><p>Purple-red light soon filled the cave, constantly flashing with various mystical runes, and shadowy banners appeared, indicating the protective formation had been activated.</p><p>Vital energy steamed.</p><p>The Qingluan Dharma image flapped its wings faster, raising its neck and letting out a long cry, as if about to break free from its constraints and soar into the heavens.</p><p>Unfortunately, the good times didn't last.</p><p>Qin Sang's energy increased to a certain point and then stalled, maintaining it with difficulty for a short time before slowly declining.</p><p>Following this, the green light on the Qingluan Dharma image dimmed, its momentum plummeting, finally transforming into a green light that merged back into Qin Sang.</p><p>Gradually calming his agitated vital energy, Qin Sang opened his eyes and murmured, "I failed..."</p><p>A butterfly shadow flickered. The Tianmu Butterfly flew back from the cave entrance, sensing its master's low spirits. It gently brushed its wings against Qin Sang's face, offering comfort in its own way.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes quickly regained their brilliance. Looking at the butterfly trying to console him, he smiled, lifting a hand to let the Tianmu Butterfly land on his fingertip. He took out a Yinghua Pill.</p><p>In the past, as soon as Qin Sang produced a Yinghua Pill, the Tianmu Butterfly would immediately try to grab it from his finger.  If he didn't give it to her immediately, the butterfly's eyes would mist over.</p><p>This time, however, the Tianmu Butterfly seemed not to notice the pill. Its eye patterns remained fixed on Qin Sang, its eyes subtly flickering as it observed his expression, confirming his mood had recovered before carefully refining the Yinghua Pill and landing obediently on his shoulder.</p><p>In fact, this failure was within Qin Sang's expectations. He had just reached the peak of the mid-fifth level of the *Tianyao Lianxing* technique a few days ago and had tried to break through prematurely, without sufficient preparation.</p><p>The Tianmu Butterfly's mood had been affected by its master, and Qin Sang in turn reassured it, reviewing the breakthrough process.</p><p>Although he had failed, he had gained something.</p><p>"There's still plenty of poisonous fruit juice left; the breakthrough shouldn't be too difficult," Qin Sang mused, his figure flickering as he appeared outside the cave and flew into the aperture.</p><p>The shadows within the aperture had been cleared, leaving only the poisonous fruit suspended in mid-air.</p><p>Compared to decades ago, the fruit's luster had dimmed and it had shrunk, its skin wrinkled and somewhat shriveled, as if dried out and dehydrated.</p><p>This was due to Qin Sang continuously extracting the juice without replenishment from new flower dew.</p><p>The fruit's thick and rich poison had propelled Qin Sang's rapid progress in a short time, bringing him close to a breakthrough.</p><p>At least until the poisonous fruit juice was depleted, his cultivation speed would not slow down—an achievement that would be incredibly shocking to anyone.</p><p>Qin Sang skillfully extracted a drop of juice, sealed it in a jade bottle, and exited the aperture.</p><p>Just as he was about to return to the cave, he suddenly stopped, turning to look towards the rear of the flower field, in the direction of the deep altar.</p><p>He had reached a bottleneck; no matter how hard he cultivated, he couldn't progress further. It would be better to explore the altar during this time.</p><p>Exploring its strange illusions might give him inspiration and help him break through.</p><p>Qin Sang made his decision, but wasn't in a rush to act. He first returned to the cave to consolidate his cultivation, then summoned the altar, released the Fire Jade Centipede, and took out a Qingshuang Pill.  The first pill's energy had already been digested by the centipede.</p><p>The pill was ingested.</p><p>The Fire Jade Centipede's reaction was similar to last time: it curled up its entire body, resisting the pill's energy in pain, struggling to find an opportunity to break through.</p><p>This time, the fluctuation in the centipede's energy was stronger than before, but ultimately it subsided, still unsuccessful.</p><p>"We share the same plight," Qin Sang shook his head, retracting the Fire Jade Centipede into the altar, a hint of gloom flashing in his eyes.</p><p>After two pills, the Fire Jade Centipede hadn't undergone any qualitative change.  If this continued, even if it took a third Qingshuang Pill, it might still be unsuccessful.</p><p>Qin Sang frowned, deciding to select some secret techniques from the *Panhu Zhenjing* and devote more effort to the Fire Jade Centipede.</p><p>Several days later, Qin Sang left the flower fields and, following a familiar path, went deeper into the ritual grounds.  Thousands upon thousands of golden and red spirit needles filled his vision.</p><p>Qin Sang returned to the spot he had visited with Mo Xingdao. He carefully studied the reflection before him, believing that understanding the nature of the reflection would reveal the true location of the spirit needles.</p><p>Floating before the reflection, the spirit needles were within arm's reach, some even brushing against his nose.  Though he knew they were reflections, the threat they posed felt utterly real.</p><p>An intensely sharp aura emanated from the countless needles, locked in an endless conflict with their counterparts. This standoff had lasted for an immeasurable time, seemingly without end. Millions upon millions of golden and red needles clashed, their points meeting in the center before dissolving into nothingness.  To enter rashly would mean suffering the agony of thousands of piercings.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes gleamed as he silently activated his celestial eye ability, observing for a full incense stick's worth of time. Then, he suddenly stepped into the sea of needles.</p><p>'Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!'</p><p>The sound of needles piercing the air filled his ears from all directions.  Qin Sang's pupils constricted as a golden needle hurtled towards his right eye, about to pierce it.</p><p>A sharp pain shot through his right eye, his heart pounded, yet he remained unmoving, offering no resistance.</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>The golden needle pierced his right pupil, the pain reaching its peak before abruptly vanishing. Qin Sang was unharmed; the needle passed clean through his head, reappearing at the back of his skull before continuing its trajectory towards the red needles.  The same happened with all the other needles striking him; they passed right through as if he were not there.</p><p>"It's a reflection…," Qin Sang thought.</p><p>The pain had been intensely real.  Anyone else, even if they suspected the truth, would not dare to attempt such a thing.</p><p>Pausing briefly, Qin Sang continued forward, moving through the needle sea unscathed. He changed direction, entering the area of red needles and observing carefully. After moving for some time, he let out a soft exclamation, discovering he had exited the needle sea, and a cloud of auspicious vapor lay before him.</p><p>"This…,"</p><p>Qin Sang frowned, puzzled.  The reflection of the golden and red needles couldn't be appearing here without reason.  It must be some kind of illusion, but he hadn't detected any anomaly even after passing through the needle sea.</p><p>Turning back to the sea of needles, Qin Sang fell into deep thought.  He then sat cross-legged in the auspicious cloud, allowing his celestial eye butterfly to land on his shoulder. Using his bloodline secret technique as a conduit, he channeled his ability to its fullest extent.</p><p>In his vision, the spirit needles changed.  Instead of individual needles, he saw their trajectories, forming golden and red threads in the void.  The threads were densely packed, like countless琴弦 .</p><p>Then, the threads gradually faded from Qin Sang's sight.  It wasn't that the needles disappeared; he was deliberately ignoring them, filtering out all interference to perceive the underlying reality.</p><p>Fueled by the ancient tribal technique, both the butterfly's celestial eyes and Qin Sang's own turned blood red, emitting an eerie glow.</p><p>As the threads vanished, the void was laid bare before him, seemingly empty.  Gradually, Qin Sang smiled knowingly.  He returned to the needle sea with his celestial eye butterfly, moving swiftly to the center.</p><p>The two types of needles converged there, but Qin Sang ignored them.  He raised his right hand and slid it across the void.  A mark appeared where his finger had passed, like a slit in the void, instantly closing up.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered for a moment, then summoned his Azure Bird apparition without hesitation.  The apparition integrated into his body, dramatically boosting his strength.  He formed a Buddha hand seal and struck out with a powerful palm strike.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The void trembled.  The reflected needle sea undulated like water, a hole appearing at the point of convergence – a gateway.  Qin Sang instantly turned and squeezed into the crack, mysteriously vanishing.</p><p>The ripples subsided, the needle sea restored to its former state.</p><p>Moments later, Qin Sang reappeared, staggering back several meters, quite disheveled, as if forcibly ejected.  Standing firm, he stared at the spot where he had entered, his eyes filled with wonder.</p><p>Having passed through the reflection into reality, he had encountered only pitch blackness.  Neither he nor the celestial eye butterfly could see anything before being repelled by a powerful force.</p><p>Even with his apparition and Buddha hand seal – his full strength – he could not maintain his position.  Fortunately, the repulsive force was not harmful.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered for a moment, then once again shattered the gateway to reality.  He entered again and again, each time being driven back, tirelessly working day and night within the ritual grounds.  Despite the incredibly short duration of each attempt, his persistence finally yielded new discoveries.</p><p>His eyes brightened, and his final breakthrough was accompanied by a hearty laugh.</p><p>Qin Sang retreated to the Xiangyun area, looked at his palm, and circulated his spiritual energy to draw in mid-air.</p><p>Several runes were created in one go.</p><p>Each rune seemed incomplete, barely forming a whole, yet it was one of the most complex runes Qin Sang had ever seen.</p><p>The runes transformed into a black disc.</p><p>The black disc was as deep as a black hole. Qin Sang examined it, pressed his left hand onto it, and a circular mark instantly appeared on his palm.</p><p>Feeling the rune mark, Qin Sang nodded secretly, "As expected!"</p><p>This incomplete rune was his only gain in the darkness.  Its origin and function were unknown, but through the rune, Qin Sang felt a vague connection, seemingly emanating from the depths of the altar.</p><p>He guessed that the reason for the reflection here was that these runes were fragmented, and another part of the runes reflected the scene from there through a special connection.</p><p>Following the connection of the rune mark, he might find the Red Gold Spiritual Needle, undoubtedly simpler than searching everywhere.</p><p>Qin Sang looked relieved and began to meditate on the spot, restoring his peak strength before following the faint connection into the depths of the altar.</p><p>The altar space was far deeper and more dangerous than he imagined, filled with the unknown.</p><p>The further he went, the more strenuous it became for Qin Sang. He was constantly prepared to use his Dharma manifestation and Buddhist seals; even so, sometimes he had to risk danger and try multiple times to barely pass a single illusion.</p><p>These dangerous experiences broadened Qin Sang's horizons; each new illusion was a novel experience.</p><p>A month later.</p><p>Qin Sang entered a long corridor where various bizarre creatures roamed, which he fought his way through.</p><p>Three months later.</p><p>Qin Sang entered a stone forest and was attacked, but he never saw the enemy.</p><p>At the cost of injury, he discovered some patterns and managed to escape the stone forest.</p><p>Six months later.</p><p>Qin Sang entered a landmass but was attacked by strange monsters made of water.</p><p>The monsters came in various forms, lacked intelligence, and resembled puppets.  When scattered, they didn't disappear but merged with their brethren, strengthening them.</p><p>This time, Qin Sang was stalled for almost a year. He tried to bypass them, but he always returned and was repelled by the final monster.</p><p>Eventually, with the help of the Tianmu butterfly, he found a weakness in the monsters and set a trap to overcome this obstacle.</p><p>At the end of the second year.</p><p>Qin Sang arrived at a void space.</p><p>Upon entering, a heavy pressure immediately came from above, and a huge Xuanhuang stone appeared out of nowhere and plummeted.</p><p>No matter which direction he entered from, he couldn't avoid the stone.</p><p>Qin Sang's body glowed bright green, his arms raised high, his muscles bulging as he held the stone aloft, struggling to move forward.</p><p>With each step, the stone became heavier.</p><p>One step, two steps... ten steps... a hundred steps...</p><p>Qin Sang's arms trembled, and his face flushed red.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The stone suddenly sank.</p><p>His arms bent sharply, almost crushed by the stone. Qin Sang roared, his blood energy surging, and he forcefully lifted the stone.</p><p>Simultaneously, Qin Sang's eyes shone brightly, and he immediately abandoned his advance and retreated.</p><p>This retreat took him straight back to the flower field, his first return to his cave dwelling in two years.</p><p>Back in his cave, Qin Sang eagerly meditated and practiced his cultivation techniques.</p><p>A few days later, a loud phoenix cry echoed from the cave, and the violent blood energy nearly broke through the protective formation.</p><p>The fifth stage, latter half of the *Heavenly Demon Body Refinement* technique, achieved!</p><p>Qin Sang looked up at his Azure-luan Dharma manifestation, pondering for a long time.</p><p>Entering the later stage, the Azure-luan Dharma manifestation had become more solid, but it hadn't condensed into a true Dharma manifestation as Qin Sang had hoped—no qualitative change.</p><p>The gap between the Transcendence and Void Refinement realms was like a chasm, not something a mere cultivation technique could bridge.</p><p>However, the improvement in his Dharma manifestation and physique brought earth-shattering changes to Qin Sang.</p><p>Now, if he faced Xia Hou again, he wouldn't be as clumsy as last time, even if Xia Hou was at his peak in both forms.</p><p>Also, Qin Sang confirmed his long-held suspicion that the effect of the Dharma manifestation shadow at the Transcendence realm wasn't to enhance combat power but to allow cultivators a glimpse into the path of the Dharma manifestation, greatly benefiting future breakthroughs.</p><p>He was still at the stage of knowing what it was but not why it was, but with continued progress, he would surely gain insight.</p><p>After the breakthrough, Qin Sang stabilized his blood energy and shifted his focus to the *Chapter on Nurturing Swords through the Soul*, it was time to improve that realm.</p><p>He didn't need to rush his further cultivation.</p><p>Qin Sang had enough strength to delve deeper and could spare some energy to cultivate while searching for the path to ascension.</p><p>Five years later.</p><p>Qin Sang left his cave again and entered the depths of the altar.</p><p>This time, he easily lifted the stone and reached the other side.</p><p>Having been there several times before, he smoothly passed the next few illusions and reached the one that had stopped him before.</p><p>He tried several times and was repelled each time.</p><p>Qin Sang frowned; the methods he had devised seemed useless.</p><p>After a moment's thought, he prepared to try again.</p><p>Just as he was about to step into the illusion, he suddenly froze, his eyes filled with surprise.</p><p>Within his Purple Mansion, a sword sang!</p><p></p>
