Chapter 1849: First Encounter


“So it’s here.”
Qin Sang gazed at the boundless blue sea of light before him, lost in thought.
This sea of light was very familiar to him.  He had heard True Person Youhuang describe its wonders when he first entered the Governance Altar.
The sea of light was boundless and incredibly vast. Qin Sang had spent many years in the Governance Altar, experiencing countless illusions, yet he had never encountered one comparable to this blue sea of light.
Within his field of vision was a wondrous scene where golden and blue light met. The dazzling blue light lay below, the golden light above, resembling a tempestuous ocean beneath a golden sky.
It was clear to the naked eye that the golden light was gradually fading. This golden light originated from the Nascent Soul Formation, not the Vajra Bodhi Tree.
The blue light at the bottom of the sea of light was incredibly pure, without any impurities, nor any sign of golden flames or the tree's shadow.
Previously, when the tree's shadow had openly revealed itself, Qin Sang hadn't seen any obvious blue light surrounding it.
However, through deduction, Qin Sang had determined that the Vajra Bodhi Tree was hidden within the depths of this blue sea of light.
The tree's shadow had vanished, but the ripples remained.  As long as he acted quickly enough, there was still hope of finding the treasure.
True Person Youhuang's description flashed through Qin Sang's mind. Back then, she and several fellow Daoists had explored the Governance Altar. Upon approaching the blue sea of light, they sensed an inexplicable danger and stopped, retreating from the Governance Altar.
The blue sea of light wasn't particularly deep within the altar, yet its mysterious nature perhaps surpassed even some of the illusions in the deeper parts of the Governance Altar.
Qin Sang had also previously felt that the sea of light was unusual, harboring a faint sense of apprehension.
Furthermore, the blue sea of light wasn't on his intended path of exploration, and it was so vast that searching it thoroughly would consume too much time and energy.  Thus, he had only entered the sea of light once, lingering at the periphery for a while without delving deeper.  Both sides remained undisturbed.
He hadn't expected the sea of light to conceal an ancient tree.  He had entered a mountain of treasures without knowing it.
Regret was useless now. Qin Sang swept his gaze across the turbulent shore where the blue and golden light collided, creating a spectacle.
Finding no other figures on the surface, Qin Sang shifted his gaze towards the southern shore of the blue sea of light, the location of the jungle realm.
The coastline of the blue sea of light was long, and the distance from his current position to the jungle realm wasn't short.
However, he was very familiar with the terrain surrounding the jungle realm. Should anything unexpected occur, no matter where he emerged from the blue sea of light, he could quickly find the fastest route to reach it.
With this in mind, Qin Sang quietly approached the shore, silently disappearing into the sea of light.
As far as the eye could see, everything was a shimmering blue, with no tangible objects in sight.
The deeper he went, the richer the blue became, shifting from light blue to deep blue, and finally even gradually turning towards black.  However, it never reached complete darkness; a hint of deep blue always remained.
“Eh?”
Diving into the blue sea of light, a look of surprise flashed across Qin Sang's eyes.
He still remembered the sensation from his last entry.  While not obvious at the edge, after entering a certain distance, he had felt a strange force pulling him, constantly pushing him towards the depths.
This was a force Qin Sang had never encountered before.  He was unsure of its source and had tried various Daoist techniques and treasures, but none could block it. It seemed to be one with the blue light.
Although the force wasn't particularly strong, it gave Qin Sang a dangerous feeling. Coupled with True Person Youhuang's description of the sea of light's influence on the mind, it added to the eeriness.
Thus, after weighing his options, Qin Sang had decided to give up.
Yet now, Qin Sang had already delved a considerable distance and felt no such force.
“Could it be because the tremors caused by the Vajra Bodhi Tree haven't subsided yet?  Other illusions become more dangerous after being impacted by the golden light, but this place is the opposite. It seems safer…”
Qin Sang summoned the Heaven's Eye Butterfly.  Together, they activated the Heaven's Eye Divine Ability, their vision piercing through the deep sea of light.
In their eyes, the sea of light was violently vibrating. Amidst the surging light, there was a fragmented beauty.
Qin Sang pondered for a moment, then increased his speed.
The sea of light's own fluctuations could conceal some of his aura. With the Heaven's Eye Butterfly as an early warning system, he hadn't even seen a shadow of an enemy, so there was no need for perfect concealment.
His goal was clear: to rush towards the center of the sea of light, the source of the tremors, which was undoubtedly related to the Vajra Bodhi Tree.
In fact, Qin Sang wasn't the only one with this idea.  For instance, Ling Youwang and his entourage had entered the sea of light earlier than him.
The entire sea of light was filled with a monotonous blue light, both tedious and lonely.
As Qin Sang ventured deeper, he gradually lost his relaxed expression. He began to feel the impact from the tremors, deducing that withstanding the tremors at their source would likely be difficult.
A thought flashed through Qin Sang's mind.  He formed a hand seal, utilizing the *Postnatal Wooden Figure Stele*, transforming into a Spiritwood Body.
The Spiritwood Body possessed a keen sensitivity to Wood Spirit Qi. Although the Vajra Bodhi Tree's life force was extinguished, perhaps its Wood Spirit Qi had never leaked out. If even a trace leaked out now and was sensed by him, he could pinpoint the Spirit Tree's location.
After employing the secret technique, his size remained unchanged, only his appearance became more bizarre.
While flying, Qin Sang's expression flickered. He abruptly stopped and turned his head towards the front-right.
In his eyes, it was just the same monotonous blue light, but the Heaven's Eye Butterfly could see further, spotting something there, like a bubble drifting past.
Without hesitation, Qin Sang immediately changed direction. But when he rushed over and searched the surroundings, he found nothing.  The bubble had vanished into thin air.
He furrowed his brow in thought.  It definitely hadn't been an illusion. There had been a bubble, the size of a baby's fist, drifting from the source of the tremors.
In that fleeting glimpse, Qin Sang remembered the scene within the bubble being somewhat blurry, shrouded in a layer of mist.  There seemed to be the illusory image of a man-made structure, and the interior appeared to seal an independent space.
“The depths truly are wondrous…”
Unable to decipher the bubble’s origin for the moment, Qin Sang didn’t dwell on it and continued forward.
…
‘Boom!’
Impacts like tidal waves assaulted him wave after wave.
The force of these impacts was extremely powerful, but Qin Sang, having transformed into the Spiritwood Body, was able to hold his ground.
Now, he wasn't far from the source of the tremors. No matter how dangerous it was ahead, he couldn't retreat.
‘Whoosh!’
A blue wave of light surged towards him with overwhelming force. Qin Sang's gaze darkened.  He tapped his foot in the void, his figure leaping slightly.
The wave of light arrived just as he reached the crest of the wave. The Mingshan Armor appeared on his body, shimmering with precious light.
Although he had avoided the brunt of the wave, the powerful impact still slammed into him.
Now, with the power of the True Treasure fragment integrated into the entire Mingshan Armor, it could fully protect Qin Sang, leaving him unharmed amidst the impact.
Qin Sang's speed didn't decrease, but instead increased.  He pressed his toes firmly against the crest of the wave, leaping forward several hundred zhang.
He resembled someone riding the tide, constantly advancing by stepping on the waves.
Unfortunately, the good times didn't last. As Qin Sang drew closer, he suddenly heard rumbling thunder-like sounds coming from ahead.
Qin Sang listened attentively for a moment, a sudden sense of foreboding washing over him. His expression drastically changed, and he unhesitatingly employed the Great Vajra Wheel Seal.
Pure Lapis Lazuli light shimmered in the deep sea.
In an instant, violent tremors assailed him, accompanied by rolling thunder, as if heaven and earth were turning upside down.  Qin Sang groaned, feeling as if his chest had been struck by a heavy hammer, and was sent flying.
His Qi and blood churned within him. Qin Sang was like a kite in a storm, tossed and turned. Before he could steady himself, he was struck by another force even stronger than the last, causing the Mingshan Armor to creak.
At this moment, the blue sea of light descended into complete chaos.
Centering around the source Qin Sang had previously sensed, the entire sea of light vibrated outwards.  The blue light seemed to shatter, and the impacting forces collided with each other, creating even greater chaos.
This chaos occurred at intervals, its cause unknown.
Having just entered, Qin Sang was completely unaware of this. Thoughts raced through his mind, and he quickly decided not to directly confront these forces.
He closed his eyes tightly, protecting himself, relying on his spiritual sense and the Heaven's Eye Divine Ability to search for patterns within the chaos.
No matter how chaotic it was, he only needed to remember the location of the source, actively allowing himself to be drawn into the opposing forces, using them to approach the source.  Initially, his speed wasn't slow.
However, the closer he got to the source, the fiercer the impact became.  Qin Sang felt the strain, yet he refused to be swept along, seizing every opportunity to move forward.
‘Bang! Bang! Bang!’
The Mingshan Armor had endured countless impacts for him, its spiritual light flickering, like a lamp flame on the verge of being extinguished.
Finally, this wave of tremors neared its end, the impact weakening.
Sensing the change, Qin Sang was just about to breathe a sigh of relief when he suddenly felt something and abruptly turned his head to the right.
The next moment, two burning gazes from the right, like sharp swords, pierced towards him.
Their eyes met.
Qin Sang's eyes felt a faint stinging pain.
With the chaos still unsettled, he couldn't conceal himself.  The moment he discovered the other party, he had also been exposed.
“Daoist or demon?”
This thought flashed through Qin Sang’s mind as the Heaven’s Eye Butterfly relayed an image.
In the distance was a long-bearded elder with kind eyes and a benevolent countenance, yet his body exuded an unconcealed, monstrous demonic aura.
“A Demon Marquis! And a late-stage Nascent Soul cultivator!”
Qin Sang’s expression turned serious.  Then, he heard a booming roar, rolling like thunder.
“Who’s there!”
The long-bearded elder was Dingxiang Hou, a Demon Marquis following Ling Youwang. He was Ling Youwang's most trusted subordinate.
His title had been bestowed by Ling Youwang himself, reflecting the deep trust placed in him.
When Ling Youwang was in seclusion, all matters within the Royal Mansion could be decided by Dingxiang Hou.
The surrounding impacting forces had weakened considerably compared to their peak.  Along with his shout, Dingxiang Hou’s long beard split in two, shooting outwards.
The front part was his beard, while the back transformed into two streams of white Qi.
The white Qi resembled two white flood dragons scouting the path, parting the waves at lightning speed.
Dingxiang Hou stared intently at Qin Sang, charging towards him without hesitation, his robes fluttering in the currents.
The demons followed Ling Youwang into the blue sea of light, but when the chaos erupted, it was difficult to maintain their formation, forcing them to scatter.
However, even scattered, they wouldn't separate too far. Once the chaos subsided, they could quickly regroup.
There was another reason for their dispersal.  Ling Youwang believed the chaos was peculiar, concealing a profound mystery, and ordered his demons to investigate separately to confirm his judgment.
Sensing Qin Sang’s aura, Dingxiang Hou immediately discerned that the newcomer wasn't one of them.
Before entering the Governance Altar, all the Demon Marquises had gathered, memorizing each other's auras to avoid misunderstandings.
This person could only be from the Daoist sects!
Since he was an enemy, Dingxiang Hou naturally wouldn’t show mercy. If he could capture him and learn about his companions, their side could gain the upper hand.
Of course, Dingxiang Hou also considered the possibility that the other party might be a Grand True Person who had severed their cultivation.  In the worst case, he could at least stall for time until Ling Youwang, who was nearby, arrived.
Therefore, Dingxiang Hou attacked without hesitation.
“The Divine Tree stirs hearts, as expected, someone has come seeking it.  With demons present, I wonder if there are any Dao Court experts nearby,” Qin Sang sighed inwardly. He hadn't expected to be exposed so quickly. He could no longer wait for an opportunity and had to confront the situation head-on.
‘Whoosh! Whoosh!’
The two streams of white Qi arrived with astonishing momentum.
Qin Sang turned sideways, facing Dingxiang Hou directly.
“So it’s him…”
Dingxiang Hou was quite famous in the Ghostfang Kingdom and wasn't difficult to recognize. However, this demon held a high position and rarely engaged in combat, so outsiders knew little about his divine abilities.
There were even several theories about his true form.
Qin Sang stared at Dingxiang Hou, ignoring the two streams of white Qi. Only when they drew close did he raise his right arm, his hand transforming into a palm, striking out with a powerful blow.
‘Boom!’
Under the blinding golden light, the two streams of white Qi froze, exploding upon impact.
The rapidly approaching Dingxiang Hou's pupils constricted, his expression growing more serious, his eyes filled with confusion and astonishment.
“What kind of monster is this? Is it human or demon?”
With the power of the True Treasure fragment integrated, the Mingshan Armor shone like flowing water, allowing Dingxiang Hou to vaguely see the figure within.
Upon seeing clearly, Dingxiang Hou's expression became even more peculiar. His demonic form was already quite unique, but he hadn't expected to encounter someone with an even more bizarre appearance.
Qin Sang’s aura was even stranger, with pure demonic Qi mixed with poisonous Qi, completely lacking the air of a True Person.
For a moment, Dingxiang Hou began to doubt his own judgment.
“Could it be a demonic servant of some Grand True Person?”
A True Person shouldn’t be able to cultivate a demonic servant of this level.
Dingxiang Hou felt this was the only possibility, secretly becoming apprehensive as he discreetly scanned the surroundings.
With a demonic servant here, the Grand True Person shouldn’t be far.
However, Dingxiang Hou showed no intention of retreating. Seeing the white Qi dispelled, he snorted lightly, and an elephant trunk materialized from his nose. With a flick of the trunk, he spewed out two more streams of white Qi.
These two streams of white Qi were far more powerful than before.  They intertwined, resembling a dragon spear, rumbling through the void as they pierced fiercely towards Qin Sang.
Qin Sang took a deep look at Dingxiang Hou. He had been retreating since earlier and now continued to retreat further.
The white dragon spear was as fast as lightning, leaving trails of spear images as it arrived in an instant.  If it were anyone else, an unfavorable response would result in being impaled on the spot.
Qin Sang calmly raised his hand to meet the attack, blood light flickering in his palm as a Palm Heart Sword materialized.
‘Bang!’
The dragon spear and blood sword clashed head-on, a burst of crimson and white light erupting.
Qin Sang's entire body trembled. Then, he transformed into a bolt of lightning, using the force of the dragon spear to continue retreating, showing no intention of engaging Dingxiang Hou.
Based on the cultivators and demon cultivators he had encountered before, they mostly traveled in groups. Encountering one meant there were likely more demon cultivators nearby, possibly even a hidden expert from the Great Saint Mansion.
Even if Qin Sang had the ability to kill Dingxiang Hou, he wouldn’t entangle himself here.
His judgment proved correct. As he departed, he could faintly sense a powerful aura approaching, even stronger than Dingxiang Hou’s.
Unexpected by the other party's decisiveness, Dingxiang Hou's expression shifted slightly.  His figure flickered, transforming directly into a stream of white Qi as he gave chase. However, he discovered that his escape technique was no match for the other party’s, and after pursuing for a while, he was left behind.
