<h1>Chapter 572: The Immortal Tomb</h1><p>This provided an additional escape route.</p><p>The competition for the Crimson Cloud Purple Fruit was directly related to their immortal path; there was originally no room for retreat.  The opponent was a powerful demon at the Yaodan stage, possibly even beyond the early Yaodan stage. Qin Sang had prepared himself for a desperate battle, and would not retreat unless forced to reveal all his trump cards and driven to a dead end!</p><p>With the Yuan Ying reward as a safety net, they could retreat at any time if the situation became untenable.</p><p>A huge weight lifted from Qin Sang's heart, and he felt significantly relieved.</p><p>While Qin Sang was lost in thought, Dongyang Bo and Chen Yan were secretly communicating.</p><p>"Dongyun Xian didn't recognize your true identity.  Before your master disappeared, I had no contact with him. Unless someone familiar with you or your master is involved, they shouldn't connect you so quickly to a little girl in the Qi Condensation stage over two hundred years ago. After all, achieving Yuan Ying cultivation in just two hundred years is simply too astonishing."</p><p>Chen Yan said, "Master traveled far and wide to Xiaohan Region for the Ziwei Palace.  The original plan was to return to the sect after investigating the Ziwei Palace and to avoid excessive entanglement with the local forces, so Master didn't introduce me to many people.  Most of them have only seen me once."</p><p>Dongyang Bo 'hmm'ed, "That's good. As long as your identity isn't exposed before the treasure hunt in the Tianshan Mountains, we have a considerable chance of success. However, I have something I don't know whether I should say… Before your master, there were others trapped in the Tianshan Mountains, and without exception, they all completely disappeared. There must be unknown dangers deep within the Tianshan Mountains. Although your master’s cultivation was extraordinary, being trapped there for two hundred years… I'm afraid…"</p><p>"My master is a late-stage grand cultivator; she will certainly be alright!"</p><p>Chen Yan's tone suddenly became very agitated.</p><p>Dongyang Bo repeatedly reassured Chen Yan.</p><p>"I'm not saying your master has no chance of escaping, but you need to be prepared.</p><p>"I haven't asked about your sect before, you were still young when you came to Xiaohan Region.  You've lived less than three hundred years, with over two hundred of them spent on Mount Shao Hua. That's quite a connection.</p><p>"What are your plans if we fail to rescue your master? Do you plan to stay on Mount Shao Hua or return to your sect?"</p><p>Before Chen Yan could answer, Dongyang Bo added, "You are already a Yuan Ying cultivator, and so young, you might even have a chance to reach the late Yuan Ying stage or even the legendary Nascent Divinity stage. You won't be neglected wherever you go.</p><p>"If you are willing to stay on Mount Shao Hua, I would welcome you with open arms and hand over the leadership of Mount Shao Hua to you. There's no promising talent among the younger generation of Mount Shao Hua; you would become the ancestral master of Mount Shao Hua.</p><p>"If this trip yields no results, with my less than 10% chance of survival until the next tribulation, I might not live to see the next opening of the Ziwei Palace.</p><p>"Don't think that the impending chaos is only a crisis; opportunities exist within it too.</p><p>"However, I'm worried that someone from your sect might be searching for you.</p><p>"Judging from your master's bearing, the strength of your sect likely far surpasses our imagination. When they come looking for you, I won't be able to stop them."</p><p>After a moment of silence, Chen Yan calmly said, "Don't worry, although my master and I don't have many close relationships within the sect, we have no mortal enemies, and it certainly won't implicate Mount Shao Hua. They would be delighted if my master and I disappeared, why would they search for me? It’s hard for me to decide now. I definitely need to return to the sect, but not right now."</p><p>…</p><p>The exit of the stone hall was a sheer cliff.</p><p>The entire mountain seemed to have been cut from top to bottom by a sharp blade, smooth as a mirror.</p><p>Ahead, the air both above and below was filled with grayish-white mist, limiting visibility to a few meters.  Deep within the mist, some black auras flickered faintly.</p><p>Qin Sang was very familiar with these auras – they were Yin煞 (yin) energy.</p><p>In places tainted by the Yin煞 (yin) energy, the mist took on a grayish-black hue, but it was all chaotic; nothing was discernible.</p><p>These grayish-white mists were not solely composed of Yin煞 (yin) energy.  A howling Yin wind swept through the mist, like the cries of ghosts, and ghostly figures seemed to lurk within the depths of the mist, making it very eerie.</p><p>"Those ghostly figures… are they trapped ghosts?"</p><p>Qin Sang was on high alert.</p><p>Ghosts were unpredictable and difficult to deal with.</p><p>He had encountered many ghosts in the Wuyagu Valley.</p><p>However, those ghosts were born from blood energy, more akin to demonic spirits, and quite different from true ghosts.  The Ziwei Palace was called an immortal palace, yet it contained such an area shrouded in ghostly mist.  The ghosts here must be terrifying.</p><p>Qin Sang noticed that Dongyang Bo, who had seemed very relaxed, now had a more serious expression.  He held a sword in one hand and summoned a Vajra pestle-shaped artifact with the other.</p><p>The connection between this artifact and Dongyang Bo was clearly more profound, indicating that the Vajra pestle was his main artifact, not the sword.</p><p>"Go!"</p><p>Dongyang Bo gestured, and the Vajra pestle flew above the five of them, radiating a brilliant light and protecting them beneath it.</p><p>Next, Dongyang Bo pointed to the chains on the cliff face, saying:  "Going down these chains leads to an area called Xianfen, a place shrouded in ghostly mist, teeming with countless malevolent spirits and resentful souls. It was always extremely dangerous, but after absorbing many cultivators who intruded into Ziwei Palace, it's become even more perilous. Some of these ghosts are incredibly powerful, even Yuan Ying cultivators are no match for them. You must not underestimate them. These spirits are adept at manipulating minds;  hold firm to your resolve and follow my magic treasure's guidance. If necessary, seal your five senses."</p><p>"We obey!"</p><p>...</p><p>Dozens of iron chains descended from the cliff face into the ghostly mist, disappearing into the depths.</p><p>Each chain was as thick as a thigh, and the chilling wind caused them to clang against the cliff face with a resounding *bang bang*.</p><p>Gripping the icy chains and descending, despite the protection of the King Kong Zhuo, a terrifying chill still seeped into my very being. No wonder they say the outer hall of Ziwei Palace is fraught with danger; a Foundation Establishment cultivator would surely meet their demise here.</p><p>Without Dongyang Bo and Chen Yan, Qin Sang wouldn't have even passed the first obstacle, the corpse vultures.</p><p>Considering this, Qin Sang grew even more worried about Yunyouzi.</p><p>He had to navigate the trials alone to reach the inner hall.  I hope his preparations are sufficient.</p><p>Using all my spiritual power to dispel the cold, I finally reached solid ground, yet still almost froze solid.</p><p>Qin Sang took out a warming pill and swallowed it, then turned towards the depths of the ghostly mist.</p><p>Before me lay a flat expanse, barren and lifeless. The soil was a dark brown hue, making one wonder if it had been soaked in blood.</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze sharpened. He saw a tomb!</p><p>The tomb was extremely low, resembling a small mound of earth. Before the tomb stood a broken stele, its inscription scratched and marred by countless claw marks, rendering it completely illegible.</p><p>One stele, one tomb, standing alone in this ghostly realm, for countless millennia, perhaps.</p><p>No, there's more than just this single grave!</p><p>Qin Sang cautiously took a step, his field of vision expanding slightly, revealing three more tombs neatly arranged behind the first.</p><p>And beyond those, more!</p>
