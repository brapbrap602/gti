<h1>Chapter 1942: The Drunken Fragrance Banquet</h1><p>“I am Qingfeng,”</p><p>Qin Sang bowed, observing the storyteller.  He had sensed an unusual fluctuation the moment the girl entered the teahouse and was captivated by the storyteller's tales, revealing the storyteller to be no ordinary person.</p><p>The storyteller had already been performing in the teahouse prior to this.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn’t constantly keep his spiritual awareness focused on the county, a hundred miles away, but the fact that the storyteller’s cultivation could elude his senses was noteworthy.</p><p>Initially, Qin Sang thought the storyteller and the girl shared some connection, but he later realized it was wrong.</p><p>The storyteller likely deliberately revealed himself, targeting him.  The other party had known him all along, while he only discovered the storyteller's presence when the storyteller acted; the difference in their abilities was clear.</p><p>Qin Sang guessed that the storyteller had sensed the explosion at the main altar and was drawn by the thunder and the energy fluctuations.</p><p>He thought that regardless of whether the storyteller was a master from Yun Du or Luohun Abyss, this encounter would likely end badly.</p><p>However, the storyteller's attitude was intriguing.</p><p>The storyteller appeared voluntarily, stirring up trouble in Jien County, drawing the girl and Jien County's spirits into the story, clearly showing himself, but not directly approaching.</p><p>In a way, it seemed like a gesture of goodwill?</p><p>As the storyteller had said, Qin Sang couldn’t move the main altar, nor could he allow the storyteller to gather all the spirits, drawing the world's attention here.</p><p>After much thought, Qin Sang decided to send his physical body to visit personally, to see what this person actually wanted.</p><p>“Daoist Qingfeng,” the storyteller, Qingyuan, sipped his tea, “must be an alias, right?”</p><p>His words seemed pointed.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes flashed, and he said calmly, “Same to you.”</p><p>Qingyuan laughed. “I am just a storyteller; a real name or an alias matters little to me.”</p><p>A storyteller?</p><p>Qin Sang looked towards the teahouse behind Qingyuan.</p><p>Inside the teahouse, the girl and the spirits had all emerged from the story, but some spirits were still confused, unsure of what had happened.</p><p>Yu Cheng Huang, the two judge Yama, and the girl, the first to regain consciousness, all had different expressions.</p><p>The girl was resentful.</p><p>Yu Cheng Huang and the two judge Yama looked grave.</p><p>Without exception, they all felt wary of the storyteller.</p><p>The storyteller stood with his back to them, yet he seemed like a mountain, none dared to leave the teahouse.</p><p>The teahouse was deathly silent, the atmosphere eerie.</p><p>“Like the Daoist, I enjoy the sights and tastes of the human world. The owner of the Drunk Fragrance Tower truly has skill, the Drunken Fragrance Banquet is unparalleled.  Might I have the honor of your presence, Daoist?”</p><p>Qingyuan tapped his folding fan towards the City God Temple.</p><p>Not far from the City God Temple, there was a three-story wooden building, every detail exquisitely crafted, yet not ostentatious, possessing an understated elegance, unique and charming.</p><p>Even in the capital of Yan, the Drunk Fragrance Tower would be remarkable; in little Jien County, it stood out.</p><p>Qin Sang had only heard Yu Cheng Huang and Yi Pan Guan mention the Drunken Fragrance Banquet yesterday,  “I hear the owner of the Drunk Fragrance Tower is a man of character; not everyone gets to experience this feast?”</p><p>The voice carried into the teahouse.</p><p>Yu Cheng Huang and Yi Pan Guan had strange expressions.  *You two are ordinary people? You could level the Drunk Fragrance Tower with a breath.*</p><p>“I'm not boasting, though I've only known the owner briefly, we hit it off immediately. I'm sure I can arrange the Drunken Fragrance Banquet for the Daoist today,” Qingyuan said proudly, gesturing with a raised hand and inviting him.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded slightly and walked alongside Qingyuan.</p><p>Yu Lang sensed something amiss and silently followed behind.</p><p>…</p><p>“My lord, what should we do?”</p><p>Wu Pan Guan asked softly.</p><p>Yu Cheng Huang pondered for a moment and said, “Wait!”</p><p>With that, Yu Cheng Huang sat back down. The other spirits looked at each other and also sat down.</p><p>The girl was secretly gritting her teeth, not daring to act rashly. Seeing Qin Sang and Qingyuan enter the Drunk Fragrance Tower, she stomped her foot, rushed out of the teahouse, and disappeared.</p><p>…</p><p>Compared to the outside, the interior of the Drunk Fragrance Tower was more refined, a faint sandalwood fragrance filling the air.</p><p>There weren't many diners in the hall.</p><p>The waiter and Qingyuan were familiar, speaking casually, “Sir, you're off work so early today? Please go to the third floor, I'll go and invite the owner.”</p><p>“Tell the owner I have a distinguished guest, and we’ll have the complete Drunken Fragrance Banquet today,” Qingyuan instructed.</p><p>“Ah?”</p><p>The waiter looked at Qin Sang in surprise. “Yes! I understand…”</p><p>“Yu Lang!”</p><p>Suddenly a loud shout echoed, jarringly out of place in the serene Drunk Fragrance Tower, causing the diners to frown.</p><p>Everyone looked in the direction of the sound, seeing a half-grown boy, shaking their heads helplessly.</p><p>“Making a ruckus?”</p><p>Yu Lang frowned.</p><p>He hadn’t gotten the nickname wrong; it was Tao Teng, the one he'd parted with yesterday.</p><p>“You’re here to eat at the Drunk Fragrance Tower too?”</p><p>Tao Teng had just come out of a private room and upon seeing his friend, his face lit up with surprise; he rushed over.</p><p>Yu Lang was too late to stop him.</p><p>He knew Tao Teng came from a well-off family, but he hadn't expected to run into him at the Drunk Fragrance Tower.  Seeing a friend was certainly joyful, but the timing couldn't have been worse!</p><p>Yu Lang opened his mouth to speak, but then saw Tao Teng's face fall, his joy replaced by worry. He sighed deeply.</p><p>"Alas, today might be our last meeting!"</p><p>"What's wrong?"</p><p>Yu Lang asked with concern.</p><p>"My father received a letter last night. My uncle has prospered in the capital, established a large business, and needs people to manage it. My father is preparing to move the whole family to the capital, leaving this afternoon. Thankfully I met you here; otherwise, I'd only be able to leave a letter for you and Master, without even a proper goodbye," Tao Teng sniffed, his voice growing lower.</p><p>For ordinary people, Yan Kingdom was vast enough.</p><p>This parting might well be their last.</p><p>"So sudden?"</p><p>Hearing this, Yu Lang felt a little downcast. He truly considered Tao Teng a close friend.</p><p>"Yes! My uncle is pressing for it, not even waiting for the New Year! It's a pity you won't be going to the capital for the imperial examinations; otherwise, we'd meet again soon, and I'd treat you well," Tao Teng knew his friend's aspirations – dedicated to cultivation, unconcerned with fame and fortune.</p><p>"I'll be traveling with my Master later, and we might go to the capital. I'll definitely visit your family then," Yu Lang said.</p><p>"It's a deal! My father and the others still need a while to finish their meal. Let's have a good chat."</p><p>Tao Teng's worry turned to joy.</p><p>As they talked, they unknowingly went up to the third floor and entered the best private room.</p><p>Seeing his Master and the storyteller enter, Yu Lang remembered that bringing Tao Teng here was inappropriate.  He hesitated, then heard his Master's voice.</p><p>"Come in."</p><p>"Yes!"</p><p>Yu Lang was immediately reassured, pulling Tao Teng to sit by the door.</p><p>Qin Sang was seated in the main position.</p><p>Though seemingly casual, he remained alert facing this mysterious Qingyuan, carefully considering every word.</p><p>Just as he was about to speak, Qin Sang’s expression shifted slightly as he looked out the window, a playful smile playing on his lips.  "Trouble's coming."</p><p>The city of Jian was uneven; the City God Temple area was higher, and from the third floor, one could see the mountains outside the city.</p><p>At that moment, a streak of green light shot across the sky, heading straight for Jian.</p><p>Qingyuan said, "I didn't harm the girl at all. She barged into the teahouse herself. Daoist Master, you can testify to that, can't you?"</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head repeatedly. "I've been here less than half a year, dealing with ordinary people all day. I don't even recognize a cultivator, so no one will believe me. I'm helpless."</p><p>He leaned back slightly, watching the door to the private room, putting on a show of watching the events unfold, and cast a spell to isolate Yu Lang and Tao Teng.</p><p>The two youngsters were huddled together, whispering, completely unaware of what was happening.</p><p>After a while, a knock came on the door.</p><p>Qingyuan cleared his throat. "Come in."</p><p>'Creak!'</p><p>A dry, thin hand pushed open the wooden door.</p><p>The visitor was a gaunt old man in black robes, his face as thin as his hand, highlighting his bright eyes.</p><p>Glancing at Qin Sang and Qingyuan, the old man clasped his hands, his voice booming. "I am Lin Baoshan, a retainer of the Yin family of Yinping Mountain. Greetings to both Daoist friends."</p><p>Qin Sang decided not to get involved.</p><p>Qingyuan exclaimed in surprise, "With Daoist Friend's cultivation, to serve as a retainer… the Yin family must be a prominent clan indeed."</p><p>Lin Baoshan was at the late Gold Core stage. Although he was quite old, his chance of breaking through to Nascent Soul was slim. He was still a formidable expert within the various kingdoms.</p><p>"You don't know the Yin family? My cultivation is all thanks to the family head.  I am deeply indebted to them, and I can never repay their kindness."</p><p>Lin Baoshan's brow furrowed imperceptibly. He bowed again. "My young lady is impetuous and went down the mountain to play. If she inadvertently offended Daoist friend, I apologize on her behalf."</p><p>"Daoist Friend is exaggerating. Your young lady didn't offend me. I merely played a little joke on her," Qingyuan said, shaking his head repeatedly.</p><p>Lin Baoshan nodded and said gravely, "I see.  Please then, Daoist friend, release the mental restraint on my young lady!"</p><p>"Restraint?"</p><p>Qingyuan was startled, then burst into laughter. "Don't worry, it's beneficial to her. In three days, she'll feel it."</p><p>The girl was absorbed in Qingyuan’s story, experiencing another life firsthand. Though she had awakened, the story's influence remained, causing increasing discomfort.</p><p>Having one's mind controlled would undoubtedly hinder cultivation; they couldn't afford to be careless.</p><p>Lin Baoshan clearly didn't believe Qingyuan's explanation. He said solemnly, "In that case, I dare to invite Daoist friend to Yinping Mountain as a guest. We will see the results in three days."</p><p>"And if I refuse? Will you attack me?" Qingyuan asked.</p><p>Lin Baoshan stepped over the threshold, his tone hardening.  "It's an invitation!"</p><p>"You can't beat me, so don't invite trouble," Qingyuan said persuasively, feigning concern for the other man.</p><p>Most people would have been angered by Qingyuan's words.</p><p>Lin Baoshan remained unperturbed, showing no sign of retreat.  His thin frame shuddered, then erupted with the ferocious aura of a tiger.</p><p>"As a retainer, I failed to protect the young miss. My life is forfeit.  If I fall to you, Daoist friend, it will be a worthy death!"</p><p>Lin Baoshan's voice boomed, his aura steadily escalating to its peak as he finished speaking.  The pressure, immense as a towering mountain, bore down on Qingyuan.</p><p>He'd heard the young miss describe her experience at the teahouse, and knew the storyteller was no ordinary person.  However, the young miss had been manipulated for nearly two days, a restriction placed upon her spirit.  This would bring disgrace upon the Yin family, something utterly unacceptable.</p><p>Lin Baoshan had already contacted the Yin family and dispatched men to escort the young miss back to the mountain.  He'd come alone, prepared to stake his life to test Qingyuan's abilities.  This would allow the Yin family to respond effectively.</p><p>If Qingyuan was indeed a top-tier expert, the Yin family would only lose a retainer; not an irreconcilable feud.  It would prevent attracting a powerful enemy, saving the family from devastating losses, or even annihilation.</p><p>Both Qin Sang and Qingyuan saw through Lin Baoshan's intentions.</p><p>Qin Sang sat up straighter.</p><p>Qingyuan said nothing more, but solemnly stated, "Go ahead, Daoist Lin."</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>A sudden gust of wind swept through the private room.</p><p>Lin Baoshan raised his hands, his palms glowing green. His skin turned woody, rough as bark.  Within the intense green light, his arms and fingers, once dry and withered like branches, rapidly revived.  Above his palms, streaks of green light, like entangled pythons, formed strange apparitions, instantly transforming into a wooden stake.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The stake vibrated, seemingly shaking the very air, yet surprisingly, it faded and vanished.  Simultaneously, above Qingyuan's head, a rune appeared, seemingly woven from vines.  Without warning, the stake reappeared, summoned by the rune.</p><p>This move was truly unexpected.</p><p>The next moment, Lin Baoshan froze.  The stake, materialized above Qingyuan's head, should have struck him, but instead, it fell lightly as a leaf into Qingyuan's hand. Lin Baoshan had completely lost control.</p><p>"Excellent skill.  Did you create this yourself?  For your cultivation level, achieving this is remarkable," Qingyuan said, holding the stake and turning it over in his hand, his face expressing approval.  "In your vision, this skill, when perfected, should manifest a true spirit tree, right? Like this?"</p><p>The stake suddenly sprouted branches and roots, instantly reaching the room's ceiling.  Everyone was enveloped in shadow, leaving Lin Baoshan speechless.</p><p>Qin Sang stared intently at Qingyuan's hand, deeply shaken.</p><p>Qin Sang could have neutralized Lin Baoshan's attack in countless ways, yet even her true self could not have done it like this.  Qingyuan didn't merely restrain the stake or sever Lin Baoshan's control; he directly appropriated it.</p><p>The skill's essence, its spiritual energy, everything became Qingyuan's, completely severed from Lin Baoshan.  It seemed as if Qingyuan had cast it himself, yet there was no fluctuation of spiritual energy from him throughout.  Moreover, the stake remained unchanged throughout the process. Before Qingyuan stimulated its life force, there was no sign of any change in the stake.</p><p>Qin Sang's true self could disperse the stake, restrain it with great power, preserve its form, or even imitate the skill.  But she absolutely could not have, upon first witnessing it, so effortlessly claimed it as her own.</p><p>'Snap!'</p><p>Qingyuan flicked his finger, dispersing the sapling, and smiled at Lin Baoshan.</p><p>"Thank you for your mercy, senior. I'll take my leave."</p><p>Lin Baoshan couldn't fathom the mystery, but he knew Qingyuan was incredibly powerful, unimaginably so.  He bowed deeply and respectfully withdrew. He wasn't afraid of death, but the gap in strength was too vast; a fight to the death would be meaningless.</p><p>Lin Baoshan arrived and left quickly.  As soon as he'd gone, another knock came. This time, it was the owner of the Drunk Fragrance House, an energetic old man with silver hair.</p><p>"We have three Drunk Fragrance Feasts: the Seven-Headed Feast, the Eight-Jewels Feast, and the Nine-Treasures Feast.  The main ingredients have just arrived from the prefecture city.  Which would the gentleman prefer?"  The owner presented some wooden plaques listing the dishes.</p><p>Qingyuan gestured, "The Daoist is the honored guest."</p><p>Qin Sang picked up a plaque. The names were elegant, but she couldn't tell what they were.  After thinking for a moment, she asked a question that surprised both Qingyuan and the owner.  "Which one has buns?" (End)</p>
