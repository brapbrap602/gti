<h1>    everything clearly.</p><p>Most importantly, he could restore the Nine Dragons Chariot Talisman, adding another layer</h1><p>    of protection.</p><p>As they spoke, the Spirit Bamboo flying boat continued to travel underground. Suddenly, Yun</p><p>    Youzi's eyes lit up, and he pointed ahead.</p><p>"Brother Qin, look over there!"</p><p>Qin Sang followed his gaze</p><p>    and noticed a tiny crack in the circular barrier in the direction Yun Youzi indicated, extending into a tributary</p><p>    ahead.</p><p>They were still far from the stone tablet, but the circular barrier clearly had more weak points than</p><p>    just the trial space. They had luckily stumbled upon one.</p><p>Since the upheaval began, the underground tremors</p><p>    had intensified, and the impact on the circular barrier had increased. It was only natural that cracks would appear</p><p>    first in its weaker areas.</p><p>They might not be able to find the trial space, but now that they had encountered a</p><p>    weak point, they naturally couldn't miss this opportunity. Without needing a reminder, Qin Sang understood Yun</p><p>    Youzi's meaning and immediately changed the Spirit Bamboo flying boat's direction, charging along the crack into the</p><p>    magma tributary.</p><p>His gaze locked onto the crack, finally tracing it to its end.</p><p>At the end of the</p><p>    hairline fracture, a thumb-sized gap appeared. The light of the circular barrier was dazzling here, and the</p><p>    barrier's power was trying to repair itself. However, the constant tremors made the barrier unstable, not only</p><p>    preventing its recovery but also causing the gap to grow larger.</p><p>Above the gap, the ground had also cracked</p><p>    open from the tremors.</p><p>Qin Sang and Yun Youzi exchanged glances and said in unison,</p><p>"We can try!"</p><p></p><p>    The fire spirits were in hot pursuit, leaving them no time to wait for the gap to collapse on its own. As they</p><p>    approached, they both took action.</p><p>The Ebony Sword flashed from Qin Sang's forehead, forming a sword array.</p><p>    Then, the power of the sword array instantly converged into the blade.</p><p>Yun Youzi summoned a jade-green orb,</p><p>    the size of a dragon's eye, crystal clear. Inside, wind and thunder flickered, yin and yang interchanged, as if a</p><p>    miniature world was evolving within.</p><p>The moment the orb appeared, Qin Sang felt a faint pressure, secretly</p><p>    startled.</p><p>Qin Sang had only felt this kind of pressure from treasures like the Heavenly Sound Conch and the</p><p>    Heavenly Dipper Blade Talisman. This orb was similar, although the pressure was much weaker, far from comparable to</p><p>    a true magical treasure.</p><p>But this was enough to demonstrate the orb's extraordinary nature. It was definitely</p><p>    a top-tier magical artifact, seemingly on par with the Ten Yama Banners.</p><p>It seemed that Yun Youzi's years of</p><p>    wandering, while failing to cure his hidden injuries, had yielded considerable rewards.</p><p>Both the Spirit Bamboo</p><p>    flying boat and this orb were quite remarkable.</p><p>"Go!"</p><p>Yun Youzi shouted, and the orb, trailing a green</p><p>    light, slammed into the gap.</p><p>Qin Sang was not to be outdone, immediately urging the Ebony Sword forward. The</p><p>    sword and orb struck the circular barrier almost simultaneously. As Qin Sang expected, the orb's power was</p><p>    comparable to the Ten Yama Banners, even surpassing the Ebony Sword.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>Simultaneously struck by</p><p>    the orb and the Ebony Sword, the barrier's power at the gap wavered, momentarily stagnating.</p><p>Although brief,</p><p>    it was enough.</p><p>The Spirit Bamboo flying boat transformed into a streak of light, flashing through the gap in</p><p>    the blink of an eye. The pursuing fire spirits, having lost Qin Sang and Yun Youzi's aura, gradually calmed</p><p>    down.</p><p>The fissure was wide enough for them to pass through. They retrieved their artifacts and flew</p><p>    upwards.</p><p>"What a treasure!"</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at the orb, a glint of admiration in his eyes, and offered</p><p>    a compliment.</p><p>A pale look flashed across Yun Youzi's face as he smiled wryly, "This Flawless Pearl is indeed</p><p>    my greatest reliance, but its consumption is immense. It's like a monster that devours spiritual energy. Every use</p><p>    drains my spiritual sea. It's truly not as handy as Brother Qin's Ebony Sword."</p><p>...</p><p>Finally, they had</p><p>    escaped.</p><p>Qin Sang was startled by the scene before him as soon as he emerged.</p><p>They were southwest of the</p><p>    stone tablet, roughly equidistant from both the tablet and the Sky Peak. The prominent stone tablet was easily</p><p>    visible in the distance.</p><p>A pungent odor filled the air.</p><p>The west had completely transformed, bathed in</p><p>    crimson.</p><p>Cracks crisscrossed the earth, and magma gushed from the depths, erupting into the sky and spreading</p><p>    outwards.</p><p>The flame-like barrier had long been torn apart. Beneath it, countless peaks had collapsed,</p><p>    shattered along with the earth, and then engulfed by the endless magma, becoming isolated islands.</p><p>Numerous</p><p>    fire spirits could be seen rising and falling within the magma. The ancient cultivator's legacy seemed to be</p><p>    becoming the domain of the fire spirits.</p><p>Even more shockingly, the four celestial peaks began to tilt, two of</p><p>    them already colliding and partially collapsing.</p><p>Qin Sang recalled the initial tremor he felt and glanced at</p><p>    the peak from which Sikong Muyue descended, wondering if that was the source of the upheaval.</p><p>Not only that,</p><p>    but Qin Sang also noticed the space within the ancient cultivator's legacy seemed to be collapsing. Around the</p><p>    already crumbled peak, black lines were visible to the naked eye, stretching across the void. Some spanned hundreds</p><p>    of feet. Fire spirits and magma that touched these lines vanished without a trace.</p><p>They looked exactly like</p><p>    the legendary spatial rifts!</p><p>Qin Sang gasped. Even the battle between Elder Dique and Daoist Xuanyu hadn't</p><p>    shaken the totem restrictions in the slightest. He couldn't understand why this ancient cultivator's legacy, which</p><p>    had existed for so long, was suddenly on the verge of destruction.</p><p>Could it be that this place was already on</p><p>    the brink of collapse, and they were the final straw?</p><p>"Brother Qin, we should also hurry out to avoid being</p><p>    affected," Yun Youzi, appearing much calmer than Qin Sang, pointed to the distant ground and warned.</p><p>The</p><p>    cracks in the earth were spreading at a visible rate. Occasionally, the ground would bulge upwards before a whole</p><p>    section was flung into the air, immediately followed by magma and fire spirits erupting from below, submerging the</p><p>    land.</p><p>The struggling vegetation faced its true apocalypse.</p><p>Now, everyone was converging towards the exit</p><p>    marked by a stone tablet.</p><p>Several figures hovered near the tablet, having arrived earlier, observing the</p><p>    unfolding chaos.</p><p>From the west, streaks of escaping light sped towards the tablet. Some were faster than</p><p>    others, but fortunately, the number of fire spirits emerging from the ground wasn't overwhelming yet, so even those</p><p>    lagging behind didn't need to worry about being discovered.</p><p>Qin Sang hesitated for a moment. "Senior, please</p><p>    go ahead. I have a small matter to attend to."</p><p>"Be careful, Junior Brother Qin. The rate of the restrictions'</p><p>    collapse will certainly accelerate," Yun Youzi didn't pry, offering Qin Sang a word of caution before piloting his</p><p>    Spirit Bamboo flying boat towards the stone tablet.</p><p>Watching Yun Youzi's silhouette disappear, Qin Sang</p><p>    pondered briefly. Then, with a flash, he vanished, moving in the opposite direction, stealthily traveling west for</p><p>    some distance before concealing himself along the path those escaping to the tablet would inevitably take.</p><p></p><p>    Streaks of light flew overhead as the magma and fire spirits drew closer.</p><p>Qin Sang remained motionless.</p><p></p><p>    Even after the last streak of light passed, Ren Hong was nowhere to be seen.</p><p>Only then did Qin Sang move.</p></p>
