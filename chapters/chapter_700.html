<h1>Chapter 692: A Long Journey</h1><p>Chapter 692: A Long Journey</p><p>“Since you two fellow cultivators have only recently left, you must be well-prepared.  You haven't used much of your pills and other supplies, have you?  I happen to be completely out of supplies. I'd like to trade some monster corpses and monster cores for some of yours. What do you think?”</p><p>Qin Sang, keeping his promise, tossed a top-grade magic artifact to them, having a sudden idea to trade with them.</p><p>The senior brother was surprised. “Fellow cultivator, aren't you planning to return to Duoyan Island for safety?”</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head. “I came to the Demon Sea to hunt monsters and gather cultivation resources. I’m afraid that if I go back, I’ll be stuck on the island and unable to leave. I'm alone, unlike you two, who have so many disciples and can come and go as you please. I've decided to stay out here for a few more years and observe the situation. Exchanging pills for monster cores means you won't have made this trip for nothing.”</p><p>After a brief discussion, the two agreed to trade with Qin Sang. After some haggling, they threw over a pouch. Qin Sang also threw over several monster cores, while remaining wary of their greed.</p><p>After checking the contents of the pouch, Qin Sang bowed. “Farewell, fellow cultivators!”</p><p>“Farewell, fellow cultivator!”</p><p>The two returned the bow, their tone much softer than before.</p><p>“By the way,” Qin Sang, about to leave, suddenly remembered something and turned back. “It seems unstable around Duoyan Island. The patrolling cultivators have disappeared. You two should be careful.”</p><p>The senior brother was startled. “Thank you for the warning…”</p><p>…</p><p>Qin Sang summoned his escape light and vanished into the sky.</p><p>After ensuring no one was following, he landed on a deserted island and put the items from the pouch into his Qianjun Ring.</p><p>Those two were incredibly well-prepared. With these supplies, he wouldn't lack for anything even if he stayed in the Demon Sea for a few more years, giving him much greater freedom of movement.</p><p>“The place where we fought before isn’t far from Duoyan Island. As long as those five are cautious, they should have reached Duoyan Island by now and reported the situation to Ran Luo. If Ran Luo sends someone to meet them, should I contact them?”</p><p>Qin Sang sat cross-legged on the ground, stroking his chin, pondering his next move.</p><p>Ultimately, Qin Sang decided against contacting them.</p><p>Upon learning of the inter-tribal conflict and the closure of Duoyan Island, Qin Sang had almost immediately decided not to return to Duoyan Island until the chaos subsided.</p><p>That was why he traded with those two, ensuring he had enough supplies to act independently in the Demon Sea.</p><p>He had experienced the great battle of Xiao Han Domain and Tianxing League, fighting on the front lines for five years. He knew firsthand how terrifying wars between cultivators could be.</p><p>This was true even for Foundation Establishment cultivators; the battles between Golden Core cultivators were even more unpredictable.</p><p>In Xiao Han Domain, as a disciple of Shao Hua Mountain, he had been compelled to participate in the war to comprehend the Killing Talisman.</p><p>Now, things were different. He could comprehend the Killing Talisman by hunting monsters. He had been unexpectedly transported here and had no deep entanglement with the power of the Canglang Sea's human and witch tribes.</p><p>Duoyan Island seemed safe, with a Nascent Soul cultivator stationed there.</p><p>However, if the war escalated, it’s likely neither the human nor the witch tribe could remain unaffected; Duoyan Island would become an even bigger target, and Lin Hai's attempt to seal the island off from the world would be futile.</p><p>In that case, the cultivators on the island would be forced into battle, following Lin Hai's orders, and Qin Sang would have no choice but to side with humanity.</p><p>Although not a Canglang Sea cultivator, his human identity left him no other option.  In such times, being a fence-sitter was the quickest way to die.</p><p>Qin Sang was merely an overseas guest elder of the Qiongyu Trading Company, with no roots on Duoyan Island and no superiors to back him.  The most dangerous missions would inevitably fall to him.</p><p>Why would he jump into the fire pit willingly?</p><p>Now it seemed that the assassination attempt was a blessing in disguise, allowing him to escape Duoyan Island.</p><p>Therefore, Qin Sang decided to temporarily cut contact with the Qiongyu Trading Company, pretending to have disappeared.  He could then provide an excuse if they met again, avoiding a direct confrontation and a forced involvement in their affairs.</p><p>Qin Sang had a good impression of the Qiongyu Trading Company, and maintaining ties with them was beneficial.</p><p>“Where should I go next?  Should I go straight to Huntian Island to look for the Que Firebird?  I wonder what the situation is like on Huntian Island now. Before the great upheaval, I could have taken a boat, but now I'll probably have to fly there. Fortunately, Huntian Island and Duoyan Island aren't far apart, only a large island separating them. With the protective talisman, I don't need to worry…”</p><p>Qin Sang looked towards the southwest, muttering softly.</p><p>He had planned to visit once he collected all the Jiao souls.</p><p>The Hun Yuan Tongxin Ring could serve as a warning system, very useful in the Demon Sea.</p><p>Especially now, with the inter-tribal conflict, he could foresee spending the next few years alone wandering the Demon Sea, perhaps even hiding in the deepest parts to avoid the war.  The usefulness of the Hun Yuan Tongxin Ring would become very apparent.</p><p>“The sooner I refine the Hun Yuan Tongxin Ring, the sooner I can hunt monsters with peace of mind.”</p><p>If things get completely out of hand, and even the calm waters become unsafe, I'll just hide deep in the Demon Sea.  I won't get involved in this mess…"</p><p>Qin Sang, after careful consideration, made her decision.</p><p>Before setting off, she needed to find a place to repair those magical artifacts; it would significantly improve her chances.</p><p>With this in mind, Qin Sang took a moment to rest and find a nearby island with a spirit vein. She set up a powerful barrier and dedicated herself to studying the Golden Light Armor and other artifacts.</p><p>A month later, Qin Sang dismantled the barrier, flew off the island, and headed towards Huntian Island.</p><p>She now wore an inner armor.</p><p>Qin Sang touched her chest, feeling the power of the Golden Light Armor, a smile gracing her lips.  Then, with a flash of her eyes, she retracted the armor into her dantian.</p><p>Over the past month, Qin Sang had painstakingly researched and wasted many demonic bones and materials, finally finding a way to perfectly repair the cracks in the Golden Light Armor.  However, the damage to its spiritual essence from the Blood-Polluting Divine Light hadn't fully recovered and still required nurturing.</p><p>Qin Sang flew at a low altitude, maintaining a safe distance from the sea surface to avoid surprise attacks from sea beasts.</p><p>Her gaze was sharp, ensuring no one was watching, before she took out a map of the Demon Sea.</p><p>"The shipping lanes are probably unsafe now, so I can't follow them exactly. But the lanes are well-charted routes, and the sea beasts there are weaker.  Outside, it's extremely dangerous, so I can't stray too far…"</p><p>Qin Sang put away the map, her mind made up. She subtly adjusted her course, her figure gradually disappearing into the deep ocean.</p><p>…</p><p>Months later.</p><p>A white light descended from the sky, landing on a deserted island. As the light dispersed, it revealed a figure – Qin Sang, exhausted from her long journey.</p><p>For so long, Qin Sang had been continuously using her flying artifact or sword to travel.</p><p>She remembered the scene in Xiao Han Domain, where Xuan Yu Daozhang elegantly rode in a carriage pulled by a Jiao dragon spirit. That way, she wouldn't have had to expend so much mental energy, only needing to focus a sliver of her consciousness on the Jiao dragon spirit; she could even have multi-tasked and cultivated.</p><p>In the Demon Sea, danger lurked everywhere, so Qin Sang dared not take such risks and had to do everything herself.</p>
