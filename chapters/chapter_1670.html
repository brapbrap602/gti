<h1>Chapter 1661: Blood-Stained Monk's Robes</h1><p>The light from the exploding sword star expanded.</p><p>The surrounding magneto-force was impacted, as if enraged, surging wildly.</p><p>Tainted by the Nine-Source Magneto-force, the starlight was somewhat dim and heavy, not as dazzling, but appearing even more dangerous.</p><p>Mo Xingdao circled the outer perimeter for a moment, glancing at the direction Su Zinan disappeared towards, hesitated, then chose to abandon the pursuit.</p><p>The Poison King pressed forward, his poison cloud able to withstand the magneto-force, but not as easily as Master Huaiyin. He gradually fell behind.</p><p>Qin Sang, Master Huaiyin, and Su Zinan were in the vanguard, the three figures advancing in three different directions towards the heart of the starlight.</p><p>At this time, Kun Dao, having left the central hidden star, appeared at the edge of the Nine-Source Magneto-force.</p><p>Earlier, the trajectory of the sword star and the Star Pavilion's movement, even the timing of their collision with the Nine-Source Magneto-force and the explosion, were all guided by her from behind the scenes. Everything seemed natural, avoiding suspicion from her prey.</p><p>Her only concern was that the treasures in the Star Pavilion weren't numerous enough. Now it seemed the effect was surprisingly good; three groups of people were all lured by the treasures into the Nine-Source Magneto-force.</p><p>A fierce battle was inevitable. It all depended on whether she could seize the opportunity.</p><p>A murderous smile curved Kun Dao's lips.  Her figure melted into the Nine-Source Magneto-force's divine light and vanished instantly.</p><p>Qin Sang knew someone had arrived earlier and was faster than him. His protective罡火罩 (Gang Huo Zhao) shielded him, his phoenix wings beating rapidly as he charged through the chaotic magneto-force.</p><p>The Nine-Source Magneto-force, combined with the aftershocks of the sword star's explosion, created extreme chaos here, distorting vision and perception. For a time, Qin Sang also lost his target.</p><p>However, in the short term, the Star Pavilion fragments shouldn't stray far from the center of the starlight.</p><p>Qin Sang's speed was like lightning, his expression calm as he considered how to deal with the situation.</p><p>At this moment, the Fire Jade Centipede in his sleeve sensed something again, jolting awake and twisting its body.</p><p>Qin Sang could feel the Fire Jade Centipede's excitement, and… confusion.</p><p>A familiar scene repeated itself, for the third time!</p><p>Over the years, as Qin Sang's understanding of the Fire Jade Centipede deepened, he had almost deduced a pattern.  What usually triggered the Fire Jade Centipede's instinctive response were mostly naturally formed treasures.</p><p>For example, Red Fire Gilded Gold, Wanling Fruit and other spirit herbs beneficial to spirit insects, or special fire-attribute spirit materials, as well as mineral veins formed from fire-attribute minerals.</p><p>And as the Fire Jade Centipede's cultivation increased, its tastes became more discerning. Now, taking it to a fire-elemental stone vein would certainly be met with a dismissive glance.</p><p>Therefore, anything that could trigger its instinctive response would be of no small value.</p><p>However, if it were an exceptionally unique, man-made treasure with a unique aura, the Fire Jade Centipede would also be interested.  Those who refine fire spirits in the Fire Phase Hall could also be included in this category.</p><p>Since entering the Five Elements Restriction, the Fire Jade Centipede had sensed something three times, respectively at the outer restriction, the sword array, and the Nine-Source Magneto-force.</p><p>If they were unowned, naturally formed treasures, how could they continuously appear and disappear in such a place?</p><p>And the three reactions were strikingly similar. The target seemed to be moving at high speed, making it impossible for the Fire Jade Centipede to lock on, instead leaving it dizzy.</p><p>"What on earth is it?"</p><p>Qin Sang was baffled, his vigilance heightened.</p><p>Before he could think too much, he had already surged into the depths of the starlight. The magneto-force here far exceeded that of the outside.</p><p>Outside, most of the Nine-Source Magneto-force was in a mist-like form, with only a small amount condensed into the yellowish-brown and grayish-black divine light of the Nine-Source Magneto-force.  Here, however, the Nine-Source Magneto-force divine light filled everywhere.</p><p>The divine light crisscrossed and collided, constructing a vibrant world, as brilliant as the aurora.</p><p>The Sky Eye Butterfly finally saw the sword star again.</p><p>Or rather, fragments of the sword star.</p><p>The fragments of the sword star and the Star Pavilion, instead of scattering, were drawn together by the magneto-force.  However, due to the interwoven Nine-Source Magneto-force divine light and the chaotic magnetic force, they were divided into clumps, scattered across the vast space.</p><p>And as the Nine-Source Magneto-force divine light shifted, these fragments also moved continuously, sometimes merging, sometimes being torn apart by the magnetic force, and then captured by other clumps.</p><p>Qin Sang quickly scanned, locking onto one clump of fragments.</p><p>His luck was good. The treasures that flew out of the Star Pavilion were not scattered by the explosion of the sword star, most of them were still clustered together, including the Xinjin Yuanjing.</p><p>However, while seeing these treasures, Qin Sang also spotted an unwelcome guest.</p><p>A monk, with a golden dragon circling his body, exuded an imposing aura, even faster than him!</p><p>"Master Huaiyin!"</p><p>Qin Sang's heart sank.</p><p>He had previously noticed the monk's vigorous vital energy.  It proved that this person was a rare martial artist whose skill far surpassed his own. The golden dragon was formed from his vital energy, and as it circled his body, the nearby magnetic light twisted.</p><p>Facing the powerful magnetic force alone!</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>Master Huaiyin took a step forward. A golden dragon roared, seemingly ignoring the intense magnetic field, instantly surging hundreds of meters.</p><p>Wherever he passed, the magnetic force distorted, like countless sharp swords.  Some were shattered by the golden dragon's power, while others pierced Master Huaiyin's body.  Yet, golden light flowed around him, like a golden armor. The magnetic rays bounced off his skin, unable to hinder him in the slightest.</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang couldn't help but marvel at the monk's unparalleled might!</p><p>Despite his admiration, Qin Sang couldn't let Master Huaiyin obtain the treasure. However, the Jinchen Sword was unusable within the magnetic field, and the Sun Bird needed caution. He silently formed hand seals, preparing to summon thunder and divine incantations.</p><p>At that moment, an unexpected event occurred.</p><p>The explosion of Jianxing hadn't completely subsided. Amidst the roar, a visible shockwave spread towards the fragment containing the treasure, causing the nearby magnetic field to fluctuate.</p><p>Just as Master Huaiyin was about to succeed, a thick beam of magnetic force suddenly swept in from afar, instantly pulling the fragment away.</p><p>Master Huaiyin reacted swiftly, but his movement was hampered, causing him to miss the optimal moment to seize the treasure.</p><p>Above his head, a blood cloud had gathered without warning.</p><p>The blood cloud was devoid of any foul odor, remarkably pure. Inside, a jade disc, a talisman, floated. The talisman flipped, facing Master Huaiyin, its center radiating intense blood light. Strange runes flashed consecutively, and several crimson chains shot out.</p><p>*Whoosh whoosh whoosh!*</p><p>The crimson chains targeted Master Huaiyin's limbs and neck, aiming to bind him.</p><p>Master Huaiyin coldly snorted, his voice like thunder. His back straightened, the golden dragon roared ferociously, and his right arm muscles bulged as he delivered a powerful upward punch.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The crimson chains shattered, the blood cloud recoiled, and the talisman trembled, nearly breaking.</p><p>The power of that single punch was terrifying!</p><p>"Master, please calm down. Perhaps we could…"</p><p>Su Zinan's figure flickered into view from within the magnetic field, his voice booming as he used a secret technique.</p><p>He enjoyed watching powerful cultivators fight to the death, but preferred to sow discord and wait for the opportune moment, rather than risk his own life. Besides, Master Huaiyin, a physical cultivator, wasn't his target.</p><p>Unexpectedly, mid-sentence, Master Huaiyin's ears twitched, and he abruptly turned his head, just in time to see a ball of black fire shoot out from the magnetic field, heading straight for the fragment.</p><p>It was Qin Sang.</p><p>He had intended to personally stop Master Huaiyin, but since someone else had taken the initiative, he changed his mind.  The magnetic force was pulling the fragment towards him; he couldn't pass up the opportunity.</p><p>However, Qin Sang remained extremely vigilant and cautious. He recognized the blood-based talisman, instantly identifying it as Su Zinan's work.</p><p>Judging from Su Zinan's tone, they had previously interacted. Qin Sang couldn't allow Su Zinan and Master Huaiyin time to negotiate a distribution of spoils; otherwise, he would be at a disadvantage.</p><p>Most importantly, Qin Sang was wary of a mysterious enemy lurking in the shadows.</p><p>Master Huaiyin was about to succeed when the magnetic field abruptly shifted, pulling the treasure towards Qin Sang.  This didn't feel like good fortune to Qin Sang; it felt too coincidental!</p><p>In a flash, Qin Sang had no time to hesitate or fully consider his options, but he acted.  Seizing the treasure directly would be best; otherwise, his suspicions would be confirmed.</p><p>"It's you?"</p><p>"How dare you!"</p><p>Su Zinan and Master Huaiyin shouted simultaneously.</p><p>Qin Sang was enveloped in a magical fire shield. Su Zinan couldn't see Qin Sang's face, but he recognized the demonic fire.</p><p>Upon this reunion, Su Zinan, without hesitation, drew a talisman in mid-air, merging it with the jade disc. The disc trembled slightly and reversed, its center aimed at Qin Sang's escape route.</p><p>Above Qin Sang, a crimson 'death' character appeared.</p><p>The talisman faded, but the death character became even brighter, spreading an overwhelming aura of death as it descended upon Qin Sang.</p><p>Su Zinan attacked Qin Sang without mercy.  He had already revealed his killing intent towards Qin Sang; reconciliation was impossible. At the first opportunity, he would strike and eliminate this future threat.</p><p>Simultaneously, he shouted, "Master, don't hesitate! Seize this person!"</p><p>Master Huaiyin and Su Zinan had no prior interaction, but Master Huaiyin had heard of Su Zinan's reputation from the Poison King and harbored no good feelings towards him, making him unlikely to heed his words.</p><p>However, without Su Zinan's urging, Master Huaiyin would never allow the Xin Jin Yuan Jing to fall into another's hands. He stomped his foot, his entire body like a mountain, causing the void to tremble. As he dashed forward, his fists clenched, he delivered a flat punch aimed at Qin Sang.</p><p>The wind howled, and the golden dragon roared.</p><p>Blood energy surged, plunging into the space between his fists, completely merging with the fist imprint.</p><p>The next moment, a golden dragon, condensed from the intent of his punch, broke free, its terrifying power seeming capable of destroying everything. Even through the protective罡 fire shield, Qin Sang felt the shockingly violent force, his heart pounding in alarm.</p><p>Above him, the ‘Death’ seal; before him, the dragon punch.</p><p>Even under the protection of the罡 fire shield, Qin Sang's mind tensed.</p><p>Unbeknownst to him, Su Zinan and Master Huaiyin were also unsettled, amazed by the power of the罡 fire shield.</p><p>Although the Death seal and dragon punch hadn't yet struck Qin Sang, their shockwaves had already reached him.  The two forces collided, causing only a slight deformation in the罡 fire shield – despite the omnipresent magnetic light.</p><p>With such a treasure protecting him, it's no wonder this man dared to snatch chestnuts from the fire.</p><p>Su Zinan's gaze was dark.  Qin Sang's demonic and solar flames, though powerful offensive abilities, were overly forceful and prone to breaking. Su Zinan believed that with careful planning, there was a chance to succeed.</p><p>Only now did he realize that the demonic flames could also transform into a defensive ability, making them both offensive and defensive— versatile and incredibly difficult to counter.</p><p>Su Zinan slightly regretted choosing Qin Sang for the magic banner, but it was too late to undo the offense.</p><p>His eyes flickered, lost in thought.</p><p>Master Huaiyin's thoughts were simpler.</p><p>In an instant, Qin Sang became the target of two powerful cultivators, locked in by two formidable attacks.</p><p>However, what put Qin Sang on high alert wasn't this, but the fiery centipede's simultaneous violent reaction and the approach of the mysterious expert lurking in the shadows!</p><p>"Was this premeditated, a fortuitous coincidence, or...?"</p><p>Qin Sang's thoughts raced, leading to an immediate decision.</p><p>The fragment was just ahead, yet Qin Sang suddenly stopped, his figure freezing before he retreated swiftly.</p><p>His advance and retreat were decisively executed.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang so easily forced back, Su Zinan and Master Huaiyin were both taken aback.</p><p>Equally surprised was Kun Dao in the shadows.  Merged with a beam of magnetic light, she saw Qin Sang retreat and cursed him a coward; she had almost made her move.</p><p>Since Qin Sang retreated, Kun Dao shifted her target back to Master Huaiyin.</p><p>At this moment, regardless of Qin Sang's motives, Master Huaiyin moved like lightning.  By chance, the fragment was again drawn towards him by the magnetic light.</p><p>Qin Sang retreated, opening up space.  Master Huaiyin didn't pursue, the golden dragon punch passing him by.</p><p>Looking again, Master Huaiyin was very close to the fragment.</p><p>With a slight change in expression, Qin Sang quickly cast an incantation.</p><p>A thunderbolt from a clear sky.</p><p>Against the backdrop of intertwined yellow and grey-black magnetic light, a lightning bolt dispelled the darkness as the control-lightning spell activated.</p><p>While this spell’s power wasn't as great as the sword array or demonic flames, it was still considerable; Master Huaiyin, resisting purely with his physical body, would surely feel some apprehension.  However, Qin Sang felt it wasn't enough, so while casting the spell, he used his spiritual sense to activate the Thousand Knot Divine Net and the Soul-Seizing Mantra.</p><p>"Hmph! Ha!"</p><p>Two soul-seizing sounds and the thunderclap echoed in Master Huaiyin's mind.</p><p>Meanwhile, Su Zinan, knowing Qin Sang was difficult to deal with, set aside his distractions and refocused on the treasure, unwilling to let Master Huaiyin obtain it, and attacked him as well.</p><p>His mastery of blood magic was unparalleled.</p><p>The fusion of the two demonic shadows wasn't just about countering the magnetic light; it also enhanced his abilities, increasing his control. With a slight thought, the Death seal, which was about to miss, was forcibly pulled back, its direction altered to target Master Huaiyin.</p><p>In an instant, the roles reversed, with Master Huaiyin becoming the target of concentrated attacks.</p><p>Facing the onslaught, Master Huaiyin remained calm, extending his fan-like hand.  Blood energy formed a golden vortex in his palm, its suction locking onto the fragment.</p><p>At the same time, a golden dragon of blood energy reappeared on him, the intense golden light accompanied by a dragon's roar and faint Buddhist chants.</p><p>Buddha light gathered behind Master Huaiyin, manifesting a Lo Han (Arhat) phantom.</p><p>The Lo Han resembled Master Huaiyin. The moment the phantom appeared, the golden dragon plunged into it, merging into one, the tangible Buddha light completely enveloping Master Huaiyin.</p><p>Master Huaiyin transformed into a golden Arhat, making the Death seal and thunder seem insignificant.</p><p>The next moment, a sudden change occurred!</p><p>The magnetic light surged, drawn by some force, crazily rushing towards Master Huaiyin.</p><p>In an instant, all the magnetic light converged into a thick beam, the astonishing power of primal magnetism enveloping Master Huaiyin. The golden Arhat phantom violently shook, and with the thunder and Death seal striking down, it was torn open by countless cracks.</p><p>A thunderous roar came from within the magnetic light.</p><p>Within the magnetic light...</p><p>Master Huaiyin, like an enraged Vajra, a slender jade hand pierced his chest from behind, staining his monk's robe with blood.</p>
