<h1>Chapter 775: Crimson Red</h1><p>The mountain path was rugged and strewn with boulders.</p><p>The terrain was treacherous, and out of caution, Qin Sang chose not to fly.</p><p>Although the topographical map had markings, the area wasn't static.</p><p>For example, the locations of ferocious beasts' nests changed with each opening, and the beasts fought amongst themselves.  Accidental encounters were frequent.</p><p>The number of cultivators who perished at the mouths of these beasts was no less than those who fell victim to the secret realm's restrictions.</p><p>Qin Sang and his two-headed beast remained vigilant.  The two-headed beast possessed a keen sense for such creatures.</p><p>Soon, Qin Sang reached the summit.  He moved quickly, concealing himself among the rocks to observe the path ahead.</p><p>He had chosen a secluded route, finding no signs of previous passage.  The forest ahead appeared tranquil and deserted.</p><p>The mountains rose higher and higher; it was a matter of taking each step as it came.</p><p>He and his two-headed beast crossed a valley and began climbing another mountain. After traversing three mountains without incident, their pace quickened.</p><p>“There it is…”</p><p>Standing atop the mountain, Qin Sang gazed at the sea of clouds beyond the peaks, his eyes fixed, muttering to himself.</p><p>At the edge of his vision, a towering tower emerged from the depths of the cloud sea, its silhouette indistinct.</p><p>A golden light shone from within the clouds, as if a great sun were hidden there.</p><p>The clouds shifted and changed, and given the distance, Qin Sang could only see a portion of the central tower; its peak disappeared into the clouds.</p><p>From afar,</p><p>bathed in the golden light, the tower seemed surrounded by countless auspicious birds and beasts, exuding an otherworldly aura that captivated Qin Sang.</p><p>He looked towards the clouds.</p><p>Had he fallen from there?</p><p>He stared for a long time, puzzled, seeing nothing but the vast expanse of clouds. No wonder the cultivators at the base of the tower had mistaken him for a corpse.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Qin Sang looked away, patted his two-headed beast, and continued on.</p><p>…</p><p>A large river cut through a valley between two mountains. The rushing water crashed against the cliffs, splashing white foam.</p><p>Waterfalls cascaded down the cliff faces on either side, their deafening roar echoing through the mountains, drowning out other sounds.</p><p>At that moment, Qin Sang and his two-headed beast were hidden in the bushes, looking up at the damp cliff face ahead, not daring to make a sound.</p><p>The mist rising from the waterfall created a light fog in the valley, providing excellent concealment.</p><p>Their gaze was fixed on a crevice in the cliff, from which red-tailed cranes with white feathers occasionally emerged, circling before returning.</p><p>From Qin Sang's position, he could partially see inside.</p><p>The crevice served as a nest for these cranes; there were over a dozen of them.</p><p>Each one was similar in appearance.</p><p>The adult cranes, including their long tail feathers, were about ten feet long.</p><p>Qin Sang recognized them as Red-tailed Cranes, unique to the Seven Killing Hall.  They were aggressive beasts, with claws like swords. Although slender in build compared to other fierce creatures, their bodies were exceptionally strong.</p><p>Even a late-stage Golden Core cultivator would flee at the sight of a flock of adult Red-tailed Cranes.</p><p>These cranes favored shady forests, often nesting in ancient trees, and a flock could occupy a large area of woodland.</p><p>The concealed nature of their nests often led cultivators to unwittingly trespass.</p><p>Strangely, this flock resided in the crevice—an environment they normally detested.  Qin Sang almost alerted them before quickly hiding.</p><p>Most cultivators would have fled at the sight of so many.</p><p>But Qin Sang, bold in his skill, ventured closer.  He discovered the reason for their unusual choice of habitat.</p><p>An ancient vine was rooted deep within the crevice, clinging to the rocks.</p><p>Crimson red fruits hung from the upside-down vines.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn’t identify the fruit.</p><p>But to attract an entire flock of Red-tailed Cranes to relocate, it had to be extraordinary. Qin Sang decided to get closer and attempt to steal the fruit, alongside his two-headed beast.</p><p>If he encountered a secret realm sealed by ancient restrictions, which would require time to break, he would not linger regardless of the treasure. He'd head straight for the tower.</p><p>Snatching the fruit and running away wouldn't waste much time.</p><p>He was also quite familiar with Red-tailed Cranes and confident in evading them. Such enticing fruit—it would be a shame not to take some.</p><p>The Seven Kills Hall held many areas where spiritual herbs and fruits grew, but these were either heavily guarded by magical barriers or ferocious beasts.  Whether one could harvest them depended entirely on their strength.</p><p>Such opportunities were rare; miss it and it's gone.</p><p>Regardless of a fruit's properties or ripeness, obtaining it was always worthwhile.</p><p>Qin Sang quietly retreated, studying the surrounding terrain. Returning to her original position, she instructed the two-headed creature—again employing the same tactic—to lure the enemy.</p><p>Qin Sang was intimately familiar with this routine, using her escape techniques to her advantage.</p><p>The two-headed creature was apprehensive.  These red-tailed cranes were significantly stronger than the beasts at the cliff base. If captured, it would likely be killed.</p><p>"When you run, jump into the river. They won't find you. Meet me downstream.  Once we identify the fruit, I'll give you one," </p><p>Qin Sang whispered a promise.</p><p>The two-headed creature's fluffy heads bobbed before Qin Sang, its two vertical pupils staring intently.</p><p>It strongly suspected Qin Sang was deceiving it.</p><p>Since being captured, it had been used as a pack animal, performing all the dirty and tiring work, yet receiving nothing in return. Its status was even lower than the fat worm that ate and slept.</p><p>If not for Qin Sang's sworn promise of freedom, it would have refused long ago.</p><p>Qin Sang glared fiercely, "Aren't you afraid it's poisonous and will kill you? The beasts here are all abnormal. If you want to become like them, go ahead and eat it!"</p><p>The two-headed creature, sensing the impending chaos, shrunk its head, then leaped from the bushes.</p><p>Its movements were agile. It landed on the cliff face, its sharp claws digging deep into the rock before launching itself upward.</p><p>Simultaneously, the red-tailed cranes hidden in the crevices spotted the two-headed creature, emitting piercing shrieks.</p><p>‘Whoosh…whoosh…’</p><p>Several adult red-tailed cranes burst from the cracks, diving down with lightning speed.</p><p>A gust of wind hit them.</p><p>The red-tailed cranes were imposing, their sharp talons glinting menacingly.  The two-headed creature, however, used its agility, creating multiple illusory images, scattering in different directions across the cliff, but all aiming at the same overall goal.</p><p>The red-tailed cranes, momentarily confused by the illusions, split their forces.</p><p>They failed to notice a figure stealthily scaling the cliff in the distance while the two-headed creature diverted their attention.</p><p>‘Plop…plop…’</p><p>The illusions were successively broken, and the two-headed creature, realizing the situation was hopeless, flipped and leaped from the cliff, landing on the ground and fleeing at top speed.</p><p>The enraged red-tailed cranes pursued relentlessly.</p><p>By this time, the figure had already reached the top of the cliff.</p>
