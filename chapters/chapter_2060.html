<h1>Chapter 2051: The Two Divisions of Water and Sky</h1><p>The brothers Qing Jia and Qing Yi were currently at the third rank of the Nascent Soul Realm.  Similar to the Golden Core stage, this realm also had early, middle, and late phases.  They were in the late phase, though having only recently entered it, they were still some distance from their next breakthrough.</p><p>Qin Sang watched the two brothers cultivate, sensing the changes within their bodies. He discovered that the Giant Clan's inherited cultivation method could be considered a body refinement technique. However, unlike the human race's strength-cultivating methods, they had an additional step in their cultivation process: constantly circulating their vital essence and blood, pouring it into their arms.</p><p>Their arms seemed like two bottomless pits, ceaselessly devouring vital essence and blood. Yet, this consumption wasn't in vain. Within their arms, an unknown and profound transformation occurred, after which the essence would nourish their bodies in return, preventing complete depletion of their vital essence and blood. In this way, it cycled endlessly. With each complete circulation, their cultivation would increase slightly.</p><p>"This should be what the Otherfolk call constantly refining their Innate Divine Abilities, seeking the origin of their ancestors. The Innate Divine Ability is the foundation of their Dao, regarded as their lifeblood by the Otherfolk…"</p><p>Qin Sang mused that the Otherfolk’s cultivation was indeed unique.  The legend of Ancestral Realm cultivators among the Otherfolk indicated that they had walked this path successfully, finding a path to the Great Dao within their Innate Divine Abilities.</p><p>He observed for a moment, then woke the two brothers and inquired about a few matters concerning the Giant Clan.  The two answered everything they knew.</p><p>Next, Qin Sang took out a jade bottle. "Try refining the Four Restoration Balm inside."</p><p>Four Restoration Balm was a type of medicinal pill that could aid human cultivators in body refinement.</p><p>The two brothers thanked Qin Sang for the medicine.  Opening the jade bottle, they smelled a rich, exotic fragrance. Qing Jia twitched his nose, sensing the medicinal properties of the Four Restoration Balm, and said joyfully, "Reporting to Master, we can definitely refine the Four Restoration Balm! Back at Luo Hua Temple, when our clan made contributions, the pills bestowed by the Upper True of Luo Hua Temple were mostly human strength-enhancing spirit pills, which the clan elders treasured greatly."</p><p>They sat cross-legged, following the medicine consumption method Qin Sang taught them, applying the Four Restoration Balm to their skin.  Urging their vital essence and blood, the medicinal power slowly seeped into their bodies. After refining it, they indeed showed considerable improvement.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, then commanded, "Attack each other, using only your own divine abilities."</p><p>"Yes!"</p><p>Qing Jia and Qing Yi stood facing each other.  They had grown up together since childhood, never separated.  The spells they practiced and the teachings they received were identical.</p><p>They simultaneously raised their right arms. A series of cracking sounds emanated from their joints, their muscles taut. The black markings on their arms became noticeably brighter, exuding a strange black light, and a peculiar energy flowed.</p><p>Next, the brothers opened their palms wide, simultaneously grabbing towards each other. Ripples appeared in the void, followed by a loud explosion.</p><p>Distinct spiritual waves erupted from the space between them.  Before they could spread outward, they dissipated into nothingness.</p><p>Qin Sang observed intently. He had heard the brothers talk about their clan's divine abilities and knew that they were currently using the Void Tearing Palm, a technique learned after breaking through to the third rank of the Nascent Soul Realm. This palm technique could seize enemies from afar and even restrain Dao techniques.</p><p>As the Otherfolk’s cultivation increased, in addition to the transformations derived from their Innate Divine Abilities, the clan also possessed inherited secret techniques based on these abilities.</p><p>After observing for a while, Qin Sang instructed them to withdraw.</p><p>This was also in preparation for the upcoming journey to the Sea of Mist. Qin Sang pondered that, compared to humans, the Otherfolk were not easy to deal with.</p><p>Among humans, the vast majority cultivated the Five Elements Dao. As long as one determined their foundation, aside from those disciples of major sects, one could generally have a good grasp of their subsequent methods.</p><p>The Otherfolk, however, were different.  Different tribes possessed different Innate Divine Abilities. When encountering unfamiliar Otherfolk, prior experience was completely inapplicable.</p><p>Su Nu had also commented on this in the jade slip. Some Otherfolk possessed incredibly overbearing divine abilities that defied all logic.</p><p>If, like the Giant Clan, they had distinct characteristics, one could guess that their Innate Divine Ability was related to their arms. But there were also Otherfolk whose abilities were difficult to discern externally.  When encountering them, one could only adapt to the circumstances.</p><p>After carefully reviewing the contents of the jade slip, Qin Sang’s thoughts stirred, and he appeared in the small grotto-heaven within the Thousand Jun Ring.</p><p>Over the years, whenever Qin Sang had free time, he would enter the small grotto-heaven to explore. Because he could only stay for a short time each visit, he had entered countless times, finally leaving only one place unexplored.</p><p>Qin Sang landed directly on the highest peak of the small grotto-heaven. Before him was a high altar.</p><p>This altar was the most unusual place in the entire small grotto-heaven. Qin Sang had saved it for last, hoping to find some clues from other locations. However, he had already opened all the other pavilions and halls and found nothing useful.</p><p>It was as if the small grotto-heaven had been abandoned before the Thousand Jun Ring was destroyed.</p><p>Time was tight. Qin Sang's gaze swept across the altar, focusing on the areas that differed from human architectural styles. After a moment, his figure flickered, and he appeared atop the altar.</p><p>The altar was completely intact, seemingly lacking nothing. In this case, perhaps the altar's power still remained.</p><p>Sensing for a moment, Qin Sang did not find any place to insert spirit stones.</p><p>Void Refinement cultivators could crush spirit stones with their hands, but this didn’t mean spirit stones were useless. In many situations, such as activating spirit arrays and special artifacts, spirit stones were still irreplaceable.</p><p>"Could it require a ritual and offerings?"</p><p>Qin Sang thought of the Witch Clan's heritage. However, instead of immediately leaving, he sat cross-legged, using his divine sense to connect with the altar.</p><p>Suddenly, a celestial phenomenon arose, and the void became unstable. Qin Sang quickly withdrew his divine sense, not daring to linger any longer.</p><p>Qin Sang's figure silently reappeared in the quiet room, returning to the great world.</p><p>When he entered the small grotto-heaven, he left no trace in the great world, only an invisible, concealed Dao marker. Before the small grotto-heaven violently shook, as long as no fluctuations leaked out, it was very difficult for outsiders to detect.  Qin Sang had cautiously confirmed this, which was why he believed he could escape into the small grotto-heaven for refuge in times of danger.</p><p>Gently stroking the Thousand Jun Ring, Qin Sang's expression turned contemplative. He had just attempted to activate the altar, and although it didn’t trigger anything unusual, he gained a sense of understanding, as if something was missing.</p><p>"Could it be necessary to cultivate the corresponding cultivation methods and secret techniques to activate this altar?"</p><p>Qin Sang frowned slightly, recalling the sensation from that moment. It also felt like the incompleteness stemmed from the altar itself.</p><p>"Perhaps there are other altars that resonate with each other, forming a complete whole. As for whether this altar is primary or secondary, it's unknown."</p><p>After pondering for a long time, Qin Sang decided to set the matter aside for now.</p><p>If the altar remained dormant, it wouldn’t affect the small grotto-heaven. If something unusual did occur, it would indicate the existence of other fragments, which might present another opportunity.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't yet understand what it meant to refine a grotto-heaven into an artifact, but he was certain that if he could comprehend even a little from it in the future, he would benefit greatly!</p><p>Having made his decision, Qin Sang took out the jade slip recording the *Luo Hua Dream Interpretation* and continued to study it.</p><p>In the third month of Qin Sang’s arrival in Sleepless City, Gu Ya suddenly hurried into the inner hall, triggering the quiet room's restrictions.  Hearing Qin Sang's inquiry from within, she replied, "Senior Su Nu has sent a talisman!"</p><p>The quiet room opened on its own, and Gu Ya entered, presenting a talisman.</p><p>Qin Sang raised his hand and took it, breaking the restriction. Seeing the contents of the message, his eyes flickered slightly.</p><p>When Su Nu was preparing to undertake that matter, Qin Sang hadn’t decided when to depart, so he hadn’t informed them.</p><p>Not long ago, Su Nu saw Gu Ya’s message and learned that Qin Sang was already in Sleepless City.  She immediately sent this message, marking an address and urging Qin Sang to depart as soon as possible to rendezvous with her.</p><p>Such urgency.  Had Su Nu encountered some trouble?</p><p>It was likely related to the matter Su Nu was previously handling.  Unfortunately, the message didn’t specify, and they didn’t know what it was.</p><p>Qin Sang looked at the address. It was a place called Turbid Wave Sea in Blue Sand Province.</p><p>There was no time to lose. Qin Sang stood up and said, "Are the arrangements for this estate finalized? We’ll depart today for Blue Sand Province.  We may not have time to return later."</p><p>"So soon?"</p><p>Gu Ya was startled, realizing that something might have gone wrong with Su Nu.  She quickly replied, "Everything is prepared.  There are a few minor matters, I’ll go and arrange them right away."</p><p>Gu Ya hurried back to the lakeside, gathering all the disciples.  Her gaze swept across their faces, and she looked at the old man, "Hu Qi, come with me."</p><p>Hu Qi acknowledged the order and followed Gu Ya to an inner courtyard.</p><p>This small courtyard was previously a forbidden area of the estate. Gu Ya strictly forbade any disciples from approaching it.</p><p>Gu Ya turned to the anxious Hu Qi and said, "I will be leaving Sleepless City with Senior, and it's uncertain when we will return. From now on, you will be in charge of this estate, guiding the disciples in their cultivation."</p><p>Hu Qi's face paled.  He knew the hardships of rogue cultivators all too well, thinking he was about to be abandoned again. He dropped to his knees, "Disciple will diligently cultivate. Please, Master, don't…"</p><p>Gu Ya saw through his thoughts, amused and exasperated. She waved her hand to stop him, "What are you thinking?  Having entered our sect, you are disciples of the Ethereal Spirit Sect.  It’s just that the time isn't right yet to bring you back to the sect. This estate is actually very important…"</p><p>She pointed to the closed door, "Inside is a grand formation.  From now on, you will be responsible for guarding it.  If there are any orders from the sect in the future, spiritual light will appear within the formation.  You must obey the orders.  This responsibility is heavy.  You must prioritize guarding the formation and managing the other disciples."</p><p>Hu Qi's expression eased, and he hurriedly replied, "Disciple will diligently guard the formation, never leaving the estate!"</p><p>Gu Ya nodded, then took out several jade slips, two of which were sealed. "These contain subsequent cultivation techniques. If you break through to Nascent Soul and I haven't returned, you can cultivate them yourself. These two jade slips contain cultivation insights left by past Patriarchs of our sect, but remember not to be greedy. You can only open the seals when your cultivation reaches the required level."</p><p>She had invested considerable effort into this Ethereal Spirit estate. If the Storm Realm ceased to exist, this would be the only remaining lineage of the Ethereal Spirit Sect.</p><p>Having arranged all matters, Gu Ya hurriedly left the estate.  Qin Sang and Jian Nu were already waiting.  The three departed Sleepless City, clouds forming beneath their feet, flying towards the Eastern Sea.</p><p>There were no grand teleportation formations between Sleepless City and Blue Sand Province, so they had to fly themselves.</p><p>Great Ascension cultivators didn’t reveal themselves unless major events occurred.  Body Integration cultivators rarely traveled openly.  Void Refinement cultivators were already considered peak experts in the common perception. Qin Sang only needed to release a sliver of his aura, and no one with any sense would dare to disturb them.</p><p>Flying eastward from Sleepless City for over ten days, crossing a vast expanse of empty sea, they suddenly encountered a dense cluster of islands, with numerous cities, marketplaces, and cultivators. They knew they had entered Blue Sand Province.</p><p>Because of its proximity to Kan Province, the cultivators they saw were still all human.</p><p>Su Nu had already sent back a sea chart of Blue Sand Province. Qin Sang saved himself the trouble of scouting, identified the location of Turbid Wave Sea, and rarely stopped along the way, finally arriving at their destination.</p><p>Turbid Wave Sea was controlled by human forces, yet they frequently saw demon cultivators and Otherfolk coming and going openly. The human cultivators were accustomed to this and didn’t find it strange.</p><p>Blue Sand Province was far less peaceful than Kan Province. Along the way, Qin Sang and the others encountered countless battles. Conflicts were ubiquitous, and many cultivators here carried an air of hostility.  If not for Qin Sang's aura deterring petty scoundrels, they might have been drawn into several fights themselves.</p><p>Of course, Blue Sand Province also had many safe areas, such as Turbid Wave Sea, mostly overseen by major sects and powerful forces who established rules.  Defying their authority meant certain death.</p><p>Uncertain whether Su Nu was in danger, upon entering Turbid Wave Sea, Qin Sang left Jian Nu and Gu Ya waiting in an immortal city and went to meet Su Nu alone.</p><p>Following the directions in the talisman, Qin Sang quickly reached the location, a small marketplace.</p><p>He didn't rush in, observing from the outside first.  Cultivators came and went on the island, everything seemed normal, and he didn’t detect anything unusual.  He then entered the marketplace, arriving before a courtyard.</p><p>As soon as he touched the restriction, the courtyard gate opened wide, and Su Nu's delighted voice rang out, "Brother Qin, you're so fast! Things will be much easier now!"</p><p>Qin Sang entered the courtyard and saw Su Nu gracefully welcoming him at the front hall.  He looked her over, seeing her aura was full and she had no injuries.  He felt relieved and asked, "You urgently summoned me. Did you encounter some trouble?"</p><p>"Little sister is here to scout, how could I make enemies for no reason?" Su Nu smiled.  "Brother Qin, come in and talk. Little sister has discovered something interesting and needs you to make a decision."</p><p>The two sat down in the hall, and Su Nu said, "Brother Qin, you should have seen the message I sent back before, right?"</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, "In these past few years, I've also made some inquiries, but they weren’t as detailed as what you’ve found in Blue Sand Province.  Have you uncovered something new?"</p><p>Su Nu hummed in agreement. "To establish themselves in the great world, the Otherfolk, despite belonging to different tribes, consider themselves as one race, viewing humans and demonfolk as outsiders.  When faced with dangers that threaten the Otherfolk, they unite against the external threat.</p><p>"However, the Otherfolk are not monolithic. Each tribe acts as independent lords, unwilling to be interfered with by other tribes. At the same time, these tribes also unite to strive for the benefits of their own tribe. This inevitably leads to disputes.</p><p>"The two largest factions are the Water Division and the Sky Division.  These two divisions encompass over ninety percent of the tribes.  The Water Division is led by the Merfolk Clan, while the Feathered Clan is the ruler of the Sky Division.  The two divisions are not harmonious and frequently clash.</p><p>"The Water Division's territory is closer to Kan Province, which is why the Otherfolk we encounter in Blue Sand Province are all from the Water Division.  Only a handful of people know the name of the Zhang You Clan, but their territory's location is unknown. I suspect the Zhang You Clan is located deeper within the Sea of Mist, within the Sky Division's territory, and they are certainly not a major tribe…"</p><p>Qin Sang agreed with Su Nu's deduction, pondering, "Does the matter we're about to undertake relate to this?"</p><p>Su Nu nodded, "Indeed!  Earlier, I unexpectedly learned that two Otherfolk, suspected to be from the Sky Division, came to Blue Sand Province for unknown reasons.  However, they're in quite a bit of trouble."</p>
