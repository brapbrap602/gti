<h1>Chapter 206: Bestial Tidal Wave</h1><p>Chapter 206: Bestial Tidal Wave</p><p>At the end of the cave was a square stone chamber, wide enough to accommodate three or four dozen people. The restrictions added to the stone chamber were stacked one atop the other, showing that this refuge had been in existence for a long time, having been able to support life here for so long, was no easy feat.</p><p>Thanks to the restrictions, the stone chamber was surprisingly dry despite being underground, and thus the others were able to relax their tensed minds, find somewhere to sit down, restore the restrictions around the stone chamber, and wait for the celestial phenomenon to end.</p><p>Qin Sang’s attainment in formation restriction was finite, most of which came from his Senior Sister Qing Ting's knowledge, even so, he had more knowledge than the others, after working for a long time he sat down in a corner, his gaze swept across his companions, lingering slightly on Yin Xingge's body before moving away with no change in expression, remembering what Mu Yifeng had told him.</p><p>Mu Yifeng seemed crude and rough but in fact was meticulous.</p><p>Before they had left, Yin Xingge had suddenly jumped the queue, giving them no time to react, and taking direct control of the small team.</p><p>Mu Yifeng speculated that Yin Xingge had certainly come for a reason, and while feigning dissatisfaction, he had actually concealed it from everyone, and left a message asking a friend in Xuanlu Pass to investigate this matter. Even Qin Sang had not noticed his little move.</p><p>Mu Yifeng had been delayed in Gubei for some time, waiting for a message.</p><p>He had not expected to uncover some hidden clues, within Yin Xingge's sect of Pill King, was a cultivator in the Core Formation stage who was looking to refine a Dharma Treasure, and was searching for extreme sun spiritual objects.</p><p>This cultivator in the Core Formation stage had recently gathered a few followers, and went deep into the core area of the Ancient Immortal Battlegrounds, to explore an ancient immortal mansion called the Imperial Blaze Secret Realm.</p><p>The entrance to the Imperial Blaze Secret Realm was permeated with terrifying fire force, and even cultivators in the Core Formation stage would not dare resist it with their bodies, and had to borrow a set of forbidden objects from Xuanlu Pass, which would be possible to check.</p><p>Considering this, Mu Yifeng had speculated that Yin Xingge was acting according to the instructions of that cultivator in the Core Formation stage for the sake of the Ganyang Crystal, and that he harbored thoughts of keeping it for himself!</p><p>If he was lucky, if he really could find a Ganyang Crystal, and bring it back to Xuanlu Pass, this object would belong in common to Xuanlu Pass, and the cultivator in the Core Formation stage would not dare to claim it as his own.</p><p>In the open, the three main sects had to obey the rules and bid for it at the same time.</p><p>Ganyang Crystal was an extreme sun spiritual object, which was something that anyone would want more of, if it was not used to create an extremely yin Dharma Treasure, adding a Ganyang Crystal to a Dharma Treasure would allow it to possess a trace of sun force, and become slightly more useful, there would be no shortage of people wanting to get their hands on it.</p><p>The cultivator in the Core Formation stage from Pill King had exhausted his wealth to search for spiritual objects, he would definitely not be able to compete with others.</p><p>……</p><p>Mu Yifeng was not reckless, after considering it carefully he felt that he and Qin Sang alone could not defeat Yin Xingge, so he used the methods of his sect to relate this matter back, communicating with Senior Brother Qi who was far away in Xuanlu Pass would be impossible, but there were residences of Shaohua Mountain in towns in the middle area, there would definitely be sect experts there.</p><p>If Yin Xingge honestly and openly shared the treasure, there would naturally be nothing wrong, but if he dared to keep the Ganyang Crystal for himself, they would make him spit it out just as he had swallowed it!</p><p>This line of thought matched Qin Sang's, Yin Xingge's cultivation was a stage higher than them, if they faced each other directly, he and Mu Yifeng would not necessarily be Yin Xingge's opponents, unless they could plan against him in advance.</p><p>But Yin Xingge was also cautious, and it would not be easy to plan against him, besides, they could not be certain that Cloudscratcher散人 knew about this matter, if it was a two-on-two situation, they would definitely lose.</p><p>Furthermore, once they entered the mineral vein, they had to work together and hide from the perception of the Cloud Beasts, otherwise there was only one result for internal strife――being torn apart by Cloud Beasts!</p><p>Ganyang Crystals were not like spirit wood, and could not upgrade the Ebony Sword, Qin Sang did not need to fight to the death, all he had to do now was secretly monitor Yin Xingge's actions, and wait and see.</p><p>‘Tat tat……’</p><p>Just as Qin Sang was quietly thinking to himself, there was the sound of heavy footsteps in the cave, echoing in the cave that was sealed off by restrictions, the footsteps coming closer and closer, and then they saw a middle-aged cultivator covered in sand and dirt hurrying in, appearing in the entrance of the stone chamber.</p><p>Someone with the confidence to travel alone in this place certainly would not be weak, he was probably in a hurry, and his aura had not yet calmed down, he was almost the equal of Mu Yifeng, and was only a hair's breadth away from the middle stage of the Foundation Building stage.</p><p>The middle-aged cultivator held a spirit sword in his hand and had a look of caution on his face, when he suddenly saw the ten figures sitting inside the stone chamber, he was clearly startled.</p><p>Qin Sang and the others had not concealed themselves, it would be easy to see that they were a group.</p><p>This person stood at the door, expression uncertain, especially when he noticed Yin Xingge's cultivation, he looked even more hesitant, and did not dare to enter.</p><p>At that moment, sudden footsteps came from outside. The newcomers didn't attempt to conceal themselves since it was unnecessary to do so in this place.</p><p>From their auras, one could sense that there were two people.</p><p>The middle-aged cultivator was overjoyed. He rushed towards where the two people walked in and clasped his hands in greeting. "Fellow Daoists, with the unpredictable danger of the celestial phenomenon, we could join forces on our journey and look out for each other."</p><p>As he spoke, he cast an anxious glance at them.</p><p>The newcomers were slightly puzzled at first, but they soon perceived the auras within the stone chamber and their expressions changed slightly. One of the older-looking cultivators laughed heartily, "You're very welcome. We wouldn't dare decline your invitation."</p><p>The three cultivators had similar cultivation levels. By joining forces, they would be able to contend against Qin Sang and his companions in a battle. With this in mind, they entered the stone chamber. The older-looking cultivator bowed his hands to Yin Xingge and said, "My name is Wang Dahe. We hope you fellow Daoists can accommodate our presence. We will be grateful for your understanding."</p><p>…</p><p>The sound of the wind and sand roared, the earth veins shook, and the shelter's restrictions were damaged by the celestial phenomenon, causing it to fluctuate erratically. Everyone had to put aside their worries and focus on repairing it with all their might.</p><p>After Wang Dahe and the other three, a few more cultivators arrived one after another, all of them looking disheveled.</p><p>However, the atmosphere within the stone chamber had become much more harmonious.</p><p>This time, the celestial phenomenon did not last long. In less than two days, it subsided. Everyone filed out of the cave, greeted by the sight of endless, desolate yellow sand. There seemed to be no change.</p><p>After leaving the shelter, Qin Sang and his companions increased their speed. After another half a month, they finally reached their destination. Fortunately, they did not encounter any more celestial phenomena along the way. They managed to avoid the several cloud beast hordes they encountered in advance.</p><p>They had long since left the desert, and now, mountain ranges stretched out before them like giant dragons, crouching on the ground. The highest peaks even reached the high-altitude罡 wind.</p><p>To the naked eye, the dark black soil and rocks were gleaming with a metallic luster. The surface of the mountains was devoid of any life, not a single trace of greenery could be seen. It was like a desolate land.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang and his companions were hiding on a hillside. Although the aura of the star compass cloud device concealed the fluctuations on their bodies, everyone, including Qin Sang, was filled with a sense of terror. They趴 there, not daring to move or breathe.</p><p>Before them, amidst the mountains, was an enormous chasm. The dark clouds above the chasm covered the sky and blotted out the sun. Upon closer inspection, one could see that they were actually countless cloud beasts resembling eagles gathered together.</p>
