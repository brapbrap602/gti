<h1>Chapter 1027: The Treasure Pavilion</h1><p>The illusory array's power gradually increased, but with Ming Wei and Tian Mu Die cooperating, their speed was even faster than Qin Sang's had been.</p><p>Qin Sang only needed to deal with any potential dangers.</p><p>Ming Wei secretly observed Qin Sang.  Seeing his sword techniques, she was surprised, thinking, “Such exquisite swordsmanship is rare even among cultivators of the same level. Why is someone with such talent unknown in the Canglang Sea?”</p><p>Her beautiful eyes flickered as she tried to see through his mask and discern his true identity.</p><p>“Collaborating with him was the right choice…”</p><p>Finally, they safely exited the Thousand Mountain Array.</p><p>Instantly, the thick fog dissipated.</p><p>They found themselves inside a pavilion.</p><p>The layout was similar to the previous courtyard, with two teleportation arrays on one side of the pavilion.  The difference was that this pavilion had an exit leading outside.</p><p>Ming Wei walked to the door, leaned on the railing, and looked outside, saying, “This door must lead to the inner hall…”</p><p>Qin Sang looked around and gazed outwards.</p><p>The outside scenery was completely visible.</p><p>The pavilion was suspended in mid-air, its base empty, surrounded by brilliantly shining, multicolored celestial light.</p><p>Beyond the exit was a long staircase, leading through the celestial light to an unknown destination.  The end of the staircase was shrouded in darkness, invisible from their vantage point.</p><p>Ming Wei gripped the railing tightly, took a deep breath, and silently muttered, “My Grandmaster is waiting for me!”</p><p>Only the two of them remained in the pavilion.  They had no idea how many others had already proceeded to the next trial.</p><p>“This is the fourth and final trial; the Soul-Washing Liquid is here.  Do you have any estimate of how long it will take to reach the Treasure Pavilion?” Ming Wei turned to Qin Sang.</p><p>The Treasure Pavilion was their agreed meeting point.</p><p>It was also where the rewards for the final trial were given. Treasures were hidden within the Treasure Pavilion; obtaining them, and what treasures one obtained, depended entirely on one's skill and luck.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered for a moment, then shook his head helplessly.  “You're enviable, having a Yuan Ying Grandmaster's protection. I've always been a lone wolf. My understanding of this trial realm is limited; most of what I know is hearsay. I only learned about the Soul-Washing Liquid upon arriving here.  It's said the final trial is the most dangerous and vast.  While it doesn't change unpredictably like the previous three, everyone is sent to a different location, facing different challenges. I can't estimate how long it'll take to reach the Treasure Pavilion.”</p><p>“Besides the Life-Saving Talisman, my Grandmaster can’t help me much.  I’ll have to rely on my own resourcefulness,” Ming Wei mused before saying firmly, “If you arrive too late and miss the Soul-Washing Liquid's appearance, I won't wait for you.”</p><p>Qin Sang didn't take offense. “That's understandable! If I can't even reach the Treasure Pavilion, it's my lack of ability, not your fault. However, I've already helped you escape the Thousand Mountain Array.  Could you now tell me about the Soul-Washing Liquid?”</p><p>This was also part of their agreement.</p><p>Qin Sang needed to understand the Soul-Washing Liquid's emergence to properly prepare.</p><p>Before entering the trial realm, his conversation with Ning Wu Hui was very brief. Ning Wu Hui only managed to inform him of the Soul-Washing Liquid's effects and location.</p><p>Qin Sang felt that Ning Wu Hui didn't seem particularly interested in the Soul-Washing Liquid, and didn't suggest working together to obtain it.  He wasn't sure if Ning Wu Hui would participate in the competition or had another objective.</p><p>“Don't worry, after we meet at the Treasure Pavilion, I'll tell you everything I know without withholding anything,” Ming Wei remained firm.</p><p>“Be warned, don't be greedy for the treasures in the Treasure Pavilion. Taking any treasure will immediately teleport you out of the trial realm, disqualifying you from competing for the Soul-Washing Liquid.”</p><p>“I understand.”</p><p>Qin Sang didn't press further, nodded at Ming Wei, and stepped into the teleportation array.</p><p>A flash of white light, and Qin Sang disappeared.</p><p>Ming Wei waited a moment, then followed.</p><p>Shortly after their departure, subtle fluctuations appeared in the pavilion.  Moments later, four figures simultaneously materialized.</p><p>Three men and one woman, all at the late Core Formation stage.</p><p>Two of the men wore similar robes, likely from the same sect. The other man and the woman wore ordinary robes, their origins unclear.</p><p>“They’re out!”</p><p>Seeing the pavilion, the woman exclaimed joyfully, “It went so smoothly! Thanks to Brother Mei's Moonlit Treasure Mirror, it could see through the illusions, perfect for the Thousand Mountain Array! We must be among the first to pass it!”</p><p>“Maybe we're *the* first! Brother, choosing the Moonlit Treasure Mirror as your life treasure was a brilliant gamble!”</p><p>One of the robed men said proudly, deeply admiring his fellow disciple.</p><p>The man smiled modestly, “I chose the Moonlit Treasure Mirror because it suited me best. I couldn't have planned this far ahead.”</p><p>Furthermore, without the full calculations of my junior brother and two fellow cultivators, I alone couldn't have broken the formation so easily.  Disciples from major sects like the Heavenly Dao Sect undoubtedly possess similar methods; we mustn't be careless. However, the Thousand Mountain Formation was indeed an opportunity for us, buying us precious time…”</p><p>“Indeed!”</p><p>The last man agreed, “Barring unforeseen circumstances, we should reach the Hundred Treasures Pavilion before the Soul Cleansing Liquid appears, giving us a head start in obtaining it.”</p><p>The woman chuckled, “I don't share the ambition of you three cultivators.  Securing a high-quality treasure from the Hundred Treasures Pavilion would satisfy me.  It's a pity, though, that they say one can't use spiritual sense within the pavilion; getting a good artifact is purely luck.”</p><p>“Friend, don't worry. Most people are still trapped in the Thousand Mountain Formation. There won't be too many vying for treasures with you; you can take your time choosing.  Fine artifacts always have unusual qualities. If you want to be safe, choose a damaged ancient artifact; you won't be disappointed.”</p><p>The cultivator in Daoist robes, seemingly very familiar with the Hundred Treasures Pavilion, offered reassurance.</p><p>The four briefly meditated, exchanged a few more words, agreed on a meeting point, and then successively activated the teleportation array.</p><p>After they disappeared, more cultivators began appearing sporadically.</p><p>Initially few, their numbers steadily increased as time passed.</p><p>Some were weak and heavily injured, unable to participate in the final competition, too afraid to enter the inner hall. They could only rest briefly before leaving the trial grounds with regret.</p><p>Others were jubilant, apparently having made significant gains in the earlier trials, unwilling to risk further adventures, and teleported away without hesitation.</p><p>The later it got, the less hope there was of obtaining a reward from the Hundred Treasures Pavilion, let alone the Soul Cleansing Liquid.</p><p>Even some incredibly powerful cultivators, lacking the means to counter the illusionary formation, were trapped in the Thousand Mountain Formation for too long, losing their chance at the treasure and missing this opportunity.</p><p>The small pavilion saw a constant stream of people coming and going, each making their own choices.</p>
