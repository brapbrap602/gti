Chapter 220: Legendary Figure

Jiang Ying, they were talking about earlier, is a disciple of Taiyi Danzong. Rumor has it that she was introduced by a Golden Core Perfected Person from Taiyi Danzong and was able to become an apprentice of the Golden Core Perfected Person after successfully completing Ziji.
She has stunning talents, is less than 40 years old and already at the very peak of the 13th layer of Qi Refinement. Her trip to Tianjing Secret Realm is to gain experience and find an opportunity to achieve a breakthrough.
Qin Sang wanted to ask her about Youyouzi. He was very curious about Youyouzi.
Someone like this would definitely be famous, but he had never heard of Youyouzi before. It might have been because he has been so focused on cultivation and seldom makes small talk with people.
Back in the cave dwelling, Qin Sang had just finished making a zombie when he discovered that someone had triggered the cave dwelling restriction. Using his Divine Sense, he discovered that Jiang Ying was standing behind the door.
He removed the lingering chill in the cave dwelling and removed the restriction.
"You were looking for me, Senior."
Shaohua Mountain and the other two major sects were all guarding Xuanguan Pass together. At the very least, they were harmonious on the surface. It was ok for Jiang Ying to call Qin Sang "senior" or "martial uncle."
"Miss Jiang heard about it from those two guys Zhao Ji..."
Qin Sang shook his head and asked Jiang Ying to come in. "It is a small matter. I wanted to wait until Miss Jiang emerged. I hope that I did not interrupt your cultivation."
"I was in seclusion only to refine a magic tool..."
...
"The Senior is referring to Martial Uncle Youyouzi?"
After hearing Qin Sang ask about Youyouzi, Jiang Ying's expression perked up suddenly. "He is a legendary figure in our sect! I never thought that you would know him, Senior."
"Oh?"
Qin Sang briefly described how they met. "I ran into Senior Youyouzi at Changyang Market. I heard that he only started to cultivate at over a hundred years old and only became a Ziji at age 118?"
Jiang Ying nodded excitedly. She looked at Youyouzi with stars in her eyes and seemed to worship him greatly.
"They say that Martial Uncle Youyouzi was only accepted into the sect by Perfected Person Piaoya, a Perfected Person, at age 78. At that time, everyone thought that Perfected Person Piaoya was just being whimsical by recruiting Martial Uncle Youyouzi to be an alchemy servant. They did not expect that he would let Martial Uncle Youyouzi cultivate with the other disciples.
Given his age, it was impossible for Martial Uncle Youyouzi to achieve great accomplishments. Some other cultivators who were even younger than him had already given up on the path to immortality and gone home to live out their days in peace.
Some people made fun of him, but he did not seem to care. Instead, he said with a smile that he did not have big ambitions and that becoming a Nascent Soul cultivator would be enough for him.
At first, everyone was just watching and laughing at him, but he continued to cultivate just as diligently as the younger generation. He can be called a true devout cultivator. He kept a low profile, focused on his studies, and never gave up.
Not only did his cultivation level improve, but he also showed great skill in alchemy and became more and more profound in his knowledge. Everyone began to admire him.
Perfected Person Piaoya also praised Martial Uncle Youyouzi highly and is even said to have personally opened the alchemy furnace to help Martial Uncle Youyouzi slow down the rate of his Primordial Spirit's aging.
However, it was not meant to be. When Martial Uncle Youyouzi was almost ready to break through the 10th layer of Qi Refinement, Perfected Person Piaoya suddenly died.
Without Perfected Person Piaoya, no other Perfected Person masters wanted to look out for Martial Uncle Youyouzi.
According to our sect rules, Martial Uncle Youyouzi was not supposed to get the Ziji Pill, given his age. He could only obtain one by refining it himself or by taking part in the sect trial.
Martial Uncle Youyouzi did not have the spiritual plants to refine the Ziji Pill, so he could only take part in the trial.
However, the sect trial took place on the Ancient Immortal Battlefield and was very dangerous, especially for Martial Uncle Youyouzi. This was because he had always been cultivating in the mountain gate and spent his free time studying alchemy, so he knew nothing about combat techniques. Moreover, he was old and frail compared to the younger cultivators.
Martial Uncle Youyouzi decided to take part in the trial. He actually managed to get the Ziji Pill through the trial and stayed on the Ancient Immortal Battlefield for 10 years, seeking out opportunities.
After 10 years, Martial Uncle Youyouzi returned to the sect for a closed-door breakthrough and finally succeeded in cultivating into Ziji at age 118. He immediately became a legend in the sect, admired by all!"
Jiang Ying's face was filled with admiration. It was obvious that she was also a fan, so, in this world, there was also the concept of chasing stars.
Qin Sang nodded secretly. Everything that Jiang Ying said matched what he had heard from Youyouzi.
太乙丹宗不愧是以炼丹闻名天下的仙宗，筑基丹够多，弟子还能通过历练得到。在少华山，在四十岁之前突破炼气期第十层，就不要想筑基丹了。
Taiyi Danzong was indeed an immortal sect famous in the world for its alchemy. It had plenty of Ziji Pills, and its disciples could obtain them through trials. At Shaohua Mountain, you could forget about getting a Ziji Pill if you couldn't break through the 10th layer of the Qi Refinement stage before reaching 40 years old.

“He made his request regarding the information that Master Roving used to share regarding the problems he had during his progress to the Foundation Building stage and the effects it had on his later studies. Did you ever hear anything about this?”
Jiang Ying shook her head and answered, “I have heard stories about this, of course. Master Roving has reached such an old age that achieving Foundation Building is almost unheard of. If he used a secret method or consumed a spirit pill to forcefully achieve Foundation Building, there would very likely be problems. Maybe that’s why Master returned to the ancient Celestial Battlefield so quickly, almost like he was looking for something. We only know that there is a problem; Master supposedly never talked about it with anyone... When you met Master Roving, what was he like?”
Jiang Ying looked at Qin Sang expectantly, and Qin Sang had no choice but to repeat the details of their encounters.
“Master Roving had a higher cultivation than I do, and very vigorous blood. You don’t have to worry about him...”
Qin Sang asked Jiang Ying a few more questions. After seeing Jiang Ying off, he thought for a moment before recovering the two corpses and turning them into ghost puppets.
His understanding of the Heavenly Yin Corpse Technique was now almost perfect. Including these, he now had seven zombies in his corpse puppet bag, along with three ghoul corpses, which he had accumulated over the years.
He was just barely able to handle this number of corpse puppets. If he used all of the ghoul corpses at the same time, he could hold off a Foundation Building cultivator for a while, giving him time to prepare his Ten Kings of Hell Formation or talisman treasures.
However, what Qin Sang wanted most was to make a living corpse.
He had been deeply impressed by the abilities of living corpses in the Underground Grotto. They would be incredibly helpful.
He also knew that the Heavenly Corpse Sect had a way to upgrade living corpses to flying Yakshas!
Foundation Building cultivators in the Heavenly Corpse Sect would sometimes hesitate to gather the materials needed to upgrade a corpse puppet and create a flying Yaksha, fearing they would lose control of the corpse puppet and be killed, so they generally waited until they had achieved later Foundation Building before acting.
Qin Sang’s soul signature contained the energy of the Jade Buddha, so he didn’t have to worry about that problem.
As soon as Qin Sang found the second half of the Heavenly Yin Corpse Technique, he would have a puppet comparable to a cultivator at the early Golden Core stage, even though he was only at the Foundation Building stage!
However, it was still too early to say all that.
He still hadn’t had the chance to capture a Foundation Building cultivator, and Heavenly Corpse Talismans were quite difficult to craft. The main ingredient was a spirit herb called the soul-calling grass.
Qin Sang had heard from a few different sources that this soul-calling grass was quite precious, much more so than any penta-elemental negative item. It was also very rare in the current world of immortal cultivation, so finding some would require good fortune.
