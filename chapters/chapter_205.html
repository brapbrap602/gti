Chapter 198: Celestial Phenomenon

"Martial Brother Che..."

The Daoist surnamed Du nodded in greeting, glanced outside of the great hall, and said: "Martial Brother Xuanyu will bring our people over right away. The great formation has already opened, Martial Brother Che might as well go forth and pave the way."

...

Two sheer cliffs sandwiched the sides, between them was a large and flat stone valley. The bottom of the eastern cliff had been hollowed out, and a stone hall built inside it. The pitch-black interior was practically indistinguishable from the cliff walls and emanated an extremely archaic air. It was unknown how long it had existed.

At present, several Daoists clad in the robes of Shangyuan Pure Palace hurried in and out of the stone hall, their complexions tense and eyes frantic as if they were waiting for something.

Suddenly, the stone hall trembled gently. The figures paused for a moment, and a Foundation Establishment-stage cultivator cried out in a deep voice: "The teleportation is starting, quickly, stand still!"

The cultivators hurriedly lined up on either side of the great stone door, their faces full of respect. They stood quietly, their hands clasped together.

The stone hall gradually lit up with streaks of radiance. Through the light one could see that there was only one ancient teleportation array in the gigantic stone hall.

The light grew brighter and brighter, almost blinding.

Then, the light undulated for a moment, a person wearing a moon-white Daoist robe walked out from inside. His expression was relaxed and his pace even.

Gazing upon this person, the crowd respectfully standing outside all exchanged glances. To have arrived by the ancient teleportation array and acted this unabashedly was certainly the mark of an experienced Golden Core-stage cultivator, but they recognized all the Golden Core-stage seniors of their own sect and could not recall this face. Could it be a newly advanced Golden Core Daoist?

The Foundation Establishment cultivator standing at the very front was quick-witted, without any hesitation, he approached and prostrated himself: "Shangyuan Pure Palace disciple Cao You greets Senior."

The crowd quickly came to, following suit in their salutations. Anyone who was able to be teleported here, even if not a senior of one's own sect, was certain to have a friendly relationship with their sect. Addressing him as Senior would never be wrong.

Che Yutao nodded slightly, and his figure flashed into the stone valley as he awaited the arrival of the others.

Subsequently, more and more people emerged from the stone hall. Only after they beheld the robes they wore did the Shangyuan Pure Palace disciples come to a sudden realization; they were martial uncles from Shaohua Mountain.

These disciples of Shaohua Mountain presented a farcical sight after exiting the ancient teleportation array.

The Foundation Establishment cultivators were still fine, their complexions only somewhat pale and their footsteps faltering. Nevertheless, none were able to control their desire to search for a place to sit and meditate upon entering the stone valley. They thus calmed down the discomfort brought about by riding the ancient teleportation array.

The Qi Refining disciples were in a much more miserable state. Their faces were pale as paper with glazed eyes, rickety and unsteady on their feet. Those who could manage to keep their balance were already considered to be resolute in willpower.

Some could only feel their legs give out and fell 'thud' to the ground, plainly vomiting while lying there. They were clearly in extreme distress.

Qin Sang was at the very end, and his condition was far better. The jade Buddha had safeguarded his divine soul, so he hadn't been heavily impacted during the teleportation. Only his physical body had been squeezed by the spatial power, leaving him with some discomfort.

Thinking back to the scene of dizziness during the teleportation, he was also somewhat apprehensive.

This teleportation array only traversed the Small Glacier Region, but legend had it that in ancient times, there had been an ancient teleportation array that spanned the entire immortal plane. That was likely to have been even more uncomfortable.

Qin Sang briskly walked to the edge of the stone valley, found a clean corner, and circulated his technique twice. Before long, his body had regained its normal state. Only then did he raise his head towards the sky with some curiosity.

This was the Ancient Immortal Battlefield.

The ancient teleportation array of Shangyuan Pure Palace was in a hidden secret realm at the outskirts of the Ancient Immortal Battlefield. This secret realm had already been thoroughly explored, all the hazards eliminated, and the restrictions within the secret realm controlled by Shangyuan Pure Palace.

Within the Ancient Immortal Battlefield, similar secret palaces and abodes were not scarce. After many of these secret palaces and abodes were explored, the various sects would not destroy them but would rather do their utmost to control the restrictions of the secret palaces and abodes, thus claiming them for their own.

Every one of these secret realms had countless uses.

Even those secret realms that were the least useful due to the thin spiritual energy could still serve as shelters for disciples who had entered the Ancient Immortal Battlefield.

Some secret realms contained the environment of ancient immortal sects. After the various sects took control of them, they would cultivate spiritual medicine within, which would grow somewhat faster than the outside.

Not to mention that there were many abodes that originally housed the medicine gardens of ancient cultivators. The Danlong ginseng that Qin Sang consumed when breaking through to the Foundation Establishment stage had been found in one of these medicine gardens.

The cliffs on either side blocked the view.

Qin Sang was curious as to what the Ancient Immortal Battlefield looked like, and desired to fly up and witness it for himself, but upon seeing that Che Yutao was standing still beside him, he could only give up the notion.

Nevertheless, even through this one line of sky, he could sense the peculiarity of the Ancient Immortal Battlefield.

Light snow was falling on the left side of the sky, blindingly white, while on the right side, it was entirely a sandy waste.

A distinct boundary line was formed in the sky by a snowstorm and sandstorm, each pushing into each other's territory.
The collision of the two celestial bodies brought forth formidable and horrifying forces of nature; thankfully, a protective light shield would appear and disappear in the air, and it remained unyielding under the impact of the snowstorm and sandstorm, stopping them firmly in their tracks, giving people a sense of security.
Soon, both celestial bodies disappeared simultaneously. The light shield flickered and then disappeared as well.
In an instant, the snowstorm and sandstorm were gone, and the hot sun shone brightly in the clear blue sky. The heat was stifling.
This was the elusive weather of the ancient battlefield, Qin Sang secretly thought.
The cultivators of the Shangyuan Pure Monastery were used to this scene, whereas the disciples of Mount Shaohua, who were on the ancient battlefield for the first time, were awestruck.
At that moment, another group of people walked out of the stone hall; they were all freelance cultivators.
Qin Sang found that the freelance cultivators were not very accomplished, and most of them were at level 8 or 9 of the Gas Refinement stage.
Qin Sang realized that freelance cultivators were not like the disciples of Mount Shaohua, who could be given a Foundation Establishment Pill as long as they met the requirements of the sect. If they did not have enough talent, the freelance cultivators could only search for Foundation Establishment Pills or seek opportunities to change their fate against all odds; they had to start planning now.
Fortune comes with risk.
The opportunities in the Yun Cang Great Marsh were far fewer than those on the ancient battlefield. It was safe to stay in the Yun Cang Great Marsh, but it also meant that there was little hope for Foundation Establishment, and they could only resign themselves to fate.
If I still have not been able to establish a foundation, would I also come here to risk my life like these freelance cultivators?
Qin Sang secretly sighed.
The freelance cultivators were even weaker than the disciples of Mount Shaohua, and the ancient teleportation array made them feel sickly. The weaker ones looked especially terrible, they almost vomited up their hearts and lungs. A pungent smell filled the stone valley.
Che Yu Tao frowned when he saw the chaos, and he messaged the strongest disciple from the Shangyuan Pure Monastery, "When Daoist Xuan Yu gets here, tell him that I will go on ahead and not wait for him."
Then Che Yu Tao glanced at the disciples of Mount Shaohua and asked, "I am taking you to Xuan Lan Pass, any of you who wish to stay on the battlefield, stand aside."
"Master Che, we would like to stay behind..."
A few Foundation Establishment stage cultivators stepped forward; they were not here for the first time, and this time they had come with the determination to go all out. They were not here to cultivate and improve themselves, and had already decided to enter the ancient battlefield directly.
