<h1>Chapter 355: The Grand Tutor</h1><p>Aboard the airship, the two men conversed jovially, their camaraderie deepening.</p><p>Their cultivation levels were similar, and they exchanged insights on their practices, finding mutual understanding.</p><p>The airship sped through the sky, still a long way from the Han Fortress.</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't meditating; he gazed out at the scenery.</p><p>White clouds drifted lazily against a clear blue sky.</p><p>Mountains and rivers of varying shapes and countless mortal villages, starkly different from the ancient battlefield, rapidly receded from view.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Han," Qin Sang suddenly rose, apologizing, "I've just remembered an urgent matter. I'm afraid I can't return to the Han Fortress with you. I'll visit another time."</p><p>Patriarch Han was taken aback and quickly tried to dissuade him. "What urgent matter, Fellow Daoist Qin? You saved my life, and I almost repaid kindness with malice. I haven't even properly apologized. And then there's Zhen Ming..."</p><p>Qin Sang slowly shook his head.</p><p>"At Mount Guling, I merely offered a helping hand. Please don't mention saving your life again, Fellow Daoist Han.</p><p>"And that matter wasn't your fault. Guiding me to the Ghostly Mountain Market years ago, setting me on the path of cultivation, was a fortuitous opportunity.</p><p>"I truly have urgent matters. I'll visit the Han Fortress and enjoy a drink with you another day.</p><p>"As for Zhen Ming, so many years have passed. The truth is no longer important..."</p><p>Patriarch Han pondered this, then looked deeply at Qin Sang. "I understand! However, Zhen Ming acted with malicious intent, and you deserve an explanation. Rest assured, I will handle it. I will never forget your kindness, Fellow Daoist Qin. If you ever encounter trouble, just send word, and I will assist you with all my power!"</p><p>Qin Sang nodded and leaped from the airship. "Until we meet again, Fellow Daoist Han."</p><p>"Until we meet again!"</p><p>Patriarch Han bowed in farewell, then suddenly shouted, "Fellow Daoist Qin, the Great Sui has not moved its capital. The Imperial City remains in its original location."</p><p>...</p><p>Nightfall.</p><p>The Imperial City of the Great Sui was ablaze with lights.</p><p>Qin Sang stood atop a mountain north of the city, overlooking the metropolis.</p><p>He noticed the city was at least twice the size it had been when he left, with even Mount Chao Sheng now enclosed within its walls.</p><p>It was far more prosperous than before.</p><p>In just a few decades, it had transformed from a war-torn city to this.</p><p>Patriarch Han's words about the Empress's talent were not exaggerated.</p><p>Suddenly, a barely visible figure drifted towards him like a gentle breeze, clearly employing some form of movement technique. This person was not a martial artist but a cultivator.</p><p>Qin Sang turned his gaze downwards.</p><p>"Might you be Senior Qin?"</p><p>The figure landed before Qin Sang, glanced at him, and bowed hastily.</p><p>"Who are you?"</p><p>Qin Sang examined the newcomer.</p><p>He appeared to be in his forties or fifties, with a goatee like a scholar. His cultivation was not high, only at the eleventh level of Qi Refining. He wore an exceptionally luxurious brocade robe.</p><p>"Senior, I am a member of the Han family. The current Patriarch is my uncle..."</p><p>The scholar explained his background, then took out a letter and presented it to Qin Sang with both hands.</p><p>"The Patriarch instructed me to deliver this letter and inform you, Senior, of the following:</p><p>"Zhen Ming's younger brother lacked talent. Zhen Ming intended for him to join the inner sect as a guard during the recruitment two years later. Fearing his brother's place would be taken, he acted deceitfully and committed a despicable act.</p><p>"The Patriarch has dealt with the matter according to family rules.</p><p>"The culprit has been executed.</p><p>"His descendants have been stripped of their cultivation, expelled from the Han Fortress, and left to their own devices."</p><p>Qin Sang listened as he opened and read the letter.</p><p>It was a handwritten letter from Patriarch Han, filled with gratitude, apologies, and an invitation to visit the Han Fortress.</p><p>Qin Sang put the letter away and bowed to the scholar. "Thank you for your efforts. Please convey my gratitude to Patriarch Han for upholding justice. If I have time, I will certainly visit."</p><p>"As you command, Senior!"</p><p>The scholar paused, then, seeing Qin Sang had nothing else to say, tactfully withdrew.</p><p>...</p><p>The Great Sui, the Grand Tutor's residence.</p><p>Late at night, the study was still brightly lit. A white-haired old man diligently wrote at his desk, a mountain of documents piled before him.</p><p>He set down his brush, blew on the ink to dry it, folded the paper, and placed it in an envelope.</p><p>Suddenly, he frowned and coughed violently, covering his mouth to muffle the sound so no one outside would hear. It took him a while to recover.</p><p>"Ah! Time is unforgiving!"</p><p>He gently rubbed his lower back, leaned back in his chair, closed his eyes, and softly said, "Zhi Niang, replace these candles and bring me a cup of invigorating tea..."</p><p>'Creak!'</p><p>An elderly woman entered with tea, her eyes scanning the old man's face. She saw through his facade and said with concern, "Coughing again? I told you to ask the Emperor for some medicinal pills, but you refuse! You can't keep pushing yourself like this! You said the Emperor is growing weary of you and you wish to retire. Why do you still bother with so many matters?"</p><p>The old man sipped his tea, his complexion improving slightly. He patted the woman's hand and said wistfully, "I can only retire after I fulfill the late Emperor's entrustment and inform his spirit of my completion. The foundation that the late Emperor and our colleagues painstakingly built must not fall into ruin. We must endure the Emperor's impatience for a few more years. Once this matter is concluded, we'll return to your hometown and live in seclusion, unconcerned with worldly affairs. The rise or fall of the Great Sui will have nothing to do with me anymore."</p><p>"Why return to Mount Guling?"</p><p>The woman massaged his shoulders. "My childhood memories are filled with hardship. When your army attacked, I was captured and nearly... You saved me, and I finally had a peaceful life. Wherever you are is my home. Wait, wasn't your father buried at Emerald Bright Mountain?  Why not go there? The scenery is quite nice..."</p><p>She glanced at the back of the study.</p><p>Strangely, there was only one spirit tablet for the Wu family, not in the ancestral hall but in the study.</p><p>Even stranger, the tablet read "Wu the Mute," which didn't sound like a name.</p><p>Beside the tablet was a scroll, untouched for years.  She had only seen her husband bow before it, never burn incense for it.</p><p>In all their years of marriage, her husband had never mentioned this person's identity.</p><p>Their children, ordered to bow to the portrait, had asked about it out of curiosity, but her husband only said it was his teacher.  When they asked why they only bowed and didn't burn incense, he'd say his teacher was blessed with great fortune and would surely live forever.</p><p>...</p><p>This old man was Wu Chuanzong, the beggar of the past, now the Grand Tutor.</p><p>Hearing his wife mention Emerald Bright Mountain, Wu Chuanzong immediately thought of his old friend, lost in thought. He murmured, "I wonder where my teacher is now? Has he achieved immortality?"</p>
