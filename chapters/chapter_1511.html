<h1>Chapter 1502: Eight-Character Admonition (4k)</h1><p>The *Sacrificial Yuan Technique* wasn't created by Yin Changsheng; it's a legacy recorded within the Xuan Tian Ling.</p><p>Yin Changsheng monopolized the secret technique, not passing it on to Tong Lingyu and the others.  Possessing the four powerful spirit treasures, the Serpent Seal and the pseudo-spirit treasure, the Hanging Sword Tower, allowed Yin Changsheng to easily capture them and refine them into blood servants.</p><p>Qin Sang felt the *Sacrificial Yuan Technique* was extremely complex and profound, aligning with the Dao; it wasn't the work of a contemporary cultivator.</p><p>The difference in power between magical treasures and spirit treasures is vast, almost incomparable.</p><p>This secret technique serves to bridge this gap, filling a crucial link in cultivation.</p><p>From this perspective, a sense of grandeur arises, leaving one wondering which powerful figure created it.</p><p>Perhaps, in ancient times, the *Sacrificial Yuan Technique* wasn't so mysterious.</p><p>Or perhaps, other similar techniques existed, not necessarily requiring a natal magical treasure, allowing for the refinement of pseudo-spirit treasures using ordinary magical treasures.</p><p>What a magnificent world that must have been!</p><p>The artifacts excavated from the Ancient Immortal Battlefield in the Beichen Region are merely a fraction of what existed.</p><p>Qin Sang sighed, his heart yearning for that time.</p><p>He silently memorized the *Sacrificial Yuan Technique* and handed the Xuan Tian Ling to Liuli.</p><p>Whether this technique could accelerate the Yunyou Sword's cultivation of sentience, Qin Sang wasn't sure; they had to try to find out. Cultivating the *Sacrificial Yuan Technique* was extremely difficult; while his spiritual sense met the requirements, his cultivation base was still too weak.</p><p>Liuli was also awakened by the tribulation thunder.</p><p>Her expression had calmed down, reverting to her usual cold demeanor. However, nobody knew the extent of this unexpected event's impact on her.</p><p>‘Rumble!’</p><p>The tribulation thunder, like a turquoise waterfall, poured down from the tribulation cloud.</p><p>The mere scattered remnants of the tribulation thunder caused the edges of the celestial pit to continuously collapse.</p><p>The terrifying scene of the earth shattering and mountains collapsing was vividly displayed before them.</p><p>Yin Changsheng's figure completely vanished.</p><p>With such terrifying tribulation thunder, he couldn't possibly have survived.</p><p>The tribulation cloud didn't continue to condense, showing signs of dissipation, further confirming this. The once formidable Yin Changsheng of the North Sea had completely fallen!</p><p>Even in his final moments, the scene was incredibly shocking.</p><p>Tong Lingyu was lost in thought.</p><p>Her feelings towards Yin Changsheng were complex—a mixture of respect, hatred, and pity.</p><p>Then,</p><p>Tong Lingyu suddenly remembered something and turned to Qin Sang, "Qin Daoist, do you still remember the eight-character admonition left by Senior Xiao Xiangzi that I mentioned before?"</p><p>Qin Sang nodded; he had always remembered this.</p><p>After a moment of silence, Tong Lingyu turned her head, staring intently at the spot where Yin Changsheng disappeared, her tone melancholic.</p><p>"The admonition was: After achieving the Transcendence stage, one will know their destination!"</p><p>Transcendence!</p><p>After achieving the Transcendence stage, one will know their destination!</p><p>Qin Sang's heart shuddered; a huge wave of questions surged within him.</p><p>What is this destination?</p><p>Does it refer to ascension, somewhere beyond the Storm Belt, or simply the mysterious Central State?</p><p>Qin Sang had witnessed the 'ascension' spectacle firsthand, inevitably prompting this line of thought.</p><p>Why would one automatically know after reaching the Transcendence stage?</p><p>Could the improvement in realm lead to a mysterious transformation, allowing Transcendence stage cultivators a deeper understanding of the Dao, reaching a higher level, and gaining enlightenment on the Dao's rules?</p><p>Knowing the destination, how does one reach it?</p><p>Is the Storm Belt not boundless, allowing Transcendence stage cultivators to freely traverse the storms and easily leave?</p><p>Or, could Transcendence stage cultivators ascend directly without an ascension platform?</p><p>If that's the case, the Jade Bone Demon's previous cultivation base must have been unimaginable; recovering to the Transcendence stage should have been easier for him compared to contemporary cultivators. Why then did he insist on ascending the ascension platform during Ziwei Palace's ascension?</p><p>Why didn't the Ghost Mother cultivate in seclusion to restore her cultivation, instead choosing to travel everywhere, searching for Witch Clan bloodlines?</p><p>Qin Sang felt something wasn't right.</p><p>"Daoist, you don't have to look at me," Tong Lingyu chuckled wryly, "Senior Xiao Xiangzi only left this one admonition, without explanation, leaving endless possibilities for future generations to ponder."</p><p>At this point, Tong Lingyu truly had no need to hide anything.</p><p>Qin Sang frowned, remaining silent.</p><p>To be able to say such words, Xiao Xiangzi was undoubtedly a Transcendence stage cultivator; the eight-character admonition reflected his own insights.</p><p>If so, other Transcendence stage cultivators should be no exception.</p><p>The other Transcendence stage cultivators Qin Sang knew came from the Four Sacred Palaces of the Canglang Sea. The Four Sacred Palaces had complete inheritance; he had formed good relations with them, and they shouldn't be stingy with their knowledge.</p><p>Unfortunately, that path was now cut off.</p><p>"Were there any other Transcendence stage seniors from the North Sea?"</p><p>Qin Sang asked.</p><p>Tong Lingyu said, "None after Senior Xiao Xiangzi, but it's possible that some seniors lived secluded lives and never showed themselves to others. If a 'destination' exists, they must have left silently."</p><p>Long ago, before even the oldest legends, the North Sea was vastly different from what it is now, its past unrecoverable.”</p><p>Living off the land, untouched by worldly affairs, achieving immortality and then ascending to become a celestial being – this is what mortals imagine immortals to be.</p><p>Qin Sang reflected on the various sects of the Northern Star Realm.</p><p>The Northern Star Realm is small but constantly embroiled in conflict, its intensity no less than that of the North Sea.  The rise and fall of cultivation sects is a constant cycle.  Of those he knew, the Upper Yuan Quiet Palace boasted the longest history.</p><p>The new Palace Master of the Upper Yuan Quiet Palace chose to align with the Green Sheep Temple. Qin Sang had perused the Palace’s archives and found no records of Nascent Soul cultivators.</p><p>Regardless, this was good news.</p><p>It signified that there might be a path beyond the Nascent Soul stage!</p><p>At least, a glimmer of hope to escape this confinement.</p><p>Xiao Xiangzi offered no further explanation. Such explanations are meaningless to those below the Nascent Soul stage.  Only upon reaching the Nascent Soul stage does one qualify to compete for the Dao!</p><p>Understanding this, Qin Sang’s spirits soared!</p><p>The higher the cultivation realm of contemporary cultivators, the greater their confusion.</p><p>When ascension becomes a legend, when trapped by endless storms, with the path ahead cut off, even the most powerful cultivators have no way out.  Longevity becomes an illusion, so what is the point of arduous cultivation?</p><p>Qin Sang had also questioned this, but he forced himself not to dwell on it, remaining steadfast on his path, advancing step by step towards his goal!</p><p>The Ascension Platform.</p><p>Nascent Soul.</p><p>Now, he knows of two paths!</p><p>Qin Sang felt boundless determination and abruptly lifted his head, just as the tribulation clouds dissipated, revealing a clear sky.</p><p>A dazzling green light emanated from the sky pit, like boundless waves. The power of the tribulation thunder had not yet subsided, countless threads of lightning still coursing within.</p><p>Using his Celestial Eye ability, Qin Sang vaguely saw the scene within the sky pit.</p><p>The sky pit was unrecognizable, Yin Changsheng’s body nowhere to be found.</p><p>At that moment, Qin Sang saw a reflection at the edge of the sky pit. With a slight gasp, he leaped down, activating his Ruyi Treasure Orb's protective barrier and charging into the lightning.</p><p>It was a broken coffin.</p><p>The very ice coffin Yin Changsheng had lain in.</p><p>The ice coffin was severely damaged, split in two, with numerous fragments, yet it had not been completely annihilated by the tribulation thunder.</p><p>“Yin Changsheng had been lying in this coffin; it must be a rare treasure.  Despite the severe damage, I wonder if it can be repaired.”</p><p>Qin Sang rubbed his chin, and without hesitation, collected the remains of the coffin, carefully gathering all the fragments.</p><p>A chill ran through his hand as he touched it.</p><p>Without further inspection, Qin Sang quickly put them away, then searched the underground cavern but found nothing else.</p><p>The tribulation thunder was too fierce!</p><p>Qin Sang sighed, flew out of the sky pit, and saw Tong Lingyu’s complexion had regained some color; her external wounds were healed.  The restrictions within her body were mostly lifted, and after taking healing pills to forcibly suppress her injuries, her strength had returned to about 60%.</p><p>“Daoist Qin, Palace Master Jiang and the others are still battling Shang Lu and the others outside the fog.  Let us quickly recover our strength. I implore you to lend me your aid once more to purge our ranks!”</p><p>Tong Lingyu’s face was filled with killing intent.</p><p>Yin Changsheng left behind the Xuan Tian Order. Considering his final actions, perhaps the descendants of the Yin family can be spared, but Shang Lu and Palace Master Yin must be eliminated.</p><p>It’s not just that these people sided with Yin Changsheng and ambushed her.</p><p>What fueled Tong Lingyu’s murderous intent was the Blood Pool of Slaughter.</p><p>The blood in the pool came mostly from fellow sect members.</p><p>For years, they had, under Yin Changsheng’s orders, slaughtered countless fellow disciples.</p><p>As a Palace Master and the head of the main sect, they had far too much power. If they hadn't abetted Yin Changsheng, he couldn't have remained so undetected.</p><p>Whether they acted out of their own volition or were manipulated by Yin Changsheng, their crimes are unforgivable.</p><p>No sect can tolerate such people.</p><p>Pausing, Tong Lingyu glanced at Liuli and said to Qin Sang, “I will tell them that Yin Changsheng attempted a Nascent Soul breakthrough, failed the tribulation, and the four-tiered [name of serpent seal] was destroyed in the tribulation!  Upon our return, I may need Daoist Qin’s help again.”</p><p>She was now extremely wary of Qin Sang, and had not inquired about the whereabouts of the four-tiered [name of serpent seal] from beginning to end.</p><p>Surviving was fortunate enough; she dared not hope to reclaim the spiritual treasure.</p><p>Moreover, with the *Sacrifice Origin Technique*, as long as the Xuan Tian Palace continues to have great cultivators, it will not lack pseudo-spiritual treasures, enough to replace the true ones.</p><p>Yin Changsheng perished, only managing to send out the Xuan Tian Order before his death. The lower half of the *Treasures’ Record* remains a mystery, its power forever unable to reach its peak.</p><p>Unless Qin Sang hands over the treasure to Liuli, allowing it to recognize a new master.</p><p>Then it would just return to the Xuan Tian Palace, wouldn't it?</p><p>Tong Lingyu's calculations were astute.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered for a moment, then nodded, “Good!”</p><p>Helping Tong Lingyu with the aftermath was something he had already decided.</p><p>After leaving the sacred ground, the cleanup of the remaining forces in Xuan Tian Palace presented a low-risk, high-reward opportunity for treasure acquisition, which Qin Sang readily joined.</p><p>Tong Lingyu breathed a sigh of relief and immediately closed her eyes to regulate her breath, breaking the last few restrictions.</p><p>Qin Sang and his avatar shared the remaining Fei Xue Pills.</p><p>Unlike their arrival in the North Sea, where he was unable to cultivate in the storm zone and had to continuously absorb spiritual energy from spirit stones, consuming many pills, causing impurities to build up in his body, requiring purification. Now, having only taken a few pills, the impact was minimal.</p><p>Once Qin Sang's true energy recovered to about 80%, Tong Lingyu stood up.</p><p>"Not helping Daoist friend Luo Yun with the unsealing?"</p><p>Qin Sang curiously asked.</p><p>Tong Lingyu shook her head, staring intently at the ice sculpture for a moment, then softly said, "Senior Brother Luo was sealed by Yin Changsheng's evil magic for too long and severely injured in the blood pool. He needs to be brought back to Xuan Tian Palace and placed in the Frozen Spring for a period of recuperation. Otherwise, even if he could be awakened now, it would damage his foundation and cause a drop in his cultivation level."</p><p>Leaving Luo Yun behind, the three entered the ancient barrier and moved through the black mist.</p><p>Qin Sang lagged behind, returning the eight-winged cicada slough to Liuli and telepathically asked, "Can you still use the Ice Soul Divine Light?"</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>Liuli replied affirmatively, her tone unwavering.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered this, asking no further questions.</p><p>Tong Lingyu didn't turn around, seemingly unaware of their exchange.</p><p>The ancient barrier within the black mist was exceptionally complex, but with Yin Changsheng dead and no one controlling it, and Tong Lingyu having been captured and knowing the way, along with Qin Sang's assistance, the three quickly found a way out.</p><p>By this time, the external conflict had ceased.</p><p>Everyone's expressions varied as they stared into the depths of the black mist.</p><p>The dissipation of the tribulation cloud seemed unusual.</p><p>But, firstly, the ancient barrier obstructed a clear view, and secondly, none had witnessed a Nascent Soul tribulation; thus, no one dared to make a judgment, resulting in a strange stalemate.</p><p>Seeing the figures outside the ancient barrier, the three stopped.</p><p>Qin Sang noticed someone, his eyes showing a strange expression, and asked, "Is the person surnamed Yue to be killed as well?"</p><p>The cultivator surnamed Yue possessed neither Corpse Flower Blood Jasper nor Nascent Soul puppet, yet he broke through to the mid-Nascent Soul stage in just over a hundred years; a true genius.</p><p>Yin Changsheng needed Qin Sang to come into contact with the slough to achieve his goal.</p><p>The cultivator surnamed Yue appearing at the Cleansing Pool, unless it was an act, most likely meant he was not the mastermind.</p><p>However, he was cultivated by Shang Lu, the two being teacher and friend, later participating in the siege against Tong Lingyu.</p><p>Killing Shang Lu and leaving this person alive would leave a potential great enemy.</p><p>It was his unfortunate choice of sides that was to blame.</p><p>Tong Lingyu took a deep breath and said decisively, "Though a fragrant orchid may block the path, I will eliminate it!"</p><p>Qin Sang nodded.</p><p>Outside the black mist.</p><p>"Why is there still no news from the Palace Master? Could it be...?"</p><p>Shang Lu and Yin Dianzhu exchanged a glance, feeling inexplicably uneasy.</p><p>However, having both experienced breakthroughs, they knew that post-breakthrough required quiet cultivation to consolidate their cultivation base.</p><p>Moreover, regardless of the Palace Master's success or failure, Tong Lingyu was doomed, with no chance of turning the tables, so they suppressed their anxiety and waited for the results.</p><p>Just then.</p><p>Unnoticed by them, a flash of joy crossed Jiang Dianzhu's eyes, and he suddenly attacked.</p><p>Jiang Dianzhu's magic treasure was an ice jade cauldron.</p><p>The ice jade cauldron, reduced to the size of a palm, hung upside down above Jiang Dianzhu and others, its mouth pouring out a faint cold light, forming a strong barrier, used solely for defense.</p><p>Now, the ice jade cauldron suddenly reversed, instantly transforming into a giant cauldron, slamming down on Shang Lu.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The giant cauldron's momentum was astonishing.</p><p>Jiang Dianzhu, also at the mid-Nascent Soul stage, unleashed his full power, creating tremendous pressure immediately.</p><p>Simultaneously, Elder Mei stomped his foot, a fan-shaped path of glacial ice spreading rapidly, targeting Shang Lu and the others, who possessed the highest cultivation.</p><p>Others also attacked without reservation, seeming to make a desperate gamble.</p><p>Seeing this, Shang Lu flew into a rage, "You old scoundrel, you remain obstinate!"</p><p>Before he finished speaking, Shang Lu summoned his magic treasure, a jade ruler, unleashing his full power.</p><p>The jade surface instantly transformed into the shape of a mountain range, weighing a thousand jun, its momentum not inferior to the giant cauldron, the treasure being extremely hard and unafraid of collision.</p><p>However, Shang Lu clearly prioritized self-preservation, unwilling to fight them to the death.</p><p>Jiang Dianzhu and the others could escape if they chose to.</p><p>But in the vast North Sea, where could they flee?</p><p>Once the Palace Master emerged from the sacred ground, the situation would be under control; then would be the death of these traitors!</p><p>Fighting to the death with these desperados, and even a momentary lapse of attention could lead to unforeseen consequences and cause immeasurable regret.</p><p>Yin Dianzhu and the others shared similar thoughts, while resisting, they also dodged, clearing their escape route.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Jiang Dianzhu and the others showed no intention of fleeing, instead launching a frenzied attack.</p><p>Seeing their strange actions, Shang Lu suddenly had a bad premonition.</p><p>The next moment, Shang Lu felt a sudden chill at the back of his head, his eyes widening in terror.</p>
