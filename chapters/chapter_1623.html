<h1>Chapter 1614: Hidden Moon Convent</h1><p>Tenglong Cliff.</p><p>The ritual altar and the five Phase Tokens radiated brilliant light.</p><p>‘Bang! Bang! Bang!’</p><p>The Phase Tokens were unstable, giving the illusion that they might be flung away at any moment.  The altar itself trembled ceaselessly. While the tremors seemed small, they carried a startling force.</p><p>The five individuals rotated with the altar, their palms pressed against its edge, enduring the immense vibrations transmitted from it, not daring to move an inch.  Despite possessing cultivation at the pinnacle of the current era, they began to falter under the continuous backlash from the altar, facing the risk of losing their grip or even being injured.</p><p>At this point, the differences in their inheritances became apparent.</p><p>Su Zinan and the Swordsman weren't disciples of the Formless Immortal Sect.</p><p>A blood talisman spontaneously flew out of Su Zinan's mustard seed bag, exploding with a ‘bang’ and releasing a blood shadow. The shadow's features were distorted, emitting a painful shriek that unsettled the minds of those who heard it. It was clearly a malevolent object.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The blood shadow turned and lunged at Su Zinan.</p><p>Su Zinan didn't dodge or flinch, merging with the blood shadow.  A flush of crimson swept across his face, then receded, his aura surging as the tremors in his arms lessened considerably, his grip on the altar firm.</p><p>The Swordsman lowered his head slightly, silently invoking a blade art.</p><p>The heavy sword on his back quivered, its hum resonating like a dragon's roar as it abruptly left its scabbard.</p><p>‘Weng!’</p><p>The long sword hung in the air.</p><p>Yet, what erupted was saber energy, soaring skyward!</p><p>The sword itself was invisible, replaced by a dazzling saber light, like a crescent moon, flashing towards the space between the Swordsman's hands.  The sword tip silently pressed against the altar, sharing the burden of the backlash with its master.</p><p>The remaining three, to varying degrees, had connections to the Formless Immortal Sect.</p><p>The White-Robed Man's robes billowed.  They weren't pure white, as it turned out, but adorned with intricate patterns that now became visible. Within the robes, it seemed as if a small world of swirling snow existed.  Streams of visible, pale, cold wind surged out, swirling around the White-Robed Man, gathering in intensity.</p><p>The cold air accumulated behind him, gradually transforming into an ice mirror. The mirror hovered behind the White-Robed Man's head, its surface facing the altar, shimmering with cold light.</p><p>The Grotesque-Faced Man trembled his shoulders slightly.  Starting from his shoulders, his arms lignified, becoming two sections of withered wood, his fingers dry and gnarled like branches, tightly gripping the altar, ensuring he wouldn't lose his hold.</p><p>Zhu Wudao was the mastermind, but Su Zinan had yet to witness him take action.  Through the light of the Phase Tokens, he discreetly observed Zhu Wudao.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the man merely transformed his eyes into a pale gold, his gaze solidifying as it focused on the altar.  He made no other movements.  Without any visible display of demonic arts, he stabilized his position, appearing the most at ease of the five.</p><p>Working together, the five stabilized the altar and then, as if prearranged, looked upwards.</p><p>Five colored beams of light shot out from the Phase Tokens.  In the center of these beams, a white light, now much larger than before, formed a sphere the size of a human head, pulsating with increasingly intense, strange fluctuations.</p><p>These fluctuations were the source of the tremors.</p><p>Waves of light churned within the sphere, each surge bringing a powerful tremor.  This tremor affected not only the altar but the entire space, shaking the earth, causing the peaks of the Taiyue Sect to sway and rocks to tumble down.</p><p>On the main peak.</p><p>Both sides had ceased fighting, their attention drawn to the six pillars of light soaring into the sky.</p><p>Gold, cyan, blue, crimson, yellow!</p><p>The five colored pillars were almost identical in size, encircling the white pillar. Initially, the white pillar was smaller, but as the tremors intensified, it grew brighter, threatening to surpass the others.</p><p>Under the influence of the tremors, the main peak swayed the most. Lower-ranking disciples had to circulate their cultivation techniques just to remain standing, their faces etched with awe.</p><p>“Over there!”</p><p>“What is that?”</p><p>Someone shouted, pointing at the sphere of light.</p><p>Hua Chenzi rebuked, “Focus on regulating your breathing!”</p><p>The disciples sobered, remembering their predicament.  Survival was paramount.  The invaders continued their assault, and they were exhausted.  Quickly dismissing their distractions, they began to conserve their strength.</p><p>The pillars of light pierced the black canopy of the sky.  Within the canopy, dark clouds converged, locking onto the pillars.  Otherwise, the phenomenon would be visible for hundreds of miles, and news of the Formless Immortal Sect's reemergence would spread with alarming speed, alerting various factions prematurely.</p><p>Several hours later, the five colored pillars stabilized, leaving only the white pillar to continue expanding. The sphere gradually swelled, its interior resembling a deep passage.  Within this passage, chaos reigned, with multicolored rays of light twisting into a tangled mess, brimming with primordial power.</p><p>‘Boom! Boom! Boom!’</p><p>These rays, of unknown origin, collided and exploded incessantly.  The power of the spirit formations and restrictions raged to an extreme, even interspersed with spatial turbulence.</p><p>Su Zinan and the others, mere inches from the sphere, observed the scene within, their expressions grave. If they were to be drawn in at this moment, even they couldn't guarantee their safe return.</p><p>“Must we enter the Formless Immortal Sect through this?”</p><p>Su Zinan's brow furrowed, sensing the danger.</p><p>“The upheaval that year came suddenly. My sect's ancestors were unprepared and forcibly sealed the Formless Immortal Sect, causing spatial distortions and unleashing this chaos. We have no other choice but to force our way through. But do not worry, everyone. Once the passage stabilizes and the Immortal Abode emerges, there will be room to maneuver.”</p><p>Zhu Wudao spoke while looking skyward, confirming that the phenomenon was contained by the Sky-Shrouding Profound Formation, nodding in satisfaction.  Although the phenomenon was concealed, the fluctuations caused by the Formless Immortal Sect's emergence intensified, and the Sky-Shrouding Profound Formation gradually weakened, the tremors reaching beyond the Taiyue Sect.</p><p>Some time after the passage opened.</p><p>On a distant mountain.</p><p>Qin Sang, sensing the fluctuations, awoke from his meditative state.</p><p>“Finally!”</p><p>He waved his sleeve, retrieving the Sun God Tree, and rushed out of his cave, concealing his presence, stopping a distance away from the Taiyue Sect.</p><p>From this vantage point.</p><p>The Taiyue Sect appeared normal.</p><p>But Qin Sang was certain this was a facade.  A drastic change had occurred within!</p><p>“Sealing off an entire top-tier sect, what a grand undertaking!”</p><p>Qin Sang murmured to himself.  Worried about countermeasures against detection, he didn't send out his Sky-Eye Butterfly, choosing to observe the situation unfold.</p><p>Concealed in the shadows, he searched the surrounding area, but found no trace of Purple Lightning True Person. He wasn't sure if Ghost Mother's judgment was correct, but caution was always warranted.</p><p>Two days later.</p><p>The sphere was gone.</p><p>During these two days, the sphere had slowly risen, the power within the passage manifesting externally, creating a spatial vortex above the Taiyue Sect.</p><p>The vortex had expanded to cover nearly half of the Taiyue Sect, its terrifying power threatening to destroy everything, exuding a palpable, dreadful pressure.</p><p>At this moment.</p><p>‘Rumble!’</p><p>A deafening thunderclap shook the heavens and earth.</p><p>Everyone looked up in shock as the passage made contact with the black canopy, the edges of the turbulence finally colliding with the Sky-Shrouding Profound Formation.</p><p>Instantly.</p><p>Turbulence filled the sky as the black canopy ripped apart.</p><p>The collision of various forces created a storm, engulfing the entire Taiyue Sect. Trees were uprooted, halls collapsed, the earth quaked, and the main peak of the Taiyue Sect seemed on the verge of collapsing, the scene one of utter devastation.</p><p>Finally, the black canopy shattered completely!</p><p>At this moment, Zhu Wudao could no longer conceal the phenomenon.  A strange light shot into the heavens, spatial fluctuations exploding outwards, and the celestial phenomena shifted dramatically.</p><p>However, this was all within Zhu Wudao's expectations.</p><p>Everything was proceeding according to his plan.  The top experts of the various sects in the Central Plains had gathered in Jinyu Province.  Even if they received the news, they wouldn't arrive in time to stop them.</p><p>The vortex expanded at an accelerating pace.</p><p>Through the vortex and the passage, fleeting mirage-like images occasionally appeared – a section of a mountain range, a pavilion, a stretch of forest – clearly projections from within the Formless Immortal Sect.</p><p>This was proof enough that the Formless Immortal Sect hadn't been destroyed, but preserved intact!</p><p>Just then, a sudden change occurred.</p><p>The altar began to shake violently, and the five struggled to maintain their hold, especially on the two replica Phase Tokens, which clattered, threatening to crumble.</p><p>A mishap at this stage could ruin everything.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>Zhu Wudao's expression changed drastically, and he let out a long howl.</p><p>With the phenomenon revealed, there was no need to conceal the Taiyue Sect any longer.</p><p>Mo Xingdao and the others, hearing the howl, immediately withdrew their forces and rushed over, surrounding the altar, each displaying their divine abilities.</p><p>…</p><p>Northern foothills of Taiyue Mountain.</p><p>Yue Lingtian returned, descending into the valley to rejoin Purple Lightning True Person.</p><p>The group hid there, gazing at the sky.</p><p>Purple Lightning True Person searched for traces of Zhu Wudao and the others.</p><p>…</p><p>West of the mountain gate.</p><p>Qin Sang stood beneath a tree, having waited patiently for a long time.  Gazing intently at the celestial phenomena, his brow flickered as he summoned his External Avatar.</p><p>…</p><p>Southeast of the Taiyue Sect, in a desolate mountain range not far from Taiyue Mountain.</p><p>A figure, shrouded in a strange mist, drifted through the forest, its speed fluctuating, seemingly searching for something.</p><p>As the phenomenon appeared.</p><p>The figure stopped abruptly and looked up sharply, revealing a pale face. It was Elder Fan, the Great Elder of the Skyhawk Tower.</p><p>This man had a pale, beardless face, devoid of any color, and his aura was chilling.  He was first surprised, then, recalling something, became both shocked and delighted.  “Old Ghost Zhu, I wondered why your Quyang Mountain lineage has been so secretive. It turns out you are remnants of the Formless Immortal Sect!  Fortunately, this old man followed you here; otherwise, I would have missed a tremendous opportunity!”</p><p>He let out a sinister chuckle and vanished in a flash.</p><p>…</p><p>Further away.</p><p>In a market town.</p><p>Low-ranking cultivators, not daring to embark on a long journey to attend the Dharma Assembly, had gathered in the market town to organize a small-scale Dao Discussion Assembly. Some even offered prizes, and the participants were all disciples of nearby small sects.</p><p>Two individuals were engaged in a duel on the stage, capturing the attention of the crowd.</p><p>Suddenly, commotion erupted outside, and several people who went out didn't return.</p><p>Exclamations continued, and others, unable to contain their curiosity, rushed out of the venue, even the two dueling on stage couldn't resist.</p><p>The streets were packed with people, all staring in astonishment towards the Taiyue Sect.</p><p>“That… seems to be Taiyue Mountain.”</p><p>“What happened at the Taiyue Sect?”</p><p>“Impossible, who would be so bold as to attack the Taiyue Sect? It looks like a treasure has appeared, let's go!”</p><p>As this person moved, he was grabbed by his companion. “A treasure of the Taiyue Sect, and you dare to snatch it? Are you tired of living?”</p><p>“What's there to be afraid of!”  This person pulled his companion back.  “With such a conspicuous celestial phenomenon, we're certainly not the only ones who've seen it. As the saying goes, a crime shared is a crime lessened.  The Taiyue Sect gets to eat the meat, can't we have some soup?  Let's go check it out!”</p><p>His companion's heart stirred at these words.</p><p>Soon, figures flew out of the market town, their flying artifacts carrying them towards Taiyue Mountain.</p><p>Similar scenes played out in various locations near the Taiyue Sect.</p><p>…</p><p>South of Taiyue Mountain.</p><p>The Poison King and Master Huaiyin were searching for the Grotesque-Faced Man in the wilderness.</p><p>They were joined by another person, Elder Ming of the Myriad Poison Mountain.</p><p>While the Poison King and Master Huaiyin tracked the Grotesque-Faced Man, Elder Ming led the Myriad Poison Mountain experts in searching for any traces, preventing any oversight.</p><p>As they traveled.</p><p>The Poison King and Master Huaiyin suddenly stopped, as if sensing something, their expressions changing. Exchanging a glance, their speed abruptly surged, their figures flashing like lightning.</p><p>Elder Ming, bewildered, quickly followed, but could only see their backs.</p><p>After a brief pursuit.</p><p>Elder Ming finally caught up with them atop a mountain peak, also witnessing the intensifying celestial phenomenon in the sky.</p><p>“What is that?”</p><p>Elder Ming was stunned. “It seems to be coming from the Taiyue Sect.”</p><p>Master Huaiyin glanced sideways at the Poison King.</p><p>He came from the Western Regions and knew little about the Central Plains, unsure what this phenomenon signified.</p><p>The Poison King remained silent, pondering for a moment.</p><p>“Southern Border, Immortal Abode…”</p><p>The Poison King suddenly realized, “The Formless Immortal Sect! No wonder that scoundrel lingered in the Southern Province, and the Nascent Soul cultivator disappeared.  As expected, some villains chose to stir up trouble during the Dharma Assembly!”</p><p>“The Formless Immortal Sect?” Master Huaiyin asked in confusion.</p><p>The Poison King briefly explained the circumstances to him.</p><p>Master Huaiyin nodded and was about to head over when the Poison King stopped him.</p><p>After a moment of thought, the Poison King turned and said, “They dared to act now, and moreover, within Taiyue Mountain.  Their forces are likely considerable. If their cultivation is similar to that scoundrel's, we alone might not be able to influence the situation.  The Daoist and Buddhist sects understand the Formless Immortal Sect the best. Elder Ming, return to the sect quickly and send a message to the Sweet Dew Zen Monastery.  Have them contact Master Xingji immediately and inquire about the reason!”</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>Elder Ming accepted the order and departed.</p><p>The Poison King and Master Huaiyin made their way into Taiyue Mountain.</p><p>…</p><p>Somewhere at the border between the Savage Province and the Southern Province.</p><p>The environment here was vastly different from the Southern Border, devoid of poisonous miasma for hundreds of miles.</p><p>The mountains were beautiful.</p><p>The morning mist flowed through the forest, and the sounds of birds filled the tranquil mountains, surpassing even the Central Plains in beauty.</p><p>Hidden deep within the mountains was an ancient temple, named Hidden Moon Convent.</p><p>Scattered throughout the forest were only a few small temples, embodying tranquility and blending seamlessly with nature.</p><p>The Hidden Moon Convent was only slightly larger than the Eight Scenery Temple.</p><p>Leaves fell within the convent.</p><p>Several nuns swept the fallen leaves with brooms, everything appearing like an ordinary temple in the mortal world.</p><p>In their hands, the brooms seemed weightless, each sweep natural and fluid, imbued with a sense of serenity, clearly a form of cultivation in itself.</p><p>Inside a quiet chamber.</p><p>An old nun sat in meditation, fingering prayer beads, with sandalwood incense burning before her.</p><p>Suddenly, a young nun rushed in, flustered.</p><p>“What is the cause of this commotion?”</p><p>The old nun asked softly.</p><p>The old nun's voice seemed to possess a certain power, calming the young nun. She bowed and said, “Reporting to Master, a pagoda in the Pagoda Forest suddenly began to glow.”</p><p>The old nun paused, then rose and walked out of the chamber, heading towards the Pagoda Forest.</p><p>“Master, it's over there.”</p><p>The young nun pointed to a pagoda in the center of the Pagoda Forest, indeed emitting light.</p><p>This pagoda's design was completely different from the others.</p><p>Seeing this, a ripple of emotion finally crossed the old nun's face.  She appeared in front of the pagoda in a flash.</p><p>The old nun raised her hand and gently touched the pagoda, the surprise in her eyes deepening. She murmured, "The Formless Immortal Sect…"</p><p>“Master, why is this happening?  What is the Formless Immortal Sect?” The young nun asked cautiously. She had guarded the Pagoda Forest for many years and had never witnessed such a strange event.</p><p>Buddhist light shone from the old nun's palm, merging with the light emanating from the pagoda.</p><p>Then, her hand reached into the pagoda, as if grasping something.</p><p>After sensing for a moment, the old nun didn't answer, instead instructing, “Go and summon your Martial Aunt and the others from their seclusion.  Yes, including your Martial Aunt Liu Li.”</p><p>“Yes!”</p>
