<h1></h1><p>Provided they aren't met with backlash, the relationship between a cultivator and their Natal Insect Gu is far closer than with other spirit insects.</p><p>It can be likened to a Natal Magic Treasure, intimate and inseparable.</p><p>And the closer and more trusting the spirit insect is to its master, the higher the probability of a successful Spirit Elevation Ritual.</p><p>It can be said that the Spirit Elevation Ritual is tailor-made for Natal Insect Gu, and it must have originated from the Witch Clan.</p><p>I wonder if the Witch Clan of the Canglang Sea understand the Spirit Elevation Ritual?</p><p>This thought flashed through Qin Sang's mind.</p><p>He knew very little about the Witch Clan's heritage, but he could see that the Spirit Elevation Ritual was incredibly complex and by no means an ordinary secret art.</p><p>Obtaining the Spirit Elevation Ritual...</p><p>Whether or not I can enter the Pure Ocean Sect, this trip will not have been in vain.</p><p>Qin Sang took a reassuring pill and then looked at the Three Spirits Coiling King Formation.</p><p>The Three Spirits Coiling King Formation is not complicated. The three spirit insects only need to arrange a Three Talents formation, requiring the person in charge of the formation to control it precisely.</p><p>Of course, there is also a requirement that the three spirit insects must not fiercely resist during the process of activating the insect formation, so Qin Sang needs to appease the Fire Jade Centipede.</p><p>In addition, a kind of altar is needed.</p><p>The altar can be prepared in advance and only needs to be set up when deploying the formation.</p><p>However, the altar can only be used once.</p><p>The previous altar was already used on the Jade-Mouthed Bee.</p><p>These three days, the Qi-surnamed cultivator went out and brought back the required spirit materials. Valley Master Mu refined a small portion, and it will take more than ten days to complete the refining.</p><p>Qin Sang briefly comprehended it and also flew over to help.</p><p>...</p><p>Just as they were busy.</p><p>In the distance.</p><p>Beneath the empty water surface, there was actually a person quietly lurking.</p><p>This place was also in the Empty Spirit Sea, but this person was extremely careful, hiding far away, and there was still a distance between him and Qin Sang, so the Heavenly Eye Butterfly did not discover this person.</p><p>He was wearing a black robe, and on the thumb of his right hand, he wore a yellow jade thumb ring, with two square characters on it—Nine Precepts!</p><p>This person was actually the current Nine Precepts Island Lord—Holder of the Precepts True Person!</p><p>This 'Nine Precepts' thumb ring was passed down by Holder of the Precepts' master, Nine Precepts True Person.</p><p>The two masters and disciples had somewhat strange Dharma names. Some speculated that the name Holder of the Precepts might be because he held the Nine Precepts thumb ring.</p><p>But no one dared to question it in front of a Nascent Soul.</p><p>At this time, Holder of the Precepts True Person restrained his aura, hid under the water, sat cross-legged, and remained motionless. He crossed his hands on his knees, holding a yellow round pearl.</p><p>Inside the round pearl was a scene of water waves.</p><p>Deep in the water waves, the busy figures of Qin Sang and the others were reflected.</p><p>However, the scene was very blurry and far away. Clearly, Holder of the Precepts True Person was worried about being discovered by the other party and dared not openly spy on them.</p><p>But this was enough.</p><p>Holder of the Precepts True Person stared intently at the round pearl, and when he saw the scene there, a trace of anxiety appeared in his eyes.</p><p>"Could it be that they really have a way?"</p><p>Holder of the Precepts muttered to himself.</p><p>His gaze shifted to a new face—Qin Sang.</p><p>Then, Holder of the Precepts True Person let out a soft sigh that was almost imperceptible and suddenly retreated silently.</p><p>Before long, Holder of the Precepts True Person flew out of the sea and sped north.</p><p>After flying out of the Empty Spirit Sea and confirming that there was no danger, Holder of the Precepts True Person lowered his escape light and took out a dark black token, a hint of struggle appearing in his eyes.</p><p>The token did not have any extra patterns. There were only two words—'Chaos Demon'!</p><p>Holder of the Precepts gritted his teeth and suddenly activated his true essence, pouring it into the token.</p><p>Black light flourished!</p><p>The token vibrated violently and suddenly surged with thick demonic qi. The words 'Chaos Demon' on it twisted for a while, gradually turning into a demonic qi vortex, and then a cold fluctuation spread out.</p><p>*Pa!*</p><p>Holder of the Precepts True Person's expression changed slightly, and he threw the token out.</p><p>The token shattered in response and turned into a ball of demonic qi, disappearing into thin air, and the surroundings returned to normal.</p><p>Then, Holder of the Precepts True Person silently looked north, staying where he was, seemingly waiting for something.</p><p>Several days later, a black escape light appeared on the horizon, demonic qi soaring to the sky, heading straight for Holder of the Precepts True Person.</p><p>Holder of the Precepts True Person woke up from his meditation, flew into the air, and saw the earth-shattering escape light. His face showed joy, and he quickly tidied his clothes and respectfully bowed in the direction of the approaching person, "Holder of the Precepts greets Senior."</p><p>The visitor was actually the Lord of Chaos Demon Island, Old Man Chaos Demon!</p><p>Although both were Nascent Soul cultivators, Holder of the Precepts treated him with the courtesy of a junior.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The sound of breaking through the air was deafening.</p><p>Old Man Chaos Demon did not conceal himself and flew to Holder of the Precepts True Person in the blink of an eye.</p><p>Immediately afterward, a cold voice rang out from the escape light, "Holder of the Precepts, that Chaos Demon Token was given to your master by this old man. You dare to use my Chaos Demon Token, do you know the consequences?"</p><p>Holder of the Precepts True Person's eyelids twitched, but his tone was exceptionally calm, "This junior understands. Unless the predecessor personally grants it to someone, outsiders who use the Chaos Demon Token must pay the corresponding price!"</p><p>"It's good that you know!"</p><p>Before his words finished, a figure landed in front of Holder of the Precepts True Person, actually an old man with kind eyes and a benevolent face, wearing a gray shirt and with a full head of white hair.</p><p>It was hard to imagine that Old Man Chaos Demon, who was so powerful in the Boundless Sea, even the entire North Sea, had such an image.</p><p>His back was slightly hunched, and he held a black bamboo staff in his hand.</p><p>The moment he put away the escape light, he also restrained the aura on his body, without the slightest bit of powerful presence.</p><p>He seemed like an ordinary senile old man.</p><p>But the moment he saw Old Man Chaos Demon, even Holder of the Precepts True Person, who was as strong as he was, felt a tightening in his heart, and his movements became more cautious.</p><p>Old Man Chaos Demon's eyes seemed a bit turbid as he looked at Holder of the Precepts True Person and said faintly, "Considering that you are Nine Precepts' only disciple, as long as you give a reason that satisfies me, this old man can refrain from pursuing the matter."</p><p>"Thank you, Senior!"</p><p>Holder of the Precepts True Person was not happy because of this. His expression turned serious, "This junior discovered the ruins of an ancient sect, which contains something very important to this junior, but there are others who have also discovered the ruins. The other party has many people and is powerful, and this junior can only boldly ask the senior to take action."</p><p>"Merely the ruins of an ancient sect?"</p><p>Old Man Chaos Demon snorted coldly.</p><p>Seeing Old Man Chaos Demon's displeased expression, Holder of the Precepts True Person's heart beat rapidly, and he quickly said, "This sect has an extraordinary background. It is a rare Buddhist sect in the cultivation world, named the Pure Ocean Sect!"</p><p>Hearing the Pure Ocean Sect, Old Man Chaos Demon's eyes flashed, but he did not speak.</p><p>Holder of the Precepts True Person dared not play riddles and said repeatedly, "Many years ago, my master was fortunate enough to obtain a part of the Pure Ocean Sect's heritage and considered himself a disciple of the Pure Ocean Sect. Later, he occupied Nine Precepts Island in order to find the Pure Ocean Sect's ruins. My master only knew that the Pure Ocean Sect was in the Empty Spirit Sea. He spent countless years but did not find any clues and could only die with regret. This junior originally thought that the Pure Ocean Sect had completely disappeared, but unexpectedly, an unusual phenomenon suddenly appeared. This junior was about to investigate, but someone beat him to it..."</p><p>"Nine Precepts! Holder of the Precepts! So that's how it is!"</p><p>Old Man Chaos Demon looked in the direction of the Empty Spirit Sea and smiled, "In the entire Boundless Sea, the number of people who know the Pure Ocean Sect exists is less than the fingers on both hands, and those who know that the Pure Ocean Sect is in the Empty Spirit Sea, I originally thought that besides this old man, there would be no other. So you masters and disciples are Buddhist disciples. This old man did not discover it back then. Nine Precepts hid it very deeply."</p><p>He seemed to know quite a lot about the Pure Ocean Sect.</p><p>A look of surprise could not help but appear in Holder of the Precepts True Person's eyes as well.</p>
