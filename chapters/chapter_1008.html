<h1>Chapter 1000: The Ten-Year Pact</h1><p>Inside the cave dwelling.</p><p>Qin Sang had just sat down when he asked, "May I inquire about the relationship between Fellow Daoist Ning and Senior Qingzhu?"</p><p>Ning Wu Hui's cultivation was only at the Core Formation stage. Qin Sang guessed that he might be a disciple of Senior Qingzhu.</p><p>As if guessing Qin Sang's thoughts, Ning Wu Hui said, "Senior never formally accepted any disciples, but all cultivators who have received his kindness on Spirit Turtle Island treat him with the respect due to a master. When and where did you meet him?"</p><p>Ning Wu Hui leaned forward slightly, his tone urgent.</p><p>"The last time the Seven Killing Palace opened, in the Heavenly Pagoda..."</p><p>Qin Sang didn't hide anything, describing the circumstances of his encounter with Senior Qingzhu.</p><p>"Senior Qingzhu wasn't in good condition. Another consciousness within him had taken control. It was bloodthirsty, cruel, and demonic, like a demonic soul."</p><p>Hearing this, the expectant look in Ning Wu Hui's eyes gradually faded. His brow furrowed, and he pondered for a long time. "Did he ask you to bring back any messages?"</p><p>"No."</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head. "At the time, Senior could only temporarily suppress the other consciousness with great difficulty. He wanted to condense a crystal bead for me to bring back to you, but the other consciousness destroyed it. Moreover, he couldn't reveal any real secrets, he couldn't even think about them, lest the other consciousness capture his thoughts."</p><p>"I see. Thank you, Fellow Daoist, for bringing back this news."</p><p>Ning Wu Hui took a deep breath and cupped his hands towards Qin Sang. Then, his tone changed. "Fellow Daoist Qin has come to visit in person. You must have other important matters to attend to?"</p><p>Qin Sang still had many questions, but seeing that Ning Wu Hui seemed unwilling to explain, he didn't press further, instead stating his purpose. "Your insight is keen, Fellow Daoist. I do have a matter that I originally wanted to consult with Senior Qingzhu. However, as Senior Qingzhu is unable to answer me directly, he instructed me to seek you out."</p><p>"Oh?"</p><p>Ning Wu Hui looked surprised. "Please speak, Fellow Daoist. I will tell you everything I know."</p><p>"There is a teleportation formation within the inner hall of the Seven Killing Palace that is very important to me. Only Senior Qingzhu knows its location..."</p><p>Since he was asking for help, Qin Sang couldn't hide anything and could only tell the truth.</p><p>Ning Wu Hui had earned Senior Qingzhu's trust and should be reliable.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Ning Wu Hui's expression turned troubled. "Fellow Daoist, you may have misunderstood. I don't know much about the Seven Killing Palace, and I've never heard Senior mention a teleportation formation."</p><p>Qin Sang's heart sank.</p><p>Ning Wu Hui's expression didn't seem fake.</p><p>Senior Qingzhu was trapped by the demonic soul, and it was unknown how long it would take him to break free.</p><p>Ning Wu Hui knew nothing about this.</p><p>If Senior Qingzhu couldn't suppress the demonic soul, would he never be able to return?</p><p>The grudges and grievances of the Small Cold Realm were secondary. Now that he had reached the late Core Formation stage, his cultivation method and natal spirit sword were no longer issues. He was about to face the bottleneck of Nascent Soul formation.</p><p>Everything was ready, he only lacked the Nine Phantasmal Sky Orchid, which was very important to him.</p><p>Ning Wu Hui stood up and paced back and forth, seemingly pondering something important.</p><p>After a moment, he said to Qin Sang, "Senior asked you to come to me. There must be a deeper meaning. In that case, there's no need for me to hide anything. The next time the Seven Killing Palace opens, I must go to the inner hall myself. If I'm not mistaken, he might want you to enter the Seven Killing Palace with me."</p><p>"Is this Senior Qingzhu's intention?"</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes lit up, and he immediately thought of something, asking in surprise, "Is there a way to help Senior suppress the demonic soul and resolve the hidden danger within the inner hall?"</p><p>Ning Wu Hui shook his head. "I don't know much, I'm just following orders. If Fellow Daoist Qin is willing to go with me, we can agree on a meeting place before the Seven Killing Palace opens. However, the interval between the appearances of the Seven Killing Palace has shortened significantly once again. It is rumored that the next time it opens on its own might be in just over ten years. Fellow Daoist should prepare early. The Seven Killing Palace is not a benevolent place, especially the inner hall, a dangerous place that even Nascent Soul ancestors speak of with trepidation..."</p><p>"Just over ten years, so soon?"</p><p>Qin Sang was startled by these words, greatly exceeding his expectations.</p><p>He had thought he would have to wait another fifty years. By then, his cultivation would be nearing the peak of the Core Formation stage, and he could start preparing for Nascent Soul formation upon returning to the Small Cold Realm.</p><p>"I heard this from a Nascent Soul ancestor in my sect. It shouldn't be false. The Seven Killing Palace is appearing earlier and earlier. It's hard to say what will happen in the future."</p><p>Ning Wu Hui sighed.</p><p>Qin Sang subconsciously tapped his fingers on the table, his eyes fixed in thought for a long time.</p><p>He really hadn't expected the Seven Killing Palace to appear so soon. All his plans were instantly disrupted.</p><p>Ten years was definitely not enough time to refine a new avatar.</p><p>He would also have to return to the Demon Sea to capture a spirit beast, and he probably wouldn't have time to be picky.</p><p>During this time, the most important thing was not cultivation.</p><p>His cultivation and physical body had just broken through, and even with ten years of diligent cultivation, his strength wouldn't be able to leap forward significantly.</p><p>He might as well collect some resources that were scarce in the Small Cold Realm and make a fortune upon his return, such as demon cores, demon bones, and Demon Slaying Pills.</p><p>Especially Demon Slaying Pills, which had the miraculous effect of increasing the chances of forming a Nascent Soul, would definitely fetch a high price and were very cost-effective. But when selling Demon Slaying Pills, he absolutely couldn't reveal his identity, or it would cause big trouble.</p><p>These thoughts flashed through his mind and were suppressed by Qin Sang.</p><p>Whether or not he could return to the Small Cold Realm was still unknown.</p><p>Afterward, the two talked privately for a long time.</p><p>Two days later, Ning Wu Hui personally escorted Qin Sang down the mountain.</p><p>After bidding farewell to Ning Wu Hui, Qin Sang flew for a distance, looked around, then turned his escaping light and disappeared into a mountain range.</p><p>Soon, Qin Sang appeared in front of a dense forest.</p><p>As his escaping light arrived, Bai's voice came from within, "How did your trip go, Fellow Daoist?"</p><p>Before the words finished, Bai flashed out from the forest, glanced behind Qin Sang, and seeing no pursuers, beckoned towards the forest. Dozens of streaks of light flew out and disappeared into his palm.</p><p>To be safe, before leaving, Qin Sang and Bai had carefully set up a spirit array. If they were pursued by a Nascent Soul ancestor, they could use the spirit array to trap the opponent for a while, but it wasn't needed now.</p><p>Qin Sang's figure flashed repeatedly, landing in front of Bai. "I met the person in charge and have some clues about the ancient teleportation formation. But there's one piece of news, I don't know if it's good or bad.  The Seven Killing Palace might appear in just over ten years..."</p><p>Bai hadn't expected it to be so soon and looked surprised. "So, you can return to the Small Cold Realm in ten years?"</p><p>"I don't know what Senior Qingzhu's arrangements are. Whether or not I can return depends on whether the hidden danger within Senior Qingzhu can be resolved."</p><p>Qin Sang hesitated for a moment, then asked, "What are your plans, Fellow Daoist Bai? Will you come with me to the Small Cold Realm to search for a way to break the Heavenly Corpse Talisman, or will you stay in the Boundless Sea to search for your memories?"</p><p>The teleportation formation was located within the Seven Killing Palace, and only when the Seven Killing Palace appeared on its own could one travel between the two realms. If any unforeseen changes occurred to the Seven Killing Palace, this passage might be severed.</p><p>Bai's origins were inseparable from the Seven Killing Palace, and the Seven Killing Palace was located near the Boundless Sea. The chances of finding his memories in the Boundless Sea were definitely greater than elsewhere.</p>
