<h1>Chapter 1905: Establishing the Estate</h1><p>Red flames danced on the surface of the magma. Within this sea of fire, certain flames burned with a deeper intensity than their surroundings, outlining countless mystical runes that together formed a colossal, circular spirit formation, hidden for years beneath the magma lake.  The formation's edge bore a clear gap, readily identifiable as a damaged section.</p><p>Beneath these flickering flames, a multitude of fiery jade stones of varying sizes bathed in the magma, their material identical to the token held by the Dharma Body.  These could be seen as the foundation of the spirit formation, clearly refined by human hands. What was visible was merely the tip of the iceberg; a far grander structure lay below, resembling a magnificent city, though sadly ruined and dilapidated.</p><p>The Dharma Body merged into the magma, traversing the spirit formation. The Heavenly Eye Butterfly diligently operated its Dharma Eye, assisting in analyzing the formation. However, due to the vast disparity in their cultivation levels, the butterfly's aid to Qin Sang was currently limited.</p><p>Continuing to descend, the surrounding space gradually constricted, the largest jade stones now comparable to houses. The Dharma Body moved between two such stones, as if walking through the narrow corridor of a palace. Flames flickered across the jade surfaces, the fiery runes resembling exquisite murals.</p><p>“Such a grand design... Unless a high-ranking cultivator personally oversaw its creation, a powerful force must have been behind it... Could there have been a top-tier sect near here?” Qin Sang mused, observing carefully.</p><p>From what he knew, the Northern Fire Domain did house some cultivation sects, but they were fragmented and disparate, their power and influence paling in comparison to Cloud Metropolis Mountain, and they were beholden to the whims of Cloud Metropolis Heaven.</p><p>“Fallen into decline, perhaps?”</p><p>The Dharma Body accelerated, reaching the center of the spirit formation unscathed, finally discovering a grand hall constructed of jade stones.  The hall, too, was heavily damaged, its roof half-collapsed and its walls askew.</p><p>An inscription remained above the entrance, where three characters should have been.  Now, only the last remained: the character 'Palace.'</p><p>Knowing the full name of the palace might offer a clue to the formation’s origin. Unfortunately, despite Qin Sang’s intense scrutiny, he couldn't decipher the missing characters, finding no helpful clues.</p><p>Entering the hall, he found nothing but rubble and debris, even more desolate than he'd anticipated. Perhaps, Qin Sang speculated, disaster had struck suddenly, forcing the inhabitants to flee with their treasures, or perhaps enemies had plundered the place.</p><p>Did this spirit formation exist solely to protect this unremarkable palace? Qin Sang felt something was amiss.</p><p>After a moment of contemplation, the Dharma Body returned to the surface of the formation, gazing down upon it and extending his senses.  The surrounding landscape materialized before his eyes.</p><p>Streams of magma converged, some flowing calmly, others turbulent. Some even concealed fiery storms within, brimming with violent energy.</p><p>Suddenly, a glint of insight flashed in the Dharma Body’s eyes. He plunged back into the formation, not towards the center this time, but towards one particular corner.</p><p>He quickly located his target: nine jade stones encircling an empty space.  Due to the small size of this space and its apparent lack of unusual features, an ordinary observer might dismiss it as merely a structural quirk of the formation, unworthy of further thought.</p><p>To the Dharma Body, however, this spot was the most unique part of the entire formation!</p><p>He flashed into the space, scrutinizing the nine jade stones, his certainty growing. He extended a finger towards one of the stones.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The jade stone erupted in flames, appearing to melt under the intense heat. The runes carved upon its surface became increasingly distinct, resembling coiling dragons and serpents.</p><p>‘Swish! Swish! Swish!’</p><p>These 'dragons and serpents' came alive, emerging from the flames.  Streaks of fire shot out, striking another jade stone, which ignited instantly and underwent a similar transformation.</p><p>This continued until all nine jade stones were ablaze, their fierce flames transforming the space into a furnace.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The Dharma Body felt the space beneath him tremble violently. The flames spun rapidly, a vortex of profound firelight opening like a passage to an unknown realm.</p><p>Without hesitation, the Dharma Body plunged into the vortex.  He felt a momentary twisting force, then it subsided, and the surrounding clamor vanished.</p><p>Crimson filled his vision!</p><p>Endless crimson fire in every direction.  This was a world of pure flame, a small space yet brimming with the power of the surrounding fire veins. The intensity of the crimson fire far surpassed that of the outside world.</p><p>This was the true core of the spirit formation!</p><p>The Dharma Body’s gaze shifted to the center of the space, where a bronze pillar stood.</p><p>The pillar was three zhang high and two arm-spans thick, wreathed in crimson flames. Its body, too, was crimson, as if sculpted from red bronze.  Its surface was covered in densely packed runes of unknown meaning.</p><p>The Dharma Body flashed to the pillar.  He initially assumed it was some kind of treasure and that the formation's creator might have been using the subterranean fire veins to refine it.  Upon closer inspection, he doubted this.</p><p>While the pillar's material had undoubtedly transformed after enduring countless years of fiery refinement, this was surely not the creator's intention.</p><p>The Dharma Body's gaze lingered on the runes, his mind deep in thought.  He was surprised to find that even he couldn't fully comprehend their purpose, as if a crucial piece of the puzzle was missing.</p><p>A bold idea suddenly struck Qin Sang: perhaps this wasn’t the only such pillar!  If his conjecture was true, similar formations might exist elsewhere!</p><p>Qin Sang hadn’t expected such a development, his interest piqued.</p><p>The Dharma Body extended a hand, pressing it against the pillar's surface, his mind probing within as his True Essence surged into it.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>A terrifying wave of fire engulfed the Dharma Body.</p><p>…</p><p>Meanwhile…</p><p>Within a turbulent magma river, four figures walked through the molten rock.</p><p>Varying in height, all four wore wide, crimson cloaks that concealed their entire bodies. The cloaks seemed to repel the magma, creating a barrier around each individual.</p><p>One figure walked at the center, while the other three surrounded him in a triangular formation.</p><p>The four proceeded in silence.</p><p>Suddenly, the central figure stopped, his companions immediately noticing and turning towards him.</p><p>“The Flame Heart Jade glows!” the central figure rasped.</p><p>His voice was icy, chilling to the bone, yet now tinged with a hint of emotion.  His cloak trembled as he produced a crimson jade disc, radiating a fiery light. The jade disc hovered amongst the four.</p><p>The tallest figure, positioned to the rear left, exclaimed excitedly, “It finally glows! It must be nearby!”</p><p>His voice was even more peculiar, resembling the scraping of metal.</p><p>“How can you be certain it’s nearby?” a woman’s skeptical voice came from the rear right.</p><p>Her voice was strikingly different, alluring and seductive, capable of igniting a man’s desires.</p><p>The tall figure, unfazed by her charm, retorted, “We've searched for so long with no reaction, and now it glows here.  Where else could it be?”</p><p>The woman didn’t argue, turning instead to the leader at the front. “Lord Feiluo, can you sense its exact location, or determine its distance from the Flame Heart Jade’s glow?”</p><p>“No,” Lord Feiluo replied curtly, summoning the Flame Heart Jade closer.  “Prepare the formation.”</p><p>“Now?” the woman asked, her cloak swirling hesitantly.</p><p>“What are you afraid of? We've been sneaking around for ages. It’s been too long since I’ve tasted blood; my mouth is practically watering!  A few more coming our way would be perfect!” the tall figure cackled, his laughter abruptly cutting off.</p><p>Lord Feiluo glanced at him coldly.  “As long as it’s not those old geezers from Cloud Metropolis Heaven, kill them.  Quickly and cleanly.”</p><p>“Yes!” the three responded, bowing and positioning themselves around Lord Feiluo, extending their hands from beneath their cloaks.</p><p>Horrifyingly, apart from the woman, the other two had withered, blue-black hands. Their black fingernails exuded a potent corpse poison, making them resemble zombies.</p><p>The woman's hands, although slender and white, were excessively pale, devoid of any blood color.</p><p>The three simultaneously channeled their power, green flames appearing in their palms.  Threads of green fire extended from the flames, spreading through the air. The threads from each of the three connected, continuing to expand.</p><p>Beneath the magma river, green and crimson fires intertwined.  An incredibly complex formation diagram gradually took shape, with Lord Feiluo standing at its core.</p><p>Just as he was about to act, the Flame Heart Jade flickered and abruptly extinguished.</p><p>All four froze, stunned by this unexpected turn of events.</p><p>“Continue!” Lord Feiluo commanded, his pale hands emerging from beneath his cloak to cradle the Flame Heart Jade.</p><p>The three hesitated briefly, then resumed channeling the green fire, completing the formation diagram.</p><p>…</p><p>Meanwhile…</p><p>The Dharma Body withdrew his True Essence, removing his hand from the bronze pillar.  The fire waves gradually subsided.</p><p>“No reaction…”</p><p>The situation differed from Qin Sang’s expectations. He couldn’t sense any other pillars. Either his guess was wrong, or the other formations had been completely destroyed, the latter being the more likely scenario.</p><p>The Dharma Body shook his head slightly. The remaining remnants weren’t worth his continued attention.</p><p>Qin Sang was unaware that in a distant location, four figures tirelessly attempted to reactivate the Flame Heart Jade, but to no avail. They lingered there for a considerable time, excavating the surrounding area for hundreds of li, searching every inch, but finding nothing.</p><p>…</p><p>Returning to the surface, the Dharma Body merged with his true form. Qin Sang flew into the air, surveying the landscape below. He began to formulate a plan.</p><p>This location was suitable for a cultivation grounds and the establishment of a cave dwelling, but it required a new formation.  Qin Sang intended to carefully consider his options; with proper execution, this could become a permanent abode.</p><p>Examining the remnants of the formation revealed that the feng shui of this place had been meticulously arranged by a master.  The spiritual veins were concealed within the fire veins, difficult to detect, yet brimming with spiritual energy.</p><p>Qin Sang decided to retain the bronze pillar. The pillar’s ability to gather fire within its space would provide a suitable dwelling for the Vermilion Bird and enhance future refining efforts, an unexpected boon.</p><p>However, the arrangement of the fire veins needed altering. He also planned to relocate the surrounding spiritual veins, even reshaping the terrain itself.</p><p>A Void Refinement cultivator, while lacking the power to fill oceans, possessed the ability to move mountains!</p><p>Such an undertaking would undoubtedly create considerable commotion, but this area was sparsely populated. With caution, it should pose no problem.  In this region, the collision of fire veins frequently reshaped the landscape. Even if someone had previously visited this location, they wouldn’t suspect anything.</p><p>Qin Sang extended a finger, tapping points in the void.  Specks of spiritual light burst forth from his fingertips, coalescing into various shapes, forming patterns that he subsequently dismissed.</p><p>After repeated deliberation, a 'geomancy chart' materialized before him. This chart encompassed both the surface and the subterranean realms, detailing every fire vein and spiritual vein, even the course of every magma river.</p><p>His figure flickered, vanishing from sight, then reappearing after a brief survey.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>Sword light flashed.  The Grey Warbler Sword soared skyward, its image disappearing into the air.</p><p>The next moment, daylight dimmed, the darkness surpassing even the glow of the magma below. The world’s spiritual energy surged towards the heavens, transforming into countless stars.</p><p>Each star was a sword star, Qin Sang utilizing the Seven Stellar Domains Sword Formation to conceal the fluctuations.</p><p>The stars hung brilliantly, each one shining brightly.</p><p>The sword formation continued to expand. As its primary purpose was concealment, Qin Sang unrestrainedly drew upon the world's spiritual energy to support it, encompassing an area of a hundred li.</p><p>"That's enough," Qin Sang murmured, pausing his efforts.</p><p>From outside the sword formation, nothing unusual could be detected.</p><p>Inside, the fire spirits frolicking in the magma sensed the celestial stars seemingly focused upon them, instinctively uneasy, growing agitated.</p><p>However, their senses were completely severed, leaving them to scurry about like headless flies, unable to escape.</p><p>Qin Sang closed his eyes, the Four Vermilion Serpent Seal hovering before his chest.</p><p>Four Vermilion Serpents, treading upon wind and snow, flew towards the four cardinal directions, each exhaling a cloud of frigid air.  The frigid air descended, transforming into ice.</p><p>‘Boom! Boom! Boom!’</p><p>The earth shook as ice mountains descended from the sky, crashing into the magma rivers, severing their flow.</p><p>‘Splash!’</p><p>Magma surged upwards.</p><p>The ice mountains remained unmoved, the Vermilion Serpents majestic as they patrolled the skies.</p><p>Qin Sang then extended his hands, palms facing upwards.</p><p>‘Rumble!’</p><p>The world's spiritual energy violently churned, instantly manifesting a visible spiritual tide.</p><p>The spiritual tide surged towards Qin Sang from all directions, carrying a seemingly world-destroying might, yet calming instantly upon reaching him.  The spiritual energy continued to converge, ultimately forming a gigantic hand the size of a mountain.</p><p>Qin Sang’s expression shifted slightly. The giant hand trembled, then slammed into the ground.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>The ground collapsed.</p><p>A massive hole appeared, magma erupting from below in a towering geyser before gradually receding.</p><p>Beneath Qin Sang, a magma lake now existed.</p><p>His actions didn't cease.</p><p>The world's spiritual energy moved in accordance with his hands.</p><p>When he pointed east, a surge of spiritual energy transformed into a colossal sword, cleaving the earth. He then hooked his finger, drawing out a subterranean fire vein like a fiery dragon, merging it with another fire vein before driving them back underground.  He then pressed his palm downwards, the world's spiritual energy compressing the earth.  The fissures groaned and closed.</p><p>When he pointed west, the former riverbed rose, forming a mountain, and new river channels opened on either side of the mountain range.</p><p>…</p><p>Filling rivers, leveling mountains, all within the flick of his wrist!</p><p>As the terrain shifted, the spiritual veins and fire veins relocated accordingly, invisibly flowing into the magma lake below, converging like rivers into the sea.  The sword formation expanded and contracted in tandem, masking these changes.</p><p>Qin Sang reveled in the sensation of controlling the world. Despite the apparent grandeur, his manipulation remained crude. A true Void Refinement cultivator wouldn’t employ such brute force.</p><p>The location gradually transformed into Qin Sang's envisioned design. He nodded in satisfaction, his gaze turning south. He gently beckoned with his right hand.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>A thunderous roar echoed as a towering stone peak rose from the earth, flying through the air and slowly rotating before him.</p><p>Qin Sang shaped the mountain with his hand as if it were a blade, carving out his dwelling.  After some simple refinement, he placed it at the heart of the lake.</p><p>(End of Chapter)</p>
