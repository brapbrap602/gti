<h1>Chapter 1433 Seven Teachers' Buddhist Seal</h1><p>"Why is the Myriad Demons Assembly suddenly being held ahead of schedule? When did you receive the news?"</p><p>Qin Sang was taken aback, then his brow furrowed tightly.</p><p>In that instant, he thought of many things.</p><p>Is the Myriad Demons Assembly being held ahead of schedule related to Old Devil Hun and the Pure Ocean Sect?</p><p>If not, what is the real reason?</p><p>If it is a trap, why not convene the Myriad Demons Assembly immediately after leaving the Pure Ocean Sect, but wait a year and a half before releasing the news that the assembly is being held ahead of schedule?</p><p>Immortal Master Yinquan heard Qin Sang's suspicion, "It was just spread recently, and it cannot be determined for the time being, but the source is very reliable, so it shouldn't be fake. Fellow Daoist Qin, please be patient and stay for a few more days, and it is estimated that a list of treasures will be sent over, after all, there are only half a year left, and fellow Daoists who are too far away still have to hurry."</p><p>Qin Sang moved his palm and put the Hidden Fragrance Pill into the Thousand Jun Ring.</p><p>He leaned slightly against the back of the chair and asked silently: "Has there ever been such a precedent before?"</p><p>Immortal Master Yinquan thought for a while and said: "I came from Pill Cauldron Mountain and have only participated in the Myriad Demons Assembly once. It is said that the interval between each Myriad Demons Assembly is only an approximation, and it will be determined only when it is approaching. The original news was that it would be seven years later, but it has never been confirmed."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded slightly, tapping the table with his fingers, pretending to think, "Has anything noteworthy happened in the Boundless Sea recently? I heard that Old Devil Hun once appeared in the Empty Spirit Sea, and an ancient relic was born."</p><p>"I've heard of that too, but it's unlikely. I heard that it was a Buddhist Sect relic, and the era is not ancient. The sect-protecting grand formation was destroyed by the Scarlet Flame eruption before it was opened, and all the Nascent Souls present were in a panic and almost fell. The treasures of the Buddhist Sect were swallowed by the flames, and they only had time to snatch out a very small part. Even if there are any Buddhist treasures or secret books inside, it is estimated that they will not be of great value to us, and it is impossible to promote the Myriad Demons Assembly ahead of schedule. Those Buddhist disciples want them, but they can't afford the price."</p><p>Immortal Master Yinquan shook his head again and again, and added, "The history of the Myriad Demons Assembly is untraceable and far older than Old Devil Hun. The participants are not only limited to the Boundless Sea, but involve a wide range of people. The reason why it is set on Hunmo Island is because there are great cultivators as deterrents. Old Devil Hun cannot decide everything by himself. The various forces must game to discuss a suitable time and rules."</p><p>Just as Qin Sang guessed, Old Devil Hun is alone and cannot dominate. Other forces will not agree to him acting arbitrarily and destroying the reputation of the Myriad Demons Assembly.</p><p>Even if Old Devil Hun wants to do something, he can't be too obvious.</p><p>Qin Sang thought to himself.</p><p>At this time, Immortal Master Yinquan suddenly remembered something and said with a smile: "Rather than saying it is related to the Buddhist Sect relic, it is better to say it is because of another matter."</p><p>"What's the matter?"</p><p>Qin Sang looked up.</p><p>Immortal Master Yinquan said, "Huang Longshi's Immortal Abode has appeared!"</p><p>Qin Sang was a little dazed at first.</p><p>Then he remembered hearing the name once. Huang Longshi was the number one person in the Boundless Sea of Old Devil Hun's great-great-grandfather (previous generation), and he was undoubtedly a great cultivator who shook the Three Realms of the North Sea.</p><p>Huang Longshi's Immortal Abode has appeared, how come I don't know?</p><p>This is much more valuable than the Pure Ocean Sect.</p><p>It is said that Huang Longshi was only one step away from transforming into a god, and the reason for his fall was that he tried to break through the transformation into a god and failed. His Immortal Abode may contain his relics.</p><p>It's hard to say whether there are any spiritual treasures.</p><p>For example, a handwritten record of breakthrough experience.</p><p>For example, a secret technique to assist in the transformation into a god.</p><p>Enough to make Nascent Soul cultivators flock to it.</p><p>"It happened a month ago, and the details are not yet clear. Rumor has it that Old Devil Hun was behind it again. It is said that several Nascent Souls from the Xuan Heavenly Palace and several demons also discovered Huang Longshi's Immortal Abode, and a war broke out. The people from the Xuan Heavenly Palace were brutally slaughtered, including an elder from the Xuan Heavenly Palace."</p><p>Immortal Master Yinquan laughed, "I suspect that Huang Longshi's Immortal Abode was discovered by the Xuan Heavenly Palace and occupied by Old Devil Hun."</p><p>That's the old devil's style.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded subconsciously.</p><p>He sighed inwardly. Is this what it means to have gains and losses?</p><p>Because he offended Old Devil Hun in the Pure Ocean Sect, he deliberately reduced going out. If he had received the news in time, he might have had a chance to get involved.</p><p>Although Spiritual Lantern Flower, Wishful Treasure Pearl, and other items are precious, Qin Sang is more willing to use them to exchange for secrets about the Transformation Stage.</p><p>Huang Longshi's Immortal Abode must have been looted by Old Devil Hun.</p><p>Qin Sang estimated that the old devil would not be willing to share it with him.</p><p>Several Nascent Souls of the Xuan Heavenly Palace were slaughtered.</p><p>Old Devil Hun is really unscrupulous and does whatever he wants.</p><p>Qin Sang thought of the Ice Box in the Thousand Jun Ring. The Xuan Heavenly Palace elder personally led the team and wandered in the Boundless Sea. It was likely that they came out to look for the Ice Box and accidentally discovered Huang Longshi's Immortal Abode, but they were brutally murdered.</p><p>"The Xuan Heavenly Palace has not given up, but the Ice Box has not shown any signs of movement. I don't know if I haven't met them, or if the Nine Nether Devil Fire has successfully isolated the sense. Senior Feng said he would use this to plot against Bifang, I wonder if he has released the news?"</p><p>Qin Sang's thoughts diverged, and he thought of many things again.</p><p>Immortal Master Yinquan didn't suspect anything else and continued: "Huang Longshi's Immortal Abode appeared less than a month ago, and the Myriad Demons Assembly announced it was being held ahead of schedule. According to Fellow Daoist's thinking, Old Devil Hun and those old devils may have really found something inside and are preparing to take action at the Myriad Demons Assembly, or they are in urgent need of collecting certain treasures..."</p><p>Speaking of this.</p><p>Immortal Master Yinquan suddenly paused, his face changed slightly.</p><p>The two looked at each other and had the same thought -- could it be related to transformation into a god?</p><p>Qin Sang gave a dry laugh, "Over the countless years, I don't know how many talented and brilliant people there have been in the cultivation world, how can the Transformation Stage be so easy to break through."</p><p>If Old Devil Hun really breaks through the Transformation Stage, Qin Sang has to consider where to dig a hole and hide.</p><p>The Crescent Moon Realm forces and the Xuan Heavenly Palace definitely don't want a Transformation Stage demonic cultivator to appear in the North Sea.</p><p>They chatted for a while, but couldn't figure it out.</p><p>Qin Sang prepared to stay for a few more days, waiting to see the list of treasures.</p><p>The news spread quickly.</p><p>On the third day, Immortal Master Yinquan obtained the list.</p><p>"This is just a part of it. Except for the top ones, they can all be bought at the auction. If you want to know what the real treasures are, you must participate in the final trade fair of the Myriad Demons Assembly."</p><p>Immortal Master Yinquan said as he handed the jade slip to Qin Sang.</p><p>The Myriad Demons Assembly lasts for ten days.</p><p>The last day will reach its climax.</p><p>Qin Sang took the list and only saw lines of words, densely packed.</p><p>He immediately found several spiritual objects needed for the Spirit Ascension Sacrifice. After a rough sweep, except for the three most important ones, they could all be gathered at the auction.</p><p>What a large investment!</p><p>There are also materials that can enhance the Golden Submerged Sword, but they are not the best choice. If you want to buy better ones, you must wait for the trade fair to exchange things for things.</p><p>Qin Sang moved his gaze to the top of the list, about to take a closer look, when he suddenly caught sight of a line of words: "Seven Teachers' Buddhist Seal," a Buddhist Sect Body Cultivation Martial Art.</p><p>Other than that, there is no more detailed introduction.</p><p>This "Seven Teachers' Buddhist Seal" will not be auctioned at the auction, but will be reserved for the final trade fair, which shows the value of the "Seven Teachers' Buddhist Seal."</p><p>It must be a Nascent Soul level martial art!</p>
