<h1>Chapter 1027: Treasure Pavilion</h1><p>The power of the illusion array gradually intensified, but with Mingwei and Tianmu Butterfly working together, their speed was even faster than Qin Sang's had been.  Qin Sang only needed to be on guard against potential dangers.</p><p>Mingwei secretly observed Qin Sang.  Seeing his sword wheel, she was surprised and thought, "Such exquisite swordsmanship is rare even among sword cultivators of the same rank.  Why is such a talent unknown in the Canglang Sea?" Her beautiful eyes flickered, trying to discern the true identity hidden behind the mask.  "Partnering with him was the right choice…"</p><p>Finally, they emerged from the Thousand Mountains Array unscathed.  In an instant, the dense fog dissipated.</p><p>The two found themselves inside a pavilion.  The layout was similar to the small courtyard before, with two teleportation arrays on one side.  The difference was that the pavilion had an exit leading outside.</p><p>Mingwei stepped towards the door, stood by the railing, and looked out.  "This door should lead to the inner hall…"</p><p>Qin Sang looked around and gazed outside.  The outside scenery was in full view.  The pavilion was suspended in mid-air, surrounded by radiant, multicolored immortal restraining light, sparkling brilliantly.</p><p>Outside the exit was a long flight of steps that passed through the immortal restrictions, leading to an unknown destination. The end of the steps was shrouded in darkness, nothing could be seen from here.</p><p>Mingwei gripped the railing tightly, took a deep breath, and silently chanted, "Ancestor is waiting for me!"</p><p>Currently, they were the only two in the pavilion.  It was unknown how many had already proceeded to the next trial before them.</p><p>"The fourth and final trial is coming up. The Soul Cleansing Liquid is here. Fellow Daoist, have you estimated how long it will take to reach the Treasure Pavilion?" Mingwei turned and asked Qin Sang.</p><p>The Treasure Pavilion was their agreed meeting point.  It was also where the rewards for the final trial were distributed. The treasures were hidden within the Treasure Pavilion. Whether or not they could obtain them, and what treasures they obtained, depended entirely on their own discernment and abilities.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered for a moment, then shook his head helplessly. "Fellow Daoist is enviable, having a Nascent Soul ancestor's protection. I, on the other hand, have always been alone. My understanding of the Trial Realm is limited, based only on hearsay. I only learned about the Soul Cleansing Liquid after arriving here. It is said that the final trial is the most dangerous and covers the widest area. Although it doesn't change like the previous three trials, everyone will be sent to different locations and face different encounters. I cannot say for sure how long it will take me to reach the Treasure Pavilion."</p><p>"Besides the life talisman, my ancestor can't help me with anything else. I'll have to rely on myself from here on out," Mingwei said after a moment of contemplation.  "If Fellow Daoist arrives too late and misses the appearance of the Soul Cleansing Liquid, I won't wait."</p><p>Qin Sang was not offended. "As it should be! If I can't even reach the Treasure Pavilion, it's my own lack of ability, not your fault. However, since I've led you out of the Thousand Mountains Array, would you share some information about the Soul Cleansing Liquid?"</p><p>This was also part of their agreement. Qin Sang needed to understand the process of the Soul Cleansing Liquid's appearance to be prepared.</p><p>Before entering the Trial Realm, his conversation with Ning Wu Hui had been very brief. Ning Wu Hui only had time to tell him about the effects and location of the Soul Cleansing Liquid.</p><p>Qin Sang sensed that Ning Wu Hui didn't seem very interested in the Soul Cleansing Liquid and hadn't even suggested joining forces to obtain it. He was unsure if Ning Wu Hui would participate in the competition or had another objective.</p><p>"No rush. After we meet at the Treasure Pavilion, I will tell you everything I know, without hiding anything," Mingwei still refused to budge.  "Be warned, Fellow Daoist, do not be tempted by the treasures within the Treasure Pavilion. Taking any treasure will immediately remove you from the Trial Realm, disqualifying you from competing for the Soul Cleansing Liquid."</p><p>"I understand."  Qin Sang didn't press further, nodded to Mingwei, and stepped into the teleportation array.</p><p>White light flashed, and Qin Sang's figure vanished within.</p><p>Mingwei waited for a while, then followed.</p><p>Not long after their departure, subtle fluctuations appeared in the pavilion.  Moments later, four figures materialized simultaneously.</p><p>Among the four, three were men and one woman, all at the late Core Formation stage.  Two of the men wore similar robes, suggesting they were from the same sect.  The other man and woman wore ordinary robes, their origins unclear.</p><p>"We're out!" the woman exclaimed softly, her face filled with joy. "We didn't expect it to be so smooth! Thanks to Senior Brother Mei's Moon Illusion Mirror, we were able to see through the illusions, perfect for dealing with the Thousand Mountains Array! We must be among the fastest to clear it, right?"</p><p>"We might even be *the* fastest! Senior Brother, choosing the Moon Illusion Mirror as your natal magic treasure was a brilliant gamble!" one of the robed men said proudly, full of admiration for his senior brother.</p><p>The man smiled humbly. "I chose the Moon Illusion Mirror because it was the most compatible with me. I couldn't have planned so far ahead. Besides, without my junior brother and the two fellow Daoists' calculations, I wouldn't have broken the array so easily on my own. Those disciples from major sects like the Heavenly Dao Sect must have similar methods. We mustn't let our guard down.  However, the Thousand Mountains Array was indeed an opportunity for us, buying us valuable time…"</p><p>"Indeed!" the last man agreed. "Barring unforeseen circumstances, we will definitely reach the Treasure Pavilion before the Soul Cleansing Liquid appears, giving us an advantage in obtaining it."</p><p>The woman giggled. "I don't have the same ambitions as you three. I'll be satisfied with a single high-quality treasure from the Treasure Pavilion. It's a pity we can't use our divine sense to examine the treasures inside. The quality of the magic treasures we get depends entirely on luck."</p><p>"Don't worry, Fellow Daoist. Most people are still trapped in the Thousand Mountains Array. There won't be many competing with you, so you can take your time choosing. Good magic treasures will surely have unusual qualities. To be safe, you could choose a damaged ancient treasure; you won't be disappointed," the robed man said reassuringly, seemingly very knowledgeable about the Treasure Pavilion.</p><p>The four rested briefly, discussed a few more things, agreed on a meeting point, and then entered the teleportation arrays one after another.</p><p>After they disappeared, more cultivators gradually appeared.</p><p>At first, there were few, but the number increased over time.</p><p>Some were weak and injured, unable to participate in the final competition, let alone venture into the inner hall. They could only rest briefly and leave the Trial Realm with regret.</p><p>Others were jubilant, seemingly having gained much from the previous trials. Unwilling to risk further, they unhesitatingly teleported away.</p><p>The later one arrived, the slimmer the chances of obtaining rewards from the Treasure Pavilion, let alone the Soul Cleansing Liquid.</p><p>Even some powerful cultivators, lacking the means to cope with the illusion array, were trapped in the Thousand Mountains Array for too long, losing the opportunity to compete for treasures and missing this chance.</p><p>The small pavilion saw a constant flow of people, each making different choices.</p>
