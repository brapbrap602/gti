<h1>Chapter 1757: Two Demons</h1><p>“Bodily fluids flourish, seven spirits abound.</p><p>Imbue your five elements, shining jade clarity!”</p><p>Shi Xuan’s clear voice rang out.</p><p>Accompanying the incantation, the talisman before him gradually neared completion, light and pure, drifting in mid-air like ripples of water.</p><p>Shi Xuan pointed a finger at Shen Huo, who was charging forward. The talisman trembled and shattered.</p><p>Simultaneously, a torrent of water abruptly descended from the heavens above Shen Huo, as if a section of the celestial river had been severed, pouring into him through his crown.</p><p>Shen Huo and Shi Xuan were sworn brothers and had long prepared for this.  Shen Huo’s forward momentum didn't falter.</p><p>In the next moment, Qin Sang perceived the water Qi of this region being drawn towards Shen Huo at a rapid pace. A blue halo gradually emanated from his body.</p><p>As the water Qi converged, a humanoid outline manifested, resembling armor crafted from the essence of癸 water, protecting Shen Huo within.</p><p>At the same time, Shen Huo’s aura surged, like a fierce tiger leaping through the forest. With a single bound, he soared above the cliff’s edge.</p><p>Looking down upon the temple on the cliff, Shen Huo’s face was filled with killing intent.  His hands gripped his black iron heavy sword tightly. The muscles on his arms bulged, emitting a faint blue light.  Empowered by Shi Xuan’s talisman, a greater strength seemed to surge into him.</p><p>“Hiya!”</p><p>A thunderous roar echoed, shaking the mountains.</p><p>Shen Huo raised his heavy sword high, his body like a bolt of lightning, fiercely cleaving down towards the temple.</p><p>The temple here was extremely simple, with almost no furnishings worthy of note. It lacked the magnificent solemnity of the divine temples under the jurisdiction of the Dao Court, appearing little better than the ghostfolk villages below the mountain.</p><p>However, the stones used to construct the temple were polished to a mirror-like smoothness.  The temple’s layout was square and precise.</p><p>Within the temple.</p><p>At this moment, a blue fox was lazily lounging on a soft couch.</p><p>This blue fox occupied the largest room in the temple, indicating its esteemed status.</p><p>Beside the couch stood a white jade statue of a fox with a human body, the very deity worshipped by the ghostfolk below the mountain.</p><p>This statue, however, was more refined and lifelike, clearly sculpted in the image of this blue fox, only with its fox body idealized into a human form.</p><p>The blue fox appeared to be half-asleep, lazily watching the group of lesser demons below.</p><p>These lesser demons were sharing the offerings presented by the ghostfolk. They hadn't yet attained sentience and, driven by instinct, inevitably squabbled amongst themselves, creating a chaotic scene.</p><p>The lesser demons’ target was a collection of baskets containing the blood offerings presented by the ghostfolk.</p><p>Not only did these offerings include the flesh and blood of demonic beasts hunted by the ghostfolk at great risk,</p><p>but from within several baskets came faint cries. Smelling the scent within, the lesser demons couldn’t restrain themselves, quickly devolving into a brawl.</p><p>To them, the contents of the baskets were undoubtedly a rare delicacy.</p><p>The ghostfolk, living in groups, weren’t easy to provoke. These lesser demons normally lacked the ability to seize their blood offerings, yet now the ghostfolk willingly offered them up.</p><p>All thanks to their Great King’s brilliant strategy, they could effortlessly enjoy such delectable blood offerings!</p><p>The lesser demons who managed to snatch the blood offerings devoured them ravenously, their admiration for the Great King on the couch boundless.</p><p>At this moment, a thunderous roar came from outside the temple.</p><p>The blue fox abruptly sat up, its gaze sharp.  It leaped backward, crashing through the wall with a loud boom.</p><p>The other lesser demons reacted a beat slower, turning their heads to stare blankly as a dark figure descended from the sky, sword slashing!</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>Dust and smoke billowed from the clifftop.</p><p>The black iron heavy sword cleaved precisely down the temple’s central axis, the blade sinking into the earth, leaving a deep gash in the ground.</p><p>Invisible waves surged outward from the sword gash, causing all the stone houses to collapse. Swept by the sword wind, all the stones were pulverized, along with the lesser demons inside, vanishing into nothingness.</p><p>With a ‘crack,’ the cliff face, unable to bear the strain, crumbled and plunged into the river below.</p><p>“Who dares destroy my divine temple!”</p><p>A furious shriek came from the dust and smoke.</p><p>Immediately, the smoke and wind churned, revealing a flurry of claws. The gale-force winds were like blades, instantly engulfing Shen Huo.</p><p>“What wild demon dares claim divinity!”</p><p>Shen Huo scoffed, undaunted. He effortlessly lifted the black iron heavy sword from the ground. With a flick of his wrist, three sword images split off, slashing out.</p><p>‘Bang! Bang! Bang!’</p><p>The seemingly cumbersome black iron heavy sword, in his hands, was wielded with exquisite precision.  The flurry of claws shattered, utterly routed.</p><p>With a muffled groan, the blue fox stumbled back a considerable distance.  It attempted to counterattack, but upon seeing Shen Huo and the figures behind him, its expression drastically changed.  It raised its head and let out a shrill howl.</p><p>Shen Huo knew it was calling for help, but he made no attempt to stop it. He rotated his wrist and sneered, "Better call all the evil gods around here.  I’ll just catch them all in one go!"</p><p>Before his voice faded, Shen Huo vanished from his spot, reappearing beside the blue fox, thrusting his sword.</p><p>The howl, infused with the blue fox's magic, instantly reverberated through the mountains.</p><p>From the depths of the mountains, the roars of dragons and tigers echoed almost simultaneously. Demonic Qi soared into the sky, accompanied by demonic winds and clouds rushing through the air.</p><p>Shen Huo paid them no mind; his eyes were fixed solely on the blue fox.</p><p>The blue fox dodged sideways.  Shen Huo’s thrust missed, but he remained relentless. He swung the sword horizontally, delivering a powerful slap.</p><p>Sensing danger, the blue fox was about to dodge again when a soft shout suddenly rang out beside its ear—Freeze!</p><p>A talisman had appeared above the blue fox’s head, seemingly slow but actually incredibly fast, fluttering down and adhering to its crown.</p><p>Instantly, as if crushed by immense weight, the blue fox froze, unable to move, its eyes filled with terror.</p><p>‘Bang!’</p><p>The heavy sword struck with ferocious force.  The blue fox took the full brunt of the blow, its bones instantly shattering, turning into a bloody pulp.</p><p>Shen Huo’s face, however, showed no sign of triumph.  He suddenly shifted his gaze towards a dense forest ahead.  With a cold snort, he was about to act when he saw a figure rush forward even faster than him.</p><p>The newcomer was Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang channeled the Lotus Seal of the Seven Masters’ Buddha Seal.  His figure flickered like smoke, elusive and unpredictable.  In a flash, he appeared at the edge of the forest, reaching out to grab something beside him.  He unexpectedly pulled another blue fox from the void.</p><p>His hand was like an iron clamp, tightly gripping the blue fox’s neck.</p><p>The blue fox’s eyes turned bloodshot as it struggled frantically.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>Qin Sang exerted a slight force with his five fingers.  The blue fox’s eyes bulged, its body went rigid, its breath faint.</p><p>“Excellent!”</p><p>A glint of admiration flashed in Shen Huo’s eyes. He praised Qin Sang’s keen grasp of the battle situation. He held his treasured sword horizontally and looked towards the depths of the mountains.</p><p>Qin Sang tossed the blue fox to Shi Xuan behind him and also looked in that direction.</p><p>However, he wasn’t focused on the demonic Qi; his gaze swept across the peaks inconspicuously.</p><p>Within a distant mountain, the mountain’s belly had been hollowed out into a hidden chamber.</p><p>A spherical jade orb rested within the chamber, emitting a faint glow, illuminating only a three-foot radius.</p><p>A voice echoed in the darkness, “Brother Jiu, the people from the Dao Court have arrived.”</p><p>A moment later, a figure walked towards the jade orb. It was a powerfully built man with leopard-like eyes and a ringed pattern around them, comparable in size to Shen Huo before he used his spell.</p><p>However, the man had a striped tiger tail protruding from his back.</p><p>He looked down at the jade orb, which displayed the scene at the blue fox’s temple.</p><p>Shortly after, another tall, thin figure emerged from the darkness.</p><p>This individual had a hooked nose and a pair of wings on his back. The gray feathers were dense and smooth, easily mistaken for a gray robe at a glance.</p><p>“Only a few juniors at the Cave God rank have arrived, not even any Dao Court Immortals.”</p><p>The powerfully built man raised his head and said.</p><p>Brother Jiu remained silent, staring at the jade orb for a moment. He suddenly pointed at Qin Sang in the image, “I sense a faint threat from this person.”</p><p>The powerfully built man was slightly taken aback. He scrutinized Qin Sang for a moment, then frowned, “Brother Jiu’s innate ability can sense danger.  Marquis Liu specifically sent you here, so your premonition is unlikely to be wrong.  However, could the Dao Court also have Immortals cultivating the Dragon and Tiger Altar?”</p><p>“Who said the Dao Court would definitely send Immortals?”</p><p>Brother Jiu countered, “If we become complacent, intending to deal with these juniors incidentally, wouldn’t we be falling right into a trap?”</p><p>The powerfully built man pondered, nodding his head, “To be able to make Brother Jiu sense a threat, this person must be at least at the City Altar Master level.  A few lesser demons posing as deities among the ghostfolk, and the Dao Court reacts so drastically?  You and I can report back to Marquis Liu. If it’s the same elsewhere, it means the path we’ve been preparing for all these years is the right one. Otherwise, the Dao Court wouldn’t be so alarmed by our initial actions.”</p><p>As they conversed.</p><p>The battlefield underwent another change.</p><p>The blue fox, having cried for help, failed to hold out until reinforcements arrived and was captured alive.</p><p>The demon gods who came to assist were not deterred. Soon, seven or eight demonic winds converged, accompanied by strange howls.</p><p>Faintly visible within the demonic winds were the fleeting shadows of jackals, wolves, tigers, and leopards.  Most of their auras were stronger than the blue fox’s, all at the Demon Core realm.</p><p>Sand and stones flew, and dark clouds gathered.</p><p>Qin Sang and Shen Huo stood side by side.</p><p>Shi Xuan was slightly behind them, and Luo Yin at the very rear.</p><p>At this moment, Luo Yin also summoned her altar.</p><p>Unlike Shi Xuan, Luo Yin cultivated the Army and Horses Altar, and she had been allocated troops and horses by her sect since the beginning of her cultivation.</p><p>The Dao soldiers raised in the Nine Glories Cave Heaven were mostly aquatic creatures, all elite forces.</p><p>Luo Yin’s troops were uniform, all being blue sharks, each ten feet long. The blue sharks formed a battle formation in the sky.</p><p>There was no water in the void.</p><p>The blue sharks spewed mouthfuls of vital essence, which diffused in the air, as if creating a lake in the sky.</p><p>“Essence of mountains and rivers, essence of a hundred splendors.</p><p>Form a canopy, exhaling clouds.”</p><p>Luo Yin’s voice was clear and melodious. Standing atop the altar, she paced and turned gracefully.</p><p>The blue shark formation shifted accordingly, separating and merging to manifest a diagram. The combined power of the demons influenced the heavens and earth.</p><p>Layers of white clouds suddenly arose in the sky above.</p><p>At first, it was just a thin layer of cloud Qi, but as the white clouds accumulated, they covered the sky, like a canopy unfurling above, enveloping everything below.</p><p>Just at this moment, the demons arrived. They immediately felt a sense of oppression, looked up at the sky, exchanged glances, and roared in unison.</p><p>In an instant, the demons revealed their true forms, each displaying their magical powers.  They acted separately, all targeting Luo Yin!</p><p>They had only recently gained sentience, but their instincts told them that Luo Yin, who cultivated the Army and Horses Altar, posed the greatest threat to them.</p><p>Shen Huo laughed heartily, casually chose an opponent, and slashed with his sword.</p><p>Shi Xuan flashed in front of Luo Yin, the Golden Seal Altar before him rotating slightly as another talisman flew out.</p><p>“Divide the River!”</p><p>The talisman flashed and disappeared. A great river suddenly appeared in the sky, its source unknown, its destination unknown.</p><p>The river was like a natural moat, flowing past Shi Xuan, blocking the demons on the opposite bank.</p><p>Luo Yin remained focused on her incantation, ignoring her ferocious opponents.</p><p>Before long, the sound of ‘pitter-patter’ filled the air, and torrential rain poured down on the surrounding mountain peaks.</p><p>Amidst the raging wind and rain, water droplets linked together like strings of pearls, transforming into sharp water swords.</p><p>In an instant, myriad swords hung inverted above the demons, a chilling aura filling the sky.</p><p>Luo Yin opened her eyes slightly, revealing a murderous intent.  She glared at the demons, and the thousands of water swords whirled in the air, plunging downwards.</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't idle either. He chose an opponent for himself, a white tiger at the rear of the demon group.</p><p>This white tiger had the highest cultivation level and was the one who had devised the strategy to target Luo Yin.</p><p>Qin Sang observed everything, formed the Lotus Seal, and passed through the demons like a phantom.</p><p>The white tiger’s eyelids twitched. It crouched slightly, roared, and shadows appeared on its flanks—two倀 ghosts.</p><p>Both 倀 ghosts were wolf demons killed by the white tiger, each at the Demon Spirit realm in life. They lunged at Qin Sang together.</p><p>Qin Sang maintained the Lotus Seal, his figure flickering, passing between the two倀 ghosts. Then his hand seals rapidly changed, forming the Demon Subduing Seal, which he pressed towards the white tiger's forehead with lightning speed.</p><p>The white tiger was startled.  It roared and, surprisingly, dared not confront Qin Sang directly. It turned and fled, the two 倀 ghosts hastily flying back to protect their master.</p><p>Having forced the white tiger back, Qin Sang didn’t change his target, nor did he intend to capture it. He calmly pursued the white tiger, always appearing on the verge of catching up but remaining just a step behind.</p><p>Beside the jade orb in the hidden chamber.</p><p>The powerfully built man watched this scene unfold, a puzzled expression on his face.</p><p>“Brother Jiu, this person…”</p><p>Brother Jiu’s brows furrowed, his gaze fixed on Qin Sang.  After a moment, he suddenly noticed the white tiger’s escape route.  His expression changed drastically, and he shouted, “Run!”</p><p>Just as his voice fell.</p><p>Qin Sang in the jade orb suddenly looked up in this direction, a faint smile playing on his lips.  A spirit sword appeared before him, its light flashing.</p><p>The powerfully built man reacted swiftly.  Alerted by his companion, he retreated into the cave without hesitation.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The Gray Oriole Sword pierced through the mountain wall’s formation barrier, striking the jade orb within the wall without deviation.</p><p>The sword’s momentum continued, pursuing the two fleeing demons.</p><p>Qin Sang followed close behind.</p><p>Just now, he had a strange feeling of being watched.  He ordered the Heaven's Eye Butterfly to activate its power to investigate and discovered an extremely concealed formation barrier within this mountain.  Approaching, he sensed two powerful auras.</p><p>In such a remote area, there were unexpectedly demon kings, seemingly at the Transformation realm, lurking.</p><p>With Qin Sang’s intellect, it wasn’t difficult to guess that he had stumbled into another conspiracy.  Having already entered it, it was too late to withdraw.  Moreover, he wanted to make a name for himself in Jushan. Unless the enemy was overwhelmingly powerful, he wouldn’t retreat主动ly.</p><p>Even if there was no conspiracy, capturing two great demons would still earn him merit.</p><p>‘Whoosh! Whoosh!’</p><p>The two demons retreated hastily, their faces filled with shock.</p><p>The sword Qi displayed by the Gray Oriole Sword terrified them, but fortunately, they weren’t without recourse.</p><p>When they decided to set up here and test the Dao Court, they had prepared an escape route, constructing a small teleportation formation.</p><p>Having sensed the danger, Brother Jiu immediately activated the formation.</p><p>“Go!”</p><p>Brother Jiu stepped onto the teleportation formation, reaching out to grab the powerfully built man.  The formation shimmered with spiritual light.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang appeared at the cave entrance. Seeing this, he frowned slightly, and the Gray Oriole Sword’s speed surged.</p><p>Just as the two demons vanished, the spirit sword pierced through the powerfully built man’s chest, carrying his corpse into the stone wall behind.</p><p>The spiritual light dissipated, and Brother Jiu disappeared.</p><p>Qin Sang strolled over, frowning slightly as he looked at the now defunct teleportation formation. Recalling the demon’s final sinister gaze, he knew he had made another enemy.</p><p>However, he didn't care.</p><p>The opponent was extremely cautious.  In that hasty exchange, being able to eliminate the tiger demon was already a good outcome, though it was a pity he couldn’t capture it alive.</p><p>(End of Chapter)</p>
