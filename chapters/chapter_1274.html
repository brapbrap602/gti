<h1>Chapter 1266: A Lone Battle</h1><p>The Demon Lord Ye was determined to have his way.</p><p>Knowing that further words would be futile, Qing Jun decisively hurled the Five Directions Pagoda into the air, aiming to trap Demon Lord Ye beneath it!</p><p>However, the phantom image of the pagoda moved faster than its physical form, appearing above the cage.</p><p>Demon Lord Ye glanced at the white shadows diligently spewing cold air, his black robe billowing as he uttered a series of incomprehensible syllables. The phantom of the Five Directions Pagoda seemed to encounter immense resistance and could no longer descend.</p><p>The white shadows paid no attention, their eyes fixed solely on the cage.</p><p>At the same time, Demon Lord Ye's physical form, on the verge of being suppressed by the Five Directions Pagoda, suddenly vanished into thin air, reappearing three zhang away, effortlessly escaping the pagoda's suppression.</p><p>Before him, a black and a white light had materialized without warning.</p><p>These were two short halberds.</p><p>The halberds themselves were also black and white, revealing them to be his life-bound treasures—the Yin-Yang Halberds!</p><p>The Yin-Yang Halberds shot forth, transforming into two coiling dragons.</p><p>The white halberd, representing Yang, was overwhelmingly powerful, its might unstoppable.</p><p>The black halberd, representing Yin, moved silently, cunning and venomous.</p><p>The white dragon bared its fangs and claws, lunging toward the Five Directions Pagoda.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The two supreme treasures collided with no embellishments, striking each other with full force.</p><p>The Five Directions Pagoda, originally aimed at Demon Lord Ye, was struck by the Yang Halberd, hitting the central character "方" .</p><p>However, the Yang Halberd failed to break the pagoda's protective aura, and the strike did not damage its physical form. The pagoda tilted slightly, pausing momentarily, but remained unscathed.</p><p>The Yang Halberd, unable to gain the upper hand, was even repelled, immediately transforming back into the white dragon and desperately entangling itself with the pagoda.</p><p>The Five Directions Pagoda was now surrounded by the dragon's shadow, and the two treasures were locked in a stalemate.</p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p>Demon Lord Ye was somewhat surprised.</p><p>The Five Directions Pagoda was not inferior to his Yin-Yang Halberds. What was even more remarkable was that this treasure was not anyone's life-bound artifact, making it a perfect candidate for a sect's legacy treasure.</p><p>However, no matter how high the quality of a treasure, its power ultimately depended on the wielder's ability to harness it.</p><p>The leader of the Yuan Shen Sect before him had always been rather low-key. Though he had gained some renown in previous battles, Demon Lord Ye had never considered him a threat.</p><p>Demon Lord Ye had only deployed the Yang Halberd to deal with the Five Directions Pagoda, confident that even if he were slightly at a disadvantage, he could easily hold it off. The current situation was unexpected.</p><p>Demon Lord Ye gave Qing Jun a deep look, his surprise growing.</p><p>He actually found this person somewhat inscrutable!</p><p>Though the title of "Number One in the Northern Star Realm" was merely flattery, Demon Lord Ye had enough confidence to live up to the reputation.</p><p>Yet, there was someone he couldn't see through.</p><p>The performance of the Five Directions Pagoda proved that both he and Elder Tianzheng had underestimated this person. Whether he had been hiding his true strength all along or had recently gained some opportunity to advance rapidly remained unclear.</p><p>As Demon Lord Ye scrutinized Qing Jun, the Yin Halberd vanished into thin air, reappearing in front of Qing Jun and thrusting straight toward her face.</p><p>The Yin Halberd remained silent, like a black dragon moving through the shadows.</p><p>Qing Jun, locked onto by the halberd's tip aimed at her brow, felt a sharp pain and a surge of alarm. She silently recited an incantation, and a streak of blue light shot out from her sleeve.</p><p>Suddenly, a phoenix's cry rang out.</p><p>The blue light expanded with the wind, transforming into a blue phoenix.</p><p>The blue phoenix was vibrant, its appearance slightly different from before.</p><p>After obtaining the essence blood of the blue phoenix, Qin Sang had shown Qing Jun the true divine aura of the phoenix. Qing Jun had used this to refine the phoenix puppet, bringing it closer to the real thing.</p><p>However, during its initial creation, Qing Jun had embedded fire runes within the phoenix, turning it into a fire phoenix. This transformation was irreversible, and it could no longer revert to a thunder phoenix.</p><p>Even so, the phoenix puppet had undergone a metamorphosis and had grown closer to Qin Sang.</p><p>After a clear cry, the blue phoenix twisted its head, locking onto the black dragon formed by the Yin Halberd. With a flash of its wings, it extended its sharp claws and pounced.</p><p>*Bang! Bang!*</p><p>The Yin Halberd and the blue phoenix engaged in several rounds of intense combat, entangling with each other.</p><p>Having learned his lesson, Demon Lord Ye spared no effort in activating the power of the Yin Halberd, quickly gaining the upper hand. The blue phoenix began to show signs of fatigue.</p><p>Seeing this, Qing Jun summoned another treasure—the Hidden Moon Over Rivers and Mountains scroll she had used before.</p><p>The scroll slowly unfurled.</p><p>A vast landscape of endless rivers and mountains stretched out, shrouded in rolling clouds. A bright moon rose slowly, its beauty unparalleled.</p><p>The Hidden Moon Over Rivers and Mountains scroll was no longer what it used to be. The world within the painting was flawless, as if it truly existed.</p><p>The scroll itself coiled around Qing Jun, forming a protective barrier.</p><p>Only the bright moon rose from the painted world, hovering above the two combatants.</p><p>The moonlight shone coldly, casting a beam of light that merged into the blue phoenix.</p><p>Empowered by the treasure, the blue phoenix's strength surged. It let out two excited cries and tightly entangled itself with the black dragon.</p><p>Demon Lord Ye's plan for a quick victory was completely thwarted.</p><p>However, Qing Jun also found it difficult to prevent Demon Lord Ye from breaking the seal.</p><p>She withdrew part of her consciousness from the phoenix puppet and focused on controlling the Five Directions Pagoda, attempting to forcefully repel the white dragon and shatter the white shadows gnawing at the cage.</p><p>But Demon Lord Ye would not give her the chance. With a series of hand seals, a mysterious connection formed between the two Yin-Yang Halberds, and their power surged once more.</p><p>As the battle grew fiercer, Demon Lord Ye suddenly sensed something and looked up.</p><p>Above, black chains crisscrossed, blotting out the sky.</p><p>His gaze seemed to pierce through the blood, looking toward the surface of the blood pool.</p><p>Then, he withdrew his gaze, his eyes flickering as if considering something. After a moment, he snorted coldly and suddenly squeezed a few drops of essence blood from his fingertips, flicking them into the white shadows.</p><p>The white shadows devoured the essence blood, instantly becoming ferocious.</p><p>The seal on the cage was on the verge of collapse!</p><p>...</p><p>Outside the blood pool.</p><p>Qin Sang was breathing heavily, frowning at the blood demon avatar before him.</p><p>He had retracted the demonic flames, and the sword light and thunder around him had just dissipated, indicating he had used both thunder and sword遁术.</p><p>Earlier, Qin Sang had used the demonic flames to intimidate the blood demon avatar, hoping to take advantage of its distraction and use his superior遁术 to break through its blockade and enter the blood pool. However, he had been stopped.</p><p>Qing Jun and Jing Yu had been down there for so long, yet there was no movement from the blood pool. Not only were the forces of the Sin Abyss anxious, but Qin Sang was also worried—were Qing Jun and Jing Yu a match for Demon Lord Ye?</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at the other two battlefields.</p><p>At the entrance to the blood pool.</p><p>Two great formations were intertwined, each containing elements of the other.</p><p>The formations were interconnected, and everyone was affected by them. Now was the most intense moment, and those within the formations dared not withdraw lightly, lest they trigger a chain reaction and give their opponents an opening to break through.</p><p>Meanwhile, the battle between Lord Tongyou and Elder Tianzheng showed no signs of concluding.</p><p>At the start, Lord Tongyou had been but an insignificant shadow within the starry river.</p><p>Now, the shadow had consumed half of the starry river, with阴风 howling and assaulting the remaining stars.</p><p>Elder Tianzheng had been forced to break through the Star River Tome earlier, suffering some damage to his vitality. Lord Tongyou's demonic power was at its peak, and he held the upper hand. Victory was only a matter of time.</p><p>But time was precisely the most precious resource!</p><p>Even if Elder Tianzheng was injured, holding off Lord Tongyou for a while would not be difficult.</p><p>Qin Sang sighed inwardly. It seemed the breakthrough would have to come from his side.</p>
