<h1>Chapter 1514: The Turning Tide (4k)</h1><p>Deep within the Sacred Land.</p><p>Darkness receded.</p><p>Rainbow light illuminated the void.</p><p>The Exquisite Pagoda descended.</p><p>At the last moment, the cries of the demons from the pagoda's base ceased abruptly as the pagoda landed.</p><p>The Exquisite Pagoda landed precisely where the stele had been.</p><p>The stele vanished, replaced by a giant tower emitting a seven-colored halo.  The entrance was sealed.</p><p>The void trembled, the aftershocks continued to surge, and the mist around the pagoda billowed outward. Rainbow light shone through the mist, spreading widely.</p><p>Even on the floating mountains outside, one could clearly see the heavenly glow in the Sacred Land's depths, lingering for a long time.</p><p>Many cultivators from the Xuan Tian Palace, including Tong Lingyu, looked up at the Exquisite Pagoda, dumbfounded.</p><p>When the anomaly occurred, they sensed that staying in the stele space might not end well. However, the power of the Exquisite Pagoda far exceeded their expectations, subduing all the demons inside!</p><p>Tong Lingyu and the others were shocked and incredulous at this sight.</p><p>The stele space opened inexplicably, and a pagoda appeared deep within the Sacred Land. No one knew what impact this would bring.</p><p>At least, for now, it wasn't bad news; the sufferers were their enemies.</p><p>The moment the Exquisite Pagoda descended, the rainbow light reached its peak brilliance before gradually weakening.</p><p>Deep within the rainbow light, the Exquisite Pagoda rapidly shrank to its normal size, shining brilliantly.</p><p>However, as time passed, the rainbow light faded and eventually disappeared, and the Exquisite Pagoda lost all its luster, becoming an ordinary grayish-white stone tower.</p><p>Its texture was very similar to the previous stele.</p><p>“Elder…”</p><p>Elder Mei confirmed that the Hun Mo Elder had been suppressed at the bottom of the tower, breathed a sigh of relief, and quickly approached Tong Lingyu, whispering a few words.</p><p>Tong Lingyu glanced at Palace Master Jiang, then flew to the stone tower, circling it once, but found no entrance.</p><p>The stone tower stood alone where the stele had been.</p><p>Everyone had the same question in their minds: Where were the Liuli couple?</p><p>Was the tower's seal related to them?</p><p>At the last moment, the demons appeared en masse, but the Liuli couple was nowhere to be seen.</p><p>Did they encounter danger inside, perhaps even being attacked by demons, only managing to send a warning?</p><p>At that moment, the Xuan Tian Palace cultivators were in an uproar. Affected by the stone tower, the nearby spatial turbulence intensified. If this continued, the danger level would soon approach the Sacred Land's deepest parts.</p><p>Tong Lingyu frowned slightly, scanned her surroundings, and said, “Palace Master Jiang and I will stay behind. Elder Mei, you and the others quickly pursue and eliminate the remaining demons.  Try to capture one alive to find out exactly what happened inside.”</p><p>Hun Mo and Tian Peng, the major threats, were trapped at the bottom of the tower.  The remaining demons wouldn't cause any significant trouble, so she didn't need to act personally.</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>Elder Mei received the order and left.</p><p>After discussing with Palace Master Jiang, Tong Lingyu tried various methods, but was unable to affect the stone tower in the slightest, let alone open it.</p><p>The spatial turbulence intensified, forcing Palace Master Jiang to withdraw. Tong Lingyu never saw Qin Sang and Liuli emerge from within.</p><p>If she couldn't stop it by the time the Sacred Land closed, she would only be able to lead everyone away.</p><p>However, Tong Lingyu felt that Qin Sang couldn't have been suppressed so easily. The more she looked at the Exquisite Pagoda, the more familiar it seemed, reminding her of the seven-story pagoda Qin Sang had taken from the Xuan Tian Palace treasury.</p><p>Was there a connection between the two pagodas?</p><p>Yin Changsheng essentially died at his hands.  Such a person couldn't be simple.</p><p>Even Hun Mo Elder and Tian Peng the Great Saint working together might not have been able to hold him!</p><p>Unbeknownst to her, the time for the Sacred Land to close was approaching.  Tong Lingyu received a signal, flew back, and saw Elder Mei with a surprised expression.</p><p>Elder Mei reported the information in detail, becoming more and more shocked, unable to believe that Qin Sang's strength was so immense.</p><p>Elder Mei then understood why Hun Mo Elder's counterattack wasn't particularly fierce – the couple had nearly taken Hun Mo Elder's life right before everyone's eyes!</p><p>“They voluntarily entered the Exquisite Pagoda, holding a smaller tower. The anomaly may have been orchestrated by them, and the tower may hold further secrets!”</p><p>Tong Lingyu didn't believe Qin Sang would willingly perish with the demons, but the information she had was too limited.  She didn't even know the origin of the smaller tower from the sect's treasury, making analysis impossible.</p><p>By this time, only the Xuan Tian Palace disciples remained in the Sacred Land; the other demons had all fled.</p><p>Tong Lingyu led her people to guard the entrance to the Sacred Land, waiting until the last moment, but still saw no sign of Qin Sang and Liuli.</p><p>Palace Master Jiang was also helpless, watching helplessly as the Sacred Land closed.</p><p>The Chongming bird, pulling the palanquin, knelt at Tong Lingyu's feet.</p><p>This intelligent bird, possessing extraordinary wisdom, understood its master's absence and shrewdly chose to align itself with the strongest present, a stark contrast to its previous boastful demeanor.  Another reason was that it sensed the aura of the Xuan Tian Ling from Tong Lingyu.</p><p>‘Whoosh…whoosh…’</p><p>A hurricane howled in their ears.</p><p>The entrance to the Sacred Land rapidly shrank, eventually becoming a black line before vanishing completely.</p><p>Tong Lingyu looked around.</p><p>This expedition to the Sacred Land was unprecedentedly chaotic.  Xuan Tian Palace suffered heavy losses, with the majority of casualties resulting from internal conflict.</p><p>She had anticipated a period of quiet recuperation upon their return, but the situation took a surprising turn. The demons met a far more tragic end, almost completely annihilated.</p><p>Xuan Tian Palace remains a top power in the North Sea!</p><p>“Daoist Qin's actions were truly grand. Once this news spreads, the North Sea will be shaken, and the couple's reputation will be amplified beyond measure. I wonder where they are now…”</p><p>This thought crossed Tong Lingyu's mind. She summoned her spirit boat, leading her disciples back to the unnamed islet.</p><p>Using the Xuan Tian Ling and her own token to open the spirit array, she left her disciples on the island and departed with Grandmaster Jiang and others, planning to search the nearby waters for a while longer.</p><p>The cultivators on the island sensed the heavy atmosphere.  After noticing the absence of the Palace Master and other high-ranking officials, the disciples from both factions became increasingly anxious. However, without the Grand Elder's permission, no one could activate the teleportation array.</p><p>…</p><p>Meanwhile.</p><p>Qin Sang and Liu Li had already been relocated from the Sacred Land by the Exquisite Pagoda.</p><p>At the last moment, they felt their bodies bound by a powerful force.  Their vision blurred, and the sound of a roaring wind filled their ears as they found themselves tossed into a storm belt.</p><p>Qin Sang nearly had his essence drained by the pagoda and quickly swallowed several pills.</p><p>He looked around.</p><p>Their location seemed random, with no teleportation array nearby.</p><p>The hurricane raged incessantly, and the surrounding scenery was monotonous.  Lacking the Ice Demon Crystal, they couldn't sense the Sacred Land's location.</p><p>“The Exquisite Pagoda shouldn't have moved us too far. We must still be in the South Territory.  Heading north should lead us back to the North Sea…”</p><p>Qin Sang said to Liu Li, turning his head.</p><p>Liu Li nodded, her jade finger lightly tapping, releasing a wisp of green light. The light circled her finger before transforming into a slender green shuttle.  The shuttle was long and pointed at both ends, with a swirl of green energy around it like a flowing ribbon, appearing incredibly light and brimming with spiritual energy.</p><p>Noticing Qin Sang's gaze, Liu Li said, "This is Master's Ten Directions Earth-Opening Shuttle. Its speed is only passable, but it will save us some energy."</p><p>Years ago, Bing Yao had used this very shuttle to travel with the Qi Refinement stage Liu Li, traversing storm belts.</p><p>It was one of the few treasures Bing Yao left Liu Li.</p><p>Both of them, including Qin Sang's avatar, were severely depleted of their True Essence.</p><p>Qin Sang followed Liu Li into the shuttle.  He found the interior space limited but not cramped.</p><p>Inside the shuttle, the surrounding scenery was perfectly visible, allowing for quick reactions.  The shuttle seemed to possess inherent defensive capabilities; no jolting was felt within.</p><p>Liu Li silently channeled her True Essence, and the shuttle transformed into a streak of green light, breaking through the air. It moved like a wisp of wind dancing through the hurricane, light and agile.</p><p>Qin Sang then remembered to take out the Moon Gazing Rhinoceros Horn to draw upon moonlight and confirm their direction.</p><p>…</p><p>Tong Lingyu and her group searched for a long time without success. She personally visited the Sacred Land entrance several times.</p><p>In fact, Qin Sang and Liu Li had already left the storm belt and found an island to rest and recover.</p><p>Their injuries were not serious, mostly sustained during their fight with Yin Changsheng.  The few pills they used to replenish their True Essence were top-grade spiritual medicines, leaving manageable residual effects.</p><p>By cultivating their techniques, they soon recovered most of their strength and flew towards the unnamed islet, encountering Grandmaster Jiang along the way.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang and Liu Li, Grandmaster Jiang was overjoyed; he had almost given up hope.</p><p>“Good! Good! Good! It’s good to have you back!”</p><p>Grandmaster Jiang was greatly relieved, sending a message back. The three of them flew on at a leisurely pace.</p><p>Qin Sang sensed a change in Grandmaster Jiang's attitude, now marked by obvious reverence, extending even to Liu Li, without his usual casualness toward juniors.</p><p>After a moment's reflection, Qin Sang guessed that the events of the battle in the stone tablet space had likely spread, and he smiled inwardly, unconcerned.</p><p>From Grandmaster Jiang, he learned of the fate of the Hunmo Old Man and Tian Peng Great Sage, and other demons. Qin Sang's expression softened slightly.</p><p>He and the demons had formed an unbreakable enmity.</p><p>If Hunmo and Tianpeng had escaped, while he wouldn't fear them, he would still be uncomfortable being constantly watched by such powerful enemies.  It would be like having a thorn in his side.</p><p>Qin Sang correctly guessed that Tong Lingyu wouldn't let the demons escape, but unforeseen circumstances could still arise.  </p><p>Fortunately, he wasn't disappointed.</p><p>Soon, the three of them reached a small unnamed island.</p><p>Xuan Tian Gong's cultivators, having received prior notice, emerged from their caves, appearing to welcome honored guests.</p><p>Upon seeing Qin Sang, everyone involuntarily displayed awe and a hint of fear in their expressions.  This was because subduing so many demons was unprecedented; even Yin Changsheng, revered as a god by Xuan Tian Gong, hadn't achieved such a feat.</p><p>While there was some element of luck, using ancient formations and treasures, the battle before entering the Linglong Pagoda was undeniably real.  </p><p>With the Palace Master's death, he was probably the strongest cultivator in the North Sea!</p><p>Tong Lingyu and Elder Mei, along with others, personally greeted him.  Subtle glances, some scrutinizing, some apprehensive, converged on Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang smiled, bowing in greeting, causing everyone to hastily return the courtesy.</p><p>After some pleasantries, Qin Sang grew impatient with the constant praise.</p><p>Tong Lingyu noticed and dismissed everyone, leaving only Qin Sang. They sat facing each other.</p><p>"This battle will make your name known throughout the land!  You've become instantly famous!"</p><p>Tong Lingyu exclaimed, without envy; Xuan Tian Gong had also greatly benefited.</p><p>She paused, then inquired about the events, adding, "If there's anything inconvenient for you to share, please consider it my presumption…"</p><p>"There's nothing I can't say. Thanks to the legacy of Senior Xiao Xiangzi, I unexpectedly collected two smaller towers, merging them to control the ancient formation.  The Futu Tower is now within the Linglong Pagoda…"</p><p>Qin Sang briefly explained the relationship between Xiao Xiangzi, Xuan Tian Gong, and Jing Hai Zong, the origin of the towers, and the circumstances.</p><p>He also asked Xuan Tian Gong for help investigating Xiao Xiangzi, revealing almost everything.</p><p>Of course, he didn't mention the treasures within the towers.</p><p>Tong Lingyu finally understood the sequence of events, realizing with a sigh, "Senior Xiao Xiangzi's intentions were noble; we, his descendants, are ashamed! Thankfully, the Jing Hai Zong elders fulfilled his trust and prevented a major catastrophe.  Upon returning, I will instruct my disciples to spread the glorious deeds of Senior Xiao Xiangzi and Jing Hai Zong, erecting monuments in their honor—they mustn't be forgotten…"</p><p>Qin Sang nodded slightly, indicating his willingness to assist.</p><p>They discussed a plan, exchanging information about their recent trip to the sacred site.</p><p>Finally, Tong Lingyu smilingly asked, "I'd like to nominate you for the position of Grand Elder.  What are your thoughts?"</p><p>"Oh?"</p><p>Qin Sang questioned, "I'm an outsider; how could I be Grand Elder?"</p><p>Tong Lingyu nodded decisively, "Daoist Friend Qin, you've formed a Daoist partnership with Liuli and made great contributions. No one in the sect would object. Why not? If the Palace Master's position didn't require a direct descendant of the Xuan Tian lineage, you could even be Palace Master without anyone daring to object!"</p><p>"If I become Grand Elder, what will you do, Daoist Friend Tong? A gentleman doesn't seize what belongs to others. I'm dedicated to Dao cultivation and lack the time for sect affairs," Qin Sang refused without hesitation.</p><p>Tong Lingyu's eyes flickered, and she looked troubled. "To be frank, I need to help Senior Brother Luo recover and focus on my breakthrough; it will take a considerable amount of time. Currently, there's no Palace Master, and I can't divide my attention.  If you don't agree, Xuan Tian Gong will be leaderless, and chaos will likely ensue…"</p><p>"What about having Hall Master Jiang take over as Grand Elder?"</p><p>Qin Sang seemed to see through Tong Lingyu's intentions, chuckling softly and directly pointing out the solution, giving her a push.</p><p>"They're both from the main lineage. Why does the Palace Master's position have to be from the Xuan Tian lineage? Yin Changsheng and Shang Lu committed grave errors, almost bringing Xuan Tian Gong to ruin. Were only a few the masterminds, or were there accomplices?"</p><p>By his nature, he preferred not to get involved in such matters; however, Xuan Tian Gong's cultivation resources were plentiful. Even a share from one main lineage would be more than enough for Qing Yang Guan.  </p><p>Qin Sang himself could also take advantage of the chaos to gain benefits.</p><p>Following the flow of events, he wouldn't refuse.</p><p>He didn't believe Tong Lingyu lacked ambition; he was simply voicing her thoughts.</p><p>Xuan Tian Gong needed a change!</p>
