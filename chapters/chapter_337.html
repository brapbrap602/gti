Chapter 330: Serenity Pill


The burly man still wore the same mask, with no other disguise, so Qin Sang recognized him immediately.

That inexplicable sense of familiarity, which had only appeared once during their first encounter, Qin Sang had dismissed as an illusion, not bothering to dwell on it.  Unexpectedly, he saw the man again here.

“I was just about to seal the hidden passage. Fellow Daoist, you almost arrived too late. Please, have a seat.”

The old man spoke as he waved his hand, casting a restrictive spell.

The entrance to the hidden chamber rippled with darkness. A wall grew out of thin air, sealing the entrance.

The burly man seemed to have rushed here, panting heavily. Without waiting to sit down, he anxiously asked, “Senior, you said a fellow Daoist was willing to trade a Serenity Pill for my Thousand-Vine Flowers. Is this true?”

Hearing this, Qin Sang understood.

Serenity Pills could also nourish the primordial spirit and heal the divine soul, although their effects were not as potent as the Heart-Calming Fruit. It seemed the burly man urgently needed this type of pill. Having failed to acquire one at the trading conference, he had settled for a Serenity Pill instead.

Judging by his tone, he had been invited here by the old man.

The old man's brow furrowed almost imperceptibly. He replied, "I never speak falsely. Indeed, a fellow Daoist possesses a Serenity Pill and wishes to trade it. However, whether a transaction can be reached depends on your negotiations. I am merely acting as an intermediary and a witness, and cannot guarantee anything else. Fellow Daoist, please be patient. The secret market will begin soon, and you will know whether my words are true or false."

At this moment, the person sitting to the old man's left suddenly spoke, "Senior, I see this fellow Daoist is indeed anxious. Since everyone is here, why don't we start this transaction with us, setting an example for the other fellow Daoists?"

The speaker wore a black robe that covered even their head, concealing their entire form. However, it couldn't hide their petite figure, which contrasted sharply with the burly man.

Judging by the voice, it was a female cultivator.

This woman seemed quite familiar with the old man, speaking with a degree of casualness.

The old man readily agreed, chuckling, "Since you say so, I will briefly explain the rules of the secret market, and then we shall begin. The rules are simple: everyone takes turns presenting the treasures they wish to trade and stating their conditions. If other fellow Daoists are interested, they may bid. The final decision on whether to trade rests with you; I will not interfere. During the transaction, we do not inquire about the origins of the treasures or the identities of the parties involved.  Goods and payment are exchanged simultaneously, and the matter is settled. No one may leave alone before the secret market concludes. Furthermore, although my cultivation is humble, I do possess certain means. I ask any fellow Daoists harboring ill intentions to abandon their schemes and avoid any unpleasantness..."

After this speech, the old man gestured to the female cultivator beside him. She leaned forward, addressing the restless burly man, "Fellow Daoist, I was not qualified to participate in the auction. I only learned today from this senior that you possess three Thousand-Vine Flowers, so I rushed here from the Yin Mountain Pass.  I do indeed possess a Serenity Pill, its potency intact and without any damage. I am willing to exchange it with you. Are you agreeable?"

The burly man nodded eagerly, "Yes, yes..."

He promptly retrieved the three Thousand-Vine Flowers and placed them on the table for display.

Inside the jade box were three plump blossoms. Although picked, they remained vibrant, attracting the gazes of the others.

At this point, someone tried to barter with the burly man, attempting to exchange other items for the Thousand-Vine Flowers, but they were all refused.

"I require nothing but spirit herbs that nourish the divine soul!"

Seeing this, the female cultivator didn't dare to wait any longer. She hastily nodded, "These are indeed mature Thousand-Vine Flowers. This is my Serenity Pill. Please examine it, fellow Daoist. If you have no other requests, we can proceed with the exchange now."

As she spoke, the female cultivator also took out a jade bottle containing a single, teardrop-shaped pill.

The burly man cautiously inspected the pill within the jade bottle, confirming it was indeed a Serenity Pill. He breathed a sigh of relief and was about to agree when someone suddenly interrupted.

"Hold on!"

A man wearing a wooden mask, seated further down, suddenly spoke. Ignoring the burly man's glare, he addressed the female cultivator, "Fellow Daoist, I am also interested in the Serenity Pill and am willing to offer a high-grade magical artifact exceeding the value of the Thousand-Vine Flowers.  Perhaps you might consider my offer before making a decision?"

As he spoke, the masked man placed a bronze ring artifact on the table, allowing others to examine it. It was indeed an exceptional high-grade magical artifact!

The others hadn't expected this turn of events and watched with interest.

The value of a Serenity Pill was certainly less than that of a high-grade magical artifact. However, for those in dire need, it was a priceless treasure. Coincidentally, both the burly man and the masked man urgently required this pill, making it a highly sought-after item.

"This..."

The female cultivator hesitated slightly, seemingly tempted by the high-grade magical artifact.

Seeing this, the burly man grew anxious, practically gripping the edge of the table as he stood up, "I also have magical artifacts! Give me the Serenity Pill, and I'll give you my artifacts too!"

The burly man hurriedly retrieved several artifacts from his storage pouch, allowing the female cultivator to choose freely. However, they were all upper-grade artifacts.

Now, the burly man's voice changed. His previous voice had been disguised, and his true voice was revealed in his urgency.

This was normal, and no one found it strange.

Only Qin Sang, upon hearing the burly man's true voice, abruptly focused his gaze. His eyes, hidden beneath the hood, scrutinized the burly man, as if trying to see through the mask to his true appearance.

Qin Sang's face displayed a mixture of surprise, bewilderment, and deep suspicion.

In stark contrast to the burly man's anxiety, the masked man spoke calmly, "Fellow Daoist, you should consider carefully. There are countless spirit herbs with similar effects to the Thousand-Vine Flowers, but the opportunity to exchange them for a high-grade magical artifact is rare. If I didn't need the Serenity Pill, I wouldn't be willing to make such a loss."

The female cultivator pondered for a moment, then bowed towards the masked man, saying apologetically, "Thank you for your generous offer, fellow Daoist. However, although the high-grade magical artifact is excellent, the Thousand-Vine Flowers are of great use to my cultivation. I apologize."

"A pity."

The masked man shook his head slightly, not pressing further or haggling. He retrieved his artifact.

The female cultivator turned her gaze to the burly man, "I am content to exchange the Serenity Pill for the Thousand-Vine Flowers and wouldn't dare to be greedy for your artifacts. If you have no objections, let us proceed with the exchange under the senior's witness."

The two handed their respective treasures to the old man, then each paid him spirit stones equivalent to ten percent of the item's value, completing the transaction.

The matter was settled, and neither party could renege.

After several twists and turns, the coveted Serenity Pill was finally in his possession.

The burly man couldn't conceal his excitement, clutching the jade bottle tightly, examining it repeatedly.  As the trading continued, even the appearance of more valuable treasures failed to pique his interest.

If not for the rule against leaving the secret market prematurely, he would likely have already departed.
