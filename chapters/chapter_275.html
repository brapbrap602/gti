Chapter 268: Reunion


At some point in time, the Fire Spirit Beasts had escaped the Spirit Totem Barrier and entered the lava rivers.
For example, in the volcanic crater, the circular restriction was damaged, and the Spirit Totem Barriers were still intact but were now broken.
What on earth had happened above?
Qin Sang was shocked, but more so worried.
These numerous Fire Spirit Beasts appeared out of nowhere, completely blocking Qin Sang's escape route. He wasn't afraid of the Firebirds, but he didn't dare charge forward against the flying Fire Apes and humanoid specters.
Moreover, it seemed as if the incident had originated from deep within the ancient immortal's mansion, so he couldn't risk putting himself in danger.
Perhaps it was a good thing that he hadn't stayed at the volcanic crater.
Qin Sang looked up at the circular restriction above his head. The restriction's light flickered erratically, constantly subjected to the impact of shockwaves that shook the ground and the lava, but it remained strong, and it was unclear when it would break.
Countless Fire Spirit Beasts relentlessly pursued him from behind, like caged beasts that had finally been set free. They hooted and hollered, frolicking and dancing in the lava, presenting a scene of apparent joy.
But Qin Sang knew very well that if they spotted him, their mood would instantly change, and they would become murderous!
He couldn't just wait there and had no choice but to be pushed forward.
The lava flowed more urgently, and although the Fire Spirit Beasts were seemingly just playing around, their speed wasn't slow at all. Qin Sang exerted all of his efforts and could only barely keep a short distance away from them.
He swallowed a Green Spirit Pellet and checked. He still had plenty of Spirit Pellets left, so he didn't need to worry about running out of spiritual energy in the short term. But where should he go?
If he couldn't find any breaks in the circular restriction along the way, he could only continue fleeing until he eventually escaped the range of the ancient immortal's mansion, which is something that Qin Sang didn't want to see happen.
Qin Sang pondered to himself. Judging by the intensity of the shaking from behind, he estimated that this incident was quite serious. If there was a weak spot in the circular restriction, it was very possible that it might split open, or even break.
He might be able to escape from there.
But the only weak point that Qin Sang knew of was below the second level's trial.
The trial space and the ancient immortal's mansion were very likely two spaces separated by the restriction.
Qin Sang couldn't be sure if the exact location of the trial space corresponded with the ancient immortal's mansion. If it did, it should be near the stone tablet.
In any case, he had to go and take a look.
Qin Sang quickly calculated his current location. Since entering the ancient immortal's mansion, he had carefully memorized every path he had taken and every turn he had made, creating a simple map in his mind with up and down correspondences.
He was now heading southeast and had already deviated from the direction of the stone tablet.
Qin Sang quickly scanned the various tributaries ahead of him, chose one, and flashed into it.
There were countless lava river tributaries that intersected with each other, forming a complex network. Qin Sang changed routes several times and finally adjusted his direction, flying straight towards the stone tablet.
Unexpectedly, while Qin Sang was fleeing, he discovered that Fire Spirit Beasts were also appearing from other directions, which greatly worried him. His greatest fear had come to pass. The cave with the Redgold Vine wasn't an isolated case. There were many similar places deep underground in the ancient immortal's mansion that housed Fire Spirit Beasts.
The circular restrictions there had definitely been broken, but Qin Sang didn't dare go there because these Fire Spirit Beasts weren't just a single type of Firebird. All three types of Fire Spirit Beasts had gathered together.
Qin Sang was forced to adjust his direction, but although he avoided the misfortune of being blocked, the available maneuvering space became smaller and smaller, and he was gradually drawing nearer to the Fire Spirit Beasts.
He swallowed one Spirit Pellet after another.
Qin Sang transformed into a sword light that cut through layers of giant waves and didn't dare pause for even a moment. The spiritual energy from the Spirit Pellets that he swallowed was immediately used up and almost couldn't keep up with the consumption of the Ebonywood Sword, causing his sea of qi to feel waves of sharp pain.
If only he could use the Nine Dragons Sky Carriage Talisman.
Qin Sang chuckled at himself and continued to desperately flee.
Suddenly, a deafening roar of waves could be heard ahead. The appearance of this sound meant that there would be a great lava lake ahead. As soon as this thought crossed Qin Sang's mind, his vision suddenly opened up, and he had already entered the lava lake.
This great lake was the largest one that Qin Sang had seen since jumping into the lava; it was countless times larger than the cave and had lava rivers flowing into it from every direction. The surface of the lake stretched as far as the eye could see, like a sea of lava.
This wasn't necessarily a good thing. There was no cover here, and his vision was wide open. Openly flying on the sword made it easy for him to be discovered by Fire Spirit Beasts.
Unsurprisingly, shortly after Qin Sang entered the lava lake, he saw the silhouettes of Fire Spirit Beasts appearing among the waves of the distant shore.

As Qin Sang was about to get close to the heart of the lake, he suddenly heard an ear-piercing roar.
In shock, he looked back and saw a dazzling white light streaking out from a lava river, followed closely from behind by a raging Fire Beast. They swarmed out from the mouth of the lava river, their numbers growing all the time, seemingly endless. Countless Fire Beasts screeched as they lunged into the lava lake, instantly throwing the sea of lava into chaos.
Qin Sang swore under his breath at the sight.
Not having time to dwell on why there was anyone else here, he urged his Wumu sword to escape with all his might without hesitation. In the midst of the chaos, he stole a glance at the light in the distance and his face suddenly hardened, subconsciously slowing down a little.
The white light was extremely fast, and even the raging Fire Beasts couldn’t catch up. Soon, it was level with Qin Sang.
At this point, the person piloting the light finally noticed Qin Sang, who had been keeping a low profile and escaping the whole time.
"Huh?"
A surprised voice came from the light, then it paused slightly and the light suddenly dispersed, revealing an elderly figure.
It was the Cloud Wanderer who had been piloting the spirit bamboo boat!
"Brother Qin?"
The two looked at each other, both extremely surprised.
"Senior, what are you doing here?"
Qin Sang asked first.
As soon as he saw the light, he had a feeling that the energy fluctuations were familiar, very much like Cloud Wanderer’s spirit bamboo boat. Only the spirit bamboo boat could be this fast.
Under these circumstances, the more helpers he had, the better his chances of escaping, so Qin Sang slowed down and waited.
It really was Cloud Wanderer!
"This old man discovered a spirit medicine underground, and just as I was about to try and pick it, the ground suddenly collapsed, the circular restriction shattered and I accidentally fell into the lava river. I didn’t have time to get away and was surrounded by Fire Beasts. All I could do was keep running forward…"
Cloud Wanderer had only spoken halfway when he was suddenly interrupted by a scream.
The Fire Beasts had finally caught up. Cloud Wanderer’s expression changed slightly and he exclaimed, "Brother Qin, quick! Get on the bamboo boat, don’t let these creatures surround us!"
Qin Sang’s eyes flickered, and after some silent contemplation, he nodded, sheathed his sword and flashed onto the spirit bamboo boat.
"To think that I would meet Brother Qin again under the same circumstances."
Cloud Wanderer sighed with emotion, a hint of joy in his voice, "This old man has run out of spirit pills and almost ended up with my spiritual energy exhausted. How fortunate that I met Brother Qin! We can take turns piloting the bamboo boat and we won’t have to worry about being surrounded by these creatures."
