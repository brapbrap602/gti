<h1>Chapter 590 Bone Flute</h1><p>The Flying Night Devil was in the midst of transformation and couldn't intervene, leaving Qin Sang to handle the situation alone.  </p><p>However, breaking the restriction wasn't as strenuous as combat, and his Corpse Pill could sustain him, so Qin Sang agreed.</p><p>Just then, Qin Sang noticed a flicker of hesitation on Yun Youzi's face.</p><p>As he wondered about it, Yun Youzi asked, "Brother Qin, did Yi Tiannie tell you anything about the Three Lights Jade Nectar?"</p><p>Yun Youzi had helped him so much; there was no need to hide anything.</p><p>Moreover, obtaining the Three Lights Jade Nectar alone would be difficult; he needed Yun Youzi's assistance.</p><p>The tasks related to Duke Dongyang and Chen Yan loomed over Qin Sang, preventing him from acting freely.</p><p>The wooden bracelet could only suppress the mark for a limited time.</p><p>Their journey into the ancient medicinal garden hadn't taken long. If not for the two unexpected battles, they would have had ample time.</p><p>Now, every second counted. He still needed to visit the place where Senior Qingzhu disappeared to search for the subsequent cultivation techniques.</p><p>The follow-up techniques of the "Primordial Spirit Sword Nurturing Chapter" and the Nine Phantasmal Sky Orchid, one was the foundation of his immortal path, and the other was his future hope of Nascent Soul formation. Qin Sang couldn't say which was more important.</p><p>He wanted both.</p><p>But time wouldn't allow it. The location of the Three Lights Jade Nectar wasn't easy to access. Even with Yi Tiannie's memories, it would take considerable effort.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't accomplish this alone within the given time; he needed Yun Youzi's help.</p><p>With this in mind, Qin Sang didn't dare waste any more time and quickly said to Yun Youzi, "Senior, I indeed learned of an ancient ruin where the Three Lights Jade Nectar might exist. Time is of the essence; let's talk as we walk."</p><p>He placed the Crimson Cloud Purple Fruit into a jade box and stored it away. Refining the spiritual fruit and preparing for Core Formation would require time, which he didn't have.</p><p>Yun Youzi understood the urgency and agreed, setting off with Qin Sang.</p><p>Just as they were about to leave, Qin Sang suddenly remembered something. He took out the jade pendant left by Yi Tiannie and examined it.</p><p>The crescent-shaped jade wasn't clear and pure but rather cloudy, with a milky white appearance.</p><p>Holding it, he felt a warmth permeate his body.</p><p>It was a warming jade.</p><p>This warmth was unique. After entering his body, it extended to his Primordial Spirit space, giving his spirit a warm, nourished feeling.</p><p>"This should be a Spirit Warming Jade."</p><p>Yun Youzi recognized the jade.</p><p>"When the soul leaves the body, if it's too weak and unable to return for an extended period, its consciousness will gradually dissipate, eventually becoming a lost soul, forever adrift.</p><p>"Although Yi Tiannie cultivated ghost arts, he was ambushed and left with only a remnant soul, facing the same risk.</p><p>"This warming jade can nourish the soul and maintain the body's vitality. Yi Tiannie hid his soul within it to prevent its dissipation.</p><p>"Its effects are somewhat similar to the Soul Nurturing Wood, one of the Ten Divine Trees.</p><p>"However, the Soul Nurturing Wood is far more powerful. It not only shelters remnant souls but also nourishes cultivators' Primordial Spirits and strengthens their divine sense. It's a rare treasure.</p><p>"If this old man could obtain a piece of Soul Nurturing Wood, I wouldn't need to go back and forth like this.</p><p>"Although this item isn't as good as the Soul Nurturing Wood, it's still a valuable treasure. Keep it safe, Brother Qin. If you encounter someone who needs it, you might be able to sell it for a good price."</p><p>It sounded somewhat similar to the crystal coffin he had given the Tan brothers, but its effects were far more potent.</p><p>Qin Sang replied with a murmur and stored the warming jade, his mind dwelling on the Soul Nurturing Wood.</p><p>Refining a piece of the Infernal Blood Mulberry had brought incredible benefits that would last him a lifetime. The other divine trees must have similar wondrous effects.</p><p>The Soul Nurturing Wood Yun Youzi mentioned was one of them.</p><p>It was said that even a mortal soul residing within the Soul Nurturing Wood could maintain its integrity and consciousness, a truly miraculous feat.</p><p>The Ebony Sword already resided within his Primordial Spirit. If he could refine a piece of Soul Nurturing Wood and integrate it into the sword, it could continuously nourish and strengthen his Primordial Spirit.</p><p>Over time, his divine sense would surely surpass cultivators of the same realm.</p><p>Qin Sang had long coveted the Ten Divine Trees, but he could only dream.</p><p>They were incredibly rare, and the Soul Nurturing Wood was only a legend. There had been no news of its appearance in the cultivation world.</p><p>Putting away the crescent-shaped warming jade, Qin Sang extended a wisp of spiritual energy to support the weakened Yun Youzi and flew out of the stone hall.</p><p>"Huh?"</p><p>Just as they exited, Qin Sang caught a glimpse of a golden glint in a crevice near the lakeshore. He paused and looked over.</p><p>"What's that?"</p><p>With a wave of his hand, a curved gold bar flew out of the crevice. Qin Sang was puzzled; it hadn't been there before.</p><p>Seeing the gold bar, Qin Sang suddenly remembered the gold ring, resembling a collar, around the leopard's neck.</p><p>During the fight, he had been wary of the ring, but after realizing it wasn't a magical tool, he had dismissed it.</p><p>The Void Thunder explosion had struck the leopard's upper body, obliterating its left foreleg and exposing its neck bones. It seemed the gold ring hadn't survived either, shattered by the blast.</p><p>The Shadow Devouring Leopard, having narrowly escaped death, was terrified and focused on fleeing, forgetting the broken gold ring.</p><p>Carried by a mid-Core Formation Shadow Devouring Leopard, could it be a treasure?</p><p>Qin Sang picked up the gold ring and was about to examine it when he felt it lighten in his hand. A white, bone-like object fell out.</p><p>The gold ring was hollow, and the metal itself wasn't special, merely sturdy, serving to conceal the white bone.</p><p>Qin Sang examined it closely.</p><p>The bone was small, about the size of a human finger bone. Although white, it wasn't pale but had a jade-like, oily luster.</p><p>It didn't resemble a bone at all.</p><p>Human finger bones were wider at the ends, but this bone was uniform in size and hollow in the middle. Except for the lack of finger holes, it looked exactly like a bone flute.</p><p>Qin Sang turned it over, unable to discern its purpose. Why would the Shadow Devouring Leopard wear it around its neck instead of storing it in a storage tool?</p><p>He didn't believe a mid-Core Formation demon wouldn't have one.</p><p>Just then, Yun Youzi murmured, "Brother Qin, let me see that."</p><p>Qin Sang handed it over.</p><p>Yun Youzi examined it for a moment, then asked, "Brother Qin, do you sense a power emanating from this bone flute, similar to another object?"</p><p>Qin Sang's heart stirred, "Senior, are you referring to the Star Origin Stones?"</p><p>He had sensed something similar but wasn't certain.</p><p>Yun Youzi nodded, "This bone flute seems to have a faint connection to the starry sky. It might be a treasure capable of channeling the power of the celestial stars. Whether it's a magical tool or holds some other secret is unknown."</p>
