<h1>## Chapter 1060: Searching for the Remains</h1><p>A network of riverbeds crisscrossed the valley. Traces of waterfalls etched into the mountain slopes, all long since dried up.  Yet here, a lake brimming with water, its surface mirrored the sky. The surrounding trees, petrified into a stone forest, reflected eerily in the lake's surface. Not a single living plant remained.</p><p>"The Spirit Suppression Domain has toxic pools, filled with a terrible poison. And there's more than one. I suspect the toxins permeating the valley originate from these pools."  The armored giant's expression was grave, hesitant. Their secret technique pointed them to search for the remains within a toxic pool.</p><p>"Have the humans explored these pools? What lies beneath?" The Dragon King gazed into the dark, unfathomable depths.</p><p>The armored giant shook his head. "Such secrets are closely guarded, unlikely to be revealed…"</p><p>"Then we must investigate ourselves."  The Dragon King's golden armor vibrated, absorbing layers of golden light, thickening it several times over until he was completely encased. Even he wouldn't underestimate the dangers of the toxic pool.</p><p>*Splash!*  The Dragon King plunged into the lake, the golden armor submerged in the venomous liquid.</p><p>*Hiss…*  Corroded by the intense poison, the armor quickly pitted and scarred. Layers of golden light extinguished, the toxicity far exceeding that in the air above.</p><p>The armored giant followed, the image of the Black Tortoise on his shell rapidly inhaling and exhaling to counter the corrosive effects.</p><p>Without delay, the two demons descended.  The pool proved deeper than they imagined, and the bottom stretched out into a vast expanse.  Exploring further, they reached the edge, only to discover a network of interconnected underground rivers branching out in all directions.  The entire subterranean area of the Spirit Suppression Domain was likely a web of toxic waterways, connecting the pools.</p><p>*Splash!* They resurfaced. The situation was tricky. Retrieving the dragon remains meant prolonged exposure to the corrosive liquid. Fortunately, they hadn't encountered any beasts or other threats below.</p><p>After a brief discussion, they decided to take turns shielding against the poison. Guided by their secret technique, they were confident they could endure.  After a short rest, they returned to the shore. The Dragon King shed his armor, and the armored giant expanded a protective barrier around both of them before they re-entered the toxic pool.</p><p>This time, following the guidance of the secret technique, they quickly found an underground river and navigated through the complex network, changing course repeatedly.  They took turns shielding each other.</p><p>After traveling an unknown distance beneath the surface, their breathing grew labored, the effort to resist the toxic water increasing. The poison not only corroded the body but also the spirit. Without the guidance leading them to the dragon remains, they wouldn't have been able to navigate the intricate, poisonous waterways.</p><p>They emerged into a vast underground lake.  At the bottom lay a large stone.  Moving it revealed a square stone door, seamlessly blended with the lakebed, easily overlooked.</p><p>The secret technique pointed beyond this door!</p><p>"This is it!" They rejoiced.</p><p>Reaching the door, the Dragon King pushed gently. It didn't budge, a faint shimmer of light flashing across its surface.  Exchanging a look, they declared in unison, "A barrier!"</p><p>"Focus on breaking the barrier! Don't worry about the poison. I can hold out a little longer," the armored giant said, eyes gleaming. The dragon remains were likely just beyond.</p><p>The Dragon King concentrated, attempting to decipher and break the barrier, but without success. The armored giant grew anxious.  Suddenly, the Dragon King's face lit up. "It's an ancient demon barrier!"</p><p>"What? Not a human barrier?" The armored giant was astonished.</p><p>"Intact and still powerful. If it were a human barrier, we would be out of luck. But a demon barrier… the remains are rightfully ours!" The Dragon King laughed.</p><p>…</p><p>An unknown underground cavern.</p><p>A group of Wu cultivators emerged from a teleportation array, immediately activating their protective measures.  Safe and sound, they quickly formed a defensive formation, cautiously scanning their surroundings. They had been transported underground, the array situated within a cavern, on a square stone platform. There was nothing else.</p><p>The cavern appeared natural, with rough, uneven rock walls and an irregular shape, devoid of any signs of human construction. No pillars, Wu formations, or barriers.  A deathly silence hung in the air, as if no one had entered for ages.  They were surprised, expecting a Wu ruin, not this.</p><p>An exit led to a tunnel, its far end shrouded in darkness, the faint sound of flowing water echoing from within.  After a brief discussion, Old Devil Fang, as usual, took the lead.</p><p>Reaching the tunnel's end, they discovered a well, filled with water, seemingly an entrance to an underground river.</p><p>A Wu Nascent Soul cultivator sent a pulse of spiritual energy into the water, which was visibly corroded at an alarming rate.</p><p>"A toxic river!" He exclaimed, startled. "Incredibly potent!"</p><p>"Why would our ancestors' teleportation array lead to a dead end? Should we investigate our location?" someone suggested, looking upward.</p><p>"No!" The Grand Shaman interrupted decisively, a thoughtful expression on his face.  "I know where we are. Only one place in the valley has toxic pools: the Spirit Suppression Domain.  This toxic river must be connected to those pools. We must be near it. The Spirit Suppression Domain is one of the humans' most guarded secret realms. We cannot act rashly."</p><p>"The Spirit Suppression Domain?" The Nascent Soul cultivators, seeing the Grand Shaman's serious demeanor, held back.</p><p>"How much do you know about this domain?" Old Devil Fang suddenly asked.</p><p>"Not much," the Grand Shaman admitted. "The humans are secretive about these realms.  I only found vague rumors suggesting a peculiar power within the Spirit Suppression Domain, navigable only by late-stage Nascent Soul cultivators, or those at the peak of the mid-stage."</p><p>"So, only the Grand Shaman and Fellow Daoist Fang can enter?"  The others stirred uneasily.  "We haven't felt anything unusual. Perhaps the rumors are exaggerated.  We could all explore and retreat if we encounter any obstacles."</p><p>"Very well…"  The Grand Shaman didn't object.</p><p>Descending into the toxic river, they quickly discovered the potency of the poison and were forced to retreat.  Uncertain of the situation below and with the river branching out, they proceeded cautiously, taking turns scouting.</p><p>Repeated explorations revealed that all branches converged into a large underground lake.</p><p>Old Devil Fang, leading a few Nascent Soul cultivators into the lake, suddenly sensed a strange fluctuation followed by a scream.  Without looking back, he confirmed the fluctuation didn't affect him and moved towards the source.</p><p>Caught off guard by the sudden suppression of the Spirit Suppression Domain within the toxic lake, one of the Wu Nascent Soul cultivators was unable to resist the corrosive water.  His body dissolved instantly, leaving only his Nascent Soul, which Old Devil Fang managed to save.  The others, barely able to protect themselves, were injured.</p>
