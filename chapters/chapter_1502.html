<h1>Chapter 1493: The Blood Pool of Slaughter (4k)</h1><p>No one could have predicted such a strange transformation upon touching the cicada shell.</p><p>Qin Sang, always cautious, remained vigilant against the ancient prohibition’s potential changes and attacks, but he hadn't anticipated a sudden and powerful suction force.</p><p>He found himself suspended in mid-air, surrounded by the ancient prohibition, with nowhere to anchor himself. Unable to resist the suction, he was pulled in instantly.</p><p>A wave of dizziness washed over Qin Sang. He struggled to maintain his balance, activating the Ruyi Treasure Pearl, attempting repeatedly to break free from the suction, but to no avail.  He had to prioritize self-preservation.</p><p>‘Whoosh…whoosh…’</p><p>Qin Sang heard the rushing wind, sensing a rapid descent.</p><p>He couldn't discern his direction, unsure where he was being pulled.</p><p>The good news was that his protective barrier was incredibly strong. Besides the suction, there were no other attacks, and he remained unharmed.</p><p>“What caused this change?  Could the cicada shell be a key to some hidden realm?”</p><p>With Qin Sang temporarily safe, these thoughts raced through his mind.</p><p>A moment before, upon touching the cicada shell, Qin Sang had sensed that it wasn't simply from an Eight-Winged Heart Cicada; it seemed to bear signs of having been ritually refined.</p><p>Before he could examine it further, the transformation occurred.</p><p>Just then, Qin Sang noticed something unusual nearby.  He caught sight of a blurry figure in his peripheral vision.</p><p>His expression changed, his guard instantly heightened. Then he recognized the somewhat disheveled figure – Liuli, who should have been at the Gluttonous Lake!</p><p>Liuli, though possessing defensive treasures, lacked the comprehensive protection of the Ruyi Treasure Pearl.</p><p>She struggled against the suction force, her clothes disarrayed.</p><p>Noticing an uninvited guest nearby, Liuli's eyes narrowed in suspicion.  Recognizing Qin Sang, her expression relaxed slightly, conveying a questioning look.</p><p>The two of them, who should have been miles apart, were now drawn to the same place.</p><p>They were like dancers in a chaotic, uncontrolled waltz within the suction force, constantly tumbling, their movements utterly disorganized.</p><p>They struggled to approach each other, to avoid being separated by the turbulent currents.</p><p>Faced with this unknown event, their combined strength in handling the danger was clearly superior to that of either alone.</p><p>Qin Sang opened his palm to Liuli, revealing the cicada shell.</p><p>At the moment the suction erupted, Qin Sang hadn't forgotten his mission; he had secured the Eight-Winged Heart Cicada shell as quickly as possible.</p><p>The cicada shell was the key.</p><p>Liuli, who cultivated the Ice Soul Divine Light, might be able to discern something from it.</p><p>Upon seeing the cicada shell, Liuli's eyes lit up.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>Suddenly, the suction vanished.</p><p>They were both thrown into an unfamiliar space.</p><p>Qin Sang reacted swiftly, instantly stabilizing himself, overcoming the inertia of the suction.</p><p>Before he could get a clear view of his surroundings, he flicked his sleeve, unleashing his demonic flames.  They roared into existence, forming a fiery dragon that coiled around him, a defensive posture.</p><p>‘Bang!’</p><p>Qin Sang landed heavily on the ground.</p><p>The sound echoed in the surroundings.</p><p>Clearly, this was an enclosed space.</p><p>A faint, unusual scent of blood tickled his nose.</p><p>Qin Sang furrowed his brows, his vigilance heightened.</p><p>Then Liuli landed beside him, transmitting her voice, “According to the ancient texts of the Listening Snow Tower, this is the molted shell of an Eight-Winged Ice Cicada; it has an effect on the Ice Soul Divine Light…”</p><p>Eight-Winged Ice Cicada and Eight-Winged Heart Cicada – differing by only one word, they both referred to the same kind of spirit insect; only the descriptions in different traditions varied.</p><p>The Eight-Winged Heart Cicada's appearance resembled ice sculptures, making the name "Ice Cicada" more descriptive.</p><p>Before Liuli finished, a voice interrupted.</p><p>“All these years, you’ve been relentlessly buying off various sect masters, eliminating dissenters—truly diligent. Even without this sacred site incident, you would have attacked me after we left, wouldn't you? Now, with your power grown and your audacity boundless, you dare to conspire with them to assassinate me within the sacred grounds. Sadly, I have schemed for hundreds of years for this day.  I won't let a little girl like you easily ruin it…”</p><p>The speaker's voice was hoarse and cold, like a demonic incantation.</p><p>Someone else was here!</p><p>The mere sound sent a chill down Liuli's spine, as if she was being frozen solid. She instinctively summoned her phoenix-shaped sword, remaining on high alert.</p><p>Meanwhile, Qin Sang stood beside Liuli, his gaze sharp as a sword, intently focusing on the front, ready for battle.</p><p>They had been sucked into a cavernous underground chamber, standing at its edge.</p><p>The smell of blood Qin Sang had detected wasn’t an illusion. Within the cavern, a circular pool of blood filled the space.  Crimson blood was overflowing.</p><p>Three ice platforms rose from within the blood pool.</p><p>The platforms were covered in dense, intricate runes, all traced with thin lines of blood.</p><p>A bloody glow illuminated the icy platforms, transforming them into crimson altars, an eerie and horrifying sight.</p><p>This bizarre scene deeply shocked Qin Sang and Liuli.</p><p>Most shockingly, a person was slumped on one of the platforms.  It was Tong Lingyu, the Grand Elder of Xuan Tian Palace!</p><p>Tong Lingyu was a shadow of her former self.  Covered in blood, weak and severely wounded, her pretty face bore two deep cuts, making her look pitifully vulnerable.</p><p>Crimson threads sprouted from the ice, piercing deep into Tong Lingyu's legs.  Her legs were now completely ensnared, immobilizing her.  These threads relentlessly spread towards her body, like chains or bloodworms, draining her vitality and dragging her towards the abyss.</p><p>Tong Lingyu had almost lost her ability to fight back, allowing the threads to consume her.  Her powerful spiritual treasure, the Four-Riding Serpent Seal, lay discarded at the edge of the blood pool, beyond her reach.  She awaited her death.</p><p>The scene was terrifying and heartbreaking.</p><p>The voice wasn't Tong Lingyu's; it came from an opened ice coffin at the edge of the blood pool.  The figure inside, however, remained within, shrouded in swirling mist, its form slightly blurred.</p><p>Clad in white robes and a jade crown, the figure was strikingly handsome, yet deathly pale with visible blue veins, looking far from human.  This stark contrast to the blood-soaked Tong Lingyu was jarring.</p><p>The Four-Riding Serpent Seal lay at the figure's feet, as if in submission.</p><p>In the vast cavern, only Qin Sang, Liuli, and the two figures – the one in the coffin and Tong Lingyu – were present.  No other Xuan Tian Palace cultivators were to be seen.</p><p>Upon seeing the figure, Qin Sang's pupils constricted.  He recognized the appearance from Shi Xue's description: it was Yin Changsheng, the Palace Master of Xuan Tian Palace!</p><p>The eerie scene made Qin Sang's heart pound, filling him with a sense of impending doom.  He felt an overwhelming sense of danger emanating from the Palace Master, a feeling stronger than anything he had experienced even facing the Hun Mo Old Man or the Tian Peng Saint.</p><p>Demonic forces had invaded the sacred grounds.  Instead of repelling the invaders, the two leaders of Xuan Tian Palace were engaged in an internal struggle.</p><p>The area outside the blood pool was a chaotic mess.  Icicles littered the ground, evidence of a fierce battle. Tong Lingyu's defeat was absolute; she had lost her treasure and was captured and trapped in the blood pool.</p><p>What had happened?  Why were he and Liuli brought here to witness this?</p><p>The cicada molt…it was a trap!</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly recalled Bing Yao's warning to Liuli: "Beware the Palace Master!"</p><p>This trap was likely intended for Bing Yao.  She probably hadn't realized the cicada molt was a trap, otherwise, she would have warned Liuli and not allowed her to return for the treasure.  However, sensing the danger from the Palace Master, she fled to Bei Chen Realm, later becoming trapped in Zi Wei Palace, escaping by a stroke of luck.  He and Liuli had unwittingly taken her place.</p><p>What was the Palace Master's goal?  Were the other two platforms in the blood pool meant for him and Liuli?</p><p>Was this even Yin Changsheng?  Why would the Palace Master attack rising talents within the sect?</p><p>Thoughts raced through Qin Sang's mind.  Having witnessed demonic possession in the Seven Killing Hall, he was acutely aware of such things and immediately suspected foul play, especially given the existence of a demon-sealing site in the North Sea.</p><p>However, these were insignificant.  Qin Sang's only thought now was to escape the cavern!</p><p>Seeing Tong Lingyu's fate despite her powerful treasure, Qin Sang wouldn't underestimate himself, but he didn't believe he could defeat the Palace Master with the Sun God Tree, which he couldn't fully control.  If the Palace Master had been possessed, possessing the power of that ancient demon soul, it would be even more terrifying!</p><p>Qin Sang's spiritual sense swept behind him, causing his face to change.  After they were drawn in, the suction and the entrance had mysteriously disappeared.  The cavern was filled with ancient restrictions; entry was easy, but exit was difficult.</p><p>Remaining calm, Qin Sang covertly used the Sky Eye Butterfly to search for an escape route.</p><p>In the blood pool, Tong Lingyu's breathing became ragged, her defenses failing as the blood threads invaded her.  A bitter smile touched her lips.  "You hadn't entered the sacred grounds in two years. I knew you would eventually act against me. I just didn't expect you to choose this place.  If I'd known, I wouldn't have wasted so much time confirming your injuries."</p><p>"I'm curious. How did you figure it out? All these years, besides secretly guiding you in special cultivation methods, I haven't interfered with you in the least."</p><p>Yin Changsheng seemed not to notice Qin Sang and Liuli at the edge of the cavern, or perhaps he simply didn't care.</p><p>He lowered his head slightly, his icy tone wavering for the first time.  He wondered where he'd slipped up, while Tong Lingyu was certain their Palace Master harbored ill intentions.</p><p>Demon invasion.</p><p>Tong Lingyu saw her chance.</p><p>She'd originally planned to act after returning from the Sacred Land, and had been preparing for it. Now, with the Sacred Land in chaos, it was the perfect opportunity to use the Hun Mo Elder and the Tian Peng Sage to test Yin Changsheng.</p><p>If the opportunity arose, she would kill Yin Changsheng without hesitation.</p><p>Xuan Tian Palace was facing internal and external strife.</p><p>She could only choose to deal with the internal problems first.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Yin Changsheng was one step ahead, striking first, catching Tong Lingyu off guard and capturing her.</p><p>Hearing this, Qin Sang understood.</p><p>At the entrance to the Sacred Land, Tong Lingyu had sent a message asking him to meet her deep within, not at the Palace Master's behest, but to enlist his help in killing the Palace Master.</p><p>Qin Sang muttered, "No wonder."</p><p>After the Hun Mo Assembly, Tong Lingyu readily agreed to all his requests, bringing him into the Tingxue Tower's faction and deliberately concealing his identity within Xuan Tian Palace.</p><p>When he and Liuli became Dao companions, Tong Lingyu stopped them at the foot of Lingxiao Peak, preventing him from directly confronting the Palace Master.</p><p>Although the reasons seemed plausible,</p><p>each and every incident bore the marks of Tong Lingyu's guidance, keeping him out of the Palace Master's sight, allowing for a surprise attack later.</p><p>"Before Ice Remote left, she subtly warned me to be careful. I didn't understand then, I wasn't vigilant. I never imagined that the Palace Master, the master I'd respected since childhood, would harbor ill intentions towards us!"</p><p>Tong Lingyu's voice was filled with a complex mix of emotions, including pain.</p><p>Yin Changsheng, who commanded the North Sea and possessed an unparalleled bearing in the cultivation world, commanded respect from all.</p><p>Within Xuan Tian Palace, Yin Changsheng was a pillar of strength, a respected master, deeply caring for his juniors.</p><p>Was it all an illusion?</p><p>All a charade?</p><p>"Ice Remote…"</p><p>Yin Changsheng's voice was low and mournful, remembering the long-forgotten name.  "Of all of you, she was the one I held in highest regard. She was intelligent, with sharp intuition.  Unfortunately, after her disappearance, I never found her again. Thankfully, she trained a capable disciple. However, that wasn't enough for her to uncover my scheme."</p><p>Tong Lingyu took a deep breath. "Then, I became more cautious, until… when Senior Brother Luo Yun attempted to break through to the late Yuan Ying stage, the Xuan Tian lineage claimed his breakthrough failed, resulting in his death from backlash. That's when I was certain it was you!"</p><p>"Luo Yun!"</p><p>Yin Changsheng was taken aback.</p><p>"You knew from then. I wasn't cautious enough, I didn't notice your clandestine observation. First, the demonic possession, then the injury inflicted by the mysterious expert—it was all your doing, intentionally suppressing your cultivation to the peak of mid-Yuan Ying…  It's admirable that you could endure for so long. Having you as a Grand Elder should have been a boon for Xuan Tian Palace."</p><p>Yin Changsheng sighed softly.</p><p>Before he finished speaking, the icy mist in the coffin swirled. Yin Changsheng waved his arm, and a piece of black ice flew from his sleeve, landing on another ice platform.</p><p>A handsome young man was encased within the ice.</p><p>The man's aura was that of a late Yuan Ying cultivator!</p><p>The moment it landed, crimson blood vessels spread wildly upward, effortlessly piercing the ice, quickly covering his entire body.</p><p>The young man's eyelids fluttered slightly, as if still alive.</p><p>"Senior Brother Luo Yun!"</p><p>Tong Lingyu cried out softly, her pain deepening. "Senior Brother Luo Yun held you in such high esteem, considered you his master, how could you bear to do this!"</p><p>Her tearful accusation seemed a last-ditch effort, to awaken a spark of conscience in Yin Changsheng.</p><p>"If only Ice Remote hadn't disappeared, if only Senior Brother Luo Yun hadn't been murdered by you…</p><p>"Our generation should have produced at least three Grand Cultivators!</p><p>"How prosperous would Xuan Tian Palace have been?</p><p>"All destroyed by your selfish desires!</p><p>"Where is the Palace Master everyone respected?</p><p>"Was it… worth it?"</p><p>Worth it?</p><p>Worth it?</p><p>…</p><p>The questions echoed in the stone cave.</p><p>Yin Changsheng's expression remained unchanged, but he fell silent for a moment.</p><p>"What does destroying a generation matter!"</p><p>Yin Changsheng's voice was colder than before, tinged with madness, a harsh roar.</p><p>"To help me achieve Ascension, your deaths were worthwhile!"</p><p>Tong Lingyu was utterly despairing of Yin Changsheng, and closed her eyes in pain.</p><p>"You weren't injured in a tribulation; you should have died centuries ago. To prolong your life, you used forbidden arts to avoid the tribulation, sealing yourself in an ice coffin, committing an act against heaven. The forbidden arts have driven you mad; now you are using them to break through! You've gone insane; you are no longer Yin Changsheng! You will absolutely not succeed!"</p><p>Icy mist swirled.</p><p>Yin Changsheng let out a cold snort, his expression growing increasingly frantic. "Though you've confined yourself to the mid-Yuan Ying stage, your spiritual sense has reached the Transformation stage, and your cultivation has the essence comparable to a Grand Cultivator. You can barely support the Lu Yin Blood Pool, but you will witness it. As for the other ice platform…"</p><p>Yin Changsheng finally shifted his gaze, looking directly at Qin Sang and Liuli for the first time!</p>
