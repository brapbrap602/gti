<h1></h1><p>Demonfire drifted towards the Gu King, forming a small ring of fire, encircling it.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the Gu King was exceedingly ferocious.</p><p>Without its master's suppression, its truly savage nature was revealed.</p><p>Its prey blocked by the demonfire, the Gu King flew into a rage.</p><p>Fury caused its wings to vibrate rapidly, producing a piercing buzzing sound.</p><p>Impacted by the aura of the demonfire, the Gu King showed no fear, instead, it opened its mandibles wide, spraying venomous light, counter-attacking the demonfire.</p><p>“The venomous light is potent, but excessively ferocious, its intelligence seems rather low! This fellow truly cultivated a savage beast!”</p><p>Qin Sang surrounded the Gu King with demonfire, not rushing to subdue it, but instead flashed towards the strange-faced man's Nascent Soul.</p><p>Seeing the strange-faced man's condition, a deep astonishment flashed across Qin Sang's eyes.</p><p>In such a short time, the strange-faced man's state had deteriorated to an extremely critical point. His Nascent Soul was ashen, and barely any life force could be sensed.</p><p>The Gu King’s venom might be even more terrifying than Qin Sang had imagined!</p><p>“Eh? That's not right…”</p><p>Qin Sang's divine sense swept over him, and he was surprised to discover that the toxin threatening the strange-faced man's life seemed to be only one kind, currently wreaking havoc within him. The destructive power of the toxin could be described as terrifying, capable of killing someone in an instant!</p><p>The strange-faced man had been successively struck by the poisons of Myriad Poison Mountain and the Gu King's venomous light; there should be two toxins within his body.</p><p>“Could it be that the two poisons fused on their own?”</p><p>A flash of inspiration struck Qin Sang, and he thought of a possibility.</p><p>The Gu King's aura was very similar to the Gu insects cultivated by Myriad Poison Mountain's *Gu Scripture*. Myriad Poison Mountain regarded the strange-faced man as a sworn enemy, and they were willing to give treasures to restrain him to unrelated individuals. The Gu King was their primary target!</p><p>Perhaps, the Gu King was meticulously cultivated by Myriad Poison Mountain.</p><p>Once the Gu King reached its peak, the venomous light and Myriad Poison Mountain's supreme poison would merge, and the resulting toxicity would surge to an unimaginable degree, becoming the strongest poison in the world.</p><p>The two toxins were completely different in nature. If not for the coincidental circumstance of the strange-faced man being backlashed by the Gu King, causing the two potent poisons to merge within his body, Qin Sang wouldn't have discovered this secret.</p><p>“Once this potent poison is perfected, I wonder if it can threaten a Soul Formation cultivator. At least, Nascent Soul cultivators would have to avoid this Venom King…”</p><p>Qin Sang was secretly alarmed. The various sects of the Central Continent were indeed not to be underestimated, their foundations were deep.</p><p>In a flash of thought, Qin Sang didn't hesitate, immediately preparing to activate the Poison Bead, attempting to borrow its poison-repelling aura to suppress the toxins for the strange-faced man, allowing him to cling to life a little longer.</p><p>Unexpectedly, before Qin Sang could act, the light in the Nascent Soul's eyes rapidly faded, as if a ferocious beast was swiftly devouring his life force within his body.</p><p>The strange-faced man was severely injured by the lightning strike, and the new potent poison fused and erupted within him, resulting in such a tragic consequence.</p><p>Moreover, Qin Sang discovered that the new potent poison showed signs of spreading along his divine sense, startling him. He quickly withdrew his divine sense.</p><p>At this moment, he had already used his divine sense to forcibly break the restriction on the mustard bag. Seeing the items inside, his heart stirred, and he didn't take any further action.</p><p>On the other side, the Seven Souls Slaughter Formation successfully sealed Weeping Spirit Cave Master’s remnant soul, which was another reason why Qin Sang gave up on rescuing the strange-faced man.</p><p>In an instant, the strange-faced man's Nascent Soul was tortured beyond recognition, emitting a foul odor, transforming into an indescribable mass, finally exploding into a cloud of blood mist, completely annihilated!</p><p>One major threat eliminated.</p><p>Qin Sang looked around.</p><p>Beyond recognition was an understatement to describe the current state of Ice Instrument Palace.</p><p>Although chaotic before, the main body of the Ice Palace was still standing. Now, it was completely razed, then frozen by the cold air emanating from the azure celestial light, forming an ice sheet larger than the Ice Instrument Palace, and still spreading outwards.</p><p>The icy wind was biting.</p><p>The accumulated energy of the azure celestial light was released, but the light pillar remained, lingering for a long time.</p><p>Such a conspicuous phenomenon could probably be seen throughout the entire Formless Immortal Sect, and surely someone was rushing towards here.</p><p>“This place is not suitable to stay for long!”</p><p>Qin Sang's figure flickered, erasing the traces on the battlefield as much as possible. The residual waves of the formation had just swept through, the battlefield was mostly destroyed, so it wasn't too troublesome.</p><p>His avatar wasn't idle either.</p><p>Activating the remaining true essence, it rushed into the Ice Palace, going against the current through the azure celestial light, finding the hidden chamber within the ruins.</p><p>The area where the hidden chamber was located had become a deep pit, the hall above leveled. However, although the ice platform was covered in cracks, the mysterious ice disc was unharmed.</p><p>Before the ambush, the avatar had identified several key nodes of the spiritual formation, deducing that the mysterious ice disc wouldn't be affected by the destruction of the flag formation.  Such an important treasure, the person who set up the formation back then must have considered this point. The ice disc couldn't be destroyed here.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>Recalling the ice disc.</p><p>The avatar carefully examined it, clicking its tongue.</p><p>Although the ice disc was intact, the frigid煞 energy within was significantly thinner, greatly depleted, requiring a long time to replenish.</p><p>However, his main body was still far from Soul Formation, and the structure of the ice platform was already imprinted in his mind. Finding a suitable cave dwelling and setting up the formation anew would help the ice disc recover.</p><p>There was nothing to linger over.</p><p>The avatar took action, completely destroying the hidden chamber, returning to the battlefield with the mysterious ice disc. The second Nascent Soul returned to the main body, recuperating and recovering.</p><p>By this time, Qin Sang had subdued the Weeping Spirit Cave Master's remnant soul, and returned to the Gu King's side. Finding it too ferocious to subdue immediately, he simply wrapped it in demonfire and took it along.</p><p>After Qin Sang left.</p><p>The azure celestial light went from its peak to decline, the light pillar gradually dissipating, slowly vanishing.</p><p>The residual waves left a thick layer of ice on the ruins of the Ice Instrument Palace, unknown when it would completely melt.</p><p>Not long after.</p><p>A figure appeared on the southeastern edge of the ice sheet, the figure gradually becoming clear, it was Su Zinan.</p><p>Su Zinan glanced around, not discerning anything, raised his right hand, forcing out a cloud of blood mist, transforming it into a blood shadow, about to release it, to dive beneath the ice layer to investigate.</p><p>At this moment, he sensed something, abruptly looking up to the northwest, seeing two streaks of escaping light, flying straight towards him without concealment, his expression slightly sinking, but a surprised look quickly flashed in his eyes.</p><p>“What a fine outing for the two Real Masters! What impressive methods!”</p><p>As the escaping light approached, Su Zinan said with a half-smile, unclear whether it was praise or sarcasm.</p><p>The newcomers were none other than Real Master Purple Thunder and Real Master Hegao.</p><p>With his intelligence, seeing the two Real Masters of the Eight Sceneries Sect appear here, he immediately guessed the probable reason.</p><p>However, he hadn't experienced the battle for the formation, and was unaware of some details, many questions arising in his mind.</p><p>‘Whoosh! Whoosh!’</p><p>The two Real Masters also stopped at the edge of the ice sheet, facing Su Zinan from across the air.</p><p>Real Master Purple Thunder looked down at the ice sheet, observing it.</p><p>Real Master Hegao seemed to have a past grievance with Su Zinan, and threatened unceremoniously, “Surnamed Su, you dare to collude with the remnants of the Formless Immortal Sect, aren’t you afraid of exhausting Old Devil Lu’s legacy?”</p><p>Su Zinan responded with a cold smile, “This Su has long wanted to experience the divine abilities of the Daoist sect…”</p><p>Before he finished speaking, Su Zinan's right ear twitched slightly, his expression becoming exceptionally intriguing. He tsked in admiration a few times, his gaze sweeping over, “Where is Sect Master Yue? Could he have been killed by the old devils?”</p><p>Real Master Hegao's face darkened, suddenly turning his head to stare at a distant mountain peak, shouting fiercely, “Who’s there, hiding your head and showing your tail! Get out!”</p><p>There was no movement.</p><p>Su Zinan chuckled coldly, not intending to stay long, retracting the blood shadow with a flip of his palm, flashing away, not forgetting to leave a few sarcastic remarks before leaving, “This Su shall wait and see how you’ll control everything here!”</p><p>Seeing Su Zinan depart, Real Master Hegao looked at Real Master Purple Thunder.</p><p>Real Master Purple Thunder ignored Su Zinan, flying to the original location of the hidden chamber, staring for a long time.</p><p>Real Master Hegao didn't pursue Su Zinan.</p><p>The trees in the forest swayed.</p><p>Su Zinan flew here, entering the forest, and saw a person emerge from behind a tree, it was Mo Xingdao.</p><p>“Fellow Daoist Mo!”</p><p>Su Zinan cupped his hands. He didn't explain why he acted alone, and Mo Xingdao wouldn't ask.</p><p>The two briefly exchanged a few words.</p><p>Mo Xingdao was somewhat surprised, “The one who destroyed the Water Phase Hall wasn’t Fellow Daoist Su?”</p><p>Su Zinan denied, “I was also attracted by the light pillar… This Su doesn’t cultivate water-type divine abilities, what use would I have for the Water Phase Hall’s inheritance? It’s likely that the white-robed man and the other fellow had a conflict.  Now both are nowhere to be seen, the traces on the battlefield also swept clean by the residual formation, it’s unknown what treasure they were fighting over, and who won or lost.”</p><p>Pausing, Su Zinan asked in return, “Besides me, who else wasn't present at the cliff’s peak?”</p><p>“The centipede-faced man who accompanied the Weeping Spirit Cave Master is also missing…”</p><p>Mo Xingdao spoke frankly, “However, during the fight for the teleportation formation, besides the Daoist sect, there was another uninvited guest, not with the Daoist sect, skilled in sword formations, his swordsmanship almost suppressed Yue Lingtian…”</p><p>After listening to Mo Xingdao’s description, Su Zinan’s pupils constricted slightly, “Could it be him? The old devils thought their actions were secretive, but in reality, they were full of loopholes, long since targeted by the Daoist sect, a few more ‘magpies’ wouldn’t be surprising. I’ve long suspected the Fire Devil is a Fire Phase inheritor…”</p><p>Before he could finish, he was interrupted by Mo Xingdao, “In my opinion, Fellow Daoist, it’s best to set aside your grudges for now.”</p><p>Su Zinan was slightly taken aback, continuing to listen to Mo Xingdao’s account, only then learning that Zhu Wudao used the secrets of Emperor Bestowal Mountain to exchange for assistance. The mountain not only held countless exotic treasures, but also a Soul Formation opportunity!</p><p>“The Wordless Jade Tablet!”</p><p>Su Zinan murmured, his eyes gleaming with excitement.</p><p>Pondering for a moment, Su Zinan suddenly said, “The opportunity is precious, and there are many competitors. Seizing it will be no easy feat, there’s no rush. I have a secret treasure that needs to be refined in advance. Once a fight breaks out, it can greatly increase our chances! I hope Fellow Daoist Mo will wait a moment and protect me.”</p><p>Mo Xingdao frowned, but ultimately agreed.</p><p>The two Real Masters of the Daoist sect and Yue Lingtian were undoubtedly the strongest, while the Weeping Spirit Cave Master and the centipede-faced man worked together. Zhu Wudao seemed to be alone, but he knew many secrets of the Formless Immortal Sect.</p><p>Mo Xingdao’s strength was limited after all, and joining forces with Su Zinan was the wise choice.</p><p>Su Zinan was overjoyed and opened a cave dwelling on the spot.</p><p>He set up restrictions, isolating any probing.</p><p>Su Zinan sat cross-legged, summoning the Three Corpses Death God Banner.</p><p>The demonic banner fluttered.</p><p>The luster within the banner became increasingly restrained.</p><p>He looked at the demonic banner, his thoughts stirring slightly. Two figures drifted out from the banner's surface. One was Old Wu, and the other was Elder Yanshan.  Elder Yanshan ultimately didn’t escape his fate, becoming a primary soul within the banner.</p><p>Su Zinan gently beckoned to Elder Yanshan.</p><p>Elder Yanshan, now a primary soul, obediently flew to Su Zinan, his expression stiff, staring blankly as Su Zinan raised his hand, pressing it towards his forehead.</p><p>The next moment.</p><p>Elder Yanshan’s facial features suddenly contorted.</p><p>At the same time, Su Zinan felt a resistance from Elder Yanshan.  Under Elder Yanshan's influence, Old Wu also showed signs of restlessness.</p><p>It wasn't that Old Wu hadn’t been refined by the demonic banner, but rather that the three primary souls within the banner were closely connected, instinctively resisting. Every time a new soul was subdued, this process had to be repeated.</p><p>Therefore, refining the second primary soul was more difficult than the first, forcing Su Zinan to enter closed-door cultivation on the spot.</p><p>Su Zinan wasn’t worried about the primary soul devouring him, only reinforcing the restrictions of the cave dwelling a few more times, then firmly pressing against Elder Yanshan’s forehead amidst his roars.</p><p>……</p><p>“The Wordless Jade Tablet!”</p><p>These four words also echoed in another cave dwelling.</p><p>After distancing himself from the Ice Instrument Palace, confirming there were no pursuers, Qin Sang also found a hidden location, opening a cave dwelling and entering closed-door cultivation to adjust his breathing.</p><p>He hadn't had time to examine his spoils of war before discovering something amiss with the Weeping Spirit Cave Master’s remnant soul.</p><p>The Weeping Spirit Cave Master, having suffered torment and finally being forcibly driven into the spiritual wood body by the strange-faced man, was already at the end of his rope.  After being imprisoned by Qin Sang, his soul energy rapidly decayed.</p><p>Having no other choice, Qin Sang immediately performed the soul-searching technique.</p><p>Soul-searching on the remnant soul of a great cultivator was still no easy task. Qin Sang relied on his powerful divine sense, and the fact that he wasn't searching for extremely detailed or complicated information, to succeed.</p><p>What he cared about most was the Soul Formation opportunity of Emperor Bestowal Mountain, which he successfully obtained.</p><p>“I must go to Emperor Bestowal Mountain, but…”</p><p>Qin Sang thought of the tribulation transcendence formation.</p><p>He had the ice disc and part of the Icefire Tokens, and he also memorized the formation of the Taiji Immortal Platform, but he still lacked a crucial item, the fire-type treasure corresponding to the ice disc.</p><p>Qin Sang suspected that the treasure was held by the Fire Phase Hall, and he definitely needed to go to Fire Rhinoceros Island.</p><p>“I need to split up again…”</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at his avatar, which was focused on adjusting its breathing.</p><p>Unwilling to miss either, he could only split up again, sending his avatar to Fire Rhinoceros Island. Qin Sang flipped his palm, taking out two jade bottles, each containing a Boiling Snow Pill.</p><p>He already knew the effects of this pill.</p><p>“Let the avatar take one Boiling Snow Pill, even if it encounters a great cultivator, escaping shouldn’t be a problem.  As long as it escapes to the foot of Emperor Bestowal Mountain, I can provide support.”</p><p>Qin Sang made the worst-case scenario plan, giving one pill to his avatar.</p><p>At this moment, the tormented remnant soul finally dissipated.</p><p>He killed two great cultivators without using a single Boiling Snow Pill.</p><p>Qin Sang watched the remnant soul vanish, feeling complacent, yet couldn't help but sigh.</p><p>During the soul search, he also learned some of the Weeping Spirit Cave Master’s secrets from the memory fragments.</p><p>This person was proficient in ghost dao, excelling in the word ‘guile,’ especially adept at escape techniques.  Unfortunately, he was pulled into the flag formation by Qin Sang, unable to utilize many of his methods.</p><p>If the Weeping Spirit Cave Master and the strange-faced man had switched places, Qin Sang truly couldn’t guarantee he could have captured him.</p><p>The Weeping Spirit Cave Master's belongings were destroyed in the flag formation. At that time, Qin Sang, in order to quickly eliminate a powerful enemy, couldn't hold back for external objects.  If he had let the strange-faced man escape because of that, it would have been a loss outweighing the gain.</p><p>However, Qin Sang unexpectedly learned that the Weeping Spirit Cave Master was proficient in spirit nurturing techniques. He had a large medicinal garden in his cave dwelling, with many rare spiritual herbs growing vigorously.</p><p>This person had blazed a new trail, using refined souls to irrigate spiritual herbs, calling them blood herbs.  His current cultivation level had much to do with blood herbs.  He could be considered a genius.</p><p>He controlled some ‘disciples,’ scattered throughout various locations, collecting refined souls for him, but the spirit nurturing technique was a secret he never shared, always doing it personally.</p><p>The Weeping Spirit Cave Master was dead, the medicinal garden without an owner, it was now Qin Sang's to take.</p>
