<h1>Chapter 1503:  A Clash of Powers (4k)</h1><p>Chapter 1503:  A Clash of Powers (4k)</p><p>The Ice Jade Tripod stood upright, its four sides intricately carved with different snow and wind imagery:  biting icy winds and heavy snowfall.  Jiang, the Palace Master, unleashed all four images into reality.</p><p>A chilling ‘whoosh’ filled the air, a disorienting sound.  The wind was grey, visible to the naked eye, unlike ordinary cold winds.  It carried the power of a magical artifact, sharper than any blade.</p><p>The grey wind swept across everything, penetrating all defenses, only to be immediately swallowed by a blizzard, raising a swirling vortex of snow, mimicking an avalanche.</p><p>The battle raged at the edge of the black mist, an already dimly lit area. The wind and snow combined, obscuring all but a grey-white blur.</p><p>Strange phenomena accompanied the appearance of the Ice Jade Tripod.  Amidst the raging storm, the massive tripod glowed brightly.  Its power suppressed the surrounding space, even seeming to solidify the black mist.</p><p>Jiang, the Palace Master, focused solely on Shang Lu, ignoring everyone else. With a single hand gesture and a shout of "Subdue!", the tripod rumbled.</p><p>The four images swiftly converged towards the center, merging with the tripod before plummeting down upon Shang Lu.</p><p>Faced with this life-or-death attack, Shang Lu, his face a mask of fury and shock, reacted instantly.  His jade ruler shot up, striking with surprising speed.  Countless mountain-like illusions surged from the ruler, their power seemingly amplified a thousandfold.</p><p>A dull thud echoed.</p><p>The wind and snow clashed with the mountain illusions, a spectacular collision.</p><p>The mountain illusions were instantly obliterated, their fragments merging with the wind and snow, creating a chaotic spectacle.</p><p>Amidst the chaos, the resonating sounds of the two artifacts echoed, deep and powerful, like war drums pounding against the soul.</p><p>The jade ruler held its ground against the massive tripod, seemingly fragile yet incredibly sturdy.  The two artifacts appeared evenly matched.</p><p>At this critical moment, a white light erupted from Shang Lu's chest, manifesting the phantom of his protective artifact, the heart-protecting mirror.</p><p>The white light rapidly converged behind Shang Lu's head, forming a shimmering mirror.</p><p>The intense white light instantly captured everyone's attention.  The mirror clearly reflected Shang Lu's expression of unprecedented terror.</p><p>Yin, the Palace Master, and the others felt a chill run down their spines.</p><p>Before they could react, a delicate, jade-like green sword appeared out of thin air, blocked only by the light mirror.</p><p>The sword, named Green Sky Sword, pressed against the center of the mirror.  Its blade wasn't dazzling, but its power was undeniable.  The mirror cracked under the pressure, threatening to shatter.</p><p>"Green Sky Sword!"</p><p>Yin, the Palace Master, and the others’ faces paled.  This sword was Tong Lingyu's life-bound artifact. After she became the Grand Elder, she rarely used it,  as she had access to other powerful treasures.</p><p>They all knew the sword's history.</p><p>A single thought echoed in everyone’s minds, including Shang Lu's: Impossible!</p><p>Tong Lingyu had been captured by the Palace Master, destined to become a blood servant.  There was absolutely no chance of her escape.</p><p>The Palace Master's tribulation had been successful,  and even if it had not been, Tong Lingyu would have died.  Jiang’s side would have lost a powerful cultivator, but they could always go their separate ways afterward.</p><p>The tides of power constantly shift – times of unity are inevitably followed by division, and vice versa.</p><p>Internal strife within the Xuan Tian Palace wasn’t unheard of, it was a recurring cycle.</p><p>Shang Lu believed he was invincible. He never imagined Tong Lingyu could escape the pit alive, and launch a surprise attack.</p><p>"Damn it!"</p><p>That was Shang Lu's final thought.  He tried to deploy another defensive artifact, the Snow Scarf, but his body froze.</p><p>An icy chill, penetrating to the bone, enveloped him.</p><p>Ice Soul Light!</p><p>Qin Sang and the others had noticed Shang Lu’s self-protecting artifact.  With a simple trick, they had managed to exploit its weakness. Shang Lu’s actions at the wedding ceremony had revealed his strategy; otherwise, he might have lasted a bit longer.</p><p>Cracking sounds filled the air as the Ice Soul Light froze Shang Lu and the surrounding void.</p><p>Then, a sword beam, far more brilliant than the Green Sky Sword, shot from the black mist's depths, piercing Shang Lu's body with a metallic clang.</p><p>The sword light, dazzling and swift as a dragon, was a testament to the Jin Chen Sword's owner, finally releasing the pent-up frustration from his confrontation with Yin Changsheng.</p><p>Shang Lu lowered his head, staring blankly at the hole in his chest, the light fading rapidly from his eyes. He didn't even have time to escape with his Nascent Soul; his body was shredded by sword energy, killing him instantly.</p><p>Qin Sang and the other two, along with Jiang, worked together seamlessly, easily slaying Shang Lu.</p><p>‘Pfft!’</p><p>Shang Lu's body collapsed to the ground.</p><p>A sudden change.</p><p>The cultivator surnamed Yue stared blankly at Shang Lu's corpse.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>Suddenly, a thunderclap exploded nearby, jolting Yue.</p><p>It was Yin, seeing the situation turn dire, who quickly pulled a fist-sized transparent orb from his pouch and threw it without hesitation.</p><p>The orb was a disposable artifact similar to a thunder pearl, containing condensed Azure Wood Divine Thunder—a treasure Yin had unexpectedly obtained.</p><p>Once detonated, the Azure Wood Divine Thunder possessed immense power, one of Yin's trump cards.</p><p>However, he didn't target it behind him to save anyone, but aimed it at Elder Mei and the others.</p><p>Yin, a battle-hardened veteran, realized the danger the instant he saw the Qingxiao Sword. Unlike Yue, he wasn't slow-witted; he reacted with extreme speed, making the correct decision—escape!</p><p>However Tong Lingyu survived, signifying the Palace Master's plan had failed.</p><p>Tong Lingyu wouldn't let them go.</p><p>At least three people were hidden within the black mist.</p><p>With Shang Lu dead, Yin knew he had no chance of winning.</p><p>The Azure Wood Divine Thunder was condensed into an orb, its interior like water, pure and flawless, showing no sign of electricity.</p><p>The instant it left his hand, the orb rapidly expanded, finally revealing faint, small, greenish streaks of lightning within.</p><p>In an instant, the Azure Wood Divine Thunder formed a net of lightning, then contracted inwards, expanding and contracting until it became a pearl-sized, green orb.</p><p>Elder Mei, in the forefront, paused slightly, her face changing drastically.  She hurriedly manipulated her fingers; the icy path on the ground vanished, and she condensed a drop of water into a sturdy shield.</p><p>Almost the instant the orb exploded, the shield was barely formed before it was engulfed by the green thunder, its surface instantly covered in countless cracks.</p><p>Elder Mei felt a powerful blow, groaning and staggering back, her face ashen.</p><p>The others shielding Yin were also blown away along with Elder Mei.  Though none died, they could no longer stop Yin's escape.</p><p>Yin darted forward, still feeling his speed wasn't fast enough, slapping a yellow talisman onto himself to increase his speed.  He instantly fled towards the mountain's edge, flying towards the exit of the Sacred Ground without looking back.</p><p>Unexpectedly, before leaving Mount Floating Sky, Yin heard a calm question.</p><p>“Where do you think you're going, Daoist Yin?”</p><p>With the voice, a bolt of lightning pierced the black mist, speeding towards him.  Even with the talisman, Yin couldn't outrun his opponent and was caught in an instant.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>Qin Sang stepped out of the lightning, his phoenix wings slowly retracting, effortlessly blocking Yin's path.</p><p>“It’s you!”</p><p>Yin, possessing extraordinary mental fortitude, quickly calmed down, his eyes shifting uncertainly.  He said coldly, “Was the Palace Master murdered by you and Tong Ni?”</p><p>“Didn't you see the tribulation just now, Daoist?”</p><p>Qin Sang said playfully,  “Yin Changsheng failed his breakthrough and died in his own tribulation. What does that have to do with me?”</p><p>Yin snorted, not arguing. He glanced back at the black mist and quickly said, “With your abilities, Daoist, are you willing to be someone's underling, controlled by a mere woman? With the Palace Master gone, I am the new head of the Xuan Tian lineage. After the deaths of Shang Lu and the others, the Tian Shan lineage is scattered and poses no threat.  The Tingxue Tower lineage and you have deep roots. We could work together, inside and out, to eliminate Tong Ni, seize the treasure, and when we return, we can spin our own narrative! With the four lineages under our control, one of us becomes the Palace Master, the other the Grand Elder, controlling the largest sect in the North Sea. Wouldn't that be wonderful? Not only will you get the treasure, I promise not to interfere in matters outside the Xuan Tian lineage…”</p><p>Qin Sang’s lips curled into a slight smile.  He chuckled, “Your proposal is indeed tempting, but I have no interest in power. Besides, you and Shang Lu colluded at the wedding ceremony, plotting against me along with Yin Changsheng. That's something I can’t tolerate.”</p><p>Yin’s face darkened, all hope gone.</p><p>“I’ll see just how capable you are, daring to stop me alone!”</p><p>Yin roared, opening his mouth and spitting out a prepared blue orb.</p><p>The orb split into ten, shooting into the air and transforming into ten blue halos, hovering above.</p><p>Each halo was the size of a human head.  After separating, they quickly wriggled and transformed into ten ice mirrors.</p><p>Each ice mirror's front was engraved with intricate runes, all aimed squarely at Qin Sang.</p><p>“The Falling Nether God Ban…”</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at the mirrors, his expression unreadable.  The moment the temple master unleashed the orb of light, he felt a familiar energy. Having witnessed the power of the Falling Nether God Ban firsthand, Qin Sang certainly hadn't forgotten it. However, while Yin Changsheng had used thirteen ice mirrors to cast the ban, the temple master could only conjure ten, and the runes on his mirrors were less intricate, significantly reducing its power.</p><p>The mirrors emitted beams of light, forming the ban's diagram and crashing down on Qin Sang mercilessly.</p><p>‘Swish! Swish! Swish!’</p><p>Ice formed, and the ban's light instantly engulfed Qin Sang.  Just as a look of triumph appeared on the temple master's face, it was replaced with horror.</p><p>Within the ban, a powerful demonic fire energy suddenly erupted, and a shadowy figure burst forth – a flame dragon composed of demonic fire! The ban’s diagrams shattered one after another.  To the temple master's astonishment, the flame dragon effortlessly broke through the layers of the ban, twisted its body slightly, and then, without hesitation, charged towards the ice mirrors above.</p><p>‘Crash!’</p><p>The ice mirrors shattered instantly, consumed by the demonic fire.</p><p>Qin Sang remained where he was, pointed at the temple master, and the demonic flame dragon swooped down.  Yin Changsheng's meticulously prepared, full-power Falling Nether God Ban, even the Nine Nether Demonic Fire could withstand; this was even easier!</p><p>In a panic, the temple master swept his hand over his head. White vapor billowed, transforming into a colossal energy hand, more powerful than a cultivator of the Yue family, yet weaker than Yin Changsheng.  Such high-level abilities are not numerous even in the Xuan Tian Palace's treasury.</p><p>The temple master was like a smaller version of Yin Changsheng; their techniques and abilities were clearly related.  For Qin Sang, these two similar opponents felt different; dealing with the temple master was considerably easier.  He didn't even need to use the Heavenly Eye Divine Light.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The energy hand lunged at the dragon.  The demonic fire, lacking substance, dispersed instantly.  Enveloped in flames, the energy hand began to dissipate.</p><p>The temple master gritted his teeth, a thought flitting through his mind, and without hesitation, detonated the energy hand, buying himself time. Simultaneously, his right wrist trembled imperceptibly, a flash of silver fleeting past.</p><p>The next moment, the silver flash reappeared, less than three feet from Qin Sang. It was a silver needle, thin as a hair, moving without sound or energy fluctuation – a truly insidious weapon. By the time an opponent noticed it, defense would be impossible.</p><p>However, nothing could hide from Qin Sang. He had numerous countermeasures. His phoenix wings fluttered, suddenly unfolding, and Qin Sang was about to transform into lightning to teleport away.</p><p>At that moment, Qin Sang heard two soft shouts.</p><p>“Hmph!”</p><p>“Hah!”</p><p>These weren't ordinary shouts; they were attacks targeting the soul! A psychic assault!</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes lit up. He had always been fascinated by such techniques, but had never found one powerful enough to fully utilize his immense psychic strength. He'd assumed Yin Changsheng's psychic attack techniques had perished with him, like the lower volume of the *Tongbao Jue*.  But the temple master also knew it!  It felt similar, yet different from Yin Changsheng’s, whether due to the temple master's insufficient cultivation, or Yin Changsheng making later modifications.  Yin Changsheng had centuries sealed in his ice coffin, ample time to refine his techniques.</p><p>“Presumptuous!” Qin Sang sneered, unaffected. He transformed into lightning, easily dodging the needle, then changed direction and charged at the temple master.</p><p>The killing blow was thwarted. To make matters worse, the energy hand had vanished into the demonic flames, unable to stop the dragon.  The temple master was shaken to his core, hastily summoning a square seal.  Ancient characters on the seal emitted light, each imbued with divine power, putting up a stubborn resistance.</p><p>But before the temple master could breathe a sigh of relief, the surroundings suddenly darkened, filled with sharp energy.  All he saw were countless sword threads.</p><p>“Sword Array!” the temple master cried out in alarm, overwhelmed. The sound of the ancient characters shattering echoed like muffled thunder, intensifying his terror.</p><p>‘Bang!’</p><p>The seal’s power was depleted.  The demonic fire and sword array enveloped him from above and below, creating utter chaos. Outsiders could no longer see the temple master or Qin Sang, only hearing the sounds of clashes.</p><p>Under the cover of the chaos, Qin Sang's external avatar appeared silently behind the temple master. Before the temple master could react, it was too late.</p><p>‘Poof!’</p><p>The external avatar's hand transformed into an icy claw, piercing deeply into the temple master's back.  A light flashed from the top of the temple master's head, his Nascent Soul escaping.  But as soon as it appeared, a demonic flame, seemingly waiting for it, charged forth.  The temple master's expression faltered, and before he could teleport, he was restrained!</p>
