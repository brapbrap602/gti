<h1>Chapter 1704: Spirit Nurturing Method</h1><p>The black threads were the very essence of the Demonic Fire.</p><p>Since taking residence in Deer Wilderness, Qin Sang's true body had been immersed in secluded cultivation, rarely venturing out of his cave dwelling.</p><p>Not only were his injuries steadily healing, but his divine sense had also made gratifying progress, having almost completely absorbed and refined the Near-Dragon Saliva.  Aided by the power of the Near-Dragon Saliva, the bottleneck of the *Fire Seed Golden Lotus* began to loosen.</p><p>Naturally, Qin Sang then focused all his energy on cultivating this secret technique.</p><p>The Fire Lotus hovered before Qin Sang's brow, connected to him by an invisible link extending to his brow, and even to his Purple Mansion.</p><p>The Mani Pearl was brought close to the Fire Lotus, and the few strands of Demonic Fire essence, like fish evading capture in water, darted about within the crimson flames of the Mani Pearl.</p><p>Qin Sang gazed at the essence of the Demonic Fire, a contemplative expression on his face.</p><p>He had maintained this posture for several months.</p><p>Before this, Qin Sang had continuously analyzed the power within the Demonic Fire essence, meticulously unraveling it layer by layer, absorbing and refining it bit by bit, until finally isolating these black threads.  Then, he reached an impasse.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't say whether these were the quintessence of the essence, or some other existence.  What he could be sure of was that the Demonic Fire's original master must have controlled the Demonic Fire through these black threads.</p><p>He could feel that his divine sense had reached its limit, presumably the peak of the Nascent Soul realm.  He was just one step away from stepping into a new realm.</p><p>The next step was to refine one or several of these black threads and shatter the bottleneck!</p><p>Over the past few months, Qin Sang had continuously deduced and planned, consuming a great deal of mental energy.</p><p>Suddenly, Qin Sang's eyes flickered, and his expression grew slightly serious. Having made up his mind, he separated several strands of spiritual fire from the Fire Lotus.  They descended and coiled around the Mani Pearl.</p><p>The black threads within the crimson flames seemed to sense something and their movements suddenly accelerated. However, the Demonic Fire separated from the Fire Lotus shared the same origin. Under Qin Sang's control, he successfully extracted three of the black threads.</p><p>Indeed, Qin Sang intended to directly refine three black threads, using their power to break through!</p><p>The Mani Pearl slowly drifted to the ground and fell silent.</p><p>The Fire Lotus before Qin Sang was now gone, replaced by a ring of fire.  The three black threads were trapped within the flames.  Strands of spiritual fire, separated by Qin Sang, continuously approached the black threads, probing cautiously.</p><p>After a stick of incense burned.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The ring of fire abruptly contracted, and the spiritual fire converged like a gaping maw, devouring the black threads!</p><p>In an instant, fiery waves surged within the cave dwelling. The reflections of the black flames on the walls resembled clawing demons, chilling to the bone.</p><p>Qin Sang closed his eyes tightly and swiftly formed dozens of hand seals. The spiritual fire gradually constricted, seemingly progressing smoothly. Unexpectedly, a muffled sound suddenly erupted, and the compressed spiritual fire burst open.  The cave dwelling was engulfed in a sea of flames, and Qin Sang's figure was submerged beneath layers of fiery waves.</p><p>Within the sea of fire, the three black threads were the most conspicuous. They seemed to be expanding, transforming from thin threads to the thickness of thin ropes, emanating a violent aura.</p><p>It went without saying that the eruption of energy from within the black threads must be incredibly terrifying, easily capable of leveling the cave dwelling.</p><p>“Condense!”</p><p>Qin Sang's voice was low and steady, devoid of panic.</p><p>As his words fell, the sea of fire instantly subsided, and the spiritual fire gathered. The Fire Lotus reappeared above the black threads, slowly rotating.  A strange rhythm enveloped the black threads, finally pacifying the violent power within.</p><p>Having stabilized the situation, Qin Sang squinted at the black threads, a hint of joy in his eyes. He muttered, "So that's how it is!"</p><p>No wonder refining the essence of the Demonic Fire was so difficult!</p><p>According to the levels defined in the *Fire Seed Golden Lotus* secret technique, the first level was Fire Condensing into Lotus Seeds. The second level was Lotus Seeds Transforming into Flower Buds and the Fire Lotus Blooming. The third level was Lotus Transforming into a Lotus Platform.</p><p>Currently, the petals of the Fire Lotus hadn't fully bloomed, and there was still a long way to go before reaching the third level of Lotus Transforming into a Lotus Platform.</p><p>Even completely refining the Demonic Fire wouldn't reach the third level. This secret technique had extremely high potential.</p><p>His foundation was in Dharma cultivation, not spiritual cultivation.  Cultivating the *Fire Seed Golden Lotus* wasn't closely linked to his own Dao, and logically, it should have been easier.  Yet he had encountered obstacles repeatedly.</p><p>Only now did he understand that the bottleneck wasn't only related to himself but also to the Demonic Fire.</p><p>The essence of the Demonic Fire actually still retained the imprint of its original master!</p><p>After countless years, the original master's aura within the imprint had long since dissipated.  If another person proficient in the Nine Nether Demonic Fire's secret techniques were to come across it, they could easily control the imprint and claim it as their own.</p><p>However, Qin Sang wanted to devour the Demonic Fire. Without eradicating the imprint, it would naturally be extremely difficult. Fortunately, the *Fire Seed Golden Lotus* itself was extraordinary, and Qin Sang had also found treasures like the Near-Dragon Saliva to aid him. He had finally identified the root cause; otherwise, it would have taken a tremendous amount of effort and time to discover the problem.</p><p>Knowing the crux of the issue, the next steps were much easier.</p><p>Qin Sang changed his strategy. He manipulated the Fire Lotus to envelop the black threads, guiding the imprint to reveal itself, and then tried various methods to wear it down. Within a month, he achieved remarkable results.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The previous scene replayed.</p><p>The spiritual fire devoured the black threads.</p><p>This time, the energy within the black threads didn't erupt. Under Qin Sang's control, it maintained a certain stability. The black threads seemed to melt, diffusing within the spiritual fire.</p><p>The Demonic Fire energy within the black threads was incredibly pure and potent. The *Fire Seed Golden Lotus* greedily devoured it, as if starved.</p><p>Simultaneously devouring three black threads was actually beyond Qin Sang's capabilities, but this was precisely what he wanted. When the energy of the three black threads merged, his divine sense surged forth, pushing the *Fire Seed Golden Lotus* to its limits!</p><p>Qin Sang's brow throbbed, and he felt a sharp pain in his forehead.</p><p>It wasn't damage to his Nascent Soul, but the consequence of the immense and sudden consumption of his divine sense.</p><p>He gritted his teeth, not daring to relax for a moment. His mind was clear and focused, completely disregarding the feeling that his divine sense was like a bursting dam, on the verge of depletion, concentrating solely on operating the secret technique.</p><p>It felt like only an instant, or perhaps a very long time had passed.</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly felt a stirring in his heart.  He opened his eyes, and stars seemed to swirl within them as he stared intently at the spiritual fire before him.</p><p>The spiritual fire gradually ceased its churning and condensed into a Fire Lotus, new lotus petals unfurling!</p><p>He shifted his gaze towards the entrance of the cave dwelling, his eyes seemingly able to penetrate the stone door. His divine sense had already passed through the protective formation, spreading out into the world.</p><p>Back then, the transformation of his divine sense had been a monumental change.</p><p>The same was true now.</p><p>In his 'eyes,' the world was vastly different from before. His spiritual perception was sharper, its range wider.  Any subtle change within Deer Wilderness couldn't escape his awareness. It was as if he could 'hear' the flow of spiritual energy, yet he could also sense extreme stillness within extreme motion.  Qin Sang savored the experience, reminiscing about everything.</p><p>With a thought, a罡wind whipped up outside the cave dwelling. White currents of air spiraled above, gradually coalescing into a human-shaped phantom at the center of the罡wind.</p><p>The phantom had distinct features, bearing a striking resemblance to Qin Sang!</p><p>Then, the phantom slowly opened its eyes, raised its hands, and looked down at itself.  Next, it虚握its ten fingers, attempting to manipulate the spiritual energy of heaven and earth.</p><p>A feeling of sluggishness and strain transmitted back. Qin Sang, within the cave dwelling, frowned and dispersed the phantom, retracting his divine sense.  He circulated his cultivation to restore himself to peak condition, sensing the strength of his divine sense.  It was comparable to the performance of the Azure Fox Holy King and Radiant Light Holy One, at least on the same level!</p><p>Qin Sang was overjoyed and attempted to commune with heaven and earth.</p><p>The result, however, was disappointing.</p><p>It seemed that the Ghost Mother's theory of 'Dao Attainment' wasn't unfounded. He had attained Dao through the *Nascent Soul Sword Nurturing Chapter*, his foundation being in Dharma cultivation.  The transformation of his divine sense would certainly be beneficial for future breakthroughs, allowing him to resist the Heavenly Might of Soul Formation cultivators, but it couldn't allow him to truly sense heaven and earth.</p><p>The benefits brought by his enhanced divine sense were certainly more than just these.</p><p>The simplest point was that if Qin Sang had entered the Formless Immortal Sect with his current strength, he would never have been unaware of the two clans' Soul Formation cultivators approaching Emperor Bestowal Mountain.</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't in a hurry to leave seclusion and test his new abilities.  He continued to stay in the cave dwelling, refining the remaining Demonic Fire. His progress had greatly increased after his breakthrough.</p><p>In less than a year.</p><p>The Mani Pearl returned to its original appearance.</p><p>The Nine Nether Demonic Fire was finally completely refined by Qin Sang!</p><p>Under Qin Sang's instructions, Deer Wilderness had drifted to the uninhabited western region of the Northern Wastelands.</p><p>He rose and walked out of the cave dwelling, emerging into a desolate plain.</p><p>The wilderness was covered in lush vegetation, seemingly fertile land.  In reality, it was periodically ravaged by the Nine Calamities of the Northern Wastelands, making it unsuitable for survival. Not only was it devoid of human habitation, even insects and beasts were rarely seen.</p><p>His brow flickered, and the Fire Lotus slowly flew out.</p><p>Two layers of lotus petals had unfurled around the Fire Lotus, but the flower bud at the center remained tightly closed.  The black lotus contained immense power.</p><p>With a flick of his sleeve, Qin Sang released the Sun God Tree, intending to test whether the power of the Fire Lotus or the combined might of the Six Birds was greater.</p><p>Moments later.</p><p>Thunderous booms echoed across the desolate plain.</p><p>The entire plain, along with the surrounding mountain peaks, trembled, terrifying any living creatures nearby.</p><p>Qin Sang floated above the plain, gazing in astonishment at the two bottomless craters below. One emitted a constant stream of crimson flames, and the other expelled a black fire dragon, which coiled around Qin Sang for a moment before reverting to the form of a Fire Lotus.</p><p>With the advancement of his divine sense, his control over the Sun God Birds had also improved. Although he couldn't reduce the consumption of his power, he could now simply guide the direction of their attacks.</p><p>Of course, it couldn't compare to the Fire Lotus.  This fire was completely under his control, as if an extension of his own body, with far less consumption.  Moreover, it definitely possessed power on the Soul Formation level.</p><p>However, after a direct comparison, Qin Sang discovered that even after completely refining the Nine Nether Demonic Fire, the power of the Fire Lotus was still inferior to the combined might of the Six Birds.  This surprised Qin Sang and gave him a new understanding of the Southern Bright Nether Fire.</p><p>The Fire Lotus hovered above Qin Sang's head, like a black crown.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced left and right.  Seeing that no cultivators had been alerted by the unusual phenomena, he withdrew the Fire Lotus and adjusted his breath for a moment. A brilliant light erupted behind him as his phoenix wings unfolded. Then, with a thought, he activated the Celestial Demon Transformation.  A blue light flickered behind his head as the Azure Phoenix manifestation appeared.</p><p>After reaching the Nascent Soul realm, his progress in body refinement had stagnated, which meant the Azure Phoenix manifestation hadn't changed much, remaining illusory.</p><p>However, Qin Sang remembered that when his divine sense had first transformed, he had been able to partially control the Azure Phoenix manifestation, drawing upon the thunderous power within the phoenix wings to enhance his Thunder Escape.</p><p>Now, with another transformation of his divine sense, would there be further changes?</p><p>Qin Sang immediately tried. The Azure Phoenix manifestation flickered, and a clap of thunder suddenly erupted within the phoenix wings. Blue electric arcs danced between the feathers, and dazzling lightning, like liquid thunder, almost completely enveloped Qin Sang.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>A deafening thunderclap resounded as lightning split the sky, piercing the plain and vanishing into the distant mountains.</p><p>When the lightning dissipated.</p><p>The bolt of lightning hadn't returned.  A human-shaped crater appeared on a mountain outside the plain.  The surrounding vegetation was scorched black, and cracks spread everywhere. The mountain nearly shattered.</p><p>The sound of gasping for air came from within the crater.</p><p>Qin Sang crawled out, looking somewhat disheveled. He felt pain throughout his body, as if his flesh, bones, and meridians were about to split apart.</p><p>As he had expected, with the advancement of his divine sense, his Thunder Escape had indeed greatly improved under the enhancement of the Azure Phoenix manifestation.</p><p>Unexpectedly, in a moment of excitement, he had pushed the Thunder Escape to its limit, and he immediately suffered the consequences.  He quickly understood the reason.</p><p>The Thunder Escape utilized the Azure Phoenix's thunder power within his phoenix wings, not his own power. It was actually a burden on him.  The consumption of true essence was secondary, but the *Celestial Demon Body Refining* technique had stalled. His physical body was only comparable to that of an early-stage Nascent Soul cultivator.  He could endure it before, but now it had exceeded the limits of his physical body.</p><p>This warned him that unless his physical body improved, he shouldn't use the Thunder Escape at full power unless his life was on the line.</p><p>However, even if he held back, his escape speed still surpassed the past. With the Demonic Fire and his escape technique, he finally had the means to contend with Soul Formation cultivators.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes gleamed as he looked south.  However, he didn't intend to retrieve his avatar.  He still harbored a deep apprehension towards Soul Formation cultivators.</p><p>Deer Wilderness changed direction and drifted eastward.</p><p>Shortly after, it stopped in a region of rolling hills.</p><p>Qin Sang stood at the entrance of Deer Wilderness, overlooking the landscape below. He saw several Daoist temples built on a mountain peak, with young Daoists in Daoist robes moving about within.</p><p>Outside the temples stood a stone tablet inscribed with 'Azure Ram Temple Branch.'</p><p>This was the spiritual vein that Shen Chen and the others had searched the Northern Wastelands for, establishing a Dao lineage here as a branch of the Azure Ram Temple. Only when the disciples within the sect reached a certain level of cultivation would they be qualified to learn about and enter Deer Wilderness for cultivation.</p><p>The time spent cultivating was still short, and these disciples' cultivation levels were still very low.</p><p>However, under the management of Shen Chen, the Nether Moon Guards, and the others, several batches of talented disciples had been brought up the mountain, and there was a sense of prosperity.  The Azure Ram Temple in the Middle State had another advantage; as long as Deer Wilderness wasn't lost, it would eventually flourish.</p><p>“Greetings, Master!”</p><p>Shen Chen led the Nether Moon Guards to fly up to Deer Wilderness and knelt in obeisance.  His cultivation had further improved.</p><p>"From now on, focus on your cultivation and breaking through to the Nascent Soul realm.  Leave the mundane affairs to your disciples..."</p><p>Qin Sang gave some instructions, and then ordered the Nether Moon Guards to pay attention to the beast hunt, returning to his cave dwelling once more.</p><p>He was naturally eager to obtain the Four Saints Spirit Gathering Formation and cultivate the *Heavenly Demon Illumination Scripture*, but he had to be patient.  Only when the vicious beast appeared and the Soul Formation cultivators were busy hunting it down could he recall his avatar!</p><p>Back in the cave dwelling.</p><p>While cultivating, Qin Sang began to immerse himself in comprehending the *Panhu True Scripture*.</p><p>With the Ghost Mother's invaluable guidance and his previous experience, he could overcome the various difficulties encountered in comprehending this scripture.  If nothing unexpected happened, he could begin to cultivate this scripture!</p><p>An unknown amount of time passed.</p><p>Qin Sang opened his eyes and looked at the Heavenly Eye Butterfly on his left shoulder.</p><p>Refining the Near-Dragon Saliva had greatly benefited the Heavenly Eye Butterfly.  Its cultivation had increased even faster than in the previous two hundred years, and it hadn't even fully absorbed the Near-Dragon Saliva's energy.</p><p>"After switching to cultivating the *Panhu True Scripture* and using the Spirit Nurturing Method, combined with the pills collected by my avatar, the Heavenly Eye Butterfly will soon be able to break through to the late stage of the Fourth Transformation and catch up to me..."</p><p>Qin Sang murmured to himself, planning his future cultivation.</p><p>Within the *Panhu True Scripture*, the Spirit Nurturing Method was the most important core secret technique.  Combined with various witch clan secret techniques like Blood Refining, Divine Nurturing, and Secret Medicine, this technique could rapidly increase the cultivation of one's natal insect蛊, bringing it close to the master's level.</p><p>This was the true meaning of the witch sect's natal insect蛊technique.  The reason it was called a natal insect蛊was because it could improve in synergy with its master, each supporting the other.  This was the biggest difference from other spirit insects.</p><p>Unfortunately, Qin Sang hadn't received the true inheritance in the Boundless Sea, which had restricted the Heavenly Eye Butterfly's progress.</p><p>Now, all the difficulties had been resolved.</p><p>"Let's begin..."</p><p>Qin Sang called out to the Heavenly Eye Butterfly with his mind.</p><p>The Heavenly Eye Butterfly gently touched Qin Sang's cheek and flew into his dantian.</p>
