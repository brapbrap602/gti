<h1>Chapter 820: Great Battle of Souls</h1><p>Qin Sang's Nascent Soul was fearless, but he also didn't want to be touched by the sharp cone, unsure of any strange side effects. This was his first encounter with such a powerful soul, so he was extremely cautious.</p><p>A strong gust of wind rushed towards his face.</p><p>Qin Sang retreated swiftly, dodging repeatedly. Finally, he unleashed the Nine Nether Demonic Fire.  The demonic fire coalesced into a ball, colliding with the cone. Both dissipated simultaneously.</p><p>As the demonic fire scattered, the Ten Yama Banners fluttered, and another stream of demonic fire was drawn out. Qin Sang flashed into the banner formation. With a wave of his arm, the demonic fire transformed into a black spear before him.</p><p>Just then, the woman caught up.</p><p>Pointed at by the spear and sensing the aura of the Nine Nether Demonic Fire, the woman stopped abruptly. Staring intently at the black demonic flames, a hint of fear appeared on her face.</p><p>The Nine Nether Demonic Fire naturally had a suppressive effect on souls, and the woman, being a pure soul, instinctively felt fear.</p><p>Seeing the Nine Nether Demonic Fire's effectiveness, Qin Sang's face lit up with joy. He focused his energy, causing the fire spear to spin rapidly. In an instant, it transitioned from stillness to motion, shooting out like a bolt.</p><p>As expected, the woman didn't dare to be struck by the fire spear.  She abandoned her pursuit of Qin Sang, her figure instantly shifting several meters, dodging swiftly, attempting to bypass the fire spear.</p><p>Having seized the initiative, Qin Sang pressed his advantage relentlessly.</p><p>The Nine Nether Demonic Fire constantly shifted and changed, transforming into various weapons like swords, spears, and halberds, pressing the woman step by step. However, the woman's speed was too great, and she was exceptionally agile, resulting in Qin Sang being unable to secure a decisive victory.</p><p>The woman tried several times to launch a surprise attack on Qin Sang, but was forced back each time by the demonic fire. Furthermore, Qin Sang's speed was no less than hers.  After repeated failed attempts, she became incredibly furious, letting out bursts of angry roars. Her eyes turned bloodshot, a terrifying sight.</p><p>At this moment, she no longer had any trace of gentleness, resembling a vengeful spirit.</p><p>However, while it appeared that Qin Sang had the upper hand, he hadn't actually inflicted any damage on the woman.</p><p>Qin Sang looked up towards the distant Nascent Soul battle. The commotion there was even more startling and intense. This made him frown slightly, wondering how much time he had left.</p><p>Just as he was thinking, Qin Sang saw another opportunity. He immediately shouted, "Explode!"</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>The demonic fire erupted suddenly.</p><p>The woman's movements slowed for a split second. Her soul, unable to dodge in time, was scorched by the demonic fire, letting out a painful groan.  Simultaneously, her soul suffered an impact, sending her tumbling backward.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the direction the woman was thrown towards was precisely where Qin Sang stood.</p><p>Qin Sang immediately felt a sense of alarm. The woman, now without a trace of disarray, used the momentum from the demonic fire blast to increase her speed drastically, rapidly closing in, a sinister grin on her face.</p><p>"Ah!"</p><p>The woman screamed at Qin Sang, her mouth wide open.</p><p>This time, no sharp cone formed, but the scream formed sound waves, almost tangible, surging towards Qin Sang like a tidal wave.</p><p>This screech was extremely piercing, not an ordinary cry, but a terrifying attack in itself. If cultivators lacked the means to defend against it, being struck by the scream could, at best, shake their Nascent Soul and paralyze their body; at worst, it could shatter their soul on the spot, causing them to bleed from their seven orifices and die.</p><p>The woman had been planning this for a while, constantly searching for an opportunity, and her strategy finally paid off.</p><p>Caught off guard, Qin Sang had no time to dodge and was struck directly by the screech, freezing in place, lost in a daze.</p><p>"Hee hee..."</p><p>The woman let out a piercing, maniacal laugh, transforming into a terrifying evil spirit.  Her scarlet tongue licked her fangs, and her fingernails grew extraordinarily long. Consumed by bloodlust, she eagerly reached for Qin Sang's heart.</p><p>But as she reached Qin Sang, she noticed something was amiss. Qin Sang's eyes were clear, without a trace of confusion, looking at her coldly.</p><p>*Swoosh!*</p><p>Sword light flashed, then split, several beams suddenly erupting.</p><p>At the same time, with a flick of Qin Sang's wrist, the Two-Headed Flood Dragon leaped out from the Concentric Rings.  It had been prepared, its vertical pupils shooting out a storm.</p><p>The woman never expected that Qin Sang was completely unaffected by the soul-attacking scream.  He had been feigning it, boldly luring her closer to deliver a fatal blow.</p><p>In an instant, he fully unleashed his mastery of swordsmanship.</p><p>Sword light crisscrossed, swift as lightning.</p><p>Within the storm, wind blades were like knives, seemingly capable of shredding everything, their power equally formidable.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, several beams of sword light pierced through the woman.</p><p>The next moment, the woman's screams echoed.  Struck by the Ebony Wood Sword, cracks appeared on her soul. Then, the storm hit, countless wind blades cutting into her seemingly fragile body, instantly engulfing her.</p><p>The screams abruptly ceased.</p><p>As the Ebony Wood Sword returned and the storm dissipated, the woman completely vanished, as if she had been killed.</p><p>But Qin Sang's expression didn't relax in the slightest.  He glanced around, suddenly recalling the Nine Nether Demonic Fire, enveloping himself within it.  Then, he saw the woman's figure re-forming in the distance.</p><p>Her limbs were intact, even the cracks caused by the Ebony Wood Sword had disappeared.  There wasn't a single injury on her body.</p><p>The woman's expression was even more terrifying.  She hadn't expected someone who appeared so weak to be impervious to her attack and even able to injure her in return.  She hated Qin Sang intensely, wishing she could devour him alive.</p><p>"An indestructible body?"</p><p>Qin Sang frowned.</p><p>He knew souls were different from cultivators, and certain attacks were ineffective against them. But the souls he had encountered before, even if they didn't die, would be severely injured by attacks of this level. It was impossible for them to be completely unscathed like this.</p><p>High-level soul refinement was truly bizarre.</p><p>"Wait... something's different. Her soul seems more transparent than before..."</p><p>Qin Sang stared at the woman, noticing the difference. He thought to himself that this was more like it.  Otherwise, possessing such formidable strength and an indestructible body would be too terrifying.</p><p>Even so, the woman still posed a considerable challenge to Qin Sang.</p><p>The Ebony Wood Sword and other methods could only weaken her soul, while the Nine Nether Demonic Fire could injure her, but the woman was extremely wary of the demonic fire and wouldn't be easily hit.</p><p>The distant Nascent Soul battle appeared fierce, but if a victor emerged, it would happen in an instant.</p><p>Time was on the woman's side; he couldn't keep stalling with her.</p><p>Thinking of this, Qin Sang gave the woman a deep look and turned to leave again.</p><p>The woman, filled with hatred for Qin Sang, wouldn't let him go and pursued him without hesitation.</p><p>"Her speed has slowed..."</p><p>While fleeing, Qin Sang also sensed what was happening behind him, making a discovery.</p><p>It seemed the previous attacks weren't entirely ineffective, having inflicted damage on the woman, though it wasn't outwardly visible.</p><p>He stopped running, turning around to unleash the demonic fire to attack the woman, while simultaneously, the Two-Headed Flood Dragon unleashed a barrage of punches, erupting in a torrential onslaught.</p><p>The woman feared the demonic fire, but while dodging, she inevitably neglected her defenses against other attacks.  Coupled with her previous injury, it wasn't long before Qin Sang seized another opportunity.</p><p>This time, he couldn't shred her body, but the Ebony Wood Sword managed to slice off a large chunk of her soul.</p><p>Right in front of Qin Sang, the woman fused the two parts of her soul back together, fully restored, her expression seemingly mocking.</p><p>Faced with the woman's provocation, Qin Sang remained cold and expressionless, silently unleashing another attack with his magic treasure, as if carrying out a series of futile actions.</p>
