<h1>Chapter 2195: Insect Cloud</h1><p>Seeing the enemy dispel the Void Domain power, Qin Sang could only summon the Grey Warbler Sword.</p><p>At that moment, Qin Sang sensed an unusual fluctuation emanating from Liuli.</p><p>Throughout their pursuit and escape, Liuli had kept her eyes closed, being carried by Qin Sang at high speed, secretly unsealing the Imperial Envoy Talisman.</p><p>A great battle was inevitable.  Moreover, the enemy was so well-prepared, having nearly neutralized Qin Sang's greatest advantage.  If she didn't want to become a burden, she had to unseal the Imperial Envoy Talisman and lend Qin Sang a hand.</p><p>A radiant light flashed behind Liuli's head, the scene within much the same as before.  However, the figure on the imperial throne seemed to be rising, its blurry features becoming clearer, an unparalleled aura of majesty washing over them.</p><p>It was as if a Celestial Emperor was about to step forth from the light and descend to the mortal realm!</p><p>Qin Sang, being closest to Liuli, felt this aura and couldn't help but feel awe.  Despite using thunder power to shield Liuli, her changes still attracted the opponent's attention.</p><p>The black-robed cultivator had just burst out of the golden light of the Void Domain power when a sword light struck, its intent sharp and close at hand.  He felt a sharp pain in his brow and, not daring to be careless, was about to defend against the sword light when a premonition washed over him.</p><p>The premonition didn't originate from Qin Sang, but from the female cultivator. Since their encounter, the female cultivator hadn't made any significant move; her cultivation level was indeed only at the early stage of the Void Refinement Realm, as previously ascertained.</p><p>Yet, he sensed a dangerous aura from her.</p><p>In an instant, the black-robed cultivator made a decision, trusting his intuition. Although their side had the advantage in numbers and strength, the fairy boy was activating the Annihilation Gourd, and the man in green robes was lagging behind due to his poor escape technique.  Now, he was facing both opponents alone.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>The black-robed cultivator expelled a burst of vital energy.</p><p>He concealed his face in the black robe. Looking into the opening of the robe's face, one could see only darkness, no true features.  Then a silver light flashed, a silver energy blasting towards the sword light.</p><p>This silver energy, of unknown origin, was incredibly dense and heavy.  Upon colliding with the sword light, it produced a deafening roar.</p><p>The Grey Warbler Sword felt as if it had struck a mountain. The silver energy stubbornly resisted the sword light, and the black-robed cultivator, instead of seizing the opportunity to attack, retreated back into the golden light.</p><p>The spiritual flower on his body, vibrant and supple, swayed, its center always focused on the Heaven-Binding Golden Lock. As long as the flower didn't wither, he could move freely within the golden light of the Void Domain.</p><p>Seeing that the Heaven-Binding Golden Lock couldn't restrain him, Qin Sang stopped his fruitless efforts, withdrawing the lock, while also noticing Liuli's actions.</p><p>The light behind Liuli's head flickered; the Emperor figure stood up, pointing a finger towards Liuli.</p><p>A stream of light entered Liuli's body. Liuli's face showed a flash of pain, and she suddenly waved her hand.</p><p>'Whoosh! Whoosh!'</p><p>The surrounding temperature plummeted, a cold wind sprang up, and a blizzard suddenly appeared.</p><p>In an instant, they were transported from the Wind and Fire Domain to a blizzard, surrounded by howling winds, a mixture of ice and fire, and the ever-present thick fog, creating utter chaos.</p><p>After the blizzard appeared, Qin Sang immediately felt the constraints of the Wind and Fire Domain weaken slightly.</p><p>Liuli was clearly using her ice-based abilities to counter the flames of the Nine-Turn Annihilation Wind, and with some success, but Qin Sang knew she couldn't hold on for long. They had to find a way to escape their predicament!</p><p>"To the Dragon Coil Cave!"</p><p>Liuli transmitted her voice with difficulty; in just a short time, she had endured tremendous pressure.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded.  Their only hope now lay in geographical advantage; within a radius of a thousand miles, the Dragon Coil Cave was possibly their only option.</p><p>Some seniors from Purple Cloud Mountain had entered the Dragon Coil Cave before, leaving behind some records. If those records were true, there was something inside they could use. Unfortunately, they had only circled the cave entrance before, not exploring it, and didn't know what changes had occurred.</p><p>Regardless, they had no choice but to go to the Dragon Coil Cave.</p><p>Seeing the black-robed cultivator retreat, Qin Sang decisively recalled the Grey Warbler Sword. He never intended to engage in a protracted battle here; otherwise, he would have already deployed his sword formation.</p><p>The next moment, Qin Sang and Liuli transformed into azure lightning again, escaping through the air, the blizzard following closely, entangled with the Nine-Turn Annihilation Wind.</p><p>Qing Lei's light now seemed less pure, because Qin Sang had incorporated sword-flight techniques, boosting their speed.  With him and Liuli working together, though not at their peak, they should be able to reach Panlong Cave before their pursuers caught up.</p><p>The robed cultivator immediately reacted, his form melting back into the shadows, hot on their heels.</p><p>As they fled, Qin Sang's mind raced. Their brief encounter had revealed much. The robed cultivator's reaction to the Gray Warbler Sword showed they hadn't prepared any countermeasures against his swordsmanship.</p><p>That was normal. The Immortal Child likely didn't know he'd entered the sacred grounds, nor anticipated his arrival.</p><p>A hastily planned operation couldn't cover every possibility.  Finding ways to counter thunder magic and the Heaven-Binding Golden Lock demonstrated considerable depth; truly worthy of someone close to the Yi Ren clan ancestor.</p><p>Thinking this, Qin Sang glanced at the pursuer, his sleeve rippling. A beam of five-elemental light shot forth.</p><p>The existence of the Five Elements Crown had already been revealed during the fight with the Lu family; it was no secret.</p><p>The sudden five-elemental light momentarily stalled the darkness that was the robed cultivator.  The dark line exploded into countless black threads, swirling wildly in the sky.</p><p>Where the multicolored light struck, over half the black threads solidified. Qin Sang had unleashed pure five-elemental light.</p><p>Moments later, the remaining threads coalesced in the nearby void, and the robed cultivator reappeared, continuing the chase.</p><p>"He's helpless against the Five Elements Crown!" Qin Sang thought.</p><p>The robed cultivator’s actions confirmed his suspicions. Even the Immortal Child's vast abilities couldn't counter everything.</p><p>Qin Sang looked to the sky.  The biggest problem now was the mysterious wind and fire.</p><p>Qin Sang continued his flight toward Panlong Cave, repeatedly using the Five Elements Crown to hinder the robed cultivator, preventing him from closing in.</p><p>Knowing the Crown's power, the robed cultivator evaded each attack, but couldn't shake Qin Sang.</p><p>A man in green robes followed unhurriedly, observing the chase. A look of understanding gradually dawned on his face.</p><p>Yuan Jian had already informed the Immortal Child and others of Qin Sang's abilities and powers. Even with improvements over a hundred years, they wouldn't be dramatic; his strengths and weaknesses were essentially known.  Liuli was the only unknown.</p><p>Liuli’s unleashing of the Heavenly Emperor’s Command Talisman had demonstrated impressive power, but also revealed its limitations.</p><p>The unknown is the most dangerous!</p><p>At this point, the man in green considered his understanding of Qin Sang and Liuli sufficient. His lips moved silently, chanting an incantation.</p><p>'Hum!'</p><p>A buzzing sound erupted.  Something sprang from the man's sleeve, several streaks of blood –  insects, something like bees and butterflies.</p><p>The buzzing was joined by other insect sounds; some high-pitched, some shrill.</p><p>'Chirp!'</p><p>'Squeak!'</p><p>…</p><p>The sounds grew louder, the insects more numerous. They emerged from his collar, sleeves, and trouser legs, a dense swarm quickly forming a cloud.</p><p>This was a rare insect cultivator. The cloud shimmered with colours, the insects chirping incessantly. Thousands, tens of thousands of them – incredible how many he'd hidden in his clothes!</p><p>The cloud shifted, forming various shapes. The man in green vanished, seemingly merging with the insects, becoming one with them.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>The insect cloud surged forward, its speed not inferior to the fleeing pair.</p><p>The robed cultivator, frustrated by being repeatedly repelled by the Five Elements Crown, was delighted at the new development.  He laughed, “Tang finally brings out his big guns!”</p><p>The man in green replied calmly, "My humble skills are nothing to boast about to Brother Qi.  Brother Qi knows my insect-control methods are different. I need to probe my opponent's abilities before deploying the appropriate insect formation.”</p><p>The robed cultivator knew this was modesty; the man in green had clearly fallen behind to let him test the duo's strength.  However, he didn't mind; it wasn't the time for infighting.</p><p>"Brother Si, you need to deploy the Nine-Turn Annihilation Wind! Tang, help me stop them!"</p><p>The man in green agreed, the buzzing of his insect cloud intensifying.</p><p>At this moment, Xian Tong, wielding the Extinction Gourd and riding a beast resembling a dragon horse, was rapidly approaching the battlefield.  His expression was filled with uncontainable anger and urgency.</p><p>A wave of insects, a dark cloud blotting out the sun, swept in. Qin Sang sensed something amiss, glanced back, and narrowed his eyes: "Insect cultivator?"</p><p>Since entering the Great Thousand World, Qin Sang had encountered various cultivators, many having found unique paths. Most cultivators would cultivate supplemental skills, raising a spirit beast or insect, but pure insect cultivators were exceptionally rare.</p><p>In the Great Thousand World, the Wu tribe was renowned for their mastery of insect control, a legacy spanning generations.  Legend even held that humankind's insect control techniques were stolen from the Wu tribe, though other races also possessed tribes specializing in this art.</p><p>Insect control had numerous schools of thought.  The most common involved meticulously selecting a spirit insect, growing together, cultivating a bond of life, as Qin Sang had learned from the Wu tribe. Alternatively, one could control other insects through their own spirit insect, as demonstrated by this person.</p><p>This individual cultivated many insects, most of which practiced poison techniques; they were all venomous insects, yet Qin Sang didn't sense any intense poison.</p><p>Unsure of the insect cloud's power, Qin Sang didn't dare to be careless. They were now near the Panlong Cave.  Qin Sang decisively activated the thunder talismans in his altar.  Immediately, thunder illuminated the heavens.</p><p>'Rumble!'</p><p>Thousands of lightning bolts coalesced into a seal.</p><p>The Five Thunder Heaven Heart Seal descended from the sky, striking the insect cloud – a bolt of azure lightning imbued with the power of the Azure Bird True Thunder.</p><p>Feeling the power of the lightning technique, Qin Sang felt slightly relieved.  The Wind and Fire Domain wasn't as powerful as he'd imagined.  The deployment of the thunder talismans was indeed affected, but only slightly slowing the summoning of the Azure Bird True Thunder.  The Thunder Escape technique required a continuous supply of Azure Bird True Thunder, but the Five Thunder Heaven Heart Seal only needed to absorb enough to maintain its power!</p><p>In the battle between experts, a moment's hesitation could mean defeat.  During the fight, missing an opportunity was possible, but Qin Sang's target was the insect cloud.</p><p>The cloud was massive; there was nowhere to hide.</p><p>The azure lightning pierced the void, wind and fire scattering before its unstoppable might, striking the heart of the insect cloud.</p><p>Sensing the thunder, the insect cloud paused in mid-air, writhing, attempting to evade.</p><p>However, the lightning was too fast; not all the insects could escape.  Various lights flickered on the cloud's surface, twisting like vibrant flames, ultimately forming the figure of a giant.</p><p>The giant was composed of countless points of light, bearing a resemblance to the man in green. He rose from the insect cloud, raised a hand, and grasped the lightning bolt.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The thunder exploded in his palm. The giant's hand shattered, his arm blown away, and the terrifying thunder rapidly spread through his body, disintegrating him inch by inch.</p><p>Each inch of his body disappearing meant the extinction of numerous light points, each connected to an insect in the cloud.</p><p>Inevitably, the insects were affected, some exploding, others depleted of their essence.</p><p>From the outside, the insect cloud rapidly shrank, revealing a strange sight: countless threads forming a dense network within.</p><p>The net exuded the aura of a spiritual treasure, already integrated into the cloud, its full extent unseen.</p><p>Using the insect cloud and the net, the man in green had withstood the Five Thunder Heaven Heart Seal. The insect cloud roiled, then a raspy voice echoed:</p><p>"Impressive lightning technique!"</p><p>Qin Sang inwardly lamented.  Thanks to his altar, he could now instantly cast the Five Thunder Heaven Heart Seal.  Had he not been affected by the wind and fire, even if this man could withstand the attack, it wouldn't have been easy. But without the Azure Bird True Thunder, while the speed of release would be instantaneous, the power would be diminished.</p><p>Just as he was thinking, Qin Sang felt a warning.  While the lightning struck the insect cloud, the man in black seized the opportunity to approach.</p><p>Qin Sang repeated his tactic, activating the Five Elements Crown.</p><p>By this time, the man in black could distinguish between the positive and reversed Five Elements divine light. Seeing that it was positive divine light, his body trembled slightly, a black shadow emerging and shielding him.</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>The shadow took the brunt of the positive Five Elements divine light, instantly stiffening, while the man in black flashed past.</p><p>The insect cloud regrouped, its momentum surging, transforming into a giant, taking a single step that spanned mountains, towering over Qin Sang and Liuli.</p><p>The two attacked together.  Qin Sang could only use his spiritual sword and lightning techniques to counter, while Liuli activated the Imperial Decree of the Heavenly Emperor talisman to assist him.</p><p>The man in green quickly noticed the abnormality.  He was one with the insect cloud; the insects were part of his body.  While they wouldn't be forcefully controlled like the spirit beasts of the Langxian Garden cultivators, there was a noticeable delay, causing him immense discomfort and anger.</p><p>"Qi brother, kill the woman!"</p>
