<h1>Chapter 533: Demonic Fire's Strange Transformation</h1><p>The bronze awl was incredibly agile. After missing its target, it immediately turned and continued to pursue Qin Sang.</p><p>Meanwhile, Wu Youdao, using some unknown secret technique, drastically increased his speed, rapidly closing the distance between himself and Qin Sang.</p><p>Just then, the distant airship noticed the commotion and changed course, accelerating to intercept Qin Sang's path.</p><p>Wu Youdao's eyes lit up. He suddenly shouted towards the airship, "Activate the Azure Fire Banner Formation!"</p><p>Upon hearing this command, the airship abruptly halted, positioned directly in front of the spot where Qin Sang had buried his treasure.</p><p>Nearly twenty figures flew out from the airship, all Foundation Establishment cultivators. The weakest among them were early-stage Foundation Establishment, while the strongest, including Cultivator Li, were at the pseudo Core Formation realm.</p><p>After exiting the airship, they hovered in mid-air. Three individuals, including Cultivator Li, retrieved azure triangular banners from their storage pouches.</p><p>These triangular banners were identical to the ones Qin Sang had seen on Divineç½¡ Peak!</p><p>*Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!*</p><p>The three simultaneously waved their hands, deploying the triangular banners.</p><p>The three azure banners spiraled upwards, positioning themselves in the void, forming a tripartite formation.</p><p>The remaining cultivators then channeled their internal Azure Yang Demonic Fire and directed it towards the banner formation, pouring their power unreservedly and continuously.</p><p>As the Azure Yang Demonic Fire continuously flowed into the formation, the banners glowed brighter, and a blue fireball gradually coalesced in their center.</p><p>The demonic fire blazed, radiating a ferocious aura.</p><p>Witnessing this, Qin Sang suddenly felt a sense of foreboding.</p><p>Among the twenty cultivators, only a few were truly powerful. With his current strength, he didn't consider any of them a threat individually, and even if they attacked together, Qin Sang was confident he could handle them easily.</p><p>However, the three azure banners appeared quite formidable. Once they formed the so-called Azure Fire Banner Formation, it would undoubtedly become a significant problem!</p><p>He would then be trapped between the airship and the cultivators, putting him in a very disadvantageous position.</p><p>The only solution was to disrupt the formation before it was complete.</p><p>However, Qin Sang was constantly entangled by Wu Youdao's bronze awl and couldn't break free. With Wu Youdao now so close, escaping would become even more difficult.</p><p>The relentless bronze awl thrust towards him once again.</p><p>This time, Qin Sang didn't evade. He directed his mental energy, guiding the Ebony Sword to clash head-on with the bronze awl.</p><p>*Clang!*</p><p>The two magical tools collided for the first time, both vibrating intensely.</p><p>The Azure Yang Demonic Fire on the bronze awl dimmed, and some of the golden rings on its surface cracked, quickly repairing themselves.</p><p>The Ebony Sword also flickered dimly.</p><p>At that moment, a strange blood-red light surged from the center of the Ebony Sword, instantly transforming it into a blood-red blade.</p><p>Seeing this, Wu Youdao suddenly felt a sense of foreboding. He reacted swiftly, attempting to recall the bronze awl, but he was a step too late.</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>The Ebony Sword swung, and the Blood Defilement Divine Light struck the bronze awl directly.</p><p>Instantly, the demonic fire on the bronze awl dissipated, the cracked golden rings stopped repairing, becoming dull and resembling patches of rust. The tool's spiritual essence was severely damaged!</p><p>The sneak attack with the Blood Defilement Divine Light had worked flawlessly once again.</p><p>As long as the opponent was unaware of the Ebony Sword's Blood Defilement Divine Light ability, it was almost impossible for the attack to fail.</p><p>The reason Qin Sang hadn't used the Blood Defilement Divine Light immediately was because he wasn't sure if the bronze awl was Wu Youdao's natal magical tool.</p><p>Although Wu Youdao had only recently formed his core, the Azure Yang Demonic Sect possessed profound resources, and he might have more than one magical tool.</p><p>Qin Sang had hoped to disable Wu Youdao's natal magical tool, which would significantly weaken him and increase Qin Sang's chances of escape, but now he couldn't afford to delay any longer.</p><p>The bronze awl flew back erratically into Wu Youdao's hand.</p><p>"Blood Defilement Divine Light!"</p><p>Seeing the miserable state of his magical tool, Wu Youdao was both shocked and furious. He never expected to encounter a magical tool crafted from one of the Ten Divine Woods.</p><p>With the bronze awl seemingly unusable and requiring a long period of nurturing to recover, Wu Youdao's hatred for Qin Sang intensified.</p><p>He glared coldly at the Ebony Sword, knowing that this ability couldn't be used a second time so soon. He immediately turned his palm inwards, striking his dantian.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>An emerald green gourd flew out from Wu Youdao's dantian. Initially only the size of a thumb, it rapidly expanded after leaving his dantian until it could barely be held in one hand.</p><p>The gourd flew above Wu Youdao's head, spinning before its opening pointed towards Qin Sang.</p><p>Through the opening, one could see another world of flames within the gourd's belly, burning with extremely pure Azure Yang Demonic Fire, ready to erupt.</p><p>"The bronze awl truly wasn't his natal magical tool!"</p><p>Qin Sang sighed inwardly, knowing he couldn't continue being entangled by Wu Youdao. He suddenly opened his right hand, revealing the object in his palm, pretending to throw it.</p><p>A wisp of energy was stimulated by Qin Sang.</p><p>"Void Thunder!"</p><p>Wu Youdao, who was activating the fire gourd, glanced over and his expression abruptly changed.</p><p>Void Thunder was increasingly rare, but Core Formation cultivators like him, even if they hadn't seen it personally, at least knew what it looked like and were well aware of its power.</p><p>If he were struck by Void Thunder, he might not live to see the next day.</p><p>Wu Youdao was startled and quickly dodged.</p><p>However, the Void Thunder was merely a ruse.</p><p>Qin Sang knew that Void Thunder had a limited range. Trying to kill an opponent in such an open space was wishful thinking, so he never intended to actually use it.</p><p>Very few had witnessed Void Thunder firsthand, and Wu Youdao certainly wouldn't gamble on whether he had truly activated it.</p><p>The facts proved Qin Sang right.</p><p>As Wu Youdao retreated, Qin Sang immediately took to his sword, flying forward with all his might. His sword light flashed like lightning, reaching the Foundation Establishment cultivators in an instant.</p><p>Wu Youdao realized he had been tricked, filled with regret, but it was too late to stop Qin Sang.</p><p>Cultivator Li remained calm under pressure, shouting, "Disperse!"</p><p>The other cultivators quickly scattered, but their formation, though seemingly disordered, maintained an internal connection. The three azure banners remained in place, unaffected.</p><p>The fireball within the formation suddenly swelled, transforming into a stream of fire that rushed towards Qin Sang.</p><p>The Azure Yang Demonic Fire released by some of the Foundation Establishment cultivators had undergone a transformation within the azure banners. This seemingly slender stream of fire was exceptionally pure, and Qin Sang didn't dare underestimate it.</p><p>However, after a brief moment of thought, Qin Sang took an unexpected action. He showed no intention of dodging, maintaining his speed and channeling his true energy, attempting to clash head-on with the fire stream.</p><p>The strength of Azure Yang Demonic Fire lay in its ability to cling like a leech to an opponent's spiritual energy or true essence upon contact, making it extremely difficult to remove.</p><p>Anyone else, knowing the power of Azure Yang Demonic Fire, would never dare to do such a thing.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang's apparent recklessness, the Azure Yang Demonic Sect cultivators sneered.</p><p>However, the next moment, their jaws nearly dropped in astonishment.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>Qin Sang forcibly dispersed the fire stream, only staggering slightly.</p><p>The scattered flames, which should have instantly attached to Qin Sang's true energy and burned fiercely, causing him great pain, instead extinguished like dying embers upon contact.</p>
