<h1>Chapter 115: Guyuan Kingdom</h1><p>The main ingredient for Foundation Establishment Pills cannot be cultivated; it's obtained from a secret realm deep within the Ancient Battlefield.</p><p>“Legend has it that the ancient immortals shattered the heavens and earth in their great war. This world's spiritual energy has since diminished, making cultivation more difficult than ever. Those naturally formed spiritual herbs have extremely demanding growth requirements and have become increasingly rare.  Nowadays, the easiest place to find spiritual herbs in our Xiaohan Region is within the depths of the Ancient Battlefield.  Remnants of ancient immortal caves and forbidden zones remain there, rarely trod upon by human feet. The Foundation Establishment Pills you consumed—their key ingredients were found in an ancient forbidden zone controlled by our sect, hence their scarcity.”</p><p>Elder Wen warned Qin Sang, “Countless dangers lurk within the depths of the Ancient Battlefield.  Our sect paid a considerable price to control this forbidden zone. Many weaker sects, even if fortunate enough to find one, lack the ability to break the restrictions and defend it. In the depths of the Ancient Battlefield, even Foundation Establishment cultivators can easily perish.  A low-level Qi Refining cultivator like yourself shouldn't entertain such thoughts.”</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't placed much hope on the path of alchemy anyway. Even with his full dedication to cultivation, he still lagged behind others.  If he dared to divide his attention further, his hope for immortality would be extinguished.  Thus, his spirits didn't remain low for long, and he took the opportunity to bring up his true purpose.</p><p>Upon learning that Qin Sang wished to borrow the identification token, Elder Wen didn't outright refuse.  He pondered, “You are not my kin. Although the sect doesn't explicitly forbid it, it's not appropriate to simply hand the token over to you.”</p><p>Qin Sang, who had already prepared spirit stones, was pondering the deeper meaning of Elder Wen’s words when the elder's tone shifted. “As it happens, I have a task at hand and lack the time to find someone else.  If you take on this task and handle it properly, I will give you the token as a reward upon your return.  This will also silence any gossip.”</p><p>Hearing this, Qin Sang felt a mixture of joy and worry. He was glad to keep his spirit stones, but worried that a task entrusted by a Foundation Establishment cultivator wouldn't be simple and might take considerable time.</p><p>He wasn't concerned about safety. His cultivation had soared, he possessed the Ebony Sword, and he had refined Sun De's Ten Directions Yama Banner.  His strength was now far beyond that of ordinary Qi Refining cultivators.  Even if he couldn't win in a dangerous encounter, self-preservation wouldn't be a problem.</p><p>While Qin Sang was lost in thought, Elder Wen tossed him a jade slip.</p><p>“The jade slip contains information about Guyuan Kingdom, which is under our sect’s jurisdiction.  The disciple stationed there is named Gu Tiannan, whose cultivation is similar to yours.  A few days ago, he sent a message reporting the unexplained disappearances of civilians in several locations within Guyuan Kingdom. Gu Tiannan later discovered that it was the work of a demonic entity but is no match for it.  He has requested the sect’s assistance.  Go and take a look.”</p><p>Qin Sang took the jade slip and examined it with his spiritual sense.</p><p>Guyuan Kingdom was a small nation.  According to the jade slip, it was even smaller than the Great Sui Dynasty and remotely located at the southeasternmost edge of Shaohua Mountain’s territory, practically within the Yun Cang Great Marsh.</p><p>Generally, cultivation sects rarely interfered in mortal affairs. Mortal kingdoms were managed by cultivation families affiliated with the sects.  Remote small nations like Guyuan Kingdom, without nearby cultivation families, would have one or two disciples stationed there.</p><p>Gu Tiannan, the protector of Guyuan Kingdom, was a native.  After joining Shaohua Mountain, due to his limited talent, he failed to break through to the tenth level of Qi Refining before the age of forty.  He subsequently gave up on pursuing immortality and willingly accepted the task of returning to his homeland to protect it.</p><p>Due to its remote location, Guyuan Kingdom had experienced multiple demonic disturbances, all of which were handled effectively by Gu Tiannan. His requests for help from the sect had always been timely. The jade slip contained mostly positive evaluations of him.</p><p>Dismissing Qin Sang, Elder Wen murmured, “If he is meticulous and efficient, he might prove reliable in the future.”</p><p>He seemed to have already concluded that Qin Sang had no hope of reaching Foundation Establishment.</p><p>…</p><p>The capital of Guyuan Kingdom was called Zecheng.</p><p>Suddenly returning to the mortal world from the secluded cultivation sect, seeing the bustling crowds on the streets, and feeling the familiar worldly atmosphere, Qin Sang couldn't help but feel a sense of nostalgia and reminiscence.  He realized that he had been away from the Great Sui for ten years.</p><p>Daoist Jixin, Mingyue, Princess Dongyang, Bai Jianglan, Wu Chuanzong, Shui Houzi…</p><p>Familiar faces flashed through his mind. For mortals, ten years could turn a child into a youth, and a robust middle-aged man into one with graying temples.</p><p>Would he ever have the chance to meet them again?</p><p>Qin Sang quickly collected his scattered thoughts, his gaze regaining its firmness. He stepped onto the street, found a steamed bun shop, devoured several baskets of meat buns, and then headed towards the eastern part of Zecheng.</p><p>East of Zecheng City, on Mount Xianglong, stood a secluded Taoist temple named Huilong Temple.  Home to only a master and his disciple, it lacked the bustling atmosphere of more popular temples and remained largely unknown except to the nearby villagers.</p><p>Walking the mountain path, Qin Sang reminisced about his time at Qingyang Temple. The memories, though simple, held a profound significance, likely because they represented the most peaceful period since his arrival in this world – a time he treasured deeply.</p><p>Since the temple was his fellow disciple's residence, Qin Sang observed proper etiquette, knocking gently on the door.</p><p>A moment later, the door opened a crack, revealing a fair-faced young man.</p><p>Qin Sang recognized him as a cultivator, at the seventh level of Qi Refining. "You must be Gu Yuan, Senior Brother Gu's disciple. I'm Qin Sang, sent here by our sect after receiving your master's letter."</p><p>The young man immediately threw open the door and bowed respectfully. "Greetings, Uncle Qin. My master is meditating in his chambers. Please join me in the guest room for tea while I inform him of your arrival."</p><p>Qin Sang readily agreed. After a short wait, he heard hurried footsteps and quickly rose to his feet. A white-haired Taoist priest rushed in, his eyes lighting up at the sight of Qin Sang.</p><p>"You must be Junior Brother Qin?"</p><p>"Senior Brother Gu, I am Qin Sang."</p><p>Qin Sang bowed slightly, observing his Senior Brother Gu Tiannan. The jade slip had mentioned he was over a hundred years old.  His hair was silver, and his face was alarmingly pale.</p><p>For some reason, seeing his senior brother's appearance made him uneasy.</p><p>Was he afraid of ending up like this himself?</p><p>Qin Sang scoffed inwardly.</p><p>"Junior Brother Qin, please sit," Gu Tiannan said warmly, pulling Qin Sang's arm. "You've achieved such a high level of cultivation at such a young age. Your future is boundless!"</p><p>Eager to return to his sect, Qin Sang dispensed with pleasantries and asked directly, "Senior Brother Gu, where is the malevolent entity hiding? When do you plan to act?"</p><p>Stroking his long beard, Gu Tiannan replied, "I apologize for troubling you with such a long journey, Junior Brother.  The entity is powerful, and I was left with no choice. Now, with your assistance, we will surely bring it down!"</p>
