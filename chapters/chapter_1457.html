<h1>**Chapter 1449: A Misunderstanding!**</h1><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>Great snow was falling.</p><p>Suddenly, a dazzling sword light pierced through the snowscape.</p><p>Around the sword light, the snowflakes dancing in the sky silently melted, and the storm subsided.</p><p>Immediately afterward, a figure followed the sword light, and Qin Sang easily escaped the influence of the Glacial Winter Talisman.</p><p>Shi Xue sensed the situation behind her. Seeing Qin Sang break free of the restrictions so quickly, she was even more horrified.</p><p>Qin Sang's figure paused slightly. His gaze shifted, and he saw Shi Xue frantically fleeing westward. He was about to attack, but suddenly sensed something, raised his eyes, and looked towards Shi Xue's front.</p><p>In his perception, there were two powerful auras rapidly approaching from there. No wonder Shi Xue was fleeing towards them.</p><p>"As expected, it's Profound Heaven Palace , and she's not alone! Two Nascent Soul Stage  middle-stage elders came at once, truly befitting of being the number one sect of the Northern Sea! Who knows how many other experts are around, rushing here..."</p><p>Qin Sang's thoughts raced. He swiftly scanned the surroundings with his divine sense, confirmed that no more people had appeared for the time being, and surprisingly did not choose to flee. He pointed his finger at the Golden Submergence Sword  and rapidly made a sword incantation.</p><p>The Golden Submergence Sword trembled lightly and suddenly shot out swiftly.</p><p>The sound of the sword cry was similar to the roar of a dragon and the howl of a tiger, and also like a thunderclap, shaking the soul.</p><p>Although the surrounding area was not covered by the power of the Glacial Winter Talisman, under the influence of the cold, the sunlight had become quite dim, entering a winter night.</p><p>In this dark and cold world.</p><p>The Golden Submergence Sword bloomed with dazzling light, streaking across the sea like a shooting star, pointing directly at the back of Shi Xue's neck.</p><p>Then, the Thunder Wings  on Qin Sang's back flapped, and his true body followed closely behind.</p><p>Shi Xue sensed the extremely sharp aura behind her, her spine turning cold, feeling a sting in the back of her neck, her pupils shrinking violently.</p><p>At the same time, Elder Lan and Elder Mei also saw this scene. They exchanged a glance and both saw the shock in each other's eyes.</p><p>Although Shi Xue's cultivation was slightly weaker, her strength was not weak, and she was currently in charge of the Snow Listening Pavilion  lineage and had quite some wealth.</p><p>Looking at the situation there, Shi Xue had even used the Glacial Winter Talisman, but she had still fallen into a disadvantageous position, and it was a complete defeat. She was fleeing for her life!</p><p>Her opponent was only one person, and it had only been such a short time!</p><p>Who exactly was he?</p><p>The two elders' hearts were filled with stormy waves. They flew with all their might, while also gazing at the figure chasing Shi Xue. They only saw a ball of silver-white lightning.</p><p>The opponent had clearly discovered them but had no intention of fleeing, recklessly pursuing Shi Xue.</p><p>Whether this person was naturally vindictive or had other intentions, it was enough to show that this person had strong confidence in his own strength.</p><p>The two elders' mood was extremely heavy. They had probably greatly underestimated their opponent!</p><p>Shi Xue was in danger, and the situation was urgent.</p><p>They had no time to think carefully and hastily summoned their magical treasures .</p><p>Elder Mei flicked his finger, and tiny snow-white whirlpools inexplicably appeared at his fingertips, seemingly with countless frigid energies flowing inside. Then, a drop of ice water was conceived and dripped from his fingertip.</p><p>'Crack, crack, crack...'</p><p>The sea surface suddenly froze, and an icy path appeared, rapidly spreading towards Shi Xue.</p><p>Elder Lan had an unknown transparent bracelet in his hand and tossed it out.</p><p>The bracelet spun rapidly, not heading towards Qin Sang, but flying into the high sky. In the process, the bracelet's size swelled rapidly, and with its dazzling light, it was as if an extra full moon had appeared in the sky.</p><p>This was Elder Lan's famous magical treasure, the Sun-Snatching Ring .</p><p>However, at this time, the Golden Submergence Sword was already very close to Shi Xue.</p><p>Seeing that she was about to be pierced through the back of her neck by the spiritual sword , Shi Xue did not dare to place all her hopes on the two elders. She grabbed the jade pendant on her waist, on which was engraved the pattern of a door.</p><p>The jade pendant shone brightly, and Shi Xue's figure disappeared into thin air.</p><p>The next moment, a halo lit up in the void not far away, and Shi Xue stumbled and appeared, her face even paler, and the jade pendant in her hand was already shattered.</p><p>But the crisis had not been resolved!</p><p>The familiar stinging sensation reappeared. The speed of the spiritual sword and the opponent's reaction were beyond imagination, without any pause, approaching again.</p><p>Shi Xue had not yet recovered. Seeing this, her mind tensed up again.</p><p>At this time, the support finally arrived.</p><p>The ice-crystal path had unknowingly spread under Shi Xue's feet, stopping abruptly, and then rising upward. Layers of ice spread out, instantly piecing together into an ice shield behind Shi Xue.</p><p>'Thump!'</p><p>With a muffled sound, the Golden Submergence Sword struck the ice shield.</p><p>Ice shards flew everywhere, and the ice shield shattered, but it successfully blocked this sword. Moreover, a continuous stream of ice crystals spread up, and a new ice shield was instantly formed.</p><p>Almost at the same moment.</p><p>The moon in the sky was dazzling, and the ring mouth aimed at Qin Sang's true body behind him, shooting out a pillar of light.</p><p>Qin Sang sensed something, and his body suddenly shifted, but he was still grazed by the moonlight. Then, he felt a vast power that could freeze the bone marrow pouring down from the high sky, accompanied by an unknown power fluctuation.</p><p>Qin Sang's first reaction was to summon the Nascent Soul Puppet  to bear the brunt for him. This action was so skilled that it was almost instinctive.</p><p>But then Qin Sang discovered that the fluctuation was somewhat familiar, similar to the ice seal confinement just now.</p><p>His expression changed slightly, and he gave up the idea of summoning the Nascent Soul Puppet. He activated the Ruyi Treasure Pearl  in his Qi Sea , and a layer of light golden astral shield  immediately appeared outside his body.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The great force collided with the astral shield.</p><p>The astral shield shrank for a while, flickering uncertainly, but stubbornly resisted this blow and did not shatter.</p><p>"Not bad!"</p><p>Qin Sang nodded secretly. He was very satisfied with the Ruyi Treasure Pearl's performance in its first battle.</p><p>As for the ice seal confinement, as Qin Sang expected, under the effect of the Fire Armor , its impact on him was very minimal.</p><p>On the other side.</p><p>Shi Xue, who had successfully been rescued, had just breathed a sigh of relief when she turned her head and saw Elder Lan's Sun-Snatching Ring displaying its power. She suddenly remembered that she had only cared about escaping and had not had time to remind them. She shouted urgently, "The Glacial Winter Talisman is ineffective against him..."</p><p>Elder Lan immediately realized after hearing this.</p><p>The confinement power of the Glacial Winter Talisman and the Sun-Snatching Ring were nearly of the same origin. If the Glacial Winter Talisman was completely ineffective, the Sun-Snatching Ring would not perform much better.</p><p>He hurriedly urged the magical treasure, trying to expand the confinement power, and mobilized the seawater to construct an ice cage to trap Qin Sang for a moment, but it was too late.</p><p>Qin Sang was unharmed and easily stepped out of the pillar of light.</p><p>With a sway of his figure, the light golden astral shield was withdrawn, and he silently made a sword incantation.</p><p>'Swish! Swish! Swish!'</p><p>Swords transformed into ten thousand, blotting out the sky.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>In a flash of light and darkness, the ice shield exploded.</p><p>Shi Xue's almond eyes widened, and the words that followed were forcibly swallowed back. The familiar sense of crisis welled up in her heart again.</p><p>Just then, two phantoms appeared in front of her.</p><p>The two elders had finally arrived.</p><p>Elder Mei flicked his sleeve and forcefully pushed Shi Xue away, getting her away from the danger.</p><p>This attack failed again.</p><p>But Qin Sang was not angry, but happy, the corners of his mouth slightly upturned. He silently chanted in his heart, "Seven Souls Slaughter Array !"</p><p>This was the moment he had been waiting for, to trap both elders in the sword array  in one fell swoop!</p><p>Silently.</p><p>The two elders only felt that the surrounding light had become even dimmer than before. They both had a dangerous premonition and, without saying a word, rushed outward to the left and right, shouting in unison!</p><p>"Misunderstanding..."</p>
