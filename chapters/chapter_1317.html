Chapter 1309: The Final Move

The Demon Lord Ye fled into the Palace of Sinful Deities.
Moreover, the Sin Abyss no longer had the confidence to defeat the Demon Lord Ye within the Palace of Sinful Deities.
Although it sounded somewhat unbelievable, this was the only reason that could explain why the Sin Abyss had so readily opened the Palace of Sinful Deities to them.
"How much more do you know?"
The Nether Demon Lord stared coldly into the eyes of Elder Canghong, his voice icy as he questioned, "What exactly is the Demon Lord Ye planning?"
Even if the Demon Lord Ye turned the Palace of Sinful Deities upside down, the alliance of the two realms wouldn't care. The real problem was that the Palace of Sinful Deities was connected to the Purple Palace. The Demon Lord Ye's true target was likely the Purple Palace.
They would never allow anyone to destroy the Purple Palace!
Elder Canghong's expression remained calm as he said, "I have already guessed how the Demon Lord Ye opened the Immortal Gate. However, Fellow Daoist Nether, rest assured. The passage between the Palace of Sinful Deities and the Purple Palace is unique. As long as the Purple Palace remains sealed, the Demon Lord Ye will never be able to enter. For now, he can only hide within the Palace of Sinful Deities. Therefore, the next time, we must join forces to trap and kill the Demon Lord Ye within the Palace of Sinful Deities!"
Elder Ji sneered, "So, we are to become your pawns in dealing with the Demon Lord Ye? Elder Canghong, your calculations are truly impressive. I am in awe!"
Elder Canghong was straightforward, "The Demon Lord Ye is the strongest in the Northern Star Realm. He has meticulously imprisoned Nascent Souls, whether for cultivating demonic arts or crafting sinister artifacts. This is no small matter and must not be underestimated. The safest course of action is for all the experts of the Northern Star Realm to join forces in this hunt. If we of the Sin Abyss fail to defeat the Demon Lord Ye and are instead slaughtered, Fellow Daoist Ji, do you really believe that the Frost Domain and the Heavenly Alliance can remain unscathed? The Palace of Sinful Deities is our best opportunity. Once the tiger is released back into the mountains, the consequences will be unimaginable. Without my guidance, even if you forcefully occupy the Abyssal Ruins, you will achieve nothing within the Palace of Sinful Deities. After the negotiations, I will reveal everything I know, and we can formulate a plan together."
Elder Zhenyi snorted, "For the sake of a few Withered Origin Pills, you recklessly waged war, killing countless cultivators from both realms over the years. Do you think you can simply walk away from this? That would be far too lenient!"
Elder Canghong slowly shook his head, "Old Ox-Nose, do not think that just because the alliance of the two realms is powerful, you can act as you please. If this war continues, we will fight to the death. Even if you win, it will be a pyrrhic victory. The Purple Palace will open soon. If we exhaust ourselves fighting each other, you will have no time to recover. How much strength will you have left to deal with the Demon Lord Ye? Can you honestly say you are not tempted by the secrets of the Demon Lord Ye? Once he is eliminated, the benefits will naturally be shared by all!"
He threatened with the prospect of a fight to the death and appealed to their greed.
Elder Zhenyi sneered, unafraid, "Elder Canghong, your courage is commendable. However, I am curious to see how many will join you in this fight to the death."
Elder Canghong frowned slightly, inwardly sighing that the alliance of the two realms was not so easily dealt with. He glanced at Fairy Qiuzhi.
The two whispered to each other for a moment, and then Fairy Qiuzhi gently closed her beautiful eyes, her red lips moving slightly as if she were using a secret technique to communicate with someone and seek their opinion.
The only person in the Sin Abyss who could warrant such attention was Elder Tianzheng, who was still recovering from severe injuries.
Before long, Fairy Qiuzhi nodded to Elder Canghong and stepped forward, saying, "The plains you have seized will no longer be contested by the Sin Abyss. Consider it compensation. From now on, the boundary will be set three hundred miles outside Yu City, and a thousand-year pact will be established. The Frost Domain and the Heavenly Alliance must not take any actions detrimental to the Sin Abyss, and the Sin Abyss will do the same!"
The expressions of the crowd shifted slightly.
The Sin Abyss had finally offered something substantial.
The plains bordered the Sin Abyss, and they could not hold onto them indefinitely. The Sin Abyss's willingness to cede the plains and avoid future conflicts was a decent condition.
Of course, this was still not enough!
While Elder Zhenyi and the others communicated via voice transmission, Qin Sang's gaze remained fixed on Fairy Qiuzhi. Suddenly, he spoke up, "Fairy, are you contacting Elder Tianzheng? How is his recovery progressing?"
Fairy Qiuzhi always felt that Qin Sang's gaze carried something unusual, which made her uncomfortable. She frowned slightly and replied, "Thank you for your concern, Fellow Daoist Qin. Elder Tianzheng is currently using a secret technique to heal his injuries and cannot appear. He will recover fully in due time."
"Is that so?"
Qin Sang chuckled meaningfully, "For some reason, I have a premonition that I may never see Elder Tianzheng again."
His words struck like a thunderbolt, leaving everyone on the platform stunned.
Qu Huan looked at Qin Sang in astonishment, wondering why he would say such a thing.
During the chaos in Yu City, Elder Tianzheng had been recovering from his injuries at the Starstead Sect and was not present. Later, the Demon Lord Ye had been pursued by Elder Canghong, leaving no opportunity for him to act.
Fairy Qiuzhi's pupils contracted sharply, her voice icy as she coldly demanded, "What do you mean by that, Fellow Daoist?"
Qin Sang replied indifferently, "It was just a sudden thought. Based on my past experiences, whether it's crafting artifacts, setting up formations, or cultivating demonic arts, a core or something akin to a main soul is always required. Among the Nascent Souls imprisoned by the Demon Lord Ye, most are newly ascended Nascent Souls, none of whom are capable of fulfilling such a role. Someone like the Demon Lord Ye never acts without purpose. Before the Blood Pool battle, his objectives were largely achieved, and he was already planning how to conclude this. By self-destructing his Blood Demon Avatar, he not only secured the Jade Bone but also used others to kill, exchanging it for a mid-stage Nascent Soul. A single move with multiple benefits!"
Of course, his confidence in this judgment was not solely based on these reasons.
He was the only one who had faced the Demon Lord Ye's Blood Demon Avatar twice.
The first encounter was in the Abyssal Ruins, where he was pursued by the Blood Demon Avatar. The pressure was immense, and even with the Snake King's help, they were no match. They had to exhaust all their means to escape with their lives.
The second encounter was in the Blood Lake.
With the aid of the Eighteen Demon Banners and the control of demonic flames, Qin Sang's strength had greatly increased. As he fought the Blood Demon Avatar alone, he faintly sensed that the pressure it exerted on him had lessened.
Later, when the Demon Lord Ye decisively self-destructed his Blood Demon Avatar, Qin Sang was greatly surprised.
Outsiders might not have noticed, but Qin Sang knew that the Blood Demon Avatar was not yet at the end of its strength. He had marveled at the Demon Lord Ye's ruthlessness, willing to self-destruct such a powerful avatar without hesitation.
At the time, Qin Sang had not realized that the Sin Abyss was also part of the Demon Lord Ye's scheme. He had thought that the Demon Lord Ye valued the Jade Bone highly and could not afford to lose it, hence the self-destruction for the sake of certainty. He had not thought much of it then.
Now, looking back, he could finally see the strangeness in it all.
By self-destructing the avatar, the Demon Lord Ye not only secured the Jade Bone but also cut off Elder Tianzheng's escape route. He used his enemies to severely injure Elder Tianzheng, removing a future obstacle.
Elder Tianzheng, severely injured, would undoubtedly be the most tempting target for the Demon Lord Ye. How could he resist?
Qin Sang had initially been uncertain, thinking that Elder Tianzheng would surely be on guard against the Demon Lord Ye. As long as he remained hidden in the Starstead Sect, the Demon Lord Ye would find it difficult to act, and the risk would be too great.
But the feigned sincerity of Elder Canghong and Fairy Qiuzhi only deepened Qin Sang's suspicions. He was now sixty to seventy percent certain!
