<h1></h1><p>So chaotic!</p><p>Standing atop the mountain, everyone shared the same thought as they beheld the scene beyond.  Even from this vantage point, they could discern little.</p><p>The Unseen Immortal Sect was not only shrouded in swirling mists, but the sea of fog also shimmered with a kaleidoscope of colors. The lights of various restrictions and spirit formations flickered erratically, while countless flying swords drifted through the void, creating a scene of utter chaos.  Straining their eyes, they could only make out vague, overlapping mountain silhouettes. The Unseen Immortal Sect exuded an aura of profound mystery.</p><p>The mountaintop had been leveled into a platform. Judging from the remnants, this was once the entrance to the Unseen Immortal Sect.  Several teleportation formations had been constructed on the platform, presumably leading to different locations within the sect, all arranged in an orderly fashion.  Behind each formation stood a stone stele bearing inscriptions.</p><p>However, these teleportation formations had long been destroyed from the other side, beyond repair. The steles, surely protected by restrictions in their prime, now lay in shattered fragments.  Deciphering the surviving characters on the broken steles, they could identify words like "Valley," "Hall," and "Pavilion," but most were mere fragments, offering only vague clues to the purpose of these places.</p><p>At the center of the platform, several teleportation formation sites clearly held greater significance. One stele had miraculously retained its complete inscription – Earth Phase Hall!</p><p>Four other formations, alongside the Earth Phase Hall formation, encircled another teleportation array.</p><p>Su Zinan pointed at these formations. "As several fellow Daoists have mentioned, these should be the core of the Unseen Immortal Sect.  This unmarked formation, guarded by the Five Phases Halls, clearly holds paramount importance. Is the Five Elements Crown, the sect's most treasured artifact, housed here?"</p><p>As he spoke, he looked inquiringly at Zhu Wudao, the Strange-Faced Man, and the others.</p><p>The Strange-Faced Man remained silent.</p><p>Unwilling to antagonize Su Zinan at this juncture, Zhu Wudao replied while observing the sect, "When the Unseen Immortal Sect met its tragic end, its heritage was scattered, and the Five Elements Crown vanished without a trace. No one knows its whereabouts. It may still lie hidden somewhere within this ruined domain, gathering dust, or it may have already been taken away…"</p><p>"In that case," Su Zinan paused, then continued as Zhu Wudao nodded, a satisfied smile playing on his lips, "the Five Elements Crown is unclaimed. Whoever finds it, keeps it.  I trust that none of you will resort to claims of 'ancient rights' and cling to it relentlessly."</p><p>"If it were widely known, would I dare use the Five Elements Crown to summon the sect's descendants?" Zhu Wudao's gaze fixed on a specific direction, as if he had spotted something he sought. "The Five Elements Crown is merely one of the Unseen Immortal Sect's many treasured artifacts, the least known of them. Back then, only the true inheritors of each lineage knew of its existence…"</p><p>It turned out that the bizarre statue worshipped by the Gu God Cult, with a crown composed of five crude jade pieces on its head, was the image of the Five Elements Crown. Zhu Wudao had used this image to rally the hidden descendants of the Unseen Immortal Sect through the Gu God Cult.</p><p>While Zhu Wudao surveyed the surroundings, others also strained to identify the various features within the sect, speculating about the nature of the hidden grounds, with little success.</p><p>The only certainty was that the northeastern region, heavily layered with immortal restrictions and shrouded in overlapping peaks, radiated a distinct immortal aura that even the chaotic landscape couldn't entirely conceal.  It was undoubtedly a crucial area of the Unseen Immortal Sect!  The Five Phases Halls were most likely located in that direction.</p><p>Having found his target, Zhu Wudao took the lead, sweeping down the mountain.</p><p>Based on his actions, no one present could match his knowledge of the Unseen Immortal Sect. Everyone immediately followed Zhu Wudao down the mountain.</p><p>"Hmm? The flight restriction has weakened."</p><p>Not far down the slope, Mo Xingdao was the first to notice the change.  He leaped, rising two zhang before feeling the pressure and the sensation of being locked onto by flying swords.</p><p>Others followed suit, confirming his observation.</p><p>The Swordsman gazed ahead, pondering, "The chaos within the Unseen Immortal Sect is not merely superficial.  The restrictions and spirit formations here defy conventional logic. Some areas have weaker restrictions, allowing for higher flight, while others are stronger."</p><p>"Indeed!"  Zhu Wudao, without pausing or turning back, replied, "Fellow Daoists, proceed with caution. Should any unforeseen event occur, it might affect others."</p><p>Heeding his words, they continued their low-altitude flight.</p><p>Reaching the foot of the mountain, they found a vast expanse of desolate stone beach stretching as far as the eye could see, littered with rubble and devoid of vegetation.</p><p>Zhu Wudao flew onto the beach, abruptly stopped, looked down, and picked up a bone-white fragment.</p><p>This was no ordinary stone, but a fragment of meticulously refined spirit material, yet it didn't resemble a broken magical treasure.</p><p>The entire beach was covered in these fragments, countless in number.</p><p>Others soon discovered the true nature of the stone beach.</p><p>At that moment, the surface fragments began to tremble, and a rumbling sound emanated from below, like the pulse of the earth.</p><p>"What's that sound?" Su Zinan's expression changed slightly, a sense of foreboding washing over him.</p><p>Even as a descendant of a Soul Transformation cultivator, he dared not lower his guard within the Unseen Immortal Sect. This was no mere Soul Transformation domain, but a place filled with unknown dangers.</p><p>The tremors intensified.</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>The ground exploded.</p><p>Followed by a series of explosions across the stone beach. Amidst the booming sounds, fragments flew as bizarre shadows erupted from the ground.</p><p>Before their emergence, Zhu Wudao and the others hadn't sensed any living presence.</p><p>The shadows, upon emerging, made no sound and emitted no discernible aura, turning uniformly toward Zhu Wudao and the others.</p><p>"Battle Formation Puppets!"  Zhu Wudao recognized the shadows, his expression darkening.</p><p>These were puppets crafted by the Unseen Immortal Sect, designed in various forms for optimal coordination within battle formations. They were pure killing machines, created for war, programmed to indiscriminately attack any intruders upon sensing their presence.</p><p>Although Zhu Wudao had inherited the Unseen Immortal Sect's legacy, he couldn't control the ruined domain, and these battle formation puppets wouldn't recognize him.</p><p>The puppets' eyes were hollow and lifeless.</p><p>Being stared at by so many puppets, even these powerful cultivators felt a tightening in their chests.</p><p>In the next instant, the air filled with the whistling sound of projectiles.</p><p>*Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!*</p><p>Their vision momentarily obscured, the battle formation puppets surged towards them, engulfing the stone beach in a dark wave.</p><p>Their keen senses told them that these puppets weren't individually powerful, many being damaged and incomplete, unable to form a cohesive formation. They posed no mortal threat.</p><p>However, their sheer numbers were overwhelming, and with their companions lagging behind, they were forced to fight alone.</p><p>"Charge!"</p><p>Without needing Zhu Wudao's prompting, everyone understood their only option.</p><p>In an instant, Su Zinan and the others unleashed their magical treasures and divine abilities, charging into the sea of puppets, attempting to carve a path through.</p><p>Each of them was a peak cultivator, capable of obliterating a swathe of puppets with a single wave of their hand, reducing them to fragments.</p><p>However, the puppets on the stone beach seemed endless, and their numbers never dwindled.  Furthermore, lacking coordination and wary of each other, they fought individually, expending more effort than necessary.</p><p>Su Zinan maintained a moderate pace, keeping his distance from everyone, including Mo Xingdao.  He raised his right hand, five dragon tendons coiled around his fingers, connected to a dragon tendon net. The net fluttered like a butterfly, ensnaring groups of puppets.  With a tightening of the tendons, the puppets were crushed into fragments.</p><p>Su Zinan's expression remained calm as his eyes flickered, subtly scanning the backs of Zhu Wudao and the others, deep in thought.</p><p>Suddenly, a premonition struck him, and he abruptly looked up!</p><p>The clouds above rippled, revealing flickering lights within, appearing and disappearing erratically.</p><p>They had just witnessed this phenomenon – the sign of agitated flying swords, poised to attack!</p><p>Their intrusion onto the stone beach had not only awakened the puppets but also triggered the flying sword formation.</p><p>Su Zinan cursed inwardly. He flicked his fingers, sending streaks of blood light shooting upwards, converging above his head to form a blood-red plaque. The plaque then shattered with a *bang*, unleashing a visible blood-red ring that swept outwards.</p><p>Touched by the blood light, the puppets' joints seemed to seize, their movements slowing drastically.  Su Zinan swiftly flicked his right hand, deploying the dragon tendon net above him, forming a protective barrier.</p><p>Simultaneously, a deafening roar echoed from above.</p><p>A forest of flying swords descended from the sky!</p><p>In an instant, everyone vanished from sight, swallowed by a sea of flying swords and puppets.</p><p>Zhu Wudao, shielded by a golden mirror, bore the brunt of the falling swords. Bathed in golden light, he repelled nearby puppets, resolutely charging towards his chosen direction.</p><p>His destination wasn't the northeastern region where the others believed the Unseen Immortal Sect's core lay, but slightly off-course, towards the true north.</p><p>Since entering the stone beach, the Swordsman had stayed close behind Zhu Wudao, wielding a heavy sword with a peculiar style.</p><p>He used saber techniques with his sword.</p><p>His movements were strange, yet potent, concealing his true identity.</p><p>The heavy sword cleaved through the puppet horde with unstoppable force.</p><p>As the flying swords descended, the Swordsman remained calm amidst the chaos.  His sword flashed around him, creating a cage of saber light, his gaze locked on Zhu Wudao.</p><p>Elsewhere, the Strange-Faced Man and the Weeping Spirit Cave Master had somehow joined forces.</p><p>Above the Weeping Spirit Cave Master hovered a red flower.</p><p>This treasure emitted a radiant light that repelled the puppets, or, when reversed, could absorb the flying swords, demonstrating remarkable versatility.</p><p>However, the most at ease was the Strange-Faced Man.</p><p>His feet never touched the ground, instead resting on a thick, dragon-like vine. The vine's ends were deeply embedded in the ground, carrying him smoothly across the terrain.</p><p>Whenever puppets approached, thinner vines would shoot out from the main vine, ensnaring them and dragging them underground.</p><p>As the flying swords rained down, the Strange-Faced Man reacted similarly to Su Zinan, launching countless vines upwards to weave a protective net.</p><p>Glancing at Zhu Wudao's position, the Strange-Faced Man transmitted his voice, "Cave Master, I'll trouble you to follow that old devil Zhu.  I need to make a quick trip to the Wood Phase Hall to obtain a certain secret technique, then I'll join you immediately."</p><p>The Weeping Spirit Cave Master frowned in displeasure.</p><p>Sensing his dissatisfaction, the Strange-Faced Man offered further explanation, "That old devil Zhu is treacherous.  We must be wary of him tampering with the teleportation formation to the Celestial Harmony Hall, leading us into a trap. This secret technique is equally crucial, no less important than the immortal halls.  Zhu Wudao is heading in a different direction than the Wood Phase Hall, so we must split up.  I've already sworn a Heart Demon Oath and a Karmic Oath to you, Cave Master.  What more do you need to be reassured? Zhu Wudao's disciples and followers haven't arrived yet. As long as you remain vigilant, there shouldn't be any problems."</p><p>Ultimately, the Weeping Spirit Cave Master heeded the Strange-Faced Man's suggestion and pursued Zhu Wudao alone.</p><p>The Strange-Faced Man observed for a moment, then pushed off with his foot, causing the vine to abruptly change direction, heading east.</p><p>The White-Robed Man remained at the rear.</p><p>Surrounded by puppets and flying swords, he was more cautious than the others, immediately slowing his pace. Steam billowed from his body, forming a thick armor of water.</p><p>The armor appeared fragile.</p><p>*Thud thud* sounds continued as puppets and flying swords struck the armor, unable to penetrate it, keeping the White-Robed Man securely protected.</p><p>He advanced unhurriedly, showing no intention of speeding up even after losing sight of Zhu Wudao.</p><p>Eventually, he stopped, waited for a while, and stealthily moved away from the others.</p><p>Mo Xingdao likely knew the least about the Unseen Immortal Sect among those present.  He had only recently begun gathering information about the sect, whereas Su Zinan had learned some secrets from Old Devil Lu.</p><p>His agreement with Su Zinan ended after their exploration of the Illusory Delusion Hall. Their later alliance under Zhu Wudao's invitation was temporary, and Su Zinan wouldn't share any secrets with him.</p><p>Aside from the Five Elements Crown, he wasn't aware of any other treasures within the Unseen Immortal Sect.</p><p>However, Mo Xingdao was certain of one thing: following Zhu Wudao couldn't be wrong!</p><p>After a fierce charge, Zhu Wudao finally broke free from the stone beach.</p><p>Ahead lay a canyon, overgrown with wild grass, appearing equally inhospitable.</p><p>Ignoring those following him, Zhu Wudao continued without hesitation, plunging into the canyon.  The Swordsman and the Weeping Spirit Cave Master soon followed.</p><p>As Mo Xingdao emerged from the stone beach, he realized Su Zinan was gone.  The man hadn't followed, his whereabouts unknown.</p><p>After a brief moment of contemplation, Mo Xingdao decided to ignore Su Zinan and proceed alone.</p><p>…</p><p>Two figures flashed onto the mountaintop – Purple Thunder True Person and Yue Lingtian.</p><p>They looked down at the scene below.</p><p>The stone beach had become a chaotic sea of puppets and flying swords, making it impossible to discern the movements of the others.</p><p>While Yue Lingtian examined the steles, Purple Thunder True Person took out a jade talisman, held it in his hand, sensed for a moment, then said, "Let's go," and flashed onto the stone beach.</p><p>Yue Lingtian followed closely behind.</p><p>Before descending, Yue Lingtian glanced back, a slight frown creasing his brow.</p><p>With the Cloud Dragon's transformation, he wasn't sure if Hua Chenzi could arrive in time.</p><p>…</p><p>Not long after Purple Thunder True Person and Yue Lingtian entered the stone beach, Qin Sang reached the mountaintop, echoing the sentiment, "So chaotic!"</p><p>"Flight restrictions, flying sword formations, a sea of puppets… The Unseen Immortal Sect must have been attacked in its prime, and the mountain gate was forcibly sealed during the battle, plunging these restrictions into dormancy.  Now, they've reactivated, awakened by the presence of living beings…"</p><p>Qin Sang analyzed the events of the past based on these clues.</p><p>The hasty sealing of the mountain gate suggested that many treasures within the sect hadn't been moved in time.</p><p>Sweeping his gaze across the area, Qin Sang didn't rush down, instead examining the inscriptions on the steles.</p><p>"Earth Phase Hall…some teahouse…hmm?  Láng Huán…"</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes lit up.</p><p>Legend had it that Láng Huán was the name of the Unseen Immortal Sect's scripture repository.</p><p>The Unseen Immortal Sect wouldn't name things carelessly.  This "Láng Huán" must be where the sect's scriptures were stored!</p>
