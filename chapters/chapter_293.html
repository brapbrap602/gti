<h1>Chapter 286: Three Bows and Nine Kowtows</h1><p>Yan Wu seized the opportunity to escape the engulfing vortex, finally reaching the tunnel at the last moment and escaping danger.</p><p>“Thank you, Senior Yu, for saving my life.”</p><p>Yan Wu, despite his seemingly rough exterior, was a grateful man.  His face was full of gratitude as he bowed deeply to Yu Kongxing, almost to the point of tears and prostration.</p><p>It seemed exaggerated, but given that his life had been saved, everyone understood.</p><p>After this incident, the others looked at Yu Kong with less suspicion.</p><p>Luo Xingnan and Sheng Yuanzi's earlier words had sown some seeds of discord, but now they were mostly dispelled. The atmosphere within the group eased considerably.</p><p>Having passed through the grand formation and entered the grotto without serious incident, everyone's initial anxiety subsided, and they hurriedly began to observe their surroundings.</p><p>A fierce wind howled, and torrential rain poured down.</p><p>The wind was sharp, and the rain was cold. Although they were all cultivators, they found it difficult to endure, and each activated their spiritual energy for protection.</p><p>Strangely, the raindrops vanished after landing on them or the ground, as if they were an illusion. Yet, they were real, as the impact and force of the raindrops could be clearly felt.</p><p>This wind and rain were actually manifestations of chaotic spiritual energy.  Not all of the grotto was subjected to the downpour; other areas were scorched by heavenly fire, while others were choked by swirling sandstorms.</p><p>Various strange phenomena abounded.</p><p>These interwoven phenomena obscured their vision, allowing them to see only the shadow of a towering mountain ahead. The people and buildings on the mountain remained indistinct.  Even the Ancestral Hall at the summit, the most prominent structure, was only vaguely discernible.</p><p>The mountain was steep, like a sword piercing the sky.</p><p>A man-made stone staircase started at the foot of the mountain and extended upwards, disappearing into the obscured heights.</p><p>Flickering lights, like scattered stars, could be seen through the rain. These were the escape lights of others who had entered the grotto before them and had already begun their treasure hunt.</p><p>“These phenomena are caused by the chaotic energy leaking from the protective formation.  The formation is currently at its weakest. As long as you protect yourselves with spiritual energy, there shouldn't be any major problems. However, it's best to ascend the mountain on foot. Flying too high risks being swept away by the chaotic spiritual energy, which would take considerable effort to escape…”</p><p>Yu Kong did not rush to climb the mountain. Instead, he reiterated the precautions within the grotto, warning everyone.  Then, he turned and pointed behind them.</p><p>“Remember where we entered. Before the formation strengthens again, it won't change drastically. Exiting from the entry point, you'll encounter the same wind formation. You're now familiar with its changes, and exiting is much easier than entering.  Don't worry about being trapped within the formation.”</p><p>Behind them was a chaotic scene of boundless clouds, resembling a gigantic eye of a storm.</p><p>Everyone dutifully memorized the entry point.</p><p>This was common knowledge for those entering the grotto, but Yu Kong painstakingly reminded them to avoid any oversight.</p><p>“There are still a few fellow Daoists who haven't responded,”  Yu Kong's gaze fell upon the Xiu sisters, Old Man Muteng, and the others. “Now that we're inside, what are your plans? Will you accompany me to the Treasure Pavilion behind the mountain, or will you act independently?”</p><p>Qin Sang had already agreed to Yu Kong's invitation and stepped forward, standing behind him. Yan Wu also joined him without hesitation, followed by Shangguan Lifeng.</p><p>The others exchanged glances, hesitant.</p><p>Old Man Muteng coughed lightly and asked seriously, “Daoist Yu, you previously said that within the Treasure Pavilion, whoever finds a treasure first keeps it, and no one else may contend for it.  But what if someone is tempted by greed and breaks this rule? What will you do?”</p><p>Yu Kong surveyed the group and calmly replied, “I will join with the other Daoists to eliminate them. I believe everyone here shares my disdain for such despicable behavior. And if I were to break the rule, you need not hesitate to act accordingly!”</p><p>Hearing this, Old Man Muteng's eyes flickered. He nodded and joined Yu Kong's side.</p><p>Wu Chen struggled for a moment before following suit.</p><p>Only the three women remained. Fairy Yueya giggled coquettishly and leaned in with a pitiful expression.  "This servant is all alone. I'm overjoyed to receive Senior Yu's protection and the assistance of fellow Daoists. How could I refuse?"</p><p>The Xiu sisters conferred briefly, then bowed to Yu Kong.  With a hint of apology, they said, "We sisters have another objective, unfortunately not in the rear mountains. We cannot accompany Senior Yu. Please forgive us."</p><p>Yu Kong was not offended. He gestured with his hand and said frankly, "I've already said that everyone is free to come and go.  You two are free to proceed. I wish you success in your endeavors."</p><p>"Thank you, Senior!"</p><p>The Xiu sisters bowed and departed, disappearing into the rain as everyone watched.</p><p>Yu Kong smiled.  "Although we've lost two fellow Daoists, diminishing the power of the Returning Origin Formation, everyone here is exceptionally capable.  I'm sure we'll all return with ample rewards. Let's ascend the mountain quickly. Follow me."</p><p>With that, Yu Kong's figure flashed and he rushed into the rain. The others quickly followed, activating their escape lights.</p><p>The stone steps were steep and badly damaged in many places, but these posed no obstacle to cultivators.  They followed closely behind Yu Kong, speeding towards the mountain peak.  They encountered others along the way, but everyone yielded to each other, avoiding conflict.</p><p>Soon, they arrived at the summit.  Just as everyone expected Yu Kong to bypass the main hall and head directly to the rear mountains, he walked straight towards the hall and entered.</p><p>This surprised everyone.  They couldn't understand why he would stop at this confirmed ruin.</p><p>The main hall had been thoroughly ransacked.  No one would waste time here, and the hall was empty.</p><p>Outside, the torrential rain continued, and the ancient hall lay in ruins.</p><p>The only remaining clay statue was askew, having been moved from its original position. Its colors had long since peeled away, revealing its age. It depicted a Daoist.</p><p>Yu Kong stood in the hall, gazing up at the tilted statue, his posture resembling one of reverence.</p><p>The others followed him inside.</p><p>Yu Kong looked at the statue and smiled. "Don't be surprised, fellow Daoists. I simply recalled the words of a friend. One should always be grateful for the kindness received. I deeply agree. I obtained a spiritual pill here last time, which helped me break through to the mid-stage.  Unfortunately, the grotto's owner is long gone, and I don't know their name.  I have no one to thank. Now that I've returned, I came in to pay my respects. It won't take long."</p><p>Saying this, Yu Kong walked to the statue, gently straightened it, and brushed away the dust. Then he stepped back a zhang and stood still.</p><p>His feet were together, his hands hanging naturally at his sides.</p><p>Chin tucked in, tongue touching the palate, chest slightly concave, and back straight.</p><p>After these preparations, Yu Kong performed the ritual of three bows and nine kowtows before the clay statue!</p><p>Everyone exchanged glances, but seeing Yu Kong's sincerity, no one dared to interrupt.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes flickered, a strange feeling lingering in his heart. He couldn't tell whether Yu Kong was genuine or merely putting on an act!</p>
