<h1>Chapter 838: Golden Light Formation</h1><p>“Will we abandon the island?”</p><p>Qin Sang remained silent.</p><p>This beast tide was unusually relentless.  Besieging Yu Heng Island for days, their numbers showed no sign of decreasing. The powerful demon behind it seemed determined to raze the island to the ground.</p><p>The beast tide they encountered on Wu Yuan Island was insignificant compared to this.</p><p>“Let me take over. You all should recover your strength.”</p><p>Qin Sang spoke up, taking control of the formation disc and directing the formation's power to slaughter the beasts.  He didn't know how much longer the formation could hold, so he had to prepare for the worst.</p><p>“It should be noon, the sun shining brightly, the scenery breathtakingly beautiful.”</p><p>Qin Sang looked up. The sky was completely obscured by flying beasts, nothing visible.</p><p>Time ticked by, each moment an agonizing wait.</p><p>Several more days passed.</p><p>Qin Sang had retreated within the city walls. The outer spirit formations had been breached one after another, forcing the protective barrier to shrink. Several cultivators, caught off guard when sections of the barrier shattered, were swallowed by the beast tide and quickly silenced, their fate grim.</p><p>However, the barrier remained relatively stable for now.  No transformed demons had appeared, and even if there were unexpected breaches, others could quickly reinforce the defenses.</p><p>“Why haven't the transformed demons shown themselves? What are they waiting for?”</p><p>Qin Sang wondered.</p><p>He wasn't the only one with this question.</p><p>Late that night, Qin Sang handed over the formation disc to someone else and immediately entered meditative cultivation. Days of continuous exertion had left him exhausted.</p><p>Not long after he started meditating, a transmission talisman suddenly flew into his lap.</p><p>Startled awake, Qin Sang opened the talisman.  His expression changed dramatically.</p><p>The surrounding cultivators all looked at him.</p><p>“The Island Lord has decided to abandon the island. We are to escape on our own!”</p><p>Qin Sang looked around and announced, passing the talisman along.</p><p>His words caused an uproar.</p><p>After days of fighting, everyone knew how terrifying the beast tide was. The island's protective formation was their only hope. If they abandoned the island and attempted a breakout, few would likely survive.</p><p>“Don't panic. Read the talisman. The Island Lord has a plan. At the last moment, he will unleash the full power of the spirit formation, creating escape routes in all four directions…”</p><p>Qin Sang reassured them.</p><p>The talisman explained that the Island Lord had been searching for the transformed demons orchestrating the beast tide, but to no avail.  They seemed to anticipate his actions and remained hidden.</p><p>As long as the transformed demons didn't attack, the formation could hold. But if the beast tide continued to drain their resources, they would eventually run out of spirit stones and be too exhausted to escape.</p><p>The Island Lord had planned to use a killing formation to cripple the transformed demons and break the beast tide, but now they had to settle for a less ideal solution.</p><p>At the final moment, the Island Lord would personally control the formation, aiming to eliminate any exposed demons and concentrate the formation's power to create escape routes in four directions. The cultivators could then take advantage of the chaos and break through, greatly increasing their chances of survival.</p><p>The Island Lord, acting decisively, set the breakout time for midnight, just one hour away!</p><p>Reading the talisman, everyone learned of the formation's hidden power and calmed down somewhat, though their faces remained grim.</p><p>Escaping individually meant relying on fate, even the Island Lord himself might be killed by the transformed demons.</p><p>Shortly after receiving the talisman, a message arrived from Jin Ying, inviting Qin Sang to join their group for the breakout.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered for a moment and decided to act alone!</p><p>He believed he was strong enough, especially with his superior speed. Unless he encountered a transformed demon or was surrounded by Core Formation demons, he was unlikely to be trapped.</p><p>Another reason was the information in the talisman. The Island Lord would focus on the exposed demons and create escape routes, reducing the pressure during the breakout.  Acting alone would offer him greater flexibility, while joining the merchant alliance might be a hindrance.</p><p>Moreover, Qin Sang had another concern.</p><p>As an outsider, who would be abandoned first in a crisis?</p><p>Qin Sang replied, declining the invitation.  After a moment of hesitation, he added to the talisman that if the two women wished to join him, they could escape together.</p><p>Escaping the beast tide didn't guarantee safety. They still had to cross the vast demon-infested sea to find a safe island.  Having companions would be an advantage.</p><p>Unfortunately, a short while later, Qin Sang received their reply. The two women expressed regret at his refusal and decided to stick with the merchant alliance's experts. They wished him luck.</p><p>The merchant alliance had many powerful cultivators, so their choice was understandable. Qin Sang said nothing more, wishing them well.</p><p>Unbeknownst to Qin Sang, Madam Liu and Jin Ying were astonished by his decision. After seeing his invitation, they argued for a long time before reaching their own conclusion.</p><p>With less than an hour remaining, the city was filled with a heavy sense of dread.  Everyone's fate hung in the balance, uncertain if they would see the next sunrise.</p><p>Qin Sang made his preparations for the breakout, waiting for midnight.</p><p>…</p><p>Midnight.</p><p>Without warning, the formation disc in Qin Sang's possession emitted a dazzling light.</p><p>The next moment, a powerful suction force pulled at him, draining his true essence at an alarming rate. His expression shifted slightly, but he didn't resist, urging others to remain calm.</p><p>At the same time, at the center of the spirit formation, the spirit stones powering the formation were drained dry, turning into dust, including many high-grade spirit stones.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>The formation disc shattered before Qin Sang, and the suction force vanished.</p><p>Qin Sang breathed a sigh of relief, checking his inner sea and quickly consuming a few essence-restoring pills.</p><p>A golden light leaped from the shattered disc, quivering slightly before shooting skyward.  Simultaneously, golden lights appeared throughout the city.</p><p>A breathtaking scene unfolded.</p><p>Countless golden streams of light rose into the air and converged, bathing the city in a golden glow.</p><p>Qin Sang gazed up at the golden light, then noticed something else. He shifted his gaze to the protective barrier. After the sword shadows appeared, the barrier's power began to fade, becoming thin and dim.</p><p>“Go!”</p><p>Qin Sang shouted, his figure shooting towards the edge of the formation like an arrow loosed from a bow.</p><p>The others finally reacted.</p><p>Instantly, countless streaks of light filled the sky in all directions.</p><p>The beasts were momentarily stunned by the transformation of the spirit formation, then sensed the weakening barrier and roared in excitement, their greedy eyes fixed on the escaping cultivators.</p><p>The next moment, screams filled the air.</p><p>The golden light unleashed by the spirit formation displayed terrifying power. The exposed demons were simultaneously struck, killed or injured, causing chaos among the beast tide.</p><p>This was far from over. The other golden lights converged into four streams within the city, resembling golden rivers.  The moment the protective barrier shattered, they plunged into the beast tide in four directions.</p><p>The Golden Light Formation unleashed its final brilliance, transforming into a grinding wheel of death. Bloody paths were instantly carved through the beast tide, and the cultivators swarmed out of the city.</p>
