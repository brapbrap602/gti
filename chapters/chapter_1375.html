<h1></h1><p>The Ice Crystal Palace was deathly silent.</p><p>Even a pin drop could be heard.</p><p>The expressions of the others weren't any better than Yue Wu's.</p><p>Even those with wills as strong as a nascent soul were all stunned, looking at Qin Sang as if he were a monster.</p><p>The juniors standing below couldn't discern the changes in Qin Sang's cultivation, and seeing these strange looks on the faces of the Nascent Soul patriarchs, they were all frightened into silence, with varied expressions.</p><p>"What? Are you all not welcoming to Qin?"</p><p>Qin Sang walked into the Ice Crystal Palace, letting out a soft laugh.</p><p>"How dare we! How dare we! Abbot Qin, please..."</p><p>The Yue Wu brothers woke up as if from a dream, apologizing repeatedly and hurrying to greet him.</p><p>Before, they had treated Qin Sang as an honored guest, grateful for his help in driving away the Abyss of Sins for the Heavenly Journey Alliance.</p><p>Now, their eyes held even more respect.</p><p>Respect for the strong!</p><p>Immortal Fairy Qiu Zhi gracefully stood up, her beautiful eyes locked onto Qin Sang, as if trying to see through him, "Hehe... I didn't expect Fellow Daoist Qin to break through to the mid-Nascent Soul stage in such a short time. Now, this concubine is no match for you either."</p><p>As soon as these words came out, the entire room was shocked.</p><p>"What!"</p><p>"Senior Qin has broken through to the mid-Nascent Soul stage?"</p><p>"How is that possible!"</p><p>...</p><p>The juniors' eyes were as wide as copper bells, in disbelief.</p><p>Serpent King glanced at Jing Yu beside him, "It's a good thing Fellow Daoist Qin has broken through, was it really necessary to hide it so tightly?"</p><p>Jing Yu smiled wryly, looking at Qin Sang with a hint of reproach, "I just came out of seclusion and came to attend the meeting at Fellow Daoist's invitation. I haven't had time to ask the juniors, who knew Fellow Daoist Qin..."</p><p>Jing Yu knew that Qin Sang had three Corpse Flower Blood Ambers.</p><p>But she never imagined that Qin Sang could break through to the mid-Nascent Soul stage so quickly.</p><p>This speed of cultivation was truly astonishing.</p><p>If Old Devil Ye was still here, he would have to admit defeat and lament that the Northern Chen Realm had produced another extraordinary genius.</p><p>Did bottlenecks not exist?</p><p>"Another world-shocking talent has emerged in the human race!"</p><p>Serpent King sighed, his expression somewhat worried.</p><p>"Fortunately, it is Fellow Daoist Qin," Jing Yu said, suppressing the surprise in her eyes.</p><p>Serpent King nodded heavily, "Indeed, fortunately, it is Fellow Daoist Qin!"</p><p>Qin Sang was invited to the seat of honor.</p><p>The atmosphere in the Ice Crystal Palace was still very abnormal, everyone's eyes were focused on Qin Sang, and it seemed difficult for the meeting to continue.</p><p>"I was lucky, and by chance, I obtained some opportunities. I didn't expect to break through the bottleneck in one go..."</p><p>Qin Sang said casually.</p><p>The looks in everyone's eyes were clearly disbelieving.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't explain much, and the others didn't dare to press him.</p><p>After a round of sickeningly flattering compliments, the meeting continued, but everyone was too shocked and appeared absent-minded, ending it hastily.</p><p>However, Qin Sang had already found out what he wanted to know.</p><p>In addition, Qin Sang no longer concealed it and openly offered a reward in the Northern Chen Alliance, searching for Ghost Mother and Tan Hao.</p><p>Based on the information he had collected during this period, Qin Sang guessed that Tan Hao and Ghost Mother were likely no longer in the Northern Chen Realm, and the reward was just to confirm this.</p><p>If he wanted to find Tan Hao, he would probably have to leave the Northern Chen Realm and go to the other three realms.</p><p>It just so happened that Qin Sang had just broken through, and it would be difficult for his cultivation to improve in a short time, and he also wanted to travel around.</p><p>With his current cultivation, he should be able to barely pass through the Storm Belt. He had the Horn of the Moon Gazing Rhinoceros, so he didn't have to worry about getting lost in the storm. He was more confident than others.</p><p>Before leaving, he had to go into seclusion for a period of time to stabilize his cultivation, and there were still several things to do.</p><p>The meeting ended.</p><p>Qin Sang and Jing Yu left together, not returning to the Green Ram Temple, but flying towards the Abyss of Sins.</p><p>They didn't need to flatter each other, Jing Yu only asked Qin Sang about his experience in seclusion during this period.</p><p>Qin Sang then spoke of his plans.</p><p>"I'm afraid it's not convenient for me to travel with Fellow Daoist Qin. Chi Lei's cultivation is progressing well, but I still need to watch over him personally. Only after careful polishing for a long time can I feel at ease letting him consume the Corpse Flower Blood Amber..."</p><p>Jing Yu said apologetically.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't intend to disturb Jing Yu in the first place.</p><p>With Jing Yu staying in the Northern Chen Realm to manage the family business, no evildoers would dare to act rashly, and he would be able to travel outside without any worries.</p><p>Although the Green Ram Temple was created by Qin Sang in accordance with Yun Youzi's last wish, it was after all created by him, and he didn't want the Green Ram Temple to decline so quickly.</p><p>"After I leave, the Green Ram Temple will be entrusted to you," Qin Sang said.</p><p>"Don't worry, Fellow Daoist."</p><p>Jing Yu nodded, and suddenly laughed, "Did you see the expressions on those old guys' faces just now? Your breakthrough was too scary. Even if you don't show your face, it is estimated that no one will dare to touch the Green Ram Temple for a thousand years..."</p><p>"What are you two Fellow Daoists talking about, so happy?"</p><p>Qiu Zhi, who was flying in front, heard the laughter, slowed down, and asked, turning her head.</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head, caught up with Immortal Fairy Qiu Zhi, and inquired about the situation of the Abyssal Ruins.</p><p>Real Person Cang Hong was still at the bottom of the Scar of Heaven, tirelessly searching.</p><p>"Not optimistic..."</p><p>Immortal Fairy Qiu Zhi didn't hide anything, "Real Person has found a few places, but they were all false hopes. There is only one place that is suspected to be a fragment of the Abyssal Ruins. That place is extremely chaotic and dangerous. We have tried many times, but we are helpless. With Fellow Daoist Qin's help this time, we will surely gain something!"</p><p>"After so many years, only one place has been found?"</p><p>Seeing Immortal Fairy Qiu Zhi nod, Qin Sang's heart sank slightly.</p><p>The Abyssal Ruins were really completely destroyed.</p><p>Arriving at the Abyss of Sins, Immortal Fairy Qiu Zhi invited them to visit her sect.</p><p>A few hours later, the three entered the Scar of Heaven, meeting with Real Person Cang Hong.</p><p>The bottom of the Scar of Heaven was far more dangerous than before.</p><p>Fragments of ancient restrictions were everywhere.</p><p>The space here was also torn apart.</p><p>Now, cultivators in the Golden Core stage didn't dare to enter too deep into the Scar of Heaven.</p><p>Even Qin Sang and the others, as strong as they were, had to be careful, avoiding the dancing rays of light everywhere.</p><p>The rays of light were turbulent currents, some connected into one piece, and some were only thin strands. If they were hit by these turbulent currents, and accidentally brought into the ancient restriction, or hit a space crack, the end would definitely be ominous.</p><p>Exploring in this kind of place for decades, Real Person Cang Hong's expression faintly revealed fatigue.</p><p>Not to mention how shocked they were when they saw Qin Sang's realm.</p><p>The group arrived at their target location.</p><p>Seeing the scene in front of him, Qin Sang finally understood why there had been no progress for so long.</p><p>Ahead, rays of light were connected into pieces, ancient restrictions, space cracks, and turbulent currents were in a chaotic mess, and the place suspected to be a fragment of the Abyssal Ruins was in the center of the rays of light.</p><p>Qin Sang hesitated a bit. Taking such a big risk, the inside might not be the blood lake he was looking for, which was really not worth it.</p><p>Real Person Cang Hong repeatedly pleaded earnestly, making promises.</p><p>They knew that Qin Sang possessed a remarkable spiritual eye divine ability, which could be of great use here. They had gone to the Green Ram Temple many times before, but all their efforts were in vain.</p><p>Now that they had finally seen the main person, how could they let him go!</p><p>Qin Sang considered for a long time and agreed to help.</p><p>The Nascent Souls were overjoyed.</p><p>They had studied for a long time and had already found a breakthrough.</p><p>Nascent Soul talisman puppets and Jing Yu protected them on the left and right, Qin Sang activated his Heavenly Eye Divine Ability, guiding everyone to find a path in the impossible.</p><p>It took several months to finally make a new discovery, but in the end, they encountered another obstacle.</p><p>Here, they could already see that there was indeed a fragment of the Abyssal Ruins inside, but unfortunately, it was not the blood lake.</p><p>This place was too dangerous.</p><p>Qin Sang decided to retreat, leaving Real Person Cang Hong and the others to continue their research.</p>
