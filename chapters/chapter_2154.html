<h1>Chapter 2144: Enhancing Strength</h1><p>Qin Sang took out the Kuntian Golden Lock.  In an instant, the room was filled with golden light.</p><p>Before being activated, the Kuntian Golden Lock was only palm-sized. Qin Sang held it in his palm, carefully examining it.</p><p>The golden lock was tightly fastened, its surface engraved with faint cloud patterns.</p><p>Qin Sang tried to probe his spiritual sense into the lock's interior. He clearly sensed the lock's spirituality; its spirit embryo had developed to a considerable degree, not far from transformation. For a spiritual treasure, once it passes this stage, a spirit will be born within the embryo, allowing it to defy fate.  However, this stage is as difficult as ascending to heaven; countless powerful spiritual treasures are forever stuck at this point.</p><p>When Qin Sang touched the spirit embryo, he immediately felt a strong rejection. Normally, if a cultivator and a spiritual treasure are highly compatible, one would feel it upon contact, easily gaining the treasure's recognition.</p><p>The spiritual treasure's embryo has not yet developed intelligence; it is driven entirely by instinct.  If not recognized upon first encounter, it is almost impossible for the treasure to willingly accept a master later.  One can only forcibly subdue it using the *Tongbao Jue*.</p><p>For many years, numerous artifact refiners have devoted significant time and effort to researching methods of subduing spiritual treasures, and similar secret techniques have emerged endlessly, but their effectiveness varies greatly.</p><p>For example, most secret techniques rely on harsh conditions that ordinary cultivators find difficult to meet.</p><p>Some techniques allow cultivators to wield spiritual treasures but damage their spirituality, significantly reducing their power.  Others take the opposite approach, causing no significant harm to the treasure, but the cultivator pays a considerable price. Unless a treasure's power is exceptionally strong, it's a losing proposition.</p><p>Among these methods, only a few achieve perfection, mostly held by major lineages and powerful forces in artifact refinement.</p><p>Secret techniques vary in quality.</p><p>Relying on the Intertwined Blood Mulberry and utilizing its Blood-Taint Divine Light is undoubtedly one of the superior techniques; it can even be used to subdue the spirits of both acquired and innate spiritual treasures.</p><p>This is why the Intertwined Blood Mulberry is among the Ten Great Divine Trees.</p><p>Qin Sang possesses the Intertwined Blood Mulberry but lacks the corresponding technique. If he directly uses the Blood-Taint Divine Light to defile the Kuntian Golden Lock, it might anger the treasure and backfire.</p><p>The technique he obtained from the Five Elements Alliance is called the Taiheng Jue.</p><p>This is one of the best techniques that guest elders of the Five Elements Alliance can exchange for. It's certainly not the Alliance's most top-tier secret technique, and it inevitably has drawbacks, but these flaws are acceptable.  With Qin Sang's mastery of artifact refinement, thorough study may allow him to compensate for its shortcomings and minimize its impact on the Kuntian Golden Lock.</p><p>Qin Sang already has some ideas on this, which need to be tested.</p><p>The *Chongxuan Scroll*’s Blood Refinement technique can deepen the connection between a cultivator and a spiritual treasure. Qin Sang plans to use his own essence blood to nourish the treasure.</p><p>Before using the Taiheng Jue, eight golden figures need to be refined. Qin Sang has been planning this for a long time, and the materials for refining the figures are already prepared.</p><p>He went to the fire chamber, setting the Kuntian Golden Lock aside. The Qianjun Ring glowed, and clusters of flowing light shot out, floating in mid-air, almost filling the chamber.</p><p>Countless materials, seemingly incredibly complex, were methodically added to the spirit fire by Qin Sang. The timing and heat control were impeccable, effortless.</p><p>Gradually, a faint dark gold glow appeared in the flames.</p><p>After some time, the entire fire chamber was almost filled with a dark gold sheen. Qin Sang's eyes narrowed slightly. He struck the spirit fire with the back of his hand, and the flames vibrated, splitting from the center. A dark gold light shot out and landed beside him.</p><p>'Dong!'</p><p>The ground trembled slightly, as if something very heavy had landed.</p><p>This was a golden figure, half a person's height, with distinct features and limbs, sitting cross-legged, hands resting on its knees, palms facing upwards, eyes open, gazing straight ahead.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at the figure, nodded in satisfaction, and continued refining, his movements non-stop, creating one golden figure after another. Even with his cultivation, he failed twice before successfully refining eight figures.</p><p>Putting away the excess materials, Qin Sang swept his sleeve, and the eight golden figures scattered, each occupying a position in the Bagua formation.</p><p>Qin Sang closed his eyes, silently recalling the Taiheng Jue. He had studied this technique beforehand, but some points remained unclear, requiring the eight golden figures to assist his understanding.</p><p>Soon, a subtle change occurred in Qin Sang's aura. Under the guidance of his spiritual energy, the golden light from the eight figures was drawn to him, dyeing his skin dark gold.</p><p>Following this, the eight figures seemed to come alive, their eyes gleaming strangely, slowly turning to look at Qin Sang. Then, they raised their right arms, pointing their index fingers at him.</p><p>Eight golden figures remained in that pose, exhibiting no other phenomena, yet a subtle energy quietly flowed between Qin Sang and them.</p><p>Qin Sang's brow furrowed and relaxed, finally nodding slowly.  He murmured, "So it is," letting out a long sigh, and stopped his spellcasting.</p><p>The eight golden figures lowered their arms, returning to normal.</p><p>Qin Sang calmly regulated his breath for a moment, then summoned the Heaven-Binding Golden Lock, suspending it above his head. Simultaneously, he activated a secret technique, consecutively striking eight hand seals that entered the bodies of the eight golden figures.</p><p>"Hum!"</p><p>The golden figures rose into the air, encircling the Heaven-Binding Golden Lock at their center. As before, they raised their arms, pointing towards the lock.</p><p>Qin Sang remained motionless, fully activating his secret technique. At intervals, a slight ripple appeared in the void, causing the golden light on the figures to rise and fall. Then, a golden ray emerged from their fingertips, shooting towards the Heaven-Binding Golden Lock.</p><p>Soon, the Heaven-Binding Golden Lock was enveloped in a mass of dark gold light, as if encased within a golden primordial egg.</p><p>Qin Sang's movements became increasingly urgent, his hand seals flying; some aimed at the golden figures, most into the golden primordial egg.</p><p>Mysterious patterns appeared on the surface of the Heaven-Binding Golden Lock within the golden primordial egg, growing denser, seemingly permeating the lock's interior. Qin Sang's perception became clearer; the formless power of the Tai Heng Art was approaching the lock's spirit.</p><p>As if instinctively sensing danger, the Heaven-Binding Golden Lock became restless, causing Qin Sang to immediately interrupt his secret technique.</p><p>Looking at the Heaven-Binding Golden Lock, it trembled within the golden primordial egg.  The eight golden figures continued their function, but in a way that prevented the spiritual treasure from feeling threatened, gently allowing it to adapt and accept.</p><p>Qin Sang raised his hands to his chest, clasped together in a bowl shape, continuing to circulate the Tai Heng Art. Golden liquid droplets condensed in his palms, gradually filling his hands. Qin Sang seemed to be greatly depleted, his expression becoming somewhat listless.</p><p>The golden liquid divided into eight streams, entering the bodies of the eight golden figures.</p><p>Soon, the golden primordial egg became as thick as water, and the Heaven-Binding Golden Lock calmed down. The hall was silent, yet changes continued silently.</p><p>Qin Sang sensed the energy of the eight golden figures, nodded silently. Subduing the Heaven-Binding Golden Lock was a slow process. With the aid of the eight golden figures, he wouldn't have to stay here indefinitely.</p><p>However, this golden liquid would eventually be exhausted, requiring replenishment at intervals. The drain on himself grew stronger each time. Furthermore, the eight golden figures could only be used once before losing their power and becoming useless—the cost was considerable.</p><p>But as long as he could refine the Heaven-Binding Golden Lock, these costs would be worth it.</p><p>After a long period of meditation, Qin Sang's breath finally recovered. He stood up and stepped back, but didn't leave the fire chamber; he settled in a corner to cultivate, to avoid any unforeseen events.</p><p>A clear sword's hum; the Huiying Sword leaped into the air, circling above Qin Sang's head.</p><p>Moments later, darkness enveloped them, swallowing Qin Sang and the spiritual sword. In the fire chamber, darkness and golden light each occupied half the space, coexisting peacefully.</p><p>Inside the sword array, the scene was different.</p><p>The night sky was brilliantly starlit; stars formed a vast, boundless river of stars. At a glance, it could be divided into four regions.</p><p>The West and South were the brightest, stars distinct and clearly visible. The North and East were two chaotic masses of starlight, appearing like nebulae, where individual stars were almost indistinguishable.</p><p>Qin Sang appeared in the night sky, positioned in the center, taking in the four stellar domains. His gaze swept across the West and South.</p><p>The Western White Tiger Seven Mansions and Southern Vermilion Bird Seven Mansions were fully evolved. In the South, a true Vermilion Bird presided. With the Vermilion Bird's breakthrough to the Refinement Void stage, the Southern Vermilion Bird Sword Array's power had increased significantly.  Unfortunately, he only had one Vermilion Bird. If he could gather the four sacred beasts, all at a comparable cultivation level to the Vermilion Bird, not only would refining the sword array be much easier, but the power of the Four Symbols Sword Array would reach terrifying levels.</p><p>With this thought, Qin Sang's gaze turned to the East and North. After a moment's contemplation, he decided to refine the Eastern Azure Dragon Sword Array first. For him, the two arrays were at the same starting point; the order didn't matter much.</p><p>With a flash of his figure, Qin Sang appeared in the center of that nebula, surrounded by chaotic light and filaments, like stardust filling the void.</p><p>Standing in the void, Qin Sang gazed at the nebula, his mind filled with complex thoughts.</p><p>The Four Symbols Sword Array shared certain commonalities. He first recalled his experience in comprehending the Western White Tiger Sword Array and refining the Southern Vermilion Bird Sword Array.</p><p>Then he recalled the insights he gained in the Ziwei Palace's Sword Path.  The insights were vague, but extremely valuable. As long as he devoted himself to comprehending them, sorting out the threads, he could use them as a framework to continue refining, avoiding going astray.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang's mind flashed with images from his time in the Divine Court.  The Divine Court's deity resided there; each temple was a star, arranged according to celestial laws.  Remembering the Eastern Azure Dragon star region and referencing Taoist scriptures he'd studied, he could begin to deduce the sword formation.</p><p>In fact, Qin Sang's intention to create his own celestial sword formation originated in the Divine Court, and he used it as a reference.  Once perfected, his sword formation would be considered a successor to the Divine Court's martial arts lineage.</p><p>Most precious of all was his many years of studying Tian Yue's sword light, and the insights gained from the sword domain.</p><p>These disparate elements were overwhelming.  Qin Sang furrowed his brow, his eyes vacant as he immersed himself, his hand unconsciously manipulating the void before him.</p><p>He stirred the nebulae, like a storm, causing the surrounding nebulae to vibrate, collide, and merge.  The originally evenly distributed nebulae began to disperse and coalesce.  Where they gathered, stardust accumulated, starlight intensified, forming bands or wisps of stardust that continued to condense, drawn towards a center by some unseen force.</p><p>First, a massive disc of stardust formed, then a loose sphere with swirling debris.  The sphere continued to compress until a star was born!</p><p>Underlying this was the shifting sword intent.</p><p>This star hovered before Qin Sang, emitting a chilling sword intent—a sword star!</p><p>“This shall be the first star of the Horn,”</p><p>Qin Sang murmured, gazing at the star.</p><p>His words were law!</p><p>The star trembled violently, shooting towards the depths of the nebula.  The nebulae parted before it, finally settling in the night sky, hanging high above, its starlight illuminating the entire star region.  The Horn was the first asterism of the East, and this was its first star!  Its establishment was of great significance.</p><p>A smile touched Qin Sang's lips.  Suddenly sensing something, he quickly left the sword formation, discovering that the eight golden figures were dimming, their golden cores becoming translucent, soon to be unsustainable.</p><p>“So much time has passed…”</p><p>Engrossed in deducing the sword formation, Qin Sang felt it had only been a moment.</p><p>He systematically stabilized the golden cores of the eight figures, condensed the golden liquid, and after they recovered, returned to the sword formation.</p><p>Looking at the first star of the Horn, Qin Sang reflected on the process, realizing it had been easier than expected. The reason was clear: his cultivation was higher than before, and he had the experience of deducing the Southern Vermillion Bird sword formation.</p><p>There was also a crucial factor: with increased cultivation, he understood the essence of the *Ziwei Sword Scripture* better, making it easier to comprehend Tian Yue's remaining sword light and his understanding of the sword domain deepened.</p><p>Conversely, deducing the sword formation had a reciprocal effect, deepening his understanding of the sword path and aiding his comprehension of the sword light and domain.</p><p>Except for occasional breaks to aid the eight golden figures, Qin Sang immersed himself in the profound sword path, oblivious to the outside world.</p><p>While Qin Sang was secluded, Li Yu Fu, following his instructions, was mobilizing the power of the Storm Realm, selecting locations, and constructing altars.</p><p>With materials ready, they proceeded methodically. With Su Nu and Zhu Que's assistance, progress was rapid.  Throughout the three regions of the Storm Realm, altars sprang up, mostly in places rich in spiritual energy, densely populated areas, or key passes.  Accompanying each were spirit arrays, halls, pavilions, and meditation chambers—magnificent structures serving as the residences of the Five Thunder Court officials.</p><p>Emerging from the sword formation again, Qin Sang probed the Trapped Heaven Golden Lock with his spiritual sense, finding the repellent force significantly weaker. He nodded silently. Once the treasure no longer repelled him, he could begin refining it. During this time, not only had the Trapped Heaven Golden Lock gradually submitted, but the Eastern Azure Dragon sword formation had also taken shape.</p><p>Qin Sang used his secret technique to condense golden liquid, strengthening the eight golden figures.  He was eager to continue deducing the sword formation when the outer barrier was triggered.</p><p>It was Li Yu Fu.</p><p>A moment later, Li Yu Fu's respectful voice came from outside.</p><p>“Reporting to Master Uncle, all the transmission altars are complete, only the governing altar remains. When will Master Uncle emerge from seclusion?”</p><p>“Oh? The altars are finished?”</p><p>Lost in seclusion, Qin Sang had forgotten the passage of time.</p><p>Darkness receded like a tide. Qin Sang recalled his Grey Sparrow Sword, leaving the eight golden figures and the Trapped Heaven Golden Lock in the fire chamber, and opened the door.</p><p>With the governing altar built and the transmission ceremony performed, his Daoist domain would be truly complete!</p>
