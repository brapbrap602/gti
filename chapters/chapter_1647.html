<h1>Chapter 1638: Heaven-Shattering Soul-Stirring</h1><p>Chapter 1638: Heaven-Shattering Soul-Stirring</p><p>The avatar’s attack was cunning.</p><p>Ice Soul Divine Light blocked the strange-faced man's retreat.</p><p>Simultaneously, the strange-faced man had to contend with the Seven Souls Killing Formation.</p><p>The strange-faced man's carefully laid ambush against Qin Sang failed, instead trapping him in a desperate situation.</p><p>Divine light surged.</p><p>The blinding white frost sealed the space wherever it passed.</p><p>The strange-faced man felt the chill penetrate his protective true energy, as if freezing his blood.  He was startled, instinctively maneuvering his wooden armor to meet the attack.</p><p>This treasure had protected its master several times, proving its worth.</p><p>The wooden armor appeared above the strange-faced man, its light flickering, the shadow of an ancient tree spanning the heavens.</p><p>Unexpectedly, just as the ancient tree was about to fully form, the speed of the divine light suddenly increased dramatically, instantly slashing down, giving the impression of piercing straight through the ancient tree's shadow.</p><p>The Ice Soul Divine Light excelled in its concealment and speed.  After the avatar refined the ice disc's frost, its attack was no longer subtle, but its speed increased instead of decreasing.</p><p>During the exchange with the strange-faced man, the avatar observed the wooden armor's pattern, deliberately slowing the divine light's speed to mislead the strange-faced man and lure out the armor.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>In an instant, the wooden armor was engulfed by the Ice Soul Divine Light.</p><p>The unfinished ancient tree shook violently, then shattered.</p><p>Within the blinding white light, only the wooden armor's core glowed with intense green light,  glacial ice rapidly solidifying at the edge of the green light.</p><p>The wooden armor spun uncontrollably, continuously emitting green light, but this defensive treasure couldn't break through the ice, quickly being sealed within a thick ice platform.</p><p>One move disabled one of the strange-faced man’s defensive treasures.</p><p>The Snow-Treading Divine Blade followed closely.</p><p>The blade energy was like a rainbow!</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang's main body had also recovered, the Sun God Tree hidden in his sleeve, the Sun God Bird poised, merely waiting for the opportune moment.</p><p>Once the sword and blade combined, the strange-faced man would face certain death!</p><p>To an ordinary person, the strange-faced man had no room to maneuver, having to choose a direction to forcibly break through, or surrender.</p><p>“Child's play!”</p><p>The strange-faced man coldly snorted, striking his dantian with his palm.</p><p>A crimson light burst from his dantian; within the light was the shadow of a spiritual tree.</p><p>The tree hovered before the strange-faced man, no more than seven feet tall, looking young compared to the other ten-thousand-year-old trees in the forest.</p><p>Its leaves were crimson red, dazzlingly bright, like magma flowing through the veins; its grey trunk was full of cracks, like parched earth, ancient and rustic.</p><p>Its extensive root system was also crimson, tightly bound together.</p><p>The crimson light emitted by the tree was connected to the strange-faced man's dantian, their energy completely integrated; the roots were also swaying towards him, as if taking root in his body.</p><p>“Crimson Profound Ancient Tree?”</p><p>Qin Sang's pupils constricted.  He then realized the tree wasn't a magical transformation but a physical entity, causing him even greater surprise.</p><p>The Ebony Sword needed to devour spiritual wood to upgrade, so Qin Sang always paid attention to collecting records about spiritual wood wherever he went.  He had heard of the Crimson Profound Ancient Tree, but he didn't fully understand its power.</p><p>The strange-faced man had refined a complete spiritual tree and rooted it within his body.</p><p>Qin Sang had never seen such a technique before.</p><p>At this moment, the strange-faced man quickly completed a hand seal, pressing it onto the Crimson Profound Ancient Tree. The ancient tree shook, then plummeted.</p><p>As it fell, the Crimson Profound Ancient Tree transformed from real to illusion, completely disappearing the moment it touched the ground, as if sinking underground.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression turned grave.</p><p>At this moment, the forest had changed; it felt completely different from before.  Earlier, the strange-faced man had merely manipulated those points of light using the wood bead; now, Qin Sang felt as if the entire forest was connected by a strange force, becoming a single entity.</p><p>At the same time, a crimson light blazed behind the strange-faced man, the ancient tree's shadow appearing behind him, then flashing and merging into his body.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>Crimson light soared into the sky!</p><p>The strange-faced man leaped from mid-air, landing with earth-shattering force.  With a ‘dong’, a sound like a drum resonated.</p><p>The shockwave spread out, causing waves in the foliage of the forest; several outlying pavilions were even collapsed by the shock.</p><p>Even more shocking was that the strange-faced man who landed on the ground was gone, replaced by a giant figure. His skin was rough like bark, his arms and fingers long and slender, like branches, resembling a tree spirit.</p><p>The giant's features vaguely retained the outline of the strange-faced man's face.</p><p>The giant stood firmly on the ground, giving Qin Sang the feeling that he was a tree rooted here, an immortal monument in this forest!</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>The Snow-Treading Divine Blade cleaved through the air.</p><p>A blizzard poured down.</p><p>The strange-faced man's hair instantly turned white.</p><p>He tilted his head back, his rough skin accentuating the ferocity of his expression.  He let out a cruel laugh, his right shoulder twitched, and he unleashed a powerful punch.</p><p>The force of the blow stopped the blizzard in its tracks.</p><p>Snow shattered, the scene resembling a tear in the fabric of space, leaving a striking path through the blizzard.  A fist image suddenly appeared beneath the blade of the Snow-Treading Divine Blade, unafraid of the sharp blade, striking out!</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>Fist met blade.</p><p>The Snow-Treading Divine Blade violently trembled.  The Avatar felt a massive force transmitted through the blade, his body shuddered, and he almost flew backward.</p><p>The Avatar's expression turned serious, he focused all his energy on his cultivation technique, regaining his footing. The Snow-Treading Divine Blade couldn't hold, a ringing sound echoed as the blade was jolted upwards by the immense force. Though not flung away, the relentless attack faltered.</p><p>Fortunately, the sword array had closed in, trapping the grotesque-faced man.</p><p>Both the Jinchen Sword and the Snow-Treading Divine Blade were magical artifacts, but their wielders were a true body and an avatar respectively, and Qin Sang's swordsmanship and blade techniques were vastly different. The resulting power naturally couldn’t be compared.</p><p>From above, looking down.</p><p>A dark space had been sealed off within the forest by the sword array. The grotesque-faced man fell into the array, his body blurred, surrounded by countless sword threads, radiating killing intent!</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>The sword threads attacked.</p><p>The grotesque-faced man howled repeatedly, his fists whirling like wheels, producing a continuous roar, purely countering with his bare fists.  Countless sword threads snapped.</p><p>Although the grotesque-faced man was inevitably cut by the sword threads, a layer of red light flowed beneath his skin, coupled with his tree-bark-like skin, suggesting that he was not in immediate danger.</p><p>"Such powerful force!"</p><p>Qin Sang stared at the grotesque-faced man's fists, finding no trace of other artifacts.</p><p>It was evident that his strength was obtained through supernatural abilities.</p><p>Previous encounters indicated he was not a physical cultivator, but through the Crimson Profound Ancient Tree and a unique supernatural ability, he had obtained a wood spirit body, integrated into this ancient forest, undergoing a dramatic transformation.</p><p>Qin Sang secretly felt relieved that he hadn’t relied on the treasures from Wan Du Mountain.  Suppressing his internal raging poison should not be difficult with the strength of this wood spirit body.</p><p>However, although his strength increased greatly after his transformation, this wood spirit body proved cumbersome…</p><p>Qin Sang’s expression shifted, he appeared above the sword array, his sleeves billowed, and crimson flames shot out, revealing another spirit tree.</p><p>This time, it was a tree of flames!</p><p>As the Sun God Tree appeared, three Sun God Birds flew side-by-side, merging into a ball of fire in mid-air, instantly rushing towards the grotesque-faced man.</p><p>Sensing the violent energy of the South Ming Li Fire, the grotesque-faced man's howl ceased abruptly. His face changed drastically, he violently leaned back and retreated rapidly.</p><p>But he was in the sword array, unable to dodge freely.</p><p>As the grotesque-faced man found himself trapped and the Sun God Birds were about to strike.</p><p>Suddenly, the grotesque-faced man froze, the glow on his skin faded rapidly, eerily turning into a withered old tree.  At the same time, subtle energy fluctuations emanated from the dark recesses of the forest.</p><p>Qin Sang's face darkened, it was too late to alter the Sun God Birds' course.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The spirit flames hit the ground.</p><p>Raging flames.</p><p>The withered tree instantly turned to ashes, along with a large section of the surrounding forest, reduced to scorched earth.</p><p>"So that's your trump card?"</p><p>The grotesque-faced man's voice echoed from the forest beyond the scorched earth.</p><p>A ten-thousand-year-old tree swayed slightly, its leaves falling, visibly withering at an alarming rate.  Cracking sounds emanated from within the tree, a tree-man jumped out, looking at Qin Sang, sneering in return, repeating Qin Sang’s taunt verbatim.</p><p>His cumbersome movements with the wood spirit body were deliberate, aiming to lure out Qin Sang’s trump card. It worked.</p><p>However, the grotesque-faced man wasn't as calm as he appeared.  Seeing the Sun God Tree, a hint of astonishment flashed in his eyes. He finally understood why Su Zi Nan called it the Fire Demon!</p><p>Demon fire and the fire tree; with only these two spirit flames, this person could dominate the cultivation world.</p><p>He deeply regretted his arrogance.  He should have retreated when the Crying Spirit Cave Master was struck; he was now in a difficult situation.</p><p>The mockery reached his ears.</p><p>Qin Sang's face remained impassive.  Through his divine sense and Heavenly Eye supernatural ability, he keenly perceived that the grotesque-faced man’s movements weren't entirely without trace, and his aura was more erratic after his reappearance.  Clearly, this ability placed a considerable burden on him.</p><p>Leaving the Sun God Tree suspended beside him, Qin Sang raised his right arm, extending it towards the distant death energy vortex in the distance. His fingers curled into claws, he grabbed forcefully. The demon fire within the vortex suddenly converged, forming the shape of a fire lotus.</p><p>The demonic fire hadn't been fully refined; the edges of the fire lotus were hazy, and some stray flames swirled around it.  The demonic fire power concentrated to its peak. The fire lotus shuddered, unleashing a power that shook the earth. A booming sound echoed from the center of the death qi vortex.</p><p>The vortex collapsed, scattering countless wisps of death qi.  Without the control of the grotesque-faced man, they quickly reverted to their essence as wood spirit energy.  The forest was instantly filled with a rain of green light.</p><p>Qin Sang tapped his finger again. The fire lotus expanded, instantly transforming into a huge ring of fire, large enough to engulf most of the forest, descending from the sky.</p><p>*Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!*</p><p>The flames blazed fiercely. Ancient trees were crushed.  The grotesque-faced man had intended to utilize the forest's terrain; Qin Sang simply set it ablaze!</p><p>Flames erupted, a black wall of fire encircling the battlefield.  Ancient trees, some having become spirit wood through the ages, stood everywhere within the forest, but none could withstand the Nine Nether Demonic Fire. Dust swirled. The fire wall pushed inward, the scorched earth rapidly expanding.</p><p>*Crack!*</p><p>A tree at the edge of the fire wall transformed into a treant. Sensing an opening, the grotesque-faced man leaped there, his connection to the outer forest severed by the Nine Nether Demonic Fire, forcing him out.</p><p>The grotesque-faced man hadn't expected Qin Sang to find the key so quickly. After Zhu Wu Dao sent him the Crimson Xuan Ancient Tree, he began refining the Acquired Wooden Man Stele. This technique was a secret method of the Wood Phase Hall. Before reaching its peak, it needed to be performed in a place rich with wood spirit energy to achieve its full power.  He had spent most of his time cultivating his Gu King, leaving insufficient time for this cultivation, and was still some distance from mastery.</p><p>He no longer felt like mocking; with a flash, the grotesque-faced man tried to break through the demonic fire blockade.</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>The Ice Soul Divine Light reappeared.  Seeing that his Snow-Treading Divine Blade posed no threat, the incarnation sheathed the blade, focusing on wielding the divine light.  The sword formation followed closely.</p><p>The grotesque-faced man was first covered in a layer of frost, then encased by sword threads. Even his powerful wood spirit body couldn't withstand this.</p><p>Qin Sang directly summoned three Sun Divine Birds. He now had a degree of control over them; it was no longer a reckless gamble. The birds circled above, poised to strike. If the grotesque-faced man didn't dodge, however, the birds wouldn't merely feign an attack.</p><p>Furthermore, Qin Sang periodically used the Soul-Capturing Incantation. Even though the grotesque-faced man was wary, he couldn't help but be affected by the constant stinging pain in his primordial spirit.  Several attempts to escape proved futile.</p><p>Anxiety gradually appeared on the grotesque-faced man's face.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>Crimson flames erupted.  Controlling the Sun Divine Birds for too long, while also managing the demonic fire and sword formation, exceeded Qin Sang's abilities, forcing him to act.  Sure enough, the Sun Divine Birds missed again.</p><p>The grotesque-faced man's maneuverability was greatly reduced. He reappeared in another location, immediately followed by the divine light and sword formation. Unexpectedly, the grotesque-faced man acted out of character, not rushing to counterattack but instead staring at Qin Sang, a slight sneer playing on his lips.</p><p>Noticing the grotesque-faced man's expression, Qin Sang's eyes narrowed. He felt an inexplicable sense of danger and, without hesitation, used his phoenix wings to soar into the air.</p><p>The grotesque-faced man's brow bulged, and a blood jade insect emerged from his forehead.  In a short time, the jade insect turned a blood-red, strikingly eerie.</p><p>The blood jade insect writhed on his forehead, contorting the grotesque-faced man's features. Despite the strength of his wood spirit body, his aura fluctuated violently, suffering severe backlash.</p><p>He squeezed out a sinister whisper, "Take my Heaven-Annihilating Soul-Shattering Divine Needle! You shall die!"</p><p>*Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!*</p><p>After the collapse of the death qi vortex, luminous points scattered throughout the forest.  Suddenly, all the luminous points around the grotesque-faced man floated in the air.  Each point contained the phantom of a jade insect.</p><p>Earlier, the grotesque-faced man had launched three poison rays. Knowing from the Weeping Spirit Cave Master that Qin Sang’s spiritual sense was exceptionally strong, he knew there was a chance of being discovered. Thus, he had a backup plan.  If successful, that was good. If he failed, he could use the poison rays as cover to secretly set a trap, transforming the luminous points into the power of jade insects, until he forced Qin Sang to use the Sun Divine Tree and then launch his killing blow at the moment when the old power had been exhausted and the new one had yet to emerge!</p><p>The Heaven-Annihilating Soul-Shattering Divine Needle possessed immense power. Unfortunately, even with his Nascent Soul late-stage cultivation, it took considerable preparation and couldn't be used casually.</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>The luminous points transformed into needles, their tips gleaming with cold, sinister poison light.  All the needles simultaneously aimed at Qin Sang, shooting forth!</p><p>Though the needles were fast, Qin Sang had been anticipating the grotesque-faced man's move and maintained his distance, his speed like lightning. The needles seemed unable to catch him.</p><p>The grotesque-faced man's forehead glowed with blood light. He muttered something, and a cacophony of wingbeats echoed.</p><p>The next moment, an astonishing sight unfolded. The blood jade insect left the grotesque-faced man's forehead, flew through the air to the needles below, its eyes fixed on Qin Sang, radiating fierce, bloody light. The needles instantly fused, forming a needle as thin as a hair.</p><p>The needle flashed, seemingly transcending space, chasing after Qin Sang.</p>
