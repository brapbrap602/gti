<h1>Chapter 1113: The Northern Sea</h1><p>The three were buried together.</p><p>Qin Sang and Qing Jun stood before the tomb, burning incense and offering their respects.</p><p>"Senior Sister, have you not yet found peace?" Qin Sang turned his head and asked.</p><p>Earlier, during their casual conversation, Qin Sang had learned the reason behind Qing Jun's distant relationship with her father, Qing Zhu.</p><p>"If I had not found peace, how could I have achieved my current level of cultivation?" Qing Jun smiled faintly.</p><p>"When I was in my teens, I hated him to the core.</p><p>"He was obsessed with cultivation, solely focused on avenging his aunt, almost to the point of madness. Since birth, it had only been my mother and I, relying on each other.</p><p>"I thought he saw my mother as a substitute for his aunt, a way to make up for his regrets. I hated him for not loving my mother, for hurting another person, and for bringing me into this world.</p><p>"However, when I reached my forties, after many years of experience in the cultivation world, I began to understand his perspective. Although I still felt my mother was wronged, I gradually found peace within myself.</p><p>"By the time I reached a hundred, or even several hundred years old, that period of my life had become insignificant, just a memory, and my heart no longer stirred with emotion.</p><p>"My vow to kill Leng Yuntian was more for my mother's sake.</p><p>"Having entered the path of immortality, if others can keep up with my pace, we might share a smile and a drink. If not, they are merely passersby in my life.</p><p>"He was just someone who came earlier, with a more special status.</p><p>"That's all."</p><p>Qin Sang remained silent, deep in thought.</p><p>"If you plan to stay in Peach Blossom Valley to cultivate, as long as you don't damage the peach forest, you can choose any spot on the mountainsides to open a cave dwelling..."</p><p>Qin Sang looked around.</p><p>This place was much safer than Yun Youzi's cave dwelling, and the spiritual energy was more abundant. Qin Sang decided to send a message to Li Yufu later, planning to stay in Peach Blossom Valley for secluded cultivation.</p><p>Beside him was a peach tree laden with fruit.</p><p>Qin Sang passed under the tree and plucked one.</p><p>'Crunch!'</p><p>He took a big bite.</p><p>It was indeed sweet, but with a hint of sourness, giving it a unique flavor.</p><p>In Qin Sang's opinion, the taste was slightly inferior to the one in Nether Valley, and even more so compared to the one at Sword Gate Pass.</p><p>Yet, this was the most cherished flavor in Qing Zhu's memories.</p><p>Qin Sang savored it carefully, standing still for a long time.</p><p>After walking around Peach Blossom Valley, Qin Sang found a small waterfall on one of the mountainsides, quite elegant and suitable for quiet cultivation.</p><p>He quickly opened a simple cave dwelling.</p><p>Thinking about today's unexpected encounter, it was truly surprising.</p><p>Of course, Qin Sang had always remained calm.</p><p>The so-called senior sister and junior brother were merely titles. As Qing Jun had said earlier, if he failed to form his Nascent Soul and couldn't keep up with her pace, he would just be a passerby.</p><p>What surprised him was that Qing Jun showed no interest in where he and Qing Zhu had gone.</p><p>However, Qin Sang had been pondering this matter.</p><p>The frequent anomalies in the Purple Micro Palace and the Seven Slaughter Hall made it unclear what the future would hold.</p><p>The overall strength of the cultivation world in the Cold Domain was far inferior to that of the Canglang Sea.</p><p>Moreover, the teleportation array could only be activated when the Purple Micro Palace appeared, making travel between the two places highly restricted.</p><p>Even if he kept it hidden in his heart, telling no one.</p><p>After forming his Nascent Soul, if he wanted to return to the Canglang Sea, whether to explore the Seven Slaughter Hall or to seek resources from both places, it would be difficult to accomplish alone; he would need allies.</p><p>Both Yun Youzi and Qing Jun were trustworthy candidates.</p><p>After finishing his chores, Qin Sang returned to the wooden house, where he caught the scent of elegant tea.</p><p>Smoke curled upwards.</p><p>Qin Sang knelt down, his red robe spreading on the floor.</p><p>A small red clay stove, delicate hands preparing the tea.</p><p>Sipping the spiritual tea personally poured by a Nascent Soul cultivator, Qin Sang felt a sense of unreality.</p><p>"I really don't know which one is the real her," Qin Sang sighed inwardly.</p><p>"Do you still remember Chen Yan?" Qing Jun fiddled with the flame and glanced at Qin Sang.</p><p>"Of course, I remember," Qin Sang nodded, putting down the teacup and leaning forward slightly. "Back then, I was schemed against by Dongyang Bo, and it was related to her. In the Bronze Hall, it was with her help that I managed to escape and break free from his grasp..."</p><p>From selling himself to build his foundation, to being used by Dongyang Bo as a bargaining chip to control Chen Yan in the Black Tower of the Purple Micro Palace.</p><p>Qin Sang candidly recounted the entire story.</p><p>Qin Sang assumed Qing Jun already knew about his selling himself to build his foundation.</p><p>"Oh?" Qing Jun's eyes showed surprise. "I wondered how you, a mere False Core cultivator, managed to escape under the noses of two Nascent Soul cultivators. So there was such a hidden story? According to your words, Chen Yan and Dongyang Bo should have already turned against each other. Why did Chen Yan assist Dongyang Bo for many years after leaving the Purple Micro Palace before finally leaving Shaohua Mountain?"</p><p>Qin Sang pondered for a moment and said, "Perhaps something else happened later, and they reached some agreement? Chen Yan wanted to save her master, and Dongyang Bo seemed to be plotting for a treasure in the Bronze Hall. After I escaped, Dongyang Bo had no other means to threaten Chen Yan, so it's possible he compromised with her."</p><p>After a pause, Qin Sang asked, "I remember Senior Sister mentioning before that Chen Yan is not a disciple of Shaohua Mountain. After leaving Shaohua Mountain, did she return to her hometown? I wonder if she managed to save her master?"</p><p>"Her master is a late-stage Nascent Soul cultivator. If she had truly been rescued, Shaohua Mountain wouldn't be in its current state. With such a powerful ally, resisting the Sin Abyss would be much easier for both regions."</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head. "As for Chen Yan, she disappeared without a trace after leaving, most likely no longer in the Northern Star Realm."</p><p>"Not in the Northern Star Realm? Is she from another realm?"</p><p>Previously, Qin Sang's cultivation was too low, and he hadn't even left the Cold Domain, so his understanding of the cultivation world was vague.</p><p>As far as he knew, the Cold Domain, the Heavenly Alliance, and the Sin Abyss were all part of a vast cultivation world called the Northern Star Realm.</p><p>Strangely, there were very few legends from outside the Northern Star Realm that made their way in.</p><p>"Correct. The Four Realms of the Northern Sea, also known as the Four Islands of the Northern Sea.</p><p>"The Northern Star Realm we are in is just one of them.</p><p>"The other three realms, though called islands, are actually connected, forming a vast continent.</p><p>"Only our Northern Star Realm is isolated in the sea, separated by violent storms. Although it is possible to connect, it is very dangerous, and even Nascent Soul ancestors find it difficult to cross. Hence, the Northern Star Realm is rarely influenced by the other three realms.</p><p>"Among these three realms, there are many mid-stage Nascent Soul peak cultivators, even great cultivators. Their overall strength surpasses that of our Northern Star Realm. Chen Yan must be from one of these three realms, possibly from a major sect.</p><p>"Strangely, no matter how powerful a sect is, they wouldn't ignore the disappearance of a great cultivator. Her master has been trapped in the Purple Micro Palace for so long, yet no one has come to search for her."</p><p>Seeing that Qin Sang was not very familiar with this, Qing Jun briefly explained the Four Realms of the Northern Sea.</p><p>Another storm barrier!</p><p>Hearing this familiar term, Qin Sang was already accustomed to it and not surprised.</p><p>The Northern Star Realm was very similar to the Canglang Sea and the Demon Sea, indeed a cage surrounded by storms.</p><p>However, the Northern Star Realm could connect with the other three realms; crossing the storm barrier would lead there.</p><p>Additionally, Qin Sang keenly noticed a question: the so-called Northern Sea, what was the 'north' relative to?</p>
