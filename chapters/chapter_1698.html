<h1>Chapter 1689:  The Emperor Mountain Crumbles</h1><p>Crimson flames blazed across the sky.  Cultivators outside the mountain witnessed firsthand how red light burst from a fissure in the nearly closed cloud, instantly turning golden clouds into fiery clouds.  A terrifying power surged forth with the red light, pushing the layers of light and clouds rapidly aside.</p><p>Qinghu Saint King's three illusory bodies formed a triangle, one in front and two behind.  Her imposing presence remained strong, but now she was completely illuminated by the red light, seeming to be on the verge of melting.</p><p>Before them was a fireball.</p><p>The fireball itself wasn't particularly large, but its brilliance was blinding, its power ferocious, stinging everyone's eyes.  Cultivators skilled in spiritual eye techniques hurriedly activated their cultivation methods, trying to discern the fireball's essence.</p><p>But all they saw were raging flames.</p><p>Even from a distance, the brutal energy within the fireball was palpable, causing many to recall the rising sun, their hearts trembling.</p><p>Behind the fireball, the Solar God Tree gently swayed.  No one could have imagined such terrifying power originating from this small tree.</p><p>Qin Sang's main body and avatar were bathed in the fiery light, their entire bodies glowing crimson, appearing as though ignited by the Nanming Li Fire.</p><p>His avatar quickly moved to catch his main body.</p><p>His main body was covered in blood, his expression contorted by excruciating pain, his whole body trembling.</p><p>The pain stemmed from within.  After suffering two waves of impact, his blood vessels and meridians were ravaged by a violent torrent, leaving him wounded throughout. This was truly a case of self-harm before harming the enemy.</p><p>Qin Sang suspected that if he hadn't cultivated demonic techniques and achieved some proficiency in body refinement, he would have exploded and died without the Qinghu Saint King needing to lift a finger.</p><p>His eyes bloodshot, Qin Sang gazed past the Solar God Tree into the depths of the Nanming Li Fire, uncertain of the damage this would inflict upon the Qinghu Saint King.</p><p>He knew that easily slaying a Saint King was wishful thinking.</p><p>However, as long as he could injure the Qinghu Saint King, rendering her unable to stir up trouble, it would be enough.  Whether this might lead to the collapse of the Suspended Lake and affect the battle above, releasing the ancient demons, was not something Qin Sang considered.  If anyone was to blame, it was the instigator; he couldn't just surrender and be slaughtered.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The raging flames passed, shaking the sword formation.</p><p>The scene from before repeated itself: the Seven Stars Sword Formation was torn apart by a larger fissure, almost piercing the entire golden cloud.</p><p>Raging flames rushed forward.</p><p>The three illusory bodies’ robes fluttered, their momentum suppressed by the flames.</p><p>The Qinghu Saint King felt the extremely violent power, her eyes deep and moved.  The Nanming Li Fire had first erupted within the sword formation; only a portion had burst out, so the impact hadn't been as strong. Now, facing the Nanming Li Fire directly, she realized it was even stronger than she'd anticipated.</p><p>She hadn't expected Qin Sang, with his near-depleted true essence, to be able to unleash such flames, and even to use her charm technique to set a trap.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>The illusory fox paw was the first to touch the Nanming Li Fire.</p><p>Under the impact of the spiritual fire, a bright green light exploded, cracks appearing on the paw before it shattered.  Fragments scattered like flowers, instantly swept away by the flames, meeting the same fate as Su Zinan's giant demonic soul.</p><p>In an instant, the Nanming Li Fire was close at hand.</p><p>In this critical moment, the Qinghu Saint King didn't attempt to retreat or dodge, not even changing her posture; she remained stiff, the light in her eyes fading like a receding tide.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The flames rolled over the illusory bodies.</p><p>It wasn't just one, but all three illusory bodies that were engulfed.  At this moment, the Qinghu Saint King could only focus on protecting herself, unable to spare any attention for her illusory bodies.</p><p>Before the eyes of everyone present, the three illusory bodies offered virtually no resistance, instantly swallowed by the sea of fire, only a fleeting shadow of a fox tail disappearing at the last moment.</p><p>Crushing defeat!  Not a single piece remained!</p><p>The Legacy Mansion erupted in an uproar.</p><p>Some gaped, speechless with shock.</p><p>They might not have known about the Qinghu Saint King's illusory bodies, but the power of the three forms was undeniable; they'd all assumed her end had come.  Unexpectedly, not only had the three illusory bodies failed to defeat their enemy, but they had been burned to ashes by the flames, without even a chance to escape.</p><p>“What kind of flame is this?”</p><p>“Is it a divine treasure or a magical power?”</p><p>“Who is this powerful figure who completely annihilated the Three Illusory Bodies of the Yaozu Saint King?”</p><p>“No wonder they dared to kill the Saint King's disciple!”</p><p>“Damn it! These old geezers are always scheming against each other. If they could just cooperate, with such power, how could the demon lord be so arrogant?”</p><p>…</p><p>Exclamations echoed throughout the Legacy Manor, everyone buzzing with discussion.</p><p>Their gazes were fixed on Mount Disu, watching as a blazing inferno erupted from the golden clouds, its momentum unchecked, it surged towards the mountain’s edge, its power filling the heavens, unstoppable. Finally, it exploded in mid-air.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The explosion shook the earth.</p><p>The fiery ball that exploded in the sky was visible from every corner of the Legacy Manor.  Crimson flames divided into countless streams, each like a firework, painting the sky red, creating a bizarrely beautiful spectacle.</p><p>No one was truly captivated by the beauty; instead, they felt a chilling fear. After the explosion, there was no trace of the Saint King's illusory bodies left, not even ashes.</p><p>As if in response to the inferno, a greater roar came from Mount Disu. The mountain, already slowly tilting, suddenly accelerated its descent.</p><p>‘Rumble…’</p><p>The entire Legacy Manor trembled.</p><p>Mount Disu collapsed, the earth splitting asunder!</p><p>It looked as if it had been destroyed by the South Ming Li Fire.</p><p>In fact, Mount Disu's rapid collapse was indeed inextricably linked to the South Ming Li Fire. The Five Elements Divine Ban clashed, the Seven Mansions Star Field Sword Array was shaken twice, its formation disrupted, becoming the weakest point, indirectly accelerating the destruction of the Five Elements Divine Ban.</p><p>The collapsing mountain peak crashed into the Five Elements Divine Ban, clouds surging, filling the sky.</p><p>Within the clouds, various strange lights erupted in chaotic disorder. This was the mountain's protective array making its last stand. It was evident that most of it wouldn’t withstand the Five Elements Divine Ban.</p><p>Countless secret treasures, countless priceless artifacts of the Wuxiang Immortal Sect, countless cultivation techniques and secret manuals left by ancestors, were all to be lost.</p><p>The cultivators witnessing this scene were heartbroken.</p><p>At this moment, those alert enough sensed something, imagining the worst possible outcome, their faces changing, hurriedly looking towards the Suspended Lake.</p><p>The lake water was as black as ink.</p><p>Moonlight and the streams of light emitted by the cultivators' combined formation converged into a single powerful strike aimed at the demonic body.</p><p>The Qinghu Saint King's eyes froze for a moment before quickly regaining their brilliance; such a subtle change would be difficult for most to notice.</p><p>According to her plan, this combined attack, even if it couldn't harm the demonic body, would trigger its defensive instincts, preventing it from causing trouble at this moment. She would use this opportunity to manifest an illusory body, capture Qin Sang, then immediately return and calmly regain control of the situation.</p><p>Everything should have gone smoothly.</p><p>Yet, the unexpected happened.</p><p>As the Qinghu Saint King returned to her main body, her delicate form trembled suddenly. Having witnessed the power of the demonic flames, even with the upper hand, she remained vigilant, sensing danger, and unhesitatingly chose to return.</p><p>However, even with her quick reaction, though she escaped, her three illusory bodies were completely obliterated.</p><p>The illusory bodies were formed from her fox tails, unable to harm her core, but the fragments of her consciousness remaining in them, were incinerated by the flames.</p><p>Especially the illusory body she had occupied; the fragment of her consciousness had only just merged with her main body and was not easily separated.</p><p>A crimson blush rose on the Qinghu Saint King’s cheeks, and she let out a soft groan, seemingly in pain.</p><p>Even so, her voice retained an indescribable charm, her slightly furrowed brows portraying a pitiable innocence, inadvertently displaying countless forms of allure.</p><p>The Qinghu Saint King's distress directly affected the battle.</p><p>With her groan, the bright moon in the sky seemed to be veiled, its light dimmed, and at the same time, the Suspended Lake was agitated by surging waves, its surface undulating, not caused by the demonic body's attacks, but by the lake itself.</p><p>The Suspended Lake and the bright moon were the foundations of the demonic body's imprisonment; it was through these powers that Fan Laomo and the others were able to engage it.</p><p>In an instant, everyone felt the anomaly.</p><p>The demonic body sensed the lessening pressure. Its innate fighting instinct allowed it to seize the opportunity, letting out a terrifying demonic howl, boundless demonic energy surging from within, transforming again into demonic claws.</p><p>This time, there were fewer claws, but they were even more terrifying.</p><p>The five-colored crown atop the demonic body radiated fierce power.  Its glow mingled with the demonic claws, indistinguishable from one another, a terrifying sight as it swiped at the group.</p><p>By now, the demonic spirit's consciousness was consumed by madness, acting purely on instinct.  The Poison King's cocoon, like a turtle shell, shielded him. The demonic body no longer focused on the Poison King, who gradually escaped the vortex's center.</p><p>Fan Laomo and the others were even more tempting targets.</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>A demonic claw tore through the air, its five fingers like hooks.</p><p>Fan Laomo's scalp tingled.  Seeing that the suspended lake and Langyue failed to restrain the demonic body, he instantly understood that Qinghu Shengwang must have encountered a problem. He cursed the Saint King under his breath.</p><p>He manifested a dark lotus beneath him, preparing to act.</p><p>The others were equally distraught, scrambling to use their most powerful techniques to survive.  Their primary concern was escape; maintaining the Zen Arhat formation was impossible.</p><p>The combined attack shattered, leaving the future uncertain.</p><p>At that moment, a brilliant light erupted from behind Huiguang Shengzhe.  Immeasurable light flooded the suspended lake.  A figure within the light clasped its hands, a faint chanting echoing in everyone's ears.</p><p>The next moment, the figure stepped out, pointing at the demonic body.  A golden light shot forth.</p><p>The golden light solidified into a ring, encircling the demonic body.</p><p>After releasing the golden light, the figure vanished, turning to glare angrily at Qinghu Shengwang, like an enraged wrathful king.</p><p>"Qinghu!"</p><p>The roar was like thunder, deep and laced with anger and warning.</p><p>'Crack crack crack…'</p><p>The demonic body's flesh swelled, the golden ring trembling violently.  It wouldn't hold for long, but thankfully, Fan Laomo and the others sensed the attack and reacted accordingly.</p><p>Qinghu Shengwang, knowing he was at fault, remained silent. His jade hands moved, performing a spell to suppress his injuries and stabilize himself. Closing his eyes, he muttered an incantation.</p><p>The lake calmed, and Langyue shone brightly again.</p><p>The golden ring shattered at that precise moment. Before the demonic body could counterattack, the surrounding pressure surged back.</p><p>Working together, they managed to avert a catastrophic situation.</p><p>Huiguang Shengzhe was instrumental. Thankfully, anticipating the difficulty of focusing during the heart fire blood refinement, he had prepared a contingency plan.  Otherwise, the consequences would have been unthinkable.</p><p>Huiguang Shengzhe's true body, however, wasn't unscathed; he too was affected. The moment the phantom attacked, the demon-sealing stake creaked, the bloody aura intensifying dramatically. Huiguang Shengzhe's arms trembled, his veins bulging.</p><p>"Roar!"</p><p>The demonic body roared, launching another attack.</p><p>The suspended lake and Langyue were now stable, and Qinghu Shengwang, having suffered a setback, focused solely on the demonic body, gradually regaining his footing.</p><p>However, Qinghu Shengwang didn't abandon his pursuit of Qin Sang.</p><p>Outside the mountain.</p><p>Bai Xiao led his demon horde, advancing cautiously. Seeing the situation stabilize, they believed the danger had subsided and accelerated their pace, intending to assist the Saint King.  Unexpectedly, a complication arose.</p><p>Seeing the Saint King's phantom perish, uncertain of the Saint King's true state, he hesitated. Then, Qinghu Shengwang's icy voice echoed, "He's at the end of his rope. Don't let him escape; otherwise, I will hold you accountable!"</p><p>Bai Xiao's heart pounded.</p><p>The Saint King's tone was drastically different from previous commands; it was incredibly severe.</p><p>He had dared to delay earlier, but now he didn't dare hesitate.  He had no doubt that the Saint King would flay him alive and destroy his lair upon his return.</p><p>"Quickly! Seize that boy! Anyone who delays, I'll flay him alive!"</p><p>Bai Xiao fiercely kicked a bird demon ahead, transforming into a white light and accelerating tremendously.  The demons followed suit, creating a chaotic spectacle.</p><p>…</p><p>When the Nanming Lihuo burst from the mountain, many were stunned by its power.  Suddenly, someone pointed towards Di Shou Mountain and cried out,</p><p>"There!"</p><p>Behind the flames, within a crack in the golden clouds, a figure had escaped along with the flames.</p><p>"It's him!"</p><p>The person, who had destroyed the Saint King's three phantoms, was still alive and had escaped.</p><p>Where was he going?</p><p>The question arose in everyone's minds.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the figure paused slightly, not fleeing towards the entrance of the relic but heading straight towards a region of towering peaks east of Di Shou Mountain.</p><p>The peaks resembled swords, their formations seamlessly integrated, their aura dense, clearly indicating a powerful formation.</p><p>"That's Jinxiang Hall…"</p><p>Someone recognized it.</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't unwilling to flee immediately or hide in Di Shou Mountain to recover.  The problem was that the sky was filled with demonic energy along the escape route.  Qinghu Shengwang had pursuers; numerous demon kings, and among them, a presence that threatened Qin Sang, far beyond his current capabilities. Moreover, the Five Elements Divine Ban was about to collapse.  He might perish before the pursuers caught him.</p><p>Considering the entire relic, Jinxiang Hall was perhaps the best option.</p><p>The golden sword he obtained contained Jinxiang Hall's sword array.  Jinxiang Hall's mountain-protecting formation incorporated a part of that sword array.  Entering Jinxiang Hall, even if he couldn't use the array to kill his enemies, he could at least maneuver.</p><p>Qin Sang headed straight for Jinxiang Hall, unhindered.  In fact, virtually no one dared approach Di Shou Mountain, even those who did would hesitate facing the Nanming Lihuo.  No one knew Qin Sang's current state.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>The figure moved like lightning.</p><p>Qin Sang arrived at the edge of Jinxiang Hall, seeing the sword peaks below, each seemingly radiating sword intent, connected to the mountain-protecting formation, its sharp formation seemingly natural.</p><p>The demon horde approached.</p><p>Using his Heavenly Eye divine ability, Qin Sang quickly located familiar formations and, without hesitation, chose one, plunging downwards.  His figure sparked with a faint blue light, vanishing instantly among the peaks.</p>
