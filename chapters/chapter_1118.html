<h1>Chapter 1110: Hastening Maturity</h1><p>Chapter 1110: Hastening Maturity</p><p>Afterwards, the four left Cui Ming Mountain, speeding along the Wu Ling River before arriving at Li Yu Fu's cave dwelling.</p><p>The dwelling was hidden deep in the mountains, absorbing the essence of the landscape.</p><p>Reuniting with old friends and learning that Yun Youzi and Mu Yi Feng were safe and sound,</p><p>Qin Sang was in high spirits.</p><p>This barren land actually concealed such a rich spiritual vein, sufficient for Golden Core cultivators.  Once he retrieved the Nine Phantom Sky Orchid, he could cultivate here while waiting for Yun Youzi.</p><p>With this in mind, Qin Sang gave Li Yu Fu and the others a few instructions before leaving alone, continuing south.</p><p>Yun Cang Great Marsh.</p><p>Qin Sang would never forget where he'd hidden the medicinal herb.</p><p>His thoughts were turbulent.</p><p>The good news was that the forces of the Abyss had been contained by the Heavenly Path Alliance, and the Yun Cang Great Marsh had escaped the ravages of war. He had hidden the herb well; barring unforeseen circumstances, it should still be there!</p><p>Without stopping, he reached the edge of the Yun Cang Great Marsh and flew into the vast expanse of water.</p><p>The long-awaited herb was within reach.</p><p>Qin Sang burrowed into the mud and sand, descending directly.</p><p>Deep underground, he finally sensed resistance.</p><p>The Xuan Ming Turtle Shell Array was intact!</p><p>Qin Sang felt a surge of relief, a glimmer of joy in his eyes. He waved his hand, opening the spirit array. A wave of rich spiritual energy washed over him, and Qin Sang hurried into the cave, subconsciously holding his breath.</p><p>The spiritual spring remained, the cave unusually saturated with spiritual energy.</p><p>In the center of the spring, an orchid stood gracefully, instantly capturing Qin Sang's attention!</p><p>Eight-tenths bloomed.</p><p>All color had drained from the orchid, leaving it a pure white.</p><p>Simple.</p><p>Serene.</p><p>Yet captivating.</p><p>The Nine Phantom Sky Orchid had completed its eighth transformation!</p><p>Qin Sang stared at the Nine Phantom Sky Orchid, speechless for a long time.</p><p>This orchid had witnessed his escape from Yuan Zhao Gate, his entry into Shao Hua Mountain, his journey through the Qi Refining, Foundation Establishment, and Golden Core stages.  After many years and countless miles, they were reunited.</p><p>Qin Sang slowly approached the spiritual spring, lost in thought as he recalled his experiences.</p><p>Coming back to himself, he took out the Three Lights Jade Liquid.</p><p>Now, his most important task was to achieve Nascent Soul cultivation.</p><p>After attending to his affairs, Qin Sang would find a place to close himself off and cultivate until he reached the peak of the Golden Core stage. Ten years of experience in the Demon Sea, and several battles with the Seven Killing Hall, had given him ample experience. He probably wouldn't need to seek further combat to improve.</p><p>True Killing Talismans would continue to enhance his talent, and he had also purchased a batch of cultivation-enhancing pills from Yin Mountain Pass. His cultivation speed would be even faster than before.</p><p>It wouldn't be long before he could prepare for the Nascent Soul stage.</p><p>To avoid unforeseen delays, Qin Sang decided to directly accelerate the maturity of the Nine Phantom Sky Orchid and retrieve the herb.</p><p>"I hope the Three Lights Jade Liquid really works, and nothing goes wrong…"</p><p>The imminent maturation of the Nine Phantom Sky Orchid caused Qin Sang inexplicable worry. He had tried this before; the fruit he’d hastened with the Three Lights Jade Liquid had only outward appearances but lacked any medicinal efficacy.</p><p>The Nine Phantom Sky Orchid had once thrived in the Hanging Garden Palace, nourished by celestial prohibitions. But having been removed from Zi Wei Palace for so long, he wondered if it had undergone unforeseen changes.</p><p>‘Snap!’</p><p>Qin Sang removed the prohibition on the spiritual spring and opened the jade bottle.</p><p>Sensing the aura of the Three Lights Jade Liquid, the Nine Phantom Sky Orchid slowly leaned towards the bottle's mouth, exuding an almost eager anticipation.</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang immediately guided a drop of the Three Lights Jade Liquid towards the Nine Phantom Sky Orchid.</p><p>‘Drip!’</p><p>The Three Lights Jade Liquid dropped into the pistil and was instantly absorbed.</p><p>In an instant, boundless vitality filled the cave, the Nine Phantom Sky Orchid stretching, its pistil, petals, even the entire plant seemed to dance with joy.</p><p>The spiritual mist the orchid emitted shifted and gathered, creating wondrous sights that kept Qin Sang captivated.</p><p>Qin Sang watched intently, holding his breath.</p><p>Finally, he keenly sensed that the Nine Phantom Sky Orchid's aura was rapidly changing.</p><p>The liquid worked!</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang finally felt reassured.</p><p>He remembered that the Nine Phantom Sky Orchid began its eighth transformation around the time of his first return from the Ancient Immortal Battlefield.</p><p>Each transformation took five hundred years.</p><p>So there were still three hundred years until its ninth and final transformation.</p><p>At most, four drops of Three Lights Jade Liquid were needed.</p><p>In the Cang Lang Sea, Qin Sang had encountered several dangers, using quite a bit, but he still had more than enough to mature the Nine Phantom Sky Orchid.</p><p>A few days later, the spiritual mist finally stabilized.</p><p>The medicinal effect had been completely absorbed.</p><p>The Nine Phantom Sky Orchid showed no obvious external changes; its form only drastically changes during its transformation.</p><p>Qin Sang continued to use the Three Lights Jade Liquid to nurture the spirit herb.</p><p>After using the third drop, something unexpected happened.</p><p>Having absorbed the medicinal power, the petals suddenly closed tightly together, forming a bud.  Not long after, it slowly opened before Qin Sang.</p><p>At this moment, the Nine Illusory Sky Orchid shed all its splendor, even the spiritual mist dissipated, transforming into a most simple and unadorned orchid!</p><p>A return to simplicity!</p><p>To the naked eye, it was indistinguishable from an ordinary earthly orchid.</p><p>"Using only three drops of Three Lights Jade Liquid to mature the Nine Illusory Sky Orchid. It seems that the claim of each drop increasing the age by a hundred years isn't a fixed rule.  Saving a drop is good; I had so few left…"</p><p>Qin Sang mused to himself.</p><p>Seeing the long-awaited Nine Illusory Sky Orchid finally mature, a look of unrestrained joy appeared on Qin Sang's face. He carefully removed it from the spirit spring, handling it with utmost care.</p><p>After a while, Qin Sang took out a jade box he had prepared, placed the herb inside, and sealed its medicinal power with a restriction.</p><p>A look of emotion crossed Qin Sang's face. He took one last look at his former cave abode, then, carrying the treasure from the spirit spring, flew up from the water.</p><p>The treasure was retrieved.</p><p>A weight lifted from his heart.</p><p>Qin Sang flew discreetly over the water, pondering what else he needed to do.</p><p>He had initially planned to infiltrate the area near Mount Shao Hua to inquire about Mu Yifeng's whereabouts. Since Mu Yifeng hadn't been implicated in the Duke Dongyang's wrath, there was no need to risk it.</p><p>Though he longed to visit old friends from his former sect, the Duke Dongyang's threat hung like a sword over him, forcing him to act cautiously.</p><p>"Bury Elder Qingzhu, then investigate the recent situation, and then return to seclusion."</p><p>Qin Sang made his decision, altering his course westward.</p><p>"Peach Blossom Valley, that should be Elder Qingzhu's hometown! If Peach Blossom Valley has Crimson Jade Peaches, they must be the ones with the better taste Elder Qingzhu mentioned; I wonder how sweet they are?"</p><p>Peach Blossom Valley is located on the edge of the Yun Cang Great Marsh, between Mount Shao Hua and the Yuan Shen Gate.  According to Elder Qingzhu, it's not the territory of any cultivation sect or family.</p><p>Finding the place shouldn't be difficult.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't have much trouble pinpointing Peach Blossom Valley's location.</p><p>Shortly after flying out of the Yun Cang Great Marsh, Qin Sang entered the mountain range. After flying along one of the mountain ridges for a while, he suddenly descended.</p><p>It was dawn.</p><p>Morning mist drifted through the mountains, shrouding several peaks.</p><p>Peach Blossom Valley lay below.</p><p>Qin Sang landed on a mountain peak and, using his true essence, activated the sigil Elder Qingzhu had taught him.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the mist rippled, but the spirit array didn't open.</p><p>At that moment, a red figure suddenly flashed out from within the array.</p><p>"Eh? You're not dead?"</p>
