<h1>Chapter 1329: The Soul Infant Array</h1><p>Yu Gu, fearless in death, furiously attacked the seal.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The stone pillars shattered.</p><p>Ye Laomo decisively retreated.</p><p>The power of the seal became extremely chaotic, and the two soul flames in Yu Gu's eyes burned even more fiercely.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>Finally, Yu Gu forcefully broke through the seal!</p><p>“Haha……”</p><p>Yu Gu let out a maniacal laugh.</p><p>Ye Laomo looked up at the frenzied demon, his expression shifting.</p><p>At that moment, Yu Gu's laughter abruptly stopped, followed by a furious curse, and he suddenly collapsed, falling onto the stone path.</p><p>Ye Laomo then noticed that Yu Gu's body, as hard as jade, was now fractured bone by bone.  The power of the seal was evident; no wonder this demon had insisted on his finding Yu Gu.</p><p>“Crack crack…”</p><p>Yu Gu's body underwent a strange contortion, his skin gradually recovering, inflating like a balloon at a visible speed, slowly regaining a human shape.</p><p>The broken bones mended themselves. Yu Gu twisted, rising from the ground.</p><p>The demon's current state was peculiar. Even for the worldly-wise Ye Laomo, it was a first.</p><p>He had no flesh, yet his bones, skin, and meridians were intact.</p><p>Through his skin, one could clearly see his skeletal frame and dried-up meridians.</p><p>It should have been a corpse, yet it was alive.</p><p>Soul flames flickered in the empty eye sockets. Yu Gu twisted his neck, turning towards Ye Laomo.</p><p>Ye Laomo felt observed, instinctively taking a step back, on guard.</p><p>“Humph!”</p><p>Yu Gu coldly snorted, his tone laced with displeasure, “Had you released me earlier, this wouldn't have happened! Now I lack the time to fully control this body, and my power will inevitably be affected!”</p><p>Ye Laomo's expression remained unchanged. He stared at Yu Gu, sensing his unfathomable power, and his apprehension grew.</p><p>His eyes narrowed slightly, he said calmly, “According to what you said before, your current strength is sufficient. Are you deceiving me?”</p><p>Yu Gu chuckled strangely, “You are indeed suspicious. Though you have greatly offended me, you did release me from that dark and hopeless seal. Compared to that, those are minor matters. Taking you with me was a mere trifle, having little impact on me. Why risk the backlash of breaking your oath?”</p><p>Ye Laomo's eyes flashed, “Is that so? Senior understands Ye's predicament.  I've survived this long because I'm cautious.”</p><p>Yu Gu laughed, “Excellent! Excellent! A man like you will indeed live longer! To achieve this, even in my era, you would be considered a remarkable individual! Give me the Soul Infant Array!”</p><p>The Soul Infant Array was the collection of crystal orbs containing sealed Nascent Souls. The Dark Crystal Tower, long situated on the battlefield, absorbed blood煞 and vengeful spirits, merging them with Nascent Souls to create this supremely evil artifact.</p><p>Ye Laomo gestured, sending the Soul Infant Array towards Yu Gu. It was of his own creation, so he didn't worry about Yu Gu seizing control.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>Yu Gu cast a hand seal, and the Soul Infant Array spun rapidly before him, emitting a strong bloody aura. Blood qi emanated from the crystal orbs. In an instant, the entire array transformed into a blood cloud, from which shrill ghostly howls issued.</p><p>Within the blood cloud, the Nascent Souls appeared faintly, completely lost and assimilated by the blood qi, no different from other malevolent spirits.</p><p>Yu Gu's actions were not hidden from Ye Laomo. In his hands, the Soul Infant Array was a scene of bloody chaos, indescribably sinister.</p><p>He was refining the Soul Infant Array, completing the final step, as per their agreement.</p><p>Finally, they jointly refined the Soul Infant Array!</p><p>“Later, we will need to work together to activate the Soul Infant Array. For now, keep it,”</p><p>Yu Gu returned the refined Soul Infant Array to Ye Laomo, then suddenly paused, looking towards the distance.  The soul flames in his eyes flickered. “The Immortal Gate is about to open. Come! If you don't want to miss this opportunity, you must follow my instructions from now on! If you ruin my plans, you know the consequences!”</p><p>Sensing the oppressive aura emanating from Yu Gu, Ye Laomo showed no fear, meeting Yu Gu's gaze calmly.  “Senior probably finds it hard to understand the plight of cultivators of this age. Even with a one in ten thousand chance it's true, Ye chooses to believe you this once.”</p><p>"This is my only chance, and I know what to do!"</p><p>Yu Gu calmly said, "It's because I've accurately predicted every change in Ziwei Palace that you trust me, isn't it?  But you'll soon see your choice was right!"</p><p>The two dashed out along the stone path.</p><p>Yu Gu set his own bones while observing his surroundings.</p><p>It felt like a lifetime ago!</p><p>Seeing the cage that had imprisoned him for countless years, a bright flame of resentment ignited within his soul.</p><p>But then, he fell into confusion. How many of his enemies from back then were still alive?</p><p>Yu Gu noticed Ye Lao Mo flitting through the ancient restrictions, extremely busy.  Guessing his intentions, Yu Gu scoffed, "A pointless endeavor."</p><p>But he didn't stop him.</p><p>...</p><p>Yuanxu, the Sea of Mist.</p><p>The group kept their distance from the vortex, their faces a mixture of anticipation and apprehension as they stared into its depths.</p><p>Turbulent currents surged like a tidal wave, the roar deafening. A strange energy fluctuation appeared.</p><p>Vaguely, they saw the shadow of a gigantic gate, wielding immense power, tearing through countless currents and emerging from the vortex!</p><p>Qin Sang and the others had never witnessed such a grand sight.</p><p>The towering gate, even more imposing than the remnants of Ziwei Palace's gate, bore a crimson 'Sin' character that radiated terrifying killing intent, shocking and unnerving them.</p><p>"Go!"</p><p>Master Canghong led the charge toward the celestial gate, the others quickly suppressing their shock and following close behind.</p><p>*BOOM!*</p><p>The celestial gate trembled violently, a crack appearing.  The group didn't rush in, instead forming a battle formation outside the gate.</p><p>After a while, the gate's shaking intensified, the crack growing larger, yet nothing emerged.</p><p>They exchanged glances and entered in single file.</p><p>They were greeted by a scene of utter devastation!</p><p>Confirming Ye Lao Mo wasn't there, Qin Sang surveyed the surroundings.</p><p>Unlike the inner hall of Ziwei Palace, this place was incredibly dark and oppressive.</p><p>Thick leaden clouds hung low, obscuring the entire view, boundless and suffocating.</p><p>Within the dark clouds, thin streaks of lightning occasionally flashed, providing the only faint light in this space.</p><p>Though seemingly small, the lightning's energy fluctuations were extraordinary.</p><p>One happened to strike not far from them.</p><p>In that instant, Qin Sang's mind tightened, his hairs stood on end, his body trembling, feeling utterly insignificant.</p><p>If that lightning had targeted him, he would have been instantly annihilated.</p><p>The others fared no better.</p><p>Jing Yu, naturally gifted in wielding thunder, also paled, nearly reverting to his true form.</p><p>The group was thrown into chaos.</p><p>Their arrival at the Sin God Palace was met with an immediate and powerful warning.</p><p>While Ziwei Palace had its share of dangers, they were well-hidden.  Unless triggered, they generally remained concealed.</p>
