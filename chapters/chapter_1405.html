<h1>Chapter 1397: Demon Mixing Island and the Spiritless Sea</h1><p>As Qin Sang expected.</p><p>He looked at Lan Jingsi, then at the jade slip, pondering silently.</p><p>Lan Jingsi continued, “Senior Brother will make arrangements in a well-known large city in the Boundless Sea.  You should first contact the informant. Senior Brother will come to meet you as soon as he receives the news.”</p><p>Master Mu's arrangement to meet in the city, rather than elsewhere, was to alleviate Qin Sang's suspicions as much as possible.</p><p>Other matters could be discussed in detail later.</p><p>Qin Sang weighed his options.</p><p>He had already planned to go to the Boundless Sea to investigate Jinghu Lake, and meeting Master Mu wouldn't be inconvenient.</p><p>The other party's urgent request for him to rush to the Boundless Sea likely meant something had happened, requiring his assistance.</p><p>Otherwise, Qin Sang didn't believe that Feng Shangshi had that much influence to make Master Mu take time out of his busy schedule for such a minor matter.</p><p>Since the other party had a request, it was an opportunity to negotiate terms.</p><p>Master Mu didn't know that he possessed the Sky Eye Butterfly, and he was determined to obtain the Ascension Spirit Ritual. The initiative remained in his hands.</p><p>After considering this, Qin Sang picked up the jade slip and scanned its contents with his spiritual sense.</p><p>Seeing this, Lan Jingsi smiled, her tone somewhat urgent.  “The journey is long, and time is of the essence. Please depart as soon as possible. If there were any shortcomings during this time, I hope you will forgive me…”</p><p>It seemed Lan Jingsi wouldn't reveal any more information.</p><p>Qin Sang put away the jade slip, nodded to her, and immediately rose to take his leave.</p><p>He didn't alert any disciples of the Hundred Flowers Valley.</p><p>Qin Sang left Hundred Flowers Valley discreetly. After leaving the miasma, he soared into the air and flew away.</p><p>Before long, Qin Sang saw the vast blue ocean in the distance.</p><p>However, he didn't rush to leave but detoured to a nearby market town to buy another nautical chart.</p><p>The chart Lan Jingsi gave him was simple, mainly marking a route. Qin Sang naturally wouldn't obediently follow that path; he planned to chart his own course.</p><p>The meeting place was called Nine Commandments City, a strange name, the same as the island.</p><p>Qin Sang bought several charts claiming to be the most complete, but he found no detailed information about Nine Commandments Island.</p><p>He compared several charts, planned an initial route, and decided to refine it further once he entered the Boundless Sea. He left the Crescent Moon Realm that night.</p><p>The waters near the Crescent Moon Realm were still under the control of land-based forces.</p><p>Further ahead lay the true Boundless Sea!</p><p>He sped across the sea.</p><p>On the boundless ocean surface, he occasionally saw islands of varying sizes.</p><p>The familiar scenery evoked Qin Sang's memories of the Canglang Sea, inexplicably bringing a sense of familiarity.</p><p>He had cultivated in the Canglang Sea for over a hundred years and was used to this state of drifting at sea.</p><p>The various rumors about the Boundless Sea were daunting, but they were perhaps not much more dangerous than some of the perilous places in the Canglang Sea. Back then, he was only at the Golden Core stage, his self-preservation abilities far inferior to now.</p><p>Along the way, Qin Sang occasionally encountered cultivators. When he had the chance, he would stop to inquire about news and buy more detailed charts.</p><p>Gradually, Qin Sang formed a clear impression of the Boundless Sea.</p><p>Amid the chaos, there was another order.</p><p>The current core of the Boundless Sea was an island called Demon Mixing Island, and the surrounding waters, as called by the cultivators of the Boundless Sea.</p><p>The reason for its status as the core was simple: the master of Demon Mixing Island was a powerful cultivator—the Demon Mixing Elder!</p><p>Although the Demon Mixing Elder occupied Demon Mixing Island, he didn't restrict other forces from entering. On the contrary, he adopted a laissez-faire attitude and treated righteous, evil, human, and demonic cultivators equally.</p><p>Demon Mixing Island attracted countless forces, with a complex situation, yet it had its own rules.</p><p>As long as one didn't violate the Demon Mixing Elder's taboos, Demon Mixing Island was safer than other places.</p><p>However, the Demon Mixing Elder had no ambition to unify the Boundless Sea and ignored everything that happened outside Demon Mixing Island.</p><p>In the Boundless Sea, there were several places similar to Demon Mixing Island, but none as famous.</p><p>Nine Commandments Island was one of them.</p><p>Nine Commandments Island was located in the southern part of the Boundless Sea. After leaving the Crescent Moon Realm, Qin Sang headed straight southeast.</p><p>However, he deliberately detoured, making a large circle to a place called the Nine Stars Sea Area.</p><p>The Nine Stars Sea Area was the territory of a force in the Boundless Sea, the Nine Stars Assembly.</p><p>The Nine Stars Assembly consisted of nine trading houses active in the Boundless Sea, a kind of alliance, quite well-known in the Boundless Sea.</p><p>Trading houses were always the best informed, and that’s why Qin Sang came here to seek information.</p><p>Nine Stars City.</p><p>Qin Sang changed his appearance, disguised as an ordinary cultivator, and entered the premises of one of the trading houses.</p><p>He only showed his Golden Core cultivation and still received VIP treatment, with a steward personally greeting him.</p><p>“My surname is Luo, given name Chen.  May I ask your name, esteemed guest?”</p><p>Steward Luo enthusiastically led Qin Sang into a quiet room.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't introduce himself but got straight to the point. “I want to inquire about a few things.”</p><p>Luo, the attendant, saw that Qin Sang wasn't there to buy treasures, a flicker of disappointment crossed his eyes, but his enthusiasm didn't diminish.  "You've come to the right place, fellow cultivator!  Nothing related to the Boundless Sea escapes the notice of our Nine Stars Guild!"</p><p>"Don't be so sure,"</p><p>Qin Sang coldly snorted. "I ask you, has anything significant happened near Nine Restrictions Island recently?"</p><p>Luo, the attendant, paused, frowning. "That's too vague, fellow cultivator.  What do you mean...?"</p><p>"Something that would attract the attention of a Yuan Ying cultivator," Qin Sang emphasized, "Anything!"</p><p>"A Yuan Ying?"</p><p>A look of respect filled Luo's eyes. He carefully observed Qin Sang before cautiously replying, "That's beyond my purview. I'll immediately contact a Guild Elder, but..."</p><p>Qin Sang understood and tossed a pouch of spirit stones onto the table. "Is this enough?"</p><p>It was just to inquire about news, not investigate a secret; a payment in spirit stones was sufficient.</p><p>Luo, the attendant, his face beaming, said, "More than enough! Please wait a moment..."</p><p>"Wait!"</p><p>Qin Sang stopped the attendant, throwing another pouch. "Also, help me find out if a place called Jinghu exists."</p><p>Luo, the attendant, looked puzzled.  "Is that the name of an island, or...?"</p><p>Qin Sang shook her head. "Just Jinghu. It might be an ancient name, changed long ago."</p><p>Luo, the attendant, departed with a questioning look.</p><p>Qin Sang sat in the quiet room, closing her eyes to rest.</p><p>After a long time, Luo, the attendant, finally returned. "Fellow cultivator, I apologize for the wait! Jinghu is too broad a term; it required searching through many ancient texts, hence the delay."</p><p>Qin Sang's expression shifted. "You found something?"</p><p>Luo, the attendant, nodded. "I succeeded! Recently, everything around Nine Restrictions Island has been normal, no major incidents. Of course, it's possible something was deliberately concealed and not widely known. As for Jinghu, I had people search ancient texts, and we did find a place called Jinghu.  Times change, and much has been altered. Jinghu no longer exists by that name. After careful comparison, we can only confirm that Jinghu should be located in what is now the Kongling Sea area."</p><p>--</p><p>--</p><p>I found a plot hole in the outline and spent the whole night agonizing over it, pulling my hair out. I finally squeezed out one chapter in the middle of the night, but another chapter remains unfinished. I'll have to straighten things out before continuing.</p>
