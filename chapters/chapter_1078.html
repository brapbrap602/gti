<h1>Chapter 1070: All Appear</h1><p>Mou Laomo materialized behind the old man, launching a ruthless attack.  A fire lotus, formed from condensed Winter Nether Cold Flame, hurtled forward.  Over the years, while recuperating, he had also been refining the Winter Nether Cold Flame and had finally subdued this spirit fire. The fire lotus, formed from the Winter Nether Cold Flame, shimmered with blue flames, lacking any dramatic fanfare.  In reality, the fire lotus wasn't fully bloomed but rather a closed bud, though the outlines of the petals were visible.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The ethereal fire lotus, imbued with the purest essence of the cold flame, shot forward.  The old man's attention was entirely focused on the Demon Subduing Tablet.  His protective aura was pierced by the fire lotus as if it were nothing, and the terrifying chill nearly froze him solid.</p><p>In the nick of time, the old man frantically channeled his true essence towards his back, activating his protective magic treasure, but to little avail.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The fire lotus exploded.</p><p>Blue flames surged forward like a colossal python, slamming into the old man.  With a scream, a gaping wound appeared on his back, leaving him grievously injured. The Demon Subduing Tablet immediately spiralled out of his control.</p><p>…</p><p>The Ancient Devil, forced back by the combined efforts of the Demonic Lord and the Western幽 Alliance Leader, displayed no panic. Instead, a cold smile played on his lips.  Unbeknownst to them, the Demon Subduing Tablet was a supreme treasure specifically crafted by cultivators to suppress ancient devils. He couldn't control it, and forcibly using it would only result in backlash.  His attempt to seize the tablet was a mere feint, meant to distract the old man and the others.</p><p>However, events didn't unfold as the Ancient Devil had anticipated.  The individual who ambushed the Four Sages' descendant and attempted to seize the Demon Subduing Tablet wasn't the one he had expected.  Upon seeing Mou Laomo, the Ancient Devil's expression shifted instantly. The agent he had arranged hadn't appeared!</p><p>The Demonic Lord's actions in vying for the tablet further surprised the Ancient Devil. Seeing the situation as it was, he acted decisively, turning to attack the Western幽 Alliance Leader.</p><p>…</p><p>A smile spread across the Demonic Lord’s face as he channeled his true essence, enveloping the Demon Subduing Tablet, intending to claim the treasure.</p><p>Just then, another unexpected event occurred.</p><p>Beside the Demon Subduing Tablet, a figure materialized without warning.  The newcomer, holding a horsetail whisk, possessed a celestial air.  He looked at the Demonic Lord with a smile, his eyes filled with smugness and mockery.  It was Ling Zhuzi, who had tracked them here.</p><p>“I wouldn’t have thought you’d have the audacity to covet the Four Sages' legacy. This humble Daoist will gladly accept it…”</p><p>Ling Zhuzi burst into laughter.</p><p>The Demonic Lord's smile froze, and a furious roar erupted from him, “Ling Zhuzi! You dare!”</p><p>“Why wouldn't I?”</p><p>Ling Zhuzi retorted, flicking his horsetail whisk towards the Demon Subduing Tablet, beating the Demonic Lord to it.</p><p>Enraged, the Demonic Lord transformed his true essence into a blade, slashing fiercely at Ling Zhuzi while simultaneously accelerating towards the Demon Subduing Tablet.</p><p>…</p><p>High above.</p><p>Mou Laomo, having ambushed the old man, saw that he was severely injured but still alive.  He flashed behind him, condensing more cold flame, ready to finish him off without giving him a chance to recover.</p><p>At that moment, catching sight of the scene below from the corner of his eye, he paused.  The condition for the Demonic Lord's protection of Mou Laomo was that after the Ancient Devil appeared and forced out the descendant of the Four Sages, Mou Laomo would launch a sneak attack to help the Demonic Lord seize the treasure. Now, the plan had proceeded smoothly, but a snag had appeared at the last moment.  Someone else was lurking in the shadows, competing with the Demonic Lord for the treasure.  The newcomer was someone Mou Laomo deeply hated: Ling Zhuzi, the Sect Leader of the Heavenly Dao Sect!</p><p>Ling Zhuzi was his arch-enemy. If Ling Zhuzi obtained the treasure, he would never see the light of day again unless he broke through to the Late Nascent Soul stage.  About to retract the fire lotus and force back Ling Zhuzi, Mou Laomo suddenly felt something was amiss.  Was Ling Zhuzi’s presence at Mount Yitian a coincidence, or was it premeditated?  If it was the latter, he likely wasn't alone.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>Mou Laomo cried out inwardly.</p><p>Just as this thought crossed his mind, he felt a sharp gust of wind from behind, an incredibly sharp aura that made his hair stand on end. It was a classic case of the mantis stalking the cicada, unaware of the oriole behind.</p><p>Behind Mou Laomo, a slender figure emerged from the void, her gaze sharp. It was Lady Li.</p><p>With a flick of her jade finger, a phoenix hairpin shot out like a true phoenix, tearing through the void, aimed directly at Mou Laomo's vital point on his back.  The same tactic, the same location.</p><p>Mou Laomo's injuries hadn't healed, and he had already launched the fire lotus. He hadn't expected someone to be watching him from the shadows. Sensing the aura of the phoenix hairpin, Mou Laomo knew he couldn't defend against it. With a cry, he lunged forward.</p><p>…</p><p>High in the sky and down in the mountain valley, the battle was split into two, both reaching a critical juncture.</p><p>“Senior Brother!”</p><p>A mournful cry suddenly echoed from above.</p><p>Warned by the bell, the old woman rushed over without pause, only to witness the Demonic Lord and Ling Zhuzi fighting over the Demon Subduing Tablet, and her senior brother, severely injured and dying, having been ambushed by Mou Laomo.</p><p>“You’re courting death!”</p><p>The old woman roared in fury, pressing her palm against her forehead with a muffled groan.  Her aura surged dramatically.  Using some unknown secret technique, her cultivation, originally similar to the three alliance leaders, at the peak of Mid-Nascent Soul, instantly crossed the threshold, rivaling that of the Demonic Lord and Ling Zhuzi.</p><p>Simultaneously, the Demon Subduing Tablet flickered, suddenly erupting with immense power, repelling the horsetail whisk and rising from the ground.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>Azure light exploded like a tidal wave.</p><p>The old woman plummeted, manipulating the Demon Subduing Tablet. Azure light surged, her only goal to save the dying old man, making Mou Laomo the first to bear the brunt of her attack.</p><p>No one had expected another uninvited guest to join the fray at this moment.  Ling Zhuzi and the Demonic Lord, locked in their struggle, could only watch helplessly as the treasure flew away.</p><p>Mou Laomo suffered the most.  Misfortunes never come singly. In a split second, before he could react, he was caught in a pincer attack, trapped with no escape.  The Demon Subduing Tablet, wielded by the old woman, possessed power unlike before.  Mou Laomo, already using all his remaining strength to fend off the phoenix hairpin, turned deathly pale.</p><p>“Save me!”</p><p>A cry for help came from the Western幽 Alliance Leader in the mountain valley.  The Ancient Devil, abandoning the Demon Subduing Tablet, had attacked her, putting her in mortal danger.  Originally, the plan was for the Demonic Lord to seize the tablet and, with Mou Laomo, besiege the Ancient Devil, stabilizing the situation.  But unexpected events had unfolded, leaving her alone to face the Ancient Devil and his demonic attendant.</p><p>The Demonic Lord was also in a dilemma, caught between saving Mou Laomo or the Western幽 Alliance Leader.  Seeing the terrifying power of the Demon Subduing Tablet, he gritted his teeth and turned to rescue the Western幽 Alliance Leader.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>‘Splat!’</p><p>Blood sprayed across the sky.  Mou Laomo's body contorted grotesquely, a gaping hole torn through him.  His nascent soul failed to escape, and he was reduced to a mangled mess, plummeting down the cliff, dead on the spot.</p><p>Lady Li, sensing the might of the Demon Subduing Tablet, paled and retreated hastily. Still, she was struck by the residual force, coughing up blood and tumbling backward.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The old woman descended, cradling the old man in her arms, shielding him with the Demon Subduing Tablet as she glared coldly at the others.</p><p>Ling Zhuzi, seeing that the situation was hopeless, sighed softly, retracted his horsetail whisk, and flashed to Lady Li's side.</p><p>Lady Li, her face ashen, glanced at her now significantly weakened phoenix hairpin with heartache.  She nodded at Ling Zhuzi, wiped the blood from her lips, swallowed a healing pill, and sat down cross-legged to begin her recovery.</p>
