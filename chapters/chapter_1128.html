<h1>Chapter 1120: Double Tribulation</h1><p>Chapter 1120: Double Tribulation</p><p>The gale raged on relentlessly.</p><p>A thick wall of wind almost completely obscured the glow of the spirit formation.</p><p>Just as Qin Sang was feeling uneasy, Bai hurried over from the other side, his eyes serious as he pointed to the sky.  "The heavenly tribulation... something's wrong."</p><p>Li Yu Fu also flew over, his face full of panic.</p><p>"Master Uncle, why is Grandmaster still unable to overcome the wind tribulation?"</p><p>Following Bai's gaze, they stared at the center of the dark clouds above.</p><p>At this moment, the clouds were densely packed with thunder, countless arcs flickering, each as thick as a man's arm. The lightning transformed the clouds into a storm cloud, rapidly evolving into a tribulation cloud!</p><p>劫雷 (jie lei) are heavenly tribulation thunderbolts, entirely different from ordinary lightning, which is why cultivators fear them so much.</p><p>The electric lights intertwined, the thunderclouds growing larger.</p><p>Gradually, blue arcs appeared within the thunderclouds. At first, they were as thin as needles, almost unnoticeable. But soon, even the thick lightning bolts began to transform into blue.</p><p>"Blue tribulation lightning!"</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes narrowed slightly.</p><p>For cultivators undergoing tribulation, the tribulation lightning of the thunder tribulation is blue!</p><p>Looking at the blue tribulation lightning from afar, Qin Sang felt a sudden pang of fear, sensing a terrifying aura of destruction, along with a hint of the might of Heaven, sending chills down his spine.</p><p>He had practiced the *Lightning Control Technique*, been struck by lightning countless times, but he had never felt such terror.</p><p>Without a doubt, if anyone dared to practice the *Lightning Control Technique* and draw tribulation lightning into their body at this moment, the result would be annihilation.</p><p>The *Lightning Control Technique* is also incapable of manipulating tribulation lightning.</p><p>However, Bai wasn't pointing at the blue tribulation lightning.</p><p>"Huh? What's that golden light?"</p><p>Qin Sang finally noticed a small, bead-sized golden light deep within the tribulation cloud. It was tiny, but incredibly conspicuous against the blue tribulation cloud.</p><p>At this time, the gale surrounding Yun Youzi began to subside.</p><p>The tribulation cloud fully formed.</p><p>Those undergoing tribulation, after passing the wind tribulation, only have a short respite before facing the thunder tribulation.</p><p>What was shocking was that the tribulation cloud wasn't purely blue!</p><p>That golden light grew larger, eventually dyeing half the tribulation cloud gold!</p><p>"Two-colored tribulation cloud!"</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang's face changed drastically, and he exclaimed in disbelief.</p><p>He quickly turned to Bai, but Bai was staring intently at the tribulation cloud, his brow furrowed in silence.</p><p>Before this, Qin Sang had never heard of a two-colored tribulation cloud.</p><p>A cultivator's Nascent Soul tribulation should only involve blue heavenly thunder. Yun Youzi is also a cultivator, so why did a two-colored tribulation cloud appear during his tribulation?</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>A tremendous roar shook the heavens and earth.</p><p>The tribulation cloud churned violently.</p><p>The two-colored tribulation cloud was clearly distinct, with blue and gold arcs dancing within, the surrounding dark clouds, enduring the terrifying heavenly might, being torn apart.</p><p>The world brightened somewhat, but Qin Sang's face was filled with gloom, a sudden ominous feeling washing over him.</p><p>'Rumble…'</p><p>A terrifying sight unfolded: two-colored tribulation lightning was brewing simultaneously within the two-colored tribulation cloud.</p><p>Seeing this, everyone was horrified.</p><p>'Crack!'</p><p>The heavens trembled.</p><p>Two lightning bolts, like sharp swords, flashed down from the tribulation cloud, simultaneously striking the light screen formed by the spirit formation.</p><p>Qin Sang and the others were blinded by the intense blue and gold light, unable to see the tribulation lightning's form.</p><p>The moment they struck the formation, the two bolts of lightning almost merged, their power surging to a terrifying degree, far exceeding that of ordinary tribulation lightning!</p><p>The light screen suddenly dimmed.</p><p>The various phantoms dancing and swirling within instantly exploded.</p><p>Several spirit mirrors supporting the formation were shattered, and spirit flags snapped.</p><p>The tribulation lightning passed through the light screen, weakened by the spirit formation.</p><p>But this was just the beginning.  With the first thunderbolt, deafening thunder filled the space, and more two-colored tribulation lightning bolts shot down from the cloud.</p><p>The lightning mainly targeted Yun Youzi, but the island was also affected. Already small, its rocks turned to dust under the tribulation lightning, even a lone peak was shaved down.</p><p>Wave after wave of tribulation lightning struck, the spirit formation struggling to defend, scattered threads of lightning piercing through, only to be stopped by a silvery white orb.</p><p>It was Yun Youzi's treasure, the Immaculate Pearl.</p><p>But the respite was short-lived.</p><p>After a brief pause, the tribulation lightning descended again, even more powerful.</p><p>"Excellent!"</p><p>Yun Youzi's silver hair flew wildly, his appearance frenzied, as he roared at the sky.</p><p>He hastily swallowed pills and summoned several magical treasures.</p><p>The tribulation lightning's power became even more terrifying. Under the onslaught of the thick bolts, the spirit formation's glow dimmed, and one after another, the formation's instruments were destroyed; it was at the end of its strength.</p><p>This protective array, meant for the entire tribulation, was destroyed so quickly!</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The array and the tribulation vanished in a flash.</p><p>From afar, Qin Sang, using his Heaven's Eye ability to its fullest, could only see blue and gold lightning, unable to discern Yun Youzi's condition.  Even the Heaven's Eye butterflies felt discomfort from the intensity of the tribulation lightning.</p><p>Seeing the array's light extinguish, all hope left Qin Sang.</p><p>His face was ashen, as he looked up at the thunderclouds.</p><p>The clouds swirled restlessly, seemingly brimming with endless power.</p><p>‘Boom! Boom!’</p><p>Lightning bolts struck repeatedly.</p><p>Despair washed over Qin Sang.  Even if he were in Yun Youzi's place, he couldn't have survived such terrifying lightning.</p><p>But, surprisingly, Yun Youzi was still alive, enduring wave after wave of lightning!</p><p>Hope flickered in Qin Sang's heart. He clenched his fists, frustrated by his inability to help.</p><p>Finally, the thunderclouds began to shrink.</p><p>Li Yu Fu rejoiced, but his joy quickly turned to terror.</p><p>Just as the tribulation seemed to be ending, the two-colored clouds underwent another transformation, merging together. Blue and gold arcs intertwined, finally becoming one.</p><p>Qin Sang's heart plummeted.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The final thunderbolt descended.</p><p>The fused blue and gold lightning, a colossal bolt like a sky-piercing sword, tore from the clouds, carrying an aura of extreme fury and heavenly might, striking the solitary peak.</p><p>Even from this distance, they felt the terrifying power of the bolt, trembling in fear.</p><p>It was unimaginable what kind of destructive force Yun Youzi, facing the tribulation head-on, was enduring.</p><p>“Grandmaster!”</p><p>Li Yu Fu cried out, his face filled with grief.</p><p>Qin Sang pressed his lips together, his lips devoid of color.</p><p>He hadn't anticipated this at all.</p><p>Yun Youzi had made such extensive preparations; nothing should have gone wrong.  Yet the tribulation's power far exceeded that faced by other cultivators, unlike any typical Nascent Soul tribulation.</p><p>Such a terrifying tribulation; Yun Youzi had endured it for so long.  If it were a normal tribulation, he would have already passed it.</p><p>Why?</p><p>Yun Youzi had entrusted Li Yu Fu to Qin Sang earlier, not just as a precaution.  Had he sensed something then?</p><p>Suddenly, Qin Sang remembered something Yun Youzi said at the Purple Micro Palace: "I have two great tribulations in my life; all else is insignificant.  Forming a Nascent Soul is a mere trifle for me!"</p><p>The first tribulation was the rebirth from incomplete spirit and soul.</p><p>The second... was this Nascent Soul tribulation!</p>
