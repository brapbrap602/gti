<h1>Chapter 2058  The Sun Wheel Sweeps the Heavens</h1><p>A single strike of the Reverse Five Elements Divine Light pierced Que Li's chest.  Even the clan's secret silver scales couldn't withstand it; the power was beyond her comprehension. She could clearly feel a destructive force spreading through her body, her life force rapidly draining away.  Her eyes widened in disbelief.</p><p>However, the silver scales did manage to deflect some of the power, providing a degree of cushioning. The destructive force didn't fully erupt, giving Que Li a moment to breathe.  Knowing a storm of attacks would surely follow, leaving her no chance to suppress the destructive force, she made an immediate decision. The silver scales on her neck glowed, suddenly acting like a blade as she severed her own head!</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>Que Li's head separated from her body, flying off on its own.  The scales on her torso immediately vanished, completely losing their defensive ability. Under the onslaught of the Five Elements Divine Light's destructive force, her body instantly turned to ashes.</p><p>The small figure in the distance saw this, a chill running down his spine. His own true form had just been destroyed; it was fortunate the divine light hadn't targeted him, otherwise, he would have had no chance of survival. He had to admit that both he and Que Li had been overconfident, treating their opponent as an ordinary cultivator of the same realm, giving their opponent the opportunity to defeat them one by one.</p><p>Their opponent hadn't necessarily displayed their full strength.  While seemingly at the early stage of the Void Refinement realm, treating them as a powerful late-stage Void Refinement cultivator wouldn't be an exaggeration. Had they known this, they would have been far more cautious, and wouldn't have ended up like this.</p><p>Seeing Que Li hadn't perished immediately, but was still struggling, a hint of hesitation flickered in the small figure's eyes.  He steeled his resolve, his figure pausing, as he silently chanted an incantation and sent out a subtle wave of energy.</p><p>Only by saving Que Li, and combining the powers of their two clans, did they have any hope of survival!</p><p>Que Li's head was struggling to escape, her face covered in blood, looking extremely miserable.  Just then, she sensed a slight tremor in the void, realizing something, a glimmer of hope appeared in her eyes.</p><p>Immediately, an invisible vortex appeared in the void, its destination unknown, drawing Que Li's head inside, causing it to vanish.</p><p>The next moment, an identical vortex appeared before the small figure. A shadowy form emerged – Que Li's head.</p><p>The small figure, exhausted from performing this secret technique, urgently transmitted a few words. Que Li abruptly opened her eyes, her mouth opening to swallow the small figure, then turning into a silver light and fleeing far away.</p><p>Qin Sang watched all this, secretly marvelling at the extraordinary abilities of the Yi Ren Clan.  This woman, having abandoned her body, was left with only her head, yet her life force hadn't been significantly depleted. New flesh was already sprouting from her neck; given time, she would undoubtedly regrow a new body.</p><p>Their combined abilities made them difficult to eliminate. If no one interfered, if he pursued them, he would have a good chance of killing them both.</p><p>However, a stone stele descended from the heavens, smashing towards Qin Sang, bringing with it an astonishing pressure.  He had already risked his life earlier, forcibly using the Five Elements Crown while bearing the stele's weight.</p><p>This stele weighed more than a mountain, seemingly about to crush the entire world. But Qin Sang made an unexpected discovery: the stele didn't seem real, but a phantom.</p><p>Surprised, Qin Sang immediately realized that Quan Lao, far away, didn't have the ability to teleport the treasure.  This stele was likely conjured using some kind of divine ability.</p><p>The stele must have a real counterpart, and the true treasure's power must be incredibly formidable. Though this was only a phantom stele, the pressure Qin Sang felt was utterly real, impacting both his physical body and Dharma body simultaneously.</p><p>The stele's power encompassed the entire void, enveloping both his Dharma body and physical body.  Moreover, both his Dharma body and physical body felt as though the stele was targeting them individually – a very strange sensation.</p><p>His vision was filled with only the stele.  The patterns on the stele's surface seemed to come alive, like tentacles pulling him into the darkness of the unknown.  A sinister black tide surged in from all directions.</p><p>The danger wasn't limited to this. Qin Sang felt a familiar sensation, reminiscent of his encounter with Island Master Meng. That feeling of being trapped, of the other party controlling heaven and earth, of being a caged beast – he still remembered it vividly.</p><p>The Void Refinement realm – controlling heaven and earth.</p><p>Lower-realm cultivators facing a Void Refinement cultivator are like prisoners in a heavenly jail, with little power to resist; they can only surrender. The higher the realm, the stronger the control over heaven and earth. A feeling like this is unsurprising for an early-stage Void Refinement cultivator facing a late-stage one.</p><p>Qin Sang, having obtained Tian Yue Shang Ren's sword light and spent years studying the Sword Domain, also had his own understanding of the Law Domain, something only those in the Unity Transformation realm could comprehend.</p><p>In his view, reaching the Unity Realm wasn't simply about controlling the heavens and earth.  Once the Dharma Realm unfolded, all power within its reach would become his own.  Even more, all power would become the power he desired, including his enemies'!</p><p>Within the Dharma Realm, he would be the sovereign, everything operating according to his will.  If the Dharma Realm were likened to a small world, he would be its Celestial Emperor!</p><p>Qin Sang had only touched the surface of the Sword Realm, so his understanding was naturally shallow, but it allowed him to deduce the immense power of Unity cultivators.</p><p>Late-stage Void Refinement cultivators were gradually approaching this level, not far from creating their own Dharma Realm.</p><p>This person might have already grasped a hint of its mystery.</p><p>The stele was not merely an attack; it was a channel. The opponent used it to project their will, pressing down not as a stele, but as a whole world!</p><p>Void Refinement cultivators could contend for the power of heaven and earth with their enemies, and wouldn't be completely helpless.  But a typical early-stage Void Refinement cultivator would likely be overwhelmed.</p><p>If they couldn't break free in time and were captured by the stele, once the opponent arrived in person, escape would be impossible.</p><p>But Qin Sang couldn't be judged by ordinary standards. He was on the verge of mid-stage Void Refinement, and having comprehended the Sword Realm early on, his perspective surpassed others'.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't determine how far the opponent had progressed, but he was certain they hadn't grasped a Dharma Realm, not even a rudimentary one. Therefore, he saw a flaw in their approach.</p><p>However, even noticing a flaw required sufficient strength to exploit it; otherwise, the fate of being suppressed by the stele remained unchanged.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression was solemn, and he instantly made a decision.</p><p>He didn't look at the stele; his physical body remained where it was. He silently cultivated his profound arts, forming a hand seal, the seal instantly complete.</p><p>The seal Qin Sang used was the Sun Wheel Seal, one of the Nine Great Luminous Seals!</p><p>The Sun Wheel Seal could gather the power of his Dharma Body and Dharma Image, transforming into a golden sun and unleashing a simultaneous burst of power—his currently strongest technique.</p><p>Since breaking through to Void Refinement, Qin Sang hadn't encountered an enemy capable of forcing him to use the Sun Wheel Seal. Facing the pressure of a late-stage Void Refinement expert, he had no choice but to use it.</p><p>In that moment, the Dharma Image power within him rapidly dissipated, his Dharma Body remaining motionless, instantly appearing somewhat illusory.</p><p>Simultaneously, vast golden light swept across the sky, dazzling and surging; the heavens and the sea were dyed a brilliant gold.</p><p>A great sun appeared in the sky, the golden wheel suspended high.</p><p>Qin Sang stood beneath the golden wheel, as if clad in golden robes, instantly sweeping away the black tide.</p><p>The stele's descent slowed abruptly. Its surface glittered with gold, as if plated with gold leaf, or as if held aloft by a powerful force, preventing it from falling further.</p><p>The golden light intensified, like countless golden needles. Under its illumination, the stele began to shake violently.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>…</p><p>Each tremor produced terrifying waves, churning the sea into chaos, causing islands to collapse.</p><p>'Crack!'</p><p>Finally, a corner of the stele shattered.</p><p>Cracks appeared, and in the blink of an eye, the stele disintegrated into several fragments, instantly vanishing into nothingness.</p><p>With the stele's destruction, Quan Lao's will was completely expelled. Qin Sang felt a lightness wash over him as control over heaven and earth returned, the pressure lifting completely.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes flickered as he sensed the power within him. He had been a Void Refinement cultivator for many years.  Now, using the Sun Wheel Seal, he wouldn't be drained like he was in the Divine Court.</p><p>With his precise control, the Sun Wheel Seal barely destroyed the stele, and his internal energy wasn't completely depleted.</p><p>His gaze shifted, looking towards the horizon.</p><p>The moment the stele was destroyed, Quan Lao felt a recoil, realizing his divine ability had been broken.  His expression turned extremely grave.</p><p>Ji Qiong and Que Li had both failed. He had anticipated this, but hadn't expected Qin Sang to deal with it so easily.</p><p>His anger vanished, for in his eyes, Qin Sang was no longer a mere schemer, but a formidable opponent worthy of respect!</p><p>In the distant void, their eyes met.</p><p>Quan Lao's fighting spirit surged, and he charged across the waves, swift as thunder.</p><p>A slight smile touched Qin Sang's lips.  He had sensed that Su Nu and the Syu-race person were safe, and he could retreat.</p><p>Glancing at Ji Qiong and Que Li fleeing, Qin Sang decided against pursuit.  Even if he could kill them, the late-stage expert would soon arrive.</p><p>Crippling their opponents without killing them would be more advantageous.  Qin Sang felt the surge of battle intent, but now was not the time; he wouldn't engage in pointless conflict.</p><p>Having made his decision, Qin Sang merged with his Dharma body, let out a hearty laugh, and declared, "Until next time!"  He then violently flapped his phoenix wings, secretly urging the Azure Luan True Thunder, transforming into a bolt of azure lightning that pierced the sky and vanished.</p><p>By the time Elder Quan arrived, he could only see a faint azure glow on the horizon.  He stood suspended above the sea, not pursuing, but gazing silently at the distant sky.</p><p>Only then did Ji Qiong and Que Li dare to return, nervously saying, "We were no match for them; they escaped with the young master of the Siyou clan.  We beg Elder Quan's punishment."</p><p>They had barely escaped with their lives; one was now a strange little person, the other only a head, a truly pitiful sight.</p><p>Elder Quan did not punish them. He had witnessed the enemy's strength firsthand; the two hadn't been slacking, they were simply outmatched.</p><p>Relieved that Elder Quan had let the matter go, Ji Qiong angrily said, "That person dared to interfere in our clan's internal affairs! Once we discover their identity, they will pay!"</p><p>"Person? Do you think they are human?" Elder Quan suddenly asked.</p><p>Ji Qiong was startled.</p><p>Que Li pondered, "That person possesses a Dharma body, and their skills, especially their swordsmanship, are extremely refined, like a human sword cultivator. But I sensed a similar Dharma image aura from them, and the demonic energy that erupted later was exceptionally pure.  And those phoenix wings... likely have connections to the demon race."</p><p>"What nonsense, could it be a half-demon?"</p><p>Ji Qiong frowned, suddenly remembering something.  He looked at Elder Quan, "The Heavenly Department and the East Sea aquatic races have been secretly collaborating. Could they have commissioned a demon race expert to capture the Siyou clan's young master?"</p><p>Elder Quan remained noncommittal.</p><p>At that moment, streaks of escaping light flew nearby – their clansmen who had been setting up the formation.  These expert 異人族 warriors, witnessing the battle, not only had their target stolen but also saw two clan elders crippled.  Terrified, they feared incurring punishment and stood cautiously aside.</p><p>Soon, ripples appeared on the horizon; Ji Liang was leading his forces to arrive, still unaware of the setback.</p><p>Elder Quan and the others carefully searched the area again, but found no trace of Su Nu and the Siyou clan's young master, and had to give up.</p><p>"Retreat!"</p><p>Elder Quan gazed deeply at the direction Qin Sang had fled, then clouds formed beneath his feet, lifting everyone into the air. They flew away.</p><p>The battle had been far more intense than expected. The array concealing the spiritual energy was insufficient; the Haitang Academy must be on its way. They couldn't stay here.</p><p>…</p><p>Qin Sang flew for some time, sensing no pursuers, knowing the 異人族 had given up.  He found a small island reef, concealed his aura, and fled towards the open sea.</p><p>Su Nu had a good plan, and they hadn't exposed their aura, so escaping wouldn't be difficult. The only concern was that Qin Sang might be targeted by Haitang Academy. He would avoid them if possible.  If he could escape Haitang Academy's territory, this mission would be a resounding success.</p><p>There were no rumors of Haitang Academy deploying Nascent Soul cultivators, but that didn't mean they wouldn't. Unless it was a matter of life or death, such a small matter shouldn't alarm them.</p><p>During his flight, Qin Sang sensed a change in the atmosphere; Haitang Academy was likely searching for them.  He proceeded cautiously, avoiding detection, but as he neared the open sea, he felt not relief, but urgency.  Mysterious auras swept over him, forcing him to dodge.</p><p>Haitang Academy must have deployed some detection method.  Qin Sang's limitations increased, and his room to maneuver was shrinking.</p><p>Finally, Qin Sang felt he was about to be exposed, but the open sea was close.  He stopped hiding and immediately transformed into lightning, fleeing.</p><p>Soon, Qin Sang felt pressure closing in, attempting to form a formation to trap him, but his speed was too great. Before they could encircle him, he had escaped Haitang Academy's territory. The constraints vanished instantly, and he was free!</p><p>On the edge of the Haitang Academy's waters, shortly after Qin Sang's departure, a scholar appeared.</p><p>Moments later, another person materialized beside him.</p><p>"That person got away?"</p><p>The scholar sighed, "That person's escape techniques are truly remarkable."</p><p>"Someone who could snatch prey from the jaws of those 異人 is expected to possess such ability," the other person said indifferently.</p><p>"What did Pavilion Master Zhao say?" the scholar asked.</p><p>"It's been cleared up; only a few islands were lost. We were merely collateral damage, and those 異人 are willing to compensate."</p><p>The scholar nodded, seemingly understanding.</p><p>Then, the two figures gradually disappeared.</p>
