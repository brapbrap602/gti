<h1>Chapter 1941: The Peerless Fiend</h1><p>Yu Cheng Huang and the two judges were about to question, but upon hearing that three Star Lords were leading troops in pursuit, their imposing demeanor vanished without a trace.  They naturally crossed the threshold and entered the teahouse.</p><p>The ghost soldiers under the nine spirit banners, along with other officials, followed suit, crowding into the teahouse.</p><p>The teahouse had limited seating, leaving most of the spirits standing.</p><p>The listeners were engrossed in the story, unaware that the empty seats were filled with spirits, some even standing beside them.</p><p>The winter days were short; dusk descended quickly.  By the time the hour of You arrived , it was almost dark, but the streets were brightly lit, even more lively than during the day.</p><p>‘啪!’</p><p>The storyteller struck the sounding block forcefully, raising his voice:  “This is how the celestial maiden's infatuation caused calamity, and the blue bird's confusion brought disaster. To find out what happened next, please listen to the next episode!”</p><p>“Ah! It’s over again!”</p><p>“We have to wait until tomorrow!”</p><p>“Ending it here every day, it’s simply unbearable!”</p><p>…</p><p>The audience awoke as from a dream.</p><p>Sparse applause rippled through the teahouse, but more were complaints, with some even begging the storyteller for another segment.</p><p>“I'm sorry, everyone. It's getting late; come again tomorrow.”</p><p>The storyteller, his heart as hard as iron, took a sip of his tea, packed up his things, and went into the back room.</p><p>The tea patrons, unable to do anything, could only sigh and leave.</p><p>“Take care!”</p><p>“Have a good night!”</p><p>…</p><p>The tea server, having held his tongue all day, finally dared to speak. After seeing the tea patrons off, he noticed a young girl still sitting there.</p><p>“Miss, haven't you had enough? The master will be here again at the hour of Si tomorrow .  Come back tomorrow, and I'll save you a good seat.”</p><p>Unlike the other patrons, the girl was truly waking up from a dream.</p><p>It was an incredibly vivid dream; she had experienced everything the celestial maiden had, vividly.</p><p>However, the girl didn't realize anything was amiss, only feeling unsatisfied.  She stretched, “Where's a nearby inn?”</p><p>“You're not a local?”</p><p>The tea server thought to himself, *The master's charm truly is extraordinary, even drawing someone to stay overnight just to listen to his stories.*</p><p>The girl’s appearance and demeanor clearly indicated she was from a wealthy family. The tea server pointed east, “The Drunk Fragrance Tower next to the City God Temple also has rooms, but they don't have many, and I don't know if there are any vacancies. A few places next to the Drunk Fragrance Tower are slightly inferior, but they are clean. Choose whichever you like.”</p><p>Meanwhile, the spirits began to leave the teahouse.</p><p>Including Yu Cheng Huang, none of them noticed anything strange about this, and they even forgot to investigate the girl. They left discussing the story.</p><p>Two Yin officers on patrol saw their colleagues coming out of the teahouse. They greeted them and asked, “Did you catch the troublemakers?  Lord Wu even used the mountain-suppressing spirit banner. Why haven’t we heard anything?”</p><p>“Amazing! Absolutely fantastic!”</p><p>A colleague suddenly slapped his thigh.</p><p>The two Yin officers were startled by their colleague’s reaction, stunned for a moment.  “What's amazing? What about the storyteller? Where did he go? Was he executed on the spot by Lord Cheng Huang?”</p><p>“Storyteller? He’ll be here again tomorrow at the hour of You. I have to remember the time; I mustn't miss it,” the colleague muttered, avoiding the question, and excitedly continued their discussion.</p><p>In the story, the heavenly soldiers and generals were opposed to the celestial maiden.</p><p>Their stance was diametrically opposed to the girl who sympathized with the celestial maiden; they all agreed that heavenly law was unforgiving.</p><p>Confused, the two Yin officers went to other colleagues, only to encounter similar reactions.</p><p>Looking at their entranced colleagues, the two Yin officers exchanged a glance, a sudden feeling of dread washing over them.</p><p>They stood there for a while, not daring to return to the office directly. They went to the city gate and reported their findings to the guarding ghost soldiers.</p><p>By now, there were few spirits left in the county who hadn’t been to the teahouse.</p><p>“Did you see Lord Cheng Huang having the same reaction?”</p><p>The guarding ghost soldiers asked the two Yin officers.</p><p>“By the time we arrived, the officials had already gone to the yamen. We didn't dare follow. Should we send someone in to check?” the Yin officers whispered.</p><p>They looked at each other, and no one answered.</p><p>“Let’s go together; leave one behind.  If we're all wiped out, at least someone can report back. Let’s draw straws,” one of the Yin officers acted swiftly, grabbing a few straws and marking them, holding half in his hand.</p><p>Eventually, one ghost soldier drew the best straw and watched his companions leave.</p><p>The other spirits returned to the City God Temple, looking at the building that symbolized divine power and the boundary between Yin and Yang.  In the past, this was their strongest support; now it had become a monstrous flood.</p><p>Their expressions grim, the spirits entered the yamen and tiptoed toward the City God's main hall.</p><p>“No one inside…”</p><p>They checked the other offices.</p><p>“The officials of each department are not here…”</p><p>They gathered together, exchanging bewildered looks. Lord Cheng Huang and the Wen Judge were the most diligent officials; at this time they would certainly be in the main hall attending to official duties.</p><p>"Hmph, could it be...?"</p><p>A yīnchai gasped, his mouth quickly covered by a colleague.</p><p>"Shh!"</p><p>The ghosts and gods quietly slipped out of the City God Temple, returned to the city gate, and gathered together, their faces filled with worry.</p><p>"What's the storyteller's background? Did anyone pay attention?" a yīnchai broke the silence.</p><p>Everyone shook their heads.</p><p>"I say," said the ghost soldier who had been on guard, looking around, "maybe we're overthinking this? If the storyteller really has such great power, even the City God fell for it, how could you several return unharmed?"</p><p>"Yeah, why did he only spare us?" the yīnchai said, bewildered.</p><p>"I went out of the city just now, all the way to Nine Sons Mountain, and no one stopped me," the ghost soldier continued, "unless he deliberately let us go to spread the word."</p><p>"Old Wang and the others didn't have any external injuries, and there were no signs of a fight in the teahouse…"</p><p>The two yīnchai who had first discovered the situation now also hesitated.</p><p>"If the storyteller really is that powerful, it means he deliberately let us go. No matter what we do, the outcome won't change. We should report to the prefectural city, but we need to know what exactly happened. Otherwise, what can we say? Maybe we're overthinking it. Let's see what happens tomorrow morning."</p><p>The ghosts and gods finally reached an agreement.</p><p>They dared not enter the city all night, spending it at the city gate.</p><p>The next day, at the time of the snake .</p><p>The storyteller arrived as promised.  A quarter of an hour earlier, the young woman had already prepared tea and snacks, and yesterday's ghosts and gods were all present.</p><p>"Last time, we spoke of the divine maiden's infatuation, the green bird's confusion, and the Celestial Mother's wrath…"</p><p>New Year's Eve.</p><p>The most lively day of the year, when human vitality is at its peak.</p><p>This atmosphere is extremely beneficial to the cultivation of ghosts and gods, but the yīnchai eavesdropping outside the teahouse felt a chill in their hearts, completely lacking the mood to cultivate.</p><p>From the teahouse came the storyteller's strong voice; otherwise, there was no other sound.</p><p>The ghosts and gods of Jian County, from the City God to the ghost soldiers, became his most attentive audience.</p><p>The yīnchai were a full three zhang away from the teahouse, dared not approach, and quietly retreated to the city gate.</p><p>Waiting at the city gate were not only the ghosts and gods from the previous night, but also all the mountain gods and land gods within the jurisdiction of Jian County.</p><p>Just from the yīnchai's description, the ghosts and gods felt a wave of cold dread rising from their hearts.</p><p>They looked back at Jian County city; their familiar city had become a dragon's pool and tiger's den.</p><p>The mortals, however, remained blissfully unaware, celebrating the New Year merrily, with the occasional sound of firecrackers.</p><p>Another yīnchai came out from the city.</p><p>"I checked. The storyteller spent the night at the Drunken Fragrance Tower, like a normal person, paying for his room and meals with silver.  There's only one unusual thing: he enjoys the Drunken Fragrance Feast every night."</p><p>Hearing this, the ghosts and gods' hearts stirred.</p><p>"Is he an old friend of the Drunken Fragrance Tower owner?"</p><p>It's common knowledge that the Drunken Fragrance Tower owner has a strange temperament. Even the City God doesn't get to enjoy the Drunken Fragrance Feast often, yet he prepares it for the storyteller every night.</p><p>"I… I didn't dare to use magic to inquire with the owner of the Drunken Fragrance Tower,  but it seems they've only known each other for a short while," the yīnchai hesitated.</p><p>Everyone knew what he was worried about; they wouldn't dare either.</p><p>"This is beyond our capabilities. Since he allowed us to spread the word, let's do as he wishes. It's a pity that several of our superiors have fallen prey, and we can't use magical items to send a message.  Someone must personally go to the prefectural city. When reporting, make sure to explain clearly. The other party is confident and arrogant, and even the prefectural city may find it difficult to handle."</p><p>The most respected ghost soldier looked around and noticed a land god's unusual expression.</p><p>"Brother Yue, do you know something?"</p><p>This person was the land god of the area where Qingyang Temple is located, named Yue Wenfu.</p><p>At that moment, he was thinking about yesterday's events.</p><p>The City God and the Wenpan had visited Qingyang Temple, given him instructions, and returned to the city before the incident occurred.</p><p>Could it just be a coincidence?</p><p>However, Yue Wenfu did not reveal anything.</p><p>Master Qingfeng, experienced in the mortal world and secluded in Qingyang Temple, certainly wouldn't want to be disturbed.  The City God and Wenpan had specifically instructed him.</p><p>Even if Master Qingfeng had nothing to do with this, asking for his help might save Jian County from this disaster.</p><p>"There is something, but I cannot say. I must return immediately, excuse me…"</p><p>Yue Wenfu hastily said and used earth-遁术 to escape.</p><p>Leaving the ghosts and gods looking at each other, they could only continue with their plan.</p><p>Yue Wenfu did not stop, hurrying back to Qibai Village, tidying his clothes at the foot of the mountain before walking up, showing his respect.</p><p>The sun was shining brightly, unlike yesterday's cold.</p><p>Even though it was New Year's Eve, there were still patients going up the mountain for medicine.</p><p>Entering the temple, Yue Wenfu saw Qin Sang taking the pulse of an old man, while Yulang and Xiaowu were tending a brazier in the main hall, warming themselves along with the other patients.</p><p>"Wenfu greets Master Dao."</p><p>Yue Wenfu approached Qin Sang respectfully, bowing deeply.  He started to speak, but Qin Sang only grunted and continued examining an elderly patient.</p><p>He suppressed his anxiety, watching Qin Sang explain the diagnosis slowly and clearly, then write the prescription, dispense the medicine, explain the precautions and dosage, pick up her pen, lick the ink, record the payment, and finally receive the patient's profuse thanks.  Before Yue Wenfu could speak, the next patient sat down.</p><p>For nearly half an hour, one patient after another was seen.  Finally, the last one left.</p><p>"Daoist..." Yue Wenfu was frantic.</p><p>Qin Sang waved her hand and said to Yu Lang, "Yu Lang, go down the mountain and borrow two horses from Mr. Chen. We're going into town today."</p><p>"Into town!" Yu Lang cheered, running down the mountain.</p><p>Qin Sang then told Xiao Wu, "Xiao Wu, stay and watch the house."</p><p>Xiao Wu nodded without asking why.</p><p>"Let's go," Qin Sang called to Yue Wenfu, starting down the mountain.</p><p>Yue Wenfu realized the Qingfeng Daoist was finally going to act.  Overjoyed, he hurried to catch up.</p><p>*Da! Da! Da!*</p><p>The urgent sound of hooves echoed on the official road. Two Daoists rode swiftly, attracting the attention of passersby.  But their speed was no match for Yue Wenfu's ability; he easily kept up, though he dared not urge them on, marveling at the Qingfeng Daoist's commitment to the charade.</p><p>Yue Wenfu arrived ahead, causing the malevolent spirits to retreat.</p><p>The master and disciple arrived at the city gate of Jian County, tethered their horses to a post outside the city, and entered on foot.</p><p>"So lively!" Yu Lang took a deep breath, intoxicated by the mixture of food aromas.  Having grown up in a mountain village, his trips to town were few and far between.  His strongest memory was his father's last trip with him to the temple fair – a day as vibrant as this one.  Though he had devoted himself to the Daoist life, this memory remained vivid, perhaps forever.  It wasn't just his father; it was the dazzling spectacle of human life.</p><p>"Master, why didn't Senior Sister come? I want to buy her a gift," Yu Lang looked up.</p><p>"Good. Let's choose one as we walk."</p><p>Qin Sang acted as if she were simply out shopping, strolling leisurely through the streets with Yu Lang, looking here and there, much to Yue Wenfu's growing impatience.</p><p>The goods were abundant and varied. Yu Lang was almost overwhelmed by the choices.</p><p>They strolled to Miaoqian Street, where Qin Sang stopped before a teahouse. Yu Lang listened for a moment, then peered through the curtain, puzzled.  "Master, is the story that good?"</p><p>Qin Sang considered it. "It's a story full of tired clichés."</p><p>The storyteller was describing a battle between a goddess, a green bird, and three star deities.  During the crisis, the goddess and the bird discovered an ancient immortal's cave, greatly increasing their power. They engaged the three deities in a fierce battle.</p><p>The battle was exceptionally intense.</p><p>Unbeknownst to them, the cave was actually the immortal's demon-sealing place, imprisoning a powerful demon.  The seal was gradually weakened by the spells of both sides, unnoticed by either.</p><p>"Suddenly, a clap of thunder shook the heavens; the cave filled with smoke. Then, with a crack, the entire mountain split in two, causing both sides to stop fighting.  Black smoke billowed from the fissure, and a terrifying laugh echoed from below.  A terrifying demon emerged! The goddess's whim had brought calamity upon the world!"</p><p>The storyteller spoke with great passion, snapping his fan dramatically towards the entrance.</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>Every person and spirit in the hall, their attention captured by the storyteller, turned to the teahouse door.</p><p>Qin Sang stood calmly at the entrance, unmoved.  "If I did not reveal myself, would you, friend, gather every spirit in this land before giving up?"</p><p>"Hahaha... I couldn't bear such karmic consequences, and I'm sure you wouldn't stand by and watch the world descend into chaos."</p><p>The storyteller laughed, stepped down from the stage, and strolled towards the teahouse entrance, his fan gently swaying.  As he passed, the tea drinkers, roused from a long dream by the fan's breeze, awoke fully.</p><p>Opening the curtain, the storyteller left the teahouse and bowed, his fan closed. "I am Qingyuan."</p>
