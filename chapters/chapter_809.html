<h1>Chapter 801: The Four Sacred Mountains</h1><p>Compared to the Demonic Sea, the Inner Sea had many more restrictions.  </p><p>Quite a few factions didn't want to join either the Righteous Path or the Demonic Path and participate in the conflict, but since they couldn't directly oppose them, they had to comply on the surface.</p><p>No wonder those Nascent Soul elders were willing to abandon their Inner Sea foundations and go to the Demonic Sea to occupy islands and become kings. They sought freedom and independence.</p><p>After continuous flight, Qin Sang finally saw the outline of Tianxing Island.</p><p>This island held great significance for humanity; it could be called the birthplace of dragons.</p><p>Later, the teleportation formation to the Demonic Sea was also set up on Tianxing Island. Although Tianxing Island wasn't located in the center of the Canglang Sea, but rather towards the east, it still became a sacred place for humanity.</p><p>Both the Righteous and Demonic Paths agreed to jointly manage it, and Tianxing City on the island gradually developed into the largest human city.</p><p>Tianxing City was vast and boundless, with countless cultivators gathered here. Along with the mortals who lived here, the city was bustling with people, a sight unseen in Xiaohanyue.</p><p>Coming to Tianxing Island for the second time, Qin Sang was still amazed by the magnificent scene before him.</p><p>He had briefly visited once before and knew where to rent a cave dwelling.</p><p>In Tianxing City, there were four sacred mountains, the converging point of the island's spiritual veins.</p><p>The Four Sacred Mountains were named after four predecessors who had turned the tide and saved humanity from peril during a time when humanity was weak and its survival was at stake.  They served as places of worship.</p><p>One of the sacred mountains housed a teleportation formation and was the most heavily guarded place on Tianxing Island.</p><p>The cave dwellings on the other two sacred mountains were provided for cultivators of the Righteous and Demonic Paths in the city.</p><p>The last one was available for rent to rogue cultivators or visiting cultivators.</p><p>The cave dwellings in Tianxing City were expensive but of high quality.  Qin Sang, having acquired the legacies of two great masters, was wealthy enough to afford them, but other cultivators might not be so fortunate.</p><p>After admiring Tianxing City, Qin Sang's figure flickered, arriving at a city gate.</p><p>At the same time, from time to time, streaks of light flashed from all directions, entering and exiting Tianxing Island through the various city gates, a testament to the dense concentration of cultivators within the city.</p><p>There were even more mortals. Roads stretched in all directions outside the city, with countless ships sailing from the island, presenting a scene of prosperity.</p><p>Mortals and cultivators entered and exited through different gates.</p><p>Tianxing City had a protective formation, and Qin Sang didn't want to test the strength of the city guard, so he obediently went through the gate.</p><p>Qin Sang appeared.</p><p>Although the guards were of low cultivation, they somehow accurately detected Qin Sang's cultivation level and put on respectful expressions. "Greetings, Senior. Have you been to Tianxing City before? If you have a token, you can directly enter the city.  As a Foundation Establishment cultivator, you don't need to pay spirit stones."</p><p>Qin Sang took out a token he had prepared earlier. "After reaching Foundation Establishment, I've been active in the Demonic Sea and only have a token from Great Desolation Island. Will that do?"</p><p>Actually, obtaining such tokens wasn't difficult. Qin Sang had used two identities and obtained two from Great Desolation Island.  Both the Righteous and Demonic Paths seemed to be confident in their strength and unafraid of petty thieves; both Tianxing City and Great Desolation Island had a welcoming atmosphere.</p><p>However, the spiritual veins of Great Desolation Island were far inferior to those of Tianxing Island.</p><p>Using the teleportation formation was quite expensive; one couldn't just teleport for fun.</p><p>"So, Senior has been hunting demons in the Demonic Sea." The guard's tone became even more respectful, gesturing with his hand, "The tokens of the two cities are interchangeable. Please enter, Senior."</p><p>Qin Sang didn't move and asked, "I want to stay in the city to cultivate for a while and rent a cave dwelling. Is there anything else I need?"</p><p>The guard asked, "May I ask which sect or faction Senior is from?"</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head. "I'm a rogue cultivator."</p><p>The guard suddenly understood and pointed to one of the sacred mountains. "If Senior wishes to rent a cave dwelling, you can go to Mount Baogu with your token. There are certainly suitable cave dwellings on the mountain. From the foot to the summit, the quality of the cave dwellings, as well as the prices, increase. If Senior needs it, I can call a guide for you..."</p><p>Baogu was one of the Four Saints, and a female cultivator.</p><p>As the guard spoke, he called out, and several people immediately rushed out from behind the gate, including low-level cultivators and mortals.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Qin Sang chose a young mortal man.</p><p>This man was in his early twenties, with a sly look on his face, like a street urchin. However, in front of Qin Sang, he didn't dare to be disrespectful at all. He had learned of Qin Sang's cultivation from the guard; a single finger could crush him.</p><p>He was also very surprised that such a powerful immortal master would choose him.</p><p>"Take me to the real estate agency where mortals buy houses. This is your reward." Qin Sang tossed the young man a spirit stone.</p><p>Within Tianxing City, except for the areas near the Four Sacred Mountains, most of the city was inhabited by mortals and low-level cultivators.</p><p>The young man clutched the spirit stone with a joyful expression and repeatedly agreed, not daring to speak further. "Immortal Master, please follow me."</p><p>Low-altitude flight was allowed within the city, but Qin Sang didn't want to walk. He grabbed the young man by the back of his neck and made him lead the way.</p><p>Soon.</p><p>They turned several streets, and the young man pointed tremblingly at a small building in the distance, his voice quivering. "Your honor, Immortal Master, that is the most famous real estate agency. They guarantee the best locations in the city, although the prices are somewhat high. Of course, for Immortal Master, it's certainly nothing."</p><p>"I understand. You can go back now."</p><p>Qin Sang dropped the young man.</p><p>He had the young man point out several real estate agencies.  He planned to disguise himself as a mortal and buy a small courtyard near Mount Baogu sometime later, preparing to use it to contact Lady Liu.</p><p>Regarding Xiang Yi and the leader of the East Pole Alliance, it was better to be cautious.</p><p>Leaving the young man, Qin Sang flew straight towards Mount Baogu on his sword and found the place to rent cave dwellings at the foot of the mountain.</p><p>Even with his wealth, he couldn't help but feel a pang of pain when he saw the rental prices. However, the Four Sacred Mountains were located on Tianxing Island's largest spiritual vein, and the spiritual energy was extremely abundant. The high prices had their reasons.</p><p>Cultivating in a cave dwelling on the mountain could indeed increase one's cultivation speed.</p><p>In the end, he chose a location as close to the summit as possible and rented it for thirty years at once. After paying the spirit stones, he received the jade talisman for the cave dwelling's spirit array.</p><p>This cave dwelling was built into the mountain, not far from the summit. Standing at the entrance, one could see the statue of Baogu at the peak.</p><p>The statue was incredibly elegant, befitting the top cultivator of that time.</p><p>Qin Sang activated the jade talisman, opening the spirit array. Upon entering, he found the cave dwelling quite spacious, and the surrounding environment was serene. Cultivating in seclusion here for decades wouldn't feel confining.</p><p>He was used to ascetic cultivation and didn't care much about these things. After carefully inspecting the cave, he set up another isolating spirit array inside before feeling truly at ease.</p><p>"I'll cultivate here from now on. It finally feels a bit like home."</p><p>An inexplicable feeling stirred within Qin Sang.</p><p>He sat in the cave dwelling for a while, relieving the fatigue from his journey, and began to carefully plan his future cultivation path.</p><p>"These things can't be accomplished overnight; there's no rush. However, I need to start refining the sword soul first. It needs to be nurtured for a while before it can transform into a demonic seed. After it's refined, I'll go out and search for a corpse. There are many islands near Tianxing Island; I'll be able to find a suitable one..."</p><p>Qin Sang acted as soon as he thought of it, studying the *Seed Primordial Demonic Embryo*.</p>
