<h1>Chapter 1038: A Warning and a Deal </h1><p>Su Nü?</p><p>A flicker of surprise crossed Qin Sang's eyes.</p><p>He had saved Su Nü once in the Glacial Plains and was very familiar with her voice.</p><p>This Earth Spirit was a puppet controlled by Su Nü.</p><p>“Who are you?”</p><p>Qin Sang narrowed his eyes, not revealing anything.</p><p>Other Earth Spirits fiercely attacked.  Qin Sang waved his arm, and the Ebony Sword split into several beams of sword light, clashing with the Earth Spirit army.</p><p>The Earth Spirit controlled by Su Nü also pretended to attack Qin Sang.</p><p>Ming Wei, beside Qin Sang, noticed the Earth Spirit's unusual behavior.  She looked at the Earth Spirit, then at Qin Sang, puzzled by who he was communicating with.</p><p>“Fellow Daoist saved my life not long ago. Have you forgotten me so quickly?”</p><p>A charming face flickered across the Earth Spirit's face, a fleeting image of Su Nü.</p><p>“You've mistaken me for someone else.”</p><p>Qin Sang denied it.</p><p>When he saved Su Nü, he wore a mask and used the Heavenly Demon Transformation, so his appearance and aura were vastly different now.</p><p>Su Nü had actually seen through his disguise!</p><p>This was unexpected.</p><p>“Fellow Daoist, there’s no need to deny it. My cultivation method is unique, and my senses are very sharp. Outside the Bewildering Caves, I noticed that the aura on your body is exactly the same as my savior. It's the same person, but I didn’t have the chance to speak with you.”</p><p>Su Nü quickly explained.</p><p>Qin Sang sighed inwardly. Ancient Demonic Arts were indeed strange; even his disguise couldn't fool them.</p><p>After a moment of silence, Qin Sang decided to stop denying it. "You possessed an Earth Spirit to find me. What is the matter?"</p><p>“The time I can maintain this form is limited. Let's keep it brief.”</p><p>Su Nü spoke quickly, with a hint of urgency.  "I will never forget your life-saving grace. I came to warn you that a great calamity is about to befall this place. Do not participate in the fight for the Soul Cleansing Liquid. Take my advice and leave the Secret Caves immediately!"</p><p>Qin Sang was startled and suspicious.</p><p>He had intervened due to Bai's warning, not entirely to save her. He hadn't expected Su Nü to repay the favor.</p><p>“What calamity are you talking about?  Isn't it a bit much to ask me to abandon such a treasure based on your words alone? If your East Pole Alliance wants to use this method to eliminate obstacles, go find Blood Bat and Daoist Xiaoyun. I'm alone and pose no threat to you.”</p><p>Su Nü urgently said, “I've witnessed it with my own eyes and know your strength. But this time, the Soul Cleansing Liquid is truly not worth fighting for! Have you noticed the masked man among us? Do you know his identity? He is Venerable Ye of the East Pole Alliance, a Nascent Soul Grandmaster!”</p><p>“What did you say?”</p><p>Su Nü's news was shocking. Qin Sang's heart skipped a beat, and his entire body tensed up.</p><p>He abruptly looked towards the seal at the center of the Secret Caves.</p><p>Not only were the cultivators near the barrier attacking the seal with their magic tools and techniques, causing the barrier to tremble slightly, but also those further away.</p><p>One of them was the masked man, Venerable Ye.</p><p>“This is a trial ground for Core Formation cultivators. How could a Nascent Soul Grandmaster appear here? There's never been a precedent since ancient times. It's absurd!”</p><p>Qin Sang sneered, not believing Su Nü's words.</p><p>“Before entering the Seven Kill Hall, did you see anyone like him beside me?”</p><p>Su Nü countered, sighing.  “If I were you, I would also think you were talking nonsense. But this is what I saw with my own eyes. The celestial phenomenon that appeared in the trial grounds not long ago was caused by him sneaking in…”</p><p>Su Nü detailed the events.</p><p>The details were specific and plausible.</p><p>Qin Sang carefully recalled the scene in the square. Su Nü indeed hadn't been accompanied by such a person. Could that man really be Venerable Ye?</p><p>Combined with the previous celestial phenomenon, Qin Sang felt uncertain.</p><p>“Venerable Ye snuck in just for the Soul Cleansing Liquid?”</p><p>Qin Sang still couldn't believe it.</p><p>Su Nü claimed that the price Venerable Ye paid to sneak in was enormous. A few bottles of Soul Cleansing Liquid were simply not worth such a drastic move by the East Pole Alliance.</p><p>“He has another purpose. Taking the Soul Cleansing Liquid is just a bonus.”</p><p>Su Nü sighed softly. “Before Venerable Ye makes his move, I can’t prove anything. When the seal is about to break, you'll know whether I'm trustworthy.  I've said my piece. Whether you believe me or not is up to you. I just hope you won’t blame me in the end."</p><p>Su Nü's words were sincere, making Qin Sang truly unsure.</p><p>But to give up the Soul Cleansing Liquid, to miss the opportunity for Nascent Soul formation based on just a few words, how could he be reconciled to that?</p><p>While Qin Sang hesitated, Su Nü said thoughtfully, “If you’re unwilling to give up the Soul Cleansing Liquid, you don’t necessarily have to take the risk. Perhaps we can make a deal.”</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes flashed. “I’m all ears.”</p><p>“Venerable Ye has promised to give me a bottle of the Soul Cleansing Liquid. I'm willing to give it to you.”</p><p>Su Nü said resolutely, seemingly unconcerned about the Soul Cleansing Liquid.</p><p>Qin Sang was tempted, but only believed about twenty percent of Su Nü's words.  “Are you unaware of the value of the Soul Cleansing Liquid? I’m afraid I don't have anything comparable to it.”</p><p>“Of course I know.  It can aid in Nascent Soul formation. But if I lose my life, Nascent Soul formation is just a pipe dream. What good is the Soul Cleansing Liquid then?”</p><p>Su Nü said bitterly.</p><p>This piqued Qin Sang's curiosity.</p><p>Su Nü's tone didn't seem feigned.</p><p>“I don’t understand. With your status in the East Pole Alliance, who could take your life?”</p><p>“What if I told you that the person who wants my life is the East Pole Alliance itself?”</p><p>A strange light flickered in the Earth Spirit’s empty eyes.</p><p>Qin Sang frowned.</p><p>Others might not know, but he knew that Fairy Yue had spared no expense to rescue Su Nü from the Demonic Island.</p><p>Later, Su Nü had soared from the Foundation Establishment stage to the late Core Formation stage in just a few decades. The East Pole Alliance must have invested a lot of resources in her.</p><p>Why nurture and then kill, especially such a talented disciple?</p><p>Su Nü didn't notice Qin Sang's expression and continued, "Outsiders certainly wouldn’t believe what I’ve been through. Back then, I was just a young girl.  I was fortunate enough to encounter a path to immortality and was taken in as a disciple by a senior.  I met many fellow disciples and thought I could finally embark on the path of immortality and achieve something. But I never imagined that person had a heart of a viper. She used us, her disciples, as sacrifices.  She used True Demonic Qi to set up a demonic formation, hoping to refine a Five Yin Mystic Body from among us. In the end, I was the only survivor! But she thought I would lose my memory after being reshaped by the demonic formation, so she continued her charade and finally offered me to the East Pole Alliance Leader…”</p><p>Su Nü recounted a horrifying story.</p><p>Qin Sang was shocked.</p><p>The senior she spoke of was Fairy Yue.</p><p>Qin Sang never imagined that such a seemingly virtuous and respected senior could harbor such a terrifying secret.</p><p>He finally understood.</p><p>No wonder Su Nü had acted strangely back then; she had been trying to escape Fairy Yue's clutches.</p>
