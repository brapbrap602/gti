<h1>Chapter 1202:  The Disturbance</h1><p>“The mysterious person sent a plea for help, luring me here, but now there’s no response.  This means the mysterious person was either rescued or died here; in short, they’ve most likely vanished…</p><p>“Tan Hao was involved, but only his aura remains here, no opponent's.  Did he break the seal under the mysterious person's guidance?</p><p>“Chen Heng probably also came, but didn't attempt a rescue.</p><p>“The treasures the Heavenly Corpse Sect kept in the main hall must have fallen into Chen Heng’s hands, right? Otherwise, how would he know corpse refinement techniques? That guy probably grabbed the treasures and ran, not bothering with the rescue at all—quite the scoundrel.”</p><p>At this point, Qin Sang instantly realized the mysterious person was the one he was looking for!</p><p>“Tan Hao was moved enough by the mysterious person to help her escape. This at least shows the mysterious person possessed something worthwhile to trade with Tan Hao.  And Tan Hao, solely focused on reviving Tan Jie, had already disregarded his own life or death—that was the most compelling offer! The question is, did Tan Hao succeed, and where have they gone?”</p><p>Qin Sang abruptly stood up and immediately searched the water, and indeed, discovered more traces of sharp gold energy in other areas.</p><p>Tan Hao, guided by the mysterious person, was able to seal it from both inside and outside.</p><p>Qin Sang, alone, could only follow the distribution pattern of this sharp gold energy, slowly unraveling the seal to find the sealed space, hoping to discover something.</p><p>In the secluded realm, undisturbed.</p><p>Qin Sang and the Sky-Eyed Butterfly patiently analyzed the seal.</p><p>However, the seal was far grander than Qin Sang imagined, confirming that no cultivator in the present world possessed this capability. The mysterious person's origins were becoming clear; she was likely from the same era as Bai.</p><p>Days passed.</p><p>Qin Sang spent over ten days, gradually gaining some leads.</p><p>One day, he appeared beside the altar, surrounded by demonic banners. The Golden Sinking Sword flew out on its own, like a fish, freely moving in the water—seemingly chaotic, but actually ‘picking’ at the nodes of the seal.</p><p>As Qin Sang moved, the water surface was no longer calm; suddenly, waves surged.</p><p>Undercurrents appeared, bringing immense impact.</p><p>Qin Sang channeled his true energy to protect himself, ignoring everything around him, following the Golden Sinking Sword. The Sky-Eyed Butterfly on his shoulder gently flapped its wings.</p><p>Along with his and the Golden Sinking Sword’s movements, the disturbances in the water became increasingly violent.  In some places, the seal manifested, fleetingly, but then triggered another area of water.</p><p>This was like a boundless ocean formed by seals, incredibly complex. Without the Sky-Eyed Butterfly, without the traces left by Tan Hao's seal-breaking, Qin Sang didn't know how much longer he would need to decipher it.</p><p>Gradually, the seal revealed a layer of its mysterious veil.</p><p>‘Rumble…...’</p><p>Waves crashed, completely shattering the space's calm. Fatty Chicken, at the exit, saw the scene below, becoming nervous; it flapped its wings, lightning flashing, blocking the exit to prevent the disturbances from affecting the outside.</p><p>Underwater, it became pitch black.</p><p>Qin Sang felt the power in the water becoming increasingly chaotic. He surfaced, leaving only the Golden Sinking Sword behind.</p><p>The sword light sank and floated in the water, appearing and disappearing.</p><p>At that moment, a shadow inexplicably appeared on the altar. The unexpected change made Qin Sang's eyes narrow; he stared intently at the altar, but the Golden Sinking Sword’s movements didn’t stop.</p><p>The shadow quickly changed, and the power of the seal converged towards it, gradually forming the rudimentary shape of a vortex at the bottom of the water, connecting to the very center of the altar!</p><p>The vortex appeared, leading to an unknown place.</p><p>The water here didn't decrease at all, indicating the vortex was a manifestation of the seal’s power.</p><p>As the vortex was about to fully form, Qin Sang’s expression shifted, and he suddenly recalled the Golden Sinking Sword.</p><p>The vortex abruptly dissipated, and the power of the seal dispersed back into the water. The water surface quickly returned to calm, showing no sign of the previous chaos, making one wonder if it had all been an illusion.</p><p>“The inside of the vortex is unfathomable; it doesn't seem to be a simple spatial connection.”</p><p>Qin Sang analyzed the scene the Sky-Eyed Butterfly had just observed. “The vortex leads to the sealed space, but there's no response. To verify my hypothesis and ascertain Tan Hao and the mysterious person’s whereabouts, I’ll probably have to take a look myself.  To be safe when entering the unknown space, I'll wait until the Ebony Sword finishes its absorption…”</p><p>Qin Sang had a hunch that the sealed space wasn't that simple.</p><p>The sword array requires the use of a natal spirit sword to activate it to its maximum potential, providing an additional strategy in dangerous situations.</p><p>Additionally, after the natal spirit sword advances to a top-tier magical artifact, combining thunder escape with sword escape will greatly enhance his escape techniques.</p><p>The Ebony Sword was nearing the completion of its absorption when he set out for the Abyss of Sin, and it won't be long now.</p><p>Pang Ji was eager to try, but Qin Sang held him back.  The place ahead wasn't some safe haven; venturing in might mean facing immediate danger, leaving no time to even call for help.</p><p>Qin Sang was patient. She returned to the front of the great hall, sat cross-legged, simultaneously comprehending the Seven Souls Killing Formation and awaiting the ebony sword.</p><p>…</p><p>The Abyssal Ruins entrance.</p><p>This was the Sin Abyss, the deepest part of the Sky Scar.</p><p>But this wasn't the end.  A gigantic chasm, several thousand zhang in diameter, had appeared on the ground. The irregular void was filled with an endless mystery, a true darkness that seemed to suck in even one's gaze.</p><p>This was the entrance to the Abyssal Ruins, and the Sin God Palace was hidden within.</p><p>Around the chasm's edge, the Sin Abyss had deployed a great formation.</p><p>One purpose was to prevent intruders. The Abyssal Ruins and the Sin God Palace were undeniably crucial to the Sin Abyss cultivators, especially during wartime, requiring protection against sabotage by the Two Realms Alliance.</p><p>Another purpose was to prevent the leakage of power from within the Ruins.</p><p>At the chasm's edge sat a white-haired elder and a high-crowned Daoist priest.  Their auras indicated they were both Yuan Ying masters, personally guarding the place!</p><p>Teams of guards patrolled the outer perimeter, maintaining exceptionally tight security.</p><p>The two Yuan Ying masters sat casually on rocks beside the chasm, eyes closed, in quiet meditation.</p><p>Suddenly, an unusual fluctuation emanated from within the void.</p><p>Both Yuan Ying masters opened their eyes, their gaze sharp and penetrating, fixed on the chasm's interior.</p><p>After a moment, they exchanged a look.  The white-haired elder said, "It must be the Sin God Palace.  It's been half a year since the last time; it's about time for the tremors to begin."</p><p>The high-crowned Daoist nodded. "This time, the Sin God Palace and the Purple Micro Palace seem to be emerging earlier than usual. In the years leading up to their appearance, the Sin God Palace's tremors will become increasingly frequent."</p><p>As they spoke, they flicked their fingers, sending streams of light into the spirit formation surrounding the chasm.  Moments later, glowing lights blazed, activating the formation, which eventually solidified into a thin barrier covering the chasm.</p><p>Then, the fluctuations continued.</p><p>This lasted for two days. During that time, several cultivators flew out from within.</p><p>"It's coming! Let them down."</p><p>The white-haired elder said gravely, taking out a delicately crafted iron bell and ringing it.  A resonant chime echoed.</p><p>Guards shot forward, landing around the two Yuan Ying masters, sensing the increasingly chaotic fluctuations from within the chasm, awaiting something.</p>
