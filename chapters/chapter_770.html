<h1>Chapter 762: Fierce Battle</h1><p>Mistakenly believing Qin Sang was involved in the secrets of an ancient divine platform, and suspecting other forces were hidden behind him, the young man was hesitant to act, wanting to investigate thoroughly.  After learning it was all a misunderstanding, he no longer held back. He shifted his weight slightly.</p><p>‘Shhh…’</p><p>The ground suddenly cracked. Starting from beneath the young man’s feet, a fissure spread towards Qin Sang at an alarming speed.  A verdant light emanated from within the crack, revealing a green vine growing rapidly, thick as a python. Its target seemed not to be Qin Sang, but the Two-Headed Hound.</p><p>The Two-Headed Hound sensed the danger, lowered its head, and growled, staring intently at the fissure.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The vine burst from the ground. With a whoosh, it shot out. Qin Sang only glimpsed a green blur before the vine lunged at the Two-Headed Hound.</p><p>The Two-Headed Hound’s fur bristled. Without hesitation, it used its Shadow Splitting ability. Its form flickered, instantly splitting into several figures that darted in all directions.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the vine suddenly swayed, and several branches sprouted from its tip, as agile as vipers, swift as lightning.</p><p>‘Thud! Thud! Thud!’</p><p>Several of the Two-Headed Hound's shadow clones were ensnared and shattered on the spot.  However, its true form successfully evaded the vine and escaped.</p><p>The vine, relentless, continued its pursuit.</p><p>Suddenly, a sword beam flashed, severing the vine.</p><p>Qin Sang dashed back alongside the Two-Headed Hound. The Ebony Sword, like a soaring dragon, not only sliced through the vine but also plunged into the fissure, effortlessly chopping the vine into several pieces, uprooting it completely.</p><p>But instead of relief, Qin Sang felt a pang of unease.  The vine was powerful enough to force the Two-Headed Hound to use its Shadow Splitting ability.  It shouldn't have been so easily severed, unless the young man intended it.</p><p>A sense of foreboding washed over Qin Sang.  His gaze sharpened, noticing something unusual about the motionless young man in the distance. Without hesitation, he activated the Nine Dragons Chariot Talisman.</p><p>Draconic auras enveloped Qin Sang, and his speed surged. He vanished from his spot, reappearing several yards away.</p><p>The instant Qin Sang disappeared, the ground beneath his former position exploded, and a green light shot skyward.</p><p>At the heart of the green light was a bizarre spirit sword.  Its body resembled a gray sword carved from old bark, its surface rough and uneven, yet radiating a vibrant green light, brimming with life.</p><p>The gray sword's appearance was utterly unexpected. It had been lying dormant underground, waiting to strike.</p><p>Had Qin Sang still been in his original position, he would have been cleaved in two.</p><p>The young man let out a soft gasp, looking at Qin Sang with surprise. “It seems your escape technique is even stronger than I imagined. But it’s not enough!”</p><p>Before his words faded, the young man made several hand seals. The gray sword trembled, emitting a deep, resonant hum, its green glow intensifying.</p><p>As the green light grew stronger, the gray sword's form became increasingly ethereal, eventually vanishing completely.</p><p>Blades of grass and small trees sprouted on the barren ground.</p><p>In an instant, the space around Qin Sang transformed from a desolate wasteland of purple mist into a verdant wilderness.</p><p>Of course, it was all an illusion.</p><p>The gray sword's physical form had disappeared, concealed within the wilderness. But every blade of grass, every leaf, radiated sword Qi.  Any one of them could be the gray sword in disguise, making defense incredibly difficult.</p><p>If the Skyeye Butterfly had completed its third metamorphosis, Qin Sang could easily see through this illusion.  But for now, he could only remain vigilant.</p><p>This kind of illusion, composed purely of sword Qi, had inherent weaknesses. It was flashy but lacked substance.  Unless the user possessed exceptional swordsmanship, it wouldn’t be truly effective.  Unfortunately, the disparity in cultivation between Qin Sang and the young man was too great. Qin Sang couldn't overcome it with brute force and found himself constrained.</p><p>The vegetation grew wildly, constricting his movement.</p><p>Qin Sang knew he couldn't remain passive.  He pointed at the Ebony Sword, not to recall it for defense, but to command it to attack the young man directly.</p><p>Simultaneously, Qin Sang took out the scroll and tossed it gently.  Falling flowers and leaves drifted down, blending seamlessly with the surrounding illusory vegetation.</p><p>Qin Sang's figure shimmered, then vanished.</p><p>He was able to perfectly merge with the illusion and hide in the most dangerous place precisely because, like the young man, he primarily cultivated Wood-elemental spiritual power.</p><p>The young man lost sight of Qin Sang, unable to sense his presence within the sword Qi illusion.  Realizing his tactic had backfired, he roared, "Explode!"</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The entire sword Qi illusion shattered. The seemingly real vegetation revealed its true nature, fragmenting like a shattered mirror.</p><p>These fragments swiftly converged, reforming the gray sword.</p><p>As the illusion crumbled, the scroll was impacted, and the falling flowers trembled. Qin Sang's true form was revealed.  The gray sword quivered, seizing the opportunity to strike at the back of Qin Sang's neck.</p><p>Sensing the rapidly approaching gray sword, a chill ran down Qin Sang's spine. He had no choice but to dodge again.</p><p>From the moment the fight began, he had been on the defensive, merely reacting to the young man's attacks, unable to confront him directly. The difference in their cultivation levels was starkly apparent.</p><p>If he couldn't find a way to break the stalemate, he would be worn down.</p><p>As Qin Sang evaded the gray sword, the Ebony Sword flew towards the young man, and the Two-Headed Hound charged.</p><p>The young man's relaxed expression stiffened the moment a thunderous sound reached his ears.</p><p>“Sword Qi Thunderclap…”</p><p>The Ebony Sword, like a bolt of lightning, shot towards the young man’s throat.  He reacted swiftly, leaping back while simultaneously striking out with his palm, releasing a golden light.</p><p>The source of the golden light was a golden ring. Initially the size of a finger ring, it rapidly expanded to the size of a bracelet after leaving the young man’s hand. Spinning rapidly, it flew towards the Ebony Sword, seemingly attempting to ensnare it.</p><p>“Another mid-grade magical treasure!”</p><p>Qin Sang’s expression grew serious.  The gray sword the young man had previously summoned was likely his natal spirit sword. Given his cultivation, refining his natal treasure to the level of a mid-grade magical treasure wasn't surprising.</p><p>But to casually summon another mid-grade magical treasure demonstrated just how formidable this opponent was.</p><p>Unsure of the golden ring's abilities, Qin Sang dared not let it touch the Ebony Sword.  He changed his hand seals, quickly utilizing the Sword Light Splitting ability.</p><p>As the golden ring approached, the Ebony Sword abruptly stopped in mid-air, then suddenly split into two.</p><p>Caught off guard, the young man’s golden ring only captured the illusory sword light. The Ebony Sword’s true form continued its advance unimpeded.</p><p>“Sword Light Splitting!”</p><p>The young man exclaimed, envy and jealousy flashing across his face.</p><p>He had immersed himself in the way of the sword for many years, yet he had never been able to grasp Sword Light Splitting. Although Qin Sang had only split off a single illusory blade, it represented a chasm he couldn’t cross.</p><p>Despite his surprise, the young man remained composed.  The disparity in their strength couldn't be bridged by a mere sword technique.</p><p>The Ebony Sword was inches away.</p><p>The Two-Headed Hound seized the opportunity, widening its vertical pupils.  Exerting its full strength, it unleashed a barrage of wind blades, converging into a swirling tempest.</p><p>Ironically, it was the young man who was first forced onto the defensive, beset by both the Ebony Sword and the Two-Headed Hound.</p>
