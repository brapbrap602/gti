<h1>Chapter 2154: Conjecture Regarding the Integration Stage</h1><p>“Any findings?”</p><p>While speeding along, Qin Sang couldn't help but ask.</p><p>Su Nu, controlling the Stone Ghost General, shook her head.</p><p>“We probably can't go much further,” Qin Sang frowned.</p><p>Time was short, they didn't need to worry about the erosion of the  Niel River, but the surrounding area was filled with chaotic forces. As they ventured deeper, these forces grew stronger, requiring them to use increasingly powerful means to protect themselves.</p><p>After carefully questioning the Yuanxiang clan leader, Qin Sang had a general idea of the location of the Yuanjiao City within the Niel River. Based on his understanding of the river, this area shouldn't be this dangerous, yet they found themselves unable to proceed even a single step.</p><p>Qin Sang guessed it might be related to Yuanjiao City or the Yi Ren tribe's sacred land, causing an unknown change.</p><p>Su Nu also realized this problem. The Stone Ghost General was finding it increasingly difficult to resist. Her cultivation was inferior to Qin Sang's; she would inevitably be the first to collapse.</p><p>After traveling a short distance further, as Qin Sang predicted, the Stone Ghost General's speed slowed considerably. The murky fog, capable of destroying mountains with ease, struck at it, hindering its movement.</p><p>When they forced their way forward, the fog flow left cuts like those made by a blade on its tough body.</p><p>Qin Sang focused his senses, thankfully, apart from the violent Niel River storm, he didn't detect any other danger for the time being.  He summoned the Gray Warbler Sword, its light enveloping the Stone Ghost General, immediately easing the burden on Su Nu.</p><p>Temporarily relieved, Su Nu thanked him and let out a sigh of relief.</p><p>“Are you going to continue?” Qin Sang asked.</p><p>“My master's kindness remains unreturned, and my master's whereabouts are unknown, their safety uncertain. If I don't give my all, my heart will not rest!”</p><p>Su Nu's voice was filled with worry, she pleaded, “Please, Qin Xiong, help me one more time!”</p><p>Qin Sang sighed, “I'll use my spirit sword to help you, you just keep moving forward. If that's still not enough, I can finally unleash the Kuntian Golden Lock to help you stabilize the fog flow. However, by then, even if you find something, we won't have the energy left, and it will be difficult for us to do anything.”</p><p>“Thank you for your understanding, Qin Xiong!”</p><p>Su Nu's mind was made up, and immediately she piloted the Stone Ghost General to the front.</p><p>Qin Sang cast spells to protect himself while simultaneously controlling the Gray Warbler Sword, hanging above the Stone Ghost General. The sword light constantly shifted to counter the Niel River's impact.</p><p>As time passed, the sword light was forced to gradually contract, until it could only barely cover the Stone Ghost General, like a thin layer of armor.</p><p>Qin Sang altered his incantation, deploying the Four-象 Sword Formation. The situation stabilized again, and they found themselves within the sword formation, merging with the darkness.</p><p>Unfortunately, the good times didn't last. The Niel River's impact was omnipresent and pervasive, and Qin Sang felt increasingly strained.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>'Sizzle!'</p><p>A lightning bolt dispersed the darkness, slicing through the fog like a sharp sword before vanishing into the depths of the Niel River.</p><p>Qin Sang unleashed his thunder magic, thunder seals appearing high in the sky.  Lightning bolts struck forward, illuminating their path and clearing the way.</p><p>Meanwhile, Su Nu went all out. The Stone Ghost General was extremely valiant, repeatedly delivering powerful punches. The icy fist wind, separating from the Stone Ghost General's body, transformed into human-shaped ghosts, emitting eerie, sharp cries.  They appeared ferocious and malevolent, voraciously devouring the fog flow before perishing with it.</p><p>Thanks to Qin Sang and Su Nu's skillful coordination, their speed not only didn't decrease but actually increased, but this momentum only lasted a short time.</p><p>A terrifying pressure assaulted them from all directions relentlessly.  Before the Niel River, sword light and thunder were overshadowed.</p><p>Qin Sang struggled for a while longer, then flicked his sleeve, sending out a point of golden light that transformed into the Kuntian Golden Lock.  The power of the illusory domain spread. In an instant, the golden light expanded, and Qin Sang felt the pressure decrease significantly.  Simultaneously, he relentlessly unleashed his thunder magic and swordsmanship, pushing the Stone Ghost General forward a considerable distance.</p><p>Unfortunately, Su Nu continued to use secret techniques to try and sense something, but to no avail.</p><p>At this moment, the pressure was almost entirely on Qin Sang, nearing the limits of his endurance.</p><p>He made an immediate decision, and transmitted his voice in a low tone: “We should go back!”</p><p>Su Nu sighed, and the Stone Ghost General's eyes were full of reluctance. Thankfully, Su Nu was not reckless, dejectedly saying: “Let's go.”</p><p>Qin Sang felt a slight relief, activating the Kuntian Golden Lock to retreat. Retreating was easier than advancing, their speed increasing rapidly, stopping at a point they could bear.</p><p>The two discussed it and made another attempt. With the experience from the first time, they reached a deeper location, but still returned empty-handed.</p><p>They charged forward three times, nearly reaching their limit.  They still couldn't find Su Nu's master, not even a glimmer of hope.  Their lack of strength was the biggest obstacle, something no other method could overcome.</p><p>Even Su Nu, though unwilling to accept it, had to give up.</p><p>Outside the Black Tide.</p><p>Qin Sang, her true self, opened her eyes to look at Su Nu.  Seeing the furrow in her brow, she said, “If your judgment of the trace fluctuations is correct, only a Unity Stage cultivator could have reached that place.”</p><p>Su Nu was startled.  She murmured, “Brother Qin means, Master…?”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded. She had used nearly every means at her disposal – thunder techniques, swordsmanship, and the Heaven-Binding Golden Lock – enough to contend with a late-stage Void Refinement cultivator, yet she couldn't advance an inch.</p><p>Su Nu's master must possess at least Unity Stage cultivation to have gone so far.</p><p>"These traces certainly weren't left unintentionally.  Did your master say anything before he left?" Qin Sang pressed.</p><p>Su Nu's expression was somber.  “Master said he had something to do, a mission.  No matter the outcome, he wouldn't regret it.  He told me to live well after he left.  The way he said it was like…”</p><p>Su Nu trailed off.</p><p>It was clearly a last testament, implying his mission was life-threatening. No wonder Su Nu was so worried.</p><p>“Your master didn’t tell you where he was going, nor did he ask you to rescue him.  If you hadn’t met me, you would almost certainly not have come to the Yuanjiao Sea Market of the Other People’s Tribe, and you wouldn't have discovered the traces your master left behind…” Qin Sang paused.  “Could it be that these weren’t meant for you? Did your master have a sect or friends?”</p><p>“Master never mentioned his sect. During the time I followed him, he never visited any other Daoists.”</p><p>Su Nu’s face was etched with worry.</p><p>Knowing her master might be in trouble but not knowing who to ask for help, Qin Sang understood Su Nu's feelings.  She calmly analyzed the situation: “Since your master left traces, it proves he believed someone capable of saving him might come here.  You should preserve the traces and leave your mark beside them.  Even Void Refinement cultivators have so many life-saving techniques; a Unity Stage cultivator certainly wouldn't fall so easily. Your master is probably just trapped somewhere. When he escapes, or when the person he's waiting for arrives and discovers your mark, they will look for you first.”</p><p>“If that person never appears, will we have to wait until we reach the Unity Stage to rescue Master? I understand my limitations. I can only hope Brother Qin breaks through soon…”</p><p>Su Nu looked lost.</p><p>Qin Sang chuckled self-deprecatingly, unwilling to make any promises.  After entering the Void Refinement stage, her cultivation had been smooth, but she couldn't guarantee she would reach the Unity Stage.</p><p>Of course, they could also ask other powerful cultivators for help.</p><p>Near the Mist Sea, Qin Sang knew a cultivator named Ning Zhenren, but she didn't want to get too involved with him, and Su Nu didn't have anything to offer him.  Besides, Su Nu's master might not want an unfamiliar powerful cultivator to rescue him.</p><p>As they spoke, the Dharma Body and the Stone Demon General returned. Su Nu stood for a long time before the Black Tide, gazing deeply at the River of Misery, then resolutely turned and left.</p><p>Their trip into the River of Misery with Su Nu had taken some time.  Returning to the Yuanjiao Sea Market, Qin Sang rushed between the trade fair and the Treasure Tree.</p><p>One day…</p><p>Qin Sang visited the Yuanxiang Clan leader to ask about any special features of the section of the River of Misery where the Yuanjiao Sea Market was located.</p><p>The Yuanxiang Clan leader said, “Many have been curious and explored it during the market, but all have come back empty-handed, wasting their efforts. Since the Yuanjiao Sea Market has existed, there have been no legends of ancient secret realms or powerful cultivators' legacies nearby. It's actually more dangerous and chaotic than other places, so people have gradually lost interest.”</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at Su Nu.  Seeing that she was calm and had accepted the reality, she thought to herself that Su Nu was wise and resourceful, and once she calmed down she would surely understand what could and couldn't be done.  </p><p>“The cultivators from Purple Cloud Mountain should arrive soon.  Why don't you stay for a few days, Daoist Qin?” the Yuanxiang Clan leader suggested.</p><p>“Very well!”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded. Before entering the Sacred Land, she definitely needed to meet with Liuli to discuss their actions within.</p><p>After that, they would separate: Liuli and Le Chen would be in the open, while she would hide in the shadows.</p><p>On the fourth evening, Liuli and Le Chen finally arrived. Only the two of them; Ning Zhenren did not come.</p><p>"Daoist Qin, this Daoist message is from my master. I'm instructed to give it to you," Liuli said, before Qin Sang could even bow, presenting a message.</p><p>Qin Sang observed carefully and discovered that Liuli's temperament had subtly changed. While her face still rarely showed a smile, her coldness had lessened, making her seem less aloof. She wasn't quite the icy mountain she had been before.</p><p>Before, she seemed to be cultivating the ultimate detachment, but now she was becoming more like a normal person.</p><p>This change, whether good or bad, remains to be seen.</p><p>Qin Sang calmly accepted the talisman, sensing a protective aura emanating from it.  He understood its purpose: to mask the energy fluctuations while absorbing the spiritual essence of the Daiyu Immortal Mountain.</p><p>"Please thank Ning Zhenren on my behalf, Immortal," Qin Sang said respectfully, putting away the talisman.</p><p>"I will inform my Master,"  Liuli replied softly.</p><p>Previously, she wouldn't have responded, barely even nodding.</p><p>"Qin Zhenren," Liao Chen interjected, "we must first choose a meeting place and set a deadline. Even if we can't arrive by then, we must find a way to communicate, otherwise we'll know something has happened."</p><p>Qin Sang understood; this was precisely what he and Si Huang had initially agreed upon.</p><p>Once inside the Sacred Land, the trials begin. The mirage ship won't take everyone to the same place. Only the ship's master and their attendants will stay together; others will be separated, their destination a matter of luck.</p><p>Competition within the Sacred Land is brutal.  Landing in a high-level beast's lair, unable to call for help or leave, is a real possibility. After a certain time, a passage will open, allowing escape from the Sacred Land.</p><p>Of course, the purpose of the Sacred Land trials is to select the strongest; needless killing is rare.  "Meeting and killing" is practically unheard of.</p><p>The Sacred Land is vast, but countless explorations by experts from various races have resulted in detailed maps.</p><p>However, these maps only show general locations. The Sacred Land is not static. A mountain’s interior might have undergone drastic changes, becoming extremely dangerous where once it was safe.  Beast lairs shift constantly, for example.</p><p>"Where has the monk chosen?"</p><p>Qin Sang created a map with his true energy. The markings were sparse, showing only major landmarks – mountains, rivers, lakes – or well-known ruins of past battles, places long since plundered.</p><p>"Windfire Mountain!"</p><p>Liao Chen, having already decided, pointed to a spot on the map.  "The perpetual wind and fire there are unmistakable. This phenomenon has lasted a long time and shouldn't change suddenly."</p><p>With the location and deadline agreed upon—Qin Sang requested a more lenient deadline due to his arrangement with Si Huang, to which Liao Chen and Liuli agreed—they discussed further details before Qin Sang took his leave.</p><p>On the way back, Qin Sang pondered Liuli's transformation. Her cultivation of the Supreme Emotionless Dao seemed different from what he'd expected.</p><p>…</p><p>Five months passed quickly, the opening of the Sacred Land drawing near.</p><p>Qin Sang had been quite successful, exchanging most of the treasures from the Lu family vault for useful items, though he found no ultimate treasures or lucky finds.</p><p>Ten days before the Sacred Land's opening, Qin Sang met with Si Lu.  </p><p>On behalf of the Imperial Tutor, Si Lu delivered a spirit pill.</p><p>After swallowing it, the pill's energy entered Qin Sang's forehead, transforming into a pearl identical to those found on Siyou clan members. Qin Sang's aura shifted, and he became, in appearance, a Siyou cultivator.</p><p>"A miraculous pill!" Qin Sang exclaimed. With some disguise, no one would suspect his true identity.</p><p>Meanwhile, Si Lu brought news that enraged Zhuque.</p><p>"What?! You say *I* can't enter the Sacred Land?!" Zhuque demanded angrily.</p><p>Si Lu explained, "Zhuque Daoist, the Misty Sea is in the East Sea. Many celestial clans have close ties with the sea’s denizens. To prevent anyone from forging pacts with powerful demons and disguising themselves as spirit beasts, an ancient agreement prevents this.  Only those with life-bound contracts with Transformation Stage spirit beasts or insects are allowed, or those from a few clans with innate spirit-beast control abilities, and even then, it's strictly regulated. The Sacred Land's gate is extremely sensitive, and any attempt by you to enter would likely cause problems."</p><p>Not bringing Zhuque was a setback, but at least Tianmu butterfly could accompany him.</p><p>Qin Sang considered this, seeing Zhuque still complaining.  "Imagine the consequences of a sudden Zhuque appearance before the Sacred Land's gate," he said.</p><p>Zhuque immediately fell silent.</p><p>Su Nu said gently, "Brother Qin, rest assured. My sister and Zhuque Daoist will protect Qingyang Prefecture, relieving you of any worries."</p>
