Chapter 652: Jin Liuyíng


Ya Gu closed her eyes, a faint smile playing on her lips.

"Don't sleep!"

A deep voice suddenly echoed in her mind.

So clear, as if whispered right beside her ear.

Then, she felt warmth on her face, gently cradled by a hand.

Everything felt so real.

It didn't seem like a dream…

Ya Gu woke with a start, her eyes wide as she looked at Qin Sang.

Suddenly, tears streamed down her face.

"Don't cry."

Qin Sang frowned slightly.  After Ya Gu had spoken earlier, the fat silkworms in the insect basket had become agitated for some reason, frantically gnawing at the lid, trying to get out.

He didn't have the time to deal with them right now.

Qin Sang gently wiped the tears from Ya Gu's face and said softly, "Tell me, what happened? Who hurt you? I'll avenge you."

Hearing this, Ya Gu suddenly realized her current situation. Her face paled with fright, and she hurriedly pushed Qin Sang away with all her might. "Brother Qin, run! Your enemies are looking for you, they've chased you here…"

Ya Gu's face and voice were filled with urgency.

Qin Sang channeled his True Essence into Ya Gu's body, stabilizing her breath and soothing her. "Don't worry, even if there are enemies, I'm not afraid. Even if I can't beat them, I can still escape. You said my enemies are looking for me, what kind of enemies are they? Why did they attack you? What was the Five Venom Sect doing?"

Soothed by Qin Sang, Ya Gu's emotions calmed down somewhat.  "It's the Li Witch Palace! When I was cultivating at the Five Venom Sect, I heard from a fellow cultivator who came from the Hundred Flowers Palace that cultivators from the Li Witch Palace went to their sect with a Golden Core Decree, ordering them to find an ancient corpse with a severed left arm and emanating corpse Qi…"

As Ya Gu explained, Qin Sang grew increasingly surprised.

Before he left, he had integrated the three factions and ordered them to cooperate sincerely in searching for the secret realm. It wasn't strange for a Hundred Flowers Palace cultivator to be at the Five Venom Sect.

A severed left arm, and emanating corpse Qi… wasn't that exactly his state when he first arrived?

With his cultivation sealed and his divine sense dormant, he was unable to suppress the latent corpse Qi within his body, causing it to erupt instantly. Anyone who saw him would have mistaken him for a long-dead corpse.

But to call him an ancient corpse was absurd.

What surprised Qin Sang even more was that the people looking for him were actually from the Li Witch Palace, whom Ya Gu had mistaken for his enemies.

The Li Witch Palace was a major sect outside the Western Frontier, with a Nascent Soul Patriarch at its helm. They enjoyed considerable prestige throughout the entire Wu Shen Continent, possessing formidable strength and reigning as a dominant force.

Qin Sang's geomantic map marked the Li Witch Palace, located thousands of miles beyond the Western Frontier. It was one of the first major powers he would encounter after leaving the Western Frontier.

No wonder Ya Gu was so panicked and worried for him.

Ya Gu knew that he had only recently formed his Golden Core, and his strength, while strong, was limited.  If he were captured by the Li Witch Palace, he would surely die. The fact that Li Witch Palace cultivators had arrived at the Hundred Flowers Palace with a Golden Core Decree meant that a Li Witch Palace Golden Core cultivator was nearby!

Although some areas of the Western Frontier were under the control of the Li Witch Palace, the Bear Mountain region was remote and incredibly barren. Even the nearby Centipede Stockade, the strongest local power, wouldn't catch the Li Witch Palace's eye.

He had woken up in the Qingyi River and had never encountered any Li Witch Palace cultivators. Why were they looking for him, and claiming to be searching for an ancient corpse?

Qin Sang suddenly realized that there seemed to be a huge mystery surrounding his arrival in the Wu Shen Continent.

What exactly had happened while he was unconscious?

"You said that after I left, Cultivator Tong brought a stranger to capture you? Did you ever mention to anyone that I had once lost an arm?"

Qin Sang asked.

Among the people he had met after waking up, only Ya Gu and the old witch doctor knew about his severed arm.

Ya Gu was very alert.

When she heard that someone was searching for an ancient corpse with a severed arm, she guessed they were looking for Qin Sang and immediately crushed the Qingfu Coin, but received no response. She then quietly left the Five Venom Sect, using the power of the divine inscription to sneak into the Qingyi River and drift downstream.

She feared Qin Sang, unaware of the danger, might stumble upon his enemies.

She planned to leave messages for Qin Sang at the Thousand Households Village and other places where they had interacted.

Unexpectedly, as she neared the Thousand Households Village, she was caught by Cultivator Tong and his companion.

"No," Ya Gu said, "After you left, Brother Qin, I didn't speak to anyone."

Her voice was weaker than before, and her face suddenly worsened.

"How did they confirm my identity? Could someone have seen me before?"

Qin Sang pondered, frowning.

Cultivator Tong of the Five Venom Sect was only at the early stage of Foundation Establishment. The person he brought with him was actually a mid-stage Foundation Establishment expert, second only to Cui Xuanzi. Such a person wouldn't be unknown in the Five Venom Sect, yet Ya Gu had never seen him before. He was likely a disciple of the Li Witch Palace!

The two of them, having caught up to Ya Gu, saw that she was only at the third level of Qi Refining and became overly confident.

In particular, after the Li Witch Palace disciple snatched the Cold Gold Sword, he became enamored with it.  With his guard down, Ya Gu found an opportunity to attack, unleashing her Devouring Cone.

However, they were both Foundation Establishment experts. Although Ya Gu had the protection of the divine inscription, there was still a significant gap in their strength, and she nearly died from their counterattack.

In the end, Ya Gu only saw Cultivator Tong blown to pieces by the Devouring Cone. She didn't know what became of the Li Witch Palace disciple, but since he hadn't pursued her, his fate was probably also grim.

The two Devouring Cones crafted by Qin Sang were infused with the venomous fangs of a peak Demon Spirit stage Flood Dragon, a poison that even late-stage Foundation Establishment cultivators would find difficult to resist.

"Brother Qin… cough…"

Ya Gu opened her mouth, then suddenly began to cough violently.

Her face was darker than before.  She seemed to have realized something.  She gripped Qin Sang's hand tightly, struggling to keep her eyes open, gazing at him with deep affection, wanting to etch his image into her memory.

Her primordial spirit was rapidly dissipating, and even the potent life force of the Three Lights Jade Liquid couldn't stop it.

Qin Sang's face softened with compassion. He had used the best medicine, but Ya Gu's injuries were too severe, and it was too late.

Looking into Ya Gu's eyes, Qin Sang hesitated for a moment, then said softly, "Ya Gu, I have a secret technique that can temporarily seal your primordial spirit, preventing it from dissipating. But… I don't know if I can undo it in the future. You might become something neither human nor ghost, perhaps even losing your chance at reincarnation forever. Are you… willing?"

Ya Gu didn't hesitate at Qin Sang's words, but instead asked a question that caught him off guard. "Brother Qin, if that's the case, will you keep me by your side?"

Qin Sang was taken aback, then said hoarsely, "Of course, I'll always keep you with me."

"I'm willing," Ya Gu whispered, without a trace of fear.

Qin Sang let out a slow breath and retrieved a Heavenly Corpse Talisman from his Spatial Ring.

The Heavenly Corpse Talisman could kill, but it could also 'save'.

Qin Sang had used it to 'save' Tan Jie, but he never thought he would use it in a similar situation again.

The river flowed, the green mountains stood like painted eyebrows.

Qin Sang held Ya Gu in his arms, his head slightly bowed.  They gazed at each other in silence.

Ya Gu's eyes grew dimmer and dimmer.

Qin Sang sighed softly, about to apply the Heavenly Corpse Talisman.

Suddenly, Ya Gu woke with a start, and with her last bit of strength, she urgently said, "Brother Qin, Granny said, my mother gave me a name, Jin Liuyíng. My name isn't Ya Gu, my name is Jin Liuyíng!"

"Jin Liuyíng, such a beautiful name," Qin Sang said with a smile. "My name is Qin Sang."
