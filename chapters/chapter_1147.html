<h1>Chapter 1139: Bluffing</h1><p>The Demon King Li Hong insisted on meeting the master of the Thousand Bamboo Sea, likely as a test, harboring some suspicions.  </p><p>The reason Qin Sang dared to take such a risk was that he knew they were closely monitoring the situation in the Heavenly Demon Hills. He was already aware that the Feather Demon King had sent Li Hong to contact other demon kings and gather reinforcements.  </p><p>Having spent so much time in the Heavenly Demon Hills, Qin Sang had discerned a pattern: even within the demon race, there existed a balance of power. With the Sin Abyss's forces pressing down on them, the Feather Demon King would not stir up unnecessary trouble or attack other demon kings without reason.  </p><p>This was also why Qin Sang dared to remain in the Thousand Bamboo Sea.  </p><p>As long as it wasn’t under the Feather Demon King’s orders, Demon King Li Hong, with his own reservations, would not dare to act recklessly.  </p><p>Just before Demon King Li Hong appeared, they received news of unusual movements among the beasts of Nine Caverns Mountain. It was likely that Demon King Li Hong had been incited by the Nine Caverns Demon King and was acting on his own.  </p><p>Of course, Qin Sang was well aware that if he failed to form his Nascent Soul soon, this elaborate facade would not last. The lingering prestige of the Thousand Bamboo Sea’s master would gradually fade, and the truth would eventually be exposed.  </p><p>When that day came, it would spell the doom of the Thousand Bamboo Sea.  </p><p>He, along with the Willow Spirit and the Old Monkey, had been preparing an escape route.  </p><p>As a last resort, they would have to abandon the Thousand Bamboo Sea with their trusted followers and flee across the icy seas.  </p><p>“And who is this?”  </p><p>Qin Sang glanced at the white-tailed black fox, his eyes filled with disdain and displeasure.  </p><p>Pretending to be a transformed great demon and bluffing in front of Demon King Li Hong was no small feat, and he felt immense pressure.  </p><p>However, having interacted with more than one late-stage Nascent Soul cultivator in the past, and even faced the terrifying ancient demons, Qin Sang showed no signs of unease in front of Demon King Li Hong.  </p><p>His aura was commanding.  </p><p>“This humble one pays respects to the Demon King!”  </p><p>The white-tailed black fox trembled with fear and hastily bowed.  </p><p>Demon King Li Hong, still suspicious, stared intently at Qin Sang but found no flaws.  </p><p>With two demon kings guarding the Thousand Bamboo Sea, one of whom was the unfathomable Elder Bamboo, he dared not press further. His tone softened as he said, “I never expected to meet a new fellow cultivator today. The Heavenly Demon Hills has gained another demon king—what a joyous occasion! It’s a pity that the Feather Demon King and I were unaware and did not prepare any gifts. Elder Bamboo has truly been hiding his talents, nurturing such a remarkable disciple and only now revealing him to the world…”  </p><p>“I was but a small demon from the Boundless Valley, living in ignorance until my master enlightened me, guiding me onto the right path. By chance, I achieved transformation. Having no acquaintances in the Heavenly Demon Hills, I’ve been secluded in my cave, rarely venturing beyond the Thousand Bamboo Sea…”  </p><p>Qin Sang replied indifferently.  </p><p>“The Boundless Valley?”  </p><p>Demon King Li Hong’s pupils contracted, and he chuckled, “No wonder! I’ve long heard that the Boundless Valley is home to many fellow cultivators, oppressed by humans. For you to earn Elder Bamboo’s favor shows not only your extraordinary talent but also your profound fortune. Meeting you today has made this journey worthwhile.”  </p><p>Qin Sang smiled faintly, “After my transformation, I had intended to visit the Feather Demon King in the Ten Thousand Demon City, but I’ve been occupied and haven’t found the time…”  </p><p>…  </p><p>The meeting concluded on a harmonious note.  </p><p>Qin Sang personally escorted Demon King Li Hong out of the canyon.  </p><p>Returning to the basin, Qin Sang’s smile faded as he flew straight back to his cave.  </p><p>The Willow Spirit and the Old Monkey followed closely behind.  </p><p>Once the cave was sealed, the two demons let out a sigh of relief, their fear still lingering.  </p><p>Seeing Qin Sang’s calm demeanor, as if nothing had happened, they could only marvel at his audacity.  </p><p>“The little ones saw Young Master Qin and thought our Thousand Bamboo Sea now had two great kings guarding it. They were overjoyed, jumping around in excitement, hehe…”  </p><p>The Old Monkey forced a laugh, his voice tinged with bitterness.  </p><p>The Willow Spirit raised a jade slip in his hand and said, “Young Master Qin, the numbers here are comparable to those of the other demon kings.”  </p><p>Qin Sang nodded, “When the time comes, send out the troops according to these numbers—not one less—to avoid giving anyone an excuse to cause trouble. Also, continue monitoring the movements of Nine Caverns Mountain. If they remain restless, we may rely on the grand formation to hold them off temporarily, but it will expose our weakness and attract other ill-intentioned forces to attack us. At that point, we’ll have to prepare for the worst: send your trusted followers to the icy seas, find an iceberg, and endure the harsh conditions until I form my Nascent Soul…”  </p><p>Once their protection was lost, the weaker demons would be at the mercy of others, and the Thousand Bamboo Sea would be plunged into chaos.  </p><p>But Qin Sang’s abilities were limited, and this was all he could do.  </p><p>“Understood!”  </p><p>The two demons replied in unison, and the Old Monkey left to carry out his orders, now treating Qin Sang as the true master of the Thousand Bamboo Sea.  </p><p>“What major event does the Feather Demon King have planned?”  </p><p>The Willow Spirit asked with concern.  </p><p>Qin Sang sneered, “It’s just Demon King Li Hong’s theatrics! If the war intensifies, the Feather Demon King will personally lead the demon kings to reinforce the front. Judging by the current situation, it won’t reach that point for several years. However, this matter is not to be taken lightly for us. The Thousand Bamboo Sea now has two demon kings on the surface, and when the time comes, one of us will have to step forward. If I remain unseen for too long, they will grow suspicious. You must prepare for the possibility that I may fail to form my Nascent Soul…”  </p><p>The Willow Spirit’s face was filled with worry, but he suddenly remembered something and quickly added, “Young Master Qin, I didn’t have time to mention it earlier, but we’ve made some progress regarding Demon King Qianji.”  </p><p>“Oh?”  </p><p>Qin Sang’s eyes lit up, “Have you found news of the stone slab?”  </p><p>“Not quite,”  </p><p>The Willow Spirit replied apologetically, “But we’ve located Demon King Qianji’s cave, as well as two other places that might be his treasure vaults.”  </p><p>“Could it be that Demon King Qianji didn’t store his treasures in his cave? Please elaborate.”  </p><p>Qin Sang asked, surprised.  </p><p>The mysterious stone slab couldn’t be stored in a spatial pouch, so finding the demon king’s treasure vaults gave him a chance.  </p><p>The Willow Spirit nodded, “Demon King Qianji’s cave is at the bottom of the Ten Thousand Serpents Abyss. Although it’s not entirely inhabited by serpent demons, infiltrating the abyss was no small feat. Near his cave, we discovered two hidden chambers, heavily guarded. We only dared to observe from a distance. Demon King Qianji, being a Black-Spotted Serpent who attained the Dao, is cunning and suspicious by nature. We suspect that the treasures he’s collected may not be stored in his cave, and those two chambers might also be his vaults…”  </p><p>“Three treasure vaults, each with its own traps and guards constantly on watch…”  </p><p>Qin Sang frowned, feeling the situation was increasingly棘手.  </p><p>His goal was simple: to activate the shadow within the stone slab and visualize the true Azure Phoenix. He didn’t need to steal the slab itself.  </p><p>According to Qin Sang’s original plan, he would find an opportunity to infiltrate Demon King Qianji’s cave, use his Heavenly Eye technique to forcibly break the vault’s restrictions, take a quick look, and leave.  </p><p>Even if Demon King Qianji noticed, Qin Sang wouldn’t lose much, and the demon king might not pursue him relentlessly.  </p><p>Given Demon King Qianji’s suspicious nature, it was unlikely that his underlings knew which vault was real, making it difficult to trace back to Qin Sang.  </p><p>With three vaults, he would have to infiltrate each one.  </p><p>If he guessed wrong and was discovered midway, the guards would surely tighten their defenses.  </p><p>He only had one chance.</p>
