<h1>Chapter 2212: The Search Continues</h1><p>Endless wind and sand lashed at them.</p><p>Qin Sang and Liuli flew straight ahead. Suddenly, Qin Sang stopped, sensing for a moment before saying, "I perceive a strange energy fluctuation, over there…"</p><p>He pointed, and immediately changed direction with Liuli, flying towards the source of the fluctuation.</p><p>After a few breaths, they landed on a mountaintop, overlooking the mountain foot.</p><p>Below was a large crater, which seemed to have once been a lake, but was now completely dry.</p><p>The lakebed was composed of hard rock, with some kind of spirit ore beneath. The storm had only eroded the surface of the rock, leaving behind knife-like scratches that emitted a blue glow.</p><p>In the center of the lakebed was a square stone hole, like a deep well, also shimmering with an inner glow. The well's opening was too regular to be naturally formed, and white vapor was constantly erupting from it.</p><p>The vapor was heavy, clustering around the well's opening after erupting, with a 'pop, pop, pop' sound emanating from within.</p><p>The two quickly discerned the situation: the vapor wasn't real, but a manifestation of a formation's power. There was clearly an ancient formation in the well, possibly even a hidden realm. But this ancient formation was crumbling, and the realm within it had likely collapsed as well.</p><p>Qin Sang's figure flickered, appearing at the well's opening before unhesitatingly entering it, while Liuli waited outside.</p><p>Before long, Qin Sang returned, shaking his head slightly at Liuli.  It was a complete mess inside; he hadn't found anything valuable.</p><p>Using some remaining clues, they compared their findings to the texts they had previously studied, discovering that this place wasn't recorded in any of them.</p><p>This was normal. This area could be described as a large hidden realm, but within the realm, countless smaller realms were scattered throughout. The area was vast and extremely complex, making it impossible for any single sect to control everything.  Besides the common goal of the Chunqiu Gui, each sect also pursued their own objectives. Most chose one or several places for in-depth exploration, moving on after a thorough investigation.</p><p>They still hadn't explored all the hidden realms.  Ziyun Mountain's understanding of this area was limited to the places they had explored.</p><p>Initially, the various sects could avoid interference. However, as time passed, fewer unexplored hidden realms remained, and competition intensified. Conflicts between sects consequently increased, and Ziyun Mountain, practicing Buddhism, clashed with the Daoist sects, leading to early marginalization.</p><p>Unable to pinpoint their location, Qin Sang and Liuli continued with their original plan. While they hadn't found much, this discovery proved that hidden realms still existed. Their target was one of the most mysterious places within this entire realm, and they were determined to persevere.</p><p>They didn't linger, continuing to fly forward for a whole day. According to their estimates, their destination wasn't far.</p><p>Along the way, they encountered two more waves of beast herds. These were different species, but none of the herds contained anything similar to the Sky Serpent General. Though curious, they prioritized their objective and didn't divert their search.</p><p>Qin Sang also sensed the aura of other cultivators in the distance.</p><p>As they deliberately avoided them, the others didn't pursue, and both parties remained unharmed.</p><p>After flying over several mountain ranges, Qin Sang looked ahead, thinking to himself, "Finally!"</p><p>They had made their estimations as broad as possible. As long as their direction was correct, their target would surely be within this area.  Before them lay a boundless wasteland, desolate and severely ravaged by the storm, lacking any distinguishing features.</p><p>This scene gave them a bad feeling. They searched thoroughly, and their apprehension proved correct.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>Qin Sang chose a hill in the center, descending and sitting cross-legged. He then flicked his fingers, sending out several streams of light that transformed into formation flags, which he planted around him.</p><p>Mist rose, concealing both Qin Sang and the hill.</p><p>After setting up the spirit formation, Qin Sang activated the Qianjun Ring. As the spiritual light flickered, a mountain appeared above his head: Mount Daiyu!</p><p>According to Master Ning, within a thousand-li radius of the mountain's spiritual energy, as long as Qin Sang summoned Mount Daiyu and activated it with a secret technique, even if the spiritual energy was sealed by a formation, Mount Daiyu would react, allowing him to pinpoint the exact location of the mountain's essence. This was due to the mysterious connection between the five sacred mountains. The mountain's spiritual energy had an unparalleled attraction to all five mountains.</p><p>Qin Sang closed his eyes and continuously cast hand seals. The surface of Mount Daiyu shone with a green light, yet remained completely unresponsive.</p><p>With a light sigh, Qin Sang opened his eyes, putting away the mountain and formation flags, and flew back the way they came.</p><p>"We may have gone the wrong way…"</p><p>Qin Sang said.</p><p>He looked at Liuli with a questioning gaze. Ever since witnessing the celestial phenomenon caused by the Chunqiu Gui, Liuli had been deep in thought.</p><p>According to the time of the Great Thousand World, it had been barely two days since they entered the storm, but here, day and night had already changed ten times.</p><p>By observing the celestial phenomena caused by the daily alternation of day and night, one can calculate the position of the Chunqiu Gui.  Liuli has been diligently calculating.</p><p>Finding the Chunqiu Gui will allow us to use other methods to determine our location and thus pinpoint our target's position, serving as a backup plan. Ten cycles have passed, so Liuli should have the results soon.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist, follow me..."</p><p>At that moment, Liuli's expression shifted slightly.  Suddenly, she soared into the air and flew off.</p><p>Qin Sang immediately followed. Seeing Liuli's furrowed brow as she was concentrating on her calculations, Qin Sang didn't disturb her. Instead, she took out the talisman left by the E-hook tribe ancestor and examined it.</p><p>The last time she entered the Heart Lake, the talisman showed a brief anomaly before returning to normal.</p><p>Qin Sang now understands that the talisman was secretly tampered with by Hongtian and others. The tokens left by the ancestors of various tribes in the Sacred Land are similar to the protective seals, guiding them here.</p><p>These tokens have been on their persons all along.  They had no idea when Hongtian and his allies interfered.</p><p>This time, before entering the Heart Lake, Hongtian removed the seal, and the talisman guided them here.</p><p>However, after entering the storm, perhaps because the time wasn't right, the talisman fell silent again.</p><p>When the guidance reappears, the most intense struggle will begin!</p><p>Of course, before that time comes, everyone won't be idle.  Finding it first and gaining the upper hand would be a significant advantage.  Hongtian and the Jiaojiao tribe chief have both passed down methods for searching. The Yuanxiang tribe chief and several others are currently trying them.  Presumably, everyone else is doing the same.</p><p>Qin Sang notices something intriguing.</p><p>Hongtian fears the Tang…  tribe, but the Yuanxiang tribe chief and others are also guided by their ancestors.  Hongtian fears the former but doesn't oppose the latter; he even wants to win them over. What is the reason for this?</p><p>What is the difference between the two?</p><p>Qin Sang recalls what she learned from the Tang… tribe.  The ancestors behind them, including herself, all ascended to the Sacred Realm and entered the Sacred Land within the last few tens of thousands of years.</p><p>But long, long ago, various tribes had legends about these "tokens," indicating that the ancestors left them when the Sacred Land was first created.</p><p>This means that there is not only a struggle between new and old among the Sacred Realm powerhouses, but also potentially different factions among the older powerhouses.</p><p>Who are allies and who are enemies among these parties?</p><p>Is being drawn into the struggle between the Sacred Realm powerhouses good or bad? Will she ultimately escape unscathed?</p><p>The more Qin Sang thinks, the more complicated it becomes.  Unable to step outside the chessboard and become a player, she can only guess at the overall situation.</p><p>While pondering, Qin Sang senses a change in Liuli's aura. Turning her gaze, she sees Liuli's eyes shining brightly as she suddenly looks up.</p><p>At that moment, the surrounding darkness slowly recedes, and a white light appears on the horizon.</p><p>There is no sun, only pure white light.  Because of the storm, it appears grayish-white. The light's source is unknown, but it dissipates the darkness.</p><p>"Found it!"</p><p>Liuli, facing the source of the white light, increases her speed.</p><p>They chase the light, flying constantly.</p><p>Whether the Chunqiu Gui is moving or Liuli's calculations have some error, they change direction several times, though not by much.</p><p>Finally, the result becomes clearer. They successfully locate the Chunqiu Gui!</p><p>As they approach, Liuli stops, her eyes fixed on the sky.</p><p>This is another day-night transition. As the curtain of darkness slowly rises, gradually covering the light above them, and they stand at the boundary of night and day, Liuli looks away and stares ahead.</p><p>At the same time, Qin Sang feels a strange, indescribable sensation.</p><p>"Go!"</p><p>The two rush towards the direction Liuli is looking. Soon, they see white clouds appearing within the storm.</p><p>The clouds gather high in the sky, unmoved by the violent storm.  In the center of the clouds, more clouds are forming, continuously emerging from within, like a blossoming white lotus.</p><p>They don't see the Chunqiu Gui, but they are certain that this cloud formation is related to it!</p><p>Suddenly, Qin Sang stops, halting Liuli, and gazes into the distance with a serious expression. After a moment, three figures appear in the distance, their auras familiar—Zhan Yan and others.</p><p>"Zhan Yan, Xu Mu, Jing Zhen…"</p><p>Qin Sang glances over and discovers that Zhang Yan, the most hot-tempered one, is absent. Only Zhan Yan and two others are present.</p><p>"When did they get together?"</p><p>Qin Sang remembers that Zhan Yan and the others were approached by different factions. Zhan Yan joined the Jiao people, while Jing Zhen and Xu Mu were with other tribes.</p><p>On second thought, perhaps she and Liuli are simply late.</p><p>Zhan Yan and the others surely realized the celestial phenomenon stemmed from the power of the Chunqiu Gui.  If they weren’t preoccupied with something more important, they would have sought out the Chunqiu Gui immediately. It seems likely that the three of them converged this way.</p><p>The three arrived together from elsewhere, indicating the Chunqiu Gui is mobile, not fixed in one location.</p><p>At this moment, Zhan Yan and his companions spotted Qin Sang and Liuli.  The three altered their course and flew directly toward them.</p><p>Qin Sang and Liuli retracted their protective auras and watched as Zhan Yan’s group positioned themselves between them and Bai Yun.</p><p>“Master Qin!  Immortal Liuli!”</p><p>Zhan Yan bowed, getting straight to the point.  “Considering our previous collaboration, we don’t wish to become enemies. Please leave.”</p><p>Qin Sang’s gaze swept across the three, understanding their alliance had already formed, excluding her and Liuli.</p><p>“The Chunqiu Gui is a post-heaven spiritual treasure. Without the spirit’s acceptance, no one can take it.  Do you truly believe occupying this place will allow you to claim it?” Qin Sang scoffed.</p><p>“Master Qin, observe your surroundings…”</p><p>Zhan Yan gazed around, calmly stating, “The sacred grounds are in upheaval, the sacred realm destroyed! Even if powerful practitioners from the Yi Ren clan can repair the sacred grounds in the future, this place is unlikely to recover.  Would the Chunqiu Gui willingly remain in these ruins?”</p><p>Qin Sang and Liuli’s expressions hardened; his words held merit.</p><p>Zhan Yan’s intentions were clear: even if they couldn't claim the Chunqiu Gui's allegiance, there might be other ways to remove it.  Getting it back to their sect, they could eventually subdue its spirit. Qin Sang knew of a secret technique, utilizing the blood-tainted light of the Wu Jian Blood Mulberry—these major sects certainly wouldn't lack such methods.</p><p>“Oh?” Qin Sang’s expression remained unchanged. “There’s only one treasure.  After driving us away, how will the three of you divide it?”</p><p>Zhan Yan remained unfazed by Qin Sang’s provocation. “Master Qin needn’t worry. We are well-acquainted and have our own method of distribution. Even if the three sects share it, that’s acceptable.”</p><p>“Then why not four sects?” Liuli said coldly.</p><p>Zhan Yan and the others remained silent, their attitude clear.</p><p>“Come out!”</p><p>Suddenly, Zhan Yan shouted, his fingers forming a sword, striking the ground.</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>The ground cracked, and a sword beam forced a figure from beneath.  This person didn't flee, but flew upwards, revealing their form.</p><p>Upon seeing the person, Zhan Yan and his companions’ faces changed, and surprise flickered in Qin Sang’s eyes.</p><p>They expected the arrival of the missing Zhang Yan, hoping to watch them fight, but it was an Yi Ren cultivator!</p><p>“Master Qin, what a coincidence,” the newcomer, Yu Zhen, bowed to Qin Sang, smiling.</p><p>“You lured him here!”</p><p>Zhan Yan and the others erupted in fury.</p><p>In their previous collaboration, they agreed the Chunqiu Gui was a Daoist treasure and couldn’t be leaked.  If it fell into the hands of the Yi Ren clan, they couldn’t explain it to their sect.</p><p>Yet Qin Sang and her companion dared to collude with an outsider!</p><p>Qin Sang looked at Yu Zhen, her gaze flickering.  “Your concealment technique is remarkable. You weren’t tracking us here, were you?”</p><p>“I must thank this fellow traveler for guiding me,” Yu Zhen gestured towards Jing Zhen, calmly stating.</p><p>Jing Zhen’s face stiffened, glaring at Yu Zhen, eyes blazing.</p><p>“What are your intentions? Aren't you afraid of being killed here?” Qin Sang demanded.</p><p>“I've heard rumors that although you are all Daoist disciples, you’re not harmonious. I worried Master Qin might encounter trouble, so I took the liberty of intervening, to prevent them from harming you,” Yu Zhen said calmly, acting as though he was concerned for Qin Sang.</p><p>He didn't look at Bai Yun.  “I have no ill intentions. If Master Qin thinks this is unnecessary, I shall leave. Oh, almost forgot…I wonder if this person is useful to you, Master Qin. I happen to know their location.  If you wish to rescue them, I will tell you.”</p><p>Yu Zhen conjured a figure—Zhang Yan.</p><p>“We didn't intend to harm this person. We merely asked a fellow traveler to follow him, but he ran into trouble himself…”</p>
