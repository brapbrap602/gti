<h1>Chapter 1273: Unexpected Gains</h1><p>The soul token had shattered.</p><p>Daoist Chongyi had sacrificed himself for the Dao.</p><p>In silence, the group sealed the Blood Lake.</p><p>"Fellow Daoists, please accept our condolences and take care of yourselves," acquaintances comforted Si Di and Yao Jing.</p><p>Both were Nascent Soul cultivators. Though their hearts were heavy with grief, they maintained their composure, nodding silently.</p><p>Everyone was deeply moved by Daoist Chongyi's sacrifice and promised to personally attend his memorial at the Taiyi Alchemy Sect to bid him farewell.</p><p>"Daoist Chongyi has transcended mortality, while we still struggle in this mortal world," sighed the Nether Demon Lord. "The Sin Abyss remains a dire threat. Although we failed to obtain the Jade Bone this time, we first destroyed the incarnation of the Old Demon Ye and then severely wounded the Old Ghost Tianzheng. Our achievements are remarkable, and now is the best time to counterattack. I will head to the Celestial Plateau to discuss this matter with Daoist Zhenyi."</p><p>As he spoke, the Nether Demon Lord's gaze lingered on Qin Sang and Qing Jun.</p><p>Qin Sang and Qing Jun exchanged a glance and nodded. "We share the same intention!"</p><p>The chaos in the North Star Realm had persisted for too long. Such a situation was detrimental to the development of sects and hindered peaceful cultivation.</p><p>The Nether Demon Lord was delighted and repeatedly praised their decision. "If you have no urgent matters, make your arrangements quickly and join us. A great battle is imminent. It would be best to achieve a decisive victory in one fell swoop and completely extinguish the Sin Abyss's arrogance!"</p><p>Everyone agreed.</p><p>After the Blood Lake was sealed, it remained stable, with no signs of the monster attempting to break the seal.</p><p>"For now, there's no need to worry about the monster escaping the Blood Lake, but we must remain vigilant. In the future, each major sect should send disciples into the valley to take turns guarding it, just in case. What do you think?"</p><p>Someone proposed this, and everyone agreed without objection. The surviving Golden Core cultivators, all core disciples of major sects, were quickly selected, and two were assigned to guard the area.</p><p>The Nether Demon Lord left first, heading directly to the Celestial Plateau.</p><p>The others dispersed, returning to their respective sects to prepare for battle.</p><p>Dongyang Bo accompanied the Nether Demon Lord.</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang knew that there would be no opportunity to secretly deal with Dongyang Bo in the short term, so he stopped wasting energy on it. However, necessary precautions were still essential.</p><p>As they parted, the other Nascent Soul cultivators deliberately bid farewell to Qin Sang and Qing Jun, and Qin Sang responded to each in turn.</p><p>Bing Han and Xiang Qing lingered behind.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Leng has always been enigmatic, so I'm not surprised. But I didn't expect Fellow Daoist Qin to be so formidable! Your disguise technique is truly remarkable. When Fellow Daoist Xiang and I spent a few days with you at the Divine Peak, we couldn't detect the slightest flaw."</p><p>Bing Han's beautiful eyes sparkled as she chided him, "I remember you said you would visit the Void Spirit Sect. I've been waiting for a long time, but you never showed up. Was that just empty talk?"</p><p>Qin Sang quickly replied, "How could I deceive you? I've been busy refining spiritual fire and haven't had the time. Once the battle is over, I will definitely visit."</p><p>Refining the scorched wood to nurture Yun Youzi's spirit and crafting a treasure to collect the South Ming Flame both required advanced artifact forging techniques.</p><p>Working in isolation would yield little. Qin Sang had long coveted the Void Spirit Sect's forging techniques and needed to figure out how to trade for them with Bing Han.</p><p>Bing Han nodded in satisfaction. "Then I will prepare fine wine and delicacies, awaiting your esteemed presence."</p><p>Next, Xiang Qing came over to exchange a few pleasantries before leaving with Bing Han.</p><p>Watching them depart, Qin Sang sent a mental message to Qing Jun, "Senior Sister, how much do you know about Bing Han and Xiang Qing?"</p><p>"The Void Spirit Sect has gained the second most benefits from the Three Realms War, second only to the Taiyi Alchemy Sect. Bing Han understands the principle of not flaunting wealth and keeps a low profile, skillfully navigating relationships, which is why she doesn't attract much attention. However, this woman is not simple. It seems she has been secretly planning something, and her words just now were laden with meaning. Both you and Xiang Qing are skilled in fire control, which might be why she deliberately befriended you."</p><p>Qing Jun, observing coldly, saw things clearly.</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't afraid of Bing Han's schemes. If she had ulterior motives, it would be easier to make a deal.</p><p>At this moment, Jing Yu suggested returning to her former cave for a look.</p><p>Qin Sang persuaded Jing Yu to first accompany them to the Yuan Shen Sect, which was very safe. She could refine the Corpse Flower Blood Amber there and seek a breakthrough.</p><p>Qing Jun said, "I was just thinking of finding a place to rest. You go ahead, and I'll find a cave nearby to wait for your return."</p><p>Jing Yu and her son left on their own.</p><p>Qin Sang stayed behind to protect Qing Jun.</p><p>Outside the cave.</p><p>Qin Sang paced back and forth, occasionally glancing at the cave, frowning slightly.</p><p>He wasn't sure if Qing Jun had overexerted herself during the battle with the Old Demon Ye or if her injuries were too severe to suppress. She had to enter seclusion to recuperate before even leaving the Endless Valley.</p><p>The situation had been too chaotic earlier, and he hadn't noticed anything unusual about Qing Jun.</p><p>Recalling carefully, since leaving the Blood Pool, the mysterious aura around Qing Jun seemed to have diminished slightly.</p><p>This feeling was elusive and hard to describe. Qin Sang couldn't be sure if it was just his imagination.</p><p>"Could it be that the Azure Phoenix was severely injured, causing a backlash?"</p><p>Qin Sang had witnessed the destruction of the Azure Phoenix puppet. At the time, Qing Jun, under the alias of Granny Jing, effortlessly summoned another one. He had thought that the Azure Phoenix's injury wouldn't affect her much.</p><p>However, the Azure Phoenix puppet now possessed strength comparable to a transformed demon beast. It must have taken immense effort and possibly some secret technique for Qing Jun to refine it. It couldn't be compared to the puppet from back then.</p><p>"Truly father and daughter, cut from the same cloth," Qin Sang thought, recalling how Senior Qingzhu had also stubbornly endured severe injuries.</p><p>Not long after, Jing Yu and Fat Chicken returned.</p><p>Qin Sang had already removed the restrictions on Fat Chicken. The mother and son seemed to have endless things to talk about.</p><p>After waiting for another two hours.</p><p>Qing Jun emerged from seclusion. Meeting Qin Sang's gaze, she knew what he was worried about and said, "I'm fine, but the Azure Phoenix is severely damaged and can't be summoned for battle in the near future. I'll have to rely on the Five Directions Tower."</p><p>...</p><p>The two humans and two demons flew straight out of the Endless Valley, returning to the Yuan Shen Sect.</p><p>Bai was still in seclusion, and it was unclear when he would comprehend the Bone Curse and the Corpse Soul Pearl to advance to a Corpse King.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't disturb Bai.</p><p>After selecting a cave to settle Jing Yu and her son, Qin Sang returned to his own cave.</p><p>On the way back, Qin Sang had consulted Qing Jun about the art of puppetry and gained a lot.</p><p>Qing Jun taught him several secret techniques for controlling puppets.</p><p>She also shared what she knew about the Shangyuan Pure Palace and the Nascent Soul Talisman Puppet, though the information might not be entirely accurate, leaving it to Qin Sang to discern.</p><p>The Nascent Soul Talisman Puppet possessed strength comparable to a mid-stage Nascent Soul cultivator. However, none of the past patriarchs of the Shangyuan Pure Palace had been able to tame it, only managing to suppress it within the sect.</p><p>Qing Jun advised Qin Sang not to set his hopes too high on the talisman puppet.</p><p>Her expertise in puppetry might not surpass that of the Shangyuan Pure Palace's past patriarchs, so it would be difficult to find a way to subdue the talisman puppet. She could only do her best.</p><p>The best outcome would likely be the same as the Shangyuan Pure Palace'sâ€”keeping it within the sect as a guardian puppet.</p><p>However, after discovering the Nascent Soul Talisman Puppet's more peculiar uses, Qin Sang's focus had already shifted away from the puppet itself.</p><p>When he inspected the talisman puppet and tried to sense the residual soul shadow within, he was pleasantly surprised to find that he could experience a trace of the original cultivator's state of mind.</p><p>The Shangyuan Pure Palace's past patriarchs included many mid-stage Nascent Soul experts.</p><p>Could there be a mid-stage Nascent Soul soul shadow within the talisman puppet?</p>
