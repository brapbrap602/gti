<h1>Chapter 1492: The Stone Stele </h1><p>Deep within the Sacred Ground.</p><p>Darkness was so thick it could not be dispersed.</p><p>There were no floating mountains here; the void was filled with terrifying, invisible turbulence. A single moment of carelessness would result in being swept away by the currents, torn to shreds.</p><p>Nascent Soul cultivators entering this place had to carefully maneuver and evade.</p><p>Within the darkness, several figures moved through the turbulence. Leading them were Elder Hunmo and Great Sage Tianpeng.</p><p>"Are you certain that a stone stele could remain intact in a place like this?"</p><p>Great Sage Tianpeng's gaze was sharp, scanning every inch of the dark zone, his tone filled with doubt.</p><p>This place was too chaotic.</p><p>The destructive power of the turbulence was incomparable to that outside; it was the source of the chaos.</p><p>One could imagine that even if the floating mountains from outside were to drift in, they would not withstand the impact of the turbulence. Within a short time, they would be torn apart and reduced to ashes.</p><p>Perhaps floating mountains had existed here before, only to be annihilated.</p><p>They had entered this place, searching everywhere, and had not found a single object with a physical form.</p><p>Yet, Elder Hunmo wanted them to find a stele in such a place.</p><p>"The information I received indeed mentions such a stone stele, serving as a kind of marker. Such a thing, of course, could not be destroyed by mere turbulence."</p><p>Elder Hunmo scanned back and forth, replying with certainty.</p><p>"Since you know of the stele's existence, are you unaware of what's inside?" Great Sage Tianpeng looked at Elder Hunmo with a scrutinizing gaze, questioning his previous words.</p><p>Elder Hunmo chuckled, "I originally didn't want to alert the enemy. My plan was to infiltrate the Sacred Ground alone, quietly investigate, and verify the truth of the information. I would wait until the next time the Profound Sky Palace opened the Sacred Ground to make further plans. But because of an unexpected discovery, I am sixty percent sure that this matter is true, and now I've increased it to one hundred percent!"</p><p>"An unexpected discovery? You mean that spirit-mushroom scepter, right?"</p><p>Great Sage Tianpeng became even more suspicious of his words. He felt that Elder Hunmo was concealing crucial information. After entering the Sacred Ground, Elder Hunmo had put away the treasure, which was clearly unusual.</p><p>"If this treasure originated from the Sacred Ground, its purpose wouldn't be just to guide us to the Sacred Ground's location, would it?"</p><p>"Nothing escapes the Great Sage's discerning eye."</p><p>Elder Hunmo glanced at Great Sage Tianpeng, his expression calm.</p><p>He turned his head to look behind, not finding any pursuers. After a moment's hesitation, he waved his hand to set up an isolating restriction and cautiously took out an object.</p><p>It was the spirit-mushroom scepter.</p><p>At this moment, the spirit-mushroom scepter was wrapped in a small sphere condensed from demonic energy.</p><p>Elder Hunmo didn't make any movements, yet the spirit-mushroom scepter was trembling frequently. The intense treasure light almost pierced through the demonic energy, dispelling the darkness.</p><p>One could imagine that if Elder Hunmo hadn't sealed it with demonic energy, the spirit-mushroom scepter would be as dazzling as the moon in the dark night.</p><p>Seeing this scene, Great Sage Tianpeng's eyes flashed, and he vaguely guessed something.</p><p>"Why isn't the Profound Sky Palace chasing us?" Elder Hunmo showed the spirit-mushroom scepter to Great Sage Tianpeng for a moment before immediately putting it away, asking a question in return.</p><p>Before Great Sage Tianpeng could speak,</p><p>Elder Hunmo answered his own question, "The Sacred Ground has always been occupied by the Profound Sky Palace. Presumably, the successive generations of experts from the Profound Sky Palace have already explored it countless times, believing that we cannot possibly obtain anything. They are leisurely waiting outside, waiting to see us make fools of ourselves. If I were to release the spirit-mushroom scepter now, and the Profound Sky Palace saw the anomaly..."</p><p>Elder Hunmo paused, not continuing further.</p><p>But everyone present understood what would happen.</p><p>The Profound Sky Palace could tolerate them because they were certain that they did not understand the Sacred Ground and would inevitably return empty-handed. Once they discovered that they possessed a treasure related to the Sacred Ground, they would spare no effort to seize it!</p><p>Engaging in a life-or-death battle with the Profound Sky Palace at this moment was not their wish.</p><p>Elder Hunmo preferred to seal the spirit-mushroom scepter first, patiently searching for the stone stele. Then, he would release the treasure and see what changes it would trigger.</p><p>Even if the Profound Sky Palace noticed it then, their opponents would be one step behind them.</p><p>This was a move of maturity.</p><p>Great Sage Tianpeng nodded slightly, no longer speaking, accepting this explanation.</p><p>Elder Hunmo said meaningfully, "Great Sage seems to be very wary of Yin Changsheng. Did you initiate the war between the two realms to test Yin Changsheng?"</p><p>Great Sage Tianpeng snorted but did not refute, tacitly acknowledging it.</p><p>Elder Hunmo's face showed curiosity, "When my cultivation reached its peak, Yin Changsheng had already retreated from the public eye, rarely appearing. I can't say I understand him. I heard that Great Sage Nine-Heads became famous even earlier than Yin Changsheng. You should have interacted with him, right?"</p><p>"Senior Nine-Heads also wanted to lead our clan out of the Demon Realm."</p><p>Great Sage Tianpeng's face was filled with impatience.</p><p>These words were equivalent to exposing his own shortcomings, boosting the morale of others, and diminishing his own prestige.</p><p>Everyone exchanged glances, surprised.</p><p>Great Sage Nine-Heads was known for his indifferent temperament in the Northern Sea, yet he was forced!</p><p>Everyone's curiosity instantly reached its peak.</p><p>What exactly happened back then that made Great Sage Nine-Heads endure until now?</p><p>Great Sage Tianpeng looked annoyed, unwilling to explain.</p><p>The others were reluctant to press him, so they could only suppress their curiosity.</p><p>"It seems I underestimated this Palace Master of the Profound Sky Palace. It's fortunate that I invited the Great Sage to come along."</p><p>Elder Hunmo noticed the strange expressions on the others' faces and chuckled, "Fellow Daoists, there's no need to worry too much. The Sacred Ground has been leaked, yet Yin Changsheng has been hiding in the treasure carriage, acting like a coward. There must be a reason for this. The Great Sage and I have long speculated that Yin Changsheng's condition is not right. He should be trapped in some kind of predicament, unable to act."</p><p>As he spoke, Elder Hunmo looked around.</p><p>General Gui, Demon King Huangmei, Fairy Yuyi, Bi Fang...</p><p>All the famous demonic figures of the Northern Sea were present.</p><p>"Since the Profound Sky Palace hasn't chased us, let's split up and search, and find the stone stele as soon as possible. Everyone, be careful and beware of experts from the Profound Sky Palace lurking in the shadows."</p><p>Great Sage Tianpeng followed closely behind Elder Hunmo, still not trusting him.</p><p>Elder Hunmo was unconcerned.</p><p>The group split up, forming pairs to search in the endless dark turbulence.</p><p>...</p><p>The Cleansing Pool.</p><p>An unknown amount of time passed.</p><p>Qin Sang's tightly closed eyes slowly opened, his eyes filled with blood. However, his gaze held a sense of relief.</p><p>Towards the end, the intense pain in his body gradually subsided.</p><p>"I finally made it through."</p><p>Qin Sang felt a surge of joy.</p><p>He found himself still in the empty void. The shimmering lights around him were no different from before, but that strange power had completely disappeared, not a trace remaining.</p><p>Presumably, he had absorbed it all.</p><p>Qin Sang took a deep breath, moving his body slightly, his brow unconsciously furrowing.</p><p>He focused his mind and looked inward.</p><p>The increase in his cultivation was not significant, as the true function of the Cleansing Pool was not for that.</p><p>When he comprehended his Nascent Soul, he had a feeling that his Nascent Soul had become lighter than before, as if it had shed a heavy shackle. It had undergone a kind of transformation amidst the pain, yet it was more stable.</p><p>The Cleansing Pool, could it refer to the Nascent Soul's body?</p><p>"I wonder how much my cultivation speed will increase?"</p><p>This thought flashed through Qin Sang's mind, but he did not rush to leave the Cleansing Pool to try it out.</p><p>He turned his body and looked down.</p><p>He had promised Liuli to help her retrieve the treasure; he couldn't go back on his word.</p><p>As far as his vision could reach, the void was incredibly deep. The five-colored lights were everywhere, and even the Heavenly Eye Divine Ability could not see through the depths of the Cleansing Pool.</p><p>Qin Sang checked his condition. There were no obvious injuries to his meridians, and his Nascent Soul was normal. Only the true essence in his Sea of Qi had not yet calmed down. The intense pain had not caused him any serious harm.</p><p>Qin Sang took a medicinal pill, paused for a moment to recover, and then slowly dived towards the bottom of the pool.</p><p>The seemingly narrow Cleansing Pool was exceptionally deep.</p><p>The five-colored lights changed constantly around Qin Sang. He felt as if he had fallen into a colorful kaleidoscope, unable to distinguish between reality and illusion.</p><p>Qin Sang descended rapidly. After a while, he suddenly stopped and stared down.</p><p>The five-colored lights were still present here, but there was a more dangerous aura. Qin Sang's gaze swept across the lights, finally fixing on the point where the lights converged.</p><p>"Ancient restrictions."</p><p>Qin Sang saw the clue and realized he was in the right place.</p><p>Back then, Liuli's master, Bingyao, had passed through this place and discovered the treasure at the bottom of the Cleansing Pool.</p><p>Qin Sang had not cultivated the Ice Soul Divine Light, so he could only search slowly.</p><p>He summoned the Heavenly Eye Butterfly and fully activated his divine ability, gazing down.</p><p>His vision pierced through the five-colored lights, but all he saw were layers upon layers of ancient restrictions.</p><p>After thinking for a moment, Qin Sang summoned the Gold-Sinking Sword and unleashed a streak of sword energy.</p><p>The sword energy slowly descended.</p><p>This was just a probe. Qin Sang was still inside the Cleansing Pool and dared not act recklessly.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the ancient restrictions easily swallowed the sword energy, showing no reaction.</p><p>Qin Sang increased his power, unleashing three more sword strikes in succession.</p><p>He did this with another purpose in mind: to try and contact Liuli.</p><p>Liuli had been waiting at the Gluttonous Lake. If the restrictions between the two places were connected, she should be able to sense the movement here and send back a signal. It would be much easier to find the treasure afterward.</p><p>Unfortunately, things didn't go as planned. Qin Sang didn't receive Liuli's response and had to dive down alone.</p><p>The deeper he went, the denser the ancient restrictions became.</p><p>The five-colored lights here were extremely dazzling. Countless ancient restrictions were fused into a single ray of light, pulling one would affect the whole.</p><p>Bingyao had exhausted all her strength back then, only managing to break through a part of it before returning in defeat.</p><p>Given enough time, with the help of the Heavenly Eye Butterfly, Qin Sang might be able to break through the layers of ancient restrictions and reach the deepest part.</p><p>But now, he had to attack from time to time, forcibly breaking the restrictions.</p><p>The counterattacks from the ancient restrictions also became more fierce.</p><p>Qin Sang acted cautiously, activating the Wish-Fulfilling Pearl and protecting himself with a罡罩. Still feeling insecure, he summoned the demonic fire and condensed a fire armor around his body.</p><p>...</p><p>At the bottom of the Gluttonous Lake.</p><p>Around Liuli, layers of light walls formed a cage-like scene.</p><p>She stayed here, not making any rash moves, patiently waiting.</p><p>Just then,</p><p>Liuli seemed to sense something. Her expression shifted slightly, and she turned her head to look at a light wall.</p><p>She sensed fluctuations coming from behind the light wall.</p><p>The fluctuations were very slight, but they were completely different from the suction force, most likely caused by Qin Sang breaking the restrictions.</p><p>There was indeed a connection between the Cleansing Pool and the Gluttonous Lake!</p><p>The ghostly blue light flashed in Liuli's eyes. She activated the Ice Soul Divine Light, eroding the light wall, approaching the direction from which the fluctuations came.</p><p>The Gluttonous Lake was also unfathomably deep.</p><p>The ancient restrictions here were not as tight as those in the Cleansing Pool. Liuli, without any major incidents, discovered that she had unknowingly reached the edge of the Gluttonous Lake.</p><p>She frowned slightly. After careful observation, she discovered that there was an extremely hidden cave entrance on the stone wall in front of her, only large enough for one person to enter.</p><p>Fortunately, there was no suction force inside the cave.</p><p>Liuli hesitated for a moment, then flashed into the cave. She saw that it was intricate and complex, with countless passages. At the depths of the cave, there was also a suction force.</p><p>Following the fluctuations of the restrictions, Liuli, in order to avoid the suction force, went through countless forks in the road. Finally, she felt a strange sensation, originating from the Ice Soul Divine Light.</p><p>"This is it!"</p><p>Liuli immediately sat down cross-legged and, according to the method taught by her master, tried to use the Ice Soul Divine Light to activate that treasure.</p><p>Back then, Bingyao discovered that by activating the Ice Soul Divine Light according to a certain pattern, she could cause that treasure to resonate with it, creating a subtle connection, using it as a guide.</p><p>According to Bingyao's plan, she needed to continue breaking through the restrictions, until she could influence the Cleansing Pool, coordinating from both inside and outside to help the person in the Cleansing Pool retrieve the treasure.</p><p>However, Qin Sang had the ability to retrieve the treasure on his own.</p><p>Liuli could save her energy and only needed to guide Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang had already dived to a great depth, struggling forward, but still hadn't found his target.</p><p>He had stirred up the ancient restrictions into a mess, making it difficult to distinguish directions. Without guidance, finding the treasure here was as difficult as ascending to heaven.</p><p>His previous worries had come true. Qin Sang suspected that the treasure had already shifted position. Fortunately, he had enough Dharma treasures and strength, and had not yet encountered any life-threatening danger.</p><p>Just as Qin Sang was patiently searching in the Cleansing Pool,</p><p>a faint abnormal fluctuation appeared faintly from below and to his left, not far from him.</p><p>Qin Sang's heart stirred, and he immediately moved towards it.</p><p>The fluctuation had a clear pattern, and its position was constantly changing.</p><p>Without a doubt, it should have been caused by Liuli.</p><p>Fortunately, he had made preparations, otherwise, he didn't know how long he would have to search!</p><p>Qin Sang breathed a sigh of relief and immediately, according to the agreement, attacked the restrictions once every ten breaths, for a total of three times, to tell Liuli that her method was working.</p><p>Then, he locked onto that fluctuation and approached it at the fastest speed.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>Demonic fire shot out and landed on the surface of a green light, quickly spreading.</p><p>Qin Sang followed closely, pondering for a moment, controlling the demonic fire to gently break through the ancient restrictions within the green light.</p><p>The fluctuation was behind this green light!</p><p>The green light gradually thinned.</p><p>Soon, a crack appeared in it.</p><p>Qin Sang finally saw the appearance of that treasure.</p><p>It was actually a cicada!</p><p>"Eight-Winged Heart Cicada!"</p><p>A trace of astonishment flashed in Qin Sang's eyes, and he immediately recognized it!</p><p>The Eight-Winged Heart Cicada had a very special appearance. It had eight ice-crystal-like wings arranged side by side on its back. Its entire body was crystal clear, as if carved from profound ice, and its eyes were like two snowflakes, exceptionally beautiful.</p><p>Qin Sang never expected that what Liuli and her master were looking for was actually a spirit insect.</p><p>In the rankings of the Spirit Guiding Sect, the Eight-Winged Heart Cicada was undoubtedly ranked among the strange insects.</p><p>However, neither the Strange Insect List nor the Witch Insect List had a detailed record of the Eight-Winged Heart Cicada's abilities, because this kind of spirit cicada had disappeared for many years.</p><p>Qin Sang looked carefully and made another discovery.</p><p>"This is not an Eight-Winged Heart Cicada, but a cicada slough! Liuli and her master meticulously plotted for just a mere cicada slough. What benefits does the Eight-Winged Heart Cicada have for the Ice Soul Divine Light?"</p><p>Qin Sang was somewhat confused.</p><p>He knew very little about this kind of spirit insect and couldn't tell which transformation of the Eight-Winged Heart Cicada had left this slough.</p><p>This Eight-Winged Heart Cicada had been sleeping at the bottom of the Cleansing Pool for an unknown number of years, completing its transformation, leaving behind its slough, and its body had departed.</p><p>Unable to figure out the reason, Qin Sang no longer hesitated. He took out a spirit talisman, and sent the Ice Soul Divine Light sealed inside towards the cicada slough, preparing to retrieve it.</p><p>The Ice Soul Divine Light touched the cicada slough and easily merged into it.</p><p>But Qin Sang felt an inexplicable strange sensation.</p><p>This cicada slough...</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>A sudden change occurred.</p><p>Without any warning, a powerful suction force suddenly erupted.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression changed drastically. Caught off guard, he only had time to activate his Dharma treasures to protect himself. In a dizzying moment, he was sucked in.</p>
