<h1>Chapter 1669: The Demon Child</h1><p>Poison King! Recommendation</p><p>Qin Sang recognized the speaker.</p><p>The voice was shrill and wavering, a forced transmission, clearly affected by the gale and the array restrictions.</p><p>The Poison King was determined to catch up, but Qin Sang's lightning escape was too fast.  The Kun Dao's barrier-based movement was also swift, almost causing the Poison King to lose track.</p><p>The Poison King, skilled in a miasma-to-wind escape technique, found it difficult to leverage the gale, struggling greatly, and hastily sent a voice transmission.</p><p>The voice arrived before the person.</p><p>Qin Sang’s thoughts raced. He responded in a low voice, “What is the meaning of this, friend?”</p><p>His offensive remained fierce, unbroken, but under his deliberate control, the pressure on the Kun Dao eased slightly, creating an opening as he fought and retreated. Recommendation</p><p>Whatever the Poison King's intentions, Qin Sang wasn't inclined to wait for him.</p><p>“Friend, you’ve slain our sect's traitor, eliminating a major threat for me.  I failed to thank you when we met before the mountain; it was my oversight.”</p><p>The gale-distorted transmission made it hard to discern the Poison King's tone, leaving his sincerity uncertain.</p><p>Something's up!</p><p>Qin Sang's heart sank.</p><p>Before the Five Elements Divine Restriction, the Poison King had only inquired about the strange-faced man, showing no unusual behavior. Now, he directly confronted Qin Sang—what went wrong?</p><p>Their last encounter was when Master Huaiyin was ambushed; the Poison King arrived late, unlikely to notice anything amiss. Recommendation</p><p>Qin Sang believed he hadn't revealed any flaws.</p><p>However, the Poison King’s continued tracking of the strange-faced man indicated a hidden method to pinpoint him.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't believe the Poison King's gratitude; it was surely about the strange-faced man's belongings.</p><p>The situation changed unexpectedly.</p><p>He was quite interested in the Gu King and planned to consult the Ghost Mother upon returning to the mountain about taming it.  Whether to let the Poison Bead absorb it or trade it away could be decided later.</p><p>But the secret was revealed so quickly.</p><p>The Poison King's attitude towards the strange-faced man— relentlessly pursuing him in league with the Outer Region saint monk—revealed Wan Du Mountain's determination to possess the Gu King, leaving no room for negotiation. Recommendation</p><p>But handing over the Gu King was something Qin Sang wasn't willing to do.</p><p>“Friend, you exaggerate. I had a life-or-death feud with that villain, unrelated to your sect.  You needn't be grateful, much less give extravagant thanks.”</p><p>Qin Sang laughed heartily, neither denying nor needing to.</p><p>The Poison King seemed taken aback, pausing before saying, “To be frank, friend, my sect is prepared to handsomely reward anyone who helps eliminate the traitor… This King will not disappoint any who assist…”</p><p>His voice unconsciously grew heavier towards the end.</p><p>The Poison King felt uneasy, sensing Qin Sang’s attitude.  The man had deliberately concealed information during their first meeting and now was evasive; his intentions were clear. Recommendation</p><p>What worried the Poison King most was Qin Sang's composure.</p><p>Logically, besides Wan Du Mountain, which cultivated the Gu King's seed, and the traitor who hatched and raised it, no one else could tame it.</p><p>In others' hands, the Gu King was useless; even if temporarily subdued, its ferocity couldn't be controlled.  Instead of being an asset, it posed a constant threat.</p><p>In a short span, they'd encountered three times. Qin Sang showed no unusual aura, only detectable with special techniques.  If the traitor hadn't been found, the Poison King wouldn't suspect Qin Sang.</p><p>How long had he possessed the Gu King to achieve this?</p><p>What did this mean? Recommendation</p><p>If this person held onto, or even tamed the Gu King, it would undoubtedly cause another upheaval.</p><p>But this person was even more formidable than the traitor!</p><p>Qin Sang heard the implication: the Poison King wouldn't disappoint those who helped, but what about those who wouldn't?</p><p>Feigning ignorance, he chuckled, “Let’s discuss this later.  If I have time after leaving the Wu Xiang Immortal Sect, I will definitely pay a visit.”</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang’s continued evasiveness, the Poison King couldn’t contain himself and got straight to the point, “You killed the traitor, and you must have seen a jade-armored insect, the Gu King. This Gu is our sect's treasure. The traitor stole it when he defected; it's useless to outsiders. Might you…”</p><p>“Hold it right there! Where do you think you're going!”</p><p>Before the Poison King could explain the stakes or promise rewards, Qin Sang suddenly shouted. Recommendation</p><p>Then, the Poison King heard a thunderous boom and a rapid retreat.</p><p>The Poison King cursed inwardly, urging his miasma wind to pursue.  During the chase, he sensed the power emanating from the front, gaining a deeper understanding of Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang multitasked, negotiating with the Poison King while relentlessly attacking Kun Dao.  Tian Mu Die kept a close watch on the barrier above.</p><p>As expected, Kun Dao suffered consecutive attacks from the Sun God Tree and the Four-Riding Serpent Seal, accumulating injuries.  Although not yet forced from the barrier, Qin Sang was confident in capturing her – it was merely a matter of time.</p><p>He abruptly interrupted the Poison King, unwilling to commit immediately, wanting to maintain flexibility.</p><p>It seemed he could subdue Kun Dao alone, needing no assistance.  However, the subsequent struggle for the Unwritten Jade Tablet would involve powerful figures from elite clans.  He was alone; if he needed the Poison King, he would consider it then.</p><p>The Poison King pressed on, calling out several times, but received no response.  Shortly after, a violent windstorm erupted, followed by a deafening roar, drowning out the sounds of Qin Sang and Kun Dao's clash.</p><p>The Poison King, passing a small dwelling, noticed it shaking, its protective barriers rippling.  He fought against the waves of impact, reaching the source of the disturbance.</p><p>Seeing the scene, the Poison King snorted. A spirit array had been deliberately detonated, creating a significant distraction – clearly Qin Sang's attempt to mask his movements.</p><p>The Poison King paused, then dashed off, preparing to sense his surroundings.  He detected an unusual energy from the depths of the windstorm to his left, his expression shifting, before he moved towards it.</p><p>Ahead, Qin Sang intentionally slowed his attack. Through mental communication with his doppelganger, he learned that the Poison King had indeed fallen for it, lured away by the deception.</p><p>It took three encounters before the Poison King confirmed the Gu King was with Qin Sang, indicating limitations to the Poison King's abilities.</p><p>As expected. Kun Dao’s condition worsened; his doppelganger was no longer needed here.  His focus should be on capturing Kun Dao. Otherwise, if the Poison King interfered, complications would arise, and Qin Sang had no intention of sharing the spoils.</p><p>His doppelganger was protected by a spiritual treasure; at the very least, it could hold off the Poison King for a while.  The mountain’s complex terrain and numerous formations would favor the doppelganger.  If anything unexpected happened, the main body could arrive promptly.</p><p>Knowing this deception wouldn't fool the Poison King for long, Qin Sang intensified his attack, unleashing his abilities and treasures.</p><p>…</p><p>Before the battle in the Medicine Garden.</p><p>Fan Laomo and Zhu Wudao, lacking their protective talismans, were in no better position than Qin Sang and the others. Their perception was limited by the pervasive windstorms, and they were hindered by the formations.</p><p>Sensing the fragrance of medicinal herbs, both looked down.  They were at the highest point, past the Medicine Garden. To find the source of the scent, they had to go back.</p><p>With powerful enemies pursuing them, returning would be a reckless gamble.</p><p>They both turned away, continuing their ascent.  The formations repeatedly hampered them; despite being top-tier cultivators, they had to avoid some of the more dangerous ones.</p><p>While flying, another spirit array erupted, consumed by the windstorm.</p><p>A sudden surge of green light shot into the sky. It then sensed their presence, transforming into green blades of light that slashed through the air.</p><p>Without hesitation, they both flew to the sides.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>The green light blades passed between them, seemingly cleaving the void itself. Just as they were about to carve a chasm in the ground, they abruptly stopped, reverting to their essence as green light.</p><p>Ripples of green light gently spread through the air.</p><p>Fan Laomo confirmed the threat was gone and crossed the green light, “Brother Zhu…”</p><p>His voice trailed off, his face turning ashen.</p><p>In that instant, Zhu Wudao had vanished!</p><p>He had been completely undetected through that green light.</p><p>Meanwhile, Zhu Wudao, having left Fan Laomo behind, moved through a dense forest.</p><p>His steps weren't fast, yet each stride covered over a hundred meters.  His passage left no ripples; the windstorm passed him without resistance.  Zhu Wudao seemed nonexistent, clearly using a highly advanced evasion technique.</p><p>Unlike Fan Laomo's struggles, Zhu Wudao moved freely, his speed like lightning.</p><p>Upon closer inspection, a faint bloody glow enveloped him, like a blood-red robe. While not completely shielding him from the windstorms, it minimized his aura to almost nothing.</p><p>Following his path, his destination was clear: the summit of Di Shou Mountain!</p><p>Silently, Zhu Wudao passed through the forest and entered a lush meadow. His movements were clearly urgent, stepping over any obstacle in his path.</p><p>As he walked, Zhu Wudao raised an arm, reaching into his sleeve to retrieve a statue.</p><p>The statue had been in his sleeve for some time, originally intended to rescue the Saint Sovereign, but the path to the Celestial Palace was blocked.</p><p>At this moment, the statue displayed a supernatural aura. Two streams of bloody tears flowed from its tightly closed eyes; the crimson robe on Zhu Wu Dao was illuminated by the light emanating from these tears.</p><p>The external blood sacrifice was likely still ongoing, but Zhu Wu Dao knew these tears weren't from that power.</p><p>"So you're still alive," Zhu Wu Dao stared at the statue, chuckling softly.</p><p>"Shut up! Put it away!"</p><p>The color of the bloody tears on the statue's face suddenly deepened. A domineering mental force surged from the statue into Zhu Wu Dao, instinctively causing him to clamp his mouth shut and tuck the statue back into his sleeve.</p><p>Zhu Wu Dao took a deep breath, surveyed his surroundings, and recalled his recent experiences.</p><p>The plan to rescue the Saint Sovereign had gone awry, forcing him to improvise for his own survival.  He knew that once he left the Wuxiang Immortal Sect, he would be hunted relentlessly across the cultivation world, leaving him nowhere to hide.</p><p>Therefore, Zhu Wu Dao began scheming to obtain the opportunities on Di Shou Mountain.  The uninscribed jade tablet was merely a smokescreen. He knew that the Wuxiang Immortal Sect had placed the Five Elements Crown, reputedly the greatest spiritual treasure of Central State, on Di Shou Mountain. It was used to suppress the demonic influence afflicting the sect's cultivators, and that was his true target.</p><p>Unexpectedly, upon entering Di Shou Mountain, an uninvited guest contacted him through the statue.</p><p>Zhu Wu Dao recognized the guest: a great demon lord who had orchestrated a demonic calamity long ago, subsequently imprisoned and sealed on Di Shou Mountain by the Wuxiang Immortal Sect.  This demon was worlds apart from the Saint Sovereign, yet he had somehow survived this long, his true essence unyielding.</p><p>The statue, originally crafted by Zhu Wu Dao for the Saint Sovereign's rescue, was a demonic artifact. Coupled with the long-neglected seal, it allowed the demon to connect through it.</p><p>"What kind of adversary would make even a Demon Prince so cautious?"</p><p>Zhu Wu Dao dared not act rashly, but his thoughts remained unbroken.</p><p>"Hmph!"</p><p>A furious snort echoed in Zhu Wu Dao's mind palace, shaking his primordial spirit and causing pain.</p><p>Simultaneously, fragments of information were forcibly transmitted, flooding his consciousness. This was an overwhelmingly violent act; a cultivator with slightly weaker cultivation would have had their true essence shattered, leaving them an imbecile.</p><p>Zhu Wu Dao frowned, sensing the demon's rage and the volcanic fury being forcibly suppressed.  He abandoned his playful attitude, careful not to further provoke it.</p><p>Concentrating on the fragments, Zhu Wu Dao ‘heard’ broken snatches of information, gradually understanding the key details.</p><p>"A spirit?" Zhu Wu Dao's expression changed drastically; he almost cried out.</p><p>"Not a spirit! It's a demonic spirit born from my corruption of its essence. It hasn't undergone the Soul-Shaping stage; it's nothing like a true spirit!" The Demon Prince's mental fragment countered.</p><p>"A demonic spirit…"</p><p>Zhu Wu Dao was bewildered. This was beyond his comprehension. After careful consideration, he pieced together the events.</p><p>It turned out that Di Shou Mountain's seclusion had two reasons: the sect's masters suffered demonic corruption and sealed themselves here, and the Demon Prince was sealed within the mountain.</p><p>To this, the Demon Prince's mental response was quite smug, "This paltry little world, with only a handful of Nascent Soul cultivators at its strongest, dared to kill me! They could only rely on the seal to slowly erode my true essence."</p><p>The source of the seal's power was the Five Elements Crown, the greatest treasure of Central State!</p><p>Di Shou Mountain deployed the Five Elements Divine Ban within the mountain, linking it to the mountain's protective array to maximize the treasure's power. The Five Elements mutually strengthened each other, creating an unshakeable seal.</p><p>The Wuxiang Immortal Sect masters sealed themselves within the mountain, both to eradicate their demonic influence and to strengthen the seal against the Demon Prince.</p><p>However, soon after the seal was completed, the Wuxiang Immortal Sect faced internal strife, and the seal became a constraint, aided by the Demon Prince.  He sensed an external anomaly and frantically attacked the seal, distracting the cultivators guarding it, leaving them oblivious and unable to prevent their own downfall along with the rest of the Wuxiang Immortal Sect at Tenglong Cliff.</p><p>After this incident, the cultivators on the mountain remained unawakened, gradually passing away in their self-imposed seclusion, and the seal lost control, operating autonomously, allowing the Demon Prince to survive until now.</p><p>Luckily, the Five Elements Divine Ban was self-sustaining, leaving the Demon Prince unable to find a weakness to escape.</p><p>Yet, in his cunning, he conceived a method to corrupt the spiritual treasure.  The reputation of the greatest treasure of Central State was well-deserved; though not yet shaped into a true spirit, its inherent spiritual power was strong enough to be corrupted.</p><p>Over hundreds, perhaps thousands of years, the Demon Prince succeeded, gradually transforming the Five Elements Crown into a demonic artifact.</p><p>Seeing this, Zhu Wu Dao became even more puzzled. "If so, then why…"</p><p>"Over three hundred years ago…"</p><p>The Demon Prince suddenly paused, letting out a cold snort, resentfully stating, "Due to my long imprisonment and the seal's erosion, I grew weaker, causing a setback; the corruption was interrupted. When I tried to continue, I discovered that the Five Elements Crown had spontaneously generated its own spirit, birthing a strange entity, neither fully spirit nor artifact, that instead of rescuing its master, tried to devour me and claim its own sentience!"</p>
