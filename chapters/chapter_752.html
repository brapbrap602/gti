<h1>Chapter 744: Hurricane</h1><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The storm arrived.</p><p>Everyone was instantly scattered by the wind, their protective auras flickering wildly.</p><p>Qin Sang, wielding his ebony sword, charged into the barrier.  He felt as if he were being repeatedly struck by chaotic, immense forces, like a wisp of dandelion fluff in a downpour.</p><p>Everyone struggled to regain their footing, barely managing to stay upright in the storm.</p><p>Qin Sang poured more spiritual energy into his ebony sword, activating its protective aura.  The world was dark within the storm. The hurricane was almost tangible, with visible streaks of grey wind raging across the sky and sea.</p><p>The sea was never calm. The hurricane whipped the water into monstrous waves.</p><p>All other sounds were drowned out by the roaring wind and crashing waves – a deafening cacophony that made their hearts pound.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>A colossal wave surged towards them, building to a towering height of dozens of meters before crashing down.</p><p>Everyone's faces changed. The wave's immense power sent shivers down their spines. Without hesitation, they all flew into the air to avoid it.</p><p>"Stay close, keep formation!"</p><p>Xiang Yi transmitted his voice, gathering his people.</p><p>With Xiang Yi at the center, Qin Sang and the others huddled together, gazing with trepidation at the storm's depths – a grey expanse that seemed endless.</p><p>Only when faced with such awesome power of nature could cultivators truly appreciate their own insignificance.</p><p>"Go!"</p><p>Xiang Yi activated a restriction on his jade pendant, indicating the direction and leading the group forward.</p><p>The wind and waves continued unabated, growing increasingly terrifying. They were tossed about, dodging huge waves, struggling to advance through the hurricane.</p><p>Qin Sang remained distracted, looking around.</p><p>Having spent many years training in the Ancient Immortal Battlefield, he was very familiar with the celestial phenomena caused by spirit tides. The hurricane here seemed increasingly similar, but he found no trace of a spirit tide.</p><p>Perhaps they hadn't gone deep enough.</p><p>However, for cultivators of their level, venturing deep into the heart of the storm was nothing short of a fool's errand.</p><p>To withstand the storm, they had to constantly activate their protective talismans, causing their spiritual energy to be continuously depleted.</p><p>In the Ancient Immortal Battlefield, they could find shelters to rest and recuperate during celestial phenomena.  Here, on the boundless ocean, without even a small island in sight, there was nowhere to rest.  Depletion of spiritual energy meant certain death.</p><p>Even over this short distance, the rate of spiritual energy consumption had already begun to worry some.</p><p>"Daoist Xiang, how much farther to the Seven Kills Hall?"</p><p>Cui Ji summoned the Purple Nether Pearl, floating before his chest. Its purple protective aura illuminated his pale, bloodless face, giving him a rather eerie look.</p><p>Xiang Yi frowned, glancing at Cui Ji. "With your cultivation, reaching the Seven Kills Hall before its opening is certainly no problem. Daoist Cui, don't worry."</p><p>The others could only suppress their unease and silently follow behind Xiang Yi.</p><p>They had been flying for an unknown distance.  Calculating the time, less than half an hour remained until midnight, meaning the Grand Shaman would soon begin breaking the formation.</p><p>Everyone increased their speed. Fortunately, they encountered no further obstacles and reached the Seven Kills Hall without incident.</p><p>"We're here!"</p><p>Xiang Yi softly exclaimed.</p><p>Everyone's eyes lit up. Following Xiang Yi's gaze, they all cried out in astonishment and awe.</p><p>Before them was a wall of grey air, a wind barrier.</p><p>Upon closer inspection, it was just a part of the hurricane's edge.</p><p>This grey air was the hurricane's power condensed to its extreme.  The hurricane from all directions seemed to converge here, forming a dark cloud-like vortex.</p><p>They could only see a part of it; its full extent was unimaginable.</p><p>Below the wind wall, a massive pit and whirlpool had formed in the sea, like a funnel.  At the edges was a curtain of water dozens of meters high, with endless seawater being sucked into the vortex, never to be filled.</p><p>The hurricane and whirlpool were seamlessly connected.</p><p>Xiang Yi signaled them to stop.</p><p>The hurricane was even more violent here.</p><p>They had to use all their strength to maintain their protective talismans to avoid being scattered.  If they went any further, and were swept away by the hurricane or sucked into the underwater whirlpool, the consequences would be dire.</p><p>Everyone stood suspended in the air.</p><p>Qin Sang recalled that before entering the Ziwei Palace, he could see layers of clouds and the palace gate. Here, nothing was visible except for the endless grey hurricane.</p><p>Whether the Seven Kills Hall was hidden deep within the hurricane, or in the underwater whirlpool, remained a mystery.</p><p>Qin Sang looked around, noticing other cultivators had already arrived, some alone, others in groups like them.  Everyone stood patiently, waiting for the Seven Kill Hall to open.</p><p>Qin Sang scanned the area, studying the hurricane and vortex, but couldn't find the Witch Clan's High Priest or the Nascent Soul Masters who'd arrived earlier. They were positioned on the edge of the hurricane.</p><p>According to Xiang Yi, the hurricane and vortex were roughly circular. Cultivators with the tokens, like them, were waiting at the edge for the signal to enter the formation.</p><p>"This hurricane is terrifying," Qin Sang murmured. "Only a legendary celestial array could create such a fearsome phenomenon.  There's no sign of it weakening.  Except for the lack of spatial rifts, it's almost identical to the eye of the storm outside the Purple Micro Palace. I wonder if the inside is as dangerous as the Purple Micro Palace's celestial array?  The Xiaohan Domain only dared to enter using the Xiaoběichén Star Yuan Array, and even then, only after it appeared naturally from the Purple Micro Palace… How does the Witch Clan's High Priest plan to forcibly break through?"</p><p>Qin Sang wanted to explore, hoping to find the High Priest and witness the breakthrough firsthand. But seeing Xiang Yi showed no such intention, he gave up.</p><p>Xiang Yi soon explained, "The High Priest and the Nascent Soul Masters have already entered the heart of the hurricane and are engaging the array. No matter where we stand, we can't see the process. We must patiently wait for the signal. The opportunity to enter is fleeting.  Everyone, please stay focused; don't miss this crucial moment…"</p><p>Before he finished, everyone sensed a powerful aura approaching at incredible speed.  Before they could react, a figure, an old man in grey robes, appeared before the wind wall.</p><p>"Yunlai the Reclusive Cultivator," the Liu couple whispered, recognizing him.  "He's a very well-known cultivator from the Inner Sea, with strong connections in both righteous and demonic paths. He rules an island alone. We've had the honor of meeting him once."</p><p>Undoubtedly, Yunlai was a Nascent Soul Master. He paused briefly before the wind wall, produced an iron stylus made of black iron, and lightly scratched it. A black light appeared in the void, and effortlessly, a gap opened in the wind wall. The old man vanished, and the gap slowly sealed shut.</p>
