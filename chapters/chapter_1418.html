<h1>Chapter 1410: Grand Cultivator</h1><p>Whether Jinghai Sect is truly this vast,</p><p>or it's an illusion created by the array,</p><p>Qin Sang, with the help of the Celestial Eye Butterfly, carefully observed the surroundings. He gradually made some discoveries, but they were not enough to change the current situation.</p><p>Two more hours passed.</p><p>They didn't know where they had arrived.</p><p>The strange wind showed no sign of stopping; instead, it grew fiercer and more relentless.</p><p>‘Whoosh…whoosh…’</p><p>The howling wind filled their ears.</p><p>From the outside, they seemed to be in a sea of fire.</p><p>The strange wind, infused with the fiery breath of the Red Flame, was like streams of fire engulfing them, constantly scorching them.</p><p>At the same time, they had to be wary of the occasional appearance of Golden Liquid.</p><p>The four focused their attention, not daring to relax.</p><p>They had a feeling that new changes were about to occur!</p><p>“Wait…”</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly stopped everyone.</p><p>Under their surprised gazes, Qin Sang stared intently ahead, hesitated for a moment, then suddenly accelerated, holding up the bronze mirror, and dashed forward.</p><p>Master Mu and the other two quickly followed.</p><p>In a short while,</p><p>the four figures stopped abruptly, their eyes filled with a mixture of surprise and joy as they looked at the scene before them.</p><p>At this time,</p><p>the area in front of them was no longer empty; it was filled with red and gold light.</p><p>The light was extremely dazzling, blocking their path.  It stretched endlessly in all directions, without bound.</p><p>The red light was undoubtedly emanating from the fiery breath of the Red Flame.</p><p>The Red Flame’s breath here was extremely dense, forming a sea of fire.</p><p>Even before approaching, they felt the unbearable heat.</p><p>And this was after it had dissipated for a while.</p><p>The source of the golden light was a series of intermittently appearing characters, constantly shifting within the sea of fire, almost merging with the Red Flame’s breath itself.</p><p>Their guess was confirmed here.</p><p>For countless years, the Red Flame’s breath had indeed merged with the array.</p><p>The characters were so impacted by the Red Flame’s breath that it was difficult to discern their original form.</p><p>After observing for a long time,</p><p>Qin Sang and the others realized that the characters originally formed countless golden statues of Buddhas and Arhats—a Thousand Buddha Wall!</p><p>But now it was completely unrecognizable.</p><p>Master Mu turned to Qin Sang.</p><p>Before he could ask, Qin Sang proactively said, “The Myriad Spirit Fruit is behind the Thousand Buddha Wall.”</p><p>“It seems we have to go through the Thousand Buddha Wall,” Master Mu nodded thoughtfully, his brow slightly furrowed.</p><p>“There!”</p><p>The Qi cultivator exclaimed softly, pointing to a place where the red and gold light met.</p><p>It looked like a crack.</p><p>“The two of you were right before, it's a double-edged sword, but it's our chance!” The Qi cultivator said joyfully, “If we pass through this Thousand Buddha Wall, won't we be able to enter the Jinghai Sect?”</p><p>“It's not that easy!”</p><p>Qin Sang poured cold water on him, “Along the way, although we need to be constantly vigilant, we haven't actually encountered any life-threatening dangers. The Myriad Spirit Fruit is still far from us, and the Thousand Buddha Wall is definitely not the end. In my opinion, we are probably on the outer edge of the sect-protecting array.”</p><p>“With the existence of Golden Liquid, just the outer edge?”</p><p>Qi and Wang’s faces both looked a little ugly.</p><p>If it weren't for Qin Sang and Master Mu, they alone would probably not have been able to get very far.</p><p>Master Mu's expression remained unchanged, and he said in a deep voice, “Since we're here, let's make the best of it. Let's first find a place to cross through.”</p><p>The four carefully flew close to the Thousand Buddha Wall.</p><p>The closer they got to the Thousand Buddha Wall, the more tense their minds became.</p><p>Although the Red Flame’s breath had merged with the characters on the Thousand Buddha Wall, this fusion wasn't harmonious like water and milk, but rather a mutual devouring and collision, achieving a delicate balance.</p><p>To pass through the Thousand Buddha Wall, they would inevitably break the balance, attracting the combined annihilation of the two forces.</p><p>If they waited a little longer, until the Red Flame’s breath weakened to a certain extent, the danger would be greatly reduced, but the advantage of their early arrival would be gone.</p><p>They were trapped in the array and could not see the whole picture of the array.</p><p>No one knew if the later arrivals would encounter a different transformation of the array.</p><p>The four searched the Thousand Buddha Wall.</p><p>Soon, they located three cracks.</p><p>Qin Sang secretly activated his Celestial Eye ability to observe the changes in the power around the cracks. Finally, after careful analysis, the four determined that one of them, the smallest one, was the best option.</p><p>This crack was between two Arhat statues.</p><p>The faces of the two Arhats had been consumed by the Red Flame. One of them could barely make out twisted features, but it had no Buddha-like appearance at all; it looked more like a devil emerging from the fire.</p><p>Around the crack, the characters vibrated frequently and were extremely unstable.</p><p>“Master Mu, let's join hands and force our way through here, seizing the moment when the Thousand Buddha Wall and the Red Flame’s breath haven’t fully merged yet.”</p><p>After staring for a while, Qin Sang pointed to a spot within the crack.</p><p>Master Mu nodded and turned to Qi and Wang, saying, “You two are responsible for resisting the strange wind and preventing disturbances from elsewhere from affecting this area.”</p><p>“Good!”</p><p>Qi and Wang nodded and brought out their respective magic treasures, looking around.</p><p>Qin Sang instinctively had the Sky-Eye Butterfly scout the area.  In truth, the relentless gale offered no shelter; even a fifth person would be impossible to conceal without detection.  It was simply habitual caution.</p><p>Confirming the area was clear, Qin Sang and the others proceeded as planned, approaching the Thousand Buddha Cliff.  But they hadn't noticed…</p><p>In the distance, two ethereal figures were closing in.  It was the Demon Elder and the True Person of Restraint.  Surrounding them was an invisible shield, emanating from the 'Nine Restraints' ring.  Though seemingly frail, the shield drew upon a portion of the spirit array's power, rendering them immune to the gale.</p><p>Thus, they moved silently through the wind, undetectable.  However, the True Person of Restraint's hand, gripping the Nine Restraints ring, was now tense with bulging veins.  His expression was one of considerable strain.</p><p>The altered array made the previous token less effective. This shield couldn't be sustained indefinitely and only worked on the outer edges.</p><p>Qin Sang's group couldn't see them, but they could clearly see the anomaly within the gale ahead, pinpointing Qin Sang's location.</p><p>Unaware, Qin Sang and Master Mu approached the Thousand Buddha Cliff, relentlessly channeling their energy to withstand the external forces.</p><p>Upon closer inspection, they found the fissure far wider than anticipated, a chaotic mix of blazing flames and 'd' glyphs constantly shifting.  Qin Sang and Master Mu exchanged a glance and simultaneously summoned their treasures.</p><p>The Golden Sinking Sword was sufficient.</p><p>"Swish! Swish!"</p><p>The Serpent Spear and the Golden Sinking Sword advanced together, piercing deep into the fissure. Their timing and placement were impeccable, avoiding immediate disruption of the two forces.</p><p>Due to their different roles, Qin Sang was slightly ahead.</p><p>"Pfft!"</p><p>A small opening appeared in the fissure, and the surrounding crimson light compressed inwards—their best chance!</p><p>Qin Sang's heart leaped with joy; he shifted, about to call the others, when a sudden warning surged through him – the Sky-Eye Butterfly was signaling danger!</p><p>"Careful!"</p><p>Qin Sang's face paled, his shout ringing out.</p>
