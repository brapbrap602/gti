<h1>Chapter 2075: Mid-Nascent Soul Stage</h1><p>Somewhere in the East Sea.</p><p>Dark clouds billowed, demonic energy soaring into the heavens.</p><p>Within the demonic energy, squads of fully armed demon soldiers patrolled back and forth, their killing intent palpable.</p><p>Qin Sang and Li Yu Fu arrived silently, standing among the clouds. Li Yu Fu released a trace of his aura. After a moment, subtle fluctuations appeared in the demonic energy below, and a burly figure flashed before them, letting out a hearty laugh.</p><p>"Master Li, what are your instructions?  A message would suffice, why bother… uh…"</p><p>The newcomer was the Black Lion Great Sage, now the Black Lion Saint King.  In his cave, he had only sensed Li Yu Fu's presence, completely unaware of another person.</p><p>Upon seeing Qin Sang, the Black Lion Saint King froze, his eyes widening like brass bells. He quickly recovered, rolling in the clouds and transforming into his black lion form, prostrating himself at Qin Sang's feet, loudly exclaiming:</p><p>"This lowly one greets Master!"</p><p>This series of actions was as smooth as water, leaving Li Yu Fu astonished and admiring the Saint King's adaptability.</p><p>Unbeknownst to him, the Black Lion Saint King was drenched in cold sweat, immensely grateful for his wise decision years ago to leave Qingyang Temple and never cause trouble for them, maintaining a connection, a token of respect.</p><p>His furry head was almost buried in the clouds, wishing to rub against Qin Sang's feet, his tone fawning, "This humble one knew that Master is blessed by heaven and would surely…"</p><p>"Enough!"</p><p>Qin Sang interrupted the Black Lion, a flash of spiritual light knocking him away.  "Since Yu Fu has lifted the restrictions on you, you are no longer this poor Daoist's mount.  Considering you've been relatively well-behaved these years, I won't trouble you further. You may continue to be your Saint King."</p><p>The Black Lion Saint King, upon hearing that Qin Sang no longer considered him a mount, felt a pang of anxiety, then relief, transforming back into human form and performing a deep bow before Qin Sang, still addressing him as Master.</p><p>"Thank you, Master, for your leniency!"</p><p>He added, "Without Master and the Glass Fairy, this lowly one wouldn't be where he is today.  Master, any command you give, this lowly one will do their utmost to complete."</p><p>"You're quite clever,"</p><p>Qin Sang smiled.  "What is your status among the demon tribe?"</p><p>The Black Lion Saint King, hearing that Qin Sang was asking about his standing within the entire demon race, not just the East Sea, immediately formed several conjectures.  He rolled his eyes and lamented, "Master, you see clearly.  Throughout the demon world, it is known that this lowly one is closer to humans and Qingyang Temple. They are wary of me, openly and secretly, excluding me from important discussions. Those from the Demon Sea treat me even worse. If it weren't for needing me to contact Master Li, Dragon Whale Saint King would have long expelled me from the East Sea!"</p><p>He painted a picture of himself as utterly miserable.</p><p>Qin Sang, however, knew that with the Black Lion Saint King's smooth nature, he would fare well anywhere.</p><p>"I happened to be passing by, today I only wished to see an old friend. I may have tasks for you in the future, but for now, keep it quiet."</p><p>"This lowly one understands!"</p><p>The Black Lion Saint King gave a formal bow, only to see Qin Sang and Li Yu Fu disappear in a flash. He finally relaxed.</p><p>He rubbed his chin, a thoughtful expression on his face.  Though Qin Sang hadn't given orders, he could guess what was expected. He should start planning and preparing.</p><p>If he handled things well, winning the Master's favor, not only would past grievances be forgotten, but rewards would surely follow.</p><p>With this in mind, the Black Lion Saint King looked towards his cave, a cold smile on his face.  That was one of the Dragon Whale Saint King's palaces, deliberately built near his dojo.</p><p>……</p><p>Disregarding the Glass Fairy, the Central Plains remained the strongest region. The Three Teach Alliance, formerly comprised of the Sweet Dew Monastery, Eight Scenic Spots and Celestial Firmament Tower, not only remained intact but grew stronger, with other Central Plains forces deferring to them.</p><p>Among these Central Plains powerhouses, Qin Sang was closest to the current Mount Not-Forgetting Master, Lu Zhang, and the Poison King of the Ten Thousand Poison Mountain.</p><p>The Poison King's ability to survive the Heavenly Tribulation was rumored to be due to his sect's sacred object, the corpse of a five-stage Bloodthirsty Poison Spirit insect, which was destroyed in the process, shielding him from the calamity.  Ten Thousand Poison Mountain maintains its mysterious image, but its power is waning.</p><p>Qin Sang only had a general understanding of the situation in the Central Plains, and didn't visit anyone. The Central Plains was complex, requiring careful consideration.</p><p>Several major sects in the Central Plains, especially the Buddhist, Daoist, and Demon sects, had produced ascended cultivators, sometimes more than one.  Ascended cultivators from the past could appear at any time.</p><p>Qin Sang always left a path open, not cutting off the legacy of these sects, allowing them to exist, also considering this point. Otherwise, if ascended cultivators found their legacies destroyed, an unnecessary enemy would be created.</p><p>Of course, if the Ascendants wish to take their descendants with them, Qin Sang wouldn't stop them; it might even gain an ally.  However, if they harbor any ambitions towards the Storm World, a battle is unavoidable.</p><p>Crossing the Central Plains, they arrived at what was once the edge of the storm. The lava and flames were gone, replaced by a lush and prosperous land.</p><p>From the Central Plains to the Western Lands is a single continent. After the relocation of the Demon Sea and the Canglang Sea, they were situated on the southern side of the continent, between the Central Plains and the Western Lands.</p><p>The Central Plains continent now stretches from west to east, with the Western Lands humans, the Demon Sea demons, the Canglang Sea humans, the Witch Clan, and the Central Plains humans in that order.</p><p>This arrangement was carefully considered. The Changyou army couldn't possibly bypass the defenses and silently attack from the north. The primary concern was an attack from the south. Positioning them this way forces them to form a long defensive line and guard this area.</p><p>The Demon Clan and the Witch Clan are separated by the Canglang Sea humans to prevent secret collusion, while also being sandwiched between human races, allowing the humans to detect any unusual activity.</p><p>The leader of the Witch Clan is still Fang Laomo.</p><p>Fang Laomo, inhabiting a bug's body, surprisingly managed to break through to the Divine Transformation stage. Qin Sang found this somewhat unexpected.</p><p>During the Canglang Sea incident, the Witch Clan, outnumbered by the humans, could only retreat to the Witch God Continent. The Changyou attack was another devastating blow.  Among the three races, the Witch Clan, despite being the weakest, is the most united, with over 90% of its people concentrated in one area, centered around Witch God Mountain.</p><p>Within the Witch Clan, Fang Laomo's prestige is unparalleled; his commands are absolute.</p><p>Winning over Fang Laomo would make dealing with the Witch Clan the easiest.</p><p>Qin Sang intends to keep the Witch Clan; he and Tianmudie are both nearing a breakthrough to the Unity stage. Before their breakthrough, he definitely needs to find Gui Mu and seek guidance on the secret arts for Tianmudie's transformation.</p><p>Next, Qin Sang didn't visit Fang Laomo; he instead went to the Four Saints Palace to meet Palace Master Bao Zhengnan.</p><p>The Four Saints Palace's position is increasingly unstable. Firstly, they're caught between the Witch Clan and the Demon Clan, with blood feuds with both.  Secondly, after relocating, the righteous and demonic cultivators previously subdued by the Four Saints Palace, along with remnants of the three major merchant alliances, have become restless, secretly connecting with forces in the Central Plains, each with their own agenda.</p><p>The Central Plains forces don't fear the Four Saints Palace. Bao Zhengnan is powerless to stop it and has long sensed the impending crisis.</p><p>Because of this, the Four Saints Palace, like the Xuan Tian Palace, firmly stands with Liuli and Qingyang Temple.</p><p>Qin Sang's arrival reassured Bao Zhengnan.</p><p>With the Four Saints Palace and the Xuan Tian Palace cooperating, it's sufficient; involving too many people could backfire.</p><p>"Palace Master Bao, there's no need to see me off. I'll visit again another day," Qin Sang bowed and continued westward.</p><p>...</p><p>Western Lands.</p><p>The gates of the Great Compassion Temple were reduced to ashes.</p><p>Years ago, the Western Lands also suffered a fierce attack. Master Huaiyin led the Western Lands cultivators in a strategic retreat, abandoning most of the Western Lands and falling back to the teleportation array. With the support of the Central Plains, they held the Changyou army at bay. (My previous account was incorrect; it was Master Xingji from the Ganlu Temple who perished in the Heavenly Tribulation.)</p><p>The situation remains the same; both sides are locked in a standoff in the Western Lands, one of the most brutal battlefields, now a wasteland.</p><p>Standing on a sand dune, Qin Sang looked across at the Changyou army, feeling a wave of murderous aura wash over him.</p><p>By now, he has essentially visited all the major regions of the Storm World, and has a good grasp of the situation.</p><p>After watching for a while, Qin Sang turned and flew back to Luye.</p><p>Siliu emerged from her meditation chamber upon sensing his return.</p><p>Ji Hong was nowhere to be found.</p><p>Siliu has been healing and stabilizing her foundation; she had only suppressed her injuries before. Complete recovery requires more time.</p><p>Qin Sang bowed slightly. "The time is almost upon us; I can't leave for a while. I'll trouble you to fetch Su Nu and the others."</p><p>Siliu agreed without hesitation and immediately left.</p><p>After sending Siliu off, Qin Sang ordered the relocation of Luye. After drifting eastward for some time, they stopped above a vast expanse of mountains and fields.</p><p>A vast land, crisscrossed by rivers and streams.</p><p>Towering peaks, one range after another, stretched to the horizon like a dragon and serpent running.</p><p>This place is located on the western side of the Northern Wasteland of the Central Plains, originally within the storm zone.</p><p>Due to the extremely rugged terrain, no commoners had ever settled here; it was uninhabited.</p><p>After the Storm World's return to the Greater Thousand World, spiritual energy recovered. However, there are differences in the level of spiritual energy in different places. The best cultivation sites remain in the Central Plains region.</p><p>Nourished by the world's vital energy, the once desolate Northern Wastelands transformed into a picturesque landscape.  The Nine Calamities of the North vanished, and the demonic sects of the Central Plains lived comfortably.</p><p>This place is no different; its imposing aura undeniably marks it as a sacred land.  The Green Sheep Sect has a branch temple here.</p><p>However, the spiritual veins are scattered and chaotic. Establishing a main temple requires relocating the veins and reorganizing the spiritual energy – a massive undertaking. Small sects cannot afford it, and while the Green Sheep Sect already holds a presence, larger sects are unwilling to compete with them.  Thus, it remains undeveloped.</p><p>Li Yu Fu secured this location anticipating that Lu Ye would only be a temporary base.  Once the Green Sheep Sect grew, it would need a new main temple, and this location was a prime candidate.</p><p>“The Green Sheep Sect’s main temple will be here!”</p><p>Qin Sang pointed to the ground, his words decisive.</p><p>Li Yu Fu bowed in acceptance, returning to Lu Ye to assemble the disciples and issue his orders.</p><p>Qin Sang remained, his consciousness spreading, sweeping across countless mountains and rivers, penetrating the earth, perceiving each spiritual vein, extending his senses to the furthest reaches.</p><p>An image formed in his mind; even the smallest veins were revealed.  Countless veins were dispersed and then reorganized repeatedly.</p><p>Qin Sang tirelessly refined his plan, losing track of the number of reorganizations, yet still unsatisfied.</p><p>A simple temple would not require such effort, but he also planned to build the main Thunder Altar here.</p><p>This location was chosen firstly for being near the center of the Storm Realm and secondly to deter the Central Plains factions, ensuring that Green Sheep Sect disciples would never lack opponents.</p><p>After an unknown time, Qin Sang’s eyes lit up as he ceased his calculations, a hint of exhaustion in his gaze.</p><p>Li Yu Fu had waited patiently. Qin Sang produced a blank jade slip, inscribing his plan onto it.  He instructed, “Relocate the spiritual veins according to this. You can begin by establishing the first layer of the mountain-protecting array.  Entrust the creation of the array components to Shen Chen.”</p><p>Li Yu Fu’s consciousness probed the jade slip. The complexity of the mountain-protecting array made him dizzy; he felt both awe and delight.</p><p>The first layer alone surpassed all arrays in the Storm Realm. He could only imagine the power of the complete array!</p><p>Unknown to him, Qin Sang had incorporated the Heavenly River Reverse Killing Array and other powerful arrays, far surpassing anything in the Storm Realm.</p><p>This would not only be the Green Sheep Sect's main temple but also his future Daoist grounds, so perfection was paramount.</p><p>This would keep the Green Sheep Sect busy for a while. Qin Sang dismissed Li Yu Fu,  instead flying to the North Sea, landing on a deserted island and setting up protective arrays.</p><p>During his travels in the Storm Realm, Qin Sang had not neglected his cultivation.</p><p>His understanding of the saintly statue's divine intent deepened, sensing a subtle stirring.</p><p>He realized this was a potential breakthrough.</p><p>The spiritual energy from the Wu tribe's incantation was almost completely refined. Once his foundation was completely solidified, he could attempt to break through to the mid-Refining Void stage!</p><p>After setting up the protective formations, Qin Sang released Zhu Que and the two great demon marquises to guard the perimeter.</p><p>He sat cross-legged, entering a state of deep meditation; only occasional subtle fluctuations in his breath betrayed his presence.</p><p>The island remained serene.</p><p>Gradually, even those subtle fluctuations ceased. Qin Sang felt the last discordant energy in his body smoothed out, signifying the complete absorption of the Wu tribe's incantation!</p><p>‘Whoosh! Whoosh!’</p><p>A violent wind arose, and Qin Sang voraciously devoured the world's vital energy, pushing his cultivation to its peak.</p><p>After a period of quiet, Qin Sang clarified his Dao, ready to attempt the breakthrough!</p><p>He summoned the Sky-Eyed Butterfly to assist him. Shortly after, slight fluctuations appeared on his body, disappearing and reappearing, each time stronger than before.</p><p>Zhu Que and the two demon marquises, sensing the anomaly, looked on.</p><p>In a flash, the world's vital energy surged towards the island. The void above seemed to have a hole punched in it, the speed of energy consumption so terrifying that a massive vortex appeared in the sky.</p><p>Within the vortex, Zhu Que and the others vaguely saw a shadowy figure, Qin Sang's dharma body!</p><p>Qin Sang was oblivious to everything, feeling only the barrier before him; a mighty push would open the door to a new realm.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>Clouds dissipated, the vortex vanishing instantly, swallowed by the dharma body. The dharma body stood firm, radiating multicolored light before fading, returning to its original form within Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang abruptly opened his eyes, a smile spreading across his face. He had finally broken through to the mid-Refining Void stage! (End)</p>
