<h1>Chapter 1377: Sun, Moon, Star, and Hundred Flowers Valley</h1><p>Upper District.</p><p>Qin Sang left a trading house and walked towards another.</p><p>He wasn't rushing to see Master Feng.  His inquiries were primarily to understand the situation in the three regions of the North Sea.</p><p>These trading houses were well-informed, and Qin Sang now had a general idea of the three regions.</p><p>"Sun, Moon, Star…"</p><p>Qin Sang's mind flashed back to the sea chart a merchant had shown him.</p><p>The three areas controlled by humans were called Sun, Moon, and Star.</p><p>'Moon' and 'Sun' referred to two of the three North Sea regions:  Xianyue Region, where Qin Sang was, and Yinri Region.</p><p>'Star' referred to a sea area called the Star Sand Archipelago.</p><p>As the name suggests, this sea area had countless islands, as dense as stars and sand.  Although vast, it wasn't among the three North Sea regions.</p><p>The third region was the Demon Region, commonly known as Demon Island.</p><p>Yinri Region, Xianyue Region, and Demon Region constituted the three North Sea regions, separated from each other by tens of thousands of miles.</p><p>The three regions roughly occupied the east, west, and north sections of the North Sea.</p><p>Yinri Region was in the east, and Xianyue Region was in the west.</p><p>Xianyue Island had a long coastline. The northern tip was not far from the storm belt, while the southern tip extended to the southern part of the North Sea.</p><p>Yinri Region was the smallest of the three regions, said to be a perfectly round landmass.</p><p>Legend said the weather there was extremely cold, with perpetual snowfall, hence the name Yinri (Hidden Sun).</p><p>Demon Island was located between Yinri Region and Xianyue Region, but not in the middle, rather slightly to the north.</p><p>Between them lay a vast and boundless sea, simply and brutally named the Boundless Sea.</p><p>It wasn't entirely devoid of islands and landmasses, but none were comparable to the three regions.  It bordered all three, leading to an extremely chaotic situation.</p><p>Many demons and bloodthirsty demon kings roamed here, a mix of all sorts, a lawless place of constant slaughter.</p><p>The Crackwind Archipelago of the Canglang Sea was similar, but not comparable to the Boundless Sea.</p><p>Qin Sang wondered if the trading houses had exaggerated.</p><p>Rumor had it that even Nascent Soul cultivators needed to be cautious in the Boundless Sea, with not a few Nascent Soul cultivators disappearing while crossing it. Therefore, although Xianyue Region and Yinri Region were both under human control, cultivators here knew little about Yinri Region.</p><p>Only one fact was universally acknowledged: Yinri Region wasn't as fragmented as Xianyue Region.</p><p>The entire Yinri Region was controlled by a powerful force called Xuan Tian Palace.</p><p>Based on descriptions, Xuan Tian Palace wasn't a loose organization like the Beichen Alliance, but a sect, with a Grand Cultivator as its Palace Master!</p><p>One could imagine the scale of Xuan Tian Palace!</p><p>The Demon Region was naturally the territory of the demons.</p><p>The North Sea humans and demons, like the humans and witches of the Canglang Sea, had a bloody feud.</p><p>In the Canglang Sea, the presence of the Demon Sea demons allowed for a diversion of conflict, and the weakening of the witches, who were confined to the Witch God Continent, eased tensions between the two races.</p><p>The North Sea was different; the two races were at odds, with no possibility of reconciliation.</p><p>It was said that the Demon Region once had human inhabitants, but they were all slaughtered by the demons, who now solely dominated the region.</p><p>Furthermore,</p><p>The Star Sand Archipelago, located northeast of Xianyue Island's northern tip, also bordered the Demon Region.  It had been largely swallowed by the demons, who continued their advance.</p><p>The dragon boat had come from the Star Sand Archipelago to Xianyue Region.</p><p>Qin Sang's departure point from the storm belt was precisely between Xianyue Region and the Star Sand Archipelago.  Further east, he might directly fall into the demon's territory.</p><p>The various trading houses knew the most about Xianyue Region.</p><p>That was also Qin Sang's main concern.</p><p>Since he was here, he would make the best of it.</p><p>He would likely travel in Xianyue Region for a considerable time.</p><p>With its warring factions, the situation was even more chaotic than Beichen Region, and Qin Sang needed to be careful.</p><p>Master Feng was one such powerful figure, renowned throughout Xianyue Region.</p><p>Musing on these things, Qin Sang walked through several streets and arrived before a tall building.</p><p>"Fengyang Tower…"</p><p>Seeing these three characters, Qin Sang knew he had come to the right place.  He paused for a moment before entering.</p><p>On the first floor, dozens of beautiful female cultivators acted as hostesses, bustling like butterflies among the guests.</p><p>However, the one to greet Qin Sang was an old steward, who led him to a quiet room on the second floor and served him spiritual tea.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Mingyue, what would you like to purchase? I'll have someone fetch it immediately, ensuring your visit is worthwhile,"</p><p>the old steward said with a smile, personally pouring tea for Qin Sang.</p><p>He was also a Golden Core cultivator, his attitude neither humble nor arrogant, treating Qin Sang as an equal.</p><p>However, the confidence on the old steward's face quickly froze.</p><p>The spiritual materials Qin Sang named were all exceptionally rare, none of which Fengyang Market could provide.</p><p>The old steward's eyes showed suspicion, wondering if Qin Sang was deliberately teasing him.  Such things were beyond the reach of Golden Core cultivators.</p><p>"It's no better than Beichen Region or Canglang Sea!"</p><p>After a brief probe, Qin Sang had a clear understanding.</p><p>Indeed, they were all cage-like places, not particularly wealthy.</p><p>I wonder if the Beihai cultivation world has any unique traditions like the Wu Clan, something to open my eyes.</p><p>He didn't care about the old steward's thoughts.  He swirled his teacup lightly, pondered for a moment, and said, "Does your esteemed trading house sell any manuals on insect control?"</p><p>"Insect control?"</p><p>The old steward was startled, somewhat surprised.</p><p>Insect control is a branch of beast control, and a very esoteric one at that. Even sects renowned for beast control rarely have practitioners of this art.</p><p>"Insect control manuals, or techniques for cultivating spirit insects, anything will do."</p><p>Qin Sang paused, then added, "If you have any top-tier sword techniques, bring those as well.  The price is negotiable."</p><p>Top-tier swordsmanship could be cross-referenced with the *Yuanshen Sword Nurturing Chapter*.</p><p>However, Qin Sang didn't have high hopes.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang's bold request, the old steward's doubts lessened slightly. After a moment's thought, he said, "I'm not sure what constitutes 'top-tier' swordsmanship, but the trading house does indeed possess several treasured techniques. I'll have them brought here for your selection. As for insect control manuals, my friend, you've come to the right place!  We happen to have one, and it's quite significant!"</p><p>Qin Sang's interest piqued immediately.  "I'd be grateful to hear more!"</p><p>The old steward stroked his long beard, a confident look on his face. "This insect control manual is called the *Insect Flower Canon*, and it's confirmed to be from Hundred Flowers Valley. Since you're a master of this art, you must be familiar with the name? In the art of insect control, if Hundred Flowers Valley isn't number one, no one dares claim the top spot!"</p><p>Qin Sang genuinely didn't know anything about Hundred Flowers Valley, so he remained impassive, nodding repeatedly, urging the old steward to retrieve the manuals.</p><p>After an incense stick's time.</p><p>The old steward personally brought several manuals.</p><p>Qin Sang could tell the quality of the sword techniques with just a glance at the first page, casually setting them aside and only paying for the *Insect Flower Canon*.</p><p>Finally, he picked up the jade slip containing the *Insect Flower Canon*.</p><p>It was indeed a technique for cultivating spirit insects, with some unique aspects.</p><p>Unfortunately, it was an incomplete text, mostly detailing common spirit insects.  There were very few entries on rare insects, with no mention of the Sky-Eyed Butterfly, Fat Silkworm, or Fire Jade Centipede.</p>
