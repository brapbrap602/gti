<h1>Chapter 2073: The Precious Tree</h1><p>Peach Blossom Valley.</p><p>After Qing Jun and Qin Sang left, this place became a sacred site of the Qingyang Temple. Occasionally, sword cultivators would come to pay their respects to Qingzhu. The arrangements in the valley remained largely unchanged.</p><p>Yu Nu learned how to brew wine and used the valley's peach blossoms to make peach blossom wine.  Excitedly, she brought out a sealed jar to offer Qin Sang a taste.</p><p>It was the same pavilion, the same peach blossom wine, but the person across from him had changed.  The person from that time, who knows where they are now.</p><p>Qin Sang picked up the wine cup; the fragrant aroma filled the air.</p><p>After taking a sip, Qin Sang closed his eyes to savor it for a moment, praising, "Excellent wine."</p><p>Yu Nu was delighted, her eyes crinkling into smiles.</p><p>Without lingering long, Qin Sang and Yu Nu parted ways. He took Li Yu Fu and flew east for a while, arriving at a mundane village.</p><p>The morning mist hadn't yet dispersed below.</p><p>Qin Sang saw a peaceful mountain village, nestled beside a river, serene and harmonious, surrounded by pleasant scenery.</p><p>However, the villagers were far from ordinary; many possessed the aura of cultivators.  The seemingly ordinary village was actually protected by formations, and the outward appearance wasn't the whole picture; there was more to it than met the eye.</p><p>Even ordinary cultivator families wouldn't have such resources.</p><p>"It is said this is Grandmaster Mu's hometown. Grandmaster Mu instructed that he be buried here..."</p><p>Li Yu Fu pointed downwards.</p><p>Behind the village, in an area heavily protected by formations, lay a tomb—the tomb of Mu Yifeng!</p><p>While the formations here were strong, they couldn't compare to the protective arrays of major sects. Naturally, they couldn't stop them. Without any visible action from Qin Sang, he and Li Yu Fu passed through the formations and arrived before the tomb.</p><p>Qin Sang placed a flask of wine and silently gazed at the tombstone.</p><p>He hadn't had many friends in the past, even fewer he could confide in. Tan Hao was gone, and now Mu Yifeng was gone as well.</p><p>The scene at the Bronze Palace, Mu Yifeng shattering the Nine Blazing Divine Blade to spare his life, remained vividly in his memory.</p><p>Li Yu Fu sensed his master's sorrow and sighed inwardly.  The Glass Fairy and he both knew that his master and Grandmaster Mu shared a deep bond.  Naturally, Grandmaster Mu's Qingling energy wouldn't be lacking, but ultimately, it couldn't defy fate.</p><p>Just then, Li Yu Fu sensed an approaching presence.  A moment later, a streak of light appeared on the horizon. It seemed to be passing by, but suddenly veered sharply, descending towards them.</p><p>This streak of light also concealed its presence, not alarming the cultivators in the village.</p><p>Li Yu Fu was somewhat surprised. The newcomer was none other than the current Shaohua Mountain sect master—Qiu Mu Bai.</p><p>Immediately afterward, Li Yu Fu noticed Qiu Mu Bai staring at him in astonishment.  He was startled, then realized his master hadn't used any concealment spells.</p><p>Qin Sang slowly turned around. He hadn't intended to visit, but since he had encountered him here, there was no need to avoid him.</p><p>Recognizing Qin Sang, Qiu Mu Bai trembled.  Furthermore, Qin Sang didn't conceal his cultivation.  Sensing the vast and profound aura emanating from Qin Sang, Qiu Mu Bai was deeply shocked.</p><p>Qiu Mu Bai never thought he would face this Qin junior brother again in his life.  The sudden encounter left him momentarily at a loss. As the head of a sect and a nascent soul cultivator, it had been a long time since he'd been so flustered.</p><p>Qin Sang was the first to bow and say, "Daoist Qiu."</p><p>Qiu Mu Bai's expression shifted slightly, regaining his composure and formally returned the greeting, "Greetings, Daoist Qin."</p><p>Qin Sang's address of "Daoist" clearly indicated his stance.</p><p>With Mu Yifeng gone, the connection between Qin Sang and Shaohua Mountain was completely severed.</p><p>Everything that had happened at Shaohua Mountain was now in the past; both kindness and resentment faded into the wind. Qin Sang wouldn't hold a grudge against Dongyang Bo for his past actions.</p><p>There would be no blame, no special treatment; in the future, they were simply fellow Daoists.</p><p>For Qiu Mu Bai, this was undoubtedly the best possible outcome.</p><p>After exchanging greetings, Qin Sang didn't speak further, continuing to gaze silently at Mu Yifeng's tombstone. Qiu Mu Bai was still reeling in shock and didn't know what to say.</p><p>Li Yu Fu felt the atmosphere was a bit awkward and asked, "Sect Master Qiu, did you also come to pay your respects to Grandmaster Mu?"</p><p>Qiu Mu Bai replied, "I was returning from the outer sea and passed by this place. I don't know why, but I felt a sudden urge to visit Mu junior brother.  I didn't expect to encounter the two Daoists here."</p><p>The more he spoke, the more fluent he became. He realized Qin Sang hadn't put any pressure on him; it was all stemming from his own internal conflict.</p><p>Realizing this, Qiu Mu Bai felt considerably relieved. Looking at Mu Yifeng's tombstone, he spoke partly to himself and partly to explain, "When Mu junior brother returned from that serious injury, I thought he would be like before—finding a way to break through his bottlenecks, benefiting from adversity..."</p><p>At this point, Qiu Mu Bai gave a kind smile.</p><p>Qin Sang also offered a slight smile.  It seemed everyone knew about Mu Yifeng's "trait," but unfortunately, good fortune couldn't last forever.</p><p>“Has the person who injured him been found?” Qin Sang asked.</p><p>Autumn Dusk showed shame on his face: “The enemy is an island lord from the Changyou Clan, his cultivation a level higher than mine. He has always stayed in the rear, rarely appearing on the battlefield. I haven't been able to find a chance to avenge Brother Mu!”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, saying calmly, “Leave this person to me.”</p><p>They spoke for a while longer at the grave. Autumn Dusk invited them to visit the mountain gate, and Qin Sang readily accepted.</p><p>With Autumn Dusk's cultivation progressing, Shaohua Mountain's power was far greater than before, becoming one of the top sects in the North Sea region.  The mountain gate’s appearance was also far superior to what it once was, though the core areas remained the same.</p><p>Sword Gate Pass, Jingyue Peak, Baota Peak, Daomen Peak…</p><p>Qin Sang could still see traces of the past, and those deeply etched memories.</p><p>Autumn Dusk was still cultivating in the former East Yang Lord's cave, atop the mountain where wind and snow raged, making it quite desolate. The cave's furnishings were extremely simple.</p><p>After seating their guests, Autumn Dusk, without calling for an attendant, personally served spiritual tea.</p><p>The stone gate was open, yet the wind and snow couldn't penetrate at all.</p><p>Autumn Dusk said, “Please,” and took a sip from his jade cup. His gaze, through the rising tea mist, looked outward. He sighed softly, "Revitalizing the sect was Master's lifelong wish, and also Brother Mu's.  When I took over the sect leadership from Brother Mu, I've always been apprehensive, walking on thin ice.”</p><p>Qin Sang smiled faintly, “The East Yang Lord certainly wouldn't have imagined Shaohua Mountain would achieve such scale. You've done very well, friend.”</p><p>“In the lower realms, perhaps that’s true. But considering the vast world, countless powerful clans, and countless mysterious forces—a single Changyou Clan can besiege us here. What is little Shaohua Mountain in comparison?”</p><p>Autumn Dusk sighed, “The path ahead is fraught with internal and external strife. Back then, Master told me not to worry too much about the sect, but I simply couldn't do it.”</p><p>“The internal strife you mentioned, is it related to cultivation methods?” Qin Sang asked.</p><p>Autumn Dusk’s expression turned serious, “Precisely!”</p><p>This was the biggest challenge facing all cultivators and sects, and Shaohua Mountain was no exception.</p><p>But considering how the East Yang Lord treated Qin Sang, it was fortunate that Qin Sang didn't harbor immense resentment; he dared not ask for more.</p><p>Now that Qin Sang took the initiative to ask, it ignited a spark of hope within him.</p><p>Qin Sang mused, “If a great path were presented to you, but it required changing your cultivation method, how would you choose?”</p><p>Autumn Dusk's expression tightened. After some thought, he asked, "Would it require changing allegiance to a different sect?”</p><p>Qin Sang said, “It could or it could not.”</p><p>Autumn Dusk understood.  It didn't require changing sects; meaning he could remain in his own sect.  But profound methods aren't easily passed down, and cultivating them entails karmic consequences. The best outcome would be to revere them as the superior sect!</p><p>The worst outcome would be that all the disciples would be attracted to the methods that pointed towards the Great Dao, switching to this method, while the sect's own methods would gradually be neglected. Cultivating the method, admiring the Dao, hearts changing, and then it would be impossible to turn back.</p><p>Cultivators' longing for the Great Dao was no mere empty phrase. Unless Qin Sang set up barriers, everyone pursuing the Great Dao wouldn't willingly join a sect with incomplete methods.</p><p>In that case, their sect's transmission would silently vanish, and the sect would exist in name only.</p><p>Autumn Dusk lowered his head, lost in prolonged thought. This was an incredibly difficult choice. He knew that with Qin Sang's strength and prestige, he could completely forcibly unify the Storm World and destroy other sects. No one could stop his will.</p><p>He didn't do so, leaving a little room for each sect, preserving a vestige of their traditions.  Of course, no matter how Qin Sang chose, the Green Sheep Temple would inevitably become the master of the Storm World, above all other forces.</p><p>Finally, Autumn Dusk let out a long breath and cautiously said, “For myself, seeking the Great Dao, I would cultivate this method. But for the sect, the sect’s teachings must not be lost, the disciples must not be severed. Even if I obtain a higher realm through another path, I will return to help the sect develop its methods!”</p><p>“I understand.”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded and stood up. “Qin has only recently returned, and needs to go elsewhere. I won’t disturb you any longer. Please don’t reveal today’s matters to outsiders for now.”</p><p>“I understand.”</p><p>Autumn Dusk escorted Qin Sang and Li Yu Fu out of the cave. Standing on the mountain peak, his figure remained motionless for a long time.</p><p>…</p><p>Li Yu Fu, following behind Qin Sang, felt his heart stirred.</p><p>While his master hadn't explicitly stated it, he could easily guess, a grand and vast vision already forming in his mind.</p><p>Qin Sang mused, Autumn Dusk's attitude should represent most sects in the Storm World.  No matter what, faced with the crisis of severed Dao paths, having a method placed before them, it was impossible to completely reject it.</p><p>However, if someone were resolute enough, as long as it didn't harm his Dao field, he wasn't incapable of tolerance.</p><p>Leaving Shaohua Mountain, they continued north. Qin Sang learned that the Han Family Head was still alive.</p><p>Once the Pure Yang Sect split, the Han family head followed one faction.  Later, after achieving great cultivation, he subdued the other faction, reunited the sect, and became its leader.</p><p>However, he hasn't yet broken through to the Transcendence stage and is currently in seclusion.  His survival to this point must be due to some fortuitous encounter, but his lifespan is likely nearing its end; this is his only chance.</p><p>Qin Sang, since his cultivation, has had limited interaction with the Han family head; they weren't close friends.  But given their acquaintance during the Great Sui era, and their shared history, Qin Sang sent a pill via Li Yu Fu, without disturbing his seclusion.</p><p>They flew beyond the Seven Great Passes, arriving at the Ancient Immortal Battlefield.</p><p>The battlefield was calm, devoid of raging storms. The ancient prohibitions were dormant, indistinguishable from any other place; ordinary people lived there, and cultivators practiced.</p><p>Cultivators from the Storm Realm had explored the area extensively, reaping various opportunities.</p><p>Qin Sang flew to the edge of the Ancient Immortal Battlefield.  It wasn't as mysterious as imagined; it was no different from anywhere else – the end was simply the ocean.  Any unique aspects were attributed to the Ziwei Palace.</p><p>While exploring the battlefield, Qin Sang sensed the fluctuations of several ancient formations, but they held no interest for him, leaving them for others to discover.</p><p>They were about to depart the Xiaohan Domain when Qin Sang remembered something: a King Kong Fruit had been lost. He'd tasked his disciples with finding it, but to no avail.</p><p>He inquired with Li Yu Fu, who also had no news of the fruit over the years; its whereabouts remained unknown.</p><p>Qin Sang, sensing something, unleashed his divine sense, meticulously scanning the former Northern Star Great Desert.</p><p>After considerable time, he found nothing.  Just as he was about to give up, he sensed something, his figure flashing to the sea, appearing above a small island.</p><p>Located west of the Northern Star Great Desert, it was an ordinary, deserted isle, covered in thick bird droppings.</p><p>Despite its desolate appearance, the island had lush vegetation.  Qin Sang discovered a slender sapling within the jungle.</p><p>The sapling was only knee-high, thin, with only a few leaves.  Towering ancient trees surrounded it, blocking the sunlight.</p><p>It looked like an ordinary sapling, its growth dependent on the death of surrounding trees to create space.</p><p>"That King Kong Fruit has taken root here!"</p><p>Qin Sang was astonished. It was a young King Kong Bodhi tree!</p><p>The tree showed no remarkable qualities. Had Qin Sang not seen a true King Kong Bodhi tree before and recognized the familiar leaf shape, he might have overlooked it.</p><p>However, the King Kong Bodhi tree he'd seen had golden, large leaves; this sapling only revealed a faint golden vein in its leaves upon closer inspection.</p><p>This difference was likely due to the inherent nature of divine objects; before maturation, they wouldn't exhibit supernatural characteristics.</p><p>Qin Sang scanned the entire island with his divine sense. There were no cultivator's dwellings, nor any corpses; its arrival here remained a mystery.</p><p>Once the King Kong Fruit grows into a King Kong Bodhi tree, it loses its original properties.  Only when the divine tree bears new King Kong Fruits will it become one of the Ten Divine Trees.</p><p>However, it was uncertain when that might happen.</p><p>Regardless, it was a fortunate discovery. Even without fruit, such a divine tree could serve as a treasure of the Qingyang Temple, surpassing any worldly artifact.</p><p>Qin Sang laid down formations, manipulating the earth's energy to ensure its safety, before carefully excavating the King Kong Bodhi tree. He temporarily placed it in his small dimensional space, intending to transplant it later.</p><p>Then, they left Xiaohan Domain and headed towards Yinri Realm, one of the four regions of the Northern Star.</p><p>Outside the Xuan Tian Palace.</p><p>Qin Sang and Li Yu Fu stood atop the snow-covered peak, waiting.  A figure flew from afar, transmitting a message:  “Since the Master has arrived, why not come in for a visit?”</p><p>It was Tong Lingyu, the current Palace Master of Xuan Tian Palace.</p><p>Qin Sang, while planning his sect, wouldn’t openly appear, but he still needed to see trusted old friends – for their reassurance, and their cooperation.</p><p>"Daoist Qin?"</p><p>Unsurprisingly, upon seeing Qin Sang, Tong Lingyu was shocked, deeply moved.</p><p>After a reunion, Tong Lingyu sighed, “It's a pity that Liuli isn't here! You know her nature; once she’s decided on something, nothing can stop her.  For years, she single-handedly carried the burden of a realm.  Finally, someone can share her burden.”</p>
