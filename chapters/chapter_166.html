<h1>Chapter 159: Refined Corpses</h1><p>The Di Sha Qi surged into the cave.</p><p>Qin Sang shivered and did not dare to delay. He quickly suppressed his injuries, used his movement technique, and rushed to the depths of the cave. At this moment, he suddenly felt something unusual. He stopped and turned to look behind him.</p><p>He saw golden runes abruptly lighting up on the cave walls after the Di Sha Qi had surged into the cave. These runes were connected by golden threads. Some of them were bright and some were dim. They were everywhere on the cave walls.</p><p>The Di Sha struck the golden light emitted by the runes, but it was blocked from its path of invasion.</p><p>Qin Sang’s eyes lit up. His guess was correct. There was indeed a barrier in the cave that isolated the Di Sha Qi. Otherwise, it would be impossible for anyone to cultivate in such a place.</p><p>But Qin Sang was not happy for long.</p><p>Whether it was because no one was controlling it or if it had been too long, the barrier’s power began to decline. Facing the increasingly enormous amount of Di Sha Qi, these runes only persisted for a short period of time. They quickly turned dim before they were extinguished.</p><p>The Di Sha Qi destroyed the runes in the cave as if they were dry weeds and withered trees. It only slowed down the speed of the invasion.</p><p>When he saw this, all the hope in Qin Sang’s heart disappeared. He sighed and rushed to the depths of the cave. In truth, he did not know what awaited him. He was most afraid that the end of the cave was a dead end, and the Di Sha Qi would not disperse for a long time. He could only take it one step at a time.</p><p>The cave was not wide, and he did not know what was inside it. It was not a good idea to make a commotion and fly on his sword.</p><p>Qin Sang activated Fallen Cloud Wings and hid his body as he advanced.</p><p>This magical artifact had followed Qin Sang from the Yin and Yang School until now. It had been very useful many times. It was a pity that it was essentially an evil artifact, and it would self-destruct sooner or later. Qin Sang tried to use it sparingly and only used it when it was necessary.</p><p>He did not know what the situation in the cave was, so he was very cautious.</p><p>Luckily, the cave was not a dead end. In fact, there were many forks in the road the further he went. The forks were all over the place, and Qin Sang was secretly surprised by how much vaster the space was than he had imagined.</p><p>His figure rushed forward and quickly came to a fork in the road. All of the paths led to the depths of the cave, but one went left, one went up, and one went down.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered for a moment and chose to go down.</p><p>There was no entrance to the cave in the upper part of the cave. It was likely a dead end. Qin Sang had tried to attack the stone wall, but although the barrier on the stone wall could not block the Di Sha Qi, it was impenetrable to him.</p><p>Qin Sang’s reaction at that time was the fastest. The others would probably be below if they had managed to escape into the cave. The cave was a strange place. He decided that he would try to meet up with his companions first before he could deal with any potential danger.</p><p>Qin Sang’s figure flashed forward and arrived at the end of this stone path without any problems. He discovered that a stone door was in front of him, and there seemed to be a barrier protecting it.</p><p>Qin Sang’s expression changed when he saw the obstacle before him. Although there had been stone doors along the way, they had all been open. This was the first time he had encountered such a thing. He knew that if the barrier protecting the stone door was too strong, he would be trapped here!</p><p>He probed it with his spiritual power and easily broke the barrier on the stone door. The barrier on the stone door and the barrier on the wall were not one and the same.</p><p>“Luckily!”</p><p>Qin Sang secretly rejoiced.</p><p>At this moment, a rumbling sound came from behind him. The Di Sha Qi was hot on his trail. Qin Sang did not dare to hesitate any longer. He used force to push the door open, but unexpectedly, a gust of foul wind suddenly struck him.</p><p>“Is there someone inside?”</p><p>Qin Sang was both surprised and delighted. He quickly retreated and dodged this sneak attack.</p><p>The attacker’s speed was not fast, so Qin Sang easily dodged the attack. He then saw a black figure pounce on the spot where he had just been standing. A black human hand was left empty-handed. The five fingers struck the stone wall next to it.</p><p>There was the sound of something being torn apart, and sparks were produced.</p><p>The hand was withered and dry. Its skin was covered in hard and black hair like steel needles. Its fingernails were longer than its fingers and as sharp as blades. They were as black as ink, and there was a strange aura on them that was a dark green color. It was clearly poisonous.</p><p>“Hehe…”</p><p>The black figure turned around, and it was actually a monster that looked like a human but was infinitely more malevolent. It looked like a demon with fangs and claws that were covered in a dark green aura like its fingernails. Underneath the thick black hair, its skin faintly shimmered like metal.</p><p>The monster stared at Qin Sang greedily, and strange sounds came from its throat.</p><p>“A zombie?”</p><p>An expression of surprise appeared on Qin Sang’s face. No wonder he had not noticed the other party’s aura. It was not a living thing. It was a zombie that had been alarmed by his vital energy.</p><p>Flowers and plants, rocks and utensils could all transform into spirits, and dead bodies could naturally do the same.</p><p>In particular, if a cultivator met with an accident and their body was in a strange environment, their spiritual power would be preserved in their dead body, which would mean that it would not decompose for many years. Under the influence of their obsessions, it was possible that their body would transform into a zombie.</p><p>Among the demon sects, there are members who cultivate the corpses and ghosts, proficient in refining the art of the dead. They can refine the corpses of ordinary people or even cultivators into corpse puppets and control them to fight their enemies.</p><p>The "Secret Art of Corpse Pill" Qin Sang obtained from Gutiannan is not the art of refining the dead, but more like the art of alchemy.</p><p>Zombies are the lowest level in the refining of the dead and also the weakest. Most naturally formed zombies belong to this category.</p><p>If the corpse of an ordinary person is buried in a place where Yin energy is strong by chance, it can easily turn into a zombie. Some grow white hair, some black hair, and there are various bizarre shapes. Ordinary people have no idea about the details and think that white zombies are different from black zombies, but in fact, they are all just the most ordinary zombies.</p><p>The weakest zombies only have great strength, are not afraid of pain, and have a tough body. They are also afraid of things with Yang energy. Ordinary people also have ways of subduing them.</p><p>However, if it is a multi-year-old corpse or a corpse puppet refined by a cultivator, this is something that ordinary people cannot deal with.</p><p>The zombie in front of Qin Sang was of this type. Its body was unusually tough like steel, and its movements were flexible, with almost no weaknesses. Additionally, it carried the miasma of a zombie on its body. A cultivator at the eighth or ninth level of the Qi Refining period would have to spend some effort to deal with it. A little carelessness could end up in the zombie's hands.</p><p>When a zombie absorbs enough Yin energy, it can transform into a fierce corpse. Powerful fierce corpses move like the wind and can control the energy of the Yin; even the cultivators of the Foundation Establishment period must be somewhat wary of them.</p><p>Those that naturally transform into fierce corpses are extremely rare. Furthermore, they hate living things, are inherently bloodthirsty, and if they appear in the mortal world, they will certainly create a great disaster.</p><p>Some members of the demon sects can draw the energy of the Yin and carefully refine it to produce fierce corpse puppets.</p><p>It is said that above fierce corpses, there are flying sky yakshas which can rival the Golden Core cultivators. They are proficient in the Five Elements Escape Technique, powerful, and extremely unpredictable.</p><p>There are not many members of the demon sects who can refine corpse puppets on the level of flying sky yakshas. The difficulty can be imagined. Not only do they require a powerful cultivator's body, they also have to consume many rare spiritual objects. The process is extremely complicated, and it is comparable to refining a magic weapon.</p><p>In ancient times, there were heavenly corpses that succeeded in their cultivation and ascended to the immortal world, but it is already difficult for human cultivators of today to reach the Nascent Soul period. As for those things, they can only exist in legends.</p><p>Seeing that the thing that sneak attacked him was a zombie, Qin Sang was somewhat disappointed. He immediately summoned the Five Elements Law Breaking Sword and directly cut it into two sections, then his figure flashed and swept to the side of the beheaded zombie.</p>
