Chapter 154: Using Different Approaches

When faced with the old man's question, Yu Daiyue's expression did not change. "Fellow Daoist Baiyun, my fellow disciple Qingting and I are merely being cautious. You should understand this with your many years of experience traveling the pugilist world. As long as the ruins of the ancient cultivator are real, it matters little whether they are located in the Tianduan Mountains or the Yuncang Marshes."

Qingting also said, "Fellow Daoist, we absolutely did not intend to deceive you. We really had no other choice. As all of you fellow Daoists should be able to roughly estimate from the speed of our magic weapons, we are located at the point where the Tianduan Mountain Range and the Yuncang Marshes meet. If you're worried that some villainous demon sect member will appear, you don't need to be. Ever since the great demon sect to the south of the Tianduan Mountains, the Bloody Fiend Sect, was annihilated by the Pure Yang Sect, regardless of size, the demon sects to the south of the Bloody Fiend Sect either precipitously fled north or retreated into the depths of the Tianduan Mountains, not daring to show their faces. There really isn't much danger here."

The old man's expression relaxed a bit, and the other four people nodded slightly, indicating that they accepted their explanation.

Seeing that he had finally calmed everyone's dissatisfaction, Yu Daiyue secretly breathed a sigh of relief. He walked to the edge of the summit and pointed in the direction to the southeast. "The ruins of the ancient cultivator are a few hundred li ahead in the canyon between these two mountains. There's a layer of Yin Wind formation overhead. It's nothing that you will have trouble getting through, and it won't make too much of a commotion. But when we break the formation, it will definitely make a lot of noise. There's no guarantee that it won't be heard outside and cause a disturbance that might alert the great demons in the depths of the Tianduan Mountains. Let's divide ourselves into two teams that will circle around and secretly eliminate all the monsters around, so that there will be no disorder breaking out."

No one raised any objections, and they quickly divided themselves into two teams.

Li Zai, the old man, and the Liu brothers went with Qingting to take the northern path, while Qin Sang, Wu Yuesheng, and Yu Daiyue took the southern path.

The three Foundation Establishment cultivators worked together and did not encounter too much trouble along the way. The Five Elements Breaking Formation Sword was enough for Qin Sang to use as a warning signal, and when Yu Daiyue saw the Five Elements Breaking Formation Sword, his eyes lit up.

"If the formation doesn't go well, we may have to ask fellow Daoist Qin for help."

Qin Sang naturally agreed.

...

A deep valley between two mountains.

A huge mountain range extended from north to south, and one couldn't see the ends of it. The mountain range lay prone on the earth like a crouching dragon, and every peak of it was extremely precipitous.

But the canyon where the ruins of the ancient cultivator were located, the peaks of the mountains on both sides looked very ordinary, not at all eye-catching.

The cliffs almost touched each other, forming a narrow pass that was actually most spacious as one went deeper into it. This was why the canyon was so well hidden; only when one entered deep into the mountains did they realize that there was such a large canyon there.

The cliffs were as precipitous as if they had been cut with a sword, and they were bare on the top, not having a single plant or tree, making it difficult to climb. The rocks were all a dull dark blue, and they did not even have any moss on them, making them look deathly still.

A thick, heavy mist hung over the canyon, preventing people from seeing through it.

The Tianduan Mountains were a continuous range of mountains that were very chilly and humid. The many large and deep marshes and valleys in the mountains were covered in layers of dead leaves, which hid deep, bottomless mud that produced poisonous vapors that could kill people.

On the way to the valley, they had traveled through similar poisonous areas.

But the poisonous vapors of this canyon were different from those of other places. After examining it with his divine sense, he discovered that it was not mist, but rather formed by a thick cloud of black Yin Wind. It looked like countless giant black pythons had become entangled, which made it very strange.

The three of them skirted around the area, taking two days to eliminate all of the monsters of the entire mountain range. When they arrived at the ruins of the ancient cultivator, the others hadn't arrived yet.

"Are the ruins of the ancient cultivator here?"

The three of them hovered above the canyon and looked down. Wu Yuesheng asked this question with some surprise.

"That's right," Yu Daiyue nodded. "This place is too well hidden, and fellow disciple Qingting and I searched for a long time before we finally found this place. This Yin Wind has been cleverly disguised as poisonous vapor, and we nearly overlooked it. Fellow disciples, look at this Yin Wind. It has both form and substance, and it definitely didn't form naturally. After falling into the Yin Wind, your figure will not only waver, making it difficult to stand, but there will also be endless demonic sounds harassing you. Any monster or cultivator that is even slightly weaker than average who accidentally enters this area will definitely meet with disaster. After we enter the Yin Wind formation, we must immediately plummet downwards as quickly as possible to leave this area."

After hearing this, Qin Sang gave it some thought and asked, "Are there any spirit veins here?"

Yu Daiyue nodded and said, "Fellow Daoist Qin, you're very meticulous. There really is a hidden spirit vein deep beneath the earth of this mountain range. But fellow disciple Qingting and I have only found two unformed spiritual eyes, which is very abnormal. We suspect that the spirit eyes of the spirit veins are located beneath the canyon. This is why we made bold to say that this is most likely the cave of an ancient cultivator."

Qin Sang nodded secretly. If one had the strength, one's cave would definitely be located at the spirit eyes. If one was sealing a demonic object, it would have to be in a special situation for one not to have such high standards, as one would be wasting a great opportunity.

Qin Sang wasn't very afraid of evil spirits either. The癸水阴雷咒 was the nemesis of ghosts and demons, so he just needed to proceed with caution.

With that in mind, Qin Sang stared at the Yin Wind Barrier for a moment and said, "It looks more like it was used to hide the cave entrance, to prevent outsiders from disturbing it. It seems like the array below is the main defensive array."

The three of them sat on the mountaintop to meditate and regulate their breathing. After a few hours, Qing Ting and the others finally arrived.

"We ran into a Black Tiger at the Yao Ling stage. It cost us some time."

Hearing their explanation, Qin Sang and the others were a little envious. The bodies of Yao Ling stage demon beasts were excellent spiritual materials. Judging from the excitement on the faces of the Liu brothers, they must have had a good harvest.

After Qing Ting and the others had finished regulating their breathing, everyone flew to the canyon.

Qing Ting's expression was slightly heavy as he reminded them, "Fellow Daoists, don't be careless. Before entering the Yin Wind Barrier, prepare your defenses and protection for your souls. If you fall into the barrier, the strong Yin Wind will blow us away immediately. Everyone will be overwhelmed, so don't try to help anyone else."

Everyone's expressions grew solemn.

Qin Sang wasn't afraid of the so-called Demonic Sound, so he just activated the Celestial Tears, forming a light membrane around his body. He also held the Soul Devouring Cone in his palm, just in case.

Most of the others used their own methods.

Qing Ting and Yu Daiyue had previous experience, so they just activated one defensive magic tool, just like Qin Sang. Li Zai was more flamboyant, with sword light swirling around him like a swimming dragon.

As for Wu Yuesheng, Qin Sang couldn't feel any fluctuations in his aura.

White Cloud Daoist activated a cloth bag, which he held over his head. The bag looked like something a mortal would use to store grain, and it was a dull gray.

The Liu brothers were the ones who made Qin Sang most curious. How could these twin brothers pass through the Yin Wind, which even Foundation Establishment cultivators were afraid of?

But then the Liu brothers pressed their backs together and held identical magic seals in their hands, chanting a mantra.

After some incantations, a divine light shot out from the center of their brows, forming a light barrier around them. Then the light barrier closed in on their bodies and disappeared.

At that moment, Qin Sang felt a faint sense of danger from the Liu brothers. He couldn't help but be secretly surprised. It seemed that Yu Daiyue hadn't exaggerated: the Liu brothers really had the ability to fight against Foundation Establishment cultivators.
