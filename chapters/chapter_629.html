Chapter 621: Core Formation

“Junior Brother Tong, summon your natal Gu insects and form a defensive formation with me. We must give it our all and hold nothing back. This demon is highly intelligent and cunning. If it senses danger, it will surely devour the spirit fruit and flee before it fully ripens. The other disciples should follow from a distance and observe. Once the greater demon is slain, you can deal with the lesser demons. Any spiritual herbs or materials gathered will be yours to keep…”

Over thirty cultivators stood on the mountaintop.

Six were Foundation Establishment cultivators, while the rest were only at the Qi Refining stage.

The Qi Refining cultivators wore similar robes, with a strange pattern of a ‘worm’ woven on their backs.

If Qin Sang were here, he would have recognized Yuan Hu, who had hunted the Blood-Winged Ghost-Head Hornets with him.

The speaker was a wizened elder with white hair and kind eyes. He held a black wooden staff, its surface inscribed with eerie patterns in blue insect blood.

The elder's instructions were interrupted by a sudden clap of thunder.

Everyone's expression changed drastically. They flew into the air and looked towards the deep mountains.

In the southwest, a large mass of dark clouds had gathered above a mountain peak. Lightning flashed and thunder roared within the clouds.

After the initial thunderclap, a continuous rumble followed, the dark clouds growing thicker as lightning danced within.

Strangely, the clouds and lightning were confined to the mountain peak and an area less than a thousand zhang around it. Elsewhere, the sky was clear, with no sign of a storm.

The area resembled the end of the world, with terrifying lightning bolts striking close to the mountaintop, threatening to destroy it at any moment.

The deafening thunder shook the earth and terrified all living beings.

Frightened cries of birds and beasts echoed from the surrounding mountains. Both ordinary animals and various demons were scared away, fleeing in all directions.

The dark clouds continued to gather, the wind howled, yet no rain fell.

The Five Poison Sect cultivators exchanged glances. Although they had never witnessed it firsthand, they had read in their sect's records that this phenomenon resembled a specific event.

The wizened elder's face was grim.

‘Boom!’

A muffled sound erupted. The spiritual energy around the mountain peak seemed to be drawn towards the area beneath the dark clouds, forming a funnel-like shape.

Upon seeing this, everyone realized what was happening: someone was undergoing Core Formation!

“Senior Brother, I remember that mountain is the nest of the Black-Winged Eagle. Could it be…?”

Junior Brother Tong flew to the wizened elder's side, his voice trembling slightly.

If a demon beast formed a demon core, the entire Xiong Mountain region, including the Five Poison Sect, would be powerless to resist it unless they remained within their sect.

If it were a bloodthirsty demon, the entire region would suffer.

The wizened elder clearly thought of this as well. The veins on his hand gripping the staff bulged. He said in a deep voice, “It shouldn't be that beast. I saw it three years ago, and it was only at the mid-stage Demon Spirit realm. Its potential is almost exhausted. Even if it consumed some heavenly treasure, it's impossible for the Black-Winged Eagle to cross the late-stage Demon Spirit realm and directly form a core in just three years. Moreover, demon beasts' Core Formation seems to differ from cultivators…”

Junior Brother Tong was taken aback. “Senior Brother, you suspect…”

The wizened elder nodded, his expression serious.

He suspected that a passing or secluded cultivator had occupied the Black-Winged Eagle's lair to undergo Core Formation.

A powerful outsider's presence was not good news for the Five Poison Sect.

Seeing the continuing phenomenon, the wizened elder made a decision. “Junior Brother Tong, immediately return to the sect with everyone and activate the mountain protection formation. Do not allow anyone to enter the mountain without my order! As for those larger settlements, we can't worry about them for now.”

Junior Brother Tong's face was anxious. “Senior Brother, aren't you coming back?”

The wizened elder shook his head. “I can't leave. We've caused such a commotion here, it definitely won't escape that person's notice. Leaving now would provoke resentment. If that person is just passing through, it's best to respectfully send them off. If they intend to stay, our Five Poison Sect will eventually have to face them. It's better to understand their intentions early on. If I am killed, Junior Brother Tong will take charge of the sect. Immediately send a message for help.”

Junior Brother Tong was extremely anxious. “Senior Brother, you go back. I'll stay…”

“You don't carry enough weight!”

The wizened elder said in a deep voice, “Don't worry, I know what I'm doing. The entire Western Frontier is barren, and our Xiong Mountain is no exception. Core Formation cultivators soar above the world. Why would they confine themselves to this small place? It's most likely someone passing through. My previous arrangements were just precautions.”

As they spoke, the thunder gradually subsided, and the dark clouds dispersed.

The spiritual energy funnel became more pronounced.

Seven-colored rays of light began to appear around the funnel, and the sky above the mountain peak was filled with colorful clouds, a breathtaking sight.

“Not good! The clouds appear, the core is about to form. Go quickly!”

The wizened elder urged his disciples to leave. He adjusted his appearance and flew towards the phenomenon.

When he arrived, the entire mountain peak was bathed in a radiant glow.

After a while, the glow dissipated, and the surrounding spiritual energy gradually calmed down, returning to normal.

The wizened elder waited for a moment. Seeing no movement from the cave on the mountain, he pondered briefly and flew towards the summit.

Unexpectedly, a dark figure flashed before him as he reached the cave entrance.

“Hiss…”

The wizened elder was startled by the ferocious Nightwalker. Sensing its powerful aura, he gasped in shock.

“Not only did he successfully form a core, but he also possesses a corpse puppet transformed into a Nightwalker…”

The wizened elder groaned inwardly, envious of the person inside the cave.

He wondered what the cultivator's natal Gu insect was. Since they had successfully formed a core, it was likely that their natal Gu insect had also undergone transformation.

After forming a core, this person would immediately dominate their peers and might even be able to challenge those at higher realms.

Such individuals were rare, even in the renowned sects outside the Western Frontier. They might even be descendants of Nascent Soul cultivators, beyond his envy.

However, seeing this, the wizened elder felt relieved.

This mysterious person with a powerful heritage likely wouldn't be interested in the resources of Xiong Mountain.

The wizened elder bowed towards the cave from a distance, cleared his throat, and said, “Five Poison Sect Master, Cui Xuanzi, greets Senior.”

‘Bang!’

A stone in front of the cave suddenly exploded.

Cui Xuanzi's pupils constricted as a surprisingly young man emerged from the darkness.

Sunlight fell upon him, making him appear spirited and full of vitality.

The young man smiled at him and said amicably, “Are you the Five Poison Sect Master? I was passing through this area and sensed the Core Formation energy, so I sought a place to undergo the process. Fortunately, I succeeded, but I didn't expect to disturb you.”
