<h1>Chapter 457: Snow Lotus and Iris</h1><p>Serpent Witch continued, "You've probably guessed by now, you're not the only ones entering Sky Peak. You'll be competing with cultivators from the Heavenly Alliance for the Star Essence Stones. Their strength is comparable to yours. If you encounter them, do not underestimate them, or you'll not only fail to retrieve the stones but also lose your life on Sky Peak, with no one to even collect your body."</p><p>After such a long war, who standing here hasn't shed blood?</p><p>None here were merciful.</p><p>They knew what to do without Serpent Witch telling them.</p><p>A meticulous demonic cultivator asked, "Dare I ask, Island Lord, how many from the Heavenly Alliance have entered Sky Peak?"</p><p>Vice Island Lord Xiao, who had been standing beside Serpent Witch, spoke for the first time, "The same as you, thirty-three."</p><p>The demonic cultivator sneered, "Thirty-three as well... Seems like we'll be meeting old friends."</p><p>"Let me tell you about Sky Peak..."</p><p>Vice Island Lord Xiao pointed a finger at the void, conjuring an image of a majestic peak. "This is Sky Peak. The Star Essence Stones are up there..."</p><p>Qin Sang and the others watched the illusion carefully as Vice Island Lord Xiao explained.</p><p>After a full quarter of an hour, Vice Island Lord Xiao finished, waved his hand to dissipate the illusion, and said, "These are only a small fraction of the dangers within Sky Peak. Due to its unique restrictions, most of Sky Peak remains unexplored, so you'll have to be careful. The time Sky Peak is open is very short, so you can't waste a single moment. You must focus all your efforts on finding the Star Essence Stones.  Finally, Stargazing Island will reward you based on the number of stones you retrieve. The treasures are here..."</p><p>As he spoke, Vice Island Lord Xiao gestured, and several rays of light shot out from his waist, transforming into rainbows.</p><p>The hall was instantly filled with dazzling light, almost blinding everyone.</p><p>A total of ten rays of light hovered before them. Each one contained a treasure: medicinal herbs, pills, talismans, and magical artifacts.</p><p>The ten treasures were all different, but each one was precious!</p><p>As these treasures appeared, Qin Sang and the others' eyes burned with fervor.  They couldn't take it all in, widening their eyes, eager to examine each one.</p><p>"That's the healing medicine, Restoration Pill!"</p><p>"That talisman... it's a Talisman Treasure!  Looks like a Protective Talisman!"</p><p>"What artifact is that? It radiates such a terrifying aura!"</p><p>"Could that be the Profound Truth Pill? It's said to aid in Core Formation..."</p><p>...</p><p>Exclamations filled the hall.</p><p>However, the chaos was short-lived. The next moment, the hall fell deathly silent.</p><p>Almost everyone's gaze was fixed on the leftmost ray of light. Even the resolute Qin Sang couldn't help but feel a ripple of excitement.</p><p>The others were even less composed than Qin Sang.</p><p>Within the light, two spiritual herbs were nestled.</p><p>One white, one red, complementing each other.</p><p>The white herb was shaped like a blooming lotus, pure white from petal to root, without a single blemish, immaculately pure and ethereal.</p><p>It resembled a sacred herb, inspiring reverence.</p><p>A strange, icy aura emanated from the herb, yet miraculously, the cultivators felt no harm from its chill.</p><p>It had a name that drove all Foundation Establishment cultivators mad â€“ Snow Lotus!</p><p>The other herb was called Iris!</p><p>Unlike the sacred Snow Lotus, the Iris was vibrant and fiery red, its long petals layered upon each other like a phoenix tail, dazzling and flamboyant.</p><p>The Iris emanated a warm, yang energy.</p><p>The two herbs, one yin and one yang, were exceptionally rare.  Their properties were perfectly harmonious, embodying the balance of yin and yang essential for Core Formation.</p><p>Indeed, the Snow Lotus and Iris, used together, were the most potent aids to Core Formation in the current cultivation world.</p><p>They didn't need to be refined into pills; simply refining them during Core Formation would suffice.</p><p>Of course, this didn't guarantee successful Core Formation.</p><p>The success rate for Core Formation was inherently low, like crossing a single-plank bridge amidst a vast army. Those who succeeded possessed both luck and talent.</p><p>Even with treasures like the Snow Lotus and Iris, the success rate might only increase by ten or twenty percent, remaining pitifully low.</p><p>What was even more frustrating was that having more spiritual herbs didn't necessarily increase the chances of success.</p><p>Qin Sang possessed the Kan Li Core Formation Pill bestowed by his sect. Even if he obtained the Snow Lotus and Iris, their effects wouldn't stack with the pill.</p><p>He could only try them one by one.</p><p>Vice Island Lord Xiao smiled as he watched everyone.  Once they calmed down, he said, "See these treasures? After you return from Sky Peak, whoever retrieves the most Star Essence Stones will choose first."</p><p>Someone hurriedly asked, "Including the Snow Lotus and Iris?"</p><p>"Of course!"</p><p>Vice Island Lord Xiao pointed at the ray of light, "I needn't explain how precious these two herbs are. I doubt anyone here wouldn't want them. Unfortunately, Stargazing Island only has this one pair. Whoever contributes the most and retrieves the most Star Essence Stones will have them! Of course, if you don't want the Snow Lotus and Iris, you can choose other treasures. We won't stop you."</p><p>Almost everyone present was at the False Core realm or close to it, facing the crucial stage of Core Formation. Who wouldn't want the Snow Lotus and Iris?</p><p>Even Ji Wu, who had been eyeing the Restoration Pill, shifted his gaze after seeing the two herbs, forgetting his master.</p><p>However, there was only one pair of these herbs!</p><p>Fortunately, among the ten rays of light, there were five other treasures that could aid in Core Formation, including the Profound Truth Pill.  Their effects varied, but all were inferior to the two herbs.</p><p>Stargazing Island had clearly grasped their desires and knew how to motivate them.</p><p>Each treasure was rare and hard to come by, only Stargazing Island could produce them.</p><p>Unfortunately, even six such treasures were insufficient for the thirty-three people present.</p><p>Moreover, there were only ten rays of light, meaning only ten people would be rewarded.  The rest would have gone through all this for nothing!</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>Vice Island Lord Xiao flicked his sleeve, withdrawing the rays of light.</p><p>As the treasures vanished, disappointment filled everyone's faces, yet they dared not act against Vice Island Lord Xiao.</p><p>"Is everything clear?"</p><p>Vice Island Lord Xiao swept his gaze over them, indifferent to their thoughts.  "If you want these treasures, return to your caves and cultivate, bringing yourselves to peak condition. Await further instructions.  Now, you may leave."</p><p>With that, Vice Island Lord Xiao and Serpent Witch vanished.</p><p>After the two Island Lords left, everyone remained silent for a moment, sizing each other up with wary glances.</p><p>Their rivals weren't only the Heavenly Alliance, but also each other.</p><p>None present were weak. Anyone had a chance to obtain the treasures.  With similar strengths, who would fear whom?</p>
