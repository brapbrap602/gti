<h1>Chapter 735: The Great Shaman</h1><p>The Wang sisters opened their mouths to speak, but Qin Sang interrupted in a deep voice, "This is no place to linger. Follow me!" Seeing the seriousness on Qin Sang's face, the two women immediately realized the situation was worse than they imagined. Without a word, they organized their people and assisted Qin Sang.</p><p>Just then, a middle-aged man stepped forward and bowed, saying, "Are you Daoist Qing Feng? I come bearing a message from Elder Zou..."</p><p>Despite the chaos, Qin Sang turned, observing the man. Seeing his distinguished demeanor, he nodded. "I am Qing Feng. Speak your message."</p><p>"This..." The middle-aged man hesitated, then transmitted his voice, "Elder Zou says the Seven Kills Hall will be breached in five years by the Great Shaman of the Wu Clan. He urges you to prepare."</p><p>"Five years. Understood." Qin Sang nodded. There was still ample time.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang froze, suspecting he'd misheard. "What? The Great Shaman will breach the formation? The Seven Kills Hall is a human sanctuary, containing ancient cultivators' treasures.  Wasn't the Wu Clan's Nascent Soul cultivators always forbidden from entering? Why ask the Great Shaman to intervene?"</p><p>"Great Shaman" was a specific title within the Wu Clan, reserved for peak Nascent Soul late-stage cultivators. Currently, there was only one known Great Shaman, whose sanctuary was on Shaman Mountain. Qin Sang had learned this from Elder Zou when they passed by Shaman Mountain.</p><p>Human factions had always been wary of the Wu Clan, fearing they might acquire some treasure from the Seven Kills Hall. Preventing Nascent Soul Wu Clan members from interfering with the Seven Kills Hall was a consensus among all human factions.</p><p>Unexpectedly, after the recent conflict between the two races, the humans had compromised on this matter. This was completely unexpected. There must have been some sort of agreement between the two races; otherwise, this situation wouldn't have occurred.  What treasure in the Seven Kills Hall could attract the Great Shaman?</p><p>Could the premature opening of the Seven Kills Hall, twenty years ahead of schedule, be related to the Wu Clan?  The situation within the Seven Kills Hall was bound to be even more complex and unpredictable.</p><p>The middle-aged man replied, "Elder Zou said this information has been confirmed by the Merchant Alliance. As for the reason, Elder Zou didn't know. He only said to be extremely careful. Also, the Merchant Alliance requests that you meet with others on Desolate Island before the Seven Kills Hall opens and proceed together. No delays are permitted."</p><p>Qin Sang led the group while pondering. He hadn't expected the Wu Clan, especially a peak Nascent Soul late-stage cultivator, to be involved in this Seven Kills Hall expedition. No one could predict what would happen there.</p><p>"Shouldn't the strength of human cultivators be comparable to the Wu Clan? Does this mean there will be at least two Nascent Soul late-stage Grand Cultivators in the Seven Kills Hall? What if they fight... What should I do?"</p><p>From the Small Cold Region to the Vast Ocean Region, Deity Transformation cultivators were legendary figures. The recognized peak cultivators were Nascent Soul late-stage Grand Cultivators. The vast Vast Ocean Region supposedly had only a handful of these Grand Cultivators, while the Small Cold Region had none.</p><p>The thought of being in the same secret realm with them sent shivers down Qin Sang's spine. He could only pray they weren't after the Celestial Pagoda.</p><p>Just as Qin Sang was lost in thought, a thunderous roar echoed from the sky.  The entire battlefield seemed to fall silent.  Qin Sang looked up in horror and saw two bell-like, ferocious eyes staring at him from among the horde of demons. The owner of those eyes was a giant turtle.</p><p>The turtle was massive, its shell covered in mysterious runes that shimmered with a mystical light, indicating formidable defenses.  This demon was a late-stage Core Formation demon!</p><p>"It's him!" Qin Sang recognized the demon, his heart tightening.  He had lost one of his two Flying Night Demons to this very turtle.</p><p>After subduing the Twin-Headed Flood Dragon, Qin Sang became dissatisfied with hunting only early-stage Core Formation beasts. He started targeting mid-stage Core Formation beasts, repeatedly succeeding, and accumulating a substantial fortune. Since the beasts he encountered were either not very intelligent or weaker than the Twin-Headed Flood Dragon, he hadn't considered replacing it.</p><p>But as the saying goes, there are no guarantees in life.</p><p>Once, Qin Sang was discovered by this giant turtle and chased for an entire day. He eventually managed to escape by setting up a diversion, but the Flying Night Demon refined from Du Han's Core was destroyed by the turtle.</p><p>He hadn't expected to encounter it again here.  And the creature seemed to remember him, its eyes filled with murderous intent.</p><p>Beside the giant turtle were a dozen other demons, all at the Core Formation stage.  Among them, cultivators were being besieged. Qin Sang saw a familiar faceâ€”Master Yuan San.</p><p>Master Yuan San was a late-stage Core Formation cultivator, said to be nearing the Nascent Soul bottleneck. He was one of the top cultivators on Five Elements Island.</p><p>The woman had mentioned everyone fighting for themselves when Wood Element Island was breached, and it seemed she wasn't exaggerating. Even Master Yuan San was trapped, with only a few people remaining by his side.</p><p>"Roar! Roar!" The giant turtle glared at Qin Sang, roaring furiously. Two demons suddenly broke off from the fight, seemingly following the giant turtle's command, and swooped down.</p><p>These two demons were both mid-stage Core Formation, ferocious and formidable opponents.</p><p>With their departure, Master Yuan San and the others finally had a moment to breathe, but Qin Sang was in trouble.  He hadn't anticipated the giant turtle's lingering hatred.  This was bad. The people following him would be caught in the crossfire.</p><p>Qin Sang quickly whispered to the Wang sisters, "Follow the Flying Night Demon and escape. With its help, you should be able to break through. Once you're out, immediately contact the other islands. Tell them the entire Demon Sea is in turmoil. This beast tide is unprecedented. With so many cultivators dying here, they won't be spared. Request reinforcements immediately!"</p><p>In a battle of this level, the Flying Night Demon's strength was insufficient. Having it assist the sisters in escaping to get reinforcements was the best course of action.</p><p>After breaking through to the next realm, Qin Sang's cultivation and divine sense had improved, making it easier to control the Flying Night Demon from a greater distance.</p><p>The Wang sisters understood the gravity of the situation and obeyed his commands.  All the cultivators surrounded the Flying Night Demon, forming an arrowhead, and charged towards the perimeter.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced back. The two demons were indeed heading straight for him.</p><p>He pondered briefly, then called out to the Twin-Headed Flood Dragon and charged in another direction.  The two demons changed course, their eyes fixed on Qin Sang.</p><p>These two demons were incredibly fast.  Qin Sang could easily outrun them under normal circumstances, but the surrounding beast tide significantly slowed him down.</p><p>Moreover, the sea beasts seemed to have received orders, becoming even more frenzied. Some even used their bodies to crash against his sword light. Qin Sang could kill them easily, but his speed was inevitably affected. As soon as he killed one batch, another would appear, seemingly endless.</p>
