<h1>Chapter 2088: Secret Collusion</h1><p>“General, what were the results of the last battle?”</p><p>A shadowy figure bowed and inquired.</p><p>Minshan burst into laughter, his face beaming.  “The compensation you requested has been prepared by my clan and will be sent to your designated location.  You can send someone to collect it in ten days.”</p><p>The shadowy figure smiled. “I trust the General implicitly.”</p><p>Several exchanges later, both parties kept their promises. Minshan achieved victory, the shadowy figure received their reward—a mutually beneficial arrangement that further strengthened their relationship.</p><p>“Your personal visit suggests important news,” Minshan said, his eyes narrowed.</p><p>“General, have you prepared the Azure Spirit Qi?” the shadowy figure asked significantly.</p><p>Minshan’s spirits lifted.</p><p>The shadowy figure was undoubtedly greedy—otherwise he wouldn’t have betrayed anyone—but he was also discreet. The compensation he requested always matched the value of the intelligence, never exceeding it.</p><p>His request for Azure Spirit Qi demonstrated his confidence in this intelligence.</p><p>“I have a vial of Azure Spirit Qi right here in my tent!”</p><p>Minshan’s expression turned serious. “If your information proves true, I will gladly hand it over.  And if we conquer North Sea, I’ll give you even more Azure Spirit Qi!”</p><p>“The General is indeed decisive!”</p><p>The shadowy figure laughed, a hint of urgency in his voice.  “This information concerns the Green Sheep Temple. Its importance needs no further explanation…”</p><p>Minshan remained unmoved.  “I am eager to hear it.”</p><p>“The Green Sheep Temple intends to re-establish its mountain gate.  I believe the General is aware of this,” the shadowy figure said.</p><p>Minshan nodded. They had other channels, obtaining information from those other tribes.  They had known about this shortly after the three tribes' joint council.</p><p>However, he didn't see any exploitable opportunities.</p><p>The Green Sheep Temple held immense prestige among those tribes, a top-tier sect.  Their intention to reopen their mountain gate to enhance their presence was quite normal.  It was said this move unsettled the other tribes, but the impact wouldn't be immediate.</p><p>“The General only knows part of the story. The Green Sheep Temple’s new mountain gate and its protective formation are extraordinary…”</p><p>The shadowy figure spoke mysteriously, revealing the secrets of the Green Sheep Temple’s protective formation.</p><p>Minshan's gaze flickered.  “Such secrets are likely known to very few beyond the Green Sheep Temple. How did you discover this information, and why are you so certain?”</p><p>The shadowy figure said calmly, “The General needn't inquire into these matters. You can send people to investigate. But this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. If you miss it, you will deeply regret it!”</p><p>“The Temple is supposedly sealed; how can we verify this?”</p><p>Minshan frowned, deep in thought.</p><p>This information had some value, but it fell far short of his expectations.  The Green Sheep Temple was only one of the top sects.  Even if the Temple's masters were occupied, the strength of other sects should not be underestimated. They could still defend North Sea.</p><p>The shadowy figure shook his head. “You shouldn’t investigate the Green Sheep Temple directly; that would alert them. Instead, monitor the factions and cultivators allied with the Green Sheep Temple. A formation so complex couldn't be completed by the Temple alone; they must seek assistance. The Green Sheep Temple's ancestral home is in the North Star region of the North Sea, and most of their allies are from North Sea, their most important ally being the Xuan Tian Palace.  When the time comes, many of Xuan Tian Palace’s masters, including the Glass Fairy, will likely be summoned to Central Plains, along with other allies of the Green Sheep Temple. With so many masters gone, North Sea will be vulnerable. Isn't this the General’s chance?”</p><p>At this, Minshan was truly tempted. If the situation unfolded as the shadowy figure described, it would indeed be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.</p><p>The premise, of course, was that the shadowy figure’s information was accurate.</p><p>Thinking this, his expression remained hesitant.  “Even if this is true, with the teleportation array, they can return quickly. Our window of opportunity would be very short, making significant gains unlikely…”</p><p>The shadowy figure suddenly burst into laughter, his mockery of Minshan unconcealed.  “Does the General intend to conquer the entire North Sea at once? This isn't the old days!”</p><p>He paused, continuing,  “Once the Green Sheep Temple activates the formation, stopping it won't be easy. Central Plains forces will initially observe. You have more time than you think. Don't rush; proceed step by step. Take advantage of this to breach North Sea's carefully laid defenses, perhaps even seize a region, and then gradually expand your influence. Of course, if the General could advance directly, conquer the Crescent Moon region, and destroy the ancient teleportation array, cutting North Sea off from Central Plains, making it an isolated island— then you might have a chance!”</p><p>These were two distinct strategies, both seemingly feasible.</p><p>Minshan hesitated.</p><p>The shadowy figure said, “You have plenty of time. Return and carefully consider before making a decision.”</p><p>I will closely monitor the Qingyang Temple and its allies.  Once this is accomplished, I hope the General will keep his word! However, once the General makes a decision, remember to prepare thoroughly.”</p><p>His eagerness regarding the Qingling energy is only natural.</p><p>Having said that, the shadowy figure did not wait for Minshan to reply, their form gradually fading.</p><p>Minshan, recovering his composure, bowed in farewell, “Farewell, friend.”</p><p>In the General’s tent.</p><p>Minshan sat at his desk, lost in thought.</p><p>The experiences and observations of his avatar were as if he had personally witnessed them.  He had far too much to consider.</p><p>They couldn't stake everything on a single piece of intelligence.</p><p>Was the shadowy figure trustworthy, or were those foreign tribes using a long line to hook them, luring them into a trap?</p><p>However, they were not without methods of verification.</p><p>Minshan pondered silently, considering how to approach Qingyang Temple, or obtain corroborating evidence elsewhere.</p><p>To attack the North Sea requires further consideration; the North Sea's forces are not substantial.  If a large army were dispatched from Zhongzhou, it would lose its deterrent effect, and Zhongzhou might seize the opportunity to cause trouble, leading to a loss on all fronts.</p><p>The “Demon Sea” and “Canglang Sea” mentioned by those foreign tribes are now where the Changyou army is stationed. This serves a dual purpose: to guard against any intentions the foreign tribes might have towards the polluted lands, and to allow the various armies to take turns resting.</p><p>Once the decision to attack is made, troops must be dispatched from there, but they must take a circuitous route to avoid detection by the foreign tribes' scouts.  The shadowy figure was right; they must prepare in advance.</p><p>In the quiet hall, Minshan sat alone, motionless for a long time.</p><p>…</p><p>Qingyang Temple.</p><p>Forbidden Area.</p><p>Two people were seated cross-legged in the valley; Qin Sang and Shen Chen.</p><p>Shen Chen couldn't help with forging the thunder altar, only watching, but he looked even more exhausted than Qin Sang.</p><p>Before Qin Sang, a magnificent altar had appeared out of thin air.</p><p>Daoist altars are generally three-tiered: a circular upper tier, an octagonal middle tier, and a square lower tier. Qin Sang was about to complete the lower two tiers.</p><p>Nearly half of the floating spiritual objects had disappeared.  Suddenly, Qin Sang drew a ball of spiritual light into his palm. Fire ignited in his palm, encasing the treasure within the spiritual light, beginning the refinement process. The refinement was incredibly fast; within moments, a golden radiance appeared in the flames, and a stream of liquid gold slowly flowed out.</p><p>Shen Chen watched Qin Sang's hand intently, afraid to miss a single detail.</p><p>Most of his master's actions were incomprehensible to him, yet he had to memorize them; they would be invaluable in the future.</p><p>The mental strain was terrifying; his master couldn't wait for him to slowly absorb it all. Shen Chen was desperately holding on; if this opportunity were missed, it wouldn't come again.</p><p>The liquid gold flowed into the altar, as if gilding its surface. Spiritual light frequently appeared within the liquid gold, and countless runes, unseen by Shen Chen before, flashed continuously, making his head spin.</p><p>Gradually, the liquid gold seeped into the altar's interior.  Finally, the altar suddenly shook, and the earth rumbled.</p><p>The tremors were felt both inside and outside Qingyang Temple.</p><p>Such tremors had occurred more than once over the years; the disciples of Qingyang Temple were used to them, believing them to be caused by the construction of the protective mountain array.</p><p>Simultaneously with the tremors, the altar emitted a dazzling golden light that shot towards the heavens.  Qin Sang pressed down with his palm, suppressing the light. Once the golden light gradually dissipated, the complete two-tiered altar stood before them.</p><p>Looking at the altar, Qin Sang nodded in satisfaction. This altar and the one at Yue Du Bay were both thunder altars, but not identical.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't fully understand the materials used by the previous owner of that thunder altar to build it, and some were beyond his reach. However, he wielded the seal of the Five Thunder Envoy's Office, which contained many Daoist Thunder Department inheritances, including methods of constructing various altars, as well as the characteristics and interchangeability of various spiritual objects.</p><p>Qin Sang modified it according to his own understanding, and its power was no less powerful. The foundation was laid; the next step would be the most crucial.</p><p>“Shen Chen.”</p><p>Qin Sang called out.</p><p>“Disciple is here!” Shen Chen quickly stood up, regaining his composure.</p><p>“Go out for now,” Qin Sang said.</p><p>Shen Chen could no longer learn anything, and he was at his limit. He might as well go help Li Yu Fu; there was a shortage of manpower outside.</p><p>“Disciple obeys!”</p><p>Shen Chen bowed and left the valley.</p><p>Qin Sang waved his sleeve, sealing the forbidden area, slowly rising and settling above the altar, sitting motionless.</p><p>His consciousness sank into the altar, and a thunder rune appeared in his mind.</p><p>The type of thunder rune inscribed in the thunder altar determined its power.</p><p>Fourth-order Daoist thunder runes corresponded to the Unity Stage, but the Five Thunder Envoy's Office seal only recorded third-order runes. The only fourth-order thunder rune that Qin Sang knew was the Sacrifice Thunder Oath obtained from the thunder altar itself.</p><p>Higher-order runes weren't always better; they couldn't exceed one's own capabilities. But after putting in so much effort, Qin Sang naturally didn't want to simply inscribe a third-order rune and make do.</p><p>A third-order rune would certainly be greatly enhanced by the altar, but it would still be insufficient to deter a powerful tribe like the Zhuyan.</p><p>Qin Sang's task of personally inscribing a fourth-order thunder talisman was undoubtedly extremely difficult.</p><p>At Yue Du Bay, Qin Sang, with the aid of the thunder altar, had thoroughly understood the "Sacrifice to Thunder Oath." Even so, if he were to inscribe the talisman alone, even at his current late Transcendence stage, the chances of success were very low.</p><p>However, if all the sub-altars were completed before inscribing the talisman, he could assign people to preside over them and borrow some of their power to aid him in the inscription, allowing the main altar and talisman to be completed simultaneously.</p><p>Furthermore, the success of the talisman inscription is closely related to the choice of spiritual materials, including the brush, paper, and ink.</p><p>This was Qin Sang's greatest confidence, because he possessed the Azure Luan True Thunder!</p><p>Qin Sang still couldn't fully control the Azure Luan True Thunder; it was at least of the Unity stage level, perhaps even higher.  Using the Azure Luan True Thunder as "ink," given its grade, it was more than enough to carry the power of the Sacrifice to Thunder Oath.</p><p>The previous owner of that thunder altar might not have had such favorable conditions.</p><p>At the same time, this was also the biggest challenge. Both the fourth-order thunder talisman and the Azure Luan True Thunder transcended his current realm, requiring the most precise control, with no room for error. Otherwise, Qin Sang would have to settle for a third-order talisman.</p><p>Before that, Qin Sang needed to activate the altar base, cooperate with the Azure Luan True Thunder, and further refine his understanding to assess his chances of success.</p><p>He sat cross-legged on the altar, a green light flashing behind him, phoenix wings spreading, a thin thread of lightning floating towards his palm.</p><p>Connecting his mind to the altar, Qin Sang used the "Palm Observation of Thunder" technique. The lightning twisted and writhed, causing waves of fluctuation, all blocked by the protective formations here.</p><p>...</p><p>Above the Green Goat Temple, since the opening of the new mountain gate, Lu Ye had been hovering there.</p><p>Si Lu pushed open the cave door and slowly walked out, now radiant, his injuries completely healed.</p><p>He flickered to the edge of Lu Ye, overlooking the land, his divine sense silently sweeping across the Green Goat Temple, pausing briefly before the restricted area.</p><p>Seeing the drastically changed Green Goat Temple, Si Lu murmured, "It seems I've been in seclusion for at least several decades..."</p><p>He had focused on solidifying his cultivation, oblivious to the passage of time.</p><p>The Green Goat Temple's rapid development didn't surprise Si Lu; his attention was on the entire Storm Realm, and most importantly, on Qin Sang.</p><p>Having sensed the sealed restricted area, Si Lu was considering whether to interrupt when he suddenly received a voice transmission from Qin Sang.</p><p>"Friend Daoist has emerged from seclusion."</p><p>Si Lu's expression shifted slightly, appearing outside the restricted area.</p><p>A path opened in the restricted area, and Si Lu entered, seeing Qin Sang and giving a respectful bow.  "Thank you, Daoist Qin, for your protection, allowing me to heal peacefully."</p><p>He couldn't help but look at the altar beneath Qin Sang, a look of surprise flashing in his eyes.</p><p>From previous conversations between Qin Sang and Su Nu, he knew Qin Sang was building a type of altar, but he didn't know the full picture.</p><p>Seeing it with his own eyes, Si Lu found that the altar was not yet complete, yet it seemed to contain endless mysteries that he couldn't comprehend.</p><p>"Friend Daoist's foundation is also stable, congratulations," Qin Sang nodded with a smile.</p><p>Si Lu showed no complacency.  "After the breakthrough, I've stagnated for too long. Compared to other Daoists of the same level, especially in divine abilities, spells, and combat techniques, I'm still lacking."</p><p>"These things need to be taken slowly, there's no need to rush. I have a matter I wish to ask for your assistance, Friend Daoist. Are you free?" Qin Sang asked.</p><p>Si Lu replied without hesitation, "Please, Daoist, give your instructions!"</p><p>Qin Sang nodded. "This main altar beneath me is still one step away from completion. I need to build sub-altars first. Three of the most crucial sub-altars are already under construction, but I have some new ideas, and those younger cultivators may be incapable.  You might need to take a trip personally, Daoist. When activating the altar in the future, you will also need to personally preside over one sub-altar!"</p><p>Si Lu had no objections.  He was curious about this kind of altar and immediately agreed.</p><p>"The details of the altar are recorded in this jade slip. Please take a look, Daoist."</p><p>Qin Sang sent out a jade slip. Si Lu reached out to take it, spoke with Qin Sang for a while longer, and then took his leave.</p><p>Several days later, Si Lu quietly left the Green Goat Temple, first visiting the Four Saints Palace to check on the first core sub-altar.</p>
