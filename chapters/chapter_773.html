<h1>Chapter 765: The Talisman</h1><p>The situation reversed in an instant.</p><p>Within the dense purple mist, the two figures chased each other at high speed.  Losing sight of the young man in the mist meant potentially losing him altogether.  Disregarding his dwindling spiritual essence, Qin Sang continued to urge the Nine Dragons Heavenly Chariot Talisman, relentlessly pursuing his foe.</p><p>His spiritual essence was depleting rapidly, but the young man's even faster.</p><p>Having been poisoned by the virulent toxin, the young man was now in dire straits. The poison not only brought excruciating pain, but also caused his spiritual essence to stagnate.  Like a malignant growth, it spread to his internal organs, proving extremely difficult to purge.</p><p>His failure to swiftly subdue Qin Sang had put him in a perilous position.</p><p>With Qin Sang pressing hard, he fought and retreated simultaneously.</p><p>They were still a considerable distance from the exit of the purple mist-filled dead zone.</p><p>Qin Sang and the Two-Headed Vulture launched a fierce attack, giving the young man no respite. The Nine Nether Demon Fire and the Ebony Sword appeared alternately, soon inflicting a sword wound upon him.</p><p>More wounds quickly followed.</p><p>Covered in blood, the young man's movements became erratic; the poison was taking its toll.</p><p>The moment his jade bracelet was destroyed, he knew that if he couldn't kill Qin Sang, being worn down like this would only lead to certain defeat.</p><p>And indeed, that's how it unfolded!</p><p>Qin Sang was an anomaly among Core Formation cultivators. His escape techniques were unparalleled among those below the Nascent Soul realm.  Escape from Qin Sang's pursuit was simply impossible.</p><p>His desperate gamble of self-detonating his magical treasure had also failed.</p><p>…</p><p>A brief, sharp cry abruptly ceased.</p><p>As the commotion subsided, Qin Sang slowly emerged from the purple mist, gazing coldly at the corpse on the ground.</p><p>Remembering the battle at Duyan Island, Qin Sang never showed mercy to his enemies.  Unable to capture the young man alive, he had no choice but to finish him off.</p><p>In a final act of desperation, the young man attempted to detonate his Golden Core, but the Nine Nether Demon Fire incinerated his nascent spirit before he could succeed.  Unfortunately, his Golden Core had already shattered, rendered useless.</p><p>Qin Sang flashed to the young man's side, retrieving his belongings, then conjured a flame, incinerating the body without a trace.</p><p>The most valuable prize was the golden ring-shaped magical treasure.</p><p>Qin Sang extended his divine sense into the treasure, erasing the young man’s mark.</p><p>As expected, the golden ring possessed a confinement ability. Called the Golden Yao Lock, it was forged from some unknown rare metal.  It could expand and contract, emitting a peculiar confining force.</p><p>Not only could it be used against other magical treasures, but it could also, if used unexpectedly, directly restrain an opponent.</p><p>Only treasures like the Ten Yama Banners, empowered by the Nine Nether Demon Fire, could not only withstand but also suppress the Golden Yao Lock.  Ordinary magical treasures would be hampered by it.</p><p>"Cough…"</p><p>Qin Sang staggered, hurriedly sitting down in meditation.</p><p>He had suppressed his injuries from the shockwave of the exploding grey sword, but they were now flaring up.</p><p>Qin Sang surveyed his surroundings, realizing he was nearing the canyon.</p><p>Fortunately, he hadn't encountered any beasts or other cultivators during the pursuit. Qin Sang instructed the Two-Headed Vulture to focus on healing.</p><p>Soon, Qin Sang's breathing steadied.  He rose, examining the Golden Yao Lock before storing it in his dantian to refine.</p><p>A mid-grade magical treasure could provide significant advantages.</p><p>Had his Golden Radiance Armor been intact, this fight wouldn't have been so arduous.</p><p>He then opened the young man’s storage pouch. The pills, talismans, and other items within had been depleted in the young man’s final moments.</p><p>Qin Sang was most curious about his identity, but after searching through everything, he found no items indicating the young man’s sect. There were a few jade slips, but they contained only unmarked cultivation techniques and spells.</p><p>“He didn’t deny it, so it was likely the Western Gloom Alliance, but I can't be sure which merchant guild. However, since he dared to oppose the Eastern Apex Alliance’s leader, he might have been a close confidant, like Xiang Yi. But what was his purpose here…?”</p><p>Qin Sang flipped his hand, revealing a talisman.</p><p>This talisman was unique, marked with intricate patterns Qin Sang couldn't decipher.  When he tried to infuse it with spiritual essence, it remained inert.</p><p>It wasn't a matter of insufficient spiritual essence, but rather a need for specific conditions to activate it.</p><p>"What is this? This is the only thing I can't understand. Does it have something to do with the ancient divine platform?”</p><p>Qin Sang examined the talisman, unable to discern its secrets, finally storing it away for later study.</p><p>“This trip has been full of unexpected events,” Qin Sang muttered wryly, then recalled a moment from the earlier fight. He hastily summoned the Ten Yama Banners.</p><p>The Nine Nether Demon Fire surged, but this time there was no response.</p><p>"It's probably because of the distance. So the purple mist is likely unrelated to the mysterious spiritual fire."</p><p>Qin Sang pondered, keeping the Ten Yama Banners deployed as he retraced his steps.</p><p>He wanted to test the talisman's effect on the ancient divine platform, but upon returning to its location, he froze.  The platform had vanished!</p><p>The ground was seamlessly closed, with only the traces of his battle with the young man remaining, no sign the platform had ever existed.</p><p>“The platform clearly rose from the ground. Xiang Yi must have manipulated something within the three stone halls to activate it.  I can’t even break the ancient restrictions outside the halls, let alone awaken the platform.”</p><p>Qin Sang stood where the platform had been, making one last attempt.</p><p>He took out the talisman, trying repeatedly, but it remained unresponsive. He knew he had missed his chance.</p><p>“So, the young man's desperation to self-detonate his treasure wasn't solely to kill me, but likely related to the ancient divine platform. With the platform gone, his mission failed.”</p><p>Qin Sang had too little information, leaving him only to speculate.</p><p>Finally, he gave up, tossing the talisman into his Qianjun Ring, deciding to forget the matter.</p><p>He had no desire to get caught between the two alliance leaders. Had there been immediate benefits, it might have been worth the risk, but now, with the platform inaccessible, it was best to let it go.</p><p>It was a shame. Qin Sang had placed great hope in the platform, which fueled his determination to eliminate the young man.</p><p>Such an ancient and mysterious platform, should it produce treasures, would surely yield something extraordinary.</p><p>Having used the Blood Defilement Divine Light, the only worthwhile spoils seemed to be the Golden Yao Lock. Whether he had gained or lost was hard to say.</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head, dispelling his thoughts, and summoned the Nine Nether Demon Fire once more.</p><p>The familiar sensation returned, pointing clearly towards the depths of the purple mist.</p><p>Qin Sang hesitated, calculating the remaining time.  Still ample, he decided to go.</p><p>Mounting the Two-Headed Vulture, he instructed it to fly, while he focused on refining the Golden Yao Lock, eager to master this new treasure.</p><p>Soon, they arrived before the third stone hall. Qin Sang tried, but alone, he couldn't break the ancient restrictions. He continued onward.</p><p>The terrain remained relatively flat for some distance.</p><p>Suddenly, the Two-Headed Vulture growled, alerting Qin Sang.</p><p>He jumped down, walking forward a few steps, stopping at the edge of a canyon.</p>
