<h1>Chapter 1137:  A Plot</h1><p>Afterward, Qin Sang remained in Qianshan Bamboo Sea, cultivating in the former cave abode of Yunyouzi.  Qianshan Bamboo Sea affairs were managed by the willow tree spirit; Qin Sang didn't interfere, rarely appearing.</p><p>Later, the willow tree spirit brought Old Monkey to meet Qin Sang, informing him of the situation.</p><p>Seeing the old monkey weeping, Qin Sang felt a pang of sorrow.</p><p>Only the willow tree spirit, Old Monkey, and the white cat in the entire Qianshan Bamboo Sea knew of his presence.</p><p>Unknowingly, he had been in Qianshan Bamboo Sea for over a year.</p><p>The investigation into the news about the Qianji Demon King and the stone tablet was personally arranged by the willow tree spirit. However, this was clearly not something that could be accomplished overnight. Qin Sang was patient, awaiting good news.</p><p>…</p><p>Jiuku Mountain.</p><p>The Jiuku Demon King's cave was located within this mountain.</p><p>The Jiuku Demon King was a transformed dark bat, with many bat demons under his command.  Of all the demon kings, his cave was the closest to Qianshan Bamboo Sea.</p><p>The surrounding mountain was filled with dark energy, barren and lifeless, a stark contrast to Qianshan Bamboo Sea.</p><p>At this time, in the Jiuku Demon King's cave.</p><p>The Jiuku Demon King was personally receiving a feathered man.</p><p>This feathered man was of great significance, another demon king, Lihong Demon King.</p><p>He was under the command of the Feather Demon King and enjoyed considerable trust.</p><p>"Jiuku, my purpose is clear to you.  The Feather Demon King has ordered that, once the front line sends a message, you must dispatch your subordinates according to these numbers to join the battle."</p><p>Lihong Demon King produced a jade slip and handed it to Jiuku Demon King.</p><p>The Jiuku Demon King was unremarkable in appearance, with a pointed nose and a receding hairline, and a pair of strange fleshy wings on his back.</p><p>He extended his thin fingers, grasped the jade slip, and after reading it, cried out in distress, "So many? Last time, I sent out my most trusted men, and only a few returned alive. Sending out so many more will empty Jiuku Mountain!"</p><p>Lihong Demon King remained impassive, saying, "You must have received news – the situation this time is different. The Zuyuan's actions are frequent, and there's a large-scale offensive, a decisive battle.  I've been visiting fellow demon kings along the way, all must dispatch this many troops to support the front, not just you, Jiuku. Furthermore, if the situation becomes urgent, the Feather Demon King will personally go to the front and select some to go with him…"</p><p>"The Demon King will personally participate in battle?"</p><p>Jiuku Demon King interrupted Lihong Demon King, even more dissatisfied. "It's those two-legged sheep fighting amongst themselves.  Sending some men last time was already more than enough. Why should we risk our lives for them? Let them fight to the death, then we can benefit…We could just abandon Tianyao Hill and go to the Ice Sea to live freely!"</p><p>"The Ice Sea is barren and desolate, with only seawater and ice mountains, not even an easy place to find a foothold. If the Ice Sea was suitable for cultivation, why would our ancestors fight to the death with humans and occupy Tianyao Hill?"</p><p>Lihong Demon King dismissed Jiuku Demon King's words.  "Our ancestors made a pact with Xiaohan Domain, a defensive alliance to a certain extent, to stop the fighting.  Humans have deep reserves, not so easily depleted.  Violently breaking the pact would not be good for us, and leaving Tianyao Hill, it would be difficult to return."</p><p>Jiuku Demon King couldn't argue, sighing and putting away the jade slip.</p><p>"I hope you'll be prepared as soon as possible and don't delay the overall situation. I'll take my leave."</p><p>Lihong Demon King rose to leave.</p><p>"Wait!"</p><p>Jiuku Demon King suddenly stopped him. "Are you going to Qianshan Bamboo Sea next?"</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>Lihong Demon King nodded.</p><p>"Don't rush. This is my treasured spirit wine. Let's have another cup." Jiuku Demon King pulled Lihong Demon King back down, smiling.</p><p>His sudden warmth left Lihong Demon King puzzled. "Speak freely if you have something to say."</p><p>Jiuku Demon King filled the wine cups, chuckling. "I wonder what the Feather Demon King and you think of the master of Qianshan Bamboo Sea?"</p><p>"What do you mean?"</p><p>Lihong Demon King's eyes flashed, calmly asking.</p><p>Jiuku Demon King pointed towards Qianshan Bamboo Sea, his voice mysterious. "Have you calculated how many years it's been since the Bamboo Demon has appeared?"</p><p>Lihong Demon King drank the wine, leaning back on the stone chair, teasing. "I remember, Jiuku, you used to obey the Bamboo Senior implicitly. Now you call him 'the Bamboo Demon'?"</p><p>After a pause, Lihong Demon King mused, "Thinking about it, it's been nearly three hundred years since we've seen Bamboo Senior. However, wood spirits have long lifespans and their heavenly tribulations come far slower than ours.</p><p>Furthermore,  "Elder Bamboo" is just a title; no one knows his true identity. He may not even be a cultivated bamboo demon from Thousand Mountain Bamboo Sea, and it's perfectly normal for him to be in seclusion for hundreds of years.  The last time I went to Thousand Mountain Bamboo Sea, I spoke with Elder Bamboo.”</p><p>“Three hundred years without appearing is normal? Think carefully, did you see his true form last time in Thousand Mountain Bamboo Sea?”</p><p>King Nine Caves let out a strange laugh, disdainfully saying, “Even the longest-lived plant spirits are not immune to the Heavenly Tribulation; its power only increases with each passing occurrence! How old is that guy anyway?”</p><p>King Li Hong shook his head, “All I know is that during the previous Feather King's reign, Elder Bamboo was the master of Thousand Mountain Bamboo Sea. Could it be that you…”</p><p>“I do suspect it!”</p><p>King Nine Caves no longer concealed his intentions, “Thousand Mountain Bamboo Sea is a bit remote, but it's a rare, fertile land in the Heavenly Demon Hill, occupied by that bamboo demon for so many years. Most of the plant spirits in the Demon Realm are in Thousand Mountain Bamboo Sea, under his protection. Sending these plant spirits out, regardless of their strength, as long as the number meets the treaty, the human race can’t criticize Heavenly Demon Hill, and it will also preserve some of our assets.”</p><p>Upon hearing this, King Li Hong was shocked by King Nine Caves' ambition, “You are incredibly audacious, daring to plot against Thousand Mountain Bamboo Sea! Do you know how many souls have perished at Elder Bamboo's hands? Elder Bamboo's strength is unfathomable. The previous Feather King treated him with great respect. If he hadn't lacked the ambition to contend for supremacy…”</p><p>“Of course I know how powerful he is, otherwise, why would I endure humiliation for so many years?”</p><p>King Nine Caves chuckled dryly, “I haven’t lived long enough to actively oppose him; I merely want to probe his situation. If he is still alive, then we can drop it, but if he was truly struck dead by the Heavenly Tribulation, then what do we have to fear?”</p><p>The more King Nine Caves spoke, the more feasible it seemed, his tone becoming increasingly agitated and persuasive.</p><p>“Think about it, that bamboo demon's lifespan is comparable to a Xuanwu; he must have collected countless treasures over the years. Plant spirits cultivate much slower than us; there aren’t many formidable ones in Thousand Mountain Bamboo Sea.  Are we just going to let them have all those treasures?”</p><p>King Li Hong was startled and remained silent.</p><p>Seeing this, King Nine Caves knew he was on the right track, pressing on, “It’s not just me who thinks this way.  Out of fear of the old guy’s power, everyone is watching and waiting, not daring to act rashly. You have the Feather King’s backing; you don't necessarily need to be afraid of him. A little probing will reveal the truth; then, we two can seize the opportunity. I am willing to give the lion's share to you…”</p>
