<h1>Chapter 1526: The Beast (4k)</h1><p>Black mist, like a living thing, surged forward through the storm.</p><p>Unlike the calm shadows around the Moon Boat, the black mist, though seemingly erratic, emanated a ferocious aura, incredibly brutal, crashing and charging, battling the tempest.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>Two gigantic waves rose from the seabed, forming a deep chasm.</p><p>Only after the black mist passed did the chasm fill again with seawater whipped up by the hurricane, a breathtaking sight.</p><p>Inside the black mist was clearly a massive creature.  Occasionally, a scale or claw would peek out, enough to conjure a terrifying image in the mind.</p><p>‘Roar!’</p><p>The monster roared again.</p><p>The black mist surged wildly.</p><p>The roar drowned out the storm.  In the vast emptiness of the sea, unimpeded, it resembled a whale song, but lacked its ethereal quality. Instead, it brought an astonishing pressure, chilling anyone who heard it.</p><p>Qin Sang and Liuli, inside the wind wall, heard the sound again, their hearts trembling.</p><p>They were struggling to navigate the wind wall.</p><p>This was a first for Qin Sang and Liuli. The moment they heard the sound, they realized the monster in the storm was approaching, fully aware of the extreme danger they were in.</p><p>There was no refuge in the storm zone.</p><p>The Ten Directions Earth-Opening Shuttle was as conspicuous as a lamp in the night. Turning back would only attract the monster’s attention, inviting disaster.</p><p>Any creature surviving in the storm zone was undoubtedly incredibly powerful.</p><p>Their only option was to seek shelter, using the wind wall and the refuge to hide, hoping the monster was just passing through.</p><p>Previously, Qin Sang had explored many times without finding any unusual traces. This shouldn't be the monster's lair.</p><p>If the monster sensed its lair had been invaded, its roar would be filled with anger. But Qin Sang felt madness instead!</p><p>The second roar confirmed their judgment.</p><p>The monster was approaching this direction, but not directly towards them or the shelter. It seemed to be passing through, and they had been unfortunately caught in its path.</p><p>Qin Sang and Liuli secretly rejoiced; their choice had been right.</p><p>This roar was far clearer than the first. The monster was incredibly fast and seemed unafraid of the storm's onslaught, moving in a straight line.</p><p>At such speed…</p><p>Had they not decisively entered the wind wall, and instead fled haphazardly, they would likely have been targeted by the monster, with dire consequences.</p><p>They heard the roar again.</p><p>Qin Sang’s mind stirred; this madness was familiar.</p><p>He couldn't help but think of the beast he encountered in the inner hall of the Seven Kills Temple.</p><p>The current situation didn't allow Qin Sang to think carefully.</p><p>He and Liuli had hastily entered the wind wall, with no time to spare.  Surroundings were chaotic to the extreme; Qin Sang had to do everything to find a way to survive.</p><p>Liuli handed control of the Shuttle to Qin Sang.</p><p>The Shuttle was pushed to its limits. Qin Sang didn’t dare pause, flashing at top speed through the rapidly changing hurricane, desperately charging towards the shelter in the center.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>Everything around was hazy gray.</p><p>The Shuttle was enveloped by the hurricane.</p><p>It had just slipped through a gap when the hurricane immediately closed, the shockwave of the collision almost chasing the green light’s tail.  The slightest misstep would have resulted in being swallowed by the wind wall.</p><p>Perilous was an understatement.</p><p>Fortunately, Qin Sang had scouted the route beforehand and was familiar with the wind wall's internal patterns. Though seemingly haphazard, he consistently made the right choices, advancing toward the central shelter without serious incident.</p><p>A third roar came.</p><p>Closer!</p><p>The monster was faster than they had anticipated!</p><p>If they couldn’t reach the shelter before the monster got closer, the Shuttle’s fluctuations might be detected.</p><p>Liuli summoned the Four-Ride Serpent Seal, a light blue appearing in her eyes, prepared for battle.</p><p>Her external incarnation was also ready to act.</p><p>If it came down to it, they would have to test the monster's strength.  The only fortunate thing was that they encountered the monster near the shelter; a mid-route encounter would have been far more troublesome.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>Qin Sang's face was grim, his mind focused. He piloted the Shuttle through layer after layer of the wind wall, and finally, Tianmu Butterfly saw the scene at the core of the wind wall.</p><p>It was a small island.</p><p>The island was only a hundred or so meters in diameter, its features visible at a glance; it could almost be called a reef.</p><p>As expected, it was deathly silent, devoid of life.</p><p>At least it proved this wasn't the monster's lair.</p><p>However, the island wasn't completely barren. A patch of forest remained, though the plants were dead, petrified.</p><p>This jungle fossil, formed countless years ago, sits within a storm zone yet remains unscathed, its foliage perfectly preserved.  Qin Sang harbored a question.</p><p>Were these strange shelters discovered by Transcendence Stage predecessors like Xiao Xiangzi during their travels through the storm zone, or were they their creations?  Now it seems, at least this islet is an ancient relic.</p><p>‘Roar!’</p><p>At that moment, a fourth roar echoed.  Deafening, as if right beside him.</p><p>Qin Sang’s expression changed slightly.  He spotted a gap in the final wind wall and darted through.</p><p>But as he passed through, a sudden premonition seized Qin Sang; his back tensed, sensing an imminent, inexplicable danger!</p><p>Beyond the wind wall.</p><p>Black fog churned, its target clearly not the shelter.  But as it neared, a sudden change occurred!</p><p>Whether angered by the unusually dense hurricane nearby, or alerted by the strange phenomenon of the shelter's wind wall, a furious roar erupted.</p><p>The black fog swelled abruptly.</p><p>Then, a long tail tore through the fog, bursting from the seabed.</p><p>The tail, fast as black lightning, vanished in an instant, leaving a long phantom trace in the void.  With a 'whoosh', it swept away the nearby hurricane, its lingering afterimage slamming into the wind wall.</p><p>‘Tear!’</p><p>The phantom pierced the wind wall with frightening force, as if to rip it apart.</p><p>However, this was a convergence point of hurricanes, saturated with immense energy; it wasn't that fragile.</p><p>The two forces collided. The fragile balance within the wind wall, barely maintained, was disrupted by the phantom, but not shattered.</p><p>It was the people inside who suffered.</p><p>Within the wind wall.</p><p>Qin Sang reacted swiftly, noticing the wind wall’s anomaly; he threw himself towards the islet with all his might.</p><p>Alas, he was a fraction of a second too slow.</p><p>Behind them, the energy fluctuations from the collision formed grey waves. These appeared less violent than before, yet sent a chill down Qin Sang's spine.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang made a daring move, abruptly withdrawing his true energy, relinquishing control of the Ten Directions Earth-Splitting Shuttle and handing it over to Liuli.</p><p>The next moment, two figures were exposed: Qin Sang and his avatar.</p><p>The waves were close, mere moments from engulfing them.</p><p>The Ten Directions Earth-Splitting Shuttle was their lifeline for traversing the storm zone; it couldn’t be destroyed here.</p><p>Moreover, unlike the previous moon boat, the islet was surrounded by a restrictive barrier; they needed to find the entrance first.</p><p>To that end, Qin Sang risked exposure, personally confronting the waves.</p><p>Simultaneously, his external avatar thrust out a hand, releasing the python banner.</p><p>On the banner, the snow python's expression was ferocious, its roar wild.</p><p>After subduing the snow python, Qin Sang hadn't had time to cultivate a bond; he'd relied solely on his strength to force its submission.</p><p>In this life-or-death situation, the snow python naturally wouldn't willingly serve him. But the disparity in cultivation was too vast; the snow python's struggles were futile, unable to break free, its cries unheard.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The python banner silently expanded, like a wall, blocking the huge wave.</p><p>But this wall was too fragile. The icy mist was quickly swept away by the wave, the snow python and banner disappearing without a sound; Qin Sang couldn't even retrieve it.</p><p>Gauging the wave's power, Qin Sang's heart sank, but he didn't retreat.</p><p>Following the python banner appeared an ice mirror.</p><p>The external avatar deployed a defensive divine ability, constructing a second barrier.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>‘Crack crack crack…’</p><p>The ice mirror instantly fractured, then shattered.</p><p>Before the wave struck.</p><p>The external avatar frantically deployed another divine ability, chilling air condensing into full-body ice armor.  Then, it felt a heavy blow.</p><p>‘Bang!’</p><p>A series of explosive sounds emanated from the external avatar as the ice armor shattered, sending it flying.</p><p>However, this was all part of Qin Sang's plan.</p><p>He caught the external avatar.</p><p>The second Nascent Soul retreated into the main body, appearing somewhat dissipated.</p><p>Qin Sang retrieved the avatar's physical body.  A glow flashed from him, revealing the Ruyi Treasure Pearl's protective dome, yet he never used the Sun God Tree, demonic fire, or sword array.</p><p>He hadn't seen what happened outside, but he knew it was the monster's doing.</p><p>His actions were purely defensive.</p><p>The monster was nearby. If he attacked with full force, the resulting commotion would attract it, making things far more perilous.</p><p>To that end, Qin Sang willingly sacrificed the python banner and his gravely injured avatar to buy time.</p><p>He could always recuperate in the shelter for a few years; arriving later in the Central Plains wouldn't make much difference.</p><p>‘Snap!’</p><p>That was the next sound Qin Sang heard.</p><p>While summoning their external avatars, a huge wave crashed against the protective barrier.</p><p>The Ruyi Treasure Pearl, a Buddhist artifact, strengthened the barrier, allowing it to withstand the impact a little longer than the ice mirror had, but ultimately it shattered.</p><p>Qin Sang, though shielded, was still jolted.  Thanks to his cultivated physique, he quickly recovered, flapping his thunder wings and heading straight for the islet without looking back.</p><p>Using the time Qin Sang bought,  Liuli, following the sea chart, located the islet's barrier entrance. Without hesitation, she unleashed the Ice Soul Divine Light to meet Qin Sang.</p><p>‘Click… click… click…’</p><p>The wave's leading edge froze silently.</p><p>Though brief, the freeze was enough for Qin Sang to escape.</p><p>‘Whoosh! Whoosh!’</p><p>Qin Sang and Liuli entered the islet almost simultaneously.</p><p>The instant they were inside, the wave slammed into the barrier, the terrifying energy creating a breathtaking, almost suffocating scene.</p><p>The islet, however, remained unmoved.</p><p>Qin Sang and Liuli, standing on the ground, exchanged a look, their faces tense, both feeling a sense of relief after narrowly escaping death.</p><p>‘Rumble… rumble…’</p><p>A hurricane howled.</p><p>The monster's afterimage was eventually swallowed by the wind wall.</p><p>As the aftershocks subsided, a temporary gap appeared in the wind wall. Through it, they glimpsed a dark mist sweeping across the storm.</p><p>Within the mist…</p><p>A long, massive tail sank into the ocean trench, resembling both a dragon and a crocodile's tail, covered in dark scales and a row of triangular bone plates along its spine, like sharp swords.</p><p>The largest bone plate was as big as a wall.</p><p>It was hard to imagine the size of the monster itself!</p><p>The tail and the mist quickly passed, the wind wall closing.</p><p>That fleeting glimpse left a deep impression on Qin Sang and Liuli, who remained silent for a long time.</p><p>They had anticipated the possibility of unknown creatures in the storm zone.</p><p>The world is vast and full of wonders.</p><p>Cultivators can cultivate in places with stable spiritual energy, so creatures adapted to the storm zone could exist and roam freely in this vast world.</p><p>They were right.</p><p>But they hadn't expected such a shocking, unforgettable first encounter.</p><p>The wind wall closed.</p><p>Even the Sky-Eye Butterfly could no longer see the mist and the monster.</p><p>Qin Sang, however, remained fixed on that direction, motionless.</p><p>“A ferocious beast?”</p><p>Qin Sang muttered to himself, recalling his experience in the Seven Killing Hall.</p><p>Back then, he had mostly relied on Elder Qingzhu's avatar, Ning Wuhu, to navigate the inner hall.</p><p>He never reached the deepest part of the Seven Killing Hall.  The pressure from the ferocious beasts he encountered there was far less than that of this unseen monster, but the beast's ferocity remained vividly in his memory.</p><p>This monster was somewhat similar.</p><p>Unfortunately, they dared not approach the monster, unable to observe it closely.</p><p>What was this monster's origin?</p><p>What did it look like?</p><p>After ten years in the storm zone, this was their first encounter. How many similar monsters were there?</p><p>Shelters are more conspicuous than cultivation sects within the storm zone; why didn't these monsters attack the cultivation sects? Why were there no related records?</p><p>Questions flooded Qin Sang's mind.</p><p>These unsolved mysteries were intriguing.</p><p>The wind wall gradually calmed down, and a new balance would soon be established. The monster hadn't attacked again, likely having moved away.</p><p>That attack seemed to have been a casual strike, a whim.</p><p>Seeing they were safe, Qin Sang slowly exhaled, sat cross-legged, summoned his second Nascent Soul, observed it for a while, and wryly smiled, “We may have to stay here for several years.”</p><p>Liuli glanced at Qin Sang’s badly injured second Nascent Soul, remained silent for a moment, and then asked doubtfully, “Could its lair be nearby?”</p><p>“That's my biggest concern. If this monster is constantly roaming nearby, neither path is safe. We should investigate while we heal,”</p><p>Qin Sang mused.</p><p>He took out the sea chart. If there was such a powerful monster nearby, Xiao Xiangzi wouldn't have failed to mark it.</p><p>Either the monster had migrated there later or it was just passing through.</p><p>Qin Sang scanned the shelters on the sea chart one by one. Their previous ten years had been slow but surprisingly smooth, making them overly optimistic.</p><p>The road ahead was unknown, filled with uncertainties.</p><p>Qin Sang and Liuli spent the next year on the island healing and cultivating, without venturing out.</p><p>The monster never returned.</p><p>After a year, Qin Sang cautiously left the islet, scouting the surrounding area, but found no sign of a lair. He didn't rush off, returning to the island to wait.</p><p>They remained on the island for five years.</p><p>Their external avatars fully healed, and they thoroughly explored the area around the shelter.</p><p>The monster was truly gone.</p><p>That day, the divine shuttle left the islet, embarking on the next leg of their journey.</p>
