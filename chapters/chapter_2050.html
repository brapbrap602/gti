<h1>Chapter 2041: Clearing Out a Sect</h1><p>Qin Sang appeared outside the formation and looked at the approaching person.  He saw a Daoist, his hair and beard frosted but his spirit vigorous. The Daoist wore cloud boots, and a rainbow-like light accompanied his every step, a strange sight.</p><p>Judging by his aura, he was undoubtedly a mid-stage Refinement Void cultivator.</p><p>Considering his direction of arrival, Qin Sang quickly figured out who he was and bowed slightly: "Master Yan, greetings."</p><p>Qin Sang remained vigilant.</p><p>This person must be the enigmatic Grand Master of Liyu Palace, known to the world as Master Yan, but whose real name remains unknown.</p><p>Since this was only a shadow avatar, his true strength was hard to judge precisely. However, rumors were likely not exaggerated. Since he wasn't a late-stage Refinement Void cultivator, Qin Sang wouldn't be overly wary.</p><p>Master Yan had only sent an avatar to stop the fight, seemingly intending to mediate, but it could also be a delaying tactic. This person was always reclusive. Only the previous head of the Xin family had interacted with him a few times; Xin Sheng and the others had no idea of his personality.</p><p>"Daoist Qin, greetings."</p><p>Master Yan bowed politely, his expression amiable. He glanced at the sword formation beneath Qin Sang, but didn't demand that Qin Sang release Master Ling, and asked, "Daoist Qin, you're not from Qiong Lake, are you? With your abilities, you should have already become renowned.  May I ask where you're from?"</p><p>From his tone, Qin Sang understood that Master Yan seemed to want to reconcile, suggesting the fighting was over.</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't sure whether to be happy or not. He took out a token and tossed it to Master Yan.</p><p>Master Yan recognized the token’s origin and his expression immediately turned serious. He bowed again, "So you are Elder Qin of the Five Elements League! My apologies! My apologies!"</p><p>"Master Yan, you overstate it!"</p><p>Qin Sang returned the bow, thinking that the Five Elements League’s reputation was indeed powerful, reaching even beyond the Eight Great Heavenly States.</p><p>Master Yan returned the token to Qin Sang, and smiled, "Your League's Elder Qi has been stationed at the Wuyu Mountain branch for thousands of years. I was fortunate enough to have him refine a spiritual treasure for me. Two thousand years ago, when Tianjing Village attacked Qiong Lake, it was thanks to Elder Qi and your League's support that we repelled those destructive cultivators. Unfortunately, I've been focused on cultivation and haven't visited Elder Qi in hundreds of years."</p><p>Qin Sang was slightly taken aback. He only knew the situation around Qiong Lake, and was unfamiliar with Wuyu Mountain or Tianjing Village, let alone events two thousand years ago.</p><p>It sounded like Tianjing Village was a group of destructive cultivators who lived by plunder.</p><p>Cultivators in the vast world don't always achieve enlightenment through solitary cultivation. Cultivation also requires resources and external aids.</p><p>Some rely on their sects, some are principled but seek wealth through legitimate means, and others become bandits, gathering in groups, coming and going like the wind, killing, burning, looting, and committing all sorts of evil, like locusts.</p><p>The vast world is boundless, making it difficult to capture them.</p><p>This highlights the benefits of the Eight Great Heavenly States.  The Great Zhou Dynasty, while only nominally the supreme ruler, has deeply ingrained laws, which still have some effect, making these destructive cultivators hesitate and preventing them from being too reckless.</p><p>"Unfortunately, I've only recently joined the Five Elements League and haven't been to Wuyu Mountain, so I haven't had the chance to meet Elder Qi," Qin Sang said honestly.</p><p>"No worries, if Elder Qin has time in the near future, we can visit together," Master Yan smiled.</p><p>Qin Sang looked back towards Bi Shui Village and shook his head. "I'm afraid that won't be possible! I have other urgent matters and must return to my sect quickly, so I can't stay in Qiong Lake for too long."</p><p>Master Yan made a questioning sound. "Elder Qin doesn't plan to establish a base here?  Does the scenery of Qiong Lake not appeal to you?"</p><p>Master Ling had just been yelling for his death, but Master Yan seemed to want him to stay.  Qin Sang didn't know if he was being sincere or deceitful, and replied, "Qiong Lake is vast, with abundant resources, but I'm just a visitor. My sect is my base. We cultivators can traverse tens of thousands of miles easily, but moving our disciples and followers is extremely difficult, and cannot be done lightly.”</p><p>Hearing this, Master Yan could be certain that Qin Sang was being genuine. As the master of a palace, he deeply understood the responsibilities of his position.</p><p>If that's the case, Liyu Palace could tolerate this. Today's grievance could be resolved.</p><p>"I wonder how Elder Qin plans to deal with Bi Shui Village?"</p><p>"In my opinion, Scattered Cultivator Zhong Liang has established such a large base, it would be a waste to abandon it. If there are any fellow cultivators willing to take over Bi Shui Village, I would welcome it."</p><p>Qin Sang said calmly, his voice not concealing anything.</p><p>Because of his fight with Master Ling, the attention of the surrounding forces had been drawn to him, focusing on his conversation with Master Yan.</p><p>These words were also said for them to hear. Qin Sang had already decided to sell Bi Shui Village. The question was, to whom, and how, to get the best price.</p><p>Bi Shui Zhai was more than just Zhong Liang Sanren's cave dwelling; it held the heritage of a sect.  The surrounding powers in Qiong Lake were certainly interested, but they would have to consider Li Yu Palace's position first. Since Li Yu Palace failed to subdue Qin Sang, it would be a matter of the highest bidder.</p><p>At that moment, within the sword formation, the black circle gradually shrank, the clouds and smoke dissipated, and Ling Du stepped out.</p><p>He sensed the Grand Palace Master's arrival and abandoned the idea of a breakthrough in the midst of battle. His cultivation remained at the early stage of Refining Void, and he put away his treasure, looking up at the sky, seemingly giving up resistance.</p><p>Qin Sang made a sword gesture, and immediately a beam of sword light entered his sleeve. The starlight dissipated, revealing Ling Du's figure.</p><p>"My apologies! Palace Master Ling's abilities are superb; Qin dares not hold back. I hope Palace Master Ling will not take offense."</p><p>Ling Du said coldly, "Ling is simply outmatched; there's nothing to say! We shall fight again another day!"</p><p>Qin Sang thought to himself that this man was fairly honorable.  "If there's an opportunity, Qin will gladly accept the challenge."</p><p>Ling Du said no more. He paid his respects to Palace Master Yan, his Dharma body immediately returned to its original form, and he fled towards the mountain gate as a rainbow of light.</p><p>Palace Master Yan watched this with a smile, finally looking towards Bi Shui Zhai, "Is that daoist friend also an elder of your alliance?"</p><p>After Palace Master Yan appeared, Su Nu also released her aura in Bi Shui Zhai, providing support from afar.</p><p>"No, she is a friend of mine, here at my invitation," Qin Sang said.</p><p>Palace Master Yan nodded. "You two have only recently taken control of Bi Shui Zhai. I'm sure you have much to arrange.  Three days from now, I will send a messenger to visit."</p><p>"We would be honored to receive you."</p><p>Qin Sang bowed, and saw Palace Master Yan's figure vanish.</p><p>After Palace Master Yan's departure, the divine senses that had been watching did not disperse. They each revealed their identities, greeting Qin Sang from afar, without discussing business.</p><p>Next, various factions would send envoys to discuss Bi Shui Zhai.</p><p>The storm subsided.  Qin Sang transformed into a sword light and flew above Bi Shui Zhai. Su Nu immediately ordered the opening of the mountain gate, personally coming out to greet him, smiling brightly, "Congratulations, Qin, on your victory."</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head. "This was not a death match, and Palace Master Yan was unwilling to intervene; otherwise, the outcome would have been uncertain."</p><p>He entered Bi Shui Zhai, asked a few questions, and saw that Su Nu had been extremely thoughtful. In a short time, she had arranged all the matters properly. He couldn't help but think to himself that she was a truly capable aide.</p><p>They had completely taken control of Bi Shui Zhai; what followed was a grand feast of division.</p><p>Qin Sang ordered that the Bi Shui Zhai disciples be entrusted to Xin Sheng, and then he went to the sect's treasure vault with Su Nu.</p><p>Cultivation techniques, secret arts, countless precious materials, elixirs and medicines…</p><p>The most valuable items had been carried by Zhong Liang Sanren and destroyed in his tomb. These treasures were not as useful to Qin Sang and Su Nu, but they were precious resources for the development of the sect. Qin Sang intended to transform Feng Bao Jie into his own daoist domain, and these were indispensable.</p><p>Anything that could be moved from the sect's collection was taken. Fortunately, Qin Sang had acquired a pocket dimension, so moving the entire vault didn't take up much space; he was even more thorough than a woodworm in his scavenging.</p><p>Even the immature spirit herbs in the medicinal fields were transplanted into the pocket dimension. If the Bi Shui Zhai protective mountain formation hadn't been rooted in the earth's veins and thus immovable, he would have even moved that.</p><p>Later, the new owner of Bi Shui Zhai, looking at the empty mountain gate, would wonder what to think.</p><p>Of course, what he could take away was only a portion of the sect's assets.  The mountain gate, spiritual veins, spirit mines, protective formation, medicinal fields, personnel, etc., could still fetch a good price.</p><p>Qin Sang treated Pei Gongfeng's cave dwelling in the same manner, and then waited for buyers to arrive.</p><p>On the third day after the Qiong Lake battle, a Li Yu Palace attendant visited, and soon afterwards, envoys from other factions also arrived, all received with warm hospitality.</p><p>Qin Sang and Su Nu had already drawn up a list, categorizing the items for sale, while what he sought were mostly spirit materials for building a Thunder Altar.</p><p>Two Refining Void-level Daoist grounds, with carefully laid protective mountain formations by Refining Void cultivators—these alone were worth a significant amount.</p><p>Except for the most crucial items, negotiations were handled by Su Nu and Xin Sheng.  Qin Sang spent most of his time in seclusion in Zhong Liang Sanren's cave.</p><p>His exchange with Palace Master Ling had greatly benefited Qin Sang, giving him a deeper understanding of the Four Images Sword Formation and the art of layered formations.</p><p>Sword light illuminated the cave, then dimmed again.</p><p>Qin Sang deployed the Four Images Sword Formation, communicating his intent with the Vermillion Bird, his divine sense sweeping across the Western and Southern star regions, finally settling on the cave. There, where originally only a chaotic nebula had existed, a few stars now faintly twinkled.</p><p>This was a good sign. Once Qin Sang refined the art of layered formations, he would attempt to create two more sword formations.</p><p>Of course, cultivation is paramount. Qin Sang meditated on the sword array for a while before entering a state of deep cultivation to solidify his foundation.</p><p>Day and night alternated.</p><p>The barrier outside the cave was suddenly triggered.</p><p>Qin Sang awoke calmly, examined his inner self, and found the effects of his cultivation to be remarkably significant, his foundation considerably more stable.</p><p>Sensing his own cultivation, Qin Sang deduced that after fully absorbing the benefits from the incantation, he could vaguely sense the threshold of the mid-Nascent Soul stage!</p><p>The Earth-Slaying Sword held the promise of the future; for the present, Qin Sang’s gains from the tomb were an immediate improvement.</p><p>Considering Xin Sheng’s contributions, Qin Sang didn't intend to keep the benefits to himself and planned to share a portion of the spoils with the Xin family.</p><p>Outside were Su Nu, Xin Sheng, and others.  After being granted entry to the cave, Su Nu handed Qin Sang a pouch, clapped her hands, and said with a relaxed expression, "Mission accomplished! Everything outside is settled!"</p><p>"Thank you for your hard work!"</p><p>Qin Sang stood up, gazing at the mountains outside. "We should leave as well.  The Li Yu Palace will be arriving to take over."</p><p>He then turned to Xin Sheng, saying, "With this matter resolved, the Xin family's situation should be much better than anticipated. In a few days, Su Nu and I will visit the two Palace Masters and ask the Li Yu Palace to provide some protection. Are you still planning to relocate to Duizhou?"</p><p>The Xin family had obviously discussed this matter beforehand. Xin Sheng replied, "A cunning rabbit has more than one burrow. We plan to secretly send a group of promising clan members away. If something unexpected happens, we can preserve the family line. Please arrange for their safe passage and settlement in Duizhou, Elder Qin."</p><p>"Very well."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded. "You should also go to Duizhou. I will ask the Five Elements Alliance to arrange a secure cave dwelling for you.  After you break through to the Nascent Soul stage, you can return to Qiongze Mountain and revive the Xin family."</p><p>It was clear that Xin Sheng had benefited greatly from the incantation, only a step away from the Nascent Soul stage; a breakthrough was quite possible.</p><p>However, breakthroughs are never certain; it still depends on Xin Sheng's own efforts.  During the crucial breakthrough phase, seclusion and focused cultivation are necessary, free from external disturbances.</p><p>Hearing this, Steward Luo and the Xin family's Grand Elder both strongly agreed, urging Xin Sheng to heed Qin Sang's advice. Xin Sheng was the Xin family's hope; with a Nascent Soul cultivator in the family, they would no longer have to rely on others.</p><p>"Rest assured, Young Master, we will surely look after Qiongze Mountain. With Elder Qin's lingering influence, as long as the Li Yu Palace doesn't take the lead in targeting the Xin family, there will be at least a hundred years of peace."</p><p>After a moment's thought, Xin Sheng agreed.</p><p>The next day, representatives from Li Yu Palace arrived, and Qin Sang and his party withdrew from Bi Shui Village, while the Xin family made hurried preparations.</p><p>On the appointed day, Qin Sang and Su Nu went to Li Yu Palace, where Palace Master Yan and Palace Master Ling personally greeted them.</p><p>Ling Du, though not welcoming with a smile, was at least not hostile.</p><p>The banquet concluded with both parties in high spirits.</p><p>Returning from Li Yu Palace, Qin Sang gathered the members of the Hengsha Society and, as promised, refined magical artifacts for each of them.  After completing this, Qin Sang and Su Nu secretly left Qiongze Mountain, taking Xin Sheng and more than a dozen Xin family members with them.</p><p>They did not return to Yumen Pass, but instead took a detour to Duizhou, arriving at a fairy city on the border.</p><p>Qin Sang contacted the Five Elements Alliance, stating his identity. The Alliance quickly arranged a cave dwelling as requested.</p><p>One evening, Qin Sang and his group flew over the mountains, arriving at a place shrouded in fairy clouds, a land of spiritual beauty.</p><p>This place was called Nanpu Chuan. It had once been the site of a sect, but the sect had since fallen into ruin, though the mountain's defensive array remained intact. Qin Sang rented it for a century as a new home for the Xin family.</p><p>As a cultivation site, Nanpu Chuan was far inferior to Qiongze Mountain; the Xin family could not expect to flourish there. However, the mountain contained a superior cave dwelling, sufficient for Xin Sheng to achieve a breakthrough to the Nascent Soul stage.</p><p>Xin Sheng easily controlled the mountain's array.  Knowing Qin Sang was about to leave, she suppressed her emotions, though reluctant to part, and asked, "How will we contact Elder Qin in the future?"</p><p>Qin Sang produced a jade pendant. "I am going to Kan Prefecture, and communication will be difficult, so I will rely on the Five Elements Alliance to relay messages. I will try to maintain contact with the Kan Prefecture branch, and you can simply attach this token to your message."</p><p>Xin Sheng nodded, accepting the pendant solemnly.</p><p>"Until we meet again!"</p><p>Without further delay, Qin Sang bowed slightly and, with Su Nu, departed, their figures transforming into streaks of light.</p><p>Xin Sheng held the jade pendant tightly, standing on the mountaintop watching them until the light disappeared on the horizon.</p><p>...</p><p>After bidding farewell to Xin Sheng, Qin Sang, Su Nu, and Gu Ya, after several changes of location and without stopping, returned to Lian City.</p><p>The great upheaval at Fengju Yumen Pass had yet to subside, with Yumen Pass reduced to an empty city, but Lian City remained peaceful and prosperous as if unaffected.</p><p>Upon entering Lian City, Qin Sang sent Su Nu and Gu Ya away, quickly proceeding to their prearranged meeting place. Finding Jian Nu safe and waiting for him, he immediately asked, "Do you have any news of Senior Tianyue?"</p>
