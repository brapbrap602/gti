<h1>Chapter 1599  Talent</h1><p>Chapter 1599  Talent</p><p>Tianmu Butterfly overcame her fear, gently fluttering her wings and landing on the ground before Qin Sang, revealing her true form.</p><p>From a petite and graceful butterfly, she instantly transformed into a large swallowtail butterfly.  The beautiful patterns on her wings, resembling phoenix feathers, were breathtakingly stunning; Qin Sang was awestruck every time she saw them.</p><p>Her long tail streamers trailed along the ground, extending all the way to the entrance, almost exceeding the capacity of the cave dwelling.</p><p>Tianmu Butterfly slowly opened and closed her wings, her celestial eyes emitting a strange light, which converged in mid-air, forming a circle of light to enclose the energy.</p><p>Qin Sang stopped his cultivation and focused on Tianmu Butterfly’s transformation.</p><p>The light circle was unstable and, carrying the energy, wobbled back and forth before finally settling beside Tianmu Butterfly.  </p><p>Tianmu Butterfly raised her wings, trapping the energy precisely between her two celestial eyes.  Then, the energy was gradually absorbed.</p><p>During this absorption process, Tianmu Butterfly trembled violently, clearly straining.</p><p>Qin Sang could sense that Tianmu Butterfly hadn't yet fully absorbed the energy.</p><p>Even as a spirit insect, Tianmu Butterfly couldn't directly absorb it. She could only rely on her celestial eyes' suppression of the Immortal Fat Bee Dragon to seal the energy within them and then undergo a refining process.</p><p>This process might be even slower than his.</p><p>After understanding the situation, Qin Sang chuckled. Thankfully, he wasn't in a hurry to refine the Near Dragon Saliva, giving Tianmu Butterfly ample time.</p><p>“Absorbing the energy of a Five-Transformation Spirit Insect should bring about significant changes for Tianmu Butterfly, right?”</p><p>Qin Sang looked at Tianmu Butterfly, filled with anticipation.</p><p>Tianmu Butterfly was a major concern for him.</p><p>Based on his experience, before reaching the peak of the late Nascent Soul stage and attempting the breakthrough to the Divine Transformation realm, he needed to enhance both his spirit, energy, and body, and Tianmu Butterfly to their peaks.</p><p>His spiritual sense would undoubtedly reach the required level the fastest.</p><p>For body refinement, he had the *Heavenly Demon Body Tempering* technique.  Given enough time, he could definitely improve.</p><p>The most troublesome aspect was Tianmu Butterfly. Her cultivation speed was too slow, progressing lukewarmly. If it weren’t for the Ascension Spirit Sacrifice technique learned in Hundred Flowers Valley, she might still be at the early stage of the fourth transformation.</p><p>At last, she'd received a chance!</p><p>The man and the insect faced each other.</p><p>In the cave dwelling, they each diligently pursued their respective tasks, without interfering with each other.</p><p>…</p><p>Qin Sang seemed to have forgotten about the Meteoric Iron Whip.</p><p>Once he began cultivating, he completely lost track of time.</p><p>A month after the Yi Treasure Fair ended, Jiang Mu sent a message talisman, followed by two more messengers.  Seeing that the talismans were trapped by the cave dwelling's formation, they ceased to disturb him.</p><p>Ten years passed in a flash.</p><p>The cave dwelling's formation, silent for ten years, suddenly showed unusual fluctuations. A figure slowly walked out.</p><p>Ten years of arduous cultivation.</p><p>Qin Sang had fully mastered the Thousand Knot Divine Net, and the *Fire Seed Golden Lotus* cultivation had also made significant progress. He was prepared to begin refining the Demon Fire Origin, and the chances of success were high, promising a bright future.</p><p>Tianmu Butterfly's cultivation steadily improved while absorbing the Near Dragon Saliva.</p><p>Everything was progressing favorably.</p><p>Qin Sang remembered his avatar and decided to return to the Qingxu Illusory Realm to check on its progress.  Leaving the cave dwelling in high spirits, he noticed the glittering light of the formation's protective barrier.</p><p>Dozens of various message talismans were trapped and suspended within the formation's barrier.</p><p>Qin Sang gestured, and the barrier disappeared. The talismans vibrated slightly and flew into his palm.</p><p>Most of them were useless information.</p><p>Some were from cultivators he had befriended at Feiyun Ferry, inviting him to discuss the Dao or to join treasure hunts and explorations.</p><p>Qin Sang quickly scanned them, picking out those sent by Jiang Mu. After reading them, he quickly headed towards the Yi Character Region.</p><p>The Yi Character Region was where the trading houses were concentrated, and the Six States Hall was no exception.</p><p>The Six States Hall was bustling with activity.</p><p>Qin Sang made no attempt to conceal himself.  As soon as he reached the entrance of the Six States Hall, Jiang Mu hurried out, a wry smile on his face. He bowed slightly, "Daoist Qin, you've kept me in the dark!"</p><p>They had met at Yan Shui Market, and Qin Sang hadn't revealed his true cultivation level before him.</p><p>Jiang Mu had highly regarded Qin Sang, estimating his cultivation to be at most at the mid-Nascent Soul stage.  He never expected him to be a renowned cultivator who had remained unknown to the public.</p><p>“Daoist friend never inquired, so it wasn't concealment.”</p><p>Qin Sang replied with a smile.</p><p>Jiang Mu shook his head repeatedly and gestured, inviting Qin Sang into the Six States Hall.</p><p>Qin Sang had thought that Jiang Mu would indirectly inquire about his identity.  Great cultivators in the world all had names and reputations; the sudden appearance of an unknown cultivator would naturally arouse curiosity.</p><p>After the Yi Treasure Fair, he had killed the Crocodile Demon using rarely known divine abilities.</p><p>The Six States Hall would likely draw connections.</p><p>Jiang Mu was tactful, avoiding the subject and instead asking about the Meteor Iron Whip.  "Ten years ago, following Daoist Qin's instructions, I purchased the Meteor Iron Whip and have kept it here.  Have you come to retrieve it, Daoist Qin?"</p><p>"Indeed," Qin Sang replied directly. "Has your establishment investigated the origin of the Meteor Iron Whip?"</p><p>Jiang Mu sighed, "That's a difficult request, Daoist Qin... Please, follow me, and you'll see."</p><p>He dismissed his attendants.</p><p>Jiang Mu led Qin Sang to the rear building, through several pavilions and corridors, to a secluded courtyard, where he knocked on the door of a quiet room.</p><p>"What's with the knocking! I said I don't want anyone to come in, and you still do?!"  A disgruntled voice yelled from within.</p><p>Jiang Mu chuckled and pushed open the door. "I was concerned about disturbing the young friend's cultivation."</p><p>Qin Sang entered.</p><p>The room was small, everything visible at a glance. It was a fire chamber used for refining weapons. Since Feiyun Ferry was situated above the lake, it didn't use underground fire veins; instead, it used a special spirit fire for refining.</p><p>The flame was a dull yellowish hue, gentle and easy to control.  Shelves along the wall held jade slips, ancient books, and refining materials.</p><p>Only a long-haired young man was in the room. He had the cultivation of a mid-stage Golden Core cultivator, a considerable expert in Central Plains, but he was unkempt, sitting on the floor engrossed in an ancient book.</p><p>When they entered, the youth didn't look up, speaking to Jiang Mu rudely. He scoffed, sneering, "Much obliged, Elder Jiang. This is indeed a wonderful place for cultivation! I've been imprisoned here for ten years, and finally, Elder Jiang remembers me. Have you figured out how to deal with me?"</p><p>Even now, he couldn't understand how he'd offended the Six States Hall.  Knowing escape was impossible, and he couldn't fight the Six States Hall alone, he decided to vent his frustration.</p><p>Jiang Mu didn't get angry, smiling at the youth. "For the past ten years, we've not only provided you with many refining manuals, but also various materials for practice and bought your finished products at high prices.  I wouldn't say we've mistreated you."</p><p>The youth threw down the book in anger.  "Ten years of imprisonment, without reason! If it were you, Elder Jiang, could you bear it?  Everyone says the Six States Hall is righteous and trustworthy, but you're all hypocritical, bullying a lone cultivator with no backing!"</p><p>"Daoist Qin, this young man, Shen Chen, is the owner of the Meteor Iron Whip, and he personally crafted it," Jiang Mu explained to Qin Sang.</p><p>Knowing Qin Sang was a powerful cultivator, the Six States Hall, after careful consideration, judged Qin Sang's goal was likely the artifact, and the situation would remain manageable.  They decided that paying a small price to befriend a powerful cultivator was worthwhile. They secretly found the Meteor Iron Whip's creator and brought him to Feiyun Ferry.</p><p>The youth was startled, looking at Qin Sang with suspicion, realizing that his captor wasn't the Six States Hall, but this mysterious person. The Six States Hall was acting on this person's orders. Who was he?</p><p>Qin Sang was somewhat surprised.  The youth's cultivation was lower than expected—he'd recently broken through to mid-stage Golden Core—meaning he was likely at an even lower level when he refined the Meteor Iron Whip.  He’d assumed the creator would be at least late-stage Golden Core!  Unless incredibly talented, a refiner's ability is closely tied to cultivation.</p><p>The Soul Binding Rope could suppress the Jade Bone Demon Lord. Although the Meteor Iron Whip only borrowed a portion of the Soul Binding Rope fragment's power, not involving the core spirit array, the youth's ability to forge a complete and usable artifact was remarkable.</p><p>"Where did you obtain the meteorite fragment on the Meteor Iron Whip?" Qin Sang asked Shen Chen directly, not shying away from Jiang Mu.</p><p>Jiang Mu stood aside, equally curious about the meteorite.  Even the Hall Master and others, after the Treasure Exchange, had examined the Meteor Iron Whip repeatedly, only confirming the meteorite fragment's unusual nature—it wasn't a modern artifact—but unable to determine its origin.</p><p>Qin Sang’s tone was gentle.  Shen Chen, however, felt an inexplicable fear, knowing his life was in this person’s hands. He no longer dared be so arrogant, answering honestly, "In a sky pit in southern Barbarian State."</p><p>Jiang Mu added, "We sent people to the Barbarian State. The sky pit is near the South Sea. We didn't find any other fragments, but analysis suggests the pit wasn't naturally formed." He observed Qin Sang's expression as he spoke.</p><p>"We have two theories:  First, it might be genuine extraterrestrial meteorite, creating the pit upon impact. Second, powerful cultivators might have battled there, altering the terrain, and the meteorite is a fragment of some unique treasure. We lean towards the second theory. Legend says a great battle once occurred in the two southern Barbarian States, leaving them devastated…"</p><p>The southern Barbarian States again!</p><p>Qin Sang’s heart stirred. The Soul Binding Rope fragment was found in the Barbarian State. The Gu God Cult spread its teachings in the southern Barbarian States, its scriptures describing the South Sea Immortal Palace as a paradise.</p><p>The Two Southern Barbarians states hold many secrets!</p><p>Hua Shen still possesses the Gu God Order bestowed by the Gu God Sect.  Previously, first there was my own breakthrough, and then Hua Shen’s seclusion to cultivate the "Ice Soul Divine Light," leaving me without time to contact the Gu God Sect. Perhaps I should reach out?</p><p>This thought crossed Qin Sang's mind.  Remaining composed, she raised her left hand, her fingers glowing with spiritual light, tracing runes in the air, forming the outline of a spirit array.</p><p>This is a formation my senior sister and Bai devised to activate the Demon-Binding Rope; Qin Sang only showed a small portion of it.</p><p>"Recognize it?" Qin Sang asked the young man.</p><p>Shen Chen looked up, staring at the array for a while, his mouth widening, unable to look away, completely enthralled, forgetting to respond.</p><p>Jiang Mu wanted to wake him, but Qin Sang stopped him with a wave of her hand.</p><p>After an incense stick's time…</p><p>Shen Chen suddenly cried out in pain, clutching his head, his cries filled with agony.</p><p>"This array far exceeds your current level. You can study it, but it's best not to attempt to visualize the runes with your divine sense and arrange it within your Purple Mansion," Qin Sang discerned the situation and offered a warning.</p><p>The pain subsided, and Shen Chen, still shaken, murmured his thanks, "Thank you, senior, for your warning."</p><p>After a pause, he couldn't help but ask, "This formation... is it of the same origin as the meteorite fragments?"</p><p>"Have you never seen it before?"</p><p>Qin Sang's expression changed.</p><p>If this young man had never seen this formation before, yet could discern the connection in such a short time, his talent is truly exceptional. No wonder he could refine the Meteorite God Whip.</p><p>Shen Chen shook his head. "Junior only found a few fragments back then, and discovered nothing else."</p><p>Qin Sang questioned him again thoroughly, confirming that the young man knew only this much. Exchanging a glance with Jiang Mu, she tossed a pouch of spirit stones to Shen Chen, then paused just as she was about to leave.</p><p>"You said you're a wandering cultivator?" Qin Sang looked Shen Chen up and down.</p><p>Under Qin Sang's gaze, Shen Chen felt uncomfortable and dared not conceal anything, explaining honestly, "When I was young, I apprenticed under a master, from a small sect. My master offended a powerful figure within the sect and they were both expelled. Later, my master suffered an accident, dying from his injuries. I was fortunate enough to learn the art of refinement, making artifacts to earn a living.  I barely managed to become self-sufficient, and not wishing to be bound, I never joined another sect…"</p><p>Jiang Mu saw Qin Sang's intention and added, "Shen Xiaoyou is exceptionally talented, quite well-known in the Southwest Desert State and has received invitations from several sects."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded slightly and said gravely, "Would you be willing to learn the art of refinement from me?"</p><p>Shen Chen was stunned.</p><p>Imprisoned by the Six States Hall for ten years, he thought he had committed some crime and his time was short. Unexpectedly, a twist of fate, this seemingly powerful and mysterious expert wanted to take him as a disciple.</p><p>Qin Sang acted on impulse; she hadn't planned to take on a disciple in the Central State. Seeing Shen Chen's ability to recognize the connection between the Demon-Binding Rope and the array, she changed her mind.</p><p>In the future, once she subdues the source of the demonic fire, she can restore the demonic banner to its original state and repair the Sealing Demon Stake.</p><p>The Sealing Demon Stake has the same function as the Demon-Binding Rope, capable of restraining ancient demons, but on a higher level.  It's the ultimate weapon against ancient demons.</p><p>The problem is, the Sealing Demon Stake is broken in two.</p><p>She needs to repair it first, then deduce the formation that complements the Sealing Demon Stake based on this array. It's a very complex and laborious task.</p><p>These days, traces of ancient demons are everywhere.</p><p>Who knows when she might encounter one again?  It's not a bad idea to be prepared.</p><p>However, in the foreseeable future, Qin Sang will find it difficult to focus on this.</p><p>Taking Shen Chen as a disciple is a strategic move.</p><p>Shen Chen's cultivation is currently low, but he managed to reach the Golden Core mid-stage as a wandering cultivator while also refining artifacts, proving his talent is not lacking.</p><p>If Qin Sang is willing to invest some effort, bringing him to the Nascent Soul stage wouldn't be difficult.</p><p>After only a moment of shock, Shen Chen kowtowed, "Disciple Shen Chen, greets Master!"</p><p>This person, despite imprisoning him for ten years, didn't harm him, and even gave him a pouch of spirit stones after questioning him. Clearly, they're not vicious.</p><p>The fact that the Six States Hall would break its rules for this person shows that their cultivation and status are extremely high.</p><p>These two reasons alone were enough to convince Shen Chen.</p><p>"Congratulations, Daoist Qin, on taking on such an excellent disciple!"</p><p>Jiang Mu clasped his hands and smiled, a look of regret on his face, "Shen Xiaoyou's talent in refinement is evident. I've been meaning to invite Shen Xiaoyou to join the Six States Hall after everything is settled, but Daoist Qin has beaten me to it!"</p><p>—</p><p>—</p><p>Happy New Year to everyone!  Wishing you all the best!</p>
