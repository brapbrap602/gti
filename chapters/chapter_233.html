<h1>Chapter 226: Three-horned Dragon Car</h1><p>Chapter 226: Three-horned Dragon Car</p><p>Xuanlu Guan sent people to investigate after acquiring the information, but the secret realm entrance was well-hidden and it took a long while and investigation from many sides to ascertain the secret realm's true location. Searching for the entrance to a secret realm was the purpose of gathering all these manpower together.</p><p>They were not the only ones who wanted to go to the secret realm; many others had not yet appeared. Among them, the one in the lead was of course the experts in the Core Formation Stage from all the great sects.</p><p>Based on the information obtained from the Demonic Cultivators, the secret realm’s true identity should be an ancient cultivator's legacy. The ancient cultivator's legacy was very large in size. A few key locations deep within the ancient cultivator's legacy were the true core of the ancient cultivator's cave dwelling. There was a complete array of protective magic there, and it was extremely dangerous. Even the Demonic Sect had been unable to explore it thoroughly.</p><p>There must have been treasures inside the ancient cultivator's cave dwelling that would move Core Formation Stage cultivators, but Qin Sang did not even dare think about them. Just listening to the information and being envious was enough.</p><p>As for Qin Sang and his companions, their main task upon entering the secret realm was to clear the areas other than these few important locations. The eyes of the Core Formation Stage cultivators were trained on the ancient cultivator's cave dwelling, and they wanted to compete for the old treasures within. Treasures in other areas would do little to move their hearts; they were not willing to waste too much energy on these, for fear that the ancient treasures in the cave dwelling would be taken away by someone else. At least until the ancient treasures in the cave dwelling had been divided, no Core Formation Stage cultivator would fight over the items outside. How much they could acquire would depend on Qin Sang and his companions' abilities.</p><p>Although the ancient cultivator's legacy may have been cleaned out by the Demonic Sect, ten thousand years had passed. Even an ordinary spiritual herb, which had not been picked in the secret realm, would have transformed into a divine herb that everyone would fight over if it had survived this long!</p><p>Of course, as the first batch of cultivators to enter the secret realm, they would definitely encounter many unknown dangers, and it was not unheard of for people to carelessly lose their lives here.</p><p>However, they would also have a higher chance of finding treasures than those who came later.</p><p>Weighing the pros and cons, being able to enter the secret realm as part of the first batch was truly a great opportunity. Naturally, everyone would want a piece of this action. Qin Sang and his three companions were among those credited with discovering the secret realm, so they were able to secure a spot without any effort.</p><p>After he learned about the true purpose of this mission from Mu Yifeng, Qin Sang agreed without hesitation. He asked Yunyouzi about it and found out that he was also going with them.</p><p>After that, they waited patiently in the Heaven Crystal secret realm. More and more people gathered, and among them was someone Qin Sang did not expect to see: Yu Daiyue.</p><p>"Senior Brother Yu, we haven't seen each other for twenty-odd years, right?!"</p><p>When Qin Sang heard that Yu Daiyue had arrived, he immediately stopped cultivating, left the cave dwelling to greet him, and greeted Yu Daiyue warmly.</p><p>They had entered the Ancient Immortal Battlefield together. Yu Daiyue invited him to go along, but Qin Sang rejected his offer. Qin Sang became a Shadow Guard, whereas Yu Daiyue became a rogue cultivator in order to find an opportunity to break through. Now he ended up joining the Shadow Guards too.</p><p>However, Qin Sang discovered that Yu Daiyue's Qi was slightly stronger than it had been twenty years before, but he had not broken through to the mid-Foundation Establishment Stage yet. It showed that he had not obtained his wish and had continued to be stuck at this bottleneck for all these years.</p><p>Twenty years ago, Yu Daiyue's strength had been greater than Mu Yifeng's, but now Mu Yifeng had already broken through to the mid-Foundation Establishment Stage and had far surpassed him.</p><p>Qin Sang noticed that Yu Daiyue's brow was furrowed and that his complexion was not as good as before. He secretly lamented, "I wonder just how much of his spirit has been sapped by twenty years of time."</p><p>Naturally he did not rub salt into his wound. He acted as though he had not noticed Yu Daiyue's cultivation and did not ask anything about it.</p><p>When Yu Daiyue saw Qin Sang, the frustration disappeared from his face, and he forced a smile. "We haven't seen each other in twenty years, but Junior Brother Qin's cultivation is much deeper than before. It won't be long before you surpass your old acquaintance. I can see that there's hope for you to reach the Core Formation Stage in the future! Congratulations. I have made no progress in twenty years, and I'm afraid that I will never break through to the mid-Foundation Establishment Stage."</p><p>After saying this, Yu Daiyue sighed softly. He could not hide the sense of dejection in his voice.</p><p>Qin Sang said, "Senior Brother Yu, don't lose heart! Who can say anything for sure about opportunities? We've heard that there is no shortage of ancient treasures in the ancient cultivator's legacy this time. Perhaps luck will smile upon you, Senior Brother, and you will find one or two to help you break through."</p><p>"To be honest with you, Junior Brother Qin, one of the reasons I fought to join this mission was because I have some expectations. However... my hopes are slim!"</p><p>Yu Daiyue laughed through pursed lips. He extended his cupped hands in a salute and said, "I hope to get what Junior Brother Qin has wished me."</p><p>After Yu Daiyue arrived, they waited another two days.</p><p>Including Qin Sang, there were now twenty-seven Shadow Guards gathered in the Heaven Crystal secret realm. Apart from the three great sects, the other sects under Xuanlu Guan also sent their disciples to participate. Every single one of them was a Foundation Establishment Stage cultivator, and among them were also experts at the late-Foundation Establishment Stage.</p><p>After the twenty-seven of them had assembled, no one else came.</p><p>They waited another day, until evening came. As the people who were cultivating in their cave dwellings felt a sense of panic almost simultaneously, a powerful fluctuation swept through the Heaven Crystal secret realm from the secret realm.</p><p>With a start, they all awoke from their meditation and rushed out of the cave.</p><p>Bang! In a twinkling of an eye, the 27 people all flew to the top of the mountain and hovered in midair. After looking at each other, they fixed their gazes on the entrance of the Heavenly Crystal Mystic Realm and secretly remained on their guard.</p><p>Moments later, an enormous whirlpool abruptly emerged where the entrance was at the sky; from the whirlpool came a deafening roar. Across the whirlpool, there seemed to be a ferocious demon beast.</p><p>Then the whirlpool became larger and larger, and a gigantic dragon head stuck its head in. Its scarlet snake tongue flickered unsteadily while a pair of vertical pupils gazed at the Heavenly Crystal Mystic Realm with an evil look.</p><p>"Disciple Teng Nan pays homage to Uncle-Master."</p><p>Teng Nan, who was guarding the entrance to the Mystic Realm, quivered and immediately bowed down upon seeing the dragon head.</p><p>The dragon head fixated its gaze on where the crowd was.</p><p>Stared at by the evil dragon, Qin Sang felt a chill rise from the depth of his heart. This evil dragon looked like a great demon, yet it gave Qin Sang a strange feeling for some reason. Judging from how Teng Nan addressed it, was this the mount of a certain Golden Core cultivator of the Shangyuan Clear Serenity Palace?</p><p>At this time, the evil dragon unexpectedly began to speak. Its voice was like thunder, causing the entire Heavenly Crystal Mystic Realm to tremble without ceasing. "Are all of you present?"</p><p>This voice sounded somewhat hearty and familiar, which made Qin Sang secretly wonder and turn to look at Yu Daiyue. He had the same expression.</p><p>Xuan Yu Daozhang of the Shangyuan Clear Serenity Palace!</p><p>Qin Sang immediately recalled this person. It was said that several Golden Core cultivators had been sent to guard Xuanguan Pass this time, and Xuan Yu Daozhang was seemingly one of them. He wondered whether Che Yutao would come with him.</p><p>A cultivator in the late Foundation Establishment stage stepped forward and said in a deep voice, "Reporting to Uncle-Master, all 27 people have arrived."</p><p>"Good!"</p><p>The evil dragon nodded its gigantic head and retracted it from the whirlpool. "All of you come out. Time is running out. I will use the Three-Dragon Chariot to take you all there."</p><p>That cultivator turned to look at the crowd and said in a deep voice, "Fellow Daoists, we can set off now."</p><p>Swish, swish…</p><p>Figures dashed into the sky. Qin Sang flew to the entrance, nodded to say farewell to Teng Nan, and walked into the whirlpool.</p>
