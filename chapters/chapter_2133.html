<h1>Chapter 2123: Nine Heavens Azure Pool Thunderstorm Grand Art</h1><p>Great Mercy Zen Temple.</p><p>Due to its location in the desert, the climate was arid, with only a few rains a year.</p><p>At this moment, however, a torrential downpour raged.  All four directions were pitch black, filled only with the roar of the storm.  It was as if the heavens had sprung a leak, pouring down an endless deluge.</p><p>This furious downpour had persisted for a long time, without a moment's respite. The sheer volume of water was enough to submerge any land.</p><p>Yet, no rivers, lakes, or seas formed on the surface. The desert remained a desert.  As the rain struck the ground, it seeped into the earth, as though a bottomless abyss lay beneath, insatiable no matter how much water poured into it.</p><p>Several monks hovered in the air above Great Mercy Zen Temple, surrounding an elderly monk.</p><p>The old monk's skin was a waxy yellow, his figure gaunt, yet his eyes shone with a captivating brilliance, like a bronze statue.</p><p>To his left was a younger monk. The young monk looked around, then activated his spirit vision, gazing towards the far west.</p><p>The torrential rain continued.  Above the curtain of water, occasional bolts of lightning flashed, illuminating heaven and earth.</p><p>These thunderbolts and lightning, both in number and power, were far from comparable to what had come before.</p><p>From the moment the two sides clashed, the Thunder Platform had transformed the desert into a sea of lightning.  Each Thunder Talisman possessed heaven-shattering might, and the spectacle of ten thousand thunderbolts striking simultaneously had become commonplace. The cultivators of the Western Lands finally experienced firsthand the terrifying power of a battle between Soul Formation cultivators.</p><p>This kind of battle, which stirred the might of the heavens, was something they had never imagined before.  In comparison, the war between the Storm Realm and the Changyou Tribe was like two children wielding weapons against each other, clumsy and laughable.</p><p>A short while ago, the thunder had abruptly faded, its momentum drastically weakening.</p><p>However, as the relentless downpour continued to the present moment, an invisible pressure gradually accumulated, growing increasingly dreadful.</p><p>In truth, the power of the Spell Formation had not diminished. The torrential rain firmly held the enemy at bay.</p><p>"If the enemy breaks through this barrage, they will approach the temple," the young monk whispered, his voice laced with worry.</p><p>For over a year, the enemy had continuously breached one defensive line after another. Each loss forced the Storm Realm to retreat a significant distance, abandoning vast swathes of land.</p><p>Now, more than half of the Western Lands desert had fallen. If one were to look down from above, a distinct boundary would be visible. To the east of the boundary lay the endless yellow sands, while to the west, the landscape had transformed, shifting from desert to verdant mountains and clear waters.</p><p>The desert's renewed vitality brought not hope, but a dense killing intent.</p><p>The fall of the desert signified not only the loss of territory but also the destruction of the meticulously constructed Spell Formations within it. Fortunately, Qin Sang had not abandoned the cultivators stationed at the Spell Formations.  Each time a formation fell, they were able to retreat in time.  Thus, despite appearing to retreat repeatedly, the Storm Realm’s casualties were not severe.</p><p>Now, the enemy had pressed close. Master Huaiyin was leading the monks, stationed at the Spell Formation behind Great Mercy Zen Temple.  Would they have to abandon the temple again if they retreated further?</p><p>As the saying goes, it is hard to leave one's homeland. The monks of Great Mercy Zen Temple did not want to relive the painful memories of the past.</p><p>"Amitabha!"</p><p>The old monk, an elder of the Arhat Hall, pressed his palms together, neither sorrowful nor joyful. "I believe Grandmaster has a plan."</p><p>At this moment, a fierce battle raged within the downpour.</p><p>For this battle, Qin Sang meticulously selected several Thunder Talismans from the Five Thunder Emissary Seal. Similar to the Twelve Thunder God Talismans, these were suitable for formations. The Nine Heavens Azure Pool Thunderstorm Grand Art was one such talisman.</p><p>It drew upon the waters of the Nine Heavens Azure Pool, bringing them down to the mortal realm. Though thunder was unseen, its power permeated everywhere. The raindrops of the thunderstorm were not ordinary rainwater, but transformed Heavenly and Earthly Qi, each drop imbued with immense thunderous might.</p><p>As the raindrops fell upon the earth, the power of thunder would dissipate, returning to the heavens, cycling endlessly. This is why the torrential rain did not cause floods in the desert.</p><p>Qin Sang watched coldly as raindrops exploded upon contact with his body, his figure shrouded in a watery mist.</p><p>Figures swarmed within the downpour.</p><p>As the raindrops descended, they transformed into Thunder Soldiers. These soldiers possessed no intelligence, no thoughts, and no pain. They were pure killing machines.</p><p>However, through the Spell Formation, Qin Sang could draw upon the will of cultivators from various sub-formations, imbuing it into the Thunder Soldiers.</p><p>At this very moment, within each sub-formation, the Formation Masters and Guardians felt as though they had entered a kind of 'illusory realm.'</p><p>Within this 'illusory realm,' they found themselves on a rain-soaked battlefield, possessing a Thunder clone. They could sense the chilling atmosphere of the battlefield, the oppressive presence of the enemy, as if they were truly present.</p><p>They seemed to merge with the Thunder Soldiers, controlling them remotely across vast distances.</p><p>This was a novel sensation.  Previously, they could only assist Qin Sang in deploying Thunder Talismans through the formation. This was the first time they felt so immersed, truly understanding the nature of the battlefield and the terrifying power of the enemy.</p><p>Upon joining the battlefield, they were infected by its atmosphere.  Although they were unsure whether the death of a Thunder Soldier would affect them, they felt incredibly tense.</p><p>After all, they were only wisps of will projected here. They still needed a commander to lead them, which were the cultivators truly present on the battlefield.</p><p>Countless Thunder Soldiers formed vast formations. Gui Hou and the others were at the very center, their true bodies present, where they should be protected.</p><p>More and more thunderous power surged in, causing the formations to transform, generating power far surpassing their cultivation levels.</p><p>"Kill!"</p><p>A roar shook the heavens.</p><p>The Thunder Soldiers transformed into black torrents, rushing towards the enemy lines with overwhelming momentum, causing the earth to tremble and the void to shudder.</p><p>The two sides instantly collided.</p><p>It appeared that only Gui Hou and the others were truly present on the battlefield, but behind them stood the combined might of the entire Storm Realm.</p><p>Despite the enemy possessing several Soul Formation level experts, the Thunder Soldiers showed no fear.  Even if outmatched, at the brink of death, they had one final, devastating technique—self-detonation!</p><p>'Boom! Boom! Boom!'</p><p>In an instant, countless bursts of thunderous light flashed across the battlefield, like the most dazzling fireworks, blooming with a tragic beauty.</p><p>Moments later, Qin Sang also charged into the fray.</p><p>Through repeated clashes, Qin Sang's Body Cultivation techniques had been largely revealed, even the Five Elements Crown had been used multiple times.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, the moment Qin Sang appeared, he immediately drew the attention of the powerful figures within the enemy ranks.</p><p>He showed no weakness, unleashing both the Great Vajra Wheel Seal and the Sun Wheel Seal. Backed by the Nine Heavens Azure Pool Thunderstorm Grand Art, even when surrounded, he appeared majestic and imposing.</p><p>Seizing an opportunity, Qin Sang once again summoned the Five Elements Crown, firing alternating beams of Five Elements Divine Light.</p><p>The cultivator targeted by the Five Elements Crown had no time to react.</p><p>During this period, the Five Elements Crown had repeatedly proven its power. Though it had yet to slay anyone, the companion beasts struck by the Five Elements Divine Light were either killed or crippled, instilling great fear within Lu Wang's side.</p><p>This cultivator had a delicate appearance and wore brocade robes, resembling a female cultivator.</p><p>Through collective brainstorming, they had finally devised a method to counter it. One of their objectives this time was to draw out the Five Elements Divine Light, thus requiring someone to act as bait.</p><p>This brocade-robed cultivator was the bait.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>Beams of Five Elements Divine Light arrived in rapid succession.</p><p>The others halted their actions, each summoning a token.</p><p>The tokens were crimson, wider at the top and narrower at the bottom, resembling command arrows, wreathed in flames, trailing long streams of fire as they moved.</p><p>Flames danced as all the tokens faced the brocade-robed cultivator, their fiery glow dazzling.</p><p>Just as the Five Elements Divine Light struck the brocade-robed cultivator, a burst of flames erupted before him, transforming into a ring of fire.</p><p>Through the fire ring, it could be seen that the brocade-robed cultivator, at the instant the Five Elements Divine Light struck, was not completely immobilized. He visibly twisted, yet still failed to evade the Reverse Five Elements Divine Light. In that critical moment, Lu Gan acted swiftly, a flash of Primordial Yellow Light teleporting the brocade-robed cultivator away.</p><p>Witnessing this, the cultivators' eyes lit up. The tokens, crafted by the Grand Sacrificer himself, were designed to counter the Five Elements Crown. Though they failed to save that cultivator, they finally saw a glimmer of hope.</p><p>As they continued their probing attacks, Qin Sang’s understanding of the Eight Desolate Diagram deepened. When the brocade-robed cultivator escaped, he distinctly felt a resistance. A moment later, and the outcome might have been dire.</p><p>Therefore, a treasure to counter the Five Elements Crown was crucial.</p><p>This treasure still had room for improvement. Having achieved their objective, the cultivators signaled each other and began an orderly retreat.</p><p>The battlefield gradually quieted, the Thunder Soldiers reverting to raindrops, the torrential downpour continuing without end.</p><p>...</p><p>East of the Demonic Sea.</p><p>There was a solitary island on the sea. Although small, it possessed exceptionally abundant spiritual energy. Cultivators were permanently stationed on this island, their task to monitor the changes within the Tainted Lands.</p><p>Located near the Tainted Lands, the island faced the risk of beast attacks and also had to be wary of the Changyou Tribe.</p><p>However, many cultivators still competed for this assignment. This was because the island housed a grand formation personally laid down by Fairy Liu Li, capable of concealing the island's location. Over the years, nothing untoward had occurred. Moreover, stationed here, they only needed to observe the Tainted Lands, without having to participate in battles, and their cultivation was unaffected. It was a desirable post.</p><p>A stone hall stood on the small island, along with three excavated caves. Three cultivators were stationed here together, allowing them to take turns in closed-door cultivation.</p><p>At this moment, within the stone hall, a brocade-robed cultivator sat before a mirror disk.</p><p>The cultivator sat cross-legged, hands on his knees, constantly changing hand seals, comprehending a Daoist art. He would occasionally glance at the mirror disk.</p><p>The mirror disk reflected the scene within the Tainted Lands. Black miasma surged and roiled, a grand and imposing sight. This scene had persisted for nearly a century, with changes occurring only during the receding tide.</p><p>Immersed in his Daoist art, the brocade-robed cultivator did not notice the gradual changes within the mirror disk.</p><p>The flow of the miasma suddenly slowed. Collisions became less frequent, and finally, all the miasma seemed to solidify, clearly revealing the stagnant streams of miasma, stacked to form walls of mist.</p><p>In the next instant, stillness gave way to motion. All the miasma exploded with a roar, forming a giant tidal wave of mist.</p><p>The brocade-robed cultivator seemed to sense something, turning his gaze towards the mirror disk, his eyes fixated. He hurried towards it.</p><p>The explosion was followed by a rapid contraction. The miasma recoiled as if the power accumulated over a century had suddenly been released, frantically retreating, revealing the sea surface previously shrouded by the mist.</p><p>Immediately following was another round of eruption, the miasma reclaiming its lost ground. This scene repeated itself continuously.</p><p>'Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!'</p><p>Three figures rushed into the hall.</p><p>The brocade-robed cultivator bowed to an elderly man, saying, "Uncle Bai."</p><p>This was his first time stationed here. Unsure whether this was a sign of the receding tide, he looked anxiously at the old man.</p><p>Uncle Bai stared intently at the mirror disk. After a moment, he threw back his head and laughed. "The tainted qi is finally receding! Quick, quickly report to the sect!"</p><p>His excitement had a reason. According to the rules, he was likely to receive a strand of Azure Spiritual Qi this time!</p><p>"Yes!"</p><p>The brocade-robed cultivator and the other two immediately set up a formation. They were all cultivators of the Profound Heaven Palace, and quickly relayed the news back to the sect.</p><p>...</p><p>Azure Ram Temple.</p><p>The protective formation was activated, clouds and mist obscuring the sky, concealing the unusual phenomena caused by the main altar.</p><p>Currently, most of Azure Ram Temple's experts were dispatched to oversee the sub-formations, leaving few within the mountain gate.</p><p>At this time, a streak of light flew in from the west, approaching the protective formation without any sign of stopping.</p><p>A Daoist boy flew out from the clouds and mist, shouting, "Who goes there?"</p><p>The streak of light paused slightly, revealing a human figure.</p><p>The Daoist boy recognized the newcomer's appearance and hastily bowed. "This junior greets Palace Master Shi!"</p><p>Shi Xue nodded. "I have urgent matters to report to Grandmaster."</p><p>"This..."</p><p>The Daoist boy hesitated, then a voice transmitted to his ear, "Let her in."</p><p>Recognizing his ancestor's voice, the Daoist boy relaxed, bowing and saying, "Palace Master Shi, please enter!"</p><p>On the Spell Formation, Qin Sang's Dharma Body looked towards the mountain gate, wondering what urgent matter Shi Xue had to come in person.</p><p>Upon entering Azure Ram Temple, Shi Xue saw a Spell Formation towering into the sky, magnificent and imposing. Suppressing her astonishment, she flew upwards, saying, "The tainted qi shows signs of receding!"</p><p>"Oh?"</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes flickered. According to the usual cycle, it was indeed time for the tide to recede, but it was earlier than in previous years.</p><p>"Has Liu Li not returned?" Qin Sang guessed the reason for Shi Xue's personal visit.</p><p>"No!"</p><p>Shi Xue shook her head, a flicker of anxiety crossing her pretty face. "Could something have happened to Junior Sister?"</p><p>Before departing, Liu Li had said she wouldn't miss the competition for the Azure Spiritual Qi. Without her, the Storm Realm would find it difficult to contend with the Changyou Tribe.</p><p>Logically, she should have returned six months ago, but now there was no news of her, making them inevitably worried.</p><p>Qin Sang frowned. Ever since learning about Liu Li's mysterious 'Master,' he had been reassured, but now he couldn't help but feel a little uneasy.</p><p>"With Liu Li's intelligence, there's no need to worry about her safety. She might be delayed by other matters," Qin Sang consoled.</p><p>Thinking optimistically, Liu Li didn't know that Patriarch Min Zhuo had already achieved a breakthrough. Perhaps she had also found an opportunity for a breakthrough and, after careful consideration, decided that as long as she could successfully break through to Soul Formation, a single loss wouldn't matter, choosing to focus on her breakthrough.</p><p>"I hope so..."</p><p>Shi Xue suppressed her unease, then asked, "Should we still compete for the Azure Spiritual Qi this time?"</p><p>The timing was unfortunate. With the enemy army pressing in, the Storm Realm’s experts were all occupied. Sending a random group would certainly not be a match for the Changyou Tribe.</p><p>Between the Azure Spiritual Qi and a matter of life and death, she naturally knew which was more important, inwardly resigning herself to giving up this time.</p><p>...</p><p>Western Lands.</p><p>Within a mountain's stone wall, several caves had been excavated to serve as caves for Min Zhuo and the Changyou Tribe cultivators.</p><p>Inside one cave, a Changyou Tribe elder was meditating when his wrist suddenly flashed with light. He immediately awoke, received the information from outside, and hurried out of the cave, flying towards the cave closest to the mountain peak, activating the restriction.</p><p>"Enter!"</p><p>Inside the cave, Patriarch Min Zhuo was healing his injuries, which were not serious, sustained during the previous assault on the formation.</p><p>The elder quickly entered the cave.</p><p>Min Zhuo asked, "What is it?"</p>
