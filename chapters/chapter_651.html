<h1>Chapter 643: Terrifying Insect</h1><p>After these preparations, Qin Sang retreated into the shadows and left the stone platform.</p><p>He sensed the locations of the several Bloodwing Ghost-Head Hornet larvae and manipulated them to explore outwards, spreading the scent of Redfire Gilded Gold further.</p><p>Silently, the scent of Redfire Gilded Gold drifted through the cave. Qin Sang and the Flying Night Devil lay in wait for the spirit insect to appear.</p><p>The cave fell silent.</p><p>A long time passed with no activity.</p><p>Qin Sang remained patient, still as a withered tree. He held the Ten Yama Banners, prepared to use the Nine Nether Demonic Fire to help capture the Dusk Cicada.</p><p>During this period, Qin Sang had continuously cultivated, comprehending the Ten Yama Formation and Sword Light Splitting, making significant progress, and could now barely use them in combat.</p><p>The underground river flowed gently.</p><p>Qin Sang had waited for almost an hour, yet there was still no movement, and he couldn't help but grow suspicious.  In this time, the scent of Redfire Gilded Gold had spread far and wide.  Spirit insects should be very sensitive to such rare treasures, unless they were sleeping or hibernating.</p><p>The temptation of transformation is irresistible to any spirit insect.</p><p>Could it be that the Dusk Cicadas had truly migrated?</p><p>Just as Qin Sang was pondering, his gaze suddenly sharpened; the connection to one of the Ghost-Head Hornet larvae was severed.</p><p>Qin Sang abruptly turned his head, his eyes like lightning, staring intently at a crack in the rock on the opposite riverbank.</p><p>The depths of the crack were shrouded in darkness and overflowing with Yin energy.</p><p>The Bloodwing Ghost-Head Hornet larva vanished without a sound. He hadn't sensed anything at all?</p><p>Just then, a sudden change occurred.</p><p>In an instant, all three Bloodwing Ghost-Head Hornet larvae along that line disappeared.</p><p>Something was approaching him silently in the darkness, and at an astonishing speed, devouring all the larvae coated with Redfire Gilded Gold.</p><p>"Something's wrong!"</p><p>Qin Sang's expression changed drastically.</p><p>To spread the scent of Redfire Gilded Gold as far as possible, he had deliberately controlled the distance between each larva.</p><p>The depths of the cave were complex, twisting and turning.</p><p>Even if he used the Sword Qi Thunderclap technique to travel by sword, it would be impossible for him to cross the distance between the three larvae so quickly and kill them instantly.</p><p>It's important to note that after using Sword Qi Thunderclap, Qin Sang's speed was comparable to a mid-Core Formation cultivator.</p><p>Too fast!</p><p>A Second Transformation Dusk Cicada definitely didn't possess such terrifying abilities, let alone the ability to evade his senses.</p><p>This was a Third Transformation Dusk Cicada!</p><p>Did the person who discovered the Dusk Cicadas misjudge its stage, or had the Dusk Cicada undergone a transformation over the years?</p><p>This thought had just flashed through Qin Sang's mind when he abruptly turned his head towards the stone platform.</p><p>For a split second, he seemed to catch a glimpse of a shadowy figure in his peripheral vision, gone in a flash. When he looked at the stone platform, there was nothing there.</p><p>And the Bloodwing Ghost-Head Hornet larva used as bait had disappeared!</p><p>Almost instinctively, Qin Sang was about to activate the Nine Nether Demonic Fire and rush towards the stone platform to capture the Dusk Cicada. But at that moment, an extremely dangerous feeling arose, sending a shiver down his spine.</p><p>This feeling came from the Flying Night Devil lurking at the bottom of the river!</p><p>He and the Flying Night Devil shared a mental connection, allowing him to keenly sense any changes in the devil. This sense of danger was incredibly clear.</p><p>"Not good!"</p><p>Qin Sang's heart skipped a beat.  He abandoned the idea of capturing the Dusk Cicada without hesitation, pushing off the ground with his foot and shooting towards the cave exit above like lightning.</p><p>The Ebony Sword flew out from between his eyebrows, its light circling his body as the sound of thunder echoed through the cave.</p><p>At the same time, water splashed in the underground river as the Flying Night Devil soared into the air.</p><p>*Splash!*</p><p>The Flying Night Devil didn't even glance at the stone platform, fleeing towards the cave exit at its maximum speed.</p><p>Speed was the Flying Night Devil's forte, but it seemed to have no advantage against the Dusk Cicada lurking in the darkness.</p><p>An exceptionally sharp aura had locked onto it and was easily catching up. Before the splashing water droplets could fall, a shadowy figure appeared, slicing through countless droplets and instantly closing in on the Flying Night Devil.</p><p>Qin Sang looked back in alarm, just in time to witness this scene.  Shocked, he hurriedly ordered the Flying Night Devil to dodge.</p><p>Simultaneously, he hastily opened the Corpse Puppet Bag and threw out several refined corpses to buy the Flying Night Devil some time.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the moment these refined corpses landed near the Flying Night Devil, they were instantly chopped into pieces, their effect negligible.  Only then could he vaguely see that what had killed them was a dark, two-pointed, shuttle-shaped sword formed from Yin energy.</p><p>The Dusk Cicada's true body was hidden within the dark sword.</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>Two intersecting, cross-shaped sword shadows bloomed across the Flying Night Devil's chest, leaving two identical wounds, deep enough to see bone!</p><p>Qin Sang gasped.</p><p>The Flying Night Devil's physical body was extremely strong, tempered by Earthlyç…ž Qi, surpassing even early Core Formation body refinement cultivators.</p><p>After entering the Core Formation stage, the power of spells far exceeded that of the Foundation Establishment stage, becoming known as Dao techniques. Qin Sang had tested it; the Flying Night Devil could withstand his Dao techniques with its physical body.</p><p>Even against low-grade magic treasures, the Flying Night Devil could endure by channeling its Corpse Qi.</p><p>Just now, Qin Sang had manipulated the Flying Night Devil to concentrate all its Corpse Qi to its chest, yet it offered no resistance, easily pierced by the Dusk Cicada, leaving two terrifying wounds.</p><p>If he hadn't reacted in time, the Flying Night Devil might have been cut in half.</p><p>The rumors about higher-stage Dusk Cicadas having the ability to break spells seemed to be true for this one.</p><p>It was definitely not newly transformed.</p><p>Qin Sang felt incredibly fortunate that he hadn't activated the Ten Yama Banners and used the Nine Nether Demonic Fire to capture the insect, instead choosing to flee when things seemed amiss.  The Dusk Cicada was so agile and possessed spell-breaking abilities, making it nearly impossible to trap. Qin Sang wouldn't gamble his life for a single insect.</p><p>Qin Sang was temporarily out of danger, but the Flying Night Devil was in a perilous situation.</p><p>If pursued any further by the Dusk Cicada, the Flying Night Devil would be crippled!</p><p>He couldn't let the Flying Night Devil be destroyed here.</p><p>This refined corpse had gained a fortuitous encounter, becoming comparable to a true Flying Night Devil, a powerful asset. Even if he refined another one later, it would be impossible to replicate.</p><p>"Faster! Faster!"</p><p>Qin Sang was extremely anxious, fully mobilizing his divine sense to probe the depths of the cave, finally sensing two Bloodwing Ghost-Head Hornet larvae.</p><p>He had split off some minute strands of his divine sense, hiding them within the larvae. But because they were released so far, he could only barely sense their location and couldn't control them freely.</p><p>When he realized something was wrong, Qin Sang immediately began to fully sense the divine sense within these larvae.</p><p>"Explode!"</p><p>*Crack!*</p><p>Deep within the cave, the two larvae self-destructed in succession, the scent of Redfire Gilded Gold on them vanishing along with them.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang felt a silent change around the Flying Night Devil.  Although he couldn't see it, he was certain that the Dusk Cicada had left.</p><p>"Whew!"</p><p>Qin Sang let out a long breath, not daring to stay in the cave.  He hurriedly retrieved the Flying Night Devil and fled by sword, not stopping until he flew out of the wasteland.</p>
