<h1>Chapter 2011: Seeking Manpower</h1><p>Fourteen Sword Pavilions of the Ziwei Palace have been discovered in the Storm World, five in total. Whether there are more undiscovered pavilions remains unknown.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't be certain if the pavilion fragments found in the Fengju Jade Gate originated from other pavilions or were remnants from the five pavilions breaking apart during ascension.</p><p>He only hoped it wasn't from the unknown pavilion in the West.</p><p>Within the Sword Pavilions lay countless treasures.  Especially the Ziwei Palace, the dojo of the Ziwei Sword Venerable, whose true form was revealed during its ascension, leaving a lasting impression on countless cultivators. Qin Sang still vividly remembers the spectacle.</p><p>Years of exploration in the Xiaohan Domain by generations of cultivators have barely scratched the surface of the Ziwei Palace's riches.</p><p>Gaining possession of the true Ziwei Palace and its treasures, or even any other Sword Pavilion, would represent unimaginable wealth, solving Qin Sang's cultivation resource worries forever.</p><p>However, Qin Sang knew this was unlikely. Many powerful figures secretly watched; the appearance of any Sword Pavilion would attract them, and he would be crushed effortlessly. There was no chance for him to fish in troubled waters.</p><p>For the Dissect Sword and its cultivation techniques, sacrifices had to be made. The First Sword Attendant and Tianyue Shangren had clearly decided to abandon the Ziwei Palace to create an opportunity for him to obtain the Dissect Sword fragments. This included relinquishing the accumulated wealth of the Ziwei lineage.</p><p>It was foreseeable that a scramble for the Ziwei Palace would soon erupt in the Fengju Jade Gate. Qin Sang could only sigh with regret; ensuring his own safety would be fortunate enough, let alone seeking more.</p><p>“All those familiar with the Fengju Jade Gate have been hired. There isn't a single guide left in the city?”</p><p>Qin Sang frowned, making the steward, Ruan, tremble.  He realized Elder Qin was not someone to be trifled with.</p><p>“To say there aren't any at all isn’t entirely true. For example, some are exorbitantly priced, or some have just returned from the Fengju Jade Gate and haven't been hired yet. Also, there are some veteran powerhouses in the city who are more familiar with the Fengju Jade Gate than anyone else. But some are reclusive, others prefer to work alone, and are difficult to hire… How many people is Elder Qin planning to hire?” Ruan cautiously asked.</p><p>“I not only need guides, but also manpower to help me find the Dihua Yu Gui Vine. The more, the better,” Qin Sang said.</p><p>He mentally planned to familiarize himself with the Fengju Jade Gate's environment before Tianyue Shangren made his move, mapping out escape routes.</p><p>He also considered the worst-case scenario, preparing to explore the depths of the Fengju Jade Gate himself. If he were unfortunately targeted by a powerful figure, escaping the Fengju Jade Gate would be futile; he would have to flee into the depths of the Fengju Jade Gate and use the chaos to hide.</p><p>Concerning his life, Qin Sang didn't dare completely trust the information bought, even from the Five Elements Alliance; he needed to verify it himself.</p><p>Being outnumbered, Qin Sang planned to bring many people, spreading out under the guise of searching for the Dihua Yu Gui Vine, allowing them to scout the terrain and create an internal map.</p><p>This request further troubled Ruan.</p><p>“Forget it.  Tell me the names of those veteran powerhouses, I'll personally invite them. Also, use the Alliance's connections to keep an eye out, intercept anyone returning to the city before others hire them. And ask our people in the Alliance who wants to go to the Fengju Jade Gate; I'll pay them,” Qin Sang pondered, then said.</p><p>“As you command!”</p><p>Ruan bowed and withdrew, immediately carrying out Qin Sang's instructions.</p><p>Qin Sang soon received a list of individuals and forces.</p><p>These were veteran powerhouses who rose to prominence in the Jade Gate Pass; all suspected of gaining significant benefits in the Fengju Jade Gate, changing their destinies. Some were elusive, others openly established their dojos in the Jade Gate Pass.  Several names were specifically marked as possibly currently in secluded cultivation.</p><p>As for the forces, they included sects, clans, and various organizations—undeniably the local powerhouses of the Jade Gate Pass. No one knew the Fengju Jade Gate better than they did.</p><p>“Infiltrating one of these forces wouldn't be bad…”</p><p>Qin Sang mused.</p><p>As an Elder of the Five Elements Alliance, he held considerable value.  Requesting personnel assistance from them in his search would likely not be refused. After all, the Dihua Yu Gui Vine was a pretext; even if found, they could take it if they wished. His real goal was to familiarize himself with the Fengju Jade Gate.</p><p>But to utilize their strength, he would have to follow their lead and avoid joining forces that were too powerful, to prevent being controlled.</p><p>Unfortunately, I have too few people available!</p><p>Qin Sang pondered for a moment, left the Five Elements Alliance, and headed north towards Jade Gate Pass.</p><p>Jade Gate Pass's walls are not exactly north-south; the entire city is slanted.  Jade Gate Pass is a kind of point of Duizhou.  Going west or north will take one outside Duizhou's territory. Fengju Jade Gate is located to the northwest of Jade Gate Pass, with sandstorms constantly invading from the northwest, intercepted by the city's defenses.</p><p>Within the city, one can look up and see the fantastical sight of the sandstorms colliding with the city's protective formations.</p><p>Not far from the city, the air became humid, and a lake appeared before Qin Sang.</p><p>The lake water was shallow and clear, with lotus flowers blooming and lotus leaves like plates on the surface.</p><p>A large area around the lake was empty; no one dared to approach.  A light mist shrouded the lake, obscuring the far shore and lending it an air of mystery. This was partly due to the protective formations, and partly because the lake was the location of Qinglian Lake Sect's mountain gate.</p><p>Qinglian Lake was a small but well-known sect near Jade Gate Pass, its sect master a seasoned expert at the Nascent Soul stage.</p><p>The lotus flowers in the lake were not the same as the Sun King Lotuses of Liancheng, but their characteristics were very similar.  They were probably a special variety that Qinglian Lake had specifically sought out.</p><p>Qin Sang stopped his flight and walked towards a wooden bridge on the lakeshore. One end of the bridge reached the shore; the other connected to a lotus leaf, the only path into the lake.</p><p>As he approached, he heard the sound of water. A lotus leaf flipped over, and a fish eagle flew out, landing on the bridge railing. It shook its wings, its round eyes fixed on Qin Sang.  Opening its beak, it spoke in a soft, woman-like voice, "This is the entrance to Qinglian Lake Sect. Please state your name, esteemed guest."</p><p>"I am Qin Sang, a guest elder of the Five Elements Alliance. I have come to visit Sect Master Han of your esteemed sect. Please convey my regards."</p><p>Qin Sang offered his calling card.</p><p>"Please wait a moment, Elder Qin."</p><p>Upon hearing Qin Sang's identity, the fish eagle's expression turned serious. It took the calling card and immediately flew towards the center of the lake.</p><p>After a short while, the mist in the lake parted slowly. The lotus leaves moved spontaneously, forming a path of lotus leaves leading to the center of the lake. Several women, each wearing lotus-shaped ornaments, emerged gracefully from the mist, and together they performed a graceful bow. "Elder Qin, this way please!"</p><p>Entering Qinglian Lake with these women, Qin Sang met a woman in green robes in a wooden building at the lake's center.</p><p>The woman had an excellent bearing and stunning appearance, undoubtedly a Nascent Soul cultivator.</p><p>However, Qin Sang was somewhat suspicious because her appearance differed from the records of Sect Master Han.</p><p>With a sudden thought, Qin Sang bowed, "You must be Miss Ye, a high-achieving disciple of Sect Master Han. Congratulations on your breakthrough to the Nascent Soul stage. This is a great sign of prosperity for Qinglian Lake; Sect Master Han has a worthy successor!"</p><p>Originally, only Sect Master Han was a Nascent Soul cultivator in Qinglian Lake. Miss Ye, Sect Master Han's eldest disciple, had reached the Nascent Soul stage without the Five Elements Alliance's knowledge, presumably having achieved it recently.</p><p>Miss Ye smiled demurely.  "Elder Qin, you flatter me. It was merely fortunate luck.  I wonder what brings you to visit my master?"</p><p>"Oh?" Qin Sang glanced around. "Is Sect Master Han not in the sect? I heard that your sect was gathering people to go to Fengju Jade Gate; I also intended to go there, so I came to discuss the possibility of traveling together and supporting each other."</p><p>Miss Ye sighed.  "Elder Qin, you are a little late. My master left several days ago. If you had arrived a few days earlier, my master would certainly have gladly accepted such a skilled expert as yourself."</p><p>Qin Sang was surprised. Qinglian Lake had acted so discreetly that the Five Elements Alliance knew nothing about it.</p><p>"How long ago did Sect Master Han depart? Could I still catch up with her?"</p><p>Miss Ye shook her head. "My master didn't tell us which direction she was going. I can only give Elder Qin a written message; perhaps you can join forces with her later."</p><p>Qinglian Lake's caution suggests they may have discovered something at Fengju Jade Gate.</p><p>Having missed the opportunity because he arrived a few days late, Qin Sang had no choice but to say, "Then I would be grateful for Miss Ye's assistance."</p><p>After receiving Miss Ye's message, Qin Sang did not stay long. He left Qinglian Lake and continued to visit his next target.</p><p>Over the next few days, Qin Sang visited over a dozen factions and cultivators, making every effort.  While he didn't achieve his main goal, he did obtain two pieces of information about the interior of Fengju Jade Gate, a small victory.</p><p>One day, Qin Sang returned empty-handed to the Five Elements Alliance and found Supervisor Ruan waiting for him.</p><p>"What is it? Did you gather the people?" Qin Sang asked.</p><p>"Reporting to Elder Qin, I have been mobilizing connections and contacting various parties; there has been some progress."</p><p>A steward, Ruan, presented an iron token.  "This is a credential from the Hengsha Society.  The Hengsha Society is like a worldly gang, an alliance of independent cultivators operating around the Jade Gate Pass. Whether they are truly independent cultivators is debatable, but they are all exceptionally bold and powerful, frequently going in and out of the Fengju Jade Gate. They were hired out recently and only returned last night. They haven't located their employer yet, and I intercepted them."</p><p>"Having local connections certainly makes things easier," Qin Sang said, taking the token. "What are the Hengsha Society's demands?"</p><p>"The Hengsha Society includes many powerful cultivators, and they're quite well-known at the Jade Gate Pass, hence their considerable demands. They insist on meeting Elder Qin before they'll cooperate.  However, their highest-paying and most dangerous commissions in recent years have been those involving the Sword Pavilion. Aside from that, their demands shouldn't be unreasonable. Besides the Hengsha Society, I've also contacted some others. When will Elder Qin be available? I can summon them all then," Ruan the steward said respectfully.</p><p>"Well done. Send word, I will see them tonight," Qin Sang said. Noticing Ruan hadn't left, he added, "Is there anything else?"</p><p>"There is one more matter, also concerning the Fengju Jade Gate. Our League is renowned, and we frequently receive requests for crafting. Today, someone came seeking a master refiner to craft a treasure. Elder Qin is very busy and shouldn't be bothered, and even if Elder Hong were unavailable, I could contact several guest elders.  However, this request is unusual, so I sought Elder Qin's instructions first," the steward explained.</p><p>"Oh? What's so unusual?  Do they need someone to enter the Fengju Jade Gate with them?" Qin Sang asked, intrigued.</p><p>"Elder Qin is perceptive.  Indeed, they require a master refiner to enter the Fengju Jade Gate with them and craft the treasure *inside* the Jade Gate. This is extremely risky, and the other guest elders would likely refuse. But I thought, since Elder Qin is also going to the Fengju Jade Gate, and since these people seem influential and likely have significant resources, perhaps you could negotiate with them and utilize their manpower to help you search for the Dihua Jade Vine. That would save the trouble of finding people yourself.  Would Elder Qin be interested…?"</p><p>Ruan, being a capable steward of the Jade Gate branch, had thought this through thoroughly.</p><p>For Qin Sang, this was indeed a good option, so he asked, "What treasure do they want to refine, and where in the Fengju Jade Gate?"</p><p>Ruan replied, "I haven't had the chance to inquire in detail yet. The individual is still in the front hall and hasn't left. He calls himself Manager Luo, but he possesses the cultivation of a late-stage Nascent Soul cultivator. I'll bring him to you now."</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes flickered. A late-stage Nascent Soul cultivator serving as a manager? Could he be from a powerful clan?</p><p>Shortly after, Ruan brought in an elderly man.</p><p>"Elder Qin, this is Manager Luo."</p><p>Ruan bowed respectfully, then turned to Manager Luo, instructing him, "Manager Luo, this is Elder Qin, a master refiner. You're fortunate; the disturbances in the Fengju Jade Gate have made it difficult to contact our League's elders, who are rarely seen.  Elder Qin has just arrived at the Jade Gate, so you must seize this opportunity."</p><p>The elderly man, though white-haired, looked vigorous and composed. Stepping forward, he bowed deeply, "Greetings, Elder Qin."</p><p>Qin Sang sized up the man, noting his aristocratic air.  He simply grunted, "Where is your master? Why send only a manager? Don't hide anything from me. What treasure needs refining, and why must it be done within the Fengju Jade Gate?"</p><p>Manager Luo remained calm, bowing again, "Elder Qin, please forgive my presumptuousness, but might you please demonstrate your refining prowess before I reveal the truth?"</p><p>Before Qin Sang could respond, Ruan became agitated. "Why did I just tell you not to do this? Elder Qin is a guest elder of our League. How dare you question Elder Qin, question the Five Elements League!"</p><p>"I understand I'm being bold, but my master specifically instructed me that this is a crucial matter, allowing no negligence. The Fengju Jade Gate is unpredictable, and there's only one chance to refine the treasure. If we miss it, we'll regret it immensely.  I had to make this request," Manager Luo maintained his respectful posture but held firm.</p><p>Qin Sang smiled, stopping Ruan, and said playfully, "A treasure with only one chance to refine it? You've piqued my interest. If that's true, it's understandable. But how do you propose to verify my abilities?"</p>
