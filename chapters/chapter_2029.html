<h1>Chapter 2020: The Black Hole</h1><p>The meeting point was inside a stable illusory realm created by divine power.</p><p>Qin Sang arrived to find Young Master Xin and Steward Luo already waiting, along with several Xin family cultivators who had returned earlier.</p><p>Grand Protector Pei sat cross-legged on a nearby rock, his breath steady, in a meditative state. It was unclear whether he had been cultivating there continuously without leaving.</p><p>"Elder Qin, have you discovered anything?"</p><p>As soon as Qin Sang arrived, Steward Luo eagerly asked.</p><p>Qin Sang and Grand Protector Pei were the strongest cultivators present; only they could venture deeper.</p><p>Grand Protector Pei, proud of his status, was unwilling to undertake such a menial task as scouting ahead. They dared not urge him, so they could only hope for news from Qin Sang.</p><p>"Steward Luo," Young Master Xin softly interrupted, his tone devoid of any urgency.  He advised, "Elder Qin has just returned; he must need rest. Let's discuss once everyone is here."</p><p>"Young Master is right. I let my concern cloud my judgment. Please forgive me, Elder Qin," Steward Luo said apologetically.</p><p>"It's alright," Qin Sang, unconcerned with such a trifle, said frankly, "While I will keep an eye out for you, my primary goal is to find the Di Hua Yu Gui Teng.  I haven't found any place that has triggered unusual activity from the talisman fire in the past year."</p><p>Unknowingly, they had been in Feng Ju Jade Gate for a year, exploring only a small portion.  Aside from unexpectedly meeting Su Nu, they had made little progress.</p><p>Hearing this, Steward Luo was secretly disappointed, but knew there was no use in rushing. For high-level cultivators with long lifespans, a year was nothing.  Ten or eight years were normal for such a search.</p><p>Steward Luo invited Qin Sang to take a seat on the carriage, but Qin Sang looked at the Xin family cultivators beside it. These were Xin family cultivators at the Nascent Soul stage, who had previously led exploration teams and were now reporting back.</p><p>"Fellow Daoists, have you found any signs of the Di Hua Yu Gui Teng?" Qin Sang asked.</p><p>The cultivators looked at the carriage, each taking out a jade slip and presenting it to Qin Sang.</p><p>"Reporting to Elder Qin, we haven't found the Di Hua Yu Gui Teng. But as you instructed, we carefully explored each marked location and recorded our findings. Please have a look, Elder Qin."</p><p>Qin Sang accepted the jade slips, boarded the carriage, and sat behind the desk, examining them one by one.</p><p>These cultivators were conscientious; the records in the jade slips were very detailed, showing that they had explored thoroughly.  If they had fabricated the records, it would have been easily detectable by Qin Sang.</p><p>One location after another was eliminated by Qin Sang.</p><p>These places, so mysteriously and dangerously described in rumors, were in fact mostly exaggerated.  To low-level cultivators, they naturally seemed mysterious, and rumors often distorted the truth.  Most of these places were far less impressive than their reputations.</p><p>While Qin Sang examined the jade slips, others returned, finally Qu Zhen arrived with two Heng Sha Guild cultivators. Fortunately, the various exploration teams only suffered casualties due to accidents; there were no complete annihilations.</p><p>The news was all the same – nothing found, and they had to continue dividing their forces.</p><p>"From now on, everyone should explore deeper, step by step. It will become increasingly dangerous. Be careful and prioritize safety," Young Master Xin instructed.</p><p>"Yes!"</p><p>Everyone bowed in response, about to disperse, when Grand Protector Pei's eyelids fluttered, waking from his meditation. He said coldly, "These useless people, how long will it take to find anything? I don't want to waste my time on you. Give me some talisman papers!"</p><p>Seeing that Grand Protector Pei was willing to personally intervene, the Xin family master and servant were overjoyed and immediately presented a stack of talisman papers. "Thank you, Senior Pei."</p><p>Grand Protector Pei snorted, accepted the talisman papers, turned into a streak of white light, and disappeared into the depths of the void.</p><p>Qin Sang instructed the Heng Sha Guild to continue following his instructions, then took his leave from Young Master Xin. After flying for a while, he arrived at a vast, dark void. Suddenly halting his flight, he said calmly, "I wonder which fellow Daoist has been following me for so long. Why not reveal yourself and let's have a chat?"</p><p>"Elder Qin's spiritual perception is indeed sharp," A figure emerged from the darkness – it was Grand Protector Pei.</p><p>Qin Sang showed no surprise at seeing him and replied, "Because Grand Protector Pei didn't try to conceal your aura, I assume you have no ill intentions towards me. Otherwise, I would have already fled."</p><p>"Is that so? A respected Elder of the Five Elements League, surely not a coward?" Grand Protector Pei's eyes flashed with disbelief. "However, Elder Qin, you're right about one thing – I harbor no ill will towards you."</p><p>He looked towards the interior of Feng Ju Jade Gate, "This place is fraught with danger. Even in my memory, I've only been here three or five times, and my understanding is limited.  Perhaps we should cooperate. We can look out for each other, and according to rumors, the fragments of the ancient sword pavilion contain countless treasures. If we work together, we can share the spoils, each getting what we need. This Xin family matter is secondary. I made a promise to the previous Xin family patriarch, and I'm only doing this for the sake of politeness. Otherwise, I wouldn't bother."</p><p>"So that's how it is.  Pei Gongfeng is a man of utmost integrity!"</p><p>Qin Sang showed admiration, then sighed regretfully, "Unfortunately, in my eyes, nothing is more important than the Di Hua Jade Vine.  The Ancient Sword Pavilion and the Xin family matter are the same.  If we travel together, I fear it will delay Gongfeng's treasure hunt."</p><p>"Is that so?  It seems we are fated not to travel together, Elder Qin. I wish you success in your endeavor," Pei Gongfeng said with an ambiguous smile.</p><p>"Thank you for your kind words!"</p><p>Qin Sang bowed and flew away.</p><p>Watching Qin Sang's back, Pei Gongfeng's gaze grew cold.  He vanished in a flash, leaving behind a cold snort.</p><p>…</p><p>On the way to Su Nu's secluded location, Qin Sang was still pondering the relationship between Pei Gongfeng and the Xin family. Based on what he had seen and heard, it was not as simple as Pei Gongfeng had made it out to be.  However, he had no interest in finding out, nor did he intend to get involved, or take sides.  If a dispute arises, he would simply take advantage of the situation and withdraw.</p><p>Su Nu's secluded location was a valley, with flowing streams and lush greenery, a veritable paradise. It was hard to tell whether it was an illusion or real.</p><p>As soon as he entered the valley, Su Nu's voice echoed, "Qin Xiong, you're back?"</p><p>Qin Sang replied, secretly wondering why Su Nu's voice sounded strange.</p><p>Before he could finish, Su Nu emerged from a tree house in the forest.  Qin Sang was shocked.  Su Nu looked pale and frail, appearing like a ghost as she flew out, looking like a woman near death.</p><p>How much time had passed? What had happened?</p><p>"Forgive my appearance, Qin Xiong," Su Nu said apologetically and embarrassedly.  "I was ambushed by two enemies and sustained a lingering ailment that has not healed. While it doesn't usually affect me, I was worried it might hinder you when we explore the Sword Pavilion. I attempted a secret technique to resolve it, but underestimated its danger.  I almost went into demonic possession…"</p><p>Qin Sang sighed, unsure what to say.  Even a powerful cultivator could make such mistakes.  It only showed how strong-willed Su Nu was, unwilling to rely on others.  Strong individuals always possess their own pride.</p><p>"Are your injuries serious?"</p><p>Qin Sang examined Su Nu. Her breath was shallow. Even without demonic possession, her strength was surely diminished and her injuries worse.</p><p>"Fortunately, I realized it in time and stopped. I only lost some vital energy, but the ailment is mostly resolved.  I'll need to close myself off for a few years, and I'm afraid I won't be able to explore the Sword Pavilion with you during that time," Su Nu sighed.</p><p>"Don't worry, your recovery is the priority. The Sword Pavilion fragments have been there for ages; it won't make a difference if we wait a few years. I'll gather information and study the ancient prohibitions within the Sword Pavilion first. We can explore together once you're recovered."</p><p>Qin Sang reassured her.</p><p>"Thank you for your understanding, Qin Xiong," Su Nu produced a jade pendant. "I won't be able to focus while in seclusion. This jade is the key to the valley's formation.  You can use it to enter and exit as you please to rest."</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't refuse and accepted the jade pendant. Although Su Nu seemed unconcerned, he secretly decided to visit less often. No one wants visitors while recovering.</p><p>After a brief conversation, Qin Sang left without entering the valley.</p><p>After flying some distance, Qin Sang turned back, looking towards the valley, his brows furrowed. After a moment of contemplation, he shook his head and flew towards his destination.</p><p>Su Nu's seclusion was a good thing.  He no longer needed to find excuses to keep her away.</p><p>For Qin Sang, the most important thing was finding a way out, a matter of life and death.  He needed to keep his escape route a secret, even from Su Nu.</p><p>Regarding the Zi Wei Palace, Qin Sang was most concerned about the Tian Shan Mountain, where Bing Yao was sealed, and the teleportation array leading to the Seven Killing Hall.</p><p>This array was located in a Sword Path Hall.  Qin Sang remembered that a massive change occurred there during the appearance of the Immortal Palace, with countless peaks rising from the ground.  He wondered if this place had separated from the Zi Wei Palace. If he found the Sword Path Hall, he might be able to directly enter other Sword Pavilions.</p><p>While Su Nu was recovering, Qin Sang explored the Feng Ju Jade Gate, searching for Sword Pavilion fragments.  Mostly, he'd glance at them and move on if they weren't what he was looking for.</p><p>He then selected several locations from the records left by Qu Zhen and others, visiting them personally.  He was repeatedly disappointed.</p><p>Undeterred, Qin Sang relentlessly continued his search, venturing deeper into the Feng Ju Jade Gate.</p><p>One day, at the appointed time with Zhuque, Qin Sang emerged from the depths and arrived at the location, immediately hearing Zhuque's loud calls.</p><p>“You’re finally here! Come with me!”</p><p>Zhuque snatched Qin Sang's sleeve, eagerly pulling him forward.</p><p>Qin Sang looked around, noticing the absence of Huo Yu Centipede and the two high-ranking demons, and frowned. “Is there danger?”</p><p>Zhuque snorted, “What are you thinking! We found a good place.  One of the scouts died there; the centipede and others are guarding it.”</p><p>“Oh?”</p><p>Qin Sang became interested, enveloped Zhuque with his true energy, and sped towards the location Zhuque indicated.</p><p>They traversed dark voids and illusions, finally arriving at a place densely packed with illusions. These illusions were closely arranged, with little space between them, their conflicts more violent than elsewhere, daunting to behold.</p><p>This was still within the normal range, but as they approached their destination, anomalies appeared.</p><p>“How is it?  Anything strange?”</p><p>Zhuque raised its head proudly, “This Zhuque was the first to discover it!”</p><p>“You did well this time.”</p><p>Qin Sang offered praise.</p><p>He sensed an invisible force emanating outwards, subtle yet immensely powerful, distorting the surrounding illusions and causing conflicts.  The force was masked by the fluctuating clashes of illusions; only those with sharp spiritual senses could detect it.  Without Zhuque's warning, he might have overlooked it.</p><p>They continued deeper, finally reaching their destination and finding Luo Hou and the other demons. Only one captive remained.</p><p>“It's here!”</p><p>Zhuque pointed a wing towards the front; there was nothing but endless darkness.</p><p>Unlike the outer void, this was absolute blackness, devoid of light, like a dead space.</p><p>“There seems to be an invisible void ahead, constantly emitting a powerful suction. The captive hadn't gone far when he was suddenly sucked in; we couldn't save him…” Gui Hou said with lingering fear.</p><p>The scout was sucked away, instantly severing his connection with the imposed restriction; his survival was doubtful. A Nascent Soul cultivator, without any resistance, was swallowed by the darkness.  If not for the scouting stones, they might have suffered the same fate.</p><p>They tried various methods, but dared not approach too closely and called upon Qin Sang for assistance.</p><p>Listening to their descriptions, Qin Sang's eyes shone with spiritual light, focusing on the darkness.</p><p>In his vision, the darkness shifted; a corner of a massive outline gradually emerged.  It wasn't empty; a giant dark disc existed.  The disc rotated slowly, yet conveyed immense, unstoppable power.</p><p>The disc wasn't a physical object but a tremendously thick, constantly flowing force, a super strong suction creating substantial waves in the void. At the disc's center, as Gui Hou described, was a void, one that could swallow everything!</p><p>Strangely, the disc was remarkably stable, the void's force unusually calm. Would someone sucked into the void be instantly torn apart, or sent elsewhere?</p><p>Could it be a strange passage?</p><p>Zhuque, considering this, summoned Qin Sang. By exploring the void, they might find the best escape route.</p><p>However, the unknown ahead was daunting. Qin Sang became increasingly apprehensive; even he couldn’t guarantee escaping the suction if sucked in. Even if it were a passage, if it connected to a place even more dangerous than the void, such as the depths of Fengju Jade Gate, it would be suicidal.</p><p>“Master, should we send another one in to test?” Gui Hou brought forward the last captive.</p><p>The captive's eyes were vacant, his expression dull, without fear. Death would be a release for him.</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head.  A Nascent Soul cultivator would vanish instantly upon being caught by the suction, and this man's desire for death made him a useless test subject. He would have to go himself, or call upon another Void Refinement cultivator.</p><p>He moved slightly, cautiously approaching the dark disc, sensing the suction and observing changes in the void.</p>
