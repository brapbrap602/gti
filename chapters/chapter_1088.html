<h1>Chapter 1080: Sword Qi</h1><p>At the foot of Yitian Peak.</p><p>An unknown space.</p><p>Desolate and grim.</p><p>In the center of a high platform is a bottomless pit.  Ancient Human, Azure Dragon, and Divine Mark seals converge here, forming an indestructible barrier.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>A blood-red coffin rises from the pit.</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>A sound suddenly comes from the coffin, its lid rattling.</p><p>Instantly, the seals glow brightly, intricate runes flashing repeatedly.  However, some parts of the seal dim as soon as they appear, revealing extreme weakness.</p><p>The coffin shakes violently, its lid banging incessantly. The Ancient Demon's true form is within.</p><p>*Hum…*</p><p>The ancient seals are battered by the coffin, the weak points widening into cracks.</p><p>*Heh heh…*</p><p>A chilling laugh echoes from inside the coffin.</p><p>The sound is low, but unnervingly eerie in this place.</p><p>The coffin relentlessly rams the seals.</p><p>*Boom! Boom!*</p><p>Cracks appear in all three ancient seals, their restraining power greatly reduced, seemingly unable to contain the coffin.</p><p>“Heh heh… Ha ha…”</p><p>The laughter from within grows louder, filled with exhilaration and madness.</p><p>The coffin rises higher and higher.</p><p>“You dare!”</p><p>The laughter abruptly stops, replaced by a roar of furious rage.</p><p>A sudden change.</p><p>The space trembles violently, followed by an ethereal ripple and an overwhelming, razor-sharp force, like a sword qi.</p><p>This power originates from Yitian Peak.</p><p>At this moment, Yitian Peak outside is shaking violently, the entire mountain seeming to transform into a divine sword. This sword qi, sealed within Yitian Peak, is activated upon sensing the Ancient Demon's imminent escape.</p><p>The sword intent is unmatched in power. The sword qi descends from the heavens, aiming straight for the coffin!</p><p>“Aaah!”</p><p>The Ancient Demon roars in fury.</p><p>He had spent years plotting, finally manipulating others to weaken the seals from the outside, allowing him to break free. Unexpectedly, those who laid the trap had a hidden ace, a devastating sword qi.</p><p>*Clang!*</p><p>The coffin jolts violently. A hand emerges from a crack, clinging to the coffin.</p><p>The hand is withered, its shrunken skin clinging to bone, devoid of flesh, just skin over bones, like the hand of a corpse.</p><p>A torrent of demonic energy pours out, breaking through the seals.</p><p>Simultaneously, the coffin blazes with a blinding crimson light, a powerful suction force erupting.</p><p>Qin Sang and the others are caught in the blast, only Jiufeng Wang, being further from the ancient seals, uses her Celestial Phoenix feathers to escape this calamity.</p><p>The sword qi is even faster, arriving in an instant.</p><p>The withered hand recoils as if struck by lightning.</p><p>The coffin lid slams shut with a *bang*, the Ancient Demon's roar of frustration echoing within.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The sword qi strikes the coffin.</p><p>*Crack!*</p><p>Cracks appear on the coffin, its intense crimson light flaring, desperately resisting the sword qi.</p><p>*Bang! Bang! Bang!*</p><p>One figure after another falls into this space.</p><p>Jiao Long Wang, Da Wu Zhu, the Demon Lord, and others are all pulled in by the Ancient Demon.</p><p>This also includes Qingzhu and the Ancient Demon's fragmented soul.</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>Qin Sang crashes to the ground, feeling excruciating pain.</p><p>After putting Ya Gu into his Corpse Puppet Bag, before he can see his surroundings clearly, a glimpse reveals the Demon Lord and others nearby, chilling him to the bone.</p><p>Seeing the others, he doesn't just feel cold; he freezes.</p><p>The Ancient Demon, the Demon Lord, Lingzhuzi, Qingzhu, and the two Si Sheng Gong disciples who previously revealed their identities—all the masters who participated in the Yitian Peak battle are trapped here.</p><p>On one side, a woman and a cicada huddle together, vigilant, it is Da Wu Zhu and Fang Laomo.</p><p>On another, are two people he's never seen before, their auras as strong as the Demon Lord and the others, clearly masters of the same level.</p><p>Seeing the tortoise shell on the burly man's back, Qin Sang understands.  These two are probably transformed great demons brought in by Jiufeng Wang.</p><p>That explains why Jiufeng Wang was guarding outside the Zhenling Domain.</p><p>The Canglang Sea demon clan has so many top experts.</p><p>Among these people, at least Yuan Ying mid-peak cultivators, most are Grand Cultivators, three races' experts are almost all here.</p><p>Qin Sang gasps.</p><p>A single firefly is illuminated by numerous moons.</p><p>He lies on the ground, wishing he were a speck of dust.</p><p>Fortunately, he has two companions in misery.</p><p>The presence of Foundation Establishment cultivators here is unexpected to Qin Sang.</p><p>The young boy and girl tremble amidst the high-level cultivators, looking at Qin Sang with surprise and astonishment, scrutinizing him from head to toe.</p><p>The top experts, including Mo Zhu, reacted swiftly.  Upon realizing they’d fallen into an unknown space and sensing the pull disappear, they immediately dashed outwards, prioritizing escape from the danger.</p><p>However, as they moved, the bloody light erupting from the blood coffin instantly solidified into a crimson crystalline wall, like a barrier, trapping everyone inside.</p><p>Mo Zhu and the others attacked the wall with all their might, but it remained unyielding, causing their expressions to change drastically.</p><p>They turned, their gazes fixed on the blood coffin at the center of the space.</p><p>The sword energy and the blood coffin were locked in a stalemate, their fluctuating power causing everyone’s hearts to pound; it was far beyond the capabilities of ordinary mortals.</p><p>They had no time to concern themselves with Qin Sang and the other two.</p><p>"The blood coffin seals the ancient demon's true form! The demon nearly broke free, and the sword energy is likely another, unknown seal!"</p><p>Nangui Xianzi, possessing far greater knowledge of this place than the others, spoke gravely.</p><p>Her eyes flickered to the Great Shaman and the Jiao Long King, anger welling up within her. She knew the ancient demon’s near escape was certainly connected to these two factions; the ancient prohibitions of the three races had been compromised.</p><p>Not only the Witch Clan, but the Demon Clan had infiltrated as well.</p><p>The Four Saints had made extensive preparations in the inner hall, yet it was now riddled with vulnerabilities.</p><p>"Jiao Long King?  Your presence in the Inner Sea is quite unexpected,"</p><p>Lingzhuzi, recognizing the Jiao Long King, felt a surge of suspicion.</p><p>The Jiao Long King’s position among the Demon Sea's demon clan was second to none, comparable to himself and Mo Zhu; he was one of the few transformed great demons.  Their clans had frequently clashed with the demons in the Demon Sea, and they had engaged the Jiao Long King in numerous battles.</p><p>Since ancient times, only cultivators had controlled the teleportation formations; the Demon Sea demons couldn't enter the Inner Sea. The Jiao Long King’s presence was a deeply alarming sign.</p><p>The Jiao Long King slowly backed away, pressing against the crimson crystalline wall, offering a strained smile. "My good friends, it's been a while."</p><p>Aside from the two disciples of the Four Saints Palace, the cultivators present were all familiar faces.</p><p>His plan had been to retrieve the dragon corpse and throw the Canglang Sea cultivation world into chaos—a double victory.</p><p>But an unexpected change occurred at the last moment, trapping them as well, and worse, they were surrounded by enemies.</p><p>Jiu Ming Xuan Gui recognized the Four Saints Palace disciples and, noticing Nangui Xianzi’s murderous glare, hesitantly said, "Though I have a pact with you, I am not a member of the Four Saints Palace…"</p><p>He seemed to have some connection to the Four Saints Palace.</p><p>"Kill the ancient demon first!"</p><p>Nangui Xianzi glared fiercely at Jiu Ming Xuan Gui.</p><p>Deal with the ancient demon first, then settle the score with the Demon Clan.</p><p>The Jiao Long King, having dared to infiltrate the Inner Sea, would not be going back.</p>
