<h1>Chapter 818: The Ambush</h1><p>Through the strange light, Qin Sang witnessed a peculiar scene.</p><p>Before the protective spirit array, a single person was attacking, yet already held a dominant position, the strange light dissipating and the array teetering on the brink of collapse.  The attacker showed no urgency despite the slow progress.</p><p>However, a thick fog shrouded a large area at the foot of the mountain near the attacker, resembling sea mist rising at night. Within the fog, two shadowy figures were vaguely visible.</p><p>This was no ordinary fog; even the Sky-Eye Butterfly couldn't penetrate it, clearly a powerful illusionary array.  Qin Sang stared for a while before confirming the presence of two figures.  Hidden within the fog, they seemed busy, but not assisting in breaking the array.</p><p>Obscured by the mist, their identities and actions remained unclear.</p><p>Intrigued and sensing something amiss, Qin Sang attempted to have the Sky-Eye Butterfly fully activate its powers to observe the fog.</p><p>Inside the fog, the two individuals were working together on a formation plate.</p><p>One wore a black robe, the other gray, their faces concealed, their auras subtle and hidden. The plate floated between them, their hands resting upon it, channeling immense amounts of true energy into it, showing no sign of exhaustion.</p><p>As the true energy infused the plate, yellow light gathered in its center, soon transforming into a small triangular flag.</p><p>The gray-robed person pointed to the ground, and the triangular flag, with a slight tremor, shot towards the ground, silently disappearing beneath the surface.  </p><p>By this time, over a dozen flags had already been planted. A massive spirit array was gradually taking shape.</p><p>Just then, the gray-robed person seemed to sense something, abruptly turning towards the outside of Liangqiu Island, his gaze sharp as a hawk's.</p><p>"What is it?"  the other asked in a raspy voice.</p><p>"An interesting youngster," the gray-robed person replied nonchalantly, waving his hand, causing the fog to thicken. Their figures shimmered and completely vanished. "He must have simply passed by, drawn by the commotion, and was spying from afar. He's quite skilled, seemingly capable of seeing through the maze array. Fortunately, my spiritual senses are sharp, and he shouldn't have discovered anything."</p><p>"Didn't you say there were no strong cultivators nearby? What a coincidence," the black-robed person grumbled. "Luo Daotong sent a distress signal; by now, Old Master Yin probably knows and is rushing here.  Luo is Old Master Yin's favorite disciple, he can't ignore this. Hurry and set up the killing array; avoid any more complications and don't let Old Master Yin notice."</p><p>The gray-robed person nodded. "The maze array is still too weak… Don't worry, I've taken precautions. That kid won't see anything. If he dares to come to the island, let's deal with him first.  This is a killing array bestowed by the Sect Master himself, more than enough to capture Old Master Yin. Once it's set, even if Old Master Yin senses something amiss when he arrives, it will be too late; he won't escape."</p><p>Another triangular flag materialized as he spoke.</p><p>Meanwhile…</p><p>Far away, Qin Sang's expression changed drastically, his heart pounding.</p><p>Earlier, sensing something was wrong, he hadn't dared approach, only instructing the Sky-Eye Butterfly to fully utilize its powers to observe the fog.</p><p>Unexpectedly, just as he was about to see the figures in the fog, they suddenly disappeared, as if they had never existed, the previous images mere illusions.</p><p>Qin Sang keenly felt two gazes piercing through the fog, seeming to meet his own, like two heavy hammers, shaking his spirit.</p><p>"Something's wrong!"</p><p>Qin Sang's pupils constricted, immediately ordering the Sky-Eye Butterfly to cease its abilities.</p><p>He didn't believe the earlier sighting was an illusion; the fog certainly held a secret, and powerful cultivators were hidden there.</p><p>Had they noticed him?  To easily discover his observation and sever the Sky-Eye Butterfly's vision, what was their cultivation level?</p><p>Qin Sang had found it strange earlier, that the person attacking Luo Daotong was so unhurried.</p><p>Combined with his current discovery, Qin Sang felt a sudden warning. These people hiding on Liangqiu Island, not attacking Luo Daotong directly, suggested their target wasn't him.</p><p>At that moment, Liangqiu Island felt like a dragon's lair, raising the hairs on Qin Sang's arms.</p><p>Better safe than sorry.</p><p>He dared not linger, and turned to leave.</p><p>In the fog, the gray-robed person let out a soft hum, turning again towards the island's edge.</p><p>"That kid ran. So decisive. Did he really see something? It shouldn't be. He probably just discovered the maze array."</p><p>The cloaked figures exchanged words.  “If our identities are discovered, and trouble comes to the sect, how will we answer to the Sect Master?” the man in black sneered.</p><p>The man in grey chuckled. “This killing array is the Sect Master’s latest creation, and we’ve carefully concealed our identities. A junior wouldn't easily see through it.  Oh well, the array isn't complete yet; we can't leave the island just yet. Let's send another spirit servant…”</p><p>He reached into his robes and produced a gourd.  It was unremarkable, a yellow gourd with scars, indistinguishable from a common one.  He opened the lid, tilting it. A pale light flashed, and a small, frail woman materialized before them.  She was a spirit, her form ethereal and translucent.</p><p>The man in grey whispered a few instructions, then barked, “Go! Be quick, kill that junior.  Anyone of the Golden Core stage or above who dares to approach within three miles of Liangqiu Island—kill them. But don't kill innocents; otherwise, I’ll deprive you of your blood essence for ten years.”</p><p>The woman’s face lit up with fervent zeal. She bowed to the grey-robed man and vanished.</p><p>The man in black watched the man struggling with the protective array, then chuckled. “Your soul refinement techniques are becoming increasingly refined. These two spirit servants must be at the peak of the Golden Core stage, right? Who would have thought that an elder of the Heavenly Dao Sect, the leading righteous sect, would have such profound mastery of necromancy?”</p><p>The grey-robed man responded calmly, “Soul refinement is merely a minor art; it doesn’t benefit one's cultivation. My cultivation remains stagnant; the necromantic path is a dead end as well.  The spirit servants themselves aren't particularly strong, but they have unique abilities and are elusive.  Ordinary cultivators can't handle them, which makes them seem formidable.  However, they’re extremely difficult to create. I’ve spent so long refining these two, and I’ve reached my limit.  I can’t make them reach the Nascent Soul stage, so I’ve given up. With our cultivation levels, what use are more of these spirit servants?”</p><p>“True, cultivation is paramount.” The man in black nodded, saying nothing more.</p><p>Silence fell over Liangqiu Island once more.  As the two men poured their energy into the array, the array discs spun faster and faster, the killing array almost engulfing the entire island, like a monstrous beast poised to devour any who dared to land.</p><p>Luo Daotong, inside the protective array, remained unaware of all this. He was frantic, waiting for rescue. The enemy was strong and their methods were uncanny; they repeatedly found weaknesses in the protective array, putting him in grave danger.</p>
