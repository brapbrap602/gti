<h1>Chapter 1748: Troops and Horses</h1><p>Bailong Ferry was in complete chaos at this moment. Although the River God Temple was built outside the ferry, it wasn’t far from the dock. Standing on the dock, one could clearly see what was happening there. The deceased held a significant position in the area, and the funeral procession was grand, drawing many onlookers. When the corpse transformation occurred, screams erupted from the ferry.</p><p>The green-haired zombie burst out of the wooden coffin, releasing a foul stench that spread with the river wind, making people gag. It lunged toward a middle-aged man dressed in mourning clothes—the eldest son of the deceased. The man had been kneeling closest to the coffin during the Taoist priest’s ritual. When he hastily stood up, his legs were numb, causing him to stumble and fall behind as he tried to escape.</p><p>Despite being the zombie’s blood relative, the green-haired zombie showed no recognition, driven only by its hunger for flesh. It let out a metallic screech, its green eyes glowing with malice, its nails elongated and blackened, clearly tainted with corpse poison. The man, a mere mortal, would surely die on the spot if those nails pierced him.</p><p>The paper effigies and incense stands were trampled and scattered, covered in mud and unrecognizable. The man, terrified and clumsy, tripped and fell into the pile of paper effigies. In desperation, he cried out, “Father! It’s me, your son!” His voice trembled with fear, hoping to awaken any remaining shred of his father’s consciousness. Behind him, women wailed for their master, held back by others.</p><p>Everyone was filled with terror. The funeral had been scheduled for an auspicious time calculated by the Taoist priest, but it was rushed because the corpse had shown signs of abnormality. The night before, the family had noticed the corpse’s face turning green with fangs, so they hastily invited the priest to chant soul-calming incantations and drove seven-star corpse-suppressing nails into the coffin, believing that honoring the White Dragon Lord would prevent the corpse from transforming. Yet, before the ritual could be completed, the corpse had already turned into a zombie.</p><p>The stench overwhelmed the man, and as the corpse miasma hit him, he lost consciousness and collapsed, powerless. Just as the zombie was about to pounce on him, a faint light emanated from the River God Temple. The characters on the White Dragon Lord’s altar flickered, and the sound of rushing water echoed from within the temple, as if it had transformed into a deep pool.</p><p>Qin Sang, observing the temple, was surprised. Although his spiritual sense was restricted, he had noticed the temple earlier when he disembarked. It had seemed like an ordinary stone temple with no trace of spiritual energy. But now, it had suddenly come to life, and a surge of spiritual power descended upon the altar out of nowhere.</p><p>Qin Sang’s gaze shifted to the fleeing Taoist priest. The priest, being the most alert and physically strong, had been the first to react. He wasn’t fleeing in panic but was shaking a golden bell while throwing out a yellow talisman inscribed with cinnabar. The talisman ignited on its own, turning into a fireball that floated down with the urgent ringing of the bell.</p><p>After the talisman was lit, the temple underwent a transformation. A ripple of water energy shot out, forming a white chain wrapped in mist. The chain, clearly a manifestation of spiritual power, shot toward the green-haired zombie.</p><p>With a whoosh, the chain pierced the zombie’s collarbone and wrapped around its body like a serpent. The zombie, driven by instinct and lacking higher intelligence, barely resisted as the chain bound it tightly. It roared in anger, seemingly unaffected by the wound, and tried to grab the chain with its iron-like hands, but the chain, made of spiritual energy and coated in mist, was too slippery to hold.</p><p>With a few more whooshes, the chain bound the zombie’s limbs, dragging it back toward the temple. The zombie’s face was now inches away from the man’s, who fainted at the sight of its glowing green eyes. The zombie, still roaring and struggling, was dragged to the front of the temple, leaving deep grooves in the ground.</p><p>Qin Sang, however, was watching the river. Suddenly, waves began to rise on the river’s surface. Shortly after the temple’s divine intervention, Qin Sang sensed two auras rapidly approaching from downstream. Using the Heavenly Eye Butterfly’s vision, he saw two crab demons—one green and one black. The black crab had massive pincers, each as large as its body, while the green crab was smaller but still formidable.</p><p>As the crabs swam toward the temple, a thick fog enveloped the river. A white dragon emerged from the water, its massive eyes scanning the ferry before locking onto the zombie bound in front of the temple. The dragon swooped down, grabbed the zombie with its claws, and flew back into the river.</p><p>After the dragon took the zombie, the temple returned to normal, with no trace of spiritual energy remaining on the altar.</p><p>“The Dragon Lord has shown his divine power!” the people at the ferry exclaimed, kneeling and kowtowing to the temple in reverence.</p><p>Qin Sang, however, saw through the illusion. There was no Dragon Lord—it was the two crab demons using their abilities to create the spectacle. The “white dragon” was actually the crab demons in disguise, their pincers acting as the dragon’s claws, firmly gripping the zombie.</p><p>The mortals, unable to see the truth, believed the white dragon was the White Dragon Lord. The crab demons, satisfied with their display, prepared to return to the river. But they failed to notice the black glint in the zombie’s green eyes.</p><p>With a sudden roar, the zombie’s body tensed, and it let out a howl like a wolf. Its bones crackled like thunder as it spewed a cloud of black smoke. The smoke corroded the spiritual chain, causing it to shatter into pieces.</p><p>The crab demons were stunned. Before they could react, a tremendous force struck their pincers. With two loud cracks, the “white dragon” convulsed and dissolved into mist, leaving behind the broken pincers and demon blood staining the river.</p><p>The shore fell silent. The people, who had just been praising the Dragon Lord for capturing the evil, were now terrified. “Could it be that the Dragon Lord is no match for the zombie?” they wondered in panic.</p><p>The next moment, the two giant crabs plummeted into the river, trying to escape. But the zombie, now capable of flight, caught up with the black crab in a cloud of black smoke. With a forceful thrust, its fingers pierced the crab’s hard shell, cracking it open.</p><p>The zombie roared, ready to kill and feast on the crab. But suddenly, a massive wave rose on the river, and a white figure emerged—a white flood dragon. Seeing its subordinate in danger, the flood dragon shot a water arrow toward the zombie’s forehead.</p><p>The zombie, now more intelligent, looked up and spewed corpse miasma at the arrow. But the flood dragon’s power far surpassed that of the crab demons. The water arrow pierced through the miasma and struck the zombie’s forehead.</p><p>“Is this the River God, the White Dragon Lord?” Qin Sang thought, observing the flood dragon closely. He could tell it was a demonic beast, not a deity. The flood dragon, at the demon spirit stage, had unusually high intelligence for its kind, its eyes gleaming with human-like awareness.</p><p>What intrigued Qin Sang the most was the flood dragon’s calm and balanced aura, devoid of any ferocity.</p><p>The flood dragon’s attack succeeded, but it didn’t kill the zombie outright. It seemed puzzled by the zombie’s strength, considering it had just transformed and hadn’t cultivated in a yin-gathering location. The flood dragon conjured a set of shackles to restrain the zombie and prepared to drag it and its injured subordinates back into the river.</p><p>Just then, a cannon shot rang out from the riverside, and a thick cloud of black smoke rose, revealing a three-tiered altar. The smoke split into three streams, rapidly encircling the flood dragon.</p><p>A shrill voice echoed from the central smoke, “Minions, follow me to skin this scaled beast and raid the city god’s water palace! Let’s feast!”</p><p>Excited howls erupted from the three streams of smoke, filling the air with a menacing aura. The sky above Bailong Ferry was shrouded in black smoke, as if countless demons were descending.</p><p>The mortals were terrified. Qin Sang, however, was surprised. The black smoke concealed three groups of wolf demons. The flanks were composed of white wolves, while the center was led by a massive black wolf, standing as tall as a two-story building. The black wolf could speak human language, and its troops moved with military precision, clearly well-trained.</p><p>Qin Sang had sensed a presence in the riverside grass earlier, but only one. Where had so many demon soldiers come from?</p><p>The black wolf was cautious. The white wolves flanked the flood dragon, blocking its escape routes upstream and downstream, while the black wolf led its troops straight for the flood dragon.</p><p>Surrounded on three sides, the flood dragon panicked. It had come alone to investigate, with its troops still behind. How could it face this pack of wolf demons alone? The zombie had been a trap to lure it out!</p><p>In desperation, the flood dragon let out a deafening roar, shaking the river as it tried to flee into the depths. The black wolf laughed mockingly and spat out a beam of black light. Its troops followed suit, their beams converging into a black cloud. Three beams shot toward the flood dragon—one aimed at its neck, one at its belly, and one at its tail.</p><p>At that moment, waves surged downstream, and a formation of demon soldiers approached, their banners fluttering. These were the flood dragon’s troops—shrimp soldiers, crab generals, and fish demons. The city god’s temple in Fulong City had also received the flood dragon’s distress signal and emitted a radiant light.</p><p>Seeing the reinforcements, the black wolf wasn’t alarmed but delighted. It calmly ordered its white wolf troops to intercept the flood dragon’s forces while continuing to control the black beams. No matter how the flood dragon dodged, it couldn’t escape. The three beams transformed into three black hoops, tightly binding the flood dragon’s head, body, and tail.</p><p>The black wolf laughed maniacally. “Minions, break their formation!” It knew that capturing the flood dragon would demoralize its troops, leaving them easy prey. Then, it could focus on dealing with the city god.</p><p>The black wolf stopped laughing and glared at the struggling flood dragon, baring its fangs as it prepared to pounce.</p><p>Suddenly, a sharp cry rang in its ears.</p><p>On the opposite bank of the river, a lone peak suddenly emitted a streak of light. A graceful woman with a high bun, dressed in Taoist robes, flew across the river. A flash of green light enveloped her, and she was clad in ceremonial attire. She wore a seven-star crown, a rhinoceros-horn hairpin, and a light yellow robe adorned with three-colored clouds. A bronze pendant hung at her waist, and she wore black boots.</p><p>Beneath her, a translucent altar appeared, shimmering like starlight. The altar had three tiers, symbolizing the three realms, with four pillars representing heaven, earth, sun, and moon, and eight gates for the ten directions. A small seal, inscribed with the words “Proclamation to All Spirits,” floated within the altar, radiating spiritual light.</p><p>As the altar formed, the woman stood atop it, chanting a spell: “Heaven is clear, earth is bright; soldiers follow orders, generals heed commands.”</p><p>With her chant, the seal trembled, and two gates on the altar opened. The sound of rushing water and thunder echoed as two columns of silver mist emerged, revealing two rows of silver-scaled water snakes. These snake soldiers, clad in armor, were far more disciplined than the flood dragon’s troops or the wolf demons.</p><p>The wolf demons, though orderly, paled in comparison to the snake soldiers, who moved like celestial troops, sealing off the river.</p><p>“The Proclamation to All Spirits Seal!” the black wolf exclaimed in shock. “Who are you from the Celestial Pivot Court?”</p><p>“I am the ninth altar master of the Mystic Response True Altar,” the woman declared, her eyes sharp. “How dare you harm the river god under my jurisdiction!”</p><p></p>
