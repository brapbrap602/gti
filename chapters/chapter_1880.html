Chapter 1871: Turmoil


“Hahahahaha……”
The White-Robed Demon King’s maniacal laughter echoed through the Governance Platform as his dragon tail swept away the twenty-four fragments of the Heavenly Prison Map, along with the assembled demons.
A complex mix of emotions churned within the hearts of the True Cultivators. Yet, they couldn't afford to dwell on them. The storm generated by the dragon tail was relentlessly devouring one illusory realm after another.
They witnessed firsthand the realms they had just traversed being consumed by the storm.  The once-peaceful landscapes were torn asunder, the fragments ruthlessly swept into the maelstrom, which then surged forward with even greater momentum, crashing into other illusory realms.
The storm was a harbinger of death; falling behind even a single step meant utter destruction.
Above the Governance Platform.
Golden light pulsed from the massive hole in the heart of the auspicious clouds as the dragon tail finally withdrew from the platform.
‘Swish!’
The dragon tail vanished into the clouds like a fleeting phantom, impossible to follow with the naked eye.  Then, a streak of golden radiance shot away through the clouds at incredible speed.
The sea of clouds roiled, accompanied by thunder and wind.
From beginning to end, no one caught a glimpse of the Demon Saint's true form.
From the moment the dragon tail pierced the Governance Platform to the moment it seized the map fragments, the entire process occurred in the blink of an eye.
Meanwhile, the bronze bell was blocked by black wings, and the Star Jade Talisman was trapped within a domain of lightning.
‘Ding ling ling…’
The bell’s ringing grew increasingly frantic.
Rings of sonic waves erupted from the bell, densely interwoven, resembling undulating waves of primordial energy floating in the void, surging towards the black wings.
There were no crashing waves, only layer upon layer of sound waves, seemingly gentle in their advance. Yet, as they expanded, an astonishing power accumulated within them.
‘Boom! Boom! Boom!’
The sonic waves repeatedly slammed against the black wings.  The wings, however, were unyielding, their downward pressure irresistible, like the collapse of the heavens.
The impact reverberated with earth-shattering force, a direct clash between a Daoist True Monarch and a Body Integration stage monstrous beast.
The feathers on the surface of the black wings lost their smoothness, becoming dishevelled.  A yellow radiance diffused across their surface, gradually spreading over the wings and then the entire body of the beast, finally revealing its full form.
A pair of wings unfurled between the vast heaven and earth, blotting out the sky as the beast swooped down from beyond the heavens.
It was a hawk-like monstrosity, its eyes like suns and moons, radiating a chilling ferocity.
But no earthly hawk could possess such a colossal form. Anyone who laid eyes upon this beast would recall the legends of the Daoist scriptures, the Great Peng that soared above the clouds and carried the azure sky upon its back.
The bronze bell itself was no larger than a single feather of the beast, yet the yellow sonic waves it emitted enveloped the entire monstrosity.
The tiny mouth of the bell faced the beast, the source of the sonic waves.  The waves formed a net, threatening to engulf the colossal creature.
On another battlefield.
The Star Jade Talisman was trapped deep within the domain of lightning.
Grey thunderbolts rained down, furiously striking the talisman, but upon impact, it was as if they struck empty air, even the thunderclaps becoming muffled.
At the heart of the lightning domain, the talisman had vanished, replaced by a cluster of starlight.
The starlight wasn't concentrated but scattered, the darkness of the night sky between each point of light.
Now, this starry expanse was expanding.  Unlike the illusory starry sky that had appeared before, these stars were real, existing on a single plane – a star chart.
The talisman had transformed into a star chart.
As the star chart unfolded, grey thunderbolts continuously bombarded the stars, shattering them, but failing to destroy the chart itself.  The thunder sounded dull, as if striking an endless void.
Finally, the star chart surpassed the boundaries of the lightning domain, continuing to expand, until the lightning domain itself became a part of the star sea.
Soon, the star chart encompassed the bronze bell, reducing it to an insignificant yellow star.
The stars within the chart were now countless times brighter than before, hanging in the sky, forming a true starry expanse.
Night descended upon this world.
Before, when the beast’s wings had blotted out the sky, they had also brought darkness, but people could discern the difference, feeling only fear.
Now, if the star chart remained unchanged, people wouldn't question it, believing night had truly fallen.
Beneath the starry sky, a figure cloaked in starlight slowly coalesced.
Its form was ethereal, clad in a star robe, its appearance identical to the Daoist within the Golden Hall of the Zhongmao Governance Platform.
As the Daoist’s phantom solidified, the star chart’s expansion accelerated, instantly engulfing the black-winged beast within the star sea.
The Daoist pointed a finger at the void.
‘Swish! Swish! Swish!’
Starlight shot out from the stars, the beams interconnecting, the star chart transforming into a celestial net, attempting to ensnare both beasts with its own power.
‘Screech!’
Enraged, the monstrous beast let out a sharp cry, its wings beating violently as it slammed against the star chart.
Seizing this opportunity, the bronze bell withdrew its sonic waves, trembling slightly as it transformed into a streak of red light, passing over the beast and shooting towards the Demon Saint.
By now, the dragon tail had vanished into the clouds.
The dark clouds receded like a tide, the red light and golden radiance chasing each other across the sky before disappearing beyond the horizon.
The Daoist’s figure stirred, as if to step out of the star sea, but then paused.
The two beasts clearly wouldn't be so easily trapped. Moreover, the Daoist couldn't be certain whether they would pursue him or attack the Daoist cultivators below.
If a Saint-level beast were to break into their ranks, the consequences would be disastrous.
Looking beyond the Governance Platform, smoke and dust billowed in the distance, where a tide of beasts had formed.
Deeper within the Sinful Wasteland, the Daoist sensed other obscure presences, growing restless.
The Ghost Fang Kingdom's decision to beat the Demon Summoning Drum here was undoubtedly a risky move. If it backfired, the Daoist sects would suffer heavy losses, and even the Ghost Fang Kingdom wouldn't escape unscathed.
Gazing towards the horizon, the Daoist frowned.
……
The Governance Platform was in unprecedented chaos.
Here, even Nascent Soul cultivators were like ants, streaks of escaping light flitting through the endless illusory realms.
Some fled frantically, some went against the flow, while others waited and watched, searching for refuge.
One streak of lightning sped towards Qin Sang’s cave dwelling.
After Zuo Zhenren’s departure, Qin Sang had also departed immediately, not following Zuo Zhenren, but returning to his cave dwelling with utmost haste.
“That was a Demon Saint, wasn’t it…”
The image of the dragon tail was seared into his mind, lingering.
Coupled with Zuo Zhenren's behaviour, the truth was self-evident.
“I don’t know what the situation outside the Governance Platform is. Since a Demon Saint personally intervened, Daoist True Monarchs must have also appeared…  A single strike and then retreat.  Could it be that the Divine Court has already fallen into the hands of the Demon Saint?”
A wave of unease washed over Qin Sang.
He wasn't a member of the Daoist sects, yet he relied on the Dharma of this world to establish himself. If the Daoist sects were defeated and lost the Divine Court, wouldn't his path of cultivation fall under the control of the demons?
Before this, Qin Sang hadn't realised the significance of this battle, its far-reaching implications.
Moreover, the battle's impact on him wasn't limited to this.
Qin Sang turned his gaze towards the depths of the Governance Platform. If he wasn't mistaken, the dragon tail’s target was the place Zuo Zhenren had mentioned earlier, not far from the Crimson Gold Spirit Needle.  The needle had likely been swept into the storm.
It was difficult to predict what impact this battle would have on the passage between the two worlds.  His plans to return home were now in jeopardy.
However, these were matters for later.  His immediate priority was the Flower Spirit in his cave dwelling.
No matter what, the Flower Spirit couldn't be destroyed again.
‘Whoosh!’
His escaping light passed through the barrier and stopped above the flower field formation.
Qin Sang scanned the flower field, seeing the Flower Spirit swaying. The dragon tail's impact on the Governance Platform had already sent ripples through the area.
His expression was grave, thoughts racing through his mind. He hesitated for a moment, not immediately moving the Flower Spirit, deciding to observe the situation further.
A single strike from a Demon Saint shouldn’t destabilise the entire Governance Platform, unless the Daoist True Monarch and the Demon Saint continued their battle within the platform.
Perhaps his cave dwelling still had a chance of survival.
Leaving now, being swept into a battlefield between Body Integration stage powerhouses, might not be any safer than staying here. The Governance Platform served as a barrier.
Qin Sang hovered above the flower field, his attention focused on the depths of the Governance Platform, carefully sensing the fluctuations of the illusory storm, occasionally glancing upwards at the sky.
He remained tense, ready to take the Flower Spirit away at a moment's notice.
The storm intensified.
Illusory realms were constantly devoured, the storm relentlessly expanding.
Qin Sang's cave dwelling hadn't been directly affected yet, but the fluctuations he sensed grew stronger and stronger.
Soon, even areas untouched by the main body of the storm were greatly affected. Illusory realms everywhere were shaken to their foundations, strange phenomena appearing, much like when the golden light had erupted.
A rumbling sound echoed from beneath Qin Sang’s feet, caused by the vibrations of the flower field formation.
As time passed, the tremors intensified, and Qin Sang entered the formation, his eyes gleaming as if calculating something.
“It seems… the storm’s expansion is slowing down…”
Qin Sang murmured.
It appeared the long-maintained balance of the Governance Platform wasn't so fragile after all.  The remnants of ancient divine abilities, stable for countless years, could also resist the storm to a certain extent.
Once it reached a certain limit, the storm would stop expanding. A turning point had appeared.
However, Qin Sang wasn’t sure where that limit lay.
The assault on the formation continued to strengthen.  Even with Qin Sang reinforcing it, he couldn't stabilise the flower field.
“Not good!”
A thought struck Qin Sang. He flashed into the flower field's aperture and, as expected, found the poisonous fruit within trembling violently.
The poison-gathering formation within the aperture had been added later, cleverly integrated into the flower field formation.  With the main formation under attack, the poisonous fruit couldn't escape the effects.
If this continued, the remaining pulp would likely be destroyed.
Qin Sang had no choice but to divert part of his attention to the poisonous fruit while continuing to maintain the main formation outside.
‘Rumble… rumble… rumble…’
The storm’s expansion slowed significantly.
However, the poison-gathering formation could no longer hold.  Qin Sang flashed back into the aperture, sighed softly, and plucked the poisonous fruit, storing it in a jade bottle.
Transplanting the Flower Spirit required a long recovery period, and this pulp could sustain his breakthrough to the late Nascent Soul stage. It couldn't be destroyed here.
With the poisonous fruit removed, the poison-gathering formation immediately destabilised.  Due to their interconnected energies, the flower field formation was also affected, a small but significant flaw appearing, adding to his woes.
Qin Sang struggled to maintain the formation, enduring wave after wave of impact. He watched as the Flower Spirit below swayed precariously, some parts already showing signs of wilting, his heart aching.
……
While Qin Sang protected his cave dwelling, the old Daoist and the others were fleeing for their lives.
Along the way, they had consumed countless precious talismans and treasures.
Finally, they encountered their first fellow Daoist.
“Lei Zhenren!”
The Purple-Robed True Cultivator called out, his voice filled with relief.
Having just endured a fierce battle while protecting so many juniors, they were already exhausted.  Finally, reinforcements had arrived.
The newcomer was a refined-looking young man, seemingly in his twenties, with a short beard and an air of distinction.
Seeing the old Daoist and the others, Lei Zhenren visibly relaxed.  With a wave of his hand, he unleashed over a dozen talismans.  Talismanic light showered the group, and they were propelled forward, their speed greatly increasing.
“Where are the others?”
After joining forces, the Purple-Robed True Cultivator asked, seeing that Lei Zhenren was alone.
“This humble Daoist hasn’t encountered any other fellow Daoists. As for the juniors, they are all waiting behind…”
As he spoke, Lei Zhenren took control of the flying platform, merging into the formation to share the burden with the four Grand True Cultivators.
Gradually, more and more Grand True Cultivators arrived to reinforce them.  Finally, Zuo Zhenren also appeared.
With their combined efforts, the pressure eased considerably, and the storm’s expansion continued to slow.
Finally, the True Cultivators stopped, looking back at the path they had taken.
From their current position, they could see a dark and chaotic storm with the naked eye, devouring everything in its path.  Within it, no trace of any illusory realm remained.
Zuo Zhenren and the others now knew the truth.
Gazing at the storm, the True Cultivators fell into a long silence.
“The emergence of the Divine Court… was it real or fake?”
Lei Zhenren’s expression was dazed, his voice a murmur, his face filled with unwillingness.  “Was it truly… just bait laid by the Ghost Fang Kingdom?”
The True Cultivators remained silent.
They all understood the significance of the Divine Court’s return.  To have hope rekindled only to be extinguished was difficult to accept, even with their strong will.
Even if the demons had claimed half of the Divine Court, it would have been better than this.
“A century ago, the disturbance in the Governance Platform, was it just an ordinary tremor?”  Ruoquan Zhenren’s brows furrowed slightly as she looked at the old Daoist.
Devising a plan wasn't difficult; the challenge lay in convincing the Daoist Court and the True Monarchs that the Divine Court had truly emerged.
The Ghost Fang Kingdom’s scheme must have been years in the making, but it could be deduced that it began with that disturbance in the Governance Platform.
If it were merely an ordinary tremor, no matter how realistic the Divine Court’s decree, it would have been difficult to make the Daoist Court gamble everything, wouldn't it?
The old Daoist remained silent.
No one could answer Ruoquan Zhenren’s question.
They could hear the unwillingness in her voice.  They, too, wished that the Jushan Governance Platform held some unknown secret, rather than being part of a mere conspiracy.
After a while, the Purple-Robed True Cultivator sighed softly. “We lost the twenty-four fragments of the Heavenly Prison Map.  I don't know how we will explain this to our fellow Daoists in the Yintian Palace.”
Upon hearing these words, everyone glanced cautiously at the old Daoist.
Perhaps out of guilt and unease, the old Daoist remained tight-lipped, his face tense.
The Purple-Robed True Cultivator's words were intended to share the blame for the loss of the treasure.
Someone muttered, “For the Yintian Palace, it may not be a bad thing. The Ghost Fang Kingdom plotted for over a century, multiple Demon Kings severing their own cultivation, and the illusion of the Divine Court’s emergence was so realistic. It’s clear the Demon Saint was determined to obtain the Heavenly Prison Map fragments. Even if we hadn’t brought them here, they surely had other means to lure away the two True Monarchs… Once the Demon Saint personally attacks Crane Cry Mountain, they might lose more than just the map fragments.”
Despite these words, the True Cultivators knew this could only be said amongst themselves and couldn't be used to appease the Yintian Palace.
“The True Monarch will surely compensate the Yintian Palace for their loss. I wonder how the battle is progressing outside. We cannot linger here. Let’s leave quickly. We can still slay some demons and atone for our mistakes!”
Zuo Zhenren added.
The True Cultivators nodded in agreement, no longer hesitating as they summoned their escaping lights and flew towards the exit of the Governance Platform.
