<h1>Chapter 749: The Purple Mist Forbidden Zone</h1><p>The group continued their journey, traveling upstream along the Purple River.</p><p>As they drew closer to the Purple Mist Forbidden Zone, they could vaguely see purple light flickering within the depths of the shadowy jungle.</p><p>Suddenly, Xiang Yi, who was walking at the front, abruptly raised his hand and looked towards the Purple River with a grave expression.</p><p>Everyone's hearts skipped a beat as they stopped in unison.</p><p>The next moment, a huge splash erupted from the center of the river. A dark figure leaped out of the water and vanished before anyone could get a clear look at it.</p><p>"Not good!"</p><p>"Get out of the way!"</p><p>……</p><p>The group cried out in alarm, scattering in all directions.</p><p>Red light flickered around Qin Sang.  Just as he was about to activate a talisman to retreat, he suddenly had a bad feeling. Without hesitation, he patted the Corpse Puppet Pouch at his waist, summoning the Skyfiend Yaksha.</p><p>*Thump!*</p><p>A muffled sound echoed.</p><p>The Skyfiend Yaksha was sent flying, crashing heavily into a tree.</p><p>The baleful aura surrounding it dispersed, and its chest was deeply caved in. Fortunately, the Yaksha’s physical body was robust, preventing it from being torn apart by the blow.</p><p>If anyone else present had taken that hit directly, the outcome would likely have been dire.</p><p>Only after the Skyfiend Yaksha was knocked away did the attacker reveal itself. It was a monstrous fish, resembling a crocodile in shape, but with limbs and a tail that seemed to be pieced together from various demonic beasts, giving it a truly ferocious appearance.</p><p>Qin Sang seized the opportunity to escape, reaching the Skyfiend Yaksha's side to check its injuries. He discovered that the Yaksha’s chest had been pierced through.</p><p>Cui Ji looked over with a hint of schadenfreude.</p><p>However, since the wound wasn’t in a vital area, despite its gruesome appearance, the actual impact on the Skyfiend Yaksha was minimal. It could quickly recover by absorbing earth’s baleful energy.</p><p>Qin Sang's first instinct in the face of danger was to flee or utilize his Ebony Wood Sword or the Skyfiend Yaksha. The creatures in the jungle were unlike anything he had ever seen, their abilities bizarre and unsettling. Even with his Golden Radiance Armor, he didn't want them to touch him.</p><p>His fragrant pouch was ineffective against this river-dwelling monster.</p><p>He was annoyed. The creature's reason for ambushing him was simple: of the eight people, only he and Madam Liu had the lowest cultivation levels.  Madam Liu had a personal guard, so the choice of target was obvious.</p><p>Xiang Yi frowned as he stared at the monster fish. Suddenly, something clicked. "Not good! It's a Purple River Crocodile! Kill it quickly!"</p><p>Everyone was taken aback. Although they didn't know the reason, seeing Xiang Yi's anxious expression, they didn't dare to hesitate. They each summoned their magical treasures.</p><p>In an instant, multicolored lights from the treasures bombarded the same target.</p><p>Qin Sang was not to be outdone, unleashing his Sword Qi Thunder Sound to avenge the Skyfiend Yaksha.</p><p>The Purple River Crocodile turned and fled. Despite its bulky body, it was surprisingly agile. As it escaped, it opened its large mouth and let out a piercing howl.</p><p>The howl was sharp and earsplitting.</p><p>Just as it cried out, the Purple River Crocodile was struck by the Ebony Wood Sword, followed by two more attacks from magical treasures. The treasures hit the crocodile one after another, but failed to kill it, allowing the howl to carry outwards.</p><p>The group prepared to attack again, but Xiang Yi stopped them.</p><p>He stared intently into the depths of the jungle, allowing the Purple River Crocodile to escape back into the river. Under everyone’s puzzled gazes, he said in a low voice, "The Purple River Crocodile's call can summon nearby beasts. Let's go! Into the Purple Mist Forbidden Zone!"</p><p>Before he finished speaking, everyone sensed something amiss in the jungle depths.</p><p>The strange cries became more urgent, and dark figures were rushing towards them, densely packed.</p><p>Seeing this, everyone's scalp went numb. Without needing Xiang Yi to urge them, they quickly retrieved their magical treasures and followed him in his escape.</p><p>The differences in their escape techniques were immediately apparent.</p><p>Using only the Nine Dragons Chariot Talisman, Qin Sang was able to keep pace with Xiang Yi, the fastest among them, drawing surprised glances from everyone.</p><p>Close behind them were Mr. and Madam Liu and the young man with the sword. The young man, who had independently comprehended the Sword Qi Thunder Sound, had been observing Qin Sang intently when he used the Ebony Wood Sword.</p><p>Following them were Cui Ji, the richly dressed stout man, and the Pan cultivator. These three were roughly equal in speed, bringing up the rear.  The Pan cultivator, however, seemed the most relaxed, as if he hadn't exerted his full strength.</p><p>The horde of beasts closed in from behind.</p><p>The group fled in disarray. Fortunately, the Purple Mist Forbidden Zone was not far off. Soon, they saw an endless expanse of purple mist ahead.</p><p>The purple mist blotted out the sky and shrouded the entire jungle.</p><p>As they approached, they smelled a fragrant aroma, followed by a stinging sensation on their skin.</p><p>The mist was corrosive even before they entered. They quickly circulated their True Essence for protection.</p><p>The beasts drew closer, their thunderous movements shaking the jungle.</p><p>As soon as Xiang Yi landed, he quickly retrieved a lotus-shaped treasure from his storage pouch.  A closer look revealed that it wasn’t a true refinement, but rather carved from some kind of white bone, emitting a pale glow.</p><p>The lotus treasure was currently closed.</p><p>Infusing it with True Essence, the lotus slowly bloomed, reaching the size of a palm. All the petals glowed brightly, and the light converged into a large protective shield.</p><p>When the purple mist touched the shield, it parted, creating a safe area large enough to accommodate all eight of them.</p><p>"Come in!"</p><p>Xiang Yi beckoned.</p><p>The group gathered around him, withdrawing their protective True Essence.  They found that their skin no longer stung; the treasure could indeed ward off the poisonous mist.</p><p>Under the protection of the lotus treasure, the group hurried into the Purple Mist Forbidden Zone.</p><p>They held their breath and listened intently. Soon, the sounds of pursuit ceased.  Some beasts roared outside, but they dared not enter.</p><p>"My oversight," Xiang Yi explained. "Purple River Crocodiles are extremely rare. I thought with so many of us, they wouldn't dare show themselves… Fortunately, Daoist Qing Feng's divine abilities are outstanding."</p><p>Cui Ji sneered, "This demon Daoist has relied on that Yaksha to bolster his reputation for twenty years, and he still hasn't made any progress."</p><p>Mr. Liu shook his head. "You can't say that. I think that Yaksha is quite extraordinary. Its physical body is very strong, and that blow probably only caused superficial damage.  When I was at the mid-stage, I wouldn't have been able to defeat it easily.  The Daoist's escape technique is even more impressive; I am no match for it. I hope to have the opportunity to spar with you in the future."</p><p>Xiang Yi nodded in agreement.  "It looks like a magical treasure imbued with a Jiao soul, yet it also resembles talismanic power.  How strange…"</p><p>"Escape techniques are merely minor arts. You flatter me, fellow Daoists," Qin Sang said lightly, naturally not revealing the details of the Nine Dragons Chariot Talisman.</p><p>They couldn't pry into another's secrets and didn't inquire further.</p><p>Cui Ji was inwardly annoyed, but he couldn't say much.</p><p>……</p><p>The beasts outside gradually dispersed.</p><p>The group surveyed their surroundings.</p><p>The ancient trees within the Purple Mist Forbidden Zone were noticeably sparser and their bark had a purple hue.</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang suddenly looked down at the lotus in Xiang Yi's hand and pointed at one of the petals, asking in confusion, "Fellow Daoist Xiang, will this treasure also be affected by the purple mist?"</p><p>Everyone looked closely and saw that the petal, originally pure white, now had a strange pinkish tinge.</p>
