Chapter 455: Bai Yan Ji Wu


An hour later.


Qin Sang was awakened from meditation; his token glowed again!


A summons from Stargazing Isle!


“So soon? What’s happened again?”


Qin Sang was startled. His mind raced, but his movements didn't falter. He quickly gathered his belongings and went out, noticing a difference from last night.


Mu Yifeng and the others were nowhere to be seen, and everything else on the island appeared normal.


This meant the summons was for him alone.


He looked around, pausing for a moment, but all remained calm.  A sense of unease settled upon him.


Qin Sang didn’t dare delay and flew towards Stargazing Isle on his Youluo Cloud.


As he approached, he spotted a familiar rainbow-like light streaking through the air, also heading towards Stargazing Isle.


Qin Sang’s spirits lifted. He slowed his speed, waiting for the light to catch up.


The light, evidently noticing Qin Sang, veered towards him and landed beside him. It was Senior Brother Rong.


“Senior Brother Rong…”


Qin Sang bowed slightly and whispered, “Did you also receive a summons from Stargazing Isle?”


Senior Brother Rong nodded. “Yes!  I’m relieved to see you, Junior Brother Qin. I thought I was the only one summoned and was wondering if I had unknowingly made a mistake and was to be punished.”


Qin Sang shook his head and laughed, “To be honest, Senior Brother, I had the same thought…”


“I wonder if it’s Master Che who summoned us…”


The two continued their journey, discussing as they went. Soon, they saw Stargazing Isle and noticed numerous lights flying towards it, both righteous and demonic cultivators.


Stargazing Isle was formed by artificially joining dozens of smaller islands, yet it appeared as one. Its surface was like a mirror, reflecting everything clearly. Several large halls stood neatly arranged on the island; Qin Sang had only been to the outermost one.


Upon landing, he found over twenty people already there, standing before the hall, scattered in small groups.


At a glance, he recognized most of them.


Without exception, they were all renowned figures who had distinguished themselves during the standoff between the Lesser Cold Region and the Skywalking Alliance—mostly Nascent Soul Realm experts.


Only a few, like Qin Sang, had not reached the Nascent Soul Realm, yet still had earned considerable fame.


Seeing these people, Qin Sang had a glimmer of understanding.


As Qin Sang and Senior Brother Rong arrived, all eyes turned to them. Some were wary, some hostile, and some friendly.


A man in white robes strode forward, bowed, and smiled, “I knew you two wouldn't be missing.”


This man was from the Taiyi Danzong, named Shang Yi.


His famous weapon was a pill furnace. Qin Sang wasn’t sure if he refined pills, but he knew he refined people; countless Skywalking Alliance cultivators had been swallowed by his furnace, leaving no trace behind.


“Fellow Daoist Shang…”


Qin Sang and Senior Brother Rong returned the greeting.


Senior Brother Rong looked around, questioning, “Is Fellow Daoist Shang the only one from your sect to receive the summons?”


Shang Yi quietly pointed behind him, “Take a look at these people behind me. Is there a single unremarkable figure here?  Aren't they all battlefield veterans? In our sect, finding someone like me is already a stretch. We don't have anyone who compares to the famous Shadowless Sword.”


“Fellow Daoist Shang is teasing me again.”


Qin Sang, who knew Shang Yi well, shook his head and laughed, countering, “Regardless, I've personally witnessed Fellow Daoist Yunyouzi’s strength, I was utterly amazed. I've asked several times, but there's been no news.  Does your Taiyi Danzong hide many experts, fearing it would affect their path to Nascent Soul?”


“Likewise! Likewise!”


Shang Yi laughed heartily.


“Fellow Daoist Yunyouzi established his foundation at a hundred years old and then rapidly advanced to the Nascent Soul Realm. Such talent and willpower—who in the Lesser Cold Region can compare to him?


“I've inquired several times on your behalf, but Fellow Daoist Yunyouzi has disappeared and hasn't appeared. If I had any news, I would have told you immediately.


“Besides, Fellow Daoist Yunyouzi’s direct disciple, Li Yu Fu, is in your team. If he returns, surely he wouldn't ignore his master?”


Qin Sang nodded slightly.


Not long after the True Water Thousand Illusions Formation was set up, Li Yu Fu was also summoned to the Chaos Island waters.  Qin Sang, taking the initiative, found a reason to transfer Li Yu Fu to his team to help look after him for Yunyouzi.


Because he acted cautiously, his team suffered few losses, and Li Yu Fu remained unharmed, making significant progress over these three years.


What worried Qin Sang was that since Li Yu Fu last went to Qingyang Market to deliver a message, and Yunyouzi went off to search for heaven-grade treasures—several years had passed with no news.


Even in this great war, there was no sign of Yunyouzi.


Yunyouzi's master passed away long ago.  He, like Qin Sang, lacked strong backing in the sect, yet somehow evaded the summons from Stargazing Isle.


Three of them chatted for a while, then several more figures arrived.

Suddenly, a shrill cry came from the east. A surge of demonic energy swept past, circled above Stargazing Island, and landed in a deserted area.

The demonic energy dissipated, revealing a pale face, that of a young man appearing barely twenty years old.

However, his cultivation was undeniably at the False Core stage!

The moment this man landed, Qin Sang's eyes flickered, but his expression remained unchanged, as he continued to laugh and chat with Shang Yi.

At this time, another senior sister from the Shangyuan Quiet Palace approached.

As Qin Sang turned, his gaze subtly swept over the pale young man.

The pale young man's name was Ji Wu.

Ji Wu was his real name, but he had another identity: one of the Four Demon Emissaries of the Demon Flame Sect – White Flame!

After the destruction of the Kuiyin Sect, he became the new, and only, disciple of the hooded Taoist.

This man was less than a hundred years old, his cultivation time possibly shorter than anyone present, yet he had not only broken through to the False Core stage, but his mastery of demonic fire was superb, said to be almost as powerful as the Azure Sun demonic fire of the Azure Sun Demon Sect.

Qin Sang was very interested in him and knew he likely possessed numerous powerful artifacts and talismans.

This couldn't be explained by talent alone.

Clearly, the hooded Taoist had invested heavily in this man!

Unlike the remnants of the Kuiyin Sect, Ji Wu's background was clean, and the Yuanzhao Sect was unaware of his connection to the hooded Taoist.

Unafraid of being hunted by the Yuanzhao Sect, he was very high-profile, quite well-known in Azure Sun City. He had been transferred to the Turbulent Island waters less than two years ago, yet his reputation was already comparable to Senior Brother Rong and the others.

Qin Sang, of course, knew Ji Wu's true identity, and had secretly discovered that Ji Wu had been collecting high-quality healing pills, clearly for the hooded Taoist.

He had been planning to capture Ji Wu, but although Ji Wu was flamboyant, he was also extremely cautious.

Moreover, his cultivation was truly exceptional, having fully inherited the hooded Taoist's teachings, and Qin Sang had yet to find an opportunity.
