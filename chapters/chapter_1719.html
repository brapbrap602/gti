<h1>Chapter 1710: Lingering Fear</h1><p>Completing his cultivation in a mere seventy years was beyond even Qin Sang's expectations.</p><p>Within the cave dwelling.</p><p>Qin Sang's breathing was steady as he slowly withdrew from his meditative state.</p><p>He glanced down at the Four Saints Spirit Gathering Formation beneath him.</p><p>The formation hadn't reached its limit, but the cracks on the formation disk had more than doubled since he acquired it. The illusory images of the Four Saints engraved upon it were torn apart by a dense network of fissures, making their true forms difficult to discern.</p><p>If he were to return it to its original state, transforming it back into the Four Saints statues, he wondered if it would crumble on the spot.</p><p>Having experienced the immense power of the Four Saints Spirit Gathering Formation, Qin Sang was keen to decipher it and refine his own spirit gathering formation.  Unfortunately, the results weren't satisfactory.</p><p>Perhaps Qin Sang's cultivation realm wasn't high enough.  He forcibly memorized all the runes and intricacies of the formation, intending to continue comprehending them in the future.</p><p>A faint light flickered.</p><p>The Heaven's Eye Butterfly flew out from his dantian, dancing around Qin Sang.</p><p>Sensing the butterfly's affection, Qin Sang's expression softened. His rapid progress also benefited the Heaven's Eye Butterfly, which constantly chased after its master's footsteps.</p><p>The spirit herbs prepared for the butterfly had been used up. This trip outside was intended to find more, hoping to quickly push the Heaven's Eye Butterfly to the late peak of the Fourth Transformation.</p><p>His cultivation was complete, with no further room for advancement.</p><p>Qin Sang's next goals were clear. Besides refining the Taiji Immortal Platform and the Icefire Decree, and preparing the tribulation-crossing formation, most of his focus was on cultivation.</p><p>The first was to seek the so-called Celestial Resonance.</p><p>Celestial Resonance was profound and mysterious. Qin Sang had plundered numerous scriptures from the Wuxiang Immortal Sect and consulted Liuli about the Yanyue Nunnery's collection, but there wasn't much regarding Deity Transformation.</p><p>Naturally, no matter how many scriptures he had, it couldn't compare to those renowned sects with generations of inheritance, cultivating the same techniques, passing down experience through oral transmission.</p><p>For example, at the Ganlu Chan Monastery, at this stage, he could directly consult the Holy One Huiguang, avoiding detours and saving considerable effort.</p><p>Qin Sang had considered seeking guidance from the Holy One Huiguang, using his avatar to subtly inquire through Grandmaster Xingji.</p><p>To his surprise, the Ganlu Chan Monastery didn't seem to exclude him, an outsider.</p><p>However, Qin Sang had his own concerns.  First, he worried about harsh conditions, potentially being bound even after achieving Deity Transformation, losing his freedom.  Second, he wasn't a Buddhist cultivator.  Their paths were different, and their experiences might not apply to him, potentially misleading him.</p><p>If the Holy One Huiguang harbored ill intentions, it would be even more terrifying!</p><p>A single 'casual' remark could create a cognitive barrier for Qin Sang.</p><p>Even among fellow disciples, such exchanges were kept brief and to the point.</p><p>Therefore, Qin Sang decided to attempt it himself first.</p><p>According to the Strange-Faced Man, possessing five spiritual roots made finding Celestial Resonance easier than for others.</p><p>The second goal was to search for spirit herbs for the Heaven's Eye Butterfly, helping it break through and in turn benefit him, its master.</p><p>Breaking through himself and helping his natal insect break through – succeeding in either path would suffice.</p><p>The supplementary ingredients for the Azure Frost Pill had been partially gathered by the Nether Moon Guards and his avatar, but the three main ingredients remained elusive.  He didn't have a second portion of Azure Phoenix blood to feed the butterfly.</p><p>It seemed helping the butterfly break through was more difficult than his own breakthrough.</p><p>The third was to revisit the "Celestial Demon Body Refinement," his essence, energy, and spirit complete, replicating the path to Nascent Soul, now lacking only the physical body.</p><p>With clear goals, he should have proceeded step by step, gradually improving himself.</p><p>However, at this moment, the Unborn Demonic Seal underwent an unexpected change.</p><p>Others cultivating the "Unborn Demonic Seal" needed to carefully calculate the frequency of imbuing obsessions, matching it with their own breakthroughs and the timing of fulfilling the obsession.</p><p>Qin Sang, however, was completely unrestrained, repeatedly 'imbuing' it whenever he had free time.</p><p>Now, though not perfected, the secret technique was not far from completion.</p><p>Having reached the Deity Transformation threshold first, on a whim, Qin Sang tried circulating the secret technique, sensing the embryonic form of the demonic seal, wanting to see if it truly had the effect of breaking through the bottleneck.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the result shocked him beyond belief!</p><p>The secret technique wasn't perfected, the demonic seal was still in its embryonic form, without completing the crucial Condensing Seal step, yet Qin Sang felt a stirring, a strange sensation in the dark.</p><p>Sensing carefully, it seemed an indescribable Qi connected him to the demonic seal. Every time he touched it, the true essence within his body resonated.</p><p>Qin Sang's mind returned, his expression slightly dazed.</p><p>If his perception wasn't mistaken, the demonic seal he condensed using external demons not only had the same breakthrough effect, but its power seemed to far exceed what Senior Sister Qingjun had described!</p><p>"This…"</p><p>Qin Sang felt as if he'd been struck by a pie from the sky!</p><p>According to the information he'd obtained, barring special circumstances, cultivators breaking through to Deity Transformation generally followed two paths.</p><p>The first was to refine oneself, mirroring the heavens and earth, seeking a breakthrough from within, a path often chosen by Heaven Spiritual Root geniuses.  The "Unborn Demonic Seal," nurtured by obsessions, condensing the seal, shattering the seal, and breaking through, all involved self-transformation, and should belong to this category.</p><p>The second was to pursue Celestial Resonance first, reflecting upon oneself.</p><p>Qin Sang was clearly more suited to the second path, and had planned accordingly, primarily pursuing Celestial Resonance while using the Unborn Demonic Seal as support.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the "Unborn Demonic Seal" presented a variable.</p><p>"If the Unborn Demonic Seal's effect far exceeds expectations, could it be that with my five spiritual roots, I can actually take the first path?  Or even both paths simultaneously? If so, the probability of success…"</p><p>Qin Sang muttered to himself, incredulous.</p><p>Even with his temperament, he couldn't calm his turbulent thoughts.</p><p>Looking back, Foundation Establishment, Golden Core, Nascent Soul – each stage was more difficult than the last, never smooth sailing.</p><p>Deity Transformation, the most difficult bottleneck in this world, had trapped countless heroes for ages, even the Daoist leader, True Person Zilei, falling before it, yet he had obtained such a great opportunity.</p><p>It felt like a dream!</p><p>Having experienced countless storms, Qin Sang quickly suppressed his distracting thoughts, pondering the reason for the change in the "Unborn Demonic Seal."</p><p>Senior Sister Qingjun had no reason to deceive him.  According to the secret technique's records, the demonic seal's power had a limit; it shouldn't be this strong.</p><p>"Did this change occur because I used external demons instead of inner demons?  Could it be that the demonic intent of extraterrestrial demons is so much stronger than heart demons?  Or…"</p><p>Qin Sang pondered, a flash of inspiration striking him as he recalled the anomaly during the ritual, "Does the origin of the demonic intent, the rank of that extraterrestrial demon, also influence the demonic seal's effect?  That demonic intent was swift and powerful…"</p><p>If that was the reason, it was somewhat chilling.</p><p>The "Celestial Demon Illumination Scripture" only channeled a wisp of demonic intent, not even a sliver of the extraterrestrial demon's consciousness.  A mere Void Refinement level extraterrestrial demon probably wouldn't have such a significant effect.</p><p>"Could it be that by some minuscule chance, I encountered a powerful extraterrestrial demon?  What kind of existence was the one I channeled?"</p><p>Was this misfortune or fortune?</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't help but feel a lingering fear.</p><p>If not for the jade Buddha's protection, he might have perished on the altar.</p><p>Fortunately, he hadn't been arrogant, stopping the ritual in time and severing the connection.</p><p>Though powerful, the jade Buddha could only protect his primordial spirit, blocking mental attacks. Extraterrestrial demons wouldn't only manipulate heart demons.  Just as spiritual cultivators wouldn't solely rely on divine sense to attack their opponents' souls, they also possessed various strange and unpredictable divine abilities.</p><p>If that extraterrestrial demon was at the Body Integration stage or even more terrifying, there were countless ways to make Qin Sang's life a living hell!</p><p>Qin Sang sat upright, pondering for a long time.</p><p>The demonic seal wasn't complete yet; it was too early to celebrate.</p><p>Yet, he couldn't help but envision the future.</p><p>If the demonic seal's power was truly that strong, he might not even need to pursue the perfection of essence, energy, and spirit. He could completely rely on the demonic seal, the Spirit Rhinoceros Immortal Fruit, and his natal insect to assist his breakthrough.</p><p>This would save a tremendous amount of time.</p><p>The "Celestial Demon Body Refinement" had stagnated for years, only equivalent to the early Form Transformation realm.  Raising it further would take an unknown amount of time, comparable to the time spent on the "Fire Seed Golden Lotus."</p><p>If he could directly break through, experience the Three Disasters Tribulation, and be infused with primordial energy, due to the "Celestial Demon Body Refinement" lagging behind by a major realm, cultivating his physical body after Deity Transformation would undoubtedly yield twice the result with half the effort.</p><p>Qin Sang had experienced this during the Golden Core stage, cultivating the first two layers of the "Celestial Demon Body Refinement" in a remarkably short time.</p><p>His physical body wasn't strong enough, potentially causing instability during the Three Disasters, and there was the worry of the lightning tribulation mutating again.</p><p>But Qin Sang had the Wuxiang Immortal Sect's tribulation-crossing formation.  The formation would weaken the Three Disasters Tribulation's power.  With his powerful divine sense, along with Deity Transformation level divine abilities like the Southern Brightly Fire and the Nine Nether Demonic Fire, he had some confidence.</p><p>The saved time wasn't meaningless.</p><p>Various rumors pointed to one thing: the path of ascension through the Returning Ruins wasn't stable.</p><p>Legend had it that even after breaking through, Deity Transformation cultivators needed to cultivate for a long time, until they could advance no further, before daring to set foot in the Returning Ruins.  Even then, there were still many who perished within.</p><p>Now, with ferocious beasts escaping their lairs and roaming freely, various signs indicated changes in the Returning Ruins.  Achieving Deity Transformation early would give Qin Sang ample time to prepare for ascension.</p><p>Otherwise, painstakingly cultivating to Deity Transformation only to die on the path of ascension would be truly tragic!</p><p>Turning these thoughts over in his mind, although Qin Sang hadn't made a final decision, he adjusted his cultivation plan.</p><p>His main body would continue to seclude itself.</p><p>Although he resumed body refinement, he would only occasionally bring out the stone platform to cultivate.</p><p>He would spend more time perceiving the heavens and earth, pursuing the realm of unity with the heavens, using the Spirit Nurturing Technique to help the Heaven's Eye Butterfly, and closely observing the changes in the Unborn Demonic Seal.</p><p>"Heaven and earth, the five elements…"</p><p>Qin Sang extended his right arm, opening his palm, his eyes vacant, his expression slightly bewildered.</p><p>Celestial Resonance was easy to say, but how to achieve communion with the heavens, merging with them, was something Qin Sang had never experienced before. He could only explore it bit by bit.</p><p>Considering his own situation, Qin Sang decided to start with the five elemental spiritual energies.</p><p>Possessing five spiritual roots, he had an affinity for all five elemental spiritual energies.  When circulating his cultivation technique, he would draw all five into his body simultaneously, incredibly complex, requiring him to devote energy to sorting them.  Moreover, the mixed five elements made refining impurities extremely difficult, unlike the purity of a Heaven Spiritual Root.</p><p>Following this affinity, Qin Sang released his thoughts, actively merging with the five elemental spiritual energies between heaven and earth.</p><p>Subtly, his thoughts seemed to merge as well, circulating with the spiritual energies, spreading to boundless distances, touching all things, drifting without a destination.</p><p>Before long, a sense of alarm arose within Qin Sang. He abruptly withdrew his thoughts.</p><p>Only then did he discover that in such a short time, his divine sense was nearly depleted.</p><p>Surprised, Qin Sang realized the immense drain on his divine sense.  His divine sense was already at the Deity Transformation level.  Other cultivators at the same realm, if they hadn't tempered their divine sense, would last even shorter.</p><p>"Refining Qi to Deity Transformation… It seems spiritual cultivators have an advantage at this stage!  Cultivating the 'Fire Seed Golden Lotus' first was the correct choice, albeit unintentional…"</p><p>Qin Sang pondered silently, then calmed his mind and meditated.</p><p>…</p><p>His main body remained within the Deer Field, wholeheartedly focused on cultivation.</p><p>In stark contrast, his avatar was busy traveling, his footprints covering Southern Border, Central Plains, Northern Wasteland, Western Desert – everywhere except the Eastern Sea.</p><p>Sometimes he led the Nether Moon Guards, sometimes he traveled alone, never minding inviting helpers.</p><p>Whether it was due to his contribution of treasures to slay demons, or because of the Holy One Huiguang and the Ganlu Chan Monastery's regard for him, or perhaps both, when his avatar requested assistance, even those he'd only met a few times readily agreed.</p><p>A good reputation had its intangible benefits.</p><p>Indeed, upholding righteousness brought him much convenience, and Qin Sang didn't want to jeopardize it unnecessarily.</p><p>To acquire treasures, his avatar exhausted all means, seeking opportunities for trade.</p><p>Under the identity of Daoist Qingfeng, his avatar had a vast network, was a top expert in the world, and since Qin Sang wasn't in a hurry to improve his avatar's cultivation, he didn't mind some damage to his vital essence.</p><p>When the treasure owners encountered difficulties, his avatar could always find ways to resolve them, thereby persuading them.</p><p>The cultivation world rumored they'd never seen such an approachable, gentle, and humble grand cultivator who frequently appeared before the public. Most trade partners readily accepted.</p><p>They didn't know that if the other party was too resolute, and the treasure was essential to him, his avatar wouldn't hesitate to create difficulties for them, then step in to resolve them.</p><p>In this way, his avatar's fame in the cultivation world grew even louder.</p><p>His main body, however, had faded from view for many years.  With the Three Sects Alliance causing an uproar, fewer people mentioned him.</p><p>…</p><p>Over twenty years later.</p><p>The Deer Field had drifted to the edge of the Northern Wasteland, lingering in the northern part of Zhaoyao Prefecture for several days.</p><p>Midnight.</p><p>The night sky rippled slightly.</p><p>A shadowy figure flashed by.</p><p>At the entrance of the Deer Field, before the stone tablet, a figure appeared – the avatar.</p><p>The avatar paused, looking up, seeing his main body standing on the mountaintop, gazing at the mountains shrouded in darkness beyond the secret realm.</p><p>Their eyes met, and the main body nodded, opening the formation and allowing the avatar to enter.</p><p>He had just extended his senses, and there were no anomalies outside, no one following the avatar.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>The avatar entered, and the Deer Field immediately set off, drifting north.</p><p>Qin Sang descended from the mountaintop, sensing his avatar's experiences through their mental connection. Seeing the avatar's unstable aura, he offered a word of thanks for his hard work.</p><p>"You are me, and I am you.  There's no need to mention hardship."</p><p>The avatar removed the wooden gourd from his waist, handing it to his main body, his tone revealing fatigue.</p><p>A good reputation wasn't easily earned.</p><p>To ensure smooth transactions, the avatar spared no effort, venturing into dangerous territories, healing others' injuries, assisting in cultivating secret techniques, several times damaging his vital essence, requiring long periods of quiet cultivation to recover, sometimes a century, sometimes decades.</p><p>The second Nascent Soul returned to the main body, nurtured by a secret technique.  Then Qin Sang yielded the cave dwelling, allowing his avatar to cultivate within.</p><p>Opening the wooden gourd, although the avatar had sent some materials previously, the inside was still filled with treasures.</p><p>The materials for the Taiji Immortal Platform and the Icefire Decree were complete!</p><p>Qin Sang's face lit up with joy.  Without hesitation, he immediately gathered all the materials, carefully categorizing and storing them.  He went to a specially prepared refining chamber and began crafting the tribulation-crossing formation.</p><p>Time passed.</p><p>Another ten years.</p><p>(End of Chapter)</p>
