Chapter 1827: Dharma Manifestation


A Vermillion Bird Dharma Manifestation appeared!

The crescent moon's cold light was imminent, but Qin Sang's expression remained as still as a deep well. The Dharma Manifestation transformed into azure light, pouring into his body from his crown.

Azure light pervaded.

A phoenix cry seemed to echo from within Qin Sang.

*Whoosh!*

Behind him, phoenix wings abruptly unfurled, stretching out majestically. Arcs of lightning danced between each feather, shimmering with an otherworldly luster, displaying a beauty of the highest order.

The beauty of the phoenix wings was dazzling and mesmerizing.

Unfortunately, only Xiahou was there to witness it. Before this, Mo Xingdao's five senses had been sealed by Qin Sang and he was stored within the Soul Altar. Otherwise, with Mo Xingdao's strength, he would likely have already perished from the residual energy.

Furthermore, Qin Sang didn't want Mo Xingdao to know too many of his secrets.

Compared to the phoenix wings, Qin Sang's physical form appeared too ordinary, too mismatched.

But a faint, flickering phantom also shimmered around him. This phantom was the Vermillion Bird, merging with his physical body.

*Boom!*

Azure flames erupted from Qin Sang's body, his aura surging.

Accompanied by a deafening roar, the rapidly spinning wind pillar faltered, then was torn apart by a dense mass of azure light.

That azure light was blinding, like a flash of lightning. Within the azure light, a blurred human figure could be seen. The phoenix wings flapped once, forcibly breaking free from the binding force, and his body transformed into a bolt of lightning, retreating explosively.

The five crescent moon beams of cold light arrived as expected, only to find their target gone.

Seeing this scene, Xiahou's eyes flashed with shock, then a ruthless expression appeared. Its antlers suddenly vibrated, and the crescent moon beams brightened, as if burning all their power in an instant.  A piercing sound of tearing space echoed as the void itself was ripped apart.

At this moment, five streaks of silver-white light reflected in Qin Sang's eyes. His physical body faintly felt a tearing sensation.

If he wasn't careful, he might be dismembered by the crescent moon beams.

Just then, the phoenix wings gently flapped. At the critical moment, Qin Sang twisted his body slightly.

Through the Heavenly Eye Butterfly's vision, although the five crescent moon beams were incredibly sharp, because Qin Sang had unexpectedly broken free from the restraints, and Xiahou had staked everything on this attack, the strike was no longer perfect.  Subtle gaps existed between them.

These gaps were difficult for ordinary cultivators to perceive, or even if they sensed them, they wouldn't have the ability to exploit them.

Qin Sang happened to possess that ability.

*Swish!*

The first crescent moon beam grazed Qin Sang's chest.

Then the second, almost decapitating him, but he still dodged it.

The two crescent moon beams passed Qin Sang, immediately exploding into two blinding silver lights in the void.

At the same time, silver light also erupted in front of Qin Sang, even on his chest.

The third crescent moon beam struck his chest, but it couldn't even penetrate the Returning Wind Armor, let alone injure Qin Sang.

Because this strike was blocked by the True Treasure fragment!

When the fourth and fifth beams arrived, they were met by Qin Sang's heavy fists.

The power of his fists at this moment was more astonishing than any previous blow.

After breaking through to the mid-stage of the fifth level of the *Celestial Demon Body Refinement*, the Dharma Manifestation phantom that had begun to appear during the fourth level, after undergoing repeated transformations, finally displayed the power befitting a true Dharma Manifestation, which Qin Sang borrowed.

It was only borrowing power, because Qin Sang couldn't truly control the Vermillion Bird Dharma Manifestation yet, only merging it with his body.

Just this merging brought about a metamorphosis!

His fists shot out, their edges shimmering with an azure light like indigo. It was as if the true claws of the Vermillion Bird had merged with his fists, executing the Buddhist Seal together with him.

The power of the Buddhist Seal suddenly erupted.

*Boom!*

The two crescent moon beams first paused, then exploded before his fists, their light scattering like shards, a shocking residual energy sweeping outwards.

The five silver lights joined together, merging into a blinding light like a blazing sun, engulfing Qin Sang.

Then a clap of thunder erupted from within the silver light. Qin Sang flew out, his aura still powerful, seemingly unharmed.

The five cold beams were defeated one by one. Xiahou's all-out attack was thus neutralized.

A deep shock appeared on Xiahou's face, not because Qin Sang had blocked the killing blow, but because of the Vermillion Bird phantom.

"This is…"

Xiahou's mind was shaken. Suddenly, it met Qin Sang's chilling gaze, and then felt a blur before its eyes as a powerful aura rushed towards it.

In that instant, Xiahou had the illusion of facing a true Vermillion Bird. Its mind felt oppressed, reminding it of the time when it had not yet embarked on the path of cultivation, a mere mortal deer encountering a predator.

At this moment, Qin Sang was exerting almost all his strength, making no attempt to conceal his intense killing intent, but he still had a plan in the shadows.

Before attacking Xiahou, a jade bottle quietly appeared in Qin Sang's palm. The jade bottle silently turned to dust, the crystalline dewdrop merging with the void.

This was a poison refined from flower nectar, a formless poison Qin Sang had concocted using the secret techniques of the *Poison God Canon*.  Qin Sang crushed three bottles.

It was originally prepared for Hong Yuzi.

Qin Sang was extremely wary of this Celestial Court official.  The Great Vajra Wheel Seal, the Vermillion Bird Dharma Manifestation, and the poison were his sources of confidence. He had planned to rely on these divine abilities to rescue Mo Xingdao, but unexpectedly, they were all used against Xiahou.

He had set up a formation in the ambush location to work in conjunction with the poison; here he could only slowly set up the stage.

There was one advantage within the palace: the suction force was inwards, so there was no need to worry about the poison dissipating.

The poison dispersed without form, difficult to detect unless Qin Sang circulated his poison cultivation to activate its potency.

Of course, this amount of poison wasn't enough; detonating it now wouldn't be enough to threaten a late-stage Nascent Soul cultivator.

He was waiting!

*Whoosh!*

Qin Sang approached Xiahou like lightning, launching a counterattack.

For a moment, Xiahou didn't dare to directly confront Qin Sang.  It opened its mouth and spewed a cloud of black qi, hastily summoning its antlers back. The antlers spun in front of it, and the cloud of qi expanded and contracted, suddenly erupting into black ribbons.

Qin Sang reappeared, his fist smashing against the ribbons.  A thunderous sound shook the hall, both their bodies trembling.

Xiahou retreated, staring intently at Qin Sang. Just now, it still had some doubts, but now it was certain: that Vermillion Bird phantom was the opponent's Dharma Manifestation!

Dharma Manifestation!

A divine ability of the Demon Kings. Even among late-stage Profound Cavern Demon Marquises, some could comprehend a Dharma Manifestation, either due to extraordinary bloodline, innate talent awakening a part of their ancestral bloodline, or exceptional comprehension.

Even though Xiahou hadn't fought against them, it had heard of their strength.

These Demon Marquises were extremely rare, all honored guests of the Demon Kings, holding esteemed positions. Legend had it that some were even granted permission to cultivate in the Great Sage's Mansion.

If the Sky Chaser King's first Demon Marquis had comprehended a Dharma Manifestation, it wouldn't have entertained the thought of competing for its position.

Its own prided Deer Shadow couldn't be considered a true Dharma Manifestation. Comprehending a Dharma Manifestation signified a transformation.

It could utilize the might of heaven and earth to suppress opponents of lower realms, but it was in turn suppressed by those who had comprehended a Dharma Manifestation.

Xiahou felt that suppression from Qin Sang.  Since breaking through to the late-stage Profound Cavern, it had become accustomed to suppressing others, almost forgetting the feeling of being suppressed.

Now, unexpectedly, an opponent of a lower realm had evoked this unpleasant memory.

Comprehending a Dharma Manifestation at the mid-stage Profound Cavern was unheard of!

Unease arose in Xiahou's heart for the first time.

Qin Sang didn't give it time to think, attacking fiercely once more. He sensed Xiahou's hesitation, his eyes brightening.

At the early-stage of the fifth level of the *Celestial Demon Body Refinement*, the Dharma Manifestation could easily resist the pressure of the Li Marquis's Heavenly Might. Qin Sang had always been anticipating what the transformed Dharma Manifestation would bring him.

The facts proved that the Vermillion Bird Dharma Manifestation didn't disappoint him. Facing Xiahou, his mentality grew even stronger.

Qin Sang arrived in a flash. The shock in Xiahou's eyes hadn't yet dissipated, replaced by deep apprehension.

Its antlers flew back, circling around its body, separating and merging.

At the same time, a shimmering light flickered behind Xiahou, outlining the Deer Shadow, helping it resist the Heavenly Might.

A ruthless look appeared in Xiahou's eyes. It didn't believe a Dharma Manifestation comprehended at the mid-stage Profound Cavern could be maintained indefinitely.

But only Xiahou itself knew the unease in its heart. This was its first time fighting an opponent with a Dharma Manifestation, and the situation had spiraled out of its control.

In a split second, man and demon clashed again.

The past repeated itself, as if they were once again engaged in close combat.

But this time, both the momentum and residual power were far beyond what they had been before, the battlefield even more chaotic.

The collision of the two figures was like the collapse of mountains, terrifying in its might.

The battlefield became a hurricane, their figures blurred, locked in a fierce struggle.

Just then, a furious roar suddenly erupted from the battlefield.

"You're mad!"

This voice came from Xiahou, the last syllable distorted, like a cry of pain.

Simultaneously, Qin Sang's muffled groan also rang out.

The sounds of collision on the battlefield abruptly ceased, their bodies freezing, a brief pause occurring.

They stood face to face, extremely close. Xiahou's antlers were pressed against Qin Sang's abdomen, while Qin Sang's fist was buried in Xiahou's chest, the spiked knuckles sinking into its flesh.

The stench of blood filled the air.

Blood flowed down the spikes of the knuckles.

Similarly, the five tips of the antlers were all pressed against Qin Sang.  The central one was blocked by the True Treasure fragment, protecting his vital point, while the other four were stained red with blood.

Four holes were pierced through the Returning Wind Armor.

Neither the Vajra Glazed Body nor the Shifting Divine Light could prevent him from being injured. The violent force surged into his body through the wounds, wreaking havoc, but it was quickly suppressed.

Qin Sang didn't even glance at his wounds, his crimson eyes fixed on Xiahou, a hint of excitement flickering within.

Intense pain assaulted Xiahou's mind. Meeting Qin Sang's gaze, its expression changed slightly. It sensed Qin Sang's killing intent and determination.

Just now, it was Qin Sang who, regardless of mutual destruction, had created this situation. Xiahou had no doubt that this monster would continue to do so.

At this moment, Xiahou truly felt the urge to retreat.

In this battle, it hadn't seen any signs of Qin Sang weakening, no decline in the power of his Dharma Manifestation. Instead, it was Xiahou itself that harbored hidden worries.

Its innate divine ability could instantly restore its strength, but injuries could only be suppressed, not healed.

Its two forms shared the same physical body.

Once its other form was injured again by the enemy, and the injuries accumulated to a certain extent, it would trigger old wounds, causing them all to erupt, leading to a rapid decline.

It didn't know if Qin Sang had seen through something or had other reliance.  This insane tactic of trading injuries was what it feared most.

Xiahou glanced at the Five Elements Crown. It liked treasures, but it valued its life more.

*Tszszsz!*

Another exchange.

A ripping sound came from Qin Sang's side. The Returning Wind Armor was torn open by the sharp antlers, blood spraying like rain.

His fist, however, landed on Xiahou's shoulder, the force of the blow almost shattering Xiahou's spine.

Xiahou was certain now: Qin Sang wasn't bluffing; he truly was a madman.

Didn't he worry that even if he perished, a desperate struggle would take him along as well?

Xiahou couldn't understand, unwilling to continue. It had even used its killing blow.

Looking deeply at Qin Sang, Xiahou snorted coldly, its voice filled with anger. It had been heavily injured to lure out the Azure Fox, only to have someone else reap the benefits.

Then, Xiahou whipped up a black demonic wind, turning to rush towards the palace gate.

Unexpectedly, a bolt of lightning, faster than itself, blocked its path, then twisted and attacked.

The force of that fist formed a huge shadow, engulfing Xiahou, stinging its eyes.

"You…"

Xiahou hastily parried, stumbling back several steps, glaring at Qin Sang.

It had already conceded, giving up on the treasure, yet this person still wouldn't let it go.

A bizarre thought arose in Xiahou's mind: "Does this monster actually want to kill me? How dare he!"

Qin Sang licked his lips, his eyes bright as stars.

He had a premonition that if he could slay Xiahou, it would be better than hunting ten ferocious beasts.  For a long time after, he wouldn't need to strive for enlightenment.

If the Azure Fox Saint King hadn't forced out Xiahou's innate divine ability, Qin Sang wouldn't have had such a crazy idea.

"You're courting death!"

Xiahou roared furiously.  Since the opponent insisted on a death match, it couldn't escape.  Not only was its escape technique inferior, but once outside the hall, it would first have to face the two black dragons.

The Deer Shadow transformed into a black light, shooting towards the sky, its antlers spinning rapidly, seemingly about to make a move.

Just then, a bolt of lightning shook the palace.

This thunderclap was different from the Vermillion Bird's thunder.  A bolt of lightning, carrying the might of tribulation lightning, brewed from the void, striking towards Xiahou.

Xiahou's fur stood on end.

The aura of tribulation lightning!

This aura, whether human or demon, as long as they were cultivators, none would not fear it.

With Xiahou's cultivation, it naturally wouldn't be scared witless by a single bolt of tribulation lightning, but the shock to its mind was unavoidable.

Anyone facing a sudden tribulation lightning would hesitate, first assessing the situation, making sure of the lightning's source before relaxing. They would never be unguarded, allowing the tribulation lightning to strike them.

Xiahou decisively stopped its divine ability, retreating rapidly, its divine sense locking onto the tribulation lightning.  Only after discovering that there was only one bolt and its power was limited did it relax.  Clearly, the opponent had used some secret technique to disguise it as tribulation lightning.

It was this fleeting hesitation that Qin Sang had been waiting for. Without a moment's thought, he pushed his Thunder Escape technique to its limit, fiercely colliding with Xiahou!

While retreating, Xiahou suddenly felt its body stiffen.

Qin Sang closed in, his hands like iron pincers gripping it tightly, using his physical body as a weapon, slamming into it.  However, this exposed his unguarded side to Xiahou!

Another exchange of injuries.

Xiahou saw clearly.  That tribulation lightning was just a bluff.  Ignoring it, it immediately urged its antlers, thrusting them straight out.

Little did it know, it was indeed an exchange of injuries, but different from before.

Before Qin Sang's chest, a small, delicate fire tree appeared at some unknown point.  Nine firebirds perched on the tree's branches.

The nine firebirds simultaneously spread their wings and took flight, merging with each other upon leaving the fire tree.

This strike was guided by the Vermillion Bird spirit, but the True Essence consumed all came from Qin Sang.

Although the Vermillion Bird spirit was weak, it could still summon the Sun Divine Bird, and it didn't need to control it for long.

Because the Sun Divine Bird was coalescing into fire right before Qin Sang's chest, then, between man and deer, it exploded.

"Never seen anyone so eager to die!"

The Vermillion Bird's murmur reached Qin Sang's ears, drowned out by the explosion.
