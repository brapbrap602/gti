<h1>Chapter 459: The Peachwood Carving</h1><p>“After returning from the Ancient Immortal Battlefield, I found your message and went to Yue Market to apologize, only to learn that you had left long ago.  I later saw fellow cultivator Le Xing, but she had no news of you either. I participated in almost every major battle, yet I never saw you. Had I known you were in the  Chaos Island waters, I would have visited you immediately…”</p><p>Qin Sang spoke calmly, his voice tinged with regret.</p><p>Old Lady Jing looked at Qin Sang deeply, her voice raspy, “Qin Dao-you are so composed; your temperament is indeed excellent…no wonder you’ve achieved so much, cultivated to your current level, and earned the title of ‘Shadowless Sword.’”</p><p>What did that mean?</p><p>Qin Sang felt Old Lady Jing’s words held a hidden meaning, leaving him puzzled.</p><p>Before he could ask, Old Lady Jing changed her tone, “I have indeed been in the Chaos Island waters for three years. However, I chose to remain hidden, so you naturally couldn’t have seen me.”</p><p>Qin Sang was startled.</p><p>Old Lady Jing’s answer was unexpected.</p><p>Hidden in the Chaos Island waters for three years, undetected.</p><p>Outside, there was the powerful True Water Thousand Illusions Array, impenetrable without a blood-linked token, even for Foundation Establishment cultivators.</p><p>Inside, on Stargazing Island, numerous high-level Foundation Establishment cultivators from various sects were stationed, including top experts at the late Foundation Establishment stage, the Snake Woman and Deputy Island Master Xiao.</p><p>None of them had discovered Old Lady Jing.</p><p>Could her strength surpass even the two Island Masters of Stargazing Island?</p><p>Could it be…?</p><p>Qin Sang was shocked.  He steadied himself, bowed, and said, “Senior suddenly appearing before me must have a reason.  What can I possibly do to be of service?”</p><p>“Hehe…”</p><p>Old Lady Jing’s laughter was strange. “Since Qin Dao-you asked, I’ll be straightforward. I’ve been lurking here for three years, waiting for the emergence of the Finger-pointing Peak.”</p><p>“Finger-pointing Peak?”</p><p>Qin Sang’s expression changed. He suddenly realized Old Lady Jing’s intentions and gasped, “You intend to…?”</p><p>Old Lady Jing nodded. “That’s right. I have important business that requires a trip to Finger-pointing Peak. However, the peak is heavily guarded by the Heavenly Path Alliance and Lesser Cold Domain; I cannot enter alone and need someone’s help. You just returned from Stargazing Island; surely you’ve obtained permission to enter Finger-pointing Peak?”</p><p>Qin Sang hummed in affirmation, not denying it.</p><p>“Excellent,” Old Lady Jing said, “I thought I would have to go to great lengths, but your outstanding performance makes things much easier. I will transform into a wooden carving. You only need to carry it, and I can enter Finger-pointing Peak with you.”</p><p>Saying this, Old Lady Jing opened her palm, revealing a small, exquisite peachwood carving.</p><p>The carving depicted a woman, her eyes sparkling, lifelike.</p><p>If it were a life-sized carving, one might mistake it for a real person at first glance.</p><p>Strangely, the woman wasn’t Old Lady Jing, but a stunningly beautiful young woman of otherworldly grace—a beauty Qin Sang had never seen before.</p><p>Even as a lifeless carving, the woman possessed such charm; the real person must be no less stunning than the Morning Smoke Fairy.</p><p>If he hadn’t seen the Morning Smoke Fairy’s true appearance, Qin Sang would have been awestruck by the carving.</p><p>He glanced at the carving, hesitant to refuse outright. After a moment’s thought, he said, “Senior, you may not know, but I just learned from Deputy Island Master Xiao that the restrictions within Finger-pointing Peak are very peculiar. That space is unusually fragile; cultivators above the Foundation Establishment stage cannot enter, otherwise…”</p><p>Before he could finish, Old Lady Jing interrupted.</p><p>“I dare to enter Finger-pointing Peak because I’ve already investigated thoroughly. Rest assured, I will suppress my cultivation to the Foundation Establishment stage, staying within the limits of Finger-pointing Peak.”</p><p>Indeed, Old Lady Jing was at least a Foundation Establishment cultivator!</p><p>Qin Sang’s heart tightened. He opened his mouth to speak but…</p><p>Old Lady Jing smiled faintly, her cloudy eyes glancing at Qin Sang's face.  “You’re on the verge of Foundation Establishment; you wouldn’t want to miss the Snow Spirit Lotus and Iris Flower offered by Stargazing Island, would you?”</p><p>“You know they offered…?”</p><p>Qin Sang was startled, his expression changing, his gaze flickering as he stared at Old Lady Jing. “Senior, what do you mean?”</p><p>Old Lady Jing nodded slightly, her tone laced with disdain.</p><p>“I not only know what rewards Stargazing Island is offering, but also that each of you possesses a Soul-locking Bracelet.</p><p>“However, using the Soul-locking Bracelet to harvest starstones allows you to seal only one at a time, making the process incredibly inefficient.</p><p>“I have a magical artifact, the Star Spirit Net, incredibly effective for starstones and similar treasures, far surpassing the Soul-locking Bracelet.</p><p>“I can help you harvest enough starstones to surpass everyone else. But I have one condition: after obtaining the sufficient starstones, you must accompany me to a specific location within Finger-pointing Peak.</p><p>“As you rightly worried, I must suppress my cultivation to the utmost, limiting my freedom of movement within Finger-pointing Peak. I will rely entirely on you.”</p><p>"I don't know..."</p><p>"Friend Qin, what are your thoughts?"</p><p>Jing Po Po's voice held a seductive undertone.  As she spoke, she produced a tangled mass of thread.</p><p>The threads were chaotic and of an unknown material, shimmering with starlight.  </p><p>As Jing Po Po gently unfurled it, the threads rustled and spread into a large net, floating in the air.</p><p>Without Jing Po Po's explanation, Qin Sang recognized it.</p><p>The Star Spirit Net's quality far surpassed the Spirit Locking Bracelet; the two artifacts seemed to share a common origin, but the Star Spirit Net's effects were certainly not as simple as the bracelet's.</p><p>Jing Po Po's words were likely true!</p><p>Snow Spirit Lotus!</p><p>Iris Flower!</p><p>Qin Sang took a deep breath, forcing himself to look away from the Star Spirit Net.</p><p>It seemed that by agreeing to Jing Po Po's request, these two spiritual herbs would be easily obtained.</p><p>To say he wasn't tempted would be a lie. Qin Sang almost agreed immediately, but reason held him back.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang's silence, Jing Po Po showed no impatience, calmly asking, "What is it, Friend Qin?  Do you perhaps disdain the Snow Spirit Lotus and the Iris Flower?"</p><p>"How could I?"</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head with a wry smile. "Which Foundation Establishment cultivator could resist their allure? I nearly couldn't hold back, but I have a concern...  Can your presence within the wooden carving truly deceive everyone?"</p><p>Before Jing Po Po could answer, Qin Sang added,</p><p>"I wonder if you were present during last night's great battle?</p><p>"In the end, several Nascent Soul masters arrived before the battle concluded.</p><p>"I've inquired with several fellow cultivators and learned that one red-haired elder was actually the Pure Yang Sect Master, the current top expert in the cultivation world!</p><p>"For three whole years, this was the first time I've seen a Nascent Soul master appear, and it happened to coincide with the appearance of the Finger Heaven Peak.</p><p>"Could it be mere coincidence?</p><p>"I don't know if both sides' Nascent Soul masters will be present when Finger Heaven Peak opens again.</p><p>"But I dare not gamble!</p><p>"If I disappoint you, I'd rather die to atone for my guilt.</p><p>"If your concealment is discovered by a Nascent Soul master, you might be able to escape, but I would certainly be branded a traitor and suffer a fate worse than death!"</p>
