<h1>Chapter 873: Silver Spear</h1><p>Inside the quiet room of a small shop.</p><p>A burly man sipped his tea absentmindedly, his eyes darting towards the back room every now and then. He fidgeted, rubbing his jade teacup between his fingers, fine powder簌簌falling from between his fingers, a layer visibly worn away from the cup.</p><p>The shop assistant stared at him, indignant but不敢言.</p><p>After all, this was a Foundation Establishment cultivator.</p><p>The man drained his tea in one gulp, stood up, and paced back and forth, his steps forceful.</p><p>The assistant couldn't help but say, "Senior, please be patient. Our owner's refining skills are among the best in the market.  You won't be disappointed."</p><p>"You know nothing!"</p><p>The burly man glared. "I spent two years at sea to catch that Silvertail Beast, just to get a fist-sized throat stone to enhance my Silver Spear. If it gets ruined, not only will the throat stone be wasted, but my Silver Spear will also lose its spirit. Why did I get so muddled, listening to those guys and coming to an unknown refiner?  I should have..." He sighed.</p><p>Scolded, the assistant shrank back, not daring to retort, and scurried away to the front of the shop.</p><p>Left alone, the burly man continued to pace.  There was still no news from the back room. He was anxious but dared not intrude.</p><p>It was understandable why he was so anxious. The Silver Spear was his only top-grade magical tool and extremely important. If it were ruined, his strength would greatly diminish.</p><p>Just as his anxiety reached its peak, the door finally opened. A plain-looking middle-aged man walked in with a smile.</p><p>He held a silver spear, gleaming brilliantly, clearly of exceptional quality. The spearhead was large and sharp, as if glazed, glittering with a cold light.</p><p>The burly man rushed to the man, his face full of urgency.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Mingyue, how did it go?"</p><p>His eyes were fixed on the silver spear.  It felt both familiar and foreign, but he was certain that it was his magical tool.</p><p>"Why don't you see for yourself..."</p><p>The shopkeeper smiled, tossed the spear to the burly man, and sat down at the table, taking a sip of tea.</p><p>This person was Qinsang in disguise. He had assumed a false identity, refining tools in the market to hone his refining skills.  The cultivators in the market wouldn't have any magical treasures for him to refine, but top-grade magical tools were sufficient for Qinsang to initially comprehend the restrictions.</p><p>He didn't take on many jobs, choosing them carefully, but the results always satisfied his clients, building his reputation.</p><p>This burly man had gotten a great deal.</p><p>Qinsang had just gained new insights yesterday, greatly improving his refining skills. The power of this refined Silver Spear was no less than the magical tools he had previously refined using Nine Nether Demonic Fire.</p><p>The burly man lightly swung the Silver Spear, and a blue wave shot out from the spearhead. The quiet room seemed to transform into an underwater space, ripples spreading rapidly in all directions.</p><p>'Crack...Crack...'</p><p>The jade teacups on the table shattered one after another.</p><p>Qinsang flicked his finger, white light flashing on the walls of the quiet room, and snorted, "Fellow Daoist, if you don't stop, are you planning to demolish my shop?"</p><p>The burly man came to his senses, quickly stopped, and hurried to Qinsang, cupping his hands. "I got carried away in my excitement. Please forgive me, Fellow Daoist..."</p><p>A moment later.</p><p>The two sat facing each other in the newly tidied quiet room.</p><p>The burly man now had no doubts about Qinsang, his words full of admiration.</p><p>Qinsang shook his head. "My luck was exceptionally good today, and your magical tool had a good foundation, which allowed for such a great improvement. This kind of result can't be replicated."</p><p>He didn't want his reputation to become too great and attract unwanted trouble.</p><p>However, the benefits of refining this spear were obvious. The burly man regarded Qinsang as a master refiner and was eager to befriend him, becoming very forthcoming.</p><p>Qinsang learned that the burly man came from a sect called Dianjun Mountain.</p><p>After a moment's thought, he recalled that Dianjun Mountain was a small sect on Landou Island, with one peculiarity: Dianjun Mountain and Landou Sect were located on the same mountain range.</p><p>This mountain range, called Landou Mountain, was vast.  The most fertile area with the best spiritual veins was occupied by Landou Sect, and small sects like Dianjun Mountain could only establish themselves in remote areas.</p><p>"I hear that the sects near Landou Sect all have some connection to it, and those who make great contributions can even glimpse the true teachings of Landou Sect.  Just now, Fellow Daoist displayed superb water-type spiritual power in your spear technique. Landou Sect has a technique called 'Water Breathing', quite renowned. Have you ever studied it?"</p><p>Qinsang asked with feigned curiosity.</p><p>The burly man smiled wryly and shook his head. "Fellow Daoist overestimates me. How can a small sect like mine catch the eye of Landou Sect? Only those sects directly affiliated with Landou Sect might have such an opportunity. If I had truly seen the 'Water Breathing' technique, I wouldn't have such meager cultivation."</p><p>"Are the true teachings of Landou Sect really that powerful?"</p><p>Qinsang continued to probe.</p><p>"Of course, the heritage of a large sect is beyond our imagination."</p><p>The burly man, despite his rough nature, spoke of Landou Sect with genuine respect.  "Landou Sect's three most famous true teachings, 'Water Breathing', 'Wood Bending Scripture', and 'Yin Yang Heavenly Duel Secret Art', are all top-tier cultivation methods. Even their slightly lesser true teachings are supreme cultivation methods that we can only dream of..."</p><p>Qinsang listened silently as the burly man detailed the true teachings of Landou Sect.</p><p>During this time, he had interacted with many Foundation Establishment cultivators, discreetly gathering information, and had learned a great deal about Landou Sect.  But to his astonishment, there wasn't a single cultivation method related to Star Yuan power!</p><p>The burly man knew more about Landou Sect than anyone Qinsang had previously encountered, and after listing all the true teachings, there was still no mention of such a method.</p><p>Qinsang found this strange.</p><p>Landou Sect once had a Core Formation cultivator named Qiyunzi who cultivated this kind of technique, but no one seemed to know about the cultivation method or even Qiyunzi himself.</p><p>He recalled what Zhushan Weng had said.</p><p>He had just entered the path of cultivation when he met Qiyunzi, and Zhushan Weng was now over four hundred years old.</p><p>It was understandable that no one remembered someone from four hundred years ago, especially if some accident had occurred.  Landou Sect had no shortage of Core Formation cultivators.</p><p>However, the true teachings of a renowned sect like Landou Sect couldn't be completely hidden. Only the specific contents of the cultivation methods were kept secret.</p><p>"Could it be that Qiyunzi obtained the cultivation method outside the sect?"</p><p>This thought crossed Qinsang's mind.</p><p>This would be troublesome; he might have chosen the wrong target.</p><p>If Qiyunzi had perished outside the sect, or even in the Demonic Sea, his secrets would have been lost.  Qinsang's hope of finding clues about Star Yuan Infusion through Qiyunzi would be slim.  His best hope now lay with the Scorpion Venom Grass.</p><p>As Qinsang pondered, the burly man continued to talk enthusiastically, finally sighing, "If you want to learn the true teachings, you can only join Landou Sect. Otherwise, even if you get a chance to glimpse them, they won't reveal the core essence."</p>
