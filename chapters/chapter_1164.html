<h1>Chapter 1156: Nascent Soul</h1><p>Near the Illusion Mist Sect, Qin Sang found nothing unusual.  </p><p>He had hoped that Dongyang Bo might have left some arrangements nearby, but upon realizing he had overthought it, he couldn’t help but feel a tinge of disappointment.  </p><p>"Brother Bai, the Illusion Mist Sect is rich in spiritual energy and safer than most places. You can seclude yourself here from now on. If you need anything, just issue orders to the disciples of the Illusion Mist Sect in my name."  </p><p>Qin Sang entered the former cave abode of Leng Yuntian and prepared a quiet chamber for Bai.  </p><p>Bai nodded. "I only need to focus on refining the Corpse Soul Pearl. I don’t require much else."  </p><p>"I’ll be waiting for good news from you, Brother Bai!" Qin Sang watched as Bai entered the cave.  </p><p>Bai’s seclusion this time might last for many years. Fortunately, Qin Sang was no longer the same as before and didn’t lack such an ally.  </p><p>Suddenly, Qin Sang remembered something and hurriedly added, "Brother Bai, when you advance to the Corpse King stage and face the heavenly tribulation, be extremely careful! If you sense the opportunity for a breakthrough, notify me in advance so I can come and protect you."  </p><p>Qin Sang’s tone was grave as he reminded Bai.  </p><p>Both he and Yun Youzi had experienced strange changes during their heavenly tribulations. Bai’s situation was different from theirs, yet there were similarities. Qin Sang couldn’t help but wonder if Bai’s tribulation would also undergo unexpected changes.  </p><p>...  </p><p>After sealing the cave, Qin Sang sat cross-legged, recalling the process of forming his Nascent Soul and enduring the heavenly tribulation. He still felt a lingering fear.  </p><p>The formation of the Nascent Soul had gone relatively smoothly. Despite the slow progress, it was successful, though the most dangerous step was shattering his Golden Core.  </p><p>His true essence reversed, and the chaotic energy nearly tore apart his dantian and meridians, causing excruciating pain throughout his body. Fortunately, Qin Sang was accustomed to such pain and, with immense willpower, focused his mind, stabilized his cultivation, and successfully condensed his Nascent Soul!  </p><p>The heavenly tribulation that followed truly made Qin Sang understand the unpredictability of heavenly might.  </p><p>Even with his strength, it was an arduous ordeal, and he had directly bypassed the inner demon tribulation. For others, it might have meant turning to ashes.  </p><p>"Nascent Soul, emerge!"  </p><p>Impatiently, a flash of spiritual light appeared above Qin Sang’s head.  </p><p>His Nascent Soul emerged from his body. It was smaller than the shrunken Heavenly Eye Butterfly, delicate and adorable, with an appearance identical to Qin Sang’s. Its eyes were lively as it floated in front of Qin Sang, smiling at his physical body.  </p><p>The Heavenly Eye Butterfly also emerged, even more excited than the Nascent Soul, fluttering around it.  </p><p>The Nascent Soul was delighted and began playing with the Heavenly Eye Butterfly.  </p><p>Then, the Nascent Soul opened its tiny mouth, and a slender stream of light flew out, revealing the Ebony Sword.  </p><p>The Nascent Soul, now in high spirits, commanded the Ebony Sword to fly around, with the Heavenly Eye Butterfly chasing after it. The quiet chamber was soon filled with dazzling streams of light.  </p><p>After a while, the Nascent Soul showed signs of fatigue, retrieved the spiritual sword, and returned to Qin Sang’s body.  </p><p>The next moment, Qin Sang opened his eyes, his expression filled with excitement and a newfound sense of wonder.  </p><p>After shattering his Golden Core and forming his Nascent Soul, he could now attach his consciousness to it and have it leave his body. However, controlling the Nascent Soul still felt somewhat awkward and strenuous.  </p><p>It would likely take some time for his cultivation to stabilize and for the Nascent Soul to become fully integrated before he could control it effortlessly. Only then would he be able to smoothly perform teleportation techniques.  </p><p>Even so, Qin Sang was immensely pleased.  </p><p>The Nascent Soul, like a newborn infant, possessed a pure heart. In this state, comprehending the Heavenly Dao was much easier than before.  </p><p>"With the amplification from the Slaughter Talisman, my cultivation speed is already very fast. However, I must not let my guard down. Every bottleneck in the minor realms ahead will have to be overcome through my own efforts. These challenges might not be any easier than before, which is why there are so few great cultivators..."  </p><p>Qin Sang chuckled wryly. It was too early to think about the late Nascent Soul stage.  </p><p>For now, he needed to focus on steady cultivation.  </p><p>As he pondered this, Qin Sang suddenly summoned a fragment of the Slaughter Sword and stared at it, his expression shifting uncertainly.  </p><p>At the moment his Nascent Soul formed, a faint, unfamiliar consciousness had emerged from the Slaughter Sword fragment. It was so weak that Qin Sang had almost missed it during the critical moment.  </p><p>Without a doubt, this consciousness had come from the sword spirit of the Slaughter Sword fragment.  </p><p>The message was simple: continue searching for other fragments of the Slaughter Sword. The sword spirit would alert him when he encountered other fragments.  </p><p>Previously, Qin Sang had tried countless times to communicate with the sword spirit, but it had never responded. He guessed that his cultivation had been too low before, and the sword spirit had only been awakened by the intense fluctuations during the formation of his Nascent Soul, allowing it to send a brief message.  </p><p>However, the sword spirit’s consciousness had vanished almost instantly, falling back into slumber.  </p><p>Qin桑 hesitated for a moment, then cautiously extended his divine sense into the Slaughter Sword fragment. After a thorough search, he found no response, as if his efforts had sunk into an abyss.  </p><p>This indicated that the sword spirit was still extremely weak and unable to remain awake.  </p><p>A look of hesitation flashed in Qin Sang’s eyes.  </p><p>Qingzhu’s warning still echoed in his mind. When he had been unconscious, the sword spirit had taken control of his body, leaving Qin Sang with no choice but to be wary.  </p><p>He couldn’t determine whether the sword spirit was benevolent or malevolent.  </p><p>However, he hadn’t sensed any malice from the brief message.  </p><p>The fact that the Slaughter Sword had birthed a sword spirit was undoubtedly a sign of its extraordinary nature, and the temptation was immense. More importantly, each fragment of the Slaughter Sword might contain remnants of the cultivation technique.  </p><p>He hadn’t expected the sword spirit to bring such a pleasant surprise.  </p><p>Although reaching the Deity Transformation stage was still a distant goal, preparing the cultivation technique in advance wouldn’t hurt.  </p><p>"The Purple Micro Palace, the Seven Slaughter Hall... I wonder if there are other fragments hidden there. In the future, I might have to leave the North Star Realm and explore the other three realms."  </p><p>Qin桑 thought to himself.  </p><p>The sword spirit’s message had forced him to reconsider his future plans.  </p><p>He couldn’t stay secluded in the Cold Domain forever. He would have to travel the world in search of the Slaughter Sword fragments. After establishing the Green Goat Temple, he would need to find a reliable person to protect both the temple and the Thousand Bamboo Sea.  </p><p>He hoped Li Yufu wouldn’t disappoint him.  </p><p>As for the sword spirit’s potential backlash, Qin桑 felt it wasn’t something to worry about for now.  </p><p>By the time the sword spirit awakened, his cultivation would have advanced far beyond its current level, and he might have a way to subdue it. Moreover, the sword spirit might have already recognized him as its master.  </p><p>After some contemplation, Qin桑 put away the Slaughter Sword fragment and turned his attention to the Heavenly Eye Butterfly on his shoulder.  </p><p>During the heavenly tribulation, the Heavenly Eye Butterfly had helped him withstand the lightning while slowly devouring the scattered threads of tribulation lightning. However, it hadn’t shown any noticeable changes yet.  </p><p>"How can I help the Heavenly Eye Butterfly continue to grow and truly gain the ability to devour tribulation lightning?"  </p><p>Qin桑 was at a loss. He had no idea how to further nurture the Heavenly Eye Butterfly and wondered if the Beast Taming Sect had any rare texts he could study for guidance.  </p><p>The Heavenly Eye Butterfly playfully nuzzled Qin桑 for a while before retreating into his dantian.  </p><p>Next, Qin桑 began organizing the tasks he needed to accomplish after forming his Nascent Soul.  </p><p>The first was to cultivate the eighth layer of the "Divine Soul Nurturing Sword Scripture."  </p><p>During this process, he would need to project the Slaughter Talisman from the Ebony Sword onto the seven sword souls and gradually merge these sword souls with his seven ethereal souls.  </p><p>The state of the Ebony Sword wouldn’t affect this cultivation.  </p><p>Therefore, Qin桑 directly took out the other half of the Soul Nurturing Wood, deciding to refine it as soon as possible to enhance the Ebony Sword.</p>
