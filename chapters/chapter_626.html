Chapter 618: The Continent of Wu Shen


“Many thanks, fellow Daoist, for your assistance!”


The three, still shaken, bowed their hands in gratitude to the Flying Night Devil.  The Flying Night Devil had only assisted them in slaying the Bloodwing Skull Hornets and retrieving the nest, without displaying its full strength. With their discerning eyes, they couldn't fathom the Flying Night Devil's true capabilities. However, after the recent battle, they could see that the Flying Night Devil was even stronger than the young man, so they spoke with utmost respect.


The Flying Night Devil, clutching the hornet nest, stood there silently.  The three exchanged glances, perplexed.


At this moment, Qin Sang emerged from the shadows. Like the Flying Night Devil, his cloak concealed most of his body.


“It was a minor effort, nothing worth mentioning.”


Qin Sang approached them, meeting their wary gazes.  “This is my puppet. I'm traveling and cultivating, but I lost my way. Passing by, I saw you three under attack by those monstrous hornets and instructed my puppet to intervene.”


The three relaxed visibly.


The young man stepped forward.  “I am Yuan Hu of the Five Venom Sect. These two are the High Priest and Junior Priest of the Skymoon Village. May I ask for your name, fellow Daoist?”


“You can call me Mingyue.”


Qin Sang didn't even dare to use his Daoist title, Qingfeng. He beckoned the Flying Night Devil over to examine the hornet nest.


Inside were the Bloodwing Skull Hornet larvae.  Since the adult hornets had killed so many creatures and reverted to their ferocious nature, taming them was impossible. Qin Sang had killed them all, leaving only the larvae.


“Mingyue…”


The three exchanged glances.  None had heard the name before.  They wanted to invite Qin Sang to the Skymoon Village.


Qin Sang declined the invitation.  “I have cultivated diligently since childhood, and my cultivation has recently seen some progress. I intended to travel and explore, but I lost my way here. I was just about to ask for directions when I encountered you three. Could you kindly guide me?”


“That’s easy!”


Yuan Hu retrieved a jade slip and, with a flick of his hand, sent it floating towards Qin Sang.  “Fellow Daoist Mingyue, this is a topographical map issued by my sect. It marks the nearby roads and hazardous areas. You can follow its guidance.”


Qin Sang’s expression shifted slightly. He took the jade slip and infused it with a faint wisp of divine consciousness, only to be disappointed. The jade slip only contained markings of the immediate vicinity.


The most prominent markings on the map were a tall mountain called Bear Mountain and the location of the Five Venom Sect.


Besides these, there were markings of several large villages, including Skymoon Village. Among them, Skymoon Village ranked in the middle, while Thousand Households Village wasn't even marked. The Five Venom Sect seemed to be the most powerful force in the area.


Seeing the map’s contents, Qin Sang gained a general understanding of the forces near Bear Mountain, but this wasn't what he urgently needed to know.


“Fellow Daoist Yuan, does your sect only have maps of this area?  I haven't been out for long and am unfamiliar with the outside world.  Does your sect have knowledge of other places?”


“I don't have maps of other areas yet, as my cultivation is insufficient. However, my sect elders do. If you wish, you can accompany me back to my sect and borrow one from them.”


Yuan Hu explained, “The topographical maps treasured by my sect not only cover the other parts of our Western Frontier but also mark some major forces and dangerous places across the entire Continent of Wu Shen.  However, we don’t have knowledge of the seas beyond the continent.  For that, you’d have to inquire with those larger powers.”


The Continent of Wu Shen!


Hearing this unfamiliar name, Qin Sang inwardly breathed a sigh of relief. A place daring to use "Continent" in its name must be a vast territory. He had indeed left the Small Cold Region.


Hearing Yuan Hu mention the seas beyond the continent, Qin Sang’s curiosity was piqued again.


“It’s said that our Continent of Wu Shen is just the largest island in this vast sea. In the past, not only the Continent of Wu Shen but also all the other islands, big and small, were the territory of our Wu cultivators. Later, the treacherous humans seized our cultivation resources and drove us from our homeland. Now, we Wu cultivators, forced by the humans, can only cultivate on the Continent of Wu Shen and a few surrounding islands…”


Yuan Hu spoke of the human cultivators with great indignation.


His cultivation was low, and his knowledge limited.  Much of what he said was hearsay and vague, but it was enough for Qin Sang to glean some information.


Qin Sang was secretly astonished. He had thought he was transported to an unfamiliar continent, but it turned out this was a vast and boundless sea.


The cultivators here were divided into humans and Wu, and they were not on good terms, having engaged in great wars.


Humans thrived, and the Wu retreated to the Continent of Wu Shen.


According to Yuan Hu, the Continent of Wu Shen was vast, but just how vast, he couldn’t say.


Qin Sang eagerly wanted to learn about the outside world, but ultimately, he declined Yuan Hu's invitation. Knowing this wasn't the Small Cold Region was enough for now.


He didn’t understand the Five Venom Sect's strength or nature. Seeing that Yuan Hu also cultivated corpse refinement techniques, he suspected they weren't benevolent. His priority was to find a place to heal and form his Gold Core.


After recovering his strength, it wouldn't be too late to visit them.


Yuan Hu wasn't offended by the refusal.  He said enthusiastically, “If you’re not in a hurry to leave, you can wait a few more days. Before the annual Wu Shen Festival, the shamans and priests of all the villages in the Bear Mountain region will hold a gathering on Bear Mountain to exchange information and goods. Whether you’re seeking information or trading treasures, you shouldn't miss it.”


Qin Sang's interest was piqued. This was indeed a good opportunity to gather information.


He still had many things to investigate, such as news of Senior Qingzhu, whether there were secret realms or ancient restrictions near the ruins, and how to find an ancient teleportation formation.


He was only temporarily avoiding danger, he couldn’t simply settle down here. The Nine Phantasmal Sky Orchid was still in the Small Cold Region, and he had to return before reaching Nascent Soul.


Yuan Hu’s cultivation was too low, his knowledge limited.


Qin Sang quickly inquired about the gathering's time. Calculating, he had enough time before then to heal and form his Gold Core.


After some more pleasantries, Qin Sang decided to take his leave. Having seen the topographical map, he knew where to search for spirit veins.


“Wait, fellow Daoist!”


Seeing Qin Sang about to leave, Yuan Hu hurriedly called out to him, saying sheepishly, “I have a small request. Could you leave me one of the monster hornet larvae?”


They had been in grave danger, and the Flying Night Devil had appeared, slaying the Bloodwing Skull Hornets and saving them.  Logically, the nest was Qin Sang's spoils of war, and they had no right to a share.


Qin Sang pointed to the Skymoon Village priests' spirit insects, asking in surprise, “With your high cultivation, don't you already have…”


“No, no…”


Yuan Hu shook his head repeatedly.  “I already have my Life Gu. I was focused on controlling my bone skeleton earlier, so I didn’t release it. I just think this type of monster hornet has decent combat abilities. I’ve never seen it before, and it's not even recorded in the Wu Insect List. I’m quite curious.”


So it's called Life Gu.


Wu Insect List.


Qin Sang silently memorized these two names, guessing the Wu Insect List was similar to the Spirit Insect List of the Spirit Controlling Sect.


It seemed that the Wu cultivators had a more comprehensive and profound understanding of spirit insects, even refining them into Life Gu. The Wu Insect List must be more systematic than the Spirit Insect List.
