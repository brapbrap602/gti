Chapter 1830: The Dao


Compared to these spoils of war, Qin Sang's greatest gains were his comprehension of cultivation techniques and the Dao of Slaughter.

He meticulously categorized and stored the items, then sat down in meditative posture, circulating his cultivation technique, silently reflecting on the insights gained from that battle.

Slaying the Azure Fox Holy King.

Forcing Xiahou to self-destruct.

New and old grudges were settled in one fell swoop.

More importantly, there was the exhilaration of exerting his full strength, overcoming a powerful enemy, and seizing a supreme treasure.

Every time he recalled it, Qin Sang felt the urge to roar in unrestrained joy.

Qin Sang understood the state of mind of the senior who created the *Nascent Soul Sword Nurturing Chapter* at the Nascent Soul realm.

He desired not to kill, yet feared not to kill.

The sword brought forth karmic consequences, then he sheathed it and departed!

This state of mind revealed the senior's Dao, which was also the Dao of the cultivation technique. Understanding this state of mind would greatly aid Qin Sang in comprehending the technique.

Looking back on his past cultivation, before the Nascent Soul stage, he engaged in ceaseless slaughter, his killing intent soaring to the heavens. Condensing the Killing Rune allowed his cultivation to progress unimpeded, without bottlenecks between minor realms.

However, at the Nascent Soul realm, Qin Sang relied on external objects, the Corpse Flower Blood Amber and the Buddha Bone Sarira, for his breakthrough. He hadn't felt the cultivation technique itself aiding him.

Now he realized it wasn't that he hadn't grasped the Dao within the technique, but that the senior was struggling amidst the slaughter, lost in confusion, hesitant between killing and not killing.

This confusion was also confusion regarding the Dao.

The Ghost Mother had said that the Nascent Soul stage was the beginning of comprehending the Dao. Truly, those were wise words.

Ultimately, the senior established his own Dao, sheathed his sword, and stepped into the Deity Transformation realm!

Comprehending the senior's current state of mind was a guidance from the Dao, immensely helpful for understanding the cultivation technique.

Then, beyond the Void Refinement stage, what choice would the senior make? Would he continue on this path, or undergo a new transformation?

And what was the Dao of the *Demonic Refinement of Form*?

A thought struck Qin Sang as he considered the *Demonic Refinement of Form*. The most distinctive feature of this technique was the manifestation of a Dharma Idol phantom at the Nascent Soul stage.

Now, Qin Sang knew the power of the Dharma Idol, a great divine ability typically attainable only after Void Refinement.

His early acquisition of the Dharma Idol was likely related to the Azure Roc's essence blood, but ordinary techniques certainly couldn't achieve this.

The Dharma Idol, perhaps, was the Dao of this technique.

Having guidance from the Dao at the very beginning of comprehension illuminates the path for cultivators, preventing them from straying.

This, perhaps, was the difference between top-tier cultivation techniques and ordinary ones!

Gathering his scattered thoughts, Qin Sang returned to the *Nascent Soul Sword Nurturing Chapter*. After careful contemplation, he couldn't help but feel elated.

As expected, the gains from this battle were immense.

His opponents included not only Deity Transformation late-stage cultivators but also his sworn enemies, all of whom died by his hand.

Others at the early Deity Transformation stage could only flee in the face of late-stage cultivators.  It was conceivable how much this battle had aided Qin Sang in comprehending the cultivation technique.

Although his cultivation hadn't yet reached that level, Qin Sang had a vague feeling that, at least before breaking through to the mid-Deity Transformation stage, he wouldn't encounter many obstacles.

Qin Sang emerged from his meditative state, exited his cave dwelling, inspected the flower field, and collected the newly matured flower dew.

Next, he would focus on diligent cultivation, breaking through to the mid-Deity Transformation stage, which he estimated wouldn't be too difficult.

After this minor interlude, Qin Sang continued to heal his injuries. This time, his recovery was swift, taking less than a month to fully recuperate.

Only then did Qin Sang take out the Five Elements Crown.

Besides his insights into cultivation techniques, this treasure was his greatest reward from the battle.

Five-colored light illuminated the cave dwelling as the five-colored crown hovered quietly.

Qin Sang closed his eyes, channeling his divine sense to envelop the Five Elements Crown, but suddenly paused.

After a moment of thought, he took out some formation flags, placed them around him, and set up a protective formation. He then cast the Great Vajra Wheel Seal, and his Azure Roc Dharma Idol stood guard, finally putting him at ease.

His divine sense carefully probed the Five Elements Crown.

The artifact spirit seemed to sense the intrusion of an external force, emitting unusual fluctuations.

Qin Sang's heart tightened, and he slowed down.  Fortunately, he had actively accepted the demonic thoughts' invasion and imitated the artifact spirit's aura, which didn't provoke hostility.

His movements became even gentler.

In Qin Sang's perception, it was as if he was passing through layers of chaotic aura, approaching a mass of light filled with chaos and madness.

This mass of light was the demonic spirit.

More precisely, it was the product of the fusion of the demonic spirit, Zhu Wudao's Nascent Soul, and the demonic soul, now indistinguishable from one another.

‘Looking’ at this mass of light, Qin Sang hesitated. According to Mo Xingdao, the demonic spirit was the dominant force in the devouring process, but Qin Sang couldn't sense the demonic spirit's intelligence.

Qin Sang sensed it for a long time and gained some understanding. Perhaps when the devouring was completely finished and the three became one, a new intelligence would be born.

As for whether this new intelligence would still be the original demonic spirit, no one could say for sure.

“I should be able to do something…”

Qin Sang thought to himself.

Others dared not interfere with the demonic spirit's devouring primarily because they feared being tainted by demonic thoughts. However, Qin Sang was unafraid. He could recklessly contact the demonic spirit with his divine sense and try to guide its devouring process.

The chaotic intelligence of the demonic spirit also had its advantages.  Like a blank sheet of paper, it could be freely inscribed.

While guiding the demonic spirit's devouring, he could subtly leave his mark, subtly influencing the demonic spirit to acknowledge him, and even achieve the goal of making the demonic spirit recognize him as its master.

If this treasure could transform into a Postnatal Spirit Treasure, it would undoubtedly be a great asset in the future.

It was worth a try!

Of course, it was easier said than done.

Qin Sang only had a preliminary idea.  How to put it into practice required careful consideration.

Moreover, the process was bound to be extremely long.

Before the devouring was complete, was there a way to wield this treasure? Or could he create a type of restriction?

Even if he could only unleash a portion of its power, it would be a significant boost to his strength.

The Inverse Five Elements Divine Light had severely injured Xiahou in a single blow, demonstrating that the treasure's power was already vastly different from before.

Qin Sang focused his thoughts, considering various possibilities.

Soon after, he began to seriously experiment.

Within the quiet cave dwelling, the five-colored light flickered, reflecting a face that alternated between sudden realization and furrowed brows.

Time flowed by quietly.

…

One year after the battle in the Mirror Space.

Qin Sang left the flower field for the first time, deciding to take Mo Xingdao away from the Land of Calamity.

Ordinary people found it difficult to stay in the Cleansing Platform for so long. Qin Sang gave Mo Xingdao the spirit-stabilizing pills he'd received from True Person Zhijian, instructing him to consume them to allay his concerns.

However, before leaving, he went against the grain and headed deeper into the Cleansing Platform.

Deliberately avoiding the Mirror Space, Qin Sang entered from a different location, arriving at a relatively open space.

Mo Xingdao, transformed into a kingfisher, perched on his left shoulder.

“Go there!”

Mo Xingdao raised a wing, pointing to Qin Sang's right.

Qin Sang followed his directions, navigating through several illusions without incident, and his eyes fell upon a massive clump of Primordial Yellow Qi.

The Primordial Yellow Qi coalesced into a mass, shaped like a chicken egg, with varying densities within, revealing the trajectories of its flow.

Qin Sang gazed at it for a long time, first having Mo Xingdao return to the Cleansing Platform. He then activated the Great Vajra Wheel Seal, his body radiating琉璃宝光, and stepped inside.

The instant he entered the Primordial Yellow Qi, Qin Sang felt an immense pressure descend upon him, far exceeding the suction force of the Mirror Space.

‘Crack… Crack… Crack…’

Even with his robust physique, his bones emitted cracking sounds as if they were about to be crushed.

Qin Sang groaned, unhesitatingly summoning his Azure Roc Dharma Idol. The power of the Dharma Idol surged into his body, resisting the pressure as he continued forward.

Fortunately, there were no other dangers here, and Qin Sang successfully passed through the Primordial Yellow Qi, letting out a sigh of relief.

At this point, he was already feeling strained, unsure how far he was from the path to ascension.

The path ahead would undoubtedly be increasingly difficult, requiring careful planning. This time, he needed Mo Xingdao to point out the direction.

He summoned Mo Xingdao once more.

Mo Xingdao took just one look and was immediately captivated by an illusion, exclaiming in surprise, “There! I remember! I saw this kind of Crimson-Gold Spirit Needle when I was thrown into this realm!”

Following Mo Xingdao's gaze, Qin Sang looked towards the upper left, where an unusual phenomenon was reflected.

When the Cleansing Platform was stable, most illusions appeared calm from the outside, revealing their dangers only upon entry.

This place was different.

One could see with the naked eye millions of crimson and gold needles, each whistling as they collided and attacked each other.

Qin Sang drew closer, observing carefully for a while, but couldn't help feeling disappointed. The illusion before him was false. This particular illusion was special, projecting an image from elsewhere. The true Crimson-Gold Spirit Needles weren't here.

However, this was still a significant breakthrough. As long as they could determine the source of the illusion's projection, they could pinpoint the location of the Crimson-Gold Spirit Needles.

The two exchanged glances, both eyes filled with a glimmer of hope.

Qin Sang realized the Crimson-Gold Spirit Needles weren't nearby and were difficult to reach for the time being, so he decided to give up on going deeper, retreating with Mo Xingdao.

The man and the puppet quickly reached the edge of the Cleansing Platform, concealing themselves within the auspicious clouds and observing the outside world.

Qin Sang had made multiple trips back and forth, never encountering any anomalies, and this time was no different, but he still waited for a year.

Atop the auspicious clouds, he activated his Heavenly Eye divine ability, overlooking the world from above, but detected no Void Refinement celestial phenomena.

He was only worried about Hong Yuzi inviting a Grandmaster.

After a period of observation, Qin Sang tentatively stepped out of the auspicious clouds, immediately changing direction and heading north, making a large detour before turning south.

The journey was smooth, leading him directly to Mount Juzhi.

Now, the situation in the Ghostfang Kingdom had drastically changed. The status of the Demon Gods had steadily risen, especially those who dared to enter the Land of Calamity to gather followers, who were highly revered.

Due to its relationship with the Snake Demon, the Jackal Demon's status in the Demon Kingdom had soared. It was now revered as the National Teacher and possessed numerous estates.

At one of these estates, two strangers had appeared.

Qin Sang waved his hand, dismissing the Jackal Demon, and surveyed the estate, nodding in approval, “This place is secluded. Fellow Daoist Mo, please make yourself comfortable here. I will help you gather the materials for rebuilding your altar. I hope you can recover your strength as soon as possible.”

Mo Xingdao had received Dharma transmissions in the Dao Court.

His original body had perished, but a fragment of his soul remained. Although his altar was destroyed, his Dharma wouldn't be lost, and he could rebuild it.

Returning to the Dao Court was impossible; he could only hide within the Demon Kingdom.

“Words cannot express my gratitude!”

Mo Xingdao bowed deeply, his voice solemn.

Qin Sang smiled at his words.

In a sense, Mo Xingdao was somewhat similar to him, always vigilant and rarely trusting others.

Surely, Mo Xingdao wouldn't utter such words lightly.

Qin Sang hadn't considered demanding repayment for his kindness, treating it as a transaction. Mo Xingdao had already been left far behind by him and was struggling to protect himself. How could he talk about repaying a debt of gratitude?

With his soul fused into a puppet, how much further could he go?

Surely, Mo Xingdao understood this as well, making it difficult for him to express his gratitude.

“Fellow Daoist, there’s no need to thank me yet. We must first establish a Karmic Oath.”

It wasn’t that Qin Sang didn’t trust Mo Xingdao. It was a matter of great importance. This battle involved the upper echelons of both the Ghostfang Kingdom and the Dao Court, demanding utmost caution.

Mo Xingdao immediately agreed, “Indeed, it should be so!”

The two set up an altar, burned incense, and established a Karmic Oath, pledging to cooperate sincerely and search for the path to ascension together.

With the oath complete, Qin Sang cupped his hands and said, “I have other matters to attend to and cannot stay long. We shall meet again!”

“Farewell, Fellow Daoist!”

Mo Xingdao saw Qin Sang off, then surveyed the estate, standing there for a long while.

Outside the estate, Qin Sang gave the Jackal Demon a few instructions, then traveled west alone.  He journeyed without stopping, arriving at Pot Island and the residence of Master Qi.

Upon learning of Qin Sang's visit, Master Qi hurried out of the fire chamber, his face filled with reproach, “Fellow Daoist, you’ve been gone for far too long!”

Qin Sang looked Master Qi over, frowning as if about to say something, but was pulled by the arm and hastily led into the fire chamber.

“These past years, this poor Daoist has been deep in thought and has new ideas. Quickly bring out the Wind Returning Armor,” Master Qi urged Qin Sang impatiently.

Qin Sang sighed, taking out the scroll, “The Wind Returning Armor is destroyed. I’m afraid I’ve wasted Master’s hard work.”

Master Qi was stunned, but instead of being dismayed, he was delighted.  He clapped his hands, “Exactly! This poor Daoist always felt the Wind Returning Armor and the True Treasure fragment weren’t entirely compatible.  I was a bit reckless opening the furnace last time, worried you wouldn’t be willing to part with the treasure.”

He didn't seem to consider the dangers Qin Sang had faced, that even his treasured armor had been destroyed. His mind was completely fixated on the True Treasure fragment.

Master Qi reached for the True Treasure fragment, but Qin Sang stopped him, looking up in confusion. He saw the serious expression on Qin Sang's face.

“Master, are you confident about this tribulation?” Qin Sang asked gravely.

He sensed the aura of a heavenly tribulation emanating from Master Qi.

Hearing this, the fervor on Master Qi's face gradually faded, replaced by a wry smile, “During the last heavenly tribulation, this poor Daoist shamelessly begged for a tribulation-crossing secret technique. I barely survived, essentially gaining three hundred extra years of life.”

Qin Sang's brow furrowed deeply.

He had known Master Qi for many years. The Wind Returning Armor the man had refined for him had repeatedly saved his life, and Qin Sang greatly admired him.

He was relatively young and rarely concerned himself with the Forty-Nine Heavenly Tribulations, having not actively sought out tribulation-crossing treasures.

The tribulation-crossing formation of the Formless Immortal Sect required specific treasures and was designed for the Three Disasters.

Unfortunately, Master Qi was still far from the peak of Nascent Soul late-stage.  The remaining time wasn't enough.

Master Qi admitted to encountering a bottleneck, his cultivation stagnant for many years.

The man was obsessed with refining, likely finding it difficult to cultivate peacefully. Otherwise, transmitting the Heavenly Exquisite Refining Method to him might have given him a chance to reach Deity Transformation.

Master Qi took a deep breath, "Fellow Daoist, do not worry on my behalf. You know this poor Daoist’s ambition. I have no hope of refining a Spirit Treasure in this lifetime. Refining the True Treasure fragment into armor will be enough to console me, allowing me to die without regrets!”

Qin Sang gazed into Master Qi’s eyes, "The Dao Court might have tribulation-crossing treasures passed down. I have accumulated some merit…"

Before he could finish, Master Qi suddenly stood up and bowed deeply without hesitation, "I implore Fellow Daoist to grant my wish!"

Compared to death, he feared dying with regrets!

He would rather spend his remaining time doing everything in his power to create his life’s masterpiece and enter the afterlife with a smile.

Qin Sang remained silent for a long moment, then sighed softly and nodded slightly.

A smile appeared on Master Qi’s face.

“This item will remain at Master’s residence. I await your good news, Master,” Qin Sang personally placed the True Treasure fragment into Master Qi's hands.

“I will not disappoint you, Fellow Daoist,” Master Qi examined the scroll lovingly.  “I will need your assistance when opening the furnace. If Fellow Daoist can wait, it will be thirty years from now.”

“I will follow Master’s arrangements.”

Qin Sang replied, his voice heavy.

Qin Sang remained at Master Qi’s residence, discussing refining techniques with him, encouraging Master Qi to be bold and assuring him that he would handle any difficulties.

More than ten days later, Qin Sang left behind a large quantity of spirit materials and went to Swordheart Island to visit True Person Zhijian.
