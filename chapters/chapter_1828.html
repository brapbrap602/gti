<h1>Chapter 1819: The Green Concubine</h1><p>The cave was apparently a tomb of black bones.</p><p>Suddenly, a cracking sound echoed from within.</p><p>The sound was muffled.</p><p>Qin Sang’s fingers were kneading black powder, the remnants of a crushed black bone.</p><p>The intense poison had seeped into the marrow, causing the bone to completely rot, without a trace of white remaining.</p><p>Bone dust trickled down from his fingertips.</p><p>Qin Sang stared at the jade statue of the old man for a long time, his gaze flickering. Verses from the *Poison God Canon* continuously flashed through his mind.</p><p>This sacred text of poison techniques was incredibly strange.  Ordinary cultivators would avoid it like the plague, but Qin Sang found some inspiration within it, even a daring thought of trying it himself.</p><p>He didn’t know when he had sat down before the altar, eyes closed, contemplating. As his understanding of the *Poison God Canon* deepened, that thought grew stronger.</p><p>The *Poison God Canon* was a complete inheritance, including fundamental cultivation techniques and corresponding divine abilities, numerous poison-controlling arts, a record of myriad poisons, some poison formulas, and most importantly, a secret technique for refining the body with poison.</p><p>The cultivation technique could reach the peak of the late Nascent Soul stage, breaking through the five talisman ranks, thus entering the Void Refinement stage.</p><p>It wasn't a technique that directly pointed to the Dao. The *Poison God Canon* lacked chapters or volumes, possibly because its creator stopped there, unable to further develop it.</p><p>That was understandable; after all, this cultivation method was too extreme, a gamble on life and death.</p><p>The *Sword-Nurturing Chapter of the Primordial Spirit* achieved enlightenment through killing, but with increasing cultivation, the killing intent could be gradually suppressed.  The *Poison God Canon*, however, remained unchanged, the creator seemingly very stubborn.</p><p>The creators of such techniques were all astonishingly talented but faced unimaginable dangers. One wrong step could lead to irreversible ruin.</p><p>Many Grand Masters came from Daoist sects. Qin Sang had met many fellow cultivators in Jushan, and from their conversations, he could only confirm that the Yintian Palace had a Grand Master residing there.</p><p>The creator of the *Poison God Canon*, who reached the Void Refinement stage and left such a complete inheritance, was remarkable, worthy of the title “Poison God.”</p><p>Qin Sang opened his eyes and looked at the jade statue of the old man. Could this be the creator?</p><p>If the black bones were the descendants of the old man, it was normal for them to devoutly bow before their ancestor's statue.</p><p>His mind returned to the *Poison God Canon*.</p><p>He certainly had to try the poison refining technique; his promise to Qing Dan Yuanjun involved this technique as well. Qin Sang was now considering how to utilize the fundamental cultivation technique of the *Poison God Canon*.</p><p>According to the *Poison God Canon*, refining poison into essence, given enough high-grade poisons, would greatly increase cultivation speed.  This was what most attracted Qin Sang.</p><p>Changing cultivation techniques was impossible. Without the seven killing talismans from the *Sword-Nurturing Chapter of the Primordial Spirit*, his cultivation speed would drastically decrease.</p><p>If the *Poison God Canon* was a righteous cultivation technique that pointed directly to the Dao, it would be different.  Taking the path of poison, even if temporarily advantageous, had an uncertain future. A simple cost-benefit analysis would show it to be detrimental.</p><p>So, could he borrow the essence of the *Poison God Canon* and adapt it for his own use?</p><p>The core principle of the *Poison God Canon* was to absorb intense poisons, transforming them into poison essence, to rapidly increase cultivation.</p><p>Through studying the technique, Qin Sang found that the fundamental principle of this technique revolved around refining poison into essence, which essentially relied on external substances for cultivation.</p><p>Qin Sang's plan was to extract only the part about refining poison into essence and integrate it into his own technique, using it selectively.</p><p>Qin Sang had done this before; the *Celestial Demon Transformation* technique abandoned the parts related to demonic bloodlines, forcing cultivation regardless.</p><p>Without cultivating the complete technique, the poison-related divine abilities would be unusable, but this wasn't important; as long as it aided Qin Sang’s cultivation, it was enough.</p><p>Furthermore, the *Poison God Canon*’s technique was certainly meticulously created for poison essence, making it the most compatible. Without using this technique, there would inevitably be discordance, and the poison essence might not be easily controlled, becoming a hidden danger, or even causing true essence disorder and shaking his foundation.</p><p>The *Sword-Nurturing Chapter of the Primordial Spirit* had one special characteristic: born from the path of killing, the technique was formless but all-encompassing, which is why Qin Sang had this idea. Even if the technique couldn’t fully control the poison essence, he could use the power of the poison bead to suppress it.</p><p>Qin Sang dared to consider this despite the risks of the *Poison God Canon*.</p><p>Firstly, he saw a real possibility, and the prospect was very tempting.</p><p>Secondly, he had confidence in minimizing the risks.</p><p>The poison bead could suppress the poison for him, extending the time before it manifested.</p><p>After absorbing the sacred object from the Poisonous Mountain and restoring the Bloodthirsty miasma spirit, Qin Sang confirmed that the poison pearl grows with the consumption of superior poisons, and it's not yet reached its limit.</p><p>This also shows how unfathomable the fat silkworm's talent is; a single separated poison pearl is so extraordinary.</p><p>His body underwent dual refinement—celestial body refinement and poison tempering—leading to an unimaginable increase in strength.</p><p>Even if his cultivation doesn't reach the Void Refinement stage in time, a breakthrough in his physical body alone can resolve the crisis.  The *Poison God Scripture* clearly states that a breakthrough in either physical body or true essence can avert danger.</p><p>Securing sufficient merit for the Daoist sect will allow him to enlist a Grand Master to perform a ritual to infuse his body with stellar energy; this is not a concern.</p><p>Moreover, if the poison tempering is as miraculous as the secret technique describes, the requirement for stellar energy might even be lower.</p><p>The biggest limitation of the *Poison God Scripture* is finding enough superior poisons—something Qin Sang doesn't lack.</p><p>The vast flower field outside has accumulated countless drops of flower essence.  It would be a waste not to utilize them properly.</p><p>Thinking this, Qin Sang had an idea, rose, and left the cave.</p><p>'Creak...'</p><p>The stone door opened, and Qin Sang stepped out.</p><p>The unfamiliar aura immediately alerted the flower spirits, and countless cocoons rose from the flower buds.</p><p>Qin Sang then made a strange hand seal, pressing it against his chest, instantly altering his aura.</p><p>In an instant, the flower field returned to calm. The gently trembling cocoons ceased to open, slowly sinking back into the flower buds as the spirits returned to slumber.</p><p>He had used a technique from the *Poison God Scripture* to mask his aura, making him appear as one of them.  Cultivating these poisonous flowers requires this technique.</p><p>Seeing the technique's success, Qin Sang nodded silently, stealthily flying to a mountaintop and circling the edge of the area to observe the formation, avoiding any flower spirits along the way.</p><p>The flower fields varied in quality; the two deepest sections were superior fields.</p><p>Qin Sang approached the two superior flower fields, gazing at the peak that had previously repelled him.</p><p>According to the *Poison God Scripture*, this location can be considered a key point of the flower field, with a special function.</p><p>Mass cultivation of these poisonous flowers has a hidden danger.</p><p>If the flower essence isn't collected promptly, it will fuse with resentment, birthing flower fairies within the flower spirits.</p><p>The flower fairies are the evil spirits Qin Sang had slain.</p><p>The *Poison God Scripture*'s techniques can only deceive the flower spirits, not the flower fairies.</p><p>Flower fairies are inherently imbued with deep resentment, incapable of being pacified, and are inherently cruel, killing any living being they encounter, posing a danger to the owner of the flower fields.</p><p>To prevent powerful flower fairies from appearing and usurping the field, a special arrangement was made. If the flower essence remains uncollected for a long time, it flows to the key point.</p><p>Black bones—unknown how long they've been there—continuously pour in, making it impossible to imagine how much essence has accumulated in the key point.</p><p>Thick poison emanates from the key point, enveloping the mountain peak. Qin Sang sensed the danger from afar and didn't dare approach.</p><p>The key point won't birth flower fairies and won't affect the flower field for now. Qin Sang decided to leave it for later when he was better equipped.</p><p>He took out the pearl, turning it over in his hand.</p><p>The pearl appears pure, but in reality, it's imbued with astonishing resentment, unsuitable for cultivation.</p><p>Refining the pearl would yield a large amount of poison essence, but would also affect the mind with resentment, leading to personality changes.</p><p>Therefore, the timing of collecting the essence is crucial; only the purest essence should be collected.</p><p>As long as only pure essence is used, there should be no risk of resentment affecting one.</p><p>"Poisonous flowers, flower spirits, flower fairies..."</p><p>Qin Sang murmured these words.</p><p>Does truly pure flower essence not cause personality changes?</p><p>Qin Sang turned toward the flower field.</p><p>The flowers swayed, so vibrant and beautiful.</p><p>The *Poison God Scripture* states that the name of this flower is "flower spirit," referring to the flower itself, not a spirit, and lacking sentience.</p><p>But these poisonous flowers are too strange, capable of birthing flower fairies, suggesting the possibility of sentience. Qin Sang didn't fully trust the record.</p><p>Is the essence nourished by resentment truly pure?  Are there unknown dangers hidden within the cultivation method?</p><p>For instance, the White Jade Elder wasn't the creator, but the statue of an evil god.</p><p>Cultivating the *Poison God Scripture* eventually leads to being consumed by resentment, transforming one into a believer and offering of the evil god.</p><p>Qin Sang sneered. Resentment undoubtedly affects the primordial spirit.  If the *Poison God Scripture* is a trap laid by the evil god, it has targeted the wrong person.</p><p>Of course, Qin Sang hasn't yet found any evidence related to the evil god; it's just speculation.</p><p>The jade Buddha gave Qin Sang the courage to try, but he wouldn't be reckless.</p><p>Qin Sang had a plan forming in his mind.</p><p>First, I will refine the Bloodthirsty miasma poison, confirming my ability to cultivate the Poison Yuan, then refine the orb, ensuring the jade Buddha can dispel resentment, thus allowing me to cultivate with peace of mind.</p><p>Qin Sang surveyed the entire space. If everything goes as planned, this place will be his launchpad, using these flower fields to reach unimaginable heights in a very short time.</p><p>Compared to cultivators of the same level, he is young and shouldn't rush, but to find the path to ascension before the Daoist sect, he must improve his strength quickly.</p><p>Moreover, since he's gotten this opportunity, after weighing the gains and risks, there's no reason to miss it.</p><p>Time is never wasted; an earlier breakthrough increases the chances of achieving the Dao.</p><p>As for the pain of refining poison into Yuan and tempering the body with poison, Qin Sang doesn't mind.  What pain could compare to becoming a corpse puppet?</p><p>Thinking this, Qin Sang eagerly wanted to return to his cave abode, but first, he had to do one thing.</p><p>He flashed across the space, landing on the peak of a mountain in the center, sat cross-legged, and spread his spiritual sense, sensing the entire array.</p><p>Moments later, the mountain trembled, a booming sound echoing through the mountains.</p><p>Above the heavens, in all directions of space, the distorted power of the spirit array violently vibrated, forming a storm that swept towards the sky.</p><p>To the naked eye, it looked like someone was wielding a brush in the heavens.</p><p>Qin Sang was extremely busy, his ten fingers continuously striking, his true essence pouring out, transforming into talismans flying in all directions.</p><p>This was to repair the spirit array.</p><p>Time passed, the spirit array deformed, exposing the flower fields. Qin Sang now needed to reseal the space, preventing others from entering and claiming the flower fields for himself.</p><p>The external phenomenon was more violent than inside the space.</p><p>Where the palace once stood, howling winds spread outward, the mist groups collapsing, giving birth to new whirlwinds that swept across all directions.</p><p>This wasn't simple wind; it was infused with poisonous mist.  Large patches of green flowers bloomed in the gale, then shattered, a cycle of life and death, signifying the void was about to break.</p><p>At that moment, outside the poison lake, Qing Dan Yuanjun and Boxian Shanren, one seated and one standing, had just taken medicine, taking turns healing and detoxifying.</p><p>They keenly sensed the changes in the poison lake.  Qing Dan Yuanjun, who was seated, abruptly stood up, exchanged a glance with Boxian Shanren, and immediately returned to the poison lake.</p><p>Passing through the outer layer of poisonous water, they immediately saw a huge mass of mist, filled with extremely chaotic energy, mixed with poisonous prohibitions, rapidly spreading outward.</p><p>The two masters looked extremely serious.</p><p>Before the change, Qin Sang might have had a glimmer of hope, but with the collapse of the poison lake's interior, Qin Sang, at the center of the collapse, had no chance of survival.</p><p>Unless a miracle occurred.</p><p>Even if they risked their lives and entered the mist, they might not even find a body.</p><p>After a long silence, Boxian Shanren sighed, "Luckily, the friend obtained that spirit tree, but unfortunately, Qingfeng Daochang..."</p><p>Qing Dan Yuanjun also sighed, "Neither alive nor dead, how can I explain this to the Swordsman Zhenren?"</p><p>As far as they knew, Qingfeng Daochang was a lone individual, with no disciples, but Swordsman Zhenren valued him greatly, even opening a cave dwelling for him in his own sect.</p><p>Inside the flower field.</p><p>Qin Sang looked up, saw the two masters retreating from the poison lake through the spirit array, and cast several prohibitions into the array.</p><p>He withdrew his gaze, scanned the flower field, and noticed that some flower dew was ripe for harvesting.</p><p>He took a jade bottle from his storage ring, moved to a flower field, and hovered above a spirit flower.</p><p>The spirit flower was enormous.</p><p>Its pistil was like a silver basin.</p><p>The flower spirit was sleeping in the pistil. Qin Sang extended his right hand, his palm exhaling true essence, transforming into a long, transparent needle.</p><p>He gently inserted the needle tip.</p><p>As if in pain, the spirit flower's pistil suddenly contracted, its petals trembling, before slowly unfolding again.</p><p>Qin Sang withdrew the needle and flew to the next plant.</p><p>As he harvested more and more spirit flowers, a drop of crystalline liquid gradually condensed on the needle tip—pure flower dew, pure flower poison!</p><p>He collected the drop into the bottle.</p><p>Qin Sang worked like a bee among flowers, busy in the fields, finally reaching two premium flower fields.</p><p>The quality of the flower dew produced by different flower fields was similar; only fewer spirit flowers were needed to condense a drop of dew from the premium fields.</p><p>His movements became more skilled, quickly harvesting all the flower dew.  With a wave of his hand, the jade bottles floated before him.</p><p>Qin Sang smiled slightly, and put them all away. Then he returned to his cave abode.</p><p>He then used his spiritual sense to examine the jade tablet of the White Jade Elder, read the Poison God Canon several times, memorized it, and sat still.</p><p>The time was unknown inside the poison lake.</p><p>Undisturbed, Qin Sang didn't know how long he had been in meditation before he finally began.</p><p>The poison pearl flew out of his dantian, a light of anti-poison flashed, carrying a wisp of intense poison.</p><p>Qin Sang took a deep breath and inhaled it!</p>
