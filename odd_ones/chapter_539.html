      Boom!
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Nagakin’s spaceship collided with a hundred-meter-long DarkStar
                spaceship. Violent vibrations shook both ships, and the door in
                front of Nagakin was slammed open, exposing his entire person
                into the cosmic environment. The Godoran combat uniform
                immediately reacted, providing a suitable environment for
                survival.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Shortly after, a raging golden flame ignited around Nagakin’s
                body and blasted off behind him, acting as a propeller. Nagakin
                resembled a golden meteor as he viciously slammed into the outer
                shell of the DarkStar battleship.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      When comparing the size of a hundred-meter-long battleship to a
                human, it looked like an ant going against an elephant.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      However, the strength revealed by this one fist actually left a
                deep depression right in the tough outer armor of the DarkStar
                battleship!
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      A continuous barrage of punches rained down, the shadows of the
                punches blurring into one. The next second, Nagakin had forcibly
                created an opening in the DarkStar battleship. A large number of
                metal fragments burst out, and Nagakin strode into the ship,
                clad in a golden flame.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Boom!
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      The DarkStar ship began to continuously tremor as Nagakin ran
                rampant within, destroying the DarkStar battleship from the
                inside. None of the DarkStar warriors present were able to
                obstruct him, as though he was in an unmanned environment. All
                the equipment and devices were smashed into smithereens, and in
                a chain reaction, more and more parts were paralyzed.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Very quickly, Nagakin rushed out again, jumping into his
                spaceship to leave this battleship, seeking his next target.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Behind him, the battleship that was riddled with holes suddenly
                exploded, becoming a series of fireworks in the universe!
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      In such space warfare, the strongest Supers usually acted as the
                vanguard of their troops, initiating the battle through
                destroying the insides of the enemy’s battleships. Rarely did
                both sides collide head on with each other. After all, the
                danger of attempting to destroy each other’s battleships was too
                great, and the efficiency could not match that of destroying the
                battleships internally… Of course, the standard did not include
                those Beyond Grade A Supers.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      …
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      The remaining Godoran troops responded to Barette’s commands to
                retreat and prepared to rejoin the main force. Nakapu was able
                to quickly perceive the general idea of Barette’s strategy and
                responded. He split up the strike force once again, with a large
                portion in pursuit of Barette’s retreating troops to prevent the
                incident of being pincered by the enemy.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Thus, there were only thirty assault ships left to attack Planet
                Aquamarine. While Black Star never made a move in the end,
                Nakapu still calculated his strength into the equation, leaving
                sufficient troops according to his judgement.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Without the protection of the Godoran fleet, Planet Aquamarine
                resembled a delicate and frail lady. The thirty DarkStar assault
                ships entered the atmosphere, spraying cannon fire toward the
                surface of the planet.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Boom!
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Cluster after cluster of green colored ion cannon rays fell like
                lightning, constantly bombarding the surface.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Those assault ships did not just fire randomly but rather aimed
                in the direction of the Six Nations and the Sanctuaries. Their
                objective was to destroy these sites, spoiling the disaster
                relief efforts.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Han Xiao had earlier allowed dozens of mercenaries to utilize
                their spaceships to protect those places. At this time, they
                opened up their shields, blocking the descending ion cannon
                rays.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Boom!
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Sounds of explosion rang among the clouds, with the shields of
                the spaceships being besieged to the point where they could not
                differentiate night from day. The shields continuously grew
                weaker.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Many of the refugee players were unable to see the spaceships
                that were situated at a high altitude, but they were able to see
                the green ion cannon rays flying over their sanctuaries. The
                rays streamed down continuously, akin to a deluge of lightning,
                and the roar from the cannons painted a sign as though an
                apocalypse was imminent.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      This scene gave many players a huge surprise, causing them to
                burst out in discussion.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “Is this a fleet that’s attacking us‽”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “F*ck, the progress bar of our mission is decreasing. Is it
                because we’re being attacked!”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “If not for all these spaceships shielding us, I think we would
                all be blasted to death!”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      As for the actual refugees in the Six Nations and the
                Sanctuaries, they did not possess the natural assurance of
                safety like the players. Every explosion caused by the ion
                cannon rays seemed to strike straight into their hearts, scaring
                them witless. Their faces were white as paper, and they only
                thought of rushing to escape. The scene was a complete mess.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Han Xiao had already entered his BlackLight Stealth, and the
                Mercenary Group had also gathered on the battleship. Everyone
                wore a solemn expression. Now that the Godoran troops had gone
                in pursuit of the enemy, the remaining enemy battleships had to
                be dealt with by them.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Having long known that the Godorans were not reliable, Han Xiao
                had not held many expectations toward them. As such, he did not
                feel disappointed and only shook his head in response.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “It’s hard to rely on anyone in this day and age. You can only
                rely on your two hands!” Sylvia observed, speaking hurriedly.
                “There are thirty small DarkStar assault ships attacking. Based
                on the current firepower, our shields can still hold for a few
                minutes. We have to get rid of the enemies in this time, or else
                the Sanctuaries will suffer huge damage.”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Han Xiao nodded in response. Only his BlackLight Stealth could
                allow him to go against the enemies, so if he wished to end the
                battle quickly, he would need to enter their battleships,
                wreaking havoc from within. However, the firepower of the
                assault ships was fierce, and to get close, even with his
                BlackLight Stealth, there was still a certain amount of danger.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      <em class="calibre7">
       Thankfully, I did the Class Advancement for the Virtual
                  Technology route. If the hardware is insufficient, then I
                  shall make it up through the software!
      </em>
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “Ginette, take control of the spaceship. Sylvia, assist as the
                deputy.”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      In order to maintain the combat capability of the mercenaries,
                Han Xiao decided to let others control the spaceship.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Han Xiao turned and opened an operation panel next to him. A 3D
                virtual model was generated in front of his eyes, and his
                fingers danced as he quickly inputted a flood of data. The data
                flowed like a waterfall, invading the intelligence network of
                the enemy’s spacecraft through their virtual network. Because of
                his class [Virtual Mechanic], he was proficient in this aspect
                of technology since it gave him high skill bonuses.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      All Virtual Mechanics possessed a data transmitter that did not
                require any hardware connections to be able to connect to the
                intelligence of a spaceship. They could be directly connected to
                any target system as long as they were within range of the
                transmitter.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      As Han Xiao manipulated the data, he commanded, “Risda, help me
                crack the firewall!”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Although this should be Phillip’s task, Risda’s processing
                efficiency was higher than Phillip’s, and the help that he could
                offer would be greater.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      As Han Xiao proceeded with the data invasion, the BlackLight
                Stealth launched. Due to its powerful engine, the spaceship
                quickly reached the sky, circling around the thirty DarkStar
                assault ships as it rained down gunfire.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Boom boom boom!
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Numerous lasers hit the shields of the enemy ships but were
                unable to pierce through.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      The assault ships also fired a few potshots in the direction of
                the BlackLight Stealth, but they were helpless against the high
                specs of the BlackLight Stealth. The commander saw that there
                was only one spaceship, and since it could not break through
                their shields, they allowed it to remain like a fly buzzing
                around their heads as they concentrated their fire on the ground
                below.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Through the satellites, the top brass of the Six Nations watched
                the battle unfold in the sky with bated breath.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Because Godora was not reliable, the last line of defense on
                Planet Aquamarine was Black Star. However, it looked like he was
                unable to stop the advance of the enemy. In the underground
                fortress where the top brass of the Six Nations hid, a sense of
                despair slowly suffused.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      At this point, a shield on one of the assault ships suddenly
                flickered and vanished. The next moment, the laser of the
                BlackLight Stealth accurately hit the hull of the ship, piercing
                through the armor and causing it to explode.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Bang!
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Flames roared toward the sky, and black smoke billowed as the
                assault ship suddenly lost control. Its tail swayed, ramming
                into its companion. The DarkStar members in both ships tumbled
                till they could not differentiate the ground from the sky.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “It hit!”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      The top brass of the Six Nations suddenly felt their spirits
                being renewed!
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      On the BlackLight Stealth, the virtual interface in front of Han
                Xiao had changed to a projection of the DarkStar assault ship.
                This was the one that they had succeeded in destroying.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Han Xiao was controlling the projection, which would feed the
                response directly back to the assault ship’s main body. He was
                the one who had turned off the shield generator of the assault
                ship.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “Done!”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      The corners of Han Xiao’s mouth curved up, and he took a look at
                the interface as messages flowed out repeatedly.
