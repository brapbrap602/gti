<h1>Chapter 1537:  Zhulans Temple (4k)</h1><p>Traveling along the way.</p><p>The Abbot heard that Qin Sang had come from afar, seemingly wishing to discuss Buddhist principles with him.</p><p>The ultimate truths of the world, the Dao and Buddhism, share common ground.</p><p>But Buddhist doctrinal debates have their own set of rules.</p><p>After entering the Western Desert, Qin Sang had learned the essence of Buddhism, and could manage to cope. He disguised himself as a lay believer, not a wandering monk, fabricating this explanation for that very reason.</p><p>Abbot Sengyan, having listened, understood that Qin Sang wasn't a true lay follower of Buddhism, and wouldn't have overly high expectations of him.</p><p>"Recently, I heard that a lay believer has been performing devout worship in the瀚海, their demeanor most respectful.  I presume it must be Lay Believer Mingyue," Sengyan countered, "Since Lay Believer Mingyue has had a change of heart, intending to atone for their karmic transgressions, why not choose a temple and take refuge in the Buddha?"</p><p>"This humble one fears that worldly affairs remain unsettled, and would disturb this sacred place."</p><p>Qin Sang replied respectfully.</p><p>Sengyan, upon hearing this, shook his head subtly, believing he had seen through Qin Sang's intentions.</p><p>This person's worship and atonement were likely a pretense; it's true that he's encountered a bottleneck in his cultivation, and having made no progress through rigorous practice, is seeking a breakthrough through Buddhism.</p><p>The Buddhist Kingdom of the Sand Sea, countless Buddhist disciples.</p><p>Such situations were commonplace.</p><p>Some even directly took monastic vows, completely changing their allegiances and cultivating Buddhist techniques, yet in reality holding not a shred of respect for the Buddha.</p><p>However, even among the true Buddhist masters, how many are truly devout followers of the Buddha? Otherwise, how could they fail to refute a brazen individual calling themselves a 'Bodhisattva'?</p><p>If it weren't for the fact that many Buddhist cultivation methods and supernatural powers could be verified through Buddhist scriptures, and even potentially provide opportunities for advancement, people wouldn't even bother opening the scriptures.</p><p>Sengyan longed to change the atmosphere within Buddhism, but knew his power was too little, sighing inwardly. He didn't expose Qin Sang. "Lay Believer Mingyue, having journeyed from the Three Thousand Buddhist Kingdoms, what is your opinion of the Moonlight Bodhisattva?"</p><p>Saying this, Sengyan subconsciously glanced at Qin Sang.</p><p>One Mingyue, one Moonlight—what a coincidence.</p><p>"This humble one dares not speak rashly, but understands only this: Regardless of the Moonlight Bodhisattva's origins, if they understand Buddhist principles and possess Buddhist nature, then they are a most venerable teacher, and this humble one looks up to them with aspiration."</p><p>Qin Sang cleverly replied.</p><p>Sengyan was speechless, standing rigidly for a while before snapping out of it, bowing deeply to Qin Sang.  "Thanks to Lay Believer Mingyue's enlightenment, it is this poor monk who was attached to appearances!"</p><p>Qin Sang was at a loss for words. He wasn't interested in Sengyan's thoughts, only wanting to steer the conversation toward Yin Chan Temple as quickly as possible.</p><p>With this move, Sengyan became even more enthusiastic towards Qin Sang, even claiming that Qin Sang possessed innate Buddhist nature. "Lay Believer Mingyue, if you don't wish to take monastic vows, you may stay temporarily at the temple for a few days of practice. This poor monk wishes to have a heart-to-heart talk with you."</p><p>Hearing this, Qin Sang's heart stirred, and after feigning hesitation, nodded in agreement.</p><p>For a period of time afterwards, Qin Sang remained unchanged in his behavior. He would go out in the mornings to various temples, meticulously burning incense and worshipping the Buddha, returning to Beishan Temple in the evenings.</p><p>Every evening at lamp-lighting time, Abbot Sengyan would come to find him, to discuss scriptures and Buddhist principles.</p><p>Sengyan was a true believer, something quite rare among the Buddhist cultivators Qin Sang had encountered during this time.</p><p>Initially, Qin Sang was simply going along with Sengyan, waiting for the right moment to inquire about Yin Chan Temple.</p><p>After a few days, Qin Sang found himself increasingly interested, even beginning to diligently study Buddhist scriptures.</p><p>He had achieved his current level of cultivation through strong willpower; there was no way he would genuinely convert to Buddhism. The reason was that he discovered that studying Buddhist scriptures seemed to benefit the Seven Masters' Buddha Seal.</p><p>He had already mastered the first four seals of the Seven Masters' Buddha Seal, and now, upon rereading them, he realized that there were many subtleties he had overlooked.</p><p>The Seven Masters' Buddha Seal wasn't simply a killing technique; it was subtly related to Buddhist principles. The four seals he had 'completed' echoed each other, and the order of their arrangement held hidden meanings.</p><p>To this end, Qin Sang borrowed the Buddhist scriptures treasured by Beishan Temple from Abbot Sengyan, and practically read them all.</p><p>He certainly hadn't forgotten the true purpose of his trip.</p><p>After patient groundwork, he naturally brought the conversation to Yin Chan Temple.</p><p>"While worshipping the Buddha today, I inadvertently heard a certain master mention a secret story," Qin Sang said with a curious expression, "Many years ago, the 瀚海 was not bathed in Buddhist light. A great and virtuous monk came here alone, establishing the first Buddhist temple, propagating the Buddhist faith and saving all beings. I wonder which sacred temple that was?"</p><p>Sengyan smiled. "The sacred temple Lay Believer Mingyue speaks of is Yin Chan Temple. That great and virtuous monk was Venerable Hongyi. Yin Chan Temple is now Zhu Lan Temple."</p><p>Qin Sang was taken aback. "Why the name change?"</p><p>Venerable Hongyi was the virtuous monk who left behind the bone relic of the Buddha.</p><p>This Venerable wasn't the same as the Venerable from the Canglang Sea Merchant Alliance. It's a Buddhist honorific for Yuan Ying cultivators.</p><p>Zhulans Temple is currently the first of the Seven Stars of the瀚海, and it originally inherited the lineage of Yin Chan Temple.</p><p>It was surprisingly easy information for him to miss before.</p><p>“He didn’t change his name.”</p><p>Seng Yan shook his head.  “Master Hongyi’s original dharma name was Dao Yu.  He practiced at Zhulan Temple from a young age, achieving great skill. He traveled widely, witnessing the rampant evil in the Hanhai region and made a great vow to help its people escape suffering.  Because the evil forces were so powerful, Master Hongyi feared bringing disaster to his monastic order, so he concealed his identity and built Yin Chan Temple. Later, after he had established himself, Zhulan Temple was pressured by strong enemies, so he moved the monks to Hanhai.”</p><p>Seng Yan spoke of Master Hongyi with undisguised admiration. “Master Hongyi once said that merit lies in one's heart and actions, not in empty fame. In his later years, he resumed his original dharma name, living a simple life until his passing. Only after the power of Zhulan Temple's great enemy waned did they restore the name ‘Zhulan Temple,’ and later built a stupa for Master Hongyi within the temple grounds.  Zhulan Temple holds a Dharma Assembly every ten years. Initially, it was to commemorate Master Hongyi, but now it’s become a venue for disciples from various temples to show off their martial prowess.”</p><p>Qin Sang understood, thinking, “So that’s how it was.”</p><p>When Xiao Xiangzi initially discovered the bone relic, Zhulan Temple was still called Yin Chan Temple.</p><p>Seng Yan got one thing wrong; Master Hongyi didn’t die of natural causes.</p><p>Xiao Xiangzi analyzed that Master Hongyi likely perished during a failed attempt to break through to the late Yuan Ying stage, leaving behind the bone relic.</p><p>Logically, even if Master Hongyi’s failed breakthrough left behind a special relic, it shouldn’t help others break through the same barrier.</p><p>However, Xiao Xiangzi discovered something unusual about the bone relic, suspecting that Master Hongyi used some Buddhist treasure during his breakthrough. Upon his death, the relic and the treasure unexpectedly fused, forming the unique bone relic.</p><p>This relic is irreplaceable.</p><p>Zhulan Temple built a stupa for Master Hongyi.</p><p>Could the bone relic be enshrined within the stupa?</p><p>Qin Sang was secretly delighted, realizing he’d finally found a lead.  He continued his inquiries, learning that the next Dharma Assembly would be in two years. On the day of the assembly, disciples from all temples could enter Zhulan Temple, possibly providing an opportunity to approach the stupa—the perfect time to observe.</p><p>He and Liuli had traveled a great distance; waiting two more years was insignificant.</p><p>After learning this, Qin Sang didn’t stop his Buddhist practices, steadily progressing from oasis to oasis, maintaining his respectful demeanor.</p><p>A year later…</p><p>Qin Sang finally reached the largest oasis where Zhulan Temple was located.</p><p>Zhulan Temple was built on a lakeside mountain.</p><p>The temples stretched across the landscape, serene and majestic.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, Zhulan Temple wasn’t as relaxed as Bei Shan Temple.  Outside monks could worship and stay temporarily, but were only allowed in the front temple; the back mountain was forbidden territory.</p><p>The stupa was on the back mountain.</p><p>According to Qin Sang’s investigations, Zhulan Temple had three venerable masters; Cheng Yuan Venerable was at the mid-Yuan Ying stage. This venerable master practiced seated meditation year-round and hadn’t left Zhulan Temple for many years.  Whether his cultivation had advanced further was unknown.</p><p>One mid-Yuan Ying, two early Yuan Ying—Qin Sang felt he and Liuli could handle them.</p><p>The most troublesome thing was Zhulan Temple’s protective spirit array.</p><p>When Qin Sang entered Zhulan Temple to worship, the array was routinely active. Even without its full power, he could sense its extraordinary nature.</p><p>Buddhist spirit arrays differed significantly from the formations he learned at Yuan Shen Gate, particularly in their defensive capabilities.</p><p>The stupa, forbidden territory, was at the heart of the array.</p><p>Infiltrating the forbidden zone, retrieving the bone relic, and escaping unscathed while facing the attack of three venerable masters required careful planning.</p><p>If they couldn’t escape in time, they would face the combined assault of experts from various temples!</p><p>After a brief observation of Zhulan Temple's layout, Qin Sang returned to Bei Shan Temple, awaiting the opportune moment while deepening his study of Buddhist scriptures. His skill in the "Seven Master Buddha Seal" showed significant progress.</p><p>He didn’t agree with Seng Yan’s philosophy, but he respected anyone with unwavering commitment, even if Seng Yan’s cultivation was far inferior to his own.</p><p>Without revealing his identity, he sometimes subtly offered advice. Abbot Seng Yan didn’t notice it immediately, but would discover its value as his cultivation deepened.</p><p>The Dharma Assembly arrived as scheduled.</p><p>Zhulan Temple opened its gates widely, holding the assembly on the back mountain—a perfect opportunity to approach the stupa.</p><p>Abbot Seng Yan disliked this kind of assembly, so he ordered a junior disciple to lead the temple’s top disciples to Zhulan Temple. Qin Sang secured a place in the group.</p><p>The assembly’s procedure was extremely tedious.</p><p>It was said that previous assemblies featured both scripture debates and martial competitions, equally important.  Temples from the Hanhai region would offer treasures as prizes to encourage the winning disciples.</p><p>Later, martial competitions became the focus, while scripture debates were neglected and considered incredibly boring, with some even suggesting their abolishment.</p><p>Qin Sang understood these Buddhist disciples.</p><p>In this era, achieving the Transcendence stage was incredibly difficult; stagnation meant death.</p><p>How many dare risk their spiritual practice, distracting themselves to delve into the elusive Buddhist doctrines?</p><p>The Buddhist scriptures speak of karma, reincarnation, and the Pure Land, beliefs held by the common folk, yet questioned by practitioners.</p><p>Ascension to immortality, at least according to legends, exists only on the thin pages of scriptures; the Buddha's miracles are unheard of.</p><p>Those who achieve enlightenment and significant progress from studying scriptures are rare, appearing perhaps once a millennium.</p><p>Frankly, contemporary cultivators are of low caliber. The techniques and abilities they access do not reach the core principles of Buddhist teachings.</p><p>Qin Sang, a novice, with a few years of studying Buddhist scriptures, has enough knowledge to understand the first four seals of the "Seven Master Buddha Seals."</p><p>Of course, the remaining three seals are beyond his current capabilities for now.</p><p>Currently, the controversy stirred by Moonlight Bodhisattva is escalating.  This person possesses unparalleled eloquence, refuting countless so-called eminent monks. As long as this person retains the title of Bodhisattva, Buddhism will remain disgraced.</p><p>Therefore, this Dharma assembly is unlike any before, with the debate receiving unprecedented attention.</p><p>The Dharma assembly is in full swing.</p><p>Qin Sang finds an opportunity and slips away from the assembly, effortlessly locating the stupa complex.</p><p>Behind Zhurang Temple, stupas stand like a forest, each enshrining the remains of past monks.</p><p>"Amitabha."</p><p>As Qin Sang approaches the stupa complex, a monk appears, blocking his path.</p><p>The monk’s expression clearly indicates refusal of passage.</p><p>"Greetings, Master," Qin Sang calmly bows, explaining his purpose. "This disciple, having heard of the meritorious deeds of Senior Monk Hongyi, feels profound respect.  I understand there's a stupa for Senior Monk Hongyi here. I wish to offer incense before it. Would the Master grant me passage?"</p><p>Qin Sang observes his surroundings.</p><p>Although the stupa complex is a sacred area, the guarding monks are only at the early Golden Core stage.  Unlike a true treasure vault, this place is primarily for memorial purposes.</p><p>However, this doesn't mean it's easily accessible.</p><p>During the Dharma assembly, the temple's protective array is fully activated, providing strong protection to the stupa complex.</p><p>From outside, the complex glows brilliantly, the stupas' tops radiating a dazzling Buddha light.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang's respectful demeanor and sincerity, the monk softens, replying gently, "This lay devotee is kind. The stupa complex is restricted; entry is forbidden without the Abbot's authorization. You may offer incense outside to show your sincerity.  That stupa there was built for Master Daoyou..."</p><p>The monk points towards a stupa in the center of the complex.</p><p>Qin Sang has already awakened his Sky Eye Butterfly, his gaze sweeping across the stupas.</p><p>The stupas serve as repositories for the relics of the temple's high monks.</p><p>Through the Buddha light atop the stupas, he sees some enshrining relics, while others hold bowls, robes, or prayer beads—personal belongings of the monks.</p><p>Though mundane objects, they are imbued with extraordinary significance.</p><p>Following the monk's gesture, Qin Sang sees a white relic in the depths of the Buddha light.</p><p>The relic is oval, pure white, seemingly indistinguishable from others.</p><p>Zhurang Temple has enshrined this relic for years without discovering its unique properties; the naked eye wouldn't reveal any unusual characteristics.</p><p>The color is right.</p><p>But to verify its authenticity, he must hold it and use the secret technique taught by Xiao Xiangzi.</p><p>Qin Sang thinks: Would Zhurang Temple go to such lengths to replace a common relic with a fake?  Wouldn't that defeat the purpose of enshrinement?</p><p>He follows the monk to the incense burner, completes the ritual, and considers the possibility of seizing the relic now.</p><p>During the Dharma assembly, Zhurang Temple is highly vigilant.  Monks from other temples are also present, making his and Liuli's preparations inadequate.</p><p>He only has one chance.</p><p>If his purpose is revealed, the temple's elders will realize the relic's true value.</p><p>After assessment, Qin Sang concludes that the chances are slim.</p><p>Upon learning that the temple elders' meditation halls are behind the stupa complex, on a cliff face, Qin Sang abandons the idea of acting now.</p><p>Breaking through the array would be slower than the three elders acting together.</p><p>The three elders, without needing to defeat him, could simply delay him with the array while taking the relics, leaving him empty-handed.</p><p>Qin Sang, under the guise of admiring Senior Monk Hongyi's deeds, engages the monk in conversation, secretly using his celestial eye to record the array's operational patterns for later analysis.</p><p>As the Dharma assembly concludes...</p><p>Qin Sang leaves Zhurang Temple with the crowd and meets with Liuli that night, explaining the situation.</p>
