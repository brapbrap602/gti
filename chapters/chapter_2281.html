<h1>Chapter 2271: The True Thunder's Difference</h1><p>A soul contract binds souls; unless willingly broken, even the most powerful beings cannot undo it.  </p><p>For instance, even though the Immortal Emperor, Little Yellow Chicken, was only a God King at the time, the Emperor couldn't dissolve the contract he had with the Undead Emperor.</p><p>To prevent betrayal and backlash, the Master Continent established a rule: even if someone transcends the Heavenly Dao Scroll, they cannot escape a soul contract!</p><p>"Soul contracts can't be severed from the sea of consciousness, but I've integrated a special energy that can even dissolve the Heavenly Dao.  Breaking this contract isn't hard…with enough power, bombarding the contract's location will do it!"</p><p>The ruthless cultivator said.</p><p>Soul contracts are based on the Heavenly Dao.  A special power that can dissolve even the divine realm's Heavenly Dao can easily dissolve a soul contract—if handled correctly.</p><p>"I see…" Zhang Xuan's eyes flickered.</p><p>"I've explained this much as thanks for bringing me to the Divine Realm!"</p><p>After the explanation, the ruthless cultivator said no more. Their aura grew increasingly ancient and profound, the black hole behind them expanding.  They were clearly absorbing more power to bolster themselves.</p><p>"Zhang Xuan, the more the black hole absorbs, the stronger he gets…"</p><p>Luo Ruoxi sensed something was wrong and urgently transmitted a message.</p><p>"Prepare to attack!" With his doubts resolved, Zhang Xuan took a deep breath, raising his long sword: "Then let's settle this!"</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>His most powerful sword intent unleashed.</p><p>To live, is to return; to die, is to yearn forever!</p><p>Life and death hold no fear, what can stop me?</p><p>This sword technique, though not yet at the Emperor level, contained all his convictions, pushing his Tian Ru You Qing technique to its limits.</p><p>WHOOSH!</p><p>One sword cleaved the ruthless cultivator's attack in two.</p><p>Simultaneously, Luo Ruoxi attacked, her movements like swirling jade, her sword light like snow.</p><p>Her swordsmanship resembled the young man from Sword God Heaven, possessing an unstoppable momentum and effortless grace.</p><p>"Your skills are impressive, but they fall short against me…"</p><p>With a light smile, the ruthless cultivator attacked again.</p><p>In an instant, the attack blotted out the sun and moon, their palm engulfing the heavens and earth, shattering space, and threatening to crush the stars.</p><p>PUFF! PUFF!</p><p>Zhang Xuan and Luo Ruoxi were sent flying, blood spraying from their mouths.</p><p>Even with their strength, they couldn't withstand the attack!</p><p>What level of cultivation had this person reached?</p><p>"Audacious!" The clone stepped forward, each step blooming a lotus, the air filled with the sound of flowing water.</p><p>From afar, it was incredibly impressive.</p><p>Having refined the Nine Heavens Chaotic Golden Lotus, his cultivation was no weaker than Zhang Xuan's.</p><p>He unleashed a punch, its force reaching the heavens.</p><p>Clashing with the ruthless cultivator, he too was sent flying, unable to withstand a single blow.</p><p>Zhang Xuan rubbed his forehead.</p><p>Even after becoming an Emperor, his clone still hadn't abandoned its habit of showing off…</p><p>Such flamboyant displays were less effective than concentrating power for a more devastating strike!</p><p>"Attack together, or we all die if they're killed…"</p><p>Little Yellow Chicken roared, burning with crimson flames that seemed to ignite the sky.</p><p>The remaining six Emperors unleashed their powers.</p><p>Seven Emperors united, their attack capable of destroying the world, overwhelming any ordinary realm. However, their opponent was the ruthlessly powerful cultivator who absorbed special energies. The black hole expanded rapidly, swallowing the attack in the blink of an eye, then counterattacking.</p><p>BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG!</p><p>The seven Emperors, like Zhang Xuan and the others, were sent flying.</p><p>Ten Emperors combined, and still they couldn't withstand a single attack!</p><p>How could this person be so strong?</p><p>"You may die now…"</p><p>Having defeated everyone with one strike, the ruthless cultivator stepped forward, their wrist flipping as they struck again.</p><p>"You insolent wretch!"</p><p>With a roar, the elder from Sword God Heaven suddenly appeared, blocking the attack, his sword transforming into a silver river.</p><p>"An Emperor? He's also an Emperor?"</p><p>Zhang Xuan's pupils constricted.</p><p>This elder had followed the young man, previously believed to be a mere follower, at most a titled God King. Only now, with his power unleashed, was he revealed as an Emperor!</p><p>If he was an Emperor, what was the young man?</p><p>"He is himself an Emperor of Sword God Heaven…" Struggling to stand, Luo Ruoxi gritted her teeth.</p><p>"Then…the young man who taught me swordsmanship?" Zhang Xuan could no longer hold back.</p><p>"He is…" Luo Ruoxi was about to answer when space twisted, revealing the Sword God Heaven Emperor flying away, crashing into the ground and creating a huge crater.</p><p>Even Zhang Xuan, whose strength and swordsmanship comprehension far exceeded this Emperor, couldn't withstand him, and he was no match for the ruthless cultivator.</p><p>"Haha, Emperor!  Just a bunch of weaklings! Today, I will destroy the Nine Heavens, destroy this divine realm, and crush all its rules!"</p><p>The Emperor of Sword Heaven defeated, the ruthless one laughed wildly.  Space around him constantly collapsed, making him appear demonic and monstrous.</p><p>"What do we do?" Zhang Xuan clenched his fists.</p><p>He and his clone had unleashed their strongest attacks, and even Luo Ruoxi had used her ultimate technique, yet they couldn't withstand a single blow…</p><p>Could it be that no one in the divine realm could stop this person?</p><p>Could they just let him destroy the world?</p><p>"The only way… is to return the flawed fragment of Heaven's Way back to its source, allowing Heaven's Way to suppress him…" Luo Ruoxi clenched her fists, her eyes reddening.</p><p>"Return it to its source?" Zhang Xuan understood her meaning.</p><p>The library in his mind was part of Heaven's Way.  Once it returned, Heaven's Way would be complete, perhaps fixing the flaw and expelling the ruthless one.</p><p>Like a human immune system.</p><p>A complete immune system easily repels viruses; a damaged one cannot resist viral invasion, and even the strongest person will die.</p><p>But…</p><p>"He's too powerful. Even if Heaven's Way is restored, it might not be able to suppress him!" Zhang Xuan shook his head.</p><p>The immune system can kill viruses, but… what about a tiger?</p><p>What can even the strongest immune system do?</p><p>This person, a mere ordinary God King, even if he holds a title, Heaven's Way could easily kill him; yet he is stronger than the Emperor… beyond Heaven's Way's ability to contend with.</p><p>"This…" Luo Ruoxi paused, a look of despair on her delicate face. "Yes… we can't suppress him, but with Heaven's Way complete, he can awaken, and killing this person won't be difficult!"</p><p>"He?" Zhang Xuan frowned.</p><p>"I'll take you to him, in Zizai Heaven…" Taking a deep breath, Luo Ruoxi gritted her teeth and flew forward.</p><p>"Trying to escape?" The ruthless one sneered and struck downwards.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Luo Ruoxi fell from the sky.</p><p>"You…" Zhang Xuan unleashed his swordsmanship again, his sword intent brilliant.</p><p>Clang! Clang! Clang!</p><p>He was blocked again by the ruthless one.</p><p>"You go! I'll hold him off…"</p><p>Knowing they needed to find a way to save the divine realm, not escape, the clone and the Immortal Emperor shouted, blocking the ruthless one's path; Luo Qiq also transformed back into her original form, the Quiet Void Pearl.</p><p>Space around them solidified.</p><p>"Go!"</p><p>Seeing everyone bravely standing their ground, fearless of death, Zhang Xuan's eyes reddened.  He knew this wasn't the time for talk, grabbed Luo Ruoxi, and his body flickered, ripping through space. The next moment, they were within the borders of Zizai Heaven.</p><p>Zizai Heaven was no longer peaceful. The divine realm was collapsing, chaos everywhere.</p><p>"Where's the person you mentioned?"</p><p>He didn't have time to observe the commoners' lives, and looked at the girl in his arms.</p><p>If the person she spoke of could truly save the divine realm, what did his own sacrifice matter!</p><p>"He is my father. The blood in your pendant is his. The Immortal Emperor was once his pet…" Luo Ruoxi took a moment to regain her breath, explaining.</p><p>"Father?"</p><p>Zhang Xuan suddenly understood.</p><p>No wonder he always felt the blood in the pendant was similar to Luo Ruoxi's, yet different; it was her father's.</p><p>This also explained why the remnant will of the Immortal Emperor, upon seeing the pendant, immediately acknowledged him as its master.</p><p>"Your father is also an Emperor? Or possesses power surpassing that of an Emperor?"</p><p>He couldn't help but ask.</p><p>The chaos in the library was because the blood in the pendant had restored his clarity. Could it be that not only was she the daughter of an Emperor, but her father was one too, and even more powerful?</p><p>If so, why was he unconscious?</p><p>And why did his awakening require the flawed fragment of Heaven's Way?</p><p>"He's not an Emperor, but… Heaven's Way!"</p><p>Luo Ruoxi clenched her fists.</p><p>"Heaven's Way? Your father… is Heaven's Way?" Zhang Xuan was shocked, disbelieving.</p><p>"Yes! Fifty years ago, Father couldn't withstand that attack, fell into a coma, and Heaven's Way shattered into three parts: Orderly Heaven's Way, the Flawed Heaven's Way, and Natural Heaven's Way.  The flawed and orderly parts entered the spatial currents. I took over Natural Heaven's Way, maintaining the balance of the divine realm. To restore him, I need to gather the scattered parts… That's why I'm so resolute, I can't fail! That's why I specifically went to the Master's Continent, studied the Spring and Autumn Annals, and tried to defeat Master Kong!  My plea to Master Kong during our fight was about this too." Luo Ruoxi explained.</p><p>Zhang Xuan understood.</p><p>Not long after meeting on the Master's Continent, this girl had told him her story, about saving a close relative. He hadn't understood back then, now he finally got it.</p><p>It was her father, and he was the Heaven's Way of the divine realm!</p><p>Could Heaven's Way truly take human form and have children?</p><p>"Took over Natural Heaven's Way… you don't have a Heaven's Way fragment within you?" Suddenly realizing something inconsistent in her words, Zhang Xuan looked at her.</p><p>Controlling from the outside and merging with it from within are two different concepts.</p><p>“I only control it; I’m not a part of the Heavenly Dao…” Luo Ruoxi said.</p><p>Zhang Xuan breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p>This meant he only needed to separate the flaw in the Heavenly Dao; he didn't need her to die.</p><p>Although he didn't want this fate, he didn't want the girl before him to get hurt either.</p><p>“If I separate the flaw in the Heavenly Dao within me, your father will be revived, and even the Ruthless One can be killed, right?” Zhang Xuan looked on.</p><p>“That… I’m not sure…”</p><p>Looking up at the collapsed Divine Realm, Luo Ruoxi hesitated.</p><p>The Divine Realm was her father’s foundation.  Now that the foundation was gone, even if he woke up, could he really defeat that powerful Ruthless One?</p><p>It's hard to say!</p><p>“It seems you can’t be certain either. In that case, relying on others is futile… we have to find our own way!” Zhang Xuan gritted his teeth. “You, me, my clone, together with the Nine Heavens Nine Emperors, and if we can also cooperate with Master Kong, we might stand a chance of winning!”</p><p>“Master Kong? He…” Luo Ruoxi frowned.</p><p>“Master Kong is dead, you say! He’s not truly dead. If I’m not mistaken, his apparent death at your hands was a method to detach from the Heavenly Dao…  He should be a ‘Primordial Embryo Soul Body’, just like Wei Changfeng!”</p><p>Zhang Xuan said.</p><p>Seeing Wei Changfeng clarified things. Master Kong's supposed preservation of his intellect was likely due to him being a Primordial Embryo Soul Body as well.</p><p>Able to remain conscious even before birth.</p><p>Plus, with the precautions he took beforehand, resurrection was only a matter of time.</p><p>Luo Ruoxi was stunned; she hadn't expected this.</p><p>“Let's go and see. If my guess is right, he should have already recovered. Otherwise, his students wouldn't have stayed away from the Tidal Sea…” Zhang Xuan said.</p><p>Master Kong’s students, Zi Yuan Gu Sheng and others, were all incredibly powerful. Even without the Emperor’s help, they would certainly have a way to enter the Tidal Sea, yet none of them were seen.</p><p>There must be something more important waiting, something they wanted to do while all the Emperors were preoccupied at the Tidal Sea!</p><p>And that important task was clearly Master Kong’s recovery.</p><p>“This…” Luo Ruoxi’s heart trembled, and she suddenly understood.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Without further explanation, with a sweep of his hand, Zhang Xuan reappeared at Master Kong's residence.  Sure enough, he saw an old man floating cross-legged in the air, who smiled slightly upon seeing them arrive: “You’ve come!”</p><p>If it wasn't Master Kong, then who else could it be!</p><p>This master of all ages truly hadn't let him down!</p><p>Just as he guessed, while everyone focused on the Tidal Sea, he had resurrected.</p><p>“You…” Luo Ruoxi trembled.</p><p>She knew Emperors could be resurrected; even the Immortal Emperors had come back to life, but… she hadn’t expected it to be this fast!</p><p>“I concealed it from the Heavenly Dao and prepared a contingency plan in advance. The nameless giant in the Nether Soul Pool was my creation. When you killed it, I used the opportunity to break free from the Heavenly Dao’s constraints and reconstitute my physical body. I’ve only just now fully recovered!”</p><p>Master Kong smiled slightly.</p><p>He was adept at manipulating time. It seemed like only a day or two had passed in the Divine Realm, but he had actually spent an unknown amount of time recovering his strength.</p><p>It felt like decades.</p><p>“The three of us are very strong, but defeating the Ruthless One won't be easy…”</p><p>Seeing that Master Kong had indeed recovered, Luo Ruoxi still shook her head.</p><p>It wasn't about being pessimistic, it was simply a fact.</p><p>Even with so many people working together earlier, they still couldn't stop the opponent. Even with Master Kong added, what difference would it make?</p><p>It wouldn't change the situation!</p><p>“Individually, or even united, our strength is no match for the opponent. However… what if we combined everyone's power into a single person?”</p><p>Master Kong looked over with a smile.</p><p>“Combine it into one person?”</p><p>This time, not only Luo Ruoxi frowned, but Zhang Xuan was also full of doubts.</p><p>“That hand was able to tear apart the Divine Realm and scatter the Heavenly Dao. Its power is undeniable. The Ruthless One absorbed all that power and consumed fifty years' worth of the Divine Realm's spiritual energy. In terms of individual strength, even if we bring out a dozen Emperors one by one, they wouldn't be a match…”</p><p>Master Kong said, “But combined, concentrating the power into one person…  that might be different!”</p><p>“How do we concentrate it?”</p><p>Luo Ruoxi looked over.</p><p>It sounds simple, but it's hard to do.</p><p>Emperors already stand at the pinnacle of the Divine Realm. If absorbing others’ power were so easy, she wouldn't have stagnated for so many years.</p><p>“It’s simple… we’ll concentrate our power into Zhang Xuan. Once he breaks through the Emperor’s barrier, he’ll be able to save the Divine Realm!”</p><p>Master Kong said.</p><p>“Me?” Zhang Xuan was startled. “Why me?”</p><p>“Lingxi Emperor cultivated freedom and transcendence! But with the constraints of his father and Heaven, with loved ones, he could never truly transcend! If I’m not mistaken, when you fought me before, you also gave up, intending to be killed by me!” Kong Shi said.</p><p>Luo Ruoxi was speechless.</p><p>During the battle, she had indeed considered this, so their initial engagement was more like a sparring match than a fight to the death.</p><p>“Unable to transcend, naturally one cannot unleash their full power. Even with more True Qi, one still cannot reach the highest realm! As for me…”</p><p>Kong Shi nodded. “I care for all living beings, wishing to save the world, yet unwilling to let others sacrifice for me.  Too much benevolence is a flaw! If I had been ruthless and annihilated the Yiling race, the current situation would not have arisen…”</p><p>If the Yiling people had been completely annihilated, the Ruthless One would not have been resurrected, and the current situation would not exist.</p><p>“Therefore, I am also unsuitable! But Zhang Xuan’s cultivation method is harmonious, without flaws. He emphasizes living authentically; even facing death, as long as he lives without regret, his heart is at peace. Such a person possesses greater tolerance and potential for growth. Only then can he go higher and further!” Kong Shi continued.</p><p>To live, to return; to die, to be remembered forever!</p><p>Someone who doesn’t fear death won’t be bound by other things.</p><p>“This…” Zhang Xuan frowned, about to speak, when he saw Kong Shi’s intense gaze. “Don’t refuse. Even if we had time to train others, I don’t think anyone could do it better. While the Lingxi Emperor doesn't possess fragments of Heaven’s power, he has long controlled Heaven and has his own unique understanding of it; I control the order of Heaven. If we infuse our power into you, you will possess the complete power of Heaven! Combined with your clone's Nine Heavens Chaotic Golden Lotus, you can completely stabilize the Nine Heavens, control the universe, battle the Nine Skies, and destroy all things!”</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Seeing that the decision had been made, Zhang Xuan nodded; further explanation would be futile.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>He sat cross-legged, and in the blink of an eye, two powerful forces surged in from both sides.</p><p>Zhang Xuan's body stiffened; he seemed to instantly transform into Heaven, soaring above the Nine Heavens.</p><p>His soul, body, and True Qi were instantly cleansed, becoming stronger and more powerful.</p><p>…</p><p>“You want to stop me too? Fine, I’ll kill you, then go kill Zhang Xuan…”</p><p>After sending Luo Qiqi and his clone flying, the Ruthless One sneered coldly.</p><p>The combined power of the clone and numerous Emperors was indeed formidable, but it was still weaker than him.</p><p>The Tidal Sea had devoured almost all the spiritual energy outside the city in the God Realm; now, all this power had become his sustenance, granting him the ability to destroy the world with a flick of his wrist. These Emperors and God Kings, though representing the peak of the God Realm, were no match for him.</p><p>The Ruthless One seemed to represent the entire God Realm, unstoppable.</p><p>“With the God Realm destroyed, our lives are meaningless. I, Yun Chi, will perish with you…”</p><p>Yun Chi Emperor transformed into his true form, a huge five-clawed golden dragon, lunging at him.</p><p>“You? Not worthy!”</p><p>The Ruthless One squeezed his hand, trapping the golden dragon in his palm, preventing its escape.</p><p>“Old friend, wait for me!”</p><p>Fu Meng Emperor also roared, transforming into his white tiger form, appearing before the Ruthless One.</p><p>The Immortal Emperor’s immortal fire phoenix true form appeared, its flames illuminating the sky.</p><p>Xuan Ming Emperor, whose true form was a giant tortoise, seemed to support the heavens.</p><p>The Four Divine Beasts, guarding the four cardinal directions of the God Realm, simultaneously transformed into their true forms, slowing the collapse of the God Realm.</p><p>Heaven and Earth seemed to freeze for a moment.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>With four consecutive strikes, the Ruthless One suppressed the four beasts, a strong killing intent flashing in his eyes: “Since you seek death, I’ll grant it to you…”</p><p>As he roared and was about to kill them all, he felt his raised arm tighten and stop in mid-air.</p><p>“Want to kill them? Ask me first…”</p><p>Then, to the shocked gazes of everyone, a figure slowly descended from the sky.</p><p>It was Zhang Xuan!</p><p>The young man, brimming with power, was ten times stronger than before, descending from heaven like a world unto himself.</p><p>“You’ve improved quite a bit…”</p><p>The Ruthless One stopped, his gaze serious.</p><p>He clearly couldn’t understand how the other party's strength had increased so dramatically in just a few minutes.</p><p>“But what does it matter? Even the God Realm at its peak couldn’t withstand me. I don’t believe you can stop me…”</p><p>With a cold snort, the Ruthless One attacked again.</p><p>Zhang Xuan raised his sword and met him.</p><p>As they clashed, space tore apart, and air currents surged wildly.</p><p>Could Zhang Xuan win?</p><p>Luo Ruoxi, at the Kong Shi base, watched with worry.</p><p>She and Kong Shi had transferred their power to Zhang Xuan, reducing their own cultivation to the God King level.  Their former glory was gone, but their level remained, and with enough power, they could eventually recover.</p><p>"With his current strength, to defeat… it's difficult! Unless… he can grasp power beyond the Emperor Jun level!" Kong Shi said after a moment of silence.</p><p>Even over a dozen Emperor Juns combined couldn't defeat the Ruthless One. Even if they channeled all their power to a single person, victory wouldn't be easy.  They did this because… only by concentrating power in one person could they possibly reach the peak and truly surpass their limits, breaking through!</p><p>"Power beyond the Emperor Jun level?" Luo Ruoxi's gaze drifted far away.</p><p>Her father, when he was still alive, had spoken of the same thing, but… she couldn't do it. Could the man she loved?</p><p>"He can… He has an unyielding spirit! And a proud defiance of the world." Kong Shi smiled, seeing her doubts.</p><p>…</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>After several blows, Zhang Xuan's knuckles cracked, and a huge, gruesome wound appeared on his chest.  As Kong Shi said, even with their combined power, forming a complete Heavenly Dao within him, he was still no match.</p><p>"Haha, I thought you were mighty.  Just so-so!" the Ruthless One sneered.</p><p>"Anyway, I'm no match for you, I'll be killed sooner or later. Since that's the case, I want to die under your strongest attack…" Taking a deep breath, Zhang Xuan stopped attacking and looked at the Ruthless One.</p><p>"Fine, I'll grant you that, my strongest attack…"</p><p>Hearing this, the Ruthless One paused, then snorted coldly, raising their hand.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>A green light appeared in their palm and slammed down.</p><p>It was indeed their strongest attack. The entire divine realm rumbled, as if it couldn't bear it, a huge crater appearing once again.</p><p>With his eyes closed, Zhang Xuan didn't dodge.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>His head exploded, his soul scattering.</p><p>"Zhang Xuan…" Seeing this, everyone's faces turned pale.</p><p>Luo Qiq quickly went insane.</p><p>Yun Chi and the other Emperors' eyes widened, trembling incessantly.</p><p>Kong Shi and Luo Ruoxi were also stunned.</p><p>Their intention was for him to break through the shackles and reach a realm beyond the Emperor Jun, but why did he not resist, willingly accepting death?  Wasn't this a betrayal of their kindness?</p><p>"No, it's the Immortal Emperor's immortal technique…"</p><p>While everyone was perplexed, Kong Shi suddenly spoke.</p><p>Everyone then saw that, though Zhang Xuan's head had exploded and his soul shattered, the pendant on his chest suddenly burst open, a drop of blood hovering and igniting, forming a blazing flame. Within the flame, a perfectly unharmed figure slowly emerged.</p><p>"He… used the opponent's power and the blood in the pendant to separate the Heavenly Dao's flaws from his soul?" Luo Ruoxi's pupils constricted.</p><p>The reborn Zhang Xuan no longer had the Heavenly Dao Library within him, free from the Heavenly Dao's interference!</p><p>"How did he do it?"  Kong Shi was also incredulous.</p><p>The Heavenly Dao and soul merged together, inseparable. To escape, he had to shatter his soul, using the Ghost Pool to reconstitute it.  This man, after only being killed once, completely broke free. What method did he use?</p><p>"I know… he used the Ruthless One's method of escaping the soul contract…" Luo Ruoxi realized.</p><p>A soul contract binds master and servant. The master doesn't release it, the servant is forever bound… The Heavenly Dao Library is the same, a stronger version of a contract.</p><p>Bound to the soul, death wouldn't release him.</p><p>But… the Ruthless One used a special power to break free from the soul contract.  Zhang Xuan had previously inquired in detail about the method; he likely had plans then.</p><p>That's why he deliberately risked his life, forcing the Ruthless One to unleash their strongest attack.</p><p>Using this power, reborn from the flames, he unexpectedly succeeded greatly!</p><p>"So that's it, this is the method to surpass the Emperor Jun…"</p><p>Zhang Xuan, stepping out of the flames, had a faint smile on his face, as if he understood something. He gestured, and a nearby clone instantly transformed back into a lotus flower, flying towards him.</p><p>In an instant, he perfectly merged with it.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, everyone felt that Zhang Xuan had become the Nine Heavens, and the Nine Heavens were him.</p><p>He gently stepped on the ground.</p><p>The chaotic Nine Heavens immediately stabilized.</p><p>The Nine Heavens Chaotic Golden Lotus, born at the creation of the Nine Heavens, stabilizes them.  With its power fully integrated into himself, Zhang Xuan achieved perfect unity between his self and its manifestation.  He now completely commands this power.</p><p>Furthermore, this fusion, combined with his already peak cultivation, caused a shift, hinting at an imminent breakthrough.</p><p>“Master-servant bond, brotherhood, teacher-student bond, familial love, romantic love… merged together, they are all things in this world. This… is humanity!”</p><p>A smile played on Zhang Xuan's lips as he muttered to himself.</p><p>The moment the Heavenly Dao Library separated from his soul, he understood.</p><p>Did humanity create the world, or did the world precede humanity?  Is it the wind that moves, or the heart?</p><p>This question has plagued countless people for eons.</p><p>Of course, now… none of that matters!</p><p>Without life, without emotion, what meaning does the world have, even if it exists?</p><p>Therefore, after transcending romantic love, came universal compassion!  The intertwined emotions of the world.</p><p>All things in the world possess emotion; emotion creates the world, emotion sustains life.</p><p>Love is emotion.</p><p>Hate is emotion.</p><p>Joy is emotion.</p><p>Suffering is emotion.</p><p>Parting is emotion.</p><p>Reunion is also emotion!</p><p>“All emotions, now mine to command…”</p><p>With a low cry, the restraints on Zhang Xuan’s cultivation shattered.</p><p>He broke through the Emperor’s shackles!</p><p>In an instant, he seemed to touch a completely new world and a gateway to it; his soul was rapidly nourished.</p><p>Countless streams of chaotic energy surged towards him, and his physical body strengthened rapidly.</p><p>Before, he could only improve by absorbing spiritual energy, but now spatial turbulence, chaotic energy, even the opponent's green light—everything became his to use, without distinction.</p><p>“You…” Hen Ren, never expecting that her all-out attack not only failed to kill him but actually helped him achieve this breakthrough, let out a furious roar, “Wah wah!”  Then, she attacked again.</p><p>“Your resentment towards the high and mighty Emperors for not saving you in the spatial turbulence is emotion; your feelings of inferiority and anger as my former servant are emotion; your desire to destroy the Divine Realm to vent your rage is emotion; your desire for greater power is also emotion… Emotion controls you. How can you possibly defeat me, someone who commands emotion?”</p><p>With a faint smile, Zhang Xuan’s voice grew faster and louder.  With a gentle grasp of his hand,</p><p>The once invincible Hen Ren was bound by countless threads of emotion, unable to move.</p><p>Anyone with emotion would be used, controlled, by him!</p><p>“You…”</p><p>Terror filled Hen Ren’s eyes.  “Master Zhang, I was your servant! Don't kill me… I'll offer my soul as a sacrifice…”</p><p>“It's too late for that…” With a slight smile, Zhang Xuan shook his head.</p><p>Control over the world's emotions rendered concepts like servants meaningless.</p><p>Having killed so many divine beings, hurt his girlfriend, Luo Qiqi, and many friends, forgiveness was impossible today.</p><p>“No…”</p><p>Sensing his resolve, Hen Ren's pupils constricted. Before she could finish speaking, a searing pain struck her.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>In an instant, she exploded, transforming into countless strands of spiritual energy that poured into the Divine Realm.</p><p>The power previously absorbed by the Tidal Sea now flowed back, revitalizing the barren lands.</p><p>“What…”</p><p>“She’s… dead?”</p><p>Yun Chi the Great Emperor, the Immortal Emperor, Linglong Xianzi, and others stared, dumbfounded. They had fought Hen Ren and knew her terrifying power.  To effortlessly annihilate someone so strong… what level had Zhang Xuan reached?</p><p>Could there truly be a realm beyond the Emperor?</p><p>“He succeeded…”</p><p>Kong Shi and Luo Ruoxi unclenched their fists.</p><p>“This is a fragment of the Heavenly Dao. Now I shall return it…”</p><p>Seeing the "Incomplete Heavenly Dao," previously separated from him, still floating in the air, Zhang Xuan smiled gently and flicked a finger.</p><p>Buzz!</p><p>The Library, his companion since rebirth, slammed into the sky of the Divine Realm.</p><p>A bell-like resonance echoed. The collapsing Divine Realm visibly began to slowly recover; the chaotic currents re-coalesced.</p><p>The collapse finally stopped. The depleted spiritual energy, along with Hen Ren's death, slowly revived.</p><p>“It seems the Divine Realm will enter a new era of spiritual revival…” Zhang Xuan smiled.</p><p>The hole in the Tidal Sea, with the Heavenly Dao's restoration, was repaired. The Divine Realm's return to its former glory was merely a matter of time.</p><p>“Zhang Xuan, come over here…”</p><p>A voice echoed in his mind. Zhang Xuan paused, then took a step forward.</p><p>This step carried him an immeasurable distance. A young man stood before him.</p><p>It was the one who had taught him swordsmanship.</p><p>“Senior, you…”</p><p>Zhang Xuan was stunned.</p><p>I sensed his unfathomable power before, but now I realize he's just a hair's breadth away from my own level, having reached the pinnacle of Emperor-level strength. He far surpasses Luo Ruoxi.</p><p>"Just call me by my name. I'm... Nie Tong!"  The young man, radiating an indomitable sword intent, said calmly.</p><p>"Nie Tong?" Zhang Xuan frowned.  He'd never heard the name before.</p><p>"Come with me. I'll introduce you to my brother," Nie Tong said with a gentle smile, striding forward.</p><p>Zhang Xuan followed closely.  After an indeterminate flight, they stopped before a mountain peak.  There, he saw another young man.  </p><p>He looked only slightly older, with sharply angled eyebrows that gave him a profound, unreadable air.</p><p>"His strength..." Zhang Xuan trembled.  The young man's power surpassed even his own; he too had broken through the Emperor-level barrier, but his cultivation was far deeper and more substantial!</p><p>"I am Nie Yun," the young man said with a faint smile. "And... I am Nie Lingxi's father, the father of the Luo Ruoxi you know."</p><p>"Ruoxi's father?" Zhang Xuan was shocked. "You... are the Heavenly Dao of the God Realm?"</p><p>Luo Ruoxi had mentioned her father was the Heavenly Dao.  He never imagined it would be such a young man.</p><p>"I underwent a tripartite division of my essence, and a part of my soul became the Heavenly Dao! Besides, I created this world; calling me the Heavenly Dao isn't inaccurate!" Nie Yun smiled calmly.</p><p>Zhang Xuan was incredulous.  This man created the God Realm? How strong was he then?</p><p>"But if you created the God Realm and are the Heavenly Dao, why did you allow the powerful to wreak havoc without intervening...?" Zhang Xuan questioned.</p><p>If he hadn't broken through, the God Realm might have collapsed. Why did this man remain indifferent?  Did he not even care about his daughter's life or death?</p><p>Without answering, Nie Yun looked at him calmly: "Do you think... there are beings more powerful than the God Realm?"</p><p>"That..." Zhang Xuan hesitated.  "Probably..."</p><p>He'd never seen them, but if this man could reach this level, perhaps others could too, even stronger ones. Like the one before him.</p><p>"I suspected the existence of stronger beings beyond the God Realm, so I used all my strength to peer into the higher realms, which ultimately provoked a backlash from a higher world... a hand descended from the void!"</p><p>Nie Yun continued, "If I had dodged, the entire God Realm would likely have been erased, leaving not a single living being... So, I blocked the attack, but because of that, the Heavenly Dao aspect of myself was split off."</p><p>"Restoring myself is merely a matter of will, but... I understood that to truly transcend the God Realm's constraints, to explore the origin of that hand and what lies beyond... it would be difficult to do alone. So I wanted to see if any being could break through the Emperor-level barrier and reach my level!"</p><p>"Therefore, I sent the scattered fragments of the Heavenly Dao's essence to the lowest realm... bestowing them upon souls native to this world, and one soul not of this world. And you, you did not disappoint me!"</p><p>Nie Yun chuckled.</p><p>"A soul not of this world. So, my arrival here was because of you?"  A shock ran through Zhang Xuan.</p><p>He had crossed over, orchestrated by this man.</p><p>"Hehe!" Nie Yun chuckled. "Those native to this world possess inherent reverence for their world, making it much harder to break through its constraints. It was a spontaneous act; I never expected you to actually succeed..."</p><p>"I..." Zhang Xuan blushed, "Without Kong Shi's selfless dedication, I could never have reached this level..."</p><p>Without Kong Shi's sacrifice, he never could have achieved his current strength.</p><p>"I gave him the opportunity; he simply didn't seize it.  His duel with Lingxi was the perfect chance for him to break through.  Sadly, he chose to retreat, thinking he had a backup plan to ensure his safety.  Instead, he lost the drive to push himself further. When facing someone who surpasses us, if you lack such resolve, how can you ever hope to contend?"</p><p>Nie Yun said.</p><p>Zhang Xuan remained silent.  He had witnessed the duel, and indeed, Kong Shi lacked decisiveness.</p><p>Perhaps he didn't want to kill Luo Ruoxi.  But that single hesitation cost him the chance to advance.</p><p>"If Kong Shi had won, Ruoxi would have died..."  After a moment, Zhang Xuan looked up, his eyebrows furrowed.  Did this man not even care about his daughter's life?</p><p>"With me here, she wouldn't have died," Nie Yun smiled faintly.  "Your strength is now comparable to mine. Do you think, in a life-or-death situation, you could have saved her?"</p><p>"That..." Zhang Xuan chuckled wryly.</p><p>The Emperor's breakthrough and the Emperor himself are two different concepts. If he were truly willing to intervene, he could certainly save the person at the last moment, ensuring they wouldn't suffer a single scratch.</p><p>"Lingxi is my other wife, Luo Qingcheng's daughter, so her assumed surname is Luo... To make her believe, and to avoid emotional interference, she has been led to believe I remain unconscious..."</p><p>Nie Yun gave a wry smile: "I guess I've been a pretty ruthless father... Let you explain this to her.  Her affections have shifted to you, and she's probably forgotten all about her old dad… Haha, I'll disappear for a while. Otherwise, I'm afraid she'll turn the world upside down…"</p><p>Seeing such an unreliable father, Zhang Xuan twitched his face, and could only agree: "Alright…"</p><p>He had no choice. After all, he had taken his daughter.</p><p>"The Heavenly Dao Library is a manifestation of my will, both my foundation and my constraint.  You've managed to overcome it through your own abilities, demonstrating your skill and potential. Your future is limitless, and as her father, I'm relieved she's with you."</p><p>(To be continued…)</p>
