<h1>Chapter 651: Enemy in Pursuit, Flee Upon Seeing This!</h1><p>Yagu seemed to be drifting along the Green River.</p><p>Qin Sang passed by Thousand Households Village and found everything normal. The villagers were living peacefully; women were cooking, children were playing, a scene of tranquility.</p><p>“Eh?”</p><p>About to fly over the village, Qin Sang suddenly descended, landing behind the village, in front of the thatched hut where Yagu once lived.</p><p>Yagu had been gone for less than a year, and no one had occupied the hut.  It remained largely unchanged.</p><p>Qin Sang stared at a large hole in the roof. He remembered the hut was old and leaked during heavy rain, but Yagu was diligent and often patched it with thatch.  There shouldn't be such significant damage.</p><p>This hole seemed to have been smashed through by a stone, and the damage looked recent.</p><p>Qin Sang swept the area with his divine sense and indeed found a green stone inside the hut. The stone was covered in green moss, clearly just taken from the river.</p><p>Upon seeing the stone clearly, Qin Sang's eyes narrowed sharply.</p><p>Eight characters were carved on the green stone: "Enemy in pursuit, flee upon seeing this!"</p><p>The handwriting was very messy, but it was undoubtedly Yagu's.</p><p>Qin Sang took the stone into his hand with a wave and scanned the surroundings with his divine sense. Finding nothing unusual, he immediately departed on his sword, continuing his pursuit down the Green River without delay.</p><p>Before leaving, Qin Sang glanced back at Thousand Households Village. Judging by the position of the stone and the hole in the roof, Yagu had thrown it from the river.</p><p>Qin Sang could picture the scene: Yagu, unable to reach him through their enchanted coins, severely injured and drifting, lacking even the strength to climb ashore, could only throw the stone to leave a message.</p><p>Or perhaps, Yagu feared her pursuers would track her, exposing her location, and dared not leave the river.</p><p>If he couldn't find Yagu, he would definitely come to Thousand Households Village.  As for whether the pursuers would discover the stone first, Yagu likely had no energy left to consider that. This was all she could do.</p><p>Who had forced Yagu to resort to such a method?</p><p>Qin Sang looked down at the stone.</p><p>Enemies?</p><p>What enemies?</p><p>Could this danger have been brought about by him, implicating Yagu?</p><p>Qin Sang was extremely puzzled.</p><p>Carefully recalling his experiences since arriving, he had only killed twice: once avenging Yagu by eliminating the Winged Serpent Village shaman, and once dispatching the bandits who attacked the Five Venom Sect.  All were minor figures.</p><p>He was certain those bandits had no backing and were lone wolves. Even if they had relatives or friends, they wouldn't dare to oppose a Foundation Establishment cultivator, let alone threaten Yagu under the protection of the Five Venom Sect.</p><p>In the Five Venom Sect, only Elder Cui Xuanzi and the Tong cultivator knew of his relationship with Yagu.</p><p>Whether it was the Five Venom Sect, Thunderclap Stronghold, or Hundred Flowers Palace, he had used both coercion and inducement. He hadn't pushed them too hard, and they had neither the courage nor the reason to defy him.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't understand.  He could only learn the truth by finding Yagu.</p><p>Qin Sang flew along the Green River at astonishing speed. As the distance closed, the connection with the enchanted coins grew stronger. Yagu was indeed drifting in the river!</p><p>Qin Sang's heart sank, but he could only suppress his anxiety.</p><p>Soon, the coins indicated Yagu was below, at the river bottom.</p><p>The river was vast and turbulent. Qin Sang plunged directly into the water with his sword and finally found Yagu at the bottom.</p><p>Yagu's eyes were closed, with no sign of breath. She drifted motionlessly, entangled in thick water weeds, looking like a corpse.</p><p>Qin Sang gently enveloped Yagu with his true essence and carried her upwards.</p><p>‘Splash!’</p><p>Water sprayed everywhere.</p><p>Qin Sang emerged from the water with Yagu in his arms, landed on the bank, and immediately began to clear the weeds and water from her.</p><p>Yagu's face was deathly pale, having clearly endured a fierce battle.</p><p>She had many wounds, all bleached white from the water. The most severe was a horrifying hole in her left shoulder, seemingly pierced by some sharp weapon.</p><p>The immense force had shattered the bones in her left shoulder and nearly reached her heart.</p><p>Yagu's current state was also extremely dire. Her heart had stopped beating.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression was grim, but he didn't give up hope. He probed Yagu's body with his divine sense, and a flicker of joy crossed his face.</p><p>Yagu still had a breath left!</p><p>Although she wasn't dead, her injuries were too severe. Ordinary medicine was useless. Qin Sang immediately retrieved the Three Lights Jade Liquid from his ring, poured out a drop, and fed it to Yagu.</p><p>As the jade liquid entered her body, a powerful life force erupted within her.</p><p>Qin Sang placed his hand on Yagu's abdomen, channeling his true essence to help the medicine circulate and guide its life force to repair her injuries.</p><p>Yagu's wounds visibly healed, the broken bones in her left shoulder mended, and the color returned to her face and skin.</p><p>Even more encouraging, her heart began to beat faintly.</p><p>However, she still didn't awaken.</p><p>Qin Sang frowned, examining Yagu's nascent soul. He discovered it was incredibly weak, on the verge of dissipation. The jade liquid could only heal her physical body, not her nascent soul.</p><p>If this continued, within fifteen minutes, Yagu's nascent soul would dissipate, and she would still die!</p><p>Qin Sang didn't have many medicines for treating nascent souls, and none possessed the miraculous effects of the Three Lights Jade Liquid. He took out a bottle of the best Soul Nourishing Pills he had and gave them to Yagu.</p><p>As the pills took effect, Yagu's nascent soul showed signs of recovery, but the process was very slow.</p><p>Qin Sang summoned his Flying Night Devil to stand guard and sat on a riverside stone with Yagu in his arms, waiting for her to awaken. His face was somber. He looked at the river, then at the sky, his gaze deep in thought.</p><p>It was then that Qin Sang noticed four divine inscription patterns tattooed on Yagu's hands and arms.</p><p>Divine inscriptions were complex and diverse, capable of producing various unique powers. Qin Sang's understanding was limited, but he vaguely recalled that the inscriptions on Yagu seemed related to water.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Yagu hadn't focused solely on cultivating the Demonic Sound of the Heavens, but also practiced divine inscriptions.</p><p>Yagu's cultivation was indeed only at the third level of Qi Refining, and it seemed like a recent breakthrough, slightly lower than Qin Sang's previous estimate, perhaps due to her divided attention.</p><p>Low cultivation didn't mean Yagu was weak.</p><p>Qin Sang realized the two inscriptions on her hands were not simple.</p><p>Yagu had only been dabbling in divine inscriptions, yet achieved such results in such a short time.  Her talent in this area surprised even Qin Sang.</p><p>Just then, Qin Sang felt Yagu stir in his arms. Looking down, he saw her eyelashes flutter, her eyes opening a crack. Her gaze was weak and slightly confused.</p><p>“Brother Qin?”</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang's face vaguely, Yagu was stunned, thinking she was dreaming.  She murmured, “Thank you, Witch God, for letting me dream of Brother Qin one last time…”</p>
