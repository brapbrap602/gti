<h1>Chapter 1983: Epilogue</h1><p>Qin Sang thought of Qingyuan.  </p><p>The other party's explanation of the lesser and greater vehicles had given Qin Sang a sudden enlightenment, finally showing him the way.</p><p>This descent from the mountain for enlightenment had a satisfactory result.</p><p>Xiao Wu, having experienced the ways of the world, managed to suppress his demonic nature with his humanity; from now on, he only needs to slowly refine his demonic intent, and his transformation will soon be complete.</p><p>Although it was a risky approach, Qin Sang finally grasped the essence of the *Ziwei Sword Scripture*.</p><p>He wondered if Qingyuan had spoken so much to guide him toward the Daoist Court, or if Qingyuan had seen his confusion and bottleneck and intentionally awakened him.</p><p>Even if he would eventually understand these things after some time and interaction with other powerful figures in the vast world, he couldn't help but feel grateful.</p><p>The vast world is boundless and the road ahead is uncertain; he wondered if they would ever meet again.</p><p>"Greater Vehicle."</p><p>These two words swirled in Qin Sang's mind, impossible to shake off.</p><p>Ordinary people could hardly imagine that there could be a greater vehicle of killing.</p><p>Qin Sang initially found it somewhat absurd, but upon closer reflection, it was not without precedent.</p><p>Through the *Ziwei Sword Scripture*, one can glimpse the changes in Ziwei Sword Venerable's state of mind and his path of cultivation.</p><p>It can be roughly divided into two stages, with the Nascent Soul stage as the boundary.</p><p>Before Nascent Soul, killing intent coalesced into killing talismans, with overwhelming murderousness.</p><p>After experiencing the confusion of the Nascent Soul stage, and breaking through to the Divine Transformation stage, sheathing his sword, he was able to control his killing intent, no longer the murderous star who only knew slaughter.</p><p>However, how Ziwei Sword Venerable attained the Greater Vehicle of Killing, and what he had experienced, is a matter of much speculation.</p><p>In the Divine Transformation stage, he was merely suppressing his murderous nature; but in the Void Refinement stage, he transcended slaughter, a truly earth-shattering change.</p><p>What's even more curious is, if Ziwei Sword Venerable acted with the intention of protecting the world, why did he end up with his pavilion destroyed, his sword shattered, and the entire world against him?</p><p>Now that Ziwei Sword Venerable has disappeared, and his forces scattered, his enemies still won't let them go, and his 'successor' must also hide.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't figure it out, but he wasn't in a hurry.</p><p>From today onwards, he would openly step onto the stage, interacting with the major powers of the vast world, believing he could uncover some secrets.</p><p>The Daoist Court and the Ziwei Sword Pavilion possessed unfathomable strength, and must have been powerful forces in the entire vast world, leaving behind traces even in decline.</p><p>Unless...</p><p>Qin Sang thought of the Wu Xiang Immortal Sect in Zhongzhou, erased from history by the combined forces of Daoists and Buddhists, and he was no longer so sure.</p><p>Various thoughts popped up in an instant, quickly suppressed by Qin Sang; overthinking was pointless; self-cultivation was paramount.</p><p>The return of the Daoist Court and the Ziwei Sword Pavilion was a game between powerful figures.</p><p>Without sufficient strength, he would merely be a pawn, like those who went with the flow during this upheaval.</p><p>By then, Ziwei Tongzi would probably abandon him as well.</p><p>Sighing inwardly, Qin Sang saw Yu Lang standing outside the plaza, hesitant to approach, so he beckoned him over.</p><p>Yu Lang echoed that phrase in his mind, half-understanding it.  He steadied himself, stepped forward and bowed, "Greetings, Master."</p><p>He understood that Qingfeng Daoist was likely some kind of incarnation, but he felt there was a deeper meaning to his Master's words, one he couldn't grasp.</p><p>Looking at his unfamiliar Master, Yu Lang's mind was in turmoil, still deeply shaken.</p><p>Judging from his senior sister's reaction, he guessed his Master was powerful, but he had never imagined this level of power.</p><p>A single decree, and the world turned upside down!</p><p>Yun Xian Shi, a cultivator from Yun Du Tian, left a message talisman for Tao Teng and fled back to Yun Du Mountain, not daring to appear.</p><p>Various factions of the Yan Kingdom's cultivator world all hid in the mountains, closing their doors and staying far from human settlements.</p><p>Sha Da Ge and Tao Teng didn't dare enter the city, trembling as they waited outside the walls.</p><p>His Master's words were like heavenly laws.</p><p>The chessboard was overturned; the Void Refinement ancestors of Luo Hun Yuan and Yun Du Tian never even showed up, seemingly acquiescing.</p><p>He didn't yet know that the Ming Hu ancestor had fallen, and Luo Hun Yuan was in turmoil; otherwise, the shock would have been even greater.</p><p>"You should return to the mountain," Qin Sang said.</p><p>Yu Lang froze for a moment, then responded, "Disciple obeys."</p><p>Before the words left his mouth, Yu Lang felt something and looked north, seeing a procession escorting a palanquin coming from the royal palace.</p><p>Soldiers cleared the way, separating the people; civil and military officials followed, conspicuously missing the Grand Minister.</p><p>The procession passed the statue, ignoring those standing before it.</p><p>It must be Master's illusionary technique, Yu Lang thought, then looked surprised.</p><p>He saw them setting up an altar before the statue, with offerings of three animals; the king himself, leading civil and military officials, performing a sacrifice and reciting the sacrificial text, a ceremony even grander than the Heaven Sacrifice.</p><p>Major national events involve sacrifice and warfare.</p><p>Sacrifices have always been paramount; Yu Lang was quite familiar with it.</p><p>Now, the Yan kingdom uses the Heaven-honoring ceremony to venerate a statue of their master!</p><p>The sacrificial text speaks of acting on Heaven's behalf, purifying evil influences, protecting humanity, and the wisdom of the world's sages.</p><p>Yu Lang glanced at his master.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes shone with divine light as he gazed beyond the city walls, his gaze seemingly extending past Yan, sweeping across the entire human world.</p><p>At the same moment, similar ceremonies took place in various human kingdoms, replacing the Heaven-honoring ceremonies and becoming an annual tradition, with the sacrificial text disseminated throughout the land!</p><p>Master Qingfeng's merits are known to every person in the world.</p><p>Qin Sang seemed lost in thought.</p><p>As the ceremony progressed, Qin Sang felt a subtle, inexplicable connection forming between himself and those statues.</p><p>His cultivation didn't noticeably improve, but using this connection to test his techniques, his understanding grew clearer.</p><p>Qin Sang's face remained impassive, and he felt no joy.</p><p>In this battle, only the ancestor Ming Hu died.  Qin Sang only verbally warned Gu Yun Sou, so it's likely that Yun Du Tian will no longer interfere with the human world.</p><p>The human world will be his.</p><p>When he descended the mountain, Qin Sang never expected to act so swiftly, seizing territory from two major powers.</p><p>Moreover, this territory was the least valuable in the area.</p><p>Even more unexpectedly, it became his place of enlightenment.</p><p>If this is his path, originating from his true self, continuing down this road will surely bring great achievements, making his future cultivation of the *Ziwei Sword Scripture* much smoother.</p><p>But is he willing?</p><p>Qin Sang reflected on his path of cultivation.</p><p>When he first started cultivating the *Ziwei Sword Scripture*, then known as the *Chapter on Nurturing the Soul Sword*, he felt little connection to it.</p><p>Relying on the jade Buddha, he progressed step by step to this day, but the cracks have grown increasingly deep.</p><p>Until today, Qin Sang believed he would follow the path of the Ziwei Sword Venerable, always considering the *Ziwei Sword Scripture* his fundamental technique, desperately seeking its latter half.</p><p>Suddenly, that urgency vanished.</p><p>Of course, this doesn't mean Qin Sang will abandon his search for the latter half; even if he changes techniques, the *Ziwei Sword Scripture*, a top-tier cultivation method in the world, remains the best reference.</p><p>“Master plans to build sixty-four branch temples in the human world, including the main temple, and will leave them all in your care.</p><p>“Each branch temple will be temporarily guarded by a mountain spirit beast.  We don't need to rush to recruit people. I'll have Taiyi and the others spread out among the human world, seeking talented children with good hearts, and bringing them into the sect.</p><p>“Master's words are not empty.</p><p>“Qingyang Temple will oversee the world.  From now on, all major and minor sects and forces in the human world will be under its control, to prevent anyone from secretly disobeying and causing chaos.”</p><p>Qin Sang stated.</p><p>The human world is secured.</p><p>Qingyang Temple overseeing the world cannot be accomplished with just an empty shell.  Human hearts are fickle; intimidation only lasts for a while.</p><p>From now on, Qingyang Temple truly takes root in the vast world.</p><p>Yu Lang listened respectfully, his expression growing serious.</p><p>Master drove away Yun Du Tian and Luo Hun Yuan, shocking the cultivation world, and from now on cultivators will not be allowed to set foot in the human world – this is exactly what he had sought, how could he not be pleased?</p><p>But this responsibility is heavy.</p><p>Overseeing the world is not comparable to a small kingdom like Yan.</p><p>Qin Sang continued: “With Taiyi and the others assisting, and the divine path overseeing things, you don't need to handle everything personally.  Prioritize your cultivation.”</p><p>Before, Qin Sang, understanding his disciple's heart, allowed Yu Lang to descend into the world even before his cultivation was complete, without urging him to cultivate.</p><p>Yu Lang is talented, and his resolve is rare. Qin Sang doesn't want to see this disciple live a mediocre life.</p><p>“Master’s kindness is deeply appreciated. I shall keep it in my heart.”</p><p>Yu Lang took a deep breath and nodded solemnly.</p><p>Master’s teachings have given him a valuable lesson. Without Master, he would only be a pawn, struggling in the murky waters, any ambition nothing but empty words, all his passion turning to nothing.</p><p>Only someone like Master can intimidate the wicked and bring peace and order to the human world!</p><p>He was filled with gratitude for his master, viewing Master's actions as a means to awaken him.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't explain, and after watching the entire ceremony with Yu Lang, he left without a trace.</p><p>Yu Lang remained in Yan, appearing in the court and resigning his official post.  He summoned Sha Jia Yu into the city, bringing his family, to return to the mountain together.</p><p>Qin Sang strolled through the clouds, heading west.  He moved at a leisurely pace, seeming to inspect the human world.</p><p>As he traveled, a purple ray shot towards him.</p><p>Qin Sang caught it; it was a piece of purple bamboo.</p><p>‘Poof!’</p><p>The purple bamboo self-combusted without fire, transmitting Gu Yun Sou's voice.</p><p>…</p><p>West of Mu Luo Mountain.</p><p>In the plains, long ravines stretch out, their depths unseen.</p><p>This was originally the mountain gate of Luohun Abyss, the dojo of Old Ancestor Minghu.</p><p>Now, above the ravine, countless white clouds float, with many figures among them.</p><p>These people, with sharp brows and bright eyes, clad in pristine white, exude a clear and pure aura, devoid of any demonic energy.</p><p>In the center of the cloud cluster, nine figures, either seated or standing on a single cloud, are the Nine Immortals of Yun City.</p><p>The Nine Immortals of Yun City show excitement mixed with deep confusion, repeatedly glancing upwards.</p><p>Unseen by the other disciples, the Supreme Patriarch of Yun City, Gu Yunshou, sits cross-legged on a cloud, seemingly awaiting someone.</p><p>"Why is Master in meditative trance at this time?"</p><p>A female cultivator among the Nine Immortals whispered.</p><p>Everyone looked at Yunxi, who shook his head slightly, indicating his ignorance.</p><p>The Nine Immortals of Yun City exchanged bewildered glances.</p><p>Ancestor Minghu's foray to seize a treasure, their hasty escape, and subsequent cataclysmic events left them disoriented.</p><p>Just as the Nine Immortals were at a loss, their Master arrived, finally settling their hearts.</p><p>Unexpectedly, he ordered them to use the entire sect's strength to exterminate the corpse demons of Luohun Abyss.</p><p>The Nine Immortals were astonished but dared not disobey.  The subsequent extermination, however, went surprisingly smoothly.</p><p>Their Master personally intervened, capturing Luohun Abyss's top experts effortlessly.</p><p>The rest were disorganized and easily dealt with; most of their effort went into pursuing fleeing soldiers.</p><p>Even when attacked at the mountain gate, Ancestor Minghu did not appear to resist, making his demise clear.</p><p>The Nine Immortals were both shocked and delighted.</p><p>Their delight stemmed from Yun City finally eliminating this major threat. Their shock came from Ancestor Minghu's mysterious death.</p><p>Their Master's cultivation was no secret.  Ancestor Minghu was supposedly cultivating a powerful divine ability; even if their Master had broken through to the mid-Nascent Soul stage, defeating Ancestor Minghu would be difficult, let alone killing him.</p><p>Leaving a root would invite devastating retribution from Ancestor Minghu, which Yun City could not withstand.</p><p>Thus, while they were sworn enemies, neither side wanted a fight to the death.</p><p>Their Master's complete annihilation of Luohun Abyss and Ancestor Minghu's certain death implied that the mysterious person who issued the decree was likely a helper summoned by their Master.</p><p>These days, Yun City was unusually excited, but as they were about to completely conquer Luohun Abyss, their Master ordered a halt without explanation.</p><p>Morale began to dwindle.</p><p>Gu Yunshou was not in meditative trance; he was still pondering that day's events.</p><p>The Daoist's declaration to protect the mortal realm made Gu Yunshou's heart jump, fearing another attack.</p><p>After all, the mortal realm's chaos stemmed from two major sects using it as a chessboard, and Yun City was complicit.</p><p>He, Gu Yunshou, was one of the masterminds.</p><p>Fortunately, the Daoist spared him, only requiring Yun City to completely exterminate the demonic evils.</p><p>The Daoist didn't send anyone to monitor them. Gu Yunshou, understanding this, ordered his disciples to hand over any artifacts belonging to corpse demons above the Nascent Soul stage after their extermination.</p><p>As for the treasures within Luohun Abyss's mountain gate, Gu Yunshou dared not keep them; he invited the Daoist to collect them personally.</p><p>Otherwise, a thunder strike might instantly obliterate Yun City.</p><p>In a fleeting glimpse, Gu Yunshou couldn't discern the array's details, uncertain of its range and number of thunderbolts; he dared not offend Qin Sang.</p><p>During this time, Gu Yunshou considered all sects, including the Ji Tian Sect, but couldn't determine the Daoist's origins.</p><p>He seemed to appear out of nowhere, yet acted with absolute confidence.</p><p>And he had the means to be confident.</p><p>Cultivating both body and spirit, possessing innate spiritual treasures, a sword domain, a Daoist altar—all signs pointed to an extremely powerful sect backing the Daoist, or at least a highly skilled master.</p><p>Perhaps even a Mahayana cultivator!</p><p>Without a Mahayana cultivator's guidance, how could he comprehend the sword domain at the early Nascent Soul stage? How could he have a spirit tool brewing tea for him?</p><p>Each time Gu Yunshou thought about this, he became restless.</p><p>If he were alone, he could flee to a distant land, but relocating the sect wasn't that simple, nor could he abandon the sect's legacy.</p><p>The mortal realm was occupied by the Daoist, with numerous altars set up; expecting to leave was impossible.</p><p>Gu Yunshou's headache was managing the relationship between the two sides. He only hoped the Daoist's power and the Ji Tian Sect were not in conflict.</p><p>A clash between the two powers would leave little Yun City crushed between them.</p><p>"Alas!"</p><p>Gu Yunshou sighed, noticing the Daoist speeding towards him, and rose to greet him.</p><p>"The remnants of Luohun Abyss are hiding below. Luohun Abyss's sect formation is an ancient array obtained by the old zombie many years ago. It has some tricks.  Please help me break it."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, noncommittal.</p><p>Luohun Abyss's darkness could not impede his vision.</p><p>Through the formation, he saw one panicked face after another.</p><p>In truth, he had no grievance with Ancestor Minghu; the ancestor was merely a tool for his own Dao advancement.</p>
