<h1>Chapter 2091: Bad News</h1><p>Chapter 1960: Bad News</p><p>Fire Domain.</p><p>Within Qin Sang's cave, a phoenix-like cry suddenly rang out.</p><p>The sound was clear and filled with joy.</p><p>A crimson glow illuminated the cave, eclipsing the starlight.  The scene resembled a raging fire engulfing a starry sky. At the heart of the flames, a Vermilion Bird was reborn from the fire.</p><p>Qin Sang watched the Vermilion Bird with a strange expression.</p><p>The bird's current state clearly indicated an imminent breakthrough.</p><p>After the First Sword Servant imbued it with a spirit, the Vermilion Bird awakened, regaining its cultivation base equivalent to a late-stage Nascent Soul cultivator in the human realm. It had been stalled at the threshold of Transformation, unexpectedly breaking through now.</p><p>Qin Sang had never expected this.  He had asked the Vermilion Bird to help him comprehend a sword formation, and before the formation was even complete, he received this unexpected boon, which helped the bird overcome its bottleneck.</p><p>The Vermilion Bird's origins were peculiar, and Qin Sang wasn't clear about its exact state.</p><p>He didn't know how much the sword formation comprehension had helped the breakthrough, but it certainly wasn't a coincidence.</p><p>“Could my feeling be right?  The Four Sacred Beasts, the South represented by the Vermilion Bird... is there a hidden connection between it and the real-world Vermilion Bird clan?  Is there a connection on some level between the Southern Seven Mansions' starlight and the Vermilion Bird?”</p><p>Qin Sang mused.</p><p>Otherwise, it was inexplicable why the Vermilion Bird could have an epiphany while he was meditating.</p><p>Vermilion Bird, stars.</p><p>Wasn't the *Heavenly Demon Transformation* technique about refining the body with starlight?</p><p>For the First Sword Servant, with his cultivation and status, to specifically remind him about this technique showed that *Heavenly Demon Transformation* must be incredibly significant, perhaps one of the true techniques of the demon race.</p><p>Could it be that the fundamental path pursued by the demon race is, in part, the Stellar Path?</p><p>This showed that his previous understanding gained from the Four Sacred Beasts star region wasn't coincidental; it was related to his cultivation of *Heavenly Demon Transformation* and manifested while he was comprehending the Four Sacred Beasts sword formation, providing assistance.</p><p>The cultivation techniques unexpectedly achieved a complementary effect.</p><p>“唳!”</p><p>Another long cry interrupted Qin Sang's thoughts.</p><p>This cry held a greater urgency.</p><p>Simultaneously, the Vermilion Bird's aura fluctuated violently, the impact spreading from the cave, affecting the spiritual energy of the entire Daoist grounds and causing chaos among the fire spirit soldiers guarding it.</p><p>Ling Shi, who was cultivating, was immediately awakened.  Rushing out of the cave, he saw the stone mansion on the mountaintop suddenly open, emitting a red light.</p><p>“It’s alright, no need to panic.”</p><p>Qin Sang's words, calm and deep, reached Ling Shi and the fire spirit soldiers, instantly calming the commotion.</p><p>Ling Shi flew down the mountain to reassure the soldiers, who had been left in his charge by Gui Hou before his departure.</p><p>The red light shot out of the Daoist grounds and vanished in an instant.</p><p>Previously, when the Vermilion Bird entered the transformation stage while sleeping, its breakthrough didn't attract a Heavenly Tribulation.  He didn't know if this Transformation breakthrough would bring one, so to be safe, Qin Sang took it out of the cave to find a place to weather the tribulation.</p><p>Now, with more and more cultivators in the Fire Domain, it was difficult to find a secluded place. Qin Sang had to personally intervene, sealing off the heavens to prevent the tribulation's impact from spreading and alarming various forces.</p><p>Above a volcanic field.</p><p>Qin Sang released the restriction, and crimson fire erupted violently, flames nearly burning through the heavens.</p><p>Knowing it could now break through without reservation, the Vermilion Bird no longer suppressed itself, going all out to assault the bottleneck!</p><p>‘Whoosh! Whoosh!’</p><p>A sea of fire filled the sky, wave after wave. Any stray flame falling could cause magma to boil and mountains to collapse, creating an apocalyptic scene.</p><p>Finally, a towering pillar of fire shot from the sea of fire.</p><p>Along with the burst of the fire pillar came the Vermilion Bird's cry.  Unlike the sharp cries before, this one was deeper, filled with joy!</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The Vermilion Bird's aura surged.</p><p>Qin Sang kept an eye on the celestial phenomena. From beginning to end, there was no sign of tribulation clouds, and even when the sea of fire gradually subsided, he didn't sense any tribulation energy.</p><p>“The Vermilion Bird's cultivation in its past life certainly far exceeded the Transformation stage.  It seems that while the loss of its memories made it seem like a rebirth, starting cultivation from scratch, the ties to its past are unbreakable. In Heaven's 'eyes', it's simply gradually restoring its former cultivation.  But what was its cultivation level before? How could a powerful being at the Unity or even Mahayana stage have such a terrible personality…”</p><p>Qin Sang thought, suddenly feeling a weight on his shoulder. The Vermilion Bird had retracted its crimson fire and landed there.</p><p>Glancing sideways, Qin Sang noticed significant changes in the Vermilion Bird's appearance. Its body was more slender, its wings burned with flames, and its tail had several long feathers with strange patterns. Its aura had completely changed; it was no longer the fire crow it once was, but had something of a sacred beast about it.</p><p>However, some things never change.</p><p>Zhu Que, proud and self-satisfied, seemed to urge Qin Sang to praise him!</p><p>Qin Sang erased the traces of his work, returned to his cave, and asked Zhu Que for help in comprehending the sword formation.  Zhu Que, without a single complaint, eagerly cooperated.</p><p>After a brief attempt, Qin Sang immediately felt the difference, his eyes shining with surprise.</p><p>The sound of swords echoed through the cave.</p><p>Around Qin Sang, starlight shone brilliantly, forming two star fields. One was the Western Seven Mansions, evolved from the Seven Mansions Sword Formation, and the other was the Southern Seven Mansions!</p><p>Compared to the Western Seven Mansions, the starlight of the Southern Seven Mansions appeared faint and lacked cohesion; some stars were bright, others dim.</p><p>The seven mansions gave an impression of being scattered, each operating independently.</p><p>It wasn't worthy of being called a 'formation'!</p><p>But at the heart of the countless stars, a flame burned incredibly brightly, illuminating the entire star field.  This flame pulled all the stars together, connecting them, vaguely forming a whole.</p><p>With this flame, the rudimentary form of a 'formation' emerged!</p><p>Unexpectedly, Zhu Que's breakthrough brought about such a significant change.</p><p>Qin Sang was overjoyed; it was a double celebration – Zhu Que's breakthrough and the unexpected progress in the sword formation.</p><p>The basic framework of the sword formation was complete.  Further refinement would be far faster than anticipated.</p><p>Moreover, this understanding would greatly aid in comprehending the remaining two sword formations. Even without the Azure Dragon and Black Tortoise sacred beasts, progress would be much smoother.</p><p>"Aren't you going to thank me, Zhu Que?"</p><p>Zhu Que, sensing the change, manifested in the star sea and strutted before Qin Sang.</p><p>"Well done. You were a great help. Keep up the good work."</p><p>Qin Sang offered generous praise. He'd be happy to have breakthroughs every day, and letting Zhu Que feel proud didn't hurt.</p><p>Zhu Que, immensely pleased, enthusiastically plunged back into the star sea.</p><p>…</p><p>Achieving top honors in all three imperial examinations was exceedingly rare in Yan's history.</p><p>At the Qionglin Banquet, the top scholar was the center of attention.</p><p>The clamor eventually subsided.</p><p>While the entire nation debated whether the new top scholar was a celestial being incarnate, the scholar himself, in disguise, arrived at a small teahouse by Jade Waist Lake.</p><p>"Senior Sister, I'll have to disguise myself every time I come here," Yu Lang said, his face covered in a meticulously crafted beard, exuding a heroic air.</p><p>He wasn't afraid of people knowing his connection to the teahouse, but he didn't want to disturb Xiao Wu's tranquility and interfere with her experience of the world.</p><p>"This is Lianhu Chun tea from Yinzhou.  Try it, Top Scholar. See if it compares to the imperial tea,"</p><p>Xiao Wu personally brewed a pot of tea for Yu Lang.</p><p>"Senior Sister is teasing me."</p><p>Yu Lang pretended to complain, but his heart was full of joy.</p><p>Three years into his life in the world, his Senior Sister had changed a lot; she could now joke around.</p><p>Yu Lang thought of a slightly disrespectful description: his Senior Sister had gained more vitality.</p><p>After sipping the tea, Yu Lang complimented it, then continued, "The Crown Prince wants to recommend me to the Ministry of Revenue, but after careful consideration, I've decided to join the Hanlin Academy first."</p><p>"From what I observe, although the Emperor is elderly, his health is still relatively good; ten years is likely."</p><p>"The Emperor's words, selecting me as the top scholar, implicitly expressed his attitude towards the Crown Prince."</p><p>"I advise the Crown Prince to be patient.  The Emperor values tradition, and we are in the right. We must remain calm, unmoved by any winds of change. Tao Teng agrees."</p><p>Yu Lang chattered away, revealing his secret plans with the Crown Prince and Tao Teng, and his future aspirations without reservation.</p><p>Xiao Wu sat opposite, hand propping her chin, attentively listening.</p><p>Unbeknownst to them, dusk settled outside.</p><p>Yu Lang put down his teacup and said self-deprecatingly, "Don't laugh, Senior Sister, but I'm a bit nervous and apprehensive. I felt the pressure of fame and fortune at the Qionglin Banquet. Talking with you makes me feel much better."</p><p>He stood up, letting out a long sigh of relief.</p><p>Xiao Wu said softly, "Come often."</p><p>"Yes!"</p><p>Yu Lang nodded emphatically, leaving the teahouse feeling relieved.</p><p>…</p><p>"Five years ago, I predicted the Emperor had ten years to live. I almost thought I'd misjudged, bringing shame to my Master. Last month, the Emperor suddenly fell gravely ill. The palace spread news that his condition was critical, and everyone prepared for his death. Unexpectedly, today, the Emperor unexpectedly attended court, his complexion rosy and showing no signs of recent illness."</p><p>"This illness was strange.  Several princes lost their composure and revealed their schemes."</p><p>"The second prince is calmer than I expected, but we've found some clues.  His connections run deeper than we thought, thankfully we discovered it early!"</p><p>"Luckily, the Crown Prince is willing to listen to advice.  However, it's time for Tao to start his maneuvers."</p><p>"Oh, and by the way, Master has become a high-ranking official, but he refuses to leave the border and won't let me work on his behalf in the capital."</p><p>Only the senior and junior siblings were in the private room.</p><p>Yu Lang revealed his true appearance. He had grown a beard, and the youthful traces on his face were replaced by the bearing of someone who had held a high position for a long time.</p><p>He closed his eyes slightly, leaning against the chair back.</p><p>Only with his senior sister could he completely relax.</p><p>…</p><p>Another spring arrived.</p><p>Raindrops fell, and there weren't many guests.</p><p>Xiao Wu sat listlessly behind the counter, then looked up and saw a scholar in a green robe carrying a folding fan walk in. She smiled slightly: "You're here."</p><p>"I couldn't hide it from you, Sister!"</p><p>Yu Lang hung his head dejectedly.</p><p>His disguise techniques were already impeccable, yet no matter how he disguised himself, his sister could see through him instantly. She had no cultivation, yet her observation skills were incredibly sharp.</p><p>"Because we're too familiar with each other."</p><p>Xiao Wu took out a tin of tea, "Try the new tea that was just delivered."</p><p>They didn't go upstairs, but found a comfortable seat on the first floor with a view of the lake.</p><p>"Mother and daughter are doing well, the baby girl is here.  You should send a gift, Sister," Yu Lang said.</p><p>Xiao Wu asked happily, "What's her name?"</p><p>"Her milk name is Qi'er," Yu Lang glanced at the customers in the teahouse, then suddenly chuckled softly and secretly pointed to a scholar in the corner of the teahouse, "That Mr. Luo is here again."</p><p>The scholar sat alone, with tea and snacks spread before him, but he didn't seem to have any appetite, glancing over from time to time.</p><p>"I told you, Mr. Luo has definitely fallen for you, Sister," Yu Lang said playfully.</p><p>To avoid trouble, Xiao Wu's disguised appearance was not outstanding; she even deliberately created flaws. But inevitably, some people recognized her unique aura and were drawn to it.</p><p>"Three days ago, someone came to propose marriage on his behalf."</p><p>Xiao Wu replied calmly, without any shyness or hesitation.</p><p>"Proposed marriage?"</p><p>Yu Lang was stunned, "Sister, you didn't accept?"</p><p>Xiao Wu gave him a "are you stupid?" look.</p><p>"Sister, do you like him? Or do you have any feelings for him?" Yu Lang asked.</p><p>"No," Xiao Wu shook her head without hesitation, "I don't know what liking someone is yet, but I don't see anything different about him compared to others, so I definitely don't like him."</p><p>"Actually, Sister, you could try it.  Loving someone, being a couple for a lifetime… Master would certainly allow it," Yu Lang said thoughtfully.</p><p>Being able to love someone indicates true immersion in the world.</p><p>Being a couple for a lifetime, accompanying a partner through life, and then seeking immortality, isn't a bad deal. It would be even better if the partner is talented and can become a cultivation partner.</p><p>However, Yu Lang remembered that his sister's true form was actually a little girl of a few years old, and she was innately cold.</p><p>It was hard to imagine what it would be like for his sister to marry someone.</p><p>"Forced marriage?" Xiao Wu asked back.</p><p>Yu Lang nodded, "We can't delay this any longer.  Entering the world means following worldly customs.  That Tao fellow was practically forced into marriage and had a son.  At my mansion, matchmakers are almost breaking down the door. I've met a young lady, the daughter of the Rites Minister, beautiful and accomplished, but I need Master's approval."</p><p>"If you like her, Master will surely approve. Will Master be coming?"</p><p>Xiao Wu asked.</p><p>Qin Sang would definitely not attend; only Chen Zhenqing would be there as an elder.</p><p>"Master is concerned about the people, but he should be returning to the capital to report on his duties soon. I don't believe in auspicious times, I'll just wait until Master arrives in the capital," Yu Lang said, glancing at Mr. Luo again, silently offering his condolences.</p><p>…</p><p>"The Emperor lived a year longer than I expected, but his health is deteriorating. He's only being kept alive with medicine. The princes have already started their maneuvers. I've been too busy to come lately. The capital is full of intrigue, the situation is bound to be extremely chaotic. Sister, why don't you close shop for half a year? Things should become clearer by then!"</p><p>Yu Lang said solemnly. Xiao Wu had sealed her cultivation, becoming an ordinary person, so she would be swept up by the tide of events and had to follow along.</p><p>Xiao Wu hummed in agreement and said seriously, "Be careful!"</p><p>This warning was not for Yu Lang's personal safety.</p><p>He could withdraw at any time, but his ambitions and eleven years of efforts in the world would be wasted.</p><p>"Under our guidance, the second prince is revealing more and more flaws. The only variable is the Emperor's will! Once the will is revealed, the second prince will have no chance of recovering! Let's see if he dares to stage a coup!"</p><p>Yu Lang sneered, said a few more words to Xiao Wu, and left hurriedly.</p><p>The Crown Prince's palace, the princes' mansions, various government offices, the Qin residence, the Tao residence…</p><p>The capital, and indeed the entire Yan Kingdom, was seething with undercurrents, preparations were made in secret, countless eyes focused on the Imperial Palace, everyone waiting for a single piece of news.</p><p>Just when the situation was about to erupt.</p><p>Suddenly, an urgent report arrived in the capital.</p><p>Seeing the urgent report, Yu Lang was shocked.</p><p>The Liang Kingdom brazenly tore up the treaty, and there was a rebellion at the border!</p><p></p>
