<h1>Chapter 348: The Trap</h1><p>Liang Yan sealed the restrictive formation and walked out of the courtyard. He paused briefly, his spiritual power flashed, and he changed into a black robe, his face hidden within the hood.</p><p>Glancing at the Wind Gorge Market, Liang Yan pondered for a moment, then swiftly descended the mountain.</p><p>By now, the Heart-Eating Worm's signal had left the market, and its speed had abruptly increased. Clearly, the target was using a magical tool or escape technique.</p><p>At this point, Liang Yan could roughly discern the person's strength.</p><p>The speed wasn't fast.</p><p>Based on this, he estimated the person's cultivation to be only at the early Foundation Establishment stage.</p><p>Liang Yan's ideal scenario was to control a late Foundation Establishment cultivator. Such a powerful individual could navigate dangerous situations with ease and gather better cultivation resources for him.</p><p>An early Foundation Establishment cultivator wasn't bad either. It was a significant boost, far stronger than a Qi Refining cultivator.</p><p>Pondering this, Liang Yan reached the foot of the mountain.</p><p>He inconspicuously slowed his pace, habitually and cautiously surveying his surroundings. Finding nothing amiss, he silently activated his escape technique, vanishing from his spot and stealthily giving chase.</p><p>Liang Yan had already broken through to the mid Foundation Establishment stage, which was why he dared to pursue directly.  Without the aid of tools, he could easily keep up with his target.</p><p>In the distance, he saw a streak of white light speeding across the sky, heading straight towards the depths of the Ancient Immortal Battlefield.</p><p>He could vaguely sense spiritual power fluctuations, confirming his earlier guess: it was indeed an early Foundation Establishment cultivator!</p><p>The white light was a shuttle-shaped flying tool, of low quality, merely a high-grade tool, matching the cultivator's level.</p><p>Liang Yan nodded inwardly but didn't rush to act. He maintained the maximum tracking distance of the Heart-Eating Worm, quietly tailing the target while observing the surroundings and the cultivator's movements.</p><p>After some time, Liang Yan patiently continued to follow.</p><p>No one was following him, and the target remained alone throughout.</p><p>They were now far from the Wind Gorge Market, and the terrain began to change. Mountain peaks rose and fell, encroaching on the surrounding swamps. The fog, already thin near the market, had almost entirely disappeared.</p><p>The persistent smell of decay also faded considerably.</p><p>Suddenly, the escaping light ahead flickered and vanished without a trace.</p><p>Liang Yan remained unfazed, as he could easily sense the person's movements through the Heart-Eating Worm. He immediately changed direction, heading towards the northwest.</p><p>"This direction... Skywind Mountain, Radiant Valley, Myriad Beasts Ridge..."</p><p>Liang Yan muttered to himself. These locations, all in that direction, shared a common characteristic: although they lacked secret realms, they teemed with Cloud Beasts.</p><p>Many cultivators hunted Cloud Beasts there, collected spirit-infused objects, and earned spirit stones.  With luck, they might even find a spirit mine.</p><p>Liang Yan himself had spent time in that area during his early Foundation Establishment stage.</p><p>Everything lined up.</p><p>Liang Yan's speed suddenly increased.</p><p>The target had abandoned the conspicuous flying tool, and their escape speed dropped significantly. Liang Yan quickly caught up.</p><p>Using his concealment technique, Liang Yan quietly appeared on a mountaintop, gazing intently ahead.</p><p>The barren mountains appeared undisturbed.</p><p>Liang Yan focused his spiritual power in his eyes, staring in one direction. Although he couldn't see his target, with keen spiritual awareness, one could detect faint spiritual power fluctuations emanating from that location.</p><p>The person was speeding through the mountains, seemingly unaware of the impending danger.</p><p>Seeing this, a cold smile spread across Liang Yan's lips. Without hesitation, he activated his insect control technique, awakening the worm.</p><p>A scream suddenly echoed from ahead, and a still somewhat illusory figure tumbled out of the void, plunging into the swamp at the foot of the mountain.</p><p>*Splash!*</p><p>Mud churned and splashed.</p><p>Liang Yan didn't intend to kill the target. He only commanded the Heart-Eating Worm to severely injure their Nascent Soul, preventing any resistance before capture. He would deal with them later.</p><p>The poison worm had worked!</p><p>This was a secret technique created by a Nascent Soul ancestor. Liang Yan never doubted its effectiveness. As he awakened the worm, he moved.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, Liang Yan arrived. Simultaneously, a cyan spiritual light flickered in his palm, and a rope-like tool shot out like a serpent. This was one of Liang Yan's most relied-upon tools â€“ the Binding Cord.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>The Binding Cord transformed into a cyan streak of light, incredibly agile. Just as it was about to fly into the swamp and bind the target, a strange light suddenly erupted from the mud.</p><p>This light alternated between black and white, dazzling to the eye.</p><p>Strangely, upon colliding with the strange light, the Binding Cord became disoriented, tangling into a mess, losing its control.</p><p>Before Liang Yan could react, a sinister wind surged through the valley, and endless black fog billowed forth.</p><p>This black fog emerged from the swamp, and within it, six ghostly banners had appeared. The banners fluttered, emanating ghosts and Yin energy.</p><p>In an instant, the entire valley became filled with ghostly Qi, the wails of the damned echoing, as if transformed into a ghostly realm.</p><p>Countless eerie threads were hidden within the black fog, silently rushing towards Liang Yan.</p><p>The Ten Yama King Formation activated!</p><p>The person Liang Yan was tracking was Qin Sang!</p><p>A month had passed since Cloud Traveler's departure.</p><p>After seeing Cloud Traveler off, Qin Sang had left Tan Hao at Yin Mountain Pass to attempt his breakthrough. Qin Sang ventured into the Ancient Immortal Battlefield, armed with detailed information about the area provided by Tan Hao, who was familiar with the region around Yin Mountain Pass.</p><p>He had anticipated a difficult search, but unexpectedly, within a few days, Qin Sang, through Tan Hao's connections, located Liang Yan's cave in the Wind Gorge Market.</p><p>Perhaps feeling less pressure in recent years, Liang Yan had become less cautious about concealing his tracks. Moreover, his constant companionship with Shi Hong made him easy to find.</p><p>Since Liang Yan cultivated within the market, he wouldn't act there. Qin Sang began to operate in the vicinity, waiting for Liang Yan to leave the market before making his move.</p><p>However, Liang Yan was a dedicated cultivator, capable of enduring seclusion. For an entire month, he showed no signs of venturing out.</p><p>At this rate, it was uncertain how long Liang Yan would remain in seclusion.</p><p>Just then, good news arrived from Tan Hao.</p><p>After receiving Cloud Traveler's guidance, Tan Hao had gained some insights. During his seclusion, he was suddenly struck by inspiration.</p><p>Knowing that the longer he delayed, the slimmer his chances of breakthrough became, Tan Hao decided to risk it all. He unhesitatingly consumed the Jade Radiance Pill and the Foundation Establishment Pill, and miraculously, he succeeded in breaking through to the Foundation Establishment stage!</p><p>This amazed Qin Sang.</p><p>It wasn't uncommon for Foundation Establishment cultivators to remain in seclusion for a decade or more, and Qin Sang couldn't wait indefinitely.</p><p>Once Tan Hao arrived, Qin Sang immediately changed his plan, deciding to undo the Void Spirit Seal on his Nascent Soul and release the Heart-Eating Worm as a test.</p><p>If Liang Yan knew this poison worm technique, it would surely lure him out of seclusion!</p><p>Yin Mountain Pass was close to righteous sects, and the likelihood of Devil Sect remnants existing in the Wind Gorge Market was slim.</p><p>Even if there were a late Foundation Establishment cultivator present, Qin Sang, with his numerous treasures, particularly the Nine Dragons Celestial Chariot Talisman, was confident in his ability to escape, even if he couldn't kill them.</p><p>As a precaution, Qin Sang had Tan Hao keep watch at the entrance of the Wind Gorge Market, ready to alert him if anything went wrong, allowing him to react quickly.</p><p>This strategy had worked!</p>
