<h1>Chapter 1438 A Calculated Gambit</h1><p>Chapter 1438 A Calculated Gambit</p><p>The ice box rested in his palm.</p><p>Qin Sang, drawing on past experience, attempted to break the seal.</p><p>Inside the cave, pale light occasionally erupted, a chilling aura condensing frost on the walls.  The ice box vibrated repeatedly, yet showed no sign of opening.</p><p>After a long while, Qin Sang stopped, his brow furrowed as he stared at the ice box.  Unexpectedly, even with his spirit sense manifested, he remained helpless against the seal. He had already tried every conceivable method.</p><p>Holding the ice box, Qin Sang sat motionless, his gaze distant, seemingly lost in thought. His spirit sense was comparable to that of a Grand Cultivator.</p><p>Failing to open it, and still lacking any leads, only two possibilities remained: either his spirit sense wasn't strong enough, or some specific condition had to be met.</p><p>Even a Grand Cultivator couldn't open it.  In the foreseeable future, Qin Sang could only keep the ice box in his storage ring, pretending it didn't exist.</p><p>For a moment, Qin Sang's thoughts wandered, drifting to the person in white who stole the ice box, and to the Wan Mo Conference.</p><p>He would attend, barring any unforeseen circumstances.</p><p>“The Hun Mo Elder killed so many Yuan Ying stage cultivators from Xuan Tian Palace, creating a blood feud. Will Xuan Tian Palace still participate in the Wan Mo Conference?  As the largest event in the North Sea, the Wan Mo Conference is the biggest trading event for Yuan Ying cultivators. If the person in white is still alive, they might appear on Hun Mo Island. If Xuan Tian Palace wants to find the traitor and recover the ice box, they’ll likely send people to investigate secretly. I wonder if they have a way to sense the ice box. Should I leave it in the cave before going to Hun Mo Island?”</p><p>Qin Sang’s eyes suddenly lit up.</p><p>He decided to take the opposite approach – to take the ice box to Hun Mo Island and test Xuan Tian Palace!</p><p>This Wan Mo Conference was the perfect opportunity.</p><p>With Xuan Tian Palace and the Hun Mo Elder at odds, venturing into the heartland of the demonic path, they wouldn't dare act recklessly on Hun Mo Island.</p><p>Furthermore, Gui Mu had mentioned that the Xuan Tian Palace Master was in a strange state, possibly recovering from injuries. With the Palace Master incapacitated, others would find it hard to stop Qin Sang.</p><p>There were only two possible outcomes.</p><p>If he wasn't discovered, it meant Xuan Tian Palace had no way to sense the ice box's location, or that Qin Sang's demonic fire seal could block their detection.  Then he would have no more worries. He could leave the ice box for later study or other uses.</p><p>If Xuan Tian Palace located Qin Sang, it meant the demonic fire seal was ineffective. He wouldn't have a better way to hide the ice box. Even if he managed to deceive them temporarily, with their strength and vast resources, Xuan Tian Palace would eventually locate him if they relentlessly pursued the matter. Returning to Bei Chen Realm wouldn't be safe either; once the Palace Master recovered, they would cross the storm belt and come looking for him – an even bigger problem.</p><p>Feuding with the North Sea's most powerful force over an unopenable ice box would be unwise.</p><p>Qin Sang didn’t even know what was inside; it was likely a treasure related to ice-type cultivation, and might not even be useful to him.</p><p>Therefore, it might be better to negotiate a trade with Xuan Tian Palace.</p><p>After all, Qin Sang didn’t steal the ice box.  If he expressed this intention, Xuan Tian Palace wouldn't want to offend a top-tier expert and would likely be eager to cooperate.</p><p>While the Palace Master was weak, Qin Sang could extract more favorable terms.</p><p>‘Ding! Ding!’</p><p>Qin Sang gently tapped the ice box with his fingers, carefully weighing the matter. What could he obtain from Xuan Tian Palace?</p><p>Firstly, undoubtedly, a sea chart to the Central Plains.</p><p>The thought of the sea chart caused Qin Sang some confusion.</p><p>Sea charts weren't secret treasures. Given Gui Mu's strength, she could simply request to view one; Xuan Tian Palace had no need to conceal it.</p><p>Could Gui Mu’s goals extend beyond that?</p><p>Qin Sang nodded inwardly, believing it highly likely. Unfortunately, Tan Hao knew little about Gui Mu; otherwise, he could use that for leverage.</p><p>Secondly, the person in white's cultivation technique.</p><p>Qin Sang suspected the person in white was a rare spirit cultivator, and was quite interested in such a technique.</p><p>Thirdly, Xuan Tian Palace boasted a long history and dominated a region; their treasury must contain countless texts, possibly including secret techniques for breakthroughs beyond the late Yuan Ying stage, even to the transformation stage.</p><p>It all depended on the value of the ice box and how much he could get in return.</p><p>At the very least, Xuan Tian Palace could easily provide some spirit pills and magic treasures.</p><p>Rather than risk making countless enemies over an ice box he couldn’t open, it would be better to exchange it for things that benefited his cultivation.</p><p>For cultivators, the Dao was paramount!</p><p>Just as Qin Sang was weighing the pros and cons, he sensed the cave's restriction being triggered. Tan Hao was back.</p><p>Qin Sang put away the ice box, taking a look at the Sun God Tree.  He noticed the flames on the tree were gradually turning deep red. Once they condensed into a Sun God Bird, he could use its power.</p><p>He tried using the *Fire Seed Lotus* to subdue the Nanming Li Fire, but as expected, he failed again.</p><p>Qin Sang put away his treasure and left the cave, calling out to Tan Hao.</p><p>"Qin Xiong, you're finally out of seclusion!"</p><p>Tan Hao breathed a sigh of relief.  The Great Demon Assembly was approaching, and he'd been worried Qin Sang would miss it, but he hadn't dared disturb his seclusion. He'd been extremely anxious.</p><p>"The Great Demon Assembly has been the talk of the land for some time now. Many cultivators have already left.  What are your plans, Qin Xiong?"</p><p>"No rush."</p><p>Qin Sang smiled slightly. "Have you found out anything?"</p><p>Tan Hao nodded. He'd already recorded his findings and handed Qin Sang a jade slip.</p><p>Qin Sang probed it with his spiritual sense, quickly skimming the less important information, focusing on the emergence of the Huanglongshi Palace.</p><p>Below the Yuan Ying stage, Tan Hao had few equals. While he couldn't uncover every secret, he'd managed to find out about seventy percent.</p><p>The matter was causing a huge stir.  It wasn't just the appearance of the Huanglongshi Palace, but also involved a long-standing feud between the largest sect in the North Sea and the most powerful cultivator in the Boundless Sea.</p><p>The Huanglongshi Palace appeared in a sea area in the eastern Boundless Sea. Many people had suspected its location and searched countless times, but to no avail.</p><p>The Old Demon Hunmo likely kept a close watch on that area. As soon as there was a sign, he noticed it.</p><p>Four Xuan Tian Palace Yuan Ying cultivators, including an elder, discovered the Huanglongshi Palace. They were killed by the Old Demon Hunmo while trying to claim its treasures.  Along with Qi and Wang, the Old Demon Hunmo slaughtered several Yuan Ying cultivators in a short time.</p><p>There were also rumors that several other demons participated in the massacre.</p><p>The Old Demon Hunmo and his associates risked angering Xuan Tian Palace, so they must have obtained something of great value.</p><p>The Ice Bone Demon Hand on the list likely came from the Huanglongshi Palace.  It’s no secret in the Boundless Sea that Huanglongshi once discovered the secret realm of the ancient demonic sect, Ice Bone Dao, and obtained its legacy.</p><p>"They say there are more treasures of the Ice Bone Dao at the Great Demon Assembly. Why did the Old Demon act so quickly?  Was he desperately trying to exchange something? Tan Hao couldn't find out about this, but True Person Yinquan probably knows something.  Conveniently, I have something I need to ask him."</p><p>Qin Sang withdrew his spiritual sense, pondered for a moment, and then left the cave with Tan Hao.</p><p>After taking Tan Hao to a safe place near Hunmo Island and agreeing on a method of contact, Qin Sang changed direction and headed to Mingzhu Island alone.</p>
