<h1>Chapter 548: The Spirit Tide (Extra chapter for the alliance leader, Wang Duo Yu!)</h1><p>Chapter 548: The Spirit Tide (Extra chapter for the alliance leader, Wang Duo Yu!)</p><p>The stone hall's doors were tightly shut.</p><p>The surrounding walls were inlaid with a circle of moonstones, emitting a gentle, fluorescent light that illuminated the vast hall.  Some parts of the hall were furnished with meditation cushions, and several cultivators from the Shangyuan Quiet Palace were in meditation.</p><p>Several Shangyuan Quiet Palace cultivators stood beside a teleportation array, explaining to those who had just arrived.</p><p>“Fellow cultivators, the spirit tide is at its most intense right now. Please wait in the hall. Once the tide subsides, we will send you to Xuanlu Pass.”</p><p>Qin Sang was among the first to arrive via teleportation.  He had experience with this, and his condition was much better than the last time.  He nodded to the Shangyuan Quiet Palace attendant, found a quiet corner, took a moment to adjust his breath, and quickly recovered.</p><p>He remembered the last time he was here; a celestial phenomenon was attacking, and the grand formation here protected the entire valley. Now, everyone was huddled in this stone hall. The power of the spirit tide was truly legendary.</p><p>The stone hall trembled constantly, and the seven-colored restrictive light on the stone door flickered erratically, indicating the ferocity of the external impact.</p><p>The unknown is always the most terrifying.</p><p>Unable to see what was happening outside the stone hall, and with the restrictions on the stone door seeming so fragile, everyone felt uneasy.</p><p>Qin Sang got up and approached the cultivator who seemed to be in charge, a middle-aged Daoist with a fair complexion and no beard, a late Foundation Establishment cultivator.</p><p>“Senior Brother, please allow me to introduce myself. I am Qin Sang from Xiaohua Mountain.”</p><p>Xiaohua Mountain and Shangyuan Quiet Palace had a close relationship, and disciples often addressed each other as brothers and sisters.</p><p>The man sized up Qin Sang, then looked suddenly enlightened, bowing. “No wonder you look familiar!  You are the renowned Shadowless Sword, Senior Brother Qin! I am Chen Kuqing, it is an honor to meet you.”</p><p>“My pleasure…”</p><p>Qin Sang keenly sensed the unusual glint in Chen Kuqing's eyes when he heard his name.</p><p>Not just Chen Kuqing, but several other Shangyuan Quiet Palace disciples showed the same reaction; those with less stable temperaments were even more obvious.</p><p>This unusual look was not one of respect or admiration; it certainly wasn't due to the reputation of the Shadowless Sword.</p><p>Qin Sang had experienced this strange look yesterday and guessed the reason.</p><p>The renowned Shadowless Sword, rumored to be Xiaohua Mountain's top cultivator below the Golden Core stage, was considered one of the most promising candidates for Golden Core advancement among the current Foundation Establishment cultivators in the Xiaohan region.</p><p>At the time, his cultivation hadn't even reached the False Core stage.</p><p>Later, in the battle on Zhidian Peak, he bravely won the Snow Spirit Lotus and the Iris Flower, two rare medicinal herbs, incurring the envy and hatred of countless others.</p><p>From the perspective of others, with these two herbs, the Shadowless Sword’s Golden Core breakthrough was a certainty, adding another Golden Core cultivator to Xiaohua Mountain.</p><p>Unexpectedly, two years ago, news suddenly spread from Xiaohua Mountain that the Shadowless Sword had failed his Golden Core breakthrough after taking the herbs, causing an uproar.</p><p>“Such a waste!”</p><p>Whenever this matter was mentioned, countless people lamented and cursed, wishing they could have taken the herbs instead; among them, reportedly, were disciples of Xiaohua Mountain.</p><p>Fame can be a burden!</p><p>Qin Sang sighed inwardly, shaking his head.</p><p>His performance in the Random Islands was indeed impressive, but he kept a low profile, and his two magic treasures weren't easily used openly, so it wasn’t as spectacular as it seemed. He had become unexpectedly famous.</p><p>Qin Sang knew his limits.  At that time, without using his ebony sword, he wasn't among the top cultivators.  Xiaohua Mountain alone had many true disciples of Golden Core cultivators; those people didn't lack resources, and had their masters' protection, so they didn't need to fight in battles to improve their cultivation.</p><p>This fame gave him the opportunity to enter Zhidian Peak, but it also put him in the spotlight, with countless people watching for his downfall.</p><p>Wait until I return from the Ziwei Palace, I'll shock you all!</p><p>Qin Sang thought to himself, pretending not to notice their thoughts, and said calmly, “Senior Brother Chen, how long do you think this spirit tide will last? I remember that there’s still a distance between here and Xuanlu Pass. I wonder how dangerous the road is?”</p><p>Even at his lowest point, Qin Sang was not someone they dared to insult.</p><p>Chen Kuqing and others only dared to think such thoughts in their hearts; outwardly, they were extremely respectful.</p><p>“Senior Brother Qin, this spirit tide has been almost constant, however, its intensity fluctuates.  Generally, there is a brief lull every few days. You will have to wait for a lull and hurry to Xuanlu Pass.  You don't need to worry about safety on the way. The Xuanlu Guards will also leave the city during the lulls to clear out the cloud beasts to prevent them from accumulating. One route conveniently passes by our location.”</p><p>"If something unexpected happens..." Chen Kuiqing paused, subtly pointing towards the depths of the stone hall, "My senior uncle will definitely come to the rescue."</p><p>Qin Sang understood.  A Golden Core cultivator from the Shangyuan Quiet Palace was stationed here.</p><p>It wasn't surprising. This ancient teleportation array was of great significance and couldn't be allowed to fail.</p><p>...</p><p>After patiently waiting two more days in the stone hall, the tremors from the stone door noticeably weakened.</p><p>Everyone was alerted and rose, gathering before the stone door to wait.</p><p>The shaking lessened, the restrictions on the door gradually stabilizing.  However, Chen Kuiqing kept them waiting for another two hours before opening the door.</p><p>"Everyone, let's go!" Chen Kuiqing gave a sly smile.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>The door opened, and a sudden gust of wind rushed in. The first few Foundation Establishment cultivators gasped, losing their footing and nearly falling.</p><p>Qin Sang was the first to dart out of the stone hall, then gasped in surprise.</p><p>Before them was a vast plain.</p><p>The deep valley they remembered was gone, only half a cliff face remained behind them, the other half somehow leveled!</p><p>A terrifying spiritual tide, capable of altering the very landscape.</p><p>Braving the wind, Qin Sang stood suspended in mid-air, silently gazing out.</p><p>Apart from the constant wind, there were no thunder, fire, or blizzards—phenomena Qin Sang had grown accustomed to—which seemed less fearsome than the actual celestial events.</p><p>But looking up revealed the anomaly.</p><p>High above, colorful, bizarre lights flickered constantly, filling the entire sky.  Upon closer inspection, these lights were the reflection of intensely concentrated spiritual energy, like a tidal wave.</p><p>Looking further ahead revealed a clearer picture.</p><p>Where the earth met the sky, spiritual energy surged like a boundless ocean, vast and magnificent.</p><p>The colossal waves collided, rising higher and higher, finally forming towering waves that crashed down in all directions, running rampant.</p><p>Everyone felt as though a real ocean was pouring down from the sky!</p><p>Amidst the raging waves, a deafening roar erupted, causing everyone's hearts to leap.</p><p>The spiritual tide brought not only a breathtaking spectacle but also a terrible pressure.</p><p>An omnipresent pressure from above and below pressed down, making them feel like they couldn't breathe.</p><p>A deep sense of powerlessness washed over them.</p><p>Only then did they realize how small and fragile they were in the face of true celestial power.</p>
