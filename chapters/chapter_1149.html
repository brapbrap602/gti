<h1>Chapter 1141: Colleagues</h1><p>Earlier, Qin Sang caught a glimpse of the celebratory banquet from afar.</p><p>She noticed not only human figures but also female cultivators among them.  It was unclear whether they hailed from Wan Yao City or had been captured from elsewhere by the  Qianji  妖王.</p><p>These people seemed to have been in the Wan She Abyss for a long time, having adapted to the ferocious beasts.  While the lesser demons lusted after human flesh, they were restrained by the more intelligent beasts, suppressing their instincts.</p><p>However, it remained uncertain whether they could always remain safe in the Wan She Abyss.</p><p>Qin Sang infiltrated the area alone.</p><p>Bai had already set up a large formation elsewhere, awaiting her return.</p><p>Qin Sang secretly observed the layout of the Demon King's lair.</p><p>The terrain here was quite unique.</p><p>The Wan She Abyss formed a massive pocket in this area, unusually open, with mountains of varying heights scattered within.  At the foot of these mountains lay a marshland, seemingly connected to an underground river.</p><p>The Wan She Abyss was devoid of sunlight, yet it teemed with strange flowers and plants, lush and vibrant, the mountains being no exception.</p><p>Three treasure vaults were distributed among the smaller hills.</p><p>“This place is protected by spirit formations, and guards patrol constantly.  It won't be easy to sneak in unnoticed; I'll have to wait for the guard shift…”</p><p>Using her celestial eye ability, Qin Sang clearly saw the positions of the guards.</p><p>She had already figured out their pattern: the Demon King allowed the guards to take turns enjoying the delicacies at the banquet.</p><p>This was the perfect time to infiltrate.</p><p>She waited patiently, remaining motionless.</p><p>Time slowly passed.</p><p>The atmosphere at the banquet became increasingly lively.</p><p>The guards in the lair seemed to have smelled the enticing aroma of the food and wine, their minds wandering, frequently glancing towards the banquet and swallowing hard.</p><p>“Damn it!  Did Bai Mao Ying get drunk and forget to relieve us?”</p><p>Atop the smallest hill, outside a stone pavilion, two mountain-sized pythons, one black and one white, spoke in human tongues.</p><p>These two demons were responsible for guarding the Demon King's lair.</p><p>They watched the dark lake longingly, their desire intense, but without the Demon King's orders, they dared not leave their posts, only sighing together.</p><p>After waiting for so long, they could barely contain themselves, the black python cursing loudly.</p><p>“Bai Mao Ying is arrogant, but he wouldn't dare to blatantly deceive us.  Or should you go plead with the Lady? She's soft-hearted; maybe she'll let us go have a drink. It's only for a short while.  Who's bold enough to infiltrate the Demon King's lair?”</p><p>The white python said nonchalantly.</p><p>“Why don't you go?”</p><p>The black python glared. “If the Demon King finds out we neglected our duty for a drink, our skins will be peeled off!”</p><p>At that moment, a whooshing sound came from ahead.</p><p>A white-feathered eagle, swaggering with a confident gait, wobbled over with a group of lesser demons, their little faces flushed, clearly intoxicated.</p><p>The two pythons rejoiced, whistling.</p><p>The other patrolling demons immediately rushed towards the spirit formation entrance like hungry wolves.</p><p>“Finally, he didn't forget about us!”</p><p>The black python lashed its tail at Bai Mao Ying, creating a strong gust of wind.</p><p>Bai Mao Ying flapped its wings, deflecting the wind, belched, and boasted, “The celestial brew the King prepared today is amazing! I don't even want to sober up! Hurry up, or you'll miss it!”</p><p>Hearing this, the two pythons cursed again before preparing to rush off for the drinks.</p><p>Bai Mao Ying suddenly stopped the black python, pointed towards the depths of the lair, and transmitted, “How is the Young Lady's mood?”</p><p>“Heh heh, Qing brother was ordered to guard the Young Lady's chambers under the guise of protection, but he got scolded terribly. We didn't dare go near, keeping our distance to avoid trouble.”</p><p>The black python chuckled, gloating.</p><p>Bai Mao Ying smacked his lips.  “When the ladies squabble, the little demons suffer.”</p><p>“You stay here and guard! Wait for me!”</p><p>The black python tossed a token to Bai Mao Ying, and seeing the white python already far off, it quickly chased after.</p><p>Bai Mao Ying and his men entered the formation, activated the token to reseal it, made their arrangements, then circled the area once to confirm everything was in order before returning to the stone pavilion for a rest.</p><p>By this time, Qin Sang had successfully infiltrated.</p><p>The demonic beasts were still engrossed in their feast, completely oblivious to the tail that had followed them. Even Bai Mao Ying, whose cultivation was only at the mid-Core Formation stage, couldn't possibly detect Qin Sang.</p><p>Having infiltrated, Qin Sang breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p>But this was only the beginning.</p><p>“The banquet will last for a while, plenty of time to search. However, Dark Lake is close by, and the Qianji Demon King can arrive in an instant. I must be careful. I'll first observe the restrictions on the three possible treasure vaults to see if there's any opportunity…”</p><p>Qin Sang pondered this, quietly approaching one of the mountains.</p><p>A stone wall stood on the mountain.</p><p>The stone wall concealed a secret space.</p><p>Earlier, during the guard change, Bai Mao Ying immediately sent a squad of minor demons to stand guard before the stone wall, remaining motionless.  Even Bai Mao Ying himself circled the area before feeling reassured.</p><p>Qin Sang hid beneath a tree, ordering the Sky-Eyed Butterfly to use its abilities to observe the restrictions on the stone wall.</p><p>Clearly, these restrictions were personally set by the Qianji Demon King.</p><p>The Sky-Eyed Butterfly, which could even find flaws in ancient restrictions, identified two weak points in the barrier—places where it might be possible to break through. However, doing so would inevitably cause a significant disturbance, immediately alerting the Qianji Demon King.</p><p>After observing for a while, Qin Sang quietly retreated and went to another potential treasure vault.  This one proved equally challenging.</p><p>This showed that even if these locations didn't contain treasures, they were still extremely important to the Qianji Demon King.</p><p>Without acting rashly, Qin Sang went to the Qianji Demon King's cave.</p><p>He had investigated all three potential locations of treasure vaults.</p><p>Qin Sang secretly estimated that even if he could silently break the restrictions one by one, he could only open at most one, without alerting the Demon King.</p><p>Once the banquet ended, the Qianji Demon King would return, so he had to leave before then.</p><p>“The protective formation is only partially activated. If I wait for the Feather Demon King to draw the Qianji Demon King away—whether he will or not is another matter—the full power of the formation will be unleashed, making infiltration impossible. Moreover, the Thousand Mountain Bamboo Sea will no longer provide cover…”</p><p>Qin Sang hesitated for a moment, then recalled what he had overheard: the Qianji Demon King had a favored concubine here.</p><p>The concubine certainly wasn't a powerful transformed demon; capturing her shouldn't be difficult.</p><p>She was close to the Qianji Demon King and might know something useful.</p><p>Thinking this, Qin Sang looked towards a somewhat secluded mountain peak, with elegantly refined buildings on it.</p><p>He avoided the guards and was about to approach when, suddenly, the Sky-Eyed Butterfly gave a warning.</p><p>Qin Sang stopped abruptly, surprised to find a dark figure stealthily emerging from the woods on the mountain ahead, its target also the concubine's quarters!</p><p>“When did they get in?”</p><p>Qin Sang was startled.</p><p>—</p><p>—</p><p>Listen to your brother's advice, I'll post just one chapter today, get some sleep early, and write more tomorrow.</p>
