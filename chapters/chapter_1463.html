<h1></h1><p>The Old Demon Hunmo disdained to argue.</p><p>He reached into his mustard seed pouch and took out a silver bottle. Tilting the bottle, he poured out a drop of silver liquid.</p><p>Then, his fingers moved like wheels, completing a talisman seal in an instant. He raised his hand and pressed it into the drop of water, turning it from silver to black. Then, he flicked his finger lightly.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>The water drop flew towards Qin Sang, but before Qin Sang could react, it suddenly burst apart in the high sky, disappearing without a trace.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't discern what the Old Demon Hunmo was planning. He secretly became vigilant, busily urging the Demonic Banner, while also activating the seed of fire within his Violet Palace.</p><p>The seed of fire could no longer be called a fire lotus seed at this point. It had already begun to form flower buds, gradually transforming into a fire lotus.</p><p>'Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!'</p><p>Demonic Flames manifested in the world. After fusing with the fire lotus, the rejection of Qin Sang was reduced to the lowest level. Although it didn't have the feeling of perfect harmony like the Demonic Flames within the fire lotus, he could still wield it freely, without the previous feeling of sluggishness.</p><p>All the Demonic Flames gathered into a ball, then transformed into a fiery dragon, its head facing the Old Demon Hunmo, baring its fangs and brandishing its claws.</p><p>At this moment, the weather changed, and it suddenly began to rain.</p><p>This was no ordinary rain. The rain water was black, extremely malevolent, and exuded an aura of decay.</p><p>Crackle! Crackle!</p><p>In an instant, a torrential downpour submerged the fiery dragon.</p><p>But everything around was normal. Except for the sea surface affected by the Frost Rune in the far rear, it was all clear skies for thousands of miles.</p><p>Qin Sang concentrated and sensed the fiery dragon. After a moment, the tension on his face relaxed, revealing a hint of a smile. The Nine Nether Demonic Flames were originally the divine power of ancient demons. The Old Demon Hunmo's demonic techniques might be able to weaken other spiritual flames, but they were ineffective against the Nine Nether Demonic Flames!</p><p>The Demonic Flame Dragon swam leisurely in the heavy rain, devouring all the black water.</p><p>The Old Demon Hunmo's expression was somewhat unsightly. He didn't have much expectation for this Corrosive Yin Poison Water, but seeing that it couldn't cause the slightest trouble for the Demonic Flames and Qin Sang, he was quite alarmed.</p><p>Immediately, the Old Demon Hunmo no longer hesitated. Black demonic light surged out from the top of his staff. Twisting slightly, it transformed into a long spear. Leaving a series of afterimages in mid-air, it stabbed towards Qin Sang with astonishing speed.</p><p>Qin Sang only felt a faint pain between his eyebrows.</p><p>He was no stranger to this type of demonic light released by the Black Bamboo Staff.</p><p>They had exchanged blows in the Buddha Hall.</p><p>However, the Old Demon Hunmo had made a hasty move that time and hadn't used his full strength. He also had to divide his attention to seize treasures and conceal himself. He wasn't in his peak condition.</p><p>Now was the Old Demon Hunmo's true strength.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't dare to be careless. He raised his hand and guided the fiery dragon, colliding head-on with the spear of demonic light.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The spear of demonic light was incomparably sharp, piercing straight into the fiery dragon's body.</p><p>In the next moment, the fiery dragon exploded violently.</p><p>The earth-shattering roar caused the hearts of everyone nearby to skip a beat, shocked by the terrifying momentum.</p><p>The Demonic Flames scattered and receded, while the demonic light had already collapsed, unable to coalesce.</p><p>Seeing this scene, Qin Sang's confidence grew stronger and stronger.</p><p>In the early stage of the Nascent Soul realm, he could already use Demonic Flames to threaten Old Demon Ye.</p><p>Now, his cultivation and divine sense had both leaped forward. He should be even stronger. However, he hadn't had the opportunity to face a Great Cultivator head-on after his breakthrough. He couldn't accurately assess his strength, so he had always acted with caution.</p><p>Now that the Old Demon Hunmo had caught up and he was forced to face him head-on.</p><p>With two trump cards in reserve, Qin Sang didn't hold back. He finally verified his strength. After the Reforging of the Gold Submergence Sword, apart from his True Essence not being as strong as the opponent's and unable to support long-term consumption, he wasn't inferior to a Great Cultivator in the slightest!</p><p>The Old Demon Hunmo snorted and tightly gripped the Black Bamboo Staff.</p><p>Starting from the handle, strands of interweaving lines spread downwards, covering the entire Black Bamboo Staff.</p><p>Then, the greatly transformed Black Bamboo Staff was thrown out by the Old Demon Hunmo. The main body disappeared in a flash, turning into an extremely swift shadow.</p><p>Qin Sang only felt a strong wind rushing towards his face. He hurriedly urged the Demonic Flames to block it.</p><p>'Bang!'</p><p>The shadow of the Black Bamboo Staff was outlined above the Demonic Flames.</p><p>The fiery dragon was actually scattered on the spot. Countless flames flew everywhere in the void. The Old Demon Hunmo had regained some ground. However, the Demonic Flames were of a very high rank. Even the Old Demon Hunmo, as strong as he was, could only scatter them, unable to annihilate them.</p><p>Seeing the Demonic Flames re-condensing.</p><p>The Old Demon Hunmo was even more annoyed. He reached out and grabbed forcefully to the side, his target being the Demon Subduing Token.</p><p>The character 'Token' shone brightly.</p><p>The surrounding sword threads suddenly solidified. The Demon Subduing Token was as sharp as a knife, forcibly breaking through the sword array blockade.</p><p>Qin Sang sighed inwardly, recalling the Gold Submergence Sword, while also calculating the distance in his mind.</p><p>He had been retreating while fighting, and he was already not far from the Lost Trail Formation. With so many people watching covetously nearby, he didn't want to be entangled with the Old Demon Hunmo here.</p><p>"Almost there!"</p><p>Qin Sang flashed this thought, and saw the Demon Subduing Token pressing down horizontally. Under the deterrence of the Demon Subduing Token, the Demonic Flames became sluggish, and the speed of re-condensation suddenly slowed down.</p><p>Qin Sang pretended to be unable to resist, his eyes revealing shock. He forcefully gathered the Demonic Flames, and actively crashed towards the Black Bamboo Staff, then turned around and fled.</p><p>The Old Demon Hunmo's anger hadn't subsided. How could he allow Qin Sang to escape like this? The Black Bamboo Staff and the Demon Subduing Token immediately locked onto Qin Sang.</p><p>Having suffered a loss in the Buddha Hall, he didn't try to use Dao techniques to hold Qin Sang back. That would be countered by that strange divine light that breaks all laws, and would lead to a missed opportunity instead.</p><p>The Shifting Shadows could only be used once within a certain period of time. If Qin Sang shook him off, he would never be able to catch up again.</p><p>'Whoosh! Whoosh!'</p><p>On the boundless sea, two figures chased and flew, the light of treasures flashing frequently, engaging in fierce combat.</p><p>The Qin Sang in front seemed to be in a sorry state, but his eyes were extremely calm.</p><p>At this time, Qin Sang's gaze dropped, sweeping over the reefs under the sea surface, and the corners of his mouth slightly curved.</p><p>At the same time, the Old Demon Hunmo's spiritual sense suddenly felt a strange abnormality coming from below. His heart tightened, and his expression changed slightly.</p><p>"Trap!"</p><p>These two words flashed through his mind. Although the Old Demon Hunmo was shocked, he wasn't flustered. He wasn't even that surprised.</p><p>The Nascent Souls who participated in the Myriad Demons Assembly were all cunning and treacherous. Leaving a backup plan and being prepared for anything was the norm. Seeing Qin Sang flying south with all his heart, the Old Demon Hunmo actually had a premonition.</p><p>However, his speed was not as fast as Qin Sang, and he couldn't gain an overwhelming advantage. He could only try his best to keep him here, which was a helpless move. In addition, the Lost Trail Formation was hidden enough, making it difficult to predict its location. Stepping into the trap was unavoidable.</p><p>A fog suddenly appeared from nowhere, instantly shrouding this sea area.</p><p>The Old Demon Hunmo reacted extremely quickly. Detecting the abnormality, his figure immediately flew back. At the same time, he recalled his magic weapons. The Demon Subduing Token was suspended high above his head, and then it was swallowed by the fog.</p><p>With the Demon Subduing Token protecting his body, the Old Demon Hunmo didn't worry about his own safety. He even hoped it was some kind of killing array, so he could escape faster. That way, the opponent would lose his backup plan, and he could completely rely on his powerful True Essence to exhaust the opponent to death.</p><p>However, the next discovery disappointed the Old Demon Hunmo.</p><p>The Old Demon Hunmo pinched his fingers and tapped heavily between his eyebrows.</p><p>His eyes were pitch black, turning into Demon Eyes. Deep black light flickered in his eyes, seemingly able to see through the fog. After a moment, the Old Demon Hunmo spat out three words in a rather gloomy manner.</p><p>"Lost Trail Formation!"</p><p>A Lost Trail Formation, and a pure Lost Trail Formation at that!</p><p>No wonder it was hidden so seamlessly.</p><p>The Old Demon Hunmo's mind raced. The good news was that he had reacted quickly. He should be at the edge of the Lost Trail Formation at this time, and he was experienced. He stayed in place and didn't wander around in the formation.</p><p>If the formation changed, he would definitely be able to sense it.</p><p>The situation hadn't reached the worst point. As long as he found the correct method, he might still have time.</p><p>At the same time.</p><p>Behind the Lost Trail Formation.</p><p>The Old Demon Hunmo's disciple, the black-robed man, followed behind Guiling (Ghost Spirit), hanging back. It wasn't that he didn't want to help his master, it was just that he was unable to do so. He couldn't catch up at all.</p><p>He also had to be wary of others, lest someone had twisted thoughts about Guiling, who was in a weakened state.</p><p>During this period of time, the Nascent Souls of the Xuantian Palace had arrived one after another, giving them enough confidence, and they were also ready to make a move.</p><p>The black-robed man was mainly wary of them. Although he had already sent the message back to Demon Subduing Island, reinforcements couldn't arrive so quickly.</p><p>He thought he could sit back and watch the tigers fight, and profit from it. He didn't expect his side to turn into a tiger instead.</p><p>Seeing the fog rising on the sea surface from afar, enveloping the Old Demon Hunmo, it was obviously strange. The black-robed man's mind was tense, worried about his master's situation.</p><p>At this moment, the Guiling next to him suddenly turned his head. The evil and madness in his eyes seemed to be on the verge of being suppressed. Staring at the black-robed man, he said, "Blood..."</p><p>The black-robed man only felt a chill all over his body. He immediately realized that this was his master's order, and gritted his teeth to force out a ball of essence blood.</p><p>Guiling swallowed the essence blood in one gulp. The madness on his body became even stronger. He pounced towards the sea fog, while also shooting out two beams of blood light from his eyes, deeply piercing into the sea fog.</p><p>The Old Demon Hunmo in the Lost Trail Formation didn't move at all. His pitch-black Demon Eyes kept staring behind him.</p><p>Just then, the Old Demon Hunmo seemed to sense something. His expression changed slightly, and the Demon Eyes turned slightly.</p><p>Then, his figure suddenly floated to the right, and then forward again.</p><p>For a time, the Old Demon Hunmo seemed to have received clear guidance. His figure was like a ghost, sometimes to the left, sometimes to the right, sometimes in front, sometimes behind.</p><p>This was one of the reasons why he left Guiling behind.</p><p>First, Guiling consumed a lot of energy after Shifting Shadows, making it difficult to play a role in battle.</p><p>Second, it was to guard against similar traps. He could use the connection between him and Guiling, as well as the Demon Eye divine power, to get out of the Lost Trail Formation as quickly as possible.</p><p>Before long, the edge of the sea fog shook, and a figure emerged.</p><p>The Old Demon Hunmo flashed out. His indifferent gaze swept over the people from Xuantian Palace who were chasing behind him, then he turned his head to look forward. He could even see the escaping light on the horizon.</p><p>This showed how fast his movements were!</p><p>At this time, Qin Sang also sensed that the Old Demon Hunmo had escaped from the Lost Trail Formation. The corners of his eyes twitched rapidly. This was the carefully arranged formation, but it only trapped the old demon for such a short time.</p><p>Fortunately, he had prepared according to the defense against Xuantian Palace, and prepared two backup plans.</p><p>The Old Demon Hunmo bypassed the Ghost Fog (Guiling's blood mist) and followed closely.</p><p>Although his escape technique wasn't as good as Qin Sang's and the distance between the two gradually increased, the Old Demon Hunmo didn't mean to stop.</p><p>Seeing this situation, Qin Sang began to be unsure. He suspected that the Old Demon Hunmo still had a great divine power similar to Shifting Shadows.</p><p>He flipped his palm and took out the Pill Cauldron Token from the Thousand Jun Ring, held it in his hand, and turned his escaping light to fly towards the southwest. If he couldn't shake off the Old Demon Hunmo, he could only look for help.</p><p>For a time.</p><p>The southwest direction of Demon Subduing Island was in chaos.</p><p>Qin Sang and the Old Demon Hunmo flew one after the other. The superb escape techniques displayed by the two caused everyone to marvel and be shocked.</p><p>Behind them.</p><p>Xuantian Palace didn't give up. They followed far behind, and their numbers were increasing, becoming the strongest force. However, they had been thrown far behind.</p><p>The passing Nascent Souls were alarmed by the strange phenomena here, and were full of suspicion.</p><p>Most people chose to stay away after taking a look, but some were bold and skillful, stayed and spied from a distance.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>...</p><p>The Old Demon Hunmo was incredibly persistent and still unwilling to give up, which made Qin Sang dare not relax.</p><p>After flying an unknown distance.</p><p>Through the Pill Cauldron Token, Qin Sang sensed that True Person Yinquan was getting closer and closer.</p><p>"He really lured the Old Demon Hunmo over. This time, I'm afraid I have to bleed a lot to satisfy the appetite of the Pill Cauldron Society."</p><p>Qin Sang smiled bitterly in his heart.</p><p>Fortunately, Xuantian Palace was far behind and no longer posed a threat. Otherwise, True Person Yinquan would definitely turn around and leave when he saw this scene, and no amount of ancient formulas would be useful.</p><p>At this time, the Old Demon Hunmo knew that it was impossible to catch up with Qin Sang.</p><p>The reason why he didn't give up was because he saw Qin Sang suddenly turn, suspecting that he might have some arrangement, or had a helper there.</p><p>As the overlord of the Boundless Sea and one of the few Great Cultivators in the North Sea, the Old Demon Hunmo knew very well what the origins of the troublesome Old Demons in the Boundless Sea were, and what methods they had.</p><p>But that didn't include this person.</p><p>This person seemed to have popped out of a crack in a rock, appearing out of thin air.</p><p>Such a guy was the most troublesome.</p><p>Unburdened and unrestrained.</p><p>The Old Demon Hunmo was going to trick him, hoping to trick out the other party's helper, so as to find out the other party's background. As long as he found out the origin, he could start from other aspects and not worry about not being able to deal with it.</p><p>Thinking of this.</p><p>The Old Demon Hunmo locked onto Qin Sang firmly with his divine sense.</p><p>Qin Sang could break free from the lock, but he didn't do so, because the distance was still too close. Even if he got rid of the lock, it was impossible for him to stop the escape light and hide nearby.</p><p>He would wait until he pulled away a certain distance.</p><p>Seeing that the Old Demon Hunmo didn't have any movements, Qin Sang gradually understood, and began to suspect that the old demon was bluffing. Looking at the Pill Cauldron Token in his hand, he hesitated a bit.</p><p>It wasn't that he was reluctant to pay the reward.</p><p>The undrawn card has the best effect.</p><p>If he could get rid of the Old Demon Hunmo by his own strength and make the old demon think wildly, he would be even more afraid of himself.</p><p>The two people had their own thoughts.</p><p>This chase and escape, I don't know when it will end.</p><p>Suddenly.</p><p>The black escaping light stopped abruptly.</p><p>The Old Demon Hunmo's figure suddenly stopped. His brows furrowed, and he turned to look north.</p><p>In the distant sky.</p><p>A dark cloud floated over at some point.</p><p>The dark cloud quietly hovered in the high sky. Then, the Old Demon Hunmo noticed two spying gazes, watching here without hiding anything.</p><p>"That old demon hasn't left yet, he was also alarmed..."</p><p>The Old Demon Hunmo's eyes narrowed, and he immediately realized something, looking forward and backward respectively.</p><p>Now, in front of him was an unknown peak expert, his way was blocked by Xuantian Palace behind him, and there was a Demon Saint spying in the north. He had unknowingly fallen into the encirclement of three forces.</p><p>He had to treat any one of them with caution.</p><p>Although the possibility of these three forces joining forces to deal with him was very small, he had to guard against it.</p><p>After thinking for a while, the Old Demon Hunmo flicked his sleeves, and unceremoniously met the gaze of the Great Sage Tianpeng (Heavenly Roc) from afar, giving up the pursuit and returning the same way.</p><p>The dark clouds paused and slowly drifted north.</p><p>The Boundless Sea was mainly dominated by human forces after all. The Great Sage Tianpeng was just here to take a look. He didn't expect the old demon to be so obedient, not giving him a chance.</p><p>Before leaving, the Great Sage Tianpeng looked strangely in the direction where Qin Sang escaped. He seemed to have sensed the demonic aura just now. He thought it was a member of the same race, but it disappeared before he could see it clearly.</p><p>The Old Demon Hunmo flew towards them.</p><p>The people from Xuantian Palace looked at each other, and looked at the Two Elders Mei and Lan (Plum and Orchid).</p><p>"What should we do now? The old demon seems to have a feud with that person, and he may want to join forces with us."</p><p>Elder Mei asked in a low voice.</p>
