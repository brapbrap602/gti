<h1>Chapter 853: Evasive Answers</h1><p>Mei Ran Gong's guess was right; Qin Sang's true energy was nearly depleted. If the battle continued, he would soon have to resort to the Corpse Pill.</p><p>But the Corpse Pill hadn't been enhanced since its creation. While it could be used to escape with a talisman, it was insufficient for a fierce battle against strong opponents, especially one involving a late-stage expert.</p><p>The Corpse Pill had become somewhat useless.</p><p>However, Qin Sang had an idea, one he'd pondered for a long time, a possible use for the Corpse Pill.</p><p>The *Kindling Yuan Demon Fetus* technique, an evil method for creating external avatars, included a secret art for cultivating a demon pill, creating one for the external avatar.</p><p>Otherwise, allowing the external avatar to independently achieve the pill formation stage would be almost impossible.</p><p>In Qin Sang's opinion, this secret art seemed to perfectly fit the external pill method, though it couldn't be separated from the *Kindling Yuan Demon Fetus*, making it unusable by ordinary cultivators.</p><p>But it wasn't completely unmodifiable.</p><p>The Corpse Pill was an external pill connected to Qin Sang's Qi. The *Kindling Yuan Demon Fetus* created his external avatar; the two were intrinsically linked.  Therefore, Qin Sang planned to use the secret art to reshape the Corpse Pill for his external avatar.</p><p>In this way, since the Corpse Pill was already a formed external pill, the success rate of the secret art would be much higher, and he would save the trouble of preparing various spirit materials. He just had to wait for his external avatar to reach the fake-pill stage.</p><p>Of course, his external avatar wasn't yet ready for pill formation; Qin Sang's idea was just a fantasy, with less than a 30% chance of success.  He wasn't sure if the *Kindling Yuan Demon Fetus* could reshape the Corpse Pill and break through the constraints of the *Heavenly Yin Corpse Art*. Only by trying would he know.</p><p>If he could do it, his understanding of the *Heavenly Yin Corpse Art* would deepen, perhaps leading him to a way to save Ya Gu.</p><p>The Three Lights Jade Liquid nourished her body, while the warm jade and fat silkworm stabilized her soul.  Under these conditions, she could sleep for decades without dying.</p><p>But despite Qin Sang's best efforts, he had no clue how to save Ya Gu.  She could only continue to sleep, her awakening remaining uncertain. Whether her luck was good or bad remained to be seen.</p><p>Qin Sang controlled the Nine Dragon Heavenly Chariot Talisman, he and his double-headed… [Creature's name unclear in original text] flew straight towards their rendezvous point.</p><p>Yue Xian Gu and the other two were all late-stage experts. After completing their rearguard mission, they should be able to escape safely, perhaps someone was already waiting at the meeting point.</p><p>If these people still pursued relentlessly, they shouldn't blame him for being ruthless.</p><p>A fierce look filled Qin Sang's eyes as he flew away without looking back.</p><p>Before long, his true energy indeed neared exhaustion. He deliberately slowed down, then activated the Corpse Pill to maintain the talisman.</p><p>Mei Ran Gong, pursuing closely behind, saw this and his eyes lit up, becoming even more certain that Qin Sang was nearing his end.</p><p>During the chase, they flew an unknown distance.</p><p>As the rendezvous point approached, Qin Sang suddenly sensed something, his expression shifting slightly. Then, he deliberately slowed his speed; the circling Jiao soul around his body flickered incessantly, seeming about to dissipate.</p><p>Mei Ran Gong didn't suspect anything, overjoyed, and sped up his pursuit.</p><p>When he drew near, Qin Sang suddenly turned and attacked with his sword.</p><p>Mei Ran Gong was prepared, countering with his square seal. At the same time, he cautiously looked around, believing Qin Sang, cornered, would summon his spirit beast.</p><p>That woman must be hiding nearby.</p><p>Once Qin Sang was dead, there would be no more obstacles to capturing her.</p><p>Sword energy clashed with the silver seal, creating a storm that raised huge waves on the sea.</p><p>'Splash!'</p><p>A water column suddenly erupted from the seabed.</p><p>Mei Ran Gong snorted coldly, unafraid.  Prepared as he was, he shook his sleeve, and a jade Ruyi shot out, meeting the water column.</p><p>The next moment, his expression changed drastically.</p><p>Hidden beneath the water column wasn't the spirit beast, but an old man.</p><p>This person was Zhu Shan Weng.</p><p>Earlier, with the double-headed… [Creature's name unclear in original text] creating a diversion, Qin Sang learned that not only Zhu Shan Weng, but Yue Xian Gu was also present; only Kong Yun hadn't arrived yet. He had set a trap, waiting for the enemy to walk right into it.</p><p>After Zhu Shan Weng appeared, Yue Xian Gu also burst from the water, encircling Mei Ran Gong from three sides with Qin Sang.</p><p>"You…"</p><p>Mei Ran Gong was shocked. Who would have imagined that so many experts would gather in the remote demon sea?</p><p>His cave was nearby, yet he hadn't sensed a thing.</p><p>Yue Xian Gu's cultivation alone could suppress Mei Ran Gong. With Qin Sang and Zhu Shan Weng assisting, even Mei Ran Gong's strength was no match for them.</p><p>After a fierce battle, despite fighting to the death, Mei Ran Gong failed to escape and perished under Zhu Shan Weng's sword.</p><p>After slaying the red-bearded man, Qin Sang's two-headed beast quickly dispatched the remaining two attackers.  Qin Sang's spiritual energy was low, so she commanded the beast to protect her while she recovered using a spirit stone.</p><p>"Daoist, you truly are remarkably skilled!  Earlier, the spirit beast sent a message, and I feared that Su Nu had been taken by a demonic beast. I almost attacked it, but thankfully Bamboo Mountain friend warned me.  Asking you to protect Su Nu was a wise decision…"</p><p>Yue Xiangu spoke to Qin Sang, praising her.</p><p>Bamboo Mountain Old Man echoed her words.</p><p>Their attitude toward Qin Sang had clearly changed. Before, they were only surprised by her escape and sword techniques. Now, seeing her powerful spirit beast, they realized she was their equal, perhaps even superior.</p><p>After a brief rest, Qin Sang said, "This man had two accomplices. We mustn't let them escape."</p><p>The cultivator surnamed Liu, lagging behind, had fled at the first sign of trouble.  The wealthy merchant was still behind, refining sword energy.</p><p>The three immediately set off.</p><p>From hunter to hunted – the change was instantaneous.</p><p>The other two were also eliminated. The three shared the spoils, making a significant profit.  While they didn't find the specific items Qin Sang needed, they unexpectedly discovered several spirit flowers favored by Tianmu Butterfly, a nice reward for the beast’s help.</p><p>"I never expected to find such malicious cultivators here.  You were put in danger, Daoist. Thankfully, your strength protected Su Nu…"</p><p>Yue Xiangu expressed her gratitude.</p><p>"I was escaping the demonic island with Su Nu when we encountered them. The demonic aura created a spectacle visible for hundreds of miles; I think it attracted them.  I'm deeply grateful for your timely assistance; I was nearly overwhelmed."</p><p>Qin Sang secretly found Su Nu’s relationship with Yue Xiangu peculiar.</p><p>However, wanting only to obtain the treasures without causing trouble, he chose vague answers. As Yue Xiangu didn't press the matter, he didn't elaborate on the conflict's cause, nor Su Nu's strange behavior.</p><p>Su Nu, head bowed, eyes filled with despair, looked stunned.</p><p>She vaguely remembered some things, but Yue Xiangu's cultivation was far beyond hers.  She could only suppress her fear and hatred, treating Yue Xiangu as a close relative.</p><p>The ambush had given her a glimmer of hope. Although she knew escaping in the chaos was unlikely, a slim chance was better than none. She gambled.</p><p>But she hadn't anticipated Qin Sang's powerful beast, leaving her no opportunity.</p><p>She didn’t believe her actions had gone unnoticed by such shrewd individuals.  To her surprise, Qin Sang made no mention of it.</p>
