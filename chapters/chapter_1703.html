<h1>Chapter 1694: Usurping the Magpie's Nest</h1><p>“There's something I'd like to consult with you about, Fairy.”</p><p>Having entered the Savage Lands and traveled for a while, Qin Sang recalled something. He took out the ice disc and handed it to Liuli. “Fairy, can you perceive anything special about this treasure's energy?”</p><p>In terms of mastery over the Ice Dao, Qin Sang couldn't compare to Liuli.</p><p>Aware of the ice disc's origins and function, Liuli examined it closely, then immersed her mind, sensing the chilling煞 energy within.</p><p>Qin Sang watched Liuli quietly.  After she withdrew her mind, he said, “My avatar cultivated the Ice Soul Divine Light by comprehending this chilling煞 energy, and gained a breakthrough opportunity from it.”</p><p>Liuli suddenly understood. No wonder the divine light used by his avatar was so strange.</p><p>“It doesn't seem to be pure ice power, but it's perfectly natural, not like a deliberate fusion. It can even weaken Heavenly Tribulation. I must be ignorant…”</p><p>Liuli mused, then shook her head. “It's not compatible with my foundation, but it can serve as a reference.”</p><p>From then on, Liuli continued her journey while comprehending the ice disc, and Qin Sang accompanied her in silence.</p><p>They traversed countless mountains and rivers.</p><p>Finally, the two arrived at the shore of a vast lake.</p><p>This lake spanned a thousand miles, not the largest in the Savage Lands, but its most unique feature was its indigo-blue water. Cultivators familiar with the Southern Barbarian Lands knew at a glance that it contained deadly poison.</p><p>Lush aquatic plants grew along the shore, all poisonous varieties.</p><p>Aside from a few creatures born of poison, no other life could survive here.  Most of the Savage Lands, except for the northern area bordering the Central Plains, were like this. Not only were there no signs of human habitation, but even living creatures were rare.</p><p>“The entrance is here!”</p><p>Qin Sang flew to the center of the lake, scanned the surface, then flew a hundred miles westward. He nodded at Liuli and plunged into the lake.</p><p>Liuli followed close behind.</p><p>Protected by their True Essence, they swiftly dove towards the bottom. The deeper they went, the richer the blue of the lake became.  Coupled with the dim light, their surroundings were soon enveloped in complete darkness.</p><p>They didn't know how deep they'd descended when their protective True Essence began to sizzle. The lake's toxins were corrosive enough to affect it.</p><p>However, with their profound cultivation, they weren't afraid.</p><p>Near the bottom, they encountered some creatures swimming in the lower depths. They were grotesque, feeding on decay and poison, all venomous beings feared by the outside world.</p><p>These poisonous creatures were deliberately placed there by the Weeping Spirit Cave Master. They couldn't stop top experts, but they could deter cultivators with weaker cultivation, preventing intrusions.</p><p>The Weeping Spirit Cave Master's caution didn't end there.</p><p>Countless holes, large and small, dotted the lakebed, connecting to underground rivers. The intricate water network extended in all directions.</p><p>Qin Sang searched for a while, found an ordinary-looking hole, and sank into the underground river.  He continued downwards, diving deep into the earth, before finally sensing a peculiar fluctuation.</p><p>“We’re here…”</p><p>Qin Sang sent a mental message and abruptly increased his speed.</p><p>Liuli followed, cracking the protective formation under Qin Sang's guidance. They then passed through an invisible barrier, feeling a sudden freshness as the lake water was blocked behind them.</p><p>Before them lay a cavern filled with swirling blood-red and grey mist. As soon as they entered, they felt a bone-chilling coldness seeping into their marrow. The sound of the mist flowing resembled the whispers of countless resentful spirits.</p><p>Seeing the scene within the mist, Qin Sang and Liuli fell silent.</p><p>It was less a medicinal garden and more a sacrificial ground.</p><p>High mounds of white bones stood within the garden, resembling the "jingguan" used by mortal generals to flaunt their military prowess.  Surrounding the bone mounds were crisscrossing canals filled with bright red blood.</p><p>The blood rivers interconnected, forming a blood formation.</p><p>These blood waters had no trace of a bloody stench. Instead, they smelled a pungent fragrance.</p><p>The fragrance emanated from the tops of the bone mounds.</p><p>Some mounds were empty at the top, while most radiated a crimson glow.</p><p>Within the red glow were spiritual herbs of various shapes. Some resembled lingzhi mushrooms, others blood flowers or ghost vines.  Even more bizarre were those bearing fruit resembling blood-red infants, complete with realistic features.</p><p>It was hard to find counterparts to these spiritual herbs in the real world. They were cultivated by the Weeping Spirit Cave Master using secret techniques, nourished by refined souls, and had long since deviated from their original forms, becoming 'blood medicines'.</p><p>Liuli glanced at Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang understood her meaning:  Would there be any problems consuming such medicine?</p><p>If the information obtained through soul searching was accurate, these blood medicines were cultivated by the Weeping Spirit Cave Master with immense effort. The cultivation process was analogous to alchemy, a unique path.</p><p>Unless one wanted to cultivate the Corpse Ghost Dao, consuming them would have some effect on the body, but these could be resolved with diligent refinement.</p><p>Despite their strange appearance, their medicinal efficacy was genuine.  Compared to the benefits, this small price was entirely acceptable.</p><p>The blood medicines remaining on the bone mounds were not yet fully mature, their potency greatly reduced.  However, Qin Sang urgently needed spiritual herbs to heal his injuries and wasn't planning to nourish them with refined souls. He decided to harvest them directly.</p><p>The information obtained through soul searching was incomplete, and Qin Sang didn't recognize some of the blood medicines. Liuli went out to capture demonic beasts and poisonous creatures to test their properties, categorizing them accordingly.</p><p>After clearing away the bones and blood from the garden, it began to resemble a cave dwelling.</p><p>Within the silent dwelling,</p><p>Qin Sang consumed the medicines to heal.</p><p>Liuli sat beside him, comprehending the ice disc.</p><p>As his condition slightly improved, Qin Sang turned his attention to the toxins within his body, the main culprit behind his worsening injuries. He had to eliminate them first.</p><p>Drawing on the power of the poison pearl, supplemented by medicinal pills, he expelled the toxins bit by bit. Qin Sang's face gradually regained some color.</p><p>Time slowly passed.</p><p>Qin Sang's condition improved day by day, but his foundation was damaged, and it wouldn't heal quickly.</p><p>His true body recuperated in the Savage Lands, protected by Liuli.</p><p>His avatar traveled north with peace of mind, entering the Northern Wilderness.</p><p>The blizzard had just ended, and the weather cleared.</p><p>White snow blanketed everything.</p><p>Snow covered the earth and mountains completely. The wind whipped up fine snow, sending it swirling through the air, creating a vast expanse of white.</p><p>The avatar, disguised, flew swiftly over the snow.  After traveling for a long time, he stopped above a snowdrift, gazed down for a moment, formed a hand seal, and sent it into the snow below.</p><p>“Who’s there!”</p><p>The snow suddenly cracked open, revealing a mountain shadow below. A figure flew up.</p><p>“Senior, it's me.”</p><p>The avatar whispered. It seemed that the Ghost Mother and Ya Gu were safe, and he could finally relax.</p><p>The newcomer was the Ghost Mother. She said with a faint smile, "So it’s the Fire Devil, who recently caused such chaos in the Central Plains.  Slaying a Nascent Soul Godson and extinguishing a Saint King's illusionary body, what a fearsome reputation! Tsk tsk, I underestimated you."</p><p>“Senior, please don’t tease me. I’m being pursued by a powerful enemy, like a stray dog.”</p><p>The avatar smiled wryly.</p><p>Now, rumors about the Formless Immortal Sect were spreading throughout the Central Plains. The Ancient Devil's capture, Zi Lei's fall – these major events were overshadowed by the colorful tales about Qin Sang.</p><p>He was portrayed as a monstrously fierce individual, the likes of which hadn't been seen in millennia.</p><p>The rumors became increasingly exaggerated.  Just listening to the descriptions, Qin Sang felt he didn't need to flee at all.  He could just annihilate two Nascent Soul cultivators and then single-handedly suppress the Ancient Devil with ease.</p><p>Several more people emerged from the cave dwelling.</p><p>Others, alarmed by the commotion above, had come out to investigate.</p><p>The avatar glanced down, counting three people.</p><p>One was his nominal disciple, Shen Chen. Another was a boy leading a little girl. The girl, around six or seven years old, with delicate features, looked at the avatar with a mixture of curiosity and fear.  The boy seemed older, perhaps twelve or thirteen, and behaved calmly.</p><p>“You even dared to provoke Nascent Soul cultivators.  The Xie family and the Tower Terrace View are implicated because of you, their fate uncertain.  Too many people would attract attention, so I could only bring these few out.  The two families also selected a few promising disciples and sent them away secretly.  The rest were difficult to move, so I had their families rent a flying boat from the Dragon Residence Cave Heaven and openly seek refuge at the Sweet Dew Zen Monastery.  As for these three, you'll have to figure out what to do with them yourself.”</p><p>The experienced Ghost Mother, having received the warning, handled Qin Sang's affairs.  This arrangement ensured the continuation of the Xie family and the Tower Terrace View's lineages, even in the worst-case scenario.</p><p>The boy's name was Xie Yi.  Qin Sang remembered him; he was said to be a rare genius, the Xie family's great hope.</p><p>The avatar landed on the ground. Shen Chen stepped forward and bowed. Xie Yi, pulling the little girl, also kowtowed.  Both knew the avatar's true identity.</p><p>He studied the little girl's features, finding them familiar.</p><p>“Are you Zhou Jin and Ruan Yu’s daughter?”</p><p>The Zhou and Ruan couple had mentioned their concerns about not being able to break through to Nascent Soul and their plans to have a child first. They had used secret techniques to prepare for many years and deliberately mentioned it in front of Qin Sang, hoping for a chance to have their child become his disciple.</p><p>But Qin Sang hadn't responded, so they dared not mention it again.</p><p>“My name is Zhou Li.  My parents told me to follow Old Ancestor and be obedient,” the little girl said crisply, kowtowing to Qin Sang formally.</p><p>The avatar pointed to Zhou Li and Xie Yi, then said to Shen Chen, “From now on, they are your disciples.”</p><p>The Demon Sealing Stakes were already gone, but the Meteorite Iron Whip remained, and Qin Sang couldn't just abandon his disciple.</p><p>Fortunately, this disciple still had some use.</p><p>“This… Disciple obeys!”</p><p>Shen Chen was dumbfounded, looking at his two new disciples with a headache. He now had to take care of children.</p><p>But his master had commanded it, and he dared not disobey.</p><p>Especially after hearing about Qin Sang's deeds in the Southern Lands from the Ghost Mother, Shen Chen held a mixture of reverence and awe for his master.</p><p>Waving his hand to dismiss his disciples,</p><p>The avatar and the Ghost Mother entered the quiet chamber.  They saw Ya Gu sleeping on an ice bed, her breathing steady, her aura seemingly deeper than before.</p><p>“I heard your harvest this time was quite bountiful?”</p><p>The Ghost Mother raised an eyebrow, asking without reservation.</p><p>The avatar expressed his gratitude. “Many thanks to Senior for informing me in time, so I didn't miss this opportunity!  Through the Witch Clan mark left by Senior, I found the remains of that Nascent Soul Witch Clan cultivator in the legacy site.  It seems he, like the Formless Immortal Sect expert, was afflicted by demonic corruption during the Demonic Tribulation, sealed himself within Emperor Bestowal Mountain, and met with misfortune…”</p><p>Reaching Nascent Soul in this world was incredibly difficult. The Witch Clan Nascent Soul cultivator was about to break free from his limitations, only to encounter disaster and die in a foreign land.</p><p>The Ghost Mother said indifferently, “Such is fate.”</p><p>“That senior’s belongings included a sea chart of the Boundless Azure Sea. Is Senior interested in visiting the descendants of the Witch Clan?”</p><p>Qin Sang later found the sea chart among the miscellaneous items.</p><p>The Boundless Azure Sea was located southeast of the Central Plains, even farther than the Northern Sea.</p><p>Since Qin Sang didn't know the exact location of the Return to Ruin, he didn't know where the Boundless Azure Sea corresponded to it or its direction.</p><p>“With Ya Gu, what's the point? My own path is uncertain. How can I have the energy to ferry others across?  Those of the same clan aren’t necessarily allies. Do you look at the human race of the Central Plains differently?”</p><p>The Ghost Mother's expression was cold. After a pause, she continued, “Ya Gu's condition is better than expected. She's made significant progress recently!  I'm already preparing to traverse the void and will choose a date to ascend once everything is ready.”</p><p>“So soon?” The avatar frowned.</p><p>The Ghost Mother shook her head, murmuring, “I’ve waited too long.”</p><p>The void traversal used Witch Clan secret techniques. The avatar couldn't interject. Looking outside the cave, he said, “If there’s anything I can do, Senior, just ask.  Ya Gu's well-being is paramount.  But before that, let's find a safe place to settle down.”</p><p>Saying this, the avatar flicked his sleeve, and two balls of ethereal light flew out.</p><p>One contained a tattered banner, and the other held Su Zinan's nascent spirit, both brought by the avatar.</p><p>The nascent spirit's eyes were tightly closed, his consciousness unclear.</p><p>Su Zinan was first poisoned, then burned by fire. After being captured by Qin Sang, he almost succumbed to the poison. Fortunately, the avatar discovered it in time, suppressing the poison and keeping him barely alive.</p><p>Qin Sang only wanted to keep the nascent spirit for soul searching.</p><p>However, after obtaining Su Zinan's cultivation method from his belongings and checking the condition of the Three Corpses Death God Banner, he changed his mind.</p><p>The Three Corpses Death God Banner, when imbued with three Nascent Soul late-stage demonic souls and completely subdued, could actually use the three souls as a foundation to aid in breaking through to Nascent Soul.  The problem was that the three souls required a specific cultivation method to achieve this effect.</p><p>These were the products of Old Devil Lu's experiments, combining blood path techniques, the Three Corpses Death God Banner, and Old Devil Lu's own cultivation method.</p><p>The two demonic souls collected by Su Zinan were destroyed by the Golden Crow, and the banner was damaged. The third soul survived, but it was still in the form of a faceless head, not yet fused with a nascent spirit.</p><p>Qin Sang planned to reserve this spot for Su Zinan.</p><p>He had no intention of changing his cultivation method.  In his hands, the Three Corpses Death God Banner would only be a powerful offensive weapon, and repairing it was extremely difficult.</p><p>Su Zinan, relying on his Nascent Soul legacy and still having Old Wu and the Nether Moon Guards, would also find gathering the necessary materials incredibly challenging.</p><p>However, if he could simply repair it and integrate Su Zinan into the demonic soul, he would not only gain a powerful fighting force but also easily obtain the secrets Su Zinan knew.</p><p>On his journey north, the avatar studied the demonic banner and gradually gained some understanding, but encountered another problem.</p><p>Su Zinan's cultivation was higher than the avatar's by one level. The chance of failure was extremely high, and he needed the Ghost Mother's assistance.</p><p>Learning the details, the Ghost Mother took the demonic banner and nascent spirit, her opening words laced with sarcasm, “A dignified Nascent Soul Godson reduced to this state. Even Old Devil Lu would lose face if he knew, probably too ashamed to seek revenge from you.”</p><p>“Eh?”</p><p>The Ghost Mother held the Three Corpses Death God Banner, examining it closely with apparent interest. "This tattered banner is somewhat intriguing."</p><p>The avatar, recalling that the Heavenly Corpse Talisman came from the Ghost Mother, gave her a strange look.</p><p>One imprisoned living infants, the other controlled corpses. Did the Ghost Mother have some peculiar hobby?</p><p>More than ten days later,</p><p>The group left the snowy peak, turning eastward, their destination: Deer Wilds!</p><p>The demonic banner imprisoned the nascent spirit, and from Su Zinan, they learned the origin of the Deer Wilds.</p><p>The Deer Wilds was an ancient cave dwelling discovered by Old Devil Lu during his travels in the Northern Sea.</p><p>Because the Deer Wilds constantly drifted between the Northern Wilderness and the Northern Sea without a discernible pattern, and its protective formation was extremely concealed, it remained hidden until Old Devil Lu occupied it, turning it into his lair.</p><p>Without the owner's guidance, no one knew the location of the Deer Wilds. There was no better hiding place.</p><p>Su Zinan had left the Deer Wilds on the coast of the Eastern Sea, and now it was unclaimed.</p>
