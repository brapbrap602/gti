<h1>Chapter 1262: Breaking the Seal</h1><p>Seeing that Tian Zheng Lao Ren remained silent, Tong You Mo Jun repeatedly said, "Since it's an ancient cultivator, not a treasure, capturing them benefits everyone.  Your Zui Yuan clan alone probably can't handle it, so why fight to the death?  If something unexpected happens, you'll regret it!"</p><p>Tian Zheng Lao Ren glanced at Ye Lao Mo.</p><p>The blood pool seal's fluctuations grew increasingly violent, about to be broken.</p><p>Tian Zheng Lao Ren was actually somewhat worried. Although he had used a devilish secret technique to investigate, the sealed ancient cultivator was most likely at the end of their rope and wouldn't be able to cause much trouble.</p><p>But the methods of ancient cultivators are unpredictable. If something unexpected happens, and they are held back by their enemies, relying only on Ye Lao Mo alone, he might not be able to subdue the ancient cultivator.</p><p>If the ancient cultivator escapes, it could indeed, as Tong You Mo Jun said, bring about a great calamity.</p><p>Times have changed. Their plan has been discovered by Xiao Han Yu, and the situation is unfavorable.</p><p>As Tong You said, Zi Wei Palace holds countless treasures, more than the Zui Yuan clan can swallow. Agreeing on a distribution of the spoils, jointly imprisoning the ancient cultivator, and exploring Zi Wei Palace together isn't a bad option.</p><p>However, Ye Lao Mo ignored Tong You Mo Jun's words, his fingers spinning like wheels, fast as lightning, showing no intention of negotiating with Xiao Han Yu, seemingly confident.</p><p>Seeing this, Tian Zheng Lao Ren could only put aside his thoughts and concentrate on activating his treasure.</p><p>While Tong You Mo Jun was speaking, Qin Sang and the other two also passed through the ancient barrier and fell into the Star River Chart.</p><p>Seeing this, understanding their predicament, they immediately activated their treasures and launched a full-scale attack.</p><p>Tian Zheng Lao Ren, facing four opponents alone, was struggling, even with his exquisite treasure.</p><p>The space sealed by the treasure was unstable.</p><p>Qin Sang and the others were trapped within the Star River, exerting all their strength to break free from the treasure's seal.</p><p>A demonic beast phantom soared among the stars.</p><p>A demonic fire, with the power to incinerate the world, consumed countless stars.</p><p>A black tower, with a slight tremor, caused a section of the starry sky to collapse.</p><p>In addition to the continuous bombardment of Yin Thunder from Tong You Mo Jun.</p><p>These four, except for the Thunder Swallowing Falcon, which had been trapped for many years and was slightly weaker, were each formidable opponents.  Tian Zheng Lao Ren gritted his teeth, sweat pouring down his face, soon unable to hold on any longer.</p><p>Knowing he couldn't hold them back for much longer, he urgently sent a voice transmission to Jiang Chen Zi to quickly return for support, setting up the Flag Gate Array above the blood pool to buy Ye Lao time.</p><p>Within the Flag Gate Array.</p><p>Two great arrays were clashing.</p><p>Jiang Chen Zi and the others looked relaxed.  Initially, the situation was somewhat tense, but the treasure flags linked to the Black Tower Array, drawing on its power, proved impregnable, easily blocking their opponents.</p><p>Suddenly, Jiang Chen Zi's expression changed drastically, shouting, "It's a trap!  Quickly retreat!"</p><p>Everyone's faces changed, and they were about to activate the flag array to join forces with Tian Zheng Lao Ren.</p><p>Within the Zheng Fan Jiu Gong Array, Xiang Qing had been observing the changes in the Flag Gate Array. Seeing the blood light rapidly receding and the surrounding pressure easing, he immediately understood that Tong You Mo Jun had succeeded.  He immediately ordered a change in the formation.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>Heaven and earth turned upside down, the ground rose, the Nine Palaces reversed, and the Reverse Nine Palaces Array was instantly formed.</p><p>The Nine Palaces hung high above, overshadowing the Flag Gate Array.</p><p>At the same time, Jiang Chen Zi and the others felt the three flag gates become incredibly heavy, an immense pressure descending from the heavens, weighing down on them, as if they were sinking into a quagmire.</p><p>The Reverse Nine Palaces Array primarily served to trap and kill!</p><p>For a time, the roles were reversed, with Jiang Chen Zi and the others trapped and unable to escape.</p><p>The Zheng Fan Jiu Gong Array was less powerful than the Flag Gate Array, but it could still hold Jiang Chen Zi and the others for a while—enough at this crucial moment.</p><p>Unable to return for reinforcements, Tian Zheng Lao Ren sensed danger. He suddenly heard a muffled thunderclap, and saw a ball of Yin Thunder forcefully breaking out of the Star River, heading straight for him.</p><p>Following the Yin Thunder, the demonic fire and the shadow of the tower followed closely behind.</p><p>Tian Zheng Lao Ren was startled, not daring to receive it head-on, quickly dodging.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The Star River suddenly shattered into four parts, and four figures flew out.  The Star River transformed back into a chart, flying into Tian Zheng Lao Ren's hand.</p><p>Qin Sang, surrounded by demonic banners, broke through the Star River Chart.  His gaze swept across the scene, and he saw Ye Lao Mo and his blood demon avatar seated above the river of blood.</p><p>"It's an avatar!"</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes narrowed slightly.</p><p>The aura of this avatar was not weaker than his main body; Ye Lao Mo had hidden it well!</p><p>Qin Sang sensed a strong aura of blood煞 from the blood demon avatar, similar to the Ye Lao Mo he had fought in Yuanxu, with only subtle differences.</p><p>Years had passed since their last encounter, so this was normal.</p><p>Back then, the blood demon avatar had chased him and the Snake King into a desperate flight.</p><p>Now that Ye Lao Mo's main body and avatar were both present, although his own strength had also improved significantly, seizing someone from Ye Lao Mo's clutches might not be easy!</p><p>Luckily, they had one more person on their side.</p><p>Four against three; all they needed was to create an opening for Jing Yu!</p><p>Qin Sang's mind raced, but her movements were unwavering.  She bypassed Tian Zheng, launching herself directly at Ye Lao Mo!</p><p>Tong You and the others followed suit.</p><p>Seeing this, Tian Zheng hastily summoned the Star River Chart again.  The star sea had just been breached, and he was too weak to stop all four. He could only fling the Chart at Tong You.</p><p>Tong You, the strongest among them, would take on the most powerful opponent. The others would have to rely on Ye Lao.</p><p>Simultaneously, he produced a talisman. His gaze shifted to Qin Sang.  Having heard of the Moonlit Demon King's havoc in Yuan Xu, he immediately hurled the talisman, summoning a starlight warrior whose power was comparable to a Yuan Ying cultivator.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>The Star River Chart unfurled once more, transforming into a celestial river that encircled Tong You.</p><p>Tong You sighed. He'd anticipated this; he'd be targeted.  He had to break the Star River Chart first. Unfortunately, Dong Yang Bo had unexpectedly disappeared; otherwise, victory would have been assured.</p><p>A dark, walnut-sized seal pulsed with dark energy from his dantian.</p><p>The moment the seal appeared, ghostly wails filled the air, turning the starry sky into a ghostly realm.</p><p>As they remained locked in a stalemate…</p><p>While Qin Sang was engaged with the warrior, Qing Jun and another had already bypassed Tian Zheng.</p><p>At that moment, Ye Lao Mo, who had been standing with his eyes closed, focused on breaking the blood pool seal, abruptly opened his eyes.  A flash of crimson light filled his pupils.</p><p>Then, he and his blood demon avatar roared, burning their essence, their bodies erupting in fiery blood flames, which coalesced into pillars of blood flame in their palms, smashing into the blood pool seal.</p><p>"Stop him!"</p><p>Qin Sang and Qing Jun heard Tong You's urgent call, but it was too late.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>Ye Lao Mo and the others had been working on it for so long; the blood pool seal was already on the verge of collapse.  The blood flame pillar shattered it completely.</p><p>After breaking the seal, Ye Lao Mo glanced at everyone, his expression unchanged, before leaping into the blood pool.</p><p>Jing Yu sought only the Corpse Flower Blood Jasper in the pool; she cared nothing for the ancient cultivators.</p><p>Without the Corpse Flower Blood Jasper, she would perish under the Heavenly Tribulation; even the attainment of the Mystical Transformation technique would be meaningless.  Thus, seeing the seal break, she didn't even look at Ye Lao Mo, instead diving into the blood pool without hesitation.</p><p>Qing Jun was not far behind.</p><p>Meanwhile, the blood demon avatar didn't follow its master into the pool.  Instead, it unleashed the Blood Moon Wheel at Qing Jun, and lunged towards Jing Yu!</p>
