<h1></h1><p>The Heavenly Eye Butterfly glimpsed a scene, but that brief look gave Qin Sang a very dangerous feeling.</p><p>He couldn't explain it clearly to Valley Master Mu and the others, so he could only offer vague reminders. If they didn't listen, Qin Sang wouldn't force them. At least, he himself would definitely wait for the pillar of light to weaken before entering.</p><p>Fortunately, Valley Master Mu and the others were all shrewd and experienced. Their intuition also told them that the inside was not simple, so Qin Sang didn't need to waste his breath.</p><p>"I just don't know how long we have to wait..."</p><p>The cultivator surnamed Qi revealed a worried look as he surveyed his surroundings. The Emptiness Spirit Sea was no longer as calm as it used to be. The aftershocks emitted by the pillar of light formed the most violent storm, affecting the entire Emptiness Spirit Sea.</p><p>As far as the eye could see, towering waves were everywhere. In front of them, the sea water collapsed, revealing a huge sea pit, exposing the source of the pillar of light and the broken Buddha Lotus.</p><p>Apart from the four of them, they couldn't see any other figures or ships for the time being. But they all knew that this was only temporary. Such a huge commotion couldn't be concealed at all. Low-level cultivators were not worth worrying about, but if there were Nascent Soul cultivators nearby, they would definitely be attracted.</p><p>"Let's observe the situation. Everyone should recover first to prepare for the upcoming changes. If it drags on for too long, I'm afraid there will be a treasure-snatching war..."</p><p>Valley Master Mu chuckled bitterly, recalling the time and effort he had put into breaking the formation.</p><p>Not counting anything else, the Connecting Jade Bee, which he had always valued highly, self-destructed for this. Arranging the Three Spirits King Array twice and refining two altars were also huge expenses.</p><p>He had also made a deal with Qin Sang. He only hoped that the subsequent gains could make up for the losses.</p><p>Now that the Buddha Lotus was broken, the Three Spirits King Array should no longer be needed below. Upon entering the Pure Sea Sect, with the Fire Jade Centipede's own realm, it would be able to sense the Myriad Spirit Fruit.</p><p>Valley Master Mu stopped the insect array.</p><p>Qin Sang beckoned, and the Fire Jade Centipede flew back to his palm. Its original fire jade-like body had become very dull, losing its luster. The Fire Jade Centipede lay on Qin Sang's hand, unwilling to move even its legs on either side. Its entire body was stiff, and its aura was weak.</p><p>If Qin Sang couldn't still sense the Fire Jade Centipede's consciousness, he would have thought it had turned into a sculpture.</p><p>*Pa!*</p><p>Qin Sang took out a jade bottle. Inside was the spirit dew given by Valley Master Mu, which could alleviate spirit insect injuries. After entering the Pure Sea Sect, the Fire Jade Centipede would still be needed to lead the way. Recovering even a little was beneficial.</p><p>The spirit dew dripped in front of the Fire Jade Centipede, and it immediately licked it clean, perking up slightly. Its body wiggled slightly, then it fell into a deep sleep.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at it and retracted his hand into his Daoist robe.</p><p>"Daoist Mu?"</p><p>Qin Sang reminded Valley Master Mu that the previous deal should be fulfilled. The Fire Jade Centipede had rendered meritorious service, and the entrance had been found. Although they couldn't enter now, Qin Sang wasn't to blame.</p><p>Valley Master Mu sighed softly and reluctantly threw a jade slip to Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang thanked him and quickly delved into it with his divine sense. Valley Master Mu certainly wouldn't give him the entire inheritance. Inside was only the Natal Insect Gu technique inherited by Hundred Flowers Valley.</p><p>Qin Sang had expected this, but after seeing it, he couldn't help but sigh, "Truly, they originated from the same source."</p><p>He was not wrong. The Hundred Flowers Valley's Natal Insect Gu technique was indeed an improved version of the Witch Clan's inheritance, obtaining a secret technique suitable for human cultivation. Moreover, the method of improvement was extremely ingenious, opening Qin Sang's eyes.</p><p>Even if Qin Sang cultivated the original version of the Natal Insect Gu technique, he wouldn't be able to do this. This made Qin Sang wonder if there were truly geniuses in the world who could obtain a secret technique never seen before and come up with such a method out of thin air.</p><p>However, this modification was not without flaws. First, disciples who cultivated the Natal Insect Gu must possess water-attribute spiritual roots, and they must adopt a spirit insect that matches the power of water as their Natal Insect Gu in order to minimize the risk of devouring its master.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at Valley Master Mu. No wonder the Natal Spirit Insects of the Hundred Flowers Valley's disciples were all of this type, including Valley Master Mu himself.</p><p>Second, even after the modification, the spirit insect was not as close to its master as the Witch Clan cultivator's Natal Insect Gu.</p><p>The jade slip was limited to content below the Nascent Soul realm. However, Qin Sang didn't press for more. This was enough for him to see a lot.</p><p>Modifying secret techniques became more difficult as one's realm increased. Qin Sang guessed that the Hundred Flowers Valley's inheritance was limited, possibly only up to the late or even mid-Nascent Soul stage. He wondered if Valley Master Mu was venturing into the Pure Sea Sect at all costs to find the path ahead?</p><p>"Eh?"</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly realized a problem. The Hundred Flowers Valley's inheritance was inferior to the original. Their relationship with their Natal Insect Gu was not as close as the Heavenly Eye Butterfly was to him. He should have a higher chance of successfully upgrading the spirit of the Heavenly Eye Butterfly than the Hundred Flowers Valley cultivators!</p><p>This unexpected discovery made Qin Sang quite happy. If he could find the Myriad Spirit Fruit later, his confidence in upgrading the spirit would be even greater! It was a pity that the Fire Jade Centipede was not his Natal Insect Gu. Whether it could break through to the fourth transformation in the future would depend on its luck.</p><p>As for Fat Silkworm. Qin Sang had been hesitating whether to use the Spirit Ascension Sacrifice on it. Fat Silkworm was not his spirit insect, and the chance of success was definitely pitifully small. It would be a waste of opportunity, and it wasn't worth it.</p><p>Moreover, Fat Silkworm's skills were simple. It could already easily resist the Fierce Poison released by the Form Transformation stage Frog Fish, which was enough to deal with most situations. There was no need to force it to advance for the time being.</p><p>These thoughts flashed through his mind. In front of Valley Master Mu, Qin Sang destroyed the jade slip and transmitted a bitter smile, "No wonder you were so generous. It turns out you're cultivating the Natal Insect Gu, occupying the position of your Natal Magic Treasure. Even if I obtained this secret technique, it would be impossible for me to cultivate it anymore."</p><p>Valley Master Mu laughed loudly, "My sect's inheritance is special and requires extremely high aptitude. Even if Daoist Priest has enough talent, you've already missed the opportunity to cultivate it. However, this was created by my sect's ancestors with painstaking effort and should be able to inspire Daoist Priest."</p><p>"Daoist friend is right." Qin Sang nodded perfunctorily.</p><p>While the two were communicating through sound transmission, not only did the phenomenon show no signs of weakening, but its momentum was also getting stronger. It had expanded by a full fold compared to before. Qin Sang and the others were forced to retreat again.</p><p>Time slowly passed. Soon, a night had passed. Qin Sang and the others watched every change in the phenomenon tirelessly.</p><p>In the distance, a boat floated on the sea surface with several figures standing on it. Two of them were Core Formation stage cultivators. They were passing through the Emptiness Spirit Sea when they saw the phenomenon. They thought that a great treasure had been born. Overjoyed, they rushed to find the treasure, but unexpectedly bumped into four Nascent Soul Grandmasters. They all trembled in fear.</p><p>Fortunately, the other party was not a vicious person and did not kill to silence them.</p><p>Before long, another immortal cultivator's treasure ship floated over and was also detained. A simple restriction was used to restrain them on the sea surface, and no one dared to object.</p><p>The Emptiness Spirit Sea was safe and had always been an important route. More and more people and ships were attracted here and were all left behind. As for the people in other places, Qin Sang and the others couldn't control them.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, another day and night had passed. The phenomenon intensified. No Nascent Soul cultivator had appeared yet.</p><p>Just as they were anxious, the pillar of light finally stopped expanding and turned from prosperity to decline!</p>
