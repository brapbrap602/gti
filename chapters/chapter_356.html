<h1>Chapter 349: The Cloud-Thunder Crown</h1><p>After luring Liang Yan out, Qin Sang, following her plan, used the *Dunling Jue* to disguise her cultivation as early Foundation Establishment stage.  She pretended to be unaware of being followed, tempting Liang Yan to make his move.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Liang Yan was incredibly patient, holding back until now.</p><p>This gave Qin Sang ample time to prepare.</p><p>Feigning a spiritual injury, she lured Liang Yan into a trap.  First, the Yin-Yang Compass disrupted Liang Yan's Soul Binding Rope.  Immediately afterward, the Ten Directions Yama Formation was deployed, successfully trapping Liang Yan within.</p><p>Liang Yan instantly recognized the Kuiyin Sect's signature artifact. His expression drastically changed, and he cried out, "The Ten Directions Yama Formation!"</p><p>At this point, Liang Yan knew he'd been tricked!</p><p>Who was behind this?</p><p>Why target him?</p><p>Why did the Heart-Eating Insect Gu fail?</p><p>Liang Yan's thoughts raced, but he understood that these questions were irrelevant.  He knew the terrifying nature of the Ten Directions Yama Formation. His only thought was to escape as quickly as possible. Only by breaking free from the demonic formation would he have a chance to counterattack; otherwise, death was certain!</p><p>"Cloud-Thunder Crown!"</p><p>Liang Yan let out a low roar. A blinding silver light erupted from his head.</p><p>Under his hood, Liang Yan had been wearing a simple hairband. In that instant, the hairband transformed, revealing itself to be an artifact!</p><p>The hairband morphed into an exquisitely crafted crown.  The streamers hanging from the crown resembled miniature rainbows, surrounded by swirling auspicious clouds.</p><p>The light shimmered, incredibly beautiful!</p><p>*Crack!*</p><p>A sudden clap of thunder.</p><p>The mountains trembled.</p><p>The auspicious clouds turned ominous, becoming swirling thunderclouds, radiating pure and yang cloud-thunder energy.</p><p>*Crackle!*</p><p>Lightning surged. Liang Yan was enveloped in dazzling light, protected by the Cloud-Thunder Crown, as if bathed in lightning.</p><p>The soul threads were blocked by the cloud-thunder energy, unable to strike his spirit.</p><p>By now, Qin Sang had quietly surfaced from the mire.  Witnessing this, a look of surprise flashed across her eyes. Liang Yan's Cloud-Thunder Crown was no ordinary artifact; the cloud-thunder energy it contained was a demon's nemesis.</p><p>The soul threads, upon contact with the cloud-thunder energy, were shattered by the lightning strikes, greatly diminishing their power and rendering them unable to breach his defenses in a short time.</p><p>This effectively neutralized the Ten Directions Yama Formation's strongest attack.</p><p>Such a targeted artifact was likely painstakingly prepared by Liang Yan specifically for the Ten Directions Yama Formation.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes gleamed. Without hesitation, she reached to her waist, and the corpse puppet, created from a Da Yue accomplice, flew out of the corpse puppet bag.</p><p>This person had been a mid-Foundation Establishment cultivator in life. As a corpse puppet, he could still play a role in this battle.</p><p>The corpse puppet charged into the Ten Directions Yama Formation, moving like lightning, instantly closing in behind Liang Yan.  His fist, imbued with extremely chilling earth-煞 energy, aimed for Liang Yan's heart.</p><p>Sensing the approaching attack, Liang Yan quickly sidestepped, flicking a black stone towards the corpse puppet.</p><p>Initially tiny, no bigger than a fingernail, the stone grew rapidly in the air, instantly becoming a massive boulder, smashing down on the corpse puppet with the force of a collapsing mountain.</p><p>The boulder carried a fierce wind, with black smoke billowing, truly resembling a vicious black dragon – hence its name, Black Dragon Stone.</p><p>Even from outside the formation, Qin Sang could feel the oppressive force of the Black Dragon Stone. Its immense weight was no exaggeration.</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang wouldn't allow the corpse puppet to endure the blow directly.</p><p>The corpse puppet hastily retreated, crossing its arms to block the attack.</p><p>A dull thud echoed as the corpse puppet was heavily struck and sent flying back, nearly ejected from the Ten Directions Yama Formation before managing to regain its footing.  Deep gouges appeared on its arms, narrowly avoiding having them broken by the Black Dragon Stone.</p><p>Liang Yan relentlessly pursued, continuing to propel the Black Dragon Stone.  Simultaneously, he moved quickly, attempting to use the Black Dragon Stone to break through the formation.</p><p>With the Black Dragon Stone at its peak momentum, the corpse puppet alone could not restrain Liang Yan.  Seeing this, Qin Sang immediately changed tactics, leaving some soul threads to continue tangling with Liang Yan while simultaneously mobilizing a portion of the formation's power to create a ferocious-looking ghost.</p><p>The ghost materialized, desperately charging towards Liang Yan.</p><p>Meanwhile, the earth-煞 energy surged within the corpse puppet, instantly healing its injuries, and it lunged forward once more.</p><p>Liang Yan found himself under attack from both malevolent spirits and corpse-demons.  These creatures only made fleeting contact, avoiding direct confrontation with the Black Dragon Stone.  Though exceptionally agile, Liang Yan, armed only with the Black Dragon Stone, found himself hard-pressed. Simultaneously, his Cloud Thunder Crown was under relentless assault from the spirit threads, rapidly depleting its power.</p><p>He grew increasingly anxious. The Crown's power wasn't inexhaustible.  If he couldn't escape soon, once the Cloud Thunder energy was gone and the Crown broken, he would be defenseless.</p><p>Liang Yan shouted, focusing all his spiritual energy to recall the Soul-Binding Rope.</p><p>“Whoosh… whoosh…!”</p><p>The Rope shot out like lightning, quickly ensnaring a corpse-demon that desperately tried to evade it but was eventually bound fast.  Simultaneously, the Black Dragon Stone slammed down on a malevolent spirit.</p><p>Just as the Black Dragon Stone was about to pulverize the spirit, Liang Yan's face paled.  Behind him, a sword flashed into existence, revealing an ambush that had been waiting for this precise moment.</p><p>By the time Liang Yan saw the ebony sword, it was too late.  In terror, he tried to protect his vital points, but the sword's target wasn't him – it was the thundercloud above.</p><p>“Swoosh! Bang!”</p><p>The thundercloud shattered, the Cloud Thunder Crown itself cracked and crumbled under the impact.</p><p>“No!”</p><p>Liang Yan cried out in horror. Qin Sang, ignoring him, unleashed the full power of the Ten Directions Yama Array. A deluge of spirit threads instantly extinguished the remaining Cloud Thunder energy around Liang Yan and began to assault his primordial spirit.</p><p>“Aaaaaah…”</p><p>This time, it was Liang Yan's scream. He clutched his head, behaving wildly, desperately trying to defend himself with the Black Dragon Stone. Qin Sang, flitting effortlessly through the Stone's chaotic attacks, closed in, unleashing the Sky Poison Gauze, which enveloped Liang Yan in a toxic cloud.</p><p>With the spirit threads and the Sky Poison Gauze, Liang Yan had no chance of resistance.  The Black Dragon Stone and the Soul-Binding Rope simultaneously lost their effectiveness, their light dimming before they fell to the ground, about to be swallowed by the mire, when a surge of spiritual energy snatched them up.</p><p>Qin Sang retrieved the artifacts, glancing at the captured Liang Yan.  From the moment he'd fallen for the Heart-Eating Insect trap and left Feng Cang Market without Shi Hong, his fate had been sealed. This allowed Qin Sang to attack with full force.</p><p>The only unexpected element had been the Cloud Thunder Crown, which resisted the spirit threads, adding some complications to Qin Sang's plan, though ultimately insignificant to the outcome.</p>
