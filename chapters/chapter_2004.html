<h1>Chapter 1995: The Heavenly Sea Divine Eye</h1><p>The Sky Ocean Hollow is a realm dominated by flora, a kingdom of plants; it's not surprising that plants have become spirits.</p><p>Qin Sang also sensed the presence of these spirits.</p><p>The four changed direction, flew over a hundred miles, and hovered in mid-air, overlooking the ground below.</p><p>Below, a sea of green stretched out for hundreds of miles.  Giant, overlapping green leaves were incredibly dense and impenetrable.</p><p>‘Pat, pat, pat…’</p><p>The torrential rain pounded the leaves, but they blocked the downpour. The water flowed along the veins of the leaves.</p><p>The leaf veins were unique, forming channels that concentrated the rainwater towards a single point.</p><p>One could imagine waterfalls cascading down from beneath the leaves, while other areas remained sheltered from the storm.</p><p>Qin Sang sensed that many small creatures dwelled beneath the leaves, living as dependents.</p><p>The Sky Ocean Hollow wasn't devoid of insects and beasts, but they were small; clearly, plants held the upper hand in this small world.</p><p>The relentless ocean storms could even draw seawater up into the sky, making survival extremely difficult for scale insects.</p><p>Over time, coupled with other factors, this situation developed.</p><p>‘Rumble!’</p><p>Suddenly, outside the green leaf area, the ground shook violently, causing chaos.</p><p>A mountain-like shadow rushed towards them, driving swarms of insects and beasts into panicked flight.</p><p>The shadow appeared to be a terrifying predator capable of consuming them.</p><p>Upon closer inspection, the shadow wasn't a mountain or a beast, but a huge tree.</p><p>The tree had incredibly developed roots, like thick legs, a massive trunk hundreds of feet tall, and supple, thorny vines. Some thorns held the corpses of animals.</p><p>The tree's thorns were hollow.  They pierced the animals, sucking out their flesh and blood, quickly leaving behind only skin.</p><p>The vines thrashed, mixing blood and rainwater, coating the tree like a demon.</p><p>‘Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh…’</p><p>The insects and beasts, desperate, fled under the green leaves, pursued by the tree.</p><p>Its incredibly sharp thorns were its most formidable weapon, as it attempted to tear through the leaves.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the leaves proved incredibly resilient. A vine whipped down, failed to pierce them, and instead bounced back violently.</p><p>The tree visibly flinched.  Its thick roots clung to the rocks, its trunk swaying violently as it stopped its advance and turned to flee.</p><p>At that moment, a whip-like shadow shot out from the ground, striking the tree with lightning speed.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>The tree was flung into the air, wrapped tightly by the whip shadow. With a ‘bang’, the tree trunk exploded, shattered by the force.</p><p>Then, countless tiny white tendrils shot out from under the leaves, wrapping the tree fragments and pulling them back.</p><p>The green leaves swayed gently, then returned to normal, as if nothing had happened.</p><p>“Mid-Transformation stage.”</p><p>Master Ying declared.</p><p>He was referring to the green leaves, whose cultivation was comparable to a human in the Nascent Soul mid-stage.</p><p>The tree was just a newly awakened tree spirit. After entering the continent, they encountered various similar trees; before they awakened, they could move and hunt; insects, beasts and plants were all their food, making them apex predators.</p><p>However, the true masters of the Sky Ocean Hollow were the powerful tree spirits, like these leaves.</p><p>The green leaves extending for hundreds of miles all belonged to the same ancient tree, a tree spirit with mid-Transformation stage cultivation.</p><p>Though the four hadn't deliberately concealed their aura, it was undetectable to the tree spirit. They freely scanned with their spiritual sense.</p><p>"Its intelligence seems rather low," Master Yu also observed.</p><p>In the Great Thousand World, except for some special races, most tree demons at the Transformation stage had intelligence comparable to humans.</p><p>They continued flying for a while, finding several more Transformation stage tree demons.</p><p>These tree demons varied in size and each had its own territory; some were rooted in place, others moved around.</p><p>They possessed intelligence, but their minds were limited; some, even at the Transformation stage, still acted on instinct.</p><p>The four exchanged observations as they flew, soon coming upon a mountain.</p><p>This mountain was the tallest they had seen since entering the continent; its peak was surrounded by sheer cliffs, suspended in the sky.</p><p>The wind and rain could not reach it.</p><p>Surrounded by the storm, the mountain formed a void; a single beam of sunlight shone down upon it.</p><p>Atop the peak, a red plum tree bloomed in vibrant beauty.</p><p>They had already sensed an aura comparable to a late Nascent Soul stage cultivator on this mountain.</p><p>"Tree demon, come forth!" Elder Gu Yun shouted.</p><p>A radiant red light flickered beneath a tree, revealing a dignified woman who cautiously asked, "Are you… immortals?"</p><p>She spoke in the common tongue, not through telepathy.</p><p>"It seems you've met disciples of the Ji Tian Sect," said Gu Yun Sou with a curious smile.  "No wonder you know how to take human form. What did they tell you? Did they claim to be immortals descending to this world?"</p><p>To the beings of this small world, cultivators at the Void Refinement stage were indistinguishable from gods. But in the Greater World, such a claim would be preposterous.</p><p>"They said immortals would eventually take over this world, guiding its inhabitants to a better future," the woman asked. "Is that you?"</p><p>"You could say that," Gu Yun Sou replied. "What is your name? How many others in this world are at your cultivation level?"</p><p>"My name is Hong Mei," she answered readily. "Four others are at a similar level. We have an agreement to control the center and four corners of the continent."</p><p>Master Yu interjected, "Join us. We'll find the others and learn about this world."</p><p>Hong Mei hesitated, then swiped her sleeve, releasing a red mist that enveloped the tree. Moments later, the tree vanished, and Hong Mei flew up, her expression a mixture of hope and apprehension.</p><p>Qin Sang and the others exchanged glances. Hong Mei was intelligent, yet somewhat naive.</p><p>Gu Yun Sou expanded the white cloud beneath his feet and took Hong Mei with him.</p><p>As they flew, Hong Mei's description, combined with their own observations, gave them a better understanding of Bi Kong Hollow.</p><p>Bi Kong Hollow consisted of a single continent surrounded by the sea. There were no cultivators at the Transcendence stage here; the five peak cultivators at the Transformation stage were all plant spirits.</p><p>According to Hong Mei, this world had never had a recorded cultivator at the Transcendence stage.  The Transcendence stage had always been an insurmountable barrier.</p><p>Legend said that breaking through this barrier would lead to ascension to the immortal realm.</p><p>This legend wasn't entirely wrong.  Like the Storm World, anyone who reached the Transcendence stage could sense the Dao Mark Gate and enter the Greater World.</p><p>Qin Sang and the other three communicated telepathically.</p><p>"This world may truly have never produced a Transcendence stage cultivator. Otherwise, after ascending to the Greater World, they would have established a domain, and a sizable power base," one said. "Yet we’ve never heard of such a thing."</p><p>"That's right," another added. "Many sects in the Greater World were supposedly founded by ascendants from smaller worlds. They would use a small world as a foundation, cultivating it into a blessed land to gradually gain a foothold in the Greater World."</p><p>Hearing this, Qin Sang recalled the Storm World and the countless small worlds he saw in the River of Karma.</p><p>Normally, a single ascendant from a small world would benefit their descendants, establishing a connection with the Greater World.</p><p>But the Storm World was different.  Even after reaching the Dao Mark Gate, ascendants faced life-threatening dangers.</p><p>And the small worlds in the River of Karma? Even those saved by the ferryman were left adrift in the Greater World, almost never finding their home again.</p><p>These worlds received no support, their resources eventually depleted, unable to produce any more ascendants, sinking into oblivion like barren trees, eventually drying up.</p><p>"Limited intelligence, difficulty breaking through the Transcendence stage, this might be related to the shattering of the small world…"</p><p>"The plant spirits born from this unique environment might have extraordinary talents. Cultivating them might lead to unexpected benefits; we should consider accepting them into our sect."</p><p>"I wonder if the Ji Tian Sect has explored the restrictions Hong Mei mentioned…"</p><p>"The value of Bi Kong Hollow is roughly this."</p><p>"There are no sects here, and the mineral and spirit material resources haven't been extensively mined for cultivation purposes."</p><p>"This place is suitable for plant growth, surely there are spirit herbs…"</p><p>"Most tree spirits are inherently fierce, but their bodies are high-quality spirit wood, suitable as a training ground for disciples."</p><p>"Indeed, we can teach the Dao here, cultivate more Transformation stage tree spirits, and allow our Yuan Ying disciples to train here."</p><p>"Yes! But we cannot exhaust resources and cause resentment to build up. We should bring those who reach a certain level, or those who have made significant contributions, to the Greater World and accept them into the sect."</p><p>…</p><p>The four discussed Bi Kong Hollow, planning its division.</p><p>"Wait!"</p><p>Suddenly, Master Yu stopped them, flying a short distance away.  A scene unfolded on the ground.</p><p>Countless white pythons covered the earth, intertwined and dense, extending as far as the eye could see. In the center stood a thin, human-sized green plant.</p><p>This was the root of a tree, belonging to a Transformation stage tree spirit.  The tree itself was this slender plant, while its roots were vast as an ocean.</p><p>Master Yu didn't hide his presence. Entering the tree spirit’s territory immediately angered it.</p><p>The roots thrashed wildly, like a huge serpent's nest, making one's scalp tingle.</p><p>Hong Mei’s lips moved slightly, sending out a telepathic message to soothe the tree spirit.</p><p>Master Yu pointed a finger, and a large section of the entangled roots separated, revealing a fiery red valley.</p><p>A valley was filled with trees resembling maples.</p><p>"Five-pointed maple,"</p><p>Master Yu exclaimed in surprise.</p><p>"Are you sure it's a five-pointed maple?"  Elder Gu Yun examined the trees, noting their significant difference from recorded descriptions.  Five-pointed maple leaves have five points, corresponding to the five elements.</p><p>"Do you doubt the abilities of my Gu He Garden?" Master Yu pointed to the roots.  "It must be a mutation due to the environment, but its inherent talent remains.  Use your spiritual sense to follow their roots; don't they run into a spirit vein?"</p><p>Everyone tried it; indeed, they did.</p><p>"No wonder the spiritual energy here felt so abundant! This kind of spirit tree can connect to spirit veins and harmonize the spiritual energy of a cultivation site. Over time, it can raise the level without needing spirit formations. It's one of the best spirit trees to plant at a sect's mountain gate, rare even in the Greater World."</p><p>Elder Gu Yun explained, then looked at Qin Sang, "Daoist Priest, you can move these trees back to Qingyang Temple."</p><p>Master Yu and Master Ying didn't blame Elder Gu Yun for acting without authorization. Their sects had existed for a long time, possessing various methods of spiritual energy adjustment, and their mountain gates had stable spiritual energy; they didn't need more five-pointed maples.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't refuse, bowed in thanks, and with a gesture, uprooted most of the five-pointed maples.</p><p>The roots stirred.</p><p>Qin Sang flicked out a green light toward the plants.  Upon contact, the plants swayed violently, showing their excitement and joy.  The green light was a cultivation method for plant spirits, given as compensation to the five-pointed maples.</p><p>After finding the five-pointed maples, everyone's interest heightened.  It seemed that the Ji Tian Sect hadn't completely plundered this world; perhaps there were rarer spiritual objects.</p><p>Ultimately, the five transformed late-stage tree demons were summoned to gather information about this world.</p><p>"The four of us are from four sects in the Greater World.  This world will be governed by our four sects.  When the creatures of this world reach a certain cultivation level, they can join us in the Greater World to cultivate. You five, choose a sect to join. Three sects will take one each; two will follow Daoist Priest Qingfeng," Elder Gu Yun instructed.</p><p>The five demons' territories were roughly equal in size, so the four sects divided the land accordingly, each harvesting their own resources.</p><p>"I will follow Master Yu," a tree demon transformed into a large man spoke first, drawn to Master Yu's aura.</p><p>Hong Mei hesitated, then said, "I wish to join Qingyang Temple."</p><p>Qin Sang was surprised. He knew Elder Gu Yun valued Hong Mei, yet she chose to follow him.  Unbeknownst to Qin Sang, Hong Mei had observed the others' unusual attitude towards him during their journey, and noted that Qin Sang had obtained two territories, concluding that Qingyang Temple must be the strongest.</p><p>Qin Sang figured out the reason, thinking, 'This Mei demon isn't without cunning, but she miscalculated.'</p><p>"I'll join with Sister Hong Mei," the only flower demon immediately said.</p><p>Of the five demons, the only two transformed into female demons joined Qingyang Temple.</p><p>Instead of exploring the resources in their territories, Qin Sang and the others were interested in the forbidden lands mentioned by the five demons. This world likely didn't have ancient sect ruins; the forbidden lands were mostly naturally formed dangerous places.</p><p>There were four large forbidden lands and seven small ones.  Even the five demons dared not approach the large forbidden lands.  Two large and three small were on the mainland, having been explored by the Ji Tian Sect, but the sect only plundered the land-based forbidden lands.</p><p>So the four of them went to sea.</p><p>The Northern Sea had the fiercest storms and the most forbidden lands: one large and three small.  Not far from shore, they reached a small forbidden land.  They could see through it without entering.</p><p>"It's a Separating Hook Divine Wind."</p><p>"Correct.  It can be used to temper disciples' spiritual senses, but some protection is necessary…"</p><p>Without stopping, they continued north, flying over towering waves, witnessing an astonishing celestial phenomenon.</p><p>A howling wind spun wildly, drawing countless seawater into the sky, forming a gigantic vortex, majestic and seeming to drain the Northern Sea.</p><p>'Rumble…'</p><p>The wind cut like knives.  The chaotic spiritual energy formed a more piercing gale than the Separating Hook Divine Wind, capable of pulverizing Nascent Soul cultivators. No wonder the five demons dared not approach.</p><p>"This is the Heavenly Sea Divine Eye! Truly spectacular!"</p><p>"It's probably a phenomenon caused by a shattered dimensional space."</p><p>…</p><p>The group admired the Heavenly Sea Divine Eye, viewing the terrifying phenomenon as a beautiful sight, passing through the gale and entering the Heavenly Sea Divine Eye.</p><p>—</p><p>—</p><p>Thanks to Bi Cang Zhe Tian for the generous donation!</p>
