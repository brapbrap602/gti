<h1>Chapter 996: Reforging the Spirit Sword</h1><p>Mo Laomo was a giant of the demonic path.</p><p>That Lingzhuzi, as the leader of the righteous path, should slay demons and eliminate evil was understandable. But the intervention of the Demon Lord was truly unexpected.</p><p>It was unknown what heinous act Mo Laomo had committed to provoke the ire of both the righteous and demonic paths.</p><p>Later, the true story emerged.</p><p>Mo Laomo had dared to violate the ancient rules established by human sages, unleashing a massacre within the Seven Kills Hall, slaughtering Foundation Establishment cultivators without restraint. Even more abhorrently, he had blocked the only entrance to the hall, an act that incited universal outrage.</p><p>Such wicked deeds demanded his execution.</p><p>This joint operation by the righteous and demonic paths was not only to punish Mo Laomo, but also to serve as a warning to others.</p><p>“I'd long heard that the Seven Kills Hall was a dragon's den and a tiger's lair, but now I understand that the greatest danger isn't just the ancient restrictions within, but also the human heart. I wonder what Mo Laomo hoped to gain by slaughtering Foundation Establishment cultivators, only to meet such an end.”</p><p>The shopkeeper sitting opposite Qin Sang shook his head and sighed.</p><p>“Fortunately, the two great cultivators didn't stand idly by. Seeing Mo Laomo's fate, the Nascent Soul elders must be wary and will likely behave themselves, not daring to violate the Four Saints Decree again.”</p><p>“What is the Four Saints Decree?”</p><p>Qin Sang asked curiously, having heard this term for the first time.</p><p>“It's normal for you not to have heard of it. After all, the Four Saints Decree doesn't have much to do with us Foundation Establishment cultivators. It mainly restricts those Nascent Soul elders. I only learned of it from a senior. Do you see the Four Saints Mountain? As the name suggests, the Four Saints Decree was established jointly by those four saints. Its authority extends throughout the land, and none dare disobey!”</p><p>The shopkeeper pointed outside and continued.</p><p>“This island is called Tianxing Island, also known as Holy Island, precisely because it was once the cultivation ground of the Four Saints, and it was from here that our human race prospered!</p><p>“You should know something of human history.</p><p>“Once, our human race was weak, while the Wu Clan flourished.</p><p>“Before the Four Saints, most of the Canglang Sea was occupied by the Wu Clan, and we humans could only huddle in the North Sea. At our lowest point, we were even forced to flee to the Rain Desert.</p><p>“The Four Saints turned the tide, forcing back the Wu Clan and saving humanity from disaster. Later, they led our race in a counteroffensive, pushing the Wu Clan back to the Wu God Continent. This was the beginning of humanity's rise.</p><p>“The Four Saints' prestige reached its peak, and they established the Four Saints Decree. Several of its articles relate to the Seven Kills Hall, including one that forbids Nascent Soul cultivators from slaughtering lower-level cultivators within.</p><p>“However, as time passed and the world changed, the internal situation of the human race has shifted countless times. Many have forgotten, or simply disregard, the Four Saints Decree.</p><p>“Among us lower-level cultivators, even fewer know about it.</p><p>“It is said that the Seven Kills Hall was discovered by the Four Saints. They found treasures and immortal techniques within, which greatly increased their cultivation, enabling them to overpower the Wu Clan experts…”</p><p>The shopkeeper recounted these secrets.</p><p>Hearing this, Qin Sang finally understood the origins of these events.</p><p>No wonder the Four Saints held such high prestige, worthy of human reverence to this day.</p><p>“Thank you for enlightening me.”</p><p>Qin Sang expressed his gratitude, then shifted the conversation, curiously asking, “What became of Mo Laomo? Was he also destroyed along with Tianxing Island?”</p><p>“That…”</p><p>The shopkeeper frowned slightly, shaking his head. “It's hard to say. There's no definitive news circulating. Neither the Demon Lord nor the Heavenly Dao Sect has made an announcement. However, I believe Mo Laomo was only at the mid-Nascent Soul stage. Facing two great cultivators like Lingzhuzi and the Demon Lord, he probably couldn't escape, right?”</p><p>Then, as if remembering something, the shopkeeper added with lingering fear, “Even if Mo Laomo survived by some miracle, he certainly wouldn't be well off. Not only the righteous and demonic paths, but the three major merchant alliances are also kicking him while he's down. They say that a branch of the East Pole Alliance was controlled by Mo Laomo, and its senior members were brutally murdered. Now, the entire branch is gone…”</p><p>The shopkeeper listed Mo Laomo's crimes, which could only be described as countless.</p><p>The merchant branch massacred by Mo Laomo was none other than the Qiongyu Branch.</p><p>Qin Sang shuddered at the thought.</p><p>If he had fallen into the hands of such a person, he couldn't imagine what kind of torture he would have endured.</p><p>At the same time, he felt somewhat dazed.</p><p>He had thought there was no way to deal with Mo Laomo in the future, but unexpectedly, someone had avenged him.</p><p>Come to think of it, both these matters were related to him.</p><p>Mo Laomo ambushed him, initiating the massacre in the Seven Kills Hall. Later, he controlled the Qiongyu Branch also to hunt him down. It was his own fault.</p><p>The only regret was the uncertainty of Mo Laomo's death.</p><p>He still needed to be cautious.</p><p>Qin Sang thought to himself that after arriving at the Heavenly Dao Sect, he could inquire about the details of that battle.</p><p>Even if Mo Laomo had escaped alive, he would surely be severely injured.</p><p>“Should I hand over the Fire Curse Seed? Or go find him myself?”</p><p>Qin Sang pondered for a moment, then dismissed the idea.</p><p>Without knowing Mo Laomo's condition, he couldn't risk it.</p><p>Bai had said that the Fire Curse Seed contained only a limited number of Fire Curses, and his self-created condensation method was imperfect.</p><p>Once activated, the Fire Curses would ‘burn’ and wouldn't last long. The sensing range was also limited. Searching for someone in the vast Canglang Sea was like searching for a needle in a haystack.</p><p>And if he handed over the Fire Curse Seed, he would have to explain its origins.  The Demon Lord coveted even the Eighteen Demonic Banners. If exposed, he wouldn't be able to keep it.</p><p>“What goes around comes around!”</p><p>Although he hadn't personally taken revenge, Qin Sang was still in high spirits.</p><p>Bidding farewell to the shopkeeper, Qin Sang remained on Tianxing Island for a while, searching for Ran Luo.</p><p>Although Ran Luo had introduced him to the merchant alliance, their interactions had been brief. Later, he had dealt directly with Elder Zou.</p><p>Ran Luo wasn't a high-ranking member of the alliance. If she hadn't been implicated, she should still be alive.</p><p>Although he didn't find Ran Luo, Qin Sang learned the names of some alliance members who had died at Mo Laomo's hands, and Ran Luo wasn't among them.</p><p>“I hope she's alright…”</p><p>Qin Sang sighed.</p><p>He couldn't wait any longer. Leaving Tianxing Island, he flew towards the Heavenly Dao Sect.</p><p>…</p><p>The island where the Heavenly Dao Sect resided was even larger than the Orchid Bucket Sect's.</p><p>This island housed no other sects; the entire island was the Heavenly Dao Sect's territory.</p><p>The Heavenly Dao Sect wasn't tyrannical. Except for the core area where the mountain gate was located, other areas weren't restricted. However, few dared to cause trouble here.</p><p>There was a market established by the Heavenly Dao Sect on the shore.</p><p>This was forbidden ground for the demonic path.</p><p>But for righteous cultivators, it was considered the safest place in the entire Canglang Sea, second only to Tianxing Island. Countless cultivators, drawn by its reputation, gathered here.</p><p>Calling it a market was an understatement; it was a city.</p><p>Using a disguised identity, Qin Sang entered the city and then, using his old trick, opened a small shop in the market under the guise of a Refiner.</p><p>Even without the Nine Nether Demonic Fire, he was capable of refining magical treasures.</p><p>After much deliberation, he decided not to contact the Heavenly Dao Sect directly. Instead, he settled in the market, intending to first inquire about the Ning surname swordsman.</p><p>He rented a shop and a cave dwelling.</p><p>Qin Sang remained in his cave dwelling, going nowhere.</p><p>Because he sensed that the Ebony Sword was about to complete its transformation!</p>
