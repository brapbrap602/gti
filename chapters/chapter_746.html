<h1>Chapter 738: Parting Ways</h1><p>After slaying the giant turtle, Qin Sang regrouped with Yuan San Zhenren and the reinforcements. They rescued a group of cultivators from the beast horde. However, facing the ever-growing tide of beasts, they were ultimately overwhelmed and forced to retreat.</p><p>Returning to Tu Island, they learned that cultivators from other islands had also noticed the anomaly and had withdrawn. Now, nearly all the cultivators from the Five Islands Archipelago were gathered on Tu Island.</p><p>But after witnessing the horrific scenes on Mu Island, the cultivators had lost confidence in their ability to withstand the beast horde. After a discussion, they decided to make the painful decision to evacuate.</p><p>Qin Sang looked back at the place he had called home for over twenty years, filled with emotion. In the Demonic Sea, such small islands were often discovered and occupied by cultivators, only to be reclaimed by demonic beasts later. These islands, though lacking Nascent Soul patriarchs, offered more opportunities. Some met their demise, while others found fortuitous encounters and soared to greater heights.</p><p>Abandoning the Five Islands Archipelago, many cultivators were deeply saddened and reluctant to leave.</p><p>"Daoist Qin," the Wang sisters approached Qin Sang after settling their subordinates, inquiring about his plans, "We overheard Yuan San Zhenren discussing the possibility of finding a new location to rebuild the Five Islands Archipelago after leaving this sea region. What are your thoughts? Shall we join them?"</p><p>Rebuilding the Five Islands Archipelago was no simple task. It required not only finding an island with suitable spirit veins to support so many cultivators, but also ensuring the surrounding demonic beasts weren't too powerful, lest tragedy repeat itself.  However, the Five Islands cultivators were all battle-hardened, and Yuan San Zhenren had enough influence to rally many.</p><p>Yuan San Zhenren had already sought Qin Sang's opinion not long ago, but Qin Sang had politely declined.</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head. "I've only recently broken through and haven't had time to consolidate my cultivation. Moreover, the Seven Killing Hall will open in five years. During this time, I plan to travel and explore, and I'm afraid I won't have the energy to participate in rebuilding the Five Islands Archipelago. If you two wish to stay, you may do so.  You've both broken through to the Core Formation stage and are capable of standing on your own.  You've been by my side for so long; I've kept you from your own pursuits.  I can write to Elder Zou and help you secure the support of the Chamber of Commerce."</p><p>This decision had been made long ago. In just five years, it would be difficult to achieve significant improvement in strength through secluded cultivation. It was better to travel and broaden his horizons. On the one hand, he could gain experience, and on the other, Qin Sang had many pressing issues to address and needed to gather information.</p><p>Since being transported to the Canglang Sea Region, from the western border of the Wu God Continent to Wu God Mountain, then to Duyan Island, Huntian Island, and the Five Islands Archipelago, Qin Sang had been either traveling or cultivating diligently, without truly experiencing the world.</p><p>Several problems troubled him.</p><p>The first was his inability to awaken Ya Gu.  While hunting demonic beasts and cultivating, Qin Sang hadn't forgotten to collect secret techniques related to the Corpse-Ghost Dao of both the Human and Wu tribes through the Qiongyu Chamber of Commerce's channels. He spared no expense, purchasing any related cultivation methods and secret techniques, hoping to gain insights and unlock the Heavenly Corpse Talisman to awaken Ya Gu.</p><p>Unfortunately, the circulating Corpse-Ghost secret techniques were either superficial and unremarkable, meaningless fragments, or wildly speculative and impractical. None offered a solution.</p><p>The good news was that Ya Gu's Nascent Soul was stable, and despite the passage of decades, she hadn't succumbed to darkness.  Whether it was the effect of the Warm Jade, the presence of the Fat Silkworm strengthening her Nascent Soul and helping her maintain her tenuous connection to the world, or a combination of both, remained unknown.</p><p>With the Fat Silkworm's growth, this connection would become more stable. As long as Ya Gu could cling to this connection with unwavering willpower, she could gain more time.</p><p>Collecting these secret techniques also benefited Qin Sang himself. As his cultivation grew stronger, the Corpse Pill and the Flying Night Devil would become increasingly less useful due to their inability to improve, eventually becoming mere ornaments.  Both were products of the Corpse Dao secret technique, the "Heavenly Yin Corpse Scripture."  Qin Sang hoped to find other Corpse Dao secret techniques to enhance the Flying Night Devil's power and strengthen the Corpse Pill.</p><p>Then there was his natal magic treasure, the Ebony Sword. After breaking through to the mid-Core Formation stage, upgrading the Ebony Sword became an urgent matter that could no longer be delayed. Otherwise, when he reached the late-Core Formation stage, his cultivation would stagnate.  The Ebony Sword was his bottleneck.  Only spirit wood of the Ten Divine Wood level could enhance it. Searching for such a divine object in the Canglang Sea was like searching for a needle in a haystack, but Qin Sang had to try.</p><p>Qin Sang chose to travel now to gather information, hoping to encounter opportunities that could resolve these troubles.</p><p>Hearing Qin Sang's words, the Wang sisters looked slightly downcast. They exchanged a glance, and the elder sister, Wang Shi, spoke, "Thank you, Daoist Qin.  However, we've discussed it, and if you don't wish to stay, we also plan to return to the Inner Sea.  These years, under your protection, we've both reached the Core Formation stage and accumulated substantial resources, enough to cultivate peacefully for a while.  Moreover, our master is advanced in age; it's time to return and fulfill our filial duties."</p><p>Wang Xiang, lacking her usual playfulness, pouted, "Daoist Qin, our master's cave dwelling is on Lingchun Island, a beautiful place with eternal spring.  Here's a sea chart of the Inner Sea. Don't forget us.  If you ever visit the Inner Sea, please come to Lingchun Island."</p><p>Qin Sang accepted the sea chart from the Wang sisters and nodded in response.</p><p>"In that case, when you bid farewell to Elder Zou, please explain my situation to him. I won't make a special trip. Also, the Qiongyu Chamber of Commerce is quite influential and has a significant presence in the Inner Sea.  Unless your sect forbids it, there's no need to leave the Chamber of Commerce. Having this connection could prove beneficial in the future."</p><p>The Wang sisters nodded repeatedly.</p><p>Wang Xiang looked at Qin Sang's cloak, seemingly wanting to say something, but Wang Shi pulled her back. The two sisters turned and left, gradually disappearing into the distance.</p><p>Qin Sang stood there, watching the Wang sisters depart, then lowered his gaze to the sea chart in his hand. He shook his head almost imperceptibly and put the chart away.</p><p>After leaving the sea region near the Five Islands Archipelago and getting far from the beast horde, the cultivators found a temporary place to rest.  Qin Sang bid farewell to his acquaintances and quietly left.</p><p>A few days later.</p><p>Qin Sang, riding the Two-Headed Vulture, appeared on a small island. After circling the island, he landed on a rocky beach.</p><p>The Ebony Sword transformed into a giant sword and carved a deep hole in the beach. Qin Sang walked inside, sensed the spiritual energy within the cave, and nodded with satisfaction. He then sealed the entrance and set up a spirit array.</p><p>Having encountered a major battle right after his breakthrough, his cultivation hadn't yet stabilized, and his true essence was still turbulent. Otherwise, killing those two great demons would have been easier.</p><p>Thinking of the great demons, Qin Sang flipped his palm, revealing a jade box containing a demon pill.</p><p>This was the demon pill of the giant turtle.</p><p>After slaying the giant turtle, everyone divided the spoils. Yuan San Zhenren, grateful for Qin Sang's assistance, insisted on giving his share to Qin Sang, adding some spirit stones to help him acquire the demon pill.</p>
