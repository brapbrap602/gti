<h1>Chapter 1483: The Son-in-Law</h1><p>The light mirror bought Shang Lu precious time.  </p><p>His mind had been preoccupied with the serpent banner, and he had not anticipated that Liu Li had already mastered the Glacial Soul Divine Light to perfection. Caught off guard, he had no time to dodge.  </p><p>If it weren’t for this treasure protecting him at the critical moment, the outcome would have already been decided.  </p><p>Because what he faced was not only the Glacial Soul Divine Light but also Qin Sang’s Golden Sinking Sword. He was attacked from both front and rear.  </p><p>*Crack!*  </p><p>A series of explosive sounds rang out from the light mirror in front of Shang Lu.  </p><p>The mirror quickly became covered in cracks, its surface coated with a layer of frost. Before the treasure could unleash its full power, it was frozen and rendered useless.  </p><p>The Glacial Soul Divine Light surged forward silently.  </p><p>Liu Li no longer held back, and the bone-chilling cold made Shang Lu’s heart race.  </p><p>The first divine ability of the Listening Snow Pavilion truly lived up to its reputation.  </p><p>At the same time, the roar of a sword echoed across the sky. A sword light pierced through the air, leaving a brilliant rainbow in the night sky, exuding an extreme sharpness as it aimed straight for Shang Lu!  </p><p>Outside the arena, Hall Master Yin and the others looked grave, their true essence surging as they prepared to intervene at any moment.  </p><p>In a battle between Nascent Soul cultivators, victory or defeat could be decided in an instant.  </p><p>Shang Lu had failed to see through the trap and had been caught off guard by his opponent, losing the initiative. Defeat seemed almost inevitable unless he had some means to turn the tide.  </p><p>With the Glacial Soul Divine Light in front and the Golden Sinking Sword behind, Shang Lu was instantly plunged into a perilous situation.  </p><p>However, Shang Lu had not reached his current level of cultivation by being ordinary.  </p><p>Faced with danger, he remained calm. Without even glancing at the Golden Sinking Sword behind him, he immediately recalled his jade ruler.  </p><p>The jade ruler, which had been heading toward Liu Li, abruptly reversed course mid-flight, passing over Shang Lu and transforming into a streak of white light as it shot toward the Golden Sinking Sword.  </p><p>*Boom!*  </p><p>The sword and ruler collided.  </p><p>Countless sword energies and white light scattered in all directions, creating a dazzling display of light and color, like a magnificent firework blooming in the night sky.  </p><p>The jade ruler, hastily summoned to battle, was undoubtedly sent flying by the sword strike.  </p><p>However, the momentum of the sword light was also deflected by the impact.  </p><p>The pressure on Shang Lu lessened significantly. With a forceful slap to the storage pouch at his waist, a snow-white scarf several feet long flew out.  </p><p>As soon as this treasure appeared, it shattered into pieces, scattered by the shockwaves from the collision between the sword and ruler, disappearing without a trace. It seemed extremely fragile.  </p><p>Just as everyone was puzzled, a white mist inexplicably rose around Shang Lu, enveloping him.  </p><p>*Crack, crack, crack…*  </p><p>The Glacial Soul Divine Light followed closely, freezing the surface of the white mist into ice. Shang Lu was now encased in an ice sphere, with the Glacial Soul Divine Light continuing to spread inward.  </p><p>…  </p><p>On the other side, Qin Sang darted forward.  </p><p>This was also the first time he had seen Liu Li unleash the full power of the Glacial Soul Divine Light. No wonder she had been so confident in facing Shang Lu.  </p><p>If it weren’t for that self-protecting treasure, he and Liu Li would have already subdued Shang Lu.  </p><p>Qin Sang’s eyes flickered as he recalled the Golden Sinking Sword. Instead of joining Liu Li to attack Shang Lu, he twisted his body and headed straight for the serpent banner.  </p><p>Outside the arena, numerous Nascent Soul cultivators were watching intently, ready to intervene at any moment. Even if they won, they couldn’t seriously injure or kill Shang Lu.  </p><p>Shang Lu’s defeat was only a matter of time.  </p><p>In that case, it was better to teach him a lesson.  </p><p>Having made up his mind, Qin Sang ignored Shang Lu and suddenly appeared above the serpent banner, pointing a finger downward.  </p><p>*Whoosh!*  </p><p>The Golden Sinking Sword shot down like a bolt of lightning.  </p><p>The sword energy forced the serpent banner to sway precariously.  </p><p>The banner’s task was to suppress Liu Li, but in the blink of an eye, the situation had changed drastically, leaving it no time to adjust. The three snow serpents, still reeling from the impact of the Glacial Soul Divine Light, let out fearful hisses.  </p><p>*Crash!*  </p><p>The serpent banner was violently uprooted, coiling around a jade-white light as it charged toward the Golden Sinking Sword.  </p><p>*Boom!*  </p><p>In its haste, the three snow serpents were forcibly ejected from the banner, disoriented and enraged. They turned and lunged back toward Qin Sang.  </p><p>However, as soon as they materialized, the snow serpents felt a blur before their eyes. A figure suddenly appeared in front of them—it was Qin Sang.  </p><p>Their intelligence was not low, and their demonic eyes gleamed with ferocity as they let out sharp roars. Their long bodies twisted, and their three tails lashed out at Qin Sang with terrifying force.  </p><p>A Nascent Soul cultivator without defensive measures would suffer serious injuries from such a strike.  </p><p>Demonic winds swept toward Qin Sang.  </p><p>“You dare, vile beasts!”  </p><p>Qin Sang snorted coldly. With his mind focused on the Buddha Seal and his steps light as lotus petals, his figure moved like a ghost, easily evading the serpent tails. In an instant, he appeared right above the snow serpents, close enough to touch!  </p><p>The first four seals of the *Seven Masters Buddha Seal*, including the Demon-Shattering Seal, had been fully comprehended by Qin Sang, allowing him to manifest the seals with his mind.  </p><p>He gently extended a palm and pressed it against the forehead of one of the snow serpents.  </p><p>The serpent had no time to react.  </p><p>*Splat!*  </p><p>Brains splattered, and the skull cracked.  </p><p>Even though Qin Sang’s *Heavenly Demon Transformation* was only at the early stage of the fourth layer, his physical body was already comparable to that of an early-stage demon king. When he unleashed the Demon-Shattering Seal, how could a mere demon core-stage beast possibly withstand it?  </p><p>The light in the snow serpent’s eyes quickly faded as it died on the spot.  </p><p>The guests, who had been focused on Liu Li and Shang Lu, finally turned their attention to Qin Sang.  </p><p>“Body refinement?”  </p><p>They were shocked and uncertain.  </p><p>The groom’s spirit sword had been blocked by the serpent banner and the jade-white light. He had no other treasures in hand, nor was there any sign of spell fluctuations. Yet, he had killed a demonic beast with his bare hands in an instant!  </p><p>The *Heavenly Demon Refinement* had been neglected, and Qin Sang’s physical body was now his least significant means of combat. It was the perfect way to divert attention.  </p><p>The remaining two snow serpents were terrified and turned to flee.  </p><p>Qin Sang reached out and grabbed the tail of one snow serpent. With a forceful tug, scales flew off, and the serpent’s bones cracked under the terrifying force that erupted within its body, shattering its internal organs.  </p><p>The last serpent was more alert. It coiled around the serpent banner and desperately rushed toward its master.  </p><p>*Whoosh!*  </p><p>The Golden Sinking Sword dispersed the jade-white light and shot westward, piercing through the serpent’s head.  </p><p>*Clang!*  </p><p>Yue, the cultivator, set down his jade cup and stood up abruptly, his composed expression gone.  </p><p>Qin Sang’s movements were too fast—a palm strike, a grab, and a sword thrust. The three snow serpents were killed in an instant. Those outside the arena had no time to react and could only watch as the three precious snow serpents were slaughtered.  </p><p>By the time the last serpent died, the first corpse hadn’t even begun to fall.  </p><p>Qin Sang grabbed the tails of the three snow serpents, extracted their demon cores, and with a light shake of his arm, tossed the serpent corpses to Shi Xue. He laughed heartily, “I’ve heard that snow serpent meat is tender and delicious. Today, fellow Daoists, you’re in for a treat.”  </p><p>Shi Xue caught the serpents with a smile.  </p><p>Shang Lu had disregarded the bonds of their sect and caused trouble during the wedding ceremony. Shi Xue no longer cared about preserving the dignity of the Heavenly Mountain. Instead, she felt that Qin Sang had done well, venting their anger. She raised her voice and said, “Thank you, Hall Master Shang, for the generous gift!”  </p><p>At the same time, on the other side, Shang Lu finally managed to break free from the Glacial Soul Divine Light.  </p><p>*Bang!*  </p><p>The ice sphere shattered.  </p><p>Shang Lu quickly darted out, his face slightly pale, and he forced a bitter smile. “Junior Sister Liu Li, you truly are a prodigy. To think you’ve mastered the Glacial Soul Divine Light to such an extent.”  </p><p>Having personally experienced the power of the Glacial Soul Divine Light, Shang Lu no longer had any doubts.  </p><p>Liu Li did not respond. Her eyes, now a deep blue, showed her intent to continue the fight.  </p><p>Qin Sang appeared beside Liu Li, casually twirling the serpent banner in his hand.  </p><p>“There’s no need to continue. I admit defeat,” Shang Lu said with a resigned tone.  </p><p>Having lost the serpent banner, he knew that even dealing with Liu Li alone would be difficult, let alone facing both of them.</p>
