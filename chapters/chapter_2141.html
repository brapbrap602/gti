<h1>Chapter 2131 Enlightenment Once More</h1><p>Shaoshi retrieved the Eight Extremes Diagram of Instability, leaving Lu Wang and the others completely exposed.</p><p>Thunder rumbled overhead.</p><p>The aura of death enveloped everyone, bringing profound fear. Faced with such thunderous might, no thought of resistance arose.</p><p>They practically watched with their own eyes as the Grand Protector perished.</p><p>A dignified late-stage powerhouse, capable of wielding the Void Domain divine ability, met such an end, practically without the power to fight back. What hope did they have?</p><p>As a tree falls, the monkeys scatter.</p><p>Those invited to assist, such as Shi Mu and the others, were unwilling to be buried with Lu Wang. Without hesitation, they scattered and fled. As for rallying around Lu Wang, joining forces to overcome this tribulation, they hadn't even considered it.</p><p>As the saying goes, a dead friend is better than a poor Daoist.  Lu Wang was the mastermind; logically, the enemy would choose to kill him first, giving them a sliver of hope.</p><p>Lu Wang inherited the throne and afterward rarely had the opportunity to display his power. Now, with the Grand Protector fallen, Lu Wang alone could not deter these individuals.</p><p>'Rumble…'</p><p>Azure lightning surged, splitting into two streams in the air. One hurtled straight towards Lu Gan.</p><p>One could clearly see, above the azure-tinged sky, a more intensely colored ribbon of energy forming, like an azure river spanning the heavens, descending from above.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Gan was frantically fleeing on the ground.</p><p>The earth's spiritual energy and vitality had been drained by the Eight Extremes Diagram of Instability.  Vegetation withered, mountains transformed into barren hills, offering no cover.</p><p>Lu Gan looked up at the sky, sensing that he had been locked onto by the azure lightning. His expression was incredibly savage, like a cornered beast on the verge of death.</p><p>When the Thunder Oath Decree collided with the Eight Extremes Diagram of Instability, he faced the impact head-on, suffering severe injuries on the spot.  Immediately after, he was pursued relentlessly. Now, he had lost the ability to resist, practically waiting for death.</p><p>'Crack!'</p><p>A beam of lightning descended, containing hundreds of thunderbolts, striking where Lu Gan stood.</p><p>At the last moment, Lu Gan's figure suddenly became illusory. The lightning slammed into the earth, leveling the entire mountain range in one fell swoop, leaving a deep crater in the ground, with flickering arcs of lightning within. Lu Gan vanished from his original spot.  Not far away, one of his spirit beasts, in its frantic escape, transformed into Lu Gan's likeness.</p><p>Just as Lu Gan reappeared, his eyes bulged, flashing with terror.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>Lightning unexpectedly erupted within his body. Faintly, something resembling a sword flash of lightning flickered and vanished.</p><p>Lu Gan's body stiffened, then exploded into pieces, his life force extinguished!</p><p>Another of Lu Wang's generals had fallen, another heavy blow to morale. Even Lu Wang's subordinates began to flee for their own lives.</p><p>Meanwhile, Lu Wang was being pursued by the other stream of azure lightning.</p><p>Lu Gan was not a concern; eliminating him was merely a matter of convenience. Qin Sang focused all his energy on channeling the residual power of the Thunder Oath Decree. The thunderous might, profound as an abyss, locked firmly onto Lu Wang.</p><p>At this moment, all Lu Wang could do was summon his four spirit beasts, sending them fleeing in four different directions.</p><p>Black smoke billowed above his head, within which a hexagonal black umbrella spun and rose. The black umbrella opened, rapidly expanding into a giant canopy large enough to cover several hundred miles.</p><p>The black umbrella became a barrier, separating Lu Wang from the thunderous might. But immediately after, thunder rumbled, the umbrella trembled violently, its surface torn by the lightning. With a bang, it transformed into a cloud of black smoke. The black umbrella reverted to its original form, its spiritual light scattered, falling from the sky.</p><p>Beneath the black umbrella, Lu Wang held a palm-sized circular mirror, aiming its surface at himself. Ripples spread across the mirror's surface, spiritual light like water enveloping him.</p><p>Immediately, light waves rippled through the void, and Lu Wang's figure instantly vanished into nothingness.</p><p>Lu Wang's aura disappeared completely. He couldn't hide his tracks from the Skyeye Butterfly. He must have used a translocation technique to escape, but none of the four spirit beasts showed any abnormality. It was impossible to discern which beast he had transferred to.</p><p>Unfortunately, Lu Wang's clever plan was useless against Qin Sang.</p><p>The four spirit beasts were galloping across the earth when they discovered the ground beneath their feet was gone, along with the sky and the azure lightning. All had fallen into a vast night sky.</p><p>The Four Symbols Sword Formation!</p><p>Although the Void Severing Pagoda was already used, Lu Wang hadn't left his spirit beasts outside beforehand. Qin Sang wouldn't give him the chance to escape.</p><p>Starlight transformed into baleful energy.</p><p>'Rumble!'</p><p>Ten thousand azure lightning bolts simultaneously descended into the sword formation.</p><p>Regardless of which spirit beast Lu Wang had possessed, he would be unable to escape.</p><p>This battlefield held the attention of Shi Mu and the others.</p><p>They saw the lightning briefly vanish, then sudden darkness, followed by the appearance of stars in the sky, the space between them filled with diffused lightning, emitting waves of astonishing power.</p><p>A terrifying force erupted within the starry sky, but Lu Wang's figure never appeared.</p><p>The outcome was obvious. A generation's king had fallen, leaving no room for wishful thinking!</p><p>"The Lu Clan is finished!"</p><p>Shaoshi sensed Lu Wang's aura dissipate, sighing inwardly.  Without looking back, he fled from the Western Lands.</p><p>Two of the Si You Clan's One Emperor and Four Kings had suffered calamities one after another. Si Lu would surely return with momentum soon. The situation was rapidly changing, dazzling and confusing. He had to report back to the Si Emperor immediately.</p><p>How to treat the Yan Shan Si Clan and this True Person Qin in the future also required careful consideration.</p><p>Qin Sang shifted his gaze from the sword formation to the fleeing Shi Mu and the others, saying coldly, "Surrender yourselves, and I may spare your lives. Otherwise, feel free to try and see how many of you can escape my grasp!"</p><p>These words made everyone's hearts clench.</p><p>Qin Sang's power far exceeded their imaginations. Even the Grand Protector and Lu Wang had fallen. The Si You Clan's life-saving techniques were useless against him. Could they truly escape with their lives?</p><p>Yet reason and past experience told them that survival was always earned, not given.</p><p>Waiting passively for death was the true dead end!</p><p>Just then, the Frost Marten jumped out from somewhere, and Si Lu shouted, "Heaven has mercy. Considering your arduous cultivation and that you were not the main culprits in the chaos within my Yan Shan Si Clan, serve as retainers of Yan Shan, and past grievances can be forgiven."</p><p>These words, spoken by a descendant of the Yan King, the next Yan King, held a different meaning entirely. Si Lu's words were like a lifeline, dispelling some of the hesitation in their hearts.</p><p>Especially for Shi Mu and the others, who had no blood feud with the Yan Shan Si Clan, being employed was better than death. The Yan Shan Si Clan was, after all, one of the Four King Clans. Submitting to the Yan King at least preserved their dignity.</p><p>Si Lu only promised the position of retainer, not even Retainer Elder, but they were at his mercy. Defeated soldiers had no right to make demands.</p><p>They didn't want to personally experience the power of the Thunder Oath Decree.</p><p>Soon, some gave up their escape, halting their flight and standing in place, awaiting their fate.</p><p>Seeing this, Shi Mu and Shi Ying also stopped.</p><p>Si Lu remembered their strength well and was secretly pleased to see their willingness to submit.</p><p>Only two of Lu Wang's confidants remained obstinate. They had participated in the massacre during the invasion of the Yan Shan Si Clan and knew there would be no mercy.</p><p>Qin Sang naturally showed no mercy, striking out consecutively, eliminating them one by one.</p><p>With this, Lu Wang's forces were either dead, escaped, or surrendered. The Storm Realm had achieved a complete victory!</p><p>On the battlefield, the thunderous might had yet to dissipate, like the lingering echoes of the battle.</p><p>Qin Sang hovered in mid-air, lightning crackling beneath his feet. He eliminated the last person, then turned his gaze towards a mountain peak.</p><p>Yuan Miao was standing there, staring at Qin Sang in astonishment.</p><p>He hadn't been affected, and Qin Sang wouldn't attack him, so he was unharmed.</p><p>Yuan Miao knew that Qin Sang had communicated with Patriarch Yuan Xiang. Daring to accept this battle meant he had confidence. But he had thought Qin Sang could, at most, put up a fight, delaying them for three years.</p><p>Unexpectedly, when the trump card was revealed, it was so stunning!</p><p>Qin Sang smiled and nodded at Yuan Miao as a greeting, then closed his eyes, entering meditation on the spot.</p><p>"Great True Person!"</p><p>"Saint Qin!"</p><p>…</p><p>Qin Sang seemed to hear the cries from thousands of miles away, seeing the cultivators of the Storm Realm bowing in worship, their fervent reverence.</p><p>These scenes were illusory yet so real.</p><p>This was worship from the heart. The statue from years ago was merely an inanimate object, more symbolic than anything. Now, in their hearts, the living Qin Sang had become the true Saint Qin.</p><p>He was the protector of the Storm Realm, also its ruler. Everything and every being in the Storm Realm depended on him for existence.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang truly and deeply felt that this was his Dao Field!</p><p>The chapters of the Purple Star Sword Canon naturally surfaced in his mind. Those fervent cries, devout hearts, and the experience of consecutively slaying powerful enemies and breaking the enemy formation all surged forth, guiding him through the obscure chapters, dispelling the layers of mist obscuring the path of the Great Dao.</p><p>A joyful expression appeared on Qin Sang's face.</p><p>It was all worth it, all the preparations, every step of the plan, all the painstaking efforts!</p><p>This was the Great Vehicle Path of Slaughter!</p><p>He wasn't sure if this battle could propel him all the way to breaking through to late-stage Void Refinement, but the road ahead would undoubtedly be much smoother.</p><p>In truth, as a Dao Field for a mid-stage Void Refinement cultivator, the Storm Realm was too small, too weak.</p><p>For most cultivators of the Great Vehicle Path of Slaughter, the Dao Field was the foundation of their Dao. The strength or weakness of the Dao Field directly affected their cultivation.</p><p>Logically, with the current Storm Realm, even with the allegiance of its people, Qin Sang couldn't benefit much.</p><p>But the Purple Star Sword Canon cultivated the Great Vehicle Path of Slaughter, emphasizing the word "slaughter." The enemies who attacked this time not only included numerous experts but also a top-tier powerhouse who ranked among the best even in the late-stage Void Refinement realm.  His side only had four Void Refinement cultivators, the highest being mid-stage Void Refinement.  Anyone else would have fled long ago.</p><p>This battle, with its glorious results, such significant gains, was no surprise.</p><p>From now on, internal and external troubles were quelled, the situation was excellent. He could slowly cultivate his Dao Field, and more importantly, focus on improving his cultivation!  Before encountering the next bottleneck, there would undoubtedly be a period of rapid advancement.</p><p>However, amidst his joy, Qin Sang couldn't help but think, still in mid-stage Void Refinement, for enlightenment he had to slay the Grand Protector, a top-tier powerhouse, and nearly annihilate the Lu Clan, one of the Si You Clan's Four King Clans.</p><p>After reaching late-stage Void Refinement, continuing on the Great Vehicle Path of Slaughter, what would he have to do to seek the enlightenment for breaking through to Body Integration?  Could it be, confronting a Body Integration level force, defeating them head-on, or even annihilating them?</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't let joy cloud his judgment. No matter how arrogant he was, he didn't believe he would have the ability to cross a major realm and challenge a Body Integration Grandmaster.</p><p>He could only take it one step at a time, hoping he was overthinking it.</p><p>…</p><p>Outside the Storm Realm, deep in the sea, near the Misty Tide, on a spiritual island, the summit of a mountain peak had been flattened.</p><p>This mountain was lush and vibrant, but seemingly devoid of life, eerily silent.</p><p>On a stone platform at the summit, a chessboard was carved.  Some played, others observed.</p><p>It was the three who had played chess in the Zhu Yan Clan's territory, but the brothers' positions were reversed. A different one played against the white-robed man.</p><p>Spiritual light swirled on the surface of the chessboard. They played the Dao Seeking Chess. The board and pieces resonated with the Great Dao.  A game of chess was like a journey of Dao seeking.  The weaker player often gained more. If fellow disciples of the same lineage played, the stronger one could use it to enlighten the weaker.</p><p>They played against the white-robed man, in reality, seeking the Dao.  It was rare for him to have leisure, and the brothers wished they could play until the end of time.</p><p>The young man holding the chess piece pondered for a long time, carefully placing it as if making a crucial decision. He let out a light breath and looked at the white-robed man.</p><p>The white-robed man opposite him nodded slightly, a look of approval on his face, but didn't rush to make his move, turning his gaze towards the horizon.</p><p>A moment later, the brothers also sensed something.</p><p>The chess player said, "I didn't expect those outsiders to hold on for so long. This time, the Grand Protector should be showing his true abilities, or it will take too long."</p><p>"That altar formation is indeed formidable, but the Grand Protector and Shaoshi are likely wary of Patriarch Yuan Xiang and are still testing the waters. They still don't understand the Zhu Yan Clan.  Those savage fellows act rashly, but their word is their bond. If they said they wouldn't interfere, they won't."</p><p>The observing brother evaluated the three factions, concluding, "As long as the Grand Protector and Shaoshi personally take action, unless someone behind those outsiders intervenes, they will surely be defeated!"</p><p>As if in response to his words, a startling thunderclap erupted, lightning dancing wildly in the distance.</p><p>The brothers' expressions changed instantly. The observer abruptly stood, staring fixedly in the direction of the Storm Realm, his face filled with shock.</p><p>Divine thunder churned heaven and earth.</p><p>With their cultivation, they could sense the terrifying pressure contained within the lightning, so distant yet still making their scalps tingle.</p><p>"This… what is this?"</p><p>The brothers couldn't hide their astonishment.</p><p>The white-robed man's expression remained unchanged. He slowly stood up, snorting coldly, "That True Person Qin is quite something!"</p><p>'Slap!'</p><p>He flicked the chess piece in his hand onto the board. The chessboard trembled, its spiritual light dissipating, transforming back into an ordinary stone table and stones.</p><p>With a flick of his sleeve, the white-robed man rode the wind and departed.</p><p>The brothers exchanged a glance, erased the traces in the mountains, and hurriedly followed.</p><p>…</p><p>Another sea region.</p><p>On a certain island.</p><p>Patriarch Yuan Xiang lay reclined among the tree branches, looking intoxicated.</p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p>He suddenly sobered up, his eyes flashing with a sharp light.  He sat up, gazing for a long time, surprise flickering in his eyes.</p><p>Finally, he clicked his tongue twice, took another swig of wine, and lay back down comfortably.</p><p>It seemed this True Person Qin knew his limits. That thunderous might hadn't reached Sheng Mu Yuan. Otherwise, it would have been a massacre, and the Chang You Clan's Sacred Lake Formation likely couldn't withstand it.</p><p>…</p><p>No one noticed.</p><p>At this moment, unusual fluctuations emanated from the Tainted Lands, but were masked by the clamor of the Thunder Oath Decree.</p>
