<h1>Chapter 875: One Body</h1><p>Qin Sang's thoughts churned. The more he thought about it, the more feasible it seemed. The problem was how to get his avatar chosen by the Smokewater Pavilion and infiltrate it.</p><p>This body's aptitude was very ordinary, possessing only four spiritual roots.  In his previous life, he'd been lucky enough to encounter an opportunity and cultivated to the fifth level of Qi Refining at a young age, but then he'd been stuck at the bottleneck to the sixth level.</p><p>Even if he could luckily break through the bottleneck in the future, he wouldn't achieve much.</p><p>The avatar mainly relied on blood feeding and secret techniques to improve.  The "Seed Demon Fetus" technique had no requirements for the body's aptitude, which was why Qin Sang chose this corpse.</p><p>With such talent, it was impossible for the Smokewater Pavilion to take notice.  Therefore, he could only rely on cultivation level.</p><p>The three major bottlenecks of Qi Refining were the three trials cultivators faced.</p><p>If one could successfully break through these three bottlenecks, even if their aptitude was poor, it at least meant that they were either tenacious or blessed with good fortune, and might have the opportunity to build their foundation in the future.</p><p>These were sufficient reasons to be chosen.</p><p>Possessing such qualities, even if they failed to build their foundation and switched to learning a miscellaneous skill, they could still make certain achievements and contribute to the sect, rather than being a complete waste.</p><p>After all, the Smokewater Pavilion wasn't like the prestigious Lantern Fighting Sect. Their selection criteria couldn't be too stringent, or they might not recruit anyone.</p><p>The avatar's cultivation progressed rapidly and was now approaching the peak of the seventh level of Qi Refining.</p><p>The Smokewater Pavilion's disciple recruitment ceremony was only a month away. Breaking through to the ninth level in a month was somewhat difficult and required Qin Sang to spare no effort, pushing with his own blood essence.</p><p>"Continuous blood feeding should forcefully push him to the ninth level of Qi Refining within a month, but this haste might cause instability in the avatar's mental state.  However, at such a low cultivation level, and with the sword soul still carrying a trace of the Jade Buddha's power, it's unlikely to backfire..."</p><p>Qin Sang had made up his mind.  He instructed his assistant to purchase monster corpses at a high price, then returned to his cave and sat opposite his avatar.</p><p>One month later.</p><p>Qin Sang stopped the secret technique and slowly opened his eyes.</p><p>His face held a trace of paleness, which quickly faded back to normal.</p><p>The avatar's aura was somewhat unstable.  In just a month, his cultivation had surprisingly reached the peak of the eighth level, and he was in the process of breaking through.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The true essence in the avatar's qi sea suddenly expanded, then abruptly compressed inwards, and then quickly calmed down.</p><p>The sound of bones cracking came from his body as it was tempered during the breakthrough. As his aura stabilized, the tempering quickly finished.</p><p>At this point, his cultivation had successfully broken through to the ninth level of Qi Refining.</p><p>If other cultivators saw such an easy and smooth breakthrough, especially at the ninth level bottleneck, their eyes would turn red with envy.</p><p>Qin Sang checked the avatar's condition, confirmed there were no problems, and his expression eased slightly.</p><p>Over the past month, the most exhausted wasn't the avatar but his main body, which not only had to maintain the secret technique but also provide blood essence.  Fortunately, the results were good.</p><p>However, this method of blood feeding to elevate cultivation would become less effective as the gap between the avatar and the main body narrowed.  When their cultivation levels became similar, there would only be one way to quickly improve the avatar: to truly become a demonic cultivator, devouring the essence of other cultivators.</p><p>The "Seed Demon Fetus" was originally a demonic art.  It had been refined by Senior Qingzhu, making it seem less evil, but its essence was still bloody.</p><p>Qin Sang calculated the time.  "The Smokewater Pavilion's disciple recruitment ceremony is six days away.  It's best to go early. Let the avatar stabilize his cultivation.  I'll quickly refine the Devouring Awls and prepare more defensive measures for him."</p><p>Qin Sang set up restrictions, separating a quiet room for the avatar. He then summoned the Nine Nether Demonic Fire, refining the monster corpses his assistant had brought, and took out several pieces of strangely lustrous monster bones from his Qianjun Ring.</p><p>To ensure the avatar's safety, Qin Sang spared no expense, taking out all of his treasured monster bones.  These were the bones of Core Formation stage monsters, somewhat wasteful to use for refining Devouring Awls, but their power was undeniable.</p><p>Without resting, he immediately began refining.</p><p>The demonic fire gathered into a ball, floating in front of Qin Sang.</p><p>Now, his control over the demonic fire and his refining skills were far superior to what they once were.  He watched with ease as the monster bones tumbled in the demonic fire, impurities being refined away, melting into the purest materials, eventually taking the shape of Devouring Awls.</p><p>Based on past experience, he added other insidious features to the awls, such as poison needles.</p><p>After a period of busy work, there were more than a dozen Devouring Awls in front of Qin Sang. He stored them in his storage pouch and selected some magical tools suitable for the avatar's identity, handing them over for refinement.</p><p>Qin Sang looked at the avatar, pondering if there were any other oversights.</p><p>Three days later, in the dead of night.</p><p>Qin Sang set off with his avatar.</p><p>The market town was a long way from the Smokewater Pavilion, but it wasn't much for Qin Sang. By dawn, he had already entered the Lantern Fighting Mountains.</p><p>The Lantern Fighting Mountains were the territory of the Lantern Fighting Sect, along with some smaller sects affiliated with them, occupying various locations within the mountains.</p><p>On a mountaintop.</p><p>Qin Sang looked out at the endless mountains, his expressionless avatar standing beside him.</p><p>"Let's separate here. Take this."</p><p>Qin Sang turned and handed the avatar a Qingfu Money token. He decided to separate here and let the avatar go to the Smokewater Pavilion alone, while his true body secretly protected him.</p><p>The avatar's expression remained unchanged as he silently took the Qingfu Money.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang summoned the Celestial Eye Butterfly, his lips moving slightly as if giving instructions. The butterfly flew around his true body, appearing reluctant to leave.</p><p>Finally, sensing a similar aura to Qin Sang's from the avatar, it became less resistant. Its wings fluttered, and in a flash, it disappeared into the avatar's qi sea.</p><p>"The Celestial Eye Butterfly's concealment ability is enough to deceive others' detection methods, but it's still best not to summon it easily..."</p><p>Qin Sang's expression was serious.</p><p>Both were of great importance to him, and now they had to separate.</p><p>The avatar nodded to the true body, tapped his foot, summoned a bamboo leaf-shaped magical tool, and flew off, soon disappearing into the morning mist of the mountains.</p><p>The true body took a breath, and his figure vanished, silently following.</p><p>The bamboo leaf was light, carrying the avatar as he flew through the mountains.</p><p>The avatar wore a plain gray robe, a jade belt around his waist, and a long sword on his back. The sword was a high-grade magical tool with decent power.  But its unique feature was that it was crafted by Qin Sang from a type of mystical jade, granting it the ability to become invisible when activated, allowing for surprise attacks.</p><p>Besides the sword, the avatar's other magical tools were ordinary, but decent for a rogue cultivator.</p><p>The avatar pinched the Qingfu Money, stored it in his storage pouch, and gazed towards the Smokewater Pavilion, muttering to himself, "From now on, my name is Zhang Yue."</p><p>In that instant.</p><p>His eyes and expression were strikingly similar to Qin Sang's.</p><p>After all, they were one and the same.</p>
