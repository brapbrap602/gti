<h1>Chapter 1409 Scarlet Flame Flowing Fire</h1><p>On the other side.</p><p>Qin Sang and the others had encountered a similar predicament.</p><p>'Whoosh! Whoosh!'</p><p>Scorching, strange winds blew incessantly.</p><p>Apart from the strange winds, they could see nothing else in all directions, above and below, finding no reference points to ascertain their current location.</p><p>These strange winds seemed unremarkable at first glance.</p><p>Only upon actual contact did they realize the winds' formidable power.</p><p>Within the strange winds, there was not only a scarlet flame current but also an unknown golden substance, akin to liquid gold.</p><p>Ordinary protective measures struggled to provide any defense against this golden substance.</p><p>Qin Sang and the others tried several protective secret arts, each of their bodies erupting with various kinds of light, but upon encountering the golden substance, they proved as fragile as paper, being easily pierced through.</p><p>Yet, when they attempted to collect the golden substance for research, no matter what method they used, they couldn't gather it, each time watching it vanish into nothingness right before their eyes.</p><p>Such bizarre things were unheard of by all four present.</p><p>Fortunately, this golden substance wasn't endless; it didn't exist within every gust of strange wind, leaving intervals in between.</p><p>This left them much more room to maneuver.</p><p>"Ignoring true essenceâ€¦ such a thing exists in this world!"</p><p>The cultivator surnamed Qi exclaimed. If they could control this golden substance, wouldn't they be able to dominate everywhere ?</p><p>Any cultivator focused on techniques  would be restrained by the golden substance.</p><p>And in today's cultivation world, almost everyone is a magic cultivator.</p><p>"This thing may not actually exist!"</p><p>Valley Master Mu stared intently at a silver shield in his hand.</p><p>The silver shield was one of his protective magic treasures, which had just transformed into a giant shield three *zhang* tall to block a gust of strange wind for them.</p><p>The shield's surface was now speckled with patches of golden liquid.</p><p>Just as Valley Master Mu was about to do something, a flash of golden light appeared, and the familiar scene recurred, the golden liquid vanishing without a trace.</p><p>Taking a deep breath, Valley Master Mu said, "It's likely an external manifestation of the array's power. This power exceeds our realm, so it appears bizarre."</p><p>Qin Sang had remained silent the whole time. Hearing this, he nodded silently.</p><p>He also felt that even if such a magical treasure existed, if it was obtained by the Pure Ocean Sect, they wouldn't be willing to use it for setting up an array. They would use it to refine magic treasures, giving one to everyone, then wouldn't the Pure Ocean Sect become invincible?</p><p>The North Sea cultivators could only be slaughtered at will.</p><p>The reason was likely that this array, or the realm of the person who set it up, was too high, exceeding their comprehension.</p><p>"This is the Pure Ocean Sect's sect-protecting grand array, not the kind of ancient remnant array like in the Violet Micro Palace. Not only is the array of extraordinary origin, but the person who set it up is at least a Great Cultivator, wouldn't it be... Such a power, such a strong person, why are they unknown in the North Sea?"</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly had a thought, feeling strange.</p><p>Recalling the various legends and strange tales he had heard in the North Sea, he hadn't heard of any Transformation Stage  Buddhist masters.</p><p>At this moment, Valley Master Mu added, "The strange winds fused with golden liquid only appear once every so often. This can corroborate our guess, that the grand array needs a certain amount of time to brew ."</p><p>"Even so, it's not a good thing for us."</p><p>The female cultivator surnamed Wang sighed, "If it were just the golden liquid, it would be fine. Those strange winds are fused with scarlet flame flowing fire, and their power is astonishing. With the golden substance, they can pass through without any obstruction and impact the body of magic treasures. None of our natal magic treasures are defensive, and the highest quality one is actually my Superior Grade Thousand-Pattern Armor. If we're trapped here for too long, I fear it will damage the magic treasures."</p><p>The Thousand-Pattern Armor was the turtle shell-shaped magic treasure that the female cultivator surnamed Wang had taken out earlier.</p><p>This kind of defensive magic treasure known for its sturdiness is already rare.</p><p>Generally speaking, a cultivator's highest grade magic treasure is their natal magic treasure, because it is the easiest to improve.</p><p>Among the four present.</p><p>Valley Master Mu cultivates natal insect poison , and his snake spear is both offensive and defensive, but the transformed snake armor is ineffective against the golden liquid.</p><p>His silver shield is of even lower quality than the female cultivator surnamed Wang's Thousand-Pattern Armor.</p><p>Qi and Wang are both only in the early Core Formation stage , and their natal magic treasures haven't even reached the extreme quality grade. Fortunately, the female cultivator surnamed Wang accidentally obtained the Thousand-Pattern Armor, or else they would be in an even more difficult position.</p><p>The few treasures that Qin Sang relies on the most also don't provide much help.</p><p>"If only the Nine Lives Mysterious Turtle Armor could still be used."</p><p>Qin Sang thought silently.</p><p>With the Nine Lives Mysterious Turtle Armor's quality, there would be no need to worry.</p><p>In recent years, his energy had been focused on refining the Sun Divine Tree and the Golden Submerged Sword. Now he only had a few defensive magic treasures he had refined casually to use as a front.</p><p>A Middle Grade bronze mirror floated in front of his chest.</p><p>The mirror's surface had several pits, which were left behind by the impact just now.</p><p>"For us, the existence of the scarlet flame aura is both a blessing and a curse," Qin Sang stimulated his true essence, smoothing out the bronze mirror, and interjected, "If the Pure Ocean Sect's sect-protecting grand array weren't so powerful, and it weren't impacted by the scarlet flame, causing the array's power to change and even create fissures, the aura of the Myriad Spirit Fruit wouldn't be able to escape. Otherwise, the Fire Jade Centipede probably wouldn't be able to sense the Myriad Spirit Fruit so easily."</p><p>"That's right! There are always pros and cons! Moreover, we've been in here for so long, and the array's power hasn't changed at all, which means it's a dead array. Breaking the array won't be difficult, it will just take some time."</p><p>Valley Master Mu nodded heavily, agreeing with Qin Sang's judgment, "Daoist Priest, can the Fire Jade Centipede sense the Myriad Spirit Fruit now?"</p><p>Qin Sang awakened the Fire Jade Centipede.</p><p>After a moment, Qin Sang nodded slightly, "The various auras within the array are mixed together, it can only determine a general direction."</p><p>As he said this, Qin Sang reached out and pointed to the left.</p><p>The other three looked over.</p><p>The scenery there was no different from any other direction.</p><p>"For us, any direction is the same. Instead of aimlessly searching for flaws in the array, we should just go there!"</p><p>Valley Master Mu made a prompt decision.</p><p>Qin Sang and the other two had no objections, and they immediately changed direction, flying towards the boundless space to the left.</p><p>During their flight.</p><p>Gust after gust of strange wind continuously assaulted them.</p><p>They already had experience in dealing with it, so it was considered safe.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't forget to observe every move of Valley Master Mu.</p><p>He suspected that the Pure Ocean Sect and the Witch Clan had inextricable connections.</p><p>Valley Master Mu's understanding of the Pure Ocean Sect was much deeper than he had revealed, hiding many pieces of information.</p><p>In the current situation, other Core Formation cultivators  could arrive at any time. Obtaining the Pure Ocean Sect's treasures as soon as possible was the right way, if Valley Master Mu knew anything that could help break the array, it was time to bring it out.</p><p>The result, however, left Qin Sang somewhat puzzled.</p><p>Valley Master Mu seemed to genuinely know nothing about the sect-protecting grand array.</p><p>"Could it be that the Hundred Flowers Valley Ancestor obtained the Witch Clan's inheritance from elsewhere, and it really has nothing to do with the Pure Ocean Sect? Is this really a coincidence?" Qin Sang couldn't help but begin to doubt his own judgment.</p><p>However, he shouldn't draw any conclusions before entering the Pure Ocean Sect.</p><p>Qin Sang made up his mind that after obtaining the Myriad Spirit Fruit, he would secretly follow Valley Master Mu.</p><p>Just as Qin Sang's thoughts were flying.</p><p>The array's power finally showed changes. As time passed, the frequency and power of the strange winds gradually increased, bringing them more and more pressure.</p><p>Unknowingly, they had flown in this space for a full two hours, and still hadn't reached the end!</p>
