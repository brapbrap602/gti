<h1>Chapter 2246: The Golden Sparrow</h1><p>“I will investigate immediately!”</p><p>The woman knew that the headmaster Chen had already formed his opinion, and that arguing would be pointless. Only by uncovering the truth could she dispel his suspicions.</p><p>In fact, Chen’s suspicions were not unreasonable.  While there were differing opinions within the Phoenix Clan regarding a potential war with humans, preparations were still being made. This included infiltration of human territories to gather intelligence, recruiting human cultivators to their cause, and deploying spies.</p><p>The woman possessed unique abilities and was skilled in disguise. The clan leader had sent her as a spy to this location, her true mission being to gather information on the Source Purity Mountain and cooperate with Chen.</p><p>For security reasons, the number of spies in any given area was kept low, and they operated independently. They did not know each other's identities or missions, and communication was only through higher command. If another spy were responsible, the woman would be unaware and would need to request information from superiors.</p><p>This was a case of friendly fire!</p><p>The woman silently lamented. If it was a fellow spy, attracting Chen’s wrath, her own safety was a minor concern; what truly mattered was the potential damage to the clan leader’s grand strategy.</p><p>“Please give me ten days, Headmaster Chen. I will provide an answer then,” the woman said.</p><p>“Ten days? My son can’t wait ten days!”</p><p>Chen’s eyes widened as he coldly rebuked her.</p><p>The woman could only plead, promising to investigate as quickly as possible.</p><p>After a barrage of threats, Chen, seeing that the woman did not appear to be the culprit, suppressed his rage, though his anger still burned.</p><p>If Qi Bo and Yu Ze had been killed for stumbling upon a demon clan secret, he would still need this demon’s help to mediate and rescue Yu Ze.  Since Yu Ze's soul lamp hadn't been extinguished, it suggested the killer had ulterior motives and wouldn't strike again immediately. Ten days wouldn’t make a difference.</p><p>After a short while, Chen left the mine where the woman was hiding.  While waiting for news, he couldn’t remain idle. Besides investigating the demon clan lead, he had to explore other avenues of inquiry.</p><p>At the mine entrance, Chen appeared and vanished into the distance.</p><p>Unbeknownst to him, someone was watching, having followed him from the mountain gate.</p><p>After watching Chen leave, Qin Sang remained motionless, wary that Chen's departure might be a ruse.</p><p>He was curious about Chen's actions below. The underground space was cramped and not ideal for hiding, so Qin Sang hadn't followed directly, but his earth-listening bees had recorded Chen's movements and detected another, unfamiliar presence.</p><p>“Emerging…”</p><p>Qin Sang redirected the earth-listening bees and patiently waited. After a while, another person emerged.</p><p>Soon, a figure appeared at the mine entrance.  After cautiously looking around, instead of flying, she swiftly moved through the forest.</p><p>It was a female cultivator, a powerful late-Yuan Ying stage expert, seemingly unremarkable.  Qin Sang wondered why Chen would choose such a secluded location to meet her.</p><p>Qin Sang immediately followed, unseen by the woman; the earth-listening bees were undetectable even to Chen.</p><p>After following the woman for a while, Qin Sang noticed something suspicious about her behavior. She didn’t seem to be from the righteous path and seemed to be avoiding something; even in areas without cultivators, she rarely flew, preferring to stay hidden in the shadows.</p><p>“Hmm? Could it be…?”</p><p>The more Qin Sang observed the woman, the more suspicious she became. An idea suddenly struck him.</p><p>If the woman’s identity was hidden, everything would make sense – she wasn’t human!</p><p>After carefully observing for a while, Qin Sang was certain: she was a demon cultivator. Although she hid her demonic aura well, subtle details betrayed her.</p><p>“Headmaster Chen is secretly colluding with the demon clan…”</p><p>Qin Sang guessed that only Chen was involved in the collusion. First, such matters required secrecy, and second, the Pure Heaven Gate hadn't contacted this demon before Chen returned to the mountain.</p><p>It was possible that his demonic aura from the battlefield led Chen to misjudge and contact this demon spy.</p><p>Was it related to Source Purity Mountain?</p><p>Better to kill by mistake than let slip!</p><p>Qin Sang decided to act. Even if the demon woman was innocent, he could use this opportunity to destroy Chen and the Pure Heaven Gate.</p><p>Unaware of being followed, the demon woman continued fleeing.</p><p>Contacting her superiors was difficult. To ensure safety, the demon clan used a complex communication system.  A faster method existed, but it was reserved for emergencies.  She was heading towards a demon-controlled realm to activate a formation there.</p><p>Lost in thought, she did not notice the approaching danger.</p><p>Suddenly, a cold gust of wind hit the back of her neck, and she sensed a powerful threat.</p><p>She was chosen as a secret agent not only for her high cultivation but also her extensive combat experience.</p><p>“Ambush!”</p><p>The female demon didn't look back, nor did she use her spiritual sense to detect the enemy's position.  Even though she could do it instantly, that split second could mean life or death.</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>Golden light erupted from the demoness. Her robe transformed, becoming a feather garment woven from countless golden feathers in the brilliant radiance.  These feathers glowed with unusual spiritual energy.</p><p>With the burst of golden light, the demoness's speed increased dramatically, shooting forward a considerable distance, but the crisis remained close behind.</p><p>At this moment, the demoness no longer bothered to conceal her identity. Golden light appeared behind her, from which two magnificent wings unfurled.  Her wings were also golden, radiating a regal aura, shaped like phoenix wings, though smaller. The patterns on the feathers were beautiful but somewhat chaotic.</p><p>As the wings spread, golden light rained down as the feathers transformed into golden, razor-sharp projectiles, piercing towards the demoness's back with a piercing sound.  Simultaneously, the demoness revealed her true form – a golden-feathered figure of striking beauty.  Her speed doubled again.</p><p>However, even so, the chilling, shadowy wind at the back of her neck persisted, like a clinging curse, terrifyingly close.</p><p>The next moment, the demoness cried out in agony, a heart-wrenching pain shooting through her wings.</p><p>Golden blood rained from the sky, igniting the ground upon impact with golden flames.  Along with the blood, a golden mass fell – half a wing.  The demoness was left with one wing half-destroyed, the other limp and useless.</p><p>Not only had she failed to harm her attacker, she had been gravely injured, her most important asset – her wings – crippled in an instant!</p><p>At that moment, the demoness realized her opponent's immense power.  If the enemy had wanted to kill her, she would already be dead.  The enemy's strategy of disabling her wings first indicated a desire for capture!</p><p>Understanding this, the demoness knew she had to fight for her life.  She was about to channel her blood energy and use a forbidden clan technique.</p><p>Just then, a series of sharp clicks reached her ears.</p><p>'Crack! Crack! Crack!'</p><p>Three distinct sounds, as if something had shattered. The demoness glimpsed from the corner of her eye numerous transparent pills exploding around her.</p><p>A colorless, odorless gas spread.</p><p>The demoness sensed danger and immediately sealed herself off from the outside, but it was too late.  Her head swam, her blood energy went haywire, and the forbidden technique was interrupted.</p><p>These pills were naturally poison pills refined by Qin Sang.  The best way to capture an enemy is through poison. Since falling into the illusion, Qin Sang's poison skills had repeatedly proven effective, and this was no exception.</p><p>An incense stick later, a streak of light descended from the heavens.</p><p>Qin Sang landed, clutching a golden bird-like creature.</p><p>The creature resembled a phoenix but with noticeable differences, perhaps a hybrid of phoenix bloodline and other demons – a common occurrence in later ages.</p><p>The golden bird's eyes were closed, its breathing shallow, both wings broken, blood flowing freely, its body covered in filth – a truly pitiful sight.</p><p>The area was far from any major sect, allowing Qin Sang ample time to clear the battlefield and then awaken the demoness for interrogation.</p><p>“What clan do you belong to? Why did you infiltrate the heart of Yongtu Immortal City?” Qin Sang demanded harshly.</p><p>The badly injured demoness was slightly disoriented.  Opening her eyes, she saw Qin Sang inches from her face.</p><p>Only then did she clearly see her captor's face, and an expression of disbelief spread across her features.  “It’s you!”</p><p>“You know me?”</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes flashed, instantly realizing something was amiss.</p><p>Sect Leader Chen wouldn't have described him, a minor figure, to the demoness.  This meant the demoness knew him beforehand, aware of his cultivation level, which explained her shock!</p><p>The demoness realized her slip, clamping her mouth shut.  She refused to answer any further questions from Qin Sang.</p><p>However, the look in her eyes, when she looked at Qin Sang, was as if she were looking at a monster.</p><p>Despite the interrogation, the demoness remained silent, seemingly resigned to death. As a secret agent, she had long accepted the possibility of death, her will exceeding that of ordinary individuals.</p><p>Qin Sang, unable to extract information through questioning, resorted to soul-searching.</p><p>He didn't use the soul-searching technique immediately. A thorough examination revealed a hidden restriction on the demoness. This restriction was extremely subtle and would activate if someone tried to search her soul.</p><p>However, this didn't faze Qin Sang.  Qin Sang first cleaned up the battlefield, took the female demon away, and after trying several methods, broke the restriction, leaving the demon completely despairing.</p><p>Qin Sang pressed her fingers to the demon's forehead.  After a short while, a look of understanding flashed in her eyes.  "So it's related to the  *Huang* bloodline…"</p><p>*Huang*, like the Qingluan, is a type of phoenix, considered an auspicious bird in later generations.  The human race has the idiom "Huangdongluanfei," used to describe someone of noble status.</p><p>The *Huang* bloodline in the demon was impure, which wasn't uncommon among the phoenix clan and considered a descendant or branch.</p><p>However, these mixed-blood phoenixes, while acknowledged, couldn't compare to pure-blooded phoenixes.  Their status was similar to that of vassals of the phoenix clan, and the clan didn't allow them to call themselves phoenixes, nor use the characters "Feng" or "Huang" in their names.  Countless such branches existed within the phoenix clan, competing with each other, constantly trying to purify their bloodline to seek ancestral recognition.</p><p>The demon belonged to a branch of the *Huang* clan.  Because of another bloodline from a type of spiritual sparrow, their tribe was called the Yanjin Sparrow clan. The Yanjin Sparrow clan was further divided into families, and she hailed from one of them.</p><p>Knowing the demon's origin, Qin Sang also understood the root of the problem.</p><p>Ultimately, the source of all the chaos pointed to the clan leader of the demon's family!</p><p>"It's related to the *Yin Yang Ying Xiang Da Lun*!"</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes shone with brilliance; she had finally found a lead!</p><p>This female demon was a confidante of the clan leader, privy to many secrets.</p><p>Years ago, the Transcendent Master obtained the Water-Fire Harmony chapter of the *Yin Yang Ying Xiang Da Lun* in that cave dwelling.  Unfortunately, before he could thoroughly explore it, external events forced him to leave the Golden Eagle tribe's territory.</p><p>Simultaneously, their movements were discovered by the Golden Eagle tribe, and the cave dwelling was occupied by the tribe's powerful members.  They left resentfully, and the remaining treasures in the cave were naturally divided among the Golden Eagle tribe's powerful members.</p><p>Later, during the struggle for the Stone Embryo Fire, Qin Sang killed one of them and recovered some of the treasures.</p><p>Certainly, more than one powerful member of the Golden Eagle tribe participated in the division of treasures back then; this one only had a portion.</p><p>The Transcendent Master, having expended great effort without finding valuable clues, had said that finding the other Golden Eagle tribe members and recovering all the treasures would be necessary for progress.</p><p>For some reason, a portion of the treasures fell into the hands of the female demon's clan leader, who became intensely interested and began frantically collecting other treasures and information, eventually tracing it back to the Transcendent Master.</p><p>The Transcendent Master and Yuanjing Mountain were originally located in the Golden Eagle tribe's territory, and the Transcendent Master personally participated in the struggle for the cave dwelling.  Based on these clues, it was not difficult for the demon to discover that the Transcendent Master had re-established Yuanjing Mountain in Yongtu City and that Yuanjing Mountain had changed its teachings to cultivate both water and fire, clearly benefiting from the cave dwelling.</p><p>Qin Sang had originally planned to return to the Golden Eagle tribe in secret as a demon cultivator after breaking through to the Yuan Ying stage to search for the treasures that had been scattered from the cave, but this demon had beaten her to it.</p><p>From then on, this demon targeted Yuanjing Mountain. Fortunately, believing the treasures were all in the Transcendent Master's possession, the demon feared alarming them and refrained from attacking the disciples.  Furthermore, Qin Sang was always cautious, keeping a low profile, and whenever she appeared publicly, she did so alongside powerful figures in the city, thus escaping harm.</p><p>When the demon investigated Yuanjing Mountain, the Transcendent Master was already in seclusion.</p><p>The demon, only at the early stage of the Transformation God realm, found it difficult to deal with the Transcendent Master, a Celestial Guard.  Worried that it would be even harder after the Transcendent Master broke through, the demon approached the Chen Clan Leader and sent the female demon to disrupt the Transcendent Master's cultivation.</p><p>The plan was to force the Transcendent Master out of seclusion, then wait for him to go on a mission and ambush him.</p><p>The demon's plan was meticulously crafted, yet it failed to account for Qin Sang, leading to its downfall and the failure of all its schemes.</p><p>"Whether the *Huang* bloodline is compatible with the Yin Yang Dao is unknown, but the Yanjin Sparrow bloodline is impure, and thus doesn't necessarily follow the *Huang* bloodline.  The fact that this demon went to such lengths indicates they found some benefit. Perhaps they possess other chapters of the *Yin Yang Ying Xiang Da Lun*!"</p><p>This thought occurred to Qin Sang, and the intention to kill solidified in her heart.</p><p>Acting decisively, she immediately sent a talisman to Yuanjing Mountain, warning them to stay within the mountain and avoid going out. Then she rushed to the city, waited two days, and boarded a spirit boat.</p><p>She learned from the demon that her clan leader had also left their family and was currently at the front lines!</p><p>—</p><p>—</p><p>Unknowingly, it's a new year again. Wishing everyone a Happy New Year, happiness to your families, and a better life each year!</p>
