<h1>Chapter 2265: Traces of the Divine Mountain</h1><p>Defeat at the hands of the Shadow would mean replacement.</p><p>So, if I kill the Shadow here, would the outcome be different from before?</p><p>Qin Sang watched Xi Rui approaching, sensing his aura rapidly recovering.  Xi Rui then slowed his flight, clearly confident in dealing with the Shadow.</p><p>However, Qin Sang couldn't continue watching. Unlike the weakened Xu Mu, a full-strength Xi Rui and the Shadow would be locked in a protracted battle.</p><p>Xu Mu's fate was a warning.  Liuli's situation was worrying. But since entering this place, a thought had been swirling in Qin Sang's mind.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at the approaching figure, then turned and left.</p><p>Not far away, he heard a mountain-shaking roar from behind – Xi Rui and the Shadow had engaged.</p><p>He didn't look back, flying straight ahead.  He encountered several more battlefields, including a Zhu Yan clan expert locked in a stalemate with the Shadow. The outcome remained uncertain.</p><p>But Qin Sang couldn't intervene yet. He urgently needed to verify something.</p><p>The secrets of this world were still unknown.  Revealing himself now would be unwise.</p><p>Since entering the sacred land, Qin Sang had deliberately held back his strength against the Shadow. The Shadow hadn't learned much; eliminating it would be easy if Qin Sang chose to.</p><p>However, intervening would mean losing the Celestial Awareness Thunder Robe.  Leaking his aura would attract the Shadow, which was a minor concern.  Qin Sang worried that his rapidly recovering cultivation would be detected by the mysterious Qingluan.</p><p>This couldn't be explained by talent alone. The mysterious Qingluan would surely suspect him.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't want to break with the mysterious Qingluan. If his hunch proved correct, he would need her help in the future!</p><p>He merely glanced down as he flew over the battle, unnoticed by both sides.</p><p>No one, including the Shadow, detected Qin Sang along his path.</p><p>As he continued, the feeling became stronger.</p><p>Since entering this realm, Qin Sang had sensed something unusual – a mysterious energy flowing constantly towards a single point.</p><p>Others might have sensed it too, but preoccupied with the Shadow, they couldn't focus. Only Qin Sang had this luxury.</p><p>In Qin Sang's perception, the energy converged closer and closer, right ahead.</p><p>As he drew nearer, the landscape felt familiar.</p><p>The familiarity wasn't from the vegetation, but the mountain range's formation, like the earth's veins, strikingly similar to what he’d seen in the illusory realm before being pulled in!</p><p>He hadn't had time to explore the entire illusory realm, only the area between its edge and the divine mountain.</p><p>Standing atop the divine mountain, he'd gazed into the illusory realm's depths.  The crisscrossing mountains in his memory matched perfectly with the ones before him.</p><p>Meanwhile, Qin Sang saw misty mountains, clouds, and a particularly dense area amidst them – a vast expanse.</p><p>Intrigued, he headed towards it.  As he drew closer, he saw a mountain hidden within the clouds!</p><p>Steep, majestic, shrouded in mist and clouds, it was no ordinary mountain.</p><p>Even before seeing it clearly, Qin Sang knew: this was the divine mountain from the illusory realm!</p><p>Soon, he saw the entire mountain, noticing many differences from the one in the outside world. This mountain lacked the jade platforms and seating arrangements, showing no signs of artificial alteration. It was entirely natural.</p><p>Without the jade platforms, there were no meditating cultivators.</p><p>This was a divine mountain, yet not a divine mountain.</p><p>This matched Qin Sang's hypothesis.  They weren't back in reality, but in a zone blending reality and illusion. This mountain was likely a projection from the real divine mountain into the illusion.</p><p>Qin Sang gazed at the mountain, his expression serious.</p><p>This confirmed his theory. Their ability to sense the celestial omen and be drawn here when the treasure appeared was linked to this divine mountain.</p><p>Those who hadn't reached the divine mountain before the illusion erupted, such as Liuli, might still be trapped in the illusion!</p><p>This must have been a contingency plan by the powerful members of the Yi Ren clan: to have them reach the divine mountain beforehand, then be summoned via the mountain when the treasure appeared in the illusion.</p><p>Regarding the shadowy figures, it's likely an illusion created by the mystical Qingluan's "heavenly secrets,"  obstacles placed in their path.</p><p>If this is true, it's a double-edged sword for Qin Sang and Liuli.  Liuli fell into the illusion while undergoing her tribulation, so if she's also been pulled into this realm, she'd be even worse off than Xu Mu, likely already overcome by the shadowy figures. If she remains trapped in the illusion, she might escape this ordeal, but Qin Sang wouldn't be able to find her here.</p><p>However, these are still just Qin Sang's speculations. Concerning Liuli's safety, he doesn't dare to jump to conclusions; he must search for her himself.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, this realm corresponds to the real-world Illusionary Domain. Qin Sang has already studied the records of the Illusionary Domain in the Purple Cloud Mountain archives, and has a general idea.</p><p>Furthermore, Qin Sang noticed something unusual: the mysterious energies converged at the summit of the Divine Mountain.</p><p>"Could the treasure be born on the peak of the Divine Mountain?"</p><p>Qin Sang mused, glancing at the summit before passing the Divine Mountain and continuing onward.</p><p>Shortly after, Qin Sang paused, his gaze fixed on a mountain below.</p><p>In reality, this is where he placed the Daiyu Immortal Mountain. Following Ning Zhenren's instructions, he allowed the Daiyu Immortal Mountain to absorb the immortal mountain essence. However, shortly after placing it here, strange occurrences began, and he was pulled into the illusion before he could retrieve it.</p><p>Qin Sang doesn't know how much time has passed in reality, or if the mountain absorbed enough essence.</p><p>He assumed he'd need to return to reality to retrieve the Daiyu Immortal Mountain, but passing this mountain, he felt an inexplicable connection.</p><p>He'd already scanned the entire mountain with his spiritual sense over a dozen times.  Unlike in reality, the mountain is solid, with no caves; the Daiyu Immortal Mountain isn't there.</p><p>Yet, the feeling is undeniable. He is the master of the Daiyu Immortal Mountain; he can't be wrong.</p><p>"Could it be..."</p><p>Qin Sang considered a possibility.  The Yi Ren tribe's sacred site is built upon Yuanqiao Immortal Mountain, one of the five great immortal mountains.  The Illusionary Domain contains immortal mountain essence, the Divine Mountain formed near it, and the Daiyu Immortal Mountain shares origins with Yuanqiao... connecting these clues, could the Daiyu Immortal Mountain also traverse between reality and the illusion?</p><p>Perhaps because the Daiyu Immortal Mountain hasn't yet absorbed enough essence, Qin Sang can only sense it, not summon it.</p><p>According to Ning Zhenren, if he could recall the restored Daiyu Immortal Mountain during the decisive battle, it would be a tremendously powerful asset!</p><p>Unfortunately, the time isn't right.</p><p>After a moment's pause, Qin Sang left and flew onward to the location of Liuli's tribulation.</p><p>He looked down at the lush, vibrant scenery.  Having expected little, and seeing Liuli wasn't there, he began his search.</p><p>...</p><p>In reality:</p><p>The Illusionary Domain remains shrouded in eternal night.  The Divine Mountain is cloaked in darkness; numerous jade platforms dot its surface, most occupied by a person.</p><p>They sit with closed eyes, seemingly asleep, motionless, the mountain deathly silent.</p><p>Suddenly, on a jade platform slightly above the halfway point, a figure trembles.</p><p>This is Xu Mu.  He provided intelligence to the Yi Ren tribe, earning him this position.</p><p>Xu Mu has been sitting quietly here, but now, he stirs, his face contorting in pain, yet he doesn't awaken.</p><p>He remains seated, his expression becoming increasingly distorted, alternating between agony and a strange smile, growing more grotesque, resembling a malevolent ghost in the darkness, terrifying.</p><p>Then, the jade platform beneath him suddenly flashes with a soft light, strikingly bright in the darkness.</p><p>The light gently envelops Xu Mu, seeming to offer comfort; his expression softens somewhat.  But his face remains distorted, the light only alleviating, not resolving his predicament.</p><p>This anomaly isn't limited to Xu Mu; it's occurring across the Divine Mountain.</p><p>Their reactions vary. Some, like Xu Mu, are in pain. Others are consumed by extreme fear, trembling violently.  Invariably, their expressions are changing, gradually resembling someone else.</p><p>Undeniably, like Xu Mu, these individuals were possessed by shadowy figures in the illusion, and this is now affecting their real-world selves.</p><p>As these changes occur, a soft light emanates from the jade platforms beneath them.</p><p>This light is the Divine Mountain's protective power.</p><p>It's clear that these individuals' positions vary in rank; the intensity and solidity of the light differs.  Those higher in rank receive brighter, stronger protection, and fare better than those below.</p><p>Alas, the Sacred Mountain only offers temporary protection, slowing the Shadow's possession of their true forms. The faint light cannot immediately repel the Shadows and return them to reality. If the true forms cannot suppress the Shadows, they will inevitably succumb.</p><p>The order of precedence on the Sacred Mountain, the mental state and will of the true forms, will all influence the fates of Xu Mu and others.</p><p>These changes were immediately noticed by Hong Tian and others.</p><p>"It's finally about to emerge..."</p><p>Hong Tian gazed into the depths of his heart lake, quietly relieved.</p><p>Da Meng Shen Jun and other powerful beings of the Otherworldly race are trapped in the dream, their future uncertain. Those outside, tasked with preventing the dream's spillover, face equal hardship. Each defense against the dream's onslaught drains their strength immensely.</p><p>Suddenly, Hong Tian's expression changed. A powerful aura erupted in the distance, its intent unmistakable, locking onto the Sacred Mountain.</p><p>Hong Tian coldly snorted, knowing that some were preparing to seize the treasure.</p><p>Despite signs of the treasure's emergence, no one had acted yet, for three reasons:</p><p>First, they had only recently broken through to the Saint Realm, lacking deep foundations, and struggling to maintain themselves.</p><p>Second, they cannot yet break the dream and interfere within it. Waiting for the treasure to appear and trigger dream turmoil is the optimal time to act.</p><p>Third, they fear being implicated and falling into the dream, so they dare not directly attack the Sacred Mountain.</p><p>Yet, with such a great opportunity, none will yield.</p><p>Hong Tian secretly allied with helpers, but dared not fully trust anyone. In the crucial moment, he must rely on himself, while also guarding against veteran powerhouses. A final showdown is inevitable.</p><p>Qin Sang and others, dispatched by them, are likely near the treasure; their role is crucial.</p><p>Whoever secures the treasure first gains a significant advantage.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>A red thread shot from Hong Tian's bosom, lightly floating into the sky, hanging motionless, transforming into a crimson glow.</p><p>The nature of this crimson glow is unknown, but like the previous individual, it locks onto the Sacred Mountain, ready to act at any moment.</p><p>Immediately, powerful auras soared, undercurrents surging.</p><p>...</p><p>"Not here!"</p><p>Qin Sang searched everywhere, but found no trace of Liu Li, not even remnants of her battle.</p><p>Liu Li was not alone.</p><p>Those cultivators who failed to reach the Sacred Mountain before the illusion erupted have also vanished.</p><p>These signs confirm Qin Sang's suspicions.</p><p>"It seems we were drawn into this realm by the power of the Sacred Mountain. Liu Li is still in the illusion," Qin Sang mused, flying towards the mountain.</p><p>Returning near the Sacred Mountain, Qin Sang found no others had arrived yet.</p><p>During this time, he witnessed some being possessed by Shadows, vanishing like Xu Mu; others defeated the Shadows, yet remained immobile; most continued to struggle against them.</p><p>Predictably, those who defeated the Shadows, freed from their troubles, will soon arrive.</p><p>Can he do something beforehand, while others are preoccupied? The Sky-Feeling Thunder Garments might not last until the treasure appears.</p><p>This thought struck Qin Sang as he approached the Sacred Mountain.</p><p>The summit showed new changes.</p><p>Centered on the mountain's peak, mist and clouds swirled, forming a giant vortex.</p><p>The Sacred Mountain lay at the vortex's center, drawing in a continuous flow of mysterious power.</p><p>Qin Sang's perception of this power sharpened, but after observing for a moment, his face changed drastically.</p><p>"This power... this power..."</p><p>Qin Sang recalled the moment of the darkness's invasion; this mysterious power is the power of the illusion!</p><p>Illusionary power flowed endlessly towards the Sacred Mountain's peak, as if into a bottomless pit, endlessly consumed yet never filled.</p><p>It seems the treasure's emergence requires the consumption of the illusory power. In other words, the illusion is the treasure's nourishment, providing sustenance for its growth!</p><p>At this rate, when the treasure matures, this illusion will likely be devoured, completely vanishing.</p><p>What will happen then?</p><p>Those in this realm should receive the Sacred Mountain's protection and return to the real world.</p><p>Among them are powerful scions like Xi Rui, and leaders like Yuan Xiang—top figures of their time. The Otherworldly powerhouses would not likely abandon them.</p><p>But what about those still trapped in the illusion, like Liu Li?</p><p>If she's expelled when the illusion vanishes, it will affect her tribulation, and Qin Sang cannot interfere.</p><p>But that's not the worst outcome!</p><p>If Liu Li perishes with the illusion, or is lost forever...</p>
