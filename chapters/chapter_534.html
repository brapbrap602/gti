<h1>Chapter 527:  Transformation of Fire!</h1><p>Chapter 527:  Transformation of Fire!</p><p>The higher up the mountain, the fewer people there were.</p><p>Qin Sang realized that the distribution of cultivators on Shen Gang Peak was based on cultivation level. The closer to the summit, the more chaotic the elemental energy became, making it only bearable for those with sufficiently high cultivation.</p><p>The advantage was the ability to absorb purer Gang Qi, leading to faster cultivation speed.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't figure out whether this chaotic elemental energy was related to the Ancestral Sacred Fire at the peak.</p><p>Quietly passing a Qingyang Demon Sect cultivator, Qin Sang finally saw a jade-like Qingyang Gang Ying embedded in a large rock.</p><p>The rock was shaped like a millstone lying on its side, with the Qingyang Gang Ying perfectly nestled in the center.</p><p>After glancing around, Qin Sang cautiously approached the rock and reached out. A chill emanated from the Qingyang Gang Ying. Upon closer examination, he was delighted to discover that the Gang Qi within was incredibly pure, requiring no refinement.  He could absorb it directly, even without cultivating the Qingyang Demon Fire.</p><p>Reassured, Qin Sang continued his ascent, searching until he found another, well-hidden Qingyang Gang Ying in a crevice.</p><p>This is it!</p><p>This Qingyang Gang Ying wasn't large, about the size of a baby's fist.  Based on his recent understanding, it was more than enough.</p><p>Qin Sang slowly exhaled, took out the Shao Yin magnetic bottle from his bosom, placed it before him, and sensed the Qingyang Gang Ying again to confirm it was correct.</p><p>He opened all the bottles, absorbing the Earthly煞 Qi into his body, then destroyed the bottles and erased all traces.</p><p>Once the Gang煞 Dan fusion began, he wouldn't be able to spare any attention, so he forcibly absorbed them into his Qi Sea.  It would be manageable in the short term, becoming easier as the Earthly煞 Qi was consumed.</p><p>"It has to work!"</p><p>Qin Sang encouraged himself, easing his nervous yet urgent feelings, quickly clearing his mind to achieve serenity.</p><p>He sat cross-legged before the Qingyang Gang Ying, his hands lightly resting on it, remaining motionless.</p><p>After a moment, a flash of green light suddenly appeared from the Qingyang Gang Ying, separating into a streak of green light that danced on Qin Sang's fingertips before vanishing.</p><p>Into Qin Sang's body.</p><p>The Gang Qi flowed along his meridians, soon to enter his Qi Sea.</p><p>This stream of Qingyang Shen Gang was several times larger than the one Shi Ying had gathered.  Qin Sang held his breath, summoning the ebony sword into his dantian, carefully calming his Qi Sea, then drawing out a similar amount of Earthly煞 Qi to await its arrival!</p><p>'Crackle!'</p><p>The moment the two energies sensed each other, they unsurprisingly went into chaos. Qin Sang had been waiting for this and immediately used the Earthly煞 Qi to charge towards the Golden Core, drawing the Qingyang Shen Gang along. He then used all his spiritual power to tightly envelop them, attempting to calm them.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The first attempt failed; his Qi Sea churned violently before finally calming down after a long time.</p><p>However, Qin Sang was even more confident.  He laughed heartily, and without hesitation, tried again!</p><p>Repeated failures couldn't shake his resolve.</p><p>Time slowly passed; he had tried countless times, when Qin Sang’s expression suddenly changed.</p><p>A tiny, barely noticeable spot appeared on the surface of his Golden Core. Inside the spot, a mixed light of green and black shimmered.</p><p>The Gang煞 Dan fusion had finally succeeded!</p><p>Qin Sang's face lit up with joy, but then his expression turned serious. His guess was correct; the Gang煞 Dan fusion was different from a pure Earthly煞 Dan fusion, making his Golden Core incredibly unstable and on the verge of collapse.</p><p>Once started, it had to continue without stopping!</p><p>Not daring to pause, Qin Sang hurriedly absorbed another wisp of Gang Qi, sending it into his Qi Sea to continue the impact on the Golden Core.</p><p>Using the secret technique on himself was certainly different this time. He could keenly and quickly detect and adjust to even the slightest change.</p><p>Not only was the Gang煞 Dan fusion faster than before, but the corpse refinement technique also progressed smoothly.</p><p>Of course, this smooth progress was partly due to the ever-ready ebony sword.</p><p>On Shen Gang Peak, the Ancestral Sacred Fire raged.</p><p>The Qingyang Demon Sect disciples were completely unaware that someone was stealing their sect's treasure.</p><p>Time flowed silently.</p><p>Unknowingly, an hour and a half passed. The Qingyang Gang Ying before Qin Sang had visibly shrunk considerably, and the secret technique was nearing its end.</p><p>Unaware, as the Qingyang Gang Ying continued to diminish, the summit of Shen Gang Peak began to change!</p><p>On Shen Gang Peak, the Ancestral Sacred Fire became even more violent.</p><p>Affected by the Ancestral Sacred Fire, Shen Gang Peak suddenly changed drastically, with raging thunder.</p><p>The sudden change on Shen Gang Peak was astonishing, alarming the Qingyang Demon Sect's experts.</p><p>The Sect Master adjusted the Gan Jade formation to suppress the Ancestral Sacred Fire, so why the sudden change? Did someone disregard the Sect Master's orders and excessively draw on the Gan Jade, affecting the formation?”</p><p>Numerous caves opened, and two figures with powerful auras appeared before Divine Gan Peak, both at the late Foundation Establishment stage.</p><p>They drove the onlookers back to their caves, looked up at the peak with serious expressions.</p><p>“Only those fellow disciples have the ability to draw on the Gan Jade.  Uncle Wu and Brother Li are at the Boundless Valley rescuing someone, but who else is still on the mountain?”</p><p>One of them frowned, “Thankfully, the Ancestral Sacred Fire hasn't spiraled out of control; it's not too difficult to fix. Let's send the other disciples down the mountain first. Whether it's sabotage or a formation malfunction, we'll find out once we go up.”</p><p>The other was furious, “I just had a flash of insight, a breakthrough, but it was interrupted!  I can't remember anything anymore. If I find out who did this, they'll regret it!”</p><p>Qin Sang remained blissfully unaware of the outside changes.</p><p>He had no idea that the stability of the Ancestral Sacred Fire was linked to the Gan Jade on Divine Gan Peak. This was a closely guarded secret of the Qingyang Demon Sect, known only to the high-ranking members. It was naturally impossible for him to find out. Even if he knew, he couldn't move freely right now.</p><p>His Golden Core in his dantian had undergone a drastic transformation.</p><p>It was now bi-colored, black and green, each color occupying half, with only a small sliver of the original Golden Core's radiance remaining.</p><p>Once that sliver was also consumed, the Gan煞冲丹 would be complete!</p><p>Another surge of Gan煞 successfully entered the Golden Core. Just as Qin Sang was about to continue absorbing the Qingyang Divine Gan, he heard a roar from below, "Stop!"</p><p>Qin Sang paused, turning to see two figures rushing through the mist.</p><p>He was about to succeed; why would someone suddenly come up the mountain and discover him so easily?</p><p>Qin Sang’s heart skipped a beat. Looking up, he was astonished to see a vortex of wind and clouds above him, seemingly appearing out of nowhere.</p><p>The vortex hung low, with lightning flashing within it.  A thin, hair-like stream of fire descended from the vortex, slowly falling, radiating terrifying power.</p><p>It was…</p><p>The Ancestral Sacred Fire!</p><p>Qin Sang's face paled. He immediately realized he’d overlooked something crucial.</p><p>Having expended immense energy for the Gan煞冲丹, his body was severely depleted!</p>
