<h1>Chapter 2273: Intentions</h1><p>Soul contracts, bound to the soul, cannot be broken unless the person who made it chooses to release it, even by someone with immense power.</p><p>It’s like the Undying Emperor, Little Yellow Chicken.  Even when he was only a God King, the Emperor couldn't break the contract. To prevent betrayal and backlash, the Master Continent established a rule: even if someone transcends the Heavenly Dao scroll, they cannot escape a soul contract!</p><p>“Soul contracts can’t be severed from the sea of consciousness, but I’ve integrated a special gas that can even dissolve the Heavenly Dao.  Breaking this contract isn’t hard…with enough power, I can simply obliterate the contract itself!” the ruthless cultivator said.</p><p>Soul contracts are based on the Heavenly Dao.  A special energy capable of dissolving even the Heavenly Dao in the God Realm can easily break a soul contract, as long as it’s handled correctly.</p><p>“I see…” Zhang Xuan's eyes flashed.</p><p>“I’ve explained this much as thanks for bringing me to the God Realm!”</p><p>After the explanation, the ruthless cultivator said nothing more. Their aura became more ancient and distant, and the black hole behind them grew larger, clearly absorbing more power to replenish itself.</p><p>“Zhang Xuan, the more the black hole absorbs, the stronger he gets…”</p><p>Luo Ruoxi noticed something was amiss and urgently transmitted a message.</p><p>“Prepare to fight!”  With his doubts resolved, Zhang Xuan took a deep breath, raising his sword. “Then let’s settle this!”</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>He unleashed his most powerful sword intent.</p><p>To live, to return; to die, to yearn.</p><p>Life and death hold no meaning, what can stop me?</p><p>Although this sword technique hadn't reached the level of an Emperor's understanding, it contained all his convictions, pushing the Heavenly Compassion technique to its limits.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>His sword cleaved the ruthless cultivator’s attack in two.</p><p>Simultaneously, Luo Ruoxi attacked, her sword energy like a blizzard.</p><p>Her swordsmanship was similar to the young man from Sword God Heaven, possessing an irresistible momentum and natural grace.</p><p>“Your moves are impressive, but they are still lacking compared to mine…”</p><p>With a light smile, the ruthless cultivator struck again.</p><p>In an instant, the sky and earth were covered by their palm, space shattered, and the sun, moon, and stars seemed about to be struck down.</p><p>*Pff!* *Pff!*</p><p>Zhang Xuan and Luo Ruoxi were sent flying, spewing blood in midair.</p><p>Even with their strength, they couldn't withstand the attack!</p><p>What kind of realm has this person reached?</p><p>“Presumptuous!” The clone stepped forward, each step blooming a lotus, the sound of water echoing through the void.</p><p>From afar, it was quite impressive.</p><p>After refining the Nine Heavens Chaotic Golden Lotus, his cultivation was no weaker than Zhang Xuan’s.</p><p>He unleashed a punch, the force surging towards the heavens.</p><p>He clashed with the ruthless cultivator and was similarly sent flying, unable to withstand a single blow.</p><p>Zhang Xuan clutched his forehead.</p><p>Even after becoming an Emperor, his clone still hadn’t given up showing off…</p><p>Such ostentatious displays were less effective than concentrating power for greater impact!</p><p>“Attack together, or we’ll all die if they die…”</p><p>Little Yellow Chicken roared, red flames burning, igniting the sky.</p><p>The remaining six Emperors also unleashed their abilities.</p><p>The combined might of seven Emperors was earth-shattering, capable of destroying a world, but against the ruthless cultivator who absorbed special energy, the black hole enlarged in an instant, swallowing the attack and retaliating immediately.</p><p>*Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!*</p><p>The seven Emperors, like Zhang Xuan and the others, were sent flying.</p><p>Even the combined power of ten Emperors couldn't withstand a single attack!</p><p>How could this person be so powerful?</p><p>“You may die now…”</p><p>After defeating everyone with one move, the ruthless cultivator stepped forward, their wrist flipped, ready to strike again.</p><p>“You dare!”</p><p>With a loud shout, the elder from Sword God Heaven suddenly appeared, blocking the attack, his sword transforming into a silver river.</p><p>“An Emperor? He’s also an Emperor?”</p><p>Zhang Xuan's pupils constricted.</p><p>He had assumed the elder was merely a follower, at most a God King, but his power revealed him to be an Emperor!</p><p>If he was an Emperor, then what was the young man?</p><p>“He is an Emperor of Sword God Heaven…” Luo Ruoxi said, gritting her teeth as she struggled to stand.</p><p>“Then…the young man who taught me swordsmanship?” Zhang Xuan couldn’t contain his curiosity.</p><p>“He is…” Luo Ruoxi was about to answer when space twisted, and they saw the Emperor of Sword God Heaven sent flying, crashing into the ground, creating a large crater.</p><p>Even Zhang Xuan, with his superior strength and understanding of the sword dao, couldn't withstand him; even with his powerful cultivation and superb swordsmanship, he was still no match.</p><p>"Haha, Emperor! They're just a pack of weaklings! Today, I'll destroy the Nine Heavens, destroy this divine realm, and crush all its rules!"</p><p>The ruthless one laughed maniacally after defeating the Emperor of Sword Heaven.  The surrounding space continued to collapse, making him seem demonic and monstrous.</p><p>"What do we do?" Zhang Xuan clenched his fists.</p><p>He and his clone had unleashed their strongest attacks, and even Luo Ruoxi had used her most powerful technique, yet they couldn't withstand a single blow…</p><p>Could it be that no one in the divine realm could stop this person?</p><p>Just let him destroy the world?</p><p>"The only way… is to return your flawed Heavenly Dao to its whole, allowing the Heavenly Dao to suppress him…" Luo Ruoxi clenched her fists, her eyes reddening.</p><p>"Return it to its whole?" Zhang Xuan understood her meaning.</p><p>The library in his mind was part of the Heavenly Dao. Once it returned, the Heavenly Dao would be completely whole, perhaps repairing the flaw and expelling the ruthless one.</p><p>Like a human's immune system.</p><p>A complete immune system easily fights off viruses; a broken one can't resist viral invasion, and even the strongest person will die.</p><p>But…</p><p>"He's too strong. Even if the Heavenly Dao is restored, it won't be able to suppress him!" Zhang Xuan shook his head.</p><p>The immune system can kill viruses, but… a tiger?</p><p>What good is even the strongest immune system against that?</p><p>This person, a mere ordinary God King, even with a title, could easily be killed by the Heavenly Dao, yet he is stronger than the Emperor… beyond the Heavenly Dao's ability to contend with.</p><p>"This…" Luo Ruoxi paused, a look of dejection on her fair face. "Yes… we can't suppress him, but with the Heavenly Dao complete, he can awaken, and killing this one won't be difficult!"</p><p>"He?" Zhang Xuan frowned.</p><p>"I'll take you to him, in Zizai Heaven…" Taking a deep breath, Luo Ruoxi gritted her teeth, turning and flying forward.</p><p>"Trying to escape?" The ruthless one sneered, pushing downwards.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Luo Ruoxi fell from the sky.</p><p>"You…" Zhang Xuan unleashed his swordsmanship again, his sword intent blazing.</p><p>Clang! Clang! Clang!</p><p>He was stopped again by the ruthless one.</p><p>"Go! I'll hold him off…"</p><p>Knowing they were looking for a way to save the divine realm, not escape, the clone and the Undying Emperor shouted, blocking in front, while Luo Qiqi transformed back into her Jingkong Pearl form.</p><p>The surrounding space solidified.</p><p>"Go!"</p><p>Seeing everyone selflessly blocking behind them, fearless of death, Zhang Xuan's eyes reddened.  Knowing there wasn't time to talk, he pulled Luo Ruoxi, his body flickering as he tore through space, appearing moments later within the range of Zizai Heaven.</p><p>Zizai Heaven no longer held its former serenity; the divine realm was collapsing, chaos reigning everywhere.</p><p>"Where's the person you mentioned?"</p><p>Having no time to observe the lives of ordinary people, Zhang Xuan looked at the girl in his arms.</p><p>If this person could truly save the divine realm, what did his sacrifice matter!</p><p>"He's my father. The blood in your pendant is his. The Undying Emperor was once his pet beast…" Luo Ruoxi took a breath, explaining.</p><p>"Father?"</p><p>Zhang Xuan suddenly understood.</p><p>No wonder he'd always felt the blood in the pendant was similar to Luo Ruoxi's, yet different. It belonged to her father.</p><p>That also explained why the Undying Emperor's remaining consciousness recognized him as its master upon seeing the pendant.</p><p>"Your father is also an Emperor? Or possesses power beyond an Emperor?"</p><p>He couldn't help but ask.</p><p>The library's chaos was cleared by the blood in the pendant, allowing him to regain clarity. Could it be that not only is she an Emperor's daughter, but her father is also one, perhaps even stronger?</p><p>If so, why was he unconscious?</p><p>Why did his awakening require the flawed Heavenly Dao?</p><p>"He isn't an Emperor. He is… the Heavenly Dao!"</p><p>Luo Ruoxi clenched her fists.</p><p>"The Heavenly Dao? Your father… is the Heavenly Dao?" Zhang Xuan was shocked, disbelieving.</p><p>"Yes! Fifty years ago, Father couldn't withstand that great hand, falling into a coma. The Heavenly Dao scattered into three parts: the Ordered Heavenly Dao and the Flawed Heavenly Dao, falling into spatial currents. I control the Natural Heavenly Dao, maintaining the balance of the divine realm. To restore him, I need to gather the scattered parts… That's why I'm so resolute, I can't fail! That's why I specifically entered the Master's Continent, researched the Spring and Autumn Annals, trying to defeat Master Kong!  When fighting Master Kong, that's what I asked for his help with."</p><p>Luo Ruoxi said.</p><p>Zhang Xuan suddenly understood.</p><p>They'd met not long ago on Master's Continent, and the girl had told him her story, about saving a close relative. He didn't understand then, but now he finally realized.</p><p>It was her father, and he was the Heavenly Dao of the divine realm!</p><p>Could the Heavenly Dao really take human form and have children?</p><p>"Controlling the Natural Heavenly Dao… you don't have fragments of the Heavenly Dao in you?" Suddenly realizing an inconsistency in her words, Zhang Xuan looked at her.</p><p>Controlling from outside and merging with it are two different concepts.</p><p>"I merely control it; I'm not a part of Heaven's Will…" Luo Ruoxi said.</p><p>Zhang Xuan breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p>This meant he only needed to separate the flawed Heaven's Will from her, not kill her.  He didn't want to accept this fate, but he also didn't want the girl to be harmed.</p><p>"If I separate the flawed Heaven's Will within me, your father will live, and you can even kill the Ruthless One, right?" Zhang Xuan asked.</p><p>"That… I'm not sure…"</p><p>Looking up at the collapsed divine realm, Luo Ruoxi hesitated.  The divine realm was her father's foundation.  Even if he awoke, could he really defeat such a powerful foe with it in this state?  It was hard to say.</p><p>"It seems you can't be certain either.  If so, we'll have to rely on ourselves… We'll have to find our own way!" Zhang Xuan gritted his teeth.  "You, me, my clones, along with the Nine Heavens Nine Emperors, and if we can also get Master Kong… we might have a chance of winning!"</p><p>"Master Kong? He…" Luo Ruoxi frowned.</p><p>"Master Kong is dead, you say! He wasn't truly dead. If I'm not mistaken, his apparent death at your hands was just a way to escape Heaven's Will…  He's probably like Wei Changfeng, a 'Primordial Soul Body'!"</p><p>Zhang Xuan explained.  Seeing Wei Changfeng had given him the answer. Master Kong’s ability to maintain his intelligence was likely due to being a Primordial Soul Body, allowing him to remain lucid even before birth.  With the preparation he made in advance, his resurrection was just a matter of time.</p><p>Luo Ruoxi was stunned; she hadn't expected this.</p><p>"Let's go see. If I'm right, he should have already recovered. Otherwise, his students wouldn't have stayed away from the Tidal Sea…" Zhang Xuan said.</p><p>Master Kong's students, Zi Yuan Gu Sheng and the others, were all incredibly powerful.  Even without the help of an Emperor, they would certainly have found a way to enter the Tidal Sea, yet none of them had.  There must have been something more important for them to do, something they wanted to accomplish while all the Emperors were preoccupied with the Tidal Sea! And that important task was clearly Master Kong's recovery.</p><p>"This…" Luo Ruoxi's heart trembled; she suddenly understood.</p><p>"Let's go!"</p><p>Without further explanation, with a sweep of his hand, Zhang Xuan reappeared at Master Kong's residence, and sure enough, he saw an old man levitating cross-legged in the air.  Seeing them arrive, he smiled slightly: "You've come!"</p><p>If it wasn't Master Kong, then who else could it be?  This venerable master had indeed not let him down!  Just as he had guessed, he had resurrected while everyone's attention was focused on the Tidal Sea.</p><p>"You…" Luo Ruoxi trembled.</p><p>She knew Emperors could be resurrected—even the Immortal Emperors had been revived—but… she hadn’t expected it to be this fast!</p><p>"I concealed myself from Heaven's Will and prepared a backup plan in advance. That nameless giant in the Ghostly Soul Pool was my doing. When you killed it, I used the opportunity to break free from Heaven's Will's shackles and recondense my physical body. I've only just now fully recovered!"</p><p>Master Kong chuckled.  He was skilled in time manipulation. While it seemed like only a day or two had passed in the divine realm, he had actually spent an unknown amount of time recovering his strength. Decades, perhaps.</p><p>"The three of us are very strong, but defeating the Ruthless One won't be easy…"</p><p>Seeing Master Kong's actual recovery, Luo Ruoxi still shook her head.  It wasn't about being overly modest or lacking confidence; it was a matter of fact.  Even with so many people working together before, they hadn't been able to stop the opponent.  Even with Master Kong added, what difference would it make? It wouldn't change the situation!</p><p>"Individually, or even combined, we are no match for the opponent. But… what if we were to merge everyone's power into a single person?"</p><p>Master Kong looked at them with a smile.</p><p>"Merge into one person?"</p><p>This time, not only Luo Ruoxi frowned, but Zhang Xuan was also puzzled.</p><p>"That hand that tore apart the divine realm and scattered Heaven's Will… its power was undeniable.  The Ruthless One absorbed all that power and devoured fifty years' worth of the divine realm's spiritual energy.  In terms of raw power, any one of us Emperors wouldn't stand a chance…"</p><p>Master Kong explained:  "But if we combined forces, focusing them on a single individual… that might be different."</p><p>"How do we concentrate it?"</p><p>Luo Ruoxi asked.  It sounded simple, but doing it would be difficult.  The Emperors were already at the peak of the divine realm. If absorbing others' power were that easy, she wouldn't have stagnated for so many years.</p><p>"It's simple… we'll focus all our power onto Zhang Xuan. If he can break through the Emperor's barrier, he can save the divine realm!"</p><p>Master Kong stated.</p><p>“Me?” Zhang Xuan was startled. “Why me?”</p><p>“The Lingxi Emperor cultivates freedom and transcendence! But with the constraints of his father and Heaven’s Will, with those he cares about, he can never truly transcend! If I’m not mistaken, during our battle, you also gave up, intending to be killed by me!”</p><p>Kong Shi said.</p><p>Luo Ruoxi was speechless.</p><p>During the battle, she had indeed considered this, so their initial exchange was more like sparring than a life-or-death struggle.</p><p>“Unable to transcend, naturally one cannot unleash their strongest power. Even with more true energy, one cannot break through to the highest realm! As for me…”</p><p>Kong Shi nodded.  “I yearn to save all beings, to enlighten the world, but I don't want others to sacrifice for me. Too much compassion is also a flaw! If I had been ruthless, and annihilated the Yiling race, the situation wouldn't be like this…”</p><p>If the Yiling people had been completely exterminated, the ruthless one wouldn't have been resurrected, and the present situation wouldn't exist.</p><p>“Therefore, I'm not suitable either! But Zhang Xuan, his cultivation method is harmonious, without flaws. He values living his own way, even if it means death, as long as he lives without regret, his heart is at peace. Such a person possesses greater tolerance and greater potential for growth. Only then can he go higher and farther!”</p><p>Kong Shi continued.</p><p>To live is to return, to die is to long for each other!</p><p>One who doesn't fear death, wouldn't be bound by anything else.</p><p>“This…” Zhang Xuan frowned, about to speak, when he saw Kong Shi’s intense gaze. “Don’t refuse. Even if we had time to train others, I don’t believe anyone could do it better. While the Lingxi Emperor doesn’t possess a Heaven’s Will fragment, he has long controlled Heaven’s Will and has his own unique understanding of it; I control the orderly Heaven’s Will. If we infuse our power into you, you will possess the complete power of Heaven’s Will! Combined with the Nine Heavens Chaotic Golden Lotus of your clone, you can completely stabilize the nine heavens, control the universe, battle the nine skies, and destroy all things!”</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Seeing the decision made, Zhang Xuan nodded; further explanation would be futile.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>He sat cross-legged, and in the blink of an eye, two powerful forces surged from both sides.</p><p>Zhang Xuan stiffened, feeling as though he had instantly transformed into Heaven's Will, soaring above the nine heavens.</p><p>His soul, body, and true energy were instantly cleansed, becoming stronger and more powerful.</p><p>…</p><p>“You also want to stop me? Fine, I'll kill you, then go kill Zhang Xuan…”</p><p>After sending Luo Qiqi and his clone flying, the ruthless one sneered coldly.</p><p>The combined power of the clone and numerous Emperors was indeed formidable, but it was still weaker than his.</p><p>The Tidal Sea had consumed almost all the spiritual energy outside the city in the Divine Realm.  Now, this power nourished him; every move he made carried the power to destroy the world.  These Emperors and God Kings, though representing the peak of the Divine Realm, were no match for him.</p><p>The ruthless one now seemed to represent the entire Divine Realm, unstoppable.</p><p>“With the Divine Realm destroyed, our lives are meaningless. I, Yun Chi, will perish with you…”</p><p>Yun Chi the Great transformed into his true form, a giant five-clawed golden dragon, charging towards him.</p><p>“You?  Not worthy!”</p><p>The ruthless one squeezed his hand, and the golden dragon was trapped in his palm, unable to escape.</p><p>“Old friend, wait for me!”</p><p>Fu Meng the Great roared, transforming into his white tiger form, soaring into the air.</p><p>The Immortal Emperor, his immortal fire phoenix true form blazing across the sky.</p><p>Xuan Ming the Great, his true form a giant tortoise, seemingly supporting the heavens.</p><p>The four divine beasts, guardians of the four cardinal directions of the Divine Realm, simultaneously transformed, slowing the collapse of the Divine Realm.</p><p>Time seemed to freeze.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>With four consecutive strikes, the ruthless one suppressed the four beasts. A fierce killing intent flashed in his eyes: “Since you seek death, I shall grant it…”</p><p>As he roared and was about to kill them all, he felt his raised arm stiffen, halting mid-air.</p><p>“Want to kill them?  Ask me first…”</p><p>Then, to the shocked gazes of everyone, a figure slowly walked down from the sky.</p><p>It was Zhang Xuan!</p><p>The young man, now overflowing with power, ten times stronger than before, descended from the heavens, appearing like a world unto himself.</p><p>“Improved quite a bit…”</p><p>The ruthless one stopped, his gaze serious.  He clearly didn't understand how the other party's strength had changed so drastically in just a few minutes.</p><p>“But what does it matter? Even the Divine Realm in its prime couldn't withstand me. I don't believe you can stop me…”</p><p>With a cold snort, the ruthless one struck again.</p><p>Zhang Xuan raised his sword to meet him.</p><p>Their battle tore apart space, sending air currents flying in all directions.</p><p>Could Zhang Xuan win?</p><p>Luo Ruoxi, at the Kong Shi base, watched anxiously.</p><p>She and Kong Shi had transferred their power to Zhang Xuan, reducing their own cultivation to the God King level, no longer as glorious as before.  However, their level remained, and with sufficient power, they could eventually recover.</p><p>“With his current strength, victory is…difficult! Unless…he can grasp power beyond the Emperor Jun level!” Kong Shi said after a moment of silence.</p><p>Even a dozen Emperor Juns combined couldn't defeat the Ruthless One. Even transferring all their power wouldn’t guarantee victory.  They did this because only by concentrating power in one person is there a chance to reach the peak, to truly transcend limits and break through!</p><p>“Power beyond the Emperor Jun level?” Luo Ruoxi’s gaze drifted far away.</p><p>Her father, when still alive, had spoken of the same thing, but…she couldn't achieve it. Could her beloved man?</p><p>“He will…He has an indomitable spirit! And a proud defiance of this world.” Kong Shi smiled, seeing her doubts.</p><p>…</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>After several consecutive blows, Zhang Xuan’s knuckles cracked, and a huge, gruesome wound appeared on his chest. As Kong Shi said, even with their combined power forming a complete Heavenly Dao within him, he was still no match.</p><p>“Haha, I thought you were powerful, but you're nothing!” The Ruthless One sneered.</p><p>“I'm no match for you anyway, I'll be killed sooner or later.  Since that's the case, I want to die under your strongest attack…” Taking a deep breath, Zhang Xuan stopped attacking and looked at the Ruthless One.</p><p>“Fine, I'll grant you that, my strongest attack…”</p><p>Hearing this, the Ruthless One paused, then snorted coldly, raising a hand.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>A green light appeared in his palm and slammed down.</p><p>It was indeed his strongest attack. The entire divine realm roared as if it couldn't bear the impact, another huge crater appearing.</p><p>Zhang Xuan, eyes closed, didn't dodge.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>His head exploded, his soul scattering.</p><p>“Zhang Xuan…” Everyone's face turned pale at this sight.</p><p>Luo Qiq was beside herself.</p><p>Yun Chi Dadi and the others widened their eyes, trembling uncontrollably.</p><p>Kong Shi and Luo Ruoxi were also stunned.  Their intention was for him to break through his shackles, to reach a level beyond the Emperor Jun realm. Why didn't he resist, willingly accepting death?  Was this not a betrayal of their kindness?</p><p>“No, it's the Immortal Emperor's immortal method…”</p><p>Kong Shi suddenly spoke, noticing something.</p><p>Everyone then saw that though Zhang Xuan's head had exploded and his soul shattered, the pendant on his chest suddenly burst, a drop of blood floating and igniting into a blazing flame. From the flame, a perfectly intact figure slowly emerged.</p><p>“He…used the opponent's power, and the blood in the pendant, to separate the flawed Heavenly Dao and his soul?” Luo Ruoxi’s pupils constricted.</p><p>The reborn Zhang Xuan had no Heavenly Dao Library in his body, no Heavenly Dao interference—he was free from the Heavenly Dao!</p><p>“How did he do that?” Kong Shi was equally incredulous.</p><p>The Heavenly Dao and soul are normally fused together inseparably. To escape, one must usually shatter the soul and recondense it in a place like the Netherworld Soul Pool.  This one, after only a single killing blow, had completely escaped. What method did he use?</p><p>“I understand…He used the Ruthless One's method of breaking the soul contract…” Luo Ruoxi realized.</p><p>A soul contract binds master and servant; unless the master releases it, the servant remains bound…the Heavenly Dao Library is similar, an enhanced version of the contract. Bound to the soul, one cannot escape without dying.  However, the Ruthless One used a special power to break the soul contract. Zhang Xuan had inquired about the specific method beforehand, likely formulating his plan then.  He intentionally risked death, allowing the Ruthless One to unleash his strongest attack. Using that power, he was reborn, and it worked spectacularly!</p><p>“So that's it, this is the method to surpass the Emperor Jun realm…”</p><p>Zhang Xuan, emerging from the flames, smiled faintly, as if he understood something. He beckoned, and his separated clone immediately transformed into a lotus flower and flew towards him, merging perfectly with his body. In an instant, everyone felt that Zhang Xuan had become the Nine Heavens, the Nine Heavens being him.  He lightly tapped his foot on the ground. The chaotic Nine Heavens instantly stabilized.</p><p>The Nine Heavens Chaotic Golden Lotus, born at the dawn of the Nine Heavens, stabilized the realm.  With its power fully integrated into himself, Zhang Xuan had achieved perfect harmony between his self and his clone; he now completely controlled this immense strength.</p><p>Not only that, but the cultivation base enhanced by the Lotus had reached its peak, now poised on the brink of a breakthrough.</p><p>“Master-servant bond, brotherly love, teacher-student bond, parental love, romantic love…  merged together, they are all things in the world.  This is what it means to be human!”</p><p>Zhang Xuan murmured, a smile on his face.  The moment the Heavenly Dao Library separated from his soul, he understood.</p><p>Does humanity perceive the world, thus creating it, or did the world exist first, before humanity?  Is it the wind moving, or the heart?</p><p>This question, age-old and unanswerable, has plagued countless souls.  But now…none of that matters!</p><p>Without life, without emotion, what is the meaning of a world's existence?  Therefore, after transcending romantic love, he reached the realm of universal love, a love encompassing the entire world.</p><p>Everything in the universe possesses emotion; emotion creates the world, emotion sustains life.</p><p>Love is emotion.</p><p>Hate is emotion.</p><p>Joy is emotion.</p><p>Suffering is emotion.</p><p>Parting is emotion.</p><p>Reunion is emotion!</p><p>“All emotions, now at my command…”</p><p>With a low cry, the barrier confining Zhang Xuan’s cultivation shattered.  The Emperor's shackles were broken!</p><p>In an instant, he touched a completely new world, a new door opening before him. His soul was rapidly nourished.  Countless chaotic energies surged towards him, his physical body rapidly strengthening.  Before, he could only progress by absorbing spiritual energy, but now, spatial turbulence, chaotic energy, even the opponent's emerald light—all became his to command.</p><p>“You…” The Ruthless One, never expecting that her all-out attack not only failed to kill him but actually propelled his advancement, let out a furious roar and launched another attack.</p><p>“Your resentment towards the high and mighty Emperors for not saving you in the spatial turbulence is emotion; your feelings of humiliation and anger as my former servant are emotion; your desire to destroy the Divine Realm to vent your fury is emotion; your desire to become stronger is also emotion… Emotion controls you. How can you possibly defeat me, how can you avoid my control?”</p><p>With a faint smile, Zhang Xuan’s voice grew increasingly faster and louder.  With a gentle grasp of his hand, the once invincible Ruthless One was bound by countless threads of emotion, immobilized, helpless.</p><p>Every emotion, every feeling, would be used, would be controlled, by him.</p><p>“You…”  Terror filled the Ruthless One's eyes. “Master Zhang, I was your servant! Don’t kill me… I will offer my soul as a sacrifice…”</p><p>“It’s too late for that now…”  Zhang Xuan smiled faintly, shaking his head.  Controlling the emotions of the world rendered the status of a servant meaningless.  After killing so many god-level beings, hurting his girlfriend, Luo Qiqi, and so many friends, how could he possibly forgive her today?</p><p>“No…”  Sensing his resolve, the Ruthless One’s pupils constricted. Before she could finish speaking, a violent pain wracked her body.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>In an instant, she exploded, transforming into countless wisps of spiritual energy that poured into every corner of the Divine Realm.  The power previously absorbed by the Tidal Sea was now returned, revitalizing the parched wasteland.</p><p>“What…”</p><p>“She’s… dead?”</p><p>The Cloud Dragon Emperor, the Immortal Emperor, Linglong Fairy, and others stared in disbelief.  They had clashed with the Ruthless One and knew her terrifying power. Such a formidable being, vanquished so easily?  What realm had Zhang Xuan reached?</p><p>Could there truly be a realm beyond that of the Emperors?</p><p>“He succeeded…” Kong Shi and Luo Ruoxi unclenched their fists.</p><p>“This is a fragment of the Heavenly Dao.  Now, I shall return it…”</p><p>Seeing the “Incomplete Heavenly Dao,” which had been separated from his body, still floating in the air, Zhang Xuan smiled softly and flicked his finger.</p><p>*Hum!*</p><p>The library, his constant companion since his rebirth, crashed into the Divine Realm's sky.</p><p>A bell-like resonance echoed.  The crumbling Divine Realm visibly began to slowly recover; the chaotic currents gradually coalesced. The collapse of the Divine Realm finally halted; the depleted spiritual energy, along with the Ruthless One's death, slowly revived.</p><p>“It seems the Divine Realm is about to usher in a new era of spiritual revival…” Zhang Xuan smiled.  The chasm left by the Tidal Sea, with the Heavenly Dao restored, would heal; the Divine Realm would regain its former glory—it was only a matter of time.</p><p>“Zhang Xuan, come over here…”</p><p>A voice echoed in his mind, startling Zhang Xuan.  He took a step forward.  This step carried him an immeasurable distance, revealing a young man standing before him.  It was the one who had taught him swordsmanship.</p><p>“Senior, you…”  Zhang Xuan stared, speechless.</p><p>I had always suspected this man was incredibly powerful, but now I realize he’s only a hair's breadth away from my own level. He's reached the absolute peak of the Emperor Realm, surpassing Luo Ruoxi by a vast margin.</p><p>"Just call me by my name.  I am... Nie Tong!" The young man, radiating an unstoppable sword intent, said calmly.</p><p>"Nie Tong?" Zhang Xuan frowned.  He had never heard this name before.</p><p>"Come with me. I'll take you to see my brother!" The young man, Nie Tong, smiled gently and strode forward.</p><p>Zhang Xuan followed closely behind.  After an unfathomable distance, they stopped before a mountain peak.  There, he saw another young man.</p><p>His appearance wasn't much different from Nie Tong's, but his raised eyebrows gave him a deep, unreadable air.</p><p>"This power..." Zhang Xuan shuddered.  The young man's strength was even greater than his own; he too had broken through the Emperor Realm barrier, his cultivation far deeper and more profound!</p><p>"I am Nie Yun," the young man said with a faint smile, his gaze falling upon Zhang Xuan.  "And I am... Nie Lingxi's father, the one you know as Luo Ruoxi's father."</p><p>"Ruoxi's father?" Zhang Xuan was stunned. "You... are the Heavenly Dao of the God Realm?"</p><p>Luo Ruoxi had mentioned that her father was the Heavenly Dao. He never imagined it would be such a young man.</p><p>"I underwent the Three Pure Ones transformation.  Part of my soul became the Heavenly Dao! Besides, I created this world, so calling me the Heavenly Dao isn't inaccurate," Nie Yun smiled lightly.</p><p>Zhang Xuan couldn't believe it.  This man had created the God Realm?  How powerful must he be?</p><p>"But if you created the God Realm and are the Heavenly Dao, why did you allow the villains to wreak havoc without intervening...?" Zhang Xuan questioned.</p><p>If he hadn't broken through, the God Realm might have completely collapsed.  Why did this man remain indifferent?  Did he even care about his daughter's life or death?</p><p>Without answering his question, Nie Yun looked at him calmly: "Do you believe... that there are even more powerful beings above the God Realm?"</p><p>"That..." Zhang Xuan hesitated. "Probably..."</p><p>He had never encountered them, but since he could reach this level, perhaps others could too, even stronger ones. Like the one before him.</p><p>"I once suspected the existence of more powerful beings above the God Realm, so I used all my strength to probe, ultimately provoking a backlash from a higher realm... a hand descended from the void!"</p><p>Nie Yun continued, "If I had dodged, the entire God Realm would likely have been obliterated, leaving not a single life... So I blocked that attack, but as a result, the Heavenly Dao aspect of myself was split."</p><p>"Restoring myself is merely a matter of thought, but... I understand that to truly transcend the God Realm's constraints, to explore the origin of that hand and what lies beyond the God Realm... it's difficult to do alone.  Therefore, I wanted to see if any being could break through the Emperor Realm barrier and reach a level equal to my own!"</p><p>"So I sent the scattered fragments of the Heavenly Dao's will to the lowest realm... bestowing them upon souls originally belonging to this world, and one soul that didn't. And you, ultimately, did not disappoint me!"</p><p>Nie Yun laughed.</p><p>"A soul not from this world?  So my reincarnation was also your doing?" Zhang Xuan was shocked.</p><p>No wonder he had been able to transmigrate.  It was all this man's work.</p><p>"Hehe!" Nie Yun chuckled. "Those inherently from this world have an innate reverence for it, making it much harder to break free. It was a whim on my part, and I didn't expect you to actually succeed..."</p><p>"I..." Zhang Xuan blushed. "Without Kong Shi's selfless dedication, I would never have reached this level..."</p><p>Without Kong Shi's sacrifice, attaining his current level would have been impossible.</p><p>"I gave him the opportunity, but he didn't seize it.  His fight with Lingxi was the perfect chance for his breakthrough, but he chose to retreat. He thought he had a backup plan, that he could escape unscathed, but he actually lost the drive to push forward. When facing someone who surpasses us, if one lacks this spirit, how can they possibly contend?"</p><p>Nie Yun stated.</p><p>Zhang Xuan remained silent. He had witnessed the battle between the two; Kong Shi had indeed lacked decisiveness.</p><p>Perhaps he didn't want to kill Luo Ruoxi.  Sadly, that single thought cost him the chance for advancement.</p><p>"If Kong Shi had won, Ruoxi would have died..." After a moment, Zhang Xuan looked up, his brows furrowed.</p><p>Could it be that this man didn't even care about his daughter's life or death?</p><p>"With me here, she wouldn't have died," Nie Yun smiled faintly. "Your strength is almost on par with mine now. Do you think, at the moment of life and death, you could save someone given their combined power?"</p><p>"That..." Zhang Xuan chuckled wryly.</p><p>The Emperor's breakthrough and the Emperor himself are two different concepts. If he were willing to intervene, he could certainly save the person at the last moment, ensuring they wouldn't suffer a single scratch.</p><p>"Lingxi is my other wife, Luo Qingcheng's daughter, so her alias uses the Luo surname... To make her believe, and prevent emotional interference, she still thinks I'm in a coma..."</p><p>Nie Yun chuckled wryly: "I guess I've been a pretty ruthless father...  Let you explain this to her.  Her affections are already focused on you, and she's probably forgotten all about her old dad... Haha, I'll disappear for a while. Otherwise, I'm afraid she'll make a huge fuss..."</p><p>Zhang Xuan's face twitched at his unreliable father's words. "Alright..." he agreed.</p><p>He couldn't really refuse. After all, he had taken his daughter away…</p><p>"The Heavenly Dao Library is a manifestation of my will, both my foundation and my constraint. You've managed to break through that constraint through your own abilities, showcasing your talent and potential. Your future is limitless. As her father, I’m relieved she's with you."</p><p>(Please refresh the page for updates.)</p>
