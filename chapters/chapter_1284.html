Chapter 1276: The Transmission of the Law

Soon, the alliance of the two regions sent back a message, requesting the patriarchs of each sect to lead their forces swiftly to the Celestial March Plateau to organize a counterattack. Qing Jun was currently reorganizing his forces. For this decisive battle, the two regions would mobilize their entire strength, and the great army would march toward the Celestial March Plateau.

Meanwhile, Qin Sang, accompanied by Jing Yu, first headed to the Thousand Bamboo Sea.

At the Thousand Bamboo Sea, the demonic beasts had already received the news and were waiting outside the valley. The white cat, upon learning that the master would be bringing a demon king back to the mountain, stood meticulously beside the Willow Demon, her round face tense and her almond-shaped eyes wide open, fearing she might lose decorum in front of the demon king.

The fat chicken, glancing sideways at the white crane beside it, was seething with anger, cursing inwardly. The white crane, deliberately flirting with Yue'er in front of it, was laughing heartily, carelessly sidling up to the fat chicken. Extending a wing, it wrapped it around the fat chicken, its face full of envy, and said boldly, "I didn’t expect you, fat chicken, to be telling the truth! You’re really the descendant of a demon king! You’ve made it big now, don’t forget your old buddy! I’ll have Yue'er bring over her sisters, and you can pick whoever you want. Having three wives and four concubines is no big deal!"

"My name is Chi Lei!" the fat chicken roared in anger.

Yue'er, with a hint of jealousy, pinched the white crane and whispered sweetly, "Do you also want three wives and four concubines?"

"My heart belongs only to you, as the heavens can testify. How could I ever have eyes for any other little demoness?" the white crane replied without hesitation, its expression unchanged.

Yue'er blushed with sweet embarrassment.

The white crane sighed inwardly. There was no helping it—Yue'er was under the protection of the Snake King, and its own master didn’t show it any favoritism. It couldn’t hit or scold her. Fortunately, its smooth-talking nature kept Yue'er as sweet as honey, so it didn’t suffer much. In fact, it enjoyed plenty of tenderness. The only downside was that Yue'er clung to it so tightly that it couldn’t go out and enjoy itself freely, which was rather stifling.

The fat chicken, well aware of the white crane’s nature, sneered, "You can keep them for yourself. I’m not blessed enough to enjoy such things."

Just as they were speaking, Qin Sang and Jing Yu quietly appeared before them.

Jing Yu, having overheard the white crane’s earlier words, was intrigued. "If you know any virtuous and kind-hearted individuals, you can bring them over. If you can find a good match for Little Fatty, I’ll be sure to thank you properly."

The fat chicken was horrified.

Inside the cave abode, Qin Sang introduced Jing Yu to the demonic beasts, explaining that she would stay at the Thousand Bamboo Sea to cultivate from now on. Jing Yu agreed that, if she had spare time, she wouldn’t hesitate to offer guidance. The demonic beasts were overjoyed.

After the demonic beasts had met Jing Yu, Qin Sang kept the Willow Demon, the Old Horse Monkey, the white cat, the fat chicken, and the white crane behind. He took out several jade slips.

"Take a look at this cultivation technique first," Qin Sang said, handing one of the slips to Jing Yu.

The jade slip contained the first four layers of the *Heavenly Demon Refinement Form*. After the counterattack against the Sin Abyss, everything would return to normal. These demonic beasts were trustworthy, so Qin Sang had chosen them to pass down the *Heavenly Demon Refinement Form*, ensuring that this technique wouldn’t be lost with him.

The Willow Demon, being a plant spirit, couldn’t cultivate the *Heavenly Demon Refinement Form*, but it could still gain some insights from it.

Upon receiving the *Heavenly Demon Refinement Form*, the demonic beasts were instantly struck with awe, completely absorbed in its profundity.

Jing Yu was the first to awaken from her trance, her eyes filled with astonishment. "This technique must have been a true inheritance of a great clan in ancient times. Fellow Daoist, you’ve actually obtained the complete first four layers! Unfortunately, I’ve already delved too deeply into my own clan’s inheritance and can’t switch to this technique. However, the *Heavenly Demon Refinement Form* will still be of great benefit to me. After some time of contemplation, I’m sure I’ll gain something. Thank you, Fellow Daoist Qin!"

"Are the top inheritances of the demon race also incomplete?" Qin Sang asked in return.

Jing Yu nodded. "Mostly so. My clan’s inheritance was derived from a fragment of an ancient demonic technique by a brilliant ancestor. It has been passed down through generations and gradually perfected."

The demonic beasts of the Little Cold Region were in a similar situation. The top inheritances of humans, witches, and demons were all fragmented.

Qin Sang pondered this.

After a while, the demonic beasts finally regained their senses, filled with gratitude toward Qin Sang. They all bowed in unison, saying, "We thank the Great King for the grace of transmitting this law."

"Rise. From now on, the Thousand Bamboo Sea and the Green Goat Temple are both my descendants, with no distinction between them. Remember, there must be no prejudice between races, or else trouble will arise, and I will not be lenient!" Qin Sang waved his sleeve and spoke gravely. "The law cannot be lightly transmitted. The Thousand Bamboo Sea must establish a few rules…"

That night, Qin Sang led the demonic beasts to the Celestial March Plateau.

Jing Yu remained at the Thousand Bamboo Sea to enter seclusion. However, she needed time to contemplate the technique and wasn’t in a hurry to take medicinal pills for a breakthrough. Once the great battle began, she could join the fight at any time.

…

At the Celestial March Plateau, within the Ice Crystal Palace, the Nascent Soul cultivators had gathered.

The moment Qin Sang entered the hall, all eyes turned toward him.

"Fellow Daoist Qin has finally arrived!" Daoist Zhenyi personally rose to greet him, his eyes shining with admiration. "I’ve always envied the demon race for having a Moonlight Demon King. Now I know it’s actually a young talent from our human race!"

Qin Sang modestly waved off the praise and clasped his hands in greeting to the Nascent Soul cultivators present.

Everyone returned the gesture, and this marked the true beginning of their acquaintance.

His seat was arranged next to Qing Jun.

Qin Sang glanced around and noticed that the seating was rather chaotic. It seemed Daoist Zhenyi was somewhat unprepared for the sudden rise of him and Qing Jun and, fearing potential conflicts, had decided not to follow the usual seating order.

This disappointed some of the more gossipy individuals. They were very interested in the feud between Qin Sang and Dongyang Bo, but both men were too cunning to show any signs of it. If they had clashed over seating and started a fight, it would have been quite a spectacle.

Once everyone had arrived, Daoist Zhenyi sealed the Ice Crystal Palace with a barrier and, with a serious expression, began discussing the main agenda.

"Old Devil Ye and Tianzheng Old Ghost have been severely injured, and with the addition of Fellow Daoist Leng and Fellow Daoist Qin as powerful reinforcements, this is the perfect opportunity for a counterattack. According to the investigations conducted by Fellow Daoist Tongyou and myself, the Sin Abyss has already begun consolidating its forces and shows signs of retreat. We cannot let them withdraw so easily! Once the army is assembled, we will divide into three routes. Fellow Daoist Tongyou and Dongyang will lead one route, Fellow Daoist Leng and Qin will lead another, and I, along with Brother Jinjia, will lead the third…"

The counterattack plan had already been agreed upon by all parties, so there was no need for further discussion. Daoist Zhenyi directly laid out the arrangements.

The three route commanders were all top-tier experts from the two regions, and no one disputed their authority.

"I’ve already contacted our allies in the desert. When the time comes, they will also strike with full force to divert part of the Sin Abyss’s strength. The three armies will advance simultaneously, driving the Sin Abyss back to the Heavenly Scar in one fell swoop! Fellow Daoist Chifa was ambushed by Old Devil Ye, leading to his severe injuries and eventual demise during his heavenly tribulation. In this decisive battle, we will avenge him and make the Sin Abyss pay in blood!"

Daoist Zhenyi slammed the table and shouted.

The Nascent Soul cultivators were invigorated. After being suppressed by the Sin Abyss for so many years, they could finally strike back and vent their pent-up frustrations.

When Daoist Zhenyi mentioned Chifa Ancestor, a man and a woman among the Nascent Soul cultivators exchanged glances, both snorting coldly with expressions of disgust.

They were the two disciples of Chifa Ancestor.

After Chifa Ancestor’s death, the two had become estranged, leading to the split of the Pure Yang Sect, the largest sect in the Little Cold Region. Every time they met, it was the same—they treated each other as mortal enemies.

At this point, someone noticed that Daoist Zhenyi hadn’t mentioned the demon race.

"Daoist, have you contacted the Feather Demon King? What are the plans of the Heavenly Demon Hills?"
