<h1>Chapter 756: Lurking</h1><p>Sword Qi burst forth from his body.</p><p>After taking the medicinal pill, Qin Sang's complexion visibly improved.</p><p>He looked at his Golden Radiance Armor. Several dents marred its surface, rendering it nearly useless. He stored it away and donned a Dharma robe.</p><p>Then, he checked the condition of the Night Fiend.</p><p>The Night Fiend was riddled with holes, barely clinging to life.</p><p>A moment later, Qin Sang withdrew his divine sense, letting out a sigh of relief. The Night Fiend's injuries looked horrific, but luckily, none were fatal.</p><p>The Two-Headed Vulture cleared a path for them.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced back; Cui Ji had vanished.</p><p>He still felt some resentment. He had risked both his Golden Radiance Armor and the Night Fiend, resisting the urge to unleash the Two-Headed Vulture even at the most perilous moment, hoping to lure the enemy deeper.  But the explosion had ruined his plan.</p><p>As long as Cui Ji lived, Qin Sang would feel a prickling unease.</p><p>However, now he had the advantage of stealth.</p><p>He looked ahead, controlling his spirit sword, and coordinating with the Two-Headed Vulture.</p><p>They chose a different direction. The battlefield was utter chaos. Cui Ji certainly wouldn't expect Qin Sang to not only be alive but also have the strength to break through the encirclement.</p><p>The battle raged.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't see what lay ahead, only charging forward in a fixed direction.</p><p>Later, he noticed other ferocious beasts around him, but far fewer than the Violet Star Eagles. It seemed only the eagles had been intentionally driven here; the rest were drawn by the scent of blood.</p><p>"Finally, a breather."</p><p>Qin Sang cleaved a beast in two with his sword.</p><p>The beasts relentlessly pursued him. Qin Sang surveyed his surroundings, finding nothing unusual. He then recalled the Two-Headed Vulture, concealed his aura, and went into hiding.</p><p>With the Poison Warding Armor, Qin Sang didn't need to expend his True Essence for protection.</p><p>He lurked in the shadows, holding his breath, carefully dodging and avoiding the beasts' gazes as they circled relentlessly, with more constantly pouring in from the periphery.</p><p>Without something like the Bone Lotus or the Poison Warding Armor, even the strongest cultivator would be worn down and killed here.</p><p>Having lost Qin Sang's trail, the beasts abandoned their pursuit and joined the chaotic fray.</p><p>The battlefield was no longer just Violet Star Eagles hunting cultivators.  As more beasts arrived, driven mad by the bloodlust, they attacked indiscriminately, seeing only targets for slaughter.</p><p>The area had become a gruesome abattoir, rivers of blood staining the earth crimson. It was impossible to know when the carnage would end.</p><p>Finally, Qin Sang escaped the beasts, standing at the edge of the battlefield.  Blood flowed beneath his feet. The frenzied roars of the beasts still echoed, filling him with lingering fear.</p><p>He remained there, not immediately retreating from the Purple Mist Forbidden Zone. He turned towards the stone hall, his expression flickering.</p><p>Having broken through the siege, his energy reserves were still relatively full. He was reluctant to leave just yet.</p><p>Cui Ji believed him dead. This was his opportunity.</p><p>After a moment of contemplation, Qin Sang quietly approached the stone hall.</p><p>Cui Ji was most likely in one of two places: the stone hall or the site of the explosion. The two were not far apart.</p><p>He carefully avoided the beasts and the battlefield, soon discovering that the stone hall was surrounded by beasts, while the explosion site seemed less chaotic.</p><p>Halfway there, Qin Sang's hand closed around three Ten Kings Yama Banners.</p><p>Once he struck, it would be with thunderous force, giving his opponent no chance to breathe.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>Ahead, several Violet Star Eagles were attacking a grey wolf.  Their massive wings beat furiously as they swooped and dove. The wolf, bathed in yellow light, stood its ground, covered in wounds, yet refusing to flee.</p><p>The chaotic battle stirred the purple mist.  As Qin Sang stealthily approached, he caught a glimpse of two figures. He froze, his expression shifting slightly.</p><p>The wolf let out a mournful howl as the Violet Star Eagles shattered its spine and devoured it, leaving only a skeleton in moments.</p><p>The purple mist closed in.  Qin Sang clenched his fist and silently moved closer, mentally calculating the distance as he lurked near the two figures. Despite the cover of the mist, he dared not approach too closely, fearing an unexpected encounter.</p><p>If he wasn't mistaken, one of them was Cui Ji.</p><p>The other was unexpected: Xiang Yi!</p><p>He had assumed Xiang Yi was dead, murdered, his Bone Lotus stolen.  This fleeting glimpse revealed both Xiang Yi and Cui Ji holding a Bone Lotus.</p><p>Qin Sang was utterly astonished. Xiang Yi and Cui Ji were working together, both members of the Merchant Alliance.  No wonder Cui Ji had been so brazen, daring to kill during the chaos.</p><p>These two old foxes hadn't revealed a single clue along the way!</p><p>Qin Sang seethed with resentment and curiosity.</p><p>Were Xiang Yi and Cui Ji the masterminds behind the beast attack?  If it was the Merchant Alliance's doing, what was their purpose?</p><p>They were minor players, not core members of the alliance.  Killing them wouldn't require such elaborate measures.</p><p>Qin Sang frowned, recalling the scene he had just witnessed.</p><p>Beside where Xiang Yi and Cui Ji stood was a large crater, not present when they had cleared the area around the stone hall. It must have been caused by the explosion.</p><p>"There's something lying motionless at the edge of the crater.  It's that subterranean beast.  Looks like it's dead."</p><p>Unable to get closer, Qin Sang could only make out its silhouette. However, the beast's features were distinctive enough for him to recognize it easily.</p><p>"Wait, there's also someone, or rather a body, lying at their feet.  It looks like only the upper half remains..."</p><p>Qin Sang frowned, a spark of realization igniting in his mind.</p><p>"It's him!"</p><p>The cultivator with the half-mask, surnamed Pan!</p><p>Just then, Qin Sang heard the sounds of a clash in the distance. Someone was fighting their way towards them.  He retreated further.</p><p>Soon, Qin Sang heard Xiang Yi's icy voice, "Fellow Daoist An, you're late."</p><p>The purple mist churned.</p><p>A richly dressed, portly man broke through the encircling beasts and emerged, gasping for breath. After regaining his composure, he glanced at Cui Ji, frowning.  "Cui Ji, you called for me to investigate the others, claiming you would deal with Daoist Qing Feng alone. Did you not consult Fellow Daoist Xiang before acting?"</p><p>Cui Ji gave a sheepish smile and shook his head. He began to explain but stopped short, shivering and paling at Xiang Yi's furious glare.</p><p>"You dared to kill Daoist Qing Feng without authorization! I warned you to wait until our mission was complete before acting as you pleased. Did you treat my words as empty air?"</p><p>Xiang Yi glared at Cui Ji, his voice sharp with anger.</p><p>Cui Ji shrank back, murmuring in his defense, "Fellow Daoist Xiang, you saw how potent his escape technique is. Even without exerting his full strength, he could keep pace with you. When he went all out, his speed was the fastest I've seen from any Core Formation cultivator. If we had failed, he could have easily shaken us off and escaped. The poisonous mist and the Violet Star Eagles hindered his escape technique. It was a golden opportunity..."</p>
