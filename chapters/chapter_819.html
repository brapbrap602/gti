<h1>Chapter 811: The Pursuit</h1><p>Turtle Island was covered in peach trees, their blossoms perpetually in bloom.  The island's protective formation was linked to the peach grove, possessing both illusory and lethal aspects, making it incredibly powerful.</p><p>Whenever Senior Qingzhu gave a sermon, people were allowed to land on the island, but only on the outer beaches.</p><p>Senior Qingzhu resided deep within the peach grove; no one had ever seen his true face.</p><p>Qin Sang learned all this from Sect Master Wu.</p><p>On his way to Eight Sect Island, Qin Sang donned a hooded cloak, altering his appearance.  The enemies who could defeat even Senior Qingzhu could crush him like an ant.</p><p>Yet, Qin Sang was reluctant to simply leave.</p><p>He couldn't shake the feeling that something wasn't right.</p><p>Senior Qingzhu had found a teleportation formation but abandoned his return to Xiaohan Realm at the last moment. This time, shortly after reopening Seven Kills Hall, Senior Qingzhu, who had been in hiding for two hundred years, was found by his enemies and attacked.</p><p>These events seemed somehow connected.</p><p>The attackers might not have been his old enemies!</p><p>Perhaps Senior Qingzhu had been careless and his secret discovered.</p><p>At the same time, Qin Sang recalled his fall from the Heavenly Tower and his subsequent awakening in the Wu Clan Continent. Was it truly the restriction within Seven Kills Hall that had transported him?</p><p>Qin Sang felt as if he were near a massive whirlpool, though it hadn't yet pulled him in. He couldn't sense the turbulent waves, much like the current sea, shrouded in mist.</p><p>He had a premonition that if he followed Senior Qingzhu's path and searched for the teleportation formation, he too would eventually be swept into the vortex.  A chill ran down Qin Sang's spine.  He needed to ascertain the identity of Senior Qingzhu's enemies, to know who to guard against.</p><p>After flying for some time, Qin Sang saw the outline of Eight Sect Island through the fog.</p><p>Instead of landing, he changed direction and flew towards Turtle Island.</p><p>He bypassed Eight Sect Island and flew for a while longer. Ahead lay a scattering of reefs and uninhabited islands.  Beyond these lay Turtle Island.</p><p>Qin Sang flew back and forth over the area, but couldn't find Turtle Island.  He then realized that the portion of Turtle Island above sea level had been destroyed, leaving only its foundation submerged beneath the waves.</p><p>…</p><p>Though small, Eight Sect Island was well-developed; in fact, it was quite large.</p><p>According to Sect Master Wu, in addition to the Vast Sea Sect, there were dozens of other factions of varying sizes on Eight Sect Island, their influence intertwined and complex.</p><p>At the center of the island was a city where cultivators and mortals lived together without strict regulations.</p><p>Qin Sang landed on the island and flew for a while, crossing mountains and valleys, until he reached the city nestled in a basin. Sect Master Wu hadn't witnessed the battle firsthand, so Qin Sang had to search for eyewitnesses in the city.</p><p>Disguising himself as a Foundation Establishment cultivator, he easily blended into the city.</p><p>The recent storm and sea mist had enveloped the entire island, leaving the streets sparsely populated and somewhat desolate. However, as Qin Sang passed through several streets and arrived at the cultivator's market, the atmosphere became lively.</p><p>This was the largest market in the surrounding waters.</p><p>Qin Sang strolled through the market, occasionally entering shops to purchase trinkets, casually inquiring about the master of Turtle Island.  He eventually found a shopkeeper who had witnessed the battle.</p><p>The shopkeeper, also a Foundation Establishment cultivator, was elderly and had no hope of further advancement.</p><p>“I happened to be returning from visiting a friend.  As I neared Eight Sect Island, I heard a thunderous roar.  Turning around, I saw a radiant glow and towering waves emanating from Turtle Island. The tremors even reached here, causing the tide to surge…”</p><p>The old shopkeeper recounted the scene.  “I thought some treasure had appeared, so I immediately flew towards the glow. Unexpectedly, it was Turtle Island under attack.  Both sides were incredibly powerful. We nearly died just getting close.  I vaguely saw several figures within the glow, besieging Turtle Island. Even so, the battle lasted for half a day, showing that we had underestimated the island master's strength. He must have been at least a Nascent Soul Patriarch. After that, all the factions, including the Vast Sea Sect, were glad they hadn't provoked the master of Turtle Island.”</p><p>With a look of regret, the shopkeeper continued, “To think, a Nascent Soul Patriarch was living right beside us, hidden for over two hundred years without anyone knowing.  Such an opportunity, yet no one grasped it.  Had I known, I would have knelt at the island every day, begging for his guidance.”</p><p>Qin Sang sat across from the shopkeeper, listening to his story, piecing together the events of that day.</p><p>At the end of the battle, someone within the radiant light had laughed maniacally.</p><p>The formation was broken, Turtle Island was destroyed, and no one escaped.</p><p>The attackers, having destroyed the island, departed without further incident.  By the time onlookers approached, Turtle Island was submerged beneath the sea.</p><p>“Is Senior Qingzhu truly gone?”</p><p>Hearing the shopkeeper confirm the outcome, Qin Sang felt a sense of disbelief.  The seniors he admired most weren't Nascent Soul Patriarchs like Lord Dongyang, but Wandering Scholar Yun and Qingzhu.</p><p>He had never met Qingzhu, but throughout his journey, he had heard countless legends about him.</p><p>Cultivating the same "Soul-Nourishing Sword Scripture," Qin Sang understood the terrible pain Senior Qingzhu must have endured without the Jade Buddha's protection. Yet, despite splitting his Nascent Soul, he not only persevered but also rose to prominence, becoming the fastest disciple in Shaohua Mountain's history to reach Foundation Establishment!</p><p>Despite the incomplete scripture, he didn't give up and even created two killer talismans, reaching the peak of the late stage.</p><p>Senior Qingzhu, enraged by the death of his beloved, split a mountain and entered a dragon's lair to slay his enemies, eventually forced into exile. He was a true swordsman who lived life to the fullest.</p><p>Who wouldn't admire such a peerless swordsman?</p><p>To die so silently, besieged by enemies…</p><p>Leaving the shop, Qin Sang gazed towards where Turtle Island once stood, lamenting the unpredictability of life.</p><p>Beyond this, Qin Sang found no clues about the attackers.  They had come solely for Senior Qingzhu, destroying Turtle Island before leaving without harming anyone else.</p><p>Qin Sang planned to rent a cave in the market and stay for a while, hoping to find some trace of them.</p><p>While walking down the street, searching for accommodation, Qin Sang's eyes suddenly flickered.  He casually turned into an alley, changing his mind and heading straight for the city gates.</p><p>After Qin Sang left, two figures also emerged, stealthily tailing him.</p><p>One tall, one short, both wore robes with wave-like patterns.  They followed Qin Sang out of the city and watched as he used movement techniques to swiftly enter the forest.  Exchanging glances, they said in unison, “After him!”</p><p>“Junior Brother, did you find out who this person is?”</p><p>The taller cultivator asked.</p><p>The shorter cultivator shook his head. “No, I asked the shopkeepers. He claims to be from out of town, wanting to become a disciple of the master of Turtle Island. That's ancient history. Judging by his aura, he's probably just reached Foundation Establishment.  He's likely not the person Master told us to watch out for, no need to report back to the sect. Let's just kill him and take his belongings.”</p><p>“Huh, he's quite fast.”</p><p>They pursued him into the dense forest, losing sight of their target.</p><p>Suddenly, a calm voice came from behind, “Are you two looking for me?”</p>
