<h1>Chapter 378: Blood Rain</h1><p>Walking within the fractured barrier, iridescent lights shimmered everywhere, as if they were walking through a rainbow.  These rainbows, however, represented danger. Qin Sang followed Yun Youzi closely, cautiously navigating the fissure, careful not to make any sudden movements.  The fissure itself wasn't entirely safe. The map marked dangerous areas, allowing them to prepare accordingly.</p><p>Upon reaching the fissure's exit, Yun Youzi turned back. Qin Sang, understanding the unspoken command, activated his magical tool, concealing himself in the shadows as he watched Yun Youzi proceed.  An ambush within the fissure was impossible. Unless an attacker was confident in a one-hit kill, even the slightest leak of spiritual energy, upon touching the ancient barrier, could trigger a devastating counterattack.  Any potential ambushers would be positioned at the exit.</p><p>Qin Sang waited.  Yun Youzi returned shortly after, confirming the area was clear, and then they exited the fissure.</p><p>The second level of Boundless Valley appeared similar to the first. The blood-red clouds hung even lower, creating an oppressive atmosphere.  The horizon was dotted with shimmering lights and mists of various hues, marking clearly dangerous areas, more numerous and concentrated than in the first level.</p><p>……</p><p>The barren stone ridge was composed entirely of piled white rocks, devoid of vegetation. Similar ridges dotted the surrounding landscape, resembling protruding burial mounds in a desolate scene.</p><p>Yun Youzi stood on the ridge, his breath slightly ragged, but instead of meditating, he scanned the distance, a hint of worry in his eyes. Qin Sang was nowhere to be seen.</p><p>Suddenly, Yun Youzi's eyes lit up.  A distant sword light, like a meteor, streaked across the sky, swiftly landing near the stone ridge. Qin Sang's slightly disheveled figure appeared.</p><p>"Brother Qin, are you alright? Are you injured?"</p><p>Qin Sang, having arrived on his flying sword, steadied himself, took a few breaths, and shook his head. "Those Shade Beasts are truly troublesome. Fortunately, you drew most of them away."</p><p>They were now deep within the second level of Boundless Valley. Following the map, their journey had been smooth initially, but the markings grew vague further in, filled with speculation, requiring them to rely on their own judgment, which inevitably led to danger.</p><p>Fortunately, their cultivation was high, and they remained vigilant, escaping every peril. This last encounter was the most dangerous. They had inadvertently stumbled into a Shade Beast nest. Caught off guard, they were separated by the surging beasts and agreed to meet at a designated location, each fleeing on their own.</p><p>Once alone, Qin Sang was able to fight more freely. Unleashing his Animated Corpse and the Ten Yama Formation, he eliminated a group of Shade Beasts.  Discovering they left nothing behind upon death but Yin energy, he didn't linger, hurrying to the rendezvous point.</p><p>"It's good that you're alright, Brother Qin."  Yun Youzi nodded, relieved, and surveyed the area. "This White Stone Wasteland is just as I remember it. From here, three hundred miles east is the edge of the third level, the Inner Valley.  If those two demon groups haven't been disturbed, the path I took before should still be there."</p><p>Before departing, Qin Sang glanced back to the left. The dark abyss where the Flood Dragon dwelled was directly north of this wasteland.</p><p>Half a day later, Qin Sang and Yun Youzi stood before a vast mountain range. Towering peaks stretched endlessly, their summits touching the blood-red clouds.  Layers of ancient barriers shimmered on the mountains and in the valleys, leaving no gaps, a sight that made their scalps crawl.</p><p>"Brother Qin, this is the barrier to the third level of Boundless Valley!"</p><p>Yun Youzi pondered for a moment, then flew to a valley, scrutinizing it for a while. A smile spread across his face. "Excellent!  The barrier hasn't changed in decades, and it remains undiscovered!"</p><p>Qin Sang followed, his face paling at the sight.  He forced a chuckle. "You don't intend to cross through *this*, do you?"</p><p>Before them was a valley bathed in 'blood rain'. Not actual rain, but countless crimson threads of light, densely packed, filling the entire valley.  These seemingly delicate threads exuded an aura of extreme danger.</p><p>Qin Sang knew instinctively that these were manifestations of the ancient barrier, each as sharp as the finest blade. He had no doubt that entering the valley would result in his body being instantly riddled with holes, his Seven-Colored Umbrella offering no protection.  He had assumed Yun Youzi had found a weakness in the barrier. Could they really force their way through?</p><p>Yun Youzi glanced at Qin Sang, smiling. "Don't be deceived by appearances, Brother Qin.  This barrier may appear dangerous, but eroded by time, like the shimmering lights at the edge of the second level, its power has waned, creating weaknesses. However, this barrier hasn't weakened as much, so the flaws are invisible to the naked eye. Watch..."</p><p>Yun Youzi opened his palm, and spiritual energy formed a sparrow, which chirped as it flew towards the valley.  Nearing the blood rain, the sparrow paused. After a few moments, Yun Youzi urged, "Go!"</p><p>The sparrow flew into the blood rain, triggering an immediate reaction. The rain seemed to be drawn towards the sparrow, threatening to shred it.  But instead, the threads passed harmlessly through the sparrow, leaving it unharmed.</p><p>Qin Sang watched in astonishment as the sparrow flew through the blood rain, completely unscathed, reaching the other side of the valley. The blood rain was like an illusion.</p><p>Yun Youzi dispersed the sparrow, smiling. "The barrier remains unchanged, following the same pattern.  The opening isn't always there, but appears for a brief moment every so often. Follow me closely, Brother Qin.  If we time it right, there's nothing to worry about."</p><p>Seeing Yun Youzi's confidence and having witnessed the sparrow's passage, Qin Sang's worries dissipated.  He summoned his Ebony Sword and stood beside Yun Youzi.</p><p>Yun Youzi stared intently at the blood rain, motionless.  Time passed slowly.  After fifteen minutes, he suddenly barked, "Now!"</p><p>Yun Youzi ascended on his sword, rushing into the blood rain at the same point the sparrow had entered.  Qin Sang followed closely behind.</p><p>The instant he entered the blood rain, Qin Sang felt the threads converging on him from all directions, his vigilance peaking.  He quickly realized they were indeed harmless, feeling no impact, and relaxed, keeping close to Yun Youzi.</p><p>Yun Youzi moved like lightning, his path not a straight line, but a winding, intricate route. It was hard to imagine anyone daring enough to chart such a course through the deadly blood rain.</p><p>They had traveled deep into the valley when Yun Youzi abruptly stopped.  Qin Sang reacted instantly, halting his sword, noticing they had emerged from the blood rain.  Before them was a cave.</p>
