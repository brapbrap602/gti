<h1>Chapter 1327: The Time Approaches</h1><p>Having spoken, Qin Sang ignored the others and began to lecture.</p><p>The mountain quickly returned to calm, only Qin Sang's tranquil voice slowly carrying on.</p><p>Initially, Qin Sang's lecture was quite elementary, understandable even to Qi Condensation disciples.</p><p>They had previously worried that a Nascent Soul Grandmaster's lecture would be too profound, initially just coming to join the fun, but unexpectedly found themselves gaining something, and all listened attentively.</p><p>Foundation Establishment and Golden Core cultivators, seeing that the esteemed Nascent Soul Grandmaster was actually expounding at length on such low-level content, and that it was an unorthodox topic related to artifact refinement, some grew impatient.</p><p>Naturally, they dared not act rashly in front of a Nascent Soul cultivator, only daring to mutter inwardly.</p><p>While their minds wandered, some noticed that several cultivators of the same level were listening with rapt attention, and it didn't seem feigned.</p><p>Realizing they might have overlooked something, these cultivators quickly focused their minds.</p><p>They then discovered that those seemingly shallow topics, which they thought they had long since mastered, actually contained unimaginable subtleties.  Qin Sang, in just a few words, opened a new world for them.</p><p>Magical artifacts, treasure artifacts…</p><p>Qin Sang lectured layer by layer.</p><p>His artifact refinement techniques, a fusion of Canglang Sea and Xu Ling Sect styles, formed their own unique system.</p><p>Many cultivators, because of their initial negligence, found themselves increasingly unable to understand later on, hearing it like heavenly scriptures, and were gently pushed off the mountain by a soft force.  Only then did they realize what they had missed, regretting it immensely.</p><p>By the end, only Qin Sang, Qing Jun, Bing Han, and Jing Yu remained on the mountain.</p><p>All of them wore thoughtful expressions, patiently listening to Qin Sang until the end, and then spoke out, engaging Qin Sang in a discussion.</p><p>This discussion, not limited to the art of artifact refinement, lasted seven days and seven nights.</p><p>Lower-level disciples, looking up at the mountaintop, could see the four figures sitting around a stone platform, yet couldn't hear a sound.</p><p>Mist swirled, like immortals among the clouds.</p><p>……</p><p>Two years later.</p><p>Peach Blossom Valley.</p><p>The mist parted, revealing three figures: Qin Sang, Qing Jun, and Bai.</p><p>Qing Jun took out a sound transmission talisman.  "The Dark Abyss Demon Lord sent a message; they've gone ahead and asked us to meet at Yuanxu."</p><p>Bai said apologetically, "I delayed things. I wanted to cultivate a secret technique, and it took longer than expected."</p><p>"Brother Bai's cultivation is the most important thing. The Immortal Gate hasn't opened yet; it makes no difference whether we go sooner or later,"</p><p>Qin Sang looked west, calculating the time. "Daoist Jing Yu should be arriving soon."</p><p>Before he finished speaking, a sudden bolt of lightning flashed across the distant horizon and instantly appeared before the three.</p><p>After exchanging greetings, they immediately set off.</p><p>Bai remembered something and said, "I should hide for now, to avoid unnecessary explanations if we meet others along the way."</p><p>With that, he vanished into Qin Sang's Corpse Puppet bag.</p><p>Qin Sang had the same intention.</p><p>Their purpose was to go to Yuanxu to prepare for entering the Immortal Gate.</p><p>Barring any unforeseen circumstances, the Ziwei Palace was expected to appear soon.</p><p>This exploration of the Ziwei Palace was fraught with uncertainty.</p><p>Bai was his biggest trump card, and it was best to keep him hidden for as long as possible.</p><p>For this expedition to the Ziwei Palace, cultivators below the Nascent Soul stage were excluded.</p><p>Other Nascent Soul cultivators from the Little Cold Region had already left. They were a few days late waiting for Bai's breakthrough.</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't sure how strong Bai had become.</p><p>For Bai, the greatest hurdle was the advancement to Corpse King, which he had already overcome, making the rest relatively easy.</p><p>However, since it had only been twenty years, he probably wouldn't be overly powerful.</p><p>The three flew swiftly, encountering Nascent Soul cultivators from the Heavenly Walk League upon entering the grassland, and they travelled together.</p><p>Yuanxu Mist Sea.</p><p>Numerous figures, in groups of two or three, floated around the Seven Waters Maze Formation.</p><p>True Daoist and several others gathered together, periodically looking towards the swirling mist, seemingly discussing something.</p><p>Qin Sang and the others arrived and were immediately greeted there.</p><p>Qin Sang looked around; they were the last to arrive.  Nascent Soul cultivators from the Northern Star Region had received the news early and arrived beforehand.</p><p>Ye Lao Mo's conspiracy and the Ziwei Palace's anomaly were incredibly attractive, and almost everyone was present unless they had unavoidable circumstances.</p><p>"The three Daoists have finally arrived.  Real Person, would you please reiterate the plan...?"</p><p>True Daoist said.</p><p>Qin Sang and the others looked intently at Cang Hong Real Person.</p><p>"Within the Sinful God Palace, there are three forbidden areas containing ancient secrets.  These are places the Sinful Abyss has always wanted to explore, and they might also be Ye Lao Mo's targets, so we can't ignore them.  I've carefully considered it, and we'll split into three teams to head directly to these three forbidden areas. If we find Ye Lao Mo, we'll encircle and kill him within the Ziwei Palace.  If he's not in those three places, we'll quickly converge at the entrance to the Ziwei Palace. This won't take too much time. Additionally, Qiu Zhi Xianzi and several other Daoists will remain outside to guard the Seven Waters Maze Formation, preventing Ye Lao Mo from escaping…"</p><p>True Daoist lightly tapped the void, and a wisp of mist transformed into a map of the Sinful God Palace.</p><p>The terrain within the Sinful God Palace was extremely complex, filled with dangerous restrictions far more treacherous than the inner chambers of the Ziwei Palace.</p><p>Master Zhen and the others, though having heard the plan once, listened intently again.</p><p>Grandmaster Cang Hong pointed out three forbidden zones, located in three different directions of the Sinful God Palace.  If everyone investigated them one by one, it would waste a lot of time; the best approach was to split up.</p><p>This carried some risk, and they made every effort to overestimate Ye Laomo's strength.</p><p>However, everyone had prepared thoroughly for this mission.  If they encountered him, they should be able to hold their own for a while, giving them time to call for reinforcements.</p><p>"I and Master Zhen will go to the left forbidden zone," Cang Hong said, "Fellow Daoist Tongyou and the Feather King will go to the right one, and Daoist Qin, you and Daoist Lu will go to this one.  What do you think?"</p><p>He gestured to the forbidden zone located in the center of the Sinful Abyss.</p><p>Qin Sang and the other two offered no immediate opinion, instead asking about the dangers within each zone and how they could be certain Ye Laomo was even there.</p><p>Grandmaster Cang Hong answered all their questions.</p><p>Qin Sang and Qing Jun communicated telepathically.  The three forbidden zones presented similar dangers; it made little difference which they chose; their main concern was Ye Laomo.</p><p>Then, Cang Hong pointed towards the depths of the Sinful God Palace, to the passage leading to the Purple Star Palace.  "We suspect Ye Laomo's most likely goal is the Purple Star Palace," he explained.  "But he's likely already inside. We can't possibly be faster than him. We'll have to search for him slowly once we enter the Purple Star Palace.  Ye Laomo's ambitions are vast; any action he takes will surely show signs."</p><p>Demon Lord Tongyou added, "The inner palace of the Purple Star Palace seems stable, less dangerous than the Sinful God Palace.  In truth, most forbidden zones are far beyond what we Yuan Ying cultivators can explore alone.  Ye Laomo's options are limited.  He forcibly entered Heavenly Mountain last time; it's highly probable he'll go there again this time…"</p><p>Seeing that everyone had considered the situation carefully, Qin Sang and Qing Jun said no more, accepting the assignment.  They joined Lu Boyuan and other fellow Yuan Ying cultivators to discuss their next steps.</p><p>With the imminent emergence of the Purple Star Palace, the Abyssal Ruins trembled even more violently; the fog sea was in chaos, with turbulent currents everywhere.</p><p>Cultivators below the Yuan Ying stage would struggle to survive here without protection.</p><p>As time passed, a few more Yuan Ying cultivators arrived.</p><p>Everyone silently watched the vortex, awaiting the opening of the celestial gate!</p>
