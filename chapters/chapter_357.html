<h1>Chapter 350: Dissipating Cultivation</h1><p>Feng Cang Market.</p><p>Tan Hao anxiously waited in a courtyard, afraid of disrupting Qin Sang's plan, so he dared not act rashly.</p><p>Suddenly, the gate was pushed open.</p><p>Tan Hao stood up abruptly. Seeing Qin Sang enter, his hanging heart finally settled. He anxiously asked, "Brother Qin, how did it go?"</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, saying, "Liang Yan has been killed by me. Quickly go save Shi Hong, senior apprentice-sister."</p><p>He had already used the "Soul-Seizing Curse" to learn the secrets of Liang Yan's cave's restrictions.</p><p>The two immediately went up the mountain. After entering the small courtyard, they opened the restrictions on Shi Hong's room.</p><p>"Who's there!"</p><p>Shi Hong was awakened, noticing something amiss. She quickly took out her magic weapon for protection, but then saw Tan Hao at the door. She was greatly surprised, her face showing an expression of utter astonishment.</p><p>"Junior Brother Tan, how are you here? Liang Yan, he…"</p><p>"Senior Apprentice-Sister Shi Hong, Liang Yan is dead!"</p><p>Tan Hao blurted out this shocking news.</p><p>Shi Hong's mouth fell open, her face full of disbelief.</p><p>Liang Yan was still alive just a short while ago. Less than two hours after leaving, Tan Hao suddenly appeared, telling her that the villain was dead. How was that possible?</p><p>"Thanks to Brother Qin!"</p><p>Tan Hao stepped aside.</p><p>Qin Sang walked in, looking at Shi Hong with a sigh.</p><p>#Get 888 cash bonus# Follow the vx. public account 【Book Friend Base Camp】, read popular masterpieces, and draw 888 cash bonuses!</p><p>The once youthful and proud Shi Hong, senior apprentice-sister, had changed drastically. Her brows were filled with an unyielding sorrow and weariness.</p><p>Time, like flowing water, destroys so much beauty.</p><p>"Senior Apprentice-Sister Shi Hong, long time no see…"</p><p>…</p><p>Outside Yin Mountain Pass.</p><p>In Tan Hao's cave.</p><p>Shi Hong sat cross-legged on the stone bed, still feeling that it was all unreal.</p><p>The demon that had been controlling her was killed, the biggest threat removed.</p><p>Her expression was somewhat relaxed, but far from joyful, unusually complex.</p><p>Gradually, her eyes began to redden, two lines of tears sliding down her cheeks onto the stone bed.</p><p>The tears flowed faster and faster. Shi Hong suddenly covered her mouth, but the emotion could not be suppressed, and she wept loudly…</p><p>Now, Shi Hong's energy was even weaker than before, her cultivation only at the second level of Qi Condensation!</p><p>After leaving Feng Cang Market and explaining the situation to Shi Hong, Qin Sang also explained the details of the Yama Banner to Shi Hong and asked her opinion: whether to retain her current cultivation or dissipate it and cultivate anew.</p><p>At the tenth level of cultivation, one would inevitably be devoured by the Yama King. Only by dissipating one's cultivation and starting over could Shi Hong completely escape the Yama Banner and reach higher realms.</p><p>But at Shi Hong's age, even with exceptional talent, she would almost have no hope of reaching the Foundation Establishment stage in this lifetime.</p><p>Even reaching the eighth level of Qi Condensation again would be difficult.  In this process, Shi Hong would suffer much hardship, and even if she lived to the end of her lifespan, she might not reach her current level.</p><p>Yun Youzi was an exception; not everyone could compare to him.</p><p>Retaining her cultivation meant remaining threatened by the Yama Banner, unable to improve, only treading water. But returning home, enjoying wealth, marrying, and having children—at least she could have a stable life for the rest of her days, far richer than an ordinary person's.</p><p>Shi Hong almost didn't hesitate, resolutely saying to Qin Sang, "I want to dissipate my cultivation! What can I do going back? Besides cultivation, I don't know anything. Besides, my parents and relatives are already dead, I have no one… I'd rather die on the path of cultivation, and die without regrets!"</p><p>Facing Shi Hong's resolute gaze, Qin Sang sighed.</p><p>Shi Hong was the most talented among their four fellow disciples. If she hadn't fallen into the Devil Sect, she might have already touched the edge of the False Core stage, but fate dealt her this cruel blow.</p><p>At Shi Hong's insistence, Qin Sang protected her while she dissipated her cultivation, finally escaping the Yama Banner.</p><p>The moment the dissipation was complete, Qin Sang used all his strength to restore Shi Hong's nearly collapsing dantian, but could only restore her to this level.</p><p>Second level of Qi Condensation!</p><p>Only slightly stronger than a cultivator who had just stepped onto the immortal path. Years of hard work were destroyed in an instant.</p><p>"I'm about to go south… I wonder where senior apprentice-sister plans to cultivate? If senior apprentice-sister wants to return near your hometown, I can escort you along the way," Qin Sang asked.</p><p>Shi Hong came to her senses, wiped away her tears, and hesitated.</p><p>Her cultivation was now too weak. In the dangerous Ancient Immortal Battlefield, she could die at any time. In the heart of the Xiao Han Domain, it would be safer.</p><p>But only the Ancient Immortal Battlefield had abundant cultivation resources, leaving her a glimmer of hope.</p><p>Tan Hao suddenly spoke, "Without Shijie's help, Tan Jie and I wouldn't have made it this far, and wouldn't have met Qin Xiong.  If Shijie is willing, perhaps you could stay. This cave dwelling is secluded enough; you could cultivate here without disturbance.  Now Tan Jie no longer needs to consume spirit medicines, and I have some ability to protect myself. As long as I'm here, Shijie doesn't need to worry about cultivation, and this gives me a chance to repay your kindness."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded silently. He had helped them out of a sense of past obligation, but he couldn't keep them with him indefinitely, nor did he have the ability to do so.</p><p>Tan Hao's offer to repay Shi Hong was ideal.</p><p>Shi Hong's cultivation level was still low, so even if she needed pills and other things, they wouldn't be very precious.  With Tan Hao's current cultivation, he could easily support their cultivation.</p><p>After Tan Hao's earnest persuasion, Shi Hong hesitated for a moment, then finally agreed.</p><p>"In that case, I should be going…"</p><p>Qin Sang chuckled, speaking lightly.  This was all he could do; the future of the Tan brothers and Shi Hong was in their own hands.</p><p>He had been in Yin Shan Guan for over a month.  After returning to the sect, he would likely stay for a while to handle sect affairs, so as not to miss his appointment with Yun Youzi. He needed to leave soon.</p><p>Let's not dwell on Tan Hao and Shi Hong's gratitude and pleas for him to stay.</p><p>The three of them left the cave together. Qin Sang turned and bowed to them, saying, "Shijie, Tan Xiong, may we meet again someday!"</p><p>Qin Sang summoned his You Luo Cloud and was about to ascend when Shi Hong stopped him.</p><p>He turned to look at her.</p><p>"Qin Shixiong…"</p><p>Shi Hong gazed at Qin Sang, her lips moving slightly as she spoke four words.</p><p>"May you become a Celestial!"</p><p>Short, yet powerful.</p><p>Qin Sang was momentarily stunned, but nodded silently. He turned and stepped onto the You Luo Cloud, soaring into the clouds and disappearing into the sky.</p><p>Tan Hao and Shi Hong watched until the light of his departure completely vanished.</p><p>…</p><p>Flying through the air on the You Luo Cloud, Qin Sang remained somewhat pensive.</p><p>For cultivators, wishing a fellow cultivator to become a Celestial is perhaps the best blessing, isn't it?</p><p>But, is becoming a Celestial so easy?</p><p>Qin Sang urged the You Luo Cloud to the top of the cloud layer, looked up at the boundless sky, and remained silent for a long time.</p><p>The You Luo Cloud was extremely fast, quickly flying beyond the clouds. Qin Sang withdrew his gaze. To avoid trouble, he concealed his aura and flew quietly.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang seemed to remember something and looked down at his storage pouch.</p>
