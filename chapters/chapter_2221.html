<h1>Chapter 2211: Day and Night Alternate</h1><p>The giant eye of the demonic python’s phantom blazed like a burning furnace.  Flames erupted from its body, casting the surroundings in a fiery red glow.</p><p>Crimson light filled the sky, illuminating the terrifying figure of the demonic python phantom.</p><p>The giant serpent let out a deafening roar, its body writhing.  The malevolent gleam in its eyes intensified, the pupils burning like embers.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>Columns of fire erupted from the ground.</p><p>The demonic python phantom’s mountainous body was engulfed in flames, its flesh visibly melting away in the intense heat.</p><p>“Swish!”</p><p>The demonic python’s gaze, a look of cold fury, pierced the heavens, its terrifying presence filling the air.</p><p>Qin Sang’s true energy wavered, the glassy azure light dimming slightly.</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>The flames the serpent had previously spewed, seemingly infused with the demonic python’s gaze, suddenly exploded, their power far exceeding Qin Sang’s expectations.</p><p>The fire raged, consuming everything in its path.  Qin Sang and Liu Li were almost swallowed by the inferno.  The demonic fire’s power was unlike anything Qin Sang had encountered before; his previous experience with fire was no match for this.</p><p>“Whoosh!”</p><p>A streak of gray light shot out, heading towards the flames.  Nothing could impede its progress; it was unstoppable.</p><p>Taking advantage of the distraction, Qin Sang and Liu Li retreated, creating distance.</p><p>He looked up, meeting the demonic python phantom’s gaze, a mixture of awe and determination in his eyes.  He knew that escaping with Liu Li was a desperate gamble.</p><p>However, encountering this strange demonic cultivator, Qin Sang couldn't resist the temptation to learn more, hoping to uncover further information.</p><p>The direct confrontation revealed that this was a Celestial Serpent.</p><p>The Celestial Serpent was a being of immense power, far exceeding expectations.  It wasn’t a star lord or official, but a late-stage Celestial Serpent cultivator—the sheer scale of its power was unimaginable.  If the Sea Clan possessed such a being, he would have heard of it.</p><p>Further, the Celestial Serpent’s behavior was peculiar, unlike the demonic creatures swept away by the tide of madness.  He and Liu Li remained unharmed.</p><p>Qin Sang looked around, particularly at the sky.  There were no further fire meteors; only this Celestial Serpent remained.  While the Celestial Serpent’s power was immense, Qin Sang knew he had a chance.</p><p>Was his strength enough to challenge the Celestial Serpent?</p><p>Considering this, Qin Sang signaled to Liu Li, instructing her to retreat while he would create a distraction; there was no need to unleash the Celestial Emperor Talisman yet.</p><p>Liu Li nodded, swiftly moving away.</p><p>At that moment, Qin Sang secretly activated his incantation; a torrential downpour began, courtesy of the Nine Heavens Azure Pool Thunderstorm Technique.</p><p>The rain poured down, and the flames began to subside, briefly extinguished by the thunder, before roaring back with even greater ferocity.</p><p>Seizing the opportunity, Qin Sang quietly prepared the Four Symbols Formation, slowly deploying it.  His eyes narrowed, fixed on the demonic python phantom’s movement. The demonic python phantom showed no intention of dodging.</p><p>Even the most skilled cultivators couldn’t withstand being directly engulfed in this level of power.</p><p>Perhaps sensing the danger, the demonic python phantom countered aggressively, but its attacks were fruitless, soon falling into the star sea.</p><p>This was a test, confirming that he could indeed stand against the Celestial Serpent.  Qin Sang felt reassured and unleashed the Five Thunder Celestial Heart Talisman.</p><p>“Crack!”</p><p>The demonic python phantom's ferocity was evident; it met the thunder with its own fiery breath.  The serpent soared into the air, revealing its enormous mouth filled with flames, charging towards the attack.</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>The azure thunder and the flames collided, creating shockwaves that spread through the star sea, refusing to subside for a long time.</p><p>Qin Sang had already laid a solid foundation.  Simultaneously, he unleashed a volley of light, aiming at the Sky Serpent.</p><p>“Hiss!”</p><p>The monstrous serpent’s illusory form spat out a ring of demonic fire. The light beams melted like snow upon contact with the flames, unable to get close.  However, the demonic fire’s power was considerable.</p><p>Undeterred, Qin Sang’s attack continued relentlessly. In a short time, he had already grasped the Sky Serpent’s weakness. While possessing immense power, it lacked sufficient finesse and control.</p><p>Next, Qin Sang seized the Sky Serpent’s weakness, employing both sword techniques and lightning magic.  Thunderbolts struck the monstrous serpent form, while simultaneously, he used his own power to suppress the serpent's energy.</p><p>The Sky Serpent was huge; its massive form seemed capable of crushing any opponent. Yet, its attacks were like hitting cotton, only embedding itself deeper with each strike.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>Qin Sang watched the monstrous serpent form, observing the Sky Serpent’s increasingly frantic movements. He wasn't sure whether it was exhaustion or a loss of reason, but it was unable to effectively counter.</p><p>Some cultivators devoutly believe in their own strength, rejecting any external aids. However, for many, external objects often play a significant role in a cultivator's power. The results speak for themselves.</p><p>This thought crossed Qin Sang’s mind, when suddenly, the monstrous serpent reared its head, revealing sharp fangs.</p><p>As the serpent raised its head, a red light illuminated the area.  Astonishingly, the monstrous serpent form produced a small red star.</p><p>Qin Sang’s gaze sharpened. He saw flames suspended in mid-air, even more powerful than the demonic fire previously witnessed, clearly a formidable divine ability.</p><p>Having probed enough, Qin Sang summoned the five-colored light of his Five Element Crown.  A beam of five-elemental light shot towards the red star.</p><p>Simultaneously, he unleashed lightning and sword techniques, with Liuli's assistance. Their combined assault overwhelmed the red star's power. The star shattered, and the monstrous serpent form crumbled, its true form revealed.</p><p>Throughout the fight, Qin Sang had been observing the Sky Serpent, noticing no sign of regaining reason. It was simply a frenzied beast.  Even if captured, its value would be questionable.</p><p>Elsewhere,</p><p>Liuli remained vigilant, constantly scanning their surroundings for uninvited guests.  The area around them possessed peculiar characteristics—a patch of darkness.  Liuli probed into it and detected a faint, ominous presence emanating from the Sky Serpent’s location.</p><p>Suddenly, Liuli sensed something, sharply raising his head, his eyes revealing a look of surprise and seriousness.</p><p>Since entering the secret realm, the violent storms and demonic energy had subsided. The sky had turned a greyish-white. The light was dim, but not entirely dark.  </p><p>Then, Liuli saw it: a vast darkness rapidly spreading towards them, like a black curtain descending upon them.</p><p>It was an absolute, impenetrable blackness.</p><p>Amidst the chaos, Qin Sang had completely subdued the Sky Serpent, noticing the change. He raised his head, his brow furrowed slightly, but his attack never faltered.</p><p>Under Qin Sang’s ferocious assault, the monstrous serpent roared, desperately defending itself. The weaknesses exposed were quickly exploited by Qin Sang, accelerating its demise.</p><p>Finally, the Sky Serpent’s struggle weakened.  As it opened its mouth, Qin Sang sensed something, and struck instantly!</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>A bolt of blue lightning struck the Sky Serpent’s head.</p><p>The Sky Serpent’s head, already mangled and bleeding, exploded under the lightning. The serpent’s body stiffened and fell.</p><p>At that moment, a shocking sight occurred; the body disintegrated like an illusion.  The scattered flesh and blood vanished, leaving no trace behind.  Only faint magical imprints remained on the ground, evidence of its prior existence.</p><p>Seeing this, Liuli exclaimed, "Is this also fake?"</p><p>Qin Sang nodded slowly.</p><p>It was unimaginable.  The Serpent Valley's flowing waters, the towering trees—all seemed like illusions. But could even the intelligence it displayed be false?</p><p>Impossible...</p><p>Qin Sang's heart sank. A possibility occurred to her: perhaps these demonic beasts weren't just improving their power, they were undergoing some kind of transformation, ultimately becoming indistinguishable from truly living creatures!</p><p>If that were the case, the upcoming tide would be even more dangerous.</p><p>"Qin Dao-you, what are you thinking?" Liuli asked, noticing Qin Sang's pensive expression.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded slightly, uncertainly saying, "I have a strange feeling...the demonic python's manifestation seems familiar..."</p><p>It was a very strange feeling indeed.</p><p>Qin Sang had encountered many demonic cultivators before, and they also cultivated manifestations, but she had never had this feeling before.</p><p>"Could it be due to the cultivation technique?" she mused.</p><p>Thinking of the *Heavenly Demon Transformation*, Qin Sang looked towards where the Serpent's form had fallen.</p><p>The *Heavenly Demon Transformation* was the most unique demonic cultivation technique she had ever learned.  It used starlight to cultivate, and the Serpent's form...was there some connection?</p><p>Unfortunately, the Serpent's form was just an illusion...</p><p>Qin Sang dismissed the thought, carefully examining the surrounding area. Her expression changed, and she said, "Could this be the power of the Spring and Autumn Dial?"</p><p>Liuli nodded, gravely agreeing, "Every time the Spring and Autumn Dial appears, there is an alternation of black and white, day and night. This scene is very similar to what's recorded in the ancient texts."</p><p>"It seems this secret realm has already undergone a change," Qin Sang concluded.</p><p>The Spring and Autumn Dial rarely appears, usually only after a certain amount of time has passed and specific conditions are met.  The fact that day and night alternations are already happening suggests the secret realm has somehow triggered the Dial's premature appearance.</p><p>From their perspective, this was not good news. It meant their upcoming mission was even more precarious.  Although she hadn’t placed much hope on the Spring and Autumn Dial initially, its unexpected early appearance certainly wasn’t helpful.</p><p>However, given the instructions from Zhenren (Master), regardless of the circumstances, they would have to investigate eventually.</p><p>...</p><p>Outside Heart Lake.</p><p>On a mountain peak.</p><p>Ever since they entered the secret realm, Laitian had been standing, gazing towards the sky and into the depths of the lake.</p><p>Suddenly, Laitian spoke, "I estimate that soon, new allies will appear. The order from above… I presume you've all seen it?"</p><p>There was no one else around him; it felt like he was speaking into empty air.</p><p>Silence hung in the air.</p><p>After a moment, a voice called from outside the mountain, "Laitian, what are you trying to do?"</p><p>"Laitian, you're quite bold for someone at the Empty Realm Second Stage, daring to clash with the Feather People.  Don't you want to go against the higher powers' intentions?"  This was followed by a woman’s teasing laughter, shrill and sharp.</p><p>"Is it really that I don't know my place?"</p><p>Laitian smiled faintly, his gaze fixed on the deep waters of Heart Lake. "Look now.  Those old fellows are all deeply entangled, their strength waning."</p><p>This expedition, under the guise of delivering supplies to… (omitting the place name), was also an exploratory mission.</p><p>Qin Sang and the others had been gone for so long, and the ancestors showed no reaction; that’s enough for some speculation.</p><p>"Hmph!"</p><p>A sharp voice let out a cold snort. "Those old fellows are trapped, and we're the ones who need to act outside! We're clearly being left with the good stuff, yet some are trying to take a share.  I'll see who dares to step out of line now!"</p><p>The speaker expressed this sentiment, gaining some agreement, although some voiced dissent. However, this seemed to represent the majority's opinion.</p><p>"Perhaps you're overthinking it,"</p><p>After a moment of silence, a calmer voice spoke.</p><p>"The ancestors wanting to keep some of the good things for themselves is only natural. If the ancestors don't interfere, what the disciples can eventually get is just a drop in the ocean, hardly worth mentioning.</p><p>Before the voice could finish, a hearty voice boomed, "Haha, that's right, Your Majesty.  What the Empress said is reasonable. If the ancestors don't interfere, some disciples are particularly lucky, and it wouldn't hurt to let them have a bit more.  Let’s not overthink this; the real constraint is within ourselves."</p><p>"Did you wake everyone up this morning to establish some rules?"</p><p>The speaker's implication was that the woman who had just spoken was actually the Empress of the Orcs!</p><p>"I'm not trying to bribe anyone!"</p><p>That sharp voice remained firm, "Not everyone can see the big picture! Some are revered ancestors, but they've lived for too long, sitting high and mighty, acting as they please.  We must be wary!"</p><p>"What he said is right. This breakthrough is the biggest challenge I've faced, perhaps the biggest challenge of my life.  Caution is necessary," another voice chimed in. "Since this is the case, why not wait a little longer and observe those youngsters? If someone slips up, they'll reveal their true nature. The old guys are bickering among themselves; the situation remains under our control."</p><p>"You're being too impatient today," someone objected.</p><p>Xitian, without turning, gestured with a hand: "I'm from a humble, small tribe, completely alone, how can I not be impatient?  If we don't quickly establish rules, even if the elders don't interfere, after this matter is concluded, if someone makes a wrong move and fails, what good will all the posturing do?"</p><p>"Xitian, you are far too anxious!"</p><p>The previously boisterous voice said coldly, "The fate of the tribes rests on the sea, and beyond the borders, forever there will be one Orc race, this is our ancestry!"</p><p>The Orc Empress said calmly,  "Don't act so arrogant. Even if you win, what's left after the dust settles?  Those ancestral realms might not all have ancestral masters, perhaps we will all be watching your performance, Xitian."</p><p>"Oh?" Xitian grinned, "I'll take your words as a good omen, Your Majesty. When the time comes, I will certainly keep my word.”</p>
