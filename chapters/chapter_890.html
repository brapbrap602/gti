<h1>Chapter 882: Unfettered</h1><p>Chapter 882: Unfettered</p><p>At that moment, a faint sigh echoed through the grand hall. A deep, unfamiliar male voice boomed, "Junior Brother Chen, Daoist Huayang is a far-off guest; don't be rude."</p><p>Silence fell over the hall.</p><p>The Chen cultivator suppressed his anger, "Senior Brother Sect Master, you're back."</p><p>Elder Daoist Huayang looked up slightly.  Facing the head of the Yanmiao Pavilion, even he dared not be negligent, unlike his treatment of the Chen cultivator.</p><p>The elder bowed to the empty space, "This old Daoist's visit to Yanmiao Pavilion was to discuss some matters with Daoist Qi. Unfortunately, Daoist Qi is unavailable…"</p><p>"Qi is out on an errand and just returned to the mountain gate.  I'm preoccupied with urgent matters and cannot meet Daoist Huayang now.  Please forgive me."</p><p>The speaker was Qi, the master of Yanmiao Pavilion.</p><p>He seemed oblivious to the previous events, speaking casually, like chatting with a friend.</p><p>His physical manifestation stood with hands at his sides, appearing docile and obedient.</p><p>Within his Qi Sea, the Sky-Eyed Butterfly was also subdued, hidden and motionless.</p><p>This man was a renowned expert on Lan Dou Island, almost ready to break through to the Yuan Ying stage, his cultivation even exceeding Xiang Yi's.</p><p>Fortunately, the second transformation of the Sky-Eyed Butterfly could mask its presence from Foundation Establishment cultivators.  Now, with caution, there's no need to worry about being discovered.</p><p>The physical manifestation, as long as it didn't stand beside Qin Sang, wouldn't be easily recognized.</p><p>Daoist Huayang repeatedly said, "This old Daoist's visit was presumptuous, how could I blame Daoist Qi?  You should be aware of the matter I was discussing with Junior Brother Chen. This old Daoist is not a villain who seizes what he wants, but circumstances force my hand. Of course, we will not make you suffer losses. If there are suitable disciples, we'll provide generous compensation to your Pavilion…"</p><p>Master Qi chuckled, "Yanmiao Pavilion and Lan Dou Sect are essentially one.  Why speak of compensation?  A few disciples are the same wherever they cultivate."</p><p>His implication seemed to be an agreement to Daoist Huayang's request, without any conditions.</p><p>This surprised Daoist Huayang; he didn't expect Master Qi to be so agreeable.</p><p>Although Master Qi essentially repeated his previous words, with an undertone of mockery, Daoist Huayang could only pretend not to notice.</p><p>"Senior Brother!"</p><p>The Chen cultivator, displeased by the Pavilion Master's words, protested.</p><p>Daoist Huayang bowed slightly to the Chen cultivator, "I apologize for my earlier offense. I hope you won't take it to heart.  You know that our Yin-Yang lineage's demands on disciples are extremely harsh; talent isn't necessarily enough.  Among these disciples, there might not be a single one who meets our requirements."</p><p>"Or maybe you'll sweep them all up!"</p><p>The Chen cultivator sneered.</p><p>"Junior Brother Chen…"</p><p>Master Qi called to him, and it seemed he transmitted a message.</p><p>The Chen cultivator, with an angry expression, coldly snorted but said no more, immediately striding away.</p><p>"Wait!"</p><p>At that moment, Daoist Huayang suddenly appeared before the Chen cultivator, blocking his path, pointing at Fang Ting behind him, "This young lady is a new disciple, isn't she? Let's see if she's suitable for the Yin-Yang Disk…"</p><p>"You dare!"</p><p>The Chen cultivator, already suppressing his rage, saw Daoist Huayang set his sights on Fang Ting. His anger erupted, disregarding even the ancestral hall's rules, drawing his sword to strike.</p><p>The blade, sharp as autumn water, flashed towards the elder's face.</p><p>Daoist Huayang seemed prepared, flicking his whisk.  Countless white strands shot out. His cultivation surpassed the Chen cultivator's by a level, and he showed no fear.</p><p>The others in the hall hadn't reacted yet.</p><p>Just then, dense runes suddenly appeared on the hall walls. The void inexplicably tightened, and the sword light dissipated in mid-air. Simultaneously, the strands from the whisk vanished, returning to their original state.</p><p>"Enough! Junior Brother Chen, have you forgotten the ancestral precept against wielding weapons in the ancestral hall!  Dare to violate the ancestral instructions again, and Qi will discipline you!"</p><p>Then, Master Qi coldly addressed Daoist Huayang, "Daoist Huayang, Yanmiao Pavilion may be a small sect, but we won't allow anyone to insult our rules."</p><p>"This old Daoist was rash."</p><p>Daoist Huayang didn't argue, only staring at Fang Ting, "This old Daoist merely saw the young lady's exceptional aura and was delighted, hence the lapse in decorum."</p><p>Master Qi sighed, "This girl's talent is indeed remarkable, but she has already been accepted as a direct disciple by Junior Brother Chen.  She cannot be given to Daoist Huayang."</p><p>"Oh?"</p><p>Daoist Huayang was reluctant to give up, "I see no Yanmiao Pavilion token on the young lady. She should be a new disciple, having not yet chosen a master, right?"</p><p>The Chen cultivator, suppressed by the ancestral hall's power, couldn't speak, his face reddening with suppressed fury.</p><p>"Young lady, you must know of Lan Dou Sect?  If you join our sect, not only will our Yin-Yang lineage wholeheartedly cultivate you, but if you encounter obstacles in your cultivation, you can also seek personal guidance from the Sect Master.  The Yuan Ying ancestor's magical powers are unfathomable, an opportunity countless cultivators yearn for…"</p><p>Ignoring the Chen cultivator, Daoist Huayang patiently tried to persuade Fang Ting.</p><p>Fang Ting had never experienced anything like this before, and was completely at a loss.</p><p>Qi, the Pavilion Master, said calmly, "I'm afraid I must disappoint Daoist Huayang. Fang Ting has been under the tutelage of Disciple Chen since childhood and has formally become his apprentice.  He sent her to Yanmiao Pavilion alone to participate in this ceremony to temper her character."</p><p>Fang Ting finally reacted and quickly said, "I will obey my Master."</p><p>"I see."</p><p>Daoist Huayang showed a look of regret.</p><p>His discerning eye had spotted that the others were mediocre, only Fang Ting stood out, comparable to the top disciples of the Lan Dou Sect.</p><p>He had risked losing face by personally coming to Yanmiao Pavilion to recruit her, specifically targeting such a talented new disciple.</p><p>Others felt sorry for Fang Ting.</p><p>That was a Nascent Soul master!  To receive guidance from a Nascent Soul master was a great stroke of luck, yet the girl had unknowingly missed it.</p><p>However, the transformed being felt that the girl's choice might not be a bad thing.</p><p>The Lan Dou Sect was powerful, with abundant resources, but the competition was also fiercer.  It remained uncertain how much effort the Yin-Yang lineage would invest in her.</p><p>The so-called guidance from a Nascent Soul master, while sounding wonderful, was merely an empty promise.</p><p>Before her Golden Core breakthrough, even when at Xiaohua Mountain, Qin Sang had never even met a Nascent Soul master. Only top-tier cultivators like Qiu Mu Bai could attract the attention of a Nascent Soul master, worthy of their time and effort.</p><p>Qin Sang, through her cultivation journey, had gained a deep understanding.</p><p>Low-level cultivators have their own difficulties; Nascent Soul masters are not exempt from their own struggles.  Not to mention that the overall strength of cultivators in the Canglang Sea far surpasses that of Xiao Han Domain, with an extremely complex situation, and even Nascent Soul masters are below late-stage cultivators.</p><p>The tribulation that occurs every three hundred years acts as a series of death sentences hanging over their heads!</p><p>Advance, or perish.</p><p>"Disciple Chen, take Fang Ting and leave. You are to spend a year in seclusion to refine your character. I do not wish to see a similar incident again."</p><p>Qi, the Pavilion Master, dispelled the restrictions in the ancestral hall.</p><p>The pressure on the cultivator surnamed Chen lifted, and he left the hall without looking back.</p><p>Fang Ting quickly followed.</p>
