<h1>Chapter 929: The Ling Chan Cave</h1><p>Chapter 929: The Ling Chan Cave</p><p>"I am here for my own reasons, not at your invitation,"</p><p>said Fang Laomo, his voice cold despite his appearance as a withered cicada.</p><p>The Grand Witch Priestess was unfazed by Fang Laomo's attitude.  "Your presence here is a deterrent, making my task much easier. I won't interfere with what you intend to do in the Seven Kills Hall. I only ask that you cooperate with me and play your part before Ling Zhuzi."</p><p>Fang Laomo remained silent for a moment, seeming to tacitly agree.</p><p>A hint of delight appeared on the Grand Witch Priestess's face. "Your arrival is opportune.  Controlling the Thousand Swords Formation alone is taxing; with your help, it will be significantly easier."</p><p>She paused, making a final attempt.</p><p>"Wouldn't you consider cooperating with me? Discovering the ancient Witch legacy would greatly benefit our clan, bringing glory for generations to come. We would both gain from it, possibly even a glimpse of the chance to achieve the Divine Transformation. Perhaps you could even regain your human form. Human cultivation methods aren't entirely compatible with ours, and this discrepancy becomes increasingly pronounced at higher realms. Otherwise, why would our clan have never produced a Divine Transformation cultivator? You likely realized this during your Nascent Soul tribulation…"</p><p>Before she could finish, Fang Laomo interrupted, "My cultivation is too weak; I can only look out for myself. I don't have your grand aspirations to benefit all mankind. Your reasons are insufficient to convince me that a human sacred site would hide ancient Witch inheritance – it's absurd! No more words. I’ll play along, but I won't be under your control once we enter the Seven Kills Hall."</p><p>"I'm already struggling to manage Ling Zhuzi; I have no energy to control you,"</p><p>the Grand Witch Priestess sighed slightly. "Thank you, Fang Laomo."</p><p>Their exchange was brief; outsiders couldn't hear their conversation. They only saw the Grand Witch Priestess personally welcoming Fang Laomo, amicably bringing him into their ranks.</p><p>Other Nascent Soul-level Witch cultivators bowed respectfully to Fang Laomo.</p><p>It seemed they had planned this beforehand, causing the human Nascent Soul cultivators to look uneasy.</p><p>"So Fang Laomo has also emerged from the Ling Chan Cave!  I am even more curious. The Seven Kills Hall, besides the inner chamber that opens only every few hundred years, has been thoroughly searched countless times by human experts. What could possibly remain that warrants your presence?"</p><p>Ling Zhuzi stared at the Grand Witch Priestess and Fang Laomo, his eyes narrowed slightly.</p><p>Fang Laomo remained silent.</p><p>The Grand Witch Priestess spoke, a touch of sarcasm in her tone. "Will Ling Zhuzi, like the Demon Lord last time, follow me everywhere?  Then you’ll know what I’m looking for. Why ask?"</p><p>"I do intend to follow the Grand Witch Priestess to broaden my understanding. Perhaps I can even lend a hand if you encounter difficulties,"</p><p>Ling Zhuzi admitted openly, then his tone shifted.  "However, I'm most concerned that the number of Nascent Soul cultivators entering the Seven Kills Hall exceeds the limit, and the Thousand Swords Formation can't perfectly conceal our auras.  Breaking the formation might alert the Immortal Array, causing complications and endangering everyone."</p><p>"That's easy to solve,"</p><p>The Grand Witch Priestess sneered, turning to an old man. "Elder Feng?"</p><p>The old man understood, taking out a jade amulet and presenting it to Fang Laomo. "Fang Laomo, this is a protective amulet. I’ll wait for you and the Grand Witch Priestess outside the storm."</p><p>The amulet resembled the one Qin Sang possessed, but its runes were far more complex.</p><p>Fang Laomo accepted the amulet without hesitation.</p><p>The elder departed, disappearing into the storm in a few blinks.</p><p>The Grand Witch Priestess addressed Ling Zhuzi. "You needn't worry now, shall you?"</p><p>Ling Zhuzi dropped the matter, saying nothing more. After a moment of contemplation, he secretly transmitted a message to the human Nascent Soul cultivators, "Fang Laomo’s unexpected appearance requires an adjustment to our strategy…"</p><p>The Nascent Soul cultivators reacted differently.</p><p>Several Demon cultivators looked grim, clearly displeased with Ling Zhuzi's arrangement.</p><p>Mou Laomo was particularly upset.</p><p>"Once this is done, you're free to search for treasures. Anyone who disregards my words and jeopardizes the operation, the Demon Lord will not tolerate you, even without my intervention…"</p><p>Ling Zhuzi glared at those Demon cultivators, his eyes flashing with cold light, before coldly humming.</p><p>The Demon cultivators exchanged glances, their expressions shifting several times before they fell silent.</p><p>A hint of urgency flickered in Mou Laomo's eyes. He subtly observed the other Nascent Soul cultivators, then glanced at the Foundation Establishment cultivators outside, falling into deep thought.</p><p>Qin Sang and the others were unaware of the turmoil among the Nascent Soul masters.</p><p>After the withered cicada appeared, the Foundation Establishment cultivators had been abuzz with discussion.</p><p>"Is that the famed Fang... the one from the Wu tribe, the one legendary for failing to form his Nascent Soul, yet merging with his fourth-stage soul-linked insect?"</p><p>"Himself! I thought it was just a rumor, never expected to meet him in person!"</p><p>Even the human cultivators were awestruck by Fang Laomo's actions, filled with admiration.  One asked a nearby Wu cultivator, "This must be unprecedented, right?"</p><p>The Wu cultivator nodded. "In our tribe, merging one's primordial spirit with their soul-linked insect – more than a few have considered it, but only Senior Fang succeeded.  After his success, many cultivators who despaired of forming their Nascent Soul tried to imitate him.  All perished, some even losing their souls along with their insects, denied even reincarnation."</p><p>"What a ruthless man…"</p><p>…</p><p>Qin Sang approached, listening to their discussion, murmuring in astonishment, "It's actually him!"</p><p>He'd heard tales of Fang Laomo when he first arrived at the Canglang Sea and landed on the Wu God Continent.</p><p>The man's actions were shocking, his legend spreading even to the remote Western Frontier.  Even more astonishing, he'd actually succeeded, transforming into an insect-bodied being, and was still alive and well.</p><p>The Grand Shaman personally greeted him, clearly holding him in high regard.</p><p>It seemed this person not only broke through the Nascent Soul stage bottleneck but continued to cultivate, achieving a status equal to the Grand Shaman.</p><p>"Is Senior Fang also a late-Nascent Soul cultivator?"</p><p>Qin Sang interjected.</p><p>The Wu cultivator glanced at him. Hearing Qin Sang also address him as "Senior," he softened his tone. "Senior Fang's situation is unique, unparalleled.  No one can say for sure his true cultivation level.  But Senior Fang's reputation is as great as the Grand Shaman’s, so his strength must be comparable."</p><p>Qin Sang later overheard more about Fang Laomo's exploits.</p><p>But with the man himself nearby, no one dared to speak freely, keeping their comments brief.</p><p>Fang Laomo wasn't just renowned; he was infamous, a figure both righteous and wicked, ruthless and merciless.</p>
