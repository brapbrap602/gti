<h1>Chapter 1174: A Marriage Alliance</h1><p>Chapter 1174: A Marriage Alliance</p><p>The Serpent King dashed onto the battlefield, stopping the Weaver King.</p><p>Qin Sang, seeing this, temporarily ceased his attack and looked at the Weaver King.</p><p>“Weaver Daoist friend?”</p><p>The Weaver King was furious, clearly unwilling to accept defeat, believing he still had the strength to fight.</p><p>The Serpent King gestured with his hand, and the bone knife, which had been flung away earlier, spun and landed in his palm.  “Even my Shadow Bone Knife couldn't harm Daoist friend Mingyue.  Your strength doesn't seem like that of a newly ascended being! You've been so calm and collected, consistently countering with precision strikes, holding back the Weaver King. You must be hiding greater abilities, aren't you? It seems Daoist Bamboo isn't just highly skilled in cultivation, but also exceptionally adept at training disciples! I admire you greatly!”</p><p>The Serpent King was quite open, admitting to Qin Sang that he had lent the Shadow Bone Knife to the Weaver King.</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't surprised; he would have done the same.</p><p>After a brief exchange, Qin Sang could see that the Shadow Bone Knife was indeed a remarkable ancient treasure. If the Weaver King's final Serpent Shadow technique hadn't been destroyed by the Sky Eye Butterfly and combined with the bone knife, it would have been extremely difficult to deal with.</p><p>However, they underestimated their own strength.</p><p>Even if the Weaver King used all his might, Qin Sang was not the least bit afraid,  ready to unleash the Twelve Demon Banners.</p><p>The Serpent King possessed a remarkable bearing.</p><p>Despite the fight, it was hard to dislike him.</p><p>Qin Sang humbly acknowledged the compliment, moved out of the black mist, put away his magic banners and other treasures, and glanced into the distance. Sensing some hidden gazes retracting, a glint flashed in his eyes before he calmly looked away.</p><p>He and the Weaver King's duel, although confined to the space between two mountains, restricted their use of divine powers and treasures, yet the spectacle was undeniable.</p><p>Any passing demon king would easily notice the fight.</p><p>“Daoist friend, the fire banner formation you used… it seems familiar. I believe I've seen something similar before. I recall a powerful human cultivator, a master of the demonic path, Kui Yin Daoist, who wielded the Ten Directions Yama Banners, quite renowned in his time.”</p><p>The Serpent King, with his long life, had indeed seen the Ten Directions Yama Banners and recognized their origins.  Since the banner poles were with Senior Sister Qing Jun, Qin Sang didn't need to hide the fact that he possessed magic banners. "My master unexpectedly obtained the refining techniques of the old demon Kui Yin. This treasure is a slightly modified version, based on the Ten Directions Yama Banners, perfectly suited to me.”</p><p>“The power of the demonic flames is comparable to the original.  Unexpectedly, you're also a skilled refiner…”</p><p>The Serpent King nodded and didn't probe further.</p><p>The Weaver King stood to the side, his face grim, remaining silent.</p><p>Qin Sang looked at him.</p><p>The Weaver King snorted, absorbing the black mist, and muttered, “I concede!”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded; this was the best outcome.</p><p>He was about to take his leave when he saw the smaller demons flying from afar.</p><p>The demons had observed the entire battle. Although obscured by the black mist, the sheer scale of the two kings' confrontation instilled even greater awe.</p><p>Qin Sang looked sideways.</p><p>Next to the White Crane and the Fat Chicken was a small, elegant-looking demon bird at the Dan stage.  It leaned against the White Crane, whispering softly with shy eyes.  Seeing the two powerful beings reconcile, it showed no restraint, cuddling affectionately with the White Crane.</p><p>I'm fighting my life away, and this guy is flirting!</p><p>This guy is getting bolder and bolder, not even considering the other party's background.  Brought here by the Serpent King to Demon City, their identity must be extraordinary.</p><p>Qin Sang glared at the White Crane.</p><p>The White Crane restrained himself slightly, shaking his white feathers, unable to hide his smugness.</p><p>The Serpent King wasn't angered.  Seeing this, a smile touched his lips.</p><p>The bird flew to the Serpent King, looking bashful, and whispered a few words.</p><p>The Serpent King laughed heartily. “Unexpectedly, a wonderful occasion has arisen today! Daoist friend Mingyue, is this young White Crane already married?”</p><p>At these words, the White Crane froze, completely stiff.</p><p>Qin Sang was startled.  Was the Serpent King trying to match them up?</p><p>He subtly warned the White Crane with a shake of his head.</p><p>“Just now, young White Crane said he fell in love with Yue’er at first sight.  Yue’er has extremely high standards and hasn't chosen a partner yet.  Strangely, she also developed genuine feelings for White Crane. Yue’er is my wife’s niece, and I treat her like my own daughter.  She is a suitable match for White Crane.”</p><p>The Serpent King, unwilling to separate this loving couple, asked for Qin Sang's opinion.  "My lord, no!" cried Bai He, distraught, desperately pleading with his friend, "Brother, save me!"</p><p>Bai He, a notorious womanizer with a penchant for married women and a complete aversion to responsibility, never considered monogamy.  Marrying Yue'er, with the Serpent King's backing, meant strict supervision—an end to his carefree lifestyle.  Unfortunately, his friend betrayed him without hesitation.</p><p>"My lord, political marriages have always been an excellent way for powerful factions to resolve conflicts and strengthen ties, and it's no different among the yao," the plump chicken whispered to Qin Sang, subtly urging, "Bai He is fickle, which could hinder his cultivation.  A partner to guide him would be beneficial." The chicken, long annoyed by Bai He's constant displays of his romantic conquests, was glad to see his friend's comeuppance. Even his own friend disapproved of him.</p><p>Qin Sang hesitated, then said, "I wonder how you plan to arrange this? Our Thousand Bamboo Forest is not as large or influential as your esteemed families, and we have few cultivators at the Yao Dan stage…"</p><p>"That's no problem!" the Serpent King declared generously.  "We're family now. Yue'er will join us at Thousand Bamboo Forest; I believe she'll be happy. The guidance of Daoist Sang and Daoist Mingyue will be a blessing for her. With the current unrest in the cultivation world, a grand wedding is unsuitable, but our yao customs are less formal.  I've prepared Yue'er's dowry; we'll find an auspicious day to send her to Thousand Bamboo Forest…"</p><p>Yue'er rejoiced. Bai He, eyes vacant, appeared to be in shock. Qin Sang's objections remained unspoken.</p><p>Gaining a powerful Yao Dan cultivator and forging an alliance with the Serpent King—there was no reason to refuse. Qin Sang had long wanted to discipline Bai He; this was his own doing.</p><p>On the way back, the atmosphere was markedly different; the Qianji Yao Wang was less hostile towards Qin Sang.  In this cheerful atmosphere, arrangements were swiftly finalized.  Both Qin Sang and the Serpent King would go to the front lines; the wedding would be handled by Liu Yao and the Serpent King’s confidant, witnessed by the Qianji Yao Wang and Bamboo Daoist. Qin Sang generously provided a lavish dowry for Bai He.</p><p>Yue'er clung to Bai He, her happiness palpable.  Everyone was jubilant except Bai He, who was utterly despondent, especially after Qin Sang’s warning:  "If you betray Yue'er and anger the Serpent King, I'll break your legs!"</p>
