<h1>Chapter 1505: The Stele Space (4k)</h1><p>This phenomenon is impossible for those demons to achieve; even Hun Mo and Tian Peng working together couldn't accomplish this.</p><p>Jiang Dianzhu and Mei Zhanglao stared, dumbfounded.</p><p>They hadn't expected any real changes on this trip.  If Hun Mo and the others trespassed into the depths of the sacred land, were caught in a spatial current, and suffered severe injuries, there might be a chance to pick up the pieces.</p><p>The scene before them shocked them speechless.</p><p>Their familiar sacred land held secrets unknown to them.</p><p>“This…”</p><p>Mei Zhanglao’s jaw dropped, speechless for a moment before murmuring, “What has the Palace Master done?”</p><p>Elder Hun Mo was brought here by Yin Changsheng.</p><p>Naturally, suspicion fell upon Yin Changsheng.</p><p>Jiang Dianzhu gazed at the space within the mist, saying in a low voice, “The Grand Elder questioned them. The Palace Master originally instructed them to create illusions around the stele and set up a killing array, waiting for Hun Mo to walk into a trap.  There shouldn't have been any other preparations…”</p><p>If Yin Changsheng knew about the stele space, she would have opened it long ago.</p><p>“Could it be…that Hun Mo or Tian Peng discovered the secret of the stele? A secret that the Xuan Tian Palace cultivators never discovered throughout history?”</p><p>Mei Zhanglao’s voice was distorted by disbelief.  It was too incredible.</p><p>Xuan Tian Palace had unknowingly guarded a treasure trove for ages.</p><p>Those demons discovered this mysterious space on their first entry and opened it.</p><p>What incredibly fortunate luck!</p><p>Could the stele be a demonic or妖族 sacred object?</p><p>Qin Sang and Liuli flashed to their side, also staring at the ever-expanding white mist.  Liuli, being a first-time visitor to the sacred land, was merely curious.</p><p>Qin Sang asked, “Is this the first time the stele has undergone such a change?”</p><p>Jiang Dianzhu nodded, “Forget such a shocking phenomenon.  Our predecessors conducted various experiments, and no matter what we did, the stele never reacted…”</p><p>Qin Sang ordered the Sky Eye Butterfly to fully utilize its abilities.  As far as the eye could see, immortal mist swirled, with what seemed like hall-like illusions within, their reality uncertain.</p><p>The stele and the lotus platform were completely gone.</p><p>Why did this space, sealed for countless years, suddenly open now?</p><p>Qin Sang pondered, suspecting it might be related to the sword spirit, that the sword spirit sensed the fragments of the killing sword, thus triggering a certain restriction within the space?</p><p>The more Qin Sang thought about it, the more likely it seemed.</p><p>Regardless, they had to go.</p><p>Qin Sang carefully examined the area, saying, “There are no traces left by Hun Mo and the others.”</p><p>“The space opened gradually. The stele was probably the beginning, or the entrance. Even if they made any preparations, they were likely swallowed along with the stele,” Jiang Dianzhu nodded towards the front, estimating, “The entrance to the space now covers nearly ten miles. It seems they've been inside for a while!”</p><p>Jiang Dianzhu looked troubled.</p><p>While understanding the urgency, there was a group of ferocious demons inside. They were only four; too few.  Acting rashly would not only yield no opportunities but also risk their lives.</p><p>Mei Zhanglao frowned and decisively said, “I’ll go back and report to the Grand Elder, bring more people. You two act according to the situation!”</p><p>With that, Mei Zhanglao summoned his magic weapon, displaying his fastest speed, and disappeared into the spatial currents in the blink of an eye.</p><p>Qin Sang and Liuli exchanged a glance. “Jiang Dianzhu, we plan to enter and scout ahead. What are your thoughts?”</p><p>Jiang Dianzhu hesitated.  “I’ll search the vicinity for any clues and wait for the Grand Elder and the others. The stele is part of the sacred land, and the space must be connected to the floating mountain outside.  There might be something we can utilize.  The demons are powerful; be careful.  Liuli, take this golden toad.”</p><p>Jiang Dianzhu produced two thumb-sized golden toads.</p><p>Each toad held a pearl in its mouth.</p><p>Giving one to Liuli, Jiang Dianzhu explained, “The space inside shouldn’t be very vast. This is a special artifact I obtained during my travels years ago. Within a certain range, it can transmit simple messages, unless it's blocked by special spirit formations or seals.  If anything happens, call for help!”</p><p>In such a place, having communication was a good thing.</p><p>As Liuli received the toad, Qin Sang patted her corpse puppet bag, taking out Yin Dianzhu's imprisoned Nascent Soul.</p><p>She loosened some of the seals.</p><p>Yin Dianzhu awoke, initially confused.  Seeing Qin Sang's face, she realized her situation and coldly said, “Don't you dare delay Yin's…  You dare…”</p><p>Mid-sentence, Yin Dianzhu noticed her surroundings, staring at the white mist. Her Nascent Soul displayed an expression of unadulterated shock.</p><p>Seeing Yin Dianzhu's expression, Qin Sang was certain it wasn't Yin Changsheng's doing.</p><p>Resealing her, Qin Sang and Liuli flashed inside.</p><p>The entire entrance to the space was sealed by immortal mist.</p><p>The mist appeared mysterious.</p><p>Qin Sang, wasting no time, motioned for Liuli to follow, slowing their pace and proceeding cautiously.</p><p>After proceeding a short distance, they found no obstacles whatsoever.  There were no barriers or protective formations; the path was completely clear.</p><p>Qin Sang gradually increased their speed, and as they walked, the fog thinned. The hall and pavilions glimpsed earlier were not illusions.</p><p>Emerging from the fog, they found themselves facing a small lake.  Pavilions and elegant, exquisitely crafted buildings stood upon the lake.</p><p>Qin Sang and Liuli stopped, concealing their auras, and surveyed their surroundings.  The clouds above were dense and low, creating a heavy, oppressive atmosphere that felt dangerous.</p><p>A mountain loomed across the lake. The lakebed was dry, and the mountain had lost its former splendor.  However, the pavilions and the connected buildings remained pristine and undamaged.  Strange, shimmering lights emanated from the mountain—the glow of ancient prohibitions.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't see Hun Mo and the others, but noticed fresh marks on the mountain, evidence of someone forcibly breaking the ancient prohibitions. The marks led to the most prominent building behind the pavilions: a two-story structure with a slightly tilted red gourd carved into its roof.  Three large characters were inscribed: Danxiang Pavilion.</p><p>“Danxiang Pavilion?  Could this be an ancient alchemical workshop?  The entrance leads directly to the alchemy room. What kind of layout is this?”  Qin Sang muttered to themselves, noticing the pavilion's prohibitions were already broken, suggesting it had been thoroughly ransacked by the demons.</p><p>Beyond Danxiang Pavilion, several jade staircases branched off in different directions.  No one was visible in any of them.</p><p>After a brief discussion, Qin Sang and Liuli silently moved towards Danxiang Pavilion.  They were already late, so a little extra time wouldn't matter. Even if others had been here first, examining the pavilion's prohibitions would help them understand this mysterious place.</p><p>Thanks to the previous intruders, Qin Sang and Liuli reached Danxiang Pavilion effortlessly.  They exchanged surprised glances.  They couldn't identify the building material, only that it was extraordinary—an unprecedented spiritual material! However, the more mysterious this place was, the greater the chance of finding the shard of the Killing Sword.  Having witnessed the grandeur of the inner hall of the Seven Killing Temple and the restored Purple Micro Palace, Qin Sang had initially felt that the Xuan Tian Palace was not worthy of housing such a powerful artifact.</p><p>Confirming the absence of traps, Qin Sang and Liuli approached the door and gently pushed it open.  The interior was revealed.</p><p>The first floor was a spacious hall. The only object was a jade alchemy furnace, about the height of a person, large and round-bellied with small circular holes in the lid. However, no smoke emerged from it, and the spiritual fire beneath was long extinguished.</p><p>There were no ancient prohibitions here, only lingering traces of magical power.  It seemed Hun Mo and his group had attempted to take the jade furnace, but failed. Clearly, it was not as simple as it appeared.</p><p>Liuli seemed interested in the patterns on the furnace and moved closer to examine them.  Qin Sang refrained from acting rashly, glancing around before ascending the stairs to the second floor, where the sight was even more unexpected.</p><p>The second floor was equally sparsely furnished.  Identical tables lined each wall, likely for storing pills. Each table held several jeweled flasks containing pills—remarkably, untouched!</p><p>“This…”  Qin Sang's estimation of the space immediately shot up. So many powerful cultivators, painstakingly breaking into Danxiang Pavilion, yet unable to take a single flask? It was incomprehensible!</p><p>Qin Sang found it strange. Hesitating slightly, they approached a table, extending a hand imbued with true energy to grasp one of the flasks.</p><p>‘Swish!’ A shocking sight unfolded. The moment the hand touched the flask, the light distorted, and the hand passed right through it as if it were not there.  Once the hand was removed, the flask was restored to its original state.</p><p>Qin Sang paused, astonished.  “An illusion?” they murmured.</p><p>An illusion so realistic it could deceive anyone.  Even the Sky Eye Butterfly had not detected it. While powerful, the butterfly's abilities were limited by its cultivator's level; it couldn't see through every illusion.</p><p>Qin Sang tried several times, with the same result for all the flasks: visible but intangible.  Returning downstairs, they discovered the jade furnace was the same.</p><p>Qin Sang had to admit his limited experience; he couldn't tell whether these magical gourds were illusions or sealed by some special restriction, entering a mystical state.</p><p>No wonder there were so many residual traces of magical powers around.</p><p>The treasure was right in front of him, yet untouchable, like a mirage. No wonder those demons were so angry and resentful.</p><p>"It seems that opportunities aren't that easy to come by.  Who ultimately obtains them remains unknown,"</p><p>Qin Sang sighed inwardly, glancing at Liuli, who was intently observing the furnace. "Fairy, have you discovered anything?"</p><p>Liuli pointed to one of the patterns on the furnace.</p><p>Qin Sang looked over and found that this pattern was very roughly sketched, but upon closer inspection, it depicted the scenery around the Danxiang Pavilion.</p><p>Several people were seated on a pavilion over the lake, drinking wine, composing poetry, and enjoying themselves.  Behind them, wisps of smoke drifted from the Danxiang Pavilion, with servants bustling within.</p><p>Following the brushstrokes further, one could see that this picture seemed to encompass the entire stone tablet space.  The details became more impressionistic towards the back, making it difficult to discern precise information.</p><p>However, after careful analysis, Qin Sang and Liuli confirmed three locations that seemed to be the most important places within the stone tablet space.  There was no one around; everyone must have gone there.</p><p>The three locations were far apart, in three different directions. Only by visiting all of them could they determine their purpose.</p><p>The demons must have already completed their separate investigations. If they searched each place one by one, they wouldn't have enough time.</p><p>Qin Sang took out the Yang Puppet Crystal given to him by Dongyang Bo, released the demonic fire restriction, and used his spiritual sense to investigate.  He didn't sense Gui Jiangjun's location. He left the Danxiang Pavilion, ascended the jade steps, and tried each one.</p><p>Finally, after walking a distance on one of the jade steps, the Yang Puppet Crystal reacted.</p><p>Gui Jiangjun was ahead!  It was one of the three places Qin Sang and Liuli had chosen!</p><p>These demons were not kind; they had little trust in each other.  Only the pressure from Xuan Tian Palace forced them into temporary cooperation.  It was fortunate they hadn't turned on each other yet, given the current situation; they were certainly highly wary of each other.</p><p>Tianpeng Great Sage led his army in battles against humans, achieving great feats. His prestige among the demons even surpassed that of the Nine-Headed Great Sage. The demon kings had long suffered from the humans, and shared a common hatred, making them noticeably more united than the demonic cultivators.</p><p>Those demonic cultivators also feared being defeated one by one by the demons, so they wouldn't stray too far from their main force.</p><p>If there were hidden treasures in the stone tablet space, they were most likely there!</p><p>Thinking of this, Qin Sang called Liuli, left a mark for Tong Lingyu in a hidden place, and immediately set off.</p><p>The Yang Puppet Crystal's sensing was sometimes clear and sometimes blurry. Qin Sang judged that whenever Gui Jiangjun used that puppet, activating the Yin Puppet Crystal's power, it would be easier for the Yang Puppet Crystal to detect him.</p><p>This meant that Gui Jiangjun might be fighting someone!</p><p>"They've started fighting already? It seems they really found something…"</p><p>Qin Sang chuckled inwardly; chaos was the perfect time to fish in troubled waters.</p><p>There were no ancient restrictions on the jade steps; they wound their way through patches of strange flowers and plants and dense bamboo forests.  But after what happened at the Danxiang Pavilion, Qin Sang felt that the scenery here didn't seem real; it might all be an illusion.</p><p>Along the way, Qin Sang remained vigilant, but felt no sense of being watched.</p><p>Soon, Qin Sang and Liuli ascended a hillside along the jade steps, rounded a corner, and saw the scene ahead: another mountain peak, with more and more forks in the road.</p><p>Guided by the Yang Puppet Crystal, they proceeded without stopping, their goal clear.  They climbed mountains one after another, getting closer to the place.  At the same time, the crystal's sensing became clearer.</p><p>Unexpectedly, they hadn't encountered a single person along the way; all the demons seemed to have vanished.</p><p>"It's just ahead, be careful."</p><p>Qin Sang sent a voice transmission, suppressing his aura, and slowing his pace.</p><p>Rounding the cliff face, Qin Sang's eyes suddenly narrowed.</p><p>On the furnace, this place was depicted by a straight line of ink.</p><p>In reality, however, the path behind the cliff turned sharply downwards, leading to a deep valley.  The valley was filled with a sea of clouds, a chaotic scene.</p><p>Multicolored lights flickered deep within the clouds, surging and receding within the cloud sea, as if they might burst forth from the valley at any moment.</p><p>Based on past experience, this was a sign that treasures were about to appear.</p><p>There wasn't a single person in front of the valley.</p><p>The Yang Puppet Crystal pointed towards the valley.</p><p>Qin Sang examined the valley, carefully observing the entrance. He didn't detect any guards; all the demons seemed to have been drawn in.</p>
