<h1>Chapter 1798: Dharma Image and Dharma Body</h1><p>"Senior, thank you for saving my life. I am eternally grateful."</p><p>The female cultivator slowly regained consciousness.  She was still weak, but struggled to sit up, supported by Yun Wei, and weakly bowed in thanks.</p><p>The strange energy had been expelled, however. The female cultivator's own cultivation was not weak, and her breathing soon stabilized. After taking a few pills, she gradually recovered.</p><p>Qin Sang wanted to learn more about Lougu Mountain and didn't immediately enter meditation. He asked a few questions.</p><p>Both of them were hesitant and evasive, stammering over questions they found difficult to answer.</p><p>Seeing their discomfort, Qin Sang didn't press further.</p><p>He learned that the entrance to Lougu Mountain was located in Zhongmao, under the jurisdiction of the Tianshu Academy.</p><p>Unlike other Daoist sects, Lougu Mountain worshipped the rare Plague God.  Sect disciples began studying plague-related talismans from the start of their training.  Throughout the entire Daoist world, Lougu Mountain was unmatched in this field.</p><p>The current leader of Lougu Mountain was known as Qing Dan Yuan Jun. This title stemmed from his famous battle, where he used an unknown technique and talisman, instantly creating a billowing mist, the void appearing like calm water.</p><p>When the mist cleared, his enemy was dead, yet his complexion was rosy, unharmed, and looked like a living person.</p><p>Daoist disciples could also receive summons from the Daoist court.</p><p>Previously, Yun Wei and Qin Sang's competition for a summons was related to Qing Dan Yuan Jun.</p><p>He knew his master intended to cultivate a relationship with the alchemy master, Lingxu Daoshi, but he had no prior connection with him and a sudden visit would be presumptuous.</p><p>He happened to see this summons and wanted to obtain a token from Lingxu Daoshi to present to his master, making an introduction much easier. Unfortunately, he was no match for Qin Sang.</p><p>While talking to the two, Qin Sang observed the poison pearl within him.</p><p>After absorbing the strange energy, the poison pearl showed no change.</p><p>The strange energy had merged with the Bloodthirsty miasma poison within the pearl, but its unique energy signature hadn't disappeared.</p><p>It hadn't been assimilated by the Bloodthirsty miasma poison, and the amount of strange energy was minimal, suggesting that the strange energy was at least as powerful as the Bloodthirsty miasma poison.</p><p>After a moment's thought, Qin Sang asked, "Where were you attacked by this strange energy?"</p><p>Yun Wei and the female cultivator exchanged glances, hesitated, and then said, "We dare not deceive senior. We truly don't know the exact location. Master took us deep into the ritual grounds. Although we formed a protective formation, we could barely protect ourselves and didn’t dare to be distracted.  We were carried along by Master. The strange energy appeared suddenly. Master said it was triggered by a burst of golden light, touching some strange place, fleeting, and of unknown origin…"</p><p>Yun Wei added more details, perhaps intentionally.</p><p>His expression darkened. This time, it wasn’t just he and his junior sister who were brought here; there were other disciples.</p><p>Qing Dan Yuan Jun had brought his most talented disciples into danger to maintain a unique formation.</p><p>Unfortunately, the change came too suddenly, taking everyone by surprise.  The others couldn't withstand the strange energy and died instantly, leaving only him and his junior sister.</p><p>Lougu Mountain suffered heavy losses!</p><p>That's why, upon learning of the demons behind the turmoil, Qing Dan Yuan Jun flew into a rage and immediately accepted Wan Ren's invitation, wanting to personally take revenge.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded thoughtfully.</p><p>The ritual grounds of Gu Mountain were a truly mysterious place. Countless spells from ancient powerful beings were preserved in the present day as strange illusions, constantly challenging existing knowledge, making the existence of powerful poisons unsurprising.</p><p>Qin Sang tried to understand the strange energy's nature, but without success.</p><p>Thanks to the poison pearl given by the Fat Silkworm, Qin Sang gained the ability to neutralize and manipulate poison, but he wasn't an expert in this field, and he hadn’t planned to delve into it.</p><p>Analyzing this strange energy was too much to ask.</p><p>Even Qing Dan Yuan Jun, who was an expert in poisons, failed to protect his disciples from this energy, highlighting its strange nature.</p><p>He was indeed interested in this strange energy; having the poison pearl absorb more of it would enhance his own use of poison, as well as the power of the Heaven-Severing Soul-Destroying Needles.</p><p>Time slowly passed.</p><p>Qin Sang kept a part of his attention on the outside. After another hour, he finally saw a strange phenomenon!</p><p>Beyond the grey curtain, deep within the ritual grounds, a blinding light erupted.  Qin Sang abruptly stood, thinking it would cause turmoil in the ritual grounds like the previous golden light.</p><p>Yun Wei and the other cultivator watched Qin Sang anxiously, unaware of the situation outside.</p><p>After a few breaths, the light dissipated, and nothing unusual happened. Qin Sang's expression remained serious.</p><p>The light was likely caused by a battle between the two sides. To create such a spectacle deep within the ritual grounds, the battle must have been extremely fierce.</p><p>He also needed to prepare.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at Yun Wei and the other, clutching the Imperial Bell Talisman.</p><p>He had already checked; there was no wood spirit energy nearby, and without the True Fixation Pill or the divine ability of the Wood Spirit Body, his power was greatly diminished.</p><p>Fortunately, he had saved the Imperial Bell Talisman from the previous great battle, allowing him to retreat safely even in the face of this unforeseen event.</p><p>The expected situation did not occur.</p><p>After an incense stick's time, Qin Sang saw familiar遁光  approaching from afar, some bright, some dim—it was Zhang Zhenren and the others.</p><p>There were five of them in total.</p><p>Zhang Zhenren, Youhuang Zhenren, and Guyun Zhenren were all present, but Zhijian Zhenren was missing.</p><p>The other two were strangers, a man and a woman.</p><p>The man wore white robes and a feather fan, but his breath was somewhat disordered, marring his elegant appearance.</p><p>The woman was slender and beautiful, but her face was cold, her brows sharp with undisguised killing intent.</p><p>Confirming that no pursuers followed, Qin Sang quickly activated the talisman formation, welcoming the group inside.</p><p>"This woman must be Qingdan Yuanjun…"</p><p>Qin Sang swept his gaze over the woman, then looked at Zhang Zhenren, frowning and asking, "Where is Zhijian Zhenren?"</p><p>He noticed that Youhuang Zhenren and Guyun Zhenren, like the strange man, were breathing rapidly, their energy greatly depleted.</p><p>Guyun Zhenren's face was pale, showing he was injured.  After entering the stone pavilion, he didn't bother with greetings, immediately sitting cross-legged to recover his breath.</p><p>Only Zhang Zhenren, while also in poor condition, showed a hint of joy, as if he had gained something.</p><p>Zhang Zhenren said calmly, "Friend, don't worry, Zhijian Zhenren is unharmed; he's holding the rear…"</p><p>At this time, Qingdan Yuanjun had checked her disciple's injuries and learned from Yun Wei that Qin Sang had intervened.  Her expression softened, the killing intent fading from her pretty face. She went to Qin Sang, bowing and saying, "I am Qingdan. I thank Qingfeng Zhenren for saving my disciple."</p><p>"It was a simple matter, Yuanjun is too kind,"</p><p>Qin Sang replied, bowing calmly.</p><p>Seeing this, Qingdan Yuanjun relaxed her formality, introducing the man to Qin Sang.  This man's Daoist name was Boxian Shanren, a friend of Qingdan Yuanjun.</p><p>The two exchanged greetings.</p><p>Just then, a sword light streaked across the sky, arriving like a rainbow. Qin Sang hastily activated the talisman formation, welcoming Zhijian Zhenren into the stone pavilion.</p><p>With this, everyone except the two Daoist court officials and Moxing Dao had arrived.</p><p>"How did it go?"</p><p>Zhang Zhenren asked anxiously.</p><p>Zhijian Zhenren nodded. "We don't need to wait any longer. Let's retreat to the Golden Hall and meet up with the Daoist court people there."</p><p>Hearing this, everyone's expressions relaxed.</p><p>Qin Sang remained reserved, asking nothing about the battle's progress or outcome, observing coldly.</p><p>After a brief rest, they all flew out of the gray mist. Zhijian Zhenren and Zhang Zhenren led the way, protecting the injured in the middle, flying towards the edge of the altar.</p><p>The further they went, the more relaxed everyone became.</p><p>Brother and sister Yun Wei followed closely behind Qingdan Yuanjun. Seeing the situation ease, Yun Wei Zhenren used a secret technique, secretly communicating with his master.</p><p>Qingdan Yuanjun glanced at Qin Sang, a trace of surprise in her eyes.</p><p>She had assumed that Qin Sang had used powerful cultivation to forcibly remove the stubborn foreign energy from her disciple's body. Now she knew he had used a kind of poison-path secret technique to silently neutralize the energy.</p><p>Looking at Qin Sang, she thought to herself.  When they were close to the Nine-Curve Star River and danger was confirmed to be absent, she sent a voice transmission to Qin Sang, "Forgive my boldness, Zhenren, when you treated my disciple, did you notice anything special about that foreign energy?"</p><p>Qin Sang anticipated this question and said thoughtfully, "The amount of foreign energy was too small. I only know that my detoxification method had some effect. It should be a potent poison, but there's something strange about it that I couldn't see through or guess the origin of."</p><p>After a moment's hesitation, Qingdan Yuanjun said, "Could you please teach me your detoxification method? I'm willing to exchange treasures with you and will do my best to meet your requirements."</p><p>Before, Qin Sang could have asked Qingdan Yuanjun to teach him the inheritance methods of the Mole Cricket Mountain.</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head slightly, refusing. "This method is crucial to me; I must perform it myself.  It cannot be passed on; please don't blame me, Yuanjun."</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang's firm and unwavering attitude, Qingdan Yuanjun showed disappointment and fell into thought.</p><p>Soon, the Nine-Curve Star River appeared ahead.</p><p>Confirming that there were no abnormalities, everyone immediately crossed the river and successfully returned to the Golden Hall.</p><p>The Golden Hall was as it had been, very calm.</p><p>Zhang Zhenren threw a talisman into the sky, and then everyone slowly flew towards the exit of the Golden Hall, occasionally looking back.</p><p>Even when they neared the exit, they still didn't see the Daoist court officials. Remembering Hongyuzi's warning, they dared not leave on their own, and could only wait near the exit.</p><p>Half a day passed.</p><p>A figure appeared not far from where they were hiding.</p><p>Seeing who it was, Zhang Zhenren breathed a sigh of relief, "I thought the Venerable had met with an accident."</p><p>The arrival was Zhenru Venerable. After returning to the Golden Hall, he had found a hidden place to treat his injuries. He had received Zhang Zhenren's message and came to meet up.</p><p>Zhenru Venerable had just appeared and hadn't yet exchanged a few words when the Nine-Curve Star River suddenly stirred.</p><p>A brilliant red light pierced the starry sky, hurtling towards the Golden Palace exit with incredible speed.  The light resolved into a blazing chariot, incredibly ornate, drawn by a beast resembling a fiery rhinoceros, its presence awe-inspiring.  Its passage seemed to burn away even the void itself.</p><p>The flames formed a shimmering curtain, concealing the interior.  Everyone saw Wan Zhenren at the front of the chariot, controlling it.  Several figures were discernible within, presumably court officials, but no demons were visible.</p><p>The fiery chariot sped straight for the entrance, making no attempt to conceal itself.  As it approached, Qin Sang and the others revealed themselves.  The chariot didn't stop; Wan Zhenren's voice boomed, “Follow!”</p><p>They followed the chariot, passing into the auspicious clouds.  Soon they reached the cloud's edge; beyond lay the exit from the Jushan altar.  Their speed was incredible.  They burst from the clouds, flew across the plains, and in an instant arrived above the mountain range where they had previously hidden.</p><p>A sudden, inexplicable sense of dread washed over everyone.  Including the officials in the chariot, all eyes turned eastward in horrified recognition.  It was midday, the sky bright. Yet, a thick darkness rapidly spread across the eastern horizon.</p><p>“BOOM!”</p><p>“CRACK!”</p><p>…</p><p>As the darkness spread, thunder roared, lightning flashed, and a howling wind swept across the land. The earth trembled, radiant light burst forth in countless beams, and multicolored lights bloomed and exploded like celestial flowers.  The world's energy was violently disrupted by a terrifying force.</p><p>Then they saw it.  A colossal silhouette emerged from the darkness.  A gigantic black bird of prey, its feathers so dark they seemed to absorb light.  It flew towards them, its outstretched wings bringing with them a wave of encroaching darkness, blotting out the sun.</p><p>Everyone was stunned, their faces pale with fear.  Qin Sang's expression mirrored theirs.</p><p>“A Dharma Image!”</p><p>He recognized the aura emanating from the black demonic bird—the aura of a Dharma Image!  It wasn't the beast's true form, but a Dharma Image, albeit one incredibly substantial, almost real.  Both its power and the celestial phenomena it caused proved this demon to be a powerful cultivator in the Void Refinement stage!</p><p>“So, a Dharma Image is a Void Refinement cultivator's divine ability…”</p><p>Qin Sang realized why the demon lords he had encountered previously lacked Dharma Images, and why Qingluan's Dharma Image could withstand Li Hou's oppressive might. Hong Yuzi had been right—a Demon King truly blocked their path!</p><p>The darkness spread with terrifying speed, engulfing half the sky in moments. The black demonic bird seemed to dominate the heavens, looking down on them like insignificant ants.  Two piercing gazes, sharp as swords, pierced their hearts from within the darkness.</p><p>“Retreat!”</p><p>Zhang Zhenren cried out, wanting to return to the altar. But demon lords burst from the clouds, watching them with sneering contempt.</p><p>Suddenly, a cold snort echoed in everyone's minds, followed by an immense wave of pressure.  A torrent of spiritual energy surged towards them, faster even than the black demonic bird, possessing the power to obliterate everything.  The chariot remained motionless.</p><p>Then, a gale erupted around them.  The sky instantly filled with dark clouds and raging thunder.  The spiritual energy seemed to be drawn upwards, coalescing into a figure.  The figure, clad in Daoist robes and a Daoist crown, with a long white beard and eyebrows, stood amidst the wind and thunder, calmly gazing at the black demonic bird.</p><p>“It's the legendary Dharma Body!  Grand Master!”</p><p>Gu Yun Zhenren exclaimed, his face a mixture of awe and reverence.</p><p>Qin Sang felt the same.  This was a Dharma Body formed entirely of the world's true energy; the Grand Master's true body was unknown.</p><p>“Old monster, bullying the weak! Shame on you!” The Grand Master laughed heartily.</p><p>Two golden beams shot from the black demonic bird's eyes, like arrows.</p><p>The Grand Master smiled faintly and pointed a finger into the void.</p><p>“Whoosh!”</p><p>Myriad stars appeared in the sky, a celestial river descending from the Milky Way, blocking the spiritual tide, deflecting the golden beams, and erasing a mountain.</p><p>The black demonic bird snorted, its wings beating, sweeping away the demon lords.  The darkness slowly receded towards the horizon.</p><p>“Go now,”</p><p>The Grand Master said, his figure dissolving as the energy returned to the world, and the celestial phenomena vanished.</p><p>For a long time, the group remained stunned.  Though the mountainous terrain limited their view to a few hundred miles, they saw no remaining signs of the conflict. This implied that the Grand Master and the black demonic bird were hundreds of miles away, engaging in a long-range battle of Dharma Images and Dharma Bodies.</p><p>Qin Sang finally understood.  His previous assumptions had been too simplistic.  Void Refinement cultivators' actions were always accompanied by celestial phenomena, wind, and thunder.  But the absence of these phenomena didn't mean safety.</p>
