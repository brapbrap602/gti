<h1>Chapter 1178: The Jinchen Sword</h1><p>“Daoist Mingyue, this is one of the core control devices for the Cold Bell Formation.  Should the Enemy attack, use this treasure to adapt the formation's seventy-two variations according to the situation.  Knowing that only a few of your fellow demon cultivators are here as reinforcements, we hope to catch the Enemy off guard. Please try to avoid revealing yourself in the main camp to avoid being seen by spies and having news leaked.”</p><p>Jing Lin handed Qin Sang a blue bell, giving careful instructions.</p><p>They had brought Qin Sang in secretly earlier.</p><p>The bell was only the size of an adult fist, made from an unknown material, and was a bright ice blue, covered with densely packed runes inside and out.</p><p>Holding it, Qin Sang felt an icy chill.</p><p>After activating the secret technique Jing Lin had given him, Qin Sang could sense the intricate connection between the bell and the formation's energy, instantly comprehending its various changes.</p><p>The Cold Bell Formation was comprehensive, offering both defense and offense. Its most powerful attack was seventy-two hidden cold bells whose resonating sound waves created an invisible, intangible assault.</p><p>Of course, they wouldn't entrust the entire formation to Qin Sang's control.  His role was to use the bell to manipulate aspects of the formation, coordinating with them during battle.</p><p>Qin Sang then inquired about the recent situation and gained a general understanding.</p><p>There was an outpost in front of Sandie Pass; as long as the front line was secure, Sandie Pass would be safe for now.</p><p>“From now on, you will be stationed in the central command.  During normal times, you can simply cultivate within the tower.”</p><p>Jing Lin and the other took Qin Sang to a quiet room on the top floor of a tower, assigning him no additional duties.  This was as previously agreed.</p><p>The three of them chatted for a long time, discussing topics ranging from the Enemy and the Three Realms war, to worldly affairs, cultivation techniques, and even esoteric arts.</p><p>Qin Sang had been to the Canglang Sea, and Jing Lin and his companion had travelled to the Northern Star Desert during times of peace.  Both were well-traveled and knowledgeable, and they enjoyed a lively conversation.</p><p>Qin Sang learned a great deal from them, feeling that his trip had been worthwhile.</p><p>After their enjoyable conversation, the two took their leave.</p><p>“Daoist Si, please wait,” Qin Sang called out to Si Di.</p><p>Jing Lin tactfully took his leave.</p><p>Qin Sang stated his purpose, “Daoist, you are from the Taiyi Danzong. I wonder if there are any junior members of your sect in the camp who are skilled in alchemy. I need to refine a rather complex medicine, and I’d only trust a Taiyi Danzong alchemist with it. I am willing to offer a generous reward.”</p><p>He could have asked Li Yu Fu to make it.</p><p>But as the sole disciple of Yun Youzi, Li Yu Fu was left behind, so he had to ask an alchemist from Taiyi Danzong.</p><p>“Oh?  For a medicine like that, using a junior alchemist might be risky. I, though unskilled, have studied alchemy.  Not far east of Sandie Pass was once a large market of the Tianxing Alliance; it still has functioning furnaces.”</p><p>Si Di offered to do it himself.</p><p>Qin Sang waved his hand, “No need to trouble you, Daoist. Though the process is complex, the medicine is not of a high grade, and is not for me. A Golden Core stage alchemist should be capable.”</p><p>“I see.  My junior sister, Ong, happens to be in the camp. She’s exceptionally talented in alchemy and has received direct instruction from our master. I'll send for her.”</p><p>Si Di’s fingertip glowed, conjuring a small bird that flew out of the tower.</p><p>Moments later, a young Golden Core cultivator, a girl, arrived quickly.</p><p>“Senior Brother, you summoned me?”</p><p>Cultivator Ong greeted them politely. This was her first time meeting a demon king, and she was quite curious, especially about the wings on Qin Sang's back.</p><p>The beautiful phoenix wings were clearly quite impressive, captivating the young woman's attention with their beauty.</p><p>Si Di explained the situation, and Qin Sang presented the prescription.  After carefully examining it, the cultivator confidently accepted the task, saying she could begin once the ingredients arrived.</p><p>After seeing them off, Qin Sang closed the room and began to familiarize himself with the Cold Bell Formation.</p><p>That evening, Tan Yi'en reported that Tan Hao’s acquaintance was not there and he planned to search elsewhere.</p><p>“Go with him.”</p><p>Qin Sang summoned Fatty Chicken and gave the order.</p><p>It was somewhat dangerous for Tan Yi'en to travel between the various camps, but Fatty Chicken was skilled at concealment and disguise, and his strength was sufficient.</p><p>The stubborn pride that had once led Fatty Chicken to refuse to pledge allegiance seemed to have vanished. Since Qin Sang's Golden Core breakthrough, the chicken had become completely subservient, acting like a devoted lackey.</p><p>Fatty Chicken patted his chest, promising to bring the person back safely.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, a month had passed since Qin Sang arrived at Sandie Pass.</p><p>Over ten days ago, the ingredients were delivered, and Cultivator Ong had refined a bottle of Huorong Dan at the former market.</p><p>Qin Sang fed one pill to the Fire Jade Centipede every other day.</p><p>Unexpectedly, after only two Fire Melting Pills, the Fire Jade Centipede became restless, a clear sign of impending transformation. After the fourth pill, its body curled into a ball, spinning a crimson cocoon of light and falling into a deep sleep.</p><p>Qin Sang guessed that it was due to the previous consumption of Crimson Fire Gold; otherwise, the effect of the Fire Melting Pills wouldn't have been so immediate.</p><p>Holding the light cocoon, Qin Sang murmured an incantation, sending waves of restrictions into the cocoon, employing a secret technique of the Imperial Spirit Sect to subdue the Fire Jade Centipede.</p><p>Years of nurturing had made the Fire Jade Centipede unresistant to him, but only this method would truly bind it to him.</p><p>The secret technique neared completion.</p><p>A weak counterattack emanated from within the cocoon – the spirit insect's subconscious resistance, far weaker than when conscious. This is why performing the technique at this moment yielded the highest success rate.</p><p>Perhaps sensing Qin Sang's presence, the resistance quickly vanished, and the secret technique was successfully completed.</p><p>"The Fire Jade Centipede's potential certainly can't compare to the Sky Eye Butterfly, but it is a rare insect nonetheless. After its third transformation, it should be somewhat useful..."</p><p>Qin Sang gazed at the cocoon, recalling how even at its first transformation, the Fire Jade Centipede could sense the Crimson Gold Vine.  Even just improved treasure-finding abilities made it worth cultivating.</p><p>He didn't dare hope to possess another four-transformation spirit insect. The Sky Eye Butterfly's advancement was pure coincidence, impossible to replicate.</p><p>Putting away the cocoon, Qin Sang decided to leave the Three-Fold Pass and fly to the market town to personally refine a flying sword.</p><p>The market town was nestled within a valley, where the climate was perpetually spring-like. It was once large and renowned.</p><p>When the army arrived, everyone was forced to evacuate, leaving the market town deserted.</p><p>Qin Sang found a furnace room and took out the Golden Sinkwood and other spirit materials.</p><p>Over the past month, he had meticulously planned the process, which went smoothly. He refined a sword less than a foot long, shining golden like pure gold – a mid-grade flying sword. He named it the Golden Sink Sword.</p><p>With Golden Sinkwood as its primary material, and personally refined by Qin Sang, this sword felt more responsive than other spirit swords, making it an ideal substitute when the Ebony Sword was unusable.</p><p>"The flying sword is ready. Once the seven sword spirits fully merge with the seven souls, completing the first stage, it will unleash part of the Seven Souls Killing Array’s power, significantly enhancing the sword array’s might.  While the Abyss of Sin remains calm, I should prioritize cultivation..."</p><p>Qin Sang thought to himself, and returned to the Three-Fold Pass.</p><p>******</p>
