<h1>Chapter 2074: The Tainted River of Calamity</h1><p>Yuan Miao was slightly taken aback. Qin Sang had been completely on the defensive until now, which was perfectly normal. Faced with the relentless onslaught of the Zhuyan Clan, most cultivators could only barely parry the attacks. It wasn't that they didn't want to counterattack, but that they simply didn't have the opportunity.</p><p>Unexpectedly, his opponent had been holding back all along!</p><p>Only when the last word left Qin Sang's mouth, sounding almost right beside his ear, did Yuan Miao sense the imminent danger. A streak of azure lightning flashed into his vision, impossibly fast, as if piercing through the void in an instant. He reacted immediately, bringing his crimson demon staff across his chest.  The next moment, a ferocious impact slammed into him, like a collision with a mountain. His body trembled, and his vision went black.</p><p>Qin Sang’s spirit tablet, now like a massive stone slab, pressed down on him, firmly held back by the crimson demon staff. The two spirit treasures clashed violently, shaking the arena once more, and painting the battlefield with flickering, otherworldly light.</p><p>Yuan Miao, with his vast combat experience and sharp senses, had reacted instinctively and swiftly, barely managing to block the attack.  Had it been anyone else, even if they weren't defeated outright, they would likely have lost the initiative in an instant.</p><p>He channeled his vital essence, his arms shaking with force, pushing back the spirit tablet slightly. He retreated, attempting to regain his footing. Yet before he could stabilize himself, the pressure descended from above.</p><p>Helpless, Yuan Miao could only raise his staff to block once more.</p><p>With a resounding boom, he was slammed heavily onto the ground. Though he maintained his balance, his feet sank deep into the arena floor.</p><p>The Zhuyan Clan placed great importance on their arenas. Constructed from an incredibly hard spiritual material and inscribed with restrictive formations, further reinforced by a grand array, the arena had remained undamaged despite the fierce battle.  Now, however, two distinct footprints marred its surface.</p><p>Yuan Miao was about to repeat his tactic, but the spirit tablet merely brushed against his staff before retreating. The next attack came from behind before he could even shift his feet.  Forced to twist his demon staff awkwardly, he barely managed to deflect the blow.</p><p>The ensuing scene gave Si Lu and the others a sense of deja vu. They had just witnessed a similar exchange, only with the roles reversed.</p><p>Now it was Yuan Miao enduring the relentless barrage, seemingly only capable of defending.  His feet trapped in the ground, he couldn’t even pull them free, as Qin Sang hammered him down blow after blow, driving him deeper and deeper, his lower legs almost entirely submerged.</p><p>At this moment, Yuan Miao felt an overwhelming sense of frustration.  This was his preferred fighting style, yet his opponent was now using it against him.</p><p>Qin Sang's combat prowess was far more versatile than he had anticipated.  Being proficient in movement techniques was one thing, seamlessly integrating them into combat was another.</p><p>Especially in a clash between two strength cultivators, where every inch mattered, superior movement techniques didn't guarantee an advantage.  Misused, they could lead to imbalances and openings for the opponent to exploit, and Yuan Miao had been waiting for such a chance.</p><p>However, judging by Qin Sang's performance, such concerns were nonexistent. Qin Sang hadn't even employed any particularly advanced divine abilities or combat techniques, relying solely on his Thunder Movement and that spirit tablet to pin him down.</p><p>Yuan Miao had sensed Qin Sang forming the Great Vajra Wheel Seal, but he hadn't expected it to possess such power.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>Yuan Miao felt himself sink another inch.  He was like a wooden stake, and Qin Sang the one driving it into the ground.</p><p>This situation had to change!</p><p>Unable to find an opening, Yuan Miao was forced to create one himself. His mind raced, and the blood flames enveloping him erupted violently.</p><p>He abruptly looked up, hair standing on end, transforming into a raging inferno.</p><p>Within the blood flames, specks of crimson light coalesced at his brow, blossoming into a blood flower. After a series of strange transformations, it condensed into a small blood seal, which flashed into his forehead.</p><p>A low growl echoed across the battlefield, like the roar of an ancient demonic ape.</p><p>Ji Hong and the Zhuyan Clan expert felt their hearts pound, their own battle lust stirred.  The Zhuyan expert leaped up, squatting on his seat, scratching his ears and cheeks, his gaze fixed on the arena, itching to take Yuan Miao’s place.</p><p>Fortunately, he hadn't lost all reason.  He glanced at Ji Hong, his eyes filled with battle intent, eager to test his strength.</p><p>Sensing the danger, Ji Hong quickly hid beneath Si Lu's collar.</p><p>By now, the battlefield had transformed.  Yuan Miao's eyes snapped open, glowing crimson with a ferocious glint, as if he had truly become a demonic ape.</p><p>He pointed his crimson demon staff skyward. A streak of enchanting crimson light flickered across its surface before vanishing, instantly splitting into countless afterimages.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes narrowed.  To him, the phantom staffs ceased to exist, leaving only a single crimson demon staff thrusting straight towards his face.</p><p>This strike was strangely profound.  Qin Sang couldn't tell if Yuan Miao had predicted his movements or if the attack would have found him regardless of his position.</p><p>The moment he appeared, the crimson demon staff was already upon him, leaving no room to dodge!</p><p>Without hesitation, he broke off his attack, his phoenix wings flapping powerfully, pulling him away from the immediate danger.</p><p>A sharp gust of wind grazed his face.  Though Yuan Miao missed his mark, his objective was achieved.  He launched himself from the pit, flipping in midair, and pressed his attack.</p><p>Faced with the descending crimson demon staff, Qin Sang chose to evade once more.  This time, however, it was merely to create distance. He transformed into a streak of lightning, approaching Yuan Miao's flank from an incredibly sharp angle.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>Their weapons clashed, both figures trembling from the impact.  Qin Sang's eyes narrowed slightly. Yuan Miao's responses were noticeably sharper now. Before the power of the blood seal faded, suppressing him as before would be difficult.</p><p>As he pondered, Qin Sang's afterimage shattered under the demon staff. He reappeared elsewhere, launching another attack with his spirit tablet.</p><p>With each resounding clash, they were locked in combat once more, but this time, the battle wasn't confined to a single spot. Their figures flashed across the entire arena. Were it not for the confining spiritual array, they might have fought their way to the heavens.</p><p>Though Qin Sang continued to harass and attack relentlessly, his strategy had shifted.  No longer focused on suppressing his opponent, he maximized the advantage of his movement technique, seeking openings amidst the constant maneuvering.</p><p>Yuan Miao responded in kind.  He might not be able to catch Qin Sang, but Qin Sang would always come to him. As long as he reacted perfectly at the moment of impact, Qin Sang would be unable to gain any ground.</p><p>On the north side of the arena stood a peak, slightly shorter than the one they occupied, its arena correspondingly smaller.</p><p>At some point, the array on this smaller arena had also activated. However, it was unoccupied save for a single figure.</p><p>Clad in white robes, with golden pupils beneath, this figure stood with hands clasped behind his back, his gaze fixed on the battle across from him, golden light flickering within.</p><p>Even the grand array couldn't obstruct his view.  As he watched the fierce exchange, a strange light danced in his eyes.</p><p>Qin Sang and Yuan Miao seemed oblivious, their focus entirely on each other.  After a prolonged exchange, neither had managed to gain the upper hand, but both were searching for an opportunity.</p><p>‘Bang!’</p><p>Another clash, ending in a stalemate as before.  Their figures separated.</p><p>Suddenly, a glint flashed in Yuan Miao’s eyes.</p><p>An opportunity!</p><p>He had finally found one!</p><p>At the same moment, Qin Sang felt a strange premonition, a sense that something was amiss.  He glanced at Yuan Miao, who appeared normal, bathed in blood flames as before, yet the unsettling feeling persisted.</p><p>He was certain that the blood flames had undergone some kind of change, but he couldn't understand the cause.</p><p>The next instant, his eyes widened in surprise.  Behind Yuan Miao, two new heads had sprouted, identical to his own. Not only heads but arms as well, and even the crimson demon staff had tripled.</p><p>"Three Heads and Six Arms?"</p><p>Qin Sang immediately recognized the legendary technique, witnessing it firsthand.</p><p>The newly formed limbs appeared somewhat illusory, not yet fully solidified, yet Yuan Miao’s aura had surged to a new level.</p><p>‘Swish! Swish! Swish!’</p><p>Not giving Qin Sang time to analyze the technique, the three demon staffs thrust towards him simultaneously.</p><p>Three streaks of blood light tore through the void, each carrying enough power to level mountains.  As they approached Qin Sang, they merged into a single, earth-shattering staff shadow.</p><p>In that moment, the staff shadow enveloped every corner of the arena. Beneath it, all would be reduced to dust. Even with his exceptional movement technique, Qin Sang had nowhere to escape!</p><p>As the demon staff descended, Qin Sang’s expression hardened. He formed a hand seal, and a golden light erupted skyward, a golden sun rising behind his head.</p><p>The Sun Wheel Seal was a secret transmission of the Buddhist Vajra lineage. Its true essence lay in tempering the physical body through Dharma, but Qin Sang, cultivating both body and Dharma, had elevated its power to a new level.</p><p>Even without activating his Dharma Body, relying solely on his strength cultivation to activate the seal, its power was formidable.</p><p>The golden sun shone brightly, forcing back the surging blood energy.</p><p>A sense of foreboding gripped Yuan Miao, but he was already committed, unable to withdraw his attack.  Now, it was a matter of who was stronger!</p><p>The golden sun intercepted the demon staff, and the two immense forces collided.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>A blinding golden wave swept across the arena, engulfing Qin Sang, Yuan Miao, the golden sun, and the demon staff alike.</p><p>The arena was bathed in golden light.</p><p>The next moment, a crimson staff shadow appeared at the center of the golden light, like a crack on the surface of the golden sun.</p><p>Suddenly, both the golden sun and the staff shadow shattered. The residual waves remained immense, battering against the grand array.</p><p>A transparent barrier separated the viewing platform from the array.  Under the relentless assault, the barrier trembled, threatening to shatter, unleashing the golden waves upon the spectators.</p><p>Ji Hong retreated further into Si Lu’s collar, and the Zhuyan Clan expert shrank back, his battle lust completely extinguished.</p><p>The powerful residual waves persisted, punctuated by the sounds of further impacts from within, indicating that the battle had resumed.</p><p>Yuan Miao, still in his Three Heads and Six Arms form, wielded his demon staff impeccably, giving Qin Sang no opening, yet he couldn't overcome him either.</p><p>After exchanging several more blows, Yuan Miao abruptly deactivated his technique. He pushed off the ground, leaping out of the fray, exclaiming, "I concede! I concede!"</p><p>Qin Sang paused, his spirit tablet shrinking back to its original size, his phoenix wings folding as he slowly landed.</p><p>"I can't hurt you, but you might be able to hurt me!  I concede this time!  I'm not fighting anymore!"</p><p>Yuan Miao waved his hands repeatedly, his expression somewhat dejected.</p><p>Admittedly, the battle might have continued indefinitely without a clear victor, but as he said, Qin Sang had the potential to injure him, while he had yet to find a way to counter Qin Sang’s movement technique.</p><p>In that sense, it wasn’t entirely inaccurate to say he was slightly inferior.</p><p>The Zhuyan Clan valued combat, but once the situation became clear, they readily accepted defeat.  They wouldn't cling stubbornly to a losing battle.</p><p>Qin Sang smiled. "Fellow Daoist, you are too kind."</p><p>He had concealed his true strength, but this certainly wasn't the full extent of Yuan Miao's abilities either. Some techniques were simply unsuitable for use in the arena, as this wasn't a fight to the death.</p><p>"I'll find a way to counter your movement technique sooner or later!" Yuan Miao grumbled, still unwilling to accept defeat.</p><p>Qin Sang chuckled. He didn't dislike this kind of temperament. He cupped his hands. "I await your challenge, Fellow Daoist."</p><p>"Just you wait!"</p><p>Yuan Miao threw down a parting threat, flicking his sleeve and deactivating the spiritual array.</p><p>Si Lu flew over, his gaze filled with awe.  He knew that Qin Sang's true strength lay in his Dharma Body, yet he had managed to defeat Yuan Miao relying solely on strength-based techniques.</p><p>Ji Hong’s eyes shone with admiration, his small face beaming with adoration.  "Qin Huwei, you're so strong!"</p><p>"I keep my word. From now on, aside from a few forbidden areas of our clan, the three of you are free to come and go as you please. No one will trouble you…"</p><p>Yuan Miao flicked his sleeve, sending three streaks of light flying towards them. They transformed into three crimson jade tokens.</p><p>"Thank you, Fellow Daoist Yuan."</p><p>The three sensed Yuan Miao's aura on the jade tokens and expressed their gratitude, each storing their token away.</p><p>Yuan Miao glanced towards the mountains beyond. "As we agreed, there are many dangerous places near our clan. Even the tribes living nearby rarely approach them.  If you venture into those areas and perish, you can't blame anyone but yourselves."</p><p>"Thank you for the warning, Fellow Daoist. We understand the risks," Si Lu replied respectfully.</p><p>Seeing their expressions, Yuan Miao knew they hadn't taken his words to heart.  He snorted.  "Don't think I'm exaggerating. Our territory is unlike any other. To the east, there is a place where tainted energy gathers. Do not approach it."</p><p>Hearing this, Ji Hong and Si Lu remained indifferent, but Qin Sang's eyes flickered. "Tainted energy?"</p><p>Yuan Miao nodded. "The origin of this energy is unknown, but it can taint all things, leaving nothing untouched. It is extremely dangerous for cultivators like us.  Its intensity fluctuates. While it may seem calm during its ebb, once the tainted energy surges, it consumes everything. Even Grand Cultivators may not emerge unscathed!"</p><p>Taints all things, leaving nothing untouched…</p><p>The more Qin Sang listened, the more he felt that this tainted energy resembled the Six Heavens Resentful Qi within the River of Calamity.</p><p>He had journeyed across several celestial provinces in the Great Thousand World, yet he had never heard any rumors of the River of Calamity's presence.</p><p>He suspected that the River of Calamity might exist in another form, hidden from the world, imperceptible to ordinary cultivators, detectable only by Grand Cultivators.</p><p>Could this be a manifestation of a section of the River of Calamity?</p><p>Qin Sang had always suspected that the Abyss of the Storm Realm might be located above the River of Calamity.  If so, the emergence of the Storm Realm, expelled by the River of Calamity and landing here, would make sense.</p><p>"I've said all I need to say. You are free to go!"</p><p>Yuan Miao waved his sleeve, gesturing for them to leave.</p><p>Qin Sang and Si Lu exchanged a glance. It would be inappropriate to inquire further, so they cupped their hands and took their leave.</p><p>As their figures disappeared among the mountains, Yuan Miao withdrew his gaze and looked towards the adjacent peak.  His figure flickered, and he vanished into the mountain, asking, "When did Brother Yuan arrive?"</p>
