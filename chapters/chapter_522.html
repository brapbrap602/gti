<h1>Chapter 515 A So-Called Opportunity?</h1><p>“Forget it!” Qin Sang shook his head. He had no interest in sightseeing inside a corpse pouch anyway.</p><p>The *Tianyin Corpse Manual* described two types of containers for refined corpses. The first half of the manual only mentioned coffins used by low-level disciples. These were too conspicuous, requiring one to carry a large coffin on their back, making it hard to go unnoticed.</p><p>However, even ordinary corpse pouches were difficult to acquire. The vast majority of corpse-refining cultivators used this method to store their refined corpses.</p><p>This included the Verdant Sun Sect disciple who bought his refined corpse. They would typically purchase a coffin artifact after acquiring a corpse.</p><p>Qin Sang had anticipated this and prepared a coffin in advance.  His earlier meticulous preparations were also to address this situation.</p><p>He set the coffin upright.</p><p>Qin Sang opened the lid and stepped inside.</p><p>The coffin flashed with black light, shrinking until it perfectly fit his body.</p><p>Qin Sang tested it, then stepped out and returned to his previous meditation spot. He opened his storage pouch and retrieved the jade box containing Jiupao Daoren's Gold Core.</p><p>He planned to complete the first two steps of refining the Sky-Soaring Nightfiend here: Core Integration and Core Fusion.</p><p>He intended to infiltrate the Verdant Sun Sect disguised as a corpse refiner.</p><p>Aside from the Ebony Sword hidden within his Nascent Soul and the little-known Void Thunder, he couldn't bring any external possessions.</p><p>The Ten Yama Formation, the Ten Yama Banners…</p><p>Even the Nine Dragons Chariot Talisman within his dantian had been retrieved and stored in his storage pouch, to be hidden near the Verdant Sun Sect's entrance before he entered.</p><p>He would be entering the sect practically naked, and no amount of caution was excessive.</p><p>If the Sky-Soaring Nightfiend hadn't been severely injured, he would have had a greater chance of success. But opportunities were fleeting, and he couldn't wait indefinitely for the Nightfiend to recover.</p><p>Even after all this time, Jiupao Daoren's Gold Core remained exquisite and captivating, as if still alive, radiating a strange light.</p><p>Qin Sang undid the jade box's restrictions and grasped the Gold Core.</p><p>Of these two steps, Core Integration was the most dangerous. His dantian might be unable to withstand the impact of the Gold Core, leading to Qi Sea instability, physical collapse, and ultimately, explosive death.</p><p>Qin Sang held the Gold Core, sensing the power fluctuations emanating from it, while recalling the details of his previous refinement of the Sky-Soaring Nightfiend.</p><p>He clearly remembered that the most perilous moment last time was during the Earthly煞 Core Infusion stage. But that was a later concern; his current priority was infiltrating the Verdant Sun Sect.</p><p>Although the Core Integration process had its challenges, it was relatively smooth.  Now, performing it on himself should be even easier to control.</p><p>The second step, Core Fusion, would be even simpler and the least of his worries.</p><p>While contemplating, Qin Sang continued to familiarize himself with the Gold Core.</p><p>In fact, he had been doing so ever since obtaining it. Therefore, it didn't take long before he was slowly guiding the Gold Core towards his abdomen.</p><p>During this process, Qin Sang activated the restrictions on his body, establishing a connection between himself and the Gold Core, reducing its rejection.</p><p>Time slowly passed, and the Gold Core drew closer to Qin Sang's dantian.</p><p>A familiar scene unfolded. The Gold Core gradually became enveloped by the restrictions. Initially, it resisted, but with time, it gradually calmed.</p><p>"Enter," Qin Sang sighed, pressing the Gold Core against his dantian.</p><p>*Whoosh…*</p><p>A surge of Earthly煞 Qi erupted as the Gold Core sank within.</p><p>A sharp pain suddenly struck.</p><p>Qin Sang furrowed his brow, enduring the agony. Only when the chaos within his dantian reached its peak, nearing the point of collapse, did he withdraw the Gold Core with a thought.</p><p>Experienced and patient, he repeated the process, meticulously observing the changes. Since it was his own body, progress was much faster than when refining Yu Hua.</p><p>Finally, the Gold Core fully entered his Qi Sea, settling firmly in its center.</p><p>At this moment, the Gold Core suddenly unleashed a terrifying power, instantly sweeping outwards.</p><p>No wonder even the deceased Yu Hua had cried out in apparent agony at this stage.  The pain was indeed unbearable.</p><p>Prepared, Qin Sang spread his hands, immediately grabbing two items: a handful of spirit pills in one hand and the Lesser Yin Magnetic Bottle in the other.</p><p>He focused all his energy on suppressing the Gold Core, consuming spirit pills to replenish his spiritual power and using the Lesser Yin Magnetic Bottle to replenish his Earthly煞 Qi.</p><p>Everything went smoothly. The chaos gradually subsided, and the Gold Core's radiance receded, suspended within his Qi Sea.</p><p>Qin Sang breathed a sigh of relief, noting that his spirit pills and the Earthly煞 Qi within the Lesser Yin Magnetic Bottle were both about seventy to eighty percent depleted. Fortunately, due to the substitution of Heavenly罡 Qi for half the requirement, the Earthly煞 Qi consumption during the subsequent Core Infusion stage would be significantly reduced, requiring less preparation.</p><p>An hour later, Qin Sang proceeded to the next step: Core Fusion.</p><p>Looking inwards at his Qi Sea, as Qin Sang focused his mind, the Gold Core slowly rotated, seemingly intimately connected to him. But Qin Sang knew this was an illusion created by the restrictive constraints; he couldn't actually control the Gold Core.</p><p>Finally finished, Qin Sang noticed daylight streaming through the cave entrance; it was early morning.</p><p>After checking himself and confirming the Gold Core wouldn't rebel for now, Qin Sang left the cave. He looked back, meticulously erasing all traces of his presence, and then headed straight for the Verdant Sun Sect.</p><p>On the way, he took out two storage pouches.</p><p>One was his own, containing valuable treasures such as the Ten Yama Banners, which he planned to hide near the Verdant Sun Sect.</p><p>The other was prepared in advance.  Apart from the Void Thunder, it contained Lesser Yin Magnetic Bottles, artifacts, spirit stones, spirit pills, and other items of decent quality, roughly equivalent to the possessions of a mid-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator.</p><p>Having lost his Sword Qi Thunder Sound divine ability, Qin Sang felt uneasy. After much deliberation, he decided to bring the Void Thunder as a precaution.</p><p>The Void Thunder appeared inconspicuous.  Unless activated, it was simply a gray bead, its surface lightning not constantly visible.</p><p>Qin Sang tossed the Void Thunder into a pile of miscellaneous items within the storage pouch, among similar-looking beads. It had been a long time since the Void Spirit Sect had refined any Void Thunder, and even their own disciples might not recognize it, let alone outsiders.</p><p>Such powerful artifacts were becoming legendary. Had it not been for Granny Jing's guidance, Qin Sang wouldn't have recognized it either.</p><p>In addition, there was a jade slip containing the Corpse Refining techniques of the Heavenly Corpse Sect, albeit heavily altered by Qin Sang.</p><p>[Get Red Packet] Cash or point red packets have been sent to your account!

Even without mentioning the hidden dangers, anyone who obtained the technique would be suspicious. Qin Sang couldn't stall indefinitely, and the Pseudo Core Formation realm was acceptable.</p><p>Indeed, he didn't plan to sell himself in the marketplace; there were too many variables.</p><p>He intended to gift a "opportunity" to a Verdant Sun Sect disciple!</p><p>With the storage pouch ready, Qin Sang retrieved the prepared corpse of the Kui Yin Sect remnant.</p>
