<h1>Chapter 1106: Clues</h1><p>Chapter 1106: Clues</p><p>Passing by Yinshan Pass, Qin Sang recalled the Tan brothers and Shi Hong.</p><p>Years ago, Qin Sang gave the Heavenly Corpse Talisman and an ice coffin, helping Tan Hao keep Tan Jie alive.  Who would have guessed he'd repeat the same scenario in the Canglang Sea?</p><p>A century has passed;  it's unknown how many old friends are still alive.</p><p>Shi Hong, having dispersed her cultivation and started anew, even with her dual-spiritual root talent, is unlikely to achieve much.</p><p>Qin Sang expected to find only a tomb.</p><p>As for Tan Hao, if he failed to form his golden core, his life is nearing its end.</p><p>The difficulty for independent cultivators in gathering resources is unimaginable for disciples of established sects.</p><p>I wonder if he's still here?</p><p>The cave abode is deep within the Ten Thousand Mountains, a desolate snow mountain, in a remote location.</p><p>Finding the place from memory, Qin Sang discovered the cave remained hidden, even protected by a spiritual array of considerable power. Intrigued, he sent a stream of True Qi towards the array.</p><p>“Who’s there!”</p><p>The array fluctuated.</p><p>Moments later, a cautious shout came from within the cave.</p><p>Qin Sang frowned slightly. The voice didn't sound like Tan Hao's.  After a moment’s thought, he called out, “This was originally the cave abode of an old friend of mine, Daoist Tan Hao. I wonder if you are still within?”</p><p>“You know my father?”</p><p>The cultivator inside responded in surprise.</p><p>Qin Sang could feel a faint gaze scrutinizing him, but he remained unfazed and asked, “Are you a descendant of Daoist Tan?”</p><p>“I am Tan Yi'en. Since you know the location of this cave abode and specifically asked for my father, you must have a deep connection with him. However, my father’s old friends, most of whom I've met with him, were never mentioned by him…”</p><p>Tan Yi'en hesitated.</p><p>He didn't recognize Qin Sang and dared not invite him in.</p><p>At this time, although Qin Sang wasn't wearing a mask, he had altered his appearance using secret techniques.</p><p>“Tan Yi’en…”</p><p>Qin Sang silently repeated Tan Hao's descendant's name, feeling somewhat sentimental.  He said, “My surname is Qin. I and your father were fellow disciples, both under the Kuiyin Sect…”</p><p>“Qin… You are Master Uncle Qin!”</p><p>Before Qin Sang could finish, Tan Yi'en exclaimed in shock.</p><p>Immediately, a passage opened in the array, and a figure hurried out—a strong man, a spitting image of Tan Hao.</p><p>Qin Sang examined him.</p><p>Tan Yi’en, who possessed mid-stage Foundation Establishment cultivation, shared some resemblance to Tan Hao in his brow, but his features were more refined, reminding Qin Sang of another old friend—Shi Hong.</p><p>“Master Uncle Qin, your kindness to our family is beyond measure. My father and mother often reminded me never to forget your kindness! I apologize for my discourtesy in keeping you out. Please forgive me!”</p><p>Tan Yi’en, voice trembling with emotion, bowed deeply to Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang waved his sleeve, preventing Tan Yi'en from bowing further.  “No need for such ceremony! So, your mother is Senior Sister Shi Hong?”</p><p>Tan Yi'en nodded repeatedly, inviting Qin Sang into the cave abode with extraordinary respect.</p><p>Shi Hong chose not to return to her hometown, remaining to cultivate, cared for by Tan Hao.</p><p>Unexpectedly, it led to a marriage.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded slightly, stepping inside to find the cave greatly changed, now more suitable for living and cultivation.</p><p>He looked around, sensing no other presence, and asked with a frown, “Are you alone here? The last time I saw your parents was a century ago. Are they still alive?”</p><p>Tan Yi'en's eyes darkened.  “My mother passed away a century ago…”</p><p>He led Qin Sang into the inner chamber, where he saw Shi Hong's spirit tablet.</p><p>Hearing Tan Yi'en recount Shi Hong's experiences, it matched Qin Sang's expectations.</p><p>After dispersing her cultivation, Shi Hong didn't give up.</p><p>However, human effort cannot defy fate.  Even with Tan Hao's help, after many years of hard cultivation, she only reached the eighth layer of Qi Condensation and could progress no further, making Foundation Establishment hopeless.</p><p>Tan Hao and Shi Hong depended on each other, eventually falling in love and marrying, giving birth to Tan Yi'en.</p><p>“Is Tan Hao still alive?”</p><p>Qin Sang didn’t see Tan Hao's spirit tablet, nor the ice coffin.</p><p>Tan Yi'en hesitated. “My father was wholeheartedly dedicated to saving my uncle.  He supposedly found some clues, and after helping me reach Foundation Establishment, he left with my uncle. Shortly after, he sent a letter through a merchant guild, and then disappeared without a trace.”</p><p>“Clues? What clues?”</p><p>Qin Sang's expression changed, and he pressed for more details.</p><p>Before leaving, he had mentioned to Tan Hao the Heavenly Corpse Talisman and its connection to the Heavenly Corpse Sect.</p><p>Years ago, Qin Sang spent many years investigating the Heavenly Corpse Sect in Qingyang City, but found nothing. Did Tan Hao discover some leads about the Heavenly Corpse Sect?</p><p>“My father once said that waking my uncle was his sole responsibility, that he couldn't burden his descendants. He rarely spoke of these matters to us younger ones, only dropping hints…”</p><p>Tan Yien frowned, trying to recall.</p><p>After Qin Sang prompted him, he recounted Tan Hao's experiences.  Tan Hao had actually managed to reach the Golden Core stage!</p><p>“After the war began, my father voluntarily joined the battlefield, fighting valiantly and facing countless life-or-death situations. He earned significant merit, securing rewards from the alliance of the two regions. Before he left, my father was only at the Pseudo-Golden Core stage.  His letter mentioned that he eventually achieved Golden Core…”</p><p>Tan Yien spoke softly.</p><p>Tan Hao never mentioned his battlefield experiences to him, and Tan Yien knew few details.  But Qin Sang could imagine the perilous situations Tan Hao had survived.</p><p>Back then, Qin Sang had participated in the conflict between Xiaohan Region and the Tianxing League. That conflict, while significant, was far smaller and less brutal than this war, yet Qin Sang faced danger repeatedly.</p><p>Tan Hao, as a lone cultivator with no sect to support him, had single-handedly emerged from the carnage!</p><p>Only he knew the hardships he endured.</p><p>Some rejoiced, others grieved.  War brings disaster, but it also presents opportunities for certain cultivators.</p><p>The most famous legend revolves around the current leader of the Qingyang Demon Sect.  When Qin Sang infiltrated the Qingyang Demon Sect to steal the Qingyang Divine Gang, the Sect Leader was only at the late Golden Core stage; the Sect was in decline.  It was believed he had little chance of reaching the Nascent Soul stage.</p><p>But when war arrived, the Qingyang Demon Sect Leader somehow gained a great opportunity, quickly rising to prominence, achieving remarkable feats and eventually breaking through to Nascent Soul.  Afterwards, he led the Qingyang Demon Sect to become a major force in the demonic path, restoring its former glory.</p><p>Tan Hao's story was similar.  He was always a lone cultivator, without a sect to protect him. His only course of action was to risk his life to gain merit and acquire the resources needed to achieve the Golden Core stage.</p><p>Qin Sang hadn’t yet met Mei Gu, but she likely had a similar experience.</p><p>“In his letter, Father said he would leave Xiaohan Region and infiltrate the Sinful Abyss to search for clues. He warned us younger ones to focus on our cultivation and not be distracted…”</p><p>Tan Yien said, presenting Tan Hao’s letter.</p><p>After reading it, Qin Sang fell into deep thought.</p><p>So, the Heavenly Corpse Sect's headquarters wasn't in Xiaohan Region?  That explained why he'd never found it!</p><p>Qin Sang had only operated in Xiaohan Region and had never even visited the Tianxing League.  Tan Hao, having encountered Tianxing League and Sinful Abyss cultivators on the battlefield, might have discovered something.  Unexpectedly, a lead on the Heavenly Corpse Sect came from Tan Hao.</p><p>Qin Sang asked Tan Yien to carefully recall every word Tan Hao had said.</p>
