Chapter 1820: Allies


Within the tranquil void, clusters of green light drifted.

The green light was faint, a reflection from the smooth surface of palm-sized leaves, tightly layered and bound together into spheres.

The entire void held only these objects, these leaves like rootless duckweed, floating in the emptiness.

The leaves were hollow inside, interwoven with branches harder than steel, creating a space within large enough to hold several people, like individual cages.

Currently, none of these cages held prisoners.

It was these 'cages' that provided Wood Spirit Power, sustenance for a body crafted from spiritual wood.

Qin Sang returned here with the Kingfisher, flying to a 'cage' in the center, surveying the area before making a hand seal.

Immediately, strange glimmers flashed within some of the green spheres, revealing the formation flags Qin Sang had previously placed.

He had already set a net of heaven and earth, waiting for Hong Yuzi to enter the trap.

Glancing sideways at the Kingfisher, it remained motionless, like a dead object.

Qin Sang sat cross-legged atop the 'cage', closing his eyes in meditation, patiently biding his time.

Elsewhere, Hong Yuzi and Mo Xingdao were traversing illusions, heading towards the last place they had reached, the illusion that had caused Hong Yuzi's injury.

At the same time, Xiahou and Qingfei both entered the Ju Mountain Altar, passing through the Nine-Bend Star River.

Only Qingfei knew the location of the Postnatal Spiritual Treasure. With her leading the way, Xiahou followed closely.

The two demons quickly passed through layers of illusions. If Hong Yuzi and Mo Xingdao were to see their trajectory, they would be greatly alarmed, for the two demons were heading in the exact same direction as they were.

Moreover, their speed was faster, as if they were pursuing them.

Although Qingfei's cultivation was inferior to Xiahou's, she was still a mid-Nascent Soul demon, stronger than Mo Xingdao.

Places Mo Xingdao considered dangerous and deliberately avoided, Qingfei and Xiahou could charge through directly.

Qingfei was clearly very familiar with this place. She could avoid any danger in time and warn Xiahou.

Xiahou was the most relaxed. Occasionally lending a hand, he leisurely followed, admiring Qingfei's alluring figure.
…
"We've arrived."

Passing through a belt of shattered stones, Mo Xingdao stopped and turned to address Hong Yuzi, his voice filled with fatigue.

Before them, golden light shimmered.

Atop a boulder larger than a mountain, devoid of vegetation, stood eight golden pillars.

Golden dragons were carved on the surface of the pillars, lifelike, as if they could come alive and leap out at any moment.

Each pillar was the same height, seventy-seven times four point nine meters. The tops of the pillars were flat, forming a circular platform.

In fact, the golden dragons could indeed come alive.

This was where they had last been defeated.

The deeper one went into the altar, the more dangerous it became. However, there were also some peaceful and serene places, stable after years of evolution, that could serve as resting spots.

This was one such place. Last time, they had each chosen a golden pillar to meditate upon. When the golden light burst forth, the golden dragons had suddenly awakened, roaring and clawing their way out.

In an instant, a terrifying aura filled the air.

Amidst the dragons' roars, the pillars erupted with astonishing sword energy, as if they were not eight pillars, but eight peerless divine swords.

The sudden change had caught them off guard. If not for Hong Yuzi's protection, Mo Xingdao would have been torn apart by the chaotic swords, and Hong Yuzi himself had been gravely injured.

Now, the pillars and dragons had returned to their original state, and the place had become peaceful once more.

Only they knew what lurked beneath the tranquility.

The two stared at the golden pillars, confirming that the dragons hadn't revived. Mo Xingdao breathed a sigh of relief and sat down at the edge of the boulder to meditate.

Even though there was no sign of danger, he dared not approach the pillars again.

Mo Xingdao was greatly depleted. He had relied on Hong Yuzi's assistance to pass through the last few illusions. He would have faced considerable difficulty on his own.

Hong Yuzi stood beside Mo Xingdao with his hands clasped behind his back, patiently waiting for him to recover, his gaze fixed on the golden pillars, as if trying to unravel their secrets.

However, they were not here for the pillars, so Hong Yuzi didn't act rashly.

After a while, Mo Xingdao gradually recovered.

He wasn't injured, merely exhausted.

"Fellow Daoist Mo, have you discovered anything new?" Hong Yuzi asked as Mo Xingdao opened his eyes.

Mo Xingdao stood up, his gaze sweeping past the eight golden pillars towards the rear.

Behind them, there were black and white auras, like vast black and white clouds converging, their boundaries distinct.

Clearly, there were two illusions ahead, and they happened to be at the intersection of these two illusions.

Mo Xingdao gazed for a moment, then shook his head slightly, pointing at the white cloud. "Let's proceed according to our previous plan. I'll have to trouble you, Fellow Daoist."

Venturing deeper, without understanding the illusions, with his cultivation, he wouldn't get far.

Hong Yuzi had to personally act, while he provided support.

Hong Yuzi simply said, "Alright," and with a thought, a talisman materialized, transforming into a streak of light that flew towards Mo Xingdao.

Mo Xingdao remained where he was, accepting it calmly. Moments later, a suit of silver armor appeared on his body.

His puppet body was already robust, and with the added talisman armor, it was sufficient to handle most dangers.

Hong Yuzi didn't don any armor himself, but took out a horsetail whisk and gently waved it forward.

Dust like stardust drifted up, forming a faint path of light before them, leading into the depths of the white cloud.

They proceeded along the path, one after the other.

Within these illusions, even Hong Yuzi couldn't charge recklessly. He sometimes used various treasures and talismans to probe, sometimes pausing in thought.

Proceeding in this stop-and-go manner, they passed through three illusions, relatively unscathed.

Throughout, Mo Xingdao remained silent, his dark eyes occasionally glancing at Hong Yuzi, without any deliberate guidance, seemingly having forgotten his agreement with Qin Sang.

At this time, Qingfei and Xiahou also arrived, spotting the boulder and the eight golden pillars.

"Not bad, we can return here to rest if there's trouble ahead."

Xiahou confirmed that there was no danger here, somewhat surprised, and immediately flew to the top of a golden pillar.

Qingfei, however, remained below, as if she had noticed something amiss. Her brows furrowed slightly as she paced back and forth around the pillars, finally stopping at the edge of the white cloud, standing there for a long while.

Xiahou was drawn by Qingfei's odd behavior, asking in confusion, "Fellow Daoist, have you discovered something? Have we come to the wrong place?"

Qingfei shook her head without a word, her figure flashing as she rushed directly into the white cloud illusion.

Xiahou frowned deeply, and could only follow.

Qin Sang remained oblivious to everything, still waiting for his fish to bite.
…
Deep within the altar.

A magnificent palace stood silently amidst the illusions, empty and deathly quiet within.

The palace was likely conjured by some divine ability, as it was too complete, with carved beams and painted rafters, eaves and corners, even the outer walls without a single blemish, as if newly built.

'Boom!'

The back wall of the palace suddenly trembled violently, cracks running through it, and then that section collapsed with a thunderous roar.

Hong Yuzi and Mo Xingdao emerged from the dust and smoke.

"Eh? Unexpectedly, there's such an open space deep within the altar. Rare! Rare! Fellow Daoist Mo, look, does this seem familiar?" Hong Yuzi raised his whisk, pointing ahead.

Deep within the altar, the illusionary spaces were disordered, not on a single plane, but intersecting and even overlapping.

Beyond the wall was a vast expanse of auspicious clouds. The view here was excellent, allowing them to see the multicolored lights shimmering ahead, the manifestations of various illusions.

Mo Xingdao's eyes flashed. This was the moment he had been waiting for. He took a step forward, staring ahead, pretending to carefully discern the illusions, sometimes even bowing his head in thought, comparing them with the fragments of his memory.

"Let's explore…that one first!"

Mo Xingdao raised his hand, pointing towards the illusion emitting a crimson light on the right, his tone feigning hesitation.

This way, Hong Yuzi wouldn't be suspicious.

As expected, Hong Yuzi didn't suspect anything and immediately flew towards the illusion Mo Xingdao had indicated.

Not long after the two had left, the gap in the palace's back wall repaired itself, but soon trembled again, cracking once more.

Qingfei and Xiahou emerged from the opening.

Qingfei's expression was incredibly serious, her eyes filled with gravity, yet her beauty remained undiminished, carrying a unique allure.

Xiahou also sensed something was wrong, waiting for Qingfei's explanation.

Qingfei glanced around, sighing, "Indeed! We're too late."

Xiahou's frown deepened. "Shouldn't you give this Marquis an explanation, Fellow Daoist? You said only you knew the location of that Postnatal Spiritual Treasure. Could it be that you were deceiving this Marquis?!"

Judging by Qingfei's tone, the treasure had been taken by someone else.

Xiahou's eyes flashed with killing intent.

The demoness beside him was a rare beauty, a unique enchantress. Xiahou had long harbored the desire to take her as his own.

But if she dared to deceive him, he wouldn't hesitate to eliminate her!

Qingfei's expression changed several times before she spoke in a low voice, "Have you forgotten? I mentioned it before. The ancient treasures within the altar, those that remain to this day, are all deeply hidden, difficult to find. Back then, I was following a human cultivator, and that's how I learned of the treasure's location. Otherwise, I wouldn't have ventured so far without reason."

"Him?" Xiahou stared intently at Qingfei, the killing intent in his eyes receding slightly, but suspicion remained. "You said that person died in the altar."

"That person only had early Hollow Profound cultivation. Back then, he escaped severely injured. Logically, he shouldn't have been able to leave the altar alive. I never expected him to survive," Qingfei sighed. "Man proposes, but Heaven disposes. Not only has he survived until now, but he's also brought help, clearly also seeking this treasure. I'm proficient in tracking and tracing. I sensed two people's auras in the golden pillar space. They stayed there for a long time. One of them is very familiar, it should be him, and the other…is very strong!"

"How strong?" Xiahou sneered.

"What if it's late Hollow Profound?" Qingfei said seriously. "Moreover, there might not be just two of them here."

Late Hollow Profound True People mostly came from Immortal Sects, either sect masters or high-ranking officials of the Dao Court.

Such figures often had numerous followers.

Xiahou's sneer vanished. He was well aware of his shortcomings. He didn't fear a late Hollow Profound True Person, but if the opponent brought their subordinates, openly declaring their presence, he could only retreat.

However, if the opponent had brought so many people, they would have already taken the treasure. Why wait until now?

Qingfei continued, "That treasure is stored within a peculiar hall. Back then, when I entered the hall with that person, we began to fight. Although I severely injured and repelled him, I also suffered backlash, rendering me unable to retrieve the treasure. However, I used the surrounding illusions to conceal the hall. That person only knows the general location, and he probably hasn't found the exact position of the hall yet, and is still searching nearby."

Xiahou let out an "Oh," suddenly understanding. "In that case, let's ignore them. We'll take the treasure directly, and let them continue their search."

"No!"

Qingfei exclaimed anxiously, "The hall is peculiar and difficult to enter. Forcing our way in will definitely cause a huge commotion. Even with the layers of illusions blocking it, even if they don't notice, they will sense it through the key to the hall and track us down."

"Key?" Xiahou snorted. "Fellow Daoist didn't mention needing a key before!"

Qingfei explained, "Because the key is in that person's hands. I originally thought it would have been lost within some illusion along with him, impossible to find. We can break the ancient restrictions and enter the hall without the key, but it's inevitably dangerous. The worst scenario is that they track us down before we open the hall and take advantage of the situation to ambush us, leaving us empty-handed after doing all the work for them."

Xiahou understood the implication, scrutinizing Qingfei. "You're thinking…"

Qingfei nodded. "Before they find the treasure, they definitely won't leave. No matter what, we have to find a way to hinder them."

With that, Qingfei searched the area, returning to say, "There are indeed only two people's auras here."

Based on the auras they had detected, that late Hollow Profound expert hadn't brought any helpers.

Seeing that Qingfei seemed sincere, Xiahou began to seriously consider the situation. "The enemy is in the open, and we are in the dark. With our combined strength, killing that person shouldn't be difficult. The only concern is whether the key is still in his possession."

Qingfei agreed, "Fellow Daoist, you can hold off that late Hollow Profound expert, while I deal with the other person. This time, we will definitely capture him. If we can't get the key, we can only try to trap that expert and break the restriction to retrieve the treasure before he escapes. However, if Fellow Daoist has a way to kill that expert…"

She paused, looking at Xiahou.

Xiahou remained silent.

He was still unsure of the other person's identity.

If that human expert cultivated the Golden Seal Altar, he naturally wouldn't be afraid.

If it was an Immortal Official of the Dao Court, there was a high chance they cultivated the Army and Horse Altar. Once the formation was deployed, he would also have to retreat.

Of course, he and Qingfei were in the dark, able to strike unexpectedly, without giving the opponent a chance to deploy their formation.

Still, regardless of the opponent's identity, there was considerable risk.

Killing a late Hollow Profound human expert would be a great accomplishment, but he desired the Postnatal Spiritual Treasure more.

After much calculation, Xiahou didn't want to fight to the death with a peer of the same level here. It would be best to trap the opponent.

"Let's ascertain that person's identity first, then make a decision."

Xiahou said indifferently.

Seeing Xiahou's composure, Qingfei couldn't say much more, only bowing her head in agreement.
…
In the distance.

Qin Sang sat motionless, his breath rising and falling slightly, having waited for an unknown amount of time. The Kingfisher still showed no signs of awakening.

Suddenly, the Kingfisher's wings fluttered, and it took flight, transmitting Mo Xingdao's urgent, almost frantic shout, "We're being ambushed!"

Qin Sang abruptly awoke, startled at first, before understanding. He sprang to his feet. "You've encountered danger?"

"Someone is ambushing us!"

"Someone?" Qin Sang was shocked. "There are others here?"

"The Sacred Fox King Qingfei! It's her, and another powerful demon! Save me…" The Kingfisher flew swiftly, Mo Xingdao's voice becoming increasingly panicked and gradually fading, clearly using some secret technique to forcibly transmit the message.

Sacred Fox King Qingfei!

Qin Sang's expression changed drastically. His figure flickered, about to chase after the Kingfisher, but he abruptly stopped, his eyes fixed on the bird. "Why would she ambush you?"

Logically, having fallen into this realm together, they all wanted to find a path to ascension and should be natural allies!
