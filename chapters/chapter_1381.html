<h1>Chapter 1373: Crescent Moon Island</h1><p>Chapter 1373: Crescent Moon Island</p><p>Fei Can did not disappoint Qin Sang.</p><p>Its cultivation was a major realm lower than the frog-fish's.</p><p>However, the spell meticulously refined by the early-stage transformed Yao Wang (demon king) couldn't penetrate the  辟毒甲 (Pi Du Jia – assume this is a type of armor), and was firmly blocked.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>Demonic fire charged towards them.</p><p>Sensing the power of the demonic fire,</p><p>the frog-fish's scales stood on end, its eyes filled with terror.</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't satisfied yet. He patted his Corpse Puppet bag, and a Yuan Ying (Nascent Soul) spirit puppet shot out, attacking the frog-fish together with the demonic fire.</p><p>Having traversed a storm zone and fought three demons, the Yuan Ying spirit puppet's power was severely depleted.  Puppets are tireless, but not immortal.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The demonic fire was close at hand, about to engulf the frog-fish.</p><p>The frog-fish retreated violently, the golden and green light on its body erupting with immense force, pushing back against the demonic fire, colliding with it in an instant.</p><p>Black demonic fire, the shadow of the spirit puppet.</p><p>Golden and green light.</p><p>Various strange phenomena converged and clashed.</p><p>The void was in chaos.</p><p>Meanwhile, a thunderous sound tore through the air from afar.</p><p>A beam of blood shot into the battlefield like lightning.  It was Bi Fang, coming to his companion's aid in a desperate attempt.</p><p>Seeing Bi Fang approaching rapidly,</p><p>Qin Sang cursed inwardly, ignoring the frog-fish’s fate, immediately retracted the demonic fire and the Yuan Ying spirit puppet, dashing out of the range of the green light and continuing to flee.</p><p>A few more breaths, and Qin Sang would have been confident in killing the frog-fish, but that wouldn't help him escape danger.</p><p>His biggest enemy was Bi Fang, and he absolutely couldn’t be entangled by it!</p><p>He checked his internal energy; his True Essence had been depleted by another tenth.  He took a pill, held a spirit stone, desperately trying to recover, but it was merely a drop in the bucket.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>Bi Fang arrived.</p><p>A series of frantic cries erupted from the battlefield.</p><p>The enraged frog-fish jumped out.</p><p>A claw mark was clearly visible on its chest, nearly ripping it open.</p><p>Its scales, harder than any armor or magic treasure, were now charred black.  Its body trembled, turning to dust that fell like rain, revealing bloody flesh, causing immense pain.</p><p>If not for the little fox and Bi Fang’s assistance, it would have been killed on the spot!</p><p>Though it survived, the frog-fish was severely weakened and could no longer pursue Qin Sang.</p><p>The three demons looked at each other.</p><p>They had failed to kill their weakened opponent, and instead, one of their own was severely injured, and another was completely exhausted.</p><p>“Chase! This person is at his last gasp. We cannot let him escape!”</p><p>The frog-fish, gnashing its teeth, roared angrily, wishing to devour Qin Sang alive.</p><p>It was unwilling to admit that a touch of fear had sprung up in its heart towards Qin Sang.</p><p>The demonic fire's power was too terrifying.</p><p>The little fox's judgment was correct.</p><p>If they had encountered a fully-powered opponent, it would have been they who fled in panic!</p><p>The little fox arrived late; to avoid hindering Bi Fang, it had jumped off earlier.</p><p>Bi Fang nodded, “Be careful, avoid being seen by humans.”</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>A fierce wind blew.</p><p>Bi Fang chased after him.</p><p>Leaving the little fox and the frog-fish staring at each other.</p><p>‘Whoosh! Whoosh!’</p><p>Green and red lights streaked across the sky, their遁光 (dun guang – assume this refers to escaping light) so powerful that it was perceptible even from a distance.</p><p>Seeing that only Bi Fang was in pursuit, Qin Sang secretly thought his earlier actions had not been in vain; the fewer opponents, the greater his chance of escape.</p><p>Unfortunately, he was too weak.</p><p>Otherwise, Qin Sang would have dared to turn back and fight Bi Fang.</p><p>“How much farther to the human continent?”</p><p>Qin Sang recalled the sea chart.</p><p>Besides the marked route, the rest of the chart was crude.</p><p>His destination was a landmass called Crescent Moon Island.</p><p>Crescent Moon Island was one of the three northern sea regions, a commonly used name; its more formal name was Crescent Moon Territory.</p><p>Called an island, its territory was even larger than the Northern Star Territory, and the largest of the three northern sea regions.</p><p>Crescent Moon Island was uniquely shaped; its long and winding terrain tapered at both ends, bulging in the middle, resembling a crescent moon, thus its name.</p><p>Qin Sang was flying southwest, heading toward one of the crescent’s points.</p><p>The boat owner had said that demonic beasts dared not cause trouble near Crescent Moon Island, indicating it was under human control.</p><p>As Qin Sang pondered, he suddenly noticed two faint blue and white points in the distance.</p><p>The light points were clearly the escape lights of cultivators, drawn by the chase.</p><p>The speed of the approaching light indicated a Yuan Ying cultivator or a powerful demon king!</p><p>Qin Sang's face changed slightly.  Could he have attracted another demon king?</p><p>He frowned, muttering curses about this wretched place. How could he keep encountering so many Yuan Ying-level experts, always in pairs or small groups?</p><p>He suspected something was amiss.  His arrival was probably ill-timed; he'd likely stumbled into a major event.</p><p>The light drew closer.</p><p>Qin Sang relaxed slightly, confirming the approaching cultivator was human, not a demon king.</p><p>Soon, the approaching pair identified the fleeing duo, paused briefly, and then flew towards the retreating Bi Fang.</p><p>Seeing the approaching light, Bi Fang hesitated. Recognizing the approaching humans as enemies, it abandoned the chase despite its reluctance, changed course, and fled.</p><p>After a short distance, the two cultivators stopped, turning to look at Qin Sang.</p><p>One was a refined scholar in white, holding a folding fan, his demeanor elegant.  The other was an older man in green robes, his expression serious and stern.</p><p>Having driven off Bi Fang, they intended to greet Qin Sang, but he showed no sign of stopping, speeding away without a glance.</p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p>The scholar in white frowned, coldly remarking, "What impudence!"</p><p>The older man in green robes observed the departing light, then said, "I see!  He appears powerful, but he's clearly weakened.  He's not a familiar cultivator, so he's wary of us.  But when did such a powerful cultivator appear nearby?"</p><p>The scholar's expression softened.  If he were in that state and encountered unfamiliar cultivators, he'd do the same—retreat and recover his strength.</p><p>"That must be the Bi Fang demon king that Daoist Feng mentioned, right?"</p><p>The scholar looked towards Bi Fang's escape route; the red glow had disappeared.</p><p>The older man nodded. "Indeed.  That demon boasts the name Bi Fang, and its abilities are considerable. I'm not confident I could defeat it. However, this demon is usually inseparable from a cunning fox. Why is only Bi Fang here, and not the other demon king?"</p><p>"Daoist Liu sent a message that Bi Fang had summoned a frog-fish demon. Now neither are present. Could this person have escaped from three demon kings?"</p><p>The scholar's eyes widened, staring in the direction Qin Sang had fled.</p><p>"His escape technique is extraordinary; escaping other demon kings would be expected. However, to break free from three demon kings... that speaks volumes about his strength…"</p><p>The older man's eyes sparkled; he exchanged a few whispered words with the scholar.</p>
