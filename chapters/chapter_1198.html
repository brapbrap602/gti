<h1>Chapter 1190: The Demon-Sealing Stake</h1><p>“Although it's a bit late, I still want to congratulate Junior Brother Qin on your further advancement in the Dao, becoming one of us.”</p><p>Qing Jun’s lips curved into a slight smile, offering her congratulations.</p><p>Qin Sang smiled lightly, “Junior Brother is merely following in Senior Sister’s footsteps.”</p><p>“Heh, I don't have your talent.  You were able to slay a cultivator of the same level right after Nascent Soul formation.”</p><p>Qing Jun shook her head slightly, laughing in rebuttal.</p><p>“I was quite wary of Chan Ling Dao Ren, yet you managed to kill Old Devil Pei in his presence. I’ve always known about your cultivation of both body and spirit, that your strength after Nascent Soul formation wouldn't be ordinary, but I didn't expect you to achieve such fame so quickly!”</p><p>A hint of surprise flickered in Qing Jun’s eyes.</p><p>Upon first hearing the news, she and Old Daoist Zhen Yi had thought it was a false report.</p><p>Qin Sang waved his hand dismissively, “Daoist Jing Lin’s report exaggerated things quite a bit. In a one-on-one fight, even if I defeated Old Devil Pei, it would have been difficult to destroy his Nascent Soul.”</p><p>“That's true, the escape methods of Nascent Soul cultivators are endless.”</p><p>Qing Jun’s beautiful eyes flashed, her tone deep and meaningful. “You don't need to belittle yourself.  No one else could have done it, even under the same conditions. Thankfully, you used the Yao Wang identity as a cover. Otherwise, if such a figure suddenly appeared, both realms would have thoroughly investigated, and it wouldn't have stayed hidden for long.”</p><p>Qin Sang didn’t care, “Exposure wouldn't matter. I'm not doing this out of fear of Dongyang Bo; it's because I still don't have the strength to defeat him directly. If he knows it's me, he'll be more cautious, making it even harder to find an opportunity.”</p><p>Qing Jun was well aware of the enmity between Qin Sang and Dongyang Bo, knowing it wouldn't end well, so she didn't try to persuade him.</p><p>She changed the subject, “Tell me, what important matter requires your personal visit?”</p><p>Qin Sang glanced outside the side hall, waving his hand to set up several more restrictions to prevent any spying.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang’s caution, Qing Jun’s expression turned serious.</p><p>“There are two things. The first is related to the Nether Crystal Tower. Senior Sister, do you remember me mentioning the strange abilities used by the ancient demon of the Seven Killing Hall…?”</p><p>Qin Sang's voice was low as he recounted his discoveries to Qing Jun.</p><p>Behind the Abyss of Sin, shadowy figures appeared and disappeared.  He needed to discuss with Qing Jun how to deal with this situation.</p><p>“The Nether Crystal Tower is connected to the ancient demon!”</p><p>Qing Jun’s eyes narrowed. “How certain are you?”</p><p>“Intuition! The effects and fluctuations of the Soul-Extinguishing Cone are similar to the ancient demon's abilities, but their power and manifestations are vastly different…”</p><p>Qin Sang struggled to find the words to describe his feelings, then said, “Precisely because there's little evidence, it's hard for others to believe it. It would just be dismissed as alarmist.”</p><p>Qing Jun didn't doubt his judgment.</p><p>After much thought, she looked up and said, “The years I was away, I actually spent traveling in the Abyss of Sin.”</p><p>Qin Sang was surprised. At that time, the Abyss of Sin hadn't shown any signs of war; Nascent Soul masters were all in their secluded cultivation places. If Qing Jun had revealed her identity, she would have been attacked and hunted down.</p><p>The Abyss of Sin was a den of vipers and dragons; she had traveled there for so many years.</p><p>Qin Sang thought again, Senior Sister Qing Jun could disguise herself as Leng Yuntian until now, proving her strong disguise skills.</p><p>Qing Jun continued, “After receiving your warning, I wanted to look for evidence of a connection between the Abyss of Sin and the ancient demon.  After years of traveling, except for the top sects and several important hidden locations in the Abyss of Sin, I have basically visited everywhere, and apart from the general bellicosity, I didn't find anything unusually significant...”</p><p>Qin Sang frowned, “Senior Sister means…”</p><p>“Based on Junior Brother's findings, it only shows that the Nether Crystal Tower is connected to the ancient demon. Perhaps, the Nether Crystal Tower is a treasure created by the ancient demon, and the Abyss of Sin somehow obtained the method of refining it…”</p><p>Qing Jun voiced her guess, which coincided with Qin Sang’s earlier thoughts.</p><p>It's highly likely that the Abyss of Sin obtained some kind of ancient demon inheritance.</p><p>Qin Sang thought for a moment, feeling uneasy. “Senior Sister, you should still be cautious. I've already had my juniors look for a way out. If things change, it's best to lay low.”</p><p>Qing Jun expressed her gratitude, “Thank you for your reminder, Junior Brother. I will be careful. If there really is such a powerful ancient demon, I won’t force it. I’m a lone wolf; I can leave at any time.”</p><p>She had no attachment to the Yuan Shen Sect.</p><p>Qin Sang believed that his senior sister Qing Jun would make her own judgment, so he didn't persuade her further, and then mentioned something else.  "Some time ago, I went to Yuanzhao Gate to ask for the Ten Directions Yama Banners of the Kuiyin Ancestor. I heard that you were also looking for this item?"</p><p>Qing Jun was startled, then realized. "The fire banners you used against Old Devil Pei were the Ten Directions Yama Banners, right? I heard you used twelve at once, two more than Kuiyin Ancestor himself. I didn't dare to think of that.  So the legacy of Kuiyin Ancestor has fallen into your hands! No wonder I haven't found any clues after searching for so long."</p><p>Speaking, Qing Jun raised her hand, and seven demonic banners appeared in her palm, which she directly handed to Qin Sang.</p><p>"They're useless in my hands. Take them all. Once you repair all these Ten Directions Yama Banners, you'll be unstoppable at the Yuan Ying stage."</p><p>One banner was intact; the other six were badly damaged.</p><p>Qin Sang scanned them with his spiritual sense and found that the Nine Netherworld Demon Fire had leaked from the six damaged banners, but fortunately, the banner poles were undamaged.</p><p>This completed his set of Xuan Tie Zhu.</p><p>Unfortunately, there was no Nine Netherworld Demon Fire here; he couldn't repair the damaged banners.  At most, he would only have nineteen.</p><p>"Why is senior sister interested in Kuiyin Ancestor's magical artifacts?"</p><p>Qin Sang curiously asked.</p><p>Qing Jun smiled mysteriously, picking up a bare banner pole. "You have so many Ten Directions Yama Banners in your possession and have seen ancient demons firsthand. Don't you know the origin of these things?"</p><p>She paused, not continuing to play coy.  Under Qin Sang's surprised gaze, she said, "The restrictions within these banner poles are from an ancient treasure called the Demon Sealing Stakes. Legend says it was specifically created to subdue ancient demons! I discovered these in a forbidden ancient site within the Ziwei Palace.  Thinking of the demonic shadows during the attack on the Zu Yuan, I was also a little worried.  When I saw the banner poles at the Wuji Gate, and learned they were Kuiyin Ancestor's Ten Directions Yama Banners, I thought about repairing the Demon Sealing Stakes.  Later I realized it was impossible, even if I collected them all, I don't know how to arrange the spirit formation..."</p><p>Listening to senior sister Qing Jun's explanation, Qin Sang became even more surprised. "Demon Sealing Stakes! Demon Binding Rope! They are truly the same kind of treasure!"</p><p>"You know about the Demon Binding Rope?"</p><p>Qing Jun was surprised.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded repeatedly, scanning his Qianjun Ring with his spiritual sense and taking out the Demon Binding Rope he obtained from the ancient cultivator's relic. "Senior sister, look, is this it?"</p><p>Qing Jun recognized the Demon Binding Rope at a glance and exclaimed joyfully, "It's the Demon Binding Rope! Where did you get it?"</p><p>"I found it in an abandoned relic from the Ancient Immortal Battlefield..."</p><p>Qin Sang briefly explained the origin of the Demon Binding Rope. "Unfortunately, the Demon Binding Rope also requires a special spirit formation to work. Otherwise, even possessing an ancient treasure that subdues ancient demons would give us more confidence."</p><p>He and Bai had copied the spirit formation from the ancient cultivator's relic.</p><p>He planned to wait until Bai advanced to Corpse King, and perhaps, if he regained some memory, he could restore the spirit formation.</p>
