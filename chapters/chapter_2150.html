<h1>Chapter 2140  The Supreme</h1><p>The realm of Great Ascension is beyond the comprehension of ordinary mortals.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't help but exclaim, "Forgive my boldness, but I dare ask, Master Ning, what is your lineage?"</p><p>Master Ning, clearly a member of the Daoist sect, knowing so many secrets, must have a significant background.  Prominent sects like the Dan Ding School are recorded in the Daoist scriptures, but I wonder which sect Master Ning belongs to.</p><p>"Has Qin Shijun ever heard of the Supreme Daoist Sect?" Master Ning asked in return.</p><p>The Supreme Daoist Sect!</p><p>Qin Sang was secretly surprised. He had seen it mentioned in the Daoist scriptures – the Supreme Daoist Sect, belonging to the Dan Ding lineage, was known as the foremost Daoist sect in ancient times!</p><p>After ascending to the Greater Thousand Worlds, however, Qin Sang found that the Supreme Daoist Sect's reputation was insignificant, now virtually unknown. He had assumed that the Supreme Daoist Sect, like the Daoist Court, had suffered some calamity, either perishing or retreating from the world.</p><p>"Heaven and earth have their formation, preservation, destruction, and emptiness. Humans have birth, old age, sickness, and death. Sects also rise and fall, experiencing calamities everywhere.  This is the nature of all things,"</p><p>Master Ning sighed lightly, "I merely possess a single branch of the Supreme Daoist Sect's lineage."</p><p>Judging by Master Ning's tone, has the Supreme Daoist Sect splintered?</p><p>Qin Sang pondered. The collapse of the Divine Court, the Daoist Court being forced to sever a world, the destruction of most of the fourteen sword pavilions of the Purple Micro Palace and their descent into the Lesser Thousand Worlds, and now the decline of the Supreme Daoist Sect…</p><p>These top-tier forces, possessing countless powerful individuals, have all met such fates. Only the Great Zhou dynasty endures to this day, yet it's merely a nominal ruler of the world. What happened in ancient times?</p><p>Suddenly, Qin Sang felt something and dismissed his wandering thoughts.  Then, footsteps could be heard outside the pavilion. Two nuns emerged from the woods, standing beside Ch'en and bowing to Master Ning before waiting silently outside the pavilion.</p><p>The two nuns, one old and one young, were not Liuli.  They acknowledged Qin Sang with a nod, but their gaze held a hint of indifference.</p><p>Liuli still hadn't appeared, and Qin Sang felt an increasing sense of unease.</p><p>"It seems the Master prioritizes cultivation, achieving Great Ascension together, gaining eternal life, and remaining together for eternity?  I wonder what this has to do with me?" Qin Sang asked.</p><p>"Qin Shijun and Liuli are deeply bound. You likely underestimate the lingering effects of the evil skill and its impact on Liuli. After becoming entangled with Qin Shijun, Liuli has been trying to save herself.  The initial effects weren't so severe, and she had hope of recovery. But fate is cruel; whenever she was close to success, something would happen to ruin it. If she fails to resolve it, the extreme repression will erupt again, only worsening the problem and plunging Liuli deeper!" A hint of pity flashed in Master Ning's eyes.</p><p>Qin Sang neither confirmed nor denied Master Ning's words.  Though he couldn't empathize fully, he had witnessed Liuli's struggles. When he offered a way to resolve the problem and revealed his feelings, he immediately left to avoid pressuring Liuli.</p><p>"Even so, Liuli found her true self, showing an incredibly strong will.  She was about to accept you back then…"</p><p>Master Ning looked deeply at Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression shifted slightly. He had already learned about this from Shi Xue and Abbess Yunxin.  If not for that accident, if the Storm World were a normal Lesser Thousand World, perhaps he and Liuli would have ascended together and travelled through the Greater Thousand World.</p><p>"If you both opened your hearts to each other, it might be a solution. Or if Qin Shijun were to help fully, given Liuli's nature, I might find a way to help you overcome the lingering effects of the evil skill. Sadly…"</p><p>Master Ning sighed softly, saying sadly, "Fate is cruel; Qin Shijun is too late!"</p><p>Qin Sang's face turned pale.  "What do you mean, Master Ning?"</p><p>"A hundred years ago, upon learning of the appearance of the Purple Micro Palace at Feng Ju Jade Gate,  Liao Chen and the others took Liuli to Feng Ju Jade Gate to search for her master, Bing Yao," Master Ning explained.</p><p>"Liuli went to Feng Ju Jade Gate?  So, she knows about Bing Yao…"</p><p>Qin Sang glanced outside the pavilion.</p><p>Considering the timeline, he had also entered Feng Ju Jade Gate around that time, but he and Liuli had missed each other.</p><p>Liao Chen nodded gently. "We found fragments of the Heavenly Mountain within the Purple Micro Palace. It was in ruins, having suffered terrible damage during a dimensional rift. Bing Yao was trapped in the mountain, and her survival was unlikely. We searched the Feng Ju Jade Gate area for a while, but found no trace of Bing Yao and then encountered an incident that forced us to leave."</p><p>Qin Sang knew that the incident Liao Chen referred to was the emergence of the Purple Micro Palace, which attracted powerful figures and resulted in a great battle.</p><p>Throughout Liuli's spiritual journey, the thread of 'qing'— familial affection, gratitude, and even romantic love—has been inseparable, though this love stemmed from a karmic entanglement," commented Master Ning.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded silently.</p><p>Back then, on Shao Hua Mountain, Liuli relentlessly pursued Yuan Ying stage breakthrough, not for self-advancement, nor for any lofty ideals of the Dao, but solely to rescue her master and repay her debt of gratitude. This led to various entanglements with him.</p><p>Master Ning was right; Liuli's life revolved around 'qing'.</p><p>"Sir Qin, you can imagine the cruelty of her unwavering devotion, her opening of her heart, only to be met with the devastating news of your demise, especially while still grappling with the lingering effects of that wicked technique. That she didn't succumb to demonic possession speaks volumes about her resilience and fortitude.  Since then, while she found solace in aiding your sect and its younger generation, Bing Yao became her last anchor…"</p><p>Master Ning paused.</p><p>Qin Sang remained silent, understanding Master Ning's implication.</p><p>Rescuing her master was her greatest obsession, the pillar of her cultivation. Now, that obsession was shattered; putting himself in her shoes, he could imagine her despair.</p><p>"How...is Liuli now?" Qin Sang's voice was strained.</p><p>"In fact, the dangers of that wicked technique aren't insurmountable; I possess a cultivation method that can counteract it."</p><p>Master Ning abruptly shifted topics, but Qin Sang was used to it, patiently waiting for her to continue.</p><p>"This method cultivates the Dao of Supreme Forgetfulness!"</p><p>Master Ning's words caused Qin Sang's pupils to constrict.</p><p>"Supreme Forgetfulness—to transcend emotion, yet emotion is the very essence of our being! Liuli endured Silver Needle Heartlock, Ice Soul Seal, and Wisdom Sword Severance, each failed attempt resulting in a powerful outburst, each a tribulation of emotion. Few have experienced such trials and such profound emotions; though intertwined with the wicked technique, she not only resisted its influence but also found her true self—remarkable indeed.  Among those I've met, none are more suited to the Dao of Supreme Forgetfulness than Liuli."</p><p>Master Ning's tone shifted. "However, Liuli initially refused me."</p><p>Qin Sang's lips moved slightly. "And now...?"</p><p>"Upon returning from Feng Ju Jade Gate, she accepted."</p><p>Master Ning sighed, "Fate is a cruel mistress."  "No one expected Sir Qin to return alive, but it was too late."</p><p>Qin Sang fell silent, turning to the lake.</p><p>The air was still; a faint mist rose from the water's surface, settling over the lake like a shroud.</p><p>As if sensing the oppressive atmosphere, fish broke the surface, gasping for air, creating ripples that spread across the water.</p><p>Suddenly, Qin Sang's expression darkened. He abruptly looked beyond the pavilion, fixing his gaze on Luocheng.</p><p>"When you journeyed to Feng Ju Jade Gate, I was nearby. Ascending cultivators from the Storm Realm certainly knew of Ziwei Palace. News would have spread, attracting attention to Feng Ju Jade Gate, so I deliberately left my true name at the Wu Xing League branch in Jade Gate Pass. Did the monk not hear of it?"</p><p>A Wu Xing League elder in Jade Gate Pass was not an insignificant figure; with any effort, the truth could be uncovered.</p><p>If Liuli knew he was alive, and they had reunited at Feng Ju Jade Gate, would the subsequent turmoil have occurred?</p><p>Luocheng clasped her hands together, chanting a Buddhist mantra. "We were indeed unaware of Sir Qin's presence at Feng Ju Jade Gate. Upon our arrival, powerful beings were already locked in battle there. Jade Gate Pass repeatedly suffered collateral damage. Most factions had already withdrawn, and later, it was reduced to ruins, and people scattered."</p><p>An older nun interjected, "Although not fellow disciples, Liuli and we received personal guidance from Master Ning, and we always considered her a younger sister. If Liuli could reunite with Sir Qin, we'd be overjoyed, not obstructive."</p><p>Qin Sang was speechless; he couldn't blame them; he couldn't simply suspect them of intentionally concealing information from Liuli.</p><p>The upheaval caused by Ziwei Palace's emergence was immense; Jade Gate Pass and Feng Ju Jade Gate were in chaos; Luocheng's explanation was entirely plausible.</p><p>The young nun lowered her head, softly saying, "Sir Qin, please don't think us callous. Our younger sister has endured a difficult life, and we cherish her deeply.  It's simply that Sir Qin appeared at an inopportune time.  Our younger sister has already embarked on the path of Supreme Forgetfulness.  To forcefully interrupt now could be disastrous."</p><p>Qin Sang looked to Master Ning.</p><p>Master Ning nodded slightly.  "Regardless of Liuli's fortitude, there are limits to her resilience."</p><p>Now, if she were to abandon the Taishang Forgetfulness again, the consequences would be far more severe than before. Even if you two become Dao companions, she would likely be tormented by the lingering effects of the demonic skill.  Only by obtaining the true "Red Luan Heart Sutra" might there be a chance of resolving this. However, not only do I not know which sect possesses the "Red Luan Heart Sutra," but even if we could obtain it immediately, would Master Qin be willing to cultivate it?”</p><p>Master Ning gazed intently into Qin Sang's eyes, his gaze seeming to pierce through them and into his very soul.</p><p>After a moment, Master Ning said meaningfully, "While Mount Daiyu is severely damaged, it still holds value that Master Qin must discover for himself.  Furthermore, the mountain is not beyond repair. I can instruct Master Qin on how to restore and utilize Mount Daiyu, a process that will greatly benefit you!"</p><p>Qin Sang furrowed his brows.  "What exactly are you trying to say, Master Ning?"</p><p>Master Ning continued, unfazed, "Once Mount Daiyu is restored to a certain extent and refined by Master Qin, upon reaching the Unity Realm, you can establish the mountain within your own Dharma domain. The power of the mountain will make your domain far more stable and powerful.  Consider how difficult it is to enhance a Dharma domain. With Mount Daiyu's aid, Master Qin can effortlessly surpass your peers.  If you were to fully restore Mount Daiyu, it might even aid your future breakthrough to the Mahayana stage.  Surely this is tempting?"</p><p>Master Ning's tone was persuasive, a subtle pressure enveloping the pavilion and its surroundings.</p><p>Liao Chen and the two nuns showed signs of nervousness, instinctively stepping back.</p><p>Qin Sang, however, remained unmoved. He slammed his hand on the table, abruptly breaking free from the pressure, and said coldly, "Mount Daiyu is in the Qingyang Temple. Please reclaim it, Master Ning!"</p><p>Master Ning watched Qin Sang for a long time, then suddenly smiled, the pressure instantly dissipating. His tone was a mixture of joy and sigh, "Liuli's luck isn't so bad after all; at least she hasn't chosen wrongly."</p><p>Qin Sang was slightly taken aback, slowly sitting down. Unable to fathom Master Ning's intentions, he decided to wait and see.</p><p>"Taishang Forgetfulness—to achieve forgetfulness through emotion, to ultimately transcend emotion. I believe Liuli will eventually reach this state, but she is only beginning to cultivate this technique; she cannot do so yet. The first step in cultivation is to 'forget,' to forget the most deeply ingrained emotions of the past, to refine oneself, and return to one's true nature. The first thing she chooses to forget is not her master-disciple bond with Bing Yao, but…"</p><p>Master Ning paused, then uttered a single word, "You."</p><p>Qin Sang was puzzled. What exactly had Liuli forgotten? Was it their shared experiences? Or a change in Liuli's own feelings? Or perhaps, in Liuli's memory, he no longer exists?</p><p>"If I were to arrange a meeting between Liuli and you now…"</p><p>Master Ning pondered for a moment, then said, "Perhaps it would be… a familiar stranger."</p><p>Qin Sang remained silent.</p><p>"Will Liuli reach the state Master Ning described once she attains the Mahayana stage?"</p><p>Qin Sang now understood the purpose of Master Ning's earlier question.</p><p>Master Ning responded frankly, "Out of selfish desire—having finally found a successor capable of inheriting the Taishang Forgetfulness lineage—I should have tried to prevent Master Qin from influencing Liuli, but I am Liuli's master!</p><p>"I cannot give Master Qin a definitive answer. No one knows whether, upon comprehending the world, Liuli will resolutely choose to enter the world, or remain unmoved, transcending it all.</p><p>"I can only tell Master Qin that accepting the situation, for both you and Liuli, is the most cruel, yet most rational choice—perhaps the only choice."</p><p>Qin Sang fell silent again.</p><p>Outside the pavilion, the monk and two nuns also watched Qin Sang in silence, their expressions complex.  Before, they did not want Qin Sang to come, but now they felt pity for him.</p><p>"Master Ning, are you telling me to stay away from Liuli?"</p><p>Qin Sang looked at Liao Chen and the others outside the pavilion, then at the landscape of Purple Cloud Mountain.</p><p>Jagged rocks, dense forests… Liuli might be somewhere in the mountains, so close yet unreachable.</p><p>Had Master Ning brought him here to dissuade him?</p><p>"Master Qin misunderstands.  Prevention is often less effective than mitigation. My goal is not to prevent you, but to clarify the stakes. We both genuinely care for Liuli, and we should work together.  During this process, she will also be subtly influenced by you. Your future unity in the Mahayana stage, your life together—I would welcome it.  As the saying goes…"</p><p>Master Ning stood up, walked to the edge of the pavilion, rested his hand on a stone pillar, and looked out at the vast expanse of water, his voice echoing.</p><p>"Forgetfulness is not without emotion; with emotion, there is no need to sever emotion!"</p><p>――</p><p>――</p><p>I'm busy today and can only take a leave of absence.
