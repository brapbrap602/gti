<h1>Chapter 2087: Yonghe</h1><p>The light illuminated Min Zhuo's small figure, which at this moment appeared incredibly imposing in the eyes of the clan elders.</p><p>The elders couldn't believe it. They knew that Min Zhuo had already touched upon the bottleneck of the second level of the Empty Realm, but they hadn't expected him to break through so soon. Moreover, Min Zhuo directly activated the Sacred Lake Grand Formation, clearly confident in this attempt to shatter the barrier.</p><p>Regarding their Clan Leader's talent, the elders all had a clear understanding. They initially thought that the efficacy of the Azure Spirit Qi would greatly diminish later on, and it would likely lose its effect when breaking through to the second level of the Empty Realm. No one was confident that the Clan Leader would definitely succeed.</p><p>Now it seemed that the power of the Azure Spirit Qi still remained, otherwise the Clan Leader couldn't have broken through so quickly. This meant that as long as they occupied the Azure Spirit Qi, they, too, had hope of stepping into the second level of the Empty Realm in this lifetime!</p><p>Shock, ecstasy…</p><p>Complex emotions surged within everyone's hearts, overwhelming them.</p><p>If the Clan Leader successfully broke through to the second level of the Empty Realm, not only would they be able to effortlessly defeat the enemies who had entangled them for hundreds of years and seize the Azure Spirit Qi for themselves, but the status of the Changyou Clan would also undergo a fundamental transformation.</p><p>Whether or not a clan had a second-level Empty Realm expert presiding over it was a world of difference. Without a second-level Empty Realm expert, they wouldn't even have the qualifications to participate in the grandest gathering of the Exalted Tribes — the Yuanjiao Sea Market!</p><p>Praying that the Clan Leader would succeed, and that the Changyou Clan would eventually step into the ranks of the powerful clans, one elder even knelt facing the Ancestral Hall, beseeching the ancestors for their protection.</p><p>‘Crash!’</p><p>Giant waves surged from the Sacred Lake, and the earth rumbled.</p><p>Like a subterranean dragon turning over, it shattered the long-standing tranquility.</p><p>The clear lake water was shaken into the sky, and a mist of water droplets fell down, forming rainbows in the void, seemingly a good omen.</p><p>‘Splash!’</p><p>‘Splash!’</p><p>…</p><p>The waves grew larger and larger, the tide surging.</p><p>In an instant, the buildings by the lake were submerged underwater, and the lake water continued to rise.</p><p>Meanwhile, the tremors at the bottom of the lake grew increasingly violent. Suddenly, a pillar of light shot up into the sky. Blue pillars of light erupted one after another, dyeing the sky a lake-blue hue, the lake and sky merging into one, reflecting each other beautifully.</p><p>At the center of the Sacred Lake, around the Ancestral Hall, it was remarkably calm, but the Ancestral Hall itself began to undergo a transformation. Its walls, tiles, and pillars all became transparent, as if carved from pure jasper.</p><p>The jasper hall shone with a faint blue light, and a wave of energy rapidly spread outwards, sweeping across the entire lake surface.</p><p>‘Boom! Boom! Boom!’</p><p>Something at the base of the pillars of light seemed to be activated, about to burst forth from the water. Min Shu and the clan elders all felt a startling pressure sweep over them.</p><p>“The Clan Leader has activated the formation!  Quickly, leave!”</p><p>One elder shouted, and everyone scrambled to fly away from the Sacred Lake.  Towering waves surged from the Sacred Lake, chasing their retreating figures, engulfing heaven and earth, and submerging the mountain range surrounding the Sacred Lake.</p><p>Some Changyou Clan cultivators, unable to contain their curiosity and failing to retreat in time, were instantly swept away by the giant waves, their whereabouts unknown.</p><p>The elders felt the momentum of the waves behind them weaken, slowed their escape, and looked back. They found a vast expanse of blue before them. The sky-reaching water had not receded, forming a high wall, the water flowing in the sky.</p><p>Through the water curtain, they could vaguely see the scene within the Sacred Lake. Stone statues, all in the likeness of Changyou Clan members, but with different appearances and postures, rose from the original lakeshore.</p><p>Bathed in the sacred lake water, they shimmered with divine light, as if alive.</p><p>This was the first time the elders had witnessed the true Sacred Lake Grand Formation.  This formation was used to protect the Sacred Lake and the Ancestral Hall, only activated when the Changyou Clan was invaded and pushed to the brink of destruction.</p><p>Because of the ancient pact and the will of the Zhuyan Clan, even if there were grudges between clans, they wouldn't go so far as to destroy each other's ancestral halls.</p><p>They saw Clan Leader Min Zhuo descend from the sky, landing above the Ancestral Hall and sitting cross-legged in mid-air.</p><p>All the stone statues turned simultaneously, facing Min Zhuo, their gazes fixed upon him.</p><p>At this time, more and more water gathered in the air, the flow becoming thicker and heavier. The scene within gradually blurred. The elders, worried about disturbing the Clan Leader, didn't dare to activate their spiritual vision, and could only wait anxiously outside.</p><p>Min Shu went down to appease the clan members, urging them to continue evacuating outwards, then returned to wait with the elders.</p><p>In the past, decades of closed-door cultivation would pass in the blink of an eye, but now, every moment felt excruciatingly long.</p><p>Unknowingly, half a year had passed.  There was still no movement from within the Sacred Lake, and no one dared to leave, continuing their vigil.</p><p>Suddenly one day, a peculiar fluctuation startled everyone.  Soon after, a terrifying pressure descended, causing them to tremble in fear.</p><p>"He succeeded!"</p><p>Someone whispered, but everyone remained incredibly tense. Only after surviving the Heavenly Tribulation could they truly relax, and they hadn't heard of the Clan Leader preparing any treasures for the tribulation.</p><p>They saw shadows appear within the water curtain, like illusory flames.</p><p>"It's Yin Fire!"</p><p>Everyone instinctively retreated, their eyes filled with dread.</p><p>After an agonizing wait, a fierce wind suddenly arose around them, clearly the arrival of the Wind Tribulation, followed by rumbling thunderclaps.</p><p>When everything returned to calm, the water of the Sacred Lake remained suspended in the air, and the Clan Leader did not emerge for a long time.</p><p>Everyone looked at each other, but no one dared to rashly intrude.</p><p>Inside the Sacred Lake.</p><p>Min Zhuo slowly opened his eyes, a deep wariness flashing within them. It took a while before he finally confirmed that he had returned to reality, successfully surviving the Heart Demon Tribulation!</p><p>Recalling his experiences within the Heart Demon Tribulation, a chill ran down his spine. He didn't know when he had broken out in a cold sweat.</p><p>"It's done."</p><p>Min Zhuo looked at his hands, murmuring to himself.</p><p>He could clearly feel the boundless power of heaven and earth. Before, he could only slightly influence it, but now, it was all within his grasp. With a single thought, he could carve mountains into valleys and make peaks rise from the lakebed.</p><p>"So this is the power of the second level of the Empty Realm..."</p><p>Min Zhuo closed his eyes, carefully savoring the sensation, completely immersed.</p><p>He had indulged in countless fantasies, but he could never have imagined that he would gain such power so quickly. It still felt unreal.</p><p>Thinking of this, Min Zhuo's heart suddenly stirred. All of this was not achieved through his own arduous cultivation.  The mysterious person had not only gifted him with the spirit medicines and secret techniques for his breakthrough, but also treasures to aid him in surviving the tribulation. Otherwise, he might have already perished under the Heavenly Tribulation!</p><p>Min Zhuo snapped out of his reverie. Instead of immediately consolidating his cultivation, he took out the round pearl given to him by the mysterious person, rubbing it in his hand a few times, before his expression turned serious. He infused it with True Essence.</p><p>'Bang!'</p><p>The pearl exploded into a water mist, the fog hazy, revealing the outline of a human figure.</p><p>This time, the figure was no longer blurry in Min Zhuo's eyes.</p><p>However, at the same time the figure appeared, Min Zhuo suddenly sensed something. His sharp gaze shot towards the area outside the Sacred Lake, landing on a person atop a mountain.</p><p>That person wore a black and yellow robe embroidered with a golden coiled dragon, with crimson hair and crimson eyes, flames seemingly burning within his pupils.</p><p>Facing the Sacred Lake, along with the figure in the water mist, he performed a salute from afar, congratulating, "Congratulations, Brother Min, on your successful breakthrough!"</p><p>"It's you?"</p><p>Min Zhuo seemed to recognize this person, his expression changing slightly. His figure flickered, appearing before that person.</p><p>The person calmly looked at Min Zhuo, saying, "It has always been me, Brother Min. You probably didn't expect this, did you?"</p><p>Min Zhuo was filled with surprise and uncertainty.  He truly hadn't expected that the mysterious person behind the scenes was actually him.</p><p>This person was named Zai Zhen, from the Yonghe Clan.  Only slightly older than him, he could be considered a peer.  He had been known as a genius since childhood, and lived up to his reputation, breaking through to the second level of the Empty Realm two hundred years ago.</p><p>During his youthful travels, Min Zhuo had encountered Zai Zhen and interacted with him a few times.  Later, the gap between them grew wider and wider. Since their friendship wasn't deep to begin with, Min Zhuo naturally wouldn't try to curry favor with him.</p><p>The Yonghe Clan had always been more powerful than the Changyou Clan, at least occasionally producing a second-level Empty Realm expert. But thousands of years ago, for unknown reasons, the Yonghe Clan suddenly declined, until Zai Zhen emerged, halting their decline and showing signs of revival.</p><p>Because of this, Min Zhuo simply didn't believe Zai Zhen's words.</p><p>Even at the height of its power, the Yonghe Clan probably wouldn't be able to produce so many rare treasures, let alone have the resources to gift them to outsiders.  Moreover, wouldn't it be better to keep these treasures for their own clan members?</p><p>"Brother Zai, do you really think I'm so easily fooled?"</p><p>Min Zhuo frowned. "Even if the treasures were delivered through Brother Zai's hands, there should be someone else behind Brother Zai, right?"</p><p>"Indeed, I can't hide it from Brother Min."</p><p>Zai Zhen frankly admitted, cupping his hands towards the sky. "That person's origins are limited to a select few, Brother Min should be able to guess one or two.  However, if Brother Min wants to ask about that person's identity, I'm afraid I cannot disclose it. At most, I can convey Brother Min's intentions. Whether or not that person wants to meet Brother Min is up to them."</p><p>Min Zhuo frowned. Among the nearby clans, only a few powerful clans, such as the Zhuyan, could casually bring out so many precious treasures.</p><p>He had previously speculated that the other party might be an outsider, afraid of being detected by the Zhuyan and other clans, hence their secretive actions.  Now it seemed that even Zai Zhen was willing to be at their beck and call, which was quite intriguing.</p><p>His thoughts raced.  Just as he was about to speak, he heard Zai Zhen continue.</p><p>"However, since that person doesn't want to reveal their identity, I think it's best for Brother Min not to pry too deeply."</p><p>"Jade Sun Divine Milk, high-grade secret techniques, Soul-Soothing Gathering Essence Pills..."</p><p>Zai Zhen clicked his tongue in admiration. "Back then, if I had obtained any one of these, I wouldn't have had to go through a near-death experience during my breakthrough.  Yet, Brother Min obtained them without lifting a finger! You must know, that person has the ability to give these treasures, and they also have the ability to take them back!"</p><p>"There's no need for Brother Zai to remind me, I understand perfectly."</p><p>Min Zhuo snorted coldly, not pursuing the other party's identity, and asked in a deep voice, "This kindness is beyond repayment.  What does that person want me to do in return?"</p><p>"Brother Min is indeed straightforward!"</p><p>Zai Zhen smiled faintly. "The time is not yet ripe. What Brother Min needs to do now is to quickly enter seclusion to consolidate your cultivation, but do not relax your vigilance against those foreign clans."</p><p>"Is that person targeting those foreign clans? Or do they have a grudge against the powerful figures behind the foreign clans?"</p><p>Min Zhuo's eyes flashed.  He didn't think those foreign clans were worth the mysterious expert's elaborate efforts.  It must be related to the previous Yao Clan expert.</p><p>Zai Zhen said in a serious tone, "Brother Min needn't ask too much. When your cultivation is consolidated, send a message. I will naturally tell you what to do next."</p><p>Min Zhuo nodded thoughtfully.</p><p>It seemed that the existence of Daiyu Immortal Mountain hadn't been exposed yet. He still had a chance.</p><p>But besides him, there were also people within the foreign clans who knew about Daiyu Immortal Mountain, although they didn't know its origins. If those foreign clans were utterly defeated and someone captured them, the news might be leaked, and the Immortal Mountain would be completely out of his reach.</p><p>Although the ancient texts recording Daiyu Immortal Mountain were rare, they were certainly not exclusive to the Changyou Clan's collection.</p><p>Over the years, he had meticulously investigated countless times. Before breaking through to the second level of the Empty Realm, his strength was insufficient, and he was unable to take Daiyu Immortal Mountain.</p><p>Now his strength was sufficient, but before the tide of the polluted Qi receded, he didn't dare to act rashly.  He had to wait for the polluted Qi to recede before having a chance to succeed, while also concealing the fluctuations caused by the emergence of Daiyu Immortal Mountain.</p><p>Otherwise, he would be unable to control it. Once violent fluctuations were triggered, not only might he be detected by experts from other clans, but he might also alarm the powerful ferocious beasts deep within the polluted lands.</p><p>According to Min Zhuo's original plan, he still had ample lifespan. As long as he broke through step by step, he would be able to monopolize Daiyu Immortal Mountain. Unexpectedly, things didn't go as planned. The arrival of uninvited guests one after another had made the situation incredibly complicated.</p><p>He himself had become someone else's pawn.  Pawns weren't without room to maneuver, but his clan members were here, and he couldn't disregard everything and flee.</p><p>Min Zhuo felt constrained, sighing inwardly.</p><p>"Brother Min now has the power to protect yourself, so I don't need to stay here all the time," Zai Zhen bowed slightly.  "I've been away from my clan for too long, and it's time for me to return. I believe I'll hear good news from Brother Min soon."</p><p>"Brother Zai, wait!"</p><p>Min Zhuo hurriedly called him back.  "I've just broken through, how can I be the opponent of those established experts?  And there's more than one expert on the other side..."</p><p>"Don't worry, Brother Min, there will be help when the time comes!"</p><p>Zai Zhen gave him a meaningful look, pinched a hand seal, and his figure vanished instantly.</p><p>Min Zhuo heard the implied meaning in his words.  Could it be that besides Zai Zhen, there were other helpers?</p><p>His heart settled slightly. Gazing at the empty mountaintop, he pondered for a long time before returning to the Sacred Lake.</p><p>The stone statues slowly sank into the water, and the lake water receded.</p><p>The anxious clan elders rushed in.  Sensing the aura on the Clan Leader, they couldn't suppress their ecstasy and knelt in worship.</p><p>"I've just broken through and still need to seclude myself. During this time, strictly seal off the news, and all clan affairs should continue as usual..."</p><p>Min Zhuo issued his commands one by one.</p><p>One elder inquired, "Clan Leader, what should we do with those foreign clans..."</p><p>"Don't inform Min Shan for now. Send him a message, telling him to continue with his previous plans and act according to the circumstances."</p><p>Min Zhuo flicked his sleeve and entered the Ancestral Hall.</p><p>Although the others were somewhat puzzled, they didn't dare to disobey the Clan Leader's orders, rising only after the doors of the Ancestral Hall closed.</p><p>…</p><p>Beyond the North Sea, behind the Changyou Clan army.</p><p>On a certain island.</p><p>Min Shan was still unaware of the Clan Leader's breakthrough. Various intelligence reports lay on his desk, as he pondered deeply, deducing the next stage of his strategy.</p><p>In the quiet hall, Min Shan paced back and forth. While lost in thought, he suddenly sensed an unusual fluctuation.</p><p>His expression shifted slightly, a look of anticipation flashing in his eyes. He tapped his finger in the void, repeating his previous trick. A strange current of water flowed along the ocean current, silently passing through the army, arriving near a reef, and coalescing into Min Shan's avatar.</p><p>At the same time, a wisp of black mist drifted out from the crevices of the reef, transforming into a human form before him.</p><p>"Oh? This time, how does my friend have the leisure to condescend to come here?" Min Shan's tone was amicable.</p><p>Over the years, the other party had repeatedly provided accurate and useful intelligence, making their cooperation very pleasant.</p>
