<h1>Chapter 1646: Gathering</h1><p>Black threads swam nimbly in the pool, continuously absorbing the fire poison.</p><p>Grandmaster Huaiyin sensed the aura of the black threads, his gaze firmly drawn, his expression gradually turning solemn. He asked sternly, "Fifth Transformation?"</p><p>Duwang shook his head. "Merely refining corpses into Gu, all show and no substance."</p><p>Seeing that he seemed unwilling to explain further,</p><p>Grandmaster Huaiyin didn't press him, taking one last deep look at the black threads before surveying the surroundings of the underground palace.</p><p>At this moment, both he and Duwang noticed the fire spirit nurtured by the Flowing Fire Illusionary True Pool. Its aura was surprisingly weak, unworthy of the pool, clearly abnormal.</p><p>"Someone has been here!"</p><p>The two spoke almost in unison, both having discerned the clues.</p><p>The true fire spirit had already been taken by someone else, and not long ago. It must have been startled away by the commotion they caused while breaking through the barrier.</p><p>The fire spirit was secondary; the Flowing Fire within the Flowing Fire Illusionary True Pool was the true essence.</p><p>However, since entering the legacy, they had been unaware of the layout of the Formless Immortal Sect, wandering around like headless flies. They urgently needed someone who understood the Formless Immortal Sect to enlighten them, yet the individuals who had entered before were nowhere to be found.</p><p>Now, finally encountering one, they naturally wanted to inquire.</p><p>Grandmaster Huaiyin glanced around, settling his gaze on a stone gate, his figure disappearing into the stone passage.</p><p>Duwang needed to control the black threads and couldn't leave for the moment. He sat cross-legged at the edge of the Flowing Fire Illusionary True Pool, fully urging the black threads to absorb the fire poison within the pool.</p><p>As the black threads swam, the dazzling golden light gradually weakened.</p><p>At this time, the shaft continuously transmitted vibrating sounds. Duwang listened carefully and realized it wasn't Grandmaster Huaiyin fighting with someone, but the result of someone forcefully breaking through restrictions.</p><p>Not long after, Grandmaster Huaiyin returned empty-handed, shaking his head. The other party had retreated swiftly and seemed quite familiar with the island's restrictions. By the time he chased out, they were already gone.</p><p>"We'll meet them in the mountains eventually."</p><p>Duwang wasn't anxious, continuing to manipulate the black threads, accelerating the absorption of the fire poison.</p><p>From the moment they landed on Fire Rhinoceros Island until now, in this short period, the Qi on Fire Rhinoceros Island was visibly becoming chaotic.</p><p>The magma waterfall surged with layers of fiery waves, showing no signs of weakening, but instead growing taller with each wave.</p><p>The blazing flames rolled back up towards the floating island, a sea of crimson fire.</p><p>The chaos intensified.</p><p>The rumbling sounds and tremors even reached the underground palace. Duwang could clearly perceive it, knowing that the floating island, implicated by them, was doomed to destruction sooner or later. He busied himself fully absorbing the fire poison.</p><p>Taking advantage of this time, Grandmaster Huaiyin stepped out of the underground palace, walking upon the magma, strolling leisurely amidst the raging flames, searching aimlessly. He occasionally found something, but nothing that caught his eye.</p><p>Not long after, Duwang finally finished collecting the fire poison and immediately rushed to meet up.</p><p>By this time, Fire Rhinoceros Island was on the verge of collapse.</p><p>The island held no further value.  The two had no intention of staying long, casually choosing a path down the island.</p><p>‘Whoosh! Whoosh!’</p><p>Just as they left Fire Rhinoceros Island, before even escaping the range of the fire veins, they heard an earth-shattering explosion behind them, a sudden eruption of astonishing fluctuations.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The violent energy, accumulated to a certain point, finally erupted. Crimson flames soared to the heavens, painting the sky scarlet.</p><p>Fire Rhinoceros Island began to collapse from its center, boulders constantly crashing down.</p><p>The fluctuations formed a dazzling crimson fire ring, rapidly expanding in all directions.  It instantly reached their backs, about to engulf them.</p><p>Duwang summoned a toxic cloud, transforming it into a protective ring of poison.</p><p>Within Grandmaster Huaiyin's body, faint sounds of thunder rumbled. His Qi and blood vibrated, preventing the flames from approaching.</p><p>The two emerged unscathed, rushing out of the fire veins and ascending a distant mountain peak.  They turned back to watch the scene of destruction they had wrought, its scale only slightly less than the previous azure pillar of light.</p><p>Unexpectedly, as the phenomenon reached its peak and began to decline, a portion of Fire Rhinoceros Island remained intact.</p><p>A fire dragon, supporting the northern part of the floating island, had actually withstood the impact.  Though Fire Rhinoceros Island was decimated, a part of it had indeed survived.</p><p>This was due to Fire Rhinoceros Island's unique spirit array. However, the fire dragon teetered precariously, its survival uncertain.</p><p>The two didn't linger, hurrying to Emperor Bestowal Mountain to meet with Fan Laomo.</p><p>In the distance, Qin Sang's avatar materialized in a hidden spot within the mountains. Looking back towards Fire Rhinoceros Island, he sighed at the sight of the collapsing island.</p><p>The central area, where the underground palace was located, had crumbled. The Flowing Fire Illusionary True Pool was surely lost.</p><p>Looking down at his palm, the Fire Jade Centipede was fast asleep, its round belly rising and falling with each breath.</p><p>The avatar looked towards Emperor Bestowal Mountain and immediately set off to rejoin his main body.</p><p>……</p><p>Within the forest.</p><p>Before a simple cave dwelling.</p><p>Mo Xingdao sat still as a statue.</p><p>After he informed Su Zinan about the Nascent Soul opportunity on Emperor Bestowal Mountain, Su Zinan immediately entered secluded cultivation, seemingly refining some treasure. He had yet to emerge.</p><p>However, Mo Xingdao's temperament had been tempered through countless trials. He didn't become restless, adjusting his own state while waiting for Su Zinan.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>Su Zinan finally finished refining the treasure and pushed open the door.</p><p>Mo Xingdao rose to his feet, noticing a hint of gloom in Su Zinan's expression. He wondered if the refining had failed.</p><p>Unbeknownst to him, Su Zinan was currently facing a difficult dilemma.</p><p>He had successfully refined Elder Yanshan into his primary soul, thereby obtaining a wealth of information about the Formless Immortal Sect from him. One piece of information in particular greatly tempted even a Nascent Soul inheritor like him.</p><p>The Formless Immortal Sect actually possessed a Tribulation Transcendence Formation!</p><p>The Tribulation Transcendence Formation was a core inheritance of both the Water Phase Hall and Fire Phase Hall lineages. It required two treasures working in conjunction: the Ice Instrument Divine Disc and the Fire Rhinoceros Seal.</p><p>In addition, it also required a formation altar corresponding to the treasures, as well as an Ice and Fire Token.</p><p>Elder Yanshan had obtained the formation method and the refining method for the Ice and Fire Token from the Water Phase Lord's tomb, but he lacked both the Ice Instrument Divine Disc and the Fire Rhinoceros Seal.</p><p>Even the most skilled craftsman couldn't make bricks without straw.</p><p>These two treasures were the core of the Tribulation Transcendence Formation, irreplaceable.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, the Ice Instrument Divine Disc should have been taken by the Fire Devil. At least there was a lead for that. The Fire Rhinoceros Seal's whereabouts remained unknown; even the Water Phase Lord didn't know where it had ended up.</p><p>The Ice Instrument Divine Disc was kept and nurtured within the Ice Instrument Palace.</p><p>Correspondingly, the Fire Rhinoceros Seal was usually enshrined on Fire Rhinoceros Island.</p><p>Only when someone in the Formless Immortal Sect was about to break through to Nascent Soul would the two treasures be retrieved and the Tribulation Transcendence Formation be set up.</p><p>If the Fire Rhinoceros Seal hadn't been taken away, it was most likely stored in the Fire Phase Hall.</p><p>Su Zinan now understood why Elder Yanshan had flown towards Fire Rhinoceros Island after leaving the stone beach. He had been searching for the Fire Rhinoceros Seal.</p><p>Unfortunately, Su Zinan hadn't understood this at the time.  After defeating Elder Yanshan, his mind fixated on the opportunities within the Immortal Halls. He hadn't chosen to refine the primary soul immediately. Now, knowing this, it was too late. He had missed his chance with Fire Rhinoceros Island.</p><p>Returning to the Fire Phase Hall now would certainly displease Mo Xingdao, and Zhu Wudao couldn't be expected to wait for them indefinitely.</p><p>Which was more important: the Nascent Soul opportunity or the Tribulation Transcendence Formation?</p><p>That was the question.</p><p>Moreover, Emperor Bestowal Mountain was about to witness a Dao Contention, which would inevitably trigger a chaotic battle, something Su Zinan had been anticipating.</p><p>With one soul remaining, the Devil Banner was nearing completion.</p><p>Grand cultivators were all deeply cunning and unfathomable.  The chance to capture a newly ascended Grand cultivator like Elder Yanshan alone was a stroke of luck, difficult to replicate.</p><p>Only in chaos could one find opportunities to fish in troubled waters.</p><p>Su Zinan lamented that the Three Corpses Death God Banner didn't refine avatars, preventing him from straying too far from the banner. There were no Nether Moon Guards for him to command here either.</p><p>Unaware of Su Zinan's thoughts, Mo Xingdao summoned his escaping light and flew towards Emperor Bestowal Mountain.</p><p>Su Zinan followed behind, occasionally glancing towards Fire Rhinoceros Island. His expression remained neutral, but he was weighing the gains and losses in his heart, hesitant and indecisive.</p><p>As they were flying, a crimson light suddenly illuminated the sky in the direction of Fire Rhinoceros Island.</p><p>Su Zinan was startled.</p><p>Mo Xingdao also noticed the distant phenomenon and asked curiously, "Where is that?"</p><p>"Judging by the direction, it should be the Fire Phase Hall!" Su Zinan's tone was grim.</p><p>"First the Water Phase Hall, now the Fire Phase Hall," Mo Xingdao clicked his tongue. "Do these fellows have to use such drastic methods when searching for treasures?"</p><p>The Formless Immortal Sect had been sealed for ten thousand years, remaining unchanged. The Fire Phase Hall couldn't have collapsed on its own.</p><p>"First the Water Phase Hall, then the Fire Phase Hall, this route…"</p><p>Su Zinan repeated Mo Xingdao's words, a sudden flash of inspiration striking him.</p><p>At the precipice, a figure suspected to be the Fire Devil had appeared.</p><p>The Fire Devil possessed the Ice Instrument Divine Disc and was suspected to be a Fire Phase inheritor. If he knew about the Tribulation Transcendence Formation…</p><p>All this information converged, and a figure emerged in his mind.</p><p>It seemed new and old grudges would be settled together!</p><p>Killing intent flashed in Su Zinan's eyes, quickly subsiding.  He glanced at Fire Rhinoceros Island one last time, then retracted his gaze.  There was no need for further hesitation. He flew straight towards Emperor Bestowal Mountain!</p><p>……</p><p>The divine mountain stood majestic.</p><p>Its aura was myriad and profound.</p><p>The Formless Immortal Sect had countless wondrous peaks, but none could compare to Emperor Bestowal Mountain.</p><p>At the northern foot of Emperor Bestowal Mountain, a stone path wound upwards.  The path was winding and secluded, passing through the forest, finally reaching a cluster of ancient halls halfway up the mountain.</p><p>Beyond that, shimmering lights and layers of restrictions obscured the view.</p><p>A voice echoed from the entrance of the stone path.</p><p>The voice was ethereal and somewhat intangible.</p><p>"Legend has it that the words 'Emperor Bestowal' were given by the founding ancestor of the Formless Immortal Sect. The ancestor claimed his divine abilities were bestowed by an Emperor, though there's no way to verify which 'Emperor' he referred to. Some suspect the master of the Immortal Hall was a Celestial Emperor from the Upper Realm…"</p><p>The voice was cut short by a cold laugh.</p><p>"Celestial Emperor? I think it was a mortal emperor! These righteous cultivators are so self-righteous, always eager to gild their own reputations."</p><p>The ethereal voice didn't show anger, chuckling softly. "Indeed, countless cultivators throughout history have explored the Immortal Hall, yet none could confirm the identity of its master.  A Celestial Emperor from the Upper Realm is likely just a legend. Senior Brother Fan is as sharp as ever, always hitting the nail on the head.  Back when we were young, sent out on missions by the sect, I could never conceal my actions from Senior Brother Fan's eyes. I always trailed behind, receiving only second-rate rewards. It seems things haven't changed."</p><p>As the voice grew clearer,</p><p>Light and shadow flickered on the first step of the stone path. A figure materialized, revealing Zhu Wudao.</p><p>He had been pursued by three Daoist experts but had escaped unscathed, showing no apparent injuries.</p><p>Zhu Wudao stood on the stone step, looking towards the forest beside it.</p><p>The forest was dark and dense with vegetation, seemingly empty.</p><p>However, after Zhu Wudao appeared, the shadow of an ancient tree deepened, revealing the outline of a person. It was Fan Laomo, who had arrived alone.</p><p>He laughed heartily. "It's your own fault for being so secretive.  I happened to notice Junior Brother Lu's strange behavior and followed him, eventually catching you red-handed.  However, I never imagined Junior Brother had hidden so deeply, with such grand ambitions.  The sect owes you a Grand Ceremony of Dao Attainment!"</p><p>His tone held mockery and ridicule, but also a hint of surprise.</p><p>The internal relationships within the Sky Hao Tower weren't exactly harmonious, but they weren't completely estranged either.</p><p>Zhu Wudao was not only a descendant of the Formless Immortal Sect, but also a late Nascent Soul cultivator.  He had concealed his cultivation in front of them, and no one in the entire sect had noticed.</p><p>Zhu Wudao seemed oblivious to the mockery, simply saying, "I had no choice. If my cultivation were exposed, the Quyang Mountain lineage would be forced into the open, subject to scrutiny."</p><p>"Then why did you contact me?"</p><p>Fan Laomo countered.</p><p>He had been blocked by the cloud wall and lost track of Zhu Wudao. Unexpectedly, just as he arrived at the foot of the mountain, before he could even begin his search, Zhu Wudao had invited him to meet.</p><p>"Fellow sect brothers, we know each other well. We are more trustworthy than those Daoists and those of unknown origins," Zhu Wudao said frankly.</p><p>"Trustworthy?"</p><p>Fan Laomo scoffed, but didn't refute him.</p><p>There might not be any real trust between them, but he had to admit they were indeed the most suitable partners.</p><p>However, he couldn't be fooled so easily.</p><p>Fan Laomo adopted the demeanor of the Grand Elder, his eyes flashing with intimidating light. "I'll set aside the matter of your Quyang Mountain lineage lurking within the sect for now. If you don't want your Quyang Mountain to be annihilated, tell me everything you know about the Formless Immortal Sect!"</p><p>Fan Laomo was ruthless and entirely capable of carrying out his threat.</p><p>With the Sky Hao Tower's Sect Master in seclusion, and Elder Kurong's status inferior to his own, Fan Laomo did indeed have the authority to mobilize the sect's forces to destroy Quyang Mountain.</p><p>However, Zhu Wudao showed no fear.</p><p>He calculated with his fingers, speaking calmly, "Senior Brother Fan, please be patient. The appointed time is almost here.  Once those fellow Daoists arrive, I will naturally explain the Nascent Soul opportunity clearly to you. If Senior Brother doesn't believe me, you can ascend the mountain first, as long as you possess any of the Five Phase Tokens."</p><p>In truth, Zhu Wudao was also puzzled.</p><p>The appointed time was quite flexible, enough for the Weeping Spirit Cave Master and Mo Xingdao to arrive. Yet, they were still nowhere to be seen. Had something happened?</p><p>Fan Laomo maintained his distance from Zhu Wudao, hiding in the shadows, his thoughts unknown.</p><p>As the appointed time approached,</p><p>The sound of something breaking through the air finally arrived from afar.</p><p>Then, two escaping lights appeared from the forest, their speed astonishingly fast. In the blink of an eye, they flew closer.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Mo! Fellow Daoist Su!"</p><p>Zhu Wudao's gaze sharpened slightly, taking a deep look at Mo Xingdao.  He wasn't surprised that Mo Xingdao had invited help.</p><p>"You two have finally arrived.  There's no time to lose! The Weeping Spirit Cave Master and the other fellow Daoist are close acquaintances and possess the Wood Phase Token. They likely intend to ditch us and have already ascended the mountain on their own," Zhu Wudao announced, believing this to be the only possibility.</p><p>"Eh? When did Elder Fan arrive?"</p><p>Su Zinan noticed Fan Laomo in the shadows and asked in surprise.</p><p>"I didn't expect Fellow Daoist Su to wade into these murky waters," Fan Laomo said with a forced smile.</p><p>There were no pleasantries exchanged between them. They immediately set off.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Fan Laomo deliberately lagged behind, maintaining a distance from them, and continuously made some sort of markings, not bothering to hide it from the others.</p><p>The markings were left for Duwang and Grandmaster Huaiyin. Fan Laomo's cooperation with them was born of necessity.</p><p>Since Zhu Wudao's side held the advantage in numbers, Fan Laomo naturally wanted to invite some helpers to counterbalance them.</p><p>Learning of Duwang and Grandmaster Huaiyin's whereabouts,</p><p>Su Zinan exclaimed in surprise: "Fire Rhinoceros Island?"</p>
