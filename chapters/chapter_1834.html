Chapter 1825: Severed Spiritual Nexus


The woman in the green dress was leading her demonic troops to collect the Five Elements Corona, her back to the palace gate, completely unguarded.  Here, they only considered Xiahou an enemy. For Xiahou to break through their ranks, he would first need to break the seal of the Fox Demon's Dharma Body and then overcome the Azure Fox Saint King.


They were wholly focused on guarding against Xiahou, never anticipating another uninvited guest.


Moreover, collecting the Five Elements Corona was no easy feat.  Doing so carelessly could provoke backlash from the artifact spirit.  The woman in green had to exert all her power to control the demonic formation.  On the verge of success, her concentration inevitably slackened.


At that very moment, the Azure Serpents arrived, wrapped in boundless cold Qi!


The four Azure Serpents bared their fangs and claws.  Cold Qi filled the palace, turning the interior a stark white, as if frozen solid!


The Nine Nether Demonic Fire transformed into a streak of fire, arriving alongside the cold Qi.


Azure Serpents above, Nine Nether Demonic Fire below, ignoring Xiahou, bypassing the Azure Fox Saint King, they went straight for the woman in green.


The two attacks were incredibly swift, but another streak of light was even faster.


It was a bolt of lightning, its speed beyond ordinary comprehension.


Seeing the Azure Serpents and the Demonic Fire, the Azure Fox Saint King was startled.


The Four Azure Serpent Seal, the Nine Nether Demonic Fire… distant memories were stirred. After the battle at the Formless Immortal Sect, she had thoroughly investigated Qin Sang's background.


Spiritual treasures, divine abilities… such similarities couldn't be a coincidence!


When that lightning bolt entered her field of vision, her expression completely changed.


Before this, she had never seen anyone's movement technique reach such speeds.


Even the powerful Xiahou was inferior!


With the breakthrough in the *Celestial Demon Body Refinement*, the Azure Phoenix Dharma Form had transformed. If Qin Sang fully channeled the Azure Phoenix's origin thunder power and utilized his thunder movement technique, even among the late Nascent Soul cultivators of both races, he would rank among the top.


The instant the lightning appeared, it closed in on the demonic formation.  At the last moment, the electric light dispersed, revealing a strange figure.


This person was covered in green fur, his body exuding toxic Qi.  Through the gaps in the fur, one could see rough, bark-like skin.  He resembled a humanoid monster, or perhaps an ancient tree covered in moss, yet he possessed a pair of breathtaking phoenix wings on his back.


The phoenix wings hadn't fully unfolded. The previous thunder movement was merely the force of a single flap!


Qin Sang fixed his gaze on the back of the woman in green.  Without pausing, he used his flesh and blood body to slam directly into the demonic formation!


He had arrived before the two demons, having received Mo Xingdao's warning. Sensing the peculiarity of the Five Elements Corona, he had guessed something about the Azure Fox Saint King's scheme and withdrawn from the palace to wait outside, conserving his strength.


He originally planned to wait until the two demons had fought each other to the point of exhaustion, then seize the advantage for himself.


Unexpectedly, Xiahou had hidden his true strength, instantly reversing the tide of battle. The Azure Fox Saint King was even more decisive, immediately ceasing her attack.


Seeing that the Azure Fox Saint King was about to seize the Five Elements Corona, and with Xiahou still trapped and possibly unable to stop her, Qin Sang had no choice but to act.


‘Boom!’


Like a humanoid beast, Qin Sang's vital Qi surged. His body like a heavy hammer, he single-handedly crashed into the formation.


This collision not only utilized the power of his Spirit Wood Body but also integrated the might of the Buddhist Seal.


In an instant, the demonic altar trembled violently. The demonic soldiers stumbled forward, spitting blood and screaming.


The fine net enveloping the Five Elements Corona shattered.


Warned by the woman in green, the demonic soldiers knew the power of the Five Elements Corona and dared not relax their vigilance, yet they never expected an attack from behind, and so sudden.


‘Crack!’


Only now did the thunderclap resound, echoing through the palace, deafeningly loud.


The demonic formation was in chaos.


The Azure Serpents arrived!


The four Azure Serpents rushed above the demonic formation, looking down. Eight fierce demonic eyes locked onto the woman in green.


‘Roar!’


The Azure Serpents roared in unison, opening their gaping maws. Blinding blue light erupted from their mouths.


Four incredibly condensed cold flames, like four dark blue suns, descended from the sky, bringing boundless chill!


The Four Azure Serpent Seal was a true spiritual treasure. Although Qin Sang didn't cultivate the Ice Dao, which hindered its full power, it was still far superior to ordinary pseudo-spiritual treasures.


In terms of the treasure's inherent power, the Grey Warbler Sword was certainly inferior to the Four Azure Serpent Seal. It was only because the sword was more suited to his sword techniques that Qin Sang didn't often use the seal.


Once the spiritual treasure appeared, it displayed its ferocious might.


‘Whoosh!’


In an instant, the spot where the woman in green stood was engulfed in cold flames.


Within the dark blue, the cold flames flickered, emitting cracking sounds, as if trying to freeze the woman in green into an ice sculpture.


At this moment, the woman in green felt a terrifying chill.


The chill pierced her bones, invading her entire body, as if her flesh and blood, even her Nascent Soul, would be frozen solid.


Until this moment, the woman in green hadn't even seen her enemy's face, unaware of who her enemy was.


Escape!


This was her only thought. The enemy was too terrifying.  Only by fighting back with all her might would her benefactor have a chance to save her.


The woman in green's expression was ferocious. Fine scales grew on her neck, emitting a green luster, desperately resisting the chill and the cold flames, struggling to charge forward.


But Qin Sang didn't give her a chance to resist. The Nine Nether Demonic Fire followed close behind the Azure Serpents. The fire streak, like an arrow, aimed at the woman's back, piercing straight through while she was still grappling with the cold flames.


‘Pfft!’


The woman in green coughed up blood, her face deathly pale.  A sharp pain shot through her chest.


‘Boom!’


Demonic fire erupted, instantly turning the woman in green into a ball of flames.


The Demonic Fire and the cold flames practically fused, engulfing the woman in green.


Whether it was due to the violent impact of the chill or her Nascent Soul being scorched by the Demonic Fire, in this critical moment, she felt a disorientation. She gritted her teeth, her body twisting like a snake, becoming incredibly supple. Before she could react, she suddenly felt a tightening around her neck.


Qin Sang had appeared behind her without her noticing. His right arm plunged into the flames, his hand like a vise, gripping her neck.


‘Crack!’


Bones shattered.


Destructive power surged into the woman's body, obliterating all signs of life.


With a flicker of light and shadow, the body in Qin Sang's hand transformed into a green snake, its eyes lifeless, already dead!


The Nine Nether Demonic Fire originated from the fire lotus, controlled by the power of his Nascent Soul.


Spiritual power controlled the Four Azure Serpent Seal.


Combined with Qin Sang's own physical cultivation, comparable to mid-Nascent Soul, the power of cultivating Nascent Soul, spiritual power, and physical body simultaneously was on full display. With all three forces unleashed, he instantly killed the woman in green!


‘Whoosh!’


A burst of demonic fire erupted from the demonic snake's body, transforming the surrounding area into a sea of flames.  The residual power of the fire was still astonishing, killing countless demonic soldiers.


Even those demonic soldiers who survived by taking shelter within the demonic formation were severely injured. With hatred in his eyes, Mo Xingdao charged into the formation, slaughtering indiscriminately.


Next, he would face the true adversary. Qin Sang wouldn't waste time on these minions. Casually unleashing the residual flames, he took advantage of the situation to leave the remaining soldiers to Mo Xingdao, then turned to face the Azure Fox Saint King behind him.


From the moment he appeared to the killing of the woman in green, not even a breath had passed.


The Azure Fox Saint King instinctively moved to rescue her, but before her attack could be launched, she saw the green snake's corpse.


She met Qin Sang's gaze, saw the sneer on his lips. There was no hatred or mockery in his eyes, only indifference, as if looking at a dead person.


The impression of that glance was etched into her mind.


Darkness descended.


The Azure Fox Saint King felt as if she had been ripped from the palace.  The Five Elements Corona, the well platform, the palace, even the roar of the black dragon behind her, the sound of Xiahou breaking the formation, the whistling of the turbulent flow—all vanished.


A deathly silence descended, endless loneliness washing over her.


Only starlight remained in the darkness. She felt herself pulled into the boundless void, with no support above, below, left, or right.


“It truly is him!”


How could the Azure Fox Saint King not know the Formless Immortal Sect's famed Seven Constellations Sword Formation?


On Emperor Bestowal Mountain, when she attacked Qin Sang, she had discerned his mastery of the Seven Constellations Sword Formation.


When she investigated Qin Sang's background, she attempted to find this sword formation within the Golden Aspect Hall's inheritance, but found nothing.


He had actually appeared here!


How did he reach Nascent Soul? What method did he use to arrive in this realm? When did he collude with Mo Xingdao?


The Azure Fox Saint King had no time to ponder these questions because she knew that the greatest crisis of her life was imminent.


To deal with Xiahou, she had almost exhausted her full strength. Her three Dharma Bodies were still maintaining the formation to trap Xiahou.


From an ordinary fox demon, she had climbed step by step to the peak, relying not only on her cunning and ruthlessness but also on her keen perception and precise grasp of timing.


Because of this, she understood how cunningly Qin Sang had chosen this moment, how ruthless his attack had been.


Qin Sang had instantly killed the snake demon, disrupted the demonic formation, completely severing her possibility of borrowing external forces, then pulled her into the sword formation to prevent her from rejoining forces with Xiahou.


At this moment, she was completely isolated.


However, Xiahou's escape was imminent. The Azure Fox Saint King didn't believe Qin Sang would abandon the precious treasure out of hatred, willingly letting Xiahou take the Five Elements Corona.


Mo Xingdao was nearly crippled, only capable of slaughtering demonic soldiers. He had no ability to seize the Five Elements Corona. She still had a chance!


A fierce glint flashed in the Azure Fox Saint King's eyes.


Countless sword stars twinkled.


All seven constellations emitted dazzling starlight, especially the primary stars of each constellation, which shone the brightest.


The seven primary stars grew brighter and brighter, then illusory figures emerged from the sword stars.


The seven figures were all Qin Sang, his seven Sword Souls.  They gazed upon the Azure Fox Saint King beneath the starry sky, their eyes slightly vacant, yet the boundless killing intent emanating from the Sword Souls couldn't be ignored.


Seeing the seven Sword Souls, the Azure Fox Saint King felt increasingly uneasy.


Qin Sang's ability to deploy the complete sword formation single-handedly was beyond her expectations, but this wasn't the source of her unease.


The *Seven Constellations Sword Formation* could seal heaven and earth, acting as a trapping formation.


If Qin Sang merely wanted to trap her, he should have concealed the seven Sword Souls within the sword stars, making it exceedingly difficult to break the formation.


Yet now, the seven Sword Souls had openly appeared.


The seven Sword Souls simultaneously formed hand seals. All the sword stars instantly radiated brilliant starlight.


The Grey Warbler Sword itself was hidden within the sword formation. As if sensing its master's killing intent, it emitted a resonant hum.


The night sky was as bright as day!


Between the constellations, starlight intertwined, the seven constellations resembling seven magnificent giant swords, erupting with astonishing sword intent.


The sword intent locked onto the Azure Fox Saint King.  Suddenly, the stars fell.


‘Swish!’


The Azure Fox Saint King's pupils constricted.  In her eyes, the starlight vanished, leaving only seven divine swords.


No, at the center of the seven divine swords, there was another sword!


That sword contained the power of the seven divine swords, the core of the entire sword formation.  Endless starlight was drawn to this sword, emitting an earth-shattering tiger's roar.


In an instant, the starlight twisted, truly transforming into a white tiger, carrying unparalleled ferocity, leaping down!


At the same time, a bolt of lightning, no less dazzling than the starlight, tore through the void, charging into the formation.


Qin Sang, with his green fur fluttering, rapidly approached.  His astonishing momentum and the white tiger's ferocity locked onto the Azure Fox Saint King, his killing intent undisguised.


Her mind shaken, the Azure Fox Saint King hurriedly threw the silver ring into the air.


The ring of light trembled, transforming into a stream of light that met the white tiger's ferocity.  The instant it made contact, the ring suddenly expanded, encasing the white tiger's ferocity within.


The Azure Fox Saint King rapidly formed hand seals, her breath ragged, her face suddenly draining of color. The ring of light instantly contracted, tightening around the white tiger's neck.


She was willing to pay any price to impede the white tiger's ferocity.


Since Qin Sang had the intention to kill her, there must be a flaw in the sword formation.  As long as she blocked this killing blow and escaped the sword formation, she might still have a sliver of hope.


Simultaneously, the Azure Fox Saint King transformed, revealing her true Azure Fox form.


The Azure Fox's size wasn't much different from an ordinary fox, small and delicate, inexplicably evoking a sense of pity.


She raised her fox head high, uttering incomprehensible murmurs. A point of white light appeared on her brow.


Within the white light was a fox mark.


The mark detached from the fox and flew up, like a full moon, clearly revealing a fox demon within.


The Azure Fox simultaneously sent out a piece of warm jade. The warm jade, actually soft jade, as pliable as water, merged with the full moon and was immediately absorbed by the fox demon within.


The fox demon instantly transformed into a Blood Fox, exuding astonishing ferocity.  It took a step forward, its body expanding, emitting a sharp shriek, like a blood-red sword, lunging straight at Qin Sang.


At the same time, the Azure Fox's eyes fixated on Qin Sang, her charming eyes filled with a potent allure.


Her charm technique had failed on Qin Sang before, but that time it was her Dharma Body that attacked.


Now, it was her true body, holding nothing back.  As long as she could charm Qin Sang for an instant, she could escape, perhaps even turn the tables!


Unexpectedly, Qin Sang's gaze remained indifferent, undisturbed, completely unaffected.


The next moment, a scene that shocked the Azure Fox even more unfolded.


As the Blood Fox approached, Qin Sang didn't dodge or evade. A faint, precious light suddenly appeared on his body, its color clear, its light pure.


Under the radiance of the precious light, even the green fur seemed to become transparent, his inner and outer self clear and bright, pure as琉璃(lapis lazuli/colored glaze - context suggests a hardened, perfected state).


Vajra Lapis Lazuli Body!


Qin Sang's eyes, like crystals, showed no fluctuation. His speed increased instead of decreasing. He charged straight towards the Blood Fox, lightly raising his right arm and striking out with a palm.


‘Slap!’


It hit the Blood Fox squarely in the face.


Lapis Lazuli precious light converged in his palm, ripples of water faintly visible.  A surge of overwhelming power erupted, like a seal but not a seal, or perhaps all seals combined, no longer confined to a single form.


Under the Azure Fox's shocked gaze, the Blood Fox let out a shrill shriek. Its ferocious aura was suppressed by an even stronger force.  It couldn't even pierce Qin Sang's palm.  With a resounding boom, it exploded into a mist of blood. Qin Sang emerged from the mist!


Lightning closed in instantly.


For the first time, a look of terror appeared on the Azure Fox's face.  Her fur stood on end, wildly dancing. Connected by a strange kind of silken thread, it formed a soft armor, offering a final resistance.


What greeted her was another simple palm strike.


The Azure Fox's soft armor shattered, she coughed up blood and stumbled back. Before she could regain her footing, she felt an infinite killing intent descend upon her, her mind reeling.


The Grey Warbler Sword had appeared above her head without her noticing.  The seven Sword Souls formed the Seven Souls Killing Formation.


In an instant, the sword struck!


‘Swish!’


Sword light crisscrossed, killing intent overwhelming.


Shattered armor fluttered like fallen leaves, blood splattered. The Azure Fox's eyes glazed over, a horrifying wound nearly splitting her body in two. She fell backward.


Outside the palace.


Within the turbulent flow, a green light flickered.  A phantom Azure Fox quietly appeared—it was the Azure Fox Saint King.


Even having just faced a near-death experience, even in her current weakened state, her eyes remained resolute. Without looking back, she attempted to escape.  But a point of sword light, appearing from nowhere, suddenly erupted with overwhelming sword intent at her brow.


Instantly, she froze, all life extinguished.


Inside the palace.


Qin Sang slowly turned, gazing coldly outside.


This sword strike was the very technique he had comprehended from the Chengying Sword.


Within a certain range, his sword locked onto spiritual nexus. Anyone who harbored killing intent towards him could be sensed. Once his opponent was locked onto by his sword heart, regardless of movement techniques or illusory forms, they couldn't escape, unless they instantly moved beyond his perception.


Based on his understanding of the Azure Fox Saint King, as long as there was a sliver of hope, this fox would cling to it tightly.


Similarly, if death was certain, she would undoubtedly self-destruct, taking a piece of flesh from her enemy even in death.


There was still a powerful enemy remaining. Qin Sang needed to end this quickly, but didn't want to suffer heavy injuries himself.


Therefore, Qin Sang had deliberately left an opening when executing the Seven Souls Killing Formation.


A path to survival, also a path to destruction!
