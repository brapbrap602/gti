Chapter 1811: The Jade Elder


White Tiger's baleful aura permeated everything. Coming from the starry sky, it returned to the void, the tiger's shadow vanishing into nothingness.
The divine beast White Tiger seemed to have merely made a patrol, but the evil ghost was already utterly extinguished, its form collapsing.
Qin Sang flashed to the front of the evil ghost, his right palm reaching out, passing through the ghost's brow, and grabbing something from its skull.
A transparent orb.
The orb was pure and flawless, like crystal, only the size of a bean.
"What is this?"
Qin Sang was certain this orb wasn't a demon core, but just now, the evil ghost had been about to detonate it. The White Tiger's baleful aura had annihilated it in time, preserving the orb.
"It seems to be condensed from pure flower venom…"
Qin Sang discerned a clue, his expression slightly hardening.  With extreme caution, he sealed the orb and stored it in his Thousand Jun Ring.
Now wasn't the time to investigate.
With the evil ghost dead, the flower spirits weren't frightened away. Instead, the resentment in their eyes deepened, and the blood flowing down their cheeks became even more crimson and dazzling.
Resentment drove the flower spirits mad. They shrieked at Qin Sang, their teeth like fangs. The screams contained a heart-chilling, dense resentment, piercingly shrill, echoing throughout the Whitebone Flower Field.
The void surged with wind and clouds.
The clouds were a fusion of resentment and flower venom, pitch-black as ink.
The vibrant pollen vanished, dyed black. Clouds of resentment and poison filled the void, representing the deepest resentment imaginable.
'Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!'
A hurricane seemed to sweep through the Whitebone Flower Field, violently shaking the venomous clouds. The howling sound was deafening.
The overwhelming black clouds continuously twisted, finally forming giant black dragons that charged straight towards Qin Sang.
Dense resentment enveloped Qin Sang. Illusions of flower spirits materialized around him, staring fixedly, extending their arms to grab him, attempting to drag him into the resentment, to share their eternal torment.
Qin Sang indeed felt a strange tearing force. He snorted coldly, and thunder suddenly flashed in his eyes.
A point of lightning materialized, revealing an incredibly complex divine rune.
The divine rune shot into the sky, piercing through layers of venomous clouds.
In the next moment, a bright burst of lightning erupted within the black clouds. Those with keen eyesight could see a Thunder Seal at the center of the lightning.
Mysterious runes flashed within the Thunder Seal—it was the Five Thunders Heavenly Heart Seal!
The divine rune, carrying the profound third-tier Dharma of the High Divine Firmament Scripture, was now unleashed by Qin Sang for the first time. The rune transformed into a seal, commanding thunder, enacting Heavenly punishment!
A clap of thunder out of a clear sky!
The Thunder Seal emitted a blinding light, thunder rumbled and lightning flashed, shaking heaven and earth, a soul-stirring spectacle.
The lightning was too bright.  Qin Sang stood beneath the Thunder Seal, his figure almost invisible for that instant.
When the lightning dissipated, the area around Qin Sang was completely clear.  The flower spirit illusions that had been pulling at him were struck by lightning and instantly annihilated.
Looking down from above, a large hole appeared in the center of the venomous clouds, completely clear, purged by the thunder.
The remaining flower spirits seemed stunned, their shrieks ceasing.
Time seemed to freeze for a moment.
Qin Sang exhaled softly, nodding in satisfaction. He was very pleased with the power of the Five Thunders Heavenly Heart Seal, his painstaking efforts to obtain the High Divine Firmament Scripture not in vain.
Originally, Qin Sang had thought that if he could gain a powerful divine ability while pacifying the Yuan Qi, it wouldn't be a wasted effort.
He had to admit, the Five Thunders Heavenly Heart Seal Rune exceeded his expectations, and he had only been cultivating it for a decade, far from mastering it.
Worthy of being a Thunder Dharma!
No wonder the High Divine Firmament Scripture seemed to have an uncertain future, yet the Thunderous Left and Right Mansions hadn't considered changing their Dharma. Countless disciples continued to flock to it, and the Dao Court also seemed to attach great importance to the High Divine Firmament Scripture.
While contemplating, Qin Sang didn't pause, flying towards the edge of the flower field.
He didn't know what this space was or where it was located.
Unable to discern direction, Qin Sang could only choose a random direction, escaping this flower field first.
If the flower spirits couldn't pursue him beyond the field, his situation should improve.
Flower spirits were born from spirit flowers. Based on common sense, Qin Sang judged that they shouldn't be able to stray too far from the flowers.
As for the evil ghost-like Flower Immortal, judging from the orb, it was definitely connected to the flower spirits, but there was only one such ghost, so he couldn't determine its origin for now.
Qin Sang's target was a mountain pass.
The edge of the flower field was surrounded by mountains. Beyond the mountains lay a vast expanse.  Ahead of Qin Sang was a clear opening.
It wasn't a true mountain pass. Between two tall mountains was a ridge, about halfway up the mountain, looking like a gateway.
'Crack!'
Thunder Escape shattered the venomous clouds, moving at lightning speed.
First the Thunder Seal, then Thunder Escape. Anyone who saw this would surely mistake Qin Sang for a Thunder Dharma cultivator.
Of course, the Grey Warbler Sword, clearing the path for its master, displayed swordsmanship that was also extraordinary.
Sword light carved a path, dancing with lightning.
Flower spirits fell one after another beneath the sword, and the spirit flowers in the Whitebone Flower Field withered in swathes.
Yet, flower spirits still relentlessly lunged at Qin Sang, endless in number.
'Boom!'
Sword Qi arced like a rainbow, cleaving a chasm in the venomous clouds.
The next moment, Qin Sang landed on the mountain ridge and saw the world beyond. However, the sight was despairing, and his expression instantly darkened.
'Whoo! Whoo!'
Behind him, the venomous clouds billowed, engulfing the mountain ridge.
The flower spirits weren't confined to the flower field as Qin Sang had thought. They could leave.
Ahead, the terrain was open, another valley surrounded by mountains, with the same white bones and spirit flowers.
It was another, even larger flower field!
Here, the bones were ashen grey, and the spirit flowers sparse, but they still nurtured flower spirits.
When he appeared on the ridge, he saw flower spirits sitting up in their flower cocoons, turning their heads in unison, their deep eyes fixated on him, resentment brewing within.
Especially after the venomous clouds chased Qin Sang, overflowing the ridge, the resentment intensified to its peak. Blood flowed from their eyes as they opened their mouths to shriek.
Enemies on all sides.
Having just escaped one flower field, Qin Sang was once again in a predicament.
"Could this space be a world of evil spirits?"
Qin Sang's expression was grave.
These flower spirits were unheard of, rooted amongst white bones, nurtured by them.
Thinking of the evil ghost he had just slain, Qin Sang felt a wave of unease.
Fields of flowers, similarly eerie flower spirits, it was hard to believe this was naturally formed.  It couldn't be compared to an illusion conjured by some divine ability.
Was it still a flower field beyond the mountains?
Just how many of these flower fields were there?
Qin Sang didn't know.  Based on the differences between the flower fields, he judged that the quality of the one ahead should be lower than the one behind.
Following this logic, continuing in this direction, the quality of the flower fields should decrease, perhaps offering a way out.
With this limited information, Qin Sang could only make this deduction, which needed verification.
Silently estimating the limit of the venomous orb and how long he could endure, Qin Sang paused on the ridge for a moment, then the Grey Warbler Sword transformed into a rainbow of sword light.
Without a second evil ghost blocking his path, although Qin Sang hadn't managed to capture the first one alive, he traversed the second flower field without much hindrance.
Man and sword crossed the flower field once more.
Behind him, the vast venomous clouds and the relentless flower spirits followed like a ghostly procession, a spectacular sight.
If he couldn't shake off the flower spirits, Qin Sang would be worn down even if the venom didn't kill him.
He glanced coldly behind him, then looked ahead. Noticing a few towering mountains, his expression shifted slightly, and he flew straight towards the tallest one, landing on its peak in the blink of an eye.
He looked up at the sky.
The sky was gloomy and seemingly deep, but Qin Sang could faintly sense a distorting force within the void.
He didn't dare fly higher, wary of this power.
Gazing at the heavens, Qin Sang's face was contemplative.
As he flew, Qin Sang continuously pondered various escape methods.
If he couldn't shake off the flower spirits, he had to leave this place.
He thought of the drifting patches of fog that could reflect the image of the flower field. Did that mean the fog was a passage connecting the flower field to the outside world?
The sky was deep, and there were no obvious signs for the moment. Qin Sang trusted the Heavenly Eye Butterfly's abilities and instructed it to watch the sky, noting any unusual signs.
Qin Sang lowered his gaze, surveying his surroundings.
He saw countless mountains in the distance, rising and falling, their arrangement orderly, not chaotic.
He could imagine that between the mountains were likely more Whitebone Flower Fields.
The more he saw, the more he felt the strangeness of this place.
The venomous clouds were about to engulf the mountaintop. Qin Sang quickly scanned the mountains. The flower spirits in the nearby fields were also alarmed, and plumes of black clouds converged towards him.
The clouds were too thick to see the light of divine abilities or magical treasures.
Unable to locate the two True Masters, Qin Sang could only act according to his own strategy.
Just as he was about to look away, his gaze suddenly froze.
"The layout of these mountains... seems familiar…"
Qin Sang muttered to himself.
Comparing this place to a seemingly unrelated scene, a gleam appeared in Qin Sang's eyes.
He discovered that the arrangement of the mountains and valleys perfectly matched the layout of the palace!
If he considered the valleys as palace halls and the mountains as the training grounds and passageways between them…
Looking back in the direction he had come from, he could see another valley similar in size to the flower field he had initially fallen into, positioned side-by-side, corresponding to two main halls.
The flower field he had just crossed, and the several nearby valleys, matched the palaces in the ninth section in both location and size.
Looking forward, directly ahead was a massive mountain range composed of countless peaks, extending further into another thick mountain range, leading to the distance.
Large and small flower fields were scattered amongst them.
These two mountain ranges reminded Qin Sang of the large training ground in the eighth section of the palace and the passageway in the seventh section.
Although Qin Sang didn't understand why there was this correspondence, this discovery was undoubtedly good news.
"If I travel along the mountain range, at the position corresponding to the palace gate, will that be the exit of this space?"
This thought flashed through Qin Sang's mind, and he immediately flew away from the mountaintop.
'Rumble!'
Thunder echoed through the mountains, a resounding boom.
Black clouds had already risen from the distant flower fields.
It wasn't that Qin Sang didn't want to conceal himself, but concealment was useless. The flower spirits were extremely sensitive to the aura of outsiders, and Qin Sang had tried various secret techniques, all to no avail.
Soon, Qin Sang reached the mountain range corresponding to the training ground. The black clouds blotted out the sky, flower spirits swarmed, and their shrill cries rose and fell, a terrifying sound.
He seemed to be flying with a horde of ghosts, a shocking sight.
Mountain ranges swiftly retreated behind him. A part of Qin Sang's mind connected with the Heavenly Eye Butterfly, sensing its thoughts.
As expected, the Heavenly Eye Butterfly had noticed something. Qin Sang subconsciously glanced at the sky, a contemplative look on his face.
Soon, Qin Sang crossed the mountains.
Ahead, a mountain ridge snaked across the land like a dragon.
His speed didn't diminish. As he flew, he continued to ponder, his gaze sweeping across the peaks below, when he suddenly remembered something.
While passing through the seventh section passageway of the palace, the Heavenly Eye Butterfly had spotted a hidden door on the wall.
If the palace corresponded to the flower fields, what did the hidden door correspond to?
Qin Sang quickly scanned the entire mountain range, immediately locking onto a few peaks. Based on distance, he deduced that the location of the hidden door was nearby!
'Whoosh!'
Lightning streaked across the mountains, suddenly plummeting towards a mountain.
At the same time, Qin Sang instructed the Heavenly Eye Butterfly to shift its gaze from the sky and observe the surroundings. After a while, it made a discovery.
Qin Sang's figure flickered, landing in front of a stone wall.
Behind him was a flower field. This stone wall was part of a peak at the edge of the mountain range.
There was a very well-hidden door on the stone wall!
Qin Sang's expression changed, wondering where the hidden door led. Then he frowned, looking at the bones beneath his feet.
The bones here were also ashen grey, but among them were scattered segments of black bones.
Qin Sang drew the black bones into his palm, confirming they were human bones, but why were their colors different?
The black bones were incomplete, scattered in several places.
The venomous clouds were already approaching.
Unable to figure out the reason, Qin Sang decided to break open the hidden door directly.
There was a venomous restriction on the hidden door, similar to the archway in the seventh section, but the restrictive force was somewhat chaotic, seemingly incomplete, and the hidden door also had a few cracks.
Qin Sang pressed his palm against the hidden door, absorbing a small amount of venomous power to find the flow.  With a clang, his sword struck the stone door!
'Boom!'
The restriction vibrated, and the stone door opened a crack.
Simultaneously, a clap of thunder boomed, echoing through the mountains.
The mountains were bathed in white light. The Thunder Seal reappeared, annihilating the closest pursuing flower spirits.
Qin Sang's figure flashed, slipping through the opening and behind the stone door, quickly closing it behind him, vigilance in his heart.
Entering the hidden passage, the cacophony was shut out, finally bringing quiet.
At the same time, Qin Sang keenly noticed that the void here was free of venom, the flower venom blocked outside.
He focused his attention on the stone door, waiting for a while.  Confirming that the flower spirits weren't attacking it, he felt a sense of relief.
A large amount of flower venom had accumulated in his body.  He had finally found a place to recuperate.
But he still didn't know where this was.  Qin Sang remained cautious, glancing around. He saw a cave, seemingly not very deep.
The Grey Warbler Sword transformed into a protective aura of sword light.
Qin Sang quietly walked deeper, soon reaching the end.
The sight before him made his pupils constrict slightly.
The end of the cave was a circular stone chamber with smooth walls, clearly carved by human hands.
In the center of the chamber was an altar, and on the altar was a statue. Three meditation cushions were scattered in front of the altar.
On one of the cushions was a skeleton, kneeling facing the altar, suggesting it had been worshipping the statue on the altar at the time of its death.
The skeleton was entirely pitch-black, identical to the broken bones outside the cave.
The statue was seven inches tall, carved from white jade with a warm texture, depicting a kind-looking elderly man.
The Jade Elder had a celestial air, truly possessing the demeanor of an immortal.
Qin Sang paused, first noticing the skeleton.  His gaze swept over the Jade Elder, and the instant his eyes met the statue's, he felt an inexplicable sense of malice, a chill running down his spine.
He didn't sense any unusual fluctuations from the Jade Elder. Staring for a moment, he suspected the malice might be an effect of the sculptor's particular technique.
However, after arriving in this realm, Qin Sang had witnessed firsthand the Earth Gods who practiced the Divine Dao, as well as the peculiar Dharma of the Daoists and the mysterious Celestial Gods.  He didn't dare take any statues lightly.
He stood where he was, gazing at the Jade Elder, his expression grave.
