<h1>Chapter 1510: Deadly Trap (4k)</h1><p>Outside, a boundless expanse of white mist.</p><p>Next is a rapidly expanding sea of fire.</p><p>The fiery sea is multicolored, the sound of the flames gradually weakening.  Compared to the dazzling Linglong Tower radiating light in the air, its colors are less vibrant.</p><p>Deeper in, crimson flames are erupting.</p><p>And in a corner, a black spirit fire shrinks.</p><p>Everyone seems to have entered a spirit fire realm. The scene before them is too beautiful to be real, yet this beauty hides dangers that send shivers down everyone's spine!</p><p>‘Puff!’</p><p>Nan Ming Li Fire, like a newborn sun, stains a void crimson, consuming everything.</p><p>The Mountain and River Illusion and the hundred-foot shadow are destroyed by the crimson flames.</p><p>The next moment, a dark light is propelled out by the impact of Nan Ming Li Fire, flying away.</p><p>Inside the dark light, it is clearly the Hunmo Order.</p><p>The Hunmo Order tumbles, its brilliance extremely dim, as if struck by a tremendous force, its speed even faster than before.</p><p>Before anyone can see if the order itself is damaged, it ‘whooshes’ away into the depths of the mist.</p><p>Simultaneously, those with sharp eyes see a white light flashing within the Nan Ming Li Fire.</p><p>It must be Tian Peng Da Sheng's Mountain River Pearl!</p><p>The crowd is experienced, they focus on the Mountain River Pearl.  A flash of white light, and the pearl plummets from the air, pale and dull, sinking into the deep void in an instant.</p><p>At the last moment, someone vaguely sees a crack appear in the center of the Mountain River Pearl, almost splitting the entire pearl.</p><p>This treasure has a unique function, and its body is not as hard as swords, armor, or the like. Far inferior to the Hunmo Order, directly colliding with the Nan Ming Li Fire, it is almost impossible to survive.</p><p>The magical treasures of two of the world's top experts are instantly defeated.</p><p>At the edge of the sea of fire.</p><p>Bifa is hopping mad, cursing.</p><p>Seeing the Nine Nether Magic Fire, he instantly recognizes Qin Sang's identity.</p><p>These past ten years have been incredibly unlucky.</p><p>It all began with his pursuit of Qin Sang across thousands of miles, along with the cunning fox and the frog fish.</p><p>Since then.</p><p>First, the treasures coveted by many demons mysteriously disappeared.</p><p>Then he was hunted by Qin Sang, using self-mutilating abilities to escape, only to abandon his overseas territory and return to the demon realm to heal his wounds. Then, out of the blue, Tong Lingyu came to his door, and they fought, killing the cunning fox.</p><p>Bifa was severely injured and escaped again, forced to seek refuge with Tian Peng Da Sheng, extremely frustrated.</p><p>Enemies meeting, their hatred is intensified!</p><p>He harbors deep hatred for Qin Sang and Feng Shangshi, and seeing Qin Sang dare to act recklessly in front of so many demons and monsters, he believes his chance for revenge has come.</p><p>His cultivation is not as high as Tian Peng Da Sheng and Hunmo Old Man, but his innate ability excels in fire control.  He has some means of dealing with the impact of the flame waves, and steadies himself only slightly later than the other two. Without hesitation, he burns his blood essence, preparing to kill his enemy.</p><p>Bifa directly reveals his demon form, demon fire like blood, its momentum quite powerful.</p><p>Then, he witnesses this astonishing sight.</p><p>“Ugh!”</p><p>Bifa's eyes bulge, freezing in mid-air, his curses solidified in his throat, as if someone has squeezed his neck.</p><p>The hatred in his eyes is replaced by terror.</p><p>A deep fear of the Nan Ming Li Fire.</p><p>Similar to Bifa, relying on special abilities or treasures to withstand the flame waves, a few more demons and monsters recover first.</p><p>They are all renowned experts, seasoned veterans, quick to react.  Having barely regained their footing, they activate their treasures, reveal their demon forms, or use their abilities, following closely behind Hunmo and Tian Peng's attack.</p><p>If Qin Sang hesitates even a moment, even if he's briefly blocked by Hunmo and the others.</p><p>Once all the demons and monsters recover, he'll be surrounded and attacked, becoming nothing but mush—hoping to survive such an attack is a fantasy. Any spiritual treasure is useless; he will simply evaporate from existence, a shared fate with Liuli.</p><p>The Sun God Tree unleashed its power, the Mountain River Pearl cracked, and the Hunmo Order disappeared.</p><p>This is a warning!</p><p>Yue Mo is famous in the Boundless Sea, holding equal status with Yu Yi Yuan Jun, and known for being charming and androgynous.</p><p>He has a crescent moon pattern on his brow, hence the name Yue Mo. This is actually because of his unique cultivation method; his innate treasure needs to constantly absorb moonlight, leaving a mark on his brow.</p><p>When the impact of the flame waves comes, the crescent moon on Yue Mo's forehead shines brightly, scattering its clear light.</p><p>A shimmering light, like a transparent garment, shielded Yue Mo, rippling gently in waves.  The flames partially deflected upon contact, lessening their impact.</p><p>Yue Mo gracefully retreated, a fingertip tracing his brow.  A crescent moon detached itself, transforming into a razor-sharp, spinning crescent blade that slashed out with incredible speed.</p><p>Witnessing the destruction of the Hunmo Order and the Shanhe Orb, Yue Mo was shocked and momentarily hesitated, his crescent blade faltering.</p><p>Six firebirds remained on the Sun God Tree.  Where three had flown away, red flames swirled, rapidly coalescing – clearly more than a single attack was possible.</p><p>If angered, who could withstand the onslaught of several firebirds?  Unlike the Shanhe Orb, this was his life essence treasure, intrinsically linked to his cultivation.  Its destruction would cause a devastating backlash; serious injury would be the least of his worries, let alone claiming the treasure.</p><p>What difference did it make whether the treasures within the Exquisite Pagoda fell into the hands of this mysterious person, or were taken by Hunmo or Tianpeng?</p><p>Yue Mo would not willingly work for someone else's benefit.</p><p>The other demons harbored similar thoughts, each with their own hidden agenda.  The Yao Wang were slightly more united than the demon cultivators, but their gathering at Tianpeng Mountain was for plunder, not loyalty.</p><p>Indeed, Hunmo the Elder was affected by the damage to the Hunmo Order.</p><p>Simultaneously with the Sun God Bird's explosion…</p><p>Not far from the battlefield, a bloody light flashed, ghostly fog churned, and Hunmo the Elder's figure solidified, ready to advance.</p><p>Remembering Qin Sang's endless tricks and lightning escape technique vividly, he instantly used his shapeshifting ability to quickly close the distance.  This ability's drain on his ghostly form depended on the distance, which was still manageable.</p><p>Even if his treasure couldn't kill Qin Sang, he could intercept him.  A direct kill would be even better; he could then beat the Great Saint Tianpeng to the Futu Pagoda.</p><p>However, Hunmo the Elder never expected Qin Sang to have more up his sleeve.  The complete annihilation of the Hunmo Order left him pale and trembling.</p><p>At that moment…</p><p>A new upheaval!</p><p>The South Ming Li Fire's range was vast; its power diminished away from the explosion's epicenter, but the flames wouldn't dissipate quickly.</p><p>Suddenly, a mass of icy blue light erupted from the fiery inferno, revealing a huge snake!</p><p>The intense contrast of frigid and scorching created a powerful effect.</p><p>The snake, ferocious and aggressive, unleashed the power of the spiritual treasure, previously forcibly compressed by Liuli, attacking Hunmo the Elder without hesitation.</p><p>Qin Sang used the Sun God Bird to pave the way, firstly to avoid being trapped and to ensure a swift victory, and secondly to mask the four-tiered snake seal using the South Ming Li Fire’s aura.</p><p>The Sun God Bird’s attack was impossible to conceal.  Liuli, however, cultivating the "Tongbao Scripture," had some control over the four-tiered snake seal. The Sun God Bird served as the perfect distraction.</p><p>The demons' attention was riveted on the Sun God Tree; little did they suspect another spiritual treasure lay in wait.</p><p>This was a deadly trap Qin Sang had set for Hunmo the Elder, counting on the Elder's greed for the Futu Pagoda.</p><p>Of course, if Hunmo the Elder didn't fall for it, Qin Sang wouldn't lose out either; he could simply enter the Exquisite Pagoda unhindered.</p><p>Liuli closed her eyes, achieving a state of oneness, her mind immersed in the spiritual treasure. She fully activated the "Tongbao Scripture," manipulating the hand seals, unleashing the most powerful transformation, the one used by Yin Changsheng.</p><p>The snake soared, its fierce eyes fixed on Hunmo the Elder, its icy flames gathering in its mouth before merging with its body!</p><p>Liuli's execution naturally couldn't match Yin Changsheng's, but its power surpassed that of any ordinary treasure.</p><p>Another spiritual treasure!</p><p>The demons were stunned, their minds reeling in disbelief.</p><p>What exactly *was* this person?</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>The icy flames shot out like a meteor.</p><p>Hunmo the Elder was first in its path.</p><p>The imminent danger made his scalp tingle; he sensed death’s approach.</p><p>His senior disciple, still reeling from the shockwave, was utterly demoralized upon witnessing this, crying out in terror:</p><p>“Master!”</p><p>In this desperate moment, Hunmo the Elder let out a long howl.  The ghostly fog around him boiled, and his body, on the verge of fully materializing, abruptly stopped.</p><p>Then, he reversed into his spectral form; the ghostly fog surged back, engulfing him.</p><p>At the edge of the inferno…</p><p>Where Hunmo the Elder had stood, a ghostly fog arose.  Before the ghost could appear, a scream echoed from within the fog.</p><p>The cry was excruciating, filled with despair and resentment.  The intelligent ghost knew what Hunmo intended.</p><p>However, the ghost spirit could do nothing, unable to resist the will of the Hunmo Elder, only obediently becoming a scapegoat.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>Icy flames pierced through the ghost mist.</p><p>The ghost spirit's cries abruptly ceased.</p><p>The Hunmo Elder's figure appeared at the edge of the fire sea.  Countless black ghost markings had appeared on his face, looking incredibly eerie.</p><p>The moment the ghost spirit fell, the markings shattered!</p><p>The Hunmo Elder's face was pale and bloodless, his face rapidly wrinkling at a visible rate. He looked even older than a centenarian, and his life force was barely perceptible.</p><p>Qin Sang sighed regretfully, pressing down on the Jinchen Sword.</p><p>He knew how difficult it was to deal with powerful cultivators.</p><p>Liuli wielded the Four-Headed Serpent Seal. Even with a surprise attack, it would likely be difficult to completely kill the Hunmo Elder.</p><p>He had prepared to use the Seven Souls Killing Formation after the Serpent Seal succeeded, seizing this rare opportunity to slay the demon!</p><p>Both treasures had been exposed.  The Hunmo Elder would be wary from now on, and there wouldn't be another chance this good.</p><p>To take the Hunmo Elder's head from amidst a thousand enemies – the thought was exhilarating.</p><p>It would also serve as a deterrent to the other demons.</p><p>From then on, who in the North Sea Three Realms would dare to act recklessly in his presence?</p><p>He hadn't expected that such an elaborate plan failed to kill the Hunmo Elder.  The demon's shapeshifting ability could even reverse the effects.</p><p>Fortunately, eliminating the ghost spirit and crippling the Hunmo Elder's arm wasn't a complete waste.</p><p>Judging from the Hunmo Elder's appearance, the ghost spirit was probably more than just his left and right hand.  After this heavy blow, at least within the Sacred Land, the Hunmo Elder would no longer pose a threat.</p><p>"Haha…"</p><p>Qin Sang laughed heartily.</p><p>His laughter reached the Hunmo Elder's ears, sounding like nothing but mockery, enraging him and nearly causing him to vomit blood.</p><p>The other demons, hearing the laughter, were shaken to their core, each inwardly questioning who the real demon was.</p><p>Amidst the laughter, Qin Sang's movements didn't pause. His gaze shifted to another formidable enemy, seeing a golden light rapidly approaching.</p><p>The Tianpeng Great Sage had only performed a simple refinement on the Mountain and River Pearl; the damage to the treasure didn't affect him much.</p><p>Qin Sang also understood that although spiritual treasures were powerful, two fists were no match for four hands.</p><p>The previous engagement was a flash, but the other demons were about to escape the fiery wave.  He absolutely couldn't be entangled by the Tianpeng Great Sage.</p><p>Therefore, Qin Sang made a decisive decision, using his remaining True Qi to control three divine birds to fly towards the Tianpeng Great Sage, before having his main body take control of the Sun God Tree.</p><p>By now, his external incarnation and Liuli were both on the verge of exhaustion.</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't worried about this.</p><p>Firstly, the Hunmo Elder was heavily injured, reducing the number of powerful enemies. As long as his main body could still control the Sun God Birds, those demons would hesitate to act.</p><p>Secondly, he had the Floating Pagoda, allowing him to enter the Exquisite Treasure Pagoda first, while the demons would have to break through the barrier first.</p><p>Thirdly, the appearance of the Exquisite Treasure Pagoda would surely alert Tong Lingyu and others.</p><p>‘Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!’</p><p>The divine birds, lifelike, spread their wings and flew towards him.</p><p>Facing these Sun God Birds, the Tianpeng Great Sage felt an inexplicable pressure, even a urge to prostrate himself.</p><p>Seeing the Hunmo Elder's miserable state, the Tianpeng Great Sage's pupils constricted. Without time to think, he let out a long cry, spewing a ball of golden light.</p><p>The unknown is always the most terrifying.</p><p>The Tianpeng Great Sage had interacted with Tong Lingyu and understood the Four-Headed Serpent Seal.</p><p>Although he didn't know why this treasure fell into the hands of an unknown girl, he knew one thing: Liuli, a mere early Nascent Soul cultivator, couldn't sustain prolonged consumption.</p><p>As for the Sun God Tree, the battle-hardened Tianpeng Great Sage could also discern some clues.</p><p>As long as he witnessed it firsthand, he would have a countermeasure!</p><p>The golden light was a small golden peng.</p><p>It differed from the golden peng that appeared at the entrance to the Sacred Land.  This golden peng, unlike the Tianpeng Great Sage himself, was remarkably similar to the legendary Golden-winged Roc, possessing a fraction of its divine aura!</p><p>The golden peng spread its wings and, with no less speed, collided with the Sun God Birds!</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The golden light was dazzling, gradually vanishing within the Nanming Lihuo.</p><p>Wave after wave of fire surged forward.</p><p>The Tianpeng Great Sage's gaze was calm.  His escape light abruptly changed direction, skillfully dodging the impact of the Sun God Birds, losing only a few feathers.</p><p>However, he missed his last chance to stop Qin Sang, only able to stare at them with a gloomy gaze from across the sea of fire.</p><p>Qin Sang retracted his incarnation, grabbed Liuli, and flew towards the Exquisite Treasure Pagoda.  Before leaving, he used the Sun God Tree to strike another shadow in a different direction, feigning a move to attack.</p><p>At the edge of the fire sea, Gui General's face showed surprise.</p><p>A black ray leaped from the ground, hurriedly fleeing – it was a puppet indistinguishable from a normal person.</p><p>The Gui General didn't know how his puppet was exposed, but he dared not take any risks. He watched helplessly as Qin Sang swaggered away.</p><p>No more obstacles ahead!</p><p>Qin Sang and Liuli's figures flashed, passing unharmed through layers of flames, arriving beneath the Exquisite Pagoda.  Upon touching the golden light wall, they passed through it effortlessly!</p><p>The demons finally recovered, roaring in anger, and launching a concentrated attack.</p><p>Unfortunately, most of these attacks were blocked by the flames. Even those that broke through the flames encountered the golden light wall, hitting it like a wall and being blocked.</p><p>Before the eyes of everyone, the two entered the Exquisite Treasure Pagoda without looking back!</p>
