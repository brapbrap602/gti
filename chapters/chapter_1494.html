<h1>Chapter 1485: Fellow Travelers</h1><p>The intricate patterns within the Frost Demon Crystal were complex yet clear, forming an enlarged snowflake without a single misplaced line, exuding an extraordinary beauty. As the ice case was opened, the first thing everyone felt was an astonishing chill. Those closest to the Grand Elder instinctively stepped back, creating a wide empty space around him. Even Nascent Soul cultivators reacted this way. The low-level disciples participating in the sacred land for the first time gazed at the sacred artifact with awe, hurriedly circulating their true essence to protect themselves, seeking some comfort.</p><p>A strange glint flashed in Qin Sang's eyes. The moment he saw the Frost Demon Crystal, he felt an inexplicable pressure, faint but undeniably real. The Frost Demon Crystal was clearly an inanimate object. Extracted from the body of a Frost Demon countless years ago, it still possessed such power. One could only imagine what level that Frost Demon had reached in life.</p><p>Tong Lingyu closed the ice case, and true essence surged from her palm, splitting into fine spiritual threads that wove into a marvelous pattern, slowly imprinting it onto the Frost Demon Crystal. This pattern matched the internal texture of the Frost Demon Crystal perfectly, as if they were one. At the same time, Tong Lingyu's lips moved slightly, though no sound came out. She was silently communicating with the Palace Master.</p><p>The cultivators held their breath, their gazes fixed on the Frost Demon Crystal and the Grand Elder. As Tong Lingyu worked, the Frost Demon Crystal gradually began to glow, its light emanating from within, flickering and unstable, indicating that the energy within the crystal was also becoming unstable. Tong Lingyu's movements grew faster and more dazzling. Eventually, the Frost Demon Crystal's form became indistinguishable to the naked eye, transforming into a shining star that slowly rose from Tong Lingyu's palm.</p><p>Qin Sang tilted his head, his gaze following the Frost Demon Crystal. He was somewhat surprisedâ€”the sacred land was not hidden beneath the sea.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>The tassels of the treasure carriage swayed, and a beam of blue light shot out, striking the Frost Demon Crystal squarely. With a *bang*, the Frost Demon Crystal's ascent halted abruptly, exploding in mid-air with an intense azure light, like a firework bursting into bloom! The overwhelming energy surged forth, and even the surrounding hurricane seemed to freeze in place.</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze suddenly shifted from the Frost Demon Crystal to the void above. At the moment of the crystal's explosion, a peculiar ripple spread through the void, one that had not been there before. At first, only Nascent Soul cultivators could sense it. Gradually, the disciples' attention was also drawn to it. The anomaly finally arrived, eliciting gasps of astonishment.</p><p>Centered around the Frost Demon Crystal, a visible black line extended from the void. Then, the void split along the black line, like a giant black maw, swallowing the Frost Demon Crystal whole!</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The hurricane suddenly intensified. Nascent Soul cultivators moved to protect their juniors, finding it somewhat strenuous. The terrifying hurricane winds, upon touching the rift, were directly swallowed, leaving no trace. The scene resembled a massive spatial rift. However, there were no spatial turbulences here. The interior of the rift was filled with thick, dark clouds, obscuring the sky and making it impossible to see what lay within.</p><p>The rift cut through the hurricane belt, and their current position was just a small section of it. The hurricane was everywhere, blocking their view and preventing them from seeing the end of the rift. The rift grew larger, while the light of the Frost Demon Crystal gradually dimmed, its power exhausted. The Grand Elder retrieved it and sealed it back in the ice case.</p><p>Now, they could see that above them, the clouds within the rift had thinned slightly, revealing faint glimpses of a majestic mountain shadow. This was the sacred land, and the rift was the passage leading into it. Seeing the sacred land, the crowd stirred, their faces filled with anticipation.</p><p>At that moment, the Vermilion Bird let out a cry and pulled the treasure carriage back, clearing the way. Qin Sang was startled and sent a voice transmission to Palace Master Jiang, "Is the Palace Master not entering the sacred land?"</p><p>Palace Master Jiang nodded and explained, "This was the case the previous two times as well. The Palace Master's cultivation is peerless, and there are no treasures within the sacred land that can attract him anymore."</p><p>As they spoke, the clouds within the rift shifted, and the central area grew thinner. Seizing the moment, Tong Lingyu led the group toward the rift. Qin Sang walked side by side with Liuli, having already awakened the Heavenly Eye Butterfly, hoping to peer through the clouds and observe the sacred land.</p><p>At that moment.</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly felt a disturbance within his dantian. The fragment of the Slaughter Sword stored there trembled for the first time. His expression froze momentarily but quickly returned to normal, unnoticed by anyone. Yet, his heart was filled with joy. The sword spirit, dormant and silent until now, had finally reacted, conveying a sense of longing.</p><p>The sacred land of the Profound Heaven Palace truly contained a fragment of the Slaughter Sword! Qin Sang suppressed his excitement and focused his mind on his dantian, only to find that the fragment had trembled once before falling silent again. The sword spirit's message was simple and urgent, lacking precise information but pointing in a general direction. Qin Sang could sense that the sword spirit had expended great effort just to convey this message, indicating how slow and difficult its recovery process was.</p><p>From here on, Qin Sang would have to explore on his own. He wondered if the sword spirit would recover enough to provide further guidance later. As his thoughts churned, Qin Sang drew closer to the rift. His expression remained calm as he silently activated the power of the Heavenly Eye, gazing deep into the clouds!</p><p>...</p><p>Just before the sacred land opened.</p><p>In an unknown stretch of sea, a Black Dragon Treasure Ship lay anchored. This was a massive ship, rare in the world, currently stationed at the edge of the hurricane belt. Compared to the overwhelming hurricane curtain, the ship appeared tiny and fragile. Yet, the ship carried an array of incredibly powerful auras, deliberately restrained. It was hard to imagine so many Nascent Soul-level experts gathered on a single ship.</p><p>*Crash...*</p><p>Huge waves rose and crashed against the Black Dragon Treasure Ship, yet the ship remained unmoving, as if waiting for something.</p><p>At the bow of the ship.</p><p>The Chaos Demon Elder stood with his hands behind his back, gazing deeply at the storm belt. His eldest disciple approached, standing behind him and bowing respectfully. "Master, there was almost another commotion inside."</p><p>"Still those demon kings?" the Chaos Demon Elder asked, his gaze still fixed on the storm belt, his expression calm.</p><p>The eldest disciple nodded, his voice filled with indignation. "The Great Sage Peng is clearly indulging them. Those demon kings are becoming more and more unruly!"</p><p>The Chaos Demon Elder chuckled. "The two races have always been like fire and water, with a sea of blood between them. It would be strange if they could coexist peacefully. The Great Sage Peng is only cooperating with me because of the Profound Heaven Palace's sacred land."</p><p>As he spoke, the Chaos Demon Elder took out a jade slip and handed it to his disciple. "This contains information I've gathered about the various treasure sites within the Profound Heaven Palace's sacred land. The time should be almost upon us. It's fine to inform Yuanyi Yuanjun and the others now. Advise them to be patient a little longer. Whether they can snatch treasures from under the Profound Heaven Palace's nose will depend on their own abilities."</p>
