<h1>Chapter 1975: Emergence</h1><p>The earth cracked, mountains crumbled.</p><p>Magma gushed forth endlessly, staining the sky before plummeting back to the earth, spent of its initial force.</p><p>Earthfire kissed the heavens, thick smoke billowed.</p><p>The desert transformed into a sea of flames.</p><p>The fissures continued to widen, as if the earth's depths harbored an inexhaustible supply of magma, finally finding a vent to unleash its fury.</p><p>Amidst this apocalyptic scene, accompanied by the destruction of ancient restrictions and the Secret Realm, lay a terrifying power capable of incinerating cultivators to ash, a power that would make even Nascent Soul cultivators tremble with fear.</p><p>Despite the Cloud Metropolis Nine Immortals gathering here, each possessing remarkable divine abilities, none dared to directly confront this onslaught and charge within.</p><p>‘Boom! Boom! Boom!’</p><p>The Cloud Metropolis Nine Immortals watched helplessly as the stone pillars before them were swept away by the magma, the Secret Realm’s appearance instantly distorted beyond recognition.</p><p>They had initially intended to suppress the eruption with the Cloud Soldier Profound Formation, concealing the extraordinary phenomenon, but now realized the absurdity of their plan.</p><p>The simultaneous destruction of the Secret Realm and the ancient restrictions of the Coiling Dragon Formation resulted in a power far greater than a simple addition. Their current priority was self-preservation!</p><p>“This is bad! Retreat!”</p><p>Yun Xi cried out in alarm.</p><p>In a single instant, the Cloud Soldier Profound Formation, formed by nine Nascent Soul cultivators wielding nine Profound Weapons, was shaken.</p><p>‘Boom, boom, boom!’</p><p>The Profound Weapons trembled violently, on the verge of being flung away. The Cloud Metropolis Nine Immortals exerted all their strength, but to no avail.</p><p>Fortunately, their cultivation levels were considerable, and their默契was profound. Reacting swiftly, they immediately recalled their Profound Weapons.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>Nine sharp rays of light flashed within the magma, cleaving through the molten rock and shooting back, circling the nine cultivators.</p><p>The nine Profound Weapons wobbled erratically, one fire-tipped spear even pointing towards its owner. The Cloud Soldier Profound Formation appeared distorted and struggled to function.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>In a flash, a tempest of raw power slammed into them.</p><p>The Cloud Soldier Profound Formation bore the brunt of the impact. The nine beams of Profound Weapon light were instantly swallowed by the flames, seemingly extinguished completely, and carried by the magma towards the ground.</p><p>Just as the magma reached the surface, one side was ripped open, revealing the figures of the Cloud Metropolis Nine Immortals.</p><p>Their breaths ragged, they remained unharmed thanks to the protection of the Cloud Soldier Profound Formation. Yet, their faces were etched with lingering fear. Without hesitation, they fled outwards.</p><p>They knew that within the depths of the Secret Realm, there might be precious treasures related to the Coiling Dragon Formation, but at this moment, none dared to venture in and retrieve them.</p><p>‘Ding-a-ling! Ding-a-ling!’</p><p>Having escaped danger, the Cloud Metropolis Nine Immortals relaxed, only to be startled by the ringing. They turned their astonished gazes towards the Dragon Ring Golden Bell at Yun Xi’s waist.</p><p>Generally, when ruins were unearthed, the closer they were to a crucial part of the Coiling Dragon Formation, the more intensely the Dragon Ring Golden Bell would react.</p><p>This ringing was more urgent than ever before!</p><p>“Hiss…”</p><p>Yun Xi gasped, about to speak, when a sudden premonition struck him. His eyes sharpened, sweeping towards one side.</p><p>At the spot where his gaze landed…</p><p>A faint wisp of grey Qi, hidden within the thick smoke, was barely discernible.</p><p>Within the grey Qi, a human figure flickered in and out of view, a Soulfall Abyss expert drawn to the commotion.</p><p>This person’s Dharma Name was Chi Bi, sharing the name of an ancient auspicious beast. His physique was extraordinarily imposing, even more powerful and robust than a bear.</p><p>His eyes were blood-red, his gaze fierce, like a bloodthirsty beast.</p><p>Upon seeing the Cloud Metropolis Nine Immortals emerge from the magma, Chi Bi immediately restrained his ferocity. While inherently aggressive, he was not reckless.</p><p>Yun Xi alone was no weaker than him, let alone with all of the Cloud Metropolis Nine Immortals present. Being surrounded would be perilous.</p><p>Chi Bi’s muscles suddenly tensed, his bones emitting a rumbling sound like thunder. With a backward leap, his form blurred, resembling a large bird as he moved with astonishing speed. This was an exceptionally advanced escape technique of the Soulfall Abyss, known as the Form-Obscuring Escape, requiring immense physical prowess to execute.</p><p>As he flew, several black threads shot out from Chi Bi’s waist.</p><p>Each black thread was a small black insect, shaped like an earthworm, with a long, sharp tail. They vibrated their gossamer wings, emitting a sound akin to cicada chirping.</p><p>These earthworms were a specially bred type of Corpse Gu, specifically used for transmitting messages. Ordinary sealing techniques could not block them.</p><p>‘Pop! Pop! Pop!’</p><p>The black threads exploded into puffs of blood mist as the Corpse Gu self-destructed.</p><p>The Cloud Metropolis Nine Immortals naturally witnessed this, their expressions changing as they realized the news had leaked. Soulfall Abyss experts would soon arrive.</p><p>This destruction was unpredictable in its duration.</p><p>They had to find a way to infiltrate the depths of the Secret Realm and retrieve the treasures before Chi Bi’s reinforcements arrived. Otherwise, a fierce battle was inevitable, and its outcome uncertain.</p><p>Chi Bi was even more anxious.</p><p>Alone and outnumbered, he was powerless to stop the Cloud Metropolis Nine Immortals.</p><p>But the reaction of the Flame Heart Jade indicated that whatever lay beneath the earth might be more significant than all the previously unearthed Secret Realms. He couldn't stand idly by and watch the Cloud Metropolis Nine Immortals succeed. Otherwise, his master wouldn't spare him.</p><p>Chi Bi had a premonition that the Nascent Soul war, which both sects had been deliberately avoiding, might be about to commence prematurely.</p><p>Just as his anxiety reached its peak, he sensed a familiar aura approaching, and his heart leaped with joy.</p><p>“Fei Luo, you’ve arrived.”</p><p>Soon, a streak of light drew near, revealing Fei Luo, who had also sensed the fluctuations and rushed over.</p><p>Fei Luo also held a Flame Heart Jade, radiating a dazzling light.</p><p>He nodded to Chi Bi, his gaze fixed on the earth's fissures, his expression grave.</p><p>Chi Bi shifted slightly, standing shoulder to shoulder with Fei Luo.</p><p>“I recall you once mentioned that the Flame Heart Jade had an unusual reaction in the past?”</p><p>Fei Luo hummed in agreement.</p><p>Two hundred years ago, shortly after he entered the Fire Domain, the Flame Heart Jade had suddenly shimmered. Though not as bright as now, it was still unusual.</p><p>Unfortunately, that reaction had lasted only briefly, and it remained the only such occurrence.</p><p>For years, he had travelled throughout the Fire Domain, seeking to uncover the cause of that shimmer, suspecting a more significant, undiscovered ruin.</p><p>Was this the source?</p><p>Fei Luo believed it highly likely.</p><p>Back then, a smaller eruption might have occurred here, leaking fluctuations that triggered the Flame Heart Jade.</p><p>Even from a distance, it caused the Flame Heart Jade to shimmer noticeably.</p><p>They were the first to discover it, but they failed to seize the opportunity, allowing the Cloud Metropolis Nine Immortals to gain the upper hand.</p><p>“What should we do now?” Chi Bi asked.</p><p>Fei Luo was the most familiar with the Coiling Dragon Formation ruins, and he might have a way to enter the earth’s depths and gain a head start.</p><p>However, accomplishing this under the watchful eyes of the Cloud Metropolis Nine Immortals would be incredibly difficult.</p><p>In the distance, the Cloud Metropolis Nine Immortals were staring at them, their eyes filled with vigilance, clearly wary of their presence.</p><p>Yun Xi assigned three individuals to closely monitor the Corpse Demons, while the others discussed how to retrieve the treasures.</p><p>Within the Fire Domain, powerful auras surged southward, a storm brewing. A tense atmosphere pervaded the Fire Domain.</p><p>A great battle was imminent.</p><p>However, neither the Cloud Metropolis Nine Immortals nor the Soulfall Abyss experts realized that the moment the Coiling Dragon Heavenly Pillar emerged, the situation had already spiraled beyond their control.</p><p>The emergence of the Coiling Dragon Heavenly Pillar, this time without any concealment, its unique fluctuations completely exposed to the world, triggered intense reactions in two artifacts, simultaneously alerting two Patriarchs.</p><p>…</p><p>Soulfall Abyss.</p><p>Jing Cang was alone in his cave dwelling, his figure shrouded in darkness, deducing the unfolding situation.</p><p>In his mind, the Mortal Realm and the Netherworld materialized.</p><p>Every nation, every faction, was represented here.</p><p>Patriarch Ming Hu had tasked him with manipulating the overall situation. Though his life wasn't at risk, it was incredibly mentally taxing.</p><p>The Cloud Metropolis Nine Immortals’ entry into the game hadn’t followed his intentions. Their unexpected moves, attempting to steer the situation in their favor, had caught Jing Cang somewhat off guard, but not entirely by surprise.</p><p>“Cloud Metropolis Nine Immortals…”</p><p>Jing Cang muttered the name, then furrowed his brow as he sensed the cave’s restrictions being triggered.  “Enter!”</p><p>A glimmer of light appeared at the entrance, and a figure entered, bowing respectfully. “Master, Martial Uncle Wu has sent another Yin Yuan Diamond.”</p><p>Jing Cang hummed in acknowledgement, extending his hand to receive a finger-sized black diamond.</p><p>The black diamond emitted a metallic sheen, a wisp of grey Qi flowing within, constantly forming grotesque human faces.  Countless souls were imprisoned within.</p><p>These souls were collected from the battlefields of the Mortal Realm.</p><p>The Mortal Realm was in chaos, engulfed in war.  Countless lives were lost.</p><p>Lost souls were abundant, readily available.  A sea of blood drowned the Mortal Realm, resentment filling the heavens, a scene that delighted the demonic cultivators.</p><p>This was also one of Jing Cang’s objectives.</p><p>Jing Cang waved his hand, dismissing the disciple, then swallowed the black diamond, preparing to refine it. Suddenly, his expression shifted, and he vanished, reappearing at the edge of the Black River.</p><p>“Master?”</p><p>Jing Cang was astonished by the changes in the Black River.</p><p>A whirlpool had formed on the surface, the water surging towards the banks. The river's center gradually parted, revealing an ancient stone staircase.</p><p>The staircase descended directly into the riverbed, its depths dark and cold, resembling a tomb passage.</p><p>‘Clack, clack, clack…’</p><p>The sound of a stone door shifting echoed from below, an eerie yet majestic aura emanating from the depths.</p><p>Faced with this aura, Jing Cang felt his mind tremble, fear blossoming in his heart and spreading throughout his body, overwhelming him.</p><p>It felt as though a peerless fiend was about to awaken—Patriarch Ming Hu, the founder of Soulfall Abyss!</p><p>Only a select few in Soulfall Abyss were qualified to approach the Black River, and Jing Cang was one of them.</p><p>Previously, with the Black River as a barrier, the pressure exuded by Patriarch Ming Hu hadn’t been so terrifying.</p><p>“Master’s cultivation has advanced again!”</p><p>Overwhelmed with awe and joy, Jing Cang dropped to his knees. “Disciple greets Master!”</p><p>He lowered his head, his peripheral vision catching sight of shadows spreading outwards from the depths of the staircase, a figure emerging from within.</p><p>Thud!</p><p>Thud!</p><p>Heavy footsteps echoed, each one resonating in his very core, amplifying the terrifying pressure.</p><p>Despite being a Corpse Cultivator, Jing Cang felt a sensation akin to drowning, his eyes filled with profound reverence.</p><p>The figure ascended the staircase step by step.</p><p>The enigmatic Patriarch Ming Hu gradually emerged from the shadows.</p><p>His height and build were similar to an ordinary person, his face that of an elderly man.</p><p>Wrinkles covered his face in astonishing numbers, which, combined with his deathly pale skin, made him appear ancient beyond measure.</p><p>Though seemingly decrepit, he exuded not a hint of senility.</p><p>However, an icy aura constantly emanated from him, like a corpse recently risen from the grave.</p><p>His eyes, beneath the wrinkles, were clouded and dull, his grey-white pupils devoid of luster.</p><p>Yet, gazing into those eyes, one sensed a chaotic vastness, as if they contained all things, devouring all vitality.</p><p>The longer one looked, the more terrifying those eyes became, instilling an involuntary, deep-seated fear, suppressing any thought of resistance.</p><p>Jing Cang knew his master’s power well.  He dared not look up, seeing only his master’s legs.</p><p>Those legs were incredibly peculiar. At first glance, they appeared clad in armor, but closer inspection revealed that the armor’s patterns were etched directly onto the skin, covering Ming Hu’s entire body.</p><p>It was unclear whether the armor had been refined into his flesh or if armor had grown from his body, the two fused seamlessly, indistinguishable from each other.</p><p>“Congratulations, Master, on perfecting your divine power!”</p><p>Jing Cang cried out from his kneeling position.</p><p>He couldn't discern whether his master had truly succeeded, but if he hadn't, why would he emerge from seclusion?</p><p>“Hehe…”</p><p>Ming Hu gazed eastward, emitting a chilling chuckle.</p><p>The laughter was eerie, but Jing Cang, familiar with his master, detected a hint of joy within, easing his tension. He ventured to ask, “What brings Master such joy?  Has something fortunate occurred?”</p><p>“The emergence of the Coiling Dragon Heavenly Pillar is indeed a joyous occasion!”</p><p>Ming Hu took a step through the air and instantly vanished.</p><p>His aura disappeared completely from Soulfall Abyss.</p><p>Astonishment filled Jing Cang’s face.</p><p>If he recalled correctly, this was the first time in a millennium that his master had left Soulfall Abyss.</p><p>His master's personal intervention meant that the situation they had painstakingly cultivated might have been rendered useless!</p><p>…</p><p>Cloud Metropolis Mountain.</p><p>Deep within the mountain range, towering peaks pierced the sky, shrouded in swirling clouds and mist, a scene of otherworldly beauty.</p><p>Beyond the clouds…</p><p>A breathtaking vista unfolded, worthy of being called a celestial paradise.</p><p>Compared to this place, Qin Sang's dwelling was a mere backwater.</p><p>Strange rocks and auspicious beasts, spiritual trees and wondrous flowers.</p><p>Amidst jade palaces and pavilions, cultivators bustled to and fro, each possessing extraordinary talent, far surpassing ordinary mortals.</p><p>This was the location of the Cloud Metropolis Nine Immortals’ sect, the dominant force of Cloud Metropolis Mountain.</p><p>Within the sect, immortal mountains rose one after another, like steps ascending to the heavens, culminating in the sect's sacred peak.</p><p>At the summit of the highest peak, the stars seemed within reach.  There stood a single, unassuming thatched hut.</p><p>A clear spring encircled the hut, and a clump of purple bamboo grew by its side.</p><p>These purple bamboo stalks, radiating a strange luster, were exceptionally slender yet remarkably resilient, a rare type of spiritual bamboo found in the world.</p><p>The main material of the Profound Weapons wielded by the Cloud Metropolis Nine Immortals came from this bamboo.</p><p>The mountain wind rustled through the bamboo leaves, creating a gentle susurrus.</p><p>Within the hut, a young man seemed to awaken at this sound, opening his eyes.</p><p>In that instant, a captivating, profound light flickered within his eyes before vanishing.</p><p>The young man’s appearance was remarkably youthful, a stark contrast to Ming Hu. His eyes, unlike Ming Hu's eerie gaze, were gentle, like those of a benevolent elder, yet this did not seem contradictory.</p><p>This person was Gu Yun Sou, the Supreme Patriarch of the Cloud Metropolis Nine Immortals.</p><p>A purple bamboo staff lay beside him, and he sat upon a cushion woven from bamboo leaves.  There were no other possessions.</p><p>He turned his gaze westward, his expression shifting slightly.  After a moment of contemplation, a streak of light flew from his body – his Dharma Body separating.</p><p>The Dharma Body’s appearance was identical to his true form, yet its aura was even more ethereal.</p><p>The purple bamboo staff rose of its own accord, landing in the Dharma Body’s hand.  With a flicker, the Dharma Body vanished, reappearing outside the sect.</p><p>The Cloud Metropolis Nine Immortals disciples remained completely unaware.  Only within a grand hall at the front of the mountain, the current sect leader of the Cloud Metropolis Nine Immortals, deep in meditative seclusion, was startled awake by a transmitted message.</p><p>Upon learning the news, his face was etched with shock, and he hastily emerged from seclusion.</p><p>Qin Sang likely hadn't anticipated that his move would have such a profound effect. The moment the Coiling Dragon Heavenly Pillar emerged, it immediately alerted two Void Refinement cultivators!</p>
