<h1>Chapter 1589:  A Parting Dream</h1><p>Qin Sang had made some preparations.</p><p>This included two three-transformation spirit insects: the Fiery Silkworms and the Crimson Wild Insects.</p><p>Fiery Silkworms live in magma, while Crimson Wild Insects are usually found on the edges of magma flows, hidden in grey crevices, feeding on the fire spirits within.</p><p>These two types of spirit insects are relatively common in the cultivation world, and their habits are similar, making it possible to catch them both at once if lucky.</p><p>However, the metamorphosis of spirit insects is a long and difficult process.</p><p>Qin Sang required two spirit insects at least in the mid-stage of three-transformations, which are even harder to find than mid-stage Golden Core cultivators.  She wouldn’t have the time to search for them herself, so she commissioned the Six States Hall to find them.</p><p>Because Qin Sang offered a high price, it is said that many late-stage Golden Core cultivators were attracted to the task.  Within a month, the two insects were delivered to Qin Sang.</p><p>For over ten years, Qin Sang had been feeding them Fire Melting Pills and other elixirs. The Fiery Silkworm reached the late stage of three-transformations, and the Crimson Wild Insect reached the peak of the mid-stage.</p><p>They would serve as materials for the transformation of the Jade Fire Centipede.</p><p>Before that, Qin Sang needed to help the Crimson Wild Insect advance.</p><p>Three-transformation spirit insects are exceptionally rare.  Using two late-stage three-transformation insects to help the Jade Fire Centipede transform seems incredibly extravagant.</p><p>However, the Jade Fire Centipede had already consumed numerous heavenly treasures and its cultivation had reached the peak of the late-stage three-transformations; it was only one step away from transformation, otherwise even more would be needed.</p><p>The art of raising insects is essentially about accumulating a large amount of resources to achieve a qualitative change, consuming other spirit insects in the process.</p><p>However, these two insects were not extraordinary; their potential was almost exhausted. Unless they encountered a unique opportunity, the possibility of transforming into a fourth transformation was extremely low.  In Qin Sang’s opinion, there was nothing to regret.</p><p>In addition to this, Qin Sang had also prepared most of the elixirs from the *Gu Jing* (Classic of Gu).</p><p>She either acquired them herself or through various trading houses, gathering the spiritual herbs and then commissioning alchemists to refine them.</p><p>Only one elixir, called  Parting Dream Powder, had two main ingredients that were hard to find. After investigation, she learned that the ingredients originated from the Southern State and were monopolized by the Myriad Poison Mountain.</p><p>Yet, Parting Dream Powder was essential. It could neutralize the aggressive nature of Gu insects to some degree, and Qin Sang estimated that she would need at least three doses for the Jade Fire Centipede.</p><p>She had no choice but to purchase it from the Myriad Poison Mountain.</p><p>Parting Dream Powder is not only useful in raising Gu, but cultivators also use it to lure and soothe insects when subduing them, increasing the success rate.</p><p>Myriad Poison Mountain occasionally releases a batch, but the price is extremely high.</p><p>After confirming that the secret technique was usable, Qin Sang decided to buy it.</p><p>Seven Fragrance Pavilion.</p><p>Though not as large as the Six States Hall, it is one of the major trading houses in the Central State, with far-reaching connections.  Its branches can be found even in the large markets of the Northern Wastelands.  It is rumored to have close ties with the Myriad Poison Mountain.</p><p>For Nascent Soul cultivators, these are not secrets. Anyone who cares to investigate can find out.</p><p>The  Yi District of the Immortal City is a place where trading houses gather, and there was a Seven Fragrance Pavilion there.</p><p>Yi District was bustling with people.</p><p>The entrances of the various trading houses were even more crowded, with cultivators constantly coming and going.</p><p>Seven Fragrance Pavilion was a seven-story jade tower, built from a kind of dark green gemstone; a faint green light shimmered.</p><p>Various mounts were tied to jade posts in front of the building: dragons, phoenixes, qilins—a dazzling array, all thoroughly tamed, lazily lying down and dozing.</p><p>Qin Sang disguised herself, walked across a jade bridge to the jade pavilion, and entered.</p><p>Inside the Seven Fragrance Pavilion was another world; treasures filled the shelves, mostly alchemical poisons.  Dozens of servants and maids stood at the entrance, all cultivators with cultivation levels in the Qi Refinement stage.</p><p>“Welcome, honored guest!”</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang enter, a maid immediately greeted her with a smile, swaying her waist gracefully.  Just as she was about to approach, a deep voice suddenly rang out in her ear.</p><p>“Please escort this senior upstairs.”</p><p>The maid was startled and her smiling face stiffened slightly; luckily, this was not her first experience with such a thing, so she didn’t lose composure, bowing slightly, “This senior is invited.”</p><p>Qin Sang, without changing her expression, followed the maid to the second floor, where she saw a man in white hurrying down, saying to the maid, “You can go down.”</p><p>Then he bowed to Qin Sang,  “Senior, your presence honors us.  I apologize for my inadequate welcome. The items on the lower floors are probably not to your liking; may I escort you to a private room for a discussion?”</p><p>Qin Sang agreed, and followed the man to the fifth floor, where someone had already served spiritual tea and immortal fruits.</p><p>Two individuals sat opposite each other.  The man in white was about to make polite conversation, but Qin Sang, wanting to save time, interrupted him.  After a brief appraisal, she got straight to the point: “I wish to purchase an item from your esteemed establishment.  Are you authorized to handle such matters?”</p><p>The man in white chuckled, “I am the steward of the Seven Fragrant Pavilion. I can handle most matters within the Pavilion. If your request exceeds my authority, I shall immediately report to the elders and ensure you receive a satisfactory response.”</p><p>Major trading houses have branches throughout the Central Plains, but not every location has a Yuan Ying cultivator stationed there.  For example, the Six States Hall in Yan Shui Xu was originally managed by a Golden Core cultivator.  Only after the closure of Mount Bu Nian and unrest in Zhuozhou did the Six States Hall dispatch Jiang Mu to oversee the branch.  Once the situation in Zhuozhou stabilized, Jiang Mu was recalled.  Only the Immortal City in Fei Yun Du, due to its crucial location, always has a Yuan Ying cultivator stationed there.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded and said calmly, “I wish to buy Li Meng San.”</p><p>The man in white’s smile faltered.  He stopped his pleasantries and immediately rose, saying, “Please wait a moment, esteemed guest.”</p><p>Shortly after the man in white left, a knock came at the door.</p><p>“Enter.”</p><p>Qin Sang looked towards the door.  An elderly man with snow-white hair but a youthful face entered, a look of surprise crossing his eyes.</p><p>He was clearly a mid-Yuan Ying cultivator.  Could he be the Pavilion Master of the Seven Fragrant Pavilion?</p><p>The elder was also assessing Qin Sang, but he couldn't discern her cultivation level, causing him to inwardly grow wary. He chuckled heartily, “I was in seclusion, my apologies for the delay, friend.”</p><p>“It is I who intrude,”</p><p>Qin Sang rose and returned the courtesy.</p><p>After some polite conversation, the elder attempted to probe Qin Sang's background, but she deftly deflected his inquiries.  Seeing this, the elder ceased his attempts.  After a moment’s contemplation, he said, “Friend, you seek to purchase Li Meng San. You should know that this medicine is controlled by Wan Du Mountain.  Only small quantities are released periodically, making it exceedingly rare and valuable.”</p><p>Qin Sang let out a short, amused laugh.</p><p>The elder remained impassive, changing his tone, “Our Pavilion does indeed have a small stock, but such a prized treasure is in short supply. How much do you require? Will you exchange goods, or pay in spirit stones?”</p><p>“At least three portions!”</p><p>Qin Sang held up three fingers,  “The method of exchange will depend on the quality of the Li Meng San.”</p><p>Li Meng San is graded into superior, medium, and inferior qualities.  The superior and medium grades are effective, though their potency differs; the inferior grade is essentially useless against the Fire Jade Centipede.</p><p>Hearing this, the elder understood Qin Sang was well-prepared and abandoned other considerations. He produced three porcelain bottles from his storage pouch and placed them on the table.</p><p>Qin Sang opened the bottles and examined their contents.</p><p>The bottles contained white powder—Li Meng San. One bottle had slightly yellowish powder, indicating a medium grade, while the other two were superior grade.</p><p>These three bottles of Li Meng San would suffice.</p><p>Watching Qin Sang’s actions, the elder suddenly smiled, “Congratulations, friend!”</p><p>“Congratulations? On what?”</p><p>Qin Sang looked up at him.</p><p>“Acquiring three bottles of Li Meng San at once suggests you've encountered a four-stage spirit insect, wouldn't you say? Isn't that cause for celebration?” the elder said, not concealing his envy.</p><p>Other insect-controlling techniques, unlike the *Gu Jing*, lack such severe drawbacks and less stringent requirements.  The elder was unaware that Qin Sang possessed half of the *Gu Jing*, misunderstanding her purpose.</p><p>In the cultivation world, three-stage spirit insects are still relatively easy to find, but naturally mutated four-stage insects are exceptionally rare.  Even Wan Du Mountain, which dominates the Barbarian State, rarely encounters such insects, whose potential is extremely high.  Encountering one doesn't guarantee capture, and capture doesn't guarantee subjugation.  The elder naturally envied Qin Sang's good fortune.</p><p>After examining the bottles, Qin Sang set them down and remarked casually, “Spirit insect abilities are usually quite singular. Even a four-stage insect is often useless. I've expended great effort over many years, and there's still no guarantee it will help me.  If only it were like the insect of a fellow cultivator I once met—a single poisonous light easily killed a cultivator of the same realm. It was the most terrifying insect I've ever witnessed!”</p><p>“Killed a Yuan Ying with poison?”</p><p>The elder’s face changed, his tone urgent, “What kind of poisonous light? What did the insect look like?”</p><p>Qin Sang narrowed her eyes, remaining calm and composed as she pretended to recall, “The poisonous light was fleeting, milky white.  As for the insect… it seemed to be a jade-like beetle.  Hehe… I've always suspected it belonged to some expert from Wan Du Mountain.  Do you recognize it?”</p><p>“Jade beetle… jade beetle…”</p><p>The elder muttered to himself, then suddenly remembered something, and hastily asked, “Who controlled the jade beetle? Where did you encounter him?”</p><p>There's definitely something amiss!</p><p>Upon seeing the *Gu Jing*, Qin Sang had been pondering the relationship between the strange-faced master and disciple and Wan Du Mountain, but there was no such figure publicly known within Wan Du Mountain.  She suspected the *Gu Jing* came from dubious origins and decided to probe.  Unbeknownst to her, a much bigger secret seemed to lie hidden beneath the surface.</p><p>Qin Sang remained silent, smiling at the elder, her gaze sweeping across the porcelain bottles on the table.</p><p>An old man paused, then nodded, gritting his teeth.  "If you, friend, can provide useful information, these Dream-Scattering Pills are yours."</p><p>Qin Sang finally relented, saying thoughtfully, "This person's methods are ruthless. He instantly killed a Yuan Ying cultivator. I only dared to observe from afar; I wouldn't dare approach. I vaguely saw that he had a scarred face, very unusual. As for his origins, friend, you can look at the border between the two southern barbarian states…"</p><p>He channeled spiritual energy, sketching a rough map of the two southern barbarian states in the air, highlighting a large area.</p><p>The old man hesitated. Qin Sang wasn't sure about their history, so he cleverly linked the two encounters with the scarred-faced man, guiding them to his hideout.  However, Qin Sang suspected the scarred-faced man was unlikely to be in the Poisonous Swamp anymore.</p><p>The old man took it to heart, and solemnly stated, "Friend, you should have guessed it.  My other identity is an elder of the Ten Thousand Poisons Mountain.  The man you speak of has long been our enemy. Two of our Yuan Ying elders were killed by him.  If you encounter him in the future, please inform us immediately. We will handsomely reward you!"</p><p>"Your feud is none of my concern. This person's spirit insects are too vicious. I value my life and don't want to encounter him again or provoke such a powerful enemy."</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head repeatedly, put away the porcelain bottle, and prepared to leave.</p><p>The old man quickly called out to Qin Sang, "Please wait a moment, friend."</p><p>He rushed out and back, returning with a jade box.</p><p>The box opened, revealing layers of enchantments covering a thread as thin as a hair.</p><p>Upon closer inspection, it was a gray fluff, seemingly from some creature.</p><p>Qin Sang stared for a long time, unable to discern its nature, and looked questioning.</p><p>The old man pushed the jade box toward Qin Sang. "This person, in his arrogance, was struck by one of our sect's most precious treasures, poisoning his insides. If he weren't so strong, he would have died long ago. The scars on his face are caused by the poison. This contains a portion of the treasure's power.  If you encounter him again, activate this to trigger the remaining poison in his body. He will be too preoccupied to attack you, allowing you to escape! Of course, if you can kill him and capture the Jade-armored insect, and return it to the Ten Thousand Poisons Mountain, we'll offer a great treasure in exchange!"</p><p>Qin Sang thought, "So that's it."</p><p>No wonder such a powerful cultivator couldn't restore his appearance.  A sect's treasure could leave such a powerful cultivator so damaged! The resources of a major sect are truly unfathomable!</p><p>Qin Sang became more alert, frowning, "I encountered him decades ago. He was a late Yuan Ying cultivator.  After so long, will this still work?"</p><p>"The scars on his face remain, proving the poison isn't gone. It will definitely work! If it were easily resolved, would it be considered a precious treasure by our sect?"</p><p>The old man was confident.  "The poison lies dormant within him. Unless triggered, it won't cause much harm. He is focusing on cultivating the Jade-armored insect, which will consume most of his energy, leaving him no time to deal with the poison before the insect matures."</p><p>Qin Sang claimed he only observed from afar.</p><p>But the old man knew better.  A battle between powerful cultivators isn't something anyone can casually watch. Besides, the scarred-faced man had provoked the Ten Thousand Poisons Mountain, a formidable enemy.  If there was any risk of his whereabouts being revealed, he would surely have killed Qin Sang.</p><p>They may have already fought a fierce battle.</p><p>Qin Sang being alive and well showed that he was quite powerful.</p><p>Creating such a fluff would weaken the treasure's power, but it would recover after some time, so giving one away was inconsequential. The old man saw Qin Sang's apprehension and chose not to press him, but he wasn't against gaining an ally.</p><p>He wasn't worried about Qin Sang stealing the Jade-armored insect.  Regardless of whether Qin Sang could kill the man, besides the Ten Thousand Poisons Mountain and the scarred-faced man himself who raised it, no one else could tame the Jade-armored insect; Qin Sang could only seal it.  A sealed insect might eventually escape and attack.</p><p>The best option was to trade with the Ten Thousand Poisons Mountain.</p><p>"Then I gratefully accept!"</p><p>Qin Sang took the jade box, bowed slightly, and left.</p><p>The old man personally escorted Qin Sang out of the Seven Fragrant Pavilion, then returned to his chamber and closed his eyes to rest.</p><p>Shortly after,</p><p>A dark shadow appeared in the chamber.</p><p>"Lost him?"</p><p>The old man asked calmly, not seeming surprised.</p><p>The shadow hummed, "This person's spiritual awareness is sharp.  I followed for less than a hundred meters before feeling I was detected."</p><p>"Excellent! The higher the cultivation, the better!  That fellow actually cultivated the Gu King.  We can't keep this quiet; otherwise, the sect alone will suffer heavy losses...I'll personally report to the sect leader."</p><p>The old man said.</p>
