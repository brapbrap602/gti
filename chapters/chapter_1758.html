<h1>Chapter 1749: Establishing the Prison</h1><p>Qin Sang, at some point, rose to his feet and gazed at the altar beneath the nun, his eyes filled with wonder.</p><p>The altar seemed to possess the power to stabilize the vital energy.  The nun clearly possessed mid-Golden Core cultivation; there was no sign of chaotic true essence in her body!</p><p>With his keen eyes, he could see that the key likely lay in the altar beneath the nun and the slowly rotating "Proclaiming to All Spirits Seal" within it.</p><p>The Proclaiming to All Spirits Seal was small, yet even amidst a battlefield teeming with demonic soldiers, no one could ignore this spiritual seal.</p><p>It was clear that this wasn't a physical seal. Most of its body, including the handle, was indistinct, its shape vaguely discernible yet radiating a brilliant light.  Cloud script, thunder patterns, phoenix and dragon characters seemed to be etched on it, though the divine object itself remained hidden from view.</p><p>Only the four large characters "Proclaiming to All Spirits" at the base were exceptionally clear, surrounded by intricate and mysterious符文图案 (fuwen tu'an).</p><p>The nun was bathed in golden light, as if clad in golden armor.  A strange aura emanated from her, an immense majesty that made it difficult to look directly at her.</p><p>Furthermore, the altar's function went beyond this!</p><p>A thick fog now shrouded the river.  Ordinary people couldn't see the confrontation in the air, their hearts filled with fear. Knowing that mortal life was forfeit when immortals clashed, they abandoned their homes and fled in panic, soon leaving Bailongdu nearly deserted.</p><p>Qin Sang went with the flow, heading out of Bailongdu with an elderly couple, but his Sky-Eyed Butterfly kept its gaze fixed on the battlefield.</p><p>He saw clearly that the two squads of water serpent soldiers emerged from the altar after the nun's incantation.</p><p>Like the three squads of wolf soldiers hidden in the reeds, Qin Sang had only noticed the nun alone on the lone peak before; he had not sensed the presence of the water serpent soldiers.</p><p>Before the wolf soldiers appeared, a similar altar had also flashed past in the black smoke.</p><p>Thus, the altar also possessed the ability to raise and store soldiers.</p><p>This method reminded Qin Sang of the schools in the Storm World that specialized in beast control, such as the Spirit Control Sect of Bei Chen. Yet, it was also vastly different.</p><p>Cultivators of the Spirit Control Sect would choose a compatible demonic beast upon entering the Dao, forming a sworn pact.  The two would then become as one, the beast known as the cultivator's innate spirit beast.</p><p>Besides their innate spirit beast, they might also raise several beasts with unique abilities to use as mounts, but the number would be limited. Most couldn't afford to raise many demonic soldiers, lest their own cultivation be hampered.</p><p>The cultivation of spirit beasts didn't come from nothing.  Qin Sang himself raised several four-transformation spirit insects, and gathering the materials needed for their cultivation was quite energy-consuming, only improving after receiving the *Panhu Sutra*.</p><p>These two squads of water serpent soldiers, however, were not only orderly and well-disciplined, but their cultivation was also not weak.</p><p>In particular, the leaders of the two squads were only slightly weaker than the nun, both being pre-Demon Core serpent demons.</p><p>Under each leader were several spirit-level water serpents, and hundreds of ordinary demonic-level serpent soldiers.</p><p>The two squads were tightly arrayed, with the two serpent demon generals leading the way and the nun as the central figure.  Their momentum was unified, forming a singular entity, subtly creating a strange formation that held immense power, far surpassing an ordinary military array.</p><p>Currently, only two gates were open. What would it be like with all eight open?  What if the person at the altar were at the Yuan Ying, Transformation God levels, or even higher?</p><p>In this world, wouldn't one cultivator be equivalent to a thousand-strong army!</p><p>Qin Sang felt a chill run down his spine.</p><p>Of course, he understood that summoning and training demonic soldiers, ensuring unwavering loyalty and absolute obedience, was far from as simple as it looked.</p><p>Finally witnessing the cultivators of this world and seeing a method to resolve the chaotic vital energy, Qin Sang's heart eased slightly, his curiosity about the cultivators of this realm further piqued.  Storm World cultivators focused on self-cultivation; he had rarely seen such a sight.</p><p>However, if he were to train an army, he was quite reluctant.  Did the cultivators of this world spend so much effort on military matters without worrying about hindering their cultivation? Or was there some other benefit?</p><p>As Qin Sang pondered this, changes occurred on the river again.</p><p>After her rebuke, the nun showed no intention of waiting for the wolf demons' reply.  The wolf demons dared to openly injure the river god under her jurisdiction – a crime punishable by death!</p><p>Moreover, this squad of wolf soldiers was clearly a band of stray soldiers.</p><p>Stray soldiers were originally under the command of Taoist priests.  Due to unforeseen circumstances, such as the death of the priest without a successor, or the soldiers rebelling against their master, the priest might be unable to subdue them, resulting in the destruction of the altar and the soldiers fleeing, losing their constraints and becoming stray soldiers.</p><p>Benign stray soldiers are not overly dangerous.  Wolf soldiers, however, who are bloodthirsty and dare to attack the Water Palace City God, are likely rebellious soldiers who destroyed the altar.</p><p>Any Daoist disciple has the duty to slay demons and capture the altar!</p><p>The nun made hand seals, stepped in the Yu Bu, and moved with such speed that her body formed a whirlwind.</p><p>At a command, the leaders of the two squads of water serpent soldiers vigorously shook the flags in their hands.  Streams of watery light erupted, flowing into the soldiers' bodies.  The water serpent soldiers roared in unison, their cries shaking the mountains.</p><p>The watery light coalesced, resembling a celestial river winding above the river's surface, enveloping all the water serpent soldiers.  Basking in the sunlight, they seemed to shimmer with a faint golden light, their demonic aura palpable.</p><p>One water serpent general raised his flag, pointing it towards the sky; the other pointed it at Bai Longjun, who struggled in the river.</p><p>The water serpent formation shifted. The celestial river suddenly rolled upwards, plunging the world into momentary darkness.  The sun vanished, replaced by a幽蓝 (dark blue) water sword suspended above the river.  Its soft blue light illuminated the mountains and valleys.  The sword tip trembled, pointing directly at the giant wolf.</p><p>Simultaneously, the river surged, a wave of cold air erupting from beneath Bai Longjun, instantly freezing him into an ice pillar.  This was a protective measure, preventing the wolf demon from resorting to desperate measures. The female cultivator, though far more powerful than the wolf demon, acted with extreme caution.</p><p>The wolf demon was unable to intervene, watching helplessly as its prey was frozen and sank to the riverbed.  At the same time, the幽蓝 (dark blue) sword descended swiftly, like a flash of lightning.</p><p>From a distance, Qin Sang's expression shifted slightly.  The power of this strike was comparable to that of a late-stage Golden Core cultivator!</p><p>Unexpectedly, the wolf demon showed no fear, allowing Bai Longjun to be rescued.  It looked up, laughing coldly.</p><p>"Sect Leader?  So you're a Chief Justice of the Heavenly Pivot Academy. We've snagged a big fish. My apologies! My apologies!"</p><p>The wolf demon howled, its four paws stamping heavily.  A magic altar suddenly appeared beneath it. The demon had clearly been concealing it until now, revealing it only upon the arrival of its true target.</p><p>This altar was similar in design to the female cultivator's, also three-tiered, with four pillars and eight gates.  However, it held a damaged spirit banner. The altar’s pillars were leaning, appearing far more dilapidated than the female cultivator's. Yet, the spirit banner within this altar was more substantial than the female cultivator’s Proclamation of Ten Thousand Spirits Seal.</p><p>The altar opened two gates, billowing black smoke that spewed forth two squads of black wolf soldiers: three demon core-stage giant wolves, dozens of black-furred wolf demons, and over a hundred miscellaneous demons including foxes, jackals, tigers, and leopards.</p><p>Seeing the altar beneath the black wolves, a look of surprise flashed across the female cultivator's eyes.  "The Crimson Cloud Banner, the Ascension Profound Position?"</p><p>She was only at the mid-stage of the Cave God position, needing to achieve great cultivation to reach the Ascension Profound Position.  Within the Heavenly Pivot Academy, the Ascension Profound Position held the rank of Sect Leader, a fifth-rank official with the title of Supreme Pure Xuan-Du Physician. This demon was actually a soldier under a True Person!</p><p>The wolf soldiers regrouped.  One of the three wolf generals was a mid-stage Demon Core cultivator, leading the elite troops, while the other two, early-stage Demon Core cultivators, managed the rearguard. The three worked in perfect coordination. At the giant wolf's command, they howled, spewing black smoke.  The demons shifted formation, disappearing into the smoke, their movements shadowy and unpredictable.</p><p>The black smoke coalesced, transforming into a majestic heavenly wolf, tens of meters tall.  It opened its maw and swallowed the water sword whole.</p><p>A faint blue light flickered within the heavenly wolf's belly, then faded.  The heavenly wolf sneered, licking its fangs as if savoring a delicious meal, shook its head, and charged towards the water serpent soldiers.</p><p>The giant wolf remained unscathed, laughing at the female cultivator.  It seemed to have shed some constraint, its aura surging until it matched the female cultivator's, showing no signs of stopping.</p><p>The female cultivator's expression changed. Though she had anticipated the giant wolf's true nature was not so simple, she hadn't expected it to be a rogue cultivator who had seized a True Person's altar.  However, she did not lose her composure.</p><p>The strongest generals under a True Person's command were those who had served for many years and were highly unlikely to betray them.  The damaged altar and the tattered Crimson Cloud Banner suggested the True Person had been gravely injured by a powerful enemy, allowing the giant wolf to seize the opportunity.  In such circumstances, the True Person's personal troops would most likely have perished, meaning the wolf's cultivation might not be particularly high.</p><p>As the Chief Justice of the Heavenly Pivot Academy, overseeing the branch altar, all the divine powers within this area were under her control.</p><p>Remaining calm, the female cultivator abruptly shifted her stance, her body as graceful as a willow, performing step-by-step incantations, and with a pointed finger, she drew a talismans in mid-air.  It instantly transformed into a streak of light, shooting into the altar's seal.</p><p>The seal blazed with golden light. The female cultivator's cold incantations echoed between heaven and earth.</p><p>Following the divine mandate from the Celestial Heavens, the Imperial Guards are summoned.</p><p>All deities of the land, obey the command.</p><p>The Celestial Talisman, unified, its power complete.</p><p>Wherever the command reaches, all gods shall follow!</p><p>Quickly, quickly!</p><p>The incantation, like a divine sound, spread invisibly in all directions.  Upon its utterance, all city gods, land deities, mountain gods, and water gods within the jurisdiction of the Nun's sect were summoned and compelled to immediately send aid, or face divine retribution.</p><p>The first to respond were the White Dragon Lord's troops.  The White Dragon Lord was still engaged, but his troops, unable to disobey the summons, retreated from their current battle with the white wolf soldiers and hastily rose on the water, joining forces with the water snake soldiers.</p><p>The city god, arriving from downstream, also received the summons and quickly urged his troops to accelerate their approach. In the distance, a divine light pierced the sky.</p><p>Meanwhile, the mountains, rivers, and seas outside Floating Dragon City, even the Nine Dragon capital and surrounding countries under the Nun's sect's control, all felt the summons. However, those farther away might not be able to arrive in time. Only some nearby mountains and cities raised their banners, riding on divine light, heading toward the battle.</p><p>At the same time the Nun issued the summons, two water snake generals waved their banners. The sky suddenly brightened, and a vast curtain of water vapor pressed down, momentarily hindering the dire wolf. Then, leading their troops, they soared into the air, forming an array around the altar.</p><p>The water snake generals continuously waved their banners, and the water snake soldiers, obeying orders, instantly raised columns of water, transforming them into transparent tokens that floated above the altar.  The tokens vibrated slightly, and the Celestial River reappeared, this time remaining hidden but circling the troops like a continuous celestial serpent. With the tokens' empowerment, its power was far greater than before.</p><p>Knowing this was a giant wolf's trap, and she was the target, the Nun immediately adopted a defensive posture. The Celestial River enveloped the troops and the altar, suddenly rushing downstream to join forces with the city god.  Though her strength was slightly inferior to the wolf soldiers, she was not afraid.  As long as she held out until the temple troops arrived to surround them, they would be trapped and unable to escape.</p><p>Just as this thought crossed her mind, the Nun's expression changed drastically. The giant wolf's cultivation had been rapidly increasing, now reaching the peak of the Demon Core stage, and still showing no signs of stopping.</p><p>*Crack… crack…*</p><p>The giant wolf twisted its head, its bones cracking, and its aura suddenly surged, instantly entering the Transformation stage.</p><p>"Aooo!"</p><p>A terrifying howl shook the heavens, frightening both gods and ghosts.</p><p>The giant wolf transformed into a black light, dashing into the black smoke, "My minions, seize that tender morsel, cook it for wine, and let the kingdom feast on its blood!"</p><p>"Aooo! Aooo! Aooo!"</p><p>Excited howls erupted from the black smoke.</p><p>With the giant wolf personally leading the main formation, the wolf soldiers' morale skyrocketed, and the black smoke continuously gathered into the dire wolf's body.  In the blink of an eye, the dire wolf grew to a hundred zhang (a Chinese unit of length), its body like a mountain, imposing and majestic, its breath creating wind and thunder, and its exhalation shaking the mountains.</p><p>Downriver, banners were like a forest, the divine troops from Floating Dragon City's city god temple.</p><p>The city god was not a demon, but a man of about thirty years old, fair-skinned with a short beard, wearing a black gauze winged hat and a blue robe.  His brows were sharp, and he possessed a commanding presence.</p><p>Summoned to aid, upon seeing the towering dire wolf in the distance, he was greatly shocked and dismayed. Although he was the city god, his cultivation was only slightly stronger than the White Dragon Lord's.  Facing a transformed-stage demon with countless troops, how could he not be afraid? If the Nine Dragon gods could arrive in time, they might be able to deal with the demon.  But he, a single city god, even with the orders of that Tian Shu Academy Grand Minister, would likely be no match for the demon.</p><p>This thought led the city god to waver.</p><p>"Better to preserve myself than to die. I can report to my superiors and atone for my failure…"</p><p>But the summons could not be ignored.</p><p>With a change of heart, the city god ascended his divine vehicle, pointed forward, and ordered his troops not to delay, to quickly rush to the aid.  Seated on his vehicle, his expression became rigid, and a gust of cold wind silently entered the forest.</p><p>Unaware, the troops dared not disobey, and fearfully flew towards the battlefield.</p><p>At that moment, the dire wolf easily caught up with the Nun, opened its massive maw, and sucked in a mouthful of the Celestial River. The vast river water, like a silk ribbon, was sucked into its mouth, revealing the riverbed below – a river severed in a single breath!</p><p>The protective Celestial River also became turbulent, with waves rising and the tokens trembling. The Nun's face paled slightly, and she quickly cast spells, her troops changing formations. Beams of light shot towards the tokens, stabilizing the Celestial River.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the dire wolf leaped, bringing a gust of evil wind, and pounced.</p><p>"Isn't that person going to make a move?"</p><p>Qin Sang, observing the battlefield from a distance, glanced at the solitary peak where the Nun had previously hidden. From his ship, he had noticed two people hidden on the peak; one with a concealed aura, similar to a Yuan Ying cultivator.  If this person was the Nun's master, the time was ripe for intervention.</p><p>As expected, shifting his gaze, he saw a faint light rise from the mountain, and a powerful voice echoed throughout the world.</p><p>"Water and fire combine, the Heavenly Prison's power.</p><p>Subdue demons, capture ghosts, reveal evil.</p><p>Quickly!"</p><p>On both banks of the river and atop the peaks, four celestial pillars, hundreds of zhang high, rose from nothing, sealing the Nun and the wolf soldiers within. Inside the pillars, one half was red-hot with raging flames, the other stark white with chilling frost.  The sound of clanking chains echoed incessantly, like a heavenly prison!</p><p>(To be continued)</p>
