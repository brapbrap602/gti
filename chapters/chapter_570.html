Chapter 563: A Startling Discovery

After all the star essence stones were drawn together by the incantation, forming a radiant astral array in the air,  Old Ancestor Redhair chuckled at True One Daoist,  "Old geezer, time to bring out the array materials."

True One Daoist, his face impassive, waved his hand, throwing out a pouch. The pouch opened in mid-air, releasing a torrent of various spiritual materials.

This display left Qin Sang and the others speechless. Each material was a rare treasure in the cultivation world.  Qin Sang hadn't even heard of at least half of them.

The Little North Star Astral Array seemed like a gold-devouring beast, requiring so many precious materials!

After the materials appeared, True One Daoist and the other three continued to maintain the array's nascent form.  It was time for the other Nascent Soul cultivators to act.

Powerful streams of True Energy lifted and refined the materials. The Little North Star Astral Array underwent dazzling transformations. Qin Sang watched intently, hoping to learn something, but soon felt dizzy and exhausted, forcing him to give up. He decided to commit the scene to memory for later study.

With so many Nascent Soul cultivators working together, the array formation progressed rapidly.  A quarter of an hour later, the final material was embedded, and the nascent array vanished, replaced by an area of absolute darkness, like a black hole formed within a vortex of wind and clouds.

Suddenly, a point of starlight ignited within the black hole.  One star after another lit up in quick succession.  In the blink of an eye, the small black hole was filled with countless shining stars, a miniature cosmos, dazzling in its brilliance.

It was just like the night sky—stars appearing and disappearing, rivers of stars flowing, meteors streaking across the expanse—all astonishingly real.

At the center of this stellar display was an exceptionally bright star, with the others seeming to orbit it. This was the array's eye, the North Star!  And it grew ever brighter.

*Boom!*

A sudden change. A dazzling pillar of light descended from the heavens, easily piercing the wind and cloud vortex, striking the North Star within the array. The light column contained an incredibly peculiar energy, originating from the same source as the star essence stones.  The Little North Star Astral Array was actually capable of drawing upon the power of the celestial stars!

Qin Sang was unfamiliar with this kind of power, though he'd heard of cultivation techniques that harnessed celestial energy. However, no one dared to let such immense stellar power enter their body. Even Nascent Soul cultivators would be instantly annihilated!

Fueled by the celestial energy, not only the North Star, but the entire Little North Star Astral Array began to shift.

At that moment, the nearby four-colored cloud dissipated. Palaces, warships, and other treasures were retrieved by their owners. Everyone was suddenly exposed beneath the wind and cloud vortex, facing its terrifying pressure.

Just as Qin Sang and the others were filled with terror, they heard Dongyang Bo's voice, "You five, stay close to Miss Chenyan. Activate the Beast Mark Array. While traversing the Immortal Array, focus solely on maintaining the Beast Mark Array; you need not worry about anything else. Remember, no matter what happens, do not panic, and absolutely do not reveal the presence of the ferocious spirits within the Beast Marks!"

Qin Sang felt slightly reassured. He glanced at Chenyan nearby; she stood impassively beside Dongyang Bo, her face hidden beneath her cloak.

Qin Sang, Qiumu Bai, and the others flew behind Chenyan and, following orders, secretly activated their Beast Marks. Fengming, Tieguanzi, and the others followed suit, relying on Dongyang Bo's protection.

They had practiced the various formations of the Five Elements Beast Marks until they were highly proficient. This was a purely defensive formation. Through the connection of the Beast Marks, the five of them became as one, using the power of the marks to withstand attacks exceeding their cultivation level, but without the ability to counterattack.

Seeing five Foundation Establishment cultivators under Dongyang Bo, other Nascent Souls exchanged curious glances, but no one interfered. If they all perished, they'd only be Dongyang Bo's disciples, and the others would likely be secretly pleased.

Qin Sang, however, wasn't worried about his life. With the Beast Mark Array protecting them, and Chenyan's covert support, there was no chance of any accidents.  The formation was quite simple, allowing Qin Sang to observe his surroundings while activating his Beast Mark.

The Little North Star Astral Array, infused with a constant stream of celestial energy, grew increasingly powerful. The North Star had almost become a genuine star. Dongyang Bo and the other Nascent Soul cultivators stood around the array, deploying their treasures to shield their disciples.


The Xiaohan and Tianxing factions remained distinctly separate, each following their respective strongest cultivators.

The feathered demon king, seemingly still recovering from his exertions, stood alone.  His demonic beasts, lacking the Ziwei Secret Technique, were nonetheless permitted entry into the Xiaoběichén Star Array.

After all, he was a Yuan Ying Grandmaster. Each of his magic treasures was exceptionally mysterious and powerful, even the lowest-quality ones being mid-grade artifacts, with several high-grade ones among them!

However, no top-grade artifacts appeared.  Perhaps these Yuan Ying cultivators hadn't exerted their full strength.

As Qin Sang was engrossed in observing the formidable power of these artifacts, his gaze accidentally swept over a Yuan Ying cultivator, causing his eyes to narrow and his expression to subtly change.

The cultivator's artifact was the Xuan Turtle Shell he had seen in the Wuyaya Valley!

There was no mistake!

Qin Sang couldn't help but look again.  This Xuan Turtle Shell was so unique that there couldn't possibly be another identical one.

Presumably, time constraints or a lack of necessity prevented him from using the full array.  This person manipulated the Xuan Turtle Shell to hover above, deploying only nine faces to protect his disciples, unlike the 81-face great array used against the Thunder Swallowing Falcon.


What truly shocked Qin Sang was the cultivator's identity: the yellow-robed Daoist who had initially cooperated with the Red-haired Ancestor and others in setting up the array. He was a member of the Tianxing faction!

"Hiss…"

A deep sense of unease suddenly surged within Qin Sang.

He had initially suspected that the user of the Xuan Turtle Shell might be a magic sect Yuan Ying cultivator.  He never expected it to be someone from the Tianxing faction.

What was the relationship between him and the Wuji Sect Master?

As Yunyouzi had said, in this realm, Yuan Ying cultivators almost represented the peak combat power. They could act as they pleased, and even friendships with cultivators from opposing factions were nothing unusual.

Yet, Qin Sang still felt something was amiss.

Years ago, the two of them had entered the Wuyaya Valley together, both wearing black robes, seemingly deliberately concealing their true identities.

Their first encounter was shortly after entering the inner valley of the Wuyaya Valley.  Neither used any magic treasures or special incantations. Only the pressure from the glow released by a restriction forced them into a precarious situation, compelling this person to deploy the Xuan Turtle Shell to counterattack.

Their second encounter was during the battle with the Thunder Swallowing Falcon. That area was sealed off by endless玄霜煞风 (extremely cold and deadly wind), and it was the deepest part of the Wuyaya Valley, difficult even for Yuan Ying powerhouses to reach, let alone the Thunder Swallowing Falcon’s lair.
