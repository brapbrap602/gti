<h1>Chapter 1913: Locust Plague</h1><p>A fish was pulled onto the boat, a large, green carp weighing seven or eight pounds.</p><p>The fish spear was deeply embedded in the fish's belly.</p><p>This spear had been crafted by splitting one end of a bamboo stalk into three sections, separating them with wooden sticks, binding them with hemp rope, and sharpening the tips into barbs.</p><p>One of the barbs had completely pierced the fish, blood flowing freely.</p><p>The little boy's mouth opened wider, his eyes wide with disbelief.</p><p>The old man who had hauled the carp aboard was also stunned. He had made this spear casually, merely to amuse the child, yet it possessed such power?</p><p>This girl…</p><p>Everyone on the boat looked at Xiaowu with strange expressions.</p><p>Qin Sang drained his cup of wine and said with a smile, "Xiaowu has always been exceptionally strong. Consider this carp payment for our passage…"</p><p>As he spoke, the great river ahead curved again, continuing its southward course.</p><p>Just around the bend, a dock appeared.</p><p>Seeing the scene on the dock, the old man let out a soft exclamation. Forgetting about Xiaowu, he instructed his grandson to take care of the carp and hurried to the bow, gazing out.</p><p>Along the way, they had passed several docks, scattered along both banks of the river, the two boats each following their own course.</p><p>Ahead was another pair of docks, facing each other across the river, but the scenes on the two banks were vastly different.</p><p>A few passengers stood scattered on the east bank, while the west bank’s dock was crowded with people.</p><p>A sea of heads bobbed, all carrying bundles large and small.</p><p>Most of these people were able-bodied men and women, the pillars of their families, with no children or elderly among them. Yet, they didn't seem to be refugees.</p><p>The boat ahead was moored at the dock, its stern packed with people, riding low in the water.</p><p>Seeing the overcrowded boat, the dock's passengers still tried to squeeze aboard, some nearly falling into the water, prompting angry shouts from a burly man.</p><p>Seeing the approaching boat, the burly man's eyes lit up, and he shouted, "Uncle Chen, my boat is full! Take them aboard yours."</p><p>Without further ado, he untied the mooring ropes and pushed off the shore with a powerful thrust of his oar. The boat's speed was noticeably slower than before.</p><p>The old man quickly turned his boat, picking up his passengers from the east bank first, then heading toward the west bank.</p><p>As soon as the boat approached, people eagerly tried to jump aboard.</p><p>The crowd on the shore pressed together, desperate to board, fearing they would be left behind.</p><p>The wooden dock creaked and groaned, making one worry it might collapse.</p><p>"Don't rush! Don't rush! There's room! There's room!"</p><p>The old man called out, steadying the boat and blocking the bow, allowing people to board one by one.</p><p>The first to board was a farmer, caught by the old man's grip.</p><p>"Old Yue, why has everyone from the five western villages come out? What's happened?"</p><p>The farmer sighed, "A calamity has struck!"</p><p>"What?"</p><p>The old man was startled. A commotion arose in the cabin as the previous passengers poked their heads out, anxiously asking,</p><p>"A calamity?"</p><p>"What kind of calamity? Where did it come from?"</p><p>…</p><p>These were villagers who toiled the land, acutely sensitive to the word "calamity."</p><p>During years of disaster, life was unbearable, and those who had lived through them dared not recall the experience.</p><p>Fortunately, Beikuo County was blessed with good fortune, experiencing major calamities only once every decade or so, and they could always manage to survive.</p><p>This year hadn't been particularly bountiful, but it was far from a disaster.</p><p>Moreover, the other villages were unaffected, with only these five villages suffering.</p><p>"Locusts!"</p><p>"A locust plague is coming!"</p><p>…</p><p>The people on the dock chattered.</p><p>"What! Locusts!"</p><p>"A swarm is coming from the west?"</p><p>Everyone paled, several rushing out of the cabin, panic-stricken. "Is there really a swarm?"</p><p>Beikuo County, nestled between mountains and water, hadn't seen a locust plague in at least a century.</p><p>But the people had all heard tales of the terror of locusts, surpassing even floods and droughts. Now, during the lean season, before the crops were ready for harvest,</p><p>a swarm would leave nothing behind. How would they survive this year?</p><p>"We haven't seen the swarm yet," Old Yue shook his head. "Our village elder raises a goshawk, you know. That goshawk is incredibly intelligent and can carry messages across many mountains. Two days ago, a message came from the west, saying that hunters had gone deep into the mountains and discovered several mountains nearly stripped bare. A dark mass was flying east, possibly toward our Beikuo County."</p><p>"When locusts pass, even mountains are left barren. How can people survive?  We’re heading to the city to find work and earn enough to survive the winter…"</p><p>Once the locust plague arrived, who knew how many refugees would flood the city? No wonder they were so anxious.</p><p>Hearing this, the passengers also panicked. Some immediately called out to disembark and rush back to spread the news.</p><p>The farmer enviously said to the old man, "Old Chen, you’re lucky. You don’t have to fear.  With everyone heading to the city, a few days' work will earn you what you'd make in a year.”</p><p>"With the crops devoured, where will we buy food?"</p><p>The old man saw things clearly, shaking his head and sighing. He called his grandson over, muttering, "Boy, once we reach the city, go to the shop and buy several sacks of rice. Grandpa will have to make a few extra trips today…"</p><p>People continued to board, filling the cabin, and the bow and stern were also crowded.</p><p>Further ahead, there would be little room left for anyone else, and the rest would have to be left behind.</p><p>Among the crowd, the green horse stood out, a crane among chickens.</p><p>"Boatman…"</p><p>Qin Sang, with Xiaowu in tow, had walked to the stern, calling out, "Bring the stern to shore.  This humble Daoist has eaten and drunk his fill, and the horse has rested enough.  We’ll make room for the villagers."</p><p>"Oh dear! Look at this situation…"</p><p>Having drunk the medicinal wine, the old man now considered Qin Sang a divine figure, reluctant to see him leave.</p><p>Yet, the situation was such that having the green horse disembark would indeed free up a large space.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang's insistence, he had no choice but to turn the boat, bringing the stern to shore.</p><p>"Boy, quick, bring the remaining cured meat…"</p><p>"Oh!"</p><p>The little boy was quick-witted. Before his grandfather finished, he understood, grabbed the bundle containing the cured meat, ran to the stern, and without a word, thrust it into Qin Sang's arms.</p><p>"Thank you for your kindness, boatman and young friend."</p><p>Qin Sang didn't refuse, accepting the bundle and placing it on the horse's back. He helped Xiaowu up as well, cupped his hands in farewell, and prepared to step ashore.</p><p>"Wait!"</p><p>The little boy suddenly shouted, rummaged through his treasure chest, ran back to the green horse, and raised something in his hand, calling out clearly,</p><p>"Xiaowu, this is for you!"</p><p>The boy held a pellet drum, its surface covered with painted velvet cloth, decorated with a tiger's head. Pellets struck the drum's surface, making a咚咚sound.</p><p>It was the most exquisite toy in his treasure chest, and his favorite.</p><p>Xiaowu lowered her head, not reaching for it.</p><p>"For you!"</p><p>The green horse was too tall, so the little boy, emboldened, approached the horse, stood on his tiptoes, and forcefully placed the pellet drum in Xiaowu's hand.</p><p>Xiaowu 'looked' at Qin Sang.</p><p>"Remember what to say?" Qin Sang reminded her softly, not interfering.</p><p>Xiaowu hesitated for a moment then said softly, "Thank you."</p><p>"You're welcome."</p><p>The little boy grinned, sweat on his face gleaming in the sun.</p><p>'Bang!'</p><p>The green horse leaped, landing steadily on the shore amidst the gasps of the crowd, clearing the river in a single bound.</p><p>The little boy stood at the stern, waving vigorously, his face full of reluctance.</p><p>Suddenly, Xiaowu tugged the reins, turning the horse around. "What… is your name?"</p><p>"Me?"</p><p>The little boy scratched his head, suddenly regretting never having asked his grandfather to find a scholar to give him a proper name.</p><p>His eyes lit up. He shouted,</p><p>"Ya'er! Grandpa calls me Ya'er! Grandpa's surname is Chen, so I'm Chen Ya'er!"</p><p>…</p><p>'Dong…'</p><p>'Dong dong dong…'</p><p>The mellow sound of the drum echoed through the woods.</p><p>Sunlight filtered through the leaves, dappling the forest path. Occasionally, birdsong chirped, harmonizing with the drumbeats, adding to the tranquility.</p><p>Having disembarked, Qin Sang didn't head south, but followed the path along the riverbank toward the five western villages mentioned by the villagers.</p><p>Xiaowu sat on horseback, gently shaking the pellet drum, her face not expressing particular delight, but rather performing the action subconsciously.</p><p>'Pfft!'</p><p>Zhuque, held back by Qin Sang and having missed out on the fish, could no longer restrain himself. He plunged into the bundle and snatched a piece of cured meat.</p><p>"Ptoo! Ptoo! Ptoo!"</p><p>The salty, fishy taste assaulted his senses. Zhuque hurriedly spat it out. "Ah! Ah! Ah! That stinks!"</p><p>Had that fish soup really been made with this stuff?</p><p>"Hahahaha…"</p><p>Seeing Zhuque's predicament, Qin Sang burst into laughter.</p><p>Luohou reared its front hooves, letting out a neigh.</p><p>Xiaowu didn't laugh, but shook the pellet drum more vigorously.</p><p>Zhuque, enraged, yelled at them.</p><p>"Here, for you."</p><p>After his laughter subsided, Qin Sang produced a bowl of fish soup with meat, which he had saved specifically.</p><p>Zhuque eyed Qin Sang suspiciously, sniffing cautiously before devouring the soup.</p><p>The path meandered.</p><p>Climbing over a ridge revealed vast expanses of farmland, a village nestled at the foot of the mountain.</p><p>The path cut through the village, continuing westward. The terrain remained relatively flat, with farmland and villages still visible in the distance.</p><p>Willow trees lined both sides of the path, their lush green canopies providing ample shade, far more vibrant than other trees.</p><p>The village below the mountain was eerily silent, devoid of smoke from cooking fires.  It seemed everyone had left.</p><p>Qin Sang and his companions continued onward, passing through the fourth village. Rounding a bend in the mountains, the scene ahead suddenly became lively.</p><p>The villagers from all five villages had gathered, crowding the roadside.</p><p>A group of people carried a long table at the front, followed by others dressed in colorful attire, playing music and beating drums. Although they were mostly women, children, and the elderly, the atmosphere was still festive.</p><p>An uninformed observer might mistake it for a temple festival or a joyous celebration, but the faces of the crowd held no joy, only worry.</p><p>Qin Sang approached openly, immediately attracting attention. More and more people noticed them, whispering amongst themselves.</p><p>The group carrying the long table headed straight for the western mountain path, led by a white-haired elder. His body was robust, but his spirit seemed somewhat diminished, his cloudy eyes filled with deep concern.</p><p>He held a long pole, guiding the procession.</p><p>Those carrying the table were also elderly, and after a while, their strength gave out. The white-haired elder signaled for a rest.</p><p>It was then that he noticed the strangers. Seeing Qin Sang dressed as a Daoist, his eyes lit up. He whispered a few instructions, set down the pole, and hurried over.</p><p>"This Immortal Master…" Reaching Qin Sang, the white-haired elder bowed respectfully.</p><p>"This humble Daoist is known as Qingfeng.  Elder, are you offering sacrifices to a god?" Qin Sang gestured towards the long table laden with offerings and incense.</p><p>"God… Yes! Yes! Yes!  Offering sacrifices! We are offering sacrifices!"</p><p>The white-haired elder nodded excitedly, his face full of anticipation. "Immortal Master, you are an enlightened expert. You must surely understand matters of gods and spirits?"</p><p>"I have some understanding."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded slightly. "However, this humble Daoist cannot discern which god you are offering sacrifices to. Hearing that a locust swarm is approaching, are you asking the gods for protection?"</p><p>"This…"</p><p>The white-haired elder glanced behind him, pulled Qin Sang away from the crowd, and bent his knees, about to kneel.  "Please, Immortal Master, guide this old man!"</p><p>Qin Sang held his arms.  "Elder, there's no need for such formality. This humble Daoist came here upon hearing of this matter.  If I can help, I naturally will. If not, then it cannot be helped."</p><p>"To be honest with Immortal Master, I had a dream a few days ago…"</p><p>The white-haired elder, having finally encountered a Daoist, clung to him like a drowning man to a lifeline, pouring out his story.</p><p>It turned out that the white-haired elder was the village head of the first village, named Yue Kaishan.</p><p>A few days ago, Yue Kaishan had dreamed of a scholar in a tall hat and green robes.</p><p>The scholar had said in the dream that the Locust God would soon arrive, bringing a plague of locusts, and told him to prepare in advance.</p><p>Yue Kaishan had woken up with a start, finding everything normal. However, he had the same dream the following night, realizing something was amiss.</p><p>He released his goshawk into the mountains, but the bird flew west for a few mountains, then returned, circling overhead and screeching, refusing to go further west.</p><p>That night, Yue Kaishan had the same dream again and could no longer sit still. He decided it was better to be safe than sorry.</p><p>But how could he convince the villagers of his dream?  Appealing to the local Earth God shrine yielded no response.</p><p>After much thought, Yue Kaishan fabricated a letter, and following the scholar's instructions in the dream, set up an altar on the western mountain pass, offering sacrifices to the Locust God, pleading for it to spare them, unsure if it would work.</p><p>During this time, Yue Kaishan bore the pressure alone, unable to eat or sleep, his health deteriorating.</p><p>"Locust God…"</p><p>Qin Sang pondered, glancing at the willow trees beside him. "It sounds like a divine being appeared in your dream to warn you. Elder, you should follow the scholar's instructions. There shouldn't be any problems. Rest assured, this humble Daoist will not leave before the sacrifices are completed."</p><p>Hearing this, Yue Kaishan felt reassured, returning to lead the ritual.</p><p>The ritual continued for three days, the altar remaining on the western mountain pass, with fresh offerings placed each morning.</p><p>On the morning of the fourth day,</p><p>A woman riding a donkey suddenly appeared on the mountain path beyond the pass, exactly as the scholar had described.</p><p>Yue Kaishan led everyone, following the scholar’s instructions, kneeling and pleading: “Life is hard for mortals. We beg the Locust God for mercy, to stay your hand.”</p><p>The woman stopped before the altar and snorted. "That withered willow dared to interfere with my path!  The crops shall be spared. Since you willingly offer yourself in their place, then suffer the consequences.”</p><p>With that, she turned her donkey and entered the deep mountains.</p><p>Soon, dark clouds appeared in the western sky.  A swarm of locusts blotted out the sun, buzzing loudly.</p><p>The crowd was terrified.</p><p>But the swarm passed overhead, not descending upon the fields, but settling instead on the willow trees, then flying off into the barren mountains.</p><p>Wherever the locusts went, the willow leaves were devoured, and the once vibrant trees now appeared withered and desolate.</p><p>"They're gone!"</p><p>"The swarm is gone!"</p><p>"They didn't eat the crops!  They really didn't eat the crops!"</p><p>…</p><p>The people rejoiced, having survived the ordeal.</p><p>Qin Sang, standing by the mountain path, had witnessed everything without intervening.  The Locust God hadn't noticed him.</p><p>His gaze swept over the ravaged willows. Qin Sang flicked his fingers, sending out droplets of jade-like liquid that transformed into a fine rain, sprinkling the trees.</p><p>"Master, why didn't you kill her?" Xiaowu looked up, her face filled with innocent curiosity.</p><p>(End of Chapter)</p>
