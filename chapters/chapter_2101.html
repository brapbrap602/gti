<h1>Chapter 2092: A Sight Unseen</h1><p>As the cultivators withdrew their spiritual energy, the mountains trembled, rocks tumbled, rivers flowed backward, and the earth cracked open. Dust filled the air, wails echoed everywhere, and birds and beasts fled in terror. The once idyllic scene was utterly devastated.</p><p>The disciples of Qingyang Temple were awakened by the horrifying sight.  They hadn't anticipated their sect's failure, and even if they had, they couldn't have imagined such catastrophic consequences.  Their new mountain gate seemed destined to become ruins, decades of hard work reduced to rubble in an instant!</p><p>This defeat dealt a severe blow to the morale of the Qingyang disciples.</p><p>They flew into the air and looked towards the main peak. The main peak, the highest of all, housed the main hall and many other important structures.  The hall, perpetually radiating golden light, was the symbol of Qingyang Temple.  From anywhere in the sect, one could see its brilliant glow and the majestic peak.</p><p>Now, dust and smoke obscured everything. The golden light from the main peak was gone, swallowed by the gloom, leaving the sky a dismal gray, mirroring the darkness in their hearts.</p><p>The more powerful cultivators sensed something amiss. This wasn't a simple mishap; someone had forcefully disrupted their formation. They needed answers.</p><p>As despair settled, a blinding golden light suddenly shot from the main peak, piercing the smoky sky and calming their troubled spirits.</p><p>A gong resonated, and the Temple Master’s voice echoed throughout the mountain:</p><p>“The Changyou tribe has attacked! North Sea is in critical danger! All disciples at the Golden Core stage and above, follow me to North Sea immediately! Other disciples, obey your orders!”</p><p>Another crushing blow, weighing heavily on their hearts, yet also clarifying the Temple Master’s decision. Even disregarding the greater good, the Beichen region housed Qingyang Temple's ancestral grounds, along with various branch temples and many fellow disciples stationed in the North Sea. They couldn't possibly abandon them.</p><p>Moreover, the fact that they had invited various powerful cultivators had left the North Sea vulnerable, providing the enemy with an opportunity.  They had a duty to rescue the North Sea, both publicly and privately.</p><p>Only in times of extreme crisis would the Temple Master issue an order with the golden talisman; disobedience was considered treason.  Every Golden Core and Nascent Soul cultivator within Qingyang Temple, without hesitation, flew towards the main peak.</p><p>Simultaneously, immense shadows emerged beneath the golden light – numerous magical vessels.</p><p>Qingyang disciples converged on the main peak from all directions.  Some sharper minds noticed something unusual and grew suspicious.</p><p>Why was the enemy's attack so perfectly timed?</p><p>Even the powerful cultivators were puzzled.  Qingyang Temple had secretly invited them, and their stay was supposed to be a few months at most.</p><p>The Changyou tribe not only seized the opportune moment, but all signs pointed to a meticulously planned, large-scale offensive that far exceeded their previous deployment in the North Sea.  They must have been plotting for a long time, secretly maneuvering their troops into the region.</p><p>“Temple Master Li!”</p><p>Autumn Iris, her brows furrowed, asked, “How many knew about this?”</p><p>Li Yu Fu sighed, “Shortly after the mountain gate's construction, I ordered the sect to close its doors to visitors. I personally visited each of you to request assistance; there shouldn't have been any leaks.  Only a few venerable guests visited during the initial stages of rebuilding the mountain gate...”</p><p>“You can’t be too careful, Temple Master Li!” Han Xi lamented.</p><p>“If someone deliberately leaked information, their treachery should be punished!” Qiu Mu Bai said coldly.</p><p>It was too late for regrets; they had to return immediately. If the Changyou tribe attacked the Xianyue region, the situation would become dire.</p><p>Li Yu Fu summoned several core disciples, gave them instructions, and then, along with the other powerful cultivators, set off to aid the North Sea.</p><p>After Li Yu Fu and the others left, Qingyang Temple sprang into action, preparing for departure.  Disciples boarded the magical vessels, which soared into the sky, disappearing into the distance.</p><p>At that moment, the panicked disciples of Qingyang Temple were unaware that all the powerful cultivators, including the Temple Master, had left.  No one was left to control the collapsing protective formation. But, surprisingly, the destruction didn't continue unabated.</p><p>An unnoticed change was taking place within the mountain gate. The apocalyptic scene began to subside.</p><p>Within the forbidden grounds,</p><p>Qin Sang sat on his altar, palm open, facing the sky.</p><p>His consciousness and spiritual energy extended outward, ultimately enveloping the entire Qingyang Temple – every mountain, river, plant, and tree was within his awareness.</p><p>Qin Sang had complete control over every change occurring within Qingyang Temple, including the crumbling protective formation, a formation usually requiring the combined might of several powerful cultivators.  Now, he held it under his sole command.</p><p>The main protective array suffered multiple collapses.  Adjacent sub-arrays clashed, not merging but instead colliding, shaking the spirit veins and causing earthquakes.</p><p>Qin Sang subtly moved his mind, slowly raising his hand.  Silently, all the spirit veins stabilized.  The surface chaos hadn't completely subsided, but that was merely superficial.</p><p>Immediately, Qin Sang took control of all the sub-arrays.  Those not destroyed were rapidly repairing themselves, their components restoring.</p><p>During the array's construction, Li Yu Fu had produced extra components, stored in the treasure vault. Qin Sang retrieved them, sending them to the damaged sub-arrays.</p><p>Soon, all sub-arrays were fully restored.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression was calm. He suddenly clenched his fist. Qingyang Temple had invested heavily in the protective array; it couldn't be simply used as bait and destroyed.  With Qin Sang, the situation could be reversed!</p><p>While several Nascent Soul cultivators working together would proceed cautiously, Qin Sang acted effortlessly.  In his vision, this wasn't even the complete protective array.</p><p>As expected, the array formed under Qin Sang's control, becoming an unseen force surrounding the mountain gate.</p><p>The charade would continue. Qin Sang didn't activate the array immediately; the surface turmoil persisted.</p><p>…</p><p>“Master Li, Palace Master Tong, you two will need to personally write to the Yao, Wu, and Zhongzhou sects to request assistance. This is the only way to resolve this crisis.”</p><p>Lei Mansion's master, known as Master Lei, wore a loose-fitting head covering and a robe with thunder patterns.  His long beard reached his chest, his eyes sharp, and his features strong.</p><p>By the time they return to the North Sea, the situation may be far worse. Gathering their armies can only delay the Changyou attack; a counterattack is impossible.</p><p>To repel the Changyou, reinforcements from Zhongzhou are essential.</p><p>"The Feather King's secret message should arrive soon.  While away, we must adapt. I can also write a letter in the Feather King's name," Han Xi interjected.</p><p>Qingyang Temple has Qin Sang, Xuantian Palace has  Liuli. These two sects are considered sacred lands by the people of the Storm World, commanding great prestige. Adding the North Sea Yao, their combined influence is significant.</p><p>“That's what should be done!”</p><p>Li Yu Fu nodded, and with Tong Lingyu and Han Xi, they carefully drafted the letters, explaining the situation and sending them in all three names.</p><p>…</p><p>Meanwhile, Zhongzhou had learned of the North Sea attack, but their main concern was Xihang.</p><p>As expected, Xihang was also under heavy attack by the Changyou army, with widespread fighting.</p><p>The Changyou’s attack on the North Sea, simultaneous with their threat to Xihang, was completely unexpected, leaving Xihang in a critical situation.</p><p>Xihang, Great Compassion Temple.</p><p>The original Great Compassion Temple was destroyed soon after the Changyou attack, forcing relocation. Master Huaiyin led the Xihang monks to rebuild around the ancient teleportation array to Zhongzhou.</p><p>Faced with the enemy, Xihang's people united. Zhongzhou sects understood that if Xihang fell, Zhongzhou would lose its strongest defense. During that period, they reinforced Xihang without reservation, successfully defending the ancient teleportation array. Qingyang Temple, Xuantian Palace, and other North Sea forces played a crucial role.</p><p>This teleportation array remains within the temple, weathering centuries of storms.</p><p>Now, the Great Compassion Temple serves as the Xihang allied forces' main camp.</p><p>The allied forces include Xihang cultivators, Zhongzhou cultivators, the Yaohai and East Sea Yao, the Wu, and Canglang Sea cultivators. Qingyang Temple also relocated to Luye and sent many disciples to garrison Xihang.</p><p>The alliance's internal forces were complex. Self-governance presented many risks. After several setbacks, they established rules.</p><p>Forces were divided by region, each under a high-level leader, stationed in Xihang.</p><p>The alliance also needed a supreme commander. Initially, Liuli readily took the role. As various factions gained strength, Liuli relinquished command. With humanity's dominance, the Sanjiao Alliance rose to prominence, establishing a rotation of command between the Eight Scenic Spots, Ganlu Zen Monastery, and Tianhao Tower.</p><p>Master Huaiyin was the local leader, but his cultivation and reputation were relatively lower, yet his status was exceptional. Though not the supreme commander, Xihang matters were first discussed with him.</p><p>Over time, the Sanjiao Alliance's power grew. They did not anticipate that their biggest threat would not be Liuli, but the Yao.</p><p>The East Sea and Yaohai Yao grew increasingly powerful, but they hadn't directly challenged the alliance's leadership. The current supreme commander was still from the Sanjiao Alliance:  Elder Fan, the Great Elder of Tianhao Tower.</p><p>Following the death of the Sect Master, Fan Laomo attempted to seize control, but Ku Rong Laomo proved superior, leaving Fan Laomo to remain Grand Elder.</p><p>Great Compassion Temple.</p><p>The atmosphere in the Great Hero Hall was heavy.  Fan Laomo, Master Huaiyin, and various experts from different regions gathered.  Among them were some of Qin Sang's old acquaintances, including Valley Master Mu representing the Witch Clan, Yuan Zhu representing the Yaohai Tribe, and Bao Xi representing the Canglang Sea.</p><p>"What are your thoughts?"</p><p>Fan Laomo sat at the head, Master Huaiyin to his left.  He surveyed the assembled group with a gloomy gaze, finally resting on Master Huaiyin.</p><p>Master Huaiyin mused, "I have personally investigated the front lines and confirmed with several fellow cultivators. The Changyou Tribe's attack, while appearing ferocious, doesn't show a significant increase in troop numbers.  Their main force remains the one stationed in the Western Wastelands, and none of their elders have appeared."</p><p>Bao Xi pressed, "So, it's certain the Changyou Tribe's main attack is directed at the North Sea?"</p><p>"How do we know it's not a feint!"</p><p>Fan Laomo frowned, abruptly interrupting Bao Xi. He stared at Master Huaiyin. "Are you certain of the enemy's intentions, Abbot?  A misjudgment could have disastrous consequences!"</p><p>"This..."</p><p>Master Huaiyin hesitated.</p><p>The matter was of grave importance; no one was entirely sure.</p><p>Fan Laomo looked around at everyone. "Fellow cultivators, remember, in warfare, the real is often disguised as the unreal, and vice-versa. The Changyou Tribe's attack on the North Sea may be a diversion; their true target might be us! We must be vigilant!"</p><p>Bao Xi urged, "The North Sea's first line of defense has fallen, suffering repeated defeats. Isn't that enough proof of the situation?"</p><p>"That's the North Sea's own fault!" Fan Laomo sneered. "If Qingyang Temple hadn't taken away so many Transcendence Stage experts, leaving the North Sea vulnerable, this wouldn't have happened!"</p><p>Yuan Zhu's eyes flickered, shaking his head. "Elder Fan, that's a biased assessment. Qingyang Temple only took some experts, and the North Sea's main army hadn't moved. After years of preparation, they collapsed in a single battle, offering no resistance.  The enemy's strength is clearly evident. Moreover, Changyou elders have appeared in the North Sea. They cannot simultaneously target both the North Sea and Central Plains. Even if they have ambushes in the Western Wastelands, we can withstand them."</p><p>Fan Laomo coldly questioned, "Elder Yuan Zhu must have consulted the Jiao Long King and the Golden Toad King.  Is this their decision?"</p><p>Yuan Zhu stiffened. He had sent numerous messages, all unanswered; he had no idea what his clan was thinking.</p><p>A sneer touched Fan Laomo's lips. At that moment, Valley Master Mu interjected, "What are the Three Teach Alliance's plans?"</p><p>Fan Laomo couldn't be too obvious, so he composed himself. "As you know, the three Sect Masters are in seclusion, preparing a treasure to counter the might of late Transcendence Stage cultivators. Their retreat is sealed by a powerful formation, and even I dare not intrude.  Currently, the Alliance headquarters is managed by Seven Views Zhenjun and Saintly One Yin Ci.  Their authority is less than the three Sect Masters; they can't easily control all factions.  Since the two haven't replied, they must be calling various sects to discuss.  Our next move will depend on the situation."</p><p>"Elder Fan means the Three Teach Alliance cannot immediately reinforce the North Sea? Can't they divide their forces to cover both areas?" Valley Master Mu pressed.</p><p>Fan Laomo calmly replied, "Whether to divide our forces is something Zhenjun and Saintly One will carefully consider. Remember, going to the North Sea is far less convenient than the Western Wastelands. If we move troops, the Western Wastelands will be in danger, making reinforcements difficult."</p><p>Before he finished, someone called out, "Improper!"</p><p>Fan Laomo's eyes narrowed.  He found the speaker to be Master Huaiyin and frowned. "Abbot, what do you mean?"</p><p>"When our temple was in ruins, and the Western Wastelands fell, Fairy Liuli and the North Sea cultivators came to our aid, fighting valiantly. I still remember those days vividly, and I have never been able to repay their kindness. Now, Fairy Liuli is severely wounded because of her battle with the Changyou clan leader; otherwise, we wouldn't have obtained so much Qingling energy. The North Sea is in trouble, how can we ignore it!"</p><p>Master Huaiyin's expression was solemn.</p><p>As the Western Wastelands' overlord and Abbot of the Great Compassion Temple, his words represented the entire region's will, carrying immense weight, even Fan Laomo couldn't openly rebuke him.</p><p>Valley Master Mu and others rejoiced, agreeing wholeheartedly.</p><p>Not only the Western Wastelands, but Yaohai and Canglang Sea also benefited from Liuli's aid. If she hadn't led the Central Plains and North Sea cultivators to rescue them, they would have been destroyed.</p><p>However, not everyone felt gratitude.</p><p>Fan Laomo hadn't expected Master Huaiyin to be the first to speak up.  He cursed inwardly, "It seems the Buddhist sects aren't a monolith. I wonder what those bald donkeys at Ganlu Temple are doing!"</p><p>Just then, someone shouted from outside the hall.</p><p>"Report! A secret message from Qingyang Temple!"</p>
