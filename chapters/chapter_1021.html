<h1>Chapter 1113:  The Spirit and the Witch</h1><p>Chapter 1113:  The Spirit and the Witch</p><p>Jiu Feng Wang sat cross-legged on a rock, her hand seals shifting rapidly, her fingertips emitting dancing lights.  After a moment, the lights intertwined, transforming into a small, colorful phoenix, lifelike and graceful.</p><p>The phoenix circled above Jiu Feng Wang's head, its wings scattering shimmering light as it moved. Jiu Feng Wang looked up, her gaze fixed on the phoenix's eyes. Her lips moved slightly as she performed an arcane ritual. Then, she pricked her finger, drawing a drop of blood, and gently touched the phoenix.</p><p>The instant their fingers touched, the blood flowed into the phoenix.  The phoenix stiffened, its wings folding before it transformed into a brilliant light and entered Jiu Feng Wang’s forehead. The phoenix had entered her body.</p><p>Jiu Feng Wang's head snapped up; her body trembled, her beautiful face contorting in pain. A muffled groan escaped her throat, followed by a sudden surge of energy.</p><p>Jiao Long Wang, prepared for this, waved his hand, unleashing a golden light that formed a barrier, sealing off the entire mountain valley. The groan was then replaced by a clear, ringing phoenix cry.</p><p>With a whoosh, wings unfurled from her back. Jiu Feng Wang levitated, turning to gaze toward the Immortal Barrier, a strange light flickering in her eyes.</p><p>The hulking warrior and the other demons suppressed their curiosity, silently watching Jiu Feng Wang.  After a while, Jiu Feng Wang slowly exhaled and nodded to Jiao Long Wang.</p><p>Jiao Long Wang relaxed, speaking to the hulking warrior, "Heibrother, there is no need for concern. Jiu Feng and I have made complete preparations. Within the Immortal Barrier lies a fragment of a Celestial Phoenix feather. Once the cultivators enter the inner hall, we will use the feather's power to secretly open a passageway into the barrier."</p><p>"Celestial Phoenix feather?" The hulking warrior was startled. "Could it be the legendary feather of an ancient Celestial Phoenix?  Even in the rich妖海, you found such a treasure?"</p><p>Jiao Long Wang smiled slightly.  "It might not be a true Celestial Phoenix feather, but this fragment does possess a similar spatial power. We can use it to exploit a weakness in the Immortal Barrier created when the Seven Killing Hall appears, allowing us to sneak inside.  This treasure is a prized possession of the phoenix clan, unique to the entire妖海. I expended considerable effort persuading the Phoenix clan to entrust the feather to Jiu Feng to bring it to the Canglang Sea."</p><p>The hulking warrior and the other demons exchanged glances.</p><p>"You used the Celestial Phoenix feather to secretly plant it in the Immortal Barrier ahead of time to buy off the cultivators?" asked the hulking warrior questioningly.</p><p>Jiao Long Wang nodded.</p><p>“Using the Celestial Phoenix feather to break the barrier will cause tremors and alert the human cultivators inside.  If we attract the top human experts, our situation will become dangerous.  During the last opening of the Seven Killing Hall, Jiu Feng ventured inside and placed the feather, alerting some cultivators.  Now, we only need to activate the feather's power, causing far less disturbance.”</p><p>“To achieve this, the tribes of the妖海 sacrificed their sacred sons; my own son was among them.  I've made such a great sacrifice because I'm confident in this plan."</p><p>"Our encounter with you friends in the Canglang Sea was a fortunate surprise. If we succeed, my ascension to the Divine Transformation stage is assured, and you will all receive significant rewards. We will no longer need to fear the cultivators and hide in the barren depths of the sea.”</p><p>Jiu Feng Wang's eyes dimmed, remembering the incredulous expressions of her younger generation twenty years ago, among them Caiyi, whom she raised.</p><p>The hulking warrior and the other demons, having learned this secret information from Jiao Long Wang, were also greatly surprised. After a brief discussion, they asked, "When do you two intend to enter?"</p><p>Jiao Long Wang glanced at the Seven Killing Hall, "We will move once those human cultivators enter the inner hall. Our understanding of the Seven Killing Hall is limited, so we will need your assistance."</p><p>The hulking warrior said solemnly, "We cultivators have long sought this, and we will exert all our efforts."</p><p>"Excellent!" Jiao Long Wang clapped his hands, his gaze fixed on the inner hall within the Immortal Barrier.</p><p>The demons waited patiently in the mountain valley.</p><p>After an unknown amount of time, Jiao Long Wang suddenly said, "Let's move!"</p><p>The demons dashed to the edge of the Immortal Barrier. Jiu Feng and Jiao Long Wang stood at the forefront, with the other demons behind them.  Jiu Feng Wang had now taken her true form.  With a flutter of her wings, she produced a beautiful phoenix feather, flew close to the barrier, and emitted a series of urgent low calls.</p><p>Within the Immortal Barrier, the long feather reappeared, responding to Jiu Feng Wang's call, burning with intense flames.</p><p>The next moment, Jiu Feng Wang's phoenix feather blazed with light, while the Heavenly Phoenix Feather suddenly erupted in flames, dispelling the surrounding darkness.</p><p>The Heavenly Phoenix Feather was inserted into the Celestial Barrier, and a strange wave passed between the two feathers.</p><p>Jiu Feng Wang let out a soft cry.</p><p>Jiao Long Wang's expression shifted slightly. He led the demons forward, and they were immediately enveloped by the feather's light.</p><p>In an instant, the demons vanished, and the Celestial Barrier was restored.  They had secretly infiltrated the inner hall.</p><p>"We're in?"</p><p>The armored man was still somewhat incredulous; they had infiltrated the human sanctuary so easily.</p><p>He surveyed his surroundings, finding only darkness. His gaze fell upon the Heavenly Phoenix Feather, and he noticed Jiu Feng Wang staring at it with an unusually serious expression.</p><p>Jiao Long Wang asked, "How is it?"</p><p>Jiu Feng Wang said regretfully, "The remaining power of the feather is less than half."</p><p>Without Jiao Long Wang needing to remind them, the other demons had already dispersed to scout the surrounding terrain.</p><p>After a short while, the armored man and the other demons returned, stating gravely, "This is a barren land, vast in extent, without living creatures, nor any trace of human restrictions or spirit formations."</p><p>Jiao Long Wang's expression remained unchanged. After a moment's thought, he produced a finger-length bone.</p><p>Holding the bone, golden light flickered in Jiao Long Wang's palm.</p><p>The demons exchanged glances, standing silently, watching Jiao Long Wang.</p><p>…</p><p>The Heavenly Tower.</p><p>Several ghostly figures appeared silently before the entrance to the Heavenly Tower.</p><p>They paused, revealing their true forms as they looked towards the entrance of the Seven Killing Hall.</p><p>Leading them was the Great Shaman.</p><p>To the Great Shaman's left, an inconspicuous withered leaf cicada floated quietly in mid-air.</p><p>The others looked at the Great Shaman and the cicada with a hint of awe.</p><p>"The human cultivators have gone in; we should act,"</p><p>The Great Shaman said softly to the cicada.</p><p>Fang Lao Mo, without a word, vanished into thin air, leading the way into the Heavenly Tower.</p><p>The tests on the first few levels of the Heavenly Tower were nothing to them. With Fang Lao Mo leading the way, the cultivators proceeded smoothly to the seventh level.</p><p>"The humans haven't left any defenses here. It seems there are more alluring treasures in the inner hall,"</p><p>The Great Shaman said calmly.</p><p>Fang Lao Mo sneered, "Unless the Demon Lord and his followers personally guard this place, how could they possibly stop us? It would only be self-humiliation!"</p>
