You have to tell me what you’re going to do first. Otherwise, if something goes wrong, this junior won’t be able to explain it to the sect.”</p><p>Zhao Songqiao was silent for a moment, then said, “Junior Brother is right. I will no longer hide anything! I once obtained a heretical demonic technique that uses the power of thunder to draw lightning into one’s dantian, breaking and rebuilding it to forcibly achieve Foundation Establishment. Junior Brother also knows that the power of lightning is extremely violent and terrifying. I’m afraid that before I even touch the lightning, I will be incinerated.  After much searching, I learned that in your sect's Dark Thunderwood, due to the peculiar properties of the dark thunderwood, there is a thin accumulation of Yin lightning, which is much gentler than elsewhere, and might allow for success. But my senior sect members would never allow me to risk this method, so I can only ask Junior Brother Zhang for help. If I truly succeed, I'm willing to give this technique to Junior Brother Zhang.  Junior Brother can also propose other conditions; whatever I can do, I will not hesitate for a moment!”</p><p>Zhao Songqiao’s tone was resolute.</p><p>“Lightning-based Foundation Establishment?”</p><p>Hua Shen was astonished.</p><p>This method was the first time he had ever heard of it.  A cultivator at the Qi Condensation stage daring to draw lightning into their body – it usually results in death, this person is incredibly daring.</p><p>However, the four words "break and rebuild" were something he understood well.</p><p>He and Yun Youzi had both gone through this.</p><p>Another ruthless person?</p><p>Hua Shen glanced at Zhao Songqiao, his face thoughtful.</p><p>At this time, Fang Ting couldn't help but speak up, pleading, “Senior Brother Zhang, if you can enter the Dark Thunderwood, please help Senior Brother Zhao.”</p><p>Hua Shen raised an eyebrow, “Junior Sister, you have a dual spiritual root with excellent aptitude, you won’t lack Foundation Establishment pills in the future, why would you need this dangerous technique?”</p><p>Fang Ting blushed, her lips moved, and she suddenly transmitted in a low voice, “Senior Brother Zhao gave me a Rejuvenating Pill. I originally thought Master would also go, and using Master's name, I… ate the Rejuvenating Pill.  Besides, Senior Brother, you might be able to use this technique. If Senior Brother Zhao fails and dies, we won’t cultivate, we won't lose anything. If the technique succeeds, Senior Brother, you can achieve Foundation Establishment with me!”</p><p>“A Rejuvenating Pill, how old are you?”</p><p>Hua Shen was speechless.</p><p>Rejuvenating Pills maintain one’s youth, not as miraculous as the legendary Eternal Youth Pills, but still rare.</p><p>Cultivators, especially those below the Core Formation stage, find it difficult to completely erase the marks of time; not everyone has Three Lights Liquid. This kind of spiritual medicine is especially tempting to female cultivators.</p><p>Zhao Songqiao had truly chosen the right gift.</p><p>Fang Ting’s face was flushed red.</p><p>Hua Shen heard a hint of sincerity in Fang Ting’s latter words, and fell silent.</p><p>Using Jin Yan’s name to go to the Dark Thunderwood wasn't difficult, and he would also wander around himself. Taking Zhao Songqiao along might be troublesome.</p><p>The key was whether it was worth it.</p><p>He was quite curious about this technique, wondering if he could adapt it for his main body. With his main body’s cultivation, the danger of drawing lightning into his body would be much less.</p><p>Also, he had recently investigated a place, jointly occupied by the Lan Dou Sect and the Yan Miao Pavilion. To infiltrate, he might need to use Fang Ting’s identity.</p><p>“Junior Sister Fang, if it weren’t for you, I would definitely hesitate. Since you’re pleading for Senior Brother Zhao, I can try my best, but I can’t guarantee success.”</p><p>After pondering for a moment, Hua Shen looked up and spoke.</p><p>“Really! Thank you, Senior Brother! As long as you agree, it will surely work!”</p><p>Fang Ting’s worries were finally lifted.</p><p>Zhao Songqiao was also overjoyed, bowing down, his voice trembling slightly, “This senior brother thanks Junior Brother Zhang for your trouble!”</p><p>“Senior Brother Zhao doesn’t need to be so courteous.”</p><p>Hua Shen raised a hand, his tone firm, “Senior Brother Zhao, let’s not mention any conditions, just consider it as helping Junior Sister. But let’s make things clear beforehand; once inside, you must obey my orders and must not act without authorization. Otherwise, if things go wrong, I won’t say a word for you.”</p><p>Then, Hua Shen looked at Fang Ting, “Junior Sister, don’t get too excited, Senior Brother will need your help again sometime later.”</p><p>“Leave it to me.”</p><p>Fang Ting didn’t ask what it was and readily agreed.</p><p>The three of them discussed for a while longer, and Fang Ting and Zhao Songqiao left with happy expressions.</p><p>After sending them off, Hua Shen summoned the Sky Eye Butterfly, secretly pondering. The Sky Eye Butterfly hadn’t detected anything unusual about Zhao Songqiao, he probably was overthinking it.</p><p>He would have the Sky Eye Butterfly constantly monitor Zhao Songqiao, observing him perform the technique. If the man acted strangely, he would kill him immediately.</p><p>However, to bring them in, Hua Shen needed to obtain a mission from Jin Yan.</p><p>Thinking of this, Hua Shen flew out of his cave and headed straight for the stone hall.</p><p>Five days later.</p><p>A cloud of mist, swift as lightning, flew out from the mountains and over the sparkling sea, its speed unabated.  Faint figures could be seen within the mist.</p><p>“Junior Brother Lu, your cloud boat is now refined to such a degree that at full speed, it’s almost as fast as a top-grade magic artifact,”</p><p>Two Daoists stood at the front of the cloud. One, holding a whisk, was Old Daoist Huayang. He leaned slightly, offering a flattering compliment. The other, much younger than Huayang, had sharp eyebrows and piercing eyes, an air of authority about him.  This man, also surnamed Lu, was Lu Xiaoyun’s adopted son. Exceptionally gifted, he was a peak Golden Core cultivator and the head of the foremost peak, Canglan Peak.</p><p>With Lu Xiaoyun absent, he managed the sect’s affairs.  He was the expected successor as the next head of the Lan Dou Sect.  At this moment, he was hidden among the crowd at the back of the cloud boat, silent and unobserved.</p><p>“Senior Brother Huayang, you flatter me.  This artifact, after repeated refinement, has reached its full potential and cannot be improved further. It is far from a top-grade artifact, only suitable for transportation…”</p><p>Lu, the sect head, gazed ahead. “We set out rather early. I wonder if the other sects have arrived yet.”</p><p>“As per custom, Yanmiao Pavilion and the others who helped set up the Dongming Island barrier will have arrived early. As for the other sects, they’ll likely arrive after the Longxing Mountain opens at midnight tonight.”</p><p>Old Daoist Huayang seemed intimately familiar with the proceedings of the ritual gathering.</p><p>Lu nodded slightly.  “This is my first time presiding over the gathering, Senior Brother Huayang, I’ll need your assistance…”</p><p>The cloud boat sped across the blue sky and sea.</p><p>Soon, several unusual lights appeared ahead—various flying artifacts.</p><p>“It’s Sect Head Lu himself!”</p><p>“Greetings to Sect Head Lu!”</p><p>Several figures flew out from the artifacts to greet them.</p><p>—</p><p>—</p><p>Sorry, I overslept. This is yesterday’s update. More to come soon.</p>
