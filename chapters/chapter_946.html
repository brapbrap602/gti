<h1>Chapter 938: The Terms</h1><p>"...On one condition. After I help you shake off your pursuers and we're safe, you must remove the soul imprint from this refined corpse and let this physical body completely belong to me," Bai said in a deep voice.</p><p>Upon hearing this, Qin Sang raised an eyebrow, a sneer appearing on his lips.</p><p>Although this person was an ancient monster who had lived for who knows how many years, his cultivation had yet to recover.  Removing the soul imprint from the Night Fiend would take some effort.</p><p>"Is this your so-called trade?  By helping me evade pursuit, you dare to expose yourself before that person? This matter benefits both of us. Why speak so grandiloquently? You lose nothing. Not only do you escape your cage and fulfill your oath, but you also gain a powerful physical body. From then on, you're a dragon entering the sea, free and unfettered. On the contrary, I have to help you remove the demonic restriction, guide the lost soul, and lose a Night Fiend that I spent countless efforts refining..."</p><p>Qin Sang scoffed at Bai's condition and said in a deep voice, "I admire you for upholding your oath in solitude.  But I cannot agree to this condition!"</p><p>Bai frowned. "Although I haven't refined the remaining spirit within this refined corpse, I have been refining it day and night for decades for fear of my soul dissipating. My soul and this body are now almost inseparable. If forcibly separated, not only will I suffer great damage to my vital energy, I'm afraid I will have no hope of recovery in this life, let alone searching for my true self. Furthermore, even if I return it to you, it's just a refined corpse of the early Core Formation stage. With your current cultivation, it's insignificant. Why are you so fixated on this small gain or loss..."</p><p>Qin Sang simply shook his head in refusal.</p><p>He admired Bai, but he wasn't going to be taken advantage of.</p><p>Qin Sang knew very well that the reason Bai was negotiating with him politely was because he was wary of his strength.</p><p>If he didn't have the refined corpse, the Two-Headed Serpent, and the "Lightning Manipulation Art" that could threaten Bai's life, would Bai still be so persuasive?</p><p>Most likely, Bai would capture him first and force him to agree to all his conditions.</p><p>At most, Bai, out of a shred of benevolence, would spare his life.</p><p>Now, the initiative was in his hands, entirely due to his own formidable strength. If not for the powerful enemy lurking outside, Bai would have already been defeated, and wouldn't have the chance to propose any terms.</p><p>"Show some sincerity in your negotiation," Qin Sang said indifferently.</p><p>Under Qin Sang's gaze, Bai's face darkened.</p><p>With a Nascent Soul enemy outside, this guy could still calmly negotiate with him.</p><p>But on second thought, possessing such divine abilities at the Core Formation stage, forcibly suppressing him and forcing him to admit defeat, how could this person be an easy opponent?</p><p>Bai wanted to refute Qin Sang, but then he thought that this might be the only chance in his life. There wouldn't be a second person who could control demonic fire entering this place.</p><p>Even if he regained his physical body, his lifespan was limited and he definitely wouldn't last until the demonic restriction dissipated on its own.</p><p>Moreover, there was another point that Bai didn't explicitly mention.</p><p>He had tried countless times, but he couldn't break the connection between the refined corpse's spirit and Qin Sang's soul imprint.</p><p>Without removing the refined corpse's spirit and the soul imprint, Bai's soul couldn't perfectly merge with the body, and his cultivation would stagnate, unable to continue improving and break through to the Nascent Soul stage.</p><p>Although he was a remnant soul of an ancient immortal, his physical body had decayed, his spirit had weakened, his memories were fragmented, and what he obtained was a refined corpse. He could only follow the path of a corpse cultivator.</p><p>Cultivation wasn't something that could be restored instantly. It had to be cultivated bit by bit, not much different from other cultivators.</p><p>It was equivalent to having his lifeline in someone else's hands.</p><p>Qin Sang's uncompromising attitude made Bai even more hesitant, suspecting that this person might have noticed.</p><p>With his lifeline in someone else's hands, Bai couldn't help but feel discouraged. He sighed, "I can promise you another condition. As long as you help me refine the remaining spirit within the refined corpse, during this time, I will follow you and act as your enforcer. This should compensate for your loss of the refined corpse, right? But after I fully recover, you cannot stop me from leaving. If you agree, we will swear a heart demon oath. I was forced to cultivate the path of a corpse cultivator. You should know that the constraints of a heart demon oath are a great deterrent to us ghost cultivators. I would never dare to disobey it."</p><p>Qin Sang's heart stirred.</p><p>He didn't expect Bai to propose this condition.</p><p>After leaving the Ghost Realm, Bai wouldn't be able to manipulate the ghost mist, and his strength would be greatly diminished, but it would still be no less than that of a peak Core Formation cultivator.</p><p>With Bai following him, his combat power would increase greatly.</p><p>Looking down upon all Core Formation cultivators wouldn't be an arrogant statement.</p><p>Unfortunately, Bai wouldn't agree to be constantly restricted by him.  In all likelihood, his cultivation speed would be even faster than his own. Reaching Nascent Soul and Deity Transformation wouldn't be difficult, right?</p><p>Bai's origins were extraordinary, and his future potential was immeasurable.</p><p>For such a person, Qin Sang should have tried his best to befriend him and build a good relationship.  Instead, he shook his head and refused again.</p><p>This completely enraged Bai.</p><p>Actually, following Qin Sang wasn't unacceptable.</p><p>The world had changed drastically.</p><p>Bai had been trapped in the Ghost Realm and knew nothing about the outside world.</p><p>Following Qin Sang, he could refine his physical body while gradually understanding the outside world. When the time was ripe, he could part ways with Qin Sang and retrieve his lost memories. It was a wise move.</p><p>He didn't expect to be rejected by Qin Sang again.</p><p>He suppressed his anger, his face full of displeasure, and sneered, "Even my personal service isn't enough? You're truly insatiable! What exactly do you want?"</p><p>Qin Sang showed a contemplative expression. His eyes flashed, and he said in a solemn voice, "There are millions of lost souls in the Ghost Realm, yet only your soul remains intact. Don't you find that a bit strange?  The time you've been trapped is probably measured in tens of thousands of years, right? No matter how high your cultivation was in your previous life, no matter how advanced your techniques were, it's impossible for a single strand of your soul to persist until now. Don't tell me your will is strong enough to withstand the erosion of time!"</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly shouted, staring intently into Bai's eyes and questioning him.</p><p>Bai's face stiffened, his expression changing constantly. Finally, he let out a bitter laugh and said, "You've already guessed it, haven't you? What other treasure in this world can preserve a soul and keep its spirituality intact?"</p><p>"Soul Nourishing Wood!"</p><p>Qin Sang's pupils dilated, and he exclaimed in shock, "You really have Soul Nourishing Wood!"</p><p>Soul Nourishing Wood, one of the ten Divine Woods, had the divine effect of nourishing the soul and strengthening the spirit.</p><p>Only this treasure could allow Bai to persevere until now.</p><p>Even so, Bai only had a single strand of soul left, barely clinging to life. This showed how long he had been trapped.</p><p>After seeing Bai's remnant soul, Qin Sang had a faint suspicion in his heart, but he had been holding back, watching Bai's performance coldly, and finally revealed his true intentions.</p><p>Bai was destined for greatness.</p><p>Since there was no deep-seated hatred between them, given Qin Sang's personality, he wouldn't be too concerned about gains or losses. He might even take the initiative to befriend Bai and build a good relationship.</p><p>Only Soul Nourishing Wood could make Qin Sang lose his composure and stop at nothing!</p><p>His cultivation had stagnated, and originally only the Blood Sand fragment from the Botless Valley in the Small Cold Region could help him. He never expected to encounter Soul Nourishing Wood!</p><p>--</p><p>--</p><p>Some experts guessed it. Impressive!</p>
