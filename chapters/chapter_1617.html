<h1></h1><p>Six Continents Hall headquarters.</p><p>Having been thoroughly disrupted by Ghost Mother, Six Continents Hall was under heavy guard.</p><p>Jiang You, originally intending to attend the Grand Auction, dared not leave the headquarters now.</p><p>Someone entered the courtyard. Jiang You shifted his gaze and saw it was Jiang Mu. "Still no news of Elder Qin?"</p><p>"Elder Qin likely hasn't returned to Rainbow City yet," Jiang Mu shook his head, hesitating slightly. "The thief might have some connection to Elder Qin. If the loss is bearable, we could consider…"</p><p>Jiang You sighed. "The other treasures are secondary. One item was specifically requested by the Enforcement Elder of the瓊影 Sect.  It should have been delivered directly, but to bolster this Treasure Exchange, it was brought to Rainbow City. You know the Hall Master has some ties with the 瓊影 Sect. They've helped us through several difficult situations. Losing this treasure will be hard to explain."</p><p>"This…"</p><p>Jiang Mu was also troubled.</p><p>Jiang You handed him a jade slip. "The Grand Auction is about to begin. You go to the main peak first.  Try to acquire the treasures listed on this slip. I'll wait for Elder Qin at the headquarters."</p><p>"Yes!" Jiang Mu accepted the order and left.</p><p>Not long after Jiang Mu's departure, the restrictive formation was triggered. Jiang You hurriedly rose to greet the newcomer.</p><p>Qin Sang strode into the headquarters. Seeing Jiang You, he took out several jade boxes and handed them over, smiling. "Mission accomplished!"</p><p>Ghost Mother's theft was merely a ploy to draw Qin Sang out and confirm his identity.</p><p>The treasures of Six Continents Hall were beneath her notice; she returned them all.</p><p>Jiang You breathed a sigh of relief.  He didn't ask about the thief's identity, only taking the item requested by the 瓊影 Sect elder. The rest he offered to Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang declined, looking around. "Has Hall Master Mu not arrived yet?"</p><p>Jiang You hummed in affirmation. "The Hall Master sent word that matters in the East Sea are somewhat thorny and will delay him a few days. He'll definitely be back before the Treasure Exchange."</p><p>Too late!</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head inwardly. He couldn't wait for Hall Master Mu in Rainbow City.</p><p>He would travel to the Southern Continent alone.</p><p>The Eight Sceneries Sect and the remnants of the Formless Immortal Sect each harbored ulterior motives, locked in a standoff.</p><p>His goal was to find the Nascent Soul remains and the subsequent cultivation techniques. This didn't conflict with either side's interests, but unforeseen circumstances could arise. Having an ally would make things easier.</p><p>He and Hall Master Mu weren't sworn brothers, but under normal circumstances, they could cooperate.</p><p>"Has there been any movement from the Sweet Dew Zen Monastery?"</p><p>Qin Sang glanced towards the main peak.</p><p>According to Ghost Mother, the Eight Sceneries Sect Master was an imposter, a top expert from Sweet Dew Zen Monastery.  Even Master Xingji and others were present in Rainbow City.</p><p>He wasn't sure whether they were cooperating with the Eight Sceneries Sect to mislead the remnants of the Formless Immortal Sect or if the Sweet Dew Zen Monastery was unaware.</p><p>Qin Sang leaned towards the latter.</p><p>The Daoist and Buddhist sects definitely had their own agendas.</p><p>As far as Qin Sang knew, the Mount Tai Sect had close ties with the Eight Sceneries Sect. Some even rumored that the Mount Tai Sect was secretly supported by the Eight Sceneries Sect. Similar rumors circulated about the Myriad Poison Mountain and Sweet Dew Zen Monastery.</p><p>The Eight Sceneries Sect likely felt confident in dealing with the Formless Immortal Sect remnants and didn't need the Buddhist sect to share the spoils.</p><p>Jiang You mistakenly thought Qin Sang was asking about the Ullambana Assembly. "The Assembly proceedings are unchanged, with only minor alterations. On the third day, there will be a multi-sect competition involving Nascent Soul cultivators. The results will directly affect the power structure of the Middle Continent for the next five hundred years. It's bound to be a fierce battle."</p><p>Qin Sang had considered it. Matters involving the Immortal Palace and cultivation techniques were best not made public.</p><p>When the snipe and clam grapple, the fisherman profits.</p><p>The standoff between the Eight Sceneries Sect and the Formless Immortal Sect remnants presented him with an opportunity to exploit.</p><p>Too many factions involved, countless people vying for limited opportunities – the situation would surely spiral out of control into chaos.  Other factions would more or less have trusted allies.</p><p>The waters of the Middle Continent ran deep!</p><p>"I have other pressing matters and won't be able to attend the Treasure Exchange.  I'll apologize to Hall Master Mu another day," Qin Sang bowed his hands and departed hastily.</p><p>"Elder Qin is…"</p><p>Jiang You was bewildered but couldn't stop Qin Sang. He hurried to summon his subordinates to investigate any major events that had occurred in the Middle Continent recently.</p><p>Flying out of Rainbow City, Qin Sang flew south without stopping.</p><p>Reaching the vicinity of Zhuozhou.</p><p>Qin Sang calculated the time remaining, released his Avatar, while his True Body carved out a cave dwelling in a desolate mountain.</p><p>The Avatar flew to the Nevermind Mountain sect, beneath the former White Cloud Waterfall.</p><p>The Ullambana Assembly was imminent, yet Nevermind Mountain remained silent.</p><p>Gazing up at the boundless void, the Avatar unsheathed the Snow-Treading Divine Saber and slashed upwards. Saber energy cleaved the sky like a ten-thousand-foot cloud wave, vast and majestic.</p><p>The saber energy soared into the heavens, visible for thousands of miles.</p><p>Lu Zhang had obtained the Stone Toad a hundred years ago and should have refined it by now. If he had achieved a breakthrough, he could also be a powerful ally.</p><p>Unlike last time, this involved a struggle for the Immortal Palace. Though somewhat presumptuous, this was the only way to summon them.</p><p>The saber energy lingered.</p><p>A point of rosy light suddenly appeared in the void, gradually expanding into a portal. A man and a woman flew out, gazing down in astonishment.</p><p>"Eh?  Is that the esteemed Daoist Qing Feng of Floating Ferry County?"</p><p>"It is I," the Avatar nodded. Nevermind Mountain indeed had someone remaining.</p><p>"Greetings, Senior Qing Feng." The two bowed.</p><p>The Avatar spoke unceremoniously. "Quickly inform Sect Master Situ and Elder Lu that I have important matters to discuss."</p><p>"This…"</p><p>The two exchanged glances. Seeing the Avatar's unwavering tone, they didn't argue further, turning back to fly into the rosy portal.</p><p>Before long, figures stirred within the portal. One flew out, followed respectfully by the man and woman.</p><p>The newcomer wore a Daoist robe and held a horsetail whisk, his face unfamiliar.</p><p>"I am Cheng Shenzi. Greetings, Daoist Qing Feng."</p><p>So it was him!</p><p>The Avatar returned the greeting and exchanged pleasantries before speaking gravely. "Are Sect Master Situ and Daoist Lu unable to meet me?"</p><p>Seeing Cheng Shenzi, he understood.</p><p>Cheng Shenzi glanced north. "With the Ullambana Assembly approaching, our sect remains in seclusion. As the Daoist should be able to see, our seclusion is not for show, but out of necessity. Both my Senior Brother, the Sect Master, and Junior Brother Lu are in critical stages of closed-door cultivation and cannot be disturbed.  I can convey any message you have. Once their cultivation bears fruit, they will personally visit Cattail Mountain to apologize to you."</p><p>Hearing this, the Avatar couldn't say much more.  He bid farewell and returned the way he came.</p><p>This was the downside of focusing on cultivation and neglecting social connections.</p><p>A dearth of allies when they're needed most.</p><p>However, Qin Sang didn't regret it. If not for his dedicated cultivation, he wouldn't have reached his current level.</p><p>Failing to find reinforcements, he would plunge into the dragon's lair alone!</p><p>When the Avatar returned, the True Body was frowning, deep in thought.</p><p>The timing of the Gu God Sect's actions was truly unfortunate.</p><p>Given more time, Qin Sang could have achieved a comprehensive upgrade: his True Body refining the Demonic Fire, his Avatar achieving a breakthrough, and the Celestial Eye Butterfly advancing – a surge in power!</p><p>Yet, it was stuck at this awkward juncture, the most uncomfortable time.</p><p>Divine abilities couldn't be mastered overnight.</p><p>Qin Sang had to find another way.</p><p>His strength was definitely not weak among cultivators of the same realm, but he wasn't arrogant enough to consider himself invincible.  Against someone like Purple Thunder True Person, the Eight Sceneries Sect Master, Qin Sang had to be cautious.</p><p>After pondering for a long time, Qin Sang suddenly summoned the Sun God Tree.</p><p>The cave dwelling brightened abruptly, filled with fiery light.</p><p>Since advancing to late-Nascent Soul, the True Body had devoted almost all its energy to the *Fire Seed Golden Lotus* technique.  Recently, it had absorbed half of the Near-Dragon Saliva and begun refining the Demonic Fire's essence.  His divine sense had made significant strides.</p><p>Though not yet having broken through, his divine sense was unparalleled among his peers!</p><p>The Sun God Tree floated before Qin Sang, fiery energy flowing between the Sun God Birds.  The birds, with their upturned heads and raised tails, possessed a deceptive cuteness that masked terrifying power.</p><p>Gazing at the birds for a while, Qin Sang made a decision.  Black light flickered between his brows as the Fire Lotus slowly emerged.</p><p>Qin Sang closed his eyes slightly, using only a small portion of his mind to maintain the Fire Lotus, while the majority connected with the Sun God Tree, beginning his experiment.</p><p>Soon, the Fire Lotus stopped rotating. Its petals unfolded, transforming into streams of fire that flowed around the Sun God Tree.</p><p>Simultaneously, Qin Sang's hands moved, forming hundreds of hand seals in an instant. The power of the Fire Lotus cautiously approached the Sun God Birds, moving incredibly slowly.</p><p>Qin Sang had long been able to control three birds at once, but this time he set his sights on six.</p><p>He knew he couldn't do it alone.  Controlling the Sun God Birds through the Fire Lotus was a shortcut, but he wasn't confident.</p><p>The Fire Lotus's power quickly enveloped six birds.</p><p>As Qin Sang's intent arose, popping sounds echoed continuously.  The Fire Lotus's power was dispersed by the Southern Brightly Fire. As expected, it was a bit of a stretch.</p><p>Undeterred, he continued his attempts, his True Essence rapidly depleting.</p><p>Soon, Qin Sang had to stop and meditate to recover.</p><p>There was some progress, but he had to coordinate the Fire Lotus, his divine sense, and his True Essence.  Qin Sang summarized the lessons of his failures while circulating his energy.</p><p>Taking advantage of this interval, Qin Sang retrieved Fatty's poison pearl.</p><p>Sensing Fatty's aura, the Celestial Eye Butterfly flew out of his dantian on its own, landing on Qin Sang's shoulder, nestled close, wings folded, its mood visibly low.</p><p>She and Fatty had never gotten along, constantly at odds.  Now, unable to see each other, she felt a pang of longing.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced down at his waist.</p><p>The Corpse Puppet Pouch was empty.</p><p>Dumb Aunt and Fatty, who had accompanied him for five hundred years, were both gone.</p><p>Fatty might have been lazy, but he was reliable in crucial moments.  Sometimes, Fatty's antics were some of the few lighthearted moments in his solitary journey of cultivation.</p><p>He kept the poison pearl as a memento.</p><p>Qin Sang sighed inwardly, urging his divine sense to probe the pearl. Even Ghost Mother didn't know how to use it, leaving it to Qin Sang to figure out.</p><p>Recalling the scene of Ghost Mother extracting the poison pearl from Fatty, Qin Sang shuddered.</p><p>He wasn't sure if it was due to Fatty's unique bloodline or if it applied to all spirit insects.</p><p>This strengthened Qin Sang's resolve to keep the Celestial Eye Butterfly hidden!</p><p>"Eh?"</p><p>Qin Sang was surprised. When he probed the poison pearl with his divine sense, he sensed a faint, almost nonexistent connection between himself and the pearl.</p><p>How could he have a connection with Fatty's poison pearl?</p><p>Puzzled, Qin Sang carefully sensed again, confirming the connection's existence. It wasn't an illusion!</p><p>"Because of Fatty's final bite?"</p><p>Qin Sang flexed his finger. The wound had long healed.</p><p>After pondering for a moment, Qin Sang suddenly stored the poison pearl in his dantian and continued sensing. The connection became clearer. He could even easily control the pearl without refining it.</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>With a thought, a seven-colored halo erupted from Qin Sang's body, transforming into an armor of light that covered him completely – the incredibly familiar Antidote Armor!</p><p>The Antidote Armor was still usable!</p><p>With the poison pearl separated from Fatty, he wondered if the armor's strength had changed.</p><p>Lost in thought, Qin Sang continued experimenting, eventually discovering that it wasn't that Fatty wasn't putting in effort; it truly only had this one ability.</p><p>"I'll raise some poison-type Gu insects later and see if the poison pearl can still absorb toxins. If it can still grow, it's truly a rare treasure.  Next time I see them, I must thank them properly…"</p><p>The items in his dantian were increasing.</p><p>His Nascent Soul sat cross-legged, the Earth-Slaying Sword resting on its lap.</p><p>The poison pearl hovered before the Nascent Soul's chest, emitting a faint seven-colored glow.</p><p>The Celestial Eye Butterfly returned to the dantian, perching on the Nascent Soul's shoulder, feigning sleep.</p><p>"Like some kind of Treasure-Gathering Daoist!"</p><p>Qin Sang chuckled, dismissing his distracting thoughts and resuming his attempts to control the Sun God Tree.</p><p>The brief distraction had given him new inspiration.</p><p>After repeated adjustments…</p><p>Inside the cave dwelling, Demonic Fire and Southern Brightly Fire flickered alternately, creating a strobe-like effect.</p><p>Suddenly, a glint of joy flashed in Qin Sang's eyes, his expression turning serious as he stared intently at the Sun God Tree.</p><p>The flames on the tree danced erratically, especially around the six birds enveloped by the Fire Lotus's power.  The flames solidified, then the birds trembled in unison!</p><p>At the same moment, Qin Sang's True Essence surged like a bursting dam, pouring out!</p><p>The sheer force of it startled him.</p><p>"Hiss…"</p><p>Qin Sang took a deep breath, astonished.</p><p>An hour later…</p><p>Qin Sang flew out of the cave dwelling, a joyful expression on his face, heading straight south.</p><p>The journey was long.</p><p>Traveling by boat or flying artifact was too slow. Unwilling to conserve True Essence, Qin Sang flew through the air, crossing Zhuozhou, traversing the six states of Jiangzuo, soaring over countless mountains and rivers, barely pausing.</p><p>Mount Tai Sect was within sight.</p><p>…</p><p>East Sea.</p><p>Crimson South Island Chain.</p><p>Once an obscure location, it had gained notoriety over the past century.</p><p>The two appearances of the Unhindered Palace had drawn the attention of countless cultivators, and the various legends were still recounted with relish.</p><p>The period surrounding the first appearance of the Unhindered Palace was the most bustling time for the Crimson South Island Chain.  Factions of all kinds, and reclusive powerhouses, appeared one after another.</p><p>Until Su Zinan reopened the Unhindered Palace, the Crimson South Island Chain reached its peak and began to decline.</p><p>Everyone knew of the Unhindered Palace's existence, a legendary Immortal Palace filled with countless opportunities, but entry was futile.  Even mighty cultivators like Su Zinan could only flee in the face of the Gray Tide; others were essentially courting death.</p><p>With the fervor subsided, most chose to leave.</p><p>The scorching sun blazed overhead.</p><p>Not a cloud in the sky.</p><p>The sea was calm, windless, and sweltering.</p><p>A few treasure ships drifted on the surface, having found nothing. Even the most persistent treasure hunters had grown weary.</p><p>Without warning, a deafening clap of thunder shattered the stillness.</p><p>The cultivators aboard the treasure ships paled, scrambling out of their cabins.  Seeing the sight above, they were both shocked and elated.</p><p>At some point, the sky had darkened, gray winds whipping through the heavens.</p><p>Giant waves surged, tossing the treasure ships violently.</p><p>The onlookers remained transfixed, staring upwards.</p><p>The wind intensified.</p><p>The sun was obscured, the light fading, as wave after wave crashed against the ships, painting a scene of impending doom.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>When darkness completely engulfed the area, booming thunder followed.</p><p>Silver lightning bolts suddenly erupted from the heart of the storm, tearing through the darkness, heralding even more terrifying phenomena.</p><p>In an instant, lightning rained down, terrifyingly powerful, capable of shattering anything in its path!</p><p>Witnessing this, the people on the treasure ships forgot all about treasure hunting, their faces filled with terror.</p><p>Suddenly, someone pointed towards the depths of the lightning storm and cried out.</p><p>"There's someone there!"</p>
