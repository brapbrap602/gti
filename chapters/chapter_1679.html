<h1>Chapter 1670: Tianhao</h1><p>“With a demonic spirit controlling the Five Elements Crown and the Five Elements Divine Restrictions, how have you persisted until now?” Zhu Wudao asked, another question arising in his mind.</p><p>He thought to himself, *no wonder*. The mental messages from Mozi had been fragmented and muddled, his responses slow and strained, clearly indicating a precarious situation.  It turned out Mozi had stirred up trouble and was currently battling the demonic spirit of the Five Elements Crown.</p><p>Once a spiritual treasure gives birth to a tool spirit, it undergoes a transformation.</p><p>This is reflected in the seal on Emperor Bestowal Mountain.</p><p>With a master, the seal can unify the power of the Five Elements Crown and the Five Elements Divine Restrictions, unleashing its full suppressive might. This, however, allows the demonic spirit to devour Mozi.</p><p>Moreover, Mozi, having been sealed for so long, was at the end of his tether.</p><p>Given these circumstances, Zhu Wudao marveled that Mozi could still resist.</p><p>“The demonic spirit, not a true tool spirit, is inherently incompatible with its host. Furthermore, due to the interruption of my refinement process, its true nature is incomplete and thus restricted.  Its control over the Five Elements Crown is hampered, and this extends to the Five Elements Divine Restrictions. It cannot fully wield their power, granting me a chance to breathe.”</p><p>Mozi's response remained fragmented, but comprehensible nonetheless.</p><p>Since their initial contact, their communication had always been this way. Zhu Wudao had grown accustomed to piecing together the fragmented messages to grasp the general meaning.</p><p>No wonder Mozi called the demonic spirit an abomination.</p><p>The demonic spirit’s genesis was half the Five Elements Crown’s innate spirituality, half Mozi's demonic nature. It wasn't a pure tool spirit, yet it possessed sentience.</p><p>Thinking about this, Zhu Wudao found it increasingly bizarre.  He never imagined a tool spirit could devour its master.  The Five Elements Crown’s spirituality had been tainted…  Mozi could be considered half its master, couldn't he?</p><p>Regarding this, Mozi was surprisingly calm.  “All things possess a spirit, and all spirits aspire to transcend. Unless constantly refined and kept close at hand, forming an intimate bond, who would willingly endure bondage and servitude? A tool spirit devouring its master is nothing strange.  Moreover, separated by layers of seals, it was already difficult for me to taint the treasure’s spirituality.  I had no power to further restrict it…”</p><p>“Where is the demonic spirit now?” Zhu Wudao asked warily, glancing around. Recalling Mozi’s previous actions, he had a vague suspicion.</p><p>“Unable to suppress me directly, it sought an alternative path. Its sentience was born from demonic taint; its roots are demonic. It acts no differently than we do. Leaving its host, it likely intends to devour a few cultivators before returning to consume me and complete its true nature.”</p><p>“So it was the one causing all the chaos!”</p><p>Zhu Wudao finally understood why Su Zinan and the others hadn't caught up.  He finally grasped the deeper meaning behind Mozi's actions.</p><p>Upon establishing contact, Mozi had sent him a simple thought, instructing him to shatter the jade pavilion, offering no further explanation.</p><p>This served to disrupt the Five Elements Divine Restrictions.</p><p>Of course, compared to the entire seal, this disruption was insufficient to free Mozi. He still needed Zhu Wudao to bring the divine statue up the mountain.</p><p>This led to the second purpose: allowing others to enter the mountain, attracting the demonic spirit and confusing its judgment, so that Zhu Wudao could act discreetly without arousing its suspicion.</p><p>This approach had both advantages and disadvantages. Zhu Wudao had been transported to the entrance hall, encountering two Daoist Real Masters and being pursued. Fortunately, through shrewd maneuvering and alliances, he had managed to succeed.</p><p>Only after the demonic spirit had been lured away did Mozi dare to communicate with him more extensively.</p><p>Zhu Wudao’s activation of the wind formation had served as a cover for the demonic spirit's movements.  While the demonic spirit was distracted, Mozi, channeling power through the divine statue, concealed Zhu Wudao's aura, deceiving everyone.</p><p>No wonder Mozi had been so insistent and urgent.  The demonic spirit was unaware of their connection.  If discovered, it would return to its host, severing their link and potentially foiling their plan.</p><p>“Heh… Those old fellows are not easily trifled with.”</p><p>Having learned of the demonic spirit’s origins and abilities, and knowing the Five Elements Crown was locked in a stalemate with Mozi, with the demonic spirit merely a sliver of its essence, Zhu Wudao almost laughed.  He didn’t think highly of the demonic spirit’s chances, even with its limited control over the Five Elements Divine Restrictions.</p><p>Those he had lured onto the mountain were cunning and ruthless, some even beyond his comprehension.</p><p>The demonic spirit, while possessing demonic nature, had been confined within the mountain since its birth, untouched by the world. In his eyes, it was more brutal than cunning, almost naive.</p><p>Daring to scheme against those seasoned cultivators, it would likely lose its teeth before it could bite.</p><p>The demonic spirit's opportunity to devour spirits would come only when weaker cultivators ascended the mountain.  Fortunately, the Cloud Dragon Bridge outside the mountain gate had collapsed, preventing others from arriving.  Otherwise, things would truly be difficult to manage today.</p><p>Lost in thought, Zhu Wudao suddenly remembered something and asked with concern, "Aren't you afraid the demonic spirit will actively seek a new master?"</p><p>The demonic spirit was in a peculiar state, inherently discordant with its host. But having a master would change everything.  With the demonic spirit's cooperation, even through the simplest Treasure Binding Art, a master could unify the demonic spirit and the Five Elements Crown, masking their incompatibility and unleashing the crown's true power.</p><p>With a master's aid, gradually, over time, the demonic spirit could achieve perfect harmony with the Five Elements Crown, overcome the Spirit Shaping Tribulation, and become a true tool spirit.</p><p>The difficulty in a tool spirit’s development lay in the process of creation from nothingness.</p><p>From a magical treasure developing spirituality, to that spirituality giving birth to a tool spirit, each step presented a formidable hurdle. Ninety-nine percent of magical and spiritual treasures stalled at this stage.</p><p>Throughout countless years, numerous Nascent Soul cultivators had ascended from the Middle Continent, yet even with their closest companion treasures, none had been known to truly give birth to a tool spirit.</p><p>Mozi gave a dark chuckle.  "Did you forget what I just said?  The demonic spirit was born from the spirituality of the Five Elements Crown.  As a spiritual treasure, it has changed masters countless times, controlled and manipulated through the Treasure Binding Art time and again. That imprint is deeply etched into its being, impossible to erase. It can never accept a master!"</p><p>Zhu Wudao, lacking understanding of a tool spirit's thoughts and feelings, found it hard to empathize.  But Mozi's confident tone suggested it was true.</p><p>He wanted to ask more, but the divine statue pulsed with impatient thoughts, urging him to hasten his pace.</p><p>Sensing Mozi's growing agitation, a hair-trigger temper, Zhu Wudao wisely closed his mouth, daring not to inquire further.</p><p>Within Emperor Bestowal Mountain, while others remained oblivious, a shadow perfectly concealed within the wind煞 swiftly traversed the mountain, heading straight for the summit.</p><p>Even the swirling wind煞 couldn't obscure the breathtaking wonders of Emperor Bestowal Mountain.</p><p>Every few steps, Zhu Wudao encountered a different vista, a true immortal paradise.  If not for the urgency of the situation, he would have lingered to appreciate the scenery.</p><p>After rushing for an unknown distance, a canopy of azure clouds appeared before him.</p><p>Zhu Wudao abruptly stopped.  According to his knowledge, the Wordless Jade Tablet was located here!</p><p>Beneath the azure clouds lay a valley, not particularly deep, sealed by a cloud-shaped restriction. The surging spiritual energy within was palpable, a place of profound spiritual abundance.</p><p>Here, the spiritual energy was almost tangible. It was difficult to say whether the azure clouds were a restriction, a manifestation of the dense spiritual energy, or both.</p><p>A faint, pure light emanated from the depths of the valley, where a mirror-like cliff face, resembling jade, rose over thirty feet high, almost perfectly square, devoid of any inscriptions.  This was the Wordless Jade Tablet.</p><p>Its surface was crystalline, with ripples like water, reflecting the valley's beauty.</p><p>Before the Wordless Jade Tablet were several meditation cushions, woven from calming spiritual herbs.  Long untended, they had lost their luster, adding a touch of desolation to the scene.</p><p>Zhu Wudao took a long look at the valley but didn't linger.</p><p>Beyond the Wordless Jade Tablet, the summit was not far.</p><p>Following Mozi's guidance, Zhu Wudao bypassed a magnificent hall and finally reached the summit. Looking down, he discovered that the mountain's interior was hollow.</p><p>The light within was dim, shrouded in a grayish mist.  Deep within, lights of other colors flickered faintly.</p><p>Without hesitation, he leaped into the mountain’s hollow, plunging into the grayish mist.  A sense of oppression washed over him, and he instinctively adjusted his posture.</p><p>He hadn't descended far when the lights below became clearer.</p><p>They were five colors, similar to the clouds outside.</p><p>Zhu Wudao’s heart stirred.  He realized this was the convergence point of the Five Elements Divine Restrictions.  The Five Elements Crown, as the core of the seal, controlling the divine restrictions, must be located here.</p><p>Correspondingly, Mozi was also imprisoned here.</p><p>As expected, Zhu Wudao soon saw a mass of five-colored clouds, or rather, a barrier formed by multicolored light.  But it was so dense that he couldn't see through it.</p><p>This was the manifestation of the sealing power.</p><p>It was clear that the seal was primarily focused inwards, preventing Mozi's escape.  Presumably, the sages of the Formless Immortal Sect, believing the demonic tribulation extinguished and the seal securely within Emperor Bestowal Mountain, at the heart of their sect, hadn't anticipated any problems and hadn't implemented further measures.</p><p>Within the barrier, five-colored light flowed continuously, incredibly solid. Before Zhu Wudao could steady himself, he received a thought from the divine statue, "Set up the formation here."</p><p>Mozi's thoughts were laced with fatigue, but even more so, with excitement.</p><p>Zhu Wudao gave a slight nod, looked around, and flew to the side of the cavern, landing on a protruding rock and sitting down cross-legged.</p><p>He didn't rush to take out the divine statue.</p><p>His fingers flickered, sending out a series of runes that landed on the surface of the multicolored light.  As the runes connected, forming a screen of subtle energy, seemingly searching for weaknesses in the seal, he was, in reality, preparing for the next step.</p><p>The divine statue was originally intended for rescuing the Holy Monarch; using it here was overkill.</p><p>Serving as both a conduit between the inside and outside, and a vessel for Mozi's essence, the statue allowed them to bypass brute force and subtly widen the passage using the power of the blood sacrifice, enabling Mozi to transfer his spirit into the statue and escape.</p><p>If handled properly, they could completely conceal their actions from the demonic spirit.  Once the ritual reached a certain point, even if the demonic spirit returned, it would be too late to stop them.</p><p>Simultaneously, Zhu Wudao's mind touched a spark of light within the statue, transmitting a signal.</p><p>Outside the Formless Immortal Sect.</p><p>In the Southern Barbarian Two States.</p><p>The presiding priests of the blood sacrifice had long been waiting impatiently. With the divine statue linking the inside and outside, they could sense Zhu Wudao's actions and proceed with the final stage of the ritual.</p><p>Lord Envoy had given them an approximate time before his departure, but it had long passed with no sign of activity.</p><p>The blood sacrifice had caused too much commotion. Although limited to mortals and low-level cultivators, their network spanned the two states, covering a vast area.  So many deaths occurring simultaneously, and in such a bizarre manner, were bound to arouse suspicion.</p><p>If not for the emergence of the Formless Immortal Sect and the ancestral grounds captivating the attention of the cultivators in the Southern Barbarian Two States, their scheme would have already been exposed, with sects investigating and pursuing them.</p><p>Even so, seventy to eighty percent of their efforts to mislead and conceal had been unravelled.  Exposure was inevitable.</p><p>Just as they were consumed by anxiety, they finally received the signal. Overjoyed, they prostrated themselves, chanting the Holy Monarch's name, their faces filled with fanaticism and excitement.</p><p>Of course, they didn't forget their duties.</p><p>The divine statue returned to its place!</p><p>Unseen, the grand blood sacrifice formation laid out over generations by the Quyang Mountain lineage, encompassing the Southern Barbarian Two States, finally took shape!</p><p>Despite being thousands of miles apart, the blood-soaked divine statues seemed to respond to a simultaneous summons, their eerie blood-red eyes snapping open. A strange energy flowed along their gaze, converging upon the divine statue held by the presiding priest, and then transmitted to Mount Taiyue!</p><p>Within his sleeve, the divine statue glowed crimson, burning hotter than before, emitting a strange pulse that assaulted Zhu Wudao's mind.</p><p>He struggled to suppress the statue's fluctuations, lest the demonic spirit detect them, his movements growing increasingly swift.</p><p>The formation was nearing completion.</p><p>Zhu Wudao seemed to sense something, his brow furrowing.  He looked up sharply to see a bright moon hanging above the grayish mist.</p><p>This was no moon, but an ancient mirror.  Had Qin Sang been present, he would have recognized the mirror's shape as identical to the Tianhao Tower's treasure ship.</p><p>"The Tianhao Ancient Mirror!"</p><p>Zhu Wudao's face paled. "You dare bring this treasure out of the sect!"</p><p>On Emperor Bestowal Mountain, only one person could control the Tianhao Ancient Mirror:  Old Devil Fan!</p><p>The Tianhao Ancient Mirror, the sect-protecting treasure of Tianhao Tower.</p><p>This treasure was the cornerstone of Tianhao Tower’s fortune, left behind by their founding ancestor, placed at the center of their protective formation since the sect's establishment.</p><p>Every member of the sect’s upper echelon knew that no one could, or dared to, remove this treasure from the sect.  Even Quyang Mountain, despite their long-held schemes, hadn’t dared to target the Tianhao Ancient Mirror.</p><p>Old Devil Fan had gone mad, daring to steal the Tianhao Ancient Mirror.</p><p>Even if he was mad, Sect Master Yu wouldn’t join his madness.</p><p>“Merely a Mirror Talisman! The sect has spent years and countless resources to refine these Mirror Talismans, with a pitifully low success rate.  I never imagined its first use would be against a fellow disciple. Still, although precious, how else would I know of my Junior Brother's machinations without using it?"</p><p>After Zhu Wudao disappeared, Old Devil Fan hadn't moved far.</p><p>He sat cross-legged, hands resting on his knees, a sphere of white light floating before him. Within the white light, the form of an ancient mirror could be seen, but it appeared ethereal, not solid.</p><p>Old Devil Fan spoke, but no sound emerged. His voice was transmitted into the cavern through the ancient mirror.</p><p>Before Zhu Wudao could respond,</p><p>The ancient mirror tilted slightly, shining upon the five-colored seal.</p><p>“So this is where that Prime Spiritual Treasure is kept?  Did my Junior Brother think I was unaware of the Wordless Jade Tablet’s secrets, hoping to use a worthless trinket to make me do your bidding?”</p><p>At this moment, Zhu Wudao could only be thankful he hadn't yet taken out the divine statue.  Old Devil Fan believed he was after the spiritual treasure.</p><p>Quickly composing himself, Zhu Wudao clutched his sleeve and feigned composure, saying in a deep voice, "Even if Senior Brother forcibly takes the treasure, without the Treasure Binding Art, how will you control it?  Why not listen to Junior Brother's suggestion…”</p><p>Before he could finish, Old Devil Fan interrupted him with a shout, saying leisurely, "What need is there for the Treasure Binding Art?  Just by observing the arrangement of the Five Elements Divine Restrictions, one can tell this treasure is related to the Five Elements. The method to control it must lie within the Five Elements Restrictions outside.  No wonder the records state that in the past, whenever the Formless Immortal Sect used this treasure, it was always accompanied by a grand formation and immense power!"</p><p>Zhu Wudao's expression changed, still wanting to argue.</p><p>Old Devil Fan suddenly let out a soft gasp, and the ancient mirror vanished.</p><p>The next moment,</p><p>The gray mist trembled, and a rainbow bridge descended directly into the mountain’s hollow!</p>
