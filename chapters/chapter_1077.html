<h1>Chapter 169: Different Intentions</h1><p>“You think the Ancient Demon isn't strong enough? That's because the seal on him hasn't been fully broken! Do you know how many human cultivators he slaughtered when he first appeared?!” the old man roared.</p><p>“Friend, calm down. We didn't expect the Ancient Demon to be sealed here. The East Peak Alliance Leader was beguiled by the demon, helped him escape, and even offered him a physical body…” The West Unying Alliance Leader glanced at the Demon Lord and secretly explained to the old man via voice transmission, “The Ancient Demon breaking free is a foregone conclusion; our suicide wouldn't change anything.  As a descendant of the Four Sages, do you know how to subdue this demon?”</p><p>The Ancient Demon’s demonic aura surged. </p><p>Both she and the Demon Lord were trapped within the True Demonic Qi, with the East Peak Alliance Leader assisting from the side.</p><p>The situation was dire.</p><p>The Demon Lord snorted, “No matter how much carnage the Ancient Demon caused before, after being sealed for so many years, how much power can he possibly have left? Enough talk, do you have a solution or not?!”</p><p>“Fortunately, you weren't foolish enough to completely undo his seal. The Four Ancestors left behind arrangements to prevent the Ancient Demon's return…” the old man quickly transmitted, his tone anxious.</p><p>“What arrangements did the Four Sages make?” The West Unying Alliance Leader’s eyes lit up.</p><p>The Ancient Demon's power was gradually returning. They could still resist now, but once the demon completely broke free from the seal, their fate would be uncertain.</p><p>“I have a way to temporarily suppress the Ancient Demon and then repair the seal. However, it takes time to complete the setup, and the demon will surely notice. You must keep him occupied. The seal on him is weakening; if we wait any longer, it will be too late…” the old man urged.  Instead of appearing to help the two, he stealthily approached the edge of the ravine, hiding in the shadows, and looked at the stone stele in the center.</p><p>As the old man said, the chain marks on the Ancient Demon's body were slowly fading. Once the marks disappeared completely, his demonic might would return to the world.</p><p>The Demon Lord and the West Unying Alliance Leader stood close together, resisting the attacks from the Ancient Demon and the East Peak Alliance Leader.</p><p>One side waxed while the other waned; the situation was critical.</p><p>Finally, the sound of something tearing through the air came from above the ravine. The old man’s figure flashed, appearing above the ravine.  He pressed his palm downwards, sending a beam of cyan light towards the stele.</p><p>The jade stele activated, becoming half a person tall and crystalline.</p><p>Within the ravine, the Ancient Demon abruptly looked up, staring fixedly at the jade stele with a crazed look in his eyes.  He chose to abandon the Demon Lord and the Alliance Leader, rushing towards the old man with reckless abandon.</p><p>“Quickly! Stop him!”  The old man manipulated the jade stele, shouting urgently.</p><p>The Demon Lord and the West Unying Alliance Leader exchanged a glance and attacked with all their might.</p><p>The East Peak Alliance Leader, receiving the Ancient Demon's command, was about to recall his spiritual sword and use the sword array to attack the old man when a cold light flew towards him. Invisible waves rippled, completely enveloping the sword.</p><p>The sword hummed like thunder, its light flaring, but it couldn't break free from the entanglement for the moment.</p><p>The West Unying Alliance Leader switched from defense to offense, holding back her former friend.</p><p>The Demon Lord opened his mouth and spat out a ball of yellow light, which contained a dull yellow stone knife.</p><p>The stone knife's surface was rough, as if it had been casually ground from a stone. Its blade was chipped, the handle missing, and the edge notched.</p><p>The stone knife appeared, hovering in front of the Demon Lord, emanating no powerful aura, appearing utterly ordinary.</p><p>Then, the Taiyin Heavenly Ghost Divine Light erupted, like water drawn from the Yellow Springs.  Evil ghosts floated within, emitting painful and frenzied roars, making one's scalp tingle.</p><p>The divine light didn't shoot towards the Ancient Demon but towards the stone knife.</p><p>The stone knife trembled slightly, and an immense suction force emerged from within, swallowing the Taiyin Heavenly Ghost Divine Light completely.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>The yellow light was blinding.</p><p>The stone knife transformed into a bloodthirsty demonic blade, exuding a sense of craving, eerily enchanting.</p><p>*Hum!*</p><p>The stone knife vibrated repeatedly, then suddenly flicked its blade.</p><p>The yellow light flashed and vanished, leaving only an afterimage of the stone knife. In an instant, the actual knife appeared behind the Ancient Demon's heart, aiming for a vital spot.</p><p>A gust of wind blew.</p><p>A premonition of danger surged within the Ancient Demon.</p><p>This attack was no small matter; the Demon Lord had planned it for a long time.</p><p>The moment he sensed the stone knife's aura, the essence blood within this physical body, as well as the Ancient Demon's demonic soul, felt a tug.</p><p>If struck by the stone knife, even someone as powerful as the Ancient Demon would have the vital essence of their physical body devoured.</p><p>The stone knife had a significant origin.  Current cultivators couldn't refine such a treasure.  It was an ancient evil cultivator's treasure that the Demon Lord had obtained from a secret realm within the inner hall.</p><p>The Ancient Demon formed hand seals, and rolling demonic qi transformed into layers of curtains, pressing down on the stone knife. Yet, his own speed didn't decrease.</p><p>Just then, the Ancient Demon suddenly felt something amiss.</p><p>After leaving the stele and completely occupying the physical body, he had been relentlessly assaulting the seal, and the chain marks on his face had been gradually fading, especially after devouring a Nascent Soul cultivator, they had become even fainter.</p><p>At this moment, for some reason, the chain marks deepened, and hair-thin lightning appeared.</p><p>Simultaneously, within the entire sealing formation, a spirit talisman rose from some of the sacrificial altars, including one main altar.</p><p>Around those auxiliary altars were cultivators, all confidants of the West Unying Alliance Leader and the Demon Lord, quickly forming hand seals and activating the spirit talismans.</p><p>An inexplicable wave traced back to the seal, and the spirit talismans instantly shattered, revealing a power similar to the Demonic煞 True Spirit Talisman, though far less potent.</p><p>But after this power appeared, the Demonic煞 True Spirit Talisman's power was affected.</p><p>The Thunder Chains, which had been dimmed and suppressed, now had a chance to recover.  Although they still couldn't contend with the Demonic煞 True Spirit Talisman, they could hold on for a while longer, and even counterattack.</p><p>The Thunder Chains unleashed their power, and the Ancient Demon groaned, his True Demonic Qi wavering.</p><p>“It was you!” the Ancient Demon instantly understood, roaring in fury.</p><p>“I've studied talisman formations for hundreds of years, all thanks to you!” The West Unying Alliance Leader gritted her teeth.</p><p>She was quite talented in the way of spirit talismans.</p><p>The Demonic煞 True Spirit Talisman and formations that the Ancient Demon had imparted to them were incredibly profound. Nascent Soul cultivators couldn't comprehend them, but the West Unying Alliance Leader had managed to discern some patterns.</p><p>Unfortunately, she could only influence one main altar and had to send people to the corresponding auxiliary altars to help activate the spirit talismans.</p><p>She was far inferior to the Ancient Demon, who could single-handedly access the formation and impact the entire seal.</p><p>The Ancient Demon’s aura fluctuated, his True Demonic Qi stagnating.</p><p>The stone knife seized the opportunity, breaking free from the curtain and forcing the Ancient Demon back.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>The jade stele slammed down.</p><p>A sudden change occurred!</p><p>The void behind the old man distorted, and a figure silently materialized.  Two cold gazes locked onto the old man.  Hand seals were formed, and a fire lotus was shot towards the old man’s back with lightning speed!</p><p>At the same time, the Demon Lord’s figure flickered, his target unexpectedly the jade stele!</p><p>The one who ambushed the old man was the Mou Patriarch, who had been lying in wait.</p><p>Caught off guard, the old man instantly understood, filled with shock and rage.</p><p>The Demon Lord's true intention was to lure out a descendant of the Four Sages with the Ancient Demon and seize the Demon Subduing Stele!</p><p>“The Four Sages once obtained a treasure surpassing even spirit treasures in the Seven Kill Hall.  Later, internal strife erupted within the Four Sages Palace, causing its decline and retreat from the world.  But the treasure vanished.  Is this it?”  The Demon Lord’s eyes burned with fervor.</p><p>As he had predicted, the Ancient Demon, sealed for many years, was greatly weakened.</p><p>As long as he obtained the Demon Subduing Stele, even if the Ancient Demon broke free, he wouldn’t need to worry too much.</p><p>The old man was unaware that he had already set up a Demon Slaying Formation outside the Spirit Suppression Domain.</p><p>--</p><p>--</p><p>This makes up for yesterday's chapter.  Today's chapter will be coming soon.</p>
