<h1>Chapter 1475: An Audience with the Palace Mistress</h1><p>“What if the treasure isn't where it's supposed to be? How will I find it?”</p><p>Qin Sang quickly scanned the contents of the jade slip.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, the restrictions surrounding the Cleansing Pool weren't static. Each sect guarded its own secrets, making it impossible to understand all the patterns of the restrictions.  More often than not, improvisation was necessary.</p><p>He worried that the restrictions inside the Cleansing Pool might also have changed, causing the treasure to be moved elsewhere.</p><p>Furthermore, forcibly entering the bottom of the Cleansing Pool could lead to unpredictable consequences.</p><p>Bing Yao lacked the strength back then and knew little about the bottom of the Cleansing Pool.  Based solely on the information in the jade slip, Qin Sang couldn't make an accurate judgment.</p><p>His cultivation method differed from that of Master Liuli and her disciple; he couldn't sense the treasure's aura.</p><p>The Ice Soul Divine Light, sealed by Liuli within the spirit talisman, was inanimate and could only be used to pry the treasure loose.</p><p>The space at the bottom of the Cleansing Pool was indeed small, but ancient restrictions were layered heavily.</p><p>Once the time was up, the Cleansing Pool would automatically close, generating a repulsive force. Even with the Sky Eye Butterfly's assistance, Qin Sang wouldn't be able to search every inch of it.</p><p>“There shouldn't be anything else at the bottom of the Cleansing Pool…”</p><p>Liuli's brow furrowed slightly. After a moment of thought, she revealed another secret.</p><p>“Master sensed a familiar aura at the bottom of the Cleansing Pool, very similar to another forbidden area in the Sacred Land, the Gluttonous Lake. She suspected a connection between the restrictions of the two places.”</p><p>“However, even if the two places are connected, it would require extremely high cultivation to influence the Cleansing Pool from the outside.”</p><p>“Master's original plan was to wait until she was strong enough to cooperate with a disciple entering the Cleansing Pool, working together inside and out to obtain the treasure. Unfortunately, shortly after leaving the Sacred Land that time, Master left Xuan Tian Palace and didn't have the chance to come back.”</p><p>“At that time, I will enter the Gluttonous Lake simultaneously and trigger the restrictions at the bottom of the lake. But my cultivation is insufficient; I doubt I can be of much help.”</p><p>Mentioning her Master, a hint of sadness flickered across Liuli's expression. She briefly explained, “Master once said that with this treasure, the perfected Ice Soul Divine Light could be refined again, leading to extraordinary changes.  It could have been used to save Master, but now it's no longer needed. For me, the more important thing is to seize the opportunity of refining this treasure to once again break through my bottleneck.”</p><p>Liuli hadn't ignored the possibility of failure in her breakthrough and had a backup plan. She was confident she could convince Qin Sang to use this opportunity to enter the Cleansing Pool.</p><p>As long as she got past this hurdle, she could deal with the evil skill's imprint later.</p><p>Qin Sang understood, secretly thinking, “So that's it.”</p><p>Looking at Liuli, Qin Sang found himself reminded of his own situation.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang finally discovered a common ground between him and Liuli.</p><p>Their beliefs were different, and their choices differed, but they shared similar experiences.</p><p>Qin Sang had also been plagued by the hidden dangers of an evil skill, persistently searching for a solution, never giving up, and eventually reaching where he is today.</p><p>Now, Liuli was doing the same.</p><p>Only by taking one step at a time, overcoming numerous difficulties, would the clouds eventually part and the sun shine through.</p><p>“Regardless of the outcome, it's always better to have a backup plan,” Qin Sang said, and immediately began discussing the details of the operation with Liuli.</p><p>Before long,</p><p>Qin Sang and Liuli left the cave dwelling together, heading towards the main peak.</p><p>Shi Xue was in the headmaster's hall, listlessly dealing with mundane matters. Seeing the two figures appear at the entrance, she immediately put down the jade slip in her hand, stood up, and asked repeatedly, “Have you reached an agreement?”</p><p>Qin Sang and Liuli nodded in unison.</p><p>Shi Xue looked back and forth between the two, a smile playing on her lips, “Truly a match made in heaven!  Alright, no more jokes. I'll draft a notice and have it sent to Lingxiao Peak and the various sects.  With the demons attacking the border and the current unrest, we'll forgo the formalities.  Please let Palace Master Jiang choose an auspicious day for the wedding. When the wedding day arrives, we will invite all the sects to observe the ceremony…”</p><p>She understood that Qin Sang and Liuli were just going through the motions, not truly becoming a couple.</p><p>Things like the betrothal gifts and formal engagement could be omitted; everything would be simple.</p><p>However, some necessary rituals still needed to be performed.</p><p>Liuli was the closed-door disciple of the previous head of the Listening Snow Tower and the junior sister of the current headmaster. The ceremony would have to be grand to avoid damaging the reputation of the Listening Snow Tower.</p><p>Essentially, cultivators were no different from ordinary people.</p><p>Shi Xue had already planned this, and the disciples of the Listening Snow Tower would take care of the arrangements, leaving Qin Sang and Liuli free from worry.</p><p>Listening to Shi Xue's rambling, Qin Sang felt a sense of unreality. Since he devoted himself to the immortal path, he never imagined he would have a wedding day, and such a complicated one at that.</p><p>Given his temperament, even if he truly wanted to become a couple with a fellow cultivator, he wouldn't make such a fuss.  At most, he would set up a memorial tablet in his cave dwelling and pay respects to his parents in his past life as a form of comfort.</p><p>Shi Xue was very enthusiastic about this matter, becoming more and more excited with every detail.  Suddenly, she remembered something. "Almost forgot! Before the ceremony, you need to go to Lingxiao Peak to pay your respects to the Palace Master and the Grand Elder.  Especially Daochang, not originally a disciple of Xuantian Palace, this courtesy cannot be omitted. The sooner the better."</p><p>A worried look flashed across her face. "The Palace Master's eyes are like torches. Are you sure you can hide it from him?"</p><p>Cultivators forming a Dao companion pair must be like-minded, their Dao rhymes harmonizing; it's not like ordinary people, where a wedding ceremony makes them husband and wife.</p><p>Qin Sang and Liuli exchanged a glance. "It should be alright."</p><p>"That's good."</p><p>Shi Xue didn't press further, choosing to believe them. "Wait a moment, I'll write a letter for you to take to Yuanji Palace and give to Jiang Dianzhu. Daochang should also meet Jiang Shibo."</p><p>Next, Shi Xue struck the ancient bell, ordering disciples from all peaks to prepare for the public announcement of Qin Sang's appointment as Guest Elder and this happy event.</p><p>The bell rang, and figures flew out from each peak.</p><p>From top to bottom of Tingxue Tower, including two Yuan Ying cultivators who had just returned from the battlefield and were recuperating in the mountains,  gradually gathered on the main peak.</p><p>While Qin Sang and Liuli waited in the hall...</p><p>Liuli gazed towards Lingxiao Peak, hesitated, and transmitted a message: "Be careful of the Palace Master."</p><p>"Hm?"</p><p>Qin Sang's expression suddenly froze, staring intently at Liuli with a scrutinizing gaze.</p><p>Liuli remained silent, then said: "Before I left, Master warned me. She said she always felt an inexplicable palpitation when facing the Palace Master.  Many years ago, shortly after leaving the sacred land, Master left Xuantian Palace alone. While traveling, she encountered a great opportunity, discovered Bing Po Gang Ying, and quickly broke through to the late Yuan Ying stage. But instead of returning to Xuantian Palace, she went through the storm belt to Beichen Realm. When trapped in Ziwei Palace, Master forbade me from asking the Palace Master for help."</p><p>"Why?"</p><p>Qin Sang said in a low voice.</p><p>Liuli's eyes showed confusion. "Perhaps Master didn't know herself; it was just a feeling.  Cultivating Bing Po divine light makes one's spiritual perception clearer than ordinary people. She only said that if I returned to the sect and the Palace Master was still alive, I should stay away from him as much as possible, and avoid being alone with him."</p><p>Qin Sang frowned, pondering for a long time, then looked up and asked: "I heard that Yin Changsheng is from the era before the Hun Mo Old Man."</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>Liuli nodded.</p><p>——</p><p>——</p><p>I had an urgent matter last night and was completely swamped, only finishing it up at noon.</p><p>After writing this note, I was interrupted by a phone call, and just now I realized I forgot to post it!  I'm truly sorry.</p><p>Here's a chapter to make up for it. I'll have something to eat and get back to writing.</p>
