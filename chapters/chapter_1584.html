<h1>Chapter 1575: A Desperate Gambit</h1><p>Demonic banners swirled around him, demonic fire danced like dragons.</p><p>Qin Sang's cultivation had greatly advanced, and the demonic fire he commanded was now far more numerous.</p><p>The sheer power of the demonic fire, as soon as it appeared, made Wu Lao's face drain of color. He abruptly halted, keeping his distance from Qin Sang, as if facing a formidable foe.</p><p>Demonic flames billowed.</p><p>The furious ice storm, compared to the demonic fire, seemed tame, its domain forcibly pushed back.</p><p>Wu Lao's pupils constricted. The danger he sensed from the demonic fire actually surpassed that of the sword formation from moments ago. He hurriedly raised his Blood-Drinking Demonic Halberd in front of him.</p><p>"What kind of spirit fire is this? So bizarre! When did such a master appear in the Central Continent? This person's sword formation and spirit fire aren't of the righteous path, and even those demonic sects don't possess such a strange demonic fire legacy... It's said that the Supreme Yang Flame Arts inherited by the Fire Aspect lineage of the Formless Immortal Sect isn't quite like this either..."</p><p>Though Lu Ye remained secluded from the world, due to his ability to move freely around the Northern Wastelands, he wasn't cut off from information. Wu Lao had heard of most of the renowned masters of the current generation's major sects.</p><p>Yet, Qin Sang was completely unfamiliar to him; he'd never heard of such a person.</p><p>Despite the discrepancies with the legacy of the Fire Aspect lineage, this person's current appearance near the suspected tomb of the Water Aspect's master, alongside someone who resembled a Water Aspect inheritor, made it hard not to draw connections.</p><p>Wu Lao thought to himself, he had assumed the Formless Immortal Sect had long since declined, but now it seemed their legacy hadn't been extinguished and they still possessed many top-tier masters.</p><p>The cultivation world had always concealed a powerful force, only they weren't a match for the Eight Sceneries Palace and the Sweet Dew Zen Monastery, thus they could only hide in the shadows.</p><p>Now, with the Nascent Soul cultivators gone, they dared to emerge and stir up trouble.</p><p>Wu Lao mistakenly associated Qin Sang with the Formless Immortal Sect, unaware they were worlds apart.</p><p>These thoughts flashed through his mind in an instant, and Wu Lao saw black fire filling the sky ahead. The Nine Nether Demonic Fire surged in waves, decaying and shattering everything in its path as it broke through the ice storm and swept towards him.</p><p>Wu Lao instinctively swung his halberd forward, slashing out a blood-colored halberd shadow.</p><p>The Blood-Drinking Demonic Halberd had been refined by Wu Lao for many years, long surpassing the level of a regular magical treasure. Even a casual strike from it would send others scrambling.</p><p>Moreover, this was no ordinary halberd shadow.</p><p>Having witnessed the Seven Souls Killing Formation, Wu Lao didn't dare underestimate Qin Sang in the slightest. Even if he was merely testing the power of the demonic fire, he held nothing back.</p><p>The halberd shadow transformed into a blood-colored long halberd.</p><p>Bloodlight blazed.</p><p>The surrounding ice storm was dyed crimson, becoming a blood storm that clashed head-on with the black spirit fire opposite, its eeriness surpassing even the Nine Nether Demonic Fire.</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>The halberd shadow's momentum was earth-shattering, leaving a long, blood-colored scar between Qin Sang and Wu Lao, as if splitting the void itself.</p><p>Facing such a terrifying attack, Qin Sang remained unmoved.</p><p>Under his control, the Nine Nether Demonic Fire showed no signs of slowing down, transforming into a fiery dragon that, as if seeking its own demise, slammed headfirst into the halberd shadow.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang's apparent arrogance, Wu Lao's heart leaped with joy, but his elation was short-lived.</p><p>The halberd shadow pierced the fire, and a blood-colored long halberd could be seen within the fiery dragon's body, advancing unstoppably, dissolving the demonic fire in its path. But this didn't last long. As the halberd shadow charged forward, it rapidly shrank, and in the blink of an eye, the bloodlight vanished completely, annihilated within the demonic fire.</p><p>This halberd shadow held hidden mysteries, but it couldn't break through the demonic fire and reach Qin Sang. It dissipated before it could take effect.</p><p>Qin Sang had absolute confidence in his demonic fire. He remained suspended in mid-air, not moving an inch, focusing solely on controlling the demonic fire.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>The demonic fire dragon, having swallowed the halberd shadow, swooped down!</p><p>Wu Lao glanced towards the depths of the ice storm.</p><p>He could faintly sense a battle taking place within. Yue Fei wasn't dead yet, perhaps even holding the upper hand, and there might still be a chance to seize the treasure. Unfortunately, within the ice storm, he couldn't transmit a message to his Young Master.</p><p>His gaze darkened as he repeated his previous tactic.</p><p>The Blood-Drinking Demonic Halberd hummed and vibrated, springing upwards as the Heaven-Stabilizing Halberd reappeared!</p><p>Thousands of halberd shadows!</p><p>Qin Sang was already aware of the Heaven-Stabilizing Halberd's power. Seeing this, his hand seals abruptly changed. The demonic fire swiftly converged towards the central fire lotus, and the demonic fire dragon, instead of slowing down, accelerated, fiercely crashing into the halberd shadows!</p><p>A deafening 'Boom!' resounded.</p><p>Both Qin Sang and Wu Lao were shaken.</p><p>The Heaven-Stabilizing Halberd possessed the ability to imprison. Struck by the demonic fire, the void locked down by the halberd shadows trembled, and even the thousands of halberd shadows began to shatter.</p><p>'Boom! Boom!'</p><p>The demonic fire continued to assault, attempting to tear apart the Heaven-Stabilizing Halberd with brute force!</p><p>Wu Lao, bearing the brunt of the attack, felt his breath catch and his divine soul stagnate under the onslaught of the demonic fire's aura, a terrifying pressure descending upon him.</p><p>Alarmed, Wu Lao hurriedly raised his right hand.</p><p>Cracking sounds emanated from his right arm as his sleeve shattered.</p><p>His arm was revealed, looking utterly inhuman.</p><p>Strange black runes covered his skin, flashing with a dark light that extended to his fingertips, dyeing his nails jet black. His fingers curled into claws, and with a powerful swipe, he unleashed a black demonic claw shadow.</p><p>'Tsss!'</p><p>The faint sound of ripping fabric echoed through the void.</p><p>The demonic claw flashed, appearing amidst the thousands of halberd shadows. It seemed insignificant, but with a single grasp, combined with the Heaven-Stabilizing Halberd, it actually managed to momentarily halt the demonic fire, as if it had collided with a wall.</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze narrowed, and he let out a cold snort, about to increase his power, when suddenly a premonition struck him, his expression darkening.</p><p>At the same time, Wu Lao also sensed something, glancing towards the depths of the ice storm.</p><p>They first saw a cerulean beam of light erupt from within the storm, bathing their faces in blue, then felt the accompanying shockwave and deafening roar!</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>Both figures swayed.</p><p>The next moment, the earth quaked!</p><p>...</p><p>Within the ice cavern.</p><p>Qin Sang's clone's hand, reaching for the Cold Crystal, froze in mid-air.</p><p>He never expected there to be a formation within a formation.</p><p>The formation master was meticulous, concealing the second spirit formation incredibly well, leaving no chance for the intruder to react. As soon as the first formation was broken, the second immediately activated.</p><p>If not for Lu Ye's disruption, Qin Sang might have had the chance to discover the hidden danger and proceed cautiously, but now regret was too late.</p><p>He only had time to warn Elder Yanshan.</p><p>This was clearly a killing formation, possibly even designed to destroy the Cold Crystal in a mutual destruction scenario.</p><p>Qin Sang shattered the ice pillar with a palm strike, grabbed the Cold Crystal, and retreated rapidly.</p><p>The Snow-Treading Divine Saber protected him.</p><p>The Wishing-Granting Pearl spun within his body, a spherical protective barrier enveloping him.</p><p>Qin Sang knew he was at the center of the killing formation. Still not feeling secure enough, he swept his hand over his head, vital energy surging and transforming into a giant hand of vital energy.</p><p>Countless cerulean specks of light appeared within the ice cavern, materializing within the ice itself, turning into small, blue arrows.</p><p>There were no arrows within the ice layer at the bottom, but the blue specks of light spread, as if sentient, converging on three locations – precisely where Qin Sang and the others stood.</p><p>From the moment the blue light emerged from the ice pillars to the eruption of the killing formation, it was but an instant.</p><p>'Crack!'</p><p>The ice layer exploded, and ear-piercing whistling sounds immediately assaulted their ears from all directions.</p><p>In an instant, the ice cavern was bathed in cerulean light.</p><p>As soon as the whistling sounds began, a tremendous force slammed against Qin Sang's protective barrier.</p><p>The barrier shattered the incoming blue crystal arrows, a blue ice flower blooming before Qin Sang's eyes, and then he was engulfed by these ice flowers.</p><p>As the one who broke the formation, Qin Sang was at the center of the spirit formation, and the number of blue crystal arrows targeting him was significantly higher, almost half the total, making his protective barrier resemble a porcupine.</p><p>'Bang, bang, bang...'</p><p>Countless blue crystal arrows rained down like a violent storm.</p><p>The protective barrier trembled violently, Qin Sang's True Essence draining rapidly like a bursting dam.</p><p>However, after enduring this onslaught, Qin Sang was actually relieved. As he had expected, the power of these blue crystal arrows was indeed limited.</p><p>A formation within a formation, so secretive, had to sacrifice some of its power. Otherwise, a formation too complex, with its interwoven energy flows, couldn't possibly escape the notice of someone breaking the outer formation.</p><p>This formation relied on surprise. If the intruder wasn't cautious and unprepared, they would be instantly pierced by countless arrows, riddled with holes.</p><p>However, no sooner had this thought crossed his mind than the Sky-Eye Butterfly warned him. Qin Sang immediately sensed a surge of violent energy erupting from below, his heart skipping a beat.</p><p>Reacting swiftly, Qin Sang soared upwards, slashing downwards with his saber.</p><p>The Snow-Treading Divine Saber pointed directly below, its blade flashing like lightning.</p><p>The ice layer suddenly exploded, cerulean light dazzling. A blue beam of light, several zhang in diameter, erupted abruptly. Within the blue light was an immense accumulation of energy, surging powerfully, a second deadly attack following the blue crystal arrows.</p><p>Fortunately, Qin Sang's vigilance hadn't wavered in the slightest, and he managed to block with his saber in time.</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>A saber's cry rang out.</p><p>The eruption of the blue beam of light abruptly ceased. At the top of the beam, a divine saber hung upside down in the void, its blade slightly tilted, like a celestial being descending from the heavens, its saber energy cascading downwards.</p><p>Immediately afterwards, the giant hand of vital energy, seizing the opportunity, followed closely behind, its five fingers spreading to grasp the beam of light.</p><p>Without even looking down, Qin Sang's figure flickered repeatedly, finally reaching the edge of the beam before the Snow-Treading Divine Saber and the giant hand of vital energy collapsed.</p><p>While Qin Sang was dodging with all his might.</p><p>Yue Fei and Elder Yanshan on the other side were also impacted.</p><p>They were located on the outer edges of the ice cavern, and both the number of blue crystal arrows and the power of the final beam of light were weaker than what Qin Sang faced.</p><p>However, the two were caught in the middle of a fierce battle when this sudden change occurred, making their situation even more perilous than Qin Sang's.</p><p>Yue Fei had maintained the upper hand throughout.</p><p>As the blue crystal arrows approached, a silver light shimmered around her. Beneath her clothes was an inner armor, perfectly conforming to her body, as thin as a cicada's wing, not hindering her movements in the slightest.</p><p>The inner armor manifested a phantom image of a full suit of armor, completely encasing Yue Fei, as sturdy as the Wishing-Granting Pearl's protective barrier, blocking all the blue crystal arrows.</p><p>However, facing the ensuing blue beam of light, Yue Fei's response wasn't as composed as Qin Sang's.</p><p>In this critical moment, she actually flung out her inner armor, using the armor itself to resist the blue beam, sacrificing the treasure to momentarily impede the beam's advance.</p><p>Elder Yanshan was a step slower.</p><p>To make matters worse, his two most relied-upon protective treasures weren't at hand.</p><p>The Dragon Head Shield was entangled by the silver bracelets.</p><p>The Primordial Heavy Water, used to restrain Yue Fei, couldn't be retrieved in time.</p><p>Hastily, Elder Yanshan only managed to retrieve the thin cord, completing a hand seal as the cord wrapped around him, transforming into a ring of water for protection.</p><p>'Plop, plop, plop...'</p><p>This item wasn't primarily for defense, and the water ring splashed and thinned rapidly.</p><p>Elder Yanshan gritted his teeth and persevered, summoning the Dragon Head Shield with all his might.</p><p>Fortunately, Yue Fei was too preoccupied to control the silver bracelets at this moment.</p><p>With a 'bang,' the blood rings on the Dragon Head Shield were shattered, reverting back to two silver bracelets. The Dragon Head Shield shot back towards him. Elder Yanshan, having just raised the shield to block the blue crystal arrows, had no time to adjust before being engulfed by the blue beam of light!</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The beam of light grazed Qin Sang's protective barrier.</p><p>Qin Sang only felt a flash of blue light before being sent flying by a powerful force. The protective barrier creaked, but since he had reacted in time, it was merely grazed and didn't collapse, leaving him unharmed.</p><p>After a dizzying spin.</p><p>'Bang!' Qin Sang crashed into the stone wall.</p><p>By now, the killing formation was at its end, the blue crystal arrows exhausted, but the chaos within the ice cavern was just beginning.</p><p>The three blue beams of light were exceptionally conspicuous. The energy within them dissipated outwards, forming waves of blue that crashed against everything within the ice cavern.</p><p>A chill emanated from his palm.</p><p>Having obtained the Cold Crystal, Qin Sang hadn't had time to examine it closely. He hurriedly looked in Elder Yanshan's direction.</p><p>At the last moment, he had seen Elder Yanshan swallowed by the beam of light. The beam's energy continued to erupt, the blue light forming a massive tide, the energy within chaotic to the extreme.</p><p>He had agreed with Elder Yanshan to retrieve the treasure together; he naturally couldn't abandon him.</p><p>Qin Sang hastily put away the Cold Crystal and dashed towards the beam of light.</p><p>Unexpectedly, midway, a graceful figure intercepted him – it was Yue Fei.</p><p>Yue Fei, without a word, commanded the Thunder Pearl, weaving it into a net of lightning that spread before her, blocking all of Qin Sang's paths.</p><p>"Get out of my way!"</p><p>Qin Sang roared furiously, slashing with his saber.</p><p>Saber energy carved a snowy path.</p><p>The icy blue light still raged all around, this place truly a realm of ice and snow.</p><p>Both cultivators practiced the Ice Dao, and in this environment, they were evenly matched.</p><p>Yue Fei had already experienced the sharpness of the Snow-Treading Divine Saber. She let out a delicate snort and flung out two objects – the two halves of the silver bracelets, which she had retrieved at some point.</p><p>The familiar scene replayed itself.</p><p>The silver bracelets transformed into bloodworms, taking advantage of the saber energy being obstructed by the lightning net, clamping onto the Snow-Treading Divine Saber from both sides.</p><p>Qin Sang completely ignored his saber.</p><p>White energy surged above his head, a new giant hand of vital energy, dozens of times smaller than the one that had grasped the beam of light, yet no less powerful, its five fingers forming claws that flashed towards Yue Fei's throat.</p><p>Yue Fei was surprisingly resourceful, still having hidden techniques. Her lips parted slightly, a shout transforming into energy that materialized as a jade screen.</p><p>Unexpectedly, before the screen fully formed, it was struck by a thread of lightning shot from Qin Sang's dantian, vanishing instantly.</p><p>Her divine ability was broken.</p><p>Yue Fei still refused to yield, twisting her body, her fragrant shoulder slightly tilted. On her jade-white, rounded shoulder was a butterfly tattoo, exquisitely needled, lifelike.</p><p>The butterfly flapped its wings and actually took flight, its wings spreading wide like a shield, narrowly protecting Yue Fei's vital point.</p><p>Though intercepted, the momentum of the giant hand of vital energy wasn't easily stopped.</p><p>The butterfly tattoo was a one-time use.</p><p>Yue Fei groaned as the butterfly dissipated, sent flying backwards. Her right shoulder's clothing was torn, blood flowing freely.</p><p>Blood trickled from the corner of her lips, staining her red lips, yet her smile became even more alluring. Ignoring her injuries, she charged towards Qin Sang once more.</p><p>"This demonic woman is mad!"</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't expected Yue Fei to fight so desperately to stop him.</p><p>This way, even if she managed to eliminate Elder Yanshan, what was the point, considering she was also severely injured and no longer a match for him?</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't understand. He immediately summoned his spirit treasure!</p>
