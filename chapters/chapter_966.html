<h1>Chapter 958: Strange Beasts</h1><p>“Fellow Daoist, are you planning to travel elsewhere?”</p><p>Qin Sang turned to ask.</p><p>Bai nodded. “My recovery is incomplete, and the corpse energy clinging to me is too conspicuous, making it unwise to travel freely.  Fellow Daoist excels at escape techniques; as long as we don't provoke Nascent Soul cultivators, our safety should be assured. If you have no pressing matters, perhaps we could explore together during this time. We might jog your memory and find a solution to our current predicament.”</p><p>After a moment's thought, Qin Sang agreed. “Very well. As long as we keep an eye on the Celestial Tower, we should be able to return promptly. I also have something I need to do.”</p><p>“Oh?”</p><p>Bai was surprised. “What else is on your mind, Fellow Daoist?  We shall follow your lead.”</p><p>“It’s nothing major,” Qin Sang patted the spirit beast pouch at his waist. “I promised this little guy I’d help it find some spirit herbs. There used to be a type of purple crystal in the Purple Mist Wasteland that could aid its growth, but unfortunately, a series of unforeseen events occurred.  Now I know that top-tier ferocious beasts guard the area where the crystals grow, making it too dangerous to collect them. I can only try my luck at another poisonous location – the Flower Fairy Lake.”</p><p>Fatty Silkworm had no other skills of note, but its sense of delicious food was extremely acute.</p><p>Once inside Flower Fairy Lake, a quick circuit would suffice, allowing Fatty Silkworm to search on its own. This wouldn’t take much time and won't delay more important matters.</p><p>Finding treasure with Old Man Zou, however, is a different matter. It’s difficult to break the ancient restrictions of the secret realm in a short period.</p><p>“Oh? Is that the spirit silkworm that helped us resist the intense poison in the poisonous mist?”</p><p>Bai glanced at the spirit beast pouch.</p><p>A sound came from inside; Fatty Silkworm was wriggling, clearly having heard Qin Sang’s words and feeling excited.</p><p>“I didn't look closely at the time. Is that spirit silkworm also a third-stage spirit insect? Fellow Daoist raising two spirit insects, both cultivated to the third stage… truly impressive wealth. If you didn’t have any reason to deceive me, I wouldn't believe you are a casual cultivator,” Bai exclaimed repeatedly.</p><p>Qin Sang smiled slightly. “It was just a fortunate coincidence. I once obtained a peculiar medicine that allowed me to cultivate them. This Fatty Silkworm hasn't actually required much effort from me; it found the purple crystal itself.  Its abilities have been of great help to me. Without its detoxifying armor, I wouldn't have dared venture deep into the Purple Mist Wasteland, and I wouldn't have met you… The Seven Killing Hall is vast, with countless ancient ruins. Some places are no less impressive than the Celestial Tower. Perhaps they might trigger your memories. We should leave immediately.”</p><p>“Good!”</p><p>Bai entered the corpse puppet pouch, Qin Sang quietly withdrew from the forest, took out a map and studied it for a while, planning a route. He moved towards a ruin named Immortal Terrace Mountain.</p><p>Along the way, Qin Sang summoned his two-headed… and rode on its back. He had Bai remain vigilant, observing the Celestial Tower, while he took out the demonic banner and attempted to refine the magical artifact.</p><p>He was already very familiar with the demonic banner; controlling three simultaneously was effortless. But controlling more was becoming difficult.</p><p>Another part of the pressure came from the Nine Nether Demon Fire.</p><p>He needed time to familiarize himself with it before mastering it.</p><p>With a crisis looming, he didn’t have much time left. The more he could improve his strength, the better his chances.</p><p>Qin Sang took out six demonic banners and tried to manipulate them. He felt a distinct clumsiness.</p><p>An array of six demonic banners could rival a top-grade magical artifact in power.</p><p>His cultivation was merely that of a mid-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator. Although he had cultivated several unorthodox secret techniques, his spiritual sense was only slightly superior to that of cultivators at the same stage.</p><p>Manipulating a top-grade magical artifact brought a significant burden, let alone an array formed by several magical artifacts. The demand on spiritual sense was certainly higher.</p><p>With great effort, Qin Sang stabilized the demonic banners, preventing the array from collapsing.</p><p>The demonic banners vibrated.</p><p>Strands of Nine Nether Demon Fire flew out from the banners, gathering into a ball at the center of the array. Just as it was about to form, it dispersed explosively.</p><p>Qin Sang’s expression changed slightly, and he quickly cast an incantation. The demonic banners vibrated, drawing the scattered demon fire back inside.</p><p>“It’s indeed not easy. I not only have to stabilize the demonic banners but also control the demon fire. My spiritual sense is still too weak! However, once I’m sufficiently familiar with the formation, I should be able to use these six demonic banners to fight. After breaking through to the late stage of Foundation Establishment, I can try to manipulate nine banners.  Even a few attacks would be incredibly powerful…”</p><p>Qin Sang muttered to himself, not discouraged, and settled down to refine the magical artifacts.</p><p>The two-headed… sensed danger, and Bai promptly alerted him. Not long after, they arrived at the foot of Immortal Terrace Mountain.</p><p>“Immortal Terrace Mountain and the Celestial Tower are the two most prominent locations in the Outer Hall. This is also a renowned secret realm! It’s said that top-tier treasures once emerged from Immortal Terrace Mountain, causing a Nascent Soul battle that even affected the Canglang Sea.”</p><p>Qin Sang looked up at Sendai Mountain and whispered, "Sendai Mountain... as the name suggests, there's a celestial altar at the summit."</p><p>"The altar itself is bare, with no other ancient halls or buildings nearby. But the mountaintop is heavily guarded by powerful restrictions, filled with mists similar to those in the inner palace—extremely dangerous. Some believe it was once an arena for ancient cultivators."</p><p>Qin Sang surveyed the area, finding no one else.  "It's said that after the Great War, no more treasures have appeared on Sendai Mountain.  It's probably been completely looted, so few people bother coming here."</p><p>Qin Sang found a hidden path, reaching the summit and standing outside the restrictions. He could clearly see the altar.</p><p>Bai appeared, studied it for a moment, and shook his head.  "I don't remember this mountain."</p><p>Qin Sang murmured an acknowledgement.</p><p>"No rush," Bai said.</p><p>Qin Sang turned and descended the mountain. After a while, they arrived at a second well-known hidden realm.  Bai still didn't recognize it.</p><p>"We're not far from Flower Fairy Lake. Let's go there first," Bai suggested.</p><p>Qin Sang, undeterred, said hopefully, "The Purple Mist Wasteland and Flower Fairy Lake are both poisonous lands.  Perhaps there's something familiar to you there."</p><p>"Let's hope so..." Bai replied.</p><p>They headed towards Flower Fairy Lake, Qin Sang continuing to familiarize himself with the Demon Banner formation.  About halfway there, as they were about to cross a mountain range, Bai suddenly hissed, "Stop! Something's changed ahead!"</p><p>The two-headed beast shuddered and stopped instantly, settling softly to the ground without a sound.</p><p>Startled, Qin Sang quickly put away the Demon Banner, dismounted, and stealthily moved towards the mountaintop. He hid behind a large rock, looking ahead.  Before him lay endless mountain ranges, and he could glimpse a towering pagoda piercing the clouds in the distance.</p><p>A piercing sound of something breaking the air reached them.</p><p>Shortly after, Qin Sang saw a streak of light shoot out from the distant forest, a powerful display easily visible even from this distance.  In the Seven Kill Palace, unless it was an emergency, no cultivator dared to use such unrestrained escape techniques.  Attracting top-tier beasts or other cultivators would be extremely dangerous.</p><p>The owner of the light seemed to be in great panic, fleeing from something.</p><p>Sure enough, a moment later, a thunderous roar erupted behind the light.</p><p>"ROAR!"  The sound shook the heavens.</p>
