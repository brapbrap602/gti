<h1>Chapter 1960 No Regrets</h1><p>The Emperor was gravely ill.</p><p>All factions focused their attention on the struggle for the throne.</p><p>The unexpected change, however, began from the outside.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>Yu Lang’s hand trembled, and the teacup fell to the ground, shattering into pieces.</p><p>Ignoring the tea splashing onto his clothes, Yu Lang stared intently at the names on the urgent report.</p><p>Qi Prefecture, Ci Zhen Prefecture, Zhong Ning Prefecture…</p><p>Without exception, all were prefectural cities of Lu Province. The focal point of the Great Liang Kingdom's attack was Lu Province!</p><p>And the prefect of Zhong Ning Prefecture in Lu Province was Chen Zhenqing, Master Chen!</p><p>The mortal world, unlike the cultivation world, lacked communication talismans and spells. War reports were delayed. With the Great Liang invasion, several prefectures were almost instantly isolated. By the time the news reached the capital, several days had passed. No one knew if the Lu Province garrison could withstand this surprise attack, nor what the situation in the city was now!</p><p>Within the Yan Kingdom, four provinces bordered the Great Liang Kingdom.</p><p>Of these four, Lu Province, although ravaged by wars, was not the most strategically important. Logically, Lu Province shouldn't be the Great Liang Kingdom's first choice for an invasion of Yan.</p><p>Precisely because of this, the Yan Kingdom's troop deployment in Lu Province was not the strongest.</p><p>The Crown Prince was not yet the Emperor. Interfering with military power was a grave taboo.  Yu Lang’s covert operations could, at most, send some additional defensive troops to Zhong Ning Prefecture.</p><p>The Great Liang Kingdom’s sudden assault on Lu Province had shown no prior signs.  Yu Lang, close to the central government, hadn't seen any related intelligence, indicating the covert nature of this attack.</p><p>Caught off guard, how long could Lu Province hold out?</p><p>How long could Zhong Ning Prefecture hold out?!</p><p>‘Creak!’</p><p>A woman dressed in goose-yellow brocade pushed open the door, carrying a soup bowl, and walked in.</p><p>The woman was beautiful, dignified, and gentle. She was Yu Lang’s lawfully wedded wife, the daughter of the Minister of Rites, surnamed Mu, given name Yunwan.</p><p>“Husband, drink your ginseng soup.”</p><p>Mu Yunwan glanced at the porcelain shards on the floor, placed the soup bowl down, and spoke softly.  Then, she met Yu Lang’s gaze, and her heart abruptly clenched.</p><p>What kind of gaze was this?  Lost, helpless, panicked, terrified…</p><p>In the court, no matter how perilous the situation, her husband always seemed composed. She had never seen such a look in his eyes before.</p><p>“What happened?”</p><p>Mu Yunwan extended her delicate hand, gently grasping Yu Lang’s palm, trying to soothe him with her tenderness.</p><p>Yu Lang seemed to awaken from a dream. “Is the messenger still outside?”</p><p>Mu Yunwan hummed in affirmation.</p><p>Yu Lang abruptly stood, quickly shed his official robes, pushed open the back window, and instead of using the main door, attempted to climb out.</p><p>Just as he was about to climb out, Yu Lang seemed to remember something and turned back to instruct, “When Tao Teng arrives, tell him to wait for me in the study. I’ll go to the Eastern Palace after I return!”</p><p>Even without using spiritual power, Yu Lang was a true Innate Realm expert, his lightness skill refined to perfection.  He quickly left these words and, like a nimble cat, vanished into the darkness.</p><p>Mu Yunwan stood by the window, gripping the window frame tightly, her face full of worry as she gazed at the pitch-black night.</p><p>…</p><p>By the Jade Waist Lake.</p><p>Qingyang Tea House.</p><p>Yu Lang had left the Qin residence and rushed here non-stop, using his lightness skill throughout the journey.</p><p>The urgent message lay before Xiao Wu.</p><p>Xiao Wu, unlike Yu Lang, wasn't panicked. After a moment of silence, she said, “Master won’t leave.”</p><p>Yu Lang understood his senior sister's meaning.  As if answering her, and also reassuring himself, he said, “Zhong Ning Prefecture is a prefectural city. Even if besieged by the enemy, it shouldn't fall so quickly…”</p><p>However, they both understood that the Great Liang Kingdom’s sudden invasion must have been planned for a long time, aiming to seize the greatest advantage in one fell swoop!</p><p>On the border, besides the major fortified passes, the so-called prefectural cities were less secure. Some were newly built on the ruins of old cities.  Their walls were probably only slightly stronger than those of ordinary county towns.</p><p>Yu Lang's voice was strained. “Master has a protective talisman.”</p><p>“Master won’t leave!”</p><p>Xiao Wu repeated.</p><p>The protective talisman they gave Master Chen was only meant to ward off accidents and defend against cultivators' spells. They could refine better talismans, but the divine wouldn't allow it.</p><p>Once surrounded by an army, facing blades and weapons, a protective talisman wouldn’t be enough.</p><p>Moreover, given Chen Zhenqing’s character, he would surely choose to face life and death alongside the people!</p><p>“I’m going to Zhong Ning Prefecture!”</p><p>Xiao Wu pointed at her brow.  Spiritual light flashed, emitting a ‘bang.’ A complex rune appeared and then shattered, as if breaking a seal. Xiao Wu's cultivation was fully restored!</p><p>The next moment, Xiao Wu vanished from the spot.</p><p>‘Splash…’</p><p>The lake rippled, the night sounds unusually clear, carrying into the Qingyang Tea House.</p><p>The room remained unlit.</p><p>After Xiao Wu left, Yu Lang sat alone in the darkness. At this critical juncture of political upheaval, he remained there for a long time.</p><p>His senior sister had gone to Zhong Ning Prefecture to save someone. A cultivator interfering in mortal affairs was precisely what he had vehemently opposed before.</p><p>Now, he couldn't stop her, dared not stop her.</p><p>He couldn't stand by and watch Master Chen die.</p><p>He knew clearly that if Master Chen insisted on staying and facing his fate with Zhong Ning Prefecture, his senior sister would definitely intervene and force back the Great Liang army.</p><p>The mortal realm’s situation, the fate of countless people, would be changed by a single cultivator.</p><p>Yu Lang slowly bowed his head, burying his face in his hands.</p><p>A gust of wind blew in.</p><p>A figure appeared beside him, the young man surnamed Shi.</p><p>Yu Lang not only hadn't stopped his senior sister but had also made a secondary arrangement. If his senior sister couldn’t break the seal, he would ask Brother Shi to go to Zhong Ning Prefecture.</p><p>After understanding the situation, Shi sighed softly and patted Yu Lang's shoulder.  “Still can’t figure it out? Heh, you’ll learn that there are many things in this world that you can’t understand!”</p><p>“You should go back. If Master Chen dies on the battlefield, it would be a worthy death.  If you ask, I will slaughter the entire Great Liang army for you, but your purpose in entering the mortal realm would be meaningless.  I think Master Chen, in the afterlife, would rather see you assist the Crown Prince in ascending the throne, strengthen the Yan Kingdom, and defeat the Great Liang Kingdom honorably, avenging him!”</p><p>…</p><p>The official road was filled with refugees.</p><p>The night was exceptionally dark. The people were exhausted, moving forward with little strength. As long as they had a sliver of energy left, they dared not stop. The enemy army was behind them. They could only flee, flee towards the interior.</p><p>Xiao Wu flew in the sky, her gaze scanning the ground below.</p><p>Upon entering Lu Province, she followed the official road leading to Zhong Ning Prefecture. If Chen Zhenqing and his family had escaped from Zhong Ning Prefecture, they would surely take this road.</p><p>Then, within her spiritual sense, a familiar aura finally appeared. Xiao Wu immediately descended.</p><p>By the side of the road, a carriage was moving slowly.  It didn't appear particularly luxurious.  The driver was a burly man with fierce eyes, clearly someone not to be trifled with.</p><p>Inside the carriage sat a mother and daughter.</p><p>The daughter was nestled in her mother's arms, asleep.</p><p>The mother held her daughter, her face pale with tear stains.  Her body swayed with the carriage’s bumps as she stared blankly into the darkness ahead, her eyes unfocused.</p><p>This mother and daughter were Chen Zhenqing’s wife, Chen Liushi, and their daughter.</p><p>“Aunt!”</p><p>Chen Liushi hadn’t noticed Xiao Wu's sudden appearance and was startled by the call. Her gaze shifted before she regained her composure.</p><p>A faint light illuminated the carriage.</p><p>Recognizing Xiao Wu, Chen Liushi’s face was full of surprise. “Xiao Wu, why are you here?”</p><p>“Aunt, didn’t Master leave the city with you?” Xiao Wu had a premonition, but facing the reality, her heart was still incredibly heavy.</p><p>“He found an opportunity to send us, mother and daughter, out of the city, but he refused to leave himself, vowing to live and die with the people in the city!”</p><p>Chen Liushi hugged her daughter tightly and couldn’t help but shed tears. Her voice was filled with grief, yet also a trace of strength and pride. “He did it. He honored his oath from back then!”</p><p>Xiao Wu remained silent, looking towards Zhong Ning Prefecture.</p><p>Master Chen’s declaration at Qingyang Temple, made after drinking wine, was vivid in her memory!</p><p>Remembering something, Chen Liushi reached into her bosom and tremblingly took out a letter.</p><p>Throughout their arduous escape, this letter had been perfectly preserved without a single crease.</p><p>“This is what Zhenqing left for you!”</p><p>Xiao Wu took the letter, opened it, and found only eight characters written inside:  *Die with the people, die without regret!*</p><p>The ink was slightly smudged, clearly hastily written and folded before it dried, but from the powerful calligraphy, one could still sense a strong conviction and resolve.</p><p>“Xiao Wu…”</p><p>Chen Liushi hesitated and asked, “Are you… not ordinary people?”</p><p>Xiao Wu, so far away in the capital, had suddenly appeared here. Even riding the fastest horse, such speed was impossible.</p><p>Back in Qipai Village, she and her husband had recognized that Daoist Qingfeng possessed an extraordinary air, a recluse expert, whose two disciples were also exceptional individuals.</p><p>However, Chen Liushi didn’t know the extent of their extraordinariness.</p><p>Seeing Xiao Wu nod in acknowledgment, Chen Liushi's eyes gradually brightened. “Can you…”</p><p>“I’ll go to Zhong Ning Prefecture now!”</p><p>Xiao Wu left a restriction on the carriage and flew towards Zhong Ning Prefecture.</p><p>With her cultivation, the journey from here to Zhong Ning Prefecture would be instantaneous, but she deliberately slowed down, as if hesitant, afraid to approach the city.</p><p>Darkness shrouded the land.</p><p>Xiao Wu flew alone, her speed reduced to that of a bird, finally seeing the prefectural city of Zhong Ning.</p><p>She remembered that when she had visited before, Zhong Ning Prefecture, after years of recuperation, was gradually recovering its vitality and showing signs of prosperity. Now, within the city, countless torches illuminated the night sky, also illuminating the broken walls and the mountains of corpses and seas of blood!</p><p>Xiao Wu landed on a hill outside the city.</p><p>She stood there, silently gazing at the city.</p><p>She tightly clutched the letter left by Master Chen. The paper was high-quality Xuan paper from Yan.  Blown by the night wind, it rustled like a fluttering white butterfly.</p><p>Xiao Wu remained motionless, like a statue.</p><p>Within the city, Master's aura lingered, but it was devoid of life.</p><p>She was too late!</p><p>Anger, grief, regret, self-blame, sorrow…</p><p>Xiao Wu couldn't distinguish the complexity of her emotions.  It was more complex than when she had been betrayed by Meng Yusu. She dared not enter the city to face it.</p><p>What should she do now?</p><p>Revenge?</p><p>Xiao Wu was somewhat lost, looking at the eight characters in her hand.</p><p>She could easily slaughter the entire Great Liang army, but what would that accomplish?</p><p>This was a war between two nations. If she forcefully sought a culprit, from the monarch to the lowest soldier, everyone could be considered responsible, but no one had a personal grudge against Master Chen.</p><p>Moreover, Master Chen had the opportunity to leave, but he gave it up, calmly facing death.</p><p>He died for his country, for his people, claiming to die without regret!</p><p>‘Whoosh…’</p><p>The night wind intensified.</p><p>“Master, what should I do?”</p><p>Xiao Wu stared blankly at the deep night sky.  She finally moved, walking down the hill.  She didn't use any magical transportation, but simply concealed her presence, walking step by step towards the city.</p><p>The city gates were smashed.  The Great Liang soldiers showed no intention of repairing them, not planning to stay here permanently.</p><p>Along both sides of the main road, corpses were dragged to the roadside, piled together, forming rivers of blood.</p><p>Xiao Wu walked along the bloody path towards the prefectural government office.</p><p>The city was unusually noisy. The Great Liang soldiers were celebrating their victory amidst the mountains of corpses and seas of blood.</p><p>Xiao Wu's eyes were vacant, as if she didn’t hear these sounds, unconsciously arriving at the government office.</p><p>One of the government office’s doors was also smashed.  The guards at the entrance didn’t notice a woman brush past them and walk inside.</p><p>The main hall of the government office.</p><p>A large sand table was set up, displaying the entire terrain of Lu Province.</p><p>Only one person was in the hall, the Great Liang general who led this army. He held a candle, carefully examining the sand table, engrossed in analyzing the war situation.</p><p>Suddenly, hurried footsteps sounded from outside.</p><p>Someone reported from outside, “Reporting to General, the identities of those corpses have been confirmed.”</p><p>The general straightened up and said in a deep voice, “Are you certain it is the Prefect of Zhong Ning Prefecture, not a body double?”</p><p>The voice outside replied, “It’s indeed him! His name is Chen Zhenqing, a man of high prestige in Lu Province!  Master Zuo asks if we should take the body or sever the head and hang it at the camp gate.  It would certainly greatly demoralize the enemy!”</p><p>“Chen Zhenqing, this general has heard of him even in Great Liang.  He is known for his love for the people. During the siege, there were some oversights, and many officials and nobles escaped. This man, as the chief official, stayed behind and died on the battlefield with his soldiers.  It seems his reputation isn't unfounded! Such a virtuous person, whose integrity persists even after death, should not be subjected to such indignity!”</p><p>The general paused for a moment and then said in a deep voice, “Let him rest in peace. Give him a proper burial!”</p><p>“Yes, sir!”</p><p>The person outside left after receiving the order.</p><p>…</p><p>The tomb of Chen Zhenqing, Prefect of Zhong Ning Prefecture, Lu Province, Yan Kingdom.</p><p>Xiao Wu stood before the tomb, looking at the grave the Great Liang soldiers had erected for Master Chen.</p><p>She had observed the entire process, only appearing after the soldiers had left.</p><p>After a long period of mourning and paying her respects to Master Chen, the fingers tightly gripping the letter gradually relaxed.</p><p>Finally, she meticulously folded the letter and carefully put it away, then left the city of Zhong Ning Prefecture.</p><p>Leaving Master Chen forever on this land was perhaps his best resting place.</p><p>Xiao Wu found her aunt and magically transported them back to Qipai Village, settling them down.</p><p>She stood at the foot of the mountain, gazing at Qingyang Temple on the mountain.  She hesitated, then turned away without going up, summoning a white cloud and flying away.</p><p>Above the white cloud.</p><p>Xiao Wu looked at the vast land, her eyes still somewhat lost and uncertain, unsure of right or wrong.</p><p>Her flight had no direction.</p><p>She hadn’t even noticed that she had deviated from the path to the capital, nor where she had flown to.</p><p>Suddenly, Xiao Wu’s eyes flickered, her wooden gaze shifting to the distance, a ripple finally appearing in her eyes.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>Instantly crossing numerous mountain ranges, Xiao Wu appeared above a mountain valley.</p><p>A moment later, a white figure leaped from the valley, pouncing into Xiao Wu’s arms, letting out a cry full of affection and joy.</p><p>“Ying ying…”</p><p>It was a white fox.</p><p>--</p><p>--</p><p>Unknowingly, another Spring Festival arrived.</p><p>Wishing all readers a happy new year, a prosperous year of the Dragon, soaring to the Nine Heavens!</p><p>I'm also taking three days off to rest and spend time with my family.</p><p>(End of Chapter)</p>
