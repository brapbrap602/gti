<h1>```</h1><p>第一千三百九十四章 Hundred Flowers Valley's Legacy </p><p>Black Swamp.</p><p>Grim, decaying.</p><p>Rotten mud is visible everywhere, emitting a strange odor that makes one want to vomit.</p><p>Black miasma obscures the sky.</p><p>Even at midday, the Black Swamp is dark.</p><p>Some of these miasmas are formed from the accumulation of rotten气息 , while others are highly poisonous. Even cultivators who are contaminated by them may perish.</p><p>Poisonous miasma and various other miasmas are mixed together, making them difficult to distinguish and preventing any precautions.</p><p>Strangely, the Black Swamp is not barren. It is not lacking in plants, but these trees are also black, like decaying wood, yet they thrive, displaying an unusual vitality.</p><p>The black trees are like evil spirits, entrenched in the dark miasma, waiting to devour intruders at any moment.</p><p>This place is sparsely populated, with few Immortal Sects.</p><p>The Black Swamp is vast. Among all the landforms in Crescent Moon Realm, it has the largest area, occupying the most core area of Crescent Moon Realm. However, such a large place has few spiritual veins and is not suitable for the growth of spiritual herbs, making it barren.</p><p>Cultivators seeking treasures will not come to this kind of place unless they need something strange.</p><p>'Whoosh, whoosh...'</p><p>The miasma surged, and there was a slight sound of breaking through the air.</p><p>After a while, several spots of light appeared faintly in the depths of the miasma, some green, some blue, with different colors.</p><p>The spots of light flew closer and closer. They turned out to be six cultivators.</p><p>Among the six, five were cultivators around the tenth layer of the Qi Refining stage, some young, some already showing obvious signs of aging.</p><p>They were surrounding a black-robed youth.</p><p>The youth was the only Foundation Establishment stage cultivator. Compared to the others, he seemed to be at ease in the poisonous miasma. He was stepping on a silver disc-shaped flying magic item, standing on it with his hands behind his back, with a faint罩  around him, blocking the miasma.</p><p>The others were not so relaxed. They were flying while activating crude护身法器 , constantly vigilant against the dangers that might appear around them at any time.</p><p>They seemed to have been flying for a long time and gradually felt exhausted, but seeing that the black-robed youth had no intention of stopping, they had no choice but to grit their teeth and persevere.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Yue, where exactly is it? Why is it so far!"</p><p>The only female cultivator was dripping with fragrant sweat and couldn't help but complain.</p><p>A long-bearded man beside her said with a smile, "Fairy Ming, please persevere for a while. We'll be there soon. That place is one of the few places in the Black Swamp with abundant spiritual Qi. If it were so easy to find, it wouldn't be our turn."</p><p>The female cultivator didn't believe it. "Is there really such a good blessed land? Why hasn't anyone else discovered it?"</p><p>"Those mountains are surrounded by miasma, which is even denser than the deepest part of the Black Swamp, and it naturally has the power of illusion. I stumbled into it by mistake and discovered the clues. But my strength is weak, and I didn't dare to enter, so I called Senior Huang and fellow Daoists. If we can occupy this place and open up a cave dwelling, we..."</p><p>As he was speaking, he was suddenly interrupted by the black-robed youth. "Is it here?"</p><p>Everyone suppressed their escape light, and saw that the miasma in front of them was as thick as clouds, and the阴气  was 森森 .</p><p>The long-bearded man nodded repeatedly. "It's here! Senior, please follow me."</p><p>Saying that, the long-bearded man found the mark he had left before,调息  for a while, and took the lead to enter the miasma.</p><p>The black-robed youth put away the silver disc, summoned a 寸剑 , and everyone else took out their respective magic items and followed the man in.</p><p>"Wait!"</p><p>As soon as he entered the miasma, the black-robed man suddenly stopped everyone, listened carefully for a moment, and his expression changed slightly. "What's that sound?"</p><p>Before he finished speaking, the surrounding suddenly buzzed loudly.</p><p>The scene that followed made everyone gasp.</p><p>The depths of the miasma suddenly rolled violently, and groups of strange insects rushed out of the miasma, frantically pouncing on them. These strange insects were shaped like mosquitoes, but each one was the size of a baby's fist, and their long口器  were like steel needles, making people's scalps tingle.</p><p>"Blood Poison Mosquitoes!"</p><p>The youth exclaimed in shock.</p><p>The others also showed terrified expressions. Blood Poison Mosquitoes are famous fierce mosquitoes in the Black Swamp. A single one is not conspicuous, but once you encounter a group of Blood Poison Mosquitoes, even Foundation Establishment stage cultivators have to flee for their lives.</p><p>At this time, there were hundreds of Blood Poison Mosquitoes flying out of the miasma, and the shadows behind them were looming, a dark mass. I'm afraid there are endless Blood Poison Mosquitoes.</p><p>If they were surrounded by thousands of Blood Poison Mosquitoes, they would all be doomed and instantly turn into dried corpses.</p><p>"This is the Blood Poison Mosquito nest! Run!"</p><p>The black-robed youth cursed the long-bearded man thousands of times in his belly. He didn't dare to hesitate and turned around to run.</p><p>The long-bearded man didn't expect to cause such a big disaster, his legs cramping, staggering and fleeing outwards.</p><p>For a time, people were thrown off their feet, regretting that they were born without a pair of wings.</p><p>Fortunately, the Blood Poison Mosquitoes seemed unwilling to leave the miasma too far. Everyone escaped death, their souls still shocked, and they dared to stop and regulate their breath only after flying until they were exhausted.</p><p>They didn't know.</p><p>After they escaped, two figures flew out of the miasma, a man and a woman.</p><p>These two were wearing 法袍  of similar shape. The man's left arm was embroidered with a灵虫  shaped like a snake and earthworm, with two horns on its head, while the woman's was a pattern of a seven-瓣  spiritual flower.</p><p>"Junior Brother, your Starlight Insect's Divine Ability of Light and Shadow Transformation is becoming more and more skilled."</p><p>The female cultivator lowered her head and looked at the spiritual insect in the man's palm, praising.</p><p>This insect is shaped like a firefly in the mortal world, but its entire body is transparent, and within its body, it flickers with starlight-like cold light.</p><p>The Starlight Insect lay on the man's palm, docile and unusually close to the man.</p><p>These two are disciples of Hundred Flowers Valley.</p><p>The Blood Poison Mosquitoes that startled away the black-robed youth and others were only a small part of the truth. The rest were all illusions transformed by the Starlight Insect's light and shadow.</p><p>The man smiled, his expression a bit complacent, but he was complaining, "The Sect doesn't want people to know that this is our Hundred Flowers Valley's 山门 , so they use a Grand Formation to seal off the entire place. We still have to patrol back and forth, pretending to be mysterious, and startling away intruders. Relying only on the natural miasma and the few strange insects that live inside is not very useful and can't stop those who are determined."</p><p>The female cultivator rolled her eyes. "It's obviously because you were lazy last time and didn't drive that person away in time, causing a mess. You still dare to complain to the Sect. The护山大阵  can protect Hundred Flowers Valley, but these mountains are so vast. If they were all sealed off with Spirit Formations, how much would it cost? Moreover, the Sect just doesn't want to be disturbed by low-level cultivators. If a real master is determined to come, we can't stop them anyway."</p><p>"Senior Sister is right."</p><p>After being reprimanded, the man didn't care at all. He looked at the direction the youth escaped in with a smirk, winking his eyes. "That guy's inch sword is really good, extremely agile. I heard that Little Junior Sister has always wanted this kind of magic item."</p><p>The female cultivator glared at him fiercely. "What do you want to do? Be careful to let Master hear and punish you to guard the Snake Cave for ten years! Go patrol, and if you dare to be lazy again, I will definitely report to Master and deal with you!"</p><p>The man mumbled a few words, didn't dare to argue, and quickly put the Starlight Insect into his dantian and flew back into the miasma.</p><p>...</p><p>At this time.</p><p>Two escape lights were flying in the miasma at an astonishing speed,肆无忌惮 .</p><p>"We're almost at Hundred Flowers Valley."</p><p>The voice of Feng Shangshi rang out from one of the escape lights.</p><p>Qin Sang stared ahead, pleased, "We've finally arrived! Thank you, Fellow Daoist Feng, for accompanying me all the way and introducing me to so many fellow Daoists."</p><p>They stopped and went along the way, visiting several 元婴  cultivators who were familiar with Feng Shangshi.</p><p>From Feng Shangshi's mouth, Qin Sang also learned a lot of rumors and secrets, gaining a lot.</p><p>"Since Fellow Daoist needs Black Gāng Soft Gold, why didn't you agree to Old Ghost Ming's invitation? As long as Fellow Daoist speaks, Old Ghost Ming must be willing to delay for a few days and wait for Fellow Daoist to go back before taking action."</p><p>Feng Shangshi asked curiously.</p><p>It turned out that they had just come out of another Nascent Soul's cave.</p><p>Black Gāng Soft Gold is exactly the spiritual object used to refine the Golden Sunken Sword, which meets another requirement of Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang smiled bitterly, "Fellow Daoist Ming is preparing to go deep into the Bottomless Devil Cave to explore! I've heard that several Nascent Souls once joined forces to enter the Bottomless Devil Cave and all died. Ten thousand years ago, a great cultivator disappeared in the Bottomless Devil Cave. Although I don't know if the rumors are true or false, it's enough to show how dangerous the Bottomless Devil Cave is. I don't want to risk my life for a piece of Black Gāng Soft Gold..."</p><p>Bottomless Devil Cave.</p><p>Known as the most dangerous forbidden area in Crescent Moon Realm.</p><p>Located northwest of Black Swamp, close to the sea.</p><p>It is said that the entrance to the Bottomless Devil Cave is just an ordinary stone cave, but the deeper you go, the more dangerous it becomes, and no one has reached the end yet.</p><p>Although Black Gāng Soft Gold is rare.</p><p>After weighing it, Qin Sang decided to give up.</p><p>As he spoke, the two came near Hundred Flowers Valley and took in the scene that had just happened, including the Hundred Flowers Valley disciple putting the Starlight Insect into his dantian.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist saw it, right?"</p><p>Feng Shangshi asked meaningfully.</p><p>Qin Sang hesitated for a moment before nodding slightly, "Indeed very unique!"</p><p>Feng Shangshi didn't notice the shock that flashed in Qin Sang's eyes!</p><p>The Hundred Flowers Valley disciple's method of 御使  the spiritual insect, and the fluctuation between the spiritual insects.</p><p>Qin Sang felt very familiar, it was actually very similar to the 本命虫蛊之术  of the Witch Clan!</p><p>The Hundred Flowers Valley disciple is obviously a human!</p><p>Whether in Northern Chen Realm or the Three Realms of the Northern Sea, Qin Sang had not heard any rumors about the Witch Clan.</p><p>It can basically be determined that there are no traces of the Witch Clan in the Four Realms of the Northern Sea.</p><p>Could it be that the Life-Bound Insect Gu Technique is not unique to the Witch Clan?</p><p>Or, have the Three Realms of the Northern Sea discovered the ancient跡  of the Witch Clan, and Hundred Flowers Valley obtained the legacy from the ancient跡?</p><p>Humans don't have the talent of the Witch Clan. I only dare to cultivate with the ability of the Jade Buddha. How do they solve the hidden danger of the Life-Bound Insect Gu devouring its master?</p><p>In an instant, countless thoughts flashed rapidly through Qin Sang's mind.</p><p>In any case, this trip was definitely worth it.</p><p>Qin Sang never expected that the Canglang Sea Route would be broken, but there would be an unexpected discovery in Crescent Moon Realm.</p><p>However, it was only a fleeting glimpse just now, and Qin Sang couldn't be sure whether the Hundred Flowers Valley legacy was the real Witch Clan's Life-Bound Insect Gu Secret Technique.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist wait a moment," Feng Shangshi suppressed his escape light outside the miasma, and flicked his fingers to send out a stream of light, which disappeared into the miasma.</p><p>Qin Sang remained calm, suddenly remembered something, and pretended to casually look around, "Fellow Daoist said that the ancestor of Hundred Flowers Valley came from Boundless Sea, I wonder where in Boundless Sea?"</p><p>Feng Shangshi carefully recalled for a while and said, "... It seems to be from a place called Clear Lake, but I can't ask too much about where it is specifically. Why is Fellow Daoist asking this?"</p><p>"Clear Lake..."</p><p>Qin Sang silently recited these two words. It didn't sound like the name of a large area, so it probably wouldn't be easy to find.</p><p>Hundred Flowers Valley probably won't easily reveal the secrets of their legacy. I need to prepare with both hands and start with the origin of the Hundred Flowers Valley ancestor, perhaps I can find out something.</p><p>"I'm wondering whether Hundred Flowers Valley regards itself as a force of Boundless Sea, or a force of Crescent Moon Realm?" Qin Sang laughed.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist suspects that Hundred Flowers Valley is a nail planted by Boundless Sea in Crescent Moon Realm?"</p><p>Feng Shangshi laughed loudly, "Fellow Daoist is overthinking it. Boundless Sea is a mess and complicated. Even if a great cultivator comes forward, he can't subdue all forces and make them work for him..."</p><p>Before he finished speaking.</p><p>The miasma in front of them suddenly rolled violently, splitting a road from it, and a crisp voice like a maiden's voice came from inside, "Honored guests are here, this concubine has failed to welcome you from afar, I hope the two fellow Daoists won't blame me."</p><p>Feng Shangshi gave a light sigh, "Is it Fellow Daoist Lan? Is Fellow Daoist Mu not in the valley?"</p><p>Then he explained to Qin Sang, "Fellow Daoist Lan is Fellow Daoist Mu's Junior Sister, named Lan Jingsi. A genius of heaven, she succeeded in forming her Core before she was three hundred years old, creating a good story of two Nascent Souls in one Sect."</p><p>A silver bell-like laughter came from the opposite side, "Fellow Daoist Feng is too kind..."</p><p>Before she finished speaking, a gentle breeze blew past the two, and a girl appeared in front of them, fresh and natural, without makeup, and with natural beauty.</p><p>Lan Jingsi's beautiful eyes moved, glanced at Qin Sang, and looked at Feng Shangshi, "Senior Brother praised Fellow Daoist Feng's extraordinary Divine Ability many times when he returned to the valley last time. This concubine has long admired Fellow Daoist, but unfortunately I stayed in the valley at the time and didn't go with Senior Brother, so I couldn't witness it with my own eyes."</p><p>Feng Shangshi laughed loudly and said that he didn't dare, then pointed to Qin Sang, "This is Fellow Daoist Mingyue, whose Divine Ability is far superior to mine. Bìfāng  was his underling. This time, I was entrusted by Fellow Daoist Mingyue to visit Fellow Daoist Mu."</p><p>Lan Jingsi was greatly surprised when she heard this.</p><p>Qin Sang cupped his hands, "Greetings, Fellow Daoist Lan."</p><p>Lan Jingsi returned the courtesy, withdrew her exploratory gaze, and frowned slightly, there was actually a bit of a maiden's娇俏 , "The two of you came at the wrong time. Senior Brother just left the valley not long ago, and I'm afraid he won't be back for a short time..."</p><p>"This..."</p><p>Feng Shangshi and Qin Sang exchanged glances, feeling embarrassed. He had a little friendship with Valley Master Mu, but he had only met Lan Jingsi for the first time, so it was not easy to talk to her directly about some things.</p><p>At this time, Lan Jingsi changed her tone and said, "This is not the place to talk. Please follow me back to the valley first, and drink a cup of 花茶 . If Senior Brother is not here, this concubine can also make the decisions."</p><p>Qin Sang followed the good advice.</p><p>Passing through the miasma, he realized that the inside was a different world.</p><p>Here the mountains were continuous, the mountains were clear and the waters were beautiful, and there was no trace of rotten阴森气息 .</p><p>In the Black Swamp, it was a paradise, definitely a rare blessed place.</p><p>The three flew to the Hundred Flowers Valley shānmén  in the air. Before long, they saw some Hundred Flowers Valley disciples practicing and competing on a mountain. Most of them were female disciples, and there were bursts of娇喝 .</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't help but take a few more glances.</p><p>Sure enough, he found several more disciples with Life-Bound Insect Gu.</p><p>This time he saw it more clearly.</p><p>From Qin Sang's perspective, none of these disciples' insect Gu were of the Strange Insect level, they were all ordinary.</p><p>If it were someone else, it would be easy to overlook where their insect-controlling technique was special.</p><p>Qin Sang had a Life-Bound Insect Gu, and he could see the crux of the matter at a glance.</p><p>It originated from the same source as the Witch Clan's legacy, but it was not exactly the same!</p>
