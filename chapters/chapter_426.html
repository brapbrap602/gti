<h1>Chapter 419 Blood-Defiling Divine Light</h1><p>The Ebony Sword, having completely devoured the Infernal Blood Mulberry, had transformed into a low-grade magical treasure, a seamless fusion of sword and wood. Its emerald blade radiated an extreme sharpness, the sword intent nearly solidifying, as if capable of tearing through the void.</p><p>Qin Sang cast an affectionate glance at the Ebony Sword, then his gaze turned icy as he fixed it on the escaping streak of blood-colored light. His lips parted slightly, uttering a single word:</p><p>"Go!"</p><p>In an instant, the Ebony Sword vanished before Qin Sang's eyes.</p><p>The next moment, a tremendous thunderclap echoed through the sky.</p><p>The thunder reverberated across the land, possessing earth-shattering power, terrifying spirits and shaking hearts.</p><p>Hearing the thunder, the fleeing silver-robed man was startled. A sense of impending doom washed over him. He hastily looked back, only to see a blinding sword light, traveling at an astonishing speed, like a meteor streaking across the moon, hurtling towards him.</p><p>Despite the vast distance, the sword light arrived in the blink of an eye, practically within arm's reach.</p><p>The sharp edge of the flying sword, carrying an insurmountable force, left the silver-robed man aghast.</p><p>The earth-shattering thunder was a consequence of this very sword light.</p><p>Witnessing this scene, the silver-robed man suddenly recalled a legendary swordsmanship realm—Thunderclap Sword Qi!</p><p>A sword strike as swift as lightning, fleeting as a dream.</p><p>Legend had it that even Golden Core cultivators rarely comprehended this swordsmanship realm. Only sword fanatics or those blessed with exceptional talent had the chance to achieve it.</p><p>Qin Sang naturally didn't possess such talent. He needed to cultivate every second he could, and couldn't afford to indulge in swordsmanship, becoming a sword fanatic, comprehending sword intent day and night.</p><p>Thunderclap Sword Qi was the second divine ability granted to Qin Sang by the *Divine Sword Nurturing Scripture*.</p><p>Upon breaking through to the second level of the scripture, he had gained the divine abilities of Man-Sword Unity and Shadowless Escape, which had saved him from peril multiple times.</p><p>A few years ago, after reaching the late Foundation Establishment stage and cultivating to the fourth level, Qin Sang learned the Thunderclap Sword Qi divine ability.</p><p>After mastering this ability, Qin Sang spent a considerable amount of time in secluded cultivation, carefully comprehending it.  He discovered that Thunderclap Sword Qi truly lived up to its name, incredibly powerful.</p><p>The most terrifying aspect was its astonishing speed. Coupled with the Ebony Sword's magical treasure status, cultivators of the same realm, if they were careless and got too close, wouldn't have time to react before being pierced by the Ebony Sword, their spiritual energy and bodies easily cleaved.</p><p>After understanding Thunderclap Sword Qi, Qin Sang didn't hesitate to temporarily halt his other cultivation, secluding himself for an entire year to master the application of this divine ability.</p><p>This was a powerful divine ability that could even influence battles between Golden Core cultivators. Thanks to the *Divine Sword Nurturing Scripture*, Qin Sang had grasped it at the Foundation Establishment stage.</p><p>With Thunderclap Sword Qi alone, he could easily crush cultivators of the same realm.</p><p>If it weren't for the terrifying side effects of the *Divine Sword Nurturing Scripture*, which made it impossible for ordinary people to cultivate successfully, surely all disciples of Shaohua Mountain would choose this technique without hesitation!</p><p>After breaking through to late Foundation Establishment and inscribing the fourth Killing Rune onto the Ebony Sword, Qin Sang's understanding of the *Divine Sword Nurturing Scripture* deepened. The spirit sword resided within his Nascent Soul, and the four Killing Runes, along with the sword intent and killing intent emanating from the spirit sword itself, constantly assaulted his Nascent Soul.</p><p>If not for the protection of the Jade Buddha, Qin Sang would have long since become a madman.</p><p>Because of this, Qin Sang admired Senior Qingzhu even more. What immense willpower Senior Qingzhu must have possessed to withstand the assault of sword intent and Killing Runes with a fragile Nascent Soul! And to set a Shaohua Mountain record, forming a Golden Core in just forty years.</p><p>If Thunderclap Sword Qi was already this powerful, how terrifying would the Sword Light Splitting divine ability of the fifth level be?  Thinking of this, Qin Sang's desire for Golden Core formation intensified, becoming even more urgent.</p><p>It was fortunate that the silver-robed man had fled first, creating a considerable distance between them. Otherwise, he would already be a corpse beneath Qin Sang’s sword.</p><p>Thunderclap Sword Qi!</p><p>It was actually Thunderclap Sword Qi!</p><p>The silver-robed man was terrified. He never imagined that his opponent would be a monster who had comprehended Thunderclap Sword Qi at the Foundation Establishment stage.</p><p>Throughout the entire Xiao Han Region cultivation world, according to ancient legends, only a handful of individuals had grasped Thunderclap Sword Qi at the Foundation Establishment stage, each of them renowned figures who left behind legendary tales.</p><p>By now, after traveling such a long distance, the Ebony Sword's momentum had weakened somewhat, yet its light remained dazzling, carrying the aura of death.</p><p>In his panic, the silver-robed man hurriedly threw out all the talismans from his storage pouch and simultaneously summoned a flower basket.</p><p>For a moment, various spells erupted, the air shimmering with colorful lights, a dazzling spectacle.  But against the Ebony Sword, these spells offered little resistance, shattered and swept aside like withered leaves.</p><p>"Another magical treasure!"</p><p>The silver-robed man's eyes widened. He felt like he was going insane.</p><p>His master, Daoist Jiupao, a genuine Golden Core cultivator and the leader of the third generation disciples of the Kuiyin Sect before its destruction, possessed only two magical treasures.</p><p>He himself had expended immense effort to gather the necessary spiritual materials to refine his own natal magical treasure.</p><p>His other magical treasure, the Ten Yama Banner, was an heirloom passed down from his ancestors.</p><p>This person, clearly a Foundation Establishment cultivator, not only wielded Thunderclap Sword Qi, but also possessed two magical treasures, and even more baffling, he could actually use them both.</p><p>When had he offended such a figure?</p><p>If he knew that within Qin Sang's storage pouch lay another incomplete magical treasure, requiring only the necessary materials to be restored, he might have coughed up blood.</p><p>The silver-robed man hastily activated the flower basket, from which streams of rainbow light shot out, creating a thousand streaks of auspicious light that hung in the sky, all entangling towards the Ebony Sword.</p><p>While the flying sword's power was waning, perhaps it could be momentarily blocked.</p><p>Just as the silver-robed man prepared to burn his essence blood to continue his escape, a shocking scene unfolded.</p><p>The Ebony Sword trembled slightly, and its emerald blade suddenly surged with a demonic blood-red hue.  A streak of blood light sprayed forth, striking the flower basket with pinpoint accuracy.</p><p>Touched by the blood light, the flower basket, as if contaminated by some sort of defilement, instantly lost its vibrant colors. The flowers withered, the basket was dyed blood red, its spiritual nature completely extinguished.</p><p>*Thud!*</p><p>The Ebony Sword pierced straight through the flower basket.</p><p>"What is this blood light?"</p><p>This thought flashed through the silver-robed man's mind before a sharp pain erupted in his chest. He looked down to see the Ebony Sword, having pierced through his spiritual energy and chest at some unknown point.</p><p>Blood splattered across the sky, his life extinguished.</p><p>On the solitary peak, Qin Sang waved his hand, erasing the lingering traces of the battle, then his figure flickered, soaring into the air.</p><p>In the midst of his actions, he glanced left and right. Numerous subtle auras emerged within this mountain range, clearly belonging to cultivators in seclusion who had been disturbed by the commotion caused by the Ebony Sword slaying the silver-robed man.</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't afraid of Foundation Establishment cultivators, but he was wary of attracting Golden Core cultivators from the nearby Heavenly Yin Pass. He wasn't arrogant enough to confront a Golden Core cultivator head-on.</p><p>That's why he didn't hesitate to utilize the Ebony Sword's Blood-Defiling Divine Light ability, aiming for a swift victory.</p><p>The Ebony Sword, having devoured the Infernal Blood Mulberry and gained the Blood-Defiling Divine Light ability, could even severely damage the spiritual nature of magical treasures. Dealing with a mere magical artifact was naturally a trivial matter.</p><p>Unfortunately, the Blood-Defiling Divine Light could only be used once before requiring time to recover.</p>
