      The shockwave created by the clashes blew sands up drifting in
                the sky. After the view cleared, the battle ring sank down in
                the ground and formed a perfect bowl shape. Bennett’s critical
                hit that quintupled the normal damage. However, none of them got
                any advantage after that exchange!
     </p>
     <div class="chapter-c">
     </div>
     <p class="calibre5">
      The two men danced with their punches and kicks that no one
                could follow, as if it was a violent battle between a snow-white
                dragon and a violet python, biting and tearing each other.
                Everyone backed off, Germinal and Six Nations alike, afraid that
                they would be sucked and torn in the battle.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      <em class="calibre7">
       What the hell! These two are wild beasts.
      </em>
      Han Xiao could not take his eyes off the fight. Both of them
                were Pugilists with all sorts of ability and skills, making
                their energy as dense as concrete. Each of them followed
                different disciplines of the Pugilist class. Bennett was
                tactical as his power was an accumulation battle experience.
                Every move had a purpose and was used at the perfect time.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      On the other hand, the leader’s style was savage, barbaric, and
                unpredictable, just like the color of his energy.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      The two beasts were clearly stronger than other high-level
                superhumans. With multiple special Molding Abilities and high
                attributes compared to the characters on the same level, they
                were both boss-level superhumans.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      <em class="calibre7">
       No wonder they are the stars of this planet.
      </em>
      Han Xiao’s eyes suddenly widened.
      <em class="calibre7">
       Bennett just used Flaming Will and increased his damage by
                  five times; the leader must have a skill that is as strong as
                  Flaming Will to block the damage.
      </em>
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Remembering the reward of the mission [The Traitor’s Ambush],
                Han Xiao was excited. He knew that a lot of hidden missions
                could give out powerful skill and abilities, and this mission
                was simple and straightforward. As long as they won the fight,
                he would have the chance to get a luxurious reward without
                spending too much time and thought.
     </p>
     <div class="chapter-c">
     </div>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Han Xiao and his teammates were fighting off the enemy on the
                side, and he was calculating the difference between him and the
                leader. In the end, Han Xiao concluded that the discrepancies
                between their power were too high. First of all, Han Xiao had
                already been in many battles, and he was not in his best form.
                With only Viper left, Han Xiao did not have enough equipment and
                weapons to survive a head-on fight against the leader.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      <em class="calibre7">
       With the number of weapons I have, I can at most get an even
                  trade between me and the leader even if I perform well.
                  Bennett will not allow me to do that…
      </em>
      Han Xiao sighed.
      <em class="calibre7">
       Then if I try to help Bennett and get in a two versus one
                  situation, I can’t surpass Bennett’s damage. Bennett also has
                  Flaming Will, and the damage is more disgusting than mine…
      </em>
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Han Xiao thought for a second and decided that the current
                situation was the best position that could be. If he let Bennett
                and the leader continue to fight each other, even though their
                fight was intense, they were not losing much health since both
                of them could parry or block each other’s damage. It would take
                time to find out who the victor of the battle was, and no one on
                either side had the intention of intervening with this battle
                between Bennett and the leader.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “At the end of the day, legends are still legends. The leader is
                stronger than any one of us here, and only Bennett can stop him.
                There’s no way we can help Bennett in that battle.” Tang Tang
                talked through the earpiece as he controlled the battlefield
                with the sandstorm.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Bennett was the strongest man in the era, and no one could deny
                the fact, even if they were arrogant and prideful on their own
                abilities.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “This is a war of attrition. We are in a stalemate right now,
                and the most powerful fighters are fighting each other. The
                outcome of this battle will change the course of the war,”
                Fazzad said as he released an energy shield, and everyone else
                agreed in silence.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Han Xiao heard the words and suddenly realized that this was the
                best change for him to finish the other mission.
      <em class="calibre7">
       If the current battle is a stalemate, then it means that they
                  are squeezing time for me to finish [The Ultimate Trial]! As
                  long as I get a class advancement, I will have the power to
                  take down the leader!
      </em>
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      With so many helpers around and even more enemies, this was the
                perfect chance to earn Trial Points!
     </p>
     <div class="chapter-c">
     </div>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Moreover, Han Xiao had found the right way to handle the battle.
                The bonus Trial Points were calculated after one went out of
                combat. From previous experience and calculation, Han Xiao could
                estimate the amount of bonus Trial Points he would get by
                looking at the number of enemies and allies. Then if he got a
                chance to go out of combat after killing sufficient enemies, he
                could reach the two-thousand-point mark with the bonus Trial
                Points!
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      The main mission was to defeat the leader and break out of the
                encirclement, yet it was not in conflict with finishing [The
                Ultimate Trial]. Han Xiao took the opportunity and executed his
                plan.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      The battle was intense, and Han Xiao’s allies suppressed the
                Germinal Organization with their higher battle power. There were
                often executive officers that would get injured, and through the
                battle information on the interface, Han Xiao spotted the
                executive officers that were low on health and get the last hits
                on those enemies, even stealing kills from his own teammate at
                times. Earning Trial Points had never been so easy before, and
                the rate quickly stacked up.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      If there were players witnessing this scene, they could tell
                that Han Xiao was just last hitting all the kills with only one
                eye open. However, the teammates were not players. Seeing that
                Han Xiao was only shooting some bullets on the side, they
                thought that Han Xiao was exhausted and in a bad shape.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      They originally thought that that Han Xiao was a powerful
                assistant, but it turned out that he had no place to be there.
                The reinforcements felt like they were babysitting Han Xiao.
                Diana, whose temper was as explosive as her Esper power, shouted
                at Han Xiao, “Hey, Black Phantom, you are not doing anything
                here. Just leave the superhumans to us and go fight off the
                normal troops.”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      If Black Phantom was in poor condition, the obvious solution was
                to let Han Xiao handle the minions. Diana’s suggestion seemed
                fine in front of everyone’s eyes, but Han Xiao ignored her
                command and continued his mission.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Everyone’s face switched. Their role in the battle suddenly
                changed from that statement. If Han Xiao disobeyed the commands,
                did that mean that he wanted to see the others fight with
                everything they had just to protect him?
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      <em class="calibre7">
       We should be teammates and stand side by side to fight the
                  battle. Moreover, we are your reinforcements, yet you act like
                  this is a game…
      </em>
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      All the team seemed annoyed at Han Xiao, and Diana was about to
                reproach Han Xiao before she was interrupted by an enemy’s
                attack. She grumbled in her heart,
      <em class="calibre7">
       He was a traitor of the Germinal Organization to begin with.
                  All he knows is to run around and hide, setting things up in
                  the dark to trigger the war. He indeed is a slippery and
                  treacherous man.
      </em>
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      At the same time, Han Xiao could not explain anything. He had to
                kill superhumans to get Trail Points, and this was the only
                change to turn the tide of the battle. To fight off minions was
                just a waste of talent, yet his allies did not know what he was
                happening. So, he could only remain silent, focus on his
                mission, and take all the complaints that his teammates had.
     </p>
     <div class="chapter-c">
     </div>
     <p class="calibre5">
      The war slowly approached the most heated stage. Time slowly
                became vague in the intense battle, and additional
                reinforcements arrived at the stage. Jaross and the other three
                executive officers joined the team fight, and Han Xiao and his
                team felt a sudden increase in pressure from the enemy. They
                tried to break through the encirclement, yet the enemy’s
                disgusting tactics denied them to chance do so. In the end, his
                team was trapped in the fishnet. However, the Germinal
                Organization also had to sacrifice uncountable soldiers and
                weapons to keep holding them back. Corpses and metal scraps were
                lying on the sand, slowly being covered up as wind and sand blew
                by.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Although the enemy troops could not deal a devastating blow to
                the superhumans to win the war, their firepower was as annoying
                as a flying bug, slowly chips away at the stamina and energy of
                the superhumans. Water droplets could wear away stone; many a
                little makes a mickle. In the end, injuries started to surface
                on Han Xiao’s allies, and everyone soon felt worn out.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Tang Tang and a summoner Esper were the target of the enemy. One
                had the power to control sandstorms, while the other could
                summon desert bugs and beasts—both of them were excellent at
                providing crowd control to the battle. The Germinal
                Organization’s executive officers successfully separated the
                summoner out of the team. They broke through Fazzad’s energy
                shield and took him down with a round of focus fire. The
                summoner had broken limbs, and blood spilled everywhere. The
                beasts who were no longer under control quickly ran away from
                the battle.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Everyone was alarmed. Once fatal injuries and deaths started to
                occur, it meant that the momentum of the battle slowly shifted
                to the other side. It was extremely likely for the enemy to
                snowball the lead.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Han Xiao quickly calculated his Trial Points in his heart.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      <em class="calibre7">
       At first there was around fifty executive officers, and an
                  additional twenty showed up. I’ve killed around thirty people,
                  and from the difference between our force and their force, I
                  just need another twenty Trial Points along with the bonus I
                  gain once I get out of combat to reach the two thousands
                  mark!
      </em>
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      At the same time, Tang Tang, who was right beside him, got hit
                by a force field attack from Jeross. Tang Tang kneeled down and
                pressed his chest. All the other executive officers charged
                toward him and attacked.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Seeing the deadly energy that would soon consume Tang Tang, Han
                Xiao used his field repulsion to push away Tang Tang, and the
                attacks flew past his shoulder.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Tang Tang escaped from the death as he shivered out of fear. He
                quickly turned around and thanked Han Xiao. “Thank you for
                saving me.”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Han Xiao nodded and looked around to find any other target.
                Suddenly, he saw the man wearing full plate armor with a large
                mechanical hammer in his hand, charging toward a pugilist like a
                rhino and swashing the hammer onto his head. At the same time,
                the executive officer returned some punches and shattered his
                chest armor. Both of them fell down and spat out blood at the
                same time.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      <em class="calibre7">
       Chance!
      </em>
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Han Xiao’s calm heart was suddenly excited. He instantly sniped
                the pugilist with [Flaming Will] and ended his life.

      Han Xiao tried to
                suppress his thrill and use all the energy on to the
                Electromagnetic Hover-boots and the mini maneuvering equipment.
                Without a second thought, he ran toward where the enemies were
                coming from, which was actually the weakest and safest area,
                without looking back.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      No one would expect one would go toward the enemy
                reinforcements, which was why it was the most defenseless area.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Han Xiao quickly left his teammates and instantly got out of
                combat.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Everyone was stunned!
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “Is he trying to escape by himself while leaving us to fight off
                the enemies?” Diana raged.
     </p>
     <div class="chapter-c">
     </div>
     <p class="calibre5">
      The leader was still being tied down by Bennett and could not
                get away from the fight. Seeing that his prey was getting away,
                he was pissed and shouted, “Chase after him!”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Jaross led some troops and chased after Han Xiao, and the
                pressure on the Six Nations’ superhuman lessened.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “Wait, maybe he is trying to divert the enemy’s forces and
                create an opening,” Tang Tang said quietly. “But if this fails,
                this will be the end of us. This is too reckless… he should have
                discussed with us beforehand.”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      After getting away from the battlefield, the enemies were still
                close behind Han Xiao. Han Xiao was zooming forward like
                lighting while counting down the time before his status was out
                of combat. After running away for five minutes, he saw another
                wave of reinforcements in front.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      He was trapped, and there was no escape.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      But Han Xiao smiled with his mouth wide open. The time wasted
                while he was escaping finally got him out of combat status, and
                the interface updated the bonus Trial Points that he had earned.
