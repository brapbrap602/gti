<h1></h1><p>This scene caught both races of experts completely by surprise.</p><p>After being hunted by the Rainbow Rat all the way, the white-robed man was gravely wounded and on the verge of death. They had thought this person was already at the end of his rope (with his lamp running out of oil), ripe for the picking. It seemed that he wasn't as fragile as they had imagined.</p><p>Looking at the person in the snow,</p><p>Qin Sang was secretly astonished.</p><p>He thought there was a treasure hidden here; unexpectedly, it was a person!</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang keenly noticed that the eyes of the others, both humans and demons, suddenly became fervent. His heart stirred slightly; it seemed that this person held some secret.</p><p>The white-robed man unexpectedly revealed himself.</p><p>The battlefield seemed to freeze for a moment.</p><p>He glanced around, the corners of his mouth curling up in a sneer. He raised his palm and said in an icy tone, "Aren't you looking for it? Take it!"</p><p>The white-robed man's palm held a square ice coffer.</p><p>The ice coffer was carved from profound ice, with dragon and phoenix carvings on its surface, and the light of restrictions flowed around it. It was exquisitely beautiful and quite extraordinary.</p><p>A treasure stored in such an ice coffer was definitely not ordinary!</p><p>Before his voice faded,</p><p>The white-robed man suddenly exerted force, flinging the ice coffer into the high sky.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>The ice coffer was enveloped in a white light, and its speed was astonishing. It actually headed straight for Qin Sang and Bifang, at a tricky angle.</p><p>The battlefield erupted in an uproar.</p><p>Not counting the white-robed man, five Core Formation stage cultivators and six Great Demon Kings were gathered on the small desolate island.</p><p>All were cunning and treacherous individuals.</p><p>They suspected that the white-robed man's action was a feint, using a fake treasure to lure the tiger away from the mountain (a diversion), creating an opportunity for himself to escape. But they also worried that the real treasure was in the ice coffer, and might be obtained by the other party.</p><p>Wind Master's expression shifted indeterminately.</p><p>Cunning Fox and Frog Fish had already approached the deep valley.</p><p>They weren't as troubled as Wind Master, and immediately decided to divide their forces.</p><p>The ice coffer had to be seized, and the person had to be kept behind!</p><p>Cunning Fox let out a sharp cry, its furry tail flicked, and it leaped up suddenly.</p><p>Frog Fish, on the other hand, stared intently at the white-robed man.</p><p>The others were not willing to be outdone and also took action to compete for it.</p><p>For a time, streaks of light flew wildly in mid-air.</p><p>Wind Master's movements were the fastest. His main body still rushed towards the deep valley, and his left arm shook lightly. A nearly transparent silk thread suddenly sprang up, shooting towards the ice coffer with a 'shua' sound.</p><p>The silk thread seemed slender and weak, but it was extremely nimble.</p><p>Seeing that the silk thread was about to touch the ice coffer, it was even faster than Cunning Fox.</p><p>An odd look flashed in Cunning Fox's eyes. Its mouth opened wide, though no sound could be heard, but circles of invisible sound waves rippled out, locking onto the silk thread!</p><p>Cunning Fox seemed to be able to solidify space, and the silk thread immediately sank as if into a muddy swamp, its speed plummeting and becoming stagnant.</p><p>Back then, if Qin Sang hadn't injured Cunning Fox with a preemptive strike, he probably would have had more trouble.</p><p>Affected by Cunning Fox, the silk thread failed to entangle the ice coffer. Wind Master was secretly annoyed, and frantically poured true essence into the silk thread. Immediately, a whip shadow lashed out fiercely, striking towards Cunning Fox.</p><p>Cunning Fox dared not take it head-on and was forced to evade.</p><p>The ice coffer, almost caught by Cunning Fox, was impacted by the aftershock. The white light shook, and its direction changed abruptly, flying towards Island Master Shen.</p><p>Annoyance flashed in Cunning Fox's eyes. Just as it was about to continue fighting for the ice coffer, a sense of trembling suddenly arose.</p><p>This feeling was all too familiar.</p><p>Cunning Fox's heart trembled, and its figure involuntarily paused.</p><p>'Crack!'</p><p>A bolt of Heavenly Lightning descended in front of Cunning Fox.</p><p>It was the *Thunder Manipulation Art* again!</p><p>However, this time Qin Sang's target wasn't the opponent, but the ice coffer!</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The ice coffer was struck squarely by the Heavenly Lightning. The hearts of everyone present couldn't help but jump violently at this scene, and they cursed Qin Sang inwardly for actually daring to make a move.</p><p>In case the treasure's characteristics were fragile, this one blow would turn everyone's efforts into a bubble.</p><p>The white light enveloping the ice coffer couldn't withstand the *Thunder Manipulation Art* and was split open by the lightning, revealing the body of the ice coffer. Amid the dazzling thunder, the ice coffer shattered in response, ice shards flying everywhere, revealing a piece of jade-white material.</p><p>"Snow-Veined Cold Jade..."</p><p>Qin Sang recognized the details of this thing at a glance and was greatly disappointed.</p><p>Snow-Veined Cold Jade is a type of Cold Jade, named for the snowflake-like patterns on its surface. It was indeed a rare treasure, and the quality of this Snow-Veined Cold Jade was also very high, but it wasn't enough to be desperately contested by so many experts.</p><p>And just as Qin Sang broke open the ice coffer, the desolate island suddenly shook violently.</p><p>Bone-chilling cold currents poured out of the deep valley continuously.</p><p>At this time, standing outside the island, one could clearly see a white ice stream spewing out from the ground, exploding in the air, turning into an extremely cold ice burst.</p><p>A terrifying shock wave spread out simultaneously.</p><p>Frog Fish, closest to the deep valley, was the first to bear the brunt. Sensing danger, it hurriedly spat out green light, turning it into a thin coat to protect its body.</p><p>The cold current poured out continuously, and the stone walls of the deep valley were collapsing, revealing dazzling white light inside, faintly revealing the outline of a spirit array.</p><p>It was the turn of spring and summer.</p><p>The desolate island entered winter early.</p><p>The ice burst was grand in scale, covering most of the desolate island.</p><p>Everything in sight was a stark white.</p><p>Spraying out with the cold current were dozens of identical ice coffers, like a celestial maiden scattering flowers, flying in different directions.</p><p>The figure of the white-robed man disappeared into thin air, merging into the ice burst.</p><p>The next moment, more than a dozen white-robed men appeared in everyone's field of vision, using the power of the cold current to rush in all directions.</p><p>It turned out that the white-robed man had arranged a contingency plan long ago.</p><p>The ice coffer he threw out was just a guise, and he didn't expect to trick many people away. It was just to stir up the situation even more, making it easier for him to escape.</p><p>For a time, ice and snow flew on the battlefield, a chaotic mess.</p><p>Demon Eagle and Demon Snake, Island Master Shen, and others couldn't care less about fighting and rushed towards the cold current.</p><p>If the white-robed man ran away, it would be like drawing water with a bamboo basket - all for naught (a complete waste of effort).</p><p>What good would it do them to fight to the death?</p><p>Bifang originally wanted to seize the first ice coffer, but seeing that there was only a piece of Snow-Veined Cold Jade inside, and that the white-robed man was trying to escape, he immediately chose to give up the Snow-Veined Cold Jade.</p><p>Although it wasn't clear what the white-robed man brought out of the Profound Heaven Palace, no matter how bad the Profound Heaven Palace was, it wouldn't use Snow-Veined Cold Jade as its treasure.</p><p>Qin Sang, on the other hand, didn't hold back and grabbed the Snow-Veined Cold Jade in his hand.</p><p>"It seems that the white-robed man has something better on him..."</p><p>His mind turned, thoughtfully looking in the direction of the cold current, his expression not at all flustered. He ordered the Heavenly Eye Butterfly to fully activate its divine power, to see through the white-robed man's tricks.</p><p>The white-robed man's methods could be called brilliant.</p><p>Ice coffers flew around everywhere, some real and some fake, a mix of illusion and reality.</p><p>Those avatars were also exceptionally agile, making it difficult to distinguish between illusion and reality.</p><p>If there were only one or two enemies, there was a good chance of being confused by the white-robed man, missing the opportunity.</p><p>Unfortunately, too many experts gathered on the desolate island. Facing so many people, this little trick seemed stretched thin, and in the blink of an eye, most of the phantoms were broken.</p><p>Qin Sang even more easily locked onto the true body of the white-robed man.</p><p>Bifang and others weren't as direct as the Heavenly Eye Butterfly, but their experience in fighting was also extremely rich, only one step slower than Qin Sang.</p><p>Just as Qin Sang was about to make a move and strike first, the Heavenly Eye Butterfly suddenly gave a warning, discovering an anomaly at the edge of the battlefield.</p><p>Everyone was fighting over each other in the ice burst.</p><p>The battlefield was in chaos.</p><p>The Rainbow Rat poked its head out from the cracks in the rocks, taking advantage of the chaos to dart out of the cracks. Its whole body seemed to be wrapped in ice spikes, merging with the ice burst. It quietly rushed out of the desolate island, actually concealing itself from everyone's eyes.</p><p>However, no matter how clever the concealment methods, under the divine power of the Heavenly Eye, nothing could escape.</p>
