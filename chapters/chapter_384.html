<h1>Chapter 377: The Black Jiao</h1><p>“Roar! Roar!”</p><p>Tiger roars shook the heavens.  Tiger-winged Eagles, alerted by the disturbance, took to the sky. Dozens of them soared upwards, roaring incessantly, like a massive dark cloud rolling in, demonic energy surging, their presence menacing.</p><p>Qin Sang, sensing this, his expression shifted slightly. He waved his hand, recalling the Yellow Sand Banner and hastily rolled up the bodies of Kong Xin and the other man.</p><p>He had intended to capture Kong Xin alive to refine him into a Corpse Soldier. However, with Yun Youzi present, it was inconvenient to openly refine a corpse. Thus, he deployed the Yellow Sand Banner as a cover, hoping to find an opportunity to do it discreetly.</p><p>Unfortunately, the Tiger-winged Eagles' senses were too keen. Moreover, Kong Xin had used some secret technique that made Qin Sang sense a faint trace of danger.  He had no choice but to activate the Ebony Sword and eliminate him.</p><p>Yun Youzi reacted no slower than Qin Sang.  He quickly summoned the Spirit Bamboo Flying Boat. The two boarded the boat and fled, taking turns piloting it. Finally, they shook off the Tiger-winged Eagles, found a secluded spot, and landed.</p><p>Qin Sang tossed out the bodies. The black-robed man's spine had been shattered by the Black Dragon Stone, his upper body a mangled mess.  Kong Xin, having used some unknown secret method, was a bloody pulp, his energy center severely damaged, unable to withstand the influx of baleful energy needed for becoming a Corpse Soldier.</p><p>Disappointed, Qin Sang searched the bodies, opening their storage pouches and spilling the contents onto the ground.</p><p>Yun Youzi took the blue sword while Qin Sang pocketed the Red Elixir, the Cold Gold Ore, and a few other valuable items. The rest were unremarkable.</p><p>However, two jade slips caught Qin Sang's attention.</p><p>Both contained maps, one from Kong Xin and the other from the black-robed man.</p><p>The map drawn by the black-robed man was most valuable for its markings of hidden routes and safe havens within the second level of Boundless Valley, more detailed than the one from the Heavenly Wind Pavilion.</p><p>Clearly, the black-robed man had spent considerable time in Boundless Valley to have explored so many places.</p><p>This map was invaluable, especially to them.</p><p>Upon hearing this, Yun Youzi was overjoyed. He took the map and compared it with the one from the Heavenly Wind Pavilion. He then selected a safer route that would save them at least a day's travel.</p><p>The other map was from Kong Xin's storage pouch.</p><p>Unlike the detailed routes on the other map, this one primarily marked the locations of various demonic beasts within Boundless Valley, including the size of their packs, territories, habits, and overall strength. The information was exceptionally detailed.</p><p>Such comprehensive information could not have been gathered without patient and meticulous investigation.</p><p>Curious as to why Kong Xin had recorded so much information about demonic beasts, Qin Sang searched further and found a demonic cultivation technique called the Blood Transformation Art. It then dawned on him.</p><p>The Blood Transformation Art, whose origins were unknown, required the blood essence of cultivators and demonic beasts for cultivation.</p><p>Qin Sang skimmed through the Blood Transformation Art, noting that because it relied on plundering the blood essence of others, the cultivation speed was incredibly fast.  However, because of this, the cultivator's foundation would be unstable, and their energy chaotic.  Cultivation would peak at the late Foundation Establishment stage, with the chances of forming a Gold Core practically nonexistent.</p><p>Anything that hindered Gold Core formation, no matter how powerful, was of no interest to Qin Sang.</p><p>Without practicing the Blood Transformation Art, its associated divine abilities were unusable. Qin Sang glanced over them briefly and put it away.</p><p>Compared to the Blood Transformation Art, the map intrigued Qin Sang more, even delighting him.</p><p>The map marked the lair of a Black Jiao, a demonic beast of peak Spirit Severing realm!  Furthermore, this Black Jiao was confirmed to possess true dragon bloodline!</p><p>Upgrading the Nine Dragons Chariot Talisman required the spirit essence of a peak Spirit Severing realm Jiao Dragon.</p><p>By refining another Jiao Dragon’s spirit essence, the speed of the Nine Dragons Chariot Talisman, even if not as fast as a Gold Core cultivator, would surpass that of a Pseudo Gold Core cultivator.</p><p>After obtaining the talisman, Qin Sang had searched far and wide, but demonic beasts with Jiao Dragon bloodlines were rare, let alone those at the peak Spirit Severing realm.</p><p>Even Mount Shaohua had no information on such a beast.</p><p>Unexpectedly, one was hidden within Boundless Valley.</p><p>The Black Jiao’s lair was located in a dark abyss within the second level of Boundless Valley.  The abyss was filled with dense ancient restrictions, making it an undeniably perilous place.</p><p>The Black Jiao remained within the abyss to cultivate, rarely venturing out. Qin Sang wondered how Kong Xin had discovered it.</p><p>According to Kong Xin's notes, the Black Jiao, having resided in the dark abyss for so long, was intimately familiar with the ancient restrictions within.  Fighting the Black Jiao in the abyss, even a powerful Pseudo Gold Core cultivator would struggle to gain the upper hand.  Furthermore, with the dense restrictions and narrow passages of the abyss, it would be difficult for reinforcements to flank the Black Jiao, allowing it to escape easily.</p><p>Qin Sang estimated that with his Ten Yama Needles, he might have a chance to capture the Black Jiao after reaching the Pseudo Gold Core realm. Before that, unless he found another method, the possibility was next to zero.</p><p>Carefully storing the jade slip, Qin Sang made a mental note of the Black Jiao. Once his strength permitted, he would return to slay the Jiao and collect its spirit.</p><p>The Kong Xin incident was but a minor detour.</p><p>Yun Youzi was self-deprecating. His intention was to avoid complications.  The healing medicine was their priority, and a smooth journey to their destination was ideal.</p><p>Who would have thought that the guide they hired for safety would be a treacherous individual with ulterior motives?</p><p>Fortunately, they had gained the Cold Gold Ore and other treasures, making the effort not entirely in vain.  After burning the bodies, Qin Sang and Yun Youzi adjusted their conditions to peak levels and set off.</p><p>From the Tiger-winged Eagles' nest to the restriction of the second level was a distance of several dozen miles.  The two proceeded cautiously, arriving at the restriction without incident.</p><p>Blocking their path was a pervasive, otherworldly light.  It stretched endlessly before them, above, below, and to the sides, like a wall of light barring their way.</p><p>The color of the light shifted constantly, resembling a rainbow descending from the sky, vibrant and multicolored.</p><p>The scene was breathtakingly beautiful, almost intoxicating.</p><p>However, this otherworldly light was the external manifestation of an ancient restriction, incredibly dangerous within, having claimed the lives of countless cultivators.</p><p>It had long been established in the cultivation world that such a vast and boundless light originated from a single ancient restriction. One could imagine the terrifying power it would unleash if triggered.</p><p>Fortunately, this ancient restriction was very stable. Having endured countless years, it had changed little. The paths into the valley discovered long ago remained safe.</p><p>Within the depths of the otherworldly light, dark cracks flickered, resembling the cracks in shattered glass, crisscrossing each other.</p><p>The path to the second level was hidden within these cracks.</p><p>The two observed their surroundings, ensuring there were no dangers, then revealed themselves.</p><p>Only a few paths could safely traverse the ancient restriction. At other times, there might be fellow travelers. Now, however, with the recent chaos in Boundless Valley, few cultivators capable of reaching this point remained.  With no one else around, they avoided further trouble.</p><p>Yun Youzi consulted the map, pointing to the thickest crack. "This is it!"</p>
