<h1>Chapter 883: Yin Yang Disc</h1><p>Chen and Fang Ting vanished outside the main hall.  Those remaining inside wore various expressions.</p><p>The four cultivators, including the man in blue robes, shared Chen's disapproval of Master Huayang's overbearing behavior. However, seeing the Sect Master's compromise and Chen's subsequent reprimand, no one dared to speak out.</p><p>The new disciples, lacking deep ties to the Smokewater Sect, felt great anticipation upon hearing Master Huayang's offer to recruit for the Azure Tortoise Sect.  Naturally, everyone sought better opportunities. Resources, companions, methods, and sacred grounds – in every aspect, the Azure Tortoise Sect surpassed the Smokewater Sect.</p><p>Master Huayang watched Fang Ting leave, then turned back to the remaining disciples with a look of waning interest.  His primary target had been core disciples like Fang Ting.  Having failed to secure her, the chances of finding another suitable candidate were slim.</p><p>Sect Master Qi's voice resounded, "Master Huayang, let's begin the test without delay. I've long wished to witness the power of the famed Yin Yang Disc of the Yin Yang lineage."</p><p>"Prepare the formation," Master Huayang instructed his attendant, retrieving a circular bronze disc from his storage pouch.</p><p>Slightly larger than an adult's palm, the disc's base and edges shimmered with an antique bronze luster. Dense, peculiar runes covered its surface.  Within the disc, a contrasting black and white yin-yang symbol, seemingly in perpetual slow rotation, induced a dizzying sensation, as if threatening to draw in one's soul.</p><p>Holding the Yin Yang Disc, Master Huayang chuckled at Sect Master Qi's words, "It is but a supplementary artifact, and incomplete at that.  Its power pales in comparison to your esteemed sect's treasure, the Watersmoke Screen."</p><p>"Master Huayang is too modest. While our Watersmoke Screen is indeed valuable, how can it compare to the supreme treasures of the Yin Yang lineage? Even this Yin Yang Disc is surely more than you suggest.  These new disciples are only at the Qi Refining stage.  Will entering the disc's influence pose any risk?" Sect Master Qi's voice held a note of concern.</p><p>"Rest assured," Master Huayang replied confidently, gesturing to his busy attendant. "I will only activate a small fraction of its power, protected by a calming formation.  There's no chance they'll become lost within. It won't harm them; rather, those with good comprehension may even benefit from enhanced mental fortitude."</p><p>Sect Master Qi chuckled, "Then I offer my thanks in advance, Master Huayang."</p><p>As they spoke, the attendant worked diligently at the hall's center.  Streams of light flowed from his palm to the floor, gradually forming an intricate spiritual array. A faint, milky white halo emanated from the formation, spreading throughout the hall.</p><p>A chorus of awed murmurs arose. Bathed in the halo, the new disciples felt themselves drawn into a state of tranquil relaxation.</p><p>"Enter!" Master Huayang smiled faintly, flicking the Yin Yang Disc into the air above the formation's center.  He then called out, rousing the entranced disciples, "All of you, sit within the spiritual array..."</p><p>The disciples eagerly rushed into the formation.  With a flicker of his eyes, the disguised cultivator also joined them, finding a spot to sit.</p><p>"Focus your minds, eliminate all distractions!  Do not be afraid of what you see; the calming formation will protect you from harm. Remember, you have only the time of one incense stick.  Strive with all your might to grasp what you perceive…" Master Huayang's voice resonated, though his final words were enigmatic.</p><p>Master Huayang's expression turned serious as he pointed at the Yin Yang Disc.  With a hum, the yin-yang symbol began to spin rapidly. The two opposing forces accelerated, transforming into black and white beams of light that shot into the formation. As they neared the disciples, they softened, merging into a hazy gray mist that enveloped the figures of the new disciples, obscuring them from view.</p><p>Silence returned to the hall.  Master Huayang, simultaneously manipulating the formation and the disc, observed the disciples, awaiting the results.</p><p>The disguised cultivator found himself immersed in a sea of white mist.  He remained wary, concerned about the Skyeye Butterfly.  If the disc's power forced it to reveal itself, they would be in danger.</p><p>"Fortunately, Master Huayang is cautious about harming these disciples, only using a small portion of the artifact's power.  It's not enough to affect the Skyeye Butterfly…"  He relaxed slightly, beginning to observe his surroundings.</p><p>He felt like a wandering spirit adrift in the void.  Below him stretched emptiness, with no solid ground in sight, surrounded on all sides by the pale mist.</p><p>"Grasp what you perceive…" Recalling Master Huayang's words, he reached out, grasping at a wisp of the white mist.  When he opened his hand, it vanished, confirming that the scene was illusory.</p><p>Everywhere he looked, only illusion remained. He was truly trapped, with no escape route. Yet, his expression remained calm. He slowly scanned his surroundings, taking in every detail, gradually understanding the situation.</p><p>A Qi Refining cultivator, facing this scenario, would be helpless, left to await Master Huayang's deactivation of the Yin Yang Disc.  However, the disguised cultivator, despite his ninth-level Qi Refining cultivation, possessed the insight of a Core Formation cultivator.  Master Huayang's cultivation was merely comparable to his true self.  A small fraction of the artifact's power, manifested as an illusion, couldn't trap him.</p><p>"What to grasp? The only tangible thing here is the Yin Yang Disc's energy!" The disguised cultivator realized the nature of the test.  "Low-level cultivators cannot see through illusions.  Searching aimlessly in this vast space, they won't grasp the Yin Yang energy. Only those with an innate sensitivity to it, with their senses obscured, can find it through some inexplicable intuition.  The Yin Yang lineage's requirements are truly stringent…"</p><p>Having grasped the essence of the test, he stood still in the void, closing his eyes, sensing the subtle flow of the white mist.</p><p>Soon, a look of delight crossed his face. He opened his eyes abruptly, locking onto a direction, and shot off.</p><p>Outside the formation, within the main hall, silence reigned as time slowly passed.  More than half of the incense stick had burned away. The disciples within the formation displayed various emotions – anxiety, frustration – yet none had awakened.</p><p>Master Huayang watched the youth with three spiritual roots, pinning some hope on him.  But seeing the boy's panicked demeanor, he shook his head, a flicker of disappointment in his eyes.</p>
