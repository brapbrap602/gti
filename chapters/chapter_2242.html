<h1>Chapter 2232: Stone and Fire</h1><p>“I have no right to know the whereabouts of such powerful beings, but rumor has it that the city’s great array was built by one of them.  Just know that we are under their protection,”</p><p>The envoy’s tone was full of pride.</p><p>The cultivators agreed.  An elder surnamed Zhou sighed, “Friend, you are right.  But when will we have the chance to witness the magnificence of these beings?”</p><p>“That is difficult. I have been stationed in Yongtu City for many years and have never seen them. Perhaps only when the other races attack will they reveal themselves,”</p><p>The envoy pointed west, “Rumor has it they are all in silent cultivation at Mount Ling.”</p><p>“Mount Ling?”</p><p>Elder Zhou questioned.</p><p>Qin Sang behind him pricked up his ears.</p><p>Could it be the Buddhist Mount Ling?</p><p>In the present world, Mount Ling is located in the West, a sacred place of Buddhism. Master Lechen had mentioned it before, regretting his inability to make a pilgrimage there.</p><p>“Precisely! Legend says Mount Ling is the greatest sacred mountain in the world, where one can directly speak with the gods. Ten Great Celestial Witches once resided there, representing the gods and shepherding the people…”</p><p>The envoy recounted a legend, some parts of which even Elder Zhou hadn't heard.</p><p>The cultivators listened intently.</p><p>Qin Sang compared the legend with the present world. If the Buddhist Mount Ling was this mountain, it should have been a sacred place of the Witch Tribe or another ancient race. He wondered how it fell into the hands of Buddhism.</p><p>He had always wanted to determine which place in the real world corresponded to the illusionary realm.</p><p>If this mountain was that mountain, they must be located between the Western lands and the Great Zhou. The prosperous Great Zhou was currently under the control of the demon race.</p><p>Entering Yongtu City, the envoy pointed to three peaks, “These three mountains are unclaimed. You may establish your caves within them.”</p><p>The cultivators expressed their thanks.</p><p>The envoy continued, “You cannot simply enjoy protection without contributing. You must provide personnel for regular patrols. And you cannot retreat in the face of any danger to the city!”</p><p>“We understand!” the cultivators replied solemnly.</p><p>The envoy nodded with satisfaction, “Do not worry too much. Compared to other cities, Yongtu City is the safest.”</p><p>“Oh? What do you mean?” Elder Zhou curiously asked.</p><p>The envoy pointed east, “Because bordering Yongtu City is the Phoenix Clan. The Phoenix embody the Five Virtues and are not as cruel as other races. Even now, with the other races ostracizing us humans, if the Phoenix Clan truly wanted to kill us, frankly, none of you would have survived to reach this place.”</p><p>The cultivators fell silent, cold sweat dripping down their backs.</p><p>Master Tongshen finally chose a hillside surrounded by bamboo forest; his disciples were all satisfied.</p><p>They worked diligently, building halls and enshrining their ancestors.</p><p>Master Tongshen called his four disciples, “Come, let's go for a walk.”</p><p>The disciples were delighted.</p><p>The five of them left the bamboo forest and slowly flew along the mountainside. It was like entering the mortal world—bustling and lively.</p><p>The biggest difference was the many strange-looking members of other races who lived peacefully alongside humans without any racial prejudice.</p><p>Master Tongshen took them to a place resembling a market, instructing them, “I’ll buy some things; explore the area, but don't wander too far.”</p><p>Seeing Master Tongshen enter a wooden building, Qin Sang wanted to explore independently, but Qinghong pulled him back, forcing him to stay with the group.</p><p>Qinghong occasionally teased him and Miss Shuang.  Qin Sang remained calm, while Miss Shuang still blushed slightly, but they were used to it, like siblings, no longer embarrassed.</p><p>“Will Clan Chief Yuanxiang be in the city?”</p><p>Qin Sang saw two Zhuyan race members leave a shop, mounting fire clouds and soaring into the air.</p><p>“Deep-eyed race…that one seems to be from the Shengyu race…a merfolk girl not in the sea, has also fallen here…”</p><p>Qin Sang looked around, trying to find familiar objects on each member of the other races he saw, but to no avail.</p><p>“What are you looking at, so engrossed?”</p><p>Qinghong and Miss Shuang followed Qin Sang’s gaze, seeing a group of attractive merfolk girls.</p><p>“The rumors are true; the merfolk women are indeed beautiful,” Senior Qingyan scratched his head, chuckling.</p><p>“You two are such perverts!”</p><p>Qinghong scoffed, Miss Shuang giggled.</p><p>Qin Sang quickly approached a shop, took a black stone from the rack in front, haggled for a price, bought it, and then declared to the others, “What were you saying just now?”</p><p>Qinghong paused, “What are you going to do with that sooty black stone?”</p><p>“It has its uses, of course,” Qin Sang said mysteriously.</p><p>In reality, the stone wasn't a particularly precious high-grade spiritual material. It was a Void-Calling Stone, one of the materials used in later times to refine芥子法器 (Jiezi Faqi - a type of magical artifact).</p><p>Qin Sang, a master artificer, was tired of his cramped storage device and decided to craft his own.</p><p>...</p><p>As twilight fell, the five disciples returned to the bamboo grove.  Qin Sang's search for an old acquaintance proved fruitless, but he did purchase some medicinal herbs.</p><p>"You may all leave."</p><p>Master Tong Shen dismissed Qing Yan and the others, keeping only Qin Sang.</p><p>"When I took you on as my disciple, I never imagined you'd reach the Golden Core stage in just a few years. I'm not boasting, but you must feel the same confidence.  I've never encountered such talent..."</p><p>The Golden Core stage was mentioned in ancient texts, but it wasn't specifically defined as a realm.  Qin Sang discovered through conversations that not all cultivation methods involved this stage; some practitioners maintained a liquid-like energy sea, directly progressing to the Nascent Soul stage.</p><p>On the way to Yongtu City, Master Tong Shen arranged for a private furnace to be built for Qin Sang on the spirit boat and gave him unwavering support in his cultivation.</p><p>Qin Sang made rapid progress, quickly achieving the Golden Core stage, reflecting on how much easier it had been compared to the past.</p><p>Master Tong Shen strictly instructed Qing Hong and the others not to spread the news, as it would cause a great uproar.</p><p>"Your next step will be choosing your path. With your talent, it shouldn't take long. I've been hesitant for years, but it's time to make a decision. I've decided to have you cultivate the 'Water and Fire Harmony' technique!" Master Tong Shen declared.</p><p>Qin Sang had been eagerly awaiting this day. He bowed, saying, "Disciple will follow Master's instructions!"</p><p>"However, before that, I need to get you something," Master Tong Shen changed his tone.  "You've read the 'Water and Fire Harmony' technique, so you should remember that it requires simultaneous cultivation of water and fire. Our sect only has water-based techniques. Besides cultivating a fire-based technique, the secret technique offers a convenient method: absorbing external fire to cultivate internal fire.  This will allow you to cultivate water and fire simultaneously, both internally and externally. However, this method is extremely dangerous..."</p><p>Qin Sang certainly remembered; it was one of the reasons he was so excited.</p><p>For absorbing external fire, he actually had a better technique: the 'Fire Seed Golden Lotus'.</p><p>The two techniques were not conflicting; he could completely use the 'Fire Seed Golden Lotus' to subdue the spiritual fire, and then cultivate the 'Water and Fire Harmony' technique.</p><p>If he weren't still reliant on Master Tong Shen's support, Qin Sang would have already left the sect to cultivate independently.</p><p>The only problem was finding a superior spiritual fire.</p><p>Judging by Master Tong Shen's tone, he seemed to know of a spiritual fire.</p><p>"When I obtained the secret manual, I also saw the cave dwelling owner's record of a spiritual fire. This fire is called the 'Stone Womb Fire', a unique heavenly fire nurtured within a certain hidden realm. When that senior cultivator discovered it, the Stone Womb Fire was not yet mature. That senior cultivator didn't forcibly take the Stone Womb Fire; instead, they set up restrictions around it. These restrictions not only protect the Stone Womb Fire from outside interference, but also subtly influence it, reducing the backlash when it's eventually subdued. If I had been the first to obtain the secret manual, the Stone Womb Fire should still be there, and it would be mature by now..."</p><p>Master Tong Shen glanced towards the mountain. "I'll volunteer to join the city guard and find an opportunity to take you to obtain the spiritual fire."</p><p>"Disciple dares not!"</p><p>Qin Sang repeatedly said, "Master refining that Stone Womb Fire will surely break through his bottleneck! Master's cultivation is the most important thing; I will find other spiritual fires later, please reconsider, Master!"</p><p>Master Tong Shen patted Qin Sang's head, noticing that Qin Sang was no longer the young boy of the past, even taller than himself. He sighed, "My disciple has grown up! Such a unique heavenly fire is a rare occurrence; using it on me would be a waste.  My disciple has extraordinary talent and a limitless future; only you are worthy of this fire."</p><p>"But..."</p><p>"What?  Do you not heed your master's words?"</p><p>Master Tong Shen feigned anger.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang speechless, Master Tong Shen waved his hand. "Go now! Since you understand my intentions, you must cultivate diligently and not disappoint me."</p><p>"Yes! Disciple takes his leave!"</p><p>Qin Sang left the hall.</p><p>Master Tong Shen immediately prepared a furnace room for him. Qin Sang entered the room, recalling his conversation with his master. Touching the warm earth fire furnace, he murmured softly, "It was only an illusion."</p><p>He shook his head, sat cross-legged in front of the furnace, took out the Void Calling Stone, separated a portion, and refined it into powder. Then, he took out several spiritual materials, refined them one by one, and threw them into the earth fire.</p><p>The various materials tumbled in the flames, the firelight illuminating Qin Sang's face.</p><p>Soon, the materials began to gather in the center, gradually forming the shape of a bracelet, mimicking the black bracelet on Qin Sang's hand.</p><p>For Qin Sang, refining such an item didn't require much effort.  He was even thinking about other things.</p><p>As the black bracelet neared completion, Qin Sang suddenly made a soft sound of surprise. "Failure?"</p><p>He summoned the black bracelet before him. The shape was complete, but it wasn't a storage device.</p><p>"What's going on?"</p><p>Qin Sang was quite surprised.  Even refining this kind of artifact could fail? Would his lifelong reputation be ruined?</p><p>Fortunately, Qin Sang had prepared plenty of materials. He cut off a piece and continued refining. This time, he put aside all distractions and focused intently.  Yet, it failed again!</p><p>Qin Sang realized something was wrong. He relentlessly continued, firing the furnace repeatedly, only to experience consecutive failures.</p><p>His expression grew serious. He sensed something was amiss. Was it a problem with the materials, or with the illusory realm itself?</p><p>Everything here felt so real, yet the simplest refining technique was failing.</p><p>If he could find the reason, perhaps he could use it to unravel the secrets of the illusion.</p><p>Where exactly was the problem?</p><p>Qin Sang picked up the remaining materials, examining them repeatedly, certain he hadn't made a mistake.</p><p>"Could it be a problem with the refining method?"</p><p>A thought flashed through Qin Sang's mind.</p><p>This refining method became widespread in later generations, easily learned even by ordinary refiners.  Yet, in ancient times, with so many powerful cultivators, even gods, could none of them comprehend it?</p><p>That seemed far-fetched. From ancient times to the present, had not only the various races taken turns as the protagonists of the Great Thousand World, but had the Great Thousand World itself undergone drastic changes?</p><p>Qin Sang tossed the last piece of Huan Kong Stone into the furnace.  Unsurprisingly, it failed again.</p><p>He hesitated. If he continued down this path, what if the truth was unrelated to the illusion, and he wasted his time?</p><p>Over the next period, Qin Sang tried various modern refining methods, all failing. He felt something crucial was missing, something that could transform these materials.</p><p>What exactly was it?</p><p>Qin Sang realized he hadn't deeply considered this question.  It was common knowledge in the present day, something refiners took for granted.</p><p>…</p><p>The master and disciples settled in Yongtu Immortal City.</p><p>Qin Sang often left his cave dwelling, wandering about, searching for "old friends."</p><p>Master Tong Shen, as promised, joined the city guard.</p><p>This was the price for settling in the city.  Master Tong Shen alone wasn't enough; the sect had to send another person, and Senior Brother Qing Yan readily volunteered.</p><p>Under the protection of their sect, Qin Sang could focus on cultivation.</p><p>A year passed in a flash.</p><p>Qin Sang and the others had adapted to life in the city.</p><p>"Junior Brother, Junior Sister, Master and Senior Brother are back!"</p><p>Qin Sang heard his senior sister Qing Hong's joyful call.  Emerging from his quiet chamber, he saw two figures descending from the sky.</p><p>"Master!"</p><p>Qing Hong anxiously asked, "Did you encounter any danger this time?"</p><p>Master Tong Shen, having joined the city guard, quickly took on important responsibilities, overseeing the relocation of commoners living outside the city to the rear.</p><p>Between the Phoenix Clan territory and Yongtu Immortal City lay a vast region inhabited by countless commoners.</p><p>While certain the Phoenix Clan wouldn't tolerate the slaughter of commoners, they would inevitably be affected if a war broke out in the cultivation world.  These commoners, while lacking powerful strength, were the seeds that preserved their lineage.</p><p>"The trip went smoothly," Master Tong Shen looked at Qin Sang. "Qing Feng, come with me."</p><p>Qin Sang followed Master Tong Shen into the hall, a premonition forming in his heart.  "Master, are we going to retrieve the Stone-Womb Fire?"</p><p>"Indeed, I've located it!  Next time we transport commoners, I'll take you to subdue it. How well have you grasped the Water-Fire Harmony chapter?" Master Tong Shen asked.</p><p>"I've basically mastered what you taught me, Master," Qin Sang replied.</p><p>Master Tong Shen nodded, sighing. "Unfortunately, the restrictions left by the predecessor have merged with the Stone-Womb Fire, making it impossible to take it away. We must refine it on the spot. Ideally, I'd wait until your cultivation was higher, but I'm worried the Golden Eagle Clan will discover the predecessor's cave and find out about this fire.  It's better sooner than later, even if it means you'll face some risk."</p><p>"Disciple will not disappoint Master!"</p><p>Qin Sang had studied the Water-Fire Harmony chapter countless times, and with the Fire Seed Golden Lotus as a backup, he was naturally confident.</p>
