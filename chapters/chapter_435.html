<h1>Chapter 428: Trade Fair</h1><p>The cultivators of the Small Cold Region, lacking a strong fighting spirit, missed the best opportunity to pursue the Heavenly March Alliance cultivators. After a brief exchange of blows, they separated.</p><p>Without his magical treasures, Qin Sang's strength would be greatly diminished. He could only let the Heavenly March Alliance cultivators escape.</p><p>Qin Sang regrouped with the Small Cold Region cultivators and confirmed their identities. He learned that they weren't assigned to the same mission, but rather were attending a secret trade fair.</p><p>Unexpectedly, after the trade fair concluded, they encountered the infiltrating Heavenly March Alliance cultivators, which led to the fight.</p><p>No wonder the battle was so disorganized.</p><p>Fortunately, they were not far from the trade fair location at the time and hadn't dispersed too much. Otherwise, they wouldn't have lasted this long against the Heavenly March Alliance's divide-and-conquer tactics.</p><p>Qin Sang was well aware that with so many cultivators gathered in the Cloudmist Great Marsh, secret trade fairs were inevitable.  However, he had been in secluded cultivation and hadn't had the time to seek them out.</p><p>Presented with this opportunity, Qin Sang naturally wouldn't let it pass. He immediately inquired about the trade fair.</p><p>The secret trade fair wasn't large. After this exposure, the location was no longer safe. Shaken, they didn't plan to organize another trade fair anytime soon. However, Qin Sang learned the location of another trade fair from one of the cultivators.</p><p>This trade fair's location was very secretive, opening once every three months, and requiring a token for entry.</p><p>This trade fair was quite large, with a mixed crowd of righteous cultivators, demonic cultivators, and rogue cultivators, mostly at the Foundation Establishment stage. Many good items could be found there.</p><p>Grateful for Qin Sang's assistance, the cultivator gifted him his trade fair token.  After verifying the trade fair's authenticity, Qin Sang frequented it, occasionally finding items of interest.</p><p>Tomorrow was the day of the next trade fair.</p><p>Qin Sang emerged from seclusion. His aura was even more stable than two years prior.</p><p>Instructing Xie Ying to watch over the medicinal garden, Qin Sang flew out of the restrictive formation. After orienting himself, he concealed his form and flew southwest towards the water region.</p><p>Through channels at the trade fair, Qin Sang had a general understanding of the latest developments in the Small Cold Region and the Heavenly March Alliance.</p><p>Currently, fighting was occurring in both the Cloudmist Great Marsh and the southern Sky Severing Mountains. However, there were no signs of a major war. Both sides were exercising restraint. The strongest combatants on the battlefield were only at the False Core Formation stage. No Core Formation stage or higher cultivators were known to have participated.</p><p>However, it was rumored that Core Formation cultivators from various sects had arrived in the Cloudmist Great Marsh, gathering together and secretly controlling the situation's development. They held considerable authority, recognized by all major sects.</p><p>They could conscript disciples from any sect, and no one could disobey, or they would be treated as traitors.</p><p>Many disciples from Mount Shaohua had been conscripted.</p><p>This type of conflict wasn't unprecedented. It seemed to follow a fixed pattern.</p><p>Both sides primarily focused on sending agents into each other's territory to sabotage vital locations like spirit stone mines and medicinal gardens or ambush lone cultivators, thoroughly muddying the waters of the Cloudmist Great Marsh.</p><p>Only a few smaller sects were caught in the crossfire.</p><p>Whether infiltrating the Heavenly March Alliance or patrolling the border, casualties were inevitable.  Comparatively, Qin Sang found his assignment to be quite favorable.</p><p>Seeing that things wouldn't truly escalate in the near future, Qin Sang felt reassured. He would wait for the spirit herbs in the garden to mature, complete the task assigned by Qi Yuanhu, and then decide where to go next.</p><p>It was best to avoid the heart of the conflict.</p><p>Although his strength surpassed that of cultivators at the same stage, he couldn't reveal his magical treasures. Moreover, once caught in a chaotic battle, the situation could become unpredictable, and even magical treasures couldn't guarantee his safety.</p><p>Fortunately, with Qi Yuanhu as his backing, he didn't have to worry about being used as cannon fodder.</p><p>Qin Sang flew low over the water, his speed unhurried. It took him a full day to reach the vicinity of the trade fair.</p><p>The terrain in this area was unique. Countless large and small rocky islands were scattered across a vast expanse, like stars in the night sky. Unfortunately, the spiritual energy was extremely thin, and the underground spiritual veins were meager, making them unsuitable for cave dwellings.</p><p>These barren rocky islands, however, were excellent hiding places for trade fairs.</p><p>Qin Sang's figure flashed as he landed on a deserted island. After observing for a moment, he retrieved a jade compass from his Mustard Seed Pouch. A drop of blood-red liquid rested in the center of the compass.</p><p>The moment Qin Sang took out the compass and touched the blood droplet with spiritual energy, it seemed to be pulled by some force, gradually elongating into a thin blood needle. No matter how Qin Sang rotated the compass, it always pointed in the same direction.</p><p>Holding the compass, Qin Sang's figure flashed, streaking towards the direction indicated by the blood needle.</p><p>As Qin Sang flew, the blood needle gradually shortened, finally returning to a droplet shape.  At that moment, Qin Sang was directly above a rocky island. He looked down.</p><p>The island was small, only a few meters across.  The entire island was composed of stone, devoid of vegetation. Eroded by the lake water, the stones were covered in moss, their bases stained a bluish-black.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't detect any traces of restrictive formations on the island, but upon closer inspection, he noticed something unusual about one of the stones.</p><p>It was a mundane mechanism.</p><p>Such a mechanism would be easily revealed by a cultivator's spiritual sense, but it was more effective for concealment in this location than a restrictive formation.</p><p>Qin Sang landed in front of the stone and pressed his hand against a specific spot a few times. A clicking sound followed, and the center of the stone parted, revealing a stone staircase.</p><p>The staircase wound downwards.  Reaching the end of the stairs, Qin Sang stood before an area of darkness. Suddenly, a low voice called out from within: “Who's there?”</p><p>“Cough!”</p><p>Now wearing a cloak, Qin Sang coughed lightly, his voice raspy. "I've come for the trade fair. This is my token."</p><p>As he spoke, Qin Sang raised his hand, displaying the compass.</p><p>A moment later, Qin Sang sensed spiritual formation fluctuations emanating from the darkness. A cultivator wearing a tiger-head mask emerged, nodded slightly towards Qin Sang, and gestured inwards.  "Fellow Daoist, please enter!"</p><p>He said no more.</p><p>Qin Sang knew these people's temperaments and remained silent, stepping into the darkness. After a few steps, a flash of light engulfed him, and he found himself in a stone chamber.</p><p>Pushing open the stone chamber's door, he entered a spacious hall.  The hall was simple, clearly hastily created with spiritual power.</p><p>The trade fair lasted only a day, and the next one would be held in a different location.</p><p>Dozens of cultivators had already gathered in the hall, most of them squatting on the ground like mortals, haggling.</p><p>This trade fair was quite renowned in the area, and more people would arrive later. Each time it opened, at least a hundred cultivators would attend.</p><p>The hall had no exits.  Around the perimeter were numerous identical stone chambers sealed with restrictive formations where private transactions took place.</p><p>There was a second level below.</p><p>Qin Sang's appearance attracted many gazes, some looking at him with anticipation.</p><p>However, Qin Sang hadn't come for the trade fair.  After a quick glance, finding nothing of interest, he withdrew his gaze, selected a stone chamber, and stepped inside.</p>
