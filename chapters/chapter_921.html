<h1>Chapter 913: Jade Water Body</h1><p>Three figures, one man and two women, sat on the flying shuttle, glancing nervously behind them as if pursued by something terrifying.  The man, a scholar, was pale, clutching his chest and coughing violently, clearly injured. The two women, a middle-aged beauty and a fifteen-year-old girl who looked remarkably alike, were likely mother and daughter. They appeared to be a family.</p><p>The shuttle was piloted by the middle-aged woman and the scholar, both Foundation Establishment cultivators.  Their frantic state was puzzling. The woman was also in poor condition, her spiritual energy nearly depleted, barely sustaining the flight. The girl, a Qi Refinement cultivator, anxiously supported the scholar, weeping softly, unable to offer much help.</p><p>“Cough… cough…”</p><p>The scholar coughed violently, spitting out blood, his face paling further. The shuttle lurched, nearly plunging into the sea. The woman cried out, gritting her teeth, overextending her spiritual energy to maintain control.</p><p>“Father…”</p><p>Terrified, the girl sobbed, channeling her meager spiritual energy into her father to ease his injuries, a futile gesture given her low cultivation.</p><p>“Senior Brother, your injury…”</p><p>Having stabilized the shuttle, the woman asked anxiously.</p><p>“It’s nothing,” the scholar waved dismissively. “I was struck in the chest; the blood clot has finally broken. I feel much better now.  But Little Sister, take a restorative pill and give me control of the shuttle. We need you to help us escape that fiend…”</p><p>Swallowing his blood, the scholar looked ahead. In the distance, he saw a small island, unlike the desolate surrounding isles;  vibrant, strange mists hung in the air, obscuring shadowy figures.</p><p>“That must be the Poison Island; the miasma and the Corrosive Winged Hawks are there!”</p><p>His face brightened, he produced a jade bottle containing three dark pills.  A foul odor wafted upon opening the lid.  Undeterred, the scholar gave a pill to his wife and daughter, urging them to take it. "These Yin Toad Pills will allow you to blend into the miasma and resist the hawks’ poison for a short time."</p><p>The woman and girl obeyed. The scholar gazed at them with deep affection, quickly suppressing it.  "Little Sister, once we land, we split up. Your Red Tassel Veil conceals your presence. The miasma will help you hide from him.  Take Ying'er and flee at the first opportunity."</p><p>“Brother, no…”</p><p>The woman’s face fell, but the scholar cut her off.</p><p>“Little Sister!”  He looked her in the eye. “Escaping to the Crackwind Islands, we knew this day might come. I’ve lived a longer life than most; I’m content. The Yin Toad Pills only protect us from the miasma and weaker hawks. But we’ve alerted the Core Formation fiend; he likely has similar defenses. We must lure the Corrosive Winged Hawk King to distract them; there's no other way to escape.  You're strong and resolute; don't let emotion cloud your judgment…"</p><p>Before he could finish, the girl sobbed uncontrollably. "Father! Mother! It's all my fault!  Send me back; maybe he wants me as a disciple…"</p><p>“Nonsense,”</p><p>The scholar embraced his daughter, stroking her back, his face etched with sorrow. With a gentle but firm pressure, he rendered her unconscious and handed her to his wife.</p><p>“Little Sister, take care of yourself and Ying’er.”</p><p>Tears streamed down the woman’s face. She held her daughter tightly, nodding reluctantly under the scholar’s intense gaze.</p><p>The scholar’s expression softened. He smiled faintly. "Little Sister, rest assured, I will survive and rejoin you…"</p><p>He didn't specify a meeting place, and the woman seemed to forget to ask.</p><p>A heavy silence fell over the shuttle.  Soon, they reached the island. The woman retracted the shuttle into her palm.  They exchanged a look, then flew towards the island.</p><p>Suddenly, a deafening roar echoed from afar. A swirling mass of dark grey wind, like a monstrous wave, relentlessly advanced towards them.</p><p>"No good! They're really after Du Dao, and they've already landed!" an elderly man among the group exclaimed, his face paling.  He was surrounded by four other cultivators, all at the Foundation Establishment stage.  Fear flickered in their eyes as they grimly assessed the situation. One of them spoke, "Du Dao is infested with not only flocks of Corrupted Winged Hawks, but possibly a demon king as well! Those three are courting death, and we won't follow them to their graves. Luckily, we noticed their suspicious movements beforehand and alerted the Cave Master. He should be arriving soon..."</p><p>Before he could finish, a cold snort cut through the air. "A bunch of useless fools! You can't even stop two injured people, forcing me to come personally.  You almost ruined my plans!  Immediately follow me to the island to capture them. That girl is my intended vessel, and if anything happens to her, I'll flay you all alive!"</p><p>Terror etched itself onto their faces as they saw a faint figure effortlessly glide past them, flashing towards Du Dao.</p><p>"The Cave Master ordered us to go to the island as well. If we get poisoned, we're as good as dead…" someone cried out anxiously.</p><p>The others looked equally distressed. One sighed, "The Cave Master has given his orders. Who dares disobey? Compared to facing his wrath, I'd rather be poisoned to death on that island."</p><p>A collective shudder ran through the group. The old man spoke gravely, "Fellow cultivator Wu is right. This woman possesses the Water Jade physique, which is said to greatly enhance cultivation of water-type techniques. While not a top-tier spiritual body, it's still quite rare. The Cave Master's demonic cultivation techniques mention this specific type of vessel.  Since she's been found, there's no chance he'll let her go. We only have ourselves to blame for letting the couple escape. They cultivated a joint technique, and their combined strength unexpectedly overwhelmed us. I have some antidote pills here, their efficacy is moderate, but they should protect you from the lower-level Corrupted Winged Hawks' poison cloud. As for the Hawk King… I doubt the Cave Master will let us face it…"</p><p>They exchanged glances, powerless to change the situation.  They could only obey. Each thanked the elder, accepted a pill, and swallowed it.</p>
