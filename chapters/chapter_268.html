<h1>**Chapter 261: Jade Dragon Chariot Rune**</h1><p>**Chapter 261: Jade Dragon Chariot Rune**</p><p>"However, I am not a man of bloodshed. As long as you answer some questions honestly…"</p><p>Old Man Earth Scar's tone changed and he stared into Old Bull's eyes. "I've heard that of Shangyuan Qingjing Temple's four secret runes, the Nine Heavens Yuan Rune was created by the Shangyuan Qingjing Temple's ancestors who spent their entire lives' efforts. It is said to be of great help when creating a nascent soul. Is this true?"</p><p>Fury burned in Old Bull's eyes. "You dare covet the secret runes of my immortal sect! You seek death!"</p><p>Old Man Earth Scar ignored Old Bull's anger and continued to speak as if to himself. "I had my doubts as well, but after much investigation, I found that Shangyuan Qingjing Temple is full of ups and downs. Although their reputation is not so great, and they've never dominated the Lesser Cold Region, their heritage is even longer than that of the Taiyi Dan Sect. Whenever the sect encounters danger, a nascent soul always emerges to turn the tide. I believe this rune must have some kind of magic!"</p><p>"I just want to borrow a glance at the Nine Heavens Yuan Rune, one of the four secret runes. I hope Old Bull will not be stingy!"</p><p>"Dream on!" Old Bull roared.</p><p>Old Man Earth Scar's face turned cold. "If not for my pity, you would have been a corpse by now. Your treasures and knife rune are destroyed. Killing you is effortless. Hand over the Nine Heavens Yuan Rune and I can spare your life. Otherwise, don't blame me for being ruthless!"</p><p>Faced with Old Man Earth Scar's threat, Old Bull showed no fear and retorted. "Do you think I am a child who knows nothing? This is an irreconcilable feud. If you dare let me live, I will cut you into a thousand pieces! If I don't hand it over, I'll die. If I do, I'll die. You can try if you can get the Nine Heavens Yuan Rune after I'm dead!"</p><p>Old Man Earth Scar snorted. "If I dared to attack you, I naturally have a way out. Even if your sect's ancestor comes in person, I'm confident I can escape his search. Killing you will do me no good. On the contrary, I might be injured by your counterattack, which is not what I want. Think carefully, which is more important, the rune or your life?"</p><p>Old Bull paused, as if he was moved.</p><p>His face showed hesitation as he lowered his head, his eyes flickering.</p><p>Old Man Earth Scar did not attack. He held the Sky Tune Conch in his hand and looked at Old Bull with amusement, waiting for his decision.</p><p>"Even if I give you the Nine Heavens Yuan Rune, you can't use it. Aren't you afraid that I'll follow the rune and find you after you leave… I can give you the method to refine the Nine Heavens Yuan Rune."</p><p>Old Bull suddenly raised his head and spoke.</p><p>Old Man Earth Scar sneered. "Don't lie to me, Old Bull. I've studied the way of runes specifically to deal with your Shangyuan Qingjing Temple. A secret rune is nothing more than a spirit rune. It's not a treasure, so how can it belong to anyone? It is no less difficult to refine a secret rune than a treasure. I don't have the energy to gather materials. Isn't it easier to take your Nine Heavens Yuan Rune directly? I'd like to see how you'll track me down!"</p><p>Old Bull's face turned pale, then he gritted his teeth and stretched out his hand.</p><p>A white light appeared in his palm, growing larger and larger. The secret rune gradually appeared. It was as big as a palm, slender, and shaped like a jade scepter. It was very different from the Sky Saber Rune.</p><p>There were some protrusions on it. Upon closer inspection, these protrusions looked like they were made up of dragons. In the end, they formed a mysterious seal script.</p><p>For some reason, Qin Sang felt somewhat familiar when he saw this secret rune.</p><p>Just as Qin Sang was secretly puzzled, Old Bull threw the secret rune out, and a sudden change occurred!</p><p>A dragon's roar suddenly came from the secret rune, and the protrusions on it came to life. The secret rune turned into tiny pieces, and six real dragons broke out of the jade scepter, roaring.</p><p>Although these dragons were very small, they were no different from real dragons. They looked like snakes, had four claws and scales, and had no horns on their heads, but a bulge, as if a single horn could be born at any time.</p><p>Among them were white, blue, and black dragons.</p><p>These dragons were not corpses, but illusory forms, just the souls of dragons after death. However, they exuded an aura of dragons, which was shocking.</p><p>This is… the soul of a dragon!</p><p>A sudden flash of lightning struck Qin Sang's mind, and he suddenly understood where the sense of familiarity came from.</p><p>Three Serpent Dragons Carriage!</p><p>On the ride to this ancient residence from the Heavenly Crystal Secret Realm, Qin Sang felt something wrong with the three serpent dragons of Abbot Profound Universe's Three Serpent Dragons Carriage. Now, he had a closer look and found that those serpent dragons were three of the six serpent dragon spirits.</p><p>Furthermore, when Abbot Profound Universe put away the Three Serpent Dragons Carriage, the talisman it turned into was a simplified version of the secret symbol.</p><p>He thought it was a magic tool, but it was a talisman sealing the serpent dragon spirits!</p><p>What did the so-called inner-view talisman have to do with the serpent dragon spirits?</p><p>Qin Sang was confused, but he saw that after the serpent dragons took on their true forms, their bodies expanded against the wind as the six serpent dragons turned around and attacked Abbot Profound Universe, wrapping themselves around his body.</p><p>Serpent dragon spirits breathed out dragon’s breaths and roared loudly.</p><p>Assisted by the serpent dragons, Abbot Profound Universe turned into a stream of light and flew into the sky at an amazing speed.</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly realized that this talisman was a secret talisman used for escaping. It was very possible that it was one of the Four Secret Talismans. Abbot Profound Universe was just exchanging words with Old Freak Earth Scar to find an opportunity to activate this talisman.</p><p>With serpent dragons surrounding him and dragon’s breaths rolling, Abbot Profound Universe looked like the God of Dragons in the world.</p><p>“Nine Dragons Heavenly Carriage Talisman!”</p><p>Old Freak Earth Scar remained calm and collected. His eyes flickered with coldness as he said calmly, “I’ve long noticed that your Three Serpent Dragons Carriage is extraordinary! Break for me!”</p><p>Abbot Profound Universe’s speed was so fast that it was the fastest Qin Sang had ever seen. It felt like teleportation.</p><p>Unfortunately, no matter how fast Abbot Profound Universe was, he failed to escape.</p><p>Just as he was about to reach the totem barrier, a hidden spiritual fluctuation suddenly appeared under the barrier and materialized into a golden copper bell magic tool as Old Freak Earth Scar shouted.</p><p>Qin Sang and Abbot Profound Universe had no idea when Old Freak Earth Scar had hidden his magic tool here. The copper bell was a trap, and Old Freak Earth Scar had let Abbot Profound Universe release the Nine Dragons Heavenly Carriage Talisman, waiting for him to fall into the trap.</p><p>‘Dong!’</p><p>The copper bell vibrated.</p><p>The sound was like the striking of a great bell, slightly stiffening Abbot Profound Universe’s figure.</p><p>Right after that, a golden glow shot out from the copper bell, incredibly fast. It circled Abbot Profound Universe in an instant.</p><p>‘Puff!’</p><p>Serpent dragon spirits cried out before their heads were cut off by the golden glow, shattering their spirits and killing them.</p><p>The Nine Dragons Heavenly Carriage Talisman emerged. Without the serpent dragon spirits, the talisman lost all its colors and became extremely pale.</p><p>Even the talisman did not survive. Hit by the golden glow, a shocking crack appeared and then it broke into pieces. The two spirit talismans flew in different directions; one landed on a stone platform, and the other fell into the lava, creating a splash before being swallowed by the lava.</p><p>With the Nine Dragons Heavenly Carriage Talisman destroyed, Abbot Profound Universe was exposed. His face was full of despair.</p>
