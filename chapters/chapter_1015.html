<h1>Chapter 107 Reunion</h1><p>Zou Family Island.</p><p>The island is home to a Zou family of cultivators.  Legend has it that an ancestor of theirs reached the Nascent Soul stage, hence the island's name.  After the Nascent Soul ancestor's passing, the family gradually declined.</p><p>However, a dying camel is still bigger than a horse.  The Zou family remained more powerful than most small sects, maintaining some renown in the nearby seas.  The previous family head was a top expert, second only to a Nascent Soul cultivator.</p><p>For unknown reasons, the previous head suddenly resigned, passing the leadership to a descendant and embarking on a solitary journey.  After that, the Zou family unexpectedly prospered, its members spending lavishly as if they'd stumbled upon a fortune.</p><p>Surprisingly, twenty years ago, the Zous abruptly announced the island's closure.  Only two years ago did they reappear, but acting with extreme caution.  Outsiders could only speculate about the reasons behind these events.</p><p>Zou Family Island was not only home to the Zou family but also to numerous ordinary people who lived peacefully under the family's protection.</p><p>In one of the large cities inhabited by mortals, an ordinary-looking man entered, strolled seemingly aimlessly for a while, and then left.  In a deserted spot, his appearance shifted, revealing him to be Qin Sang.</p><p>"I didn't expect the Zous to have such a history.  Their cultivation grounds are surely protected by a powerful formation. It seems unlikely I can discreetly visit Elder Zou's grave and return his jade pendant..."</p><p>A thought crossed Qin Sang's mind as he quietly flew towards the island's interior.</p><p>Soon, Qin Sang arrived at a forest, gazing at the misty mountain ahead, and muttered, "Just as I thought."</p><p>After a moment of contemplation, Qin Sang quietly retreated.</p><p>He returned to the island's largest mortal city.  Within the city stood a magnificent palace, rumored to be the residence of immortals.  Mortals dared not approach, only admiring its splendor from afar.</p><p>This palace served as the residence of those Zou family members who, assigned to handle worldly affairs, had no hope of advancing in their cultivation.</p><p>Inside the palace, a white-haired elder crouched on the ground, tending a garden like a farmer, meticulously caring for the flowers and plants.  The elder was a Foundation Establishment cultivator.</p><p>Surprisingly, none of the flowers were spiritual; they were common, mundane varieties.  Yet, the elder tended them with utmost care and gentleness, completely absorbed in his task.</p><p>After a long while, the elder rose, admiring his work with a satisfied nod, and turned to enter his room.</p><p>*Creak!*</p><p>The door opened.</p><p>The smile on the elder's face froze.</p><p>A jade pendant had appeared on the previously empty table. Someone had infiltrated right under his nose, and he hadn't noticed a thing.</p><p>The elder broke out in a cold sweat, his divine sense sweeping the surroundings, but finding no one.</p><p>Then, he noticed an inscription on the table: "An old friend has passed.  Returning what belongs."</p><p>The elder paused, cautiously approaching the table.  He picked up the jade pendant, glanced at it, and suddenly his face paled as he remembered something.  He rushed out of the city and flew towards his clan.</p><p>Qin Sang, unconcerned with the Zou family's reaction, left directly after returning Elder Zou's belongings.</p><p>...</p><p>The flying chariot sped across the boundless sea. White Crane acted as the charioteer. Qin Sang leaned against the railing, gazing out.</p><p>Before long, the outline of a large island appeared on the horizon.</p><p>Qin Sang called back White Crane and landed on the island.</p><p>Upon entering the city, Qin Sang headed straight for his cave dwelling. It was empty.  Bai wasn't back, and neither was Ning Wu Hui.</p><p>"There's still more than a month until our agreed meeting time..."</p><p>Qin Sang pondered, deciding not to act alone.  Before his departure, Ning Wu Hui had mentioned he might not stay at the Heavenly Dao Sect and could be elsewhere.</p><p>Qin Sang began cultivating in the cave.</p><p>Ten days passed in a flash.</p><p>While meditating, Qin Sang suddenly felt the cave's protective formation being triggered. His divine sense swept out, revealing Ning Wu Hui outside.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Ning!"</p><p>Qin Sang, overjoyed, quickly went out to greet him.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Qin!"</p><p>Ning Wu Hui bowed in greeting.</p><p>"Did you find anything, Fellow Daoist Ning?  Is there any confirmation on when the Seven Kills Palace will emerge?"</p><p>As soon as they entered the cave, Qin Sang eagerly inquired.</p><p>Ning Wu Hui nodded. "Don't worry, Fellow Daoist Qin. Several seniors from the Heavenly Dao Sect have been monitoring the changes in the Seven Kills Palace's immortal formation within the Storm Belt. It's rumored to be within two years."</p><p>"Two years... It seems I can only continue cultivating and wait..."</p><p>Qin Sang acknowledged with a hum.  Suddenly, something else came to mind, and he quickly asked, "There are legends that cultivators who enter the inner palace of the Seven Kills Palace during its emergence have a chance to gain benefits. Is this true?"</p><p>Previously, Qin Sang had been focused on returning to the Small Cold Realm and had primarily inquired about the outer palace.  Now that he was determined to enter the inner palace, he naturally made thorough inquiries on Tianxing Island.</p><p>Most of the information about the inner palace circulating in the market was just hearsay.  Fortunately, Qin Sang's cultivation had advanced significantly, granting him access to higher-ranking cultivators.  After offering some compensation, he managed to gather some useful information.</p><p>However, its veracity remained uncertain, so he turned to Ning Wu Hui for confirmation.</p><p>Ning Wu Hui, indeed knowledgeable, replied, "Yes, it's said that upon entering the inner palace, one must undergo a trial.  Those who complete it receive treasures as a reward. I've heard this trial was left by a senior for the continued prosperity of our human race.  However, it's extremely dangerous and difficult to overcome..."</p><p>"It's rumored that the Four Saints were the first to discover the Seven Kills Palace.  Could it be that the senior who left the trial was one of them?"</p><p>Qin Sang recalled the Four Saints Mountain on Tianxing Island.</p><p>"Perhaps," Ning Wu Hui said, unsure. "The era of the Four Saints is too distant. Many secrets are lost, leaving only rumors."</p><p>Qin Sang, curious about the Four Saints, sighed. "If they were the ones who discovered the Seven Kills Palace, they must have obtained many treasures to turn the tide and repel the Witch Clan!  I wonder what their final cultivation level was and if they ever crossed the Storm Belt to other cultivation worlds."</p><p>The Small Cold Realm had no legends of the Four Saints. Perhaps they never went there, or perhaps they were simply discreet.</p><p>Qin Sang believed it more likely they never visited.  Otherwise, there would have been some conflict with the Small Cold Realm cultivators in the Violet Empyrean Palace, leaving some trace. Even the Four Saints were unaware of the ancient teleportation formation, demonstrating its hidden nature. Without Senior Green Bamboo's help, Qin Sang would have been unlikely to find it on his own.</p><p>Qin Sang and Ning Wu Hui discussed in the cave for a long time.</p><p>After seeing Ning Wu Hui off, Qin Sang stood at the cave entrance, frowning. The appointed time was fast approaching, yet there was still no sign of Bai.</p><p>It wasn't until the day before the agreed meeting that Bai finally returned, looking hurried.</p><p>Relieved to see Bai unharmed, Qin Sang then noticed Bai's aura was much weaker than before their separation.  He quickly asked, "Did you encounter a powerful enemy, Fellow Daoist?"</p><p>Bai sighed. "Not an enemy, but an unexpected confinement for several months.  I nearly missed our important matter. Unfortunately, I didn't find anything useful."</p>
