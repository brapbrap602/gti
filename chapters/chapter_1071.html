<h1>Chapter 1663: The Gray Mist Appears</h1><p>Chapter 1663: The Gray Mist Appears</p><p>“This is…”</p><p>Descending the steps, Ning Wuhuai waved a hand.</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly felt a strange, icy chill that penetrated to his very bones, causing him to shiver uncontrollably. He quickly channeled his true energy to dispel the cold.  For someone of his current cultivation level, this was rare.</p><p>Rounding a corner of the cliff face, a look of surprise flashed in Qin Sang’s eyes.</p><p>They stood on a wide, flat area at the edge of the cliff, before them a deep, dark valley.  The sky above was filled with the shimmering light of a celestial barrier, completely sealing off the valley.</p><p>The valley was extremely long and narrow, not seeming naturally formed. As a sword cultivator, Qin Sang suspected it had been cleaved in two by a single, mighty sword stroke.</p><p>This was rather unnerving.  Yitian Peak clearly held a significant history, possibly an ancient cultivation forbidden zone.  Who dared to carve a valley here?</p><p>The valley was bottomless, filled with thick, black mist.  The icy chill he’d felt earlier emanated from this mist.</p><p>“What kind of aura is this? So intensely cold?”</p><p>He discovered that if he allowed this aura to enter his body, it would corrode his flesh.</p><p>“This place is called the Nether Valley.”</p><p>Ning Wuhuai stared intently into the valley’s depths.</p><p>“Nether Valley? Could it be the legendary Nether Qi…?”</p><p>Qin Sang realized that Nether Qi was one of the strange energies mentioned in ancient texts— unrelated to the Nether Scripture he’d cultivated at the Qi Refining stage.</p><p>“Senior Qingzhu’s order was for you to come to Nether Valley?”</p><p>“To retrieve something here, then wait for him elsewhere…”</p><p>Ning Wuhuai glanced at the stone walls on either side, then walked to the edge of the platform and sat cross-legged, setting up a protective spirit array. His external Daoist Nascent Soul then emerged from the top of his head, cradling a crimson-gold spirit sword.</p><p>“Be careful, friend. I sense something unusual deep within Nether Valley. There might be ancient restrictions…”</p><p>Qin Sang couldn’t help but warn him.</p><p>No wonder Senior Qingzhu had instructed Ning Wuhuai to cultivate an external Daoist Nascent Soul.</p><p>Even standing here, he could sense that Nether Valley was no ordinary place, incredibly dangerous.  Even with his strength, he wouldn't dare enter rashly.</p><p>Ning Wuhuai's Nascent Soul nodded to Qin Sang, then ‘whoosh’— it flew into Nether Valley.</p><p>The Nether Qi churned, with strange shadows flickering within, mysterious and unsettling.</p><p>Ning Wuhuai sat motionless, fully activating his external Daoist Nascent Soul.</p><p>“There might be some treasure within that could help Senior Qingzhu suppress his demonic soul…”</p><p>Qin Sang vaguely guessed at Senior Qingzhu's plan.</p><p>If Ning Wuhuai could successfully retrieve the treasure, Senior Qingzhu could recover, and the ancient transmission array could be located.</p><p>The Nether Qi surged restlessly.  His Divine Eye couldn’t see inside, so he had no idea what Ning Wuhuai would encounter or what he would find.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't help, so he patiently waited.</p><p>Suddenly, Ning Wuhuai’s physical body trembled, blood trickling from his lips, the protective array flickering.</p><p>Qin Sang was startled.  Confirming that Ning Wuhuai’s body showed no other abnormalities, he relaxed slightly, but his heart pounded in his chest.</p><p>Ning Wuhuai's success or failure not only concerned Senior Qingzhu, but also whether he could return to Xiaohan Domain.</p><p>At that moment, the Nether Qi violently surged. A gale swept through the narrow valley, as the Nether Qi poured out, rushing towards the platform where they stood.</p><p>Qin Sang darted to protect Ning Wuhuai’s physical body, fully activating his true energy to resist, offering whatever little help he could.</p><p>‘Rumble… rumble…’</p><p>Deafening, thunderous booms echoed.</p><p>The entire valley began to shake, but the celestial barrier above remained unmoved.</p><p>“If we were below, this kind of commotion would have attracted Nascent Soul Masters. Fortunately, we're inside the celestial barrier. I wonder if the tremors will affect what's below…”</p><p>Qin Sang was secretly alarmed, understanding that the commotion was caused by the external Daoist Nascent Soul breaking the restrictions.</p><p>This chaos lasted for a full incense stick of time before subsiding.  Nether Valley gradually returned to calm, but the external Daoist Nascent Soul remained absent, its physical body motionless.</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang couldn't help but feel anxious.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>A sound finally came from deep within Nether Valley. A streak of light burst forth from the Nether Qi, flashing and landing on the platform— the external Daoist Nascent Soul.</p><p>What had it experienced down there?</p><p>After its journey, the external Daoist Nascent Soul was severely weakened, much more than before.</p><p>The crimson-gold spirit sword circled the external Daoist Nascent Soul, its luster dimmed, appearing sluggish—even the natal spirit sword was damaged.</p><p>“Friend…”</p><p>Qin Sang opened his mouth to ask, but he noticed something in the Nascent Soul's small hand.</p><p>The out-of-body spirit flew to Ning Wuhu's head, placing an object in his hand before returning to his body.</p><p>Ning Wuhu slowly opened his eyes, his expression showing both exhaustion and excitement.</p><p>Qin Sang now saw the object clearly.</p><p>Surprisingly, it wasn't a treasure, but an irregularly shaped piece of metal, like a fragment of something larger.  One edge gleamed with an incredibly sharp, sword-like quality.</p><p>The object showed no sign of decay, suggesting it had been there for a long time.  An incomplete ancient character was etched onto its surface.</p><p>“This is…”</p><p>Qin Sang stared at the character, his heart pounding.  “It's part of the character ‘kill’!”</p><p>“The Nether Valley was indeed difficult to traverse, but thankfully I had my out-of-body spirit! I’ve expended too much energy and need to recover. Please wait a moment, friend…”</p><p>Ning Wuhu quickly consumed several pills, preparing to put away the fragment and refine the pills, when he noticed Qin Sang still staring at it.</p><p>“Do you recognize this object?” Ning Wuhu asked in surprise.</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head, hesitated, and asked, “This ‘kill’ character seems familiar. Would you mind if I touched it?  I can’t tell anything from its appearance, but physical contact might reveal something…”</p><p>Ning Wuhu readily agreed but didn't hand it over directly. He held the fragment with his fingers as Qin Sang extended a hand, channeled a wisp of true energy, lightly touched the fragment, immediately withdrew his hand, frowned in thought, and finally shook his head.</p><p>“It’s not the divine sword I read about in the ancient texts…”</p><p>Unaware of Qin Sang's inner turmoil, Ning Wuhu put away the fragment and closed his eyes to recover.</p><p>Unbeknownst to Ning Wuhu, Qin Sang was in a state of shock.</p><p>When the out-of-body spirit had carried the fragment, the grey energy deep within his dantian had trembled!</p><p>Since awakening on the Wu Shen Continent, Qin Sang had noticed this grey energy in his dantian, but its nature remained a mystery.  Even as his cultivation advanced, the energy remained dormant and could not be expelled.</p><p>Powerless against it, and seeing that it didn't harm him, Qin Sang had ignored it, assuming it might change after forming his golden core.</p><p>This was the first time the grey energy had reacted; it was drawn to the fragment!</p><p>When Qin Sang touched the fragment, the grey energy seemed to be strongly attracted to it, attempting to leave the dantian and merge with it.</p><p>Qin Sang quickly withdrew his hand, preventing exposure.</p>
