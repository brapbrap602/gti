<h1>Chapter 1667: Rainbow Bridge</h1><p>When Qing Teng appeared before Mo Xingdao, his decision to raise his hands sealed his fate as the target of everyone's attacks.</p><p>Those present were all Yuan Ying late-stage cultivators. Even their hastily launched attacks were far from insignificant.</p><p>The spot where Mo Xingdao stood erupted in a blinding flash, like mixing various colors of paint in a bucket and then shattering it in mid-air, scattering a chaotic yet subtly harmonious picture.  The intensity of the scene even obscured Mo Xingdao himself.</p><p>Anyone witnessing this level of assault would be terrified. Having witnessed Master Huaiyin's fate, Su Zinan knew that Mo Xingdao had fallen into a trap; a sorceress was lurking in the shadows, about to deliver the killing blow.</p><p>Wasn't this exactly the situation Su Zinan had been eagerly waiting for? The Three Corpses Death Banner lacked a main soul; capturing another Yuan Ying late-stage cultivator would complete the three souls, perfecting the demonic artifact – a goal of immense significance to him.</p><p>Compared to this, the importance of the Fire Rhinoceros was secondary. Since entering the Wuxiang Immortal Gate, he had abandoned the immediate pursuit of the Immortal Palace to hunt Yan Shan Laoren, and later attempted to join forces with Fan Laomo and others to kill Qin Sang – all for this objective.</p><p>The opportunities in the Immortal Palace and Di Shou Mountain were, in his eyes, excellent catalysts for a chaotic battle, providing him with the perfect chance.</p><p>Therefore, seeing Mo Xingdao in distress, he unhesitatingly chose to strike him down rather than warn him or attack the female cultivator. If Master Huaiyin hadn't been a physical cultivator, incompatible with the demonic banner, he would have done the same.</p><p>Qin Sang was his target, and so was Mo Xingdao.  Even Zi Lei Zhenren and Fan Laomo – given the chance, he wouldn't hesitate to attack them.</p><p>Years ago, Su Zinan used the insights of a transforming spirit cultivator, Lu Laomo, as bait, tempting Mo Xingdao to travel with him, journeying far to the North Waste, then south to the Central Plains, east to the East Sea, and finally to the South Barbarian lands.</p><p>During this time, he secured Mo Xingdao's assistance, achieving various objectives.  Capturing other targets with his help would have been ideal, but even without that, he could still probe Mo Xingdao's capabilities.</p><p>Now, Su Zinan felt he had almost completely figured out Mo Xingdao's background, using the situation to expose many of his techniques.</p><p>Of course, Su Zinan knew that Mo Xingdao must still have some trump cards to save his life.</p><p>But so what?</p><p>Consider Mo Xingdao's current opponents: two Daoist masters with profound Daoist powers, a poison king whose poisonous skills were unparalleled, and the Fire Demon, whose mind was likely focused on the Fire Rhinoceros and not directly targeting Mo Xingdao.</p><p>Nevertheless, these three were enough to make Mo Xingdao vulnerable, trapped in a desperate situation.</p><p>The sorceress had crafted a trap specifically for Mo Xingdao, and she wouldn't miss this opportunity.  Able to manipulate the divine prohibitions of Di Shou Mountain, she was even more dangerous than a true grand cultivator.</p><p>This predicament was virtually a death sentence; any hidden strengths should be revealed.</p><p>Su Zinan had to act; otherwise, the prey would be taken by the sorceress.  Securing Mo Xingdao's Yuan Ying and completing the three souls would allow him to do as he pleased, provided no Transforming Spirit cultivator interfered.</p><p>Unexpectedly, when Mo Xingdao truly revealed his trump card, it far exceeded everyone's expectations, causing a collective gasp of surprise.</p><p>A Yuan Ying late-stage puppet!</p><p>At this moment, the battlefield unfolded in everyone's minds.</p><p>Zi Lei Zhenren's thunder seal, the surging torrent originating from He Gao Zhenren's palm, and the poisonous sand laced with toxic miasma launched by the Poison King – these three attacks, each possessing terrifying power, struck a light barrier almost simultaneously.</p><p>Su Zinan recognized it – or rather, not a barrier, but a gossamer veil formed from countless threads of light.  It was a defensive treasure hidden deeply by Mo Xingdao, revealed during his forceful entry into the Wuwang Hall.  Su Zinan ordered his Moon Shadow Guards to secretly investigate, finally uncovering the treasure's name: Yuanxin Barrier.  It could automatically protect its owner. It belonged to a Northern Wasteland demon who had once been a Buddhist practitioner but later turned to the dark side, a discovery which also led him to confirm Mo Xingdao's identity.</p><p>Though powerful, this treasure wasn't sufficient to withstand this level of attack.</p><p>As the Yuanxin Barrier shattered, the female cultivator suddenly appeared.</p><p>Her timing was impeccable, turning the Poison King and others into her accomplices. With a delicate gesture, a white Yuan Qi descended from the heavens, a waterfall in the gray, hazy wind, converging in her hand – she had activated the power of the barrier.</p><p>Her five fingers formed a claw, like a giant dragon's claw, creating a terrifying spectacle, shattering all obstacles.</p><p>The female cultivator's eyes widened, her gaze filled with longing and excitement.</p><p>In the next moment, a grayish-black barrier rose again. The female cultivator struck down with her five fingers, and with the residual force of the thunder seal, the jade smoke torrent, and the poisonous sand, this barrier was instantly broken.</p><p>At that moment, strange ripples appeared in the void on either side of Mo Xingdao. Two demonic figures darted out, joining Kun Dao in rushing towards the fragments of the protective barrier, vying for the prize.</p><p>The clang of metal was heard then.</p><p>The strange phenomenon subsided.</p><p>Everyone saw a tall, muscular, dark-skinned figure had taken Mo Xingdao's place, or rather, stood before him.</p><p>The figure was ten feet tall, powerfully built, its entire body seemingly forged from spirit gold and mysterious iron, its skin radiating a heavy luster, like a legendary golden armored warrior, exceptionally imposing.</p><p>Its surface sheen mirrored that of the protective barrier. With arms crossed over its chest, it blocked Kun Dao's surprise attack, enduring the strikes of Lao Mo's demonic blade and Yan Shan's One Yuan Heavy Water.</p><p>For a moment, one half of the dark-skinned figure was engulfed in blood-red energy, while the other half was covered in thick glacial ice.</p><p>*Dong! Dong! Dong!*</p><p>The figure's body, hard as steel, bore several horrifying wounds.</p><p>One could only imagine the fate of a cultivator.</p><p>But this was a puppet. Though its body was stiffening, as long as its central mechanism wasn't destroyed, more wounds wouldn't cause it to break apart.  It stumbled backward to absorb the force of the blows, revealing Mo Xingdao, unharmed, hidden behind it.</p><p>The witch's surprise attack failed again, leaving her more frustrated than Su Zinan, almost spitting blood.</p><p>This was even more infuriating than the Great Monk; at least she'd injured the monk earlier. Now, she hadn't even touched Mo Xingdao, every blow landing on the puppet.</p><p>*Kacha!*</p><p>A thunderbolt struck from above.</p><p>A strange sound echoed in her mind.</p><p>The witch was jolted awake.  It was aimed at her again.</p><p>Aware of her predicament, she knew another failure would make things far harder.  Everyone here was interested in her, and she might face another siege like before. This place wasn't the Five Elements Divine Restriction; she was limited, and absolutely couldn't be careless.</p><p>Before the thunderbolt descended, Kun Dao’s figure spun and vanished.</p><p>In the distance, Qin Sang frowned.</p><p>He'd used the Soul-Subduing Mantra with the Summoning Thunder Technique.  His opponent was prepared, and as expected, the mantra's power was greatly reduced. But, surprisingly, it seemed to have no effect on Kun Dao at all.</p><p>This woman's strength was far greater than anticipated.</p><p>In a flash of thought, Qin Sang didn't give up.  Sword chimes and thunderclaps rang out together, shaking the earth. Sword energy transformed into a rainbow, piercing the air toward the battlefield, a sword formation taking shape.</p><p>In an instant, the sky darkened. Countless sword threads enveloped Kun Dao.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Kun Dao was more decisive than before. After her attack, she showed no hesitation, connecting with the boundary before the sword formation fully formed.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression darkened.  He wasn't aiming for a swift victory, immediately changing tactics. The sword formation suddenly contracted, sword intent converging into a single beam, a spirit sword hidden within, piercing towards Kun Dao's chest.</p><p>He had the Fire Jade Centipede and didn't fear losing Kun Dao's trail, but this opportunity couldn't be missed.</p><p>Kun Dao was also formidable, reacting swiftly, forcibly twisting her partially ethereal body.  Just then, a stern shout echoed in her ears.</p><p>“Who dares?!”</p><p>The speaker was Zi Lei Zhenren.</p><p>This wasn't a soul-attacking sound technique like the Soul-Subduing Mantra, but it sent a warning alarm through Kun Dao's heart.</p><p>Amidst this sudden change, Su Zinan’s plan failed, his mind shaken. Mo Xingdao only cared for himself,  He Gao Zhenren astonished by Kun Dao’s sudden appearance.</p><p>The Poison King, not deeply involved with others, reacted quickly. Seeing that the immortal fruit was an illusion and Kun Dao had appeared, he redirected his poisonous sand, but it seemed too late.</p><p>Only Zi Lei Zhenren remained unaffected.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The shout was like thunder, like sword energy cleaving the air.</p><p>The void around Kun Dao instantly shattered.</p><p>To everyone, the void shattered like a broken mirror.</p><p>But it wasn't quite that. Those cracks were lightning bolts, weaving a net across the void, seemingly slicing it open.</p><p>These lightning bolts were sharper than true thunderbolts. Their sharpness was clearly sword energy.</p><p>Thunder as skin, sword intent as bone!</p><p>Zi Lei Zhenren didn't use a sword; his finger flicks were swords.</p><p>This was the Eight Scenery's true legacy, "摄杀六律" (a fictional name preserved), a technique that was both thunder and swordsmanship, a supreme art. The Eight Scenery only obtained partial fragments, from which they’d gleaned a single technique, enough to dominate in offensive arts.</p><p>Used by Zi Lei Zhenren, its power was unparalleled.</p><p>Two grand cultivators, two top-tier sword techniques, both aimed at Kun Dao.</p><p>Sword intent immediately soared around Kun Dao.</p><p>“Tzzz!”</p><p>A series of ripping sounds—the air tearing, sword energy cutting through Kun Dao's skin and flesh—mingled together.</p><p>A spray of blood erupted from the void.</p><p>Kun Dao vanished.</p><p>Sword intent swerved downwards.</p><p>The Jinchen Sword hung in the void, its tip trembling.</p><p>Zi Lei Zhenren’s fingers closed, lightning gathering in his palm like a river flowing into the sea, held but unreleased.</p><p>The two men tacitly restrained their sword intent, avoiding unnecessary conflict.</p><p>In that confined space, two sword intents mingled.  Luckily, they shared the common goal of pursuing Kun Dao; otherwise, a direct confrontation would have been unavoidable.</p><p>Qin Sang lowered his eyes. He and Zi Lei Zhenren had unintentionally coordinated, but still failed to capture Kun Dao, only managing to wound her.</p><p>However, Qin Sang found the outcome acceptable.</p><p>On the one hand, he had tested Kun Dao’s limits, discovering significant differences from the Five Elements Divine Ban on the mountain.</p><p>On the other hand, even if Kun Dao were captured, her fate remained uncertain.  Even if not monopolized by the Daoist sect, various factions would vie for control.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>Jin Chen sword flew back. Just as Qin Sang was about to retreat and pursue Kun Dao, he heard Mo Xingdao’s long howl, followed by a sneering laugh.  “Someone warned me that allying with Su Daoyou was like playing with fire, that I risked being soul-stolen and refined into his magic banner. I thought it was an exaggeration!”</p><p>Earlier, Kun Dao had only focused on escaping, while Su Zinan relentlessly attacked, aiming for a decisive victory over Mo Xingdao.</p><p>The break was complete; there was no turning back.</p><p>Unfortunately, although the puppet had suffered repeated blows, its core remained unharmed, its power intact.  Coupled with Mo Xingdao, they presented the might of two Grand Cultivators.</p><p>Su Zinan, in alliance with the demonic soul, might have defeated Mo Xingdao, but that was the limit of his capabilities.</p><p>Hearing Mo Xingdao’s words, Su Zinan’s face twitched, as if remembering something, his gaze turning icy. “That bitch didn’t die!”</p><p>Only Yue Fei and Lao Wu knew about the Three Corpse Death God Banner.</p><p>And even they didn’t know everything.</p><p>Lao Wu only knew the banner could absorb demonic souls up to the peak of the Nascent Soul Mid-Stage.</p><p>After all, controlling three Grand Cultivators of the same level with a single banner was too shocking.</p><p>Before Lao Lu’s improvements, the original banner could only control Nascent Soul Mid-Stage cultivators, and its owner was subsequently killed by Buddhists, Daoists, and demons.</p><p>Of course, that was because the person lacked a Nascent Divinity foster father.</p><p>But his Three Corpse Death God Banner was even more potent.</p><p>This banner was against the natural order. Those controlled could neither live nor die, enduring endless suffering and torment.</p><p>Once exposed, Lao Wu himself would be in danger, and Grand Cultivators in the cultivation world would be in constant fear, quickly forming an anti-Su alliance.  Even with his foster father’s reputation, Su Zinan would have to retreat to Luye and dare not move freely.</p><p>Lao Wu died by his hand.</p><p>Yue Fei, however, died elsewhere.  Su Zinan only saw the imprint vanish, and coupled with Lao Wu's feedback, he didn't investigate further.</p><p>If Mo Xingdao's words were true, it could only have been Yue Fei's warning.</p><p>While Su Zinan hadn't revealed the true secrets to Yue Fei, he treated her as a plaything, hence he wasn't overly cautious.  With the banner nearing completion, he became complacent, and during their intimate moments, he inevitably let slip a few words.</p><p>Later, when Lao Wu suddenly disappeared, he blamed the Fire Demon, but Yue Fei had witnessed the Snowfield Battle firsthand.</p><p>If she had investigated, she should have linked the facts to the truth.</p><p>That bitch, using unknown methods, broke free from the control of the Lunar Moon Seal and even tricked him!</p><p>Mo Xingdao didn't respond to the scorn.</p><p>He knew Su Zinan was deceitful, yet he still travelled with him, confident that he could swallow the bait and emerge unscathed.</p><p>In general matters, he would do his best to avoid revealing anything to Su Zinan.</p><p>But when it came to chasing the Fire Demon, he would only put in minimal effort.</p><p>In matters of love, Su Zinan was always the one in control, Yue Fei and the other women were his pampered birds, but unexpectedly, he was severely bitten.  His anger reached the heavens.</p><p>The demonic soul had been exposed before the Daoist Grand Cultivators, yet the banner was concealed in his sleeve.  If Mo Xingdao hadn't revealed it, he might have been able to make excuses, but now it was impossible.</p><p>As expected.</p><p>Hegao Zhenren recovered from the series of surprising events, immediately looking towards Su Zinan, his tone harsh. “You scoundrel! Lao Lu is not in this realm, yet you dare to be so arrogant!”</p><p>Su Zinan retracted the demonic soul, scoffing. “What right do you have to rebuke me for your actions today?”</p><p>Hegao Zhenren was speechless.</p><p>The Eight Scenery Sect’s toleration of the remnants of the Wu Xiang Immortal Sect in opening the Legacy Mansion was hardly above board. They would face pressure from various factions later. With a Nascent Divinity cultivator for support, this was manageable, otherwise they would be too preoccupied to worry about Su Zinan.  He turned to his senior brother, the sect leader, the situation was truly dire.</p><p>Zi Lei Zhenren remained silent, seemingly sensing something.</p><p>Everyone assumed he was searching for Kun Dao.</p><p>After a moment, a stream of light flew from Zi Lei Zhenren's head, within which a palace lantern slowly ascended and rotated, revealing eight sides.</p><p>Upon seeing the lantern, Su Zinan ceased his sneering, Mo Xingdao leaped onto the puppet's shoulder, both showing alertness.</p><p>The Poison King exclaimed, “The Eight Scenery Palace Lantern!”</p><p>Suddenly, the lantern blazed, its rainbow light illuminating the heavens, a rainbow bridge forming, directly pointing towards a certain location atop Emperor Bestowed Mountain.</p><p>Where the rainbow bridge extended, the gale subsided, the formations solidified.</p><p>Zi Lei Zhenren stepped onto the rainbow bridge, like a celestial being.</p>
