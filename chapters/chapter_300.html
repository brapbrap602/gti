<h1>Chapter 293 The First Restriction</h1><p>Time was short, and they couldn't afford to slowly search for a safe path.  Their only option was to force their way through. Although Qin Sang was quite accomplished in the art of restrictions, after seeing a glimpse of the restrictive formations within the mist, he had no confidence in breaking them within a short time.  </p><p>Thus, they could only follow Yu Kong's suggestion.</p><p>Yan Wu spoke, "The four of us can form two teams and support each other..."</p><p>Before Yan Wu could finish, Yu Kong pointed his finger and said decisively, "Yan Wu, you and Fellow Daoist Wu Chen go together. Daoist Qing Feng and Fellow Daoist Shangguan's sword and saber techniques complement each other, making for a better combination!"</p><p>Yan Wu was taken aback, feeling somewhat dissatisfied. He opened his mouth to say something, but when he met Yu Kong's icy gaze, he couldn't help but shiver. He immediately realized that the slight camaraderie between him and Yu Kong wasn't enough for Yu Kong to go all out to help him.</p><p>If his personal grievances affected their plan to obtain the medicine, Yu Kong would definitely not hesitate to teach him a lesson.</p><p>At this moment, a faint, mosquito-like voice transmitted to Yan Wu's ear.</p><p>Upon receiving Yu Kong's promise, Yan Wu was overjoyed. He calmed down and glanced at Qin Sang inconspicuously, then immediately followed Yu Kong's orders and walked to Wu Chen's side.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Wu, please take care of me."</p><p>The others seemed unaware of the small interaction between him and Yu Kong.</p><p>"Likewise..."</p><p>Wu Chen hurriedly returned the courtesy, but his smile was somewhat bitter. If not for Yu Kong's command, he would least want to be with Yan Wu.</p><p>It wasn't that he was afraid of Yan Wu harming him.  If Yan Wu were like them, the decision to save or not save in times of danger would be ambiguous. However, Yan Wu was Yu Kong's man.</p><p>Wu Chen couldn't help but worry. If an accident occurred during the formation breach, would Yu Kong take his anger out on him?</p><p>Not only did he have to protect his own life, but he also had to constantly pay attention to rescuing Yan Wu, which doubled the danger.</p><p>Wu Chen sighed inwardly.</p><p>Shangguan Lifeng walked to Qin Sang's side and slightly raised his saber. "Daoist Qing Feng, I am not very familiar with your swordsmanship. If there are any areas where our cooperation is lacking, please do not hesitate to advise me."</p><p>Qin Sang cupped his hands. "Fellow Daoist Shangguan is too modest. This humble Daoist will also be mindful of cooperating with you. However, we still don't know what the situation inside is like, so it would be better to decide on a strategy after we enter."</p><p>"Daoist speaks wisely."</p><p>Shangguan Lifeng, who wasn't a man of many words, immediately sheathed his saber and fell silent.</p><p>After this discussion, the five of them formed a formation. Qin Sang and Shangguan Lifeng were on the left, Wu Chen and Yan Wu on the right, acting as Yu Kong's vanguard.</p><p>The power of the restrictions surrounding the mountain was more or less the same.  The group didn't have time to carefully discern them and simply chose a random spot to enter the restriction.</p><p>There wasn't any disorienting change.  They only felt a moment of darkness before suddenly seeing light again. Immediately afterward, a wave of heat rushed towards them, and a bluish-purple flame shot down from the sky.</p><p>Qin Sang and the others had been on high alert. The moment they sensed the heatwave, they reacted instantly.</p><p>Several bursts of spiritual power, almost simultaneously, struck the stream of flames, scattering it directly. Then they drove the scattered flames to the side and surveyed their surroundings.</p><p>They had fallen into a world of raging flames.</p><p>Above, below, left, and right, flames were everywhere, radiating an unbearable heat.</p><p>These flames had no fuel source, burning and drifting in the void, yet they persisted endlessly.</p><p>The flames around them weren't dense. Several streams of varying sizes wandered about. They were simply unlucky to have triggered one upon entering, but fortunately, it wasn't powerful and was easily dispersed.</p><p>However, around them, the streams of flames suddenly became denser, merging into a boundless sea of fire.</p><p>The flames raged fiercely, blotting out the sky and the sun.</p><p>The colors of the flames in different directions also varied. Some were bluish-purple like the one they had just encountered, some were grayish-white, and some were the normal crimson...</p><p>In eight directions – front, back, left, right, and the diagonals – there were eight different colored flames, distributed remarkably evenly, like a Bagua-shaped fire disk surrounding them.</p><p>Yu Kong, who had been observing the changes in the flames, let out a soft exclamation. "This scene conjured by the restriction seems somewhat familiar. The last time I passed through the protective formation, I encountered this type of raging flame formation."</p><p>Initially apprehensive upon seeing the intensity of the flames, the group was overjoyed upon hearing his words.</p><p>Wu Chen seemed to breathe a sigh of relief and asked, "Senior Yu, have you found a way to break the restriction?"</p><p>Unexpectedly, Yu Kong slowly shook his head. "Not yet.  The restriction here appears to have some connection to the protective formation, but it is also vastly different. I still need you all to go in and probe. Based on my past experience, these eight colored flames should represent eight paths. Regardless of which path you take, you will eventually find a gate, but only one of them is the true exit. If you choose the wrong gate, you will fall into the next level of the restriction, increasing the difficulty of breaking it. What's more frightening is that this is only one of the restrictions. If a single mistake causes a chain reaction, destabilizing the entire restriction, we will be in grave danger."</p><p>Wu Chen's face paled slightly. "The first restriction is already this dangerous..."</p><p>Yu Kong smiled faintly. "Fellow Daoist Wu, don't worry. As long as we find the right method, breaking the restriction isn't that difficult. Now, you all enter the sea of fire in pairs.  You don't need to force your way to the end of the sea of fire. Just reach the halfway point and hold your ground for at least thirty breaths, and I will be able to see the changes and distinguish which are false gates and which is the true exit. If you encounter danger, retreat immediately, and I will do my utmost to rescue you."</p><p>After saying this, Yu Kong sat cross-legged on the spot and took out three small flags, planting them around him.</p><p>The small flags formed a barrier of cloud energy that could help him withstand the impact of the flames while he focused on observing the changes in the restriction.</p><p>Yu Kong's eyes flashed, nodding to signal that they could begin.</p><p>From the outside, the eight directions looked no different. Apart from their colors, the flames seemed identical.  Choosing any direction seemed the same.</p><p>Wu Chen and Yan Wu entered the grayish-white flames. Qin Sang and Shangguan Lifeng, while communicating, walked towards the bluish-purple sea of fire directly ahead.</p><p>Qin Sang urged his Ebony Sword, and Shangguan Lifeng held his saber with both hands.</p><p>They had gained some understanding of each other while hunting the Cloud Beasts. They couldn't claim to be perfectly synchronized, but simple coordination was not a problem.</p><p>Sword and saber energy crisscrossed, jointly dispersing the incoming streams of flames, and the two figures appeared at the edge of the sea of fire.</p><p>The sea of fire stretched continuously without a single gap.</p><p>Countless tongues of flame darted out, licking at their protective spiritual energy.</p><p>[Collect free books] Follow v.x [Book Friends Base Camp] Recommend your favorite novels, and receive cash red envelopes!</p><p>Enveloped by the flames, even the hair on their bodies seemed to curl slightly.</p><p>"Daoist Qing Feng, if we proceed side-by-side and both fall into danger simultaneously, I fear we won't be able to react in time. It would be better for one to be in front and the other behind, making it easier to support each other," Shangguan Lifeng suggested.</p>
