<h1>Chapter 1244: Trapping the Enemy</h1><p>Though Qin Sang possessed numerous divine abilities, killing Dongyang Bo was no easy task. Only by luring him into the demonic flames did he stand a chance. Thus, before taking action, Qin Sang had mentally rehearsed the plan multiple times.</p><p>First, he would use the Seven Souls Slaughter Formation to catch Dongyang Bo off guard and trap him. If he could kill him within the sword formation, that would be ideal. If not, he could at least obscure Dongyang Bo's senses and deploy the Eighteen Demon Banners.</p><p>The Ebony Sword was a top-tier treasure, and the Seven Souls Slaughter Formation was no ordinary sword array. Given enough time to master it, Qin Sang could potentially trap and kill enemies above his level. However, the formation still had its weaknesses. While it could easily handle cultivators of the same rank, it was vulnerable to detection by higher-level experts. Moreover, Dongyang Bo happened to possess the Green Lotus Treasure Lantern, which countered sword formations.</p><p>Seeing the sword formation indeed being broken, Qin Sang swiftly formed hand seals. Eighteen demon banners materialized in the surrounding void, silently growing into massive three-zhang-long banners. As the banners unfurled, the demonic flames had yet to fully manifest, but the blood shadows trapped within the formation began to grow restless, instinctively sensing danger. Soon, the aura of the demonic flames surged forth, causing the blood shadows near the banners to stiffen and melt away without a sound.</p><p>Dongyang Bo had used the Bronze Treasure Lantern to lure Qin Sang into unleashing the Blood Filth Divine Light and then launched a sneak attack with the Dragon-Phoenix Stone Pillars. His divine sense had been firmly locked onto his surroundings. Although the Dragon-Phoenix Stone Pillars couldn't damage the high-quality Ebony Sword, they only needed to delay it momentarily, which also made the flaws in the sword formation more apparent.</p><p>In battles between masters, victory often hinged on a split second. Dongyang Bo seized the flaw. By the time the Ebony Sword broke free from the Dragon-Phoenix Stone Pillars, it was too late for Qin Sang to mend the flaw or alter the formation to stop Dongyang Bo.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>A burst of radiant flames erupted from the Diamond Bracelet, piercing through the sword formation like a white rainbow. In an instant, the sword formation collapsed. A faint streak of blood light shone through from the outside. Without any visible movement, Dongyang Bo's figure appeared at the flaw in the formation, on the verge of breaking free.</p><p>At that moment, the Ebony Sword reappeared before him, leaping slightly before slashing down with ferocious speed.</p><p>*Clang!*</p><p>The strike was once again blocked by the Diamond Bracelet. Seizing the opportunity, Dongyang Bo's figure flickered, and he successfully broke free from the formation.</p><p>Just as he emerged, Dongyang Bo was about to seize the talisman puppet when he sensed something amiss. Before his eyes, black flames surged, instantly incinerating the surrounding blood mist and shadows, rushing toward him.</p><p>Qin Sang, anticipating his move, had preemptively set up the Demon Banner Formation, unleashing the demonic flames to strike head-on!</p><p>Seeing this, Dongyang Bo's expression darkened, but he remained calm. He recalled that Qin Sang possessed a set of banners, which had only been used once on the battlefield. Information about them was scarce, and some speculated they were inspired by the Demon Banners of the Ancestor of Ghostly Yin, with two additional banners added. Even if the banners matched the original's power, Dongyang Bo was confident in his ability to protect himself. With a full realm difference between them, Qin Sang would inevitably exhaust his true essence first if the battle dragged on.</p><p>Dongyang Bo simply didn't want to prolong the fight, but he wasn't worried about his safety. However, when he took in the scene around him, his face turned pale with shock.</p><p>Upon closer inspection, the banners floating in the sea of flames weren't twelve in numberâ€”there were eighteen!</p><p>Qin Sang had only formed his Nascent Soul a few years ago, and the strength he had displayed earlier had already far exceeded Dongyang Bo's expectations. Yet, it seemed this wasn't even his full power.</p><p>Facing the eighteen demon banners, Dongyang Bo's expression lost all traces of ease, replaced by a sense of foreboding.</p><p>"These are truly the Ten Directions Yama Banners!" Dongyang Bo had dealt with the Ancestor of Ghostly Yin before and knew the formidable power of his demon banner formation. Now, Qin Sang possessed eight more banners than the Ancestor.</p><p>At this moment, the issue was no longer about seizing the talisman puppet!</p><p>The eighteen demon banners stood tall in the void, like eighteen gaping maws, continuously spewing demonic flames. Qin Sang controlled the flames through the Fire Lotus Seed. In an instant, the demonic inferno surged with terrifying momentum, waves of fire crashing toward Dongyang Bo.</p><p>A sense of alarm rose in Dongyang Bo's heart. His gaze swept the area, and he felt as though he had fallen into an endless sea of fire with no escape. The Diamond Bracelet above his head chimed faintly, its radiance dimmed by the demonic flames, teetering on the verge of collapse.</p><p>"Although the Ancestor of Ghostly Yin's treasure is powerful, it has one flaw. These demonic flames are external forces and cannot be controlled as easily as one's own. Against a strong opponent, they might be able to defeat but not kill."</p><p>Dongyang Bo was quite familiar with the demon banners. However, even with this flaw, when the number of banners reached eighteen, it represented a qualitative change that couldn't be ignored.</p><p>Dongyang Bo's mind raced. Though shocked, he remained composed and reacted swiftly. He knew that if he didn't escape soon, he would be consumed by the demonic flames, doomed for eternity!</p><p>Immediately, Dongyang Bo channeled all his power into the Diamond Bracelet for protection. His figure flickered rapidly, leaving only a streak of white light darting chaotically through the void. For a moment, the demonic flames were thrown into disarray.</p><p>Dongyang Bo, aware of the banner formation's weakness, knew that standing still and fighting head-on was out of the question. Qin Sang had to control the demonic flames to attack him, and since the flames weren't refined by Qin Sang, the faster Dongyang Bo moved, the easier it would be to find flaws.</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang's expression shifted slightly. Dongyang Bo had indeed struck a nerve. The old fox had quickly identified the formation's weakness. However, Qin Sang had the Fire Lotus Seed, which allowed him to use the subdued demonic flames as a bridge, giving him better control than the Ancestor of Ghostly Yin had possessed.</p><p>With no other choice, Qin Sang sat cross-legged in the void, fully concentrating on controlling the Demon Banner Formation, not daring to be distracted.</p><p>The Heavenly Eye Butterfly also appeared, perched on Qin Sang's shoulder, its Heavenly Eye wide open, closely monitoring the formation. Firstly, Dongyang Bo wasn't yet at his limit, and her thunder-controlling abilities couldn't yet break through the Diamond Bracelet's defense. It was better to prepare the Heavenly Eye Divine Light to counter any spells Dongyang Bo might cast. Secondly, Qin Sang needed her to focus on using the Heavenly Eye to lock onto Dongyang Bo and predict his movements in advance.</p><p>The demonic flames raged, furiously assaulting the Diamond Bracelet. The bracelet chimed incessantly, its light flickering between bright and dim.</p><p>Dongyang Bo attempted to repeat his earlier tactic, using the Dragon-Phoenix Stone Pillars to smash the demonic flames. Unfortunately, the flames weren't physical and could disperse and reform at will. Seeing the treasure was useless and unable to approach the banners, he had no choice but to put it away.</p><p>The eighteen demon banners were indeed formidable. Dongyang Bo's true essence was depleting rapidly, and he soon felt he could no longer sustain the Diamond Bracelet, causing him to grow increasingly anxious.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>As the demonic flames closed in, Dongyang Bo felt his mind waver, his primordial spirit becoming unstable. He hurriedly channeled more power into the Diamond Bracelet to keep the flames at bay and took out the Bronze Treasure Lantern once more.</p><p>The lantern had been tainted, but Dongyang Bo had no time to care. He poured his true essence into it with all his might.</p><p>The result of this forceful activation was a series of cracking sounds. The Bronze Treasure Lantern became riddled with cracks, fragments falling away as it was destroyed. However, a portion of the wick at the center remained, barely igniting a dim, yellowish flame.</p><p>Dongyang Bo's face twitched, pained by the loss. The treasure was rare, but to save his life, he had no choice. He never expected that a former pawn could push him to such extremes.</p><p>The lantern's flame could stabilize his mind, but it wasn't enough to help him escape.</p>
