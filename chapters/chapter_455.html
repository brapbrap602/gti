<h1>Chapter 448: On Corpse Refinement</h1><p>Qin Sang hadn't lied to the fat man.</p><p>Three Soul-Guiding Grasses yielded a total of seven Heavenly Corpse Talismans.</p><p>Five were used before entering the Yun Cang Marsh.</p><p>One was used on Yu Da Yue, but the attempt to create a living corpse failed. Another was used on Liang Yan, successfully creating a living corpse, but it was destroyed by Yu Hua in the Wuyaya Valley.</p><p>One was given to Tan Jie to preserve his soul, and Qin Sang used one himself for protection.</p><p>Another was used to seal Yu Hua's primordial spirit, but Qin Sang had been hesitant to use it for corpse refinement, so Yu Hua remained in the Corpse Puppet Bag.</p><p>Soul-Guiding Grass is rare, and to be safe, Qin Sang had to keep one for himself.  That's why he only refined one living corpse in the past three years, which he later sold.</p><p>Manager Bao didn't believe Qin Sang's story, saying, "Daoist friend's corpse refinement techniques are unique. Those corpses are incredibly strong. If you have higher quality corpses for sale, our shop will offer you a satisfactory price. However, although I'm not a connoisseur, I've been a manager for many years and can make some judgments. Your living corpses are clearly far superior to these corpses—no, they're incomparable! The higher the cultivation, the greater the difference!"</p><p>Qin Sang chuckled, glancing at the nine煞尸 (sha corpses), who remained oblivious to the insults.</p><p>"These sha corpses are worthless in your eyes, old friend?"</p><p>Manager Bao shook his head repeatedly. "Daoist friend, please don't jest. My words are not unfounded; I believe you understand..."</p><p>Qin Sang gestured for him to continue.</p><p>"Then I'll be blunt. I hope you won't mind."</p><p>Manager Bao glanced at the sha corpses.</p><p>"I heard you call these nine corpses 'sha corpses'.</p><p>"Sha corpses are powerful, surpassing those created by other corpse refinement techniques, but they have two major flaws.</p><p>"First, sha corpses cannot be improved!</p><p>"Other corpse refinement techniques allow for cultivation or other secret methods to enhance a corpse's strength. Some ghost cultivators even raise corpses to become their soul-bound corpses, which can grow alongside them, possessing limitless potential.</p><p>"To be honest, when I last saw your sha corpses, I was fascinated and kept one for study. It was then I realized how unique your technique is.</p><p>"It seems that once a sha corpse is created, it is fixed.</p><p>"I tried several corpse refinement techniques on it, but I couldn't improve its strength at all.  Even keeping it in a special location for cultivation wouldn't change anything.</p><p>"At first, I thought it was due to the earth煞之气 (earth煞 energy), so I went to great lengths to obtain it, but still couldn't improve it.</p><p>"Cultivators' strength will inevitably improve, but sha corpses remain stagnant, quickly falling behind their masters, becoming useless—isn't that a huge drawback?"</p><p>Manager Bao's eyes shone with confidence as he asked Qin Sang.</p><p>Beneath his black robe, Qin Sang's eyes flickered. He was astonished by Manager Bao's words.</p><p>Unexpectedly, this man was also a master of corpse refinement, and his observations were all accurate.</p><p>The *Heavenly Yin Corpse Manual* indeed states that sha corpses are limited by their strength in life; once refined, they reach their peak and cannot be improved until destroyed.</p><p>Living corpses are the same. It was only from Wu Shang's notes that Qin Sang learned the secret method to enhance living corpses to the level of Flying Night Rakshasas.</p><p>But the *Heavenly Yin Corpse Manual*'s advantage lies in its speed; it doesn't require long cultivation periods.</p><p>Of course, the Heavenly Corpse Sect also has normal corpse cultivation methods.</p><p>Zombie refinement techniques, like those of other sects, allow for gradual improvement alongside the cultivator, and can incorporate a wisp of earth煞之气 to refine the body, surpassing other corpse refinement techniques.</p><p>However, Qin Sang couldn't stay in a place of Yin煞 energy forever, living with a corpse. He had no intention of expending energy cultivating a soul-bound corpse, only using corpses as tools for combat and protection.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang silent, Manager Bao continued, unconcerned.</p><p>"But I did make a discovery.  The dantian of the sha corpses is different from other corpses; it appears to have been refined by your secret technique.</p><p>"The dantian—that's the second flaw I mentioned!</p><p>"Besides the weaknesses shared with other corpses, sha corpses have a dantian, their greatest weakness!</p><p>"I don't know what secret method you used to strengthen the sha corpse's dantian to withstand the earth煞之气.</p><p>"But earth煞之气 isn't easily controlled. Once the dantian is destroyed, the煞气 will burst forth, causing the sha corpse to collapse irrevocably.</p><p>"Sha corpses have extremely low sentience, only possessing a killing instinct.</p><p>The battlefield is ever-changing.  If the master is distracted, even for a moment, an opponent can easily destroy a corpse puppet by exploiting any weakness.</p><p>"If the cultivator's realm is low, they might be able to escape notice," Bao said. "But the higher the opponent's cultivation, the keener their eye.  A seasoned veteran would spot the corpse puppet's weaknesses instantly. I wouldn't be surprised."</p><p>"A living corpse is different! The owner of that living corpse came and went quickly; I didn't get a good look at it. I'm not sure if its abilities can be improved through cultivation, or what other powers it might possess. But I can say this: the living corpse is incredibly responsive, instinctively knowing how to protect itself and avoid harm. Even in a battle between masters, it can still be incredibly effective!"</p><p>Bao finished his explanation, drained his teacup, and smacked his lips. "Friend, have I made any mistakes?"</p><p>Qin Sang rose to his feet and bowed. "Manager Bao's insights are keen. From a single corpse puppet, you've deduced so much—you've almost seen through me! I'm impressed!  However, I haven't misled you. While powerful, living corpses are incredibly difficult to create, requiring extremely stringent conditions. Even if I wanted to, I couldn't. Unless you have other business, Manager Bao, could you please give me an appraisal? I need to return to my cultivation and won't keep you any longer."</p><p>Bao, hearing the sincerity in Qin Sang's words, looked disappointed but didn't give up. He pressed on, "Don't rush, friend! Just because you don't have a living corpse now doesn't mean you won't in the future.  Let me ask you this: given enough time, is it possible to create a living corpse comparable to a cultivator at the False Core stage?"</p><p>Qin Sang looked intently at Bao, hesitated, and then said, "Not comparable to a False Core stage... a living corpse at the late Foundation Establishment stage might be possible.  But don't compare other corpse puppets to a living corpse. Its abilities far surpass your expectations."</p><p>Bao's face lit up. He said eagerly, "How could I buy a living corpse from you? I can't afford it myself, but I could help you find a buyer."</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes flickered. He said meaningfully, "If Manager Bao truly can find a buyer for me, I only require three things. First, a spiritual object to aid in the Golden Core breakthrough; second, a heavenly treasure to repair one's foundation; third, a demon core less than ten years removed from its host body, or…"</p><p>Qin Sang paused mid-sentence.</p><p>Bao's expression darkened considerably.</p>
