<h1>Chapter 553: A Difficult Situation</h1><p>The other four, besides Qin Sang, were equally astonished.</p><p>Ziwei Palace—it was a place incredibly far removed from their current reality.  It was the domain of Golden Core and Nascent Soul cultivators;  unless they had a compelling reason, like Qin Sang and Yun Youzi, even cultivators at the False Core stage wouldn't easily risk venturing there.</p><p>In Ziwei Palace, they would be low-level cultivators, constantly facing potential life-threatening situations.</p><p>Their original plan at Xuanlu Pass was to wait for the spiritual tide to end and then enter the Ancient Immortal Battlefield to seek opportunities. They never anticipated being drawn into something like this.</p><p>The five of them exchanged glances.</p><p>Qin Sang felt even heavier than the others.  If he continued to follow Dongyang Bo, aside from the unknown dangers, what about his own affairs?</p><p>He needed to obtain the Crimson Cloud Purple Fruit and the follow-up cultivation techniques for the *Yuan Shen Yang Jian Zhang*— both only obtainable in Ziwei Palace.  The next opening of the palace? Who knew when that would be?</p><p>But what excuse could he possibly use to refuse?</p><p>Qin Sang racked his brain.  Feigning injury or fear—those wouldn't work.</p><p>Encountering Dongyang Bo in front of the palace would easily expose his deceit.  If Dongyang Bo learned that his disciple dared to deceive his ancestor, the consequences would be unthinkable.</p><p>At that moment, the Xuanwu Beast Mark floated before them, and Qin Sang could only reach out and grasp it.</p><p>The instant his fingers touched the mark, a green thread shot out. Qin Sang was startled and quickly tried to flick it away, but the thread was incredibly fast.</p><p>A sharp pain shot through his fingertip—the thread had sliced open a wound, and blood dripped onto the mark.</p><p>Then, the thread rapidly climbed up Qin Sang's palm, coiling around his wrist to form a delicate mark resembling a bracelet.</p><p>Everything happened in the blink of an eye. Even with Qin Sang's cultivation, he couldn't react in time, helplessly watching the mark embed itself into his body.</p><p>'Roar!'</p><p>As the blood fell, a furious roar erupted from within the beast mark.</p><p>It seemed to contain a monstrous beast, an extremely ferocious and terrifying aura instantly surging from the mark, directly impacting the soul of anyone who touched it.</p><p>Like a savage beast from the primordial wilderness, it surveyed all creation, ready to crush everything!</p><p>What kind of beast soul was sealed inside?</p><p>Qin Sang wondered, but he remained unmoved. Protected by the Jade Buddha, he wasn't afraid of this soul-level assault.</p><p>After hearing a muffled groan from beside him, Qin Sang glanced over to see Qiu Mu Bai's face flushed red, his spiritual energy fluctuating wildly as he fought the beast soul within the mark.</p><p>Qin Sang had an idea, and he also pretended to struggle, slowly suppressing the beast soul.</p><p>The beast soul was helpless against him; Qin Sang steadily gained the upper hand.  Gradually, the beast soul gave up its struggle and calmed down.</p><p>To truly tame it and make it his own would take some time, but Qin Sang found it far easier and quicker than Qiu Mu Bai.</p><p>This wasn't exactly good news, and Qin Sang was preoccupied.</p><p>Soon, Qiu Mu Bai and the others also managed to suppress the beast souls.</p><p>Qiu Mu Bai and Ji Qing were the fastest.</p><p>Seeing the time was right, Qin Sang stopped, a bit slower than the others, frowning at the mark on his wrist.</p><p>The mark had merged with his flesh, but no matter how many times Qin Sang scanned it with his spiritual sense, he couldn't detect anything—it was as if it didn't exist.</p><p>After they had suppressed the beast souls, Che Yutao said, "For the next six months, find a room in this manor to cultivate in seclusion. Put everything else aside, and absolutely tame the beast soul!"</p><p>Qin Sang opened his mouth to speak.</p><p>Qiu Mu Bai questioned doubtfully, "Master Che, I heard that even with the ancestor's protection, Foundation Establishment cultivators can't withstand the pressure of the outer spiritual array of Ziwei Palace.  We must be within the protection of the Ziwei Secret Realm to safely enter."</p><p>Che Yutao nodded.  "I've already asked the ancestor and Miss Chen Yan.  You just need to refine the Five Elements Beast Marks; don't worry about anything else.  The ancestor has a way to bring you in without needing the Ziwei Secret Realm."</p><p>The last person chosen was named Yu Wanshan, a disciple of a Golden Core cultivator whose Daoist name was Shoushanzi.</p><p>Upon hearing that he was to be taken to Ziwei Palace, he seemed distraught.  During the beast soul taming, he almost made a mistake due to his unsettled mind.</p><p>Yu Wanshan hesitated, stammering, "Master Che, I heard that the Ziwei Palace is fraught with danger.  A Yuan Ying expert perished there, even the Grand Master... what if something happens to us...?"</p><p>"Nonsense! What are you thinking?!"</p><p>Che Yutao glared at him, his face grim, sneering, "With your skills, you're barely qualified to scout the Ziwei Palace! The Grand Master only wants you to hold the Five Element Beast Seals, using their power to break a restriction. The seals have already chosen their masters, and I can't do anything about it. If any of you are afraid to die, go and explain yourselves to the Grand Master!"</p><p>Yu Wanshan, after being scolded, dared not say anything more, repeatedly saying, "I'm sorry, Master."</p><p>Che Yutao 'humph'ed, his expression softening slightly. He pointed at Qin Sang and the others, reproaching them with a mixture of anger and disappointment, "Think carefully. After this mission, if you gain the Grand Master's favor, after returning from the Ziwei Palace, will the Grand Master treat you poorly? This opportunity is something others would kill for, yet you hesitate!"</p><p>After a good scolding, Che Yutao continued, "You all should know that the Ziwei Palace has an inner and outer section. In the outer hall, you just need to follow the Grand Master and Miss Chenyan. However, when entering the inner hall, you might be randomly transported to different locations. Don't wander off; find a safe place and wait. The Grand Master and Miss Chenyan will find you according to the mark on your wrists. After breaking the restriction, follow the Grand Master's instructions. As long as you don't venture into dangerous areas, you'll be safe."</p><p>...</p><p>Qin Sang chose a room in Che Yutao's residence at random.  Entering the room, he closed the door, activated the protective barrier, and his expression immediately turned serious.</p><p>He sat in the chair for a long time, at a loss.</p><p>From Che Yutao's words, after the matter in the inner hall is settled, Dongyang Bo would no longer need them, and there might be a chance to escape.</p><p>However, Qin Sang also understood that this possibility was slim.  They followed Dongyang Bo into the depths of the secret realm and didn't have the ability to leave on their own.</p><p>Furthermore, in the Ziwei Palace's outer hall, Dongyang Bo and Chenyan protected them, which greatly reassured Yu Wanshan and the others. For Qin Sang, however, this was a major problem.</p><p>The follow-up cultivation techniques of the "Spirit-Nurturing Sword Chapter" and the Crimson Cloud Purple Fruit were equally important. If forced to change techniques, it would be almost impossible to find another one so suitable for him.</p><p>But if he didn't keep his promise and help Old Woman Jing kill Leng Yuntian, how could he persuade her to tell him about the place where Elder Qingzhu perished?</p><p>Qin Sang paced back and forth in the room.</p><p>Yun Youzi probably didn't have a good solution either. It was best to contact Old Woman Jing first and see if she could help him escape the Ziwei Palace.</p><p>Unfortunately, when they parted at Zhitain Peak, Old Woman Jing only told him to wait for her at Xuanlu Pass and didn't leave contact information. He didn't know when she would arrive.</p>
