<h1>Chapter 417: The Lure</h1><p>*Splash!*</p><p>The walls reverberated with the roar of water.</p><p>Golden light radiated, like a raging river, engulfing the robed figure, surrounding it on all sides.</p><p>Before the figure's imposing aura could reach the man in silver, it was forcefully suppressed by the array.</p><p>The robed figure swayed slightly, momentarily held in place by the golden light.</p><p>Undeterred, the figure attempted to mobilize spiritual energy to break the array.</p><p>Seeing the danger, the crowd in the hall scattered in panic. Only the VIPs in the upper rooms remained unmoved, yet none offered assistance to Mr. Kan.</p><p>Suppressing his anger, Mr. Kan suddenly shouted, “Senior, I respect your cultivation, but the auction rules cannot be broken! If you persist, I will destroy this array, even at the cost of my life, to teach you a lesson you will never forget!  I believe you sense the array's power. Even if you kill me, the cost will be unacceptable to you!”</p><p>The robed figure paused, looked at the surging golden light, and slowly retracted its gathering spiritual energy.</p><p>Mr. Kan's heart settled. His tone softened as he bowed to the robed figure, saying, “Senior, I understand your distress at losing your treasure, but are there not other precious herbs in the world besides Blood Essence? The Ancient Immortal battlefield is becoming increasingly dangerous, and cultivators from outside the pass are returning to the city. They may bring back even rarer herbs. Please be patient in your search. You will surely find what you seek.”</p><p>The robed figure coldly snorted and turned to leave.</p><p>Mr. Kan had already given up on befriending this person. This narrow-minded, volatile individual, abusing his cultivation to act arbitrarily, could be used, but getting too close might bring great misfortune.</p><p>Good riddance!</p><p>“Quickly escort the Senior to the tea room!”</p><p>Mr. Kan arranged for someone to escort the robed figure away, then sighed in relief, looking at the man in silver with a hint of surprise.</p><p>This man is remarkably composed.</p><p>Even when the robed figure's aura nearly reached him, the silver-clad man remained unmoved, a composure truly befitting a master cultivator. Far superior to the robed figure.  With sufficient talent, his future achievements will be considerable.</p><p>Cultivating a good relationship with him might be a great asset in the future.</p><p>“Are there any further bids?”</p><p>After a moment of silence, Mr. Kan presented the Blood Essence to the man in silver, announcing, “Fifteen thousand low-grade spirit stones. The Blood Essence belongs to this Daoist friend!”</p><p>“Next item…”</p><p>…</p><p>Ignoring the chaos at the auction, after leaving the hall, the robed figure was led by two beautiful girls to a tea room.</p><p>The tea room was within the array's range, making unauthorized departure impossible before the auction's end.</p><p>“Esteemed Senior, please have some tea…”</p><p>Two girls nervously offered fragrant tea.</p><p>The robed figure coldly shouted, “Leave!”</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>The girls, relieved, hastily put down the tea and scurried away.</p><p>The robed figure sat still. The face beneath the hood was Qin Sang!</p><p>At some point, he had left the Qingyang Market, arrived at Tianyou Pass, and caused this commotion at the auction.</p><p>There was no anger on his face, only an unusual calmness, his eyes thoughtful, seemingly considering something.</p><p>His disruptive behavior at the auction was a deliberate performance, not truly aimed at the Blood Essence; he had his own goals.</p><p>This required a prior understanding of Mr. Kan's style – someone who acts with measured restraint. Otherwise, failure could easily result in a fatal feud.</p><p>Silence fell in the tea room.  After a short while, Qin Sang's sitting still was interrupted by a trembling voice from outside, “Senior, the auction is over…”</p><p>Then, he was practically expelled.</p><p>Leaving the auction, Qin Sang quickly vanished into the shadows, quietly leaving Tianyou Pass. Gazing at the vast swampy plains, he pondered for a moment, then activated his幽罗云 (You Luo Yun, leaving this untranslated as it's likely a proper noun), flying at full speed towards the east.</p><p>That was the direction of Qingyang City!</p><p>Shortly after Qin Sang's departure, as dawn broke, a middle-aged man left Tianyou Pass.</p><p>His appearance was unremarkable, but his demeanor was refined, dressed in simple robes, like a scholar. Unfortunately, cultivators don't judge by appearance, but by cultivation.</p><p>His aura was weak, recently having broken through to the Foundation Establishment stage.</p><p>He left Tianyou Pass on foot, reaching the swamp, only then using his body skills to fly, his speed not particularly fast.</p><p>His purpose unclear, he flew aimlessly through the swamp, sometimes circling widely, for over half an hour, before landing on a withered tree.</p><p>He glanced behind him, confirming he wasn't being followed. A sneering laugh escaped his lips.  "Cowards! I didn't even try to hide, and they're too scared to follow!  Guess you old geezer got lucky!"</p><p>This man was the silver-robed individual targeted by Qin Sang at the auction.</p><p>Before his words fully died away, demonic energy surged from him, transforming him into a black streak of light that shot eastward.</p><p>His true aura finally revealed itself – a shockingly powerful False Core stage cultivator!</p><p>The light moved with extreme speed, quickly leaving the swamp behind.</p><p>Ahead lay a desolate landscape of countless mountains and valleys.</p><p>The silver-robed man didn't slow down, plunging deep into the mountain range.  After a short while, a surprised gasp escaped from within the escaping light, which then altered course and landed on a mountain peak.</p><p>The silver-robed man looked surprised, his gaze fixed on a massive dragon-like mountain range to the north.</p><p>A strange energy emanated from that direction.  It was the unique aura of a lost secret technique, the Heart-Eating Insect Gu. A memory from long ago.</p><p>Since the destruction of his sect, the Kui Yin Sect, the remaining Heart-Eating Insect Gus were destroyed along with the sect master during the Yuan Zhao Sect's self-destruction.  The technique was lost.</p><p>The Heart-Eating Insects were extinct. Even the insect corpses sealed within glaciers were incredibly rare.  The Kui Yin Sect had exhausted its resources to collect only a few.  Finding more would be nearly impossible.</p><p>After the sect's destruction, he and his master became fugitives, constantly hunted.  Only in the last decade or so, with the Xiaohan Region's cultivation world preoccupied by the spiritual tide and the Tianxing League, had the Yuan Zhao Sect become less aggressive, allowing them to emerge from hiding and operate openly.</p><p>Those who were once controlled by the Heart-Eating Insects had long since disappeared.</p><p>Yet, one had appeared here.</p><p>The silver-robed man stared intently. He recognized the mountain range; it housed a substantial spiritual vein and numerous excellent caves. The energy fluctuations indicated the person was immobile, likely cultivating within a cave.</p><p>"I didn't encounter them on my last visit.  Did this person just return from the Ancient Immortal Battlefield? I wonder which faction's pawn they are?"</p><p>The silver-robed man mused, "There are countless secret techniques in the world.  The ancestor’s poison and insect gu techniques are difficult to cure, but methods to suppress the insects might exist. Besides, if these are Heart-Eating Insect Gus planted before the sect's destruction, this person's cultivation might be formidable, perhaps even rivaling mine.  The insects alone may not be enough to control them…"</p>
