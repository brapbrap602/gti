      “So, it has still come to this…”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Han Xiao had already thought up many scenarios on their way to.
                He had a certain understanding of Ames. The air of a powerful
                being revolved around her. With her level, most things that were
                unsolvable to most other people could be fixed with a snap of
                her fingers. However, she was not one to be fond of thinking,
                and she mostly just did whatever she wanted.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      If they could, who would not want to live life like her? The
                power that Ames possessed guaranteed her a free life.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      On the other hand, this also meant that she was not a very
                ambitious person. The other four powerful beings who had
                surpassed class A had all built up their own factions, with
                Ames’ forces being the most carefree. She basically did not care
                about managing her ‘faction’. Ames seemingly did not have any
                ambitions, so the other civilizations and major powers in the
                Shattered Star Ring left her to her own devices as they did not
                want to get into conflict with this neutral party.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      The best way to deal with this kind of neutral character was to
                bait them with benefits. As long as they were treated kindly,
                and if could present to them with something of interest, then he
                most likely would not be in any serious danger in front of them.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Han Xiao just so happened to have something that might just
                pique Ames’ interest.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      As the force field slowly inched toward them and froze the air
                in the process, Han Xiao cleared his throat and said in a deep
                voice, “Please wait a moment, Your Excellency. I hope to offer a
                piece of information in exchange for the lives of myself and my
                group members. I believe that you will be interested in this.”
     </p>
     <div class="chapter-c">
     </div>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Ames lifted her finger, and the force field immediately stopped
                expanding, instead acting like a shapeless barrier that
                surrounded the group. Second Prince tried to poke at the barrier
                a few times and felt that the air just twenty centimeters away
                from the group had become rock solid.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Ames remained silent and looked at Han Xiao with amused eyes, as
                if telling him to speak quickly.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      She was not fond of killing people, so she wanted to hear what
                this little mercenary had to say to save himself. One’s struggle
                at the brink of death often made for the most entertaining show,
                and it might be able to cure her boredom for a short while. She
                did not care that these people were as good as formless ash in
                front of her and was willing to give her time to listen, just
                like how humans studied other animals.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Han Xiao prepared for a bit and then started his performance.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “It hasn’t been long since I came to the Shattered Star Ring,
                and I have mostly stayed in the Juberly Hub. One day, I met a
                person on the street. He looked like your usual Galaxy Human and
                didn’t seem to be too old. He was also dressed like an ordinary
                traveler. Just as we passed each other, he called out to me and
                said something made zero sense to me at the time…”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “What did he say?” hurried Herlous. He noticed that Ames was
                starting to yawn, seemingly losing interest in this story, and
                quickly tried to get Han Xiao to get into the main topic.
     </p>
     <div class="chapter-c">
     </div>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Han Xiao coughed and continued. “I was completely confused back
                then, as I didn’t know the man, let alone what he was talking
                about. But now, I finally got the meaning behind his words…”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “Oh my god, c’mon!” Herlous gritted his teeth. They were already
                at the point where they could almost see the reaper’s scythe on
                their necks, yet he was still trying to act dramatic‽ He still
                had a planet to save. He could not die there!
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “He said, ‘When you meet Ames, tell her to stop waiting. I still
                don’t want to see her.’”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Bang!
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      The force field collapsed instantly, knocking the surrounding
                people out of the room before they slammed back onto the ground.
                They were still grimacing from the pain when they saw Ames
                lazily getting up from her throne. However, her face was no
                longer expressionless and was instead filled with both joy and
                anger. It was like she had finally received the news that she
                was waiting for, but it turned out to be bad news.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      The people present were shocked as they did not know what could
                cause someone as powerful as her to suddenly lose control of her
                emotions and power.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Ames slowly floated down to the ground, and her black hair
                cascaded down to her legs. She stepped onto the warm and bony
                ground surface with her bare feet and slowly walked toward Han
                Xiao, with her power blasting out at maximum. She then
                questioned threateningly, “What did that person look like‽”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      The lower-ranked Dragon Guards were all knocked out by the force
                field’s collapse and were struggling to get back up on their
                feet even after they have recovered their senses. Han Xiao had
                to let out a deep breath to calm his nerves. Ames approached him
                with such a tremendous pressure around her that it was as if she
                could use the Conqueror’s Haki
      <sup class="calibre8">

      </sup>
      .
                It was difficult to just open his mouth. “I don’t remember the
                details, but he looked like a poor person with messy hair, and
                he didn’t appear to be different from the average passerby… Oh,
                I remember. The most notable thing about him were his eyes. His
                pupils were sort of shining, like…”
     </p>
     <div class="chapter-c">
     </div>
     <p class="calibre5">
      He pretended to be unsure about it, as if the word was stuck on
                the tip of his tongue.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “His eyes are dark like the emptiness of space, while his pupils
                are like a bright star in the endless darkness, lighting up the
                whole universe despite its flickering light… Is that what you
                mean?” asked Ames.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “Yes… yes, yes. That’s it.” Han Xiao could finally let out a
                deep breath. Ames must have thought about the person that he
                wanted her to think about it. The situation was under control.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Ames seemed to dwell in her memories as she murmured to herself,
                “Why don’t you want to see me? Does our promise mean nothing?
                Didn’t you agree to find me again when I became a big name in
                space?”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      The guard captain, Wilsander, was shocked. He had never seen
                this side of his boss. It was as if she had become an abandoned
                teenage girl in love, and he could hardly take it.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Ames was like a goddess in his heart. Strong, beautiful, and
                mysterious. He had been moved to his core the first time he saw
                her, and he had decided to give up on developing his own faction
                to instead work under her out of respect for her. He had stayed
                under her wing ever since, managing this chaotic dumpster day
                after day…
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Yes, he was secretly in love with his boss. This was also his
                motivation for doing his work.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      At this moment, Wilsander could not have been more jealous of
                those underlings who were blasted away by Ames’ sudden outburst.
                If he had been knocked out like them, he would not have had to
                witness this shocking scene.
     </p>
     <div class="chapter-c">
     </div>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “Who is that man that she’s speaking about? It can’t be her
                lover…” Wilsander felt bitter in his heart, but he also felt a
                strong sense of curiosity toward this mysterious person.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      After Ames got back to her senses, she returned to her throne
                and stared at Han Xiao for a good while before saying slowly,
                “Since he has already chosen you to send the message. I will
                give you two options—disintegrate into dust or work for me.”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “I am more than willing to work under you,” said Han Xiao.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Becoming Ames’s employee was much better than getting a
                game-over on the spot. Ames’ past was full of mystery, but Han
                Xiao knew her secret. A powerful character like Ames had been a
                focus of the players’ attention in the past. The players were
                able to put together her story from various mission
                descriptions, and this information was then released onto the
                forums. Han Xiao basically knew more about her than she did
                herself, as he also knew about her future.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      With the advantage of information, Han Xiao had finally chosen
                this plan to save himself and the others. The mysterious person
                that he had spoken of was a special person to Ames, and he held
                an important position in her heart. However, this person had
                gone missing a long time ago, and Ames had been constantly
                trying to hire mercenaries to look for him.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      That person was someone with genuine foresight ability. Making
                himself the messenger for that person automatically made Ames
                think that Han Xiao was important to him, and his life would no
                longer be in any immediate danger.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Ames had also never told anyone about this, so she would never
                suspect that Han Xiao somehow knew about her past and was using
                it to his advantage. In her eyes, it was far more probable that
                Han Xiao was simply a random small-time mercenary that person
                had predicted would go there and so was used as the messenger.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Who knew that even someone as strong as Ames would not even
                suspect Han Xiao’s words?
     </p>
     <div class="chapter-c">
     </div>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Although the Great Mechanic Han did not like being a
                replacement, he would not let his pride get in the way of his
                survival. Whenever his strength was clearly not enough, he would
                not foolishly try to fight his opponent head on.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Even if he had once been someone who was worshipped by all, he
                would never let this restrict his actions. Han Xiao had only
                been able to escape from Germinal all those years ago because he
                was able to hold himself back. He had no problem of doing it
                again.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      But of course, Ames was much better than Germinal. At least she
                was maintaining a neutral position, so Han Xiao would not be
                forced to burn any bridges with anyone. However, she was a
                million times more powerful than the Germinal Organization, and
                this meant that trying to escape from her clutches would be
                astronomically more difficult than getting out of the Germinal
                base. Even if Han Xiao tried all sorts of ways to make himself
                stronger, it would still undoubtedly be a long and arduous
                journey.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      This was not an optimal scenario for him, but even he could not
                go against the universal law of the strong ruling over the weak.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Han Xiao sighed secretly.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      He was afraid that for a good part of his future, he would have
                to tightly wear the label of the ‘Dragon Emperor’s Subordinate’
                around his head. That label was to be both a protective charm
                and a new responsibility.
