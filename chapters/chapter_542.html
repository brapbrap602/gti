<h1>Chapter 535: Unveiling the Secrets of the Ten Directions Yama King Banner</h1><p>Chapter 535: Unveiling the Secrets of the Ten Directions Yama King Banner</p><p>Qin Sang chose to flee westward.</p><p>Eastward lay the Endless Valley, where a beast tide had driven out even the most seasoned cultivators.</p><p>Southward was Qingyang Market Town, where hidden experts might lurk.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't want to shake off Wu Youdao only to be targeted by others, becoming a pawn in their game.</p><p>Westward stretched a vast territory of the Qingyang Demon Sect, an area of extremely thin spiritual energy, inhabited primarily by mortals.  No cultivators had established sects here.</p><p>At most, there might be a few disciples dispatched by various sects to manage the mortal populace; these individuals generally possessed low cultivation levels.</p><p>Wu Youdao and Qin Sang, one pursuing the other, flew over countless mountains, leaving Qingyang Demon Sect far behind.  They engaged in several skirmishes along the way.</p><p>Wu Youdao's innate treasure truly proved extraordinary. The gourd he wielded spewed Qingyang Demon Fire, not only exceptionally refined but also far more potent than ordinary flames.</p><p>Moreover, it was highly versatile, transforming from bladed weapons to a raging inferno at will.</p><p>In comparison, the Blackwood Sword felt too limited. Qin Sang had to rack his brains, employing various sword techniques to compensate, barely holding his own against Wu Youdao.</p><p>At that moment, Qin Sang clutched the Ten Directions Yama King Banner, secretly refining the treasure against the clock.</p><p>Only this banner could counter Wu Youdao's fiery gourd.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't use the Nine Dragon Heavenly Chariot Talisman. Its speed boost was limited, and he still vividly recalled Wu Youdao's sudden burst of speed using a secret technique earlier.</p><p>Wu Youdao likely sensed the Blackwood Sword's weakening and planned to wear him down gradually.</p><p>Qin Sang knew that unless he put up a good fight, showcasing his strength to force Wu Youdao's retreat, simply relying on the Nine Dragon Heavenly Chariot Talisman wouldn't help him escape.</p><p>It was better to keep it as a trump card and focus on refining the Ten Directions Yama King Banner.</p><p>Qin Sang had possessed the Ten Directions Yama King Banner for a long time, using it to slay several opponents, so his refining process was swift.</p><p>Previously, he'd utilized the banner by leveraging the power of the Ten Directions Yama Formation's main soul, understanding how to use it without knowing why.</p><p>In essence, he knew nothing about the Ten Directions Yama King Banner or the Nine Netherworld Demon Fire.</p><p>He didn't understand its internal workings, why it produced strange flames instead of countless souls when activated.</p><p>What was the relationship between the Nine Netherworld Demon Fire and the Ten Directions Yama King Banner?</p><p>As the refinement progressed, the banner's mysterious veil gradually lifted.</p><p>Qin Sang believed that a weapon-grade Ten Directions Yama King Banner needed to lure others into becoming its main soul and absorb countless soul powers to reach its full potential.</p><p>A treasure-grade one would undoubtedly require even more!</p><p>It wasn't merely the Kuiyin Sect's treasured artifact; it was Kuiyin Ancestor's famed treasure, once renowned throughout the Lesser Cold Region, inspiring fear in all who heard its name. Legend said that ten banners combined could rival a supreme treasure!</p><p>Qin Sang initially assumed it was an extremely wicked treasure, filled with countless devoured souls.</p><p>But as he gradually gained control, he realized he might have been wrong.</p><p>The Ten Directions Yama King Banner wasn't the hellish realm he imagined, devoid of countless tormented souls and mournful cries. It contained only one thingâ€”the Nine Netherworld Demon Fire!</p><p>The Nine Netherworld Demon Fire resembled a slumbering black dragon, coiled within the banner's space.</p><p>The deeper the refinement went, the stronger Qin Sang's feeling became that this treasure functioned primarily as a container for the Nine Netherworld Demon Fire. The treasure itself lacked combat capabilities, relying entirely on the flames to engage opponents.</p><p>He wasn't disappointed, however. Upon mastering the Nine Netherworld Demon Fire, he discovered that he'd previously only unleashed a fraction of its power.</p><p>The true Nine Netherworld Demon Fire was no less potent than the Qingyang Demon Fire in Wu Youdao's gourd.</p><p>Indeed, Qin Sang had a strange premonition that, while perhaps not as powerful as the Ancestor Saint Fire atop Divine Gang Peak, its peculiarities might surpass it.</p><p>He could see a clear connection between the Ancestor Saint Fire and the Qingyang Demon Fire. Its creation, even if not artificial, was undeniably linked to the Qingyang Demon Sect's ancestors.</p><p>Despite reading countless texts, Qin Sang remained clueless about the Nine Netherworld Demon Fire's origin.</p><p>This unique flame could never have been forged by humans.  How Kuiyin Ancestor managed to subdue it, making it so docile and obedient to its master, remained a mystery.</p><p>They flew over another river.</p><p>A plain appeared ahead, with a city faintly visible in the distance.</p><p>Qin Sang and Wu Youdao's flight created a considerable disturbance, alarming the mortals below.</p><p>Soldiers filled the city walls, gazing in terror at the two streaks of light.</p><p>As the saying goes, when gods fight, mortals suffer.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang finally refined the Ten Directions Yama Banner.  The banner automatically flew to his chest, its black flames flickering, about to burst forth.</p><p>Qin Sang looked around, changed direction, and flew away from the city towards the desolate mountains and wilderness.</p><p>Wu Youdao seized the opportunity.  His Fire Gourd flashed with green light, shooting a flame that transformed into a thick arrow, aimed directly at Qin Sang's heart.</p><p>This time, Qin Sang didn't intend to escape.  If he continued to flee, the true energy from the Corpse Pill would be exhausted.</p><p>He withdrew his Ebony Sword, pointed a finger at the Ten Directions Yama Banner, and a torrent of black flames immediately surged out.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>Two streams of fire collided in mid-air.</p><p>After the explosion, green and black flames danced wildly. The shockwave shattered a huge rock on a nearby mountain.</p><p>"Nine Nether Infernal Fire?"</p><p>Wu Youdao's pupils constricted. He instantly recognized the origin of the flames and demanded, "Ten Directions Yama Banner? Are you a remnant of the Kuiyin Sect?"</p><p>"Daoist Wu, open your eyes.  The Kuiyin Sect is nothing but dust and ashes. I wouldn't want to be associated with that cursed sect," Qin Sang cackled.</p><p>Inwardly, he sighed.  He couldn't fool Wu Youdao.</p><p>As fellow members of a demonic sect, they would naturally be intimately familiar with the Kuiyin Sect's famous treasures.</p><p>In this battle, Qin Sang had exposed both his Ebony Sword and Ten Directions Yama Banner.  He wasn't worried now, but he couldn't change his treasures, nor could he remain in seclusion forever.</p><p>Maintaining his disguise would be difficult. The Qingyang Demon Sect would eventually discover his involvement.</p><p>However, to escape quickly, Qin Sang didn't care about much else.</p><p>In Wu Youdao's eyes, Qin Sang was a genuine Golden Core cultivator.</p><p>Being discovered later wouldn't be a big deal.</p><p>He only stole a small amount of Qingyang Divine Energy and casually killed a Foundation Establishment disciple.</p><p>Qin Sang knew Wen Yanjie's background very well.</p><p>Would they pursue a Golden Core cultivator with ties to the Eight Righteous Sects for such a small grievance?</p><p>"Daoist Wu, how many times must I say it? I needed the Qiantian Energy. There was no other way. I had to infiltrate and steal a small piece of your sect's energy jade. I didn't touch anything else, let alone covet your sect's forbidden treasures. Why do you relentlessly pursue me?"</p><p>Qin Sang shouted while activating the Ten Directions Yama Banner.</p>
