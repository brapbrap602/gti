<h1>Chapter 2092: How Can We Stand Idly By?</h1><p>As everyone withdrew their True Essence, the mountains trembled, rocks tumbled down. Rivers flowed in reverse, the earth cracked open.</p><p>Dust and smoke billowed, cries of anguish filled the air, birds and beasts were in constant fear. The once blessed land of the Immortal Mountain was severely ravaged.</p><p>The disciples of the Green Ram Temple were awakened, and the horrifying sight that met their eyes filled them with dread.</p><p>They hadn't anticipated their sect's failure, and even if they had, they couldn't have imagined such dire consequences. Their new mountain gate seemed destined to become ruins, decades of the entire sect's hard work destroyed in an instant!</p><p>This failure dealt a heavy blow to the morale of the Green Ram Temple disciples.</p><p>Everyone flew into the sky, gazing towards the main peak.</p><p>The main peak was the highest, housing the temple's main hall and many other important places. The main hall, perpetually radiating a golden light, was the symbol of the Green Ram Temple.  Originally, this brilliant golden light and the shadow of the main peak could be seen from anywhere within the sect.</p><p>Now, smoke and dust filled the air, obscuring the golden light from the main peak. The entire sky was grey, mirroring the gloom in their hearts.</p><p>Those with higher cultivation levels could sense something amiss. This wasn't a normal mishap, but someone forcibly interrupting their formation merging.  They needed answers.</p><p>Just as everyone was filled with apprehension, a myriad of golden rays suddenly shot out from the main peak. While the golden light couldn't completely dispel the haze, it did calm their minds.</p><p>A chime rang out, and the Temple Master's voice echoed throughout the mountain gate.</p><p>"The Changyou Clan has invaded, the North Sea is in danger! Disciples at the Golden Core realm and above, quickly follow me to the North Sea! The remaining disciples, obey my commands!"</p><p>This was another heavy blow, weighing heavily on everyone's minds, but they also understood why the Temple Master made this choice.</p><p>Even disregarding the larger situation, the North Star Realm was where the Green Ram Temple's ancestral grounds lay, along with various branch temples. Many fellow disciples were stationed in the North Sea, and they couldn't abandon them to their fate.</p><p>Furthermore, the experts from other sects were invited by them, which led to the North Sea's vulnerability, giving the enemy an opportunity.  For the sake of both public good and private loyalty, they must save the North Sea first!</p><p>Only in times of extreme peril would the Temple Master issue commands with the Golden Talisman, disobedience being considered treason. Within the Green Ram Temple, all Golden Core and Nascent Soul cultivators dared not hesitate, immediately flying towards the main peak.</p><p>Meanwhile, beneath the golden light, massive shadows emerged, revealing numerous spirit boats.</p><p>Green Ram Temple disciples converged on the main peak from all directions.  Some with keen minds noticed something unusual, doubts forming in their minds.</p><p>Why was the enemy's attack so precisely timed?</p><p>The Nascent Soul cultivators were also puzzled. The Green Ram Temple's invitations were kept secret, and they had only stayed at the temple for a few months at most.</p><p>The Changyou Clan not only seized the perfect opportunity, but all signs indicated that such a large-scale offensive was beyond their previous deployment in the North Sea. They must have been plotting this for a long time, secretly mobilizing their forces into the North Sea.</p><p>"Temple Master Li!"</p><p>Fairy Qiuzhi's brows furrowed tightly. "How many people knew about this matter?"</p><p>Li Yufu forced a smile. "Shortly after the construction of the mountain gate began, this poor Daoist ordered the mountain sealed, refusing all visitors. This time, I personally visited each of you to request your assistance, and there shouldn't have been any leaks. Only at the very beginning, when we decided to rebuild the mountain gate, were there some fellow Daoists who visited, but they were all highly respected individuals..."</p><p>"Hearts are unpredictable, Temple Master Li, you were careless!" Han Xi wrung his hands.</p><p>"If someone truly leaked this information intentionally, their crime is unforgivable!" Qiu Mubai said coldly.</p><p>It was too late for regrets now. They had to return immediately. If the Changyou Clan attacked the Crescent Moon Realm, the situation would be dire.</p><p>Li Yufu summoned a few direct disciples, gave them some instructions, and then, along with the Nascent Soul cultivators, set off to reinforce the North Sea.</p><p>After Li Yufu and the others left, the Green Ram Temple began frantic preparations. Disciples boarded the spirit boats, one after another, piercing through the sky and disappearing into the horizon.</p><p>At this moment, the panicked Green Ram Temple disciples didn't realize that all the Nascent Soul experts, including the Temple Master, had left. No one remained to control the conflicting formations, yet the collapse didn't continue indefinitely.</p><p>Unknown changes were taking place within the mountain gate.  Quietly, the apocalyptic scene began to subside.</p><p>Within the forbidden grounds.</p><p>Qin Sang sat cross-legged on the altar, his palm open, facing the sky.</p><p>His divine sense and True Essence extended outwards, eventually encompassing the entire Green Ram Temple. Every mountain, every river, every plant, every tree, all within his grasp.</p><p>Qin Sang was aware of every change within the Green Ram Temple, including the collapsing protective formation. The formation, which required the combined efforts of multiple Nascent Soul cultivators to activate, was now under his sole control.</p><p>The formation had collapsed in many places, and adjacent sub-formations clashed with each other, not only failing to merge but also continuing to collide, shaking the spiritual veins and causing the earth to tremble.</p><p>With a subtle thought, Qin Sang slowly lifted his palm. Silently, all the spiritual veins stabilized. The chaos on the surface hadn't completely subsided, but that was merely superficial.</p><p>Next, Qin Sang took control of all the sub-formations. The cracks in the undamaged sub-formations rapidly closed, and the formation artifacts restored themselves.</p><p>During the construction of the protective formation, Li Yufu had refined extra components and stored them in the treasury.  Now, Qin Sang retrieved them, sending them to the damaged sub-formations.</p><p>Soon, all the sub-formations were restored to their original state.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression remained calm.  He suddenly clenched his palm. The Green Ram Temple had invested heavily in this protective formation, so naturally, it couldn't simply be used as bait and left to be destroyed.</p><p>With Qin Sang present, a complete reversal was possible!</p><p>Even the combined efforts of multiple Nascent Soul cultivators activating the formation required extreme caution, yet Qin Sang managed it alone with seemingly no effort.  In his mind, this wasn't even the complete protective formation.</p><p>Without any surprises, the formation took shape in Qin Sang's hands, transforming into an invisible force encircling the mountain gate.</p><p>This play still needed to continue. Qin Sang didn't immediately activate the formation; the chaos on the ground persisted.</p><p>...</p><p>"Temple Master Li, Palace Master Tong, I'm afraid you two will have to personally write to the Yao Clan, the Wu Clan, and the various sects of the Central Continent, requesting their assistance to resolve this crisis."</p><p>The Thunder Palace Master, surnamed Li, known as Palace Master Li, wore a carefree cap and thunder-patterned Daoist robes. His long beard reached his chest, his eyes sharp, and his face angular.</p><p>By the time they returned to the North Sea, who knew how dire the situation would be?  Even if they gathered their forces, they could only delay the Changyou Clan's advance, not counterattack.</p><p>To repel the Changyou Clan, reinforcements from the Central Continent were essential.</p><p>"Yu Wang's secret message should arrive soon.  A general in the field should adapt to circumstances. I can also write a letter in Yu Wang's name," Han Xi interjected.</p><p>With Qin Sang in the Green Ram Temple and Liu Li in the Profound Sky Palace, these two sects were regarded as sacred grounds, holding immense prestige in the Storm Realm. Combined with the North Sea Yao Clan, their influence was substantial.</p><p>"Indeed!"</p><p>Li Yufu nodded and, together with Tong Lingyu and Han Xi, carefully worded their letters, explaining the situation, and finally sent them to the various clans and sects in their joint names.</p><p>...</p><p>Meanwhile, the Central Continent had already received news of the North Sea attack, but their primary concern was the Western Wilderness.</p><p>As expected, the Western Wilderness was also under fierce assault by the Changyou Clan army, engulfed in flames of war.</p><p>The Changyou Clan attacked the North Sea while simultaneously threatening the Western Wilderness. This offensive came without warning, and the Western Wilderness was in dire straits.</p><p>Western Wilderness, Great Sorrow Zen Temple.</p><p>The original Great Sorrow Zen Temple was destroyed shortly after the Changyou Clan conflict, forcing them to relocate inland. Master Huaiyin led the Western Wilderness monks, rebuilding the temple around the ancient teleportation formation that led to the Central Continent.</p><p>Facing a formidable enemy, the people of the Western Wilderness were united.  The sects of the Central Continent also understood that if the Western Wilderness fell, they would lose their most formidable barrier. They spared no effort to reinforce the Western Wilderness, safeguarding this ancient teleportation formation, with significant contributions from the Green Ram Temple, Profound Sky Palace, and other North Sea forces.</p><p>This teleportation formation was located within the Great Sorrow Zen Temple. For centuries, despite all hardships, it had remained intact.</p><p>Now, the Great Sorrow Zen Temple also served as the headquarters for the Western Wilderness Allied Forces.</p><p>The Allied Forces comprised not only Western Wilderness cultivators but also those from the Central Continent, the Yao Sea and Eastern Sea Yao Clans, the Wu Clan, and the Canglang Sea.  Additionally, the Green Ram Temple's main branch, having relocated to Luye, also dispatched many disciples to defend the Western Wilderness.</p><p>The internal factions of the Allied Forces were complex. If they acted independently, it would create significant hidden dangers.  After suffering several setbacks, the various clans and sects established a set of rules.</p><p>Each faction, based on their respective regions, appointed a high-ranking expert as their leader, permanently stationed in the Western Wilderness.</p><p>The Allied Forces also required a supreme commander. Initially, Liu Li was the natural choice.  As the strength of each clan and sect gradually increased, Liu Li no longer needed to personally lead and relinquished the position. At that time, the human race was powerful, with the Three Teachings Alliance being the strongest. Gradually, a system of rotation emerged among the Eight Scenery Temple, the Sweet Dew Zen Monastery, and the Heavenly Hao Tower.</p><p>Master Huaiyin was the local authority, but his cultivation and prestige were somewhat lacking. However, his position was unique. While not the supreme commander, all matters concerning the Western Wilderness required consultation with him.</p><p>Over time, the Three Teachings Alliance's authority grew, but they hadn't anticipated that their greatest threat wouldn't come from Liu Li, but from the Yao Clan.</p><p>The Yao Clans of the Eastern Sea and Yao Sea were growing stronger, but they hadn't yet directly challenged the Allied Forces' leadership. The current supreme commander was still from the Three Teachings Alliance, Elder Fan Laomo of the Heavenly Hao Tower.</p><p>After Sect Master Yu's death, Fan Laomo had aspired to become the new Sect Master, but Elder Kurong proved superior, leaving him to remain as an elder.</p><p>Great Sorrow Zen Temple.</p><p>The atmosphere within the main hall was heavy. Fan Laomo, Master Huaiyin, and the high-ranking experts from each region were gathered together.</p><p>Among them were many of Qin Sang's old acquaintances, such as Sect Master Mu representing the Wu Clan, Yuan Zhu representing the Yao Sea Yao Clan, and Bao Xi representing the Canglang Sea.</p><p>"What are your thoughts, everyone?"</p><p>Fan Laomo sat in the commander's seat, with Master Huaiyin to his left.  He swept his gloomy gaze across the crowd, finally settling on Master Huaiyin.</p><p>Master Huaiyin pondered for a moment.  "This poor monk just personally investigated the front lines and confirmed with multiple fellow Daoists that the Changyou Clan's attack, while appearing ferocious, hasn't actually increased their troop numbers significantly. Their main force remains the same as those previously stationed in the Western Wilderness, and we haven't seen any of their clan elders."</p><p>Bao Xi pressed, "So, we can confirm that the Changyou Clan's main target is the North Sea?"</p><p>"How do we know it isn't a feint to lure us east while they strike west!"</p><p>Fan Laomo furrowed his brows, interrupting Bao Xi without hesitation, and fixed his gaze on Master Huaiyin. "Holy Monk, are you certain you've ascertained the enemy's true intentions? If our judgment is mistaken, the consequences will be dire!"</p><p>"This..."</p><p>Master Huaiyin hesitated.</p><p>The matter was of great importance, and no one had absolute certainty.</p><p>Fan Laomo looked around at everyone. "Fellow Daoists must understand that on the battlefield, what appears true can be false, and what appears false can be true. Perhaps the Changyou Clan's attack on the North Sea is a ruse, and their true target is us. We must be cautious!"</p><p>Bao Xi anxiously said, "The North Sea's first line of defense has fallen, and they're retreating steadily. Isn't that enough to demonstrate the gravity of the situation?"</p><p>"That's the North Sea's own fault!" Fan Laomo snorted. "If the Green Ram Temple hadn't taken away so many Nascent Soul cultivators, leaving the North Sea vulnerable, none of this would have happened!"</p><p>Yuan Zhu's eyes flickered, and he shook his head. "Elder Fan's words are biased. The Green Ram Temple only took away a portion of the experts, and the North Sea's main army hasn't moved. They've been established there for many years, yet they collapsed in a single battle without any resistance. The enemy's strength is evident. Moreover, Changyou Clan elders have repeatedly appeared in the North Sea. They can't possibly be simultaneously targeting both the North Sea and the Central Continent. Even if they have troops hidden in the Western Wilderness, we can hold them off."</p><p>Fan Laomo coldly questioned, "Elder Yuan Zhu, you must have consulted with the Dragon King and the Golden Toad King. Is this their opinion as well?"</p><p>Yuan Zhu's expression stiffened. He had sent several messages, all of which had vanished without a trace. He had no idea what his clan was thinking.</p><p>A sneer appeared on Fan Laomo's lips.  At this moment, Sect Master Mu suddenly interjected, "What are the Three Teachings Alliance's plans?"</p><p>Fan Laomo couldn't be too blatant, so he composed himself and said, "As everyone knows, our three Sect Masters have already entered seclusion to refine a spiritual treasure to counter the Heavenly Tribulation of the late Nascent Soul stage. Their seclusion grounds are sealed by a powerful formation, and even I dare not intrude. Currently, overseeing the Three Teachings Alliance headquarters are True Monarch Qishen of the Eight Scenery Temple and Holy One Yinci of the Sweet Dew Zen Monastery. Their prestige doesn't match that of the three Sect Masters, making it difficult to command all parties. The two haven't replied yet, so they must be rallying the various sects and clans for discussion.  As for our next move, it depends on how the situation develops."</p><p>"Elder Fan, are you saying that the Three Teachings Alliance can't immediately reinforce the North Sea? Can't we divide our forces and address both fronts?" Sect Master Mu pressed.</p><p>Fan Laomo calmly replied, "True Monarch Qishen and Holy One Yinci will carefully consider whether to divide our forces. You must understand that reaching the North Sea isn't as convenient as reaching the Western Wilderness. If our forces are diverted and the Western Wilderness is in danger, it will be difficult to reinforce them later."</p><p>Before he finished speaking, someone suddenly exclaimed, "Unacceptable!"</p><p>Fan Laomo's gaze turned cold, but he realized the speaker was Master Huaiyin. He frowned and asked, "Holy Monk, what do you mean?"</p><p>"Years ago, when our temple was in ruins and the Western Wilderness fell, Fairy Liu Li and the fellow Daoists from the North Sea came to our aid, fighting valiantly.  This poor monk vividly remembers those days and has always been grateful, unable to repay their kindness. Now, Fairy Liu Li is seriously injured, also because of her battle with the Changyou Clan Patriarch. Otherwise, we wouldn't have obtained so much Azure Spirit Qi.  The North Sea is in danger, how can we stand idly by?"</p><p>Master Huaiyin's expression was solemn.</p><p>He was the leader of the Western Wilderness and the abbot of the Great Sorrow Zen Temple.  His words represented the will of the entire Western Wilderness, carrying significant weight. Even Fan Laomo couldn't directly refute him.</p><p>Sect Master Mu and the others were overjoyed and echoed his sentiment.  It was indeed the right thing to do.</p><p>Not only the Western Wilderness but also the Yao Sea and Canglang Sea had benefited from their aid.  If Liu Li hadn't stepped forward, leading the experts from the Central Continent and North Sea to reinforce them, they would have long perished, their homes destroyed.</p><p>However, not everyone possessed a grateful heart.</p><p>Fan Laomo hadn't expected Master Huaiyin to be the first to speak out and cursed inwardly, "It seems even the Buddhist sects aren't monolithic. I wonder what those bald donkeys from the Sweet Dew Zen Monastery are doing!"</p><p>Just then, someone shouted from outside the hall.</p><p>"Report!  Secret message from the Green Ram Temple!"</p>
