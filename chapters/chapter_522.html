<h1>Chapter 515: So-Called Chance Encounter?</h1><p>Chapter 515: So-Called Chance Encounter?</p><p>“Forget it!”</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head. He wasn't interested in sightseeing inside a corpse puppet bag anyway.</p><p>The *Heavenly Yin Corpse Manual* describes two types of containers for storing corpses. The first half only mentions a corpse coffin for low-level disciples—too conspicuous; carrying a large coffin around is hard to miss.</p><p>However, even ordinary corpse puppet bags are difficult to obtain. The vast majority of corpse path demonic cultivators use this method to store their corpses.</p><p>This includes the Qingyang Sect disciple who bought his refined corpse. They would usually buy a coffin-shaped artifact along with the corpse.</p><p>Qin Sang had anticipated this, preparing a coffin in advance.  His previous preparations were all to account for this possibility.</p><p>He stood the coffin upright.</p><p>Qin Sang opened the coffin lid and stepped inside.</p><p>The coffin flashed with black light, shrinking slightly to perfectly fit Qin Sang's size.</p><p>After feeling it out, Qin Sang stepped out of the coffin, returning to his previous seated position. He opened his dimensional pouch and took out the jade box containing the Golden Core of Daoist Jiupao.</p><p>He needed to complete the first two steps of refining the Flying Night Rakshasa here:  introducing the core into his body and merging it with his own.</p><p>This was because he planned to infiltrate the Qingyang Sect disguised as a corpse cultivator.</p><p>Aside from the ebony sword which housed his primordial spirit and the rarely recognized Void Heaven Thunder, he couldn't carry anything else.</p><p>The Ten Directions Yama Formation, the Ten Directions Yama Banner…</p><p>Even the Nine Dragon Heavenly Chariot Talisman in his dantian had been removed long ago and stored in his dimensional pouch; he would hide it not far from the mountain gate before entering the Qingyang Sect.</p><p>He was essentially going in bare, and no precaution was excessive.</p><p>If the Flying Night Rakshasa wasn't severely injured, his chances would be higher. But this was a fleeting opportunity; he couldn't keep waiting for the Rakshasa to recover.</p><p>It had been quite some time since he obtained Daoist Jiupao's Golden Core, yet it remained stunningly beautiful, as if alive, radiating a strange light.</p><p>Qin Sang released the restrictions on the jade box and held the Golden Core in his hand.</p><p>Of these two steps, introducing the core into his body was the most dangerous. His dantian might not be able to withstand the core's impact, leading to a loss of control in his energy sea, causing his body to collapse and explode.</p><p>Qin Sang held the Golden Core, sensing the fluctuations in its power, while recalling the details of the last time he refined a Flying Night Rakshasa.</p><p>He clearly remembered the most dangerous part was the earth-sunder pill refinement stage. However, that was for later. His current priority was infiltrating the Qingyang Sect.</p><p>While introducing the core had its complications, the process went relatively smoothly. Now that he was doing it himself, he should be able to control it better.</p><p>The second step would be much easier and the least worrisome.</p><p>While contemplating, Qin Sang continued familiarizing himself with the Golden Core.</p><p>He’d been doing this ever since he'd acquired it, so it didn't take long before he gently held the Golden Core and slowly moved it towards his abdomen.</p><p>During this process, Qin Sang manipulated the restrictions on his body to establish a connection with the Golden Core, reducing its rejection of him.</p><p>Time slowly passed, and the Golden Core drew closer to Qin Sang's dantian.</p><p>A familiar scene unfolded: the Golden Core gradually became enveloped by the restrictions. Initially, it resisted, but with time, it gradually calmed down.</p><p>“Go in,”</p><p>Qin Sang sighed, pressing the Golden Core towards his dantian.</p><p>‘Whoosh… whoosh…’</p><p>A surge of demonic energy rolled, and the Golden Core sank within.</p><p>A sudden, intense pain struck.</p><p>Qin Sang furrowed his brow, enduring the agony, waiting until the chaos in his dantian reached its peak, nearing its breaking point, before using his willpower to extract the Golden Core.</p><p>He had experience, and he was patient.  He tried repeatedly, silently observing the changes. Since it was his own body, the progress was much faster than the last time he refined Yu Hua.</p><p>Finally, the Golden Core entered his energy sea completely, settling in its center.</p><p>At this moment, the Golden Core suddenly released incredibly terrifying power, instantly sweeping in all directions.</p><p>No wonder Yu Hua, already dead at the time, had let out a cry of intense pain at this very moment. This kind of pain truly was unbearable.</p><p>Qin Sang was prepared. He spread his hands, instantly drawing two objects into his palms: a handful of spirit pills in one hand and the Shao Yin magnetic bottle in the other.</p><p>He exerted all his strength to suppress the Golden Core, consuming spirit pills when his spiritual energy depleted, and replenishing the earth-sunder energy with the Shao Yin bottle.</p><p>Everything went smoothly. The chaos gradually subsided, and the Golden Core's radiance retracted, floating in his energy sea.</p><p>Qin Sang breathed a sigh of relief, realizing that his spirit pills and the earth-sunder energy in the Shao Yin bottle were both about 80% depleted. Fortunately, during the next pill refinement stage, because he had the Qian Tian Gang Qi to replace half the energy, the earth-sunder energy consumption would be significantly reduced, meaning he wouldn't need to prepare so much.</p><p>An hour later, Qin Sang proceeded to the next step: merging the core with his own.</p><p>Qin Sang peered into his dantian. As he focused, his golden core slowly rotated, appearing intimately connected to him.  However, he knew he couldn't control it; it was all an illusion created by the restrictions placed upon him.</p><p>Finally finished, Qin Sang discovered the cave was bathed in the morning light.</p><p>After checking himself and confirming his golden core wasn't about to rebel, he left the cave.  He carefully erased all traces of his presence before heading straight for the Qingyang Demon Sect.</p><p>Along the way, he took out two storage pouches.</p><p>One was his own, containing valuable treasures like the Ten Directions Yama Banner, which he planned to hide near the sect.</p><p>The other was pre-prepared.  Besides the Xuantian Thunder, it held various items—lesser yin magnetic bottles, talismans, spirit stones, and pills—all of decent quality, roughly equivalent to the assets of a mid-Foundation Establishment cultivator.</p><p>Having lost his Sword Qi Thunder Sound ability, Qin Sang felt uncertain.  After much deliberation, he decided to bring the Xuantian Thunder, just in case.</p><p>The Xuantian Thunder was unremarkable in appearance; unless activated, it was just a grey bead, and the lightning within wouldn't constantly flash.</p><p>Qin Sang tossed it into the miscellaneous items in the pouch, among similar-looking beads. The Xuling Sect hadn't produced a Xuantian Thunder in a long time; even their own disciples might not recognize one, let alone outsiders. This powerful artifact was almost legendary; Qin Sang only knew about it thanks to Old Lady Jing.</p><p>Also included was a jade slip containing the Heavenly Corpse Sect's corpse refinement technique, heavily altered by Qin Sang.</p><p>The most crucial modification was changing the method of raising a living corpse to a Flying Night Rakshasa, replacing the Earthly Fiend Qi with a combination of Earthly Fiend Qi and Primordial Heaven Gang Qi.</p><p>The power of the resulting Flying Night Rakshasa was also reduced by Qin Sang to the level of a False Core cultivator.</p><p>He removed the part detailing the backlash from the corpse refinement, ensuring the recipient would have no worries. A Flying Night Rakshasa was too powerful; even without explicit warnings, anyone obtaining the technique would be suspicious.  Qin Sang couldn't afford to wait, and False Core strength was acceptable.</p><p>He wouldn't sell it in the market; the risks were too great.</p><p>He planned to give a Qingyang Demon Sect disciple an 'opportunity'!</p><p>With the storage pouches prepared, Qin Sang took out the corpse of the Kuiyin Sect remnant.</p>
