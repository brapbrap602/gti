<h1>Chapter 404: Bloodwood</h1><p>(I got drunk celebrating at home and forgot to update. My apologies.</p><p>Two chapters are released together. Happy New Year to everyone in advance!</p><p>It's the New Year, so let's give Qin Sang a little sweetness as a New Year's gift.  No more saying I mistreat the protagonist, it's supposed to be a satisfying read ^_^)</p><p>Qin Sang, clinging to the warmth provided by the Red Dan, struggled against the biting wind. He constantly monitored the Red Dan in his hand, silently calculating the time. He had to leave the deep cave before the Red Dan burned out; otherwise, his life would be in danger, and any treasures would be meaningless.</p><p>He moved swiftly, falling at great speed. He didn't know how far he had descended, and hadn't seen any sign of the supposed celestial treasures.</p><p>Unbeknownst to him, the ice layer had disappeared, revealing frozen earth beneath.  Even after passing through the thick ice layer, he still hadn't found the source of the Xuan Frost Gale.</p><p>Where did this gale originate, and what caused it? Qin Sang marveled silently, continuing downwards along the frozen earth. He found the cave opening up, revealing a vast abyss in its deepest part.  The abyss was bottomless, filled with wisps of greenish wind, like swimming fish.  As they swam towards the cave entrance, they would be caught by the wind column, merging into it and carried outside.</p><p>Qin Sang dared not enter the abyss. These greenish winds were the essence of the Xuan Frost Gale.  Even a strand the size of his forearm would instantly freeze him solid.</p><p>Had he guessed wrong? Was there nothing here? Or was the Thunder Swallowing Falcon's nest still below the abyss? After all, with the Thunder Swallowing Falcon's strength, it wouldn't fear the Xuan Frost Gale.</p><p>It seemed he had made a fruitless journey. Qin Sang sighed inwardly, clenching his fist. The Red Dan in his palm was already half consumed, and staying here was pointless.</p><p>Just as he was about to return, Qin Sang's eyes narrowed, and he turned to stare at a distant section of the cave wall, seemingly noticing something. His figure stopped abruptly.</p><p>After a moment's hesitation, Qin Sang followed the wall, and soon discovered several protruding boulders concealing a dark opening. The opening wasn't large, only about a person's height, wide enough for three people to pass side-by-side, perfectly hidden by the rocks.</p><p>Could this be the Thunder Swallowing Falcon's nest? For a Thunder Swallowing Falcon whose wings could blot out the sun, this cave seemed too small.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't understand the Thunder Swallowing Falcon's habits, and his expression was somewhat hesitant. He slowly released his spiritual sense, probing into the cave. He found no restrictions inside; the cold wind poured into the stone cave, just as cold as outside.</p><p>It looked like a naturally formed, rough stone cave.</p><p>After a moment's thought, Qin Sang checked his escape techniques, ensured his concealment, and cautiously entered the cave.</p><p>The cave was deep. After walking some distance, Qin Sang's eyes changed slightly.  A faint warmth emanated from the depths of the cave, and the cold wind's power was weakened.</p><p>A few more steps forward, and a faint red glow shimmered in the deep cave, causing Qin Sang to be somewhat surprised.</p><p>Qin Sang looked at the Red Dan in his hand, pursed his lips, gritted his teeth, and leaped forward.</p><p>A wave of heat washed over him, instantly dispelling the cold from his body.  Then came an overwhelmingly intense surge of spiritual energy, invigorating Qin Sang and filling him with wonder.</p><p>The most spiritually rich place he had ever seen was the cave behind Mount Shaohua, where he'd stayed during his foundation establishment after passing the test of the Red Dust Gourd. That mountain was the location of the ancestral master Dongyang Bo's cave dwelling, where all the spiritual veins of the sect converged; even his own spiritual spring cave couldn't compare.</p><p>And that cave was far inferior to this one.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes widened as he surveyed the cave before him.  The cave was so close to the Xuan Frost Gale, yet it wasn't cold at all; it was exceptionally warm. This was because a red river flowed within the cave – not an ordinary lava river, but an underground fiery vein!</p><p>Beside this fiery vein, a clear stream flowed in parallel. This stream was even more extraordinary – a river of spiritual energy drawn from a spiritual spring!</p><p>A spiritual spring forming a river!</p><p>The underground fiery vein and the spiritual energy river were on either side, their influence shaping the cave's landscape.  Beside the fiery vein on the left, clusters of jade-like plants grew, resembling a type of red coral. The banks of the spiritual energy river, however, were lush with greenery, full of life.</p><p>Two vastly different scenes coexisted in a single cave, complementing each other, distinctly separate, extraordinarily unique.</p><p>Upon seeing the full view of the cave, Qin Sang was certain – this was the Thunder Swallowing Falcon's nest!</p><p>Such a cave was exceedingly rare and precious, attainable only by transformed-stage great demons or Nascent Soul ancestors.  Only they had the ability to find and occupy such a place.</p><p>Qin Sang was amazed by the wondrous sights within the cave, his eyes quickly scanning the surroundings before disappointment crept onto his face.  The underground magma vein and the spirit river were bordered by the most ordinary plants; not a single one resembled a heavenly treasure.  Even he wouldn't bother with these, so what could warrant such effort from two Yuan Ying cultivators?</p><p>Wait, where was the source of the spirit river? The spring?</p><p>Qin Sang focused his gaze on the depths of the cave, carefully entering and silently landing on the flat ground between the two rivers.  After moving a short distance, he finally reached their source.</p><p>A jade pool, crafted from spirit jade, came into view.  The circular pool was dozens of meters in diameter, exquisitely made, each piece of jade meticulously polished.  The underground magma vein and the spirit river both originated from this pool! The two distinctly different "rivers" each occupied half of the pool.  In the very center, a silvery lightning orb floated serenely on the surface.</p><p>The pool was like a nest, nurturing the orb.  Flashes of lightning flickered within the orb.  Even a single strand of lightning possessed terrifying power!</p><p>Sensing the orb's might, Qin Sang felt a pang of fear and dared not approach.  Inside the orb, seemingly tiny white fragments existed, constantly battered by the lightning yet unharmed, their material unknown.</p><p>However, what truly captivated Qin Sang was something else within the pool.  In the clear half of the pool, the spring itself, a striking crimson light shot upwards, staining the water a faint, bloody red, creating an eerie sight.  Upon closer inspection, Qin Sang saw that the light emanated from a blood-red spirit wood.</p><p>The wood was the color of blood, a dark, crimson stain, its foul aura impossible to conceal even in the clearest spring water.  The first words that came to mind were decay, withering, and other similarly depressing terms.</p><p>Qin Sang was stunned, then a sudden realization sparked in his mind, filling him with shock and overwhelming joy.</p><p>"This...is it the Interminable Blood Mulberry?"</p><p>Qin Sang murmured, his gaze fixated on the wood, unable to tear himself away.  The Interminable Blood Mulberry, one of the ten greatest sacred trees in the world, a legendary tree of ultimate defilement!</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly recalled a secret mentioned by Yun Youzi:  Wuyaya Valley once produced an Interminable Blood Mulberry, which was shattered during a dispute between Yuan Ying cultivators. The fragments scattered throughout the valley, with many cultivators searching in vain for them.</p><p>Could this piece of blood wood be a fragment of that very Mulberry, broken and landing here, nurtured in the spring by the Thunder Hawk?</p>
