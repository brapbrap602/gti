<h1>Chapter 471:  The Void Thunder</h1><p>Chapter 471:  The Void Thunder</p><p>After a prolonged struggle,</p><p>an unexpected scene unfolded.</p><p>In the midst of the chaotic battle, a sharp ‘crack’ suddenly echoed, signifying the depletion of a talisman’s power and its complete destruction.</p><p>The first talisman to be destroyed was the young man’s warhammer!</p><p>Qin Sang’s blue mirror, though considerably dimmer than before, still held on.</p><p>The young man was stunned. He never expected his talisman to be the first to fail, especially since he had only used it twice, while Qin Sang’s blue mirror had clearly been used far more often.</p><p>This unexpected turn nearly threw the young man off balance. He hastily pulled another talisman from his pouch.</p><p>The moment the warhammer shattered, Qin Sang’s eyes lit up; she knew her opportunity had arrived.</p><p>Seeing the young man fumbling, even producing another talisman, Qin Sang’s eyes flashed with disdain.</p><p>The battle raged.</p><p>His opponent pressed relentlessly; there was no way he could prepare another talisman.</p><p>Unless he had some special means of buying time.</p><p>The power of the blue mirror talisman was clearly waning.  If she could just hold her ground, using other artifacts to get through this period until the talisman broke, they would be back on equal footing.</p><p>The young man's cultivation was high, and he possessed many treasures; this should have been easy for him.</p><p>No cultivator who had spent even a year training in the Turbulent Isles waters should make such a mistake.</p><p>“Go!”</p><p>Qin Sang hissed, controlling the blue mirror as it arced across the air, striking with exceptional cunning while the young man was momentarily stunned.</p><p>The young man finally realized his folly, his expression turning flustered. He quickly put away the talisman, taking out a flying sword and hastily summoning it to intercept the blue mirror.</p><p>This flying sword was peculiar; the front half of the blade was split, branching into two points, shaped like a fork. Qin Sang had previously experienced its power, which was on par with the Cold Gold Sword.</p><p>As the blue mirror was about to collide with the flying sword,</p><p>instead of dodging, the blue mirror accelerated, its blue light blazing, seemingly crashing directly into the sword.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The blue mirror shattered.</p><p>The flying sword flew back, tumbling in the air, one of its prongs clearly broken, and a shocking crack marring its surface.</p><p>At the moment of impact, Qin Sang unleashed the remaining power of the talisman, aiming to use its last vestiges of energy to destroy the young man’s flying sword.</p><p>One acting hastily, the other meticulously prepared—it didn't disappoint Qin Sang.</p><p>The young man's face turned pale.</p><p>His consciousness was linked to the sword, and he suffered damage as well.</p><p>The flying sword was clearly unusable, and to make matters worse, the Cold Gold Sword was swiftly approaching.</p><p>Qin Sang clearly wasn't content with just destroying his sword and had a follow-up prepared.</p><p>Fortunately, the young man wasn't completely foolish. Ignoring the fallen sword, he quickly produced a treasure mirror similar in shape to the blue mirror and flung it out.</p><p>However, the instant the mirror left his hand, a white light suddenly locked onto it.</p><p>Under the magnetic influence of the Yin-Yang compass, the mirror was briefly stalled. That brief moment of hesitation was enough to prevent the mirror from blocking the Cold Gold Sword in time.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The sharp sword energy pierced the young man's eyes, bringing the chilling breath of death.</p><p>The young man cried out in terror, his robes suddenly tearing, releasing a puff of white energy. At the critical moment, the energy shifted the young man a foot to the side, narrowly avoiding the Cold Gold Sword's fatal blow.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>The Cold Gold Sword grazed the young man's arm, leaving a deep wound.</p><p>The young man screamed, retreating, clutching his wound, and glaring at Qin Sang with intense resentment, his face still showing the lingering effects of terror.</p><p>Another top-grade artifact.  You should change your name to 'Daoist of Many Treasures'.</p><p>Qin Sang sighed inwardly.</p><p>Failing to kill him with that strike didn’t deter Qin Sang; her demeanor remained calm as she controlled the ebony sword, circling back, slowly constricting the young man's space to maneuver.</p><p>As the saying goes, one mistake leads to another.</p><p>Having been outmaneuvered by Qin Sang, the young man could only dodge clumsily, finding it increasingly difficult.  Dodging a strike, the young man quickly moved, briefly turning his back to Qin Sang, making eye contact with Yu Shan Ting.</p><p>In that instant, their gazes met.</p><p>A young man, his eyes flashing, lowered his head slightly, a glint of ferocity in his gaze.  Seizing the moment before his opponent's sword returned, he raised his newly drawn blade, a sharp gleam emanating from its edge, and slashed at Qin Sang with all his might.</p><p>Simultaneously, with a flick of his wrist, a small grey orb appeared in his other hand.</p><p>Qin Sang, noticing the young man's strange actions, grew wary. His gaze swept over the scene, quickly settling on the grey orb.</p><p>The orb, the size of a dragon's eye, was perfectly round and flawlessly smooth, a greyish-white color with occasional flashes of silver light, like tiny bolts of lightning. It rested quietly in the young man's palm, appearing unremarkable, lacking the overt power of other magical artifacts.  It was unassuming.</p><p>But the instant Qin Sang saw it, his expression changed drastically.  The insignificant-looking orb filled him with a terrifying sensation, a feeling he'd experienced only a handful of times in his life, each time teetering on the brink of death.</p><p>If the young man unleashed this orb, he would die!</p><p>The thought, unbidden and unshakeable, flooded Qin Sang's mind.  Every hair on his body stood on end.</p><p>His pupils constricted, Qin Sang stared intently at the orb, his mind racing. What was it? He'd never heard of anything like it.</p><p>The young man’s fingers pulsed with energy, focusing it on the orb.  His eyes were wild, his face contorted in a terrifying sneer.</p><p>"I can't let him launch it!"</p><p>Qin Sang roared silently in his heart.  Ignoring everything else, he made his decision instantly,  unhesitatingly activating his ebony sword.</p><p>While it might sound complex, it all happened in a heartbeat. Qin Sang never lacked decisiveness.</p><p>Just then, he heard Jing Po-po's voice.</p><p>"Careful! It's a Void Sky Thunder!"</p><p>Void Sky Thunder!</p><p>So that's it!</p><p>Understanding dawned on Qin Sang.  Of course! A Void Sky Thunder from the Xu Ling Sect!</p><p>Qin Sang had first heard of the Void Sky Thunder from Shopkeeper Wu, and had heard rumors over the years, but had never seen one, hence his lack of recognition.</p><p>A Void Sky Thunder is a one-time-use magical artifact similar to a Profound Yin Thunder, but infinitely more powerful.  It's said to be capable of severely injuring even Golden Core cultivators—a terrifying weapon indeed.</p><p>The Void Sky Thunder is a treasure of the Xu Ling Sect.</p><p>Legend has it that even the Xu Ling Sect hasn't produced a true Void Sky Thunder in a very long time.</p><p>Some say the method of crafting them is lost; others say it's simply too difficult, and no one in the sect can do it anymore.</p><p>In short, the Xiaohan region hadn’t seen a Void Sky Thunder in ages, and even Xu Ling Sect disciples rarely spoke of them.</p><p>Who would have thought that this young man from the Yuan Shen Sect possessed one?</p>
