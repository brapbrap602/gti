<h1>Chapter 155 Instantaneous Travel</h1><p>The commotion behind them grew louder and louder, the battle intensifying. It seemed Ning Wu Hui could indeed hold his own against Ye Xiao, especially given the latter's injuries. Qin Sang felt less worried.</p><p>At that moment, he noticed a subtle shift within the Stone Forest.  An eerie, chilling aura deepened, amplified by the mournful whistling of the wind.  A rustling sound drifted from the distance, unlike the wind.</p><p>"Wild beasts are stirring…"</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes narrowed.  He didn't dare linger. Quickly traversing the Stone Forest, he flew towards the secluded valley.</p><p>Even so, Qin Sang encountered two groups of beasts. Fortunately, they weren't apex predators.  He swiftly dispatched them with his sword wheel.  After a series of twists and turns, he finally escaped the Stone Forest.</p><p>"I wonder how Ning Wu Hui is doing."</p><p>Qin Sang arrived at the agreed-upon location, but Ning Wu Hui was nowhere to be seen.</p><p>Thanks to his Divine Sight, Qin Sang had evaded danger, sustaining no injuries and only expending some True Essence, which he could recover with a short meditation.</p><p>Unable to do anything else, he waited patiently.</p><p>Opposite the Stone Forest stretched a boundless, barren desert, equally lifeless and desolate.</p><p>He flew to the crown of a stone tree, gazing into the distance. He could vaguely make out a range of mountains to the left, bathed in radiant light.</p><p>Amidst the glow, numerous spatial rifts intertwined, crisscrossing like a shattered void. The sight was terrifying.</p><p>Compared to these spatial rifts, the flickering light of the ancient restrictions seemed dim.</p><p>No wonder human cultivators hadn't uncovered the true secrets of the Seven Kills Sect. In such a place, even Nascent Soul cultivators would likely struggle, and the dangers within were surely greater.</p><p>Fortunately, the space deeper within the desert seemed more stable, with fewer spatial rifts.</p><p>As Qin Sang surveyed the terrain, he suddenly sensed a rapidly approaching energy fluctuation. He focused his gaze and saw Ning Wu Hui, his face lighting up with relief.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Ning, are you alright?"</p><p>Qin Sang flew down to the ground, examining Ning Wu Hui. He, too, seemed only to have depleted his True Essence, showing no external injuries.</p><p>"I'm fine. That Ye Xiao was injured, his strength diminished. The Stone Forest terrain was also advantageous for escape…"</p><p>Ning Wu Hui appeared relaxed. He sat cross-legged, holding spirit stones to replenish his True Essence.</p><p>"Is your current strength comparable to a Nascent Soul Grand Master?"</p><p>Qin Sang hesitated, then couldn't help but ask.</p><p>Ning Wu Hui shook his head. "There's no need to hide it now. My External Nascent Soul is certainly inferior to a true Nascent Soul. It lacks corresponding divine abilities, making me vulnerable if targeted by a powerful enemy.  Moreover, apart from merging with its nascent spirit, I cannot directly benefit from the External Nascent Soul. My Golden Core cannot transform; all power comes from the External Nascent Soul itself. My own cultivation is insufficient, making it difficult to control. Each activation requires the External Nascent Soul to leave my body…"</p><p>Listening to Ning Wu Hui's explanation, Qin Sang gradually understood.</p><p>The External Nascent Soul wasn't truly his own, more like an external force, similar in some ways to the Corpse Pill he had once formed.</p><p>It was said that true Nascent Souls possessed the ability of instantaneous travel, a vital life-saving divine ability. Judging by Ning Wu Hui's tone, his External Nascent Soul lacked this.</p><p>However, possessing Nascent Soul-level combat power alone was enough to drive countless Golden Core cultivators to madness.</p><p>Sensing Qin Sang's interest, Ning Wu Hui smiled faintly.  "This secret technique was passed down to me by a senior.  Its successful refinement was a stroke of luck. It requires not only a mature Earth Blood Ginseng but also other stringent conditions.  Replication is virtually impossible in the current era…"</p><p>"Earth Blood Ginseng?"</p><p>Qin Sang pondered.</p><p>His knowledge of alchemy and spirit herbs was superficial. He racked his memory but had never heard of Earth Blood Ginseng.</p><p>The External Nascent Soul secret technique came from Senior Qing Zhu.</p><p>This didn't surprise Qin Sang.</p><p>Senior Qing Zhu had entrusted a heavy responsibility to Ning Wu Hui, suggesting a close relationship. It was no surprise that someone of Senior Qing Zhu's cultivation level possessed such a powerful secret technique.</p><p>It seemed Senior Qing Zhu had grand plans, requiring Ning Wu Hui to possess sufficient cultivation.</p><p>Forming a Nascent Soul couldn't be rushed.</p><p>The External Nascent Soul allowed Ning Wu Hui's strength to surge instantly.</p><p>"Earth Blood Ginseng is extinct in the current era.  I followed a clue within the Heavenly Dao Sect, confirming the existence of one within the Trial Realm.  This spirit herb resembles an infant. Upon maturity, it can move freely, surpassing even Nascent Soul cultivators in its escape techniques, appearing and disappearing unpredictably. It also possesses powerful protective spiritual energy. Even within the Trial Realm, I made thorough preparations and used all my means to barely capture it, nearly suffering severe injuries in the process."</p><p>Ning Wu Hui sighed. "Refining it into an External Nascent Soul was no easy feat. This secret technique was originally intended for Nascent Soul Grand Masters. I couldn't have done it alone. It required a spirit array, supplemented by various rare treasures…"</p><p>It's good to have powerful backing!  Qin Sang couldn't help but feel envious. Senior Qing Zhu had clearly arranged the necessary conditions for Ning Wu Hui in advance.</p><p>He lacked a trustworthy guide, forced to forge his own path.</p><p>"I cannot divulge this secret technique without permission, please understand."</p><p>Ning Wu Hui said.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, expressing his understanding.</p><p>If he truly desired it, he could only wait to meet Senior Qing Zhu and find a way to exchange for it.</p><p>However, after hearing Ning Wu Hui's description, Qin Sang's interest waned.  The conditions were so demanding, it was impossible to achieve at the Golden Core stage.</p><p>Even after reaching the Nascent Soul realm, expending so much effort and preparation, capturing an Earth Blood Ginseng would remain extremely difficult.</p><p>It seemed more practical to focus on helping Bai advance to Corpse King. That would also provide Nascent Soul-level assistance, with a higher chance of success.  At least until the Heavenly Corpse Talisman was removed, Bai would remain with him.</p><p>Ning Wu Hui sat with his eyes closed, meditating, while Qin Sang stood guard.</p><p>Once his True Essence had recovered to ninety percent, Ning Wu Hui rose and looked towards the depths of the desert. "I didn't expect so many setbacks. We need to increase our pace."</p><p>They set off again.</p><p>The desert terrain undulated, but not with towering peaks.  There were only low hills.  Without any cover, they had to be extra cautious.</p><p>The further they traveled, the colder it became.</p><p>Soon, they noticed a faint grey mist floating in the air ahead.  The mist wasn't dense and didn't obstruct their vision much. The terrain remained a vast desert, much like the area outside.</p><p>They stopped, gazing ahead.</p><p>The grey mist stretched endlessly, forming a sea of fog. It seemed far more extensive than the Purple Mist Forbidden Zone.</p><p>"Ahead lies the Secluded Valley," Ning Wu Hui said gravely.</p><p>"I didn't expect it to be so vast!" Qin Sang exclaimed. It hardly resembled a valley.</p><p>"The 'valley' in Secluded Valley isn't relative to mountains, but to the void itself."</p><p>Ning Wu Hui pointed towards the horizon on their left. "Look there, it's practically a dead end. On the other side of the Secluded Valley, you'll find a similar sight, like two sheer cliffs enclosing the valley within."</p>
