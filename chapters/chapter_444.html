<h1>Chapter 437: Sky Peak</h1><p>The white-robed man glanced back. "It's a pity I'm injured, and Fellow Daoist Wu was poisoned first. Otherwise, the three of us together could have taken him down. To comprehend Sword Qi Resonance at the Foundation Establishment stage... he'll surely become a serious threat in the future. He's been hiding his face.  I wonder if he'll follow us?"</p><p>The Luo cultivator snorted coldly, slightly altering the course of the awning boat. "Senior Brother Liu and the others are not far ahead. If he dares to follow, he'll pay with his life!"</p><p>…</p><p>Seeing the awning boat retreat, Qin Sang paused briefly before continuing to withdraw.</p><p>The distance between them grew, until the awning boat finally disappeared from Qin Sang’s sight.</p><p>Qin Sang chose not to pursue.</p><p>There weren’t many on the boat, and one of the two late-stage Foundation Establishment cultivators was injured. If he could find the right opportunity, he could eliminate them all.</p><p>But this wasn't the place for a protracted fight. If he couldn't defeat them quickly and encountered another Heavenly Cycle Alliance patrol, he'd be in trouble.</p><p>If they hadn't been deterred by that sword strike and continued to pursue relentlessly, he might have tried.</p><p>Since they chose to retreat, Qin Sang decided to be content with what he had achieved.</p><p>After observing for a while and confirming that the Heavenly Cycle Alliance had indeed withdrawn, Qin Sang surfaced, summoned his Netherworld Cloud, and flew towards Mu Yifeng.</p><p>Soon, he saw Mu Yifeng’s flickering escape light.</p><p>“Senior Brother Mu!”</p><p>Qin Sang supported the exhausted Mu Yifeng and tossed him a bottle of spirit pills. "They’ve fled.  Come aboard, take these pills, and meditate. I’ll keep watch for you."</p><p>“Thank you, Junior Brother Qin, for saving my life!”</p><p>Mu Yifeng turned and saw that the awning boat was indeed gone.</p><p>Having narrowly escaped death, he felt a surge of relief, followed by near-total exhaustion. His meridians and spiritual sea were ravaged; he had only persevered through sheer willpower.</p><p>Knowing this wasn't the time for formalities, he boarded the Netherworld Cloud, took the pills, and entered meditative recovery.</p><p>Qin Sang, piloting the cloud, stayed low over the water, speeding towards the medicinal garden.</p><p>As they flew deeper into the territory controlled by the Xiaohan Domain, they didn't encounter any enemies.</p><p>Unsure of how the overall situation had developed, Qin Sang sensed danger and resolved to gather the spirit herbs, seal the restrictions, and flee this area as soon as he returned to the garden.</p><p>At the very least, he would wait until the situation stabilized before returning.</p><p>Qin Sang looked at Mu Yifeng curiously. Mu had never missed a trading meeting, always keen to observe the situation and gather information.</p><p>There had been no sign of a major conflict before; why the sudden eruption of hostilities?</p><p>As they neared the medicinal garden, Mu Yifeng finally awoke, though his injuries hadn’t fully healed.</p><p>“Junior Brother Qin!”</p><p>Mu Yifeng stood and bowed. “Words cannot express my gratitude!”</p><p>Qin Sang stopped him. “Senior Brother Mu, you are too kind! The medicinal garden I guard is just ahead. Your injuries are serious; why not continue to recuperate?”</p><p>Mu Yifeng suddenly understood. “So, Junior Brother is stationed here! After returning to the sect from the Hanging Skull Pass and breaking through to late-stage Foundation Establishment, I was assigned here with Senior Brother Kuang to patrol the surrounding waters.  If I’d known, I would have visited you long ago.”</p><p>“I’ve only been here for less than two years and have only attended a few trading meetings. I rarely venture out. I didn’t know you were in the vicinity.”</p><p>Qin Sang then recounted what he had witnessed at the trading meeting. "How did you and Senior Brother Kuang get entangled with those Heavenly Cycle Alliance scoundrels? Were you with Senior Fang…?"</p><p>Unlike Xiong Li’s evasiveness, Mu Yifeng answered frankly. "Indeed. Some time ago, we received orders to act with Senior Fang. They seemed to be searching for something called Sky Peak. Apparently, there were signs of its appearance, but I don't know the specifics.  I’m not sure when our movements were compromised, but the Heavenly Cycle Alliance secretly gathered forces and ambushed us while we were returning, taking advantage of our relaxed state..."</p><p>Mu Yifeng spoke openly to Qin Sang.</p><p>However, Qin Sang was still confused.  He had heard the name Sky Peak for the first time. It sounded like a mountain, but he didn't know its significance or why it would cause a clash between Core Formation cultivators.</p><p>Since the appearance of the spiritual tide, both sides had only lost some Foundation Establishment cultivators; he had never heard of Core Formation cultivators being involved.</p><p>Qin Sang continued to inquire about the details, learning that besides Core Formation cultivators, there were over a dozen pseudo-Core Formation experts with Mu Yifeng.  If not for the Heavenly Cycle Alliance's treacherous ambush, they wouldn’t have been so hard-pressed.</p><p>To mobilize so many experts, Sky Peak must be something extraordinary!</p><p>This further strengthened Qin Sang's resolve to leave.</p><p>After Qin Sang described the direction they had been flying, Mu Yifeng said, “Junior Brother Qin, I have orders to return to Stargazing Island to report the enemy's movements.”</p><p>Qin Sang had heard of Stargazing Island at the trading meetings.</p><p>It was the island where the Core Formation cultivators of the various sects were stationed, and it controlled the situation in the Cloudmist Great Marsh, opposing the Heavenly Cycle Alliance.  All military orders came from this island.</p><p>Despite many rumors, the location of Stargazing Island was highly secretive, known only to the patrol guards. From Mu Yifeng, Qin Sang finally learned its exact location.</p><p>It was northeast of the medicinal garden, surprisingly close.</p><p>Mu Yifeng couldn't fly alone due to his injuries, but Qin Sang didn't intend to go to Stargazing Island now.</p><p>Once chaos erupted, it would inevitably become the center of the conflict.</p><p>Going there at this time was too risky; he still wanted a few years of peaceful cultivation.</p><p>“After returning to the medicinal garden, Junior Brother Xie and I will harvest the spirit herbs and leave. Why don't you continue with me, Senior Brother Mu? By the time we're near Stargazing Island, your injuries should have stabilized, and then you can go.”</p><p>Mu Yifeng readily agreed.</p><p>While meditating and healing, Mu Yifeng asked about Qin Sang’s experiences over the years.</p><p>Qin Sang omitted anything too personal. After some casual conversation, they exchanged cultivation insights.</p><p>With the medicinal garden in sight, Qin Sang thought of Yu Yangzi and the others. They had been on good terms back then, and Yu Yangzi had helped him establish himself in Hanging Skull Pass.  However, they had both focused on cultivation afterward, and they had lost contact after parting ways.</p><p>He asked, “Senior Brother Mu, how are Senior Brother Yu Yangzi and the others who stayed at Hanging Skull Pass doing now?”</p><p>Unexpectedly, Mu Yifeng's expression darkened. He sighed deeply. “Senior Brother Yu Yangzi continued serving as a Hanging Skull Guard. Twenty years ago, he was ordered to lead a team out of the pass to clear out cloud beasts… Junior Brother, you know the current state of the Ancient Immortal Battlefield. After leaving the pass, Senior Brother Yu Yangzi's team was unfortunately surrounded and attacked by a horde of cloud beasts... None of them returned…”</p><p>Qin Sang was stunned.</p><p>The next news he heard of Yu Yangzi was of his death.</p><p>Silence fell upon the Netherworld Cloud. Both Qin Sang and Mu Yifeng lost their desire to talk, remaining speechless.</p><p>A long time passed before a sigh finally broke the silence.</p>
