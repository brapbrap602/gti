"Choose a magical artifact."
After entering the Paifang, this thought inexplicably emerged in Qin Sang's mind.
His heart tightened, and he roughly understood the reason.
"This is the restriction that Liuli and Shi Xue mentioned."
During the Trial of the Body Cleansing Pool, he must select one from all his magical artifacts and can only use that one throughout the entire process.
The restrictions of the Body Cleansing Pool are unpredictable and countless, possibly appearing on various levels, making targeted preparation impossible.
The majority of a cultivator's strength lies in their magical artifacts and divine abilities, especially their Natal Artifact, which is extremely important.
Other cultivators will undoubtedly choose their Natal Artifact, but everyone has weaknesses. Powerful divine abilities are hard to find, and even if found, they may not be suitable for one's own cultivation. Nascent Soul cultivators habitually choose to purchase or refine corresponding magical artifacts to compensate.
For ordinary cultivators, encountering this kind of restriction results in a loss of twenty percent of their strength, which is normal.
It cannot be called anything but harsh.
Qin Sang's eyes flickered as he pondered the so-called 'magical artifact' restriction, wondering if it would include Natal Spirit Insects and an Avatar.
"If that's the case, it should be restricting all 'external forces'," Qin Sang mused to himself.
He could only choose between the Gold Submerging Sword and the Demon Banner.
Sealing the Gold Submerging Sword meant that he could not use the Seven Souls Killing Array. Sealing the Demon Banner would limit him to using only the Demonic Flame refined in the Fire Lotus, drastically reducing its power.
After weighing his options, Qin Sang chose the Demon Banner.
He summoned all the Demon Banners, silently declaring his choice of this treasure and specifying that it was all the Demon Banners, to avoid the restriction misunderstanding and only allowing him to use one.
The flagpoles of the Demon Banners came from the same ancient treasure, and they sealed the same spiritual fire, so they could be considered as one.
Unexpectedly, after waiting for a while, there was no reaction from the surroundings.
Qin Sang frowned. With a slight thought, he summoned the Gold Submerging Sword from the Thousand Jun Ring.
As soon as the sword appeared, the mist suddenly thickened, and a strange wave was born out of thin air, frantically converging towards Qin Sang. Before he could react, the surface of the Gold Submerging Sword was covered with a layer of runes, which disappeared in a flash.
At that moment, Qin Sang felt the Gold Submerging Sword weigh a thousand jun, sealed by some power.
His connection with the Gold Submerging Sword remained, not severed, but the Gold Submerging Sword obviously could no longer be used, or he wouldn't know how he died.
Qin Sang put away the Gold Submerging Sword and summoned his Avatar.
As expected, the Avatar moved as usual, not restricted.
Qin Sang was relieved. He urged the Demonic Flame to surround him and surveyed the surroundings.
All he could see was white mist.
The Celestial Eye Butterfly was not restricted, but the Celestial Eye Divine Power was also affected by the mist, narrowing his field of vision.
Qin Sang found that beneath his feet was a white jade corridor, suspended in the air, only two steps wide, with unfathomable depths below, extremely dangerous.
The corridor led straight to the deepest part.
Qin Sang had a premonition that falling off the corridor would cause something he didn't want to see to happen.
He was the only one on the entire corridor, empty of everything, with no sign of the Yue surname cultivator, but it gave people a feeling of oppression.
'Whoosh!'
With the Demonic Flame around him, Qin Sang stepped forward.
His footsteps landed silently on the corridor. Without support below, the corridor was extremely stable and did not shake.
As Qin Sang advanced, on another corridor, the Yue surname cultivator was walking slowly and cautiously, his face full of vigilance.
He had to be wary not only of the front but also of the rear.
Seeing that no one appeared behind him for a long time, the Yue surname cultivator relaxed and focused on dealing with the trials ahead.
Unlike Qin Sang, the Yue surname cultivator was not only accompanied by the Serpent Banner but also had a screen-like magical artifact engraved with landscape paintings floating above his head.
At the center of his brow, a faint white light flickered, forming the pattern of a stone tablet.
This was a secret talisman bestowed by the Profound Heaven Palace, which could weaken the suppression in this place. This was the advantage of newcomers like the Yue surname cultivator over Qin Sang and Shang Lu.
Qin Sang was unable to detect the situation of others at this time.
He advanced along the corridor, never encountering an opponent, and gradually increased his speed.
Suddenly, a gust of sinister wind attacked.
The sinister wind was unannounced, but Qin Sang remained vigilant and reacted quickly, immediately urging the Demonic Flame to construct a wall of fire in front of him.
'Whoosh!'
The wall of fire successfully blocked the sinister wind.
At the moment the sinister wind was dispersed, a phantom-like wraith touched the Demonic Flame, let out a scream, and fled in panic into the white mist, disappearing.
Qin Sang looked at the direction the wraith escaped and did not choose to pursue it.
The exchange just now was very brief, and he didn't gain much information. Qin Sang's focus was on the wraith itself. Although it could scream, it didn't seem alive.
He thought for a moment and continued forward.
The wraiths harassed him frequently. Qin Sang seized the opportunity to trap one with the Demonic Flame. The wraith immediately turned into a cloud of mist. It was indeed something derived from the ancient restriction.
After that, he stopped thinking about it and used the Demonic Flame to kill all the wraiths blocking his way.
The farther he went, the stronger the wraiths became, but the Demonic Flame was powerful enough to cope with them, without needing to use other divine abilities. The Avatar didn't need to take action either, closely following behind Qin Sang, prepared with a defensive divine ability, ready to rescue him at any time.
The Wishful Pearl (Ruyi Treasure) was restricted, so Qin Sang used the Avatar's hand to add a layer of protection for himself.
Countless wraiths died in the Demonic Flame.
Qin Sang finally saw a different scene.
The corridor ended ahead, revealing a circular, wide platform. In the center of the platform stood a stone statue.
All the wraiths disappeared.
Qin Sang stepped onto the platform. The moment his gaze met the stone statue, the statue came to life. Its carved eyes turned slightly, fixing on Qin Sang, its gaze full of fighting intent!
"Challenge this stone statue to pass."
Qin Sang glanced at the void on the other side of the platform, understanding what he needed to do. Without hesitation, he immediately attacked.
The Demonic Flame transformed into a flame dragon, about to rush towards the stone statue.
Just then, Qin Sang's pupils contracted slightly.
He saw ripples in the void around the stone statue, followed by a magical artifact appearing out of thin air, a Serpent Banner!
That wasn't all.
A faint light flickered above the stone statue's head, and a landscape screen floated into view.
Qin Sang had seen the Yue surname cultivator use these two magical artifacts outside the Body Cleansing Pool.
The stone statue was imitating the intruders!
'Swoosh!'
The fighting intent in the stone statue's eyes soared. It took a step back, and at the same time, the landscape screen drew in the void, projecting the landscapes from the ink painting into reality. The stone statue vanished into the landscape.
The painting enveloped the platform, rapidly spreading towards Qin Sang, wanting to pull Qin Sang into the painting and turn him into a speck of ink within it.
The Serpent Banner moved with it, flanking him.
Qin Sang's expression was calm. He immediately split off half of the Demonic Flame to form a flame barrier, targeting the landscape screen. At the same time, his figure flashed, and he rolled up the other half of the Demonic Flame, proactively pouncing towards the Serpent Banner.
The snow serpent on the flag surface roared. Familiar jade-white profound light appeared before Qin Sang!
He had cooperated with Liuli to break the Serpent Banner and was clear about the rules of this treasure.
If there were three snow serpents, that would be one thing, but one snow serpent was not enough to see.
Qin Sang showed no sign of dodging. He pointed his fingers repeatedly, and the Demonic Flame split into more than a dozen black arrows, deeply penetrating the jade-white profound light.
'Boom!'
The profound light collapsed on the spot, exposing the Serpent Banner's main body.
The Demonic Flame immediately surrounded the Serpent Banner. The snow serpent was forced out and burned to ashes amid its roars, appearing lifelike throughout, just like the real thing.
After the snow serpent died, the Serpent Banner disintegrated on its own.
Qin Sang felt relieved. The stone statue's magical artifacts could be destroyed and wouldn't reappear, making it much easier to deal with.
Qin Sang glanced at the ink landscape that was about to cover the entire platform. He first condensed the Demonic Flame, proactively letting the ink landscape engulf them, and began to counterattack.
Qin Sang's figure disappeared, becoming a speck of ink in the painting.
The good times didn't last long. In the elegant ink painting, raging flames suddenly ignited, spreading like wildfire. The flames instantly engulfed half of the landscape.
The stone statue showed no emotion, but it wasn't lacking in combat experience. It hurriedly gathered the power of its magical artifact, but it was too late.
The Demonic Flame resolutely broke through the painting and pounced towards the stone statue's main body.
Before the stone statue could react, a blast of cold air rushed out from the gap the Demonic Flame opened, freezing it into a lump of ice.
Qin Sang and his Avatar walked out side by side, and Qin Sang pointed at the stone statue. The flame dragon crashed into it head-on.
'Crack!'
The stone statue shattered, and Qin Sang won.
The strange phenomena on the platform instantly subsided, and a new corridor appeared in front of him.
Qin Sang was not in a hurry to advance. He recalled the battle just now.
"The stone statue used two magical artifacts, it seems that the Yue surname cultivator was not restricted.
"It's impossible for the Yue surname cultivator not to cultivate Daoist arts, but the stone statue only used these two magical artifacts over and over again. It's likely that it can't imitate it if the Yue surname cultivator didn't use it.
"I wonder if the encounters of others are the same. The stone statue imitates the intruders' divine abilities, becoming obstacles for others. They should be able to recognize my identity when they see the Demon Banner. I've already entered the Body Cleansing Pool, so exposure doesn't matter much.
"However, if I had chosen the Sun God Tree, wouldn't this contest have ended right now?"
In fact, Qin Sang was overthinking things.
The Body Cleansing Pool does not simply test strength. To prevent someone from sweeping the entire field with one magical artifact, there is another kind of restriction. The Nine Nether Demonic Flame has already exceeded the limit.
On another platform.
The Yue surname cultivator watched the sky full of spiritual fire dissipate rapidly along with the stone statue, his face full of solemnity.
"This... such a strong spiritual fire, could it be him?"
He had been cultivating quietly in Tianshan and hadn't heard any rumors about Qin Sang, but he could also infer that his fellow disciples didn't have this kind of magical artifact.
The Yue surname cultivator's face changed uncertainly, and a sense of crisis arose in his heart. His pace unconsciously quickened.
He was lucky because he encountered a stone statue imitating Qin Sang on the first stone platform. The Avatar hadn't even made a move before this.
Others would have to face both Qin Sang and his Avatar at the same time!
……
As time passed.
Qin Sang encountered two more stone statues, each displaying completely different magical artifacts and divine abilities than before, clearly imitating other competitors.
The stronger he showed, the more the stone statue imitating him might be able to clear obstacles and eliminate all competitors. But Qin Sang vaguely felt that things weren't that simple.
Would the stone statue imitating him only deal with others?
In the end, wouldn't it become his own obstacle, cultivating an opponent for himself?
Out of this consideration, throughout the process, Qin Sang only used Demonic Flame and his Avatar to solve the stone statues, without using other methods.
After defeating the third stone statue.
Qin Sang continued forward.
Before long, another platform appeared ahead of the corridor.
But unlike before, the stone statue on the platform did not move.
The new change attracted Qin Sang's attention, "Is it the final trial? Only three competitors entered, or are there only three stages? Could it be that Shang Lu really didn't come in?"
He pondered these questions, walking a circle along the edge of the platform. Sensing something, he looked back and saw that all the corridors had disappeared.
The surroundings were silent, without any prompts.
Qin Sang carefully examined the platform again and tried to attack the stone statue, but he was blocked by the restriction. He had no choice but to wait patiently.
Fortunately, the stone statue didn't make him wait too long.
'Crack!'
The stone statue suddenly moved and slowly opened its eyes.
Immediately afterward, an astonishing scene appeared. Demon Banners condensed out of thin air in front of the stone statue, exactly the same as the Demon Banners beside Qin Sang.
'Whoosh!'
The Demon Banners fluttered, and a black spiritual fire surged out, its appearance and aura actually eight or nine points similar to the Demonic Flame!
Qin Sang's heart sank slightly, just as he had expected.
He just didn't know if the stone statue's spiritual fire was just for show?
Unexpectedly, the stone statue's changes had not ended.
Qin Sang was dumbfounded, watching the stone statue grow a Serpent Banner beside it, a bronze cauldron floating above its head, while simultaneously forming hand seals and covering itself in a layer of seven-colored armor…
There was even an Avatar behind it!
The strongest magical artifacts and divine abilities that Qin Sang had used, plus those of the previous three stone statues, were displayed on it one by one.
Those who qualified to participate in the Body Cleansing Pool competition were all geniuses of the Profound Heaven Palace, the best among their peers. They had all learned the secret transmissions of the Profound Heaven Palace, and there were no weaklings among them.
With so many magical artifacts and divine abilities gathered on one body, plus the powerful spiritual fire and Avatar, it was almost impossible to find a weakness.
Qin Sang encountered this kind of opponent for the first time.
For a moment, he didn't know where to start.
The stone statue would not give Qin Sang time to think. Its entire body was radiant, and the brilliance of its magical artifacts and Daoist techniques flashed alternately, dazzling the eyes.
'Clang!'
The bronze cauldron inverted, its mouth aimed at Qin Sang.
The stone statue waved its arm forcefully, and the ice fan shot out beams of cold air, transforming into an extremely cold hurricane, wrapped in ice shards sharper than swords, instantly sweeping across half of the platform.
At the same time, the stone statue's Avatar and the Serpent Banner attacked from the left and right flanks.
Qin Sang was attacked from three sides, his situation precarious.
He remained calm in the face of danger. He still used his old trick, ordering his Avatar to block the stone statue's Avatar.
At the same time, he used the Heart Knot Turning Altar Seal to break free from the binding force of the bronze cauldron, stepped on the Lotus Flower Seal, and, like a ghost, bypassed the extremely cold hurricane, first pouncing towards the Serpent Banner.
'Whoosh!'
Just as he was about to approach the Serpent Banner, the stone statue's spiritual fire arrived as expected.
Qin Sang had expected this. Not daring to underestimate it, his figure paused slightly, and he immediately activated the Demonic Flame to its full potential to block it.
'Boom!'
Streams of flame flew everywhere.
Qin Sang's expression shifted slightly. The stone statue's spiritual fire was slightly weaker than his own, but it was undoubtedly a top-level divine power.
The stone statue was extremely difficult to deal with.
It was almost impossible to find a weakness on it. It had perfectly combined everyone's divine abilities and magical artifacts.
If he wanted to kill the stone statue by force, it would be impossible to do so within the time limit of the Body Cleansing Pool.
Qin Sang pondered secretly.
Thinking about the time he had just waited, he must have been waiting for the others to arrive. As expected, the opponents should be the same.
It seemed that the requirement of the final stage was not to defeat the stone statue, but to compete in who could last longer!
But delaying too long would mean missing the Body Cleansing Pool.
If that was the case, he might as well change his thinking, such as helping the stone statue a little more, so that the opponents would be defeated as soon as possible.
A flash of inspiration crossed Qin Sang's mind, and he immediately made a decision.
