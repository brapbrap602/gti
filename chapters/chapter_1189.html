<h1>Chapter 1181: Unmasking the Truth</h1><p>“Daoist Mingyue, do not underestimate the enemy.  The reason why the Zuiyuan forces are pressing us so hard is partly due to these幽晶塔 (towers). These objects can move freely, yet possess power comparable to powerful spirit arrays, with many other uses. This allows the Zuiyuan army to maneuver flexibly. Our carefully laid-out defensive arrays, normally requiring a far larger force to overcome, or the discovery of a weakness in the array, are easily breached thanks to their towers…”</p><p>Jinglin cautioned.</p><p>Qin Sang reviewed the relevant information on the towers.</p><p>During the time in the Demon Sea, he had experienced the demon tribe's siege of the Great Waste Island. Although he managed to escape quickly, he had witnessed some human methods but found nothing comparable to these towers.</p><p>These objects were undoubtedly devastating weapons on the battlefield. No wonder the Zuiyuan forces held the upper hand. Even if the Two Regions Alliance possessed similar treasures, they were far inferior.</p><p>“Was it after the last battle that Zuiyuan suddenly deployed these towers? They weren't used before, were they?”</p><p>Qin Sang inquired carefully.</p><p>The towers were devoid of demonic energy, he wondered if they had any connection to the ancient demons.</p><p>Zuiyuan also possessed the Zui Shen Palace, a secret realm rumored to contain many treasures. It was possible that they had unearthed these towers from within.</p><p>Jinglin paused, then recalled,  “Ah! Daoist Mingyue only recently achieved transformation; you probably weren't paying attention to the conflict between the three regions back then.  In fact, before the Ziwei Palace was attacked, Zuiyuan had been restless, repeatedly encroaching on our borders. We clashed with them several times.  They used something similar to these towers then, but neither the power nor the number could compare to what they have now.  In the years since, they may have improved their technology or discovered more materials…”</p><p>“Haven't you considered replicating these treasures?”</p><p>Qin Sang asked.</p><p>Jinglin chuckled wryly, “Of course!  True Daoist and the Red-Haired Ancestor of Xiao Han Region set a trap, luring a Zuiyuan Yuan Ying cultivator into it and capturing them alive. Only after interrogation did we learn that the method of forging these towers is top secret within Zuiyuan, known to few besides Elder Ye. We've captured some towers, but even now we haven't figured out what material they're made of, let alone replicating them.”</p><p>Their exchange of thoughts through divine sense was swift.</p><p>As they spoke, the Zuiyuan army pressed closer.</p><p>“Found him! That's Elder Tan!”</p><p>Jinglin quickly lowered his head, indicating the location to Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang had already noticed the cultivator at the forefront of the Zuiyuan formation. The man flew towards them, a red fiery rope wrapped around his left arm. The surrounding cultivators showed him great reverence.</p><p>“Elder Pei is hiding, but he must be near the towers to control them.”</p><p>Jinglin searched covertly, but couldn't find Elder Pei.</p><p>Qin Sang also searched.</p><p>Meanwhile, behind the towers, two figures hid in the shadows. A faint ripple, like a transparent veil, surrounded them.</p><p>Other cultivators passed by without noticing them; the veil merely trembled slightly.</p><p>“With Daoist Chanling's support, we will surely take Sandie Pass!”</p><p>One of the figures gazed confidently at the mist-filled sea ahead. This person was Elder Pei, the one Jinglin was seeking.</p><p>Beside him stood a lean Daoist.</p><p>The Daoist stood with hands behind his back; the green veil was his treasure, perfectly concealing their presence.</p><p>After staring at the mist for a moment, Elder Pei sneered, “It's indeed that fellow, Si, coming out to fight. I know his abilities intimately. Except for his treasure, the Yuejin Mirror, the rest are nothing to worry about.  This time, Daoist Tan has devised a countermeasure. Once we lure him in and seize the opportunity, we can at least severely injure him and capture Sandie Pass before reinforcements arrive…”</p><p>The Zuiyuan Yuan Ying cultivator was thinking along similar lines to Qin Sang and Jinglin.</p><p>“Sandie Pass isn't that important, it depends on Elder Ye's progress… you two just need to succeed.”</p><p>Daoist Chanling nodded slightly.  “Three towers are here; they surely know Daoist Pei is present. You might as well use the towers to directly attack, dispelling Si Di and Jinglin’s suspicions. I will hide within this ‘No-Light Veil’, approaching undetected.”</p><p>Old Man Tan was worried.  "They'll surely hide within the Cold Bell Formation and won't come out. If the Daoist enters directly, won't they be discovered by those controlling the formation...?"</p><p>Daoist Chan Ling smiled slightly. "My Invisible Veil is as soft as water, adept at going with the flow and taking advantage of the situation. Even if I infiltrate the formation, it won't be easy to expose me. Unless someone there has a stronger spiritual sense than mine, they absolutely won't be able to detect my presence. However, I need to fully control the Invisible Veil to achieve this effect, and there will be a brief moment of delay when I act—this is the veil's drawback. That time is enough for the opponent to react, so I need your and Daoist Tan's close cooperation."</p><p>Hearing this, Old Man Tan's eyes lit up. "Daoist, you're at the mid-Yuan Ying stage. In the Two Realms Alliance, those with a stronger spiritual sense than yours are few and far between, and they certainly wouldn't be at Sandie Pass!"</p><p>The two exchanged a few whispered words.</p><p>A flash of light emanated from Old Man Tan, and he vanished.</p><p>Daoist Chan Ling, like a ghost, drifted slowly forward with his Invisible Veil.</p><p>After traveling some distance, Daoist Chan Ling seemed to sense something.  He furrowed his brow, gazed intently into the depths of the mist, scanned the area, found nothing, shook his head slightly, and continued according to the plan.</p><p>Within the mist, Qin Sang's heart suddenly leaped.</p><p>Daoist Chan Ling's concealment method was extraordinary, but it couldn't hide from the Heavenly Eye Butterfly's eyes.</p><p>At a glance, there was an unexpected discovery!</p><p>Qin Sang searched the battle formation carefully.  Finding Old Man Tan, he also discovered this Daoist.  Startled, he realized the  Zuiyuan Sect had sent three Yuan Ying cultivators.</p><p>When he tried to use the Heavenly Eye Butterfly again to get a clearer look at this person, he nearly got detected.  The other party's spiritual sense was likely far superior to his own!</p><p>Qin Sang had a bad feeling.</p><p>"Daoist Jinglin…"</p><p>Qin Sang's face was serious as he immediately reported the situation to Jinglin beside him.</p><p>"What? Three Yuan Ying cultivators?"</p><p>Jinglin exclaimed. After hearing Qin Sang's description, he immediately remembered someone.  "It's him! That person's dharma name is Chan Ling. He's a mid-Yuan Ying cultivator, with a rare concealment treasure. He's caused us significant losses before; we've never had a good way to deal with him.  He's always been around Wangdong City in the east.  His appearance here means Zuiyuan intends to break through from our Shiqu Mountain!"</p><p>"Mid-Yuan Ying?"</p><p>Qin Sang's expression changed.</p><p>He wasn't alarmed by the opponent's cultivation, only that Daoist Chan Ling was clearly targeting Si Di, just like them.</p><p>A direct confrontation wouldn't be advantageous; they would have to change their strategy.</p>
