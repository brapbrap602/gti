<h1>Chapter 1971: A Public Display of Power</h1><p>Vast expanse of sand.</p><p>Qin Sang overlooked the land, his gaze settling between two sand dunes.</p><p>The sand grains shifted, revealing an abyss below, relentlessly swallowing the sand, quickly forming a deep chasm.</p><p>The two dunes were swallowed by the chasm, the devouring continued, gradually forming a ravine thousands of feet long and bottomless.</p><p>Below the ravine, a fiery red light emanated, the earth torn apart, reaching down to the earth's fiery veins.</p><p>Suddenly, a golden thread shot from below.</p><p>While flying in the air, the Fire Jade Centipede travelled with him through the subterranean fiery veins, thoroughly exploring the distribution of the underground fiery veins.</p><p>Furthermore, the Fire Jade Centipede discovered some ancient traces here, a ruined secret realm, precisely what Qin Sang desired.</p><p>The Fire Jade Centipede coiled around the bronze pillar and plunged into the magma.</p><p>Qin Sang floated above the ravine, his fingertips emitting streams of light, shooting into the earth.</p><p>The magma surged, emitting rumbling sounds.</p><p>Within the boiling magma, a golden centipede could be vaguely seen churning.</p><p>The Fire Jade Centipede cooperated with Qin Sang's actions.</p><p>As time passed, countless runes floated around the Fire Jade Centipede.</p><p>These runes formed a restriction, originating from Qin Sang's discovery in the ruins years ago, but with significant modifications.</p><p>The bronze pillar, the core of the restriction, lay slanted within the magma.</p><p>The Fire Jade Centipede stretched its body, releasing the bronze pillar, revealing a slight tremor in the pillar; it was not fixed in one place but moved slowly with the magma.</p><p>This was a deliberate illusion created by Qin Sang.</p><p>After all, he had occupied the ruins for so long. When he built the training ground, he hadn't foreseen this day.  Completely restoring the Panlong Ancient Array without leaving any trace was impossible.</p><p>Even if he deceived the Nascent Soul cultivators from both sides, the two ancestors could easily spot flaws, potentially disrupting his plans.</p><p>So Qin Sang, disregarding the trouble, took extra steps, creating the illusion that the ruins had self-destructed, and the bronze pillar had detached and fallen into this secret realm.</p><p>In the future, when the two major forces discovered the ruins, they would follow certain clues and gradually find this bronze pillar.</p><p>Everything was meticulously planned, including this location, which was carefully chosen.</p><p>That would be the time when Qin Sang truly intervened in the game!</p><p>Having set everything up, Qin Sang raised his hand, the sand on either side flowed towards the center, and the earth's fissure gradually healed.</p><p>The Fire Jade Centipede retreated into Qin Sang's sleeve.</p><p>Qin Sang looked around, ensuring there were no flaws, and flew away.</p><p>He didn't return to the "training ground," but instead traveled south to Qingyang Temple, to meet with his clone.</p><p>He would not interfere in the conflict in the Fire Domain but would wait for the opportune moment at the temple.</p><p>In the underground chamber.</p><p>The clone awakened, descended from the altar, handed everything over to his main body, returned to the surface, and resumed his duties as the Abbot of Qingyang Temple.</p><p>The main body took his place on the altar.</p><p>All sixty-four branch altars were completed, and after years of contemplation by the clone, he had a profound understanding of the altar array.</p><p>However, to repair the main altar, the clone's abilities were insufficient; the main body had to intervene personally.</p><p>Qin Sang raised his hands, skillfully forming a hand seal.</p><p>As soon as the hand seal was formed, wind and thunder arose around Qin Sang.</p><p>"Crack!"</p><p>"Whoosh whoosh whoosh…"</p><p>A violent wind raged, electric snakes danced, and amidst the flashing lightning, balls of thunder and fire could be seen.</p><p>Within the small underground chamber, the thunder roared like the end of the world.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression remained calm and unmoving. Although the phenomenon was terrifying, it was merely his true energy manifested, incapable of harming him.</p><p>But at this moment, the altar stirred.</p><p>"Crack!"</p><p>Suddenly, an unusual thunderbolt struck the wind and thunder.</p><p>This thunderbolt originated from the altar, specifically from a rune on one side of the altar.</p><p>A moment before, the rune had glowed, coming alive, wriggling like a tadpole, eventually transforming into a thunderbolt.</p><p>The thunderbolt struck, but did not disappear.</p><p>The wind and thunder were drawn to the thunderbolt, absorbing the wind and thunder manifested by Qin Sang's true energy, becoming even brighter, appearing almost substantial.</p><p>Then came continuous thunderclaps.</p><p>One rune after another glowed, transforming into thunderbolts.</p><p>As more and more runes appeared, countless thunderbolts floated around Qin Sang.</p><p>So many thunderbolts surrounded Qin Sang that the light almost obscured his figure.</p><p>One could clearly see that these thunderbolts were arranged according to the structure of the main altar, forming a real "Thunder Altar."</p><p>This demonstrated Qin Sang's understanding of the altar; he was the core of the Thunder Altar!</p><p>The moment the "Thunder Altar" formed, Qin Sang's perception of the main altar and the altar array became clearer.</p><p>Finally, a veil was lifted from the mysterious, previously opaque, energy within the altar.</p><p>Because the altar was still under repair, Qin Sang's vision remained blurry, making it difficult to discern details.  Within the radiant energy, a sheet of paper was suspended!</p><p>A silvery sheet, light as a feather, seemingly weightless, composed of thunderous energy.  The paper was covered in dense, illegible script; it was clearly not normal writing.</p><p>Qin Sang was startled, as this differed from his expectations.  If the paper merely recorded ancient secrets or Daoist incantations, while a significant find, it would force him to alter his plans.</p><p>Qin Sang calmed himself and focused his observation.  Despite employing various methods, the script remained unreadable. However, he gradually noticed something unusual about the paper.</p><p>"Indeed!"</p><p>Qin Sang's expression softened, a smile appearing.  He had confirmed it: this thunder-paper was not merely for recording, but a manifestation of talismanic power.</p><p>As expected, this was not simply an altar, but an altar for ritual practice. This talisman was far more profound than any third-order divine talisman in the Five Thunder Envoys' Seal.</p><p>It was a fourth-order divine talisman!</p><p>In the Daoist court, a fourth-order talisman corresponded to the He Tu position, held only by those who have reached the Unity stage of cultivation!</p><p>"I wonder which fourth-order talisman it is?"</p><p>Qin Sang was filled with anticipation.  Only upon the altar's complete restoration would the talisman's full form be revealed.  Unable to wait, he began to repair the main altar with all his might.</p><p>Meanwhile,</p><p>In the four cardinal directions, Taiyi, Luohou, Lingshi, and Guihou—Qin Sang's four subordinate cultivators at the Transformation stage—each led a detachment of demon soldiers, securing a sub-altar and holding their positions.  They simultaneously studied the altar formations, assisting Qin Sang, and trained their demon soldiers, instructing them in the ways of thunder and fire.</p><p>…</p><p>Below the mountain, chaos reigned.</p><p>Yan, having subdued neighboring small states, launched a surprise attack on Qi, inflicting heavy casualties. Qi, having suffered a setback, retreated repeatedly, ultimately losing two provinces to Yan before stabilizing its position.</p><p>Simultaneously, the third prince of Liang, having failed in his bid for the throne, defected to Yan, submitting to the Yan monarch and requesting military aid to expel the rebellious officials.</p><p>The cultivator assisting the third prince, dispatched to the mortal realm, was Zhao Du, a Foundation Establishment cultivator.  Following his master's defeat, he joined Yan, obeying Yu Lang's commands.</p><p>Having secured a righteous cause, Yan mobilized its army against Liang. Zhao Du and Tao Teng led the vanguard, but with the situation in Yan stabilized, Yu Lang's personal presence was unnecessary.</p><p>The Yan monarch appointed Yu Lang as Supreme Commander-in-Chief, personally leading the three armies.  Yu Lang's prestige in Yan was unparalleled; the army's morale soared.</p><p>Yan, having long prepared, invaded Liang, utilizing the third prince's banner.  Taking advantage of Liang's recent internal strife and instability, their army achieved rapid victories, conquering three provinces in a month, their forces approaching Liang's capital.</p><p>Liang was in turmoil, the populace gripped by fear.</p><p>Just as victory seemed within reach, a secret message arrived: the new Liang emperor had secretly contacted Qi, inviting their army to attack from the south, the two nations combining forces against Yan.  Whether this was a cunning strategy or a prelude to a grand feast of conquest remained unknown.</p><p>Yu Lang and his officers conferred, deciding to press on.  Finally, the three armies met at Huangzhou in Liang.</p><p>Huangzhou, less than five hundred li from Liang's capital, lay on the Du River.  Once the army crossed the river, they could advance directly to the capital; Liang would have no natural defenses left.  For Liang, this would be the final battle.</p><p>The autumn wind howled.  Sails dotted the river like a forest.  Along both banks of the great river, a chilling atmosphere pervaded, the vast armies stretching as far as the eye could see.</p><p>A tall ship tower was erected on the west bank of the Du River.  A contingent of soldiers ascended, led by Yu Lang, Tao Teng, and Zhao Du.</p><p>Yu Lang, clad in white robes without armor, a sword at his waist, resembled a scholarly general.  Tao Teng and Zhao Du, both prominent generals, were fully armored, their bearing commanding.</p><p>Once on the ship tower, the scene on the river was laid before them.  The Yan army was busily constructing boats and pontoon bridges, preparing for the river crossing.  On the east bank, the enemy responded in kind, their sails stretching across the water and land forces diligently building fortifications.</p><p>"This will be a hard-fought battle,"</p><p>Yu Lang sighed.  Yan's continuous victories seemed glorious, but more war meant more casualties.</p><p>This went against their original intention of descending from the mountains and entering the world, but they had no choice. They had already done their best.</p><p>Over the years, Yulang and Taoteng had been under immense pressure; they couldn't afford a single loss. Only by continuously winning and ending the war quickly could they end the suffering.  Taoteng felt a deep sense of unease.</p><p>Zhao Du, however, was not affected much. In his view, ordinary people were merely pawns in his pursuit of advancement.  Losing last time meant being subservient and following orders.  Any future great achievements would be beyond his reach; he could only hope he hadn't backed the wrong horse, that Yulang was truly capable.  The casualties among the common people were of no concern to him.</p><p>Most cultivators who had entered the mortal realm shared Zhao Du's mindset.</p><p>"Tomorrow, the weather will be fine; it's the perfect time to cross the river!"</p><p>Yulang observed the celestial signs, then his expression turned solemn. He looked east, gripped his sword hilt, and gave the order in a low voice.</p><p>"Yes, General!"</p><p>All the commanders responded in unison.</p><p>Unexpectedly, before Yulang had finished speaking, a sharp whistling sound suddenly came from the enemy camp on the east bank of the great river. A gray light shot out of the enemy's tent, swift as an arrow, heading straight for the river.  A cackling laugh followed.</p><p>"Hahaha...Better late than never! All the generals are here; it's a perfect opportunity to wipe you all out, saving me the trouble!"</p><p>The laughter shook the heavens, like rolling thunder, clearly audible on both banks of the river.  In an instant, countless soldiers were stunned, staring blankly at the gray light in the sky.</p><p>It was an old man!</p><p>His face was extremely old and wrinkled, the gray light emanating from his gray robe. Without any tools, he was flying in the air, covering hundreds of yards with each step, instantly reaching the river's surface.</p><p>All the ordinary people were dumbfounded, unable to believe their eyes.  Someone was actually flying!</p><p>The army was in an uproar. Some cried out "God!", others "Demon!", descending into chaos. This scene was beyond the comprehension of ordinary mortals, existing only in mythical stories, yet it was unfolding before their very eyes.</p><p>Yulang and the other two's faces changed.  Someone was breaking the rules!</p><p>Based on the balance of forces, the Yan Kingdom was slightly weaker, but the Qi and Liang Kingdoms were defeated by Yan, and their morale was far lower.  Unexpectedly, Yan had a greater chance of victory.</p><p>The opponent's cultivator couldn't contain himself and personally intervened. Furthermore, this old man's cultivation was extremely high.</p><p>The old man, hovering above the river, lightly flicked his whisk. The river water suddenly solidified, with a cracking sound, instantly forming a thick layer of ice. The ice was an eerie black. With this single move, he could easily kill the three of them.</p><p>His eyes were cold, fixed on the ship's deck, finally settling on Yulang, filled with killing intent. His gaze was like a sword, sending a tremor through their hearts, their blood seeming to freeze.</p><p>In this critical moment, a fully armored personal guard behind Yulang shifted slightly, about to step forward, then stopped, looking downriver. Several green rainbows burst through the air on the river's surface, accompanied by a strong, resonant shout.</p><p>"Old Fish Demon, I knew you wouldn't be able to hold back. Leave the mortal realm for the younger generation. Bullying the weak – what kind of skill is that? Let this old man have a go at you!"</p><p>The guard was Sha Jia Yu.  His eyes flickered as he recognized the newcomer, whispering, "It's the Kuang family ancestor!"</p><p>The situation changed!</p><p>Yulang and Taoteng exchanged glances, the same thought flashing through their minds: cultivators were directly intervening, joining the battle.  Was it their earlier suggestion that had swayed Taoteng's master, or had this been planned all along?</p><p>Yulang didn't understand, but he remained calm. Seeing the enemy army advancing across the ice, shouting battle cries, he ordered his troops to restore order and had Sha Jia Yu assist him in taking to the air.</p><p>"Evil spirits are running rampant! Everyone must slay them! Soldiers, come with me to eliminate the demons!"</p><p>Seeing that their side also had a celestial being, and it was their commander, the initially panicked army's morale soared, erupting in a thunderous roar of cheers.</p><p>The old man's face darkened; he was about to swing his whisk to kill Yulang when a green rainbow sped towards him, blocking his path, revealing a refined scholar.</p><p>The Kuang family ancestor nodded to Yulang, stomped on the ice, shattering it. The Qi and Liang troops in the river were thrown into disarray, their cries echoing.</p><p>The old man coldly snorted, swinging his whisk back at the Kuang family ancestor.  Without fluster, the ancestor summoned a green short sword, transforming into a sword rainbow, entangling with the whisk.</p><p>Gray mist filled the river surface, sword light flashing, making onlookers recoil. The other green rainbows arrived late and didn't join the battle between the two Yuan Ying ancestors. They flew to Yulang.  They were all Kuang family members, bowing to him and offering a token.</p><p>"The seven sons of the Kuang family, by order of Master Yun Xian, are here to assist General Qin! The Master has decreed: General Qin's military prowess and strategic wisdom are unparalleled!  Henceforth, the Qi, Liang, Yan, Zhao, and Xuan kingdoms, both mortal and immortal, will all obey General Qin's commands, assisting him in slaying demons and establishing immortal merit!"</p>
