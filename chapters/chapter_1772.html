<h1>Chapter 1763: Dream-Shifting Four Seasons Flower</h1><p>You Yi Shi flashed to a position between the two.</p><p>Yun Wei also withdrew his divine ability, a look of unwillingness on his face, but he understood the principle of accepting defeat. After returning the courtesy, he hesitated for a moment and said, "It's not that this humble Daoist exaggerates, this Decaying Impurity Curse is a true inherited poison curse of this humble Daoist's sect. Once the poison curse invades the five viscera, there's no cure. Fellow Daoist, having been afflicted by this curse, if you notice anything unusual, don't be arrogant, quickly find a way to detoxify it."</p><p>Qin Sang paused slightly. This person was indeed honorable. "Thank you, Fellow Daoist, for the reminder. This humble Daoist understands."</p><p>The Poison Bead could manipulate the primordial poison of the Five Transformations Spirit Insects and naturally didn't fear a mere Decaying Impurity Curse. The moment the power of the poison curse entered his body, it was completely absorbed by the Poison Bead, not harming Qin Sang in the slightest.</p><p>Even without the Poison Bead, Qin Sang, having activated his Spiritwood Body, possessed an extraordinary resistance to potent poisons. Yun Wei's defeat was inevitable.</p><p>At this time, the always solemn You Yi Shi suddenly interjected, "I once witnessed Fellow Daoist Yun Shan cast the Decaying Impurity Curse. Its power wasn't discernible to the naked eye, but it was far less insidious than the one Fellow Daoist used just now."</p><p>Yun Wei humbly replied, "Senior Brother Yun Shan's cultivation is far superior to this humble Daoist's. This humble Daoist merely had a stroke of luck and gained a bit of fortuitous encounter."</p><p>"I heard that some time ago, your esteemed sect found an ancient Daoist ruin in the northern part of Ju Shan Zhi and reaped a bountiful harvest. It seems the rumors are true," You Yi Shi said, giving him a deep look.</p><p>Yun Wei sighed, "The obtained items were merely a few fragmented scrolls, only enough to mend and patch our sect's inheritance, unable to break free from the conventional.  Encountering an opponent like Fellow Daoist Qing Feng, this humble Daoist is still helpless, isn't he?"</p><p>Having said that, Yun Wei excused himself to You Yi Shi, then said to Qin Sang, "Until we meet again."</p><p>With that, he strode away.</p><p>Qin Sang listened to their conversation, thinking that the Lou Gu Mountain seemed to specialize in poison Dao and talismans.</p><p>He thought of his own Poison Bead.</p><p>Usually, against enemies, he could only secretly release the potent poison within the Poison Bead.  Not only was this inefficient, but it was also easily detected by opponents, ruining his efforts.  Currently, only the *Heavenly Extinction Soul-Shaking Divine Needles* was a poison Dao grand divine ability that could utilize the potent poison, and it still had a lot of untapped potential.</p><p>He might as well contact Lou Gu Mountain if the opportunity arose.</p><p>Lost in thought, Qin Sang followed the Nine Heavens You Yi Shi back to the main hall.</p><p>You Yi Shi mused, "Fellow Daoist is a physical cultivator; this Dao Decree isn't particularly suitable for you. However, as we agreed beforehand, this humble Daoist won't stop you. Fellow Daoist, remember to proceed with caution."</p><p>With that, You Yi Shi handed the Dao Decree to Qin Sang.</p><p>After reading it, Qin Sang was greatly surprised.  "Herb gathering?"</p><p>He wasn't being asked to hunt down a Yao Shuai of the Gui Fang Kingdom, nor to perform some secret mission for the Dao Court.</p><p>On the contrary, the task was unexpectedly simple, merely requiring him to gather a spiritual herb.</p><p>But simple didn't mean easy.</p><p>The spiritual herb was called the Dream-Shifting Four Seasons Flower, and the Dao Decree stated that it grew in a place called Gui Die Mountain.</p><p>Gui Die Mountain was a large mountain range within Ju Shan Zhi, but it was located on the eastern border of Ju Shan Zhi, bordering the Gui Fang Kingdom.</p><p>The Dao Decree frankly stated that this place had already been incorporated into the Gui Fang Kingdom's territory and granted to a Yao Hou.</p><p>Qin Sang frowned and asked, "Could this Dream-Shifting Four Seasons Flower be the prized possession of some great Yao Mo in the Gui Fang Kingdom?"</p><p>Stealing medicine from a great Yao Mo's cave dwelling was undoubtedly a path to death.</p><p>"Gui Die Mountain is located within the territory of a Yao Hou, but it's relatively remote, and this spiritual herb should not have been discovered by the Yao Mo yet, otherwise, it would have been harvested long ago. After this spiritual herb matures, it moves within a certain range at four specific times each day, making it incredibly elusive.  In fact, we can't be certain that the Dream-Shifting Four Seasons Flower exists on Gui Die Mountain.  It's a deduction based on certain signs. Fellow Daoist, upon arriving at Gui Die Mountain, you must first confirm the existence of this flower. If it's impossible, don't force it.  Bring back concrete clues, and Senior Ling Xu will also offer appropriate compensation..."</p><p>You Yi Shi first explained the characteristics of the Dream-Shifting Four Seasons Flower, then handed him a jade slip.</p><p>The jade slip recorded a route to Gui Die Mountain and even included markings of Yao Mo near Gui Die Mountain.</p><p>However, You Yi Shi had forewarned him that this geographical map wasn't recently drawn, and the situation was ever-changing, so it shouldn't be taken as gospel.</p><p>After a short while, Qin Sang took his leave.</p><p>Nine Heavens You Yi Shi watched Qin Sang's figure disappear out the door, then turned and returned to the inner hall.</p><p>Outside, Qin Sang summoned a spirit beast, returned to his cave dwelling, took out the Dao Decree, then the geographical map, and began to ponder.</p><p>Over the years, he had been diligently collecting information about Ju Shan Zhi.</p><p>As expected, he would likely stay here for a long time, as the two Zhi of the Dao Court weren't suitable for rogue cultivators.</p><p>Ju Shan Zhi, in the narrow sense, referred to a long, narrow area centered around where the Dao Court and the Gui Fang Kingdom's armies faced off.  Ju Shan Zhi cultivators vividly called this area the Yellow Springs Path.</p><p>As the name implied, this was the place where the two sides fought the most battles, where blood had once flowed like rivers and corpses piled up into mountains.</p><p>He Ming Mountain was within the Yellow Springs Path. The place where Qin Sang had slain the tiger demon and Star Valley were considered the northern and southern edges of the Yellow Springs Path.</p><p>In reality, compared to the true Ju Shan Zhi, the Yellow Springs Path wasn't vast, only equivalent to two or three-tenths of Zhong Mao Zhi.</p><p>The former Ju Shan Zhi was the largest of the two Zhi and two mountains, said to be larger than Zhong Mao Zhi and Bai Shi Zhi combined.  The Yellow Springs Path was more like a battlefield specifically reserved for the Dao Court and the Gui Fang Kingdom.</p><p>The two sides hadn't considered consolidating Ju Shan Zhi, advancing step by step to occupy the entire territory and threaten the enemy's heartland.  However, facts had proven that such attempts had failed, unable to withstand the opponent's counterattacks, gradually forming the current situation.</p><p>North of the Yellow Springs Path, there were still vast stretches of unclaimed land, where countless sects and forces of Ju Shan Zhi were scattered, avoiding the battlefield and surviving between the two major powers.</p><p>Among the native sects of Ju Shan Zhi, Yin Tian Gong was the most renowned. Those like Yin Tian Gong, daring to directly build their immortal city in the vortex of war, were few and far between.</p><p>Other sects only wished their mountain gates were further from the battlefield.  Because of this, the desolate area where Star Valley was located came into being.</p><p>But these sects couldn't hope for peaceful cultivation either.  Outside, there was no shortage of Yao Xiu and human traitors supported by the Gui Fang Kingdom, with constant covert struggles and open conflicts.</p><p>Ju Shan Zhi was destined for chaos.</p><p>If Gui Die Mountain were located outside the Yellow Springs Path, things would be easier. Unfortunately, it wasn't the case.</p><p>If Qin Sang were to go to Gui Die Mountain, the safest route would be to detour from either side, infiltrate the Gui Fang Kingdom, and secretly approach Gui Die Mountain.</p><p>But the further east he traveled, the closer he got to the Gui Fang Kingdom, the more careful he still needed to be.</p><p>"Alright, I'll take the opportunity to experience the customs and practices of Ju Shan Zhi..."</p><p>Qin Sang muttered to himself, having already made up his mind.</p><p>The next morning, Qin Sang left He Ming Mountain and set off alone.</p><p>He didn't follow the route planned for him by the Dao Decree. Upon leaving the city, he headed straight north. On the way, he remembered Star Valley and went to take a look.  Star Valley hadn't been destroyed, and the Daoist was long gone.</p><p>The Daoist's token was still in his possession, but Qin Sang wasn't in a hurry to use this favor.</p><p>Continuing north from Star Valley, Qin Sang didn't encounter many cultivators along the way.</p><p>This place was too close to the Gui Fang Kingdom's main camp, and traces of Yao Mo could be found from time to time. Ju Shan Zhi cultivators, when heading to He Ming Mountain or traveling south, would deliberately detour westward for a certain distance, and few dared to travel directly through here.</p><p>Crossing the vast mountains, when Qin Sang reached human territory again, he encountered another kind of mortal.</p><p>They didn't live a nomadic life like the Gui Min, eating raw meat and drinking blood, but they also couldn't live a stable life like normal people under the Dao Court's rule. They were somewhere in between Gui Min and normal people.</p><p>The cultivators of Ju Shan Zhi also enlightened mortals, treating them as seeds for their sects. However, unlike the Dao Court, they couldn't completely expel the Six Heavens' ancient Qi from the mortals. As they aged, the mortals would still gradually transform into Gui Min.</p><p>According to Qin Sang's investigation, the biggest difference between this place and the Dao Court's rule was the absence of Earth Veins.</p><p>The unique environment of this world created various bizarre scenes, each bringing a sense of wonder to Qin Sang.</p><p>Incidentally, he also became curious about the Gui Fang Kingdom, wondering how this kingdom of Yao and Gui managed to create Yao Xiu and stand against the Dao Court.</p><p>He didn't venture too far north, but turned east, traveling all the way, observing the scenery without much pause.</p><p>The further east he went, the more Yao Mo appeared, from areas of human-Yao coexistence to the emergence of Yao kingdoms of varying sizes.</p><p>To avoid exposing himself, Qin Sang activated the Heavenly Yao Transformation, sprouting wings on his back, exuding a demonic aura even purer than that of a Yao Xiu.</p><p>His confidence in completing this Dao Decree stemmed from the Heavenly Yao Transformation. With this divine ability, he could swagger through the Yao kingdoms. Even if he encountered Yao Xiu of the same rank, he wouldn't fear his identity being discovered.</p><p>After making a large detour, bypassing the Gui Fang Kingdom's main camp, he continued eastward, traversing mountains and rivers, finally stopping at the border of a Yao kingdom in the eastern part of Ju Shan Zhi.</p><p>"Ten thousand li east of here should be Gui Die Mountain..."</p><p>Qin Sang stood atop a rocky mountain, gazing eastward, pondering for a moment, then formed a hand seal, concealing his aura and figure, and quietly headed east.</p><p>According to his understanding, Gui Die Mountain was the territory of a Yao Hou titled Liu Hou in the Yao race.</p><p>The Yao Hou of the Gui Fang Kingdom all possessed Nascent Soul stage strength.  Qin Sang didn't want to directly confront such a powerful being, fortunately, Gui Die Mountain wasn't at the heart of Liu Hou's territory.</p><p>Arriving here was equivalent to entering the hinterland of the Gui Fang Kingdom.  No amount of caution could be excessive.</p><p>There were certainly dangers.  If there were no dangers, how could he exchange for the token of an alchemy Grandmaster?</p><p>Qin Sang stealthily moved, indeed discovering patrolling Yao soldiers along the way, but their cultivation levels were all low and couldn't possibly see through his disguise.</p><p>…</p><p>Over a hundred fire crows flew in from the distant mountains in a neat formation, their fiery feathers dyeing the sky red.</p><p>The two fire crows in front were noticeably larger, and one of them had a broken tail.</p><p>The broken-tailed fire crow scanned the mountains below, yawned, and complained to the leader beside him, "Big brother, we've flown three rounds already.  It's time to rest.  Every day like this, year after year like this. I've counted every blade of grass on these mountains. When have we ever seen a single human soldier? This is Lord Hou's territory.  The humans would have to breach our main camp before they could reach here."</p><p>The fire crow leader cawed, and the crows flapped their wings, withdrawing their demonic fire, landed on the ground, and rested wherever they chose.</p><p>The broken-tailed fire crow wrapped its wings around itself, landed in a sheltered mountain hollow, and lay down comfortably.</p><p>Just as it was about to meditate, the broken-tailed fire crow suddenly felt its consciousness become hazy, and immediately fell into a deep sleep.  At the same time, a human figure appeared before it.</p><p>The newcomer waved his hand, setting up a restriction, and woke the broken-tailed fire crow.</p><p>The broken-tailed fire crow was dazed and answered whatever the newcomer asked.</p><p>The fire crow leader stood on high ground, keeping watch. An hour passed, then he gave the signal again.  He waited for a while before the broken-tailed fire crow wobbly flew up to rejoin them, having no memory of what had just transpired.</p><p>Not far away, Qin Sang looked away.</p><p>In the following days, he used the same method, gathering information from these Yao guards, cross-referencing it with the content of the Dao Decree, and investigating Gui Die Mountain and the surrounding forces.</p><p>This place was still some distance from the Yao Hou's mansion.</p><p>What Qin Sang needed to guard against were the Yao Shuai cultivating nearby.</p><p>Previously, there had been only one Yao Shuai near Gui Die Mountain.</p><p>Now, the Gui Die Mountain range was divided in two, becoming the territories of two Yao Shuai, one named Chi Wei Yao Shuai, the other Zhao You Yao Shuai, each commanding countless Yao soldiers, which significantly increased the difficulty.</p><p>Due to the nature of the Dream-Shifting Four Seasons Flower, harvesting it might disturb the surrounding earth Qi.</p><p>Although the Dao Decree offered solutions, it couldn't completely smooth out the fluctuations of earth Qi, and it was difficult to perfectly conceal them.</p><p>Qin Sang had to leave quickly before the Yao Shuai noticed.  If exposed, he could only use thunderous force to slay the two Yao Shuai and escape the Gui Fang Kingdom before alerting Liu Hou.</p><p>He quietly approached Gui Die Mountain, mentally rehearsing his plan over and over again.</p><p>Soon, he finally reached the edge of Gui Die Mountain.</p><p>Gui Die Mountain wasn't a single peak or a few peaks.  The entire mountain range stretched from north to south, like a natural barrier, protecting the Yao Hou's mansion at the heart of the territory.</p><p>After traveling along the Gui Die Mountain range for a while, Qin Sang chose a hidden location and stopped, taking out the Dao Decree and reading it again.</p><p>His current task was to determine whether the Dream-Shifting Four Seasons Flower existed nearby.  The Dao Decree described three methods.</p><p>The first method was too disruptive and wasn't considered for now.</p><p>The second method involved using a special incense.  At Zi Shi (11 pm - 1 am), he would light the incense.  If the smoke exhibited specific changes, it would indicate that the Dream-Shifting Four Seasons Flower was nearby.</p><p>However, this method had a drawback.  The older the Dream-Shifting Four Seasons Flower, the stronger its concealment ability, and the incense might fail.</p><p>The incense was given to him along with the Dao Decree.</p><p>Qin Sang checked the time and entered meditative tranquility.</p><p>The moon rose and the sun set.</p><p>Finally, Zi Shi arrived. Qin Sang woke up leisurely, flipped his palm, and took out a section of golden incense.  He brushed his finger over it, and fragrant smoke curled upwards.</p><p>Strangely, the smoke didn't drift away but swirled around the incense, gradually forming a cluster.</p><p>This meant the incense hadn't sensed the Dream-Shifting Four Seasons Flower. Qin Sang waited for the time it took to drink a cup of tea, then took the incense and left, changing locations.</p><p>As Zi Shi was about to end, Qin Sang extinguished the incense because, due to the Dream-Shifting Four Seasons Flower's characteristics, the incense was only effective during Zi Shi.</p><p>Thus, Qin Sang cultivated during the day and lit the incense at night, searching for the spiritual herb around the Gui Die Mountain range.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Qin Sang circled the entire Gui Die Mountain range, but the incense smoke showed no change.</p><p>"I can only use the third method."</p><p>Qin Sang sighed inwardly and put away the remaining incense.</p><p>The third method was a secret herb-seeking technique. However, using this technique would greatly consume his divine sense. Although Qin Sang didn't want to deplete his divine sense, he had no other choice.</p><p>In the night, Qin Sang returned to the middle section of the Gui Die Mountain range, arriving at a pre-selected cave.</p><p>Sealing the cave, Qin Sang sat down cross-legged. The secret technique flowed through his mind, stirring his divine sense, silently activating the technique.</p><p>According to the requirements of the secret technique, Qin Sang used it every hour.  As time passed day by day, with each successive use, his spiritual perception seemed to permeate the rocks along with the secret technique, unknowingly connecting with the mountains, rivers, plants, and even the earth Qi of this place.</p><p>Prolonged stillness.</p><p>An unknown amount of time passed.  In the dark cave, Qin Sang suddenly opened his eyes, a hint of joy flashing within them.</p><p>He found it!</p><p>(End of Chapter)</p>
