<h1>Chapter 1333: Infiltration</h1><p>Chapter 1333: Infiltration</p><p>Three tokens resonated strangely with each other.</p><p>The leader of the Eastern Alliance held the tokens suspended before him. His lips moved slightly as he formed hand seals and pressed downwards.</p><p>The illusory blades floating around him shimmered and surged towards the celestial barrier.</p><p>The next moment, the Eastern Alliance leader let out a low shout, his facial veins bulging, his expression becoming somewhat ferocious. His aura suddenly changed, and a shadow appeared behind him.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the shadow transformed into the apparition of a three-headed, six-armed ancient demon!</p><p>The demonic shadow was somewhat illusory, but its fierce flames filled the sky.</p><p>Simultaneously, the Eastern Alliance leader took out a palm-sized, similarly three-headed and six-armed, bizarre demonic statue with his other hand.</p><p>The shadow flashed and entered the statue.</p><p>There was a series of cracking sounds, and the statue swelled rapidly, coming to life, transforming into a real ancient demon.  Its demonic eyes blazed with terrifying ferocity, chilling the soul.</p><p>The statue's heads turned. Two looked towards the celestial barrier above, while the third fixed its gaze on the Eastern Alliance leader, its eyes flickering uncertainly.</p><p>The Eastern Alliance leader's heart tightened.  Being stared at by the statue, he felt a stinging pain.</p><p>He could vaguely sense that the statue might not fully obey his commands and showed signs of escaping his control.</p><p>At this thought, the Eastern Alliance leader's face darkened. He quickly cast a spell, letting out a muffled groan as his face turned alarmingly pale.  He then spat out a mouthful of blood, placing a blood-seal on the statue before finally gaining true control of the artifact.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>The Eastern Alliance leader pointed at the celestial barrier.</p><p>At this time, the illusory blades formed by the spirit array had already penetrated the celestial barrier's radiant glow.</p><p>A subtle fluctuation appeared within the glow.</p><p>The area covered by the illusory blades was vast, encompassing the entire celestial barrier near the mountaintop.  As the glow undulated, mysterious runes faintly emerged.</p><p>These illusory blades seemed to be probing the celestial barrier little by little, searching for its weaknesses.</p><p>The Eastern Alliance leader stared intently at the radiant glow.</p><p>After a moment, one of the tokens flashed, becoming several times brighter than before.</p><p>The Eastern Alliance leader's expression shifted slightly. He then pointed to a spot on the celestial barrier and shouted, "Go!"</p><p>The statue let out a ferocious laugh, rising into the air. Its six arms were raised high, like demonic swords, aimed at the radiant glow of the celestial barrier, and plunged fiercely into it.</p><p>‘Pff!’</p><p>The radiant glow shone brightly.</p><p>Mysterious runes shattered, revealing a breach.</p><p>The celestial barrier launched a counterattack; streaks of lightning shot out from the radiant glow, striking the statue fiercely.</p><p>‘Bang! Bang! Bang!’</p><p>The statue trembled violently. Demonic light surged from its body, somehow withstanding the celestial barrier's backlash.  Even so, cracks appeared on its surface, and one arm was even broken off, falling into the radiant glow and quickly being pulverized into ashes.</p><p>Seeing the terrifying power of the celestial barrier, a look of astonishment flashed across the Eastern Alliance leader's eyes.</p><p>But he did not stop, forcefully commanding the statue to advance.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The statue successfully penetrated deep into the radiant glow.</p><p>Seeing this, the Eastern Alliance leader let out a relieved sigh, murmuring, “This statue actually does have a counteractive effect on the celestial barrier.  Unfortunately, its refinement is extremely difficult. Even with the combined strength of the three major alliances, only one was successfully forged.”</p><p>As the statue charged in, the celestial barrier's backlash became even fiercer, shaking violently and impacting the surroundings, causing a significant disturbance.</p><p>The Eastern Alliance leader's smile faded. He immediately erased all traces and retreated.</p><p>Although he tried to conceal his actions, the changes in the celestial barrier could no longer be hidden.</p><p>In the distance, an old woman with a walking stick was patrolling when she sensed something. She abruptly turned her head towards the mountain peak, looking surprised and uncertain.</p><p>Then, she flitted rapidly towards that direction.</p><p>At the same time.</p><p>An old man, having left the volcanic island at some point, traversed the lava and arrived at an unknown location.  He held the token tightly, his expression tense as he looked up at the thick gray fog overhead.</p><p>The fog flowed constantly, but remained relatively calm.</p><p>At that moment.</p><p>A hurricane suddenly appeared in the gray fog without warning.</p><p>‘Rumble… …’</p><p>The gray fog was completely disrupted. The hurricane burst out from the fog, surging downwards, tearing apart the earth, and swirling up scorching lava, as if the entire space was violently shaking.</p><p>The old man was at the heart of the storm.  A red light shimmered around him, revealing a suit of armor protecting his entire body, blocking the lava and debris.</p><p>Then, he suddenly stamped his foot, charging directly towards the depths of the hurricane, facing the storm head-on.</p><p>Entering the grey fog, it was revealed that a barrier, formed by a prohibition, existed here.  This barrier wasn't a celestial prohibition, but one forged by later generations.  At this time, the celestial prohibition outside was being assaulted by the demonic statues.  The barrier, normally protected by the celestial prohibition, now found the celestial prohibition to be a double-edged sword; the shockwaves of the prohibition were cracking the barrier.  Originally, even late-Yuan Ying stage cultivators would find it nearly impossible to break this prohibition. Now, however, it provided an opportunity for the elder.</p><p>“The Alliance Leader’s insight is truly unfathomable, to actually break the celestial prohibition!” the elder exclaimed in wonder.</p><p>He carefully followed the Alliance Leader's instructions. Seeing that the celestial prohibition's fluctuations were slightly weakening and the fissure showed signs of closing, he seized the moment, choosing a slightly larger gap, and resolutely dashed inside.</p><p>Bursting through the barrier, his vision was instantly enveloped in dazzling rays of light.</p><p>“Crack!”</p><p>A terrifying pressure descended. The elder's armor suddenly dimmed, on the verge of shattering.  He gritted his teeth, enduring the excruciating pain, his eyes wide but unable to see anything clearly. Clenching his token tightly, he transformed into a sword light, struggling through the radiant light.  Even though this was only the edge of the radiant light, and not as powerful as the heart of the celestial prohibition, the elder still expended several protective treasures.</p><p>The Foundation Establishment trial realm.  Su Nu and the others stared blankly at the sky.</p><p>Shortly after the token was activated, dark clouds suddenly gathered, and thunder erupted.  Everyone was shocked, looking towards their senior brother, only to find him equally bewildered.</p><p>The scene was terrifying: the earth was cracking and collapsing. The heavens seemed to have opened a huge hole—the sky was falling!  Gale-force winds and thunderbolts struck the cliff walls on both sides, sending boulders tumbling down, and the ground trembled violently.  They never imagined activating the token would cause such a commotion; no one understood the reason.</p><p>Although this place was some distance from the Baobao Pavilion, the cultivators there must have already noticed the anomaly.</p><p>“Senior Brother, what exactly did Master instruct you to do? What have you been hiding from us!” the alluring woman cried out, her face filled with terror as she watched the terrifying sight above, her voice sharp with accusation.</p><p>The elder with the long beard hesitated, “Master only told me to activate the token, nothing…”</p><p>“Look! What's that! It looks like someone!” a strong man suddenly interrupted the senior brother, pointing to the hole in the sky.</p><p>Everyone looked up.  Within the hole, a silver gleam had appeared, seemingly out of nowhere. The silver light descended from the heavens, seemingly encasing a figure!</p><p>“There’s someone! Did we unleash some kind of demon?” the alluring woman anxiously questioned, staring intently for a moment, then her expression changed, “Wait… it looks like…”</p><p>“It’s Master!” the long-bearded elder gasped, his face a mask of shock.</p><p>“Master has secretly crossed over here!”</p><p>Everyone fell silent, stunned and disbelieving.</p><p>—</p><p>—</p><p>Back home, things are quite busy.</p><p>This is to make up for yesterday’s chapter. I'll continue writing tonight; yesterday's and today's updates will be completed.  Check back tomorrow morning.</p>
