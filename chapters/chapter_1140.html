<h1>Chapter 1132: Peak Foundation Establishment</h1><p>“The mysterious slate was found on the ancient Immortal battlefield.  Looking back, it must have been a demon clan's secret realm.  In my opinion, the only valuable thing there was this slate. Although I discovered it first,  the  Qianji Demon King and a Nascent Soul stage cultivator from the demonic path were also present. Seeing it was an ancient demonic treasure, I didn't want to risk it, so I didn't reveal myself and quietly left…”</p><p>Qing Jun recalled the scene from back then, her expression shifting slightly as she remembered something.</p><p>“They fought fiercely over the slate, for a long time without a clear victor. By then, the ancient array sealing the slate had already been broken. Finally, Qianji Demon King gained a slight advantage, grabbing the slate and flying away.  This slate, likely due to the Qingluan phantom, couldn’t be stored in a dimensional pouch or similar artifact…”</p><p>“It can’t be stored in a dimensional pouch?”</p><p>Qin Sang showed surprise.</p><p>Such treasures were indeed rare, each with a unique reason for it; either their origins were extraordinary, or their power was astonishing.</p><p>However, this was good news for Qin Sang.</p><p>The Qianji Demon King couldn't carry the slate around forever.  If it was stored in his cave, Qin Sang might have a chance.</p><p>“According to our investigation, and the information from the Two Realms Alliance spies, the Zu Yuan was delayed by something; it wasn't their true strength. We took advantage of this and gained some ground. It's almost certain that once Zu Yuan is done with it, they'll attack again. This time, Zu Yuan's momentum is different from before; it's likely to be a devastating war. To avoid being caught off guard, I must immediately go to the front lines…”</p><p>Qing Jun spoke of the results of the alliance meeting, intending to leave Xiaohan Region.</p><p>She glanced at Qin Sang, “You don't need to worry for now; Dongyang Bo will also go. The fight against Zu Yuan is crucial; he won't be able to easily spare time to bother you. For the next few years, just cultivate within the Yuanshen Sect. The sect's protective array will keep you safe. However…”</p><p>Qing Jun's tone suddenly changed, as she warned, “Right now, we've only found signs of it. Before the war begins, I can help delay them, but once it's a matter of life or death for the cultivation world, I can't keep you hidden within the sect… unless you leave Xiaohan Region.”</p><p>Qin Sang's face darkened, understanding his senior sister's meaning; he didn't have much time left to break through.</p><p>If he failed to break through, Qin Sang knew that no matter how strong he was, he wouldn't be worth as much as a Nascent Soul cultivator, and he wouldn't be able to ask Qing Jun for protection.</p><p>Entering the battlefield, even with many life-saving measures, he would need to constantly guard against Dongyang Bo’s open and covert attacks.</p><p>The Ziwei Palace was not open, so he couldn't return to the Canglang Sea.</p><p>Heading south, past the Tianxing Alliance, lay territory controlled by Zu Yuan; under these circumstances, it would be like walking into a trap.</p><p>…</p><p>Shaohua Mountain's gate was within the lake.</p><p>Yuanshen Sect was in the mountain range on the shore.</p><p>In Xiaohan Region, this mountain range was second only to Tianduan Mountain in scale, stretching west from the northern shore of Yun Cang Marsh, then changing direction and extending to the far north. It was a natural barrier separating the human and demon realms.</p><p>Yuling Sect's gate was also in this mountain range, but in the north.</p><p>Going directly west from Yuanshen Sect led straight to the demon realm.</p><p>Deep in the mountains and forests.</p><p>Two figures flew towards it.</p><p>There were two high peaks here, with steep terrain, only a hundred meters wide between them, like a gate – the entrance of Yuanshen Sect.</p><p>Qing Jun led Qin Sang through the gate into the sect.</p><p>Qin Sang found everything in Yuanshen Sect to be normal.</p><p>Low-level cultivators walked back and forth, busy with various tasks; the entire sect was operating normally.</p><p>After Qing Jun took over Yuanshen Sect, she received warnings from the Red-Haired Ancestor and others, not to act recklessly within the sect. She disguised herself as Leng Yuntian, secretly eliminated a few people involved in the murder case, and then stopped, without causing too much trouble.</p><p>As a result, other Yuanshen Sect disciples didn't notice any changes in the sect.</p><p>Qin Sang was extremely impressed by Qing Jun's masterful disguise, wondering if it had something to do with her mastery of puppetry.</p><p>“This was originally the cave dwelling of the Leng father and son; you can cultivate here.”</p><p>Qing Jun brought Qin Sang to Yuanshen Sect's restricted area.</p><p>Just then, a Yuanshen Sect elder came to see them.</p><p>“Elder Xun, summon the sect disciples, all Foundation Establishment Mid-Stage and above, including all the elders, to the main hall. I will be there shortly.”</p><p>Qing Jun commanded.</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>Elder Xun left to carry out her orders.</p><p>Seeing Qing Jun was about to summon the sect disciples, Qin Sang truly felt the urgency of the situation.</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly said, “Senior Sister, after thinking it over, I don't want to cultivate in Yuanshen Sect. If Dongyang Bo really wants to kill me, and if something happens and I need to go out, I might fall into a trap.”</p><p>Qing Jun agreed, “Alright.”</p><p>Qin Sang was secretly sent away by Qing Jun, returning to Yunyouzi’s cave dwelling, and bringing Bai Ye along.</p><p>This was the advantage of having multiple safe havens.</p><p>Bai devoted himself to comprehending the Corpse Soul Pearl, unconcerned with his location.</p><p>“The Star Yuan Infusion is effective; my physical body has indeed grown stronger. But it’s not a breakthrough, not even close to true fourth-layer cultivation.  This in-between state… I wonder how much it will help?”</p><p>Qin Sang closed himself off for cultivation, examined his inner self, and after much contemplation, took out a jade slip.  Before leaving, Qing Jun had gifted him the Yuan Shen Gate’s treasured ancestral notes on Nascent Soul formation.</p><p>Qin Sang was deeply grateful. He also understood this was likely Qing Jun’s last act of assistance.</p><p>He quickly reviewed the jade slip's contents.</p><p>Qin Sang then activated his cultivation techniques and entered meditative practice.</p><p>…</p><p>The clouds of war once again loomed over Xiao Han Region.  </p><p>For now, both sides were locked in a standoff, probing each other’s strength.</p><p>However, the previous relaxed atmosphere was gone.</p><p>As battle reports arrived, even though it became clear that the Crime Abyss’s advance wasn’t as overwhelming as initially feared, a shadow fell over the cultivators.</p><p>Lower-level cultivators could only rely on fate.</p><p>Four years passed.</p><p>Qin Sang, single-minded in his pursuit, finally completed the seventh Killing Talisman, breaking through to the peak of the Core Formation stage!</p><p>His cultivation base and realm both reached their zenith.</p><p>However, the Sky Eye Butterfly’s breakthrough to the late third transformation stage was many years behind Qin Sang's.  It wouldn't happen quickly. Qin Sang knew he couldn’t rush it; he had prepared ample spirit herbs, and the Butterfly reaching the peak of the third transformation was only a few years away.</p><p>After achieving peak cultivation, Qin Sang didn’t leave seclusion. He continued to refine his cultivation, reviewing his past progress and addressing any shortcomings.</p><p>He simultaneously studied the notes on Nascent Soul formation left by his senior sister Qing Jun.</p><p>Taking the Du E Pill wasn't an option at this point.</p><p>Still, Qin Sang attempted to break through his bottleneck several times, with predictable results.</p><p>Considering that Dong Yang Bo had painstakingly cultivated so many disciples, each more talented than himself, yet none had successfully formed a Nascent Soul, Qin Sang felt a sense of resignation.</p><p>“I don't necessarily have to remain here in seclusion to comprehend these notes. Before the Sky Eye Butterfly reaches its peak, perhaps I should visit the Demon Region.  Given the current situation, the Demon Region will also be affected; maybe I can make some discoveries…”</p><p>Qin Sang mused thoughtfully.</p><p>This was also why he was reluctant to remain confined within the Yuan Shen Gate.</p><p>He was still restless.</p>
