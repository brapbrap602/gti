Chapter 664: Pingbo Harbor


Xing.
Pingbo Harbor, a small, prosperous nation controlled by a single power, where the people lived peaceful and productive lives. Qin Sang settled the old witch doctor in a large city within Xing, ensuring his comfort in his old age and sealing his memories of Qin Sang.

Qin Sang did not head directly to Pingbo Harbor. The black coffin on his back was too conspicuous, and any cultivator with a higher cultivation level could easily see through it and discover Du Han inside.

While he had avoided other cultivators on his journey, this would be impossible in Pingbo Harbor.  Core Formation cultivators were numerous within the harbor, and it was rumored that even a Nascent Soul Grandmaster resided there.

He could have killed Du Han at this point, but Qin Sang wasn't ready to let him off so easily.

Although the first half of the *Heavenly Yin Corpse Manual* only allowed for the creation of corpse puppets from Foundation Establishment cultivators, Qin Sang still intended to try it on Du Han. If it proved impossible, he would give up.

Creating corpse puppets required Earthly Yin Qi. He still had some left in his Lesser Yin Magnetic Bottle, but it wasn't enough to refine a living corpse.

Earthly Yin Qi was uncommon, and information about it could only be found in Pingbo Harbor.

Qin Sang planned to first establish a cave dwelling in the wilderness to store the black coffin before entering the city to gather information.  Unexpectedly, the land outside Pingbo Harbor was extremely valuable, with nearly every spiritual vein, large or small, already occupied by individuals or sects.

Forced to venture farther from Pingbo Harbor, Qin Sang eventually found a hidden spiritual vein in a desolate mountain range, barely suitable for establishing a cave dwelling.

After placing the black coffin inside and setting up restrictive and concealment formations, Qin Sang, feeling much lighter, donned a cloak and flew towards Pingbo Harbor.

Before entering Pingbo Harbor, he was met with a breathtaking sight: countless ships, their sails billowing in the wind, filled the harbor.

A sea of ships stretched as far as the eye could see. The largest were incredibly luxurious, with multi-storied cabins, each ship as massive as a mountain.

Beside these behemoths were smaller vessels, which, though appearing less impressive, were still substantial, capable of withstanding powerful ocean storms.

Qin Sang landed atop a rocky peak, gazing out at the vast ocean. A gentle sea breeze carried the faint scent of salt as he watched cultivators occasionally fly across the sky on their magical instruments, where the water met the horizon.

However, most of these cultivators either ascended from the ships or emerged from Pingbo Harbor to land on a particular vessel.

For cultivators of the Canglang Sea, sea travel primarily relied on ships. Even Core Formation experts, unless on urgent business, wouldn't fly long distances over the sea using their magical instruments.

Firstly, their spiritual energy wouldn't last. Secondly, the open sea held hidden dangers such as hurricanes and sea beasts.

Encountering danger while depleted of spiritual energy in the vast, unforgiving ocean would leave one truly stranded and helpless.

Qin Sang hadn't flown continuously during his journey from the Western Frontier to Pingbo Harbor. He would land in areas with abundant spiritual energy to rest and recover.

Only Nascent Soul Grandmasters possessed the ability to fly continuously over the sea for months.

As ships entered the harbor, the port bustled with activity.

Although cultivators possessed spatial pouches for storage, their capacity was limited, proving insufficient for large quantities of goods. Countless goods flowed from the ships like a river, and the dockworkers included not only mortals but also low-level cultivators, as well as tamed beasts and demonic beasts.

Matching the enormous harbor was a massive city on land.

The city's scale was unlike anything Qin Sang had ever seen. From afar, houses stretched endlessly, and a faint, almost imperceptible mist shrouded the western part of the city, completely obscuring it from view.

It was early morning, and the city teemed with people, both cultivators and mortals, with long lines forming at the city gates.

The Small Cold Region, divided among various powers, had no place that could accommodate so many people. The Seven Great Passes were situated at the edge of the perilous Ancient Immortal Battlefield, limiting the mortal population and preventing the formation of such a massive city.

After taking in the impressive sight, Qin Sang tightened his cloak and sped towards the gates of Pingbo Harbor.

Mortals and cultivators entered through separate gates. The gate designated for cultivators was guarded by Foundation Establishment cultivators, a mix of humans and witches.

"Fellow Daoist, please wait."

As Qin Sang approached the gate, a guard stopped him, looked him up and down, and politely asked, "Do you have an identification plate? Or are you new to Pingbo Harbor?"

"I am indeed here for the first time. What is an identification plate?"

Qin Sang asked, puzzled.

The guard patiently explained, "Fighting is prohibited within Pingbo Harbor. All cultivators receive an identification plate to verify their identity. The plate not only signifies your status but also determines the extent of your access within the city…"

The guard's explanation revealed that even within the seemingly prosperous Pingbo Harbor, the status of mortals and cultivators remained vastly different. Even among cultivators, there was a hierarchy based on cultivation level.

Pingbo Harbor was divided into four main areas.

The largest was the residential area for mortals, followed by the area designated for Foundation Establishment and Qi Refining cultivators. There was no strict boundary between these two areas.

The smallest area was the western district, previously obscured by the mist, accessible only to Core Formation experts and Nascent Soul Grandmasters. It served as the heart of Pingbo Harbor.

Those with insufficient cultivation could only enter if accompanied by a Core Formation cultivator.

This area was heavily guarded and very tranquil.

Remarkably, it consisted of numerous high-quality cave dwellings. Pingbo Harbor was built upon several large spiritual veins, and the western district occupied the location with the richest spiritual energy.

Naturally, the rent was also extremely high.

The final area was the trading district, located in the north of the city, adjacent to the harbor. It was an enormous marketplace, housing trading companies, auction houses, and more.

Upon hearing this, Qin Sang released his aura, revealing his cultivation level.

The guard was slightly startled, then bowed to Qin Sang and said, "Since Senior is a Core Formation cultivator, the identification plate will be provided free of charge. You will also be exempt from paying spirit stones to enter or exit Pingbo Harbor… Please wait a moment."

Shortly after, the guard returned with an identification plate signifying Core Formation status. Qin Sang examined it, attached it to his waist, and entered the city.

The buns here had a strange, fishy filling.  They weren't good at all.

Disappointed, Qin Sang headed straight for the trading district in the north of the city.

Open displays of power were forbidden within the city, so he had to walk.

With the identification plate at his waist, Qin Sang proceeded unimpeded, quickly reaching the trading district.

Straight streets crisscrossed the district, lined with uniform shops.

Qin Sang slowed his pace, observing as he walked.

Seemingly ordinary shops could be fronts for large trading companies. It was said that some of the most renowned human trading companies had formed an alliance whose power rivaled even the top sects.

"Four Seas Trading Company…"

Qin Sang's eyes lit up as he saw a shop sign.

He had just inquired about several reputable trading companies, and the Four Seas Trading Company was among them.
