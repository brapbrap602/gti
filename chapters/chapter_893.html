<h1>Chapter 885: Jade Finger Peak</h1><p>A Daoist acolyte activated a spherical artifact, generating a white light that enveloped the two of them and flew towards the Twin Cauldrons Sect.</p><p>Under the newcomer's deliberate flattery, the acolyte found him increasingly agreeable and spoke to him in a very amicable tone.</p><p>Of course, the newcomer was also well aware that he was not yet worthy of the acolyte's genuine regard, and this attitude was merely superficial. If he were to say a single wrong word and offend this person, the acolyte would undoubtedly reprimand him without hesitation.</p><p>Since he had already joined the Twin Cauldrons Sect, there was no need to rush things; he could slowly investigate the secrets within.</p><p>Therefore, the newcomer patiently responded to the acolyte's inquiries, rarely taking the initiative to ask any questions himself.</p><p>The place where Elder Huayang had left them was not far from the Twin Cauldrons Sect. After a short flight, the two arrived in front of a mountain range shrouded in a thin mist.</p><p>The acolyte took out a token and shook it slightly. The mist parted to both sides, revealing a small path leading directly to the mountaintop. The acolyte swept up the newcomer, and their light traversed the path in the blink of an eye. Suddenly—</p><p>At the same time, the newcomer's voice of amazement rang out.</p><p>"So this is where the Twin Cauldrons Sect's gate is located! Those three peaks are the Azure Ripple Peaks, and those two facing mountains are the Yin Yang Twin Peaks…"</p><p>The acolyte pointed here and there, a smile on his face, seemingly very satisfied with the newcomer's current expression.</p><p>The newcomer's amazement was not entirely feigned.</p><p>The grandeur of the Twin Cauldrons Sect surpassed even Mount Shaohua, making it the most impressive sect he had ever seen in his life. The Twin Cauldrons Sect was indeed a major sect that held a prominent position in the Boundless Sea. Despite facing decline, its foundation remained astonishing.</p><p>The sky was clear, and white clouds drifted lazily.</p><p>Within this otherworldly paradise-like scene, five towering peaks soared into the heavens like sharp swords, no less impressive than the main peak of Mount Shaohua. The direction the acolyte pointed to was precisely these five peaks.</p><p>The three Azure Ripple Peaks were somewhat scattered, while the Yin Yang Twin Peaks stood close together, with only a narrow, slit-like gap between them. From another angle, they appeared to be a single mountain.</p><p>This reminded the newcomer of Sword Gate Pass on Mount Shaohua.</p><p>Besides these five peaks, other mountains, though also picturesque, were ordinary in comparison.  The acolyte steered the white light around a bend, but instead of taking him directly to the Yin Yang Twin Peaks, he flew towards a nearby mountain range with several peaks standing together.</p><p>The peaks were slender and towering, lush and green, and from time to time, figures of cultivators appeared within the mountains, none of whom possessed high cultivation levels.</p><p>At this moment, the newcomer seemed to have just come back to his senses, his gaze still lingering on the five peaks.  Suddenly, as if remembering something, he casually asked, "Senior Brother Yang, which peak is Bullfighting Peak, the one Grandmaster acquired at the Misty Pavilion?"</p><p>"Bullfighting Peak?"</p><p>The acolyte's expression faltered, his gaze sweeping over the familiar sect grounds.  He looked puzzled. "I almost forgot! I don't seem to have ever heard of Bullfighting Peak. I wonder which peak Grandmaster is referring to. I'll have to ask my senior brother when I get back…"</p><p>Seeing that the acolyte's expression didn't seem feigned, the newcomer thought to himself, "That's strange."</p><p>Even this Foundation Establishment cultivator, who had cultivated in the Twin Cauldrons Sect for many years, didn't know of Bullfighting Peak's existence. No wonder he couldn't find any information about it outside.</p><p>The Twin Cauldrons Sect had imposed such tight secrecy on Bullfighting Peak. He wondered what the reason was.</p><p>The newcomer felt apprehensive and hesitated.</p><p>He had come here based on a vague piece of information, placing a sliver of hope on Bullfighting Peak. Now it seemed that the other party's inheritance had been completely severed. The cultivation method there was likely problematic. Could he truly find what he was looking for? In comparison, the Scorpion Venom Grass might offer a greater chance of success.</p><p>Since he was already here, he might as well see things through.</p><p>The newcomer had gone to great lengths to infiltrate the Twin Cauldrons Sect. He had to investigate thoroughly before leaving.</p><p>"Ahead is Jade Finger Peak. According to sect rules, before you condense the Yin Yang Armor, you must remain on this peak to cultivate. Jade Finger Peak is also called the Outer Sect. Only after receiving true teachings can one enter the Yin Yang Twin Peaks to cultivate.  I'll take you to see Senior Brother Lu first…"</p><p>The acolyte, unable to find an answer, put Bullfighting Peak out of his mind and continued to introduce the sect to the newcomer.</p><p>"Junior Brother Yang!"</p><p>Just then, a faint call suddenly came from the distance, followed by a flash of sword light that flew towards them. In an instant, it arrived, revealing the figure of a middle-aged cultivator.</p><p>This person was exceptionally cordial towards the acolyte. "I heard that Junior Brother Yang has successfully formed his Foundation Establishment. I was planning to visit and congratulate you, but I learned that you had left the mountain with Grandmaster Huayang. I didn't expect to run into you on Jade Finger Peak. Has Grandmaster already taken you as a personal disciple?"</p><p>"So it's Senior Brother Lu!"</p><p>The acolyte cupped his hands in greeting. "This junior brother's Foundation Establishment was also a matter of luck. Grandmaster did mention it, but he hasn't officially taken me as a personal disciple yet."</p><p>Senior Brother Lu congratulated him with envy, his face full of admiration. "Isn't that just a matter of time? This senior brother congratulates you in advance. With Grandmaster Huayang's personal guidance, Junior Brother Yang will surely soar to great heights.  Forming your Gold Core is just around the corner…"</p><p>The two chatted for a while before Senior Brother Lu seemed to notice the newcomer. "Eh, this one looks unfamiliar. Could he be a disciple you've recently taken?"</p><p>The acolyte slowly shook his head. "This junior brother wouldn't be so arrogant. Having just formed my Foundation Establishment, my primary focus is to consolidate my cultivation.  How could I have the ability to instruct a disciple? I came to find you, Senior Brother, precisely because of him. His name is Zhang Yue. Grandmaster recently accepted him into the sect and sent me here to register his name in the Jade Register…"</p><p>"Since he was brought in by Grandmaster Huayang and personally escorted by Junior Brother Yang, his talent must be quite good. Come with me, both of you…"</p><p>Senior Brother Lu seemed not at all surprised by this and immediately led the two of them back to Jade Finger Peak.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the three landed in front of a wooden hall on one of the Jade Finger Peaks.</p><p>Senior Brother Lu waved his hand, opening the hall's restrictive barrier, and walked inside while reminding them, "Junior Brother Yang, although Zhang Yue was brought in by Grandmaster Huayang, we can't omit certain sect regulations."</p><p>"Don't worry, Senior Brother Lu. This junior brother understands. I brought him here for this very reason. Senior Brother, please proceed according to the rules. However, there's one thing I need your help with."</p><p>The acolyte gestured for the newcomer to step forward and answer Senior Brother Lu's inquiries.</p><p>While busy with his tasks, Senior Brother Lu smiled faintly and asked, "What is it that you're referring to, Junior Brother?"</p><p>The acolyte said helplessly, "Why do you ask, Senior Brother, when you already know? The situation of our Yin Yang lineage is known to everyone in the sect. According to the rules, all disciples sent to Jade Finger Peak must take on a mundane task. But those in our Yin Yang lineage must focus on condensing the Yin Yang Armor after entering the sect. If we are entangled in burdensome external duties, when will we be able to break free?"</p><p>A troubled expression appeared on Senior Brother Lu's face. "At the beginning of the year, when the new disciples entered, I did just that, but these matters are closely scrutinized by everyone, and it drew considerable criticism. Why doesn't Grandmaster Huayang simply issue a jade decree? It would save me, a mere Foundation Establishment cultivator, from this dilemma."</p><p>"Grandmaster once said, 'Ancestral laws cannot be easily abolished by a single lineage…'"</p><p>The acolyte sighed softly. "Grandmaster and the others do intend to petition this matter after the Patriarch returns. Until then, we can only ask Senior Brother Lu to accommodate us once more."</p>
