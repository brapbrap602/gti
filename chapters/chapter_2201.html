<h1>Chapter 2191: Empty-Handed</h1><p>A vast forest grew on the expansive lake surface.  The lake was bottomless, and the trees rooted themselves at the lakebed, emerging above the water to form a green island.</p><p>This was once a fearsome bird's nest.  This group of ferocious birds had occupied this place for over ten thousand years. Many cultivators from different clans would avoid this place, and no one had been able to eliminate this flock of birds.</p><p>However, the forest was now deathly silent.  The birds were gone without a trace, but the remnants of their activities remained in the forest.</p><p>‘Rustle… rustle…’</p><p>Mist flowed through the trees, the leaves gently swayed.  A figure appeared on a treetop at the edge of the forest.</p><p>This person sat cross-legged on the branch, light as a swallow, swaying with the tree. Upon closer inspection, his body seemed to merge with the tree, his lower body indistinguishable from the trunk.</p><p>He faced the lake, eyes closed, as if sensing something.</p><p>Suddenly, his eyelids trembled slightly, and then his skin rapidly turned gray and withered, instantly resembling dried tree bark. Finally, his entire body transformed into a withered old vine and fell.</p><p>A voice sounded from deep within the forest.</p><p>“Elder Yuan's information is correct.  That Qin Zhenren is indeed here, and Hong Tian sent him in…”</p><p>Immediately, another voice asked, “Has Elder Yuan arrived?”</p><p>“Elder Yuan was detained by that old man, Yuan Xiang, and he sent Yuan Ren in instead.  They won't have noticed anything, will they?  But those Zhu Yan brutes don't like using formations.” said the first voice.</p><p>Another voice said gravely, “Qin and Yuan Ren are together?”</p><p>“No, Qin brought in a female Daoist.  Hong Tian requires pairs, and he's with the female Daoist; Yuan Ren took a different route.  By the way, the female Daoist's cultivation seems to be only at the early Nascent Soul stage. There are many masters there, I didn't dare use my full power, so I don't know if she's hiding her cultivation.”</p><p>“Nascent Soul Stage? Qin Zhenren keeps her by his side; it seems this pair of dogs and bitches have a deep relationship!” A third voice chimed in excitedly, “Why don't we capture the female cultivator first and threaten Qin Zhenren into submission!”</p><p>“No!”</p><p>The owner of the second voice quickly interrupted, “Qin is ruthless. If he’s selfish and doesn't care about his companions' lives, wouldn't that give him a chance to escape?  Elder Yuan couldn't get in, we can only rely on you two brothers now!”</p><p>“No problem! No problem!  Years ago, I almost failed, and it was thanks to you that your ancestor gave me the Whale Bone Pearl. Your senior brother is my brother too! But who would have thought that Shi, your brother, who had listened to the ancestor's teachings for many years, would die outside, killed by outsiders.”</p><p>The first voice sighed.</p><p>“It’s because my senior brother was too arrogant and underestimated the commoners outside the Sacred Land,” the second voice lamented. He was clearly the immortal boy pursuing Qin Sang.</p><p>Yuan Jian was blocked, but he still had help. Due to the changes in the Sacred Land, some of those brought in by the ancestor were expelled, carrying out the tasks entrusted by the ancestor.</p><p>Therefore, although Hong Tian and the others acted recklessly, they didn't forcibly drive them out of the lake.</p><p>“As expected, Hong Tian has strict restrictions on these people. This is the route Qin Zhenren chose. Unless he's not afraid of being punished by Hong Tian, he certainly won't stray too far,” the first voice paused, “Have you decided where to ambush them?”</p><p>“Humph! After receiving Elder Yuan’s message, I searched the lake.  He's heading towards a hidden realm, perfect for setting up the Xuan Shen Nine-Hua Array.  We should go now!”</p><p>The immortal boy gritted his teeth, a hint of satisfaction at the imminent revenge evident.</p><p>Hearing this, the third voice couldn't help but be surprised, “What? You're going to use the Xuan Shen Nine-Hua Array? Isn’t Qin Zhenren only at the mid-Nascent Soul stage, relying solely on a formation before? He can’t bring the formation in; why is he so cautious?”</p><p>“This man slaughtered a large number of Si You people, yet he was treated as a guest of honor by the Si Emperor and his advisor, who spared no expense to invite him for assistance. He shouldn't be judged by ordinary standards.  He’s also best known for his lightning escape technique, incredibly fast, few can match. If Elder Yuan didn't exaggerate, even Qi’s escape technique is inferior by three points,” the immortal boy said gravely.</p><p>Nascent Soul cultivators are difficult to kill, and those skilled in escape techniques are even harder. This is common knowledge in the cultivation world. They must be firmly restricted; if there's a flaw, they could break through the blockade and ruin everything.</p><p>To deal with Qin Sang, the Xian Tong had more than one plan. However, luring Qin Sang into the Xuan Shen Nine-Flower Array would be the easiest and safest option.</p><p>"Oh? If that's the case, I'd like to witness this masterful lightning escape technique," the first voice chuckled calmly.</p><p>A gentle breeze blew past, dissipating all sound, and the forest returned to its former state.</p><p>…</p><p>Soon, above a body of water, the void distorted, revealing three hazy figures: two tall and one short.</p><p>The short one, a child-like figure, was the Xian Tong.</p><p>Pointing downwards, the Xian Tong said, "It's here!"</p><p>The two looked down into the water, surprised to find a brilliant red-gold expanse beneath the surface.  About thirty feet below, the lake water had transformed into lava, flowing along the lakebed.</p><p>This lava field was extensive, strangely emitting no heat. The water above remained unaffected.</p><p>"The hidden realm is below. It masks the aura of the Xuan Shen Nine-Flower Array. If they happen to pass above, we strike immediately. Otherwise, we can devise a plan to lure them here…"</p><p>Having spoken, the Xian Tong plunged into the water.</p><p>Moments later, a spray of ‘water’ erupted from the lava, as the Xian Tong entered the hidden realm, followed by the other two.  Upon entering the lava, they felt a sudden change in environment; an intense heat permeated everywhere, even they found it hard to bear.</p><p>After the Heart Lake's transformation, the hidden realms and legacies within underwent changes, most becoming more chaotic, but their protective formations were also damaged, eliminating the need for painstaking decryption.</p><p>The Xian Tong, having been here before, moved expertly through the realm, stopping at a certain point before activating a spell, summoning their companion beasts.</p><p>Each beast held a jade pendant in its mouth, scattering in different directions. The Xian Tong then sat cross-legged, producing intricate array instruments, distributing them to his companions to set up the formation collaboratively.</p><p>The lava surface rippled slightly, then gradually calmed, showing no abnormalities.</p><p>Meanwhile, Yuan Ren and his companion were speeding towards the location.</p><p>"Brother Yuan Ren, I remember that misty area was an ancient legacy. For years, countless predecessors have attempted to access it, with rumors of untold secrets remaining undiscovered. Why don't we investigate?"</p><p>Yuan Ren's companion was silently suffering.</p><p>He had thought following Yuan Ren meant having a powerful protector, but reality was far different.</p><p>The deeper they went into the Heart Lake, the more dangerous it became.  Grandmaster Hong Tian had given them jade bracelets, but couldn't possibly monitor everyone continuously. It would be better to linger outside for a few days, offering a plausible explanation later, perhaps even gaining some opportunities.</p><p>Given Yuan Ren's status, Grandmaster Hong Tian wouldn't likely reprimand them.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Yuan Ren was driven forward with relentless energy.</p><p>"No! No!"</p><p>Yuan Ren repeatedly shook his head. "That pesky maze, I don't like it!"</p><p>His companion was exasperated, helpless, and dared not leave alone, so he strained to keep up with Yuan Ren's pace.</p><p>…</p><p>"They're here quickly!"</p><p>Inside the hidden realm, the three sensed a distant fluctuation, inwardly relieved.</p><p>They hadn't expected such speed. They had just finished setting up the spirit array, narrowly avoiding missing the opportunity.</p><p>'Whoosh! Whoosh!'</p><p>Two streaks of light pierced through the spirit mist, drawing closer. Their trajectory indicated they would pass over this hidden realm.</p><p>The three rejoiced, preparing to activate the array, but upon sensing the aura of the approaching light, they froze.</p><p>"It's them!"</p><p>Xian Tong's face fell.</p><p>They had painstakingly laid the array, expecting their enemies to fall into their trap, yet it was Yuan Ren.  How could they not be angry?</p><p>The black-robed cultivator sitting to Xian Tong's left remained calm, his eyes flashing.  He said, "Brother, calm down. I did indeed see them take this path.  It seems they changed their route later."</p><p>"It seems that Master Qin is wary.  Ambushing him again will be difficult. We can only openly attack him," the man in green robes on Xian Tong's right frowned.</p><p>"Not necessarily!"</p><p>The black-robed cultivator shook his head slightly, seeming to recall something. "Previously, while I served tea during the ancestor's game of Go, I overheard some secrets. Our sacred land seems to have ties to the Human Daoist sect. Therefore, every time our sacred land opens, we send some Daoist cultivators in. They seem to be searching for something, targeting a hidden realm within the Heart Lake. This time, I did see several more Human cultivators, all from the Daoist sect. Elder Yuan also said that Master Qin has some background, which is why the Zhu Yan clan pays him so much attention…"</p><p>"Oh? There's such a secret? Why would our sacred land be connected to the Human Daoist sect?" the man in green robes was puzzled. "Brother Qi means that they changed routes with Yuan Ren because they were going to that hidden realm?"</p><p>The black-robed man frowned slightly, unsure.</p><p>Just then, the man in green robes gasped, "Why has he stopped?"</p><p>They looked towards the outside of the secluded realm, only to see the leading figure halt at the edge, Yuan Ren appearing, his gaze fixed on the realm below.</p><p>The three of them felt a sudden tension. They had no grievances with Yuan Ren and naturally wouldn't activate the formation to needlessly offend the Zhu Yan tribe. This place was still considered the outer perimeter of Heart Lake; their actions couldn't be kept completely secret. Even if Hong Tian couldn't monitor the entire realm, he would notice any clues.  Angering the Zhu Yan tribe would leave them without Hong Tian's protection.</p><p>Furthermore, Yuan Ren wasn't easy to kill. After a fierce battle, the main target might already be deep within Heart Lake. The depths were far more dangerous than the outside.  Ambushing Qin Sang there was too risky. If Qin Sang sensed danger and slipped into a secluded realm, he might escape.</p><p>"Brother Yuan Ren?"</p><p>A companion caught up, seeing Yuan Ren stop, thinking he'd had a change of heart and secretly rejoicing.</p><p>"I don't know why, but I find this lava displeasing!  I want to give it a whack!" Yuan Ren scratched his head, his eyes slightly unfocused, his intuition at play. The Zhu Yan tribe's battle instincts were far keener than ordinary people's.</p><p>Yuan Ren didn't bother investigating the reason; he flipped his hand, raising his purple-gold staff.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The staff pierced the water, smashing heavily into the lava.</p><p>The lava deeply indented, a long trench appearing on its surface, slow to close.</p><p>The secluded realm's restrictions were quite sturdy and weren't broken by the blow, but Yuan Ren felt relieved after venting his frustration. He put away his staff and continued flying forward, leaving his companions puzzled.</p><p>Not long after they left, three battered figures flew out of the lava.</p><p>"Ugh... that damn monkey!"</p><p>The man in green robes was covered in black smoke. Fortunately, his robe was of high quality; otherwise, he might have been burned to ashes.</p><p>Worried about exposing themselves and attracting trouble, they dared not activate the formation to resist. They could only endure the impact from the realm themselves, thankfully sustaining no injuries.</p><p>The man in black robes sighed, "Forget it, the Zhu Yan tribe are inherently capricious! Time is of the essence; we've wasted too much time here. We must hurry, or we'll only be able to make our move after they emerge."</p><p>"Let him live a little longer," the immortal child said coldly.</p><p>The next moment, the three disappeared.</p><p>...</p><p>The spiritual mist was thick; Qin Sang used his Heavenly Eye divine ability, only able to see about ten miles.</p><p>"I wonder if Yuan Ren has encountered the immortal child?"  Qin Sang thought.</p><p>If the immortal child was constantly watching him, he would surely lay an ambush. Whether this plan could deceive the other party, Qin Sang wasn't sure.</p><p>It wasn't about using Yuan Ren as a shield; he'd warned Yuan Ren beforehand, and the other party shouldn't dare attack him. Qin Sang's goal was to buy time to make some preparations.</p><p>The success of this plan was uncertain, and Qin Sang was prepared for it to be discovered.</p><p>The biggest variable now was how many helpers the immortal child could find besides Yuan Jian.</p><p>If the enemy was too strong, he wouldn't fight them head-on. He would immediately return and complain to Lord Hong Tian, claiming he wasn't shirking his duty, but was obstructed.</p><p>Otherwise, it would be a case of eliminating the root of the problem!</p><p>This move was undoubtedly risky; they had to be cautious.</p><p>"Qin Daoist choosing this route, is there a secluded realm we can utilize?"  Liuli saw through Qin Sang's plan, but didn't know the full picture.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, "Two topographic maps both record a special secluded realm that can be used. I hope that place hasn't been destroyed. If we can reach it smoothly, I can make preparations in advance, appear weak to the enemy, and lure them into a trap…"</p><p>As he spoke, Qin Sang paused, looking towards the front left.</p><p>A mountain peak emerged from the water, its slopes steep and sharp, like a knife cut.  The top lacked ordinary plants and was covered in aquatic plants that should live underwater.</p><p>The topographic map didn't record this mountain; it clearly had just emerged from the water.</p><p>"There's a living creature's aura on the peak!" Liuli said.</p><p>The two figures flashed and arrived at the summit, seeing a strange beast with a duckbill—a powerful ferocious beast, comparable to a Nascent Soul cultivator.</p><p>This beast was lying on a stone slab, fast asleep, oblivious to the approaching outsiders.</p><p>Qin Sang and Liuli exchanged glances, both solemn. It seemed Hong Yue's words were true.</p><p></p>
