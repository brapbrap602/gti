<h1>Chapter 1436: Gains and Losses</h1><p>Chapter 1436: Gains and Losses</p><p>The ice box rested in his palm.</p><p>Qin Sang, drawing on past experience, attempted to break the seal.</p><p>Within the cave, pale light erupted intermittently, the chill seeping in, frosting the walls.</p><p>The ice box vibrated repeatedly, yet showed no sign of opening.</p><p>After a long while, Qin Sang stopped, his brow furrowed as he stared at the ice box.</p><p>Unexpectedly, even with his spiritual sense manifested, he remained helpless against the seal. He had already tried every method he could think of.</p><p>Holding the ice box, Qin Sang sat motionless, his gaze distant, lost in thought.</p><p>His spiritual sense was comparable to that of a Grand Cultivator.</p><p>Even so, he couldn't open the ice box, and he had no clue why.  There were only two possibilities: either his spiritual sense wasn't strong enough, or a specific condition needed to be met.</p><p>Since even a Grand Cultivator couldn't open it, for the foreseeable future, Qin Sang could only store the ice box in his storage ring and pretend it didn't exist.</p><p>For a time, Qin Sang’s thoughts drifted, turning to the person in white who stole the ice box, and to the Wanmo Assembly.</p><p>Unless something unexpected happened, he would personally attend.</p><p>“The Hunmo Elder killed so many Xuan Tian Palace Nascent Soul cultivators, creating mortal enemies.  Will Xuan Tian Palace still participate in the Wanmo Assembly? As the largest event in the North Sea, the Wanmo Assembly is the biggest trading event for Nascent Soul cultivators. If the person in white is still alive, they might appear on Hunmo Island. If Xuan Tian Palace wants to find the traitor and recover the ice box, they would likely send people to secretly investigate. I wonder if they have a way to sense the ice box. Should I leave the ice box in the cave before going to Hunmo Island?”</p><p>A sudden inspiration struck Qin Sang.</p><p>He decided to do the opposite – take the ice box to Hunmo Island and probe Xuan Tian Palace!</p><p>This Hunmo Assembly was the perfect opportunity.</p><p>Xuan Tian Palace and the Hunmo Elder were sworn enemies.  They certainly wouldn't dare act recklessly on Hunmo Island, deep within demonic territory.</p><p>Furthermore, Gui Mu had mentioned that the Xuan Tian Palace Master's condition was not right, possibly recovering from an injury. With the Palace Master unable to act, it would be difficult for anyone else to stop Qin Sang.</p><p>There were only two possible outcomes.</p><p>If he wasn't discovered, it meant Xuan Tian Palace had no way to sense the ice box’s location, or his demonic fire seal could block their detection.</p><p>Then he would have nothing to worry about.</p><p>He could leave the ice box for study, or use it for other purposes; he could consider that later.</p><p>If Xuan Tian Palace located Qin Sang, it meant the demonic fire seal was ineffective.</p><p>He wouldn't have a better way to hide the ice box.</p><p>Even if he managed to conceal it for a while, as long as Xuan Tian Palace persistently searched, with their strength and vast power, they would eventually find him. Taking it back to Bei Chen Realm wasn't safe either. Once the Xuan Tian Palace Master recovered, they could cross the storm belt and come looking for him – even more trouble.</p><p>To make enemies with the most powerful force in the North Sea over an unopened ice box was unwise.</p><p>Qin Sang didn’t even know what was inside the box. It was likely a treasure related to ice-type cultivation, which might not even be useful to him.</p><p>If so, why not negotiate a deal with Xuan Tian Palace?</p><p>After all, Qin Sang didn't steal the ice box. As long as he showed this willingness, Xuan Tian Palace wouldn't want to offend a top expert, and would certainly welcome the opportunity.</p><p>Taking advantage of the Palace Master's weakness, Qin Sang could gain even more benefits.</p><p>‘Ding! Ding!’</p><p>Qin Sang tapped the ice box lightly with his fingers, carefully considering the matter. What could he get from Xuan Tian Palace?</p><p>First, undoubtedly, a sea chart to the Central Plains.</p><p>At the mention of the sea chart, Qin Sang was puzzled.</p><p>A sea chart wasn't a secret treasure. Given Gui Mu's strength, if she wanted to see it, she could simply ask, and Xuan Tian Palace wouldn't have any reason to hide it.</p><p>Could Gui Mu’s goal be something else?</p><p>Qin Sang nodded inwardly, believing it was highly likely. Unfortunately, Tan Hao knew very little about Gui Mu, otherwise he could use this to his advantage.</p><p>Second, the person in white's cultivation technique.</p><p>Qin Sang suspected the person in white was a rare spiritual cultivator and was very interested in this type of technique.</p><p>Third, Xuan Tian Palace had a long history and dominated a realm; its treasury must contain countless scriptures, perhaps with secret arts to break through the late Nascent Soul stage and even reach the Mahayana stage.</p><p>It all depended on the value of the ice box and how much he could get in return.</p><p>At the very least, some spirit pills and magic treasures – Xuan Tian Palace would certainly be able to provide them.</p><p>Rather than risk making countless enemies with an ice box he might never open, it was better to exchange it for things that would help his cultivation.</p><p>For a cultivator, the Dao was paramount!</p><p>Just as Qin Sang was weighing the pros and cons, he sensed the cave's restriction being triggered. Tan Hao was back.</p><p>Qin Sang put away the ice box, and took a look at the Sun God Tree.  He saw that the flames on the tree were gradually turning deep red. Once they condensed into a Sun God Bird, he could use it.</p><p>He tried to subdue the Nanming Li Fire using the *Fire Seed Golden Lotus*, but as expected, he failed.</p><p>Qin Sang put away his treasure and left the cave, calling for Tan Hao.</p><p>"Brother Qin, you've finally finished your seclusion!"</p><p>Tan Hao breathed a sigh of relief.  The Great Demon Assembly was approaching, and he'd been worried Qin Sang would miss it. He hadn't dared disturb his seclusion, and had been extremely anxious.</p><p>"The Great Demon Assembly is the talk of the land. Many cultivators have already set off. Brother Qin, have you decided what you'll do?"</p><p>"No rush."</p><p>Qin Sang smiled slightly. "Have you found out anything?"</p><p>Tan Hao nodded. He'd already recorded the information he'd gathered and handed Qin Sang a jade slip.</p><p>Qin Sang used his spiritual sense to quickly scan the less important details, focusing on the matter of the Huanglong Shi Palace appearing.</p><p>Below the Yuan Ying stage, Tan Hao had few equals.  He couldn't uncover all the secrets, but he’d managed to find out about 60-70% of it.</p><p>The matter was causing a great stir. It wasn’t just about the Huanglong Shi Palace’s appearance; it also involved a feud between the leading sect of the North Sea and the top expert of the Boundless Sea.</p><p>The Huanglong Shi Palace appeared in a sea area in the eastern Boundless Sea. Many people had suspected its location and searched countless times, but found nothing.</p><p>The Old Demon Hunmo was likely closely monitoring the area.  As soon as there were signs, he noticed it.</p><p>Four Xuan Tian Palace Yuan Ying cultivators, including an elder, discovered the Huanglong Shi Palace.  They were killed by the Old Demon Hunmo while trying to take the treasures.  Including Qi and Wang, the Old Demon Hunmo slaughtered several Yuan Ying cultivators in a short time.</p><p>There were also rumors that several other demons participated in the killings.</p><p>The Old Demon Hunmo and his accomplices dared to offend Xuan Tian Palace, so they must have obtained great benefits.</p><p>The Cold Bone Demon Hand on the list likely came from the Huanglong Shi Palace.  Huanglong Shi had once discovered the secret realm of the ancient demonic sect, Cold Bone Dao, and obtained its inheritance.  This was no secret in the Boundless Sea.</p><p>"It's said that there are even more Cold Bone Dao treasures at the Great Demon Assembly. Why was the Old Demon so eager to act? Was he really in a hurry to exchange something?  Tan Hao couldn't find out about this, but Master Yinquan should know something.  Conveniently, I need to see him."</p><p>Qin Sang withdrew his spiritual sense, pondered for a moment, and left the cave with Tan Hao.</p><p>He took Tan Hao to a safe place near Demon Slayer Island, agreed on a way to contact each other, and then changed direction, heading to Pearl Island alone.</p>
