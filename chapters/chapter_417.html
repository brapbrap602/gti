Chapter 410: Pill Formation


Yun Youzi departed hastily.


Qin Sang remained in Qingyang Market for half a month, then altered her original plans. Instead of going to the Ancient Immortal Battlefield, she returned to her sect, Shao Hua Mountain.


Several more message talismans had arrived at the Hui Long Pavilion.


Qin Sang retrieved them and examined each one.  Upon seeing one, her expression shifted slightly, and she soared towards the mountain on her flying sword.


Shao Hua Mountain, the Headmaster's Peak.


The peak was originally overseen by Master Yu.


After discovering the Tianxing League's suspicious activities, Qi Yuanshou was urgently summoned back to the mountain and had been residing on the Headmaster's Peak.


A streak of light pierced the sky, arriving before the Headmaster's Peak.


This time, Qin Sang was exceedingly cautious.  Her flying sword landed at the foot of the peak. She then took out a jade box, holding it in her palm, and walked up the mountain, her steps brisk, until she reached the Headmaster's Hall.


A tall, handsome young man stood before the Headmaster's Hall. Judging by his cultivation, he had recently broken through to the Foundation Establishment stage.


Not only did the young man look young, but he also appeared to be quite young in age, indicating exceptional talent.


Qin Sang hadn't been back to the sect for a long time and didn't recognize these rising stars. Since this person was guarding the Headmaster's Hall, he was not to be underestimated.  She bowed politely, saying, "Greetings, fellow disciple. I am Qin Sang. I wish to see Master Qi.  Would you kindly inform him?"


"You are Senior Brother Qin?"


The young man seemed to know Qin Sang. A smile immediately spread across his face as he approached and returned her bow.  "Gao Yang greets Senior Brother Qin. Master often speaks highly of Senior Brother Qin, Senior Brother Yu Yangzi, and Senior Brother Mu, praising you all greatly. I have long admired you and am thrilled to finally meet Senior Brother Qin!"


"Not at all! Not at all!"


Qin Sang curiously asked, "Junior Brother Gao, is your master Master Qi?"


Gao Yang nodded, a look of realization dawning on his face. He explained, "Senior Brother Qin has been traveling outside the sect for some time and may not know. When Master achieved Golden Core, I also happened to break through to the Foundation Establishment stage, and he took me as his disciple. This allowed me to stay by Master's side, listening to his teachings and assisting him."


Qin Sang showed an envious expression. "Junior Brother Gao, to be chosen as a disciple by Master Qi is truly fortunate! When Master Qi was stationed at Xuanlu Pass, Senior Brother Mu and I received much care from him. If you ever encounter any difficulties, Junior Brother Gao, please tell me. Although my cultivation is not high, I will do my utmost to help."


Gao Yang was delighted. "Thank you, Senior Brother Qin!"


A warm smile appeared on Qin Sang's face, and she engaged in a cordial conversation with Gao Yang.


Among the message talismans from Hui Long Pavilion was one bearing good news: Qi Yuanshou had successfully formed his Golden Core a month prior, becoming a Golden Core cultivator.


Qin Sang's first visit to Xuanlu Pass was thirty years ago.  Even then, Qi Yuanshou was a Nascent Golden Core expert, already stuck at a bottleneck for a considerable time.


It's common for cultivators to remain stuck at the Nascent Golden Core stage their entire lives.


For thirty years, Qi Yuanshou had been unable to break through.


Unexpectedly, after being recalled to the sect to handle the more complex sect affairs, Qi Yuanshou had made a breakthrough.


Senior Brother Qi had transformed into Master Qi.


Qin Sang hadn't heard the news before leaving, and even Senior Brother Wen, who oversaw Daoist Peak, was unaware.


Before forming a Golden Core, cultivators usually need to enter seclusion for meditation and self-cultivation, often for over a decade or even several decades.  Qi Yuanshou, however, not only didn't enter seclusion, but also continuously handled various matters.  When the opportunity arose, he immediately broke through.


It was truly enviable.


Qin Sang was away and missed Qi Yuanshou's Golden Core celebration.  This return to the sect provided an opportunity to personally offer her congratulations and present a gift!


"Senior Brother Qin, Master is currently in seclusion, and it's unknown when he will emerge.  I will inform and relay your message when Master leaves seclusion. However, Master does not accept gifts, so please keep yours."


Seeing Qin Sang's displeased expression, Gao Yang quickly explained for fear of misunderstanding, "Senior Brother, you must understand; Master does not accept gifts from any senior brothers or senior uncles."


Qin Sang was surprised. "Is this true?"


Gao Yang's expression was serious. "Absolutely true! I wouldn't dare deceive Senior Brother Qin!"


"Since it is Master Qi's rule, it certainly cannot be broken. I was presumptuous."


Qin Sang had to put away the jade box.


Inside the jade box was a寒金矿母 (Hanjin ore mother), which Qin Sang hadn't yet refined, but it was certainly sufficient as a congratulatory gift.


As Qin Sang put away the jade box, she took out another item from her storage pouch—a bronze ring.


This top-grade magical artifact was a relic from the person who pursued Tan Hao at Yinshan Pass.  It was of excellent quality but had somewhat ordinary functions.  Qin Sang had kept it in her storage pouch, unused for the time being.


"Junior Brother Gao, although we have only just met, we seem to get along well.


"This artifact complements your cultivation technique perfectly, making it ideal for you…"

Gao Yang seemed to like the artifact very much, but he hesitated to accept it, repeatedly refusing.

Qin Sang urged him.

Gao Yang, still young and inexperienced, struggled to refuse.

Unexpectedly, as the two were exchanging words, a laugh echoed from the main hall.  "Gao Yang, don't refuse your senior brother's kindness. Accept the gift, and bring your senior brother in," said Qi Yuanshou.

"Yes, Master!"

Gao Yang quickly put away the bronze ring, bowed deeply towards the main hall, then turned to Qin Sang and said, "Thank you, Senior Brother Qin! Senior Brother Qin, please come with me."

Despite giving away a top-tier artifact, Qin Sang was very pleased.

Following Gao Yang into the Headmaster's hall, he saw Qi Yuanshou just emerging from his secluded chamber.

"Greetings, Master Uncle Qi! Congratulations on achieving Golden Core, a further step towards the Dao!"

Following the rules of Shaohua Mountain, Qin Sang respectfully bowed to Qi Yuanshou.

"A mere Golden Core, how can I speak of the Dao?"

Qi Yuanshou chuckled, gesturing towards a table. "Qin Sang, we've known each other for years; no need for formalities. Please, sit."

"Thank you, Master Uncle."

Qin Sang sat down on half a chair, offering tea.  He didn't dare use his spiritual sense to probe Qi Yuanshou, but sitting before him, he could feel the immense power emanating from him, like a towering mountain.

Before Qin Sang could speak, Qi Yuanshou got straight to the point. "Qin Sang, I've learned about you. Since you've chosen to cultivate the 'Chapter of Soul Cultivation and Swordsmanship,' embracing the path of killing, you'll inevitably need to venture out to hone your skills.

"The sect has chosen a group of disciples to be stationed at the Yun Cang Great Marsh to guard the mines, medicinal gardens, and other important areas, and patrol various locations. The rewards are quite substantial.

"However, the Skywalk Alliance is restless, but it's not yet a state of panic. Even joining the patrols, you'll likely encounter few opponents. But being stationed in those places, you can't leave at will. Others might find this appealing, but it would greatly hinder your cultivation.

"Therefore, your name was originally on the list, but I took the liberty of removing it. I plan to recall you to the mountain and send you to the battlefield once the true war begins, to temper yourself.

"Since you're back, I wanted to ask for your opinion."

Seeing that Qi Yuanshou didn't offer to take him as a disciple, yet his words carried an undercurrent of protection, Qin Sang felt a deep sense of gratitude.  The kindness shown in the past had finally borne fruit!
