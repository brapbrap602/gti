<h1>Chapter 1961 Turmoil in the Kingdom</h1><p>“Chirp… Chirp…”</p><p>Xiao Wu looked down at the white fox in her arms.</p><p>She released her aura, and the white fox clearly recognized her.</p><p>It was the little fox she had raised during her time at the ruins of the Thunderclap Sect.</p><p>For fifteen years, Qin Sang had been mostly in secluded cultivation, comprehending the Thunder Altar. Both Zhu Que and Luo Hou were somewhat afraid of her, and on ordinary days, only the small beasts released into the mountains by the spirit formations kept her company.</p><p>Among them, the one who accompanied her the longest and was the most intelligent was this little fox.</p><p>Before parting, Qin Sang had asked if she wanted to take the little fox with her, but Xiao Wu at that time refused.  She hadn't expected to be reunited under these circumstances.</p><p>The woman and the fox gazed at each other.</p><p>The little fox's eyes were full of joy, appearing even more spirited than before.</p><p>Xiao Wu extended her hand and gently stroked the little fox's head.</p><p>“Squeak!”</p><p>The little fox cried out, narrowing its eyes, looking as comfortable and content as ever.</p><p>The mountain wind rustled through the trees.</p><p>The gentle breeze was warm, sunlight bathed her skin, and the whisper of the wind was in her ears.</p><p>It was as if she had returned to the old days.</p><p>Xiao Wu's expression gradually softened. She looked around, sensed her surroundings, and realized she had flown out of the Yan Kingdom without knowing it, a strange land now lay beneath her.</p><p>Where should she go from here?</p><p>After a moment of silence, Xiao Wu had a destination—the Yan Kingdom's capital city, the Jade Waist Lake, and the Green Ram Tea House.</p><p>As for the questions in her heart, there were no answers for the time being, but there was no need to be anxious. Perhaps she could find an opportunity in the days to come to unravel all her doubts.</p><p>White clouds drifted leisurely.</p><p>Xiao Wu traveled on the clouds, holding the white fox in her arms.</p><p>From time to time, a fox's cry echoed from the clouds, as if recounting its experiences over the years.</p><p>When she returned to the Green Ram Tea House, the Qin family's servants were waiting there and immediately rushed back to the mansion.</p><p>Not long after, Yu Lang hurried over.</p><p>Learning the truth, Yu Lang's last shred of hope was shattered.</p><p>The Master, devoted to the people and pouring his heart and soul into his work, might have condensed his soul into spiritual light after death, stepping onto the path of divinity.</p><p>But on the battlefield, unless immediately guided after death, a fragile soul could not withstand the soaring blood energy and baleful aura. It would either be scattered on the spot or be corrupted into a malicious ghost.</p><p>Xiao Wu handed Chen Zhenqing's final letter to Yu Lang.  The short eight characters, Yu Lang read them for a long time, finally putting them away carefully. He stood up and said, "Senior Sister, I'll be going now."</p><p>"Alright," Xiao Wu rose to see him off. She sealed her own and the white fox's cultivation, returning to being mortals once more.</p><p>Walking out of the tea house, Yu Lang paused, looked towards the Imperial Palace, and said in a deep voice, "I will make the Yan Kingdom far stronger than the Great Liang, and defeat them decisively on the battlefield, to honor the Master!"</p><p>The urgent report reached the capital, shaking the court and the common people.</p><p>At the same time, various factions within the capital were also stirring.</p><p>The Great Liang's invasion, the timing so coincidental, could not help but arouse suspicion.</p><p>At this moment, Yu Lang and the Crown Prince's faction had already sensed something amiss. A storm was brewing, and some matters might soon come to light.</p><p>Yu Lang tightened his robes, took a deep breath, and disappeared into the darkness.</p><p>…</p><p>From that day on, the patrons of the Green Ram Tea House noticed a lazy white fox that had appeared from somewhere.  Sometimes it lay on the proprietress's lap, sometimes on the counter, always by her side. It was lazy all day, ignoring the customers' attempts to play with it, casting disdainful glances at them.</p><p>The customers, however, were amused by this, simply because the white fox was so intelligent and endearing.</p><p>However, the customers soon had no time to pay attention to a white fox.</p><p>News of the Great Liang invasion and the crisis at the border reached the capital, causing widespread panic.</p><p>In a short period, the Yan Kingdom lost eight prefectures of Deer Province. The Great Liang army advanced rapidly, and the Yan Kingdom's defenders retreated repeatedly.  Almost all of Deer Province fell, and the surrounding provinces were in constant fear, frequently sending urgent requests for reinforcements. The situation worsened day by day.</p><p>…</p><p>“And at this very moment, the Emperor's illness has worsened. He's neglecting court affairs, and memorials submitted to him vanish without a trace, left unread.”</p><p>Despite his busy schedule, Yu Lang returned to the tea house and, as before, confided in Xiao Wu without reservation about the treacherous situation and his plans.</p><p>“The Yan Kingdom is beset by internal and external troubles. The Crown Prince lacks prestige, the other princes harbor their own ambitions, the officials are hesitant, and the court is in endless debate, delaying the war effort!”</p><p>Yu Lang sighed, his voice tinged with fatigue.</p><p>He was a cultivator, full of energy, yet even at the center of the power struggle, he felt a sense of helplessness.</p><p>…</p><p>“Beyond the Great Liang, other kingdoms are also beginning to stir…”</p><p>“Finally, they’ve decided to deploy troops, but unfortunately, I can't personally lead the army eastward!”</p><p>…</p><p>“I’ve found some clues. As expected, among the princes, there must be someone colluding with the Great Liang, working from within! Taking advantage of the Yan Kingdom's internal and external struggles to usurp the throne!”</p><p>Yu Lang's tone became colder.</p><p>“There's been a change in the Imperial Palace. The Imperial Guards under Tao Teng were summoned into the palace at night.  They barely managed to send out the message.”</p><p>…</p><p>One ordinary morning.</p><p>Suddenly, many armored soldiers appeared on the streets of the capital, hurrying back and forth.  The clatter of their armor echoed through the streets.</p><p>Ordinary citizens sensed the impending storm and closed their doors and windows.</p><p>All the undercurrents, on this day, suddenly erupted!</p><p>It was later rumored that.</p><p>That night, firelight blazed from the Imperial Palace, burning throughout the night.</p><p>Fires lit up throughout the capital, shouts of killing shook the heavens, countless mansions were burned and razed, and many families vanished overnight.</p><p>The capital's gates were tightly shut, crossbow units at the ready, aimed outwards.</p><p>At some point, a large army had appeared outside the city, and the armor worn by the soldiers was almost identical to that of the city's defenders.</p><p>A great battle was imminent.</p><p>Fellow citizens of the Yan Kingdom, now facing each other as enemies.</p><p>…</p><p>The next day.</p><p>At dawn.</p><p>The capital, chaotic for a night, returned to calm.</p><p>Yu Lang, covered in blood, arrived at the Green Ram Tea House.</p><p>Outside the tea house, he removed his armor, jumped into Jade Waist Lake, washed away the blood, changed into ordinary clothes, and transformed back into the elegant gentleman he usually was.</p><p>Xiao Wu, holding the little fox, came downstairs from the second floor.</p><p>"Did you succeed?"</p><p>"We succeeded!"</p><p>Yu Lang affirmed, his expression not one of excitement, but rather one of relief.</p><p>He had descended the mountain to experience the world, traveling for one year, studying for three, and serving as an official for eleven years after passing the imperial examinations. He dared not relax, planning every step meticulously, and finally, this day had arrived!</p><p>He had almost grown accustomed to the life of a mortal. Only when he met with his Senior Sister did he recall the past, reminding himself of his true identity and origins.</p><p>"Unfortunately, the Third Prince escaped. We miscalculated slightly. He was the mastermind behind the collusion with the Great Liang. The Second Prince was used without knowing it, truly pathetic!"</p><p>Yu Lang took a sip of tea and shook his head with a sigh.</p><p>"The late Emperor was wise and had made preparations beforehand. The Emperor's ascension to the throne was smoother than expected.  Because of this, the Third Prince, seeing the situation turn unfavorable, decisively retreated. Many of his forces haven't surfaced yet and he certainly won't give up.</p><p>"However, the Emperor's succession is legitimate and has the support of the people. Even if the Third Prince spreads rumors and sows discord, he can't create too much chaos. I'm just afraid he'll continue to collude with the Great Liang Kingdom, plotting treachery, ultimately harming the common people.</p><p>"The Yan Kingdom now faces internal and external troubles. Tao Teng and I have discussed, planning to have one of us remain in the capital and the other go out to quell the rebellion."</p><p>…</p><p>"Unacceptable!"</p><p>In the Imperial Study, the new Emperor flatly refused.</p><p>"I know you are both skilled in literary and martial arts, but the battlefield is a dangerous place.  You should remain in the court, strategizing! Leading troops to quell the rebellion and expel foreign enemies is the task of Duke Yuan and others."</p><p>As expected, not long after the Third Prince escaped the city, he raised the banner of rebellion in Ying Province, which bordered the Great Liang Kingdom just like Deer Province, declaring himself Emperor. He claimed the false Emperor had treacherous ambitions, imprisoned the former Emperor, forged the imperial edict, and illegitimately seized the throne.</p><p>In addition to the Third Prince, several other escaped princes responded in various provinces. For a time, they formed a considerable force, causing unrest within the Yan Kingdom.</p><p>Coincidentally, the Great Liang army invaded Ying Province at this time, but suddenly halted their advance, holding their position. They didn't act like enemies, but rather as if they were bolstering the Third Prince's prestige.</p><p>After the court session, Tao Teng and Yu Lang were summoned to the Imperial Study again to discuss the suppression of the rebellion.</p><p>Tao Teng stepped forward and said, "A good minister dismounts to become a chancellor and mounts to become a general! The Number One Scholar is a reincarnation of the Wenqu Star, possessing unparalleled prestige among scholars. When the people see the Number One Scholar appear on the battlefield, they will know what is legitimate and what is a rebellious monster.  As the saying goes, 'A just cause enjoys abundant support,' and we will surely sweep away the rebels with ease."</p><p>"I am willing to share Your Majesty's worries and contribute my meager strength," Yu Lang added.</p><p>The Emperor paced for a few steps and sighed, "Minister Qin, you must be careful! The two of you are the pillars of the nation, my wings.  The loss of either one is a loss to the Yan Kingdom, a loss to me!"</p><p>Saying this, the Emperor picked up a roll of silk from his desk and said, "Minister Chen sacrificed himself for the country, and I have always kept him in my heart. I have decided to posthumously confer upon him the title of Marquis of Loyalty and Righteousness, a hereditary title.  What are your thoughts?"</p><p>The two were overjoyed, "Thank you, Your Majesty!"</p><p>…</p><p>Inside the command tent.</p><p>Yu Lang, clad in armor, sat upright and steady, reviewing the secret reports and letters before him.</p><p>Several people stood below him, all strong, capable, and astute individuals.</p><p>One of them said indignantly, "The letter urging surrender has been delivered into the city, but the rebel commander burned it on the spot and dared to openly insult us! This person is stubbornly resisting, ignorant of the consequences. When will we attack the city, General? Please give us your instructions!"</p><p>Yu Lang listened to his subordinate's report, a flicker of doubt in his eyes.</p><p>He hadn't gone directly to Ying Province. The Emperor had ordered him to suppress the rebellion elsewhere.</p><p>Unlike Ying Province, which had the Great Liang as a powerful ally, other places only had conscripted local troops and hastily assembled young men, lacking even complete armor.</p><p>He led the Imperial Guards here, and wherever the army went, it should have swept through the enemy like autumn wind sweeping fallen leaves, with enemy commanders surrendering at the mere sight of them.</p><p>The reality was quite different from what he had imagined.</p><p>He personally led one army to attack Youyang Prefecture ahead, while two other deputy generals each led another army. The three armies advanced simultaneously, yet they all encountered fierce resistance.</p><p>Rebelling was a heinous crime!</p><p>Surrendering now would mean a pardon.  Unexpectedly, the defenders of all three cities fought to the death.</p><p>The princes they followed had no chance of resisting the Imperial Guards' assault unless the Third Prince led reinforcements from Ying Province.  Otherwise, defeat was inevitable.</p><p>Suddenly, a thought stirred within Yu Lang.</p><p>An ordinary person might not have thought of it, but he himself was a cultivator who had descended the mountain to experience the mortal world.  Encountering such an obviously illogical situation, he couldn't help but think deeper.</p><p>What power could make the rebels not even fear death?</p><p>He thought of Tao Teng and himself.</p><p>The City God of the Yan Kingdom's capital could allow them to enter the mortal world, could he have allowed other cultivators in, disguised as mortals just like them? At the time, Yu Lang had felt that the City God was too casual.</p><p>With the jade pendant bestowed by the City God, unless they willingly revealed themselves, even Brother Shi couldn't tell whether they were cultivators or mortals.</p><p>During the struggle for the throne, Yu Lang hadn't noticed any soldiers who were obviously cultivators.</p><p>Presumably, within the Imperial Capital, under the City God's watchful eye, no one dared to act rashly.</p><p>Away from the capital, mundane methods were ineffective, and finally, someone couldn't hold back, wishing for chaos in the world?</p><p>Yu Lang frowned.  Unfortunately, his Senior Sister had sealed her cultivation, and Brother Shi claimed to have encountered a bottleneck and had to enter secluded cultivation for a period.</p><p>Otherwise, if someone within the rebel army revealed their identity as a cultivator, one investigation would reveal the truth.</p><p>"Reporting to General, a secret report from Ying Province: the pseudo-Emperor's momentum has suddenly weakened, and he has chosen to defend the city.  The Great Liang army within our Yan Kingdom's territory has also become hesitant. The Great Liang not only hasn't sent reinforcements, but it seems to be secretly withdrawing troops, as if something has happened within their country…"</p><p>Another secret letter arrived.</p><p>Yu Lang looked at the letter on his desk.</p><p>This was within his expectations.</p><p>The ruler of the Great Liang was even older than the late Emperor of the Yan Kingdom. It was time for the drama of succession to unfold.</p><p>The Emperor was planning to give them a taste of their own medicine.</p><p>Yu Lang had previously lamented that the ruler of the Great Liang was cunning and had struck first, sending an army to disrupt the Yan Kingdom so that the Great Liang could focus on resolving its internal conflicts without the Yan Kingdom taking advantage of the situation.</p><p>The sudden thought led Yu Lang to think more and more, until finally, he nearly broke out in a cold sweat.</p><p>Was this struggle for succession, affecting two kingdoms, really as simple as it appeared on the surface?</p><p>How many cultivators were secretly involved, and what were their goals? Were they like him and Tao Teng, seeking to fulfill their ambitions, or playing games in the mortal world, or did they have other motives?</p><p>What was the purpose of the Yan Kingdom's ghosts and gods?</p><p>And Tao Teng's master, whom he had never had the opportunity to visit, what was his background?</p><p>Yu Lang felt inexplicably anxious. He stood up and paced back and forth in the tent.</p><p>It was as if an invisible hand was clenching him, Tao Teng, the Emperor, the officials, the common people, the entire Yan Kingdom, in its grasp!</p><p>Yu Lang subconsciously opened his mouth.</p><p>There was always a dark cloud in the sky, like the roof of the command tent, pressing down, lower and lower, making him feel suffocated.</p><p>This dark cloud was the cultivation world!</p><p>…</p><p>Turmoil in the mortal world.</p><p>The cultivation world was also restless.</p><p>Southwest of the Yan Kingdom, the mountains were treacherous and the ravines deep.</p><p>Within the deep mountains and old forests, mist lingered, as if white clouds enveloped the mountain peaks, stretching endlessly.  The mist wouldn't dissipate until noon each day, only to gather again in the afternoon.</p><p>Within the mist, several figures flew at a leisurely pace.</p><p>Beneath their feet was a bamboo leaf-shaped magical treasure.  The treasure emitted a faint green light, enveloping them, not leaking the slightest fluctuation as they flew.</p><p>Despite the protection of the magical treasure, they flew at a very low altitude, almost skimming the treetops.</p><p>Standing at the forefront of the magical treasure, controlling it, was the head of the Silver Clan, Yin Heqian.</p><p>Those behind him were also Silver Clan experts. Yin Qiao'er's cultivation was insufficient, so she hadn't come this time, but her aunt, Nian Hui, was among them.</p><p>――</p><p>――</p><p>I've been a bit muddled these past few days. I suddenly woke up this morning and quickly crawled out of bed to write this.</p><p>(End of Chapter)</p>
