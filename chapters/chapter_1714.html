<h1>Chapter 1705: Ominous Shadow</h1><p>Within his dantian.</p><p>The Skyeye Butterfly enveloped itself with its wings, emitting a faint, shimmering light, like a cocoon of light, perfectly still.</p><p>Qin Sang cleared out items such as the Earth-Slaying Sword and the Poison Pearl.</p><p>Only his Nascent Soul and the Skyeye Butterfly remained within his dantian.</p><p>The Nascent Soul extended its arms, and slender threads of light stretched from its fingertips, merging into the shimmering glow.</p><p>Qin Sang's mind connected with the Skyeye Butterfly, sensing the thoughts of his natal insect-gu. Simultaneously, he multitasked, forming various hand seals from the *Pangu True Scripture*.</p><p>In Qin Sang's view, the witchcraft and incantations within the *Pangu True Scripture* were incredibly bizarre. He had studied them numerous times before, yet still felt a certain awkwardness in their execution.</p><p>This was normal, as the scripture did not originate from human cultivation lineage. Just as Ghost Mother had warned, Qin Sang lacked the bloodline of the Witch Tribe. As his cultivation advanced, he needed to be wary of backlash from the gu.</p><p>However, the Skyeye Butterfly showed no signs of turning on its master.</p><p>Sensing the unprecedented changes in its master, and even the connection between them fluctuating between blurry and clear, the Skyeye Butterfly conveyed a sense of unease.</p><p>Qin Sang felt no ulterior motives in this unease, only closeness and attachment.</p><p>Continuously soothing the Skyeye Butterfly, Qin Sang accelerated his spellcasting.</p><p>The process of refining his natal insect-gu using the *Pangu True Scripture* was fraught with peril. However, due to the Skyeye Butterfly's unreserved reliance on him, everything remained under Qin Sang's control.</p><p>Silence reigned within the cave dwelling.</p><p>Qin Sang sat in meditation for an unknown duration, his body emitting a burning radiance, similar to the Skyeye Butterfly. The radiance automatically converged towards his dantian.</p><p>At this moment, he appeared to be embracing a sphere of light. His and the Skyeye Butterfly's vital energies intertwined within the sphere, giving birth to myriad evolving scenes. Sometimes vast, ancient mountains appeared, other times they transformed into oceans and mulberry fields, exuding an aura of antiquity.</p><p>Amidst these various visions, only the image of a butterfly remained constant. It flew ceaselessly, traversing mountains and valleys, rivers and lakes, seemingly tireless, its destination unknown.</p><p>Initially, the butterfly's image was very blurry.</p><p>As a rumbling sound echoed from within Qin Sang, his blood and Qi surged like thunder. Threads of blood extended into the illusory realm, making contact with the butterfly's image. The image grew increasingly clear, identical in form to the Skyeye Butterfly, as if a true physical form had condensed.</p><p>With the butterfly's image solidified, Qin Sang's throat trembled, and a deep, strange sound escaped his lips. The illusory realm abruptly dissipated, leaving only the butterfly's image. Its wings flapped once, and it plunged into Qin Sang's dantian.</p><p>Within the dantian.</p><p>The butterfly's image flew straight towards the Skyeye Butterfly.</p><p>The two spirit butterflies, identical in appearance, overlapped perfectly, merging into one.</p><p>The combined Skyeye Butterfly trembled, quickly regaining its composure. Its aura stabilized as it entered slumber.</p><p>Qin Sang kept his eyes closed, his mind focused on his dantian, sensing the changes between him and the Skyeye Butterfly.  The true inheritance of the Witch Tribe, passed down by Ghost Mother, was truly remarkable, its effects immediate.</p><p>The feeling of bloodline fusion between him and the Skyeye Butterfly became clearer. He felt an inexplicable, tighter connection between them, as if they were one. The foreseeable benefit was that if the Skyeye Butterfly encountered problems or bottlenecks in its cultivation, he could merge his mind with it, providing assistance in finding opportunities, rather than being helpless and confused as before.</p><p>As his cultivation deepened, and he encountered elixirs and medicines beneficial to the Skyeye Butterfly, he would also have premonitions, eliminating the need for time-consuming trial and error.</p><p>These weren't even the greatest benefits. In the future, if the Skyeye Butterfly lagged behind him, he could fully utilize the blood refinement and secret medicine techniques from the scripture to rapidly enhance its cultivation.</p><p>"This is what a true natal insect-gu is like!"</p><p>Qin Sang sighed with emotion, having wasted too much time without the true method.</p><p>The Skyeye Butterfly slumbered within his dantian, adapting to the new changes.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't awaken the Skyeye Butterfly. He emerged from his meditative state with a contemplative expression. Glancing at the Poison Pearl floating before him, he suddenly recalled the Gu King.</p><p>The Gu King, bound by Ghost Mother's restrictions, was slumbering within the Spirit Beast Pouch.</p><p>Qin Sang, following Ghost Mother's guidance, refined the Poison Pearl anew. Although he had focused on cultivating the *Fire Seed Golden Lotus*, he hadn't neglected the pearl entirely. Over the decades, unconsciously guiding the Poison Pearl's self-transformation had yielded considerable results.</p><p>"After years of nurturing, the most troublesome foundation has more or less stabilized. From now on, the speed of my recovery will increase. While healing, I'll refine the Poison Pearl and devour the Gu King! Right, I also need to comprehend the crafting methods of the Taiji Immortal Platform and the Ice-Fire Tokens."</p><p>Qin Sang pondered his upcoming tasks.</p><p>His cultivation speed was already quite fast.  He could foresee that after his avatar delivered the Four Saints Spirit Gathering Formation, his cultivation would soar, leading him directly to the Nascent Soul bottleneck.</p><p>Unfortunately, the Spirit Rhino Immortal Fruit and the Unborn Devil Seal, both related to his breakthrough, required waiting for the right opportunity.  He didn't know when the monstrous beast would appear, and he couldn't rush it.</p><p>Before that, Qin Sang decided to take care of all the miscellaneous matters.</p><p>Next, Qin Sang retrieved the inheritance obtained by Elder Yanshan from the snowy plains tomb and carefully studied it.</p><p>The difficulty of crafting the Ice-Fire Tokens lay in the sheer quantity required and their considerable value. As long as he grasped the properties of the Ice Ritual Divine Disc and the Fire Rhinoceros Horn, the actual difficulty wasn't as high as the Taiji Immortal Platform.</p><p>After reading the crafting method for the Taiji Immortal Platform, Qin Sang sighed, rubbed his brow, and set it aside, pulling out the Wood Phase Sect's refining inheritance.</p><p>Time flew by.</p><p>Another three years passed.</p><p>During these three years, Qin Sang skimmed through the Wood Phase inheritance several times. His skill in refining hadn't improved much, but he had completed the refinement of the Poison Pearl.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>The slumbering Gu King was summoned.</p><p>Qin Sang looked at his right hand, his fingertips manipulating a longan-sized pearl, the newly refined Poison Pearl.  It felt soft to the touch, not yet a true solid object.</p><p>With a thought.</p><p>The Poison Pearl suddenly shone, and a beam of seven-colored light shot out, aiming at the empty space before Qin Sang. It appeared only slightly more solid than before, but it was fundamentally different from the poison-repelling halo.</p><p>This beam of light could not only transform into poison-repelling armor, resisting external toxins, but could also become a poisonous light!</p><p>Repelling poison, applying poison, all at will.</p><p>The poison within the Poison Pearl should be the result of the Fat Silkworm devouring and transforming various poisons over the years. If Qin Sang had nurtured it properly, the Fat Silkworm could have grasped the poisonous light much earlier and become a valuable asset.  Fortunately, it had finally met a capable master.</p><p>After a brief experiment, Qin Sang's gaze shifted to the Gu King. He tossed the Poison Pearl towards it. The pearl hovered above the Gu King, continuously emitting seven-colored light, enveloping it.</p><p>A force seemed to pull the Gu King slowly towards the Poison Pearl.</p><p>Before long, the light dissipated, and the Poison Pearl flew back to Qin Sang, slowly rotating. He could clearly see the Jade Armored Beetle within the pearl, seemingly sealed inside, having remained unconscious throughout the process.</p><p>A sword light shot from Qin Sang's brow. The Cloud Wanderer Sword hung upside down above the Poison Pearl. He repeated his previous technique, using pure sword intent to suppress it.</p><p>Simultaneously, dense, seven-colored threads of light appeared within the Poison Pearl, tentatively drifting towards the Gu King. However, they didn't directly touch the Gu King's body, instead first merging with the divine inscription seals on its body.</p><p>The divine inscription seals left by Ghost Mother exploited the Gu King's weaknesses while also providing Qin Sang with a clear direction.</p><p>Gradually, the divine inscriptions on the Gu King turned seven-colored. Despite Qin Sang's gentle approach, the Gu King seemed to sense the threat and nearly awakened several times.</p><p>Fortunately, with the Cloud Wanderer Sword's suppression, the process proceeded relatively smoothly.</p><p>"It's done!"</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes flickered as he beckoned the Poison Pearl into his palm.</p><p>Within the Poison Pearl, the Gu King was bound like a captive, enveloped by a net formed by layers of seven-colored light threads, all connected to the nodes of the divine inscriptions.</p><p>The Gu King's aura hadn't significantly weakened yet, as Qin Sang intended to boil the frog slowly.</p><p>The seven-colored threads were the Poison Pearl's tentacles, slowly draining the Gu King's power while it slumbered. The process was bound to be lengthy. Before the Gu King weakened, there was still a possibility of unforeseen circumstances, requiring constant vigilance with the Cloud Wanderer Sword.</p><p>He withdrew the Poison Pearl and the spirit sword into his body.</p><p>Qin Sang ceased paying close attention.</p><p>Shortly after, Qin Sang consumed a few more medicinal pills, finally healing his injuries. He then threw himself into cultivation with renewed vigor.</p><p>The monstrous beast still hadn't appeared.</p><p>For Qin Sang, this was naturally a good thing.</p><p>Previously, he had planned for his avatar to slip away quietly while the two races' Nascent Soul cultivators hunted the beast, not intending to involve his true body. Now that his true body was healed, he could make a move as well.</p><p>While cultivating, he would occasionally take out the Wood Phase inheritance and other true inheritances to review and ponder.</p><p>There was still no news from the outside world.</p><p>During breaks in his cultivation, Qin Sang once again contemplated the *Fire Seed Golden Lotus*.</p><p>After his divine sense breakthrough, further improvement would be difficult to achieve quickly. It would be more beneficial to focus on tempering his physical body. Therefore, before reaching the Nascent Soul realm, Qin Sang didn't plan to continue cultivating this technique.</p><p>However, the necessary preparations still needed to be made.</p><p>Qin Sang summoned the Fire Lotus and the Sun God Tree, attempting to refine the Southern Bright Li Fire.  Unfortunately, after multiple attempts, he failed completely. The Fire Lotus couldn't budge the Southern Bright Li Fire in the slightest!</p><p>This created a deadlock.</p><p>To what extent did he need to cultivate the *Fire Seed Golden Lotus* to affect the Southern Bright Li Fire? And without refining the Southern Bright Li Fire, how could he enhance the Fire Lotus?</p><p>With Qin Sang's current cultivation, the improvement brought by ordinary spiritual fire was negligible.</p><p>Even the Formless Immortal Sect's Fire Rhinoceros Island didn't have it, and it would be even harder to find a suitable spiritual fire elsewhere. He could only hope for the future ascension to the greater world.</p><p>"It's a pity that with the ascension of the Immortal Palace, the Seven Kills Palace in the Canghai Sea is most likely gone as well... Hmm?"</p><p>As Qin Sang reminisced, he suddenly remembered something.</p><p>Back when he was trapped in the Seven Kills Palace and mistaken for a demon by King Nine Phoenix, he had witnessed King Nine Phoenix use a broken long plume to break open the immortal restriction and strike into the inner palace. The plume moved like flowing fire, seemingly containing spiritual fire, similar to the Vermillion Bird's true feather.</p><p>There was also another plume, the Heavenly Phoenix Plume.</p><p>The Heavenly Phoenix Plume was brought into Leaning Heaven Peak by King Flood Dragon, who was killed while attempting to use it to escape. The Heavenly Phoenix Plume fell into the hands of the elder from the Four Saints Palace.</p><p>But the broken long plume hadn't reappeared and should still be in King Nine Phoenix's possession.</p><p>He didn't know the ultimate fate of King Nine Phoenix and the other demons, or whether the broken plume still existed.</p><p>Qin Sang tapped his finger on his knee, pondering this matter. Since he didn't know which was of higher quality, the broken plume or the Vermillion Bird's true feather, he wasn't sure if the Fire Lotus could refine it.</p><p>This matter wasn't urgent.</p><p>Putting aside his distracting thoughts, Qin Sang once again immersed himself in cultivation.</p><p>Spring passed, and autumn arrived.</p><p>Time slipped away quietly in his cultivation.</p><p>In this manner, another nearly twenty years passed peacefully.</p><p>Qin Sang would occasionally emerge from seclusion to check on the development of the Green Ram Temple. With the Nether Moon Guards managing affairs, there was little that required his personal attention.</p><p>The Northern Wasteland remained as it always was. There seemed to be undercurrents flowing amongst the various sects in the Middle Continent, but it had little to do with Qin Sang, so he didn't pay much attention.</p><p>His avatar remained in the Sweet Dew Zen Monastery, having befriended several eminent monks during this time and forming good relationships. Perhaps seeing Venerable Huiguang's regard for him, the monks didn't hold back when his avatar consulted them on matters.</p><p>His avatar would either browse the scriptures in the Sutra Depository, contemplate the Dao of Alchemy, or socialize with various experts, living quite comfortably.</p><p>Of course, he hadn't neglected his duties.</p><p>Several types of medicinal pills needed by the Skyeye Butterfly had been refined. The main ingredient for the Taiji Immortal Platform, obtained from Holy King Qinghu, was ready. The less valuable auxiliary ingredients were easy to acquire and had been prepared.</p><p>He had also collected a portion of the materials required for the Ice-Fire Tokens and had a general idea where to obtain the rest, planning to trade for them later.</p><p>As far as he knew, the monstrous beast hadn't appeared, and Holy King Qinghu remained in the Sweet Dew Zen Monastery.</p><p>Strangely, Mo Xingdao hadn't left either.  Like him, Mo Xingdao occupied a high-grade cave dwelling on the back mountain and had been cultivating in seclusion.</p><p>It seemed that this number one rogue cultivator of the Northern Wasteland was sincerely devoting himself to Buddhism.</p><p>His avatar had only met Mo Xingdao once, exchanging a few words before parting ways.</p><p>On this day.</p><p>His avatar was browsing Buddhist scriptures in the Sutra Depository, focusing on sections related to body refinement, when he suddenly sensed chaotic Qi fluctuations within the monastery.  He closed the book and walked out of the Sutra Depository to see monks rushing to and fro.</p><p>Venerable figures rarely seen now appeared one after another.</p><p>His avatar stopped a monk to inquire and learned that Abbot Xingji had summoned everyone. He then saw flickering lights from the direction of Small Fangcun Mountain and immediately guessed what was happening.</p><p>Without hesitation, he strode to the Mahavira Hall and, as expected, saw Venerable Huiguang and Holy King Qinghu, both present. Abbot Xingji was bowing and reporting something to them.</p><p>Mo Xingdao also stood beside them, his eyes fixed on his nose, his nose fixed on his heart.  It was unclear where he had placed his puppet.</p><p>Seeing his avatar enter, familiar venerable monks greeted him.</p><p>The two Nascent Soul cultivators also noticed him. Holy King Qinghu merely glanced at him, while Venerable Huiguang nodded with a smile.</p><p>His avatar returned their greetings and quickly walked to Mo Xingdao's side, asking directly, "Fellow Daoist Mo, has the monstrous beast appeared?"</p><p>Mo Xingdao replied with a hum, "The Storm Belt has sent a warning. Fellow Daoists patrolling the southeast have discovered a change. A monstrous beast is currently surging north from that direction. Judging by its course, it should pass by the Middle Continent. Fellow Daoists outside have already taken action, preparing to use bait to gradually guide the beast towards the north of the Middle Continent…"</p><p>His avatar nodded upon hearing this.</p><p>He had long known of the two Nascent Soul cultivators' plan to set traps in both the south and the north, while they themselves remained in the Middle Continent.</p><p>The two races joined forces, dividing their strength to defend and set bait in the Storm Belt. Based on the location where the monstrous beast appeared, they would decide whether to lure it south or north.</p><p>North was the most convenient option, as the Buddhist sect controlled an ancient teleportation formation on the edge of the Western Desert that led directly to the Northern Sea.</p><p>With a concrete plan in place, it was now time to gather experts from all sides for the beast hunt.</p><p>His avatar hurried back to his cave dwelling, sent a message to his true body, retrieved the necessary items, and upon emerging again, saw a black shadow appear above the Sweet Dew Zen Monastery – a flying ship.</p><p>Led by the two races' Nascent Soul cultivators, Buddhist experts filed into the flying ship.</p><p>Seeing his avatar board the ship, Holy King Qinghu's eyes flashed with surprise.</p><p>His avatar didn't seize the opportunity to leave; he still needed to see the monstrous beast with his own eyes to be at ease.</p><p>Within the Deer Wilderness.</p><p>Having learned of the situation, his true body emerged from his cave dwelling, glanced north, and with a flicker, vanished from the Deer Wilderness. He transformed into a bolt of lightning, streaking across the sky.</p><p>(End of Chapter)</p>
