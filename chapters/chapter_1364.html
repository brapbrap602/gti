<h1>Chapter 1356:  A Score Settled</h1><p>Qin Sang entered the mountain gate.</p><p>Tan Yi'en, having received word, hurried out from the main hall and bowed in greeting.  Behind him stood a large, composed man—Mu Yifeng.</p><p>Mu Yifeng, once carefree, disheveled, and unkempt, now possessed a far greater bearing, befitting the leader of a sect.</p><p>Old friends reunited.</p><p>Two hundred years apart.</p><p>Both Qin Sang and Mu Yifeng's eyes lit up.</p><p>Mu Yifeng's face was filled with joy, but a flicker of hesitation crossed his eyes. He opened his mouth, unsure how to address Qin Sang.</p><p>"Senior Brother Mu!"</p><p>Qin Sang appeared before them, using their old appellation from Shao Hua Mountain,  chiding, "When did you become a hermit? You made me wait so long!"</p><p>Mu Yifeng's expression softened, the hesitation vanishing. He grinned broadly, a hearty laugh escaping him as he nodded heavily. "Junior Brother Qin! Long time no see!"</p><p>Tan Yi'en called out "Uncle-Master" and then wisely withdrew.</p><p>Jing Yu and the white cat were resting elsewhere, not disturbing the two.</p><p>Qin Sang and Mu Yifeng entered the main hall arm in arm.</p><p>After a period of reminiscing, the awkwardness between them quickly dissipated. Recalling past events, they sighed with emotion.</p><p>"I never imagined that after all these years, Junior Brother would achieve such extraordinary accomplishments! I've been so anxious, wondering if you'd even recognize your old senior brother."</p><p>Mu Yifeng spoke with deep feeling.</p><p>His words came from the heart.</p><p>The authority of a Nascent Soul cultivator was inviolable.</p><p>Moreover, Qin Sang's strength was among the top tier of Nascent Soul cultivators in Bei Chen.</p><p>The gulf between these former brothers was now insurmountable.</p><p>"Without Senior Brother Mu, there would be no Qin Sang today."</p><p>Qin Sang spoke solemnly and earnestly. "No matter who I become, I will never forget Senior Brother's kindness at the Bronze Hall."</p><p>Mu Yifeng waved his hands repeatedly, refusing to take credit. "Junior Brother, haven't you forgotten? You saved my life at Yun Cang Great Marsh.  If I were to turn against my benefactor, how could I face the world?"</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head; his gratitude for Mu Yifeng remained undiminished.</p><p>Most people wouldn't dare defy a Nascent Soul ancestor, even if that ancestor was their benefactor.  Mu Yifeng not only destroyed his precious Nine Flames Divine Blade, but risked his own life as well.</p><p>"After returning, I wanted to see you, but your personality changed. You secluded yourself on Jingyue Peak, never appearing, and no one dared to intrude… What happened after I left?"</p><p>Qin Sang asked about Mu Yifeng's experiences.</p><p>Mu Yifeng did not hide anything from Qin Sang, laughing wryly. "Back then, I thought I'd covered my tracks perfectly. Now, I realize how naive I was. Such a small trick couldn't escape the ancestor's eyes! Luckily, Fairy Chenyan pleaded with the ancestor on my behalf and gave me healing pills, taking me away from Ziwei Palace. Later, she was allowed to establish a cave abode for me on Jingyue Peak, so the ancestor didn't exterminate me, an unfilial disciple…"</p><p>Mu Yifeng looked at Qin Sang ambiguously. "After leaving Ziwei Palace, Chenyan looked everywhere for you.  Unable to find you, everyone thought you had perished.  I never imagined you were hiding so well."</p><p>Mu Yifeng was unaware of the relationship between Qin Sang and Chenyan.</p><p>All signs pointed to a significant connection between the two.</p><p>Mu Yifeng had heard rumors of Qin Sang being used as a human furnace for foundation establishment, but the target was understood to be Master Ma Wu, who died on the battlefield shortly after the Three Realms War began.  He could not imagine connecting such a thing to the ethereal Fairy Chenyan.</p><p>Hearing this, Qin Sang frowned slightly.</p><p>Could Chenyan really have been swayed by Duke Dongyang and be cultivating that ridiculous *Stone Bridge Zen*?</p><p>"Did she mention why she was looking for me?" Qin Sang asked.</p><p>Times had changed.</p><p>Even if Chenyan had ulterior motives, he wasn't afraid.</p><p>Chenyan had only been a Nascent Soul cultivator for just over two hundred years. Even as a supremely talented Spirit Root cultivator, it was impossible for her to reach the late Nascent Soul stage in such a short time.</p><p>His senior sister Qingjun was a monster, a genius among geniuses.</p><p>Mu Yifeng chuckled. "Back then, what was my status? How could I presume? I benefited from misfortune. Not long after returning from Ziwei Palace, while healing, I had a breakthrough and unexpectedly formed a Golden Core.  Then I was summoned by Fairy Chenyan. She first inquired about Junior Brother, then gave me a treasure similar to the Nine Flames Divine Blade and guided my cultivation. Fairy Chenyan is aloof. From the time I entered Jingyue Peak until she left, I only saw her that once."</p><p>Mu Yifeng looked at Qin Sang askance.</p><p>His eyes seemed to say, "You two have nothing to do with each other.  He even repaid the debt he owed you."</p><p>Qin Sang was also somewhat confused, unable to fathom Chen Yan's attitude.</p><p>Of course, Qin Sang wasn't naive enough to think Chen Yan harbored any romantic feelings for her.</p><p>Could it be guilt over the innocent people involved?</p><p>"I remember during your Foundation Establishment stage, you broke through several bottlenecks after suffering serious injuries.  Unexpectedly, it's the same with your Golden Core advancement.  I've met so many cultivators, and Senior Brother Mu, you're truly unique. No wonder you've reached the late Golden Core stage."</p><p>Qin Sang recalled her own difficult path to Golden Core, feeling quite envious.</p><p>Mu Yifeng put away his teasing expression and said solemnly, "I only recently broke through to the late Golden Core stage.  With my talent, if I hadn't had a stroke of luck, it would have taken another few decades. This breakthrough was thanks to the spirit pill given by the Grand Master."</p><p>"Master Dongyang?"</p><p>Qin Sang nodded slightly, not surprised.</p><p>The head of a sect like Shao Hua Mountain needs at least late Golden Core cultivation to maintain control.</p><p>While spirit pills that aid Golden Core cultivators in minor breakthroughs are still precious, they're easier to obtain than those for Nascent Soul breakthroughs. Shao Hua Mountain certainly wouldn't lack them.</p><p>Mu Yifeng hesitated.  "After Fairy Chen Yan left, I knew the Grand Master didn't favor me, so I stayed hidden on Jingyue Peak for many years. Six months ago, Che Yutao failed his Nascent Soul tribulation and died.  The Grand Master found me, explained the situation, and after careful consideration, I agreed."</p><p>He paused, looking directly into Qin Sang's eyes.  "Regardless, everything I have today is thanks to Shao Hua Mountain. Even after that incident, the sect never cut off my cultivation resources.  I can't forget the sect's kindness, and I can't just stand by and watch Shao Hua Mountain decline!"</p><p>"Senior Brother Mu, rest assured. The feud is only between Master Dongyang and me," Qin Sang, understanding his concerns, reassured him.</p><p>"I didn't misjudge you!"</p><p>Mu Yifeng relaxed, his face full of relief. "The Grand Master has a few words, which should be for Junior Brother Qin. From now on, he will never set foot in Shao Hua Mountain again, and I will have the final say on all matters concerning the mountain!"</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes narrowed slightly.</p><p>She hadn't expected Master Dongyang to be so decisive, relinquishing the sect he'd devoted his life to so readily.</p><p>But she had to admit, it was a brilliant decision, and the best for Shao Hua Mountain.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't ask Mu Yifeng to refuse.</p><p>"If Master Dongyang keeps his word and doesn't bother me, I won't bother him either!"</p>
