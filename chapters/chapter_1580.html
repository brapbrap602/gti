<h1>Chapter 1571: The Unseen Immortal Sect</h1><p>Chapter 1571: The Unseen Immortal Sect</p><p>After a chase, the approximate location of the snow fox's lair could be determined.  It wasn't in the center of the snowfield, but in the southwest.</p><p>During the pursuit, Qin Sang and Yan Shan, taking turns, unleashed their attacks, causing severe damage to the terrain; it was completely ravaged.</p><p>The snow fox showed no signs of increasing its speed. It relied entirely on its ability to teleport, but the distance of each teleport was limited, and it couldn't shake off its pursuers.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>…</p><p>The two relentlessly smashed large holes into the stone walls between the ravines.  The thick snow cover concealed the commotion below; there was no noticeable shaking on the surface of the snowfield. The ice spirits continued to play carefree, oblivious to everything.</p><p>However, during their reckless assault, they failed to notice something unusual about some of the ice spirits.  These spirits were few in number but widely dispersed, almost throughout the snowfield.</p><p>They weren't noticeably different from normal ice spirits, except their eyes lacked the usual vivacity, and their behavior was less lively. They were like disembodied spirits, wandering aimlessly across the snowfield.  Even if someone saw them, it would be difficult to notice the difference.</p><p>Previously, to avoid alarming the snow fox, Qin Sang and Yan Shan had been careful to conceal their presence since entering the snowfield, and these peculiar ice spirits hadn't detected them. But once they began their attack and pursuit, concealment was neither possible nor necessary.</p><p>The moment they were exposed, all the unusual ice spirits froze.  As if receiving a command, regardless of their location, they turned simultaneously, staring intently at the direction of Qin Sang and Yan Shan. Even if they were facing a sheer rock face.</p><p>The scene was extremely strange, though unfortunately unseen by others.</p><p>After a brief stillness, the unusual ice spirits moved simultaneously, rushing towards that direction.</p><p>…</p><p>Outside the snowfield, within the area enveloped by the snowstorm, dark clouds obscured the sky, even thicker than the snow layer below.  Above the clouds, however, the night was not gloomy; the moonlight was like water, spilling onto the cloud's surface, as if falling onto an endless curtain.</p><p>Among the clouds, the moonlight was particularly bright in one area. To the naked eye, this area was only slightly brighter, otherwise indistinguishable from its surroundings. The scenery was monotonous, with the clouds churning like waves, stretching endlessly.</p><p>Unbeknownst to observers, a landmass was floating within the clouds.  The land floated, light as a feather, suspended above the clouds, like a ship in the clouds, stationary.</p><p>Looking outwards from the landmass, the external scenery was completely visible.  The clouds flowed around the land, with howling winds, yet they couldn't penetrate the landmass in the slightest. Clearly, there was an invisible barrier around it.</p><p>The land sloped downward from south to north. The northern part was a plain, and two mountain ranges ran along the edges of the land, converging in the south.  The convergence formed a valley, which appeared to be the entrance.</p><p>A stele stood at the entrance.  Inscribed on it were two ancient characters — Luye!</p><p>Anyone who came here and saw these words would be shocked, because Luye was the legendary dojo of the Nascent Soul cultivator, the Old Demon Lu!  No wonder Luye had always been so mysterious, its location unknown.  It was actually suspended in the sky!</p><p>Anyone continuing forward from the entrance would be even more astonished.</p><p>Entering the plain, a vibrant flower sea greeted the eyes.  Scarlet, orange, yellow, green, blue, and purple. Famous flowers from the Northern Wastelands to the Southern Barbarian states, even overseas and the Western Desert, were all present, blooming simultaneously regardless of season, vying for beauty.</p><p>Moreover, some of these flowers were not only beautiful but also imbued with spiritual energy, clearly no ordinary flowers.  Three-element Secret Flower, Poisonous Essence Flower, Butterfly Shadow Treasure Flower, Dreamlike Purple Jade…</p><p>Rare spiritual flowers seldom seen in the cultivation world were mixed here with common flowers, treated as mere ornaments. Such extravagant waste would leave most cultivators speechless, exclaiming at the sheer profligacy.</p><p>Fragrant aromas filled the air.  Water gurgled.</p><p>Among the flowers were beauties even more stunning than the blooms.  These women wore light clothing, possessed ethereal beauty, each a peerless vision of breathtaking loveliness, each unique and surpassing the others.</p><p>They moved like butterflies among the flowers; some quietly appreciated the blossoms, others chatted and laughed together.</p><p>Under the moonlight, the scene and its inhabitants were breathtakingly beautiful.  A peal of silvery laughter, charming yet entirely devoid of wantonness, seemed to express their joy.</p><p>A young maiden, her face flushed, her eyes shimmering with a shy allure, glanced at the bamboo grove and houses in the northern plains, a hint of melancholy in her gaze.</p><p>Dozens of women were simply enjoying themselves in the flower fields.</p><p>An unknown number more remained inside the bamboo houses.</p><p>These women were a mix of mortals and cultivators, some even possessing Golden Core cultivation.</p><p>Lu Laomo, the undisputed leader of the demonic path, was a solitary figure, unrestrained and ruthless.  His hands were stained with the blood of countless experts; he had committed numerous atrocities, wiping out entire sects, terrifying countless cultivators.</p><p>This demon lord was never known for his lechery.</p><p>A gentle breeze rustled through the deer plains.</p><p>The bamboo grove whispered.</p><p>This wasn't an ordinary bamboo forest; these were spiritual bamboos, their leaves sword-like and a deep purple.</p><p>In the innermost bamboo house, a stunning woman was meditating.</p><p>Her beauty was no less captivating than the other women outside. Dressed in white court robes, she lacked any air of sanctity; even in meditation, a seductive smile played on her lips, capable of stealing the hearts of the weak-willed with a single glance.</p><p>A crimson crescent moon marked her brow, adding to her allure.</p><p>Then.</p><p>The woman in the white robes seemed to sense something, her eyelashes fluttering as she slowly opened her eyes.  Her gaze, like water, was even more captivating.</p><p>After a moment's thought, she vanished from the bamboo house, reappearing deep within the grove beside a circular pool.</p><p>The pool held not water, but shimmering, multi-colored liquid.  The liquid's fragrance formed a rainbow-like aura around the pool.</p><p>Standing by the pool, she moved her lips silently, speaking without a sound.</p><p>Moments later.</p><p>The liquid bubbled and churned. A featureless head, smooth as a mirror, surfaced, slowly turning to face the woman.  Though eyeless, the woman felt its gaze, her expression tightening as she spoke a few quick words.</p><p>The head nodded slightly and sank back beneath the surface.</p><p>The woman seemed relieved, bowing slightly before leaving the grove, walking along a path through the flower fields towards the entrance of Luye.</p><p>As she appeared, the women in the fields fell silent, bowing respectfully in unison.</p><p>“Greetings, Sister Yue.”</p><p>These exceptional beauties paled in comparison to her.</p><p>Ignoring them, she walked out of Luye, her gaze sweeping the surroundings before she vanished into the dark clouds.</p><p>Only after her departure did the other women resume their normal demeanor, harboring no resentment towards her aloofness, but rather, envy.</p><p>Yue's presence had dampened their spirits.</p><p>However, Luye offered ample diversions.  Aside from being unable to leave, any desire they could imagine was fulfilled by Luye's master.</p><p>Their only task was to maintain their perfect beauty.</p><p>Shortly after.</p><p>The barrier at Luye's entrance was triggered. An elderly man in black robes landed before the stone monument, his qi cleansing him of dust before he stepped inside.</p><p>The women saw him from afar. Some stood, others barely glanced, resuming their activities – a stark contrast to their deference towards the woman in white.</p><p>As the old man walked through the flower fields, a woman said, “Elder Wu is back.”</p><p>Elder Wu was stoic.  The transformed Luye was still somewhat unfamiliar to him.  Nevertheless, he returned the greetings of every woman, even the mortals.</p><p>His gaze swept over the ethereal women; a flicker of pity or perhaps cynicism crossed his eyes.</p><p>He had seen so many.  Generation after generation.  He could no longer recall which cohort of beauties this was.</p><p>A snake pit lurked within the bamboo grove. When these women aged or showed the slightest imperfection, Luye's master would mercilessly cast them into the pit as serpent food.  Even those with spiritual roots and cultivation talent, if they failed to advance in time and showed signs of decline, met the same fate.</p><p>They were like pets, their destinies sealed the moment they were chosen for Luye.</p><p>Few survived to this day.</p><p>This thought crossed his mind as he passed the snake pit, glancing at it impassively before stopping, proclaiming, "Old servant greets Master."</p><p>After a moment…</p><p>A lazy voice drifted from the bamboo grove: "Old Wu is back, perfect timing! Come in."</p><p>Old Wu responded and quickly entered the grove, approaching a medicinal pool. He produced two jade boxes from a pouch and presented them.  "Reporting to Master, we have successfully obtained the Wu God Mud and the fruit of the ancient Tong Hua tree."</p><p>"Oh?"</p><p>A surprised voice echoed from the pool. Two silken threads shot out, snatching the boxes. "Indeed, the Wu God Mud and the fruit!  You've worked hard, Old Wu! Obtaining these treasures wasn't easy, was it? Did the Eight Views and the Ganlu Monastery cause any trouble?"</p><p>Old Wu replied, "They were preoccupied and didn't appear. However, many have been using Master's name to pillage and plunder, causing widespread fear in the Central Plains. The impact is significant."</p><p>The person in the pool was unconcerned. "Once my divine skill is perfected and the Three Corpses Death God Banner is forged, I'll root them out and use them as offerings."</p><p>A cold laugh followed. "The two Transformed Gods of the Eight Views and the Ganlu Monastery are trapped in the Wuwang Palace, quite bold! My foster father found the entrance, observed it for a long time, but only circled the perimeter. Those two haven't come out in two hundred years; they must be deep inside, possibly trapped to death."</p><p>Old Wu cautioned, "Transformed Gods possess immeasurable power. Master shouldn't be careless."</p><p>"Of course, I understand…"</p><p>Bubbles rose from the pool.</p><p>This time, four heads emerged.</p><p>Three were faceless, like before, devoid of features yet capable of movement, all staring intently at Old Wu.</p><p>Before the three faceless heads was a young man with long hair.  He possessed exceptional beauty, strikingly handsome, with sharp brows and bright eyes, a slight smirk playing on his lips – enough to fulfill any maiden's fantasy.</p><p>Scanning the faceless heads, Old Wu's gaze was serious.  "Congratulations, Master, the banner is almost complete!"</p><p>The young man chuckled, "A pity my foster father dedicated himself to ascension and worldly affairs, leaving me with only these. Otherwise, Old Wu wouldn't have had to travel, and I wouldn't have had to wait so long."</p><p>The young man cracked his neck, a series of ‘clicks’ echoing.  A contented expression crossed his face. "Old Wu, you arrived just in time. Yuefei sensed someone trespassing in the Snow Plains. I was about to leave…Go investigate."</p><p>"The Snow Plains?"</p><p>Old Wu paused, then understood. "Master means the place where the presumed Water Aspect Master of the Wuxiang Immortal Sect perished?"</p><p>"Correct."</p><p>The young man nodded.  "Old Wu, have you forgotten? When the Lueyey Plain shifted to this area, Yuefei detected someone acting suspiciously. Unfortunately, we didn't pay attention then.  I suspect this is where the Water Aspect Master fell.  I can’t unlock the secrets here. This person may be a successor, so to avoid alerting them, I had Yuefei control some ice spirits, keeping the Lueyey Plain nearby, waiting for that person to appear.  They’re quite patient, making me wait all these years.”</p><p>Old Wu frowned. "Legend has it the Wuxiang Immortal Sect was once the unchallenged ruler of the cultivation world.  Its five immortal halls, each capable of producing Transformed Gods, rivaled any super sect. Their sudden collapse and disappearance remain a mystery.  If we find the Water Aspect Master's remains, Master will be significantly stronger!"</p><p>"What mystery!"</p><p>The young man sneered. "The Eight Views and the Ganlu Monastery have always been secretive about the Wuxiang Immortal Sect, likely deliberately erasing its history.  They must be involved! The remnants of the sect won't vanish easily.  They're likely plotting in the shadows, and the disappearance of the two Transformed Gods presents a golden opportunity. They will surely cause trouble. Let's wait and see!  Whether the sect lives or dies is irrelevant to me; I don't intend to avenge them.  However, as Old Wu said, if the Water Aspect Master truly escaped to the Northern Wasteland and perished here, they must have many treasures, perhaps other surprises!"</p><p>He paused, adding, "Yuefei says the person is at the mid-Yuan Ying stage.  She alone might not be able to subdue him.  Old Wu, capture him alive, securing his Yuan Ying.  After I complete the Three Corpses Death God Banner, he'll be the first soul. Mid-Yuan Ying, barely sufficient…"</p><p>Old Wu nodded repeatedly and hurried off.</p><p>—</p><p>—</p><p>The old chat group’s political discussions got banned.  The new group number is in the introduction.</p><p>Be careful in the new group.</p><p>Otherwise, if you get me banned, I’ll have a reason to abandon the story.</p>
