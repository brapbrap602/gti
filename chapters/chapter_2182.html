<h1>Chapter 2172:  The Zhaoyang Ode</h1><p>This was a Void-Domain Sword imbued with sword-domain power!</p><p>Since unleashing that sword strike with the Cloud-Roaming Sword, Qin Sang had been constantly studying it. Finally, she was able to wield the Void-Domain Sword with the Ash-Oriole Sword, and its debut in battle proved overwhelmingly effective.</p><p>The Ash-Oriole Sword was inferior in grade to the Cloud-Roaming Sword, resulting in a less powerful strike, but this technique still far surpassed Qin Sang's own current level.</p><p>The elegantly dressed woman's cultivation was comparable to Qin Sang's.  With her spirit beast seized by Liuli, and her beast formation thus compromised, her unfortunate outcome was hardly surprising.</p><p>The Nine-Gang Treasure Shield and her robe were cleaved by a single sword, leaving the woman gravely injured.  The ferocious sword intent penetrated her wound, exploding within her body.</p><p>In an instant, the woman's body was riddled with wounds, her life force extinguished. Yet, she wasn't dead; her soul remained. This wasn't due to insufficient power in the technique, but because Qin Sang wanted to capture her alive!</p><p>…</p><p>Simultaneously, a earth-shattering battle erupted outside the sword array.</p><p>Liuli’s capture of the spirit beast created a weakness in the beast formation. The girl in the red dress, the formation's master, noticed the anomaly and immediately realized the danger facing the woman in the elegant robes.</p><p>The spirit beasts controlled by Liuli were no longer responsive to the girl in red; they stood still, actively resisting the formation. This caused a stagnation in the array's operation, which then spread rapidly.</p><p>Many spirit beasts became restless and disoriented.</p><p>The red-dressed girl, remaining calm under pressure, produced a jade flute, its body a vibrant green. She brought the flute to her lips and gently played. The sound drifted through the air.</p><p>The flute's melody was clear and melodious, like heavenly music, depicting all the beauty in the world. Poetic and picturesque, it soared through the clouds, penetrating the vast beast formation, a clear stream flowing into the hearts of all, dreamlike and ethereal.</p><p>Every creature within the beast formation heard the music. The previously anxious spirit beasts calmed down, seemingly understanding the melody, their expressions rapturous as they became completely enthralled.</p><p>As the notes flowed, the spirit beasts involuntarily raised their heads and opened their mouths.</p><p>From their mouths erupted fiery breath, gathering above the beast formation.</p><p>'唳!'</p><p>A phoenix cry suddenly pierced the melody, like a newly hatched chick, clear and shrill.</p><p>From the fiery breath, a phoenix truly emerged. It spread its wings, flying out of the flames, like a spirit born of fire, reborn from the flames, its light dazzling.</p><p>With this change, the girl in red instantly assessed the situation. The enemy's sudden attack indicated either a desperate final gamble or newly acquired, overwhelming power.</p><p>The situation had shifted dramatically. They were no longer facing just a cultivator in the early stages of the Void Refinement Realm and a severely injured opponent.  The enemy had obviously called for reinforcements, possessing formidable abilities and managing to infiltrate the beast formation undetected.</p><p>Regardless of the enemy's intentions, her junior sister was undoubtedly in the greatest danger.</p><p>If she focused on restoring the beast formation, it might be too late to rescue her sister by the time it was fully operational.</p><p>In conflicts between experts, victory hinges on a moment's decision.  The enemy was well-prepared, taking her by surprise.</p><p>Even if she let the enemy escape, she couldn't stand idly by while her junior sister was in danger. Thus, she made an immediate decision, summoning the Wind-Hymn Flute, foregoing the restoration of the beast array and desperately unleashing its potential to save her junior sister!</p><p>The flute's melody was like a wind's hymn.</p><p>The fire phoenix soared on the wind, its crimson wings ablaze, tracing a graceful arc across the sky. In that moment, it exuded boundless elegance and beauty, yet concealed within was infinite killing intent.</p><p>Qin Sang, sensing something, looked up slightly.  Above, the sky was a crimson expanse, a fire phoenix hurtling towards her, its presence intensely oppressive.</p><p>However, anticipating this possibility, he was prepared, having already activated the Sun-Wheel Seal.</p><p>At that moment, two suns appeared in the sky simultaneously: the Sun-Wheel Seal, golden, and the fire phoenix, crimson.</p><p>Two suns vied for brilliance!</p><p>The crimson sun, carrying terrifying momentum, tore through the air, striking the golden sun.  Or, rather, the golden sun actively met the fire phoenix.</p><p>'轰!'</p><p>In an instant, a cataclysmic explosion erupted between the two suns.</p><p>This was the clash of two powerful spells. The explosive force was terrifying, enough to shatter mountains and destroy everything on the ground.</p><p>Because of the beast formation, the apocalyptic scene didn't materialize, but golden and crimson flames danced across the sky, boundless and unending, as the two forces continued their confrontation.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Qin Sang, engulfed in blazing flames, retreated swiftly, his aura slightly disordered.  He had successfully deflected the Fire Phoenix.  Simultaneously, the Grey Warbler sword shot back.</p><p>Swish!</p><p>Wrapped in spiritual light, the sword carried the spirit of the woman in palace attire.  Qin Sang, with a sweep of his sleeve, captured the spirit and stored it.  He coldly observed the chaotic scene, his gaze piercing the flames, seeming to see the girl playing the flute in the clouds.</p><p>At that moment, the girl in red sensed her companion's spirit vanish, her face turning pale.  She hadn't expected the enemy to be so powerful.  How could a mid-stage Void Refinement cultivator, even a weaker one, fall so swiftly before she could intervene?</p><p>The girl in red couldn't fathom what transpired within the sword formation. Decisive by nature, she saw the rescue had failed.  Knowing she couldn't save her companion, her flute's melody quickened.</p><p>The Fire Phoenix, surrounded by golden flames, was battling them. Suddenly, it turned its head, fixing its gaze on the mountain peak where Liuli and Lizhen were hiding.  It immediately changed course, lunging towards them.</p><p>Liuli acted, activating the Imperial Emperor Talisman. Their presence was inevitably exposed.</p><p>The Fire Phoenix and the Sun Seal were mutually weakening, their power significantly diminished, but the remaining force was still formidable.</p><p>Qin Sang wouldn't stand idly by.  Transforming into a streak of lightning, he appeared above the peak just as the Fire Phoenix arrived.  A flash of sword light, the Grey Warbler sword cleaved through the Fire Phoenix.</p><p>Swish!</p><p>The sword passed right through, the Fire Phoenix disintegrating into scattered flames that couldn't harm the mountain.</p><p>The girl in red's greatest challenge had just begun.  With the woman's spirit captured by Qin Sang, her spirit beast lost contact with its master, falling into panic. The girl controlled the beasts through the woman; she could forcibly control them, but perfectly coordinating them in the beast formation was incredibly difficult.</p><p>The moment the woman was captured, the beast formation crumbled!</p><p>"Roar! Roar! Roar!"</p><p>Roars echoed, some beasts running wildly like headless flies, their chaotic energy spreading through the formation.  This was exactly what Qin Sang had anticipated, one of the reasons they targeted the woman first.</p><p>The chaotic formation presented a golden opportunity. Qin Sang had secretly communicated with Liuli and Lizhen, urging their escape while he faced the formation's master.  They refused.</p><p>Understanding their reasoning, Qin Sang didn't press further, silently using sword techniques, aiming for the formation's core.</p><p>The girl in red felt immense pressure. The situation had deteriorated drastically.  If she couldn't quickly stabilize the formation, she'd be in danger.  She fiercely stared at Qin Sang, her eyes slightly reddened, hate flashing across her face. Her flute's tone sharpened, becoming like the clang of metal, a sound of slaughter.</p><p>This tune, "Flowing Sorrow," was one of the eight deadly sounds of Langxian Garden.</p><p>Each note was more piercing, stirring up inner rage.  As the music played, all the woman's beasts froze, the chaos in the formation subsiding slightly, but only temporarily.</p><p>Then, even louder and more violent roars shook the heavens. The girl's beasts roared in fury, their rage turning on each other.  Their reason consumed by anger, they attacked their former allies.</p><p>In an instant, the woman's beasts were slaughtered, the survivors devouring their fallen comrades, their bodies stained with blood. The formation, far from collapsing, underwent a reversal, erupting in an incredibly violent inferno.</p><p>From outside, a pillar of fire shot towards the sky, carrying an aura of madness and slaughter.  The formation was now a maelstrom of carnage, even more terrifying than before.</p><p>Deep within the mountain, Liuli, using the Imperial Emperor Talisman, helped Qin Sang capture the woman. She didn't stop, even though she was exhausted. The talisman's true power far exceeded boosting Liuli to early Void Refinement; her low cultivation prevented her from withstanding greater power.  She could unleash the talisman's full power, but the backlash would be immense, and its uses were limited.</p><p>Previously, Liao Chen had desperately sent Liu Li away to unseal the spirit talisman.</p><p>Now, Liu Li faced a similar situation. If she persisted beyond her limits, she would suffer severe backlash.  However, she disregarded this, once again employing the Heavenly Emperor's Mandate, already at the peak of her strength.</p><p>In the cave, Liu Li sat rigidly like a statue. The pressure from the Heavenly Emperor Talisman was immense; her delicate body trembled, blood seeping from her nose and mouth, but she didn't stop. The illusory Heavenly Emperor within the spiritual light was even clearer than before.</p><p>Only now, the target of the Heavenly Emperor's Mandate was the red-dressed girl's spirit beasts.</p><p>Liu Li's attack and the eruption of the beast formation were almost simultaneous; the crimson flames faltered for a moment.</p><p>The red-dressed girl instantly noticed the anomaly, finally understanding the power at play. She snorted coldly, tightening her grip on the jade flute, changing the melody.</p><p>This time, the flute notes soared, high-pitched and resonant, piercing the clouds like the radiant light of dawn.</p><p>The spirit beasts howled, flames spontaneously erupting on their bodies, quickly engulfing them in raging infernos. Their bodies seemed to be consumed entirely, transforming into balls of fire.</p><p>In an instant, all the spirit beasts in the formation vanished, becoming swirling flames in the void, forming a fiery array!</p><p>…</p><p>Liu Li focused on activating the Heavenly Emperor Talisman, while Liao Chen regained his composure.</p><p>He forcefully suppressed his injuries, anxiously watching the changing situation outside, ready to intervene at any moment to prevent unforeseen circumstances.  Noticing the transformation of the beast array, his expression tightened, and he quickly transmitted a voice message: "Qin Zhenren, beware! This is 'Zhao Yang Fu,' one of the three great divine melodies of Lang Xian Yuan!"</p><p>'Pfft!'</p><p>Liu Li suddenly opened her eyes, spitting out a mouthful of blood, her face ashen.</p><p>The spiritual light behind her flickered, the Heavenly Emperor's illusion shattered, the other images within the light also dissolving, until the light completely dissipated.</p><p>Having witnessed her senior disciple's fate, the red-dressed girl would not repeat the same mistake.  As the spirit beasts transformed into flames, they immediately broke free from the Heavenly Emperor's Mandate's influence, and the formation intensified.</p><p>At this moment, heaven and earth were consumed by flames.</p><p>The fiery glow of the numerous flames formed a boundless sea of fire.</p><p>However, as the beast formation exploded, a clear sound of a lock mechanism echoed, followed by a golden light.  Regardless of the flames' onslaught, it remained unbroken.</p><p>Qin Sang stood atop the mountain peak, his expression calm, a golden light above his head.  It wasn't the Sun Wheel Seal, but the Sky-Binding Golden Lock!</p><p>The red-dressed girl, a Nascent Soul late-stage cultivator, proved resourceful and adept at escaping danger.  But first, the woman in palace attire was captured, then Liu Li provided exceptional support. Despite the red-dressed girl's quick reactions, there were openings, which Qin Sang didn't miss!</p><p>Countless flames swirled around the formation's eye, forming a massive fiery vortex. Within the vortex, the golden light rapidly expanded, solidifying the flames it touched.</p><p>In an instant, nearly thirty percent of the flames were frozen.</p><p>The flute music abruptly stopped.</p><p>The red-dressed girl's face paled.</p><p>"Void Domain!"</p><p>Even among Nascent Soul late-stage cultivators, only a select few had grasped the Void Domain, and she hadn't yet found a way.</p><p>To possess Void Domain abilities at only Nascent Soul mid-stage cultivation was unbelievable.  No wonder her senior sister was no match.</p><p>"No! It must be that artifact…"</p><p>The red-dressed girl noticed the Sky-Binding Golden Lock.</p><p>Regardless of how it was achieved, the ability to use the Void Domain meant he couldn't be treated as a Nascent Soul mid-stage cultivator.  He could rival the top experts of the Sacred Land!</p><p>The red-dressed girl considered retreating.</p><p>With her senior sister captured, she was alone. Revenge was impossible against him.  She'd already lost the advantage, and if drawn into the Void Domain, her life would be in danger!</p><p>With that thought, the flute music resumed, like a thunderclap.</p><p>'Rumble…'</p><p>The earth trembled.</p><p>The fiery vortex suddenly exploded, countless flames erupting from the array like scattered flowers, shooting in all directions.</p><p>Qin Sang snorted, surprised by the red-dressed girl's decisiveness.  Unfortunately, she was still within her beast formation; she'd been hiding within the formation's eye.  To subdue her, he first had to overcome the beast formation.  The red-dressed girl, being a Nascent Soul late-stage cultivator, maintained control of the formation's eye even in the most critical moments.</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang activated the Sky-Binding Golden Lock with all his might, simultaneously pointing to the sky.</p><p>Dragons and snakes coiled in the high heavens, thunder rumbling.</p><p>A thunder seal appeared amidst the lightning.</p><p>The red-dressed girl proactively detonated the fiery array, fully exposing the formation's eye.  The thunder seal descended upon it.</p><p>'Crack!'</p><p>The azure lightning struck the formation's eye!</p>
