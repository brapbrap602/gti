<h1>Chapter 1199: The Stone Hut</h1><p>At first glance, this stone wall appeared entirely ordinary. If not for the Heavenly Eye Butterfly's reminder, Qin Sang might have overlooked it entirely. Even if cultivators from the Southern Hidden Mountain Range were to stumble upon this place, they would likely fail to detect its secrets.</p><p>After a prolonged and meticulous examination, Qin Sang and the Heavenly Eye Butterfly finally concluded that the restrictions on the stone wall were highly peculiar, imbued with the aura of divine runes—a hallmark of the Witch Clan! In the Canglang Sea, this wouldn't have struck Qin Sang as unusual, as the Witch Clan had once been the dominant force there before the rise of the Four Saints of the Human Race and their subsequent expulsion to the Witch God Continent. However, in the Little Cold Domain, neither Qin Sang's personal experiences nor the myriad legends he had heard made any mention of the Witch Clan. In fact, the entire North Star Realm seemed devoid of any such tales.</p><p>Yet, deep within the Heavenly Scar, there lay a Witch Clan restriction! Could this place be connected to the Corpse Refining Sect? Could it be that the Corpse Refining Talisman was a secret technique of the Witch Clan, and the key to unraveling it lay within their ancient arts? If so, it would be akin to entering a treasure trove only to leave empty-handed!</p><p>During his time in the Canglang Sea, Qin Sang had encountered the Witch Clan's corpse-refining techniques, which bore a striking resemblance to those of the Human Race's corpse path, yet differed significantly from the methods of the Corpse Refining Sect. Unless the Witch Clan's corpse path heritage had been severed in the Canglang Sea and somehow found its way here...</p><p>Regardless, encountering a Witch Clan restriction here was reason enough to investigate further. Qin Sang proceeded cautiously, working in tandem with the Heavenly Eye Butterfly to activate his Heavenly Eye ability, meticulously analyzing the restrictions layer by layer in search of a way to dismantle them.</p><p>Gradually, Qin Sang began to piece together the puzzle. "The restrictions aren't particularly powerful, but they are intricately designed, divided into multiple layers. The outer layer serves not only to conceal but also carries a destructive intent—if forcibly breached, it would self-destruct immediately. The inner layers seem to incorporate illusions, defenses, and even a hint of teleportation, likely intended to allow those inside to escape..."</p><p>After patiently analyzing the restrictions, Qin Sang cast a doubtful glance at the stone wall. "This feels more like a defensive measure for a cave dwelling. The restrictions aren't as formidable as the ancient ones I've encountered before. Could it be that a cultivator who inherited the Witch Clan's legacy established a cave dwelling here?"</p><p>Qin Sang's understanding of the Witch Clan was superficial at best, and he couldn't confirm his suspicions. Yet, something about this felt off. After some deliberation, he decided against acting rashly. Instead, he retreated from the area, set up contingency measures outside as was his habit, and then cautiously attempted to interact with the restrictions on the stone wall, essentially sending a signal of his intent to visit.</p><p>After waiting patiently for a considerable amount of time and receiving no response despite multiple attempts, Qin Sang decided to proceed. The Heavenly Eye Butterfly's wings spread wide, revealing its true eyes—not mere patterns, but deep, abyssal pupils filled with a chaotic, thunderous aura. Its gaze, as tangible as a physical force, locked onto the stone wall.</p><p>Qin Sang sat cross-legged before the stone wall, surrounded by the Twelve Demon Banners, and began to unravel the restrictions with the precision of a silk weaver, using his Golden Sinking Sword. His movements were deliberate and cautious, ensuring that the process was slow but free from any risk of backlash. This ease was partly due to his high cultivation level and his prior exposure to the Witch Clan's divine runes, which had given him some understanding of their nature. Of course, the Heavenly Eye Butterfly's assistance was indispensable.</p><p>Layer by layer, the restrictions were dismantled, gradually revealing the true appearance of the stone wall. As expected, it concealed a secret realm. When the restrictions were fully dispelled, there was still no reaction from within. After waiting a moment to confirm that the secret realm posed no immediate threat, Qin Sang left the Fat Chicken to guard the entrance, activated the Twelve Demon Banners, and stepped inside. In an instant, he found himself atop a mountain.</p><p>"Such desolation!" was Qin Sang's first impression of the secret realm. There were no flowers, trees, pavilions, or towers—just an endless expanse of gray ground stretching to the horizon. At first glance, the area seemed empty, but upon closer inspection, the ground was covered in a fine layer of dust, as if ravaged by a relentless storm that had crushed everything in its path. The term "ruins" hardly sufficed to describe the extent of the devastation.</p><p>Qin Sang recalled the great upheaval that had occurred a century ago. Could this place have been struck by that cataclysm, resulting in its current state? Or was this, perhaps, the very source of that upheaval?</p><p>Qin Sang soared through the air, heading deeper into the secret realm. The landscape remained monotonously bleak until, nearing the realm's boundary, he finally spotted something different—a stone hut!</p><p>The hut was situated within a depression, surrounded by raised terrain, yet it was just as dilapidated as everything else. Qin Sang's gaze sharpened as he swept the area with his spiritual sense. The surroundings were eerily silent, with no trace of anyone else's presence.</p><p>After a moment's thought, Qin Sang descended before the stone hut. He easily dismantled the restrictions on the hut and pushed the door open, only to be momentarily taken aback by the interior.</p><p>The hut was small and sparsely furnished. To the left, a meditation mat and a jade table were arranged. To the right, a large portion of the space was occupied by an Ice Spirit Formation, which was still operational, though the spirit stones within had long since lost their luster, their spiritual energy depleted. The formation now barely sustained itself by drawing energy from the surrounding void.</p><p>It was clear that the hut's owner had been absent for a long time. A faint chill emanated from the Ice Spirit Formation, at the center of which stood a knee-high, elongated ice platform. The platform was empty, but its dimensions immediately reminded Qin Sang of something—the crystal coffin he had once given to Tan Hao to preserve Tan Jie's body. The two were identical in size, as if the ice platform had been custom-made to house the coffin.</p><p>"Could the owner of this hut be Tan Hao?" Qin Sang wondered silently.</p><p>The ice platform and the Ice Spirit Formation seemed designed to work in tandem with the crystal coffin, preserving Tan Jie's body. This revelation came as a great surprise to Qin Sang. He had entertained numerous possibilities, but Tan Hao had never crossed his mind. When had Tan Hao mastered the Witch Clan's divine runes, and to such a high degree? The level of the restrictions here suggested a proficiency that even the Witch Clan of the Canglang Sea might not possess.</p><p>"Judging by the hut's arrangement, Tan Hao must have lived here for a considerable time before departing for reasons unknown..." Qin Sang deduced based on the available clues.</p><p>However, a lingering question troubled Qin Sang: Had the Witch Clan restrictions outside existed prior to Tan Hao's arrival, and had he, like Qin Sang, dismantled them to enter? Or had Tan Hao himself laid down those restrictions? What had he discovered here, and why had he chosen to stay?</p><p>Pondering these questions, Qin Sang moved to the meditation mat. Aside from the Ice Spirit Formation, the hut contained only a few miscellaneous items. There was no indication that Tan Hao had been forced to flee in haste, nor had he left behind any useful information.</p><p>"After leaving this place, where did Tan Hao go? If he needed to set up an Ice Spirit Formation to preserve the crystal coffin, does that mean he failed to find the Corpse Refining Sect's legacy? Or perhaps even the Corpse Refining Sect couldn't unravel the Corpse Refining Talisman? If so, why didn't he return to the Little Cold Domain to see Tan Yi'en? Did something else happen afterward?"</p><p>A cloud of doubt settled over Qin Sang's heart. These discoveries cast a shadow over his hopes. If even the Corpse Refining Sect couldn't undo the Corpse Refining Talisman, then the only remaining hope for awakening Ya Gu lay with Bai.</p>
