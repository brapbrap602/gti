<h1>Chapter 1468: Journey to the Demon Realm (4k)</h1><p>The external avatar stood before Qin Sang.  </p><p>Qin Sang had not deliberately altered its appearance; it was simply an enlarged version of the Dao Manifestation Tree, with well-defined features that bore no resemblance to his true form.  </p><p>Previously, due to the soul imprint within the Nascent Soul Talisman Puppet, Qin Sang had felt a deep connection to it, as if it were a part of his own bloodline. Now, the connection was even stronger, as if the avatar were an inseparable extension of his own body.  </p><p>Closing his eyes, Qin Sang immersed himself in contemplation for a moment.  </p><p>When he opened his eyes, he carefully examined the external avatar.  </p><p>The avatar had just been formed and was not yet ready for combat. It required further refinement, and only after it had fully assimilated the power of the Ice Soul Divine Aura and achieved a solid foundation could it reach its full potential.  </p><p>This process might take several years or even decades, depending on the origin and strength of the avatar's physical form. However, since the Dao Manifestation Tree was no ordinary spiritual body, it might not take as long.  </p><p>Nevertheless, due to the presence of the soul shadow, Qin Sang still needed to assist the second primordial spirit in absorbing it. Until the avatar reached its full potential, it could not be relied upon as a significant asset.  </p><p>After patiently waiting for a month, Qin Sang saw no significant progress.  </p><p>On this day, he stored the external avatar in the Corpse Puppet Bag and decided it was time to leave. Calculating the time, he realized that he had spent nearly a year in the underground yin vein without even noticing.  </p><p>During this period, he had not returned to the Listening Snow Pavilion even once.  </p><p>Shi Xue had also not sent any further messages.  </p><p>He wondered how they had ultimately dealt with the situation after Liuli's failed breakthrough.  </p><p>Surveying his surroundings, Qin Sang meticulously erased all traces of the avatar's creation. With a series of swift movements, he flew out of the cave and was greeted by the long-missed sunlight.  </p><p>It was midday, and the sky was clear and boundless.  </p><p>The sunlight brought a touch of warmth as it bathed the land.  </p><p>Qin Sang rode his escape light, moving leisurely as he made his way back to the Listening Snow Pavilion's cave abode.  </p><p>Only Shi Xue and Liuli knew of his existence within the Listening Snow Pavilion, so he was rarely disturbed.  </p><p>After a period of quiet cultivation in the cave, Qin Sang felt refreshed, with all the fatigue and damage from refining the external avatar completely gone.  </p><p>When he awoke from his meditation, a thoughtful expression crossed his face.  </p><p>The main objectives of his visit to the Listening Snow Pavilion had been accomplished: he had obtained the status of an honorary elder, successfully refined the external avatar, and there were still nine years before the opening of the Holy Land.  </p><p>By then, he would need to return early to cooperate with Tong Lingyu and the Listening Snow Pavilion to secure an opportunity to observe the Holy Land's ceremony.  </p><p>In the meantime, there was no need for him to remain at the Listening Snow Pavilion.  </p><p>He had rushed to the North Sea to explore and search for fragments of the Slaughter Sword and subsequent cultivation techniques shortly after breaking through to the mid-Nascent Soul stage.  </p><p>Unexpectedly, upon arriving in the North Sea, he was immediately pursued by a demon king, followed by a series of unforeseen events that led him from the Crescent Moon Realm to the Hidden Sun Realm, where he became an honorary elder of the Listening Snow Pavilion.  </p><p>Although he had traversed much of the North Sea, his journey had been hurried, leaving him no time to thoroughly search for what he sought.  </p><p>Now that most of his affairs were settled, he could focus on his exploration.  </p><p>Qin Sang's initial plan was to depart from the Listening Snow Pavilion, head north into the Demon Realm, pass through the Demon Realm and the Star Sand Archipelago, make a wide loop back to the Crescent Moon Realm, and visit the Hundred Flowers Valley's Valley Master Mu along the way.  </p><p>Then, he would traverse the Crescent Moon Realm from end to end, enter the Boundless Sea from the southern tip, and circle back to the Hidden Sun Realm, essentially covering all the major regions of the North Sea.  </p><p>During this journey, his primary goal would be to search for fragments of the Slaughter Sword, while avoiding getting entangled in other conflicts. He believed he had enough time to accomplish this.  </p><p>With this in mind, Qin Sang made some final preparations and activated the mark on his elder's token to contact Shi Xue, intending to bid her farewell.  </p><p>Not long after, a cold ice escape light landed in front of the cave abode. Seeing that the formation had been deactivated, Shi Xue stepped inside.  </p><p>When she saw Qin Sang again, her expression was somewhat peculiar. She wasn't sure how to evaluate her junior sister and this man.  </p><p>After the incident that day, her junior sister had secluded herself in the Drifting Snow Pavilion and had yet to emerge. This man had also disappeared without a trace, not showing his face for such a long time.  </p><p>Both of them seemed completely unfazed, as if they possessed extraordinary composure, leaving her as the only one who had been worried.  </p><p>"Is Fairy Liuli still in seclusion?" Qin Sang asked with a bow.  </p><p>Shi Xue nodded. "Without my junior sister's permission, I dare not disturb her."  </p><p>Qin Sang knew that Liuli was likely struggling against the imprint of the demonic technique, but he had no idea what method she was using or how effective it was.  </p><p>After a moment of hesitation, he said, "Please convey to Fairy Liuli that if she needs any assistance, I am willing to offer whatever help I can, though it may be insignificant."  </p><p>He himself had resorted to unorthodox methods to build his foundation, but that did not diminish his admiration for those who adhered to their own principles.  </p><p>Such a path was undoubtedly more difficult, fraught with thorns.  </p><p>Yet Liuli had chosen it resolutely.  </p><p>Moreover, as an honorary elder of the Listening Snow Pavilion, Qin Sang needed to use this identity to secure an opportunity to observe the Holy Land's ceremony. Helping Liuli strengthen the Listening Snow Pavilion's power and elevate its status within the Profound Heaven Palace would ultimately benefit him as well.  </p><p>The imprint on Liuli was related to him, but Qin Sang had no clear solution to the problem. In his view, the cultivation world was filled with countless miraculous techniques, and there was no need to rely solely on dual cultivation to resolve the issue.  </p><p>"You have some conscience after all!" Shi Xue glanced at Qin Sang, her gaze softening slightly as she expressed her gratitude.  </p><p>Next, Qin Sang shifted the conversation, inquiring about the conflict between the Profound Heaven Palace and the demon race.  </p><p>From Shi Xue's account, Qin Sang learned that the battlefield was located in the sea between the Demon Realm and the Hidden Sun Realm, and it had not yet spread to the territories of either realm.  </p><p>However, the conflict was intensifying. The Great Sage Tianpeng, ambitious and cunning, seemed to have detected the unusual state of the Profound Heaven Palace's palace master and was pressing forward aggressively.  </p><p>The other Great Sage, the Nine-Headed Great Sage, had not appeared, but it was certain that he was supporting Tianpeng from the shadows.  </p><p>Elder Tong Lingyu was being held back by Tianpeng, and the various branches of the Profound Heaven Palace had sent Nascent Soul cultivators to the battlefield.  </p><p>Among the four branches of the Profound Heaven Palace, the palace master hailed from the Profound Heaven Branch, while Elder Tong came from the Purple Mist Pavilion. However, the strongest branch overall was the Heavenly Mountain Branch, whose cultivators were fiercely combative and had been clamoring for an all-out war with the demon race, seeking a decisive battle to the death.  </p><p>This was something the Listening Snow Pavilion wished to avoid.  </p><p>If the war spread to the Hidden Sun Realm, the Listening Snow Pavilion, located in the northern region of the realm, would be the first to bear the brunt.  </p><p>The Listening Snow Pavilion was the weakest of the four branches, with the least influence. Its disciples were often marginalized by the Heavenly Mountain Branch and repeatedly assigned the most dangerous missions. Shi Xue was overwhelmed by the situation and planned to personally enter the battlefield to stabilize the situation.  </p><p>After a moment of contemplation, Qin Sang asked, "Has the Profound Heaven Palace planted any spies within the demon race?"  </p><p>Shi Xue gave him a wary look, finding it unlikely that Qin Sang would collude with the demons. "There are some, but not many. They cannot access important secrets, as this is a conflict between two races. It is difficult to bribe demon kings at the Transformation Stage, so we can only send some spirit beasts raised within the Profound Heaven Palace since childhood to infiltrate the Demon Realm."  </p><p>This was more or less what Qin Sang had expected.  </p><p>He immediately said, "I plan to enter the Demon Realm to explore. If I uncover any intelligence, I will send it back through your spies to earn some merit."  </p><p>Shi Xue understood Qin Sang's intentions. "If you are willing to join the battlefield and help the Profound Heaven Palace repel the demons, you might be granted direct access to the Holy Land."  </p><p>"From Elder Tong's tone, the more strength I display, the more wary the Profound Heaven Palace will become of me. With another Great Sage observing from the sidelines, my intervention would only provoke greater ferocity from the demons and would not change the overall situation. The conflict between the two races will not be resolved within a few years, and by the time the demons retreat, the Holy Land will have long since closed."  </p><p>Qin Sang had a clear understanding of the situation and had no intention of rashly involving himself in the conflicts of other regions.  </p><p>He planned to suppress his cultivation to the early stage. This way, when interacting with other demon kings, he could easily explain his origins by claiming that he had been in a state of confusion, with his spiritual intelligence not fully awakened, and had only recently achieved transformation.  </p><p>A mid-Transformation Stage demon king would be too conspicuous, and it would be difficult to fabricate a plausible backstory.  </p><p>Qin Sang's divine sense had already reached the Transformation Stage, far surpassing what it had been when he first arrived in the North Sea. As long as he did not directly confront the two Great Sages or encounter demons with particularly unique innate abilities, even mid-Transformation Stage demon kings would be unable to see through his true cultivation level.  </p><p>"The demons are on high alert now. If they encounter a human, they will undoubtedly attack en masse. How do you plan to operate within the Demon Realm?" Shi Xue's curiosity about Qin Sang grew.  </p><p>Qin Sang smiled without answering, then suddenly remembered something. "How much do you know about the Demon Realm? Have the demons discovered the legendary route to the North Star Realm?"  </p><p>Shi Xue was clearly aware of the North Star Realm's existence. "Are you worried that they might seek reinforcements from the North Star Realm? Even if the demons do not know the route, the two Great Sages certainly have the ability to cross the storm belt."  </p><p>Little did she know, Qin Sang's concern was not for the Profound Heaven Palace, but for the North Star Realm.  </p><p>Previously, he had not realized that the Demon Realm was so powerful, with two Great Sages.  </p><p>Qin Sang suspected that the Feather King of the Heavenly Demon Ridge had long been in contact with the two Great Sages. It was possible that during one of his entries into the Purple Micro Palace, a Great Sage had secretly followed. Otherwise, when the North Star Realm formed the North Star Alliance and humans set aside their differences to unite, the Heavenly Demon Ridge would have already been in a state of panic.  </p><p>Fortunately, the Demon Realm was being held back by major forces like the Profound Heaven Palace, and humans held an absolute advantage in the North Star Realm. The Feather King might also harbor some wariness toward the two Great Sages, or else the northern region would already be under demon control.  </p><p>...  </p><p>Ten days later, Qin Sang left the Listening Snow Pavilion and headed north alone.  </p><p>Shortly after leaving the Hidden Sun Realm, Qin Sang activated the Heavenly Demon Transformation, revealing his phoenix wings.  </p><p>At this time, the human and demon races were locked in a standoff at sea, with the Great Sage Tianpeng personally overseeing the situation. To avoid the Great Sage, Qin Sang decided to first head east, bypassing the conflict zone.  </p><p>After circling around the battlefield, he continued to fly north.  </p><p>After traveling several hundred miles, he could hardly see any human cultivators. The further north he went, the more it became the domain of the demons.  </p><p>Many islands bore clear traces of human presence, with some featuring cities built by mortals and others housing the cave abodes of human cultivators. However, these had now become playgrounds for demonic beasts.  </p><p>These traces were not ancient.  </p><p>According to what he had learned, before the emergence of the two Great Sages, the demons had been in a difficult position, forced to retreat into the Demon Realm or hide in the deep sea. They rarely dared to roam the seas outside the Demon Realm, and even within the Demon Realm, they had to be cautious of human cultivators sneaking in to hunt them.  </p><p>The deep-seated hatred between humans and demons in the North Sea had accumulated over time.  </p><p>Back then, human traces could be found everywhere except in the Demon Realm.  </p><p>It was only after the two Great Sages became pillars of the demon race and the demons united that the situation reversed. The Nine-Headed Great Sage, with his indifferent temperament, rarely appeared in public. The demons, who had long been seething with resentment, rallied under the leadership of the Great Sage Tianpeng and first attacked the Star Sand Archipelago.  </p><p>Now, the humans of the Star Sand Archipelago had been nearly wiped out, and Tianpeng had turned his attention to the Hidden Sun Realm.  </p><p>Fortunately, the Profound Heaven Palace had anticipated Tianpeng's ambitions and had withdrawn humans from the offshore islands to the mainland in advance. The losses were not severe, but there were still occasional tragedies due to oversights.  </p><p>As Qin Sang passed by island after island, he saw the remains of humans in the ruined cities, with almost no survivors. Those who had not retreated in time had been devoured by demonic beasts.  </p><p>The scene here was different from that of the Demon Sea.  </p><p>In the Demon Sea, the humans were all cultivators or descendants of cultivators, and they had the ability to escape when faced with a beast tide. Here, however, most of the dead were ordinary mortals.  </p><p>Qin Sang's speed increased as the traces of human presence grew scarcer, slightly alleviating the heavy mood he had been carrying.  </p><p>Only when he reached the northeastern part of the Demon Realm did Qin Sang change his course, heading west and approaching the Demon Realm. He moved cautiously, taking a detour to the north of the Demon Realm.  </p><p>This area was sparsely populated, with only a few scattered islands, all covered in dense forests and teeming with life.  </p><p>In the past, demonic beasts would often appear here, engaging in bloody battles that filled the air with the stench of blood and demonic energy. Recently, however, the area had become much quieter.  </p><p>At this moment, a black shark cut through the waves, exuding a thick demonic aura. The lesser demons it encountered along the way trembled in fear, fleeing in all directions.  </p><p>On the back of the black shark sat a man.  </p><p>This man had a broad face and a wide mouth, with an ugly appearance. However, he stood nine feet tall, with an imposing build. His head was adorned with two antlers larger than his skull, making him look top-heavy.  </p><p>This man was clearly a stag demon at the Transformation Stage.  </p><p>The black shark beneath him was also a demon at the Core Formation Stage, but it was extremely docile in the presence of the stag demon king.  </p><p>The stag demon king's eyes were closed, as if he had fallen into a deep sleep.  </p><p>Suddenly, the stag demon king awoke, his eyes flashing with a fierce light. He pressed a hand on the black shark's head and glared at the distant sea. "Who's there? Show yourself!"  </p><p>The black shark, forced to a halt, whimpered as blood seeped from its eyes, not daring to protest.  </p><p>Under the stag demon king's intense gaze, a mist rose from the sea, revealing a blurry figure. This figure had phoenix wings on its back and exuded a pure demonic aura, clearly another demon king.  </p><p>The stag demon king's expression softened slightly, but then he frowned again. "Which fellow daoist is this? Hiding in the shadows and sneaking around—what is your intention?"  </p><p>"My name is Yuan Zhu. I was passing through and didn't expect to be discovered by you," the figure in the mist said, standing at a distance and not moving, as if also wary of the stag demon king and ready to flee at any moment.  </p><p>"Yuan Zhu?"  </p><p>The stag demon king thought for a moment but could not recall any demon king under the Great Sage Tianpeng with that name. "I've never heard of you. Which clan do you belong to? Are you with the Nine-Headed Great Sage?"  </p><p>After a long hesitation, the figure replied, "I'm not with anyone. I've been cultivating on my own. Who are you?"  </p><p>This demon was none other than Qin Sang in disguise.  </p><p>Humans were largely unfamiliar with the Demon Realm, and even the Profound Heaven Palace could not provide Qin Sang with accurate information.  </p><p>Qin Sang's search for fragments of the Slaughter Sword meant that he could not overlook the demonic secret realms and the cave abodes of the demon kings, including the two Great Sages. Fortunately, the sword's resonance had a wide range, so he did not need to risk infiltrating these places.  </p><p>Additionally, Qin Sang planned to visit a few "old friends" before leaving the Demon Realm.  </p><p>Elder Tong Lingyu, guided by rumors spread by Wind Master, had located Bi Fang's cave abode.  </p><p>However, Bi Fang was extremely vigilant and had recovered about seventy to eighty percent of his strength. Sensing danger, he fled through a secret passage. Although Elder Tong had noticed in time, Bi Fang ultimately escaped, and only the cunning fox was captured. Under interrogation, the fox revealed the truth, confirming that the sacred artifact was not in their possession.  </p><p>As for the frog fish, its cave abode was extremely well-hidden, and Elder Tong had not even caught a glimpse of it.  </p><p>To accomplish these tasks, Qin Sang needed a detailed map of the Demon Realm.  </p><p>The fastest way to obtain one was directly from a demon king.  </p><p>Most of the demon forces had already been subjugated by the Great Sage Tianpeng, and Qin Sang was unsure if the stag demon was one of Tianpeng's subordinates. If a demon king under Tianpeng's command went missing, it would surely raise alarms.  </p><p>Without having accomplished anything yet, directly capturing or killing a demon king would only invite trouble. Thus, Qin Sang chose to reveal himself and engage in a verbal spar with the stag demon king.</p>
