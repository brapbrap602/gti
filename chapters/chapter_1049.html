<h1>Chapter 141: Blood-Stained Hidden Grotto</h1><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>A crisp sound.</p><p>Though faint, it echoed like a thunderclap in the ears of the cultivators.</p><p>A hairline crack appeared on the protective barrier.</p><p>Everyone's eyes suddenly burned with fervor as they frantically attacked the barrier.</p><p>More and more cracks appeared, yet the protective seal held firm.</p><p>Suddenly, Qin Sang's gaze sharpened.</p><p>He saw Venerable Ye abruptly stop, runes flickering across his body, his aura fluctuating erratically. Su Nü and the others began to converge towards the center.</p><p>“The seal isn't broken yet, is Venerable Ye making his move?”</p><p>This thought flashed through Qin Sang's mind, tightening his heart. He quickly popped a few spirit pills into his mouth and began to rapidly weave hand seals.</p><p>The cultivators stirred restlessly.</p><p>Around the barrier, bursts of mystical light erupted as they began to encircle the seal, poised to strike.</p><p>‘Crack… Crack…’</p><p>More and more cracks spread across the protective barrier.</p><p>Suddenly, a sharp clang resonated in everyone's ears.</p><p>Everyone was startled.</p><p>Immediately after, a blade of light shot up from the ground, instantly descending upon the barrier. The knife’s energy tore through the black mist, flashing before the horrified gazes, then splitting apart.</p><p>The blade’s light was dazzling, unleashing boundless energy.</p><p>Qin Sang's body tensed.</p><p>This attack came from Venerable Ye.</p><p>The moment the blade appeared, Qin Sang understood. Su Nü’s words were true; Venerable Ye had indeed snuck in.</p><p>Only a Nascent Soul Grandmaster could unleash such a terrifying attack.</p><p>“Get out of my way!”</p><p>A furious roar followed the blade.</p><p>Like thunder exploding beside their ears, the cultivators were terrified.</p><p>The blade fell from the sky, swift as lightning.</p><p>The cultivators closest to the barrier bore the brunt of the attack. Blood Bat, Daoist Xiaoyun, and other sects’ core disciples were among them.</p><p>They were the most elite Foundation Establishment cultivators of the Canglang Sea, each determined to obtain the Soul Cleansing Liquid. If the supply hadn't been unexpectedly small, they were almost certain to secure a bottle each.</p><p>Now, standing at the forefront, they had inadvertently given Venerable Ye the perfect opportunity to eliminate them all at once.</p><p>Taking out the leaders would leave the remaining cultivators disorganized and unable to mount a coordinated attack, allowing for a smooth retreat.</p><p>The attack was completely unexpected.  Everyone's attention was fixated on the Soul Cleansing Liquid, and no one anticipated a hidden predator among them.</p><p>In this moment, Blood Bat and the others were horrified.</p><p>Locked onto by the terrifying blade, they froze, feeling as if trapped in quicksand.</p><p>Their hair stood on end, their faces ashen.</p><p>These individuals had some understanding of each other's strengths. No matter how strong, their power was finite.</p><p>“Nascent Soul…”</p><p>Someone stammered, teeth chattering.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>Another roared in anger and terror.</p><p>This attack was so powerful it could cleave them in two.</p><p>Blood Bat was enraged, his expression contorted, but he felt a wave of helplessness.</p><p>He didn't understand how such a powerful opponent could exist within the Trial Grounds, which supposedly had restrictions on Nascent Soul cultivators. But regardless of the opponent's true cultivation level, the power of the blade was undeniable.</p><p>With their lives threatened, no one cared about the Soul Cleansing Liquid anymore.</p><p>Blood Bat only sought to survive.</p><p>But the blade was as fast as lightning. He only had time to frantically channel his True Essence into his inner armor.</p><p>‘Snap!’</p><p>The armor barely held for a moment before shattering under the force of the blade.</p><p>Blood Bat refused to surrender. Employing a secret technique, he erupted with blood energy, a blood bat’s shadow reappearing and flapping its wings as it soared upwards, enveloping the blade like a curtain of blood.</p><p>‘Rip!’</p><p>The blood bat’s shadow was cleaved in two without a sound.</p><p>Blood Bat's body shuddered violently.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>His scream sent chills down everyone's spines.</p><p>He plummeted from the sky, his blood raining down, mixed with fragments of bone and flesh. He fell like a tattered rag. His final desperate technique had bought him time, saving him from instant death, but he was gravely injured, his years of accumulated blood energy completely depleted.</p><p>Sensing the power of the blade, Daoist Xiaoyun's expression turned grim.</p><p>He didn’t choose direct confrontation like Blood Bat. Instead, he swiftly retrieved a palm-sized wooden carving from his storage pouch.</p><p>The carving was exquisite, complete with limbs, but its face was blank, devoid of features.</p><p>As he withdrew the carving, Daoist Xiaoyun forced out a drop of his blood essence and infused it into the wood. The carving's face rippled, features forming, becoming an exact replica of Daoist Xiaoyun’s face.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The blade descended.</p><p>Daoist Xiaoyun offered no resistance, allowing himself to be split in two.</p><p>In the next moment, something strange happened.</p><p>His ‘corpse’ vanished into thin air. A ripple appeared in the nearby void, and Daoist Xiaoyun reappeared, holding the wooden carving, which now bore an identical wound.</p><p>He appeared unharmed, yet his aura was weak, his face pale and bloodless. Clearly, using the carving came at a steep price, leaving him in no better condition than Blood Bat.</p><p>The others fared even worse, limbs severed, wounds horrific, their lives hanging by a thread.</p><p>With a single strike, Venerable Ye crippled Blood Bat and the others, staining the hidden grotto with blood.</p><p>One side had planned meticulously, the other was completely unprepared, and the vast difference in their power made the outcome inevitable.</p><p>Witnessing this scene, the cultivators on the periphery retreated in terror.</p><p>“Out of respect for your sects, I’ll spare your lives! Anyone who dares to approach will face my wrath!”</p><p>Venerable Ye snorted coldly, changing his hand seals. The remaining blade energy abruptly converged, slamming into the protective barrier.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The already fractured barrier shattered.</p><p>The seal was broken!</p><p>The Soul Cleansing Liquid was within reach, yet no one dared to move, the fate of Blood Bat and the others fresh in their minds.</p><p>Under everyone's gaze, Venerable Ye conjured a spectral hand and reached for the platform. With a few clinks, he snatched the four bottles of Soul Cleansing Liquid, pulling them towards him.</p><p>Seeing the cultivators cowed and the Soul Cleansing Liquid almost in his grasp, a smile spread across Venerable Ye’s face. It froze abruptly.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>A deafening boom erupted from the depths of the grotto, illuminating it like daylight.</p><p>An overwhelmingly violent aura descended!</p><p>Venerable Ye looked up sharply, his expression drastically changing.</p><p>Not far away, Qin Sang, his expression calm, hand forming a lightning seal, unleashed the Lightning Control Technique without hesitation, aiming directly at Venerable Ye!</p><p>This attack had shocked Qin Sang as well.</p><p>The chasm between Foundation Establishment and Nascent Soul was indeed vast.</p><p>If not for Venerable Ye's restricted cultivation, Qin Sang wouldn't have dared to provoke him, forced to watch helplessly as he took the Soul Cleansing Liquid, hoping to find another way to trade with Su Nü.</p><p>When Venerable Ye attacked, Qin Sang had watched him intently, not missing a single detail.</p><p>He confirmed that, as Su Nü had said, Venerable Ye only had the power for a single strike after unsealing his cultivation. After the attack, strange fluctuations appeared in the void as the Trial Grounds suppressed him, his aura plummeting drastically.</p><p>However, the other cultivators were terrified by the fierce blade and Venerable Ye’s deception, so no one had noticed.</p>
