<h1>Chapter 775: Crimson Red</h1><p>The mountain path was rugged and rocky.</p><p>The terrain was treacherous, and out of caution, Qin Sang chose not to fly.</p><p>Although marked on the map, the landscape wasn't static.</p><p>For example, the lairs of fierce beasts shifted with each opening of this realm, and the beasts themselves often fought amongst each other.  It wasn't uncommon for careless cultivators to stumble into a beast's lair.</p><p>The number of cultivators who perished in the jaws of beasts was no less than those who fell victim to the realm's restrictions.</p><p>The Twin-Headed Wolf kept a vigilant watch alongside Qin Sang.  It was particularly sensitive to the presence of beasts.</p><p>Soon, Qin Sang reached the summit. With a flicker, he concealed himself amongst the scattered rocks and surveyed the path ahead.</p><p>He had chosen a secluded route, and hadn't seen any signs of other travelers on his way up.  The forest ahead appeared tranquil and deserted.</p><p>The mountains beyond rose ever higher, one after another.  He could only proceed step by step.</p><p>He and the Twin-Headed Wolf descended into a valley, then began another ascent.  After traversing three more mountains without incident, their pace quickened.</p><p>"Finally..."</p><p>Qin Sang stood atop the mountain, gazing intently at the sea of clouds beyond the peaks, murmuring to himself.</p><p>At the horizon, deep within the clouds, the towering silhouette of a pagoda flickered in and out of view.</p><p>A golden radiance emanated from the depths of the cloud sea, as if a great sun were hidden within.</p><p>The swirling clouds shifted constantly, and coupled with the distance, Qin Sang could only discern the middle section of the Heavenly Pagoda, its peak lost in the clouds.</p><p>From afar, bathed in the golden light, the Heavenly Pagoda seemed surrounded by countless auspicious birds and divine beasts, exuding an otherworldly aura that captivated Qin Sang and filled him with awe.</p><p>He looked up into the white clouds.</p><p>Had he truly fallen from there?</p><p>Filled with doubt, he stared for a long while, but saw nothing beyond the vast clouds.  No wonder the cultivators at the base of the pagoda had mistaken him for an ancient corpse.</p><p>"Let's go!"</p><p>Qin Sang withdrew his gaze and patted the Twin-Headed Wolf, resuming his journey.</p><p>…</p><p>A great river surged through the valley between two mountains, its currents crashing against the cliffs, sending up white sprays of water.</p><p>Waterfalls cascaded down the cliff faces, their deafening roar echoing through the mountains, masking all other sounds.</p><p>Qin Sang and the Twin-Headed Wolf lay hidden in the undergrowth, gazing up at the damp cliff face ahead, not daring to make a sound.</p><p>The mist created by the waterfall's spray provided ample cover.</p><p>They were focused on a fissure in the cliff from which white-feathered, red-tailed cranes occasionally emerged to circle before returning to the crevice.</p><p>From Qin Sang's position, he could partially see inside the fissure.</p><p>It was the cranes' nest, and there were about a dozen of them inside.</p><p>Each one had the same appearance.</p><p>The adult cranes, with their long tail feathers, measured about ten feet in length.</p><p>Qin Sang recognized them as Red-tailed Cranes, a type of fierce beast unique to the Seven Kills Sect.  Known for their aggressive nature and razor-sharp talons, their slender build belied their surprisingly powerful bodies.</p><p>Even late-stage Core Formation cultivators would flee from a flock of adult Red-tailed Cranes.</p><p>Red-tailed Cranes preferred forested habitats, typically nesting in the dense branches of ancient trees, often dominating vast stretches of woodland.</p><p>Their hidden nests often led unsuspecting cultivators to trespass into their territory.</p><p>Strangely, this flock had chosen to nest in a rocky fissure, an environment they usually avoided.  Qin Sang had nearly been discovered by the cranes earlier and quickly concealed himself.</p><p>Anyone else seeing so many Red-tailed Cranes would have fled without a second thought.</p><p>Emboldened by his skill, Qin Sang risked a closer look and discovered the reason for their unusual nesting site.</p><p>An old vine grew from deep within the fissure, clinging to the rock face.</p><p>Hanging from the vine were several crimson fruits.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't identify the spiritual fruit.</p><p>But it must have been extraordinary to entice an entire flock of Red-tailed Cranes to relocate. Intrigued, Qin Sang crept closer with the Twin-Headed Wolf to assess the possibility of stealing the fruit.</p><p>If he encountered a realm protected by ancient restrictions, it would take time to break them.  No matter how valuable the treasures inside, he would prioritize reaching the Heavenly Pagoda.</p><p>Snatching the fruit and fleeing wouldn't take long.</p><p>And since he was familiar with Red-tailed Cranes, he was confident he could escape them.  The fruits were so enticingly red, it would be a shame to leave them behind.</p><p>Many areas within the Seven Kills Sect held spiritual herbs and fruits, but they were either heavily guarded by restrictions or fierce beasts.  Whether one could obtain them depended entirely on their strength.</p><p>Such opportunities were rare and shouldn't be missed.</p><p>Regardless of the fruit's properties or maturity, having it in hand wouldn't hurt.</p><p>Qin Sang retreated quietly, surveyed the surrounding terrain, and returned to his original spot. He instructed the Twin-Headed Wolf to repeat its usual trick: lure the enemy.</p><p>Qin Sang was well-versed in this tactic, using his escape technique to his advantage.</p><p>The Twin-Headed Wolf hesitated. These Red-tailed Cranes were clearly much stronger than the beasts at the bottom of the cliff.  If caught, it might not survive.</p><p>"Jump into the river when you flee. They won't be able to find you there.  Meet me downstream. Once I identify the fruit, I'll share one with you."</p><p>Qin Sang whispered his promise.</p><p>The Twin-Headed Wolf nudged its furry head against Qin Sang, its two vertical pupils staring intently.</p><p>It highly doubted this man's sincerity.</p><p>Ever since it was captured, it had been treated like a laborer, doing all the dirty work without any reward. Its status was even lower than that fat worm who did nothing but eat and sleep.</p><p>If not for the man's oath to grant it freedom, it would have abandoned him long ago.</p><p>Qin Sang glared at it. "Aren't you afraid it's poisonous and will kill you? The beasts here are all abnormal. If you want to end up like them, be my guest!"</p><p>Recalling the chaotic battle in the wasteland, the Twin-Headed Wolf flinched and leaped from the undergrowth.</p><p>Agile and swift, it landed on the cliff face, its sharp claws digging deep into the rock before propelling itself upward.</p><p>At the same moment, the Red-tailed Cranes within the fissure spotted the Twin-Headed Wolf and let out piercing shrieks.</p><p>*Whoosh, whoosh…*</p><p>Several adult cranes burst from the fissure, diving down like lightning.</p><p>A gust of wind swept past.</p><p>The Red-tailed Cranes exuded a menacing aura, their sharp talons glinting. The Twin-Headed Wolf, sensing the danger, flickered and split into multiple illusory forms, darting towards different parts of the cliff face, all with the same objective.</p><p>The Red-tailed Cranes, momentarily unable to distinguish the real from the illusory, divided their forces to intercept the phantoms.</p><p>They failed to notice a figure stealthily scaling the cliff face in the distance, moving with remarkable speed.</p><p>*Thud, thud…*</p><p>As the illusory forms were dispelled one by one, the Twin-Headed Wolf found itself cornered. Seeing the futility of its efforts, it flipped its body and leaped from the cliff, landing on the ground and fleeing at full speed.</p><p>The enraged Red-tailed Cranes pursued relentlessly.</p><p>By then, the figure had already reached the top of the cliff.</p>
