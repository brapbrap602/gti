<h1>Chapter 1368: From Elsewhere</h1><p>"Ghost Mother…"</p><p>Qin Sang mused.</p><p>Tan Hao claimed to be under the Ghost Mother's command.</p><p>The Ghost Mother should be the mysterious person Tan Hao rescued from the Water Prison.</p><p>The Ghost Mother was trapped in the Water Prison, drawing her own bones to refine a bone array, surviving until this era.</p><p>Even if the Ghost Mother possessed strength comparable to the Jade Bone Demon, Qin Sang wouldn't be surprised. He was estimating the mysterious person as high as possible, which was why he was so cautious.</p><p>Among the Nascent Soul cultivators Qin Sang knew in the Northern Chen Domain, there wasn't such a person.</p><p>In the major events that had occurred in the Northern Chen Domain over the past hundred years—the great battles between domains, the ascension of the Purple Micro Palace, the establishment of the Northern Chen Alliance—almost no one in the cultivation world could remain aloof.</p><p>Behind these events, Qin Sang hadn't discovered the shadow of any mysterious forces either.</p><p>"The title is a bit strange. Since she permitted Tan Hao to rescue her, she shouldn't be an utterly heinous villain…"</p><p>Qin Sang pondered secretly.</p><p>But judging solely from this one incident was too one-sided to reach a conclusion.</p><p>Tan Hao had been missing for too long, without a trace. His circumstances were unpredictable.</p><p>The good news was that Tan Hao was still alive.</p><p>Mei Gu and Li Yufu stood silently to the side, not daring to disturb Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered for a while, then sat down cross-legged, mobilized his divine sense, covering the entire village, searching carefully, but didn't find any traces left by cultivators.</p><p>The demon disturbance had occurred over a hundred years ago. The witnesses at that time were all mortals, who had long since passed away, leaving behind only legends passed down by word of mouth.</p><p>Qin Sang used Mei Gu's method to ask a few people, and their stories were largely the same.</p><p>The content of the legends was bound to be exaggerated, speaking of the heavens collapsing, the earth splitting, the sky darkening, and the sun dimming, and so on.</p><p>It was impossible to judge Tan Hao's strength at that time.</p><p>Qin Sang searched the island thoroughly again, confirming that it was impossible for any cultivator to choose to cultivate here.</p><p>"It seems that Tan Hao happened to be present at the time, intervening to help those in need (acting out of a sense of justice). I wonder if they were secretly cultivating nearby, or merely passing through. If they were passing through, where were they going?"</p><p>Qin Sang flew into the air.</p><p>The sea area was vast and unobstructed.</p><p>He first glanced to the north, then his gaze turned, staring in the direction of the storm belt.</p><p>"Could it be that they have already left the Northern Chen Domain? Only this can explain why the Ghost Mother didn't appear in the Purple Micro Palace. Otherwise, with the appearance of the Connecting Platform (Ascension Platform), the Ghost Mother would definitely be as eager as Bai and the Jade Bone Demon to escape this cage."</p><p>Li Yufu and Mei Gu flew up.</p><p>Qin Sang looked at Mei Gu, "Where is that Senior's cave abode?"</p><p>After Mei Gu discovered Tan Hao's statue, she had been guarding this place, putting her own affairs aside.</p><p>Li Yufu was taken aback, then smiled and cupped his fist, "Congratulations, Junior Sister!"</p><p>Mei Gu also revealed a delighted expression. With the Master personally taking action, everything would surely be foolproof.</p><p>The next day, the three arrived at a deserted sea area.</p><p>Qin Sang held a piece of Xuanhuang Jade in his hand.</p><p>The jade shimmered with a faint light, clearly visible in the night. The Xuanhuang light was attracted by something, ultimately pointing here, beneath the seawater.</p><p>Qin Sang spent a full day determining the location of the Senior's cave abode. If Mei Gu were on her own, it would probably take at least several months.</p><p>He dove into the sea, sinking rapidly.</p><p>Before long, they saw a mountain peak protruding from the water below.</p><p>The mountain was overgrown with aquatic plants, desolate and barren, but the Xuanhuang Jade was pointing directly at this mountain.</p><p>Qin Sang summoned the Heavenly Eye Butterfly, quickly locking onto a cliff face covered in algae.</p><p>Landing in front of the cliff face, Qin Sang examined it carefully for a while, then flicked his finger, sending out a ray of lightning.</p><p>The lightning struck the cliff face, causing a patch of rubble to fall off. It looked nothing out of the ordinary, but after waiting for a while, a subtle fluctuation suddenly appeared where the rubble had fallen, and it returned to its original state!</p><p>Qin Sang pondered for a moment, then suddenly summoned the Golden Sun Sword.</p><p>In an instant, the sword light was dazzling, and the seawater boiled.</p><p>Mei Gu and Li Yufu narrowed their eyes in unison, feeling the power of this sword, their eyes filled with reverence and envy, but immediately afterwards they noticed something was wrong.</p><p>The two exchanged glances, revealing expressions of surprise and shock.</p><p>"Congratulations, Uncle-Master…"</p><p>"Congratulations, Master…"</p><p>Amidst the two's congratulations, the Golden Sun Sword fiercely slashed at the cliff face.</p><p>The scene of the cliff face collapsing as expected didn't appear. After a wave of fluctuations, a black barrier was revealed. The Golden Sun Sword directly pierced through the cliff face, leaving a crack.</p><p>Black light surged from the crack, as if there was a vortex.</p><p>"Enter!"</p><p>Qin Sang said in a low voice, then flashed inside. Li Yufu and Mei Gu suppressed their excitement and hurriedly followed.</p><p>The Xuanhuang Jade wasn't a token; they could only force their way through the cave abode's guardian spirit formation.</p><p>'Rumble…'</p><p>Heavenly thunder, earthly fire, stone knives, ice arrows.</p><p>They came crashing down like the heavens were falling.</p><p>The power of the guardian spirit formation was extraordinary. Mei Gu and Li Yufu were both secretly shocked. If they had entered alone, they could probably only hold out for a few breaths at most, and there would be no possibility of breaking through the formation.</p><p>At this moment, the spirit formation's attacks couldn't harm them in the slightest.</p><p>The Golden Sun Sword hovered above their heads.</p><p>Qin Sang walked with his hands behind his back, his expression leisurely.</p><p>Sword energy formed a layer of barrier around the three of them, firmly protecting them. Qin Sang continuously changed direction, but no matter how the formation changed, it couldn't stop his footsteps.</p><p>Before long, all attacks suddenly disappeared, and the surroundings instantly became deathly silent.</p><p>The spiritual energy here was rich, a world apart.</p><p>They were standing in a courtyard. It was clear at a glance that it had been abandoned for a long time, but fortunately the entire cave abode was intact, the doors tightly closed.</p><p>Qin Sang once again took action to break the restrictions, searching around and finding a few magical artifacts and jade slips, as well as a patch of medicinal field, but there were no precious spiritual herbs.</p><p>"Tidal Control Art (Tidal Surge Formula)… take it back and put it in the inner sect."</p><p>Qin Sang examined the jade slip and found that it was a good cultivation technique, throwing it to Li Yufu.</p><p>As for those magical artifacts, they were all difficult for Qin Sang to take seriously, so he bestowed them upon his two disciples.</p><p>"Thank you, Master, for bestowing treasures!"</p><p>Mei Gu took a pair of Fire Ru Yi (Fire Scepter) and a set of needle-shaped magical artifacts, happily giving a salute.</p><p>Li Yufu also obtained a golden sword, its power extraordinary.</p><p>After sending away the two disciples, Qin Sang took action to clean up the cave abode, using it as a temporary place to stay.</p><p>In the months that followed.</p><p>Qin Sang concealed his identity and secretly investigated.</p><p>He had investigated the sea area around the island countless times, and later expanded the scope, entering and exiting the major trading markets in the desert, but he still gained nothing.</p><p>Tan Hao and the Ghost Mother were like a flash in the pan (a fleeting moment); besides that, he couldn't find any traces.</p><p>…</p><p>Heavenly Journey Plateau.</p><p>Today was the day of the Northern Chen Alliance's council meeting. The location of the council rotated through the various domains, and this time it was the Heavenly Journey Plateau's turn.</p><p>Inside the Ice Crystal Palace.</p><p>The Yue brothers, Yue Kui and Yue Wu, personally presided over the meeting.</p><p>Nascent Soul cultivators from other domains were also present. The Demon Clan's Snake King and Jing Yu were both there, but the Human Clan only had Fairy Qiu Zhi, a mid-Nascent Soul cultivator.</p><p>The matters discussed were largely the same, nothing more than the Connecting Platform, the Ancient Immortal Battlefield, and the Abyss Ruins, and by the way, holding a small trade fair to exchange information.</p><p>In addition, there were also some disciples from famous sects who came on behalf of their elders.</p><p>Laughter came from inside the Ice Crystal Palace, and they were talking happily.</p><p>Just then, a beam of light, without any concealment, arrived in an instant, suddenly landing in front of the Ice Crystal Palace.</p><p>Everyone sensed something and looked over, seeing that it was Qin Sang, and they were all greatly surprised.</p><p>"Venerable Qin! Esteemed guest…"</p><p>Yue Wu greeted with a smiling face, but suddenly froze, his face filled with disbelief.</p>
