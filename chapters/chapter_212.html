Chapter 205 Taking Shelter in a Cave

"Fellow Daoist Yin, my apologies. I got sidetracked by a small matter and almost missed the time..."

The celestial phenomena had stabilized, and the entrance to the secret realm was about to open when Mu Yifeng arrived.

Qin Sang was surprised to see Mu Yifeng smiling. It seemed like he had encountered something delightful. It was the first time Qin Sang had seen Mu Yifeng smile since entering the Ancient Immortal Battlefield.

At that moment, a thousand waves suddenly surged from the end of the river with a 'whoosh'. The water flow split into two streams, crossing each other to form an archway. One could only see a vast expanse of white beyond the archway.

Yin Xingge said, not minding, "It is well that Fellow Daoist Mu arrived on time. It is time to set off."

Everyone immediately boarded a small boat. When Qin Sang was about to board, his figure suddenly paused. He glanced at Mu Yifeng, who gave him a wink.

Qin Sang hesitated for a moment and nodded slightly before boarding the boat as if nothing had happened.

The wooden boat sailed through the waves and quickly entered the archway. Then, everyone's body sank, and the scenery before their eyes changed drastically. They were already standing in a barren desert.

The狂风 from before seemed to have never existed. Standing on the sand dune, one could see an endless view of vast yellow sand. The scene was unusually calm. The heat distorted the air, making even these cultivators uncomfortable.

Yin Xingge took out the map, glanced at it, and pointed in the northwest direction, saying to Mu Yifeng and Qin Sang, "Junior Sister Yunqiong and I will lead the way. Two fellow Daoists, please stay at the rear."

Mu Yifeng and Qin Sang had no objections, so everyone fixed their formation and sped forward.

More than twenty cultivators came out of the secret realm one after another and gathered at the entrance, all of them very wary of Qin Sang and the others. After all, in the Ancient Immortal Battlefield, it was not uncommon to travel thousands of miles without seeing another person. Outside the towns and market towns, killing and stealing treasures was rampant, with the celestial phenomena and Spirit Beasts helping to destroy the corpses and evidence, making it impossible to find the murderer, even with their great supernatural powers.

Some of the more wicked cultivators even formed a group and, in the name of treasure-hunting, committed acts of robbery. They dared to rob and kill even the disciples of the three major sects. The Skull-Hanging Guards had wiped out many of them, hanging their skulls outside the fortresses, but they still couldn't put an end to it.

The ten of Qin Sang were already a formidable force, so it was only natural that the other cultivators were worried.

They waited until their figures disappeared in the distance, then looked at each other before dispersing.

...

The scope of this desert was beyond imagination. They walked for five days without seeing its end.

It was noon, and the sun was shining brightly.

At that moment, a gust of wind suddenly blew through the desert. At first, there was only a faint mist of dust, but gradually the sand and gravel began to roll. The sky turned a dull yellow, and the temperature in the desert dropped sharply, even becoming somewhat bone-chilling.

A wave of fluctuation suddenly appeared on a sand dune, then ten people appeared from nowhere. It was Qin Sang and his companions.

The desert was too vast a target. They were using their escape technique to travel, so when they stopped, they all frowned and looked at the worsening sandstorm around them.

"The celestial phenomena calmed down only five days ago. Why is it back so soon?"

散人 Yunqiong looked worried. There were very few places of refuge in the middle area. They had just left Gubai Town and were still far from other towns and market towns. Moreover, they were now in the desert, with nothing to hide behind, making them easy prey for a siege by Spirit Beasts.

Over the past five days, they had encountered Spirit Beasts more than once, and they could clearly feel that the Spirit Beasts here were a level stronger than before. One of the Spirit Beasts was even stronger than Yin Xingge. Fortunately, they were quick to react and had avoided it in advance.

Yin Xingge said in a deep voice, "The celestial phenomena are already unpredictable. Now that we have entered the middle area, it is not uncommon for them to occur frequently. Everyone, let's go all out and try to find a hiding place. Otherwise, we can only dig a cave in the sand to hide..."

Before he could finish speaking, a Qi Refining shadow guard suddenly shouted in surprise, "Senior Yin, the map shows a shelter ahead."

Everyone hurriedly took out the map and saw that there was indeed a shelter marked not far ahead. However, it was not a market town, but a small shelter built by passersby. The distance was not too far, and they could reach it in five or six hours if they traveled at full speed.

Yin Xingge pondered, "Such a shelter may not last long, but it's worth taking a look. Time is of the essence. Fellow Daoist Mu, Fellow Daoist Qin, the three of us will activate the astrolabe. Junior Sister Yunqiong, take everyone and use the flying magic weapon to travel as quickly as possible."

In this critical moment, Mu Yifeng and Qin Sang naturally had no objections and readily agreed.

Yin Xingge reached into his mustard seed bag and took out a huge astrolabe with a diameter of one zhang. The round astrolabe was entirely black. The surface was dotted with fluorescence, as beautiful as a piece of starry sky.

Qin Sang was already very familiar with the magic formula to control the astrolabe.

As Yin Xingge tossed the astrolabe up, Qin Sang and the other two immediately sat cross-legged under the astrolabe, activated the magic formula, and poured their spiritual power into the astrolabe.

"Buzz!"

The astrolabe trembled slightly and the starlight on it became brighter. Then, a strange aura spread out from the astrolabe, which was exactly the same as the aura of the cloud beast's soul.

The aura enveloped them and completely masked their immortal cultivator's aura, misleading the cloud beasts without revealing a trace. It was much more effective than the handkerchief Qin Sang had bought.

Unfortunately, such cloud vessels were expensive and could not be used for long. Otherwise, they would have already begun to mine the Dry Sun Stone Crystal.

As soon as the Loose Cultivator Yun Qiong flicked his finger, a two-pointed flying shuttle elongated in the wind and shot out a colorful cloud, wrapping Qin Sang and the others into the flying shuttle.

The other six also quickly boarded.

"Whoosh!"

Loose Cultivator Yun Qiong didn't dare to fly the shuttle too high. They almost flew along the sand dune, but their speed was much faster than before. They tried their best to avoid the cloud beasts along the way and arrived at the location marked on the geomantic map in half the time.

Someone pointed in a direction and shouted, "Over there!"

The crowd looked up and saw a small hill suddenly appeared in the center of the desert, which was made up of bare, giant rocks.

The hill was not high and wasn't buried by the quicksand. It was a very obvious landmark.

At this time, the sandstorm was raging, the celestial phenomenon was becoming more and more intense, and the cloud beasts were becoming more active. Loose Cultivator Yun Qiong didn't dare to delay and quickly controlled the flying shuttle to turn around, and it flickered and landed in front of the hill.

Yin Xingge put away his astrolabe, swept across the hill with his divine sense, and his eyes lit up immediately. "There are restrictions."

Everyone was overjoyed when they heard it. They flew up the hill one after another and saw a cave hidden by a huge rock halfway up the mountainside, extending all the way to the underground.

There was no one in the cave. There were countless restrictions from the entrance, which were obviously set by different people. As they walked down, they also took the opportunity to make up for the weaknesses of the restrictions, making the shelter stronger. Helping the later people was also helping themselves.
