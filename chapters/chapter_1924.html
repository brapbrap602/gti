<h1>Chapter 1915: The City God Temple</h1><p>Such a master, if from Yun Du Tian, would be no surprise.</p><p>Yun Du Tian's purge of demons and monsters must have a deeper meaning. The Fire Region needs to prepare in advance and understand Yun Du Tian's intentions.</p><p>"Daoist Fu, you're overthinking."</p><p>Qin Sang didn't look back, walking further and further away.</p><p>Fu Xiao watched the departing figure, hesitant, ultimately choosing not to follow.</p><p>…</p><p>Soon after, the cultivators belatedly realized that the once rampant sand bandits had suddenly disappeared.</p><p>As survivors were discovered and news spread, the story of the sand bandits' eradication gradually spread throughout the desert and the Fire Region.</p><p>Some curious individuals, emboldened, investigated the three mountain bandit strongholds, finding corpses everywhere and mountain walls smeared with blood, detailing the bandits' crimes.</p><p>In broad daylight, it was as grim as the underworld.</p><p>These people took one look and hurried down the mountain, not daring to linger, each recalling the scene with lingering fear.</p><p>Then more news emerged: some prominent sects had internal traitors who colluded with the sand bandits, and they were also purged; some even had their mountain gates destroyed.</p><p>Most of these sects chose to close their gates and kept silent about the matter.</p><p>Surprisingly, the three major sects of the Fire Region didn't react at all.</p><p>This turmoil gradually subsided, and no one ever learned who was responsible.</p><p>Long afterwards, many cultivators still appreciated the mysterious person's righteous actions.</p><p>The plight of the sand bandits frightened those with ill intentions, and for a long time, no one dared to stir up trouble in the desert; the atmosphere in the cultivation world improved significantly.</p><p>Only a few sporadic waves of sand bandits appeared a hundred years later, quickly annihilated by a joint effort of the major sects.</p><p>…</p><p>Crossing the desert and entering the Gobi, they finally saw a touch of green.</p><p>Beyond the Gobi were rolling mountains and endless barren hills, where not only mortals could not live, but even cultivators were rarely seen.</p><p>A white cloud drifted lazily by.</p><p>Standing on the cloud, Qin Sang looked at the scenery below and suddenly said, "Look at the direction of these rivers. A few hundred miles further south, there are people. Then we'll find a boat and sail south."</p><p>Luo Hou had no objections; since dismounting, it had faithfully performed its duties as a mount.</p><p>Zhu Que suddenly became excited, flapping its wings up and down, repeatedly asking, "Are there really so many delicious things in the mortal world?"</p><p>Along the way, Qin Sang explained the ways of the world to Xiao Wu, remembering Xiao Wu's interest in the food of the Gathering Immortals Tower, so she spoke of it.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Zhu Que overheard.</p><p>"In terms of refined seasoning and precious ingredients, mortals can't compare to cultivators. But food is essential to the people, and different places have different customs, which will always allow you to discover new and interesting things…"</p><p>As they spoke, the white cloud passed over the mountains. Qin Sang noticed that the mountains ahead were gradually becoming gentler, the river wider, and man-made structures appearing on the riverbank.  She said, "There are people ahead. Let's go down."</p><p>Qin Sang cast an illusion; the white cloud swooped down and landed directly on a mountain path by the riverbank.</p><p>The river current was relatively gentle. There was a simple wooden dock on each bank, with obviously decayed wooden piles submerged in the water, showing their age.</p><p>From each dock, a large road extended inland, narrowing as it went, eventually branching into several small paths that disappeared into the hills and forests.</p><p>Two covered boats were tied up at the docks, clearly meant for passengers, suggesting a clear division of labor.</p><p>The owner of the boat on the east side was a thin old man, busily carrying materials onto the boat, fetching water and cleaning. The owner of the boat on the west was strong and sturdy, leaning against the bow, legs crossed, squinting in the sun.</p><p>It wasn't time for the boats to leave yet, but there were passengers waiting on both sides.</p><p>The old man kept smiling apologetically at the passengers, repeatedly saying, "Almost ready! Almost ready!"</p><p>The passengers didn't mind, and some even offered to help.</p><p>The strong man didn't bother talking to the passengers, so no one interacted with him. The passengers looked towards the east bank with some envy.</p><p>Getting slightly closer to the boat, one could smell a sour odor from inside, but they didn't dare complain in front of the strong man, only secretly pinching their noses, worried about the upcoming journey.</p><p>Qin Sang naturally chose the eastern boat, landing on a mountain path on the east bank and walking with her horse.</p><p>"Look, a Daoist is coming."</p><p>"Where did a Daoist come from here?"</p><p>"Wow, what a pretty girl. Is she asleep on the horse?"</p><p>…</p><p>The passengers on the bank discussed Qin Sang as she approached.</p><p>As Qin Sang drew closer, the passengers fell silent, showing friendly smiles; some even gave an awkward Daoist bow.</p><p>The gods are watching, so it's always best to treat Daoists politely, regardless of their abilities.</p><p>A Taoist priest, his robes flowing with an almost ethereal air, stood before them.  He looked every bit the wise sage.</p><p>“Boatman,” Qin Sang said softly, “My horse is tired. Could you possibly make an exception?”</p><p>The covered boat was spacious enough to comfortably accommodate a horse.</p><p>“Well…” the old man said, setting down his firewood and rubbing his hands, looking somewhat troubled. “I could waive the fare for the Daoist master, but the horse…”</p><p>Though the boat wasn’t crowded at the moment, the river journey downriver would stop at several wharves before reaching Beiku County.  Only these two boats plied that route.  Villagers relied on them to reach the town, and the boats often filled to capacity halfway through their journey.</p><p>“No need to waive the fare,” Qin Sang offered, producing several copper coins.  (He had no copper coins; he'd exchanged a silver ingot for them from the old man's till.) “We’ll let the horse rest, and disembark when more people come aboard.  Is that alright?”</p><p>“No, no, the fare really isn’t necessary!” the old man insisted, refusing the money.</p><p>Soon, the sun climbed high. The old man neatly stacked his firewood and called for passengers to board.  With roughly equal numbers of people on both banks, Qing Ma boarded, causing the boat to noticeably settle.  The boatman to the west untied the reins, grasped his oar, and with a powerful stroke, the covered boat sliced through the water, its speed rivaling a fast boat, leaving a white wake far behind them.</p><p>The old man wasn’t in a hurry. He rowed leisurely, chatting and laughing with the passengers.  Their eyes frequently drifted towards the stern where Qin Sang and Xiao Wu sat on the ground, Zhu Que dozing on Qin Sang's shoulder, and Qing Ma standing nearby.</p><p>The unusual sight piqued everyone’s curiosity, yet no one dared approach, fearing they might inadvertently offend the Taoist. They assumed Qin Sang was a man of considerable spiritual power; otherwise, why would he travel with a young girl?</p><p>The river didn't flow directly south.  After a while, it veered west, narrowing and becoming more turbulent, making the old man's work easier.</p><p>Soon, a second wharf came into view. Only three people were there, including a boy of about ten, a large bundle at his feet. Seeing the boat, he excitedly waved.</p><p>“Grandpa… Grandpa…”</p><p>The child’s high-pitched voice brought a smile to the old man’s face. He rowed quickly, pulling alongside the bank. “Son, did you get it?”</p><p>“Yep!” the boy nodded vigorously. “Uncle Zhao said the harvest was good this year. He made lots of cured meat. It smells so good!”</p><p>The boy hoisted the bundle onto his back with a grunt, and before the boat fully docked, he hopped aboard in three quick strides, causing the old man to drop his oar and rush to steady him.</p><p>“Now, now!” the old man said, pretending to swat him.</p><p>“Hee hee…” The boy, like an eel, darted into the cabin. Soon, shouts of excitement came from within.</p><p>“Wow! Grandpa caught so many fish today…”</p><p>“Wow! There’s even a yellow-toothed fish!”</p><p>“It’s been so long since I had a yellow-toothed fish! The one last year was so delicious and plump!”</p><p>The boy’s exclamations were punctuated by quick, efficient movements as he moved cooking supplies to the bow, collected fish from the creel, and fetched firewood from the stern.</p><p>“Wow!”  Suddenly spotting Qing Ma, the boy exclaimed, “What a huge, magnificent horse!”</p><p>Which man wouldn't want a magnificent steed, especially one so splendid?  The boy stared at Qing Ma, captivated, before noticing Qin Sang and Xiao Wu.</p><p>When he saw Xiao Wu, he froze, staring for a moment before his face flushed crimson. He grabbed a bundle of firewood, rushed to the bow, and stammered to his grandfather, pointing toward the stern.  “Grandpa, she… is she blind?”</p><p>The old man jumped, glancing cautiously toward the stern.  Seeing no reaction, he breathed a sigh of relief.  “She might just have some eye trouble.  Go cook, I’m hungry.”</p><p>“Oh!” The boy went back to the stove, skillfully preparing a meal, assisted by a man in a green tunic who emerged from the cabin.</p><p>They took a piece of cured meat from the bundle, washed, sliced, and rendered the fat before stewing it with the river fish, the aroma quickly filling the air.</p><p>While working, the boy kept stealing glances towards the stern, his secret admiration easily apparent.  The other passengers smiled kindly, causing the boy to blush again and turn away.</p><p>‘Glug glug…’ The river fish and cured meat soup bubbled in the pot.  The fresh fish, rich meat, and fragrant broth wafted into the cabin, then to the stern.</p><p>Zhu Que instantly perked up, eyes fixed on the bow, as if ready to pounce on a piece of the delicious stew.</p><p>Xiao Wu twitched its little nose and also turned to look, but its face showed no urgency, just watching quietly.</p><p>“This is the everyday life of the world…”</p><p>Qin Sang gazed at the swiftly passing mountain scenery along the riverbanks, sighing.  She had forgotten what the everyday life of the world tasted like.</p><p>The passengers' appetites were piqued, and they took out their prepared rations from their bags, eating small mouthfuls with water.</p><p>At this time, the fish soup was ready.</p><p>It was cooked in a large iron pot, a whole pot full, more than the grandfather and grandson could possibly drink.</p><p>The little boy took a large bamboo tube from the edge of the awning, filled it with fish soup, carefully carried it into the cabin, and gave it to a timid little girl, saying crisply, "Sister, for you."</p><p>"No, no, no…"</p><p>The little girl was flustered, waving her hands repeatedly, trying to stand but afraid of spilling the boy's soup.</p><p>"Drink it! Old Man Chen is a good person. When there's a good catch, he always makes fish soup to share, for free! There's plenty, you can have more if you want."</p><p>A man in a green robe also came in with fish soup, happily sharing it with everyone, and only then did the little girl dare to reach out to take it.</p><p>The bamboo tube contained not only fish soup but also small fish about the size of a thumb. Eating it with the dry food was much tastier than before.</p><p>Taking the opportunity to deliver the soup, the little boy secretly looked at the stern, suddenly realizing Xiao Wu was looking over, his face flushed red, his hand trembling, almost spilling the soup, causing a few startled cries.</p><p>Only then did the little boy realize that Xiao Wu probably couldn't see, but was attracted by the smell of the fish soup.</p><p>"So pitiful."</p><p>The little boy thought to himself. Seeing that Qin Sang and Xiao Wu hadn't taken out any food, his eyes twinkled. He quickly ran to the bow, tugged at his grandfather's clothes, and whispered a few words.</p><p>Seeing his grandfather nod, the little boy jumped up happily, immediately filled two bamboo tubes with fish soup, and placed them beside Qin Sang at the stern, without saying a word, he ran back to the bow, picked up a bowl, scooped up a fish with yellow teeth, licked his lips, gritted his teeth and put it all in, filling it with cured meat and fish, took two cakes, and ran back, breathless.</p><p>"My grandpa sent these to you, eat."</p><p>The little boy didn't dare look at Xiao Wu, but said to Qin Sang and ran away.</p><p>Zhu Que's eyes lit up, staring at a piece of cured meat about to eat it, but Qin Sang knocked it on the head, and it chirped incessantly.</p><p>Qin Sang picked up the bowl, took Xiao Wu, and walked to the bow.</p><p>The little boy was eating voraciously, quickly lowering his head to nibble on his cake.</p><p>"Thank you, boatman."</p><p>Qin Sang bowed in thanks. Seeing the old man repeatedly waving his hands, she smiled, "It's kind of the boatman, but I can't refuse.  However, with meat, there should be wine. I have some unrefined wine, please don't mind."</p><p>As she spoke, Qin Sang reached into her bosom, producing a wine gourd as if by magic, took two thin bamboo tubes, filled them with wine, and handed them to the old man.</p><p>"How can that be…"</p><p>The aroma of the wine was truly tempting.  The old man carefully took the bamboo tube, took a sip, and immediately felt a warmth spread through his limbs, his body feeling three points lighter. The accumulated cold from years of working on the river seemed to be dispelled.</p><p>"Good wine! This wine… isn't cheap, is it?"</p><p>The old man asked softly.</p><p>"I travel around, and need wine to keep warm on the road. I brewed some myself using herbs, it doesn't cost anything," Qin Sang added a piece of cured meat to Xiao Wu's bowl. Xiao Wu gently chewed, savoring the flavor, coarser than that of the Juxian Tower, but different.</p><p>"Oh! It's medicinal wine," the old man glanced at his grandson, somewhat reluctant to drink it.</p><p>His grandson would take over his work someday, and with this wine to ward off the cold, he wouldn't have to suffer the same ailments as him.</p><p>"This wine isn't strong, even a child can drink it; it's good for strengthening the body. Just a little sip each time," Qin Sang stood up, took an empty water skin, and filled it with wine. "No one has appreciated my craft before. Since you like it, boatman, here's some more."</p><p>"Enough! Enough! Thank you, Daoist! Thank you, Daoist!" The old man was overwhelmed.</p><p>The little boy wasn't interested in the wine, and ate heartily. Xiao Wu sat opposite him, and after a while, grew bolder. "Are you finished? Grandpa bought me lots of toys in town, do you want to play?"</p><p>"Play?"</p><p>Xiao Wu tilted its head, looking puzzled.</p><p>"Go on, do what he does," Qin Sang patted Xiao Wu's head.</p><p>Xiao Wu obediently stood up, and the little boy carried out a treasure chest from the cabin, filled with all sorts of toys.</p><p>Qin Sang talked with the old man about rural life, keeping an eye on Xiao Wu.</p><p>"This one! Like this… fun, right?"</p><p>The little boy was overjoyed, taking out each toy, teaching Xiao Wu to play, hand in hand.</p><p>Xiao Wu's expression remained very calm, even after all the toys were played with, it didn't manage a smile.</p><p>The little boy scratched his head, glancing at the side of the boat, he saw a bamboo fishing spear tied to a rope, his eyes lit up, he pulled Xiao Wu's sleeve and ran to the side of the boat.</p><p>"My grandpa made this for me! I speared several fish with it!"</p><p>'Splash!'</p><p>The spear went into the water, and unsurprisingly, missed.</p><p>The little boy pulled the spear back, handed it to Xiao Wu, guiding its aim, his eyes fixed on the river surface. "I'll tell you when to release it… release!"</p><p>'Plop!'</p><p>Bloody water stirred the river's surface.</p><p>The little boy's mouth hung open, his eyes wide.</p><p>Xiao Wu's small face bathed in the sun, and a faint smile played on its lips, pure and flawless.</p><p>Qin Sang slowly furrowed her brows.</p>
