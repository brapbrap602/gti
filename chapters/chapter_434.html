<h1>Chapter 427 Bloodwing Ghost Head Wasps</h1><p>Qin Sang was astonished.</p><p>He and Xie Ying had received completely different orders.</p><p>The Seven-leaf Epiphyllum Xie Ying mentioned was a crucial supplementary ingredient for the Kanli Golden Elixir. Qin Sang only learned this from Qi Yuanshou; Xie Ying and the others were likely unaware of its significance.</p><p>Considering the importance of the Kanli Golden Elixir, this order wasn't surprising.</p><p>It seemed he held a significant position in Qi Yuanshou's eyes.  This backing was now firmly secured.</p><p>Qin Sang was glad he seized the opportunity to connect with Qi Yuanshou. Otherwise, he wouldn't have been able to stay outside so peacefully all these years. He might have ended up like Xie Ying, thrown somewhere as cannon fodder.</p><p>Of course, the relationship between him and Qi Yuanshou was fragile. He wasn't indispensable to Qi Yuanshou, just a convenient tool.</p><p>Qin Sang racked his brains but couldn't figure out what he could do for Qi Yuanshou.</p><p>The only things of value he possessed were a few magical treasures, which he couldn't possibly give away.</p><p>Seeing Xie Ying still complaining, Qin Sang's expression turned serious. He said in a deep voice, "The sect isn't unreasonable. As the situation changes, so do our strategies. When you received your orders, the situation wasn't so tense. What's so strange about that? Master Qi is benevolent and values his disciples. How could he disregard their lives for mere spiritual herbs? Don't speak such pointless words in the future, lest misfortune comes from your mouth!"</p><p>Xie Ying's expression turned solemn. He put away his aggrieved look and bowed respectfully, "Thank you for your guidance, Senior Brother. I've learned my lesson."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded slightly, glanced around at the deep lake, and said, "Junior Brother Xie, Master Qi's secret order doesn't need to be shared with other disciples for now. From now on, you'll arrange for people to keep watch day and night. If anything goes wrong, we can adapt accordingly."</p><p>With Qi Yuanshou's secret order, Xie Ying felt reassured and relaxed. Without Qin Sang's urging, he diligently carried out his command.</p><p>Qin Sang was happy to relax and occupy Xie Ying's cave dwelling.</p><p>The spiritual energy in the cave was decent, barely enough for his cultivation.</p><p>After breaking through to the late stage of Foundation Establishment, Qin Sang frequently traveled between Skydark Pass and Sunny City to investigate the remnants of the Kuiyin Sect. He gained a lot of practical experience and didn't neglect his understanding of Killing Talismans. It was only cultivation time that was lacking.</p><p>Being assigned to guard the herb garden allowed him to focus on cultivation.</p><p>However, Qin Sang wasn't entirely at ease. In the beginning, his cultivation was intermittent. He often stopped to secretly observe Xie Ying and the others.</p><p>Once he confirmed everyone was behaving and there were no unusual movements, he settled into quiet cultivation.</p><p>Seasons changed.</p><p>Two years passed in a blink.</p><p>Since arriving at the herb garden, Qin Sang had left the cave only a handful of times.</p><p>One such occasion was due to a battle near the herb garden between the Heavenly Alliance and cultivators from the Small Cold Region.  It was fierce.</p><p>Xie Ying was deeply worried and hurriedly woke Qin Sang from his meditation.</p><p>Qin Sang had heard of the Heavenly Alliance cultivators before, but this was the first time he witnessed their combat firsthand.</p><p>Both sides were powerful, each with several Foundation Establishment cultivators, including some late-stage masters. It was unclear whether they had chased each other here or met by chance, but a deadly battle erupted near the herb garden.</p><p>Hiding behind the garden's protective formation, Qin Sang watched the entire battle intently.</p><p>After all, these people might be his greatest enemies in the future. Knowing oneself and one's enemy was crucial for victory.</p><p>Through this observation, Qin Sang found the Heavenly Alliance cultivators were quite similar to them. Their fighting methods involved spells, magical artifacts, talismans, and restrictive formations.</p><p>However, the specific cultivation methods differed, resulting in varying levels of power.</p><p>They were all cultivators, with no deep-seated grudges, yet they fought to the death.</p><p>The only thing that caught Qin Sang's attention was a Beast Taming Sect disciple from the Small Cold Region, who commanded a dappled tiger.</p><p>The disciple was only at the mid-stage of Foundation Establishment, but the tiger beneath him was equally powerful, also at the mid-stage of the Spirit Beast realm.</p><p>The tiger's fangs were like swords, its claws like knives. It moved like lightning and wind.</p><p>The combined power of man and beast surprised Qin Sang. This disciple could even hold his own against a late-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator from the Heavenly Alliance.</p><p>Cultivating such a powerful spirit beast wasn't something that could be achieved overnight. It must have required immense effort.</p><p>Witnessing the formidable strength of the spirit beast, Qin Sang felt envious.</p><p>This reminded him of the Bloodwing Ghost Head Wasp nest he obtained in the Boundless Valley, filling him with frustration.</p><p>After leaving the Boundless Valley, Qin Sang had occasionally followed the Golden Core Beast Taming Sect manual, buying herbs, preparing concoctions, and attempting to nurture the Ghost Head Wasps.</p><p>He hadn't invested much effort, just doing it casually.</p><p>Fifteen years later, the Bloodwing Ghost Head Wasp larvae finally emerged from their cocoons, identical in appearance to the ones he had seen before.</p><p>But when Qin Sang tried to tame these wasps, the previous scene repeated itself. Despite being larvae, they possessed fiery tempers and self-destructed without hesitation.</p><p>Absolutely uncompromising!</p><p>Qin Sang was dumbfounded and cursed inwardly.</p><p>After repeated failed attempts, he understood. These Bloodwing Ghost Head Wasps had incredibly chaotic spiritual intelligence, making taming impossible.</p><p>He completely gave up on taming them.</p><p>The Bloodwing Ghost Head Wasps did have an advantage: their combat power was a level higher than regular Ghost Head Wasps.</p><p>Although he hadn't invested much effort, he had still nurtured them for so long.  Qin Sang was reluctant to discard them entirely, so he kept them in his spirit beast pouch.</p><p>Without a way to tame them, there was no value in further cultivation.  Otherwise, they might backfire on him instead of being useful in combat.</p><p>Because of this, Qin Sang didn't waste his Redfire Gilded Sand on them. He planned to use the limited amount he had to cultivate suitable exotic insects in the future.</p><p>The battle raged for a full hour. Although the location was closer to the Small Cold Region, the Heavenly Alliance had a slight advantage.  While the Small Cold Region cultivators weren't in immediate danger, they could only defend.  Even sending someone back to report was difficult.</p><p>The fighting continued and gradually moved closer to the herb garden.</p><p>If the battlefield reached the airspace above the garden, they might become collateral damage, exposing the garden's location.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't remain a bystander any longer. He discussed the situation with Xie Ying and instructed him to quietly prepare the garden's defenses. Meanwhile, Qin Sang discreetly left the garden, pretending to be a passerby, flying towards them on his sword from afar.</p><p>The approaching sword light immediately caught the attention of both sides.</p><p>Qin Sang's late-stage Foundation Establishment cultivation was also revealed.</p><p>After fighting for so long, everyone was exhausted.  The arrival of any expert would disrupt the balance, and judging by Qin Sang's direction, he was likely a Small Cold Region cultivator.</p><p>The Heavenly Alliance cultivators ceased fighting and decisively turned to flee.</p>
