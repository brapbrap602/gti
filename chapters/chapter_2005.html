<h1>Chapter 1996: Jademark Essence</h1><p>Without any superfluous movements, Qin Sang drew upon the world's spiritual energy, gathering it around his body. Even the fierce罡wind couldn't shake him in the slightest.</p><p>Passing through the罡wind, the interior was a vast expanse of azure, a scene of tranquility rarely seen in this realm.  There were no hurricanes, no torrential downpours. It was as if a blue star illuminated the space, or perhaps the inside of an enormous ice crystal, dreamlike and illusory.</p><p>In reality, this place wasn't as safe as it appeared. The罡wind still existed, even more terrifying in its power. Condensed to its extreme, it had undergone a transformation, becoming an invisible wind, capable of killing without a trace.</p><p>Around each of them, auras shimmered as their protective spiritual energy clashed violently with the formless罡wind.</p><p>Above and below, in all directions, the scenery was identical.</p><p>The invisible罡wind formed a barrier. As the four gradually entered the heart of the wind, the area became increasingly tranquil, deathly silent even.</p><p>Finally, they discovered something other than the罡wind: a tiny, insignificant blue spark.</p><p>Sect Master Yu, with swift eyes and quick hands, reached out and grasped at the void. The blue spark shot towards him, landing in his palm. It was a particle of ice.</p><p>The ice particle was only the size of a needle tip, more accurately described as ice dust.  Furthermore, it wasn't truly ice, but something akin to it.</p><p>“It's Voidsky Jade!”</p><p>Elder Guyun recognized the 'ice particle.'</p><p>The description of this spiritual material surfaced in Qin Sang's mind. Voidsky Jade was a type of spiritual jade that could be used as a refining material for magical treasures. It could also be used in alchemy to neutralize certain medicinal properties, making it widely applicable. Though not exceptionally rare in the cultivation world, its price remained consistently high.</p><p>“There must be more inside!” Sect Master Yu declared, gazing into the depths of the罡wind.</p><p>This was determined by the nature of Voidsky Jade.  If one piece was found, there were bound to be more nearby.  It was highly likely that a jade mine had formed within the Heavenly Sea Divine Eye.</p><p>The four continued deeper, and as expected, they saw flickering, azure lights drifting within the罡wind.</p><p>Each spark was a piece of Voidsky Jade, varying in size. The four ignored these fragments, continuing further until they finally saw a deep, profound blue light.</p><p>They found a blue mirror, its surface reflecting their figures. It was a single, massive piece of Voidsky Jade.</p><p>This was the core region of the Heavenly Sea Divine Eye. Here, the罡wind abruptly vanished, having undergone some peculiar transformation, giving birth to Voidsky Jade.  The jade accumulated here, and after years of accretion, the quantity was astonishing.</p><p>“What a magnificent jade mine!”</p><p>Sect Master Yu exclaimed joyfully. He flew onto the Voidsky Jade, reaching out to touch its surface. His expression brightened even further. “At the very least, it’s High-Grade Voidsky Jade, with plenty of Supreme-Grade pieces as well.  A jade mine of this quality is rare even in the Grand Myriad World.”</p><p>Sect Master Ying circled the jade mine, then shook his head. “Sect Master Yu speaks the truth. However, though the Voidsky Jade is excellent, we mustn’t mine too much at once.”</p><p>“Oh?”</p><p>Sect Master Yu’s expression shifted slightly.</p><p>“Sect Master Ying has also noticed. As long as this Heavenly Sea Divine Eye exists, the Voidsky Jade is renewable.  It's better to take it slowly and steadily.”  Elder Guyun raised his purple bamboo staff, pointing towards the edge of the jade mine.  “Regardless of how the Voidsky Jade initially formed, over time, the mine has become part of the Heavenly Sea Divine Eye.  Exhaustively mining the jade could lead to the Divine Eye's collapse, causing us to lose this precious land, and potentially even causing unforeseen changes within the entire Azure Sky Grotto-Heaven.”</p><p>Sect Master Yu had simply been momentarily careless. Once reminded, he also realized the issue.  He gestured a few times over the jade mine. “In that case, after careful calculations, the four sects will each send representatives to harvest a portion at regular intervals.  The Voidsky Jade will be distributed according to the previous agreement.  What are your thoughts, Daoist Priest?”</p><p>The three turned to Qin Sang, only to find his expression somewhat peculiar.</p><p>Qin Sang had descended to the very center of the jade mine, crouching down to gaze intently at the Voidsky Jade.  He then extended a finger, gently rubbing the jade's surface.</p><p>The jade, already pristine, somehow became even purer after being touched by Qin Sang.  It reflected a bewitching, deep blue radiance that vanished the moment his finger left its surface.</p><p>The three exchanged glances, realizing that this wasn't an ordinary Voidsky Jade mine.  There was certainly some hidden mystery, which Qin Sang had discovered.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>The jade mine cracked on its own, the fissure running precisely through the center and rapidly spreading downwards.</p><p>Qin Sang plunged into the fissure, followed closely by the other three.  They quickly reached the end of the crack, where they found a space as blue as the sky.</p><p>The space was even purer than the Voidsky Jade, like flowing soft jade, enveloping streaks of azure light.</p><p>“This is…”</p><p>The three who followed were astonished.</p><p>Their previous cursory examination had failed to reveal this hidden realm within the jade mine.</p><p>If not for Qin Sang, the four sects might not have discovered this place for a very long time.</p><p>"Jademark Essence!"</p><p>Qin Sang let out a soft breath, secretly delighted by this unexpected harvest.</p><p>“Indeed, pure and flawless, with light streaks like jade.  It is this wondrous heavenly material!  Thanks to Daoist Priest’s discerning eye, we were all fixated on the Voidsky Jade, almost making the mistake of cherishing the box but discarding the jewel within."</p><p>Sect Master Ying sighed in admiration.</p><p>Now, everyone realized that the true treasure nurtured by the Heavenly Sea Divine Eye was the Jademark Essence, while the Voidsky Jade was merely a byproduct.</p><p>Logically, Voidsky Jade and Jademark Essence had no common properties. However, in a fragmented minor thousand world, there were bound to be exceptions to the norm.</p><p>Jademark Essence was a rare and precious heavenly material that could be used in crafting spiritual treasures. For Qin Sang, it had another use.</p><p>This material was one of the crucial spiritual components required for Daoist altar construction!</p><p>Especially the foundations of various altars, which required a significant amount of Jademark Essence.</p><p>The main altar where Green Ram Temple resided desperately needed a large quantity of Jademark Essence!</p><p>Qin Sang turned, cupping his hands towards the three.  “Fellow Daoists, this Jademark Essence is of great use to this humble Daoist. I hope the three of you will accommodate me. I’m willing to concede benefits in other areas.”</p><p>Before their arrival, the four sects had tentatively agreed on a distribution plan, with Green Ram Temple naturally receiving the largest share.</p><p>Qin Sang was determined to obtain the Jademark Essence, so he had no choice but to amend the plan and make concessions.</p><p>He wouldn't build the altar immediately, but he might do so in the future.</p><p>After arranging everything here, he would embark on a long journey, traveling the Grand Myriad World to search for old friends and his own Dao.</p><p>However, if he couldn't establish his own Dao, he couldn't remain stagnant either.  He would still have to continue along the path of the *Purple Star Sword Canon*.</p><p>To comprehend the Great Completion Slaughter Dao, he might have to descend to the mortal realm once again, establish a power base, and protect a region.</p><p>A Daoist altar would undoubtedly be the best method.</p><p>He wouldn't always be so fortunate as to find remnants of the Dao Court. Thus, he had to plan the altar's construction himself.</p><p>He needed to start preparing now, gathering various spiritual materials.  He couldn't miss the Jademark Essence.</p><p>The other three hadn't discovered the Jademark Essence. He could certainly wait and retrieve it alone later, but doing so might sow the seeds of future discord between the four sects.</p><p>He now stood as a sect master.</p><p>After his departure, Green Ram Temple would be weak and would need the support of the three major sects.</p><p>The current situation had been hard-won. For a sect to thrive, its actions should be as righteous as possible.</p><p>Elder Guyun and the others understood this.  Hearing Qin Sang's desire to claim all the Jademark Essence, they didn't feel offended and began to ponder seriously.</p><p>Jademark Essence was precious, but the three sects weren't in dire need of it. There was no need to create any unpleasantness with Qin Sang.</p><p>Moreover, the value of this realm lay in the fact that, like Voidsky Jade, Jademark Essence was also renewable. As long as they controlled the Azure Sky Grotto-Heaven, they could obtain Jademark Essence, albeit after a long time, potentially centuries for even a small amount.</p><p>The three communicated through sound transmission, quickly reaching a consensus.  Elder Guyun said, "Alright!  Since Daoist Priest urgently needs the Jademark Essence, we will gladly oblige. You may take it all."</p><p>“Thank you!”</p><p>Qin Sang bowed his hands and sat down in meditation, extending his divine sense into the space, carefully sensing the Jademark Essence.</p><p>Tiny ripples spread through the space.</p><p>After a thorough examination, Qin Sang formulated a plan, informing the others, who had no objections.  He then began the extraction process.</p><p>With a wave of his hand, Qin Sang retrieved sections of spiritual wood, shaping them on the spot into wooden boxes.</p><p>After collecting the Jademark Essence, it had to be stored in spiritual wood to preserve its potency.  It couldn't come into contact with any of the other five elements.</p><p>He beckoned with his fingers, and streaks of azure light flew towards him, filling one wooden box after another.</p><p>As he continued collecting, the azure light within the space dimmed, and the Jademark Essence gradually diminished, finally leaving behind only a thin layer.</p><p>Having gathered so much Jademark Essence, Qin Sang was immensely satisfied. This alone made the trip worthwhile.</p><p>The four returned to the surface.  The fissure in the jade mine sealed itself, returning to its original state, awaiting their next harvest.</p><p>Leaving the Heavenly Sea Divine Eye, the four traveled to the minor restricted area, following the West Sea to the South Sea, where they found the last major restricted area.</p><p>This restricted area was located on the seabed.</p><p>According to Red Plum, this place was once a prison used to confine this realm's most formidable fiends. None who entered this prison ever escaped. Resentment filled the air, and for unknown reasons, it had become increasingly dangerous and terrifying, a place where living beings dared not tread.</p><p>While still in the air, Qin Sang and the others sensed a chilling aura. Diving into the sea, they saw a raised section of the seabed, resembling a black dragon lying dormant, shrouded in darkness.</p><p>Passing through a layer of frigid black water, a black mountain range appeared before them. The rocks and soil were all black, as if they were the ashes of decaying demonic corpses, eerie and sinister.</p><p>Unexpectedly, while the black water could corrode everything, the area within was truly tranquil, devoid of danger.</p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p>Sect Master Yu’s eyes flashed. He opened his hand, releasing several streaks of light, revealing five-colored beetles.</p><p>These beetles scattered in all directions, burrowing into the ground.  Moments later, they returned, the patterns on their carapaces slightly altered.</p><p>Sect Master Yu gazed at the patterns, exclaiming in surprise, “This place is actually an excellent medicinal field!  It’s the yin extreme of this realm, especially suitable for cultivating spiritual herbs that thrive in cold and dark environments. Cultivating them here would undoubtedly yield exceptional results.”</p><p>“Oh?  So this place is no less valuable than the Heavenly Sea Divine Eye.  Our sect has been lacking a superior medicinal field,” Elder Guyun said joyfully.</p><p>Qin Sang was naturally pleased as well. The greater the value of the Azure Sky Grotto-Heaven, the deeper Green Ram Temple's foundation would be.</p><p>“These two major restricted areas seem to be the most valuable places in this realm. It's a pity that the other two were plundered by the Clear Sky Sect.  I wonder what treasures they obtained,” Sect Master Ying mused.  “Initially, we thought that developing it into a shared retreat for the four sects would suffice.  Now, it seems we need to carefully plan and manage this realm properly. What are your thoughts, fellow Daoists?”</p><p>The exploration of the Azure Sky Grotto-Heaven was essentially complete. The remaining minor details would be left to the younger generation. The four began to discuss important matters.</p><p>First, they established a distribution method. For instance, the Jademark Essence and Voidsky Jade would be divided into seven shares, with Green Ram Temple, Cloud Metropolis Heaven, and Ancient Grain Garden each receiving two, and Upper Ridge Courtyard receiving one.</p><p>Qin Sang made concessions in other areas as well.</p><p>The key now was how to manage the Grotto-Heaven to maximize its potential.</p><p>“The medicinal field must be kept secret. We not only need to station guards but also set up formations and seals. Furthermore, although we can’t reverse the overall trend, we must strive to delay or even halt the continued fragmentation of the Grotto-Heaven.  Ideally, we should utilize formations, which will require the combined efforts of our four sects!”</p><p>Elder Guyun said gravely.</p><p>“The materials for my Celestial River Reversal Formation are almost ready. It can be deployed outside the Dao Marker as a world-protecting grand formation!”</p><p>Qin Sang spoke.  During the final month of the Clear Sky Dharma Assembly, he had been extremely busy, contacting various powers and diligently gathering materials, even selling spiritual treasures at low prices to achieve this.</p><p>Since the formation had to be set up anyway, it might as well serve a dual purpose.</p><p>He could contribute less within the realm later, preventing Green Ram Temple from being depleted of resources.</p><p>Seeing the three hesitate, Qin Sang understood their concerns and explained, “There’s no need to worry. This formation is inherently unpredictable.  Even those proficient in it cannot easily breach it. The Celestial River Reversal Formation I deploy will also incorporate my understanding of the Star Dao, further altering its configuration. Even if Old Devil Zhen came personally, he wouldn’t gain any advantage. You will understand once you witness the formation’s deployment.”</p><p>“Very well,” Elder Guyun nodded. “With Daoist Priest’s Celestial River Reversal Formation, we can focus on managing the realm’s interior.”</p><p>“Initially, we can send more disciples here, forming a human formation.”</p><p>“It might be better to improve the climate in some areas and send mortals in to propagate and multiply, using the Human Dao to nourish the Heavenly Dao. Perhaps there will be unexpected benefits.”</p><p>“Is there any basis for such a claim?  I heard that the true mountain gate of Clear Sky Sect is located in a minor grotto-heaven. Has Fellow Daoist Yu ever been inside, or heard any elders mention it?”</p><p>“Never. It was just a sudden thought.”</p><p>…</p><p>Within this major restricted area, the four finalized their plans, deciding to work together to manage this minor thousand world.</p><p>The subsequent tasks were numerous and couldn't be rushed. The four left the Azure Sky Grotto-Heaven, bringing the five Wood Demons with them.</p><p>Passing through the Dao Marker gate, they entered the Grand Myriad World.</p><p>“Is this the Immortal Realm?”</p><p>Vast waves stretched out before them.</p><p>Red Plum gazed at the azure sky and calm sea, a stark contrast to the Azure Sky Grotto-Heaven.  Feeling the abundant spiritual energy, a myriad of emotions welled up within her.</p><p>“Immortal Realm?”  Sect Master Ying chuckled. “We are also on the path of pursuing the Immortal Dao.”</p><p>Qin Sang said softly, “The Grand Myriad World isn’t the Immortal Realm, but there might be a path leading to it.”</p><p>Red Plum and the Flower Demon stood together, like twin sisters, seemingly enlightened. They bowed simultaneously. “Thank you for your guidance, Sect Master.”</p><p>“Write down your cultivation methods. Also, be cautious during your next heavenly tribulation, but know that within danger lies opportunity.”</p><p>Qin Sang said, now offering true guidance.</p><p>After agreeing on a time to meet again, the four parted ways.  Qin Sang and Elder Guyun flew towards Myriad Luo Island.</p><p>Old Devil Zhen’s injuries hadn't fully healed, making it inconvenient for him to meet in person. Qin Sang and Elder Guyun exchanged a few words with him from afar before bidding farewell.</p><p>The Cloudtreading Treasure Ship soared into the sky, departing Myriad Luo Island and transforming into a streak of azure light, returning to Cloud Metropolis Heaven at maximum speed.</p><p>Qin Sang declined the invitation to visit the mountain and immediately rushed to Green Ram Temple.</p><p>Green Ram Temple was severely lacking in experts.  To manage both the Azure Sky Grotto-Heaven and the temple itself, careful planning was required.</p><p>Entrusting these matters to the two Demon Marquises, Taiyi, and the others, Qin Sang made the necessary arrangements and returned to his secluded residence to begin refining the Celestial River Reversal Formation!</p>
