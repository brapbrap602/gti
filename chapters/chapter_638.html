Chapter 630: The Holy Maiden


Although he had mastered this divine ability through self-study, it wasn't easy to use it proficiently.
The sword light Qin Sang manifested was full of flaws and could only be maintained for a very short time, making it unsuitable for combat. As he journeyed, he continued to ponder the profoundness of the sword path.
The path of immortality was long and arduous, and every path was challenging!
Soon, he arrived upstream of the river where he had drifted. Qin Sang flew low, spreading his divine sense and probing deep underground, searching for any hidden presences within the subterranean river.
He found nothing.
Upon reaching the Qingyi River, Qin Sang concealed himself and followed the current downstream, landing at the back of Qianhu Village. He frowned slightly; the room was empty.
From his recovery to his breakthrough, less than twenty days had passed since he left Qianhu Village. Yet, a thin layer of dust had accumulated on the table in Yagu's room, and she was nowhere to be seen.
Yagu was very diligent; if she were still living here, she would have cleaned every day.
"Did Yagu gain acceptance from the villagers after her birthmark and muteness were cured?" Qin Sang wondered as he swiftly moved towards the front of the village, still unable to find her.
Since her grandmother's death, Yagu had lived alone, ostracized by the villagers.  She had never dared to venture far, having never left Qianhu Village her entire life.
Even during the Shaman Festival, when the surrounding villages gathered for celebrations and dances, Yagu could only stand alone on the mountaintop, gazing at the festivities from afar.
"The Shaman Festival is approaching. Could Yagu have made friends and gone to participate in the festivities?" Qin Sang knew how much Yagu looked forward to the Shaman Festival and tried to think positively, but something felt amiss.
Sweeping his divine sense, he finally found a familiar person: Yagu's shaman grandfather.
The old man was the only shaman in Qianhu Village and held a revered position. His stilt house, one of the best in the village, faced the Qingyi River, offering a wide view.
At that moment, the old man was grinding medicine in his room, his face grim, unlike his usual gentle demeanor, as if he had a vendetta against the mortar and pestle.
"Who's there?" The old man caught a glimpse of the curtain fluttering in his peripheral vision, seemingly with a figure behind it, and became instantly alert.
Then, the room darkened as a young man materialized by the window, like a phantom. He wasn't from the village, but his face seemed vaguely familiar.
The old man's gaze shifted to the man's left shoulder; his arm was still intact.
"Who are you?" The old man grabbed his staff, wary.
"You don't remember me?" Having taken the old man's medicine, albeit to no effect, Qin Sang remained courteous. "A few days ago, I was severely injured and lost my arm, drifting on the river. I was fortunate enough to be rescued by you and Yagu. My injuries have finally healed, and I've come to express my gratitude, but I can't find Yagu. Do you know where she is?"
"It's you!" The old man recognized Qin Sang. His eyes suddenly reddened, and his face contorted with anger. He gritted his teeth and shouted, "Yagu saved your life, yet you caused her such misery! You have the nerve to mention her!"
"What?" Qin Sang frowned. "Yagu saved my life. How could I possibly harm her? Before I left, out of gratitude, I gave her medicine to cure her muteness and birthmark so she could return to a normal life… What happened?"
Qin Sang realized something must have transpired during his absence.
He knew Yagu's life would change drastically once she was cured, and the villagers would inquire about the reason for her recovery.
Curing one ailment could be explained.
But the miraculous healing of two chronic conditions would undoubtedly cause a stir.
Yagu, powerless on her own, might have attracted misfortune instead.
Before leaving, Qin Sang had advised Yagu to pretend she was still mute and tell the villagers that her grandfather, the shaman, had used a rare and miraculous medicine to remove her birthmark.
Qianhu Village regarded Yagu as a curse, largely due to prejudice based on her appearance, believing her birthmark was a shamanic curse.
With the birthmark gone, Yagu could attempt to integrate with the villagers and live a normal life.
Qin Sang planned to return and teach Yagu immortal arts or martial skills. By then, with the ability to protect herself, she could reveal her recovered speech without fear.
Unexpectedly, an incident had occurred in such a short time. He had even left a Qingfu coin as a precaution, which hadn't worked.
"Who harmed Yagu?" Qin Sang's face hardened, a deep killing intent flickering in his eyes.
The old man sensed the sudden shift in Qin Sang's aura, as if a deadly star had descended.
However, his grief for Yagu emboldened him. He pointed at Qin Sang and said hatefully, "Because you cured Yagu's birthmark, she was chosen as the Holy Maiden by Yi Hui Village! Yi Hui Village only selects beautiful girls. If it weren't for you, Yagu's birthmark would still be there, and she wouldn't have been chosen!"
"Holy Maiden?" Qin Sang was relieved to hear it wasn't a life-threatening situation.
He had seen Yi Hui Village on the Five Pests Sect's map. Yi Hui Village was the dominant power over Qianhu Village and the surrounding area. The village priests were cultivators, and they even had a Foundation Establishment expert, making them more powerful than Tianyue Village.
Qin Sang's understanding of the western shamanic tribes was limited; he didn't know the significance of the "Holy Maiden." It sounded like Yagu being chosen as the Yi Hui Village Holy Maiden was a good thing.
But it couldn't be that simple!
Shamanic tribes practiced corpse refinement, insect control, and deity worship, with some rather sinister customs.
"What do they make the Holy Maidens do in Yi Hui Village?" Qin Sang asked gravely.
The old man shook his head weakly, tears welling up in his eyes. "All I know is that the girls chosen as the Yi Hui Village Holy Maidens never reappear! That poor child, Yagu, has suffered so much…"
The old man collapsed to the ground. As Qin Sang listened to his account, he learned what had happened.
It turned out that Yi Hui Village had a tradition of selecting young, pure maidens from the villages under their control as Holy Maidens before each Shaman Festival.
Yi Hui Village claimed it was an honor to be a "Holy Maiden," blessed by the Shaman God. However, the other villages weren't fooled. The Holy Maidens vanished without a trace after the Shaman Festival, suggesting a hidden secret.
However, the Yi Hui Village priests were seen as emissaries of the Shaman God, and the villagers, being mortals, dared not resist.
Furthermore, Yi Hui Village didn't demand a "Holy Maiden" from the same village every year. Each village only had to offer a "Holy Maiden" every other year, a burden within their tolerance, so they tacitly accepted this cruel tradition.
This year, it was Qianhu Village's turn to offer a "Holy Maiden," and Yagu was about to come of age.
Yi Hui Village had beauty standards for their Holy Maidens. If Qin Sang hadn't cured her birthmark, Yagu would have escaped this fate.
"How is the 'Holy Maiden' chosen in Qianhu Village?" Qin Sang asked coldly.
The old man gave a bitter laugh. "Everyone was eager to get rid of Yagu, the 'curse.' Some had already wanted to force her to death. Was there even a need for a selection?"
"They all deserve to die!" Qin Sang snorted, turning to look at Qianhu Village through the window.
A cold glint flashed in his eyes, but he didn't act. Doing so would be overstepping his bounds.
Yagu had lost her parents at a young age and had survived with the help of the villagers.
Let her make her own choice!
