<h1>Chapter 712: Taking Advantage of the Void</h1><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang didn't dare to expose himself any longer. He restrained his aura and quietly fled south.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the demon beast's speed was astonishing.</p><p>This demon beast was a demonic bird, with a massive body and entirely black feathers, as if covered in a layer of black flames. Its wingspan reached nearly thirty meters, an imposing sight.</p><p>With a gentle flap of its wings, the demonic bird shot forward like a black streak of light.</p><p>In a few flashes, the demonic bird rapidly closed the distance between itself and Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't help but feel anxious.  The movements from his talismans and sword energy couldn't be concealed, and without these two techniques, his escape speed was too slow to create enough distance.</p><p>His worries quickly became reality.</p><p>As the demonic bird drew closer, it suddenly seemed to sense something.  Its head turned south, its sharp eyes sweeping across the area.</p><p>The vast sea surface was very calm, seemingly empty. But the demonic bird's spiritual sense was exceptionally keen. A fierce glint flashed in its eyes as it stared fixedly at a spot on the sea.</p><p>In the next moment, a figure suddenly shot out from that spot.</p><p>Nine Dragons Chariot Talisman, Sword Energy Resonance…</p><p>Qin Sang used every means at his disposal, his speed soaring to the limit.</p><p>His heart chilled. The demonic bird was actually a late-stage Demon Core realm great demon, and its spiritual sense was incredibly sharp. Even hiding motionless beneath the sea surface with his aura restrained hadn't fooled it.</p><p>‘Screech!’</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang's conspicuous escape light, the demonic bird let out an angry shriek.  It immediately changed its flight direction, burning with rage as it pursued Qin Sang.</p><p>Over the empty sea, two streaks of light chased each other, breaking the silence of the night.</p><p>Qin Sang secretly breathed a sigh of relief. Fortunately, only this demonic bird was chasing him, and it hadn't alerted other demon beasts.</p><p>At this time, from the direction the Transformation realm great demon had flown in…</p><p>Overwhelming demonic energy filled the sky, blotting out the sun. Terrifying, gigantic figures surged forward, wave after wave, their numbers impossible to discern. If so many demon beasts were to chase him together, Qin Sang would be in despair.</p><p>Moreover, the demonic bird's appearance and its actions indicated that although its physical body was extremely powerful, it wasn't skilled in escape techniques. Its speed was not as fast as other demon beasts of the same realm, and was actually slightly slower than Qin Sang's.</p><p>However, easily shaking off the demonic bird was wishful thinking.</p><p>The late-stage Demon Core realm demonic bird's endurance was superior to Qin Sang's. Even his Gold Core and Corpse Core combined couldn't compare. If he couldn't shake off his pursuer soon, Qin Sang would be in a difficult situation.</p><p>The demonic bird was very persistent, relentlessly pursuing him.</p><p>Qin Sang could only flee south, deliberately avoiding the snowy mountain where the Quehuo birds nested, passing by its western side.  In his haste, he glanced back and unexpectedly discovered streams of blue light erupting from the mountain's peak.</p><p>Faintly, within the blue light, a Quehuo bird much larger than its brethren flew out.</p><p>"Was this fellow also startled by the Transformation realm great demon?"</p><p>Qin Sang was certain that this was the Quehuo bird king, finally deigning to leave its nest.</p><p>Unfortunately, the distance was too great to discern its cultivation level.  Being chased by the demonic bird, Qin Sang didn't dare to approach, lest he be besieged by multiple great demons.</p><p>Thinking of this, Qin Sang felt even more hatred towards the demonic bird behind him, but he could only curse it in his heart.</p><p>The Nine Dragons Chariot Talisman and Sword Energy Resonance consumed an alarming amount of true essence.  After fleeing an unknown distance, Qin Sang gradually felt his true essence beginning to wane, while the demonic bird behind him continued its relentless pursuit.</p><p>The demonic bird’s cries were like an eagle's screech, each one sharper than the last, grating on the nerves.</p><p>Its eyes were blazing, clearly enraged by Qin Sang.  It had thought it could easily capture this small insect, but it had been fleeing for so long, the distance between them actually increasing, which infuriated it.</p><p>However, the demonic bird's smugness didn't last long.  Qin Sang's escape light dimmed, then suddenly brightened again, his true essence fluctuations instantly returning to their peak, his speed undiminished.</p><p>Seeing the unfavorable situation, Qin Sang had unsealed his Corpse Core.</p><p>The demonic bird was stunned, feeling like it had been toyed with, and became furious.</p><p>Hearing the enraged cries from behind, Qin Sang didn't feel any relief. He had already grasped the Three Lights Jade Liquid in his hand.</p><p>‘Whoosh… Whoosh…’</p><p>Man and demon raced through the air.</p><p>Under the silver moon, the demonic bird recklessly chased Qin Sang, its demonic aura soaring.  Its powerful presence made the sea beasts tremble, not daring to emerge. This was the only good news for Qin Sang.</p><p>By now, the true essence within his Corpse Core was also half depleted.</p><p>Qin Sang turned his head, only able to see a mass of black light behind him.  From the center of the black light, two fierce gazes shot out, making one's heart tremble with fear.</p><p>Just then, a scene that delighted Qin Sang unfolded.</p><p>For some unknown reason, the relentlessly pursuing demonic bird suddenly stopped. It tilted its head, turning to look northwest. After a moment, the demonic bird glared fiercely at Qin Sang, then unexpectedly abandoned the chase.  With a spread of its wings, it flew straight in that direction, disappearing into the distance.</p><p>Only then did Qin Sang faintly hear a beast's roar.</p><p>He hovered in mid-air, watching the demonic bird's retreating figure, his heart filled with uncertainty.</p><p>The direction from which the roar came was the same direction the Transformation realm great demon had gone.  Could it be some kind of summoning signal, forcing the demonic bird to give up its pursuit?</p><p>Regardless, he had finally escaped danger.</p><p>Qin Sang let out a long breath, shuddering at the thought of the perilous situation he had just faced. If it had been any other cultivator with slightly inferior escape techniques, they would have already perished in the demonic bird's beak.</p><p>The Demonic Sea was indeed fraught with danger at every turn.</p><p>But recalling that this incident might be related to the Cold Flame, and that the Cold Flame's appearance had something to do with him, he could only smile wryly.</p><p>After confirming the demonic bird's departure, Qin Sang didn't dare to linger. He chose a direction and quickly flew away.</p><p>Finding a deserted island, he set up a cave dwelling.  Qin Sang plopped down on the ground, gathering his spirit to circulate his cultivation technique.  His nearly depleted true essence gradually replenished.</p><p>By the time he had fully recovered, it was already dawn. Qin Sang awoke from his meditation, recalling the events of the previous night.</p><p>"Were all those demon beasts summoned by that Transformation realm great demon? For just a Cold Flame, why gather so many demon beasts? Could it be…"</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes flashed.  He felt like the Transformation realm great demon was marshaling troops.</p><p>"Could it be that the Cold Flame has alarmed the island master of Huntian Island, and the Transformation realm great demon wants to contend with the island master?  No matter what, this place will definitely become chaotic. I can't stay long. But both routes back are blocked. I can only continue fleeing south. I don't know how long it will take them to return. Time is too tight. I hope I can obtain the Myriad Ages Camphor Tree before then… Wait…"</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly stood up, his face filled with delight.</p><p>If his guess was correct, the Quehuo bird king wouldn't dare to disobey the Transformation realm great demon's orders.</p><p>Last night, it might have been summoned by the Transformation realm great demon, forcing it to leave its nest. Now, it was likely following the Transformation realm great demon. Wasn't this the perfect opportunity?</p>
