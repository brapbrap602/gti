<h1>Chapter 665: Eastern Edge Alliance</h1><p>Several elegant attendants, a mix of Wu and Human races like the city guards, worked in the shop, seemingly without prejudice. By now, Qin Sang could easily distinguish between the two races. Although their appearances weren't distinctly different, their bloodlines and thus their auras were subtly unique. The shop even sold artifacts designed to identify bloodlines. This difference was easily discernible when dealing with cultivators of lower realms. Qin Sang felt relieved that he had been cautious enough not to interact with other Core Formation cultivators in the Western Frontier.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang enter, an attendant immediately greeted him with a smile, her deference growing significantly upon noticing the token at his waist. “Welcome, Immortal. Are you looking to purchase artifacts or pills, or perhaps sell something? Our most precious artifacts and pills are on the third floor. If you wish, please follow me.”</p><p>“You sell artifacts here?”</p><p>Intrigued, Qin Sang had heard of the Four Seas Trading Company's vast influence, but their headquarters were in Human territory. He hadn't expected a branch in the Wu Divine Continent to carry such items.</p><p>Hoping to get a sense of the local prices, Qin Sang allowed the attendant to lead him to the third floor. There, a Foundation Establishment female cultivator of clearly higher status took over, guiding him into a private room.</p><p>“May I ask your esteemed name?”</p><p>After introducing herself, the cultivator offered Qin Sang tea with a charming smile.</p><p>Qin Sang's voice was low, “I am known as Qing Feng. I heard your company sells artifacts. What kind of artifacts are they? How powerful are they? And what are their prices?”</p><p>Having revealed his identity in the Western Frontier, he could only use an alias in Wu territory.</p><p>Unfazed by Qin Sang's barrage of questions, the cultivator smiled. “To be honest, we don't have many artifacts left in Port Pingbo, only three. If you are interested, bartering is preferred. We will have Port Pingbo experts assess your treasures' value; we will not shortchange you. Of course, if you wish to pay with spirit stones, we will also accept them. Allow me to fetch the artifacts for your inspection…”</p><p>Truly a large trading company, casually bringing out three artifacts. Qin Sang felt a twinge of envy.</p><p>After a short wait, the cultivator returned and placed three jade boxes on the table for Qin Sang to examine.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't sense any other experts observing them, but judging by the cultivator’s confidence, he guessed the Four Seas Trading Company had other measures in place to prevent theft.</p><p>With three artifacts before him, Qin Sang couldn’t resist the temptation.  He quickly dismissed other thoughts and opened each box.</p><p>Inside the jade boxes were a dark, tortoise shell, a long whip made from some unknown demonic beast's spine, and a flying sword.</p><p>To Qin Sang's disappointment, none of the artifacts were of high quality. The flying sword was inferior to his Ebony Sword, yet its price was tens or even hundreds of thousands of spirit stones. Even if he sold everything except the Three Lights Jade Liquid, he still couldn't afford it.</p><p>The only item that piqued Qin Sang's interest was the tortoise shell, a defensive artifact crafted from a turtle demon's shell, offering decent protection.</p><p>If he didn't have the Black Water Mirror, he might have considered it.  He wasn't lacking in offensive or escape methods, but a good defensive artifact was what he needed.</p><p>The Black Water Mirror was both offensive and defensive, but mediocre in both aspects. However, due to its high quality, its defense was not much worse than the tortoise shell, sufficient for Qin Sang's needs.  There was no need to buy another.</p><p>The treasures he possessed would surely be enough to trade, but he wasn’t foolish enough to do so.</p><p>Finally, Qin Sang shook his head, closed the boxes, and pushed them back.</p><p>Having witnessed such scenes many times, the cultivator remained composed and collected the boxes, still treating Qin Sang with enthusiasm.</p><p>After a moment of contemplation, Qin Sang voiced his purpose, “I need Earthly Yin Qi to refine some items. I wonder if your company has any channels to help me locate where Earthly Yin Qi can be found near Port Pingbo. Spirit stones are not a problem.”</p><p>“Earthly Yin Qi?”</p><p>The cultivator looked at Qin Sang with surprise. Being a Foundation Establishment cultivator, she knew Earthly Yin Qi was an extremely Yin substance, feared by cultivators.  She didn't expect anyone to actively seek it out.</p><p>What could he be refining that requires Earthly Yin Qi?</p><p>This thought flashed through her mind but was quickly suppressed. She didn’t dare pry into the secrets of a Core Formation expert; the company wouldn't protect her if she did.</p><p>The cultivator stood up. “Please wait a moment, Senior. I'll have someone investigate…”</p><p>“Wait.”</p><p>Qin Sang stopped her and tossed her a bag of spirit stones. “One more thing, please inquire about this as well.  Recently, are there any trading companies sending people to the Wu Divine Mountain to use the teleportation formation to the Storm Demon Sea?”</p><p>The Seven Kill Sect matter made Qin Sang suddenly feel a sense of urgency. Only with sufficient strength could he have a chance of survival in the Seven Kill Sect.</p><p>He decided to skip exploring Human territories and head directly to the Storm Demon Sea to hunt demons and cultivate. The quickest route was naturally the ancient teleportation formation on the Wu Divine Mountain.</p><p>Not only did he need to go, but he needed to go as soon as possible.  Otherwise, he didn't know what chaos the returning Wu Nascent Soul cultivators might bring. Qin Sang learned from Du Han about the collective disappearance of the Wu Nascent Soul cultivators and felt a sense of impending doom. With undercurrents surging in the Boundless Sea, going to the Storm Demon Sea might allow him to avoid the turmoil.</p><p>But the problem was his Human identity.</p><p>While the Wu Divine Mountain didn't exclude Human cultivators, it lay deep within the Wu Divine Continent.  A long journey separated it from Port Pingbo, requiring passage through the territories of many powerful Wu clans.  Traveling alone in such a place would likely result in being surrounded and killed.</p><p>The top trading companies operating in the Wu Divine Continent had intricate connections with the Wu clans.  Traveling with them was the safest option.</p><p>Not only Qin Sang, but other Human cultivators in the Wu Divine Continent did the same.</p><p>Hefting the bag of spirit stones, the cultivator's smile brightened. “Senior, you needn’t ask others; I happen to know. A senior steward of the Qiongyu Trading Company, part of the Eastern Edge Alliance, is currently in Port Pingbo and plans to return to the Storm Demon Sea in a month. The news was just released, and they are recruiting. With your cultivation, Senior, you will surely be valued by the Qiongyu Trading Company. Even if you don't wish to join, as long as you don't violate their rules, they are willing to form a beneficial connection with you…”</p><p>“Eastern Edge Alliance, is that the large trade alliance spanning the eastern sea region?”</p><p>Qin Sang was delighted.  Backed by the Eastern Edge Alliance, traveling with the Qiongyu Trading Company would guarantee his safety.</p><p>“Indeed. As long as you are a member and display the Eastern Edge Alliance banner, you can travel freely within the Wu Divine Continent. The Qiongyu Trading Company’s branch is in the northernmost part of the trading district.”</p><p>The cultivator gave him detailed directions.</p><p>“Thank you, Fellow Daoist.”</p><p>Qin Sang cupped his hands and produced a list. “If your company sells any of these spirit herbs and materials, please bring them as well.”</p><p>The cultivator took the list and nodded after reviewing it. “We do have some of these spirit herbs in stock. I’ll be back shortly.”</p>
