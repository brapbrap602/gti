<h1>Chapter 1070: A Convergence of Forces</h1><p>Mou Laomo appeared behind the elder, attacking without mercy.</p><p>The fire lotus was condensed from the Winter Nether Flame.</p><p>For years, he had been healing his injuries while refining the Winter Nether Flame, finally subduing the spirit fire.</p><p>The Winter Nether Flame transformed into a fire lotus, its blue flames gentle, lacking in dramatic display.</p><p>In truth, the fire lotus wasn't fully bloomed, more like a bud, but the petals were already visible.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The fire lotus, beautiful yet chilling, concentrated the purest essence of the cold flame.</p><p>The elder, focused on the Demon Subduing Stele, had his protective aura pierced through effortlessly.  The terrifying chill nearly froze him solid.</p><p>At the critical moment, he frantically channeled his inner energy towards his back, activating his protective treasure, but to little effect.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The fire lotus exploded.</p><p>A torrent of blue flames, like a gigantic serpent, fiercely struck the elder.</p><p>The elder screamed, a gaping wound appearing on his back; he was severely injured.</p><p>Instantly, the Demon Subduing Stele lost control.</p><p>……</p><p>The Ancient Demon, forced back by the Demon Lord and the Xi You Alliance Leader, showed no panic, a cold smile playing on his lips.</p><p>Unbeknownst to him, the Demon Subduing Stele was a treasure specifically forged by cultivators to suppress him; he couldn't control it, and forcing its use would result in a backlash.</p><p>His attempt to seize the stele was a mere pretense, to prevent the elder and others from being distracted.</p><p>However, things didn't unfold as the Ancient Demon anticipated.</p><p>The one who ambushed the Four Saints’ descendant and attempted to seize the stele was different from what the Ancient Demon had imagined.</p><p>Upon seeing Mou Laomo, the Ancient Demon's eyes changed instantly.</p><p>His men hadn't appeared!</p><p>The Demon Lord's attempt to seize the stele further surprised the Ancient Demon.</p><p>Seeing the situation, the Ancient Demon acted decisively, immediately turning to attack the Xi You Alliance Leader.</p><p>……</p><p>A smile appeared on the Demon Lord's face as he channeled his energy, reaching for the Demon Subduing Stele, intent on claiming it.</p><p>Just then, another unexpected event occurred.</p><p>Beside the Demon Subduing Stele, a figure emerged without warning.</p><p>The newcomer, wielding a whisk, exuded an air of ethereal grace, smiling at the Demon Lord with a hint of smugness and mockery.  It was Ling Zhuzi, who had been tracking them.</p><p>"I didn't expect you to be so bold, Daoist friend, in seeking the Four Saints' treasure. I shall humbly accept it…"</p><p>Ling Zhuzi laughed heartily.</p><p>The smile on the Demon Lord's face froze, and he roared in fury, "Ling Zhuzi! How dare you!"</p><p>"Dare I not?"</p><p>Ling Zhuzi retorted sarcastically, flinging his whisk towards the Demon Subduing Stele, faster than the Demon Lord.</p><p>Enraged, the Demon Lord transformed his energy into a blade, striking at Ling Zhuzi, while simultaneously boosting his speed, dashing towards the stele.</p><p>……</p><p>Above.</p><p>Mou Laomo, having ambushed the elder and seeing him severely wounded but still alive, flashed towards him, once again condensing the cold flame, intending to end the elder's life, leaving him no chance to breathe.</p><p>At that moment, he caught sight of the scene below and paused.</p><p>The Demon Lord's condition for saving Mou Laomo was that once the Ancient Demon appeared and the Four Saints' descendant was exposed, Mou Laomo would secretly attack, aiding the Demon Lord in seizing the treasure.</p><p>The plan had gone incredibly smoothly, yet a flaw appeared at the very last moment.</p><p>Someone else was lurking, contending for the treasure with the Demon Lord.</p><p>Worse, this person was someone Mou Laomo hated intensely: the Heavenly Dao Sect's Sect Master, Ling Zhuzi!</p><p>Ling Zhuzi was his archenemy.  If Ling Zhuzi obtained the treasure, unless Mou Laomo broke through to the late Nascent Soul stage, he would never see the light of day again.</p><p>Intending to retrieve the fire lotus and repel Ling Zhuzi, Mou Laomo suddenly felt uneasy.</p><p>Was Ling Zhuzi's presence at Yi Tian Peak a coincidence, or a premeditated move?</p><p>If it was premeditated, he might not be alone.</p><p>"Not good!"</p><p>Mou Laomo cried inwardly.</p><p>As this thought crossed his mind, Mou Laomo felt a sharp gust of wind from behind, an extremely sharp aura causing his hair to stand on end.</p><p>It was a case of the mantis stalking the cicada, unaware of the oriole behind.</p><p>Behind Mou Laomo, a graceful figure emerged from the void, her eyes sharp. It was Madam Li.</p><p>With a flick of her jade finger.</p><p>A phoenix hairpin shot out, like a true phoenix, piercing the void, aiming straight for Mou Laomo's heart.</p><p>The same ambush, the same location.</p><p>Mou Laomo's injuries hadn't healed, and he had already released the fire lotus. He hadn't expected someone to be watching him. Sensing the hairpin's aura, Mou Laomo knew he couldn't defend against it. With a yell, he lunged forward.</p><p>……</p><p>High in the sky, mountain valley.</p><p>The battlefield was split into two locations, both at a critical juncture.</p><p>"Senior Brother!"</p><p>Suddenly, a mournful cry echoed from above.</p><p>A bell tolled, a warning.</p><p>An old woman arrived breathlessly, only to witness the Demon Lord and Lingzhuzi vying for the Suppression Tablet, and her senior brother critically wounded by Mou Laomo's surprise attack.</p><p>"You're courting death!"</p><p>Enraged, the old woman pressed her palm to her forehead, letting out a muffled groan.  Her aura surged dramatically.  Employing some unknown secret technique, her cultivation, originally comparable to the three alliance leaders (at peak mid-Nascent Soul stage), instantly surpassed that level, matching the Demon Lord and Lingzhuzi.</p><p>Simultaneously, the Suppression Tablet flickered, then erupted with immense force, shattering the whisk and soaring into the air.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>A torrent of green light surged forth like a tidal wave. The old woman plummeted, wielding the Suppression Tablet, the green light flowing as she desperately tried to save the dying elder, putting Mou Laomo directly in the path of its power.</p><p>Unexpectedly, another uninvited guest joined the fray. Lingzhuzi and the Demon Lord fought over the tablet, only to watch helplessly as the treasure flew away.</p><p>Mou Laomo fared worst of all.  Disaster struck one after another. In the blink of an eye, he was caught in a pincer movement, unable to advance or retreat. The Suppression Tablet, now wielded by the old woman, was vastly more powerful than before.  Mou Laomo, already struggling to fend off the Phoenix hairpin, turned deathly pale.</p><p>"Save me!"</p><p>A cry for help echoed from the valley – Xiyou Alliance Leader. The ancient demon abandoned the Suppression Tablet and attacked Xiyou.  She was immediately in grave danger.  Originally, with the Demon Lord possessing the tablet and teaming up with Mou Laomo, they could have easily overwhelmed the ancient demon.  But with the unexpected turn of events, she was left to face both the ancient demon and its servant alone.</p><p>The Demon Lord was also faced with a difficult choice: He had lost his chance to seize the Suppression Tablet, and now had to decide between saving Mou Laomo or Xiyou.  Seeing the awesome power of the Suppression Tablet, he gritted his teeth and rushed to Xiyou’s aid.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>*Pfft!*</p><p>Blood sprayed across the sky. Mou Laomo's body contorted into an unrecognizable mess, a gaping hole piercing him; even his Nascent Soul couldn't escape, as he was reduced to a mangled corpse, flung from the cliff to his death.</p><p>Feeling the power of the Suppression Tablet, Li Furen's face turned pale. She hastily retreated, but was still hit by the shockwave, spitting blood and flying backward.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>The old woman descended from the sky, cradling the elder and holding the Suppression Tablet before her, coldly observing the scene.</p><p>Lingzhuzi, seeing the situation was hopeless, sighed softly, put away his whisk, and moved to Li Furen's side.  Li Furen, her face ashen, glanced at her severely damaged Phoenix hairpin, her heart aching.  She nodded to Lingzhuzi, wiped the blood from her mouth, took a restorative pill, and sat cross-legged to begin healing.</p>
