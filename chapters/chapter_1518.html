<h1>Chapter 1509: Mountains and Rivers Pearl</h1><p>"Who dares!"</p><p>The roar of the Great Sage Heavenly Peng resounded through the sea of fire, startling the assembled demons and monsters.</p><p>What followed left everyone shocked and furious.</p><p>A streak of black flowing light burst out of the clouds, unexpectedly defying the impact of the fiery waves. It went against the current, rushing towards the Exquisite Pagoda like a bolt of lightning!</p><p>A closer look revealed that the blackness was a type of spiritual fire, and within its center, two figures could vaguely be seen.</p><p>They were Qin Sang and Liuli.</p><p>From the emergence of the Exquisite Pagoda to Qin Sang's arrival at the circular platform, it had all happened in the blink of an eye.</p><p>Qin Sang was still unsure what the Exquisite Pagoda was, or whether the Stupa in his hand could completely control the Exquisite Pagoda, and to what extent.</p><p>However, his previous discoveries were enough to make him take this risk!</p><p>The Exquisite Pagoda was surrounded by raging flames, even more ferocious than those below. Yet, the Stupa in his hand could resist the flames.</p><p>The flames, in fact, acted as a natural barrier, helping to block incoming enemies.</p><p>Furthermore, Qin Sang noticed that the entrance to the Exquisite Pagoda had no door, but a golden wall of light.</p><p>He surmised that, holding the Stupa, he should be able to pass through the wall of light.</p><p>Qin Sang had a faint feeling that he should be able to control the Exquisite Pagoda with the Stupa, but he would only know how to do so after entering.</p><p>At this moment, the assembled demons and monsters were in disarray, resisting the impact of the fiery waves, creating a momentary opening.</p><p>Once they regained their composure, it would be much harder to break through under their watchful eyes.</p><p>No matter what, it was worth a try.</p><p>The opportunity was fleeting.</p><p>Qin Sang, known for his decisiveness, acted immediately. He protected himself with the Nine Nether Demonic Fire, sent a mental transmission to Liuli, summoned the Four-Multiply Serpent Seal, then grabbed Liuli and, using the Thunder Evasion, burst out of the clouds.</p><p>Although the Thunder Evasion was exquisite, it was impossible to approach the Exquisite Pagoda without encountering resistance under the watchful eyes of the demons and monsters.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>Qin Sang, with his eyes fixed straight ahead, charged forward amidst the roars of the demons and monsters.</p><p>Seeing the Nine Nether Demonic Fire, the Old Demon Mixing Demons flew into a rage.</p><p>"It's you!"</p><p>He had fought with Qin Sang more than once and was very familiar with him. He immediately recognized the Nine Nether Demonic Fire.</p><p>Among the demons and monsters present, perhaps only he understood why this situation had occurred.</p><p>During the battle for the treasure at the Golden Summit, he had been within reach of the seven-story Stupa, only to have Qin Sang snatch it away. Old Demon Mixing Demons could sense that this object did not have fluctuations similar to the Ganoderma Lucidum Ruyi and the stone tablet, but it had unexpectedly played a crucial role here.</p><p>It turned out that obtaining the Ganoderma Lucidum Ruyi from the Pure Sea Sect was no coincidence.</p><p>The two treasures treasured by the Pure Sea Sect were deeply connected to the sacred ground of the Profound Heaven Palace!</p><p>However, there were no relevant records in the history of the Profound Heaven Palace or in the legends related to the Pure Sea Sect.</p><p>If there was a connection, why didn't the Profound Heaven Palace send someone to investigate after the Pure Sea Sect emerged?</p><p>One was the overlord of a realm, the other a reclusive Buddhist sect. What was their relationship?</p><p>Qin Sang had refused his invitation, yet now he had mysteriously appeared.</p><p>Old Demon Mixing Demons was both shocked and furious. He had no time to ponder why Qin Sang was here; he had only one thought - stop him!</p><p>"Stop him!"</p><p>Old Demon Mixing Demons let out a fierce roar, his hand gripping tightly, the Black Bamboo Staff surged with layers of demonic light, resisting the fiery waves.</p><p>By now, the impact of the fiery waves had greatly diminished, nearing its end.</p><p>The Mixing Demon Seal, which had been hovering above Old Demon Mixing Demon's head as protection, was now free.</p><p>The palm-sized token shot out like black lightning, transforming into a hundred-zhang phantom with a sky-shattering aura, carving a path through the sea of fire.</p><p>With overwhelming force, it slammed towards Qin Sang!</p><p>On the other side, the Great Sage Heavenly Peng didn't use any magical treasures. The golden light emanating from his feathers was like golden armor, protecting his entire body within the sea of fire, leaving him unharmed.</p><p>The Great Sage Heavenly Peng stared fixedly at Qin Sang, his killing intent shocking.</p><p>His spiritual sense was even sharper than Old Demon Mixing Demons', and he had been the first to discover Qin Sang's trail.</p><p>With a flap of his giant wings, the Great Sage Heavenly Peng used some unknown divine ability, making his true form almost invisible. He transformed into a golden sun, its golden light like swords piercing through heaven and earth.</p><p>With immense power, he broke through the fiery waves and charged back towards the Exquisite Pagoda.</p><p>However, he was one step too late. No matter how fast he was, he couldn't match Qin Sang.</p><p>At this moment, the Great Sage Heavenly Peng suddenly opened his sharp beak and spat out a ball of white light.</p><p>Within the white light was a pearl the size of a dragon's eye.</p><p>The pearl was crystal clear, containing a phantom realm of mountains and rivers, with a high sky and vast clouds, imposing and magnificent. It was the extraordinary treasure, the Mountains and Rivers Pearl.</p><p>The Mountains and Rivers Pearl and the Mixing Demon Seal, one black and one white, arrived almost simultaneously.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>Qin Sang, unwilling to show weakness, pushed the Nine Nether Demonic Fire to its limit. The demonic flames soared to the sky, and in terms of aura alone, it was not inferior to the surrounding churning flames.</p><p>He and Liuli did not pause, seemingly intending to charge into the Exquisite Pagoda despite the attacks of two of the top powerhouses of the current era.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>The Mountains and Rivers Pearl was the first to collide with the Nine Nether Demonic Fire.</p><p>Mist billowed and suddenly spread out, occupying half the sky, revealing the phantom realm of mountains and rivers.</p><p>Towering mountains and a vast river flowed towards nothingness.</p><p>Mountains and rivers descended, and an inexplicable pressure followed!</p><p>For a moment, the Nine Nether Demonic Fire experienced a kind of suppressing force, showing a hint of stagnation. The jumping flames seemed to have lost their vitality.</p><p>The Mountains and Rivers Pearl was not a weapon of slaughter, but specialized in suppressing magical treasures!</p><p>Demon cultivators cultivated their own bodies and bloodline divine abilities, and did not place much importance on external objects. For example, the Nine-Lives Mysterious Turtle refined its shell, and its power was not inferior to magical treasures, even surpassing them in some aspects.</p><p>The power of a treasure collected by the Great Sage Heavenly Peng could be imagined.</p><p>The power of the Nine Nether Demonic Fire surpassed that of top-grade magical treasures, and of course it wouldn't be truly suppressed by the Mountains and Rivers Pearl, but it still experienced a moment of stagnation.</p><p>In a battle between experts, this small opening could be fatal!</p><p>Because, arriving alongside the Mountains and Rivers Pearl was the Mixing Demon Seal.</p><p>How could Old Demon Mixing Demons miss such a good opportunity!</p><p>The Mixing Demon Seal vibrated loudly, and the hundred-zhang phantom pierced through the phantom realm of the Mountains and Rivers Pearl, like a door in the void. Countless runes flickered alternately, its power still increasing, successively shattering the solidified demonic fire, rapidly approaching.</p><p>This strike could crush both of them into mincemeat.</p><p>Danger loomed.</p><p>Yet Qin Sang remained calm in the face of danger. He raised his head slightly, looking at the Mixing Demon Seal, utterly calm.</p><p>Behind him, another figure had appeared without anyone noticing.</p><p>The External Body Incarnation, with an expressionless face, focused on the Sun God Tree before him. Nearly half of his true essence was instantly devoured, and the three divine birds at the very top of the Sun God Tree shone brightly, spreading their wings and soaring.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>The divine birds instantly transformed into a scarlet flame.</p><p>Old Demon Mixing Demons and the Great Sage Heavenly Peng finally realized something was amiss, their expressions changing drastically.</p><p>By now, the Sun God Birds had already approached the Mixing Demon Seal and the Mountains and Rivers Pearl.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>At this moment, the assembled demons and monsters had an illusion that the flames inside the circular platform had erupted a second time. The power of the pseudo-numinous treasure struck like a heavy hammer, slamming hard against the hearts of the demons and monsters.</p><p>Everyone was shocked!</p><p>The red torrent of fire, carrying terrifying energy, swept across everything in the void.</p><p>The phantom realm of mountains and rivers conjured by the Mountains and Rivers Pearl, the hundred-zhang phantom of the Mixing Demon Seal, were instantly engulfed in the scarlet flames, crushed and swept clean.</p><p>In front of the Southern Brightfire, even the Nine Nether Demonic Fire seemed dim.</p>
