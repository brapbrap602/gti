<h1>Chapter 1170: The Wager</h1><p>---</p><p>“Are the two of you suggesting that I compensate you for your losses?”</p><p>Qin Sang was not surprised by this.</p><p>Having cultivated to this level, he stood at the pinnacle of the immortal cultivation world. At this stage, cultivators rarely engaged in life-and-death battles, as few had the confidence to completely annihilate their opponents.</p><p>If a Nascent Soul cultivator resorted to ruthless retaliation, it would be a headache for anyone involved.</p><p>“Since the two of you have come prepared, you must have already thought of your conditions. Why not speak plainly?”</p><p>Qin Sang also intended to resolve the enmity between them.</p><p>However, while he possessed treasures comparable to the Azure Phoenix Stone Slab, they were all of great use to him and could not be handed over so easily.</p><p>This was indeed a tricky situation.</p><p>Compensating with spirit stones would be ideal, but he knew that was out of the question.</p><p>“If you can produce an ancient demonic treasure of equivalent value, I might swallow my anger and let this matter rest!”</p><p>Demon King Qianji said coldly.</p><p>“How does Demon King Qianji plan to calculate the value of the Azure Phoenix Stone Slab?”</p><p>Qin Sang retorted, “The stone slab holds immense significance for the descendants of the Azure Phoenix, but in your hands, it’s nothing more than a useless relic stored away in a treasury. Other ancient treasures rarely possess such unique characteristics.”</p><p>Demon King Qianji glared, about to speak, but was stopped by the Serpent King.</p><p>“Since Fellow Daoist Mingyue is also willing to negotiate, there’s no need to beat around the bush. Qianji mentioned that you subdued a Four-Transformation Spirit Insect in his presence. To be honest, Fellow Daoist, in all our years of living, we’ve only read about such creatures in ancient texts. This is the first time we’ve seen one that has cultivated to the tribulation stage…”</p><p>Upon hearing this, Qin Sang’s expression changed instantly, and he let out a series of cold laughs.</p><p>“So that’s your plan! Trading the stone slab for a rare Four-Transformation Spirit Insect—what a fine bargain!”</p><p>The Serpent King remained unperturbed.</p><p>Demon King Qianji angrily retorted, “Do you think you’re the only one who can use this treasure? Although the Feather King is of the Cloud Eagle lineage, the Feather King Palace has inherited countless secret techniques over generations. It’s not impossible for them to unlock the secrets of the stone slab. If I hand over the Azure Phoenix Stone Slab to the Feather King, the rewards I receive will be no less than any treasure! That spirit insect resided near my cave—it should rightfully belong to me!”</p><p>Qin Sang couldn’t help but laugh, “By that logic, if I establish a cave in the Purple Micro Palace, should all the treasures within belong to me? That day, I used an illusion to block your vision, so you didn’t see clearly. That spirit insect was raised by me, nurtured with great care over hundreds of years, at the cost of countless resources. It just so happened that it emerged from its cocoon that day, triggering a tribulation near your cave.”</p><p>The two demon kings exchanged glances, half-convinced.</p><p>The Serpent King said, “I thought it strange. For a wild spirit insect to safely cultivate to the fourth transformation in a populated area is nearly impossible. So it was already under your care. Fellow Daoist, your methods are truly impressive, to raise a spirit insect to such a level. Fellow Daoist Zhu did not choose the wrong successor! It’s only natural that you wouldn’t want to part with it. But if the roles were reversed, would Qianji be willing to hand over a treasure related to an ancient demon?”</p><p>After a pause, the Serpent King continued gravely, “In the cultivation world, strength reigns supreme. Since that’s the case, I suggest the two of you settle this with your own abilities. Engage in a wager, and let the outcome decide. If Fellow Daoist Mingyue wins, the matter of the stolen treasure will be dropped. If Qianji wins, you will hand over the spirit insect. The fight will be to a draw, without harming mutual goodwill. I will not interfere and will serve as a witness. If you don’t trust me, the Ten Thousand Demon City is not far—we can invite the Feather King…”</p><p>“A wager?”</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at Demon King Qianji, pondering silently.</p><p>So this was their true intention.</p><p>Settling disputes through a contest of strength was not uncommon in the cultivation world.</p><p>The Serpent King had made it clear he wouldn’t interfere.</p><p>Facing Demon King Qianji alone, Qin Sang was confident in his treasures and abilities.</p><p>After forming his Nascent Soul, he had been eager to test his strength against a worthy opponent to gauge his true level and see how it compared to his earlier estimates. However, he had yet to find a suitable match.</p><p>In the Seven Slaughter Palace, he had witnessed several Nascent Soul cultivators and ancient demons in combat, but observing from afar was not the same as experiencing the danger firsthand.</p><p>Still, Qin Sang was well aware that the Serpent King and Demon King Qianji wouldn’t propose a wager without thorough preparation. He couldn’t afford to be careless.</p><p>After some consideration, Qin Sang refused again, “A wager is acceptable, but the terms must change. The spirit insect holds extraordinary significance for me, closely tied to my cultivation. I cannot part with it.”</p><p>The Heavenly Eye Butterfly was his life-bound spirit insect, with astonishing potential. He couldn’t risk it.</p><p>Demon King Qianji erupted in anger, “You refuse this and that—it seems you have no intention of resolving this matter!”</p><p>The Serpent King’s expression also darkened, “Fellow Daoist, your attitude suggests you’re not serious about resolving this enmity. A spirit insect tied to one’s cultivation—I’ve never heard of such a thing! We’ll take your word for it and make one final concession. If Qianji wins, you will lend us the spirit insect temporarily. Once we return from the Purple Micro Palace, it will be returned to you.”</p><p>Demon King Qianji and the Serpent King were relentless in their pursuit of the Heavenly Eye Butterfly, and Qin Sang found himself in a difficult position.</p><p>Their persistence made him wonder—were they planning to use the Four-Transformation Spirit Insect for some purpose in the Purple Micro Palace?</p><p>Qin Sang’s heart stirred.</p><p>If that were the case, there might still be room for negotiation.</p><p>In the end, Qin Sang reluctantly agreed.</p><p>“Lending the spirit insect to the two of you carries the risk of it being injured or even perishing. Fellow Daoists, don’t speak of compensation—in my eyes, no treasure can compare to it…”</p><p>The Serpent King saw through Qin Sang’s intentions, “Fellow Daoist, you wish to add another condition, don’t you?”</p><p>Qin Sang didn’t feel embarrassed about bargaining, “I wonder about the relationship between the Serpent King and the Beast Taming Sect. I would like to peruse the sect’s珍藏典籍.”</p><p>He hadn’t yet figured out the relationship between the Beast Taming Sect and the demon race, but the Serpent King surely knew.</p><p>“Although the founding patriarch of the Beast Taming Sect was supported by our demon race, they are still an outsider faction. Over time, their stance has grown somewhat ambiguous. We may need to seek the Feather King’s decree. However, if you only wish to study the sections on spirit insects, it shouldn’t be too difficult.”</p><p>The Serpent King readily agreed.</p><p>Qin Sang felt a pang of guilt, reflecting that he might not yet have fully adjusted to his new status as a Nascent Soul cultivator. Now that he stood at the pinnacle of the cultivation world, opportunities would abound in the future. There was no need to fret over temporary gains and losses.</p><p>“Very well, I shall spar with Fellow Daoist Qianji. Please set the rules, Serpent King.”</p><p>Qin Sang waved for Fatty Chicken and White Crane to step back.</p><p>The Serpent King also signaled for the demon soldiers to retreat.</p><p>“You cannot use Thunder Evasion!”</p><p>Demon King Qianji immediately proposed a restriction.</p><p>He remembered Qin Sang’s evasion techniques all too well and had no good way to counter them.</p><p>Qin Sang sneered, “Why not just tie my hands and feet while you’re at it?”</p><p>The Serpent King mediated, “Qianji has often praised Fellow Daoist Mingyue’s evasion techniques, privately holding you in high regard. If you keep evading, you could remain undefeated, rendering the fight pointless. However, evasion is part of your abilities, and forbidding it entirely would be unreasonable. How about we limit the battlefield’s范围…”</p>
