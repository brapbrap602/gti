<h1>Chapter 172: Celestial Corpse Talisman</h1><p>Chapter 172: Celestial Corpse Talisman</p><p>The owner of this Celestial Corpse Token must not have been low-ranked in the Celestial Corpse Sect, but neither was he/she very high-ranked. That was why only a fragmentary edition of the Celestial Yin Corpse Scripture was in the Celestial Corpse Token.</p><p>Qin Sang then picked up the black pouch. It was originally called a Corpse Puppet Pouch, a unique magic weapon of the Celestial Corpse Sect. It was used to store corpse puppets and could isolate corpse qi and baleful qi, so as to avoid detection.</p><p>The materials required for making a Corpse Puppet Pouch were not insignificant. Qi Refining Stage disciples could only use those bulky coffins to store zombies.</p><p>After collecting the three items, Qin Sang looked thoughtfully at the living corpse in front of him, recalling the contents about Celestial Corpse Talisman in the Celestial Yin Corpse Scripture.</p><p>Celestial Corpse Sect disciples would leave soul marks in the Celestial Corpse Talisman, in order to control living corpses through the Celestial Corpse Talisman.</p><p>Inside the ‘Nascent Soul’ of this living corpse, there must be a Celestial Corpse Talisman. It must have revealed its bloodthirsty nature because its owner had passed away and there was no one to control it.</p><p>If he could take this Celestial Corpse Talisman for his own, wouldn’t he then obtain a Corpse Puppet that was comparable to a Foundation Stage cultivator?</p><p>Given the strength of the Malevolent Corpse, it was very likely a Foundation Building Stage mid-term cultivator before being made into a living corpse.</p><p>Thinking of this, Qin Sang suddenly felt very eager. He glanced at Baiyun Mountain Person. This person must have had this in mind, and that was why he dared to risk everything.</p><p>After all, the ability to obtain a living corpse puppet would make one’s strength double. And that was just the obvious benefit.</p><p>No matter if one was exploring secret dimensions in the future, or when encountering danger, one could completely send out a living corpse that was unafraid of death, and who knew how much danger it could avoid.</p><p>He just didn’t know if he could succeed or not.</p><p>Thinking of this, Qin Sang carefully reviewed the Celestial Corpse Talisman secret technique. The secret technique to control the Celestial Corpse Talisman was not difficult. Qin Sang tried it several times and mastered it easily.</p><p>Unexpectedly, when Qin Sang activated the secret technique, sending soul consciousness into the living corpse’s body and attempting to control the living corpse, the living corpse suddenly let out an angry roar of surprise. That Celestial Corpse Talisman also suddenly shook dramatically, launching a terrifying counterattack that nearly tore Qin Sang’s soul consciousness into pieces.</p><p>Qin Sang hurriedly severed the connection with that strand of soul consciousness. His face was slightly pale and his eyes became deep. He realized that his thinking was too naive.</p><p>Every Celestial Corpse Talisman was carefully made by necromancers. In the process of making the Celestial Corpse Talisman, the soul mark would be integrated into it. Even if the person died, the soul mark would still be there. Replacing it was not so simple.</p><p>Unless the original owner dispersed the soul mark, otherwise it was impossible to subdue this living corpse.</p><p>However, Qin Sang wasn’t without gains. After he learned the secret technique of the Celestial Corpse Talisman, although he could not take the living corpse for his own use, since the living corpse had no owner, he could also use the secret technique and influence the living corpse’s actions through the Celestial Corpse Talisman, making it unable to exert its full strength.</p><p>Since he had already determined that he could not subdue it, Qin Sang stopped fantasizing and directly killed this monster.</p><p>The living corpse had no owner, so there was no one to help it resist the influence of the secret technique. Originally, its Profound Yellow Armor was very flexible and managed to block the sword qi from the Ebonywood Sword. However, affected by the secret technique, it immediately began to lag, and its effects were greatly reduced.</p><p>Qin Sang concentrated and activated the Ebonywood Sword. Taking advantage of the fact that the Profound Yellow Armor was sluggish, the sword qi surged, stabbing repeatedly in the same spot, leaving wounds that were deep enough to show bone. It wasn’t until the earth baleful qi on the living corpse no longer had time to repair that a sword pierced through the Malevolent Corpse’s head, strangling its ‘Nascent Soul.’</p><p>‘Bang!’</p><p>The living corpse fell to the ground, and unlike the previous Malevolent Corpse, it didn’t turn into a pile of ashes, but was still able to maintain a human form.</p><p>Qin Sang cast a flame, burning the living corpse, and with a beckon, he retrieved the Ebonywood Sword and the Yama Banner. After meditating slightly to recuperate, he turned his head and looked at the bodies of Baiyun Mountain Person and Wu Yuesheng, his face filled with a pondering expression.</p><p>Moments later, Qin Sang also burnt Wu Yuesheng’s body, but he sealed Baiyun Mountain Person’s body in an ice coffin.</p><p>In the Celestial Yin Corpse Scripture, the refining method for Malevolent Corpse Puppets required the corpses of Foundation Stage cultivators. Baiyun Mountain Person had murderous intentions first, so of course Qin Sang wouldn’t show him any mercy. He intended to refine him into a corpse puppet.</p><p>Unlike living corpses, after corpse puppets were refined, their strength was only slightly weaker than their strength in life.</p><p>If he used Baiyun Mountain Person to refine a Malevolent Corpse, its final strength should be slightly stronger than a Qi Refining Stage 13th Floor cultivator. Its physical body would be able to withstand attacks from Foundation Stage cultivators, but it would only be able to cause some trouble, and was a good helper.</p><p>Especially since he planned to enter the Ancient Immortal Battlefield to cultivate, the role of a corpse puppet would be even greater, because in the sparsely populated Ancient Immortal Battlefield, he wouldn’t be afraid of having the corpse puppet’s existence discovered.</p><p>However, Qin Sang didn’t dare treat Wu Yuesheng’s body in the same way. Baiyun Mountain Person was a wandering cultivator with no powerful backers, so even if he died, no one would avenge him. It was different for Wu Yuesheng.</p><p>**Haunted by Guilt**</p><p>Qin Sang knew that Shaohua Mountain would not ignore the inexplicable disappearance of a Foundation Establishment disciple. Whoever returned would have to face questioning by the sect.</p><p>The methods in the immortal cultivation world were countless. If any clue were to be discovered—although Wu Yuesheng had made the first move—Qin Sang would still be guilty of the same unforgivable crime: killing a fellow disciple and refining them into a corpse puppet.</p><p>He even had to find a chance to discard Wu Yuesheng’s Life-Bound Sword, Scarlet Flame.</p><p>Qin Sang then sealed away Liu Jiang’s remains. After all, Liu Jiang had helped lead the way. Qin Sang left his mustard seed pouch untouched, intending to return it to Liu Shan when they met. He wondered how Liu Shan would feel when he saw the corpse, so mutilated and unrecognizable from corpse poison.</p><p>Qin Sang then beckoned with his hand, collecting the relics of Baiyun Hermit and Wu Yuesheng. He casually erased all traces of the battle in the hall. By the time the Earth煞 Qi surged up, all clues would be wiped clean without the need for great precision.</p><p>While breaking the restrictions on the heavy 玄 Iron Door, he looked through their relics.</p><p>All of Wu Yuesheng’s magic tools and anything that could be linked to Shaohua Mountain had to be discarded. However, the spiritual stones, alchemical pills, and spiritual herbs could be kept.</p><p>His belongings were indeed quite substantial. The spiritual stones alone were the equivalent of more than eight hundred low-grade spiritual stones. Combined with Baiyun Hermit’s inheritance, Qin Sang’s gains amounted to more than twelve hundred low-grade spiritual stones.</p><p>After breaking through to the Foundation Establishment stage, Qin Sang had diligently cultivated in his cave abode. He had not used the five mid-grade spiritual stones that his sect had issued, and together with what he had previously, he had a net worth of approximately one thousand low-grade spiritual stones.</p><p>With two thousand two hundred low-grade spiritual stones, he would be able to buy a decent top-tier magic tool. As a Foundation Establishment cultivator, Qin Sang could now consider himself relatively well-off.</p><p>Aside from the Scarlet Flame Sword, Wu Yuesheng also possessed several excellent magic tools. Qin Sang could only toss them into his mustard seed pouch with a pained expression, planning to find a place to discard them. Compared to Wu Yuesheng, Baiyun Hermit appeared much less well-to-do. His strongest magic tool, the Heavenly Trapping Net, had been destroyed. Of the remaining magic tools, only a wooden staff called the Dragon Subduing Staff was worth mentioning. It was a top-grade magic tool of excellent quality and had other uses.</p><p>The main body of the Dragon Subduing Staff should have been a piece of spirit wood. Unfortunately, it had already been refined into a magic tool with other spiritual items, damaging the spirit wood’s structure. Thus, it could not be used to enhance the Ebony Sword.</p><p>After the Ebony Sword was refined into a Wooden Sword Spirit Fetus, it had indeed become powerful. However, in a sense, it had also become more fragile. Any dissonance could greatly diminish the spirit sword’s power or even cause it to collapse entirely. It could only be integrated with the most primitive spirit wood.</p>
