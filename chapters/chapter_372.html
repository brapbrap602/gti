<h1>Chapter 365: A Disguise</h1><p>Wandering Cloud pondered, "The last time I was here, my cultivation was far inferior to what it is now. A single protective amulet was sufficient for the journey. However, we're venturing into the inner valley of the third layer. As a precaution, we should purchase a couple more."</p><p>At Shadow Pass, Wandering Cloud had explained the situation to Qin Sang. Their objective lay within the inner valley of the Boundless Valley, the most perilous area.</p><p>If not for Wandering Cloud's knowledge of a specific route, their combined strength wouldn't guarantee their survival.</p><p>Qin Sang's role was to help Wandering Cloud restrain the strange individual and then retreat.  Wandering Cloud, however, would have to venture deeper alone, essentially gambling his life for a slim chance of success.</p><p>Wandering Cloud had clearly weighed the risks and benefits before making his decision, so Qin Sang offered no further dissuasion.  The path of immortality is arduous, offering no shortcuts to success.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded. Although expensive, the jade amulets posed no financial burden, and Wandering Cloud's suggestion was prudent. They discussed the matter further and decided to depart in two days.</p><p>"...I didn't expect Bright Moon's disciple to possess such exceptional talent. What are your thoughts? If you're too occupied to instruct him personally, I can recommend him to Lesser Hua Mountain for cultivation."</p><p>Qin Sang detailed the circumstances of Silent Heart and his disciple, Bright Moon, as well as Li Yufu's talent, seeking Wandering Cloud's opinion.</p><p>In the mortal realm, Li Yufu was Bright Moon's disciple and Wandering Cloud's great-grand-disciple.  This relationship could continue into their immortal cultivation.</p><p>If Wandering Cloud preferred not to be distracted, Qin Sang would recommend Li Yufu to Lesser Hua Mountain. This would be a significantly advantageous start compared to other cultivators.</p><p>"Silent Heart and his disciple remained true to their principles. Their deaths were noble!" Wandering Cloud expressed his admiration upon learning about the shrines erected by the grateful populace to honor Silent Heart and Bright Moon.</p><p>Hearing Qin Sang's inquiry about Li Yufu's future, Wandering Cloud mused, "Brother Qin, your insight is keen. After meeting the Tan brothers, I did consider taking on a disciple.  Since Li Yufu already has a connection to me through the mortal realm and possesses decent talent, there's no need for further arrangements. However, this journey into the Boundless Valley is fraught with uncertainty..."</p><p>Wandering Cloud paused, then produced a wooden token, handing it to Qin Sang. "This is a disciple token of the Great Elixir Sect.  Should I not return, I ask you to travel to Green Ram Temple and have Li Yufu present this token to the Great Elixir Sect as my disciple. I have some belongings stored in my sect's cave dwelling that he can inherit."</p><p>Wandering Cloud spoke of his potential demise with a detached calmness, as though discussing someone unrelated.</p><p>Qin Sang felt a pang of sadness but accepted the token with a forced smile. "Shouldn't you assess Li Yufu's character personally before making such a decision? What if he proves ungrateful and tarnishes your reputation?"</p><p>Wandering Cloud shook his head resolutely. "Someone deemed worthy by both Silent Heart and yourself cannot be ungrateful."</p><p>Qin Sang paused, then nodded slowly.</p><p>...</p><p>Two days later.</p><p>After ensuring they were in peak condition, Qin Sang and Wandering Cloud acquired two more jade amulets and left Green Sun Market, continuing their flight toward the heart of the Severed Sky Mountains.</p><p>Traveling tirelessly, they reached the vicinity of the Boundless Valley in just five days.</p><p>From a distance, they could see a crimson expanse in the eastern sky, blood-red clouds blanketing the horizon, stretching north and south beyond their sight.</p><p>Though named a valley, the Boundless Valley wasn't a typical ravine but a vast and enigmatic region.</p><p>Mountains undulated across this area.  The Boundless Valley lay deep within these peaks.  As they entered the mountain range, still some distance from the true Boundless Valley, a faint blood-red mist hung in the air, accompanied by an unnatural chill.</p><p>This blood-red mist was the noxious瘴qi emanating from the Boundless Valley.</p><p>A single breath of this瘴qi would chill a cultivator to the bone.  For those with insufficient cultivation, contact with the瘴qi could prove fatal, as the toxins would invade their internal organs, beyond any hope of recovery.</p><p>However, this mountain range was desolate, devoid of valuable spiritual herbs.  Unless venturing into the Boundless Valley itself, cultivators rarely came here.</p><p>Wandering Cloud gazed toward the Boundless Valley. "Brother Qin, the first layer of the Boundless Valley is relatively safe, but only compared to the second and third layers. It's still fraught with danger. Also, the first layer is where most cultivators operate.  Careless individuals often disturb demon lairs or trigger ancient restrictions, causing upheaval. The first layer's landscape changes frequently.  My previous experience might not be entirely reliable. We should find a guide or disguise ourselves as herb gatherers and join a group.  This will save us considerable time..."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded in agreement. The information he'd gathered at Green Sun Market corroborated Wandering Cloud's assessment.</p><p>The deeper into the Boundless Valley one ventured, the stronger the demons and monsters became. However, unlike the outer areas, they weren't found in large groups everywhere.  Those venturing deeper proceeded with extreme caution.</p><p>The first layer, on the other hand, was prone to frequent changes, even experiencing occasional stampedes of beasts.</p><p>...</p><p>Barren mountains.</p><p>Unremarkable from afar, but up close, faint ripples shimmered in the air.  These ripples repelled the blood-red mist, preventing it from entering.</p><p>Two streaks of light approached rapidly from the southwest. As they neared the mountains, the figures within the light seemed to notice the unusual ripples and abruptly halted.</p><p>The light dissipated, revealing Qin Sang and Wandering Cloud.</p><p>They exchanged a glance.</p><p>Wandering Cloud spoke, "These restrictions are only meant to block the noxious mist and provide an early warning.  There's no defensive formation, indicating it's one of the mobile markets. Let's enter.  We're sure to find a group of herb gatherers here."</p><p>These mobile markets were another unique aspect of the area outside the Boundless Valley.</p><p>If the Boundless Valley experienced upheaval, such as an expansion of the noxious mist or a beast stampede, the market's inhabitants would abandon it without hesitation, retreating to safety.  The simple restrictions were easy to establish, requiring minimal investment.</p><p>Once the Boundless Valley calmed down, they would return and rebuild the market in a new location.</p><p>Over time, this became customary.</p><p>The market Wandering Cloud had visited previously was now in ruins. They had expended considerable effort to locate this one.</p><p>"If anyone asks, tell them we're going into the Boundless Valley to collect Yellow Dragon Grass."</p><p>Qin Sang received Wandering Cloud's telepathic message and nodded slightly, following him into the market.</p><p>Yellow Dragon Grass primarily grew in the deepest parts of the first layer, near the second. By posing as Yellow Dragon Grass gatherers, they could infiltrate a group and then discreetly depart once they reached their destination.</p><p>The market's structures were crude.</p><p>Roughly hewn stones formed rudimentary houses, or crooked, low-slung wooden huts served as shops, scattered haphazardly across the mountainside.</p><p>The streets were equally irregular, lacking any semblance of planning.</p><p>Despite their unassuming appearance, many of these shops were branches of renowned businesses in the cultivation world.</p>
