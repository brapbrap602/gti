Chapter 264: Deadly Temptation

"Thank you for your righteous help."
Master Xuanyu bowed towards the sky, his voice was ethereal, knowing that he didn't have much time left, his tone was hurried, "I wonder what your name is, could you allow this one to see you once before death? In the netherworld, this one will certainly keep it in mind, never to be forgotten."
After a while, there was no reaction from the firebirds, the person inside had no intention of showing up.
Master Xuanyu shook his head in disappointment, he opened his mouth and spat out a cluster of green light, inside the green light was wrapped a talisman, the talisman's material was like green jade, with a complex seal script engraved in the middle, surrounded by golden patterns, very different from the Tiangang Sword Talisman and the Nine Dragons Chariot Talisman.
Even more peculiar was the fact that within the talisman, there was a miniature heavenly palace, surrounded by clouds, barely visible, extremely mysterious.
"Could it be the Inner Scenery talisman?"
Qin Sang was stirred.
As expected, he then heard Master Xuanyu say: "Benefactor should have heard just now, this talisman is the Inner Scenery talisman that the old devil Di Que is willing to do anything to get, this humble one is willing to use this to repay the benefactor. This humble one has lived for nearly four hundred years, and now that I am facing my doom, I can still face death calmly, this Inner Scenery talisman is the only trace that this humble one has left behind in this world, I only hope that the benefactor can make good use of it."
This talisman was indeed divine, according to Old Man Di Que, it could even help with Nascent Soul Formation, it was an unparalleled temptation to any cultivator.
However, Qin Sang remained hidden within the firebirds.
As though he didn't see the Inner Scenery talisman.
Master Xuanyu waited for a while, seeing no reaction, he let out a bitter laugh, the Nascent Soul became increasingly faint, until it dissipated, the Inner Scenery talisman in his hand slowly floated downwards.
Seeing that this treasure was about to be swallowed by the magma.
There was a commotion within the firebirds, a figure suddenly flashed out, swooped down, but as soon as the figure appeared, chains suddenly shot out from the void, bounding the figure, firmly restraining it.
At the same time, the Inner Scenery talisman that was about to fall into the magma silently shattered, like a scene reflected in the water, this talisman was originally non-existent.
Master Xuanyu's Nascent Soul actually reappeared, without any hesitation he lunged towards that figure.
In the next instant, that figure also shattered like the Inner Scenery talisman.
It was also an illusion.
Master Xuanyu's face was full of astonishment, after a long while, he suddenly came to a realization, laughing maniacally three times.
"Good! Good! Good!"
And died.
Hiding within the firebirds, Qin Sang was covered in cold sweat, the Inner Scenery talisman was a bait that emitted a powerful temptation, behind the bait was a deadly trap.
Master Xuanyu might be a righteous person, but in the face of the threat of death, how many people can stick to their principles?
Qin Sang didn't dare to bet.
Furthermore, when he sneak attacked Old Man Di Que, his strength had already been exposed.
Master Xuanyu must have also noticed that the one hiding in the shadows was just a Foundation Establishment cultivator, and he could also see from Old Man Di Que's final action that he and Qin Sang had an extraordinary relationship.
Master Xuanyu kept calling himself a benefactor, but how much of a favor did he actually owe Master Xuanyu?
If he had wanted to save people purely, he should have spoken up earlier.
In Master Xuanyu's eyes.
He and Old Man Di Que were in cahoots, working together to plot against him, they were both people who harbored evil intentions towards him. Him scheming against Old Man Di Que was nothing more than an internal conflict between conspirators.
If he hadn't hidden well, Master Xuanyu wouldn't have had to go through such great lengths, he could have directly captured him.
Looking at himself, Qin Sang also had to admit that he was an opportunist who wanted to profit from other people's misfortune.
Therefore, Qin Sang didn't believe that Master Xuanyu was truly grateful.
Of course, Qin Sang wasn't afraid of Master Xuanyu seizing his body, but just because Master Xuanyu failed to seize his body didn't mean he had no other way of dealing with him, even if a Core Formation cultivator only had their Nascent Soul left, they still had unfathomable abilities.
Fortunately, Master Xuanyu was on the verge of death, he was eager to seize a body, in his haste he didn't notice that the figure was just an illusion sent out by Qin Sang, using up the last of his remaining strength.
An hour later.
Only then did Qin Sang cautiously come out from the firebirds, looking at the silent space, emotions emerged on his face.
Two Core Formation cultivators had died here, Qin Sang only obtained one mustard seed pouch, the Heavenly Sound Conch was nowhere to be found.
Master Xuanyu had already given up his physical body when he burned his Golden Core, it was destroyed by Old Man Di Que, if there were any remains, they would have also fallen into the magma.
And until Master Xuanyu's Nascent Soul dissipated, Qin Sang hadn't seen the Inner Scenery talisman, could it be that he actually didn't have this talisman?
Qin Sang wondered in confusion, his gaze moving towards the stone palace below.
With his feet on solid ground, Qin Sang's tense nerves finally relaxed, he only felt that every part of his body was in pain, it was not an exaggeration to describe it as covered in wounds.
After swallowing two more Spirit Pills, he finally recovered slightly.

Qin Sang looked at the greenstone by the entrance of the stone hall. Xuan Yu Daoist seemed to have broken a part of the restriction on it as the light was dimmer than before. He put his palm on the restriction and roused his spirit power, but he was unable to move the stone hall at all.

After a few tries, Qin Sang shook his head and gave up.

Being able to escape the danger and his encounter with the ring of a Nascent Soul cultivator were already good fortunes. It was too greedy of him to think about the treasures in the stone hall.

Qin Sang withdrew his arm and was about to leave the place to wait for help at the crater when he caught sight of something from the corner of his eye. He moved and picked up the object.

It was half of the Nine Dragon Royal Carriage Talisman. The other half had fallen into the magma and was probably destroyed. Stripped of half, the Nine Dragon Royal Carriage Talisman lost its glow and the dragon beast spirit essence was gone. It was just like a white jade, inconspicuous.

To Qin Sang’s surprise, as soon as his finger touched the Nine Dragon Royal Carriage Talisman, there was a dragon’s cry.

The Nine Dragon Royal Carriage Talisman shook slightly. It was still struggling.

“Huh?”

Qin Sang let out a soft cry, and the spirit power in his palm flickered. He bound the Nine Dragon Royal Carriage Talisman and sent his divine sense into the esoteric talisman. He found that there was still a dragon beast spirit essence left inside. It was badly injured and had only half of its body, but it had managed to survive.

Sensing the presence of Qin Sang’s divine sense, the dragon beast spirit essence glared and attacked him!

“You dare to act recklessly!”

Qin Sang let out a cold snort and unleashed his divine sense to attack the Nine Dragon Royal Carriage Talisman without any reservation.

Before this, the dragon beast spirit essence had the strength of the peak of the Nascent Level. Qin Sang would never have been its match.

But the dragon beast spirit essence was badly injured now, and it was not difficult for him to capture it.

The Nine Dragon Royal Carriage Talisman was trembling and the dragon beast spirit essence was struggling violently, but its strength was weakening. In the end, it was suppressed and subdued by Qin Sang.

At this moment, Qin Sang gained a sudden realization.

It was no wonder that the old man of Di Que said that the esoteric talisman would not recognize an owner. Now that he had captured the dragon beast spirit essence, he could incorporate the esoteric talisman into his body with a little bit of refinement.

But once the esoteric talisman was taken by someone else, he would not be able to claim it back.

The Nine Dragon Royal Carriage Talisman was indeed an esoteric talisman to escape from danger.

After being refined, the esoteric talisman could control nine spirit essences which had to be the spirit essences from demonic beasts with dragon’s blood. To be recognized by the esoteric talisman, they had to be extracted when the demonic beast was near death.
