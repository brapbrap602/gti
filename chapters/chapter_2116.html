<h1>Chapter 2106: Seeing is Believing</h1><p>Si Lu's intentions were clear to Qin Sang, but he wouldn't deliberately help Si Lu avenge his family and reclaim the throne.</p><p>Ultimately, he was merely preparing for the worst.</p><p>If Si Lu's identity were revealed and the Lu family of Hanjiang attacked, and the Thunder Altar was already complete, Qin Sang would naturally show no mercy. If Si Lu's identity remained hidden, or if the Lu family deemed the cost too high and chose not to attack, Qin Sang wouldn't proactively attack; he didn't possess the necessary strength.</p><p>The situation's development would determine the outcome.</p><p>Moreover, in Qin Sang's view, the Mirage Tower Jewel was just a pipe dream.</p><p>The chances of an outsider entering the Yi Ren clan's sacred land were slim, so Qin Sang dismissed it without much hope.</p><p>If Si Lu truly succeeded, Qin Sang wouldn't mind visiting the sacred land, even though most opportunities might not suit him.  But it was the sacred site and training ground of Yi Ren clan's powerful ancestors, offering at least Nascent Soul level opportunities.  Obtaining even one would be immensely beneficial.</p><p>Of course, he'd maintain a positive attitude, treating it as an opportunity for broadening his horizons; gain or loss would be accepted with equanimity.</p><p>Si Lu had been observing Qin Sang's expression. Seeing this, he felt disheartened but understood the importance of patience; he said nothing more, silently putting away the Mirage Tower Jewel.</p><p>"So, we'll at least have a late Nascent Soul stage enemy," Qin Sang mused.</p><p>Si Lu nodded. "They don't know that Lord Xia has fallen. Once they receive the news, the Lu family's Grand Protector will definitely act personally, and he'll undoubtedly have other helpers."</p><p>The Lu family's Grand Protector was of comparable strength to Lord Xia.  Eliminating them would require more than just him.</p><p>It was unclear whether the Lu family had allies. If they had already formed an alliance with the Si You Royal Family, they needed to be prepared to face two or even three top-tier powerhouses.</p><p>Qin Sang remained calm, saying indifferently, "Once the Thunder Altar is complete, the number of enemies won't matter."</p><p>Si Lu sensed his unshakeable confidence, and his own anxieties subsided considerably.</p><p>…</p><p>Western Lands.</p><p>A magical vessel hovered in mid-air, with numerous figures continuously arriving from afar and landing below.</p><p>They were mostly young men and women, each brimming with spiritual energy, possessing exceptional talent, representing the future of their various clans and sects.</p><p>Seeing such a grand vessel for the first time, their youthful curiosity was hard to suppress. But when they considered the hopes their sects placed upon them, their moods turned heavy, their expressions somber and apprehensive.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>The vessel suddenly emitted several beams of light, forming a staircase in the void, and the cabin doors opened.</p><p>The group boarded the vessel in an orderly manner.</p><p>Above the vessel, Qin Sang and Si Lu stood side-by-side, Ji Hong perched on Si Lu's shoulder.</p><p>Qin Sang bowed to Su Nu, "We'll be back soon. If the Changyou clan attacks, hold them off for a while."</p><p>"Don't worry, Brother Qin. I understand."</p><p>Su Nu watched Qin Sang and the others board the vessel. The vessel trembled, then soared into the sky.</p><p>She returned the way she came, beginning her inspection of the major regions.</p><p>Currently, various clans and sects in the Storm World were working tirelessly to construct altars, facing various challenges.</p><p>Meanwhile, the vessel, cloaked in concealment, flew steadily at high altitude; Qin Sang and Si Lu worked together to mask its energy fluctuations.</p><p>Reaching the edge of this sea area, the vessel plunged into the fog, cutting through it with ease, quickly emerging on the other side.</p><p>Ji Hong identified the direction and guided Qin Sang to steer north.</p><p>The refuge Su Nu had chosen was located in the northeast of the Zhu Yan clan's territory, not far from the Storm World.</p><p>On their return journey, they had already discovered a safe route, so Qin Sang and Si Lu only needed to be wary of nearby energy fluctuations, preventing encounters with Yi Ren clan powerhouses.</p><p>The vessel gradually accelerated, proceeding smoothly until they reached the edge of the fog. Ji Hong located their marker, and the vessel plunged into the fog. After a swift journey, Qin Sang felt something, and cast an incantation.</p><p>The next moment, a bright light appeared ahead.</p><p>The fog was hazy, with indistinct shadows.</p><p>Below them wasn't the ocean, but a vast land, barren and desolate, covered in exposed rocks and yellow earth.  Occasional plants, adapted to survive in the fog, could be seen, but their growth was arduous.</p><p>A mountain range was faintly visible in the distance, with the light source on the other side of the range, like a giant lantern.</p><p>Approaching closer, those aboard the vessel were surprised to find that the other side of the mountain range was lush and green.</p><p>These trees were unlike any they had ever seen, their trunks straight, their crowns like giant open umbrellas. The source of the light was the veins of the leaves, forming a network of light that converged at certain points, resembling a bright starry sky.</p><p>These were clearly no ordinary trees, but a type of spiritual wood.</p><p>Under the radiance of the luminous tree, the area beneath it was as bright as day.  Even more remarkable, the aura seemed to repel the fog tide; while mist enveloped the surroundings and sky, the area below remained clear.</p><p>Because the tree's trunk was slender and its canopy immense, the space beneath was quite spacious, featuring a lake at its center—a veritable oasis in the desert.</p><p>This location was carefully chosen by Su Nu for its abundant spiritual energy.</p><p>The oasis is protected by a powerful array, crafted by Qin Sang. Upon arriving, Qin Sang immediately sensed its presence.</p><p>The array's fluctuations alerted QIng Jia and Qing Yi.  The two flew to the tree's crown, their faces alert.  Seeing the boat and Qin Sang at the helm, their expressions brightened.</p><p>“Qing Jia, Qing Yi, greetings to our Great Master.”</p><p>Su Nu and the others left them behind to manage the oasis, constructing shelters and dwellings;  they had earned a share in this place.</p><p>“These are the Qiqi trees, and the vines entwined around them are Qiqi vines.  Working together, they not only block the fog but also have the effect of confusing fog beasts. The Qiqi trees' light brightens with the sunrise and dims with the sunset, maintaining this rhythm even within the fog tide.  This light also nourishes all things, allowing normal routines for even ordinary people. This magical luminous wood was first discovered by our Jiaojiao tribe.”</p><p>Ji Hong pointed to the luminous tree, a proud look on his small face.</p><p>“Truly remarkable,” Qin Sang praised, inwardly thinking the Jiaojiao tribe was indeed a treasure trove.</p><p>Ji Hong, beaming with delight at the praise, glanced behind him.  “Unfortunately, the Qiqi trees have limitations.  A cluster of these trees is at its most powerful, but as their numbers increase, their effectiveness diminishes. Furthermore, the various types of Qiqi trees are rare; I only have these. You shouldn't cultivate too many here.”</p><p>Qin Sang surveyed the entire oasis. It comfortably accommodated everyone on board, but future needs must also be considered.</p><p>“Are there other luminous trees that could expand the oasis?” Qin Sang asked.</p><p>Ji Hong nodded. “Yes! Our ancestors continually sought ways to counter the fog tide.  If the fog tide were to engulf the entire Fog Sea permanently, where would the Yi Ren tribe find refuge? However, it was later discovered that the fog tide's power wasn't increasing, but rather gradually weakening, and the territories of various tribes were sufficient, so the search was put on hold. But records and seeds must still exist.”</p><p>“The fog tide's power is weakening?” Qin Sang asked.</p><p>“Perhaps,” Ji Hong shrugged. “Who knows if it's like the Polluted Land, subject to tidal changes, and we are currently experiencing a low tide? Even the lifespan of a Saint Realm expert is too short compared to the vastness of time.”</p><p>Qin Sang agreed with Ji Hong's assessment and asked, “Where can I obtain these seeds?”</p><p>“It depends on whether you can afford the price. This isn’t something a single tree can accomplish. It may require dozens or even hundreds of different types of flowers, plants, and trees working together—extremely complex. Each one is incredibly precious, and I don’t possess any…”</p><p>Ji Hong spread his hands. “I must consult the elders in the tribe, but even if I can find them, they may not be willing to see me.”</p><p>Si Lu interjected, “The whereabouts of the Jiaojiao tribe's elders are unpredictable; their training grounds could be anywhere, making them difficult to find.”</p><p>Ji Hong grumbled, “They're afraid someone will steal their results.  Humph, narrow-minded! I'm more afraid they'll take advantage of their seniority and snatch the luminous seeds I discovered first!”</p><p>“Why search for them externally? Doesn’t the Jiaojiao tribe have a territory?”</p><p>Yu Nu couldn't help but ask.</p><p>Yu Nu would remain in the oasis to oversee it, as Li Yu Fu and Shen Chen had their duties, and Huan Hen needed battlefield experience, so Yu Nu was sent.</p><p>“We do, but it’s not what you imagine; ordinary people can’t find it.  And…”</p><p>Ji Hong seemed to recall unpleasant memories, pouting. “Our Jiaojiao tribe has a small population; I barely managed to get out. If I go back, they'll force me into breeding, and I won't do it!”</p><p>Qin Sang and the others chuckled.</p><p>As they spoke, the boat sailed into the oasis, depositing the younger generation. Yu Nu bowed, disembarked, gathered everyone, gave instructions, and made arrangements.</p><p>Qin Sang watched for a while, then said to Si Lu, “Let's go.”</p><p>The return journey was less cumbersome, eliminating the need for the boat. The two used their escape techniques and flew.</p><p>Soon, they arrived near the heart of the Zhu Yan tribe's territory and landed on a mountain peak.</p><p>Ji Hong hopped off Si Lu's shoulder, worriedly saying, “Be careful.”</p><p>Si Lu nodded.  "Please wait here, I'll be right back!"</p><p>With that, Si Lu soared into the air, taking out the token given by Yuan Miao and activating the inscription on it.</p><p>Shortly after, the token vibrated slightly, indicating a direction. Si Lu altered his course and soon arrived before a mountain.</p><p>The mountain was covered with lush pines and cypresses, with winding paths leading into its depths.</p><p>Si Lu landed on a large flat rock. Thick vines, like pythons, hung down from the cliff face above. He spotted a cave with an open stone door, moss growing on either side of the entrance, and a clear stream meandering past it, its water gently flowing.</p><p>"What a secluded sanctuary!" Si Lu exclaimed.</p><p>A hearty laugh came from within. Yuan Miao quickly walked out, and upon seeing only Si Lu, said disappointedly, "Daoist Qin didn't come?"</p><p>Si Lu, understanding the Zhu Yan's temperament, didn't take offense. He smiled and said, "I've come today to ask a favor."</p><p>Fortunately, the Zhu Yan weren't completely oblivious to the ways of the world. Yuan Miao gestured invitingly.  "Daoist Qu, please come inside."</p><p>Entering the cave, they settled down.</p><p>Si Lu got straight to the point, explaining his situation: "I'm estranged from my clan and seek refuge.  A land, Storm Continent, lacks a ruling clan and wishes to become my vassal.  I understand the rules of the Ancient Covenant and swear I will not overstep boundaries.  Any trouble arising will not involve the Zhu Yan or other Imperial Clans."</p><p>Yuan Miao was taken aback. "Daoist Qu means there's a continent next to the Chang You territory, inhabited by outsiders who have pledged allegiance to you?"</p><p>Noticing Yuan Miao's expression, Si Lu felt a pang of doubt.  Could the Zhu Yan truly be unaware of Storm Realm?</p><p>He and Qin Sang had analyzed the situation.  Logically, the sudden appearance of so many outsiders in their territory should be impossible to miss.  If they truly didn't know, it meant that the Chang You clan had maintained excellent secrecy, and the Zhu Yan strictly adhered to the Ancient Covenant, never interfering in the internal affairs of Imperial Clans.</p><p>The Ancient Covenant was rigid, but its application was flexible. Some superior clans sought absolute control over their vassal clans, while others, like the Jiao Jiao clan, remained aloof.</p><p>For the vassal clans, both scenarios had advantages and disadvantages.</p><p>Given the Zhu Yan's temperament, it was entirely possible.</p><p>This was undoubtedly good news for them. If the Zhu Yan didn't even bother controlling vassal clans, they would likely not oppose Storm Realm.</p><p>"That's correct.  Brother Qin is from Storm Continent and their leader," Si Lu replied calmly.</p><p>"Daoist Qin?  Isn't he Daoist Qu's guard, who came with you from outside?" Yuan Miao questioned.</p><p>Si Lu and Qin Sang had already prepared their explanation. "This land is Brother Qin's homeland.  He left long ago due to an accident and, after cultivating to a higher level, found his way back. He wishes to be my guard for ease of operation in the Mist Sea. As you know, the Mist Sea is our realm, so Brother Qin has decided to become my vassal."</p><p>"Have they fought with the Chang You clan?" Yuan Miao asked.</p><p>"They have been at war for generations, a blood feud!"</p><p>Si Lu nodded. "Neither side had a Stage Two Void cultivator until Brother Qin returned. He didn't attack the Chang You, hoping to resolve the conflict.  But the Chang You leader unexpectedly broke through and somehow discovered Brother Qin's identity, gathering several helpers to attack.  Brother Qin is powerful, and both sides are wary, so there hasn't been an actual war. But the situation is spiraling out of control. Brother Qin is alone and worried you'd favor the Chang You, so he sought my protection."</p><p>Si Lu paused. "Of course, if you could persuade the Chang You to back down and recognize Storm Continent as the outsiders' ancestral land, Brother Qin would be willing to resolve the conflict between the two clans."</p><p>He didn't want to see Storm Realm and Chang You reconcile, as that would render him useless.  But he knew trust was hard-earned, and it was best not to act behind Qin Sang's back.</p><p>Besides, a thousand-year-old blood feud wasn't easily resolved.</p><p>"This..."</p><p>Yuan Miao stood up and paced.  "I rarely interfere in the affairs of vassal clans and cannot decide. I must report this to my superiors. Please wait here, Daoist Qu."</p><p>Si Lu readily agreed and saw him off.</p><p>Yuan Miao left, clouds forming beneath his feet, disappearing into the sky in moments.</p><p>Si Lu waited by the stream. After only an incense stick's worth of time, Yuan Miao returned, faster than expected.</p><p>"I'll go to Storm Continent myself. I need to see it for myself," Yuan Miao landed, his voice heavy.</p>
