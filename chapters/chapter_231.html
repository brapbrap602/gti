Chapter 224** Mission

Qin Sang understood that this was a polite remark from the Wandering Cultivator.
Even without the Wandering Cultivator's help, he could break free from the siege of the Cloud Beasts, but the price would be great; he would definitely lose more than just a black shield magic tool, and he was sure the Wandering Cultivator would be in the same boat.
"Senior, you've been traveling west for half a year. You must be returning with a bountiful harvest. I wonder if you resolved the hidden dangers in your body?" Qin Sang asked casually while reinforcing the restrictions of the shelter.
In fact, Qin Sang had a hunch that there hadn't been much change in the Wandering Cultivator's aura compared to six months ago. He estimated the results wouldn't be very good.
The Wandering Cultivator, who was also helping out, gave a bitter laugh when he heard this.
"Half a year has passed in vain. Fortunately, this old man didn't have too much hope to begin with… But it's not a complete loss. I've gathered some somewhat reliable information; it's not a complete waste of a trip…"
As he spoke, the Wandering Cultivator glanced at Qin Sang, seeming to want to say something but hesitating. After a moment's deliberation, he changed the subject and asked: "Brother Qin, are you cultivating here or just passing through? I wonder if Brother Qin knows the exact location of a nearby Heavenly Crystal Secret Realm?"
"Heavenly Crystal Secret Realm?" Qin Sang was surprised. "Senior is going to the Heavenly Crystal Secret Realm? What a coincidence! My cave府 is in the Heavenly Crystal Secret Realm."
The Wandering Cultivator was overjoyed when he heard this. "Such a coincidence?"
Then, he remembered Qin Sang's background and suddenly realized. "No wonder I met Brother Qin there. Could Brother Qin be one of the guardians of the Heavenly Crystal Secret Realm?"
Qin Sang shook his head. "I'm a member of the Shadow Guard. My cave府 is placed in the Heavenly Crystal Secret Realm only so that I have a place to rest when cultivating nearby. I'm not a guardian of the secret realm. However, since I cultivate in the secret realm, I won't stand idly by if the Heavenly Crystal Secret Realm is attacked. The real guardian of the Heavenly Crystal Secret Realm is another person, Senior Brother Teng Nan from the Shangyuan Pure Palace. I'm on my way back to my cave府. After the celestial phenomenon ends, you can come with me, Senior. However, you need Senior Brother Teng Nan's approval to enter the secret realm. Of course, as someone from the Taiyi Alchemy Sect, as long as you have a good reason, Senior Brother Teng Nan will definitely not make things difficult for you."
The existence of the Shadow Guard was not a secret among the three major sects. Only when carrying out missions did they need to remain strictly confidential. Qin Sang didn't need to hide his identity from the Wandering Cultivator.
"To be honest, this old man has also joined the Shadow Guard. This time, I received a message from my sect, assigning me a mission, ordering me to meet up with others in the Heavenly Crystal Secret Realm. Unexpectedly, I was suddenly attacked by a celestial phenomenon halfway there. Because I was not familiar with the terrain, I rushed into the lair of the Cloud Beasts. By the time I came to, I was already surrounded by Cloud Beasts. Then, I met Brother Qin." The Wandering Cultivator sounded rather depressed, feeling quite helpless at this unexpected disaster.
Qin Sang understood. The terrain of the mountain where the Cloud Beasts gathered was very strange. The area was filled with several towering peaks squeezed together—the nests of the Cloud Beasts. Most of the Cloud Beasts lived there.
Two of these mountain ranges extended out far, forming a narrow angle, with many Cloud Beasts lurking in the mountains.
Those unfamiliar with the terrain, who were in a hurry and not paying much attention, would be like the Wandering Cultivator, accidentally wandering into the heart of the Cloud Beasts' territory. Once they alerted the Cloud Beasts, they would immediately be surrounded by them, making it difficult to escape.
As for the Wandering Cultivator's mission, Qin Sang didn't ask about it in detail. Inquiring about Shadow Guard missions was a taboo, and it wouldn't do him any good.
The two agreed to return to the Heavenly Crystal Secret Realm together after the celestial phenomenon ended and chatted idly as they waited. They found more and more in common, and they spoke mostly about the Great Sui and Reverend Xinxin.
The Wandering Cultivator grew up in the Great Sui, and he was over 70 when he left. When Qin Sang arrived in this world, he spent his first few years in the Great Sui as well, so he had vivid memories of it.
However, in the Wandering Cultivator's memories, the Great Sui was already a thing of the past. His impression of Reverend Xinxin also stopped many years ago. Most of what he knew was from Qin Sang, and he had a look of reminiscence on his face.
As they talked, Qin Sang exchanged cultivation insights with the Wandering Cultivator. The Wandering Cultivator had many unique insights, from which Qin Sang benefited a lot.
"There's a Taiyi Alchemy Sect disciple named Jiang Ying in the Heavenly Crystal Secret Realm. Do you know him, Senior?"
The Wandering Cultivator thought for a moment and shook his head. "I don't know this person. After my Core Formation breakthrough, I left the sect and have been wandering around without a fixed abode, more like a lone cultivator. I rarely interacted with my fellow disciples."
Qin Sang secretly thought that he was similar to the Wandering Cultivator.
With poor talent and no support in the sect, he could only rely on himself for cultivation. Apart from enjoying the public resources of the sect, he wasn't much different from a lone cultivator.
Of course, these resources were out of reach for lone cultivators, so Qin Sang wasn't ungrateful.
Qin Sang suppressed the emotions in his heart and said with a smile: "Jiang Ying is an admirer of yours, Senior. He says that not only did you succeed in your Core Formation at the ripe old age of a hundred, an unprecedented feat, but you also surpass your peers in your attainments in alchemy."

She has always admired you, and she’s always regretted that you didn't meet her senior before, so this wish can finally be fulfilled on this occasion…”
Traveling Monk burst into laughter and hollered, “I need to see which little girl is so complimentary to an old man like me! I am indeed somewhat confident about my knowledge of alchemy on the cultivation path, but the number of alchemy geniuses of the Taiyi Immortal Sect is innumerable; I definitely do not dare to say that I am better than my peers. Do not believe the mockery, my brother Qin.”
Traveling Monk’s demeanor was a display of modesty, but Qin Sang could hear a hint of lofty pride from his tone. It was evident that Traveling Monk must have some uncommon proficiency in alchemy to have such self-confidence; it was not just flattery from Jiang Ying.
Qin Sang looked subtly; although the incompleteness of his foundation was not a problem for the time being, as his cultivation level increased, he would have to face its bitter consequences sooner or later.
No matter whether it was sooner or later, repairing his incomplete foundation was necessary.
He had tried common pills, but they were worthless.
He figured that he needed a spirit pill of at least the rank of Hunyin Pill, Five Treasures Divine Ointment Pill and Snow Ginseng Jade Birth Pill.
Perhaps he even needed a more valuable spirit pill to have any effect on him.
Even these three spirit pills were hard to obtain – not to mention the high price; he could continue working hard to earn spirit stones – what worried him most was that there were too few of these pills. The Taiyi Pill Pavilion only released one of these pills every few decades, and the competition was intense.
There was no need to mention the spirit pills that were even more valuable than these three; one could not buy them, even with spirit stones.
In comparison to refined spirit pills, gathering the ingredients for the spirit pills was likely to be easier.
In the world of immortal cultivation, it was not difficult to find alchemical formulas, but it was difficult to collect the ingredients, and it was also difficult to find a reliable master alchemist.
After learning from Jiang Ying that Traveling Monk was extremely talented in alchemy, Qin Sang started to think about this. If Traveling Monk really was a master alchemist, as long as he built a good relationship with him, perhaps there might be a time in the future when he could ask him for help.
Of course, Qin Sang would not skimp on the necessary compensation.
However, Qin Sang did not mention his intentions directly.
Besides the connection they had through Tranquil Heart Daoist, they had recently been through hardships together, but it was still not enough for him to get to know Traveling Monk.
Although one could nurture a virtuous person like Tranquil Heart Daoist, Traveling Monk's frame of mind should not be underestimated. But as time changes and circumstances change, who can guarantee that a person's heart will not change?
In any case, Qin Sang was not in a hurry; there would be plenty of time in the future to slowly get to know him.
