<h1>Chapter 476 Conjectures</h1><p>Qin Sang hesitated. "Given Senior Qingzhu's power, and yet he fell in that place, it must be incredibly dangerous. I'm only at the Foundation Establishment stage..."</p><p>"Qingzhu's death had other causes. However, that place is located in an ancient hall within the inner sanctum of the Purple Lunar Palace.  Of course, it's not without danger. If you're afraid of death..."</p><p>As she spoke, Granny Jing's voice abruptly stopped. She turned her head towards the outside of the hall, her brows furrowing as she seemed to notice something. After a moment of contemplation, she pointed at the handsome young man Qin Sang was carrying and asked, "What do you plan to do with him?"</p><p>"I..."</p><p>Qin Sang opened his mouth.</p><p>Before he could answer, Granny Jing shook her head. "I don't care what you want to do.  Let me warn you, this man's identity is not simple. If you don't want to be implicated, it's best not to take him out of Skyreach Peak, not even his body.  Including the few talismans and magical tools on him, they're quite unique, belonging solely to the Yuan Mirage Sect."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded gravely. "Rest assured, Senior, I understand the gravity of the situation. However, the opposite side was hit by a spatial storm triggered by Elder Starhand.  There's less than half an hour left before Skyreach Peak is sealed off. Is there still time?"</p><p>"No need to worry. Although the plaza's spiritual array is damaged, the remaining formations are sufficient to stabilize space and smooth out the spatial storm.  As long as we can open this door..."</p><p>Granny Jing looked down at the stone platform, her fingers dancing as she sent out several bursts of spiritual energy onto the platform below her feet.</p><p>As the runes on the stone platform lit up, the entire hall began to tremble.</p><p>It shook like an earthquake, the tremors growing increasingly violent. The stone pillars surrounding the hall emitted bright light, each topped with a mid-grade spirit stone.</p><p>A beam of light shot from every pillar towards the top of the platform, directly above Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang quickly looked up and saw an exceptionally pure eight-sided crystal, suspended in mid-air and slowly rotating, where the beams of light converged.</p><p>The crystal was neither large nor small, just barely able to be grasped in one hand. It seemed to be absorbing the power of the stone pillars, growing increasingly brighter.</p><p>The runes on the stone platform and the crystal were connected by a beam of light. A strange power was transmitted down, revealing a closed door on the platform. The light emitted by the crystal converged in front of the door.</p><p>When it reached a certain point, Granny Jing pointed a finger at the crystal, and all the changes abruptly ceased.</p><p>Granny Jing nodded slightly and murmured, "Just as I thought, the emergence of Skyreach Peak activates this restriction... After a quarter of an hour, when the spatial storm on the other side subsides, you open this door and leave this place. During this time, stay within the hall, don't touch this crystal, and don't leave. The space within this immortal mansion is even more unstable than Skyreach Peak. If you can't suppress your cultivation, you'll follow in Elder Starhand's footsteps.  The same applies after returning to Skyreach Peak. It's best not to use the Void Thunder there..."</p><p>"Think it over, and if you decide to go, meet me at Hanging Skull Pass before the Purple Lunar Palace opens..."</p><p>With that, Granny Jing leaped off the stone platform, her white robes fluttering. Her movement technique was astonishing; she reached the exit in the blink of an eye.</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't expected Granny Jing to leave in such a hurry. His heart skipped a beat, and he quickly called out to her, "Senior, there's no need to consider. I'll go!"</p><p>If the Purple Lunar Palace was truly as Granny Jing described, as long as he was careful, there shouldn't be any major problems.</p><p>As for the place where Senior Qingzhu died and the extent of the danger within, he would have to see it for himself.</p><p>Even if he couldn't obtain Senior Qingzhu's cultivation method this time, he could scout the place and gain experience for the next time.  When the Purple Lunar Palace opened again, he would be much more prepared.</p><p>Moreover, Granny Jing was elusive. If he missed this opportunity, he might never get another one, and he would regret it later.</p><p>This trip, he had to go.</p><p>Qin Sang spoke quickly, feigning concern. "I've heard that those of us with insufficient cultivation need a token to enter the Purple Lunar Palace. Tokens are extremely rare and hard to come by. I don't know if I can..."</p><p>Granny Jing paused, turning her head to give Qin Sang a deep look before tossing something towards him and drifting away.</p><p>Qin Sang caught it, feeling a soft texture in his hand.</p><p>Unfolding it, he saw it was indeed a sheepskin scroll, much like his own.</p><p>Holding the sheepskin, Qin Sang pondered, "I wonder if Wanderer Yun has obtained any heavenly materials and earthly treasures? Has he recovered from his injuries? Will he still enter the Purple Lunar Palace?"</p><p>Even if Wanderer Yun didn't need it, he could sell it for a good price.</p><p>Putting away the sheepskin, Qin Sang reflected on the encounters and insights of this short period, lost in thought.</p><p>For some reason, he felt that this immortal mansion wasn't simple. It was just that he had been constantly bombarded with news from Granny Jing, disrupting his thoughts and leaving him no time to think carefully.</p><p>Looking around the empty hall, Qin Sang's eyes suddenly lit up. He remembered something about why Senior Qingzhu had left Shaohua Mountain.</p><p>Senior Qingzhu's beloved had obtained a great treasure while exploring an immortal mansion.  However, the news leaked, and she was besieged and killed by her companions, including two Golden Core cultivators from the Yuan Mirage Sect.</p><p>Afterward, Senior Qingzhu stormed the Sword Gate Pass, left his sect, and spent over a decade taking revenge, eventually finding an opportunity to attack the Yuan Mirage Sect, killing two Golden Core cultivators to avenge his beloved.</p><p>Immortal mansion, Yuan Mirage Sect, Leng Yuntian, Granny Jing, Senior Qingzhu, Purple Lunar Palace…</p><p>What kind of treasure was worth the Yuan Mirage Sect's Golden Core cultivators losing all face and committing such a heinous act of murder and robbery?</p><p>Could the so-called treasure be merely a key?</p><p>Qin Sang looked up at the crystal, connecting the dots in his mind.</p><p>The fate of Senior Qingzhu and his beloved…</p><p>The Star Essence Stones of Skyreach Peak could be used to set up ancient formations, holding great significance for the Yuan Mirage Sect…</p><p>Both Senior Qingzhu and Granny Jing had a grudge against the Yuan Mirage Sect…</p><p>Granny Jing had an unusual understanding of Senior Qingzhu and the *Yuanshen Raising Sword Scripture*…</p><p>Right, and Granny Jing's personality. Her lifelong hatred for those who murdered and robbed their companions must have a reason.</p><p>The more Qin Sang thought, the more he felt that Granny Jing was likely closely related to Senior Qingzhu.</p><p>Could the immortal mansion Senior Qingzhu's beloved entered be this one?</p><p>Could that ambush be the root of everything, its repercussions continuing to this day?</p><p>Could there be someone else behind the two Golden Core cultivators of the Yuan Mirage Sect who ambushed Senior Qingzhu's beloved?</p><p>If that were true, could the one who severely injured Leng Yuntian in the Purple Lunar Palace be…</p><p>Was Granny Jing's attack on Leng Yuntian a personal vendetta, or were there other reasons?</p><p>Lost in thought, Qin Sang entertained countless conjectures, finding that all questions ultimately converged on one point—what was the relationship between Granny Jing and Senior Qingzhu?</p><p>Or, what was the relationship between Granny Jing and Senior Qingzhu's beloved?</p><p>The sect's records shouldn't be false. Senior Qingzhu was an ascetic cultivator, daring to cultivate the *Yuanshen Raising Sword Scripture*, he must have been someone devoted to the Great Dao.</p><p>He hadn't heard of Senior Qingzhu having any close relatives.</p>
