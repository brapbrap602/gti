<h1>Chapter 1384: Withering</h1><p>'Boom!'</p><p>Lightning struck the sea.</p><p>The seawater was instantly pierced, revealing an unfathomable void. Waves surged into the sky, glittering with silver light. Countless silver snakes swam through the waves, scattering like a peacock spreading its tail, more dazzling than the bright moon, illuminating the entire night sky.</p><p>Impacted by the aftershock of the thunder, Bifang's speed involuntarily slowed down.</p><p>Qin Sang seized the opportunity to rapidly approach.</p><p>The distance between the two was greatly reduced.</p><p>Bifang glared at Qin Sang resentfully, spread its wings wide, and suddenly fanned them at Qin Sang.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>A gale arose.</p><p>Qin Sang's vision was filled with a patch of blood red.</p><p>Looking closely, the essence of these blood red entities turned out to be blood-colored feathers, each extremely sharp, showering down like arrows.</p><p>These feathers were not solid, appearing illusory, but their power was not to be underestimated.</p><p>Qin Sang became wary.</p><p>He had made up his mind not to fight Bifang to the death, and to guard against Bifang using underhanded means.</p><p>Therefore, before determining the power of Bifang's magical art, he would not act rashly, immediately slowing down, not allowing these feathers to get close.</p><p>'Swoosh!'</p><p>A glint of golden light flashed.</p><p>The Golden Sink Sword  was like a swimming dragon, emitting a deep sword hum. Although it was still a Top Grade Magical Treasure, in Qin Sang's hands, its power was not inferior to other magical treasures by half.</p><p>The sword trembled, splitting into streaks of bright sword light.</p><p>Golden light filled the sky, dazzling and radiant.</p><p>It clashed head-on with the blood red.</p><p>Qin Sang's thoughts flickered, the Golden Sink Sword , accompanied by a rain of swords formed by sword light, imposing and mighty, shot out.</p><p>'Rumble!'</p><p>In mid-air, the blood red and the rain of swords collided fiercely.</p><p>The momentum shook the heavens.</p><p>Half of the sky was dyed red, the other half golden and brilliant.</p><p>'Bang bang bang...'</p><p>Loud noises continued.</p><p>Faintly, one could see feathers shattering, and sword light being destroyed.</p><p>It seemed that neither side had gained any advantage.</p><p>Bifang fanned its wing only to impede Qin Sang's progress, and without waiting for a victory, it flapped off and left.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression did not show the slightest panic. Sensing the power of these blood-colored feathers, he felt relieved, and decisively, man and sword became one, piercing through the blood red.</p><p>â€¦</p><p>'Swoosh!'</p><p>A crescent-shaped sword energy followed closely, at an exceptionally tricky angle.</p><p>Bifang's left wing tightened, transforming its wing into a blade, chopping down vertically, its feathers standing straight, with a layer of blood-colored luster flowing.</p><p>'Clang!'</p><p>The sound of metal clashing.</p><p>Bifang was unscathed.</p><p>But the impact that followed caused its figure to be slightly skewed.</p><p>Bifang was desperately entangled by Qin Sang. A series of attacks were continuous, making it extremely annoyed, but it had no good way to deal with Qin Sang unless it stopped for a great battle.</p><p>One scarlet and one azure streaks of light streaked across the night sky.</p><p>It was laughable that not long ago it was Bifang chasing after Qin Sang, but now the positions were reversed.</p><p>But even if Bifang was focused on escaping, the distance between Qin Sang and it was gradually closing.</p><p>Just then, Qin Sang suddenly put away the Golden Sink Sword .</p><p>He did not display the Seven Soul Killing Formation in public, although using the sword formation to block Bifang might have been easier.</p><p>What he summoned next was the Demon Banner.</p><p>When he was chased by the Frog-Fish, he had once cast Demon Fire, trying to ambush the Frog-Fish, but failed in the end. The Demon Fire had already been exposed, and there was no need to hide it any longer.</p><p>A burst of ear-piercing sound of air being torn apart came.</p><p>The momentum was not as great as the Golden Sink Sword .</p><p>Bifang's heart was alarmed. Turning its head, it saw a black fire snake flying towards it. The aura exuded by the Nine Nether Demon Fire made its mind suddenly tense, reminding it of the Frog-Fish's previous warning.</p><p>This person has a strange black fire. The Frog-Fish was momentarily careless and almost fell for it, feeling the threat of death, and still had lingering fear.</p><p>This must be the Demon Fire!</p><p>It did not dare to use its body to resist it again, and helplessly, it had to dodge to the side.</p><p>The next moment.</p><p>The black fire snake brushed past Bifang.</p><p>Feeling the aura exuded by the Demon Fire at close range, Bifang's heart shook, and its eyes changed somewhat. Although it had learned from the Frog-Fish that the Demon Fire was extraordinary, it never expected it to be so powerful, more terrifying than any kind of spiritual fire it had ever seen!</p><p>"Disperse!"</p><p>Qin Sang's thoughts flickered, and the Demon Fire suddenly burst apart, turning into a sea of fire.</p><p>The raging flames seemed to ignite the night sky. The black Demon Fire appeared incredibly eerie under the moonlight, and with a 'whoosh', it pounced on Bifang.</p><p>Bifang's eyelids twitched rapidly, its long neck tightened, and it let out a sharp cry towards the sky. The feathers all over its body stood straight, and its entire body was ignited with blood-colored flames.</p><p>'Whirr!'</p><p>Blood flames soared into the sky, almost obscuring Bifang's true form.</p><p>The Demon Fire pressed over.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>Two peerless spiritual fires collided, and a shocking wave swept out, directly evaporating a layer of water.</p><p>All around were exploding sparks, more brilliant than fireworks.</p><p>The night sky became the world of fire.</p><p>Qin Sang let out a soft exclamation, somewhat surprised. The blood flames displayed by Bifang were of an unknown magical art, and their power was truly not weak. Although the blood flames were no match for the Demon Fire and were being devoured, they had the power to resist.</p><p>Based on this alone, Bifang was much better than Dongyang Bo.</p><p>Worthy of being a long-standing powerhouse dominating one side!</p><p>These thoughts flashed through his mind, but Qin Sang's actions were not affected. He silently urged the Demon Banner, adding two more points of strength.</p><p>Just when Qin Sang and Bifang were inextricably entangled.</p><p>On the other side.</p><p>The experts of the two races had fought countless times, and the situation was constantly changing.</p><p>However, they had a common goal - the Xuantiangong traitor!</p><p>Because of this, both sides were worried that the Xuantiangong traitor would escape. They had no intention of fighting to the death here. Even during fierce battles, they did not stop flying away.</p><p>Later, they even left Qin Sang and Bifang behind.</p><p>No one disturbed the battle between Qin Sang and Bifang.</p><p>The Human Race was confident that they had the mid-Nascent Soul Wind Elder, and their chances of winning were very high.</p><p>The demon kings also understood that the situation was very unfavorable to them, so they could only change their strategy, find the Xuantiangong traitor as soon as possible, and hope that Bifang could get rid of Qin Sang's entanglement on its own.</p><p>Demon kings and Nascent Soul cultivators, who were rarely seen on weekdays, started chasing here.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, they swept across the sea.</p><p>Looking from afar, streaks of rainbow light of various colors sometimes intertwined and sometimes dispersed, incomparably gorgeous.</p><p>"Everyone be careful, we're almost there!"</p><p>Island Lord Shen reminded via sound transmission, sighing, "I didn't expect Daoist Mingyue's strength to be so strong, she actually managed to hold back Bifang!"</p><p>Upon hearing this, Wind Elder and others looked closely.</p><p>The sea was empty, with no islands or reefs to be seen.</p><p>The wind was strong and the waves were high here.</p><p>Madam Yue calculated silently in her heart, her brows slightly furrowed, "If we go further, we'll reach the storm zone..."</p><p>Before she finished speaking, she was suddenly interrupted by Island Lord Shen's exclamation.</p><p>"Not good!"</p><p>Island Lord Shen spread out his palm, only to see that the blood worm had become very withered, melting into a group of foul-smelling black water at a speed visible to the naked eye, completely decaying!</p><p>Like flowers withering.</p><p>At the same time, Island Lord Shen lost his sense of the mark.</p><p>His expression changed drastically, and he suddenly realized something. He raised his head, only to see a rainbow rat the size of a fist crawling out of the hawk demon's feathers, its gaze towards him filled with deep hatred!</p>
