<h1>Chapter 1798: Dharma Manifestation and Dharma Body</h1><p>“Thank you, Senior, for saving my life. This junior is eternally grateful.”</p><p>The female Daoist, Nü Guan, slowly regained consciousness. Still weak, she struggled to sit up, supported by Yun Wei, and offered a difficult bow.</p><p>However, the strange force had been expelled. Nü Guan’s own cultivation wasn't weak, and her breathing quickly stabilized. After consuming a few medicinal pills, she gradually recovered.</p><p>Qin Sang wanted to learn more about the Cricket Mountain Sect, so he didn’t immediately enter meditative seclusion. He asked a few questions.</p><p>Both of them appeared timid and hesitant.  They could only stammer and prevaricate when faced with questions they found difficult to answer.</p><p>Seeing their predicament, Qin Sang didn’t press them.</p><p>He learned that the Cricket Mountain Sect’s main gate was located in Zhongmao Prefecture, under the jurisdiction of the Tianshu Academy.</p><p>Unlike other Daoist sects, the Cricket Mountain Sect venerated the rare Plague Deities.  From the very beginning of their cultivation journey, the sect's disciples were exposed to plague and venom talismans and spells. Throughout the entire Daoist world, the Cricket Mountain Sect was unrivaled in this particular Dao.</p><p>The current sect master of the Cricket Mountain Sect was known as the Tranquil Primordial Monarch, Qingdan Yuanjun.  This title originated from her most famous battle.  It was said that she employed some unknown technique or talisman, instantly causing a watery mist to pervade the battlefield, making the void ripple like tranquil water.</p><p>When the mist dissipated, the enemy was dead, yet their complexion was rosy, their body unharmed, as if they were still alive.</p><p>Disciples of Daoist sects could also receive Dharma Decrees from the Dao Court.</p><p>Yun Wei’s competition with Qin Sang for the Dharma Decree was actually related to Qingdan Yuanjun.</p><p>He knew that his master intended to befriend the Grandmaster Alchemist, Lingxu Dashi, but he had no prior connection with him. A sudden visit would have been presumptuous.</p><p>He happened to see this Dharma Decree and wanted to obtain Lingxu Dashi’s token and present it to his master. Then, approaching Lingxu Dashi would be a natural and smooth process. Unfortunately, he wasn’t Qin Sang’s match.</p><p>As Qin Sang conversed with the two, he observed the venomous pearl within his body.</p><p>After devouring the strange force, the venomous pearl remained unchanged.</p><p>That strange force had merged with the Bloodlust Miasma Poison within the pearl, but its unique fluctuations hadn’t disappeared.</p><p>It wasn't assimilated by the Bloodlust Miasma Poison, and the quantity of the strange force was extremely small, indicating that its rank was at least comparable to the Bloodlust Miasma Poison.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered for a moment and asked, “Where were you attacked by the strange force?”</p><p>Yun Wei and Nü Guan exchanged glances, hesitant. After a moment, they replied, “We dare not deceive Senior, but we truly don’t know the exact location.  We were led by our master into the depths of the Ritual Arena. Though we formed a protective formation, we could only barely preserve our lives with all our might. We dared not be distracted as our master led us forward. The strange force appeared suddenly. Master said it was triggered when the golden light erupted, affecting some strange location. It was fleeting, and its origin is unknown…”</p><p>Driven by some ulterior motive, Yun Wei elaborated further.</p><p>His expression darkened as he spoke.  It wasn’t just him and his junior sister who were brought here, but also other fellow disciples.</p><p>Qingdan Yuanjun had brought her direct disciples into the dangerous area, intending for them to maintain a specific formation.</p><p>Unfortunately, the unexpected change came too suddenly.  Everyone was caught off guard, and the others couldn’t withstand the strange force, perishing on the spot. Only he and his junior sister survived.</p><p>The Cricket Mountain Sect had suffered heavy losses this time!</p><p>Precisely because of this, upon learning that demonic forces were behind the incident, Qingdan Yuanjun flew into a rage and immediately agreed to True Person Wan’s invitation, wanting to personally avenge her disciples.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded slightly, lost in thought.</p><p>The Ritual Arena of Jushan Prefecture could be considered one of the most mystical places in the world.  Countless ancient mighty figures had displayed their divine abilities there, leaving behind wondrous illusions that persisted to this day. It was truly a sight Qin Sang had never seen before.</p><p>Scenes that defied common sense were everywhere, constantly challenging established perceptions. It wasn’t strange for potent poisons to manifest here.</p><p>Qin Sang attempted to glean some understanding from the fluctuations of the strange force, but he had no clue.</p><p>Thanks to the venomous pearl bestowed by the Fat Silkworm, Qin Sang gained the ability to detoxify and control poisons, but he wasn’t an expert in the Dao of Poisons, nor did he intend to dedicate himself to its study.</p><p>Asking him to analyze the strange force was asking too much.</p><p>Even Qingdan Yuanjun, an expert in the Dao of Poisons, couldn't protect her disciples when the strange force struck, demonstrating its insidious nature.</p><p>He was indeed interested in this strange force. If the venomous pearl could devour more of it, the potency of his own poison techniques, as well as the Heaven Extinction Soul-Shattering Needles, would be enhanced.</p><p>As he pondered, time slowly passed.</p><p>Qin Sang kept a sliver of his attention focused on the outside. After waiting for a full hour, he finally saw a phenomenon!</p><p>Beyond the gray curtain, in the depths of the Ritual Arena, a blinding multicolored light suddenly erupted. Qin Sang abruptly stood up, thinking it would cause the entire Ritual Arena to tremble like the golden light before.</p><p>Yun Wei and Nü Guan, unaware of the situation outside, looked at Qin Sang anxiously.</p><p>After a few breaths, the multicolored light dissipated, and nothing unusual happened.  Qin Sang’s expression remained grave.</p><p>The multicolored light was likely caused by the battle between the two sides.  Creating such a commotion in the depths of the Ritual Arena, the fight must have been incredibly fierce.</p><p>He needed to make some preparations.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at Yun Wei and Nü Guan and held the Imperial Bell Talisman in his hand.</p><p>He had already checked; there was no Wood Spiritual Qi nearby. Without the Stabilizing Truth Pill and the Wood Spirit Body divine ability, his strength was greatly diminished.</p><p>Fortunately, he had saved the Imperial Bell Talisman from the previous battle and could escape unscathed even if he encountered another unexpected event.</p><p>The anticipated situation didn’t occur.</p><p>After a stick of incense burned, Qin Sang saw familiar escaping lights flying from afar, some bright, some dim. It was True Person Zhang and the others.</p><p>There were five people in total.</p><p>True Person Zhang, True Person Youhuang, and True Person Guyun were present, but True Person Zhijian was missing.</p><p>The other two were unfamiliar, a man and a woman.</p><p>The man was dressed in white, with a feather fan and a silk scarf. Unfortunately, his aura was somewhat disordered, diminishing his refined air.</p><p>The woman was slender and beautiful, but her face was cold, and her brows were furrowed with unconcealed killing intent.</p><p>Confirming that there were no pursuers behind them, Qin Sang quickly activated the talisman formation, welcoming the True People inside.</p><p>“This woman must be Qingdan Yuanjun…”</p><p>Qin Sang’s gaze swept over the woman and then turned to True Person Zhang, frowning.  “Where is True Person Zhijian?”</p><p>He noticed that True Person Youhuang, True Person Guyun, and the unfamiliar man all had rapid breathing, indicating significant exhaustion.</p><p>True Person Guyun’s face was pale, clearly injured.  Upon entering the stone pavilion, he didn’t have time to greet anyone and immediately sat down to meditate and recover.</p><p>Only True Person Zhang, although also in poor condition, had a hint of joy in his expression, as if he had gained something.</p><p>True Person Zhang said with a relaxed expression, “Rest assured, Fellow Daoist.  True Person Zhijian is fine. He is bringing up the rear…”</p><p>At this moment, Qingdan Yuanjun checked her disciples’ injuries. Learning from Yun Wei that it was Qin Sang who helped them, her expression softened, and the killing intent on her pretty face disappeared. She walked up to Qin Sang and bowed. “This humble Daoist is Qingdan. Many thanks to True Person Qingfeng for your assistance in healing my disciples’ injuries.”</p><p>“It was a small effort. Yuanjun is too kind.”</p><p>Qin Sang cupped his hands and replied indifferently.</p><p>Seeing this, Qingdan Yuanjun dispensed with formalities and introduced the man to Qin Sang. This person’s Daoist title was Boxian Shanzhen, and he was a close friend of Qingdan Yuanjun.</p><p>The two exchanged greetings.</p><p>As they were talking, a sword light suddenly arrived, transforming into a rainbow. Qin Sang quickly activated the talisman formation and welcomed True Person Zhijian into the stone pavilion.</p><p>With this, except for the two Dao Court Celestial Officials and Mo Xingdao, everyone had assembled.</p><p>“How did it go?”</p><p>True Person Zhang asked with concern.</p><p>True Person Zhijian nodded. “No need to wait any longer. We’ll retreat to the Golden Hall now and rendezvous with the people from the Dao Court there.”</p><p>Hearing this, everyone’s expressions relaxed.</p><p>Qin Sang knew his place and didn’t inquire about the details or outcome of the battle, observing dispassionately.</p><p>After a brief rest, the group flew out of the gray curtain together. True Person Zhijian and True Person Zhang took the lead and rear, respectively, with the injured protected in the middle, flying towards the outer edge of the Ritual Arena.</p><p>The further out they went, the more relaxed their expressions became.</p><p>Yun Wei and his junior sister followed closely behind Qingdan Yuanjun.  Seeing the situation ease, Yun Wei employed a secret technique, communicating with his master discreetly.</p><p>Qingdan Yuanjun glanced at Qin Sang, a flicker of surprise in her eyes.</p><p>She initially thought that Qin Sang had forcibly expelled the stubborn strange force from her disciples’ bodies with his powerful cultivation. Now, she realized that he had used a secret technique of the Dao of Poisons, neutralizing the strange force invisibly.</p><p>Looking at Qin Sang, she pondered.  When they neared the Nine-Bend Star River and confirmed there was no danger, she transmitted her voice to Qin Sang, “Forgive my presumptuousness, but when True Person was healing my disciples, did you discern anything peculiar about that strange force?”</p><p>Qin Sang had anticipated this question. He pondered and said, “The quantity of the strange force was too small. This humble Daoist only knows that my detoxification method had some effect.  It should be a potent poison, but it also has some strange properties. I couldn’t fully understand it, nor could I guess its origin.”</p><p>Hesitating for a moment, Qingdan Yuanjun continued, “Could True Person perhaps impart your detoxification method to this humble Daoist? I’m willing to exchange other treasures and will do my best to satisfy True Person’s requests.”</p><p>If it were before, Qin Sang could have requested Qingdan Yuanjun to teach him the Cricket Mountain Sect’s inherited techniques.</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head slightly, refusing, “This method is crucial to this humble Daoist and requires my personal intervention. It cannot be passed on.  Please don’t take offense, Yuanjun.”</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang’s firm and resolute attitude, Qingdan Yuanjun’s face showed disappointment, and she fell into deep thought.</p><p>Soon, the Nine-Bend Star River appeared in their field of vision.</p><p>Confirming that there were no abnormalities, everyone immediately crossed the river and safely returned to the Golden Hall.</p><p>The Golden Hall appeared as before, extremely peaceful.</p><p>True Person Zhang shot a talisman towards the sky, and then everyone slowly flew towards the exit of the Golden Hall, occasionally looking back.</p><p>Even as they neared the exit, the Dao Court Celestial Officials were still nowhere to be seen. Recalling Hongyuzi's warning, they didn't dare leave on their own and could only find a place near the exit to wait.</p><p>Another half-day passed.</p><p>A figure appeared not far from where the group was hiding.</p><p>Recognizing the newcomer, True Person Zhang sighed in relief.  “This humble Daoist thought something had happened to Venerable.”</p><p>The newcomer was Venerable Zhenru. After returning to the Golden Hall, he had found a secluded place to heal his injuries.  Upon receiving True Person Zhang’s message, he had rushed to meet them.</p><p>Venerable Zhenru appeared, and before they could exchange a few words, the Nine-Bend Star River suddenly stirred.</p><p>Everyone focused their gaze and saw a point of crimson light breaking through the Star River. It was incredibly fast, without a moment's pause, speeding towards the exit of the Golden Hall.</p><p>The crimson light was actually a mass of raging fire.  A luxurious palanquin, enveloped in roaring flames, was pulled by a fiery beast resembling a fiery rhinoceros, its imposing aura astonishing.</p><p>Wherever it passed, it seemed to incinerate even the void itself.</p><p>The flames were like gauze, separating the inside and outside.  Everyone saw True Person Wan riding at the front of the palanquin, personally controlling it.</p><p>Vague figures could be seen within the palanquin, presumably the Dao Court Celestial Officials, but there were no demons.</p><p>The fiery light made no attempt at concealment, heading straight for the entrance of the Golden Hall.</p><p>As the palanquin approached, Qin Sang and the others also revealed themselves.  However, the palanquin didn’t stop. True Person Wan’s shout echoed, “Follow close behind!”</p><p>Everyone followed the palanquin, rushing into the auspicious clouds, and quickly reached the edge of the clouds.  Beyond that lay the exit of the Jushan Prefecture Ritual Arena.</p><p>Their escape speed was extremely fast.  They burst out of the auspicious clouds, flew across the central plain, and in the blink of an eye, arrived above the mountain range where they had previously hidden.</p><p>At this moment, everyone felt an inexplicable sense of foreboding.</p><p>Including the Celestial Officials inside the palanquin, everyone looked towards the east in unison, their faces filled with horror.</p><p>It was noon, and the sky was bright.</p><p>Yet, a dense darkness was rapidly spreading across the eastern sky.</p><p>‘Rumble!’</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>…</p><p>As the darkness spread, thunder rumbled, lightning flashed, and fierce winds howled between heaven and earth. The ground trembled, and multicolored light radiated in all directions.</p><p>Countless phenomena appeared one after another.  Colored light points were born and exploded like blooming spiritual flowers.</p><p>The Heavenly and Earthly Yuan Qi was being impacted by a terrifying force, and chaotic power surged wildly.</p><p>Everyone finally saw it.</p><p>Within the depths of the darkness, a gigantic silhouette faintly took shape.</p><p>It was a Roc, entirely black, its dark feathers seemingly capable of devouring light itself.</p><p>As it flew towards them, its outstretched wings brought darkness, surging forward, blotting out the sky and the sun.</p><p>Everyone’s hearts trembled; they were aghast.</p><p>Qin Sang also revealed a startled expression.</p><p>“Dharma Manifestation!”</p><p>He felt a familiar aura from the black demonic Roc; it was the aura of a Dharma Manifestation!</p><p>This wasn’t the true body of a demonic beast but a Dharma Manifestation, although this manifestation was incredibly solid, almost tangible.</p><p>Both the black Roc’s aura and the celestial phenomena it triggered were sufficient proof that this demon was a Void Refinement Stage Great Demon!</p><p>“So, the Dharma Manifestation is a divine ability of Void Refinement Stage Great Demons…”</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly understood. No wonder the Demon Marquises he had encountered before didn’t have Dharma Manifestations. No wonder the Azure鸾 Dharma Manifestation could resist the aura suppression of Marquis Li.</p><p>Hongyuzi was right. There really was a Demon King blocking the way!</p><p>The darkness spread too quickly, instantly occupying half the sky. The black Roc was like a canopy spread across the heavens, looking down upon ants.</p><p>Within the darkness, two sharp gazes pierced through everyone’s hearts like swords.</p><p>“Retreat!”</p><p>True Person Zhang was alarmed and wanted to return to the Ritual Arena, but a Demon Marquis rushed out of the auspicious clouds, sneering at them.</p><p>Suddenly, a cold snort exploded in everyone’s minds, followed by a terrifying aura descending upon them.  They saw a tide of spiritual energy surging forward, even faster than the black Roc, with the momentum to destroy everything.</p><p>The palanquin, however, remained suspended motionless.</p><p>At this moment, a fierce wind suddenly arose around them, and dark clouds instantly filled the sky.  Thunder roared.</p><p>The Yuan Qi in this space seemed to be drawn by some force, converging madly towards the sky, condensing into a human figure.</p><p>This person wore Daoist robes and a Daoist crown, with white beard and eyebrows.  Standing amidst the wind and thunder, he calmly looked at the black Roc.</p><p>“It’s the legendary Dharma Body!  A Great True Person!”</p><p>True Person Guyun exclaimed, looking at the old Daoist with a face full of shock and yearning.</p><p>Qin Sang was also awestruck.  This was a Dharma Body purely condensed from Heavenly and Earthly True Yuan.  The Great True Person’s true body was likely still far away.</p><p>“Old monster, bullying the weak. Have you no shame?” The Great True Person laughed aloud.</p><p>The black Roc’s eyes shot out two beams of golden light, like arrows. Everyone saw two golden rainbows.</p><p>The Great True Person smiled faintly and pointed a finger towards the void.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>Myriad stars faintly appeared in the sky, and a celestial river descended from the heavens, connecting to the Milky Way, blocking the spiritual tide, brushing away the golden light, and obliterating a mountain.</p><p>The black Roc snorted coldly, flapping its wings, sweeping away the Demon Marquis as the darkness slowly retreated towards the horizon.</p><p>“You go first.”</p><p>The Great True Person left these words behind, his figure dissipating, and the Yuan Qi returning to heaven and earth. The celestial phenomena vanished along with him.</p><p>Everyone remained stunned for a long time, unable to recover from the shock.</p><p>Mountains rose and fell in this area, limiting their vision, but they could still see for hundreds of miles. Yet, they couldn’t see any sign of the phenomena.</p><p>This meant that the Great True Person and the black Roc’s true bodies were at least hundreds of miles away, exchanging blows from afar with their Dharma Manifestation and Dharma Body.</p><p>Qin Sang finally understood that his previous thoughts were too simple.  When Void Refinement cultivators moved, celestial phenomena would manifest, and wind and thunder would accompany them. But not seeing the phenomena didn't mean they were safe.</p>
