<h1>Chapter 434: Mu Yifeng</h1><p>A sharp shriek, faint yet piercing, echoed from the distance.</p><p>Qin Sang, recalling the information he'd received from Xiong Li, felt a jolt of apprehension. He silently slipped beneath the water's surface, completely concealing his presence as he watched.</p><p>Soon, a streak of red light sped from the southwest, entering Qin Sang's field of vision.</p><p>Someone was flying on a sword!</p><p>Qin Sang held his breath, remaining motionless. His gaze, piercing the water's surface, followed the streak of light, then swept beyond it.</p><p>As expected, moments later, a white streak of light appeared, hot on the heels of the red one.</p><p>Due to the distance, Qin Sang could only discern two blurry streaks, one red, one white, chasing across the sky. He couldn't sense their auras.</p><p>However, from the momentum of their flight, he could make a rough estimate: both were at least late-stage Foundation Establishment cultivators!</p><p>The leading red streak appeared somewhat unstable. The white streak pursued at a measured pace, giving Qin Sang an impression of unwavering stability, as if its target was already within its grasp.</p><p>Could it be Heavenly Alliance cultivators pursuing someone from the Xiao Han Domain?</p><p>The techniques of cultivators from both sides were largely similar, making it impossible to determine their identities by sight alone.</p><p>Qin Sang floated underwater, clutching the Ten Yama Banners, his eyes flickering with uncertainty as he watched the two streaks chase each other towards the northeast.</p><p>Just then, a rumbling sound emanated from the direction the streaks had come from.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression shifted. Turning his head, he saw a treasure ship rapidly approaching, trailing the two streaks of light.</p><p>The treasure ship sailed across the water, enveloped in a radiant glow, its pursuit blatant and unmistakable.</p><p>The lake water was split by the ship's hull, sending waves surging skyward, forming two walls of water several dozen feet high.</p><p>The waves crashed and churned, spraying droplets into the air.</p><p>Under the blazing sun, faint rainbows trailed in the ship's wake, creating a breathtakingly beautiful scene.</p><p>Even underwater, Qin Sang could feel the subtle tremors.</p><p>Focusing his gaze, he peered through the churning water, catching a glimpse of the treasure ship. It was simple in design: pointed at both ends, with a canopy in the middle, resembling a common awning boat.</p><p>But there were no oars, nor anyone steering.</p><p>A figure stood at the bow, presumably the ship's owner.</p><p>At the stern, several other figures were visible, some seated, some standing.</p><p>Most looked upwards, their attention fixed on the two streaks of light ahead. They appeared to be gripping magical instruments, ready for combat.</p><p>Due to the distance, Qin Sang couldn't discern their features, let alone sense their cultivation levels.  However, they were clearly pursuing the two streaks of light, implying considerable strength, especially given their numbers.</p><p>"Of these three factions, which are enemies? Which are allies?"</p><p>Qin Sang's face creased in thought.</p><p>If it were just the two streaks of light, once he'd determined friend from foe, intervening wouldn't be a problem, and would be a significant contribution upon his return.</p><p>Qin Sang was confident in his abilities. Given the right opportunity and the element of surprise, even without using the Ten Yama Banners, slaying a late-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator wasn't out of the question.</p><p>But if the awning boat held Heavenly Alliance experts, he'd need to reconsider.</p><p>As Qin Sang hesitated,</p><p>'Roar!'</p><p>A sudden roar broke his train of thought.</p><p>He looked up, following the sound. The leading red streak had stopped.</p><p>However, Qin Sang couldn't see the figure within. The light suddenly expanded, transforming into a raging inferno, a massive fireball blazing in the sky.</p><p>Flames licked outwards as roars emanated from the fireball's core.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression shifted. The roar sounded vaguely familiar.</p><p>The fireball pulsed violently, and several fire dragons erupted from the flames, coiling around the central blaze. The dragons, bodies ablaze, soared across the sky.</p><p>Their majestic forms resembled true dragons.</p><p>Counting carefully, there were nine fire dragons: Nine Dragons playing with a pearl!</p><p>Surprise flickered across Qin Sang's face.</p><p>The next moment, a powerful suction force emanated from the fireball, drawing all the flames inwards. The fire dragons shrank rapidly, revealing a divine spear!</p><p>A figure stood proudly in the air, spear in hand, nine miniature fire dragons circling the weapon, roaring at the approaching enemy.</p><p>Seeing the spear, Qin Sang's eyes narrowed, and a figure sprang to mind.</p><p>Mu Yifeng!</p><p>The Nine Fire Divine Spear was Mu Yifeng's signature weapon.</p><p>He and Mu Yifeng had met at Hanging Skull Pass, facing hardships together. Though their time together was short, they were kindred spirits and had formed a bond.</p><p>After returning from the ancient cultivator's ruins, they parted ways outside Hanging Skull Pass. Decades had passed since then. He hadn't expected Mu Yifeng to also leave Hanging Skull Pass and arrive at the Azure Vastness Swamp.</p><p>And his cultivation had also broken through to late-stage Foundation Establishment.</p><p>The Nine Fire Divine Spear's power was far greater than decades ago, indicating Mu Yifeng had invested significant time and effort refining it.</p><p>Since it was Mu Yifeng, those behind him must be Heavenly Alliance cultivators!</p><p>Mu Yifeng stood defiantly in mid-air, eyes blazing with fury, his hands gripping the Nine Fire Divine Spear.</p><p>He seemed to know escape was impossible, resigned to a desperate fight, pouring his spiritual energy into the weapon.</p><p>An astonishing fiery power radiated from the Nine Fire Divine Spear, its material transforming into something akin to fire jade, emitting a blinding crimson light.</p><p>The surrounding water was dyed red by the spear's light, as if ignited.</p><p>"Kill!"</p><p>Mu Yifeng's hoarse voice roared.</p><p>He hurled the Nine Fire Divine Spear.</p><p>It shot forward like a bolt of lightning, a fleeting meteor.</p><p>Seeing Mu Yifeng's desperate attack, the pursuing cultivator, now targeted by the spear, didn't dare be careless. He halted his flight, throwing a purple crystal vial into the air, chanting an incantation.</p><p>The vial flipped, its mouth facing the Nine Fire Divine Spear. A wave of purple light erupted from the vial, intercepting the spear.</p><p>'Puff!'</p><p>The two weapons collided silently.</p><p>The purple light, like a soft cloud, dented upon impact with the spear, the light devoured by the spear, diminishing at a visible rate.  More light poured from the vial, but it couldn't keep pace with the consumption.</p><p>The Nine Fire Divine Spear's momentum was only slightly checked, its irresistible force unwavering.</p><p>Gritting his teeth, the Heavenly Alliance cultivator tapped the vial. It trembled, its body directly blocking the Nine Fire Divine Spear.</p><p>Both were powerful cultivators, their battle lightning fast.</p><p>In a flash,</p><p>By the time Qin Sang realized the pursued cultivator was Mu Yifeng, the two weapons had already clashed.</p><p>Even Qin Sang could see that Mu Yifeng's situation was dire. Even if the Nine Fire Divine Spear miraculously killed his pursuer, he would be powerless against the approaching treasure ship.</p>
