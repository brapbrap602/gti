<h1>Chapter 2018: A Thousand Years Late</h1><p>A sharp corner jutted out from the front of the Ziwei Palace fragment. Qin Sang and Qu Zhen stood directly facing it.</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze was fixed on the right side of the corner, on a crumbling mountain at the edge of the Ziwei Palace fragment.  Atop the ruined mountain were the collapsed remains of a palace. A figure flashed out from within the palace and was about to venture deeper inside.</p><p>Qin Sang only caught a glimpse, but the familiar feeling intensified.</p><p>“Find a place to hide,” Qin Sang instructed, and without waiting for Qu Zhen’s reply, immediately transformed into a streak of lightning, rushing toward the crumbling mountain.</p><p>Qu Zhen opened his mouth, somewhat disappointed that Qin Sang wouldn't bring him along.  However, remembering the dangers within this Sword Pavilion, he felt secretly relieved that Qin Sang hadn't treated him as a mere scout. He looked around and concealed himself in the dark void.</p><p>From the outside, it appeared to be only a thin mist, but upon entering, one realized that the mist possessed an unknown power, greatly hindering both vision and divine sense. However, it wasn't a critical moment, so Qin Sang didn't awaken the Skyeye Butterfly.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>Just as he neared the crumbling mountain, a fierce gust of wind suddenly struck him head-on.</p><p>Sword light erupted before Qin Sang. With a single slash of the Grey Warbler Sword, accompanied by the clang of metal striking metal, a grey short-knife was met squarely on its blade. With a *crack*, the short-knife snapped in two. The two halves were flung away, transforming into two wisps of white vapor mid-air, vanishing into nothingness.</p><p>This demonstrated the perilous nature of the Ziwei Palace fragment. Yet Qin Sang's speed didn't decrease, but instead increased. With a few flashes, he ascended the crumbling mountain.</p><p>Glancing at the palace, Qin Sang flew to the broken edge.  He swept his gaze around, finding the mist ahead heavy and the graceful figure already gone without a trace. However, ancient restrictions were layered throughout the Ziwei Palace fragment. To traverse this place silently, leaving no trace, was nearly impossible.</p><p>Qin Sang immediately locked onto a faint fluctuation of Qi and pursued it without hesitation.</p><p>He recalled that behind this mountain should be a vast expanse of towering ancient trees of an unknown species. The ancient trees provided ample shade, their leaves a clear, verdant green, clustered like crystals, emitting a pure emerald light. The emerald light coalesced, forming a tangible membrane of light above the ancient trees. Experienced cultivators would recognize at a glance that this was the manifestation of an ancient restriction.</p><p>Now, not a single ancient tree remained. Scorched marks filled the area, and occasionally, a withered tree stump could be seen, as if ravaged by fire. The light membrane was naturally gone as well.</p><p>With sword light clearing the path, Qin Sang swiftly traversed this dead forest. But he soon discovered that the Qi fluctuation was becoming intermittent and constantly changing direction. The other party had clearly sensed the pursuer and was trying to shake him off.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist, wait…" Qin Sang channeled his True Essence and transmitted his voice, but there was no response from ahead.</p><p>The ancient restrictions interfered, preventing his voice transmission from traveling far. Helpless, Qin Sang could only continue his pursuit, finally resorting to invoking the Azure Phoenix True Lightning.</p><p>Using the Azure Phoenix True Lightning to execute the Lightning Evasion technique, his speed was unmatched among his peers.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>A bolt of lightning pierced through the mist at incredible speed. Qin Sang finally sensed a stronger Qi fluctuation and vaguely glimpsed a flash of green light, disappearing into a valley.</p><p>As he neared the valley, the green light suddenly accelerated, rushing towards the right side of the valley at an astonishing speed.</p><p>Qin Sang followed closely into the valley, losing sight of his target once more. The right slope was riddled with fissures, and the other party had vanished into one of them. However, Qin Sang's speed was too great.  Despite the other party's attempts to conceal their movements, the residual fluctuations within the fissure hadn't yet dissipated.</p><p>He pursued the fluctuations into the fissure and found that the interior of the mountain was severely fractured, full of cracks.  Even more troublesome was that this wasn't an ordinary mountain. Every stone was infused with restrictions. Even cracked, the mountain remained incredibly hard. Shattering it was impossible.</p><p>Qin Sang could only follow the Qi, relentlessly pursuing through the intricate network of fissures.  The other party was clearly not a newcomer and was very familiar with this place.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>*Rumble…*</p><p>Their pursuit underground shook the mountain, and the tremors spread outward, attracting the attention of nearby cultivators.</p><p>Cultivators in the distance, who were attempting to decipher ancient restrictions, stopped and looked over. Based on the commotion, they could roughly guess what was happening, but they weren't eager to interfere, choosing to observe first.</p><p>The underground chase was fierce. The person ahead repeatedly used ancient restrictions to create obstacles, but Qin Sang overcame them all.  Fortunately, Qin Sang had the advantage of speed, and the distance between them gradually closed.</p><p>Finally, Qin Sang sensed that the end of the fissure was not far ahead.  The other party had already left from there. With a flash of lightning, he burst out of the fissure.</p><p>The instant he emerged, an angry shout echoed from above, followed by an icy aura that suddenly erupted, descending from the heavens.</p><p>Within the aura was a black, pointed cone, undoubtedly a spirit treasure. The cone's tip was incredibly sharp. Centered around the cone, the void rippled like water. It seemed as if the cone had pierced even the void itself.</p><p>From the appearance of the cone to the eruption of the aura, it all happened in an instant. Heavenly and earthly Qi surged, transforming into a sinister black current, cascading down like a waterfall, amplifying the cone's power as it hurtled towards Qin Sang.</p><p>The cone was aimed directly at Qin Sang's Baihui acupoint. If it struck true, it would undoubtedly pierce right through him.</p><p>But Qin Sang seemed to have anticipated this. He didn't dodge or flinch. The Grey Warbler Sword let out a clear, resonant hum, and a sword light abruptly sprang forth.</p><p>The sword light was dazzling, appearing beneath the cone as if it had pierced through the void itself, slashing upwards against the descending cone.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>It was as if a black and a white sun had collided, instantly merging into a larger, more violent sun, its residual energy sweeping outwards with tremendous force.</p><p>Within the 'sun', the Grey Warbler Sword struck. The sword light angled slightly, deliberately avoiding the tip and striking the cone's body.  With a *dong*, the cone's trajectory was visibly altered, and the Heavenly and earthly Qi it had gathered began to dissipate.</p><p>However, the other party's attack wasn't limited to the cone.  A green light shot into the air, revealing a dark green jade bracelet. The bracelet rapidly expanded, forming a black vortex at its center, heavy and violent, capable of tearing apart anything, its power even more terrifying than the cone.</p><p>Just as the jade bracelet was about to descend upon the ground, Qin Sang's voice, laced with surprise, rose from below.</p><p>“Fellow Daoist Su Nu, is it really you?!”</p><p>Just as they had expected, the emergence of the Sword Pavilion would indeed attract ascended cultivators from the lower realm. After the familiar Jade Heart Knife, Qin Sang finally encountered a familiar face!</p><p>From the Canglang Sea, Su Nu!</p><p>This woman had left a deep impression on Qin Sang. Back then, due to her special physique, Su Nu had been chosen and nurtured by the three great merchant alliances to become a vessel for an ancient devil. She had no control over her own fate, a predicament far more desperate than his own at the time.</p><p>Yet this woman never gave up. With sheer determination, she even went so far as to become someone's Soul Slave to carve out a sliver of hope for herself.  Furthermore, she played a crucial role in sealing the ancient devil.</p><p>After the sealing battle, Qin Sang returned to the Small Cold Realm, entrusting the unconscious and severely injured Su Nu to the Four Saints Palace for care. He also took the initiative to destroy the Ghost Seal controlling her as a Soul Slave.</p><p>After reaching the Nascent Soul stage and returning to the Canglang Sea, he learned from the Bao siblings that Su Nu had been unable to escape in time during the Seven Killing Palace's ascension and her whereabouts were unknown.</p><p>Beneath the black and white sun, Qin Sang tilted his head slightly, his gaze burning as he stared at the graceful figure above the sun, a strange expression on his face.</p><p>Her features gradually aligned with those in his memory. Less youthful now, she possessed a more mature and seasoned air, but the resoluteness in her eyes remained undiminished.</p><p>Seeing Su Nu again greatly astonished Qin Sang. She was already a Soul Formation cultivator!</p><p>Su Nu was younger than him, and he had only reached his current cultivation level after receiving the Thunder Ancestor's empowerment in the Talisman World. How had Su Nu achieved this?</p><p>What astonishing talent!</p><p>Back then, Qin Sang had predicted that given her temperament, as long as she had the opportunity, Su Nu would surely achieve extraordinary things.  The facts proved that during her time at the Four Saints Palace, Su Nu's cultivation had progressed by leaps and bounds, and she had made great contributions to humanity.</p><p>It was truly unexpected that she had already broken through to the Soul Formation stage.</p><p>The moment Qin Sang spoke, revealing her identity, Su Nu's delicate body stiffened slightly.  The momentum of the cone and bracelet faltered, transforming into two streaks of black light as they flew back. The residual energy dissipated.</p><p>Su Nu stared down with a look of astonishment.</p><p>She clearly remembered Qin Sang. Upon recognizing his features, an expression of disbelief crossed her face, and she couldn't help but gasp.</p><p>“Qin… Fellow Daoist, is it you?!”</p><p>"It's been many years. You still remember me," Qin Sang said with satisfaction.</p><p>After recognizing Qin Sang, Su Nu's eyes flashed with intense joy. Her lips parted, about to speak, when she sensed fluctuations coming from afar. Someone was approaching.</p><p>Qin Sang also noticed.  Clearly, others had observed their chase and were hoping to reap the benefits.</p><p>“Fellow Daoist Qin, this isn't a suitable place to talk. Please follow me,” Su Nu, seemingly well-versed in this place, swiftly led Qin Sang away, quickly leaving the Ziwei Palace fragment and flying towards an illusory landscape created by divine abilities.</p><p>After flying for a while, confirming there were no pursuers, Su Nu stopped on a parched piece of land and turned to Qin Sang.</p><p>By now, her emotions had calmed. Her gaze swept over Qin Sang's face. She opened her mouth slightly, momentarily unsure where to begin.  “I inadvertently provoked two adversaries earlier. To avoid them, I had to seclude myself for a period before emerging. I didn't realize it was you just now. I thought my pursuers hadn't left yet.”</p><p>Qin Sang inwardly understood. That explained why Su Nu's Qi seemed somewhat sluggish during her attack. "I just arrived here. I only caught a glimpse and wasn't certain if it was you."</p><p>Su Nu nodded, then fell silent for a moment.  Her voice was soft, tinged with melancholy. "I was unconscious back then and couldn't bid you farewell. It has been a lifelong regret. All these years… has Fellow Daoist Qin been well?"</p><p>"There have been unavoidable trials, but I've stumbled my way to where I am today," Qin Sang said with a carefree smile. "It's you who has truly surprised me.  I returned to the Canglang Sea before and learned from the Four Saints Palace that you were unable to escape in time during the Seven Killing Palace's ascension and were swept into the Void Turbulence. Everyone was worried about your safety.  Reuniting today, I've learned that you are not only safe but have achieved far beyond their imagination. If the Bao siblings knew, they would be overjoyed…"</p><p>He was most curious about how Su Nu had survived the 'ascension'.</p><p>According to the Jade Bone Devil Lord, even for them, using the Ascension Platform within the Ziwei Palace to pierce the void and withstand the Void Turbulence, only those at late Nascent Soul stage and above had a sliver of hope.</p><p>Mount Yitian had no Ascension Platform, and Su Nu wasn't a Nascent Soul cultivator. She had practically faced the Void Turbulence head-on.  Logically, she had almost no chance of survival.</p><p>Since the Seven Killing Palace had brought Su Nu to the Great Thousand Worlds, was it possible that his Senior Sister and Bai weren’t sent to the Devil Realm but also ended up here?</p><p>“Fellow Daoist Qin is indeed from another realm. No wonder I couldn't find you even after searching the entire Canglang Sea. Do you remember the Ancient Devil Lord beneath Mount Yitian?”</p><p>Su Nu's expression turned reminiscent as she recounted the events of that time.</p><p>“The Ancient Devil Lord didn't die, and he has been trying to break the seal. During the ascension, the Seven Killing Palace trembled incessantly, triggering numerous Immortal Restrictions, while countless ancient restrictions and formations were destroyed.</p><p>"The seal on Mount Yitian was inevitably affected. Sensing the changes outside, the Devil Lord frantically assaulted the seal. I couldn't escape in time.  Left with no other choice, I took a desperate gamble and rushed towards Mount Yitian, hoping to use the Devil Lord's power to gain a sliver of hope.</p><p>"Under attack from both within and without, cracks soon appeared in the seal. Eager to escape, the Devil Lord unleashed his power without reservation, and it seeped through the cracks, indeed helping me withstand a great deal of pressure.</p><p>"But it didn't last. The Seven Killing Palace was torn apart by the Void Turbulence, countless ancient restrictions were annihilated, and I struggled to hold on, eventually falling unconscious. I thought I was dead, but when I awoke, I found myself, miraculously, in the Great Thousand Worlds.”</p><p>Hearing Su Nu's account, Qin Sang could only lament the unpredictability of fate.  Su Nu's tragic experiences were all caused by the Ancient Devil Lord, yet who could have imagined that he would ultimately become her protector?</p><p>Qin Sang inquired about other details, and Su Nu pondered deeply.  "During the ascension, I did see a celestial palace in the distance, and a stone workshop with the words 'Ziwei Palace' written on it. But I was already at my limit then, and I lost consciousness soon after."</p><p>Learning that Su Nu hadn't seen his Senior Sister or Bai, Qin Sang felt a pang of disappointment and sighed inwardly. He then asked, "Did the Devil Lord break the seal?"</p><p>“I don't know."</p><p>Su Nu shook her head.  "I didn't wake up nearby but was flung to another place.  I was fortunate enough to become a disciple and followed my master for many years.  Later, my master passed away, leaving me alone. I then heard about the emergence of the Ziwei Palace at the Fengju Jade Gate. I remembered many mysterious places within the Seven Killing Palace that I didn't dare explore back then due to my insufficient strength, so I came here."</p><p>Someone who could teach Su Nu to the Soul Formation stage was definitely no ordinary person. Seeing that Su Nu didn't intend to introduce her master, Qin Sang refrained from asking.</p><p>The seal on Mount Yitian, already weakened by the passage of time, was severely damaged during the ascension and certainly couldn't contain the Devil Lord any longer.</p><p>What was the Devil Lord's cultivation at his peak?</p><p>Thinking of this, Qin Sang felt a headache.  He hadn't been very strong during the sealing, but he had contributed significantly. He wondered if the Devil Lord had remembered him, adding another enemy to his list.</p><p>However, if the Ancient Devil Lord had also been brought to this Great Thousand Worlds, as an outsider devil, hunted by everyone, he might not have a good ending.</p><p>While Qin Sang was lost in thought, Su Nu, who had been gazing at his face, her eyes flickering, suddenly spoke, "Fellow Daoist Qin, may I call you Brother Qin?"</p><p>Qin Sang was taken aback. "Of course."</p><p>“Brother Qin, thank you.”</p><p>Su Nu expressed her gratitude with sincerity, a look of relief blooming on her face, her smile as radiant as a flower.</p><p>"This is a thank you a thousand years late, but thankfully, it's not too late."</p>
