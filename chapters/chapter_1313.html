<h1>Chapter 1305: Jade of Death</h1><p>Chapter 1305: Jade of Death</p><p>“Your sword array seems to have some history, but to break my corpse array here, you still lack the skill! Why not unleash the Demonfire Banner? I wonder if this so-called world's greatest treasure lives up to its name!”</p><p>The Judge sneered.</p><p>Qin Sang remained unmoved, engaging him with the sword array while secretly communicating with Bai.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang's movements, the Judge hidden in the shadows felt a strange unease.</p><p>His main soul resided in a cultivated corpse.  He stared at Qin Sang, unable to discern the source of his apprehension.</p><p>Zu Yuan placed great importance on Qin Sang, having thoroughly studied his abilities, particularly the battle at Shuangjing Mountain, where Qiu Zhi almost forced Qin Sang to reveal all his techniques, including the Seven Souls Killing Array.</p><p>In less than a year, Qin Sang's strength shouldn't have improved significantly.</p><p>“It's coming!”</p><p>The Judge saw the demon banner swirling out from Qin Sang's sleeve, his heart clenched. Without hesitation, he immediately unleashed a long-prepared secret technique.</p><p>The corpse array emitted a series of shrill cries.</p><p>Then, clusters of luminous blue light floated out from the corpse array.</p><p>The blue light's source was actually fiery orbs, a type of dark fire, rising gently and incredibly light.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>Upon contact with the corpse energy, the dark fire instantly ignited, transforming into a sea of flames. The corpses in the array frantically spewed corpse energy, fueling the dark fire. The dark fire's intensity grew, seemingly no weaker than the Nine Netherworld Demonfire.</p><p>The next moment, the demonfire struck!</p><p>The two spirit flames collided with a resounding boom, sparks flying everywhere, waves of fire surging skyward with terrifying force, crashing into each other.</p><p>The corpse array's dark fire, though formidable, was still inferior to the Nine Netherworld Demonfire.</p><p>However, the Judge had an advantage; he had complete control over the corpse array and the dark fire.</p><p>He didn't directly clash with the Nine Netherworld Demonfire. Instead, under his manipulation, the dark fire changed constantly, blurring the line between reality and illusion, using this to entangle the Nine Netherworld Demonfire.</p><p>The dark fire consumed the corpse energy within the corpses. Soon, many corpses exhausted their energy, their fierce eyes dimming as they collapsed to the ground. The Judge showed no regret; these sacrifices were necessary to stop Qin Sang. New corpses immediately filled the gaps.</p><p>Witnessing the might of the demonfire firsthand, the Judge finally understood why so many of his comrades had fallen to Qin Sang.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The demonfire surged forward, unstoppable.</p><p>With such reckless disregard for cost, the Judge's corpses were being consumed at an alarming rate.</p><p>Suddenly, a figure silently appeared within the corpse array, its eyes blood-red, coldly staring at one particular corpse.</p><p>“Who’s there?!”</p><p>The Judge was startled.  A third person had infiltrated the corpse array undetected and pinpointed the location of his main soul!</p><p>This person was Bai.</p><p>Engaged in a fierce battle with Qin Sang, the Judge dared not hold back. Bai, observing from the sidelines, had discerned the intricacies of the corpse array, located the Judge's main soul, and, taking advantage of the Judge's distraction, secretly integrated into the array using a corpse body.</p><p>Horrified, the Judge attempted to shift his main soul into another corpse.</p><p>Sensing the Judge's movement, Bai coldly snorted, suddenly extending a hand. This hand was somewhat gaunt, with long, thin fingernails, like a ghost's claw, swiftly reaching for the corpse's back.</p><p>‘Pfft!’</p><p>Five fingers embedded deeply into the corpse.</p><p>Immediately, corpse energy erupted from Bai, black threads extending from his fingertips, like a spiderweb, instantly covering the corpse.</p><p>Simultaneously, Qin Sang seized the opportunity, fully activating the demon banner. The demonfire surged, fiercely breaking through the dark fire blockade, engulfing the corpse array in a black sea of flames.</p><p>‘Whoosh…’</p><p>Where the waves of fire passed, the corpses turned to ash.</p><p>The corpse array shattered, and the corpse containing the Judge's main soul trembled violently. He could no longer concern himself with the array and could only fight desperately. A dark ray shot out from his brow, heading straight for Bai's face.</p><p>‘Clang!’</p><p>To the Judge's despair, the dark ray struck a shield – a tortoise shell shield Bai had obtained from Qin Sang beforehand.</p><p>‘Rip!’</p><p>The corpse's body was torn in two by Bai, and a ball of yellow light leaped from the corpse's head, shooting towards the distance before being snatched up by Bai.</p><p>Within the yellow light, a pale face appeared – the Judge himself, staring at Bai in terror.</p><p>Qin Sang was delighted to have captured a living prisoner.  She put away her magical banner and rushed over.  The Judge was skilled in necromancy, and she might be able to extract information through interrogation.</p><p>Unexpectedly, something strange happened.</p><p>A flash of yellow light, and the Judge's face shattered like a mirror.</p><p>Bai let out a surprised sound, reaching into the yellow light, but it was too late. The Judge, his face full of resentment, looked at Bai before completely dissipating.</p><p>"This guy didn't have just one main soul," Bai said, frowning, his hand clenched tight. He compressed the dissipating yellow light into a ball, along with a jade pendant engraved with the character 'death', into his palm.</p><p>...</p><p>Within Yu City.</p><p>A Qi cultivator was giving orders when he suddenly heard a scream.</p><p>Beside him, a cultivator in a black robe collapsed, spitting out a mouthful of black blood – foul-smelling and sickening.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist…" The Qi cultivator remembered that the Judge was responsible for stopping Qin Sang.</p><p>The Judge struggled to sit up, his voice hoarse. "I can no longer sense the second main soul."</p><p>"What?  Your corpse array is incredibly sophisticated.  It shouldn't have depleted so quickly. Did he use some method to block your perception?" someone exclaimed in alarm.</p><p>The Judge's face darkened.  He angrily said, "It wasn't blocked. The main soul has perished, unable to send any message before death. I don't know why the main soul fell so quickly. The death jade controlling the corpse array has also fallen into that person's hands! It will take me decades to recover!"</p><p>The others were even more shocked and felt helpless. "Unless this person is also proficient in necromancy… He only broke through to Yuan Ying a few years ago?"</p><p>In their eyes, Qin Sang became even more unfathomable.  Every time they thought they had figured her out, she surprised them.</p><p>"Qi Daoist, the secret must have been leaked by that scoundrel Qu Huan. The fellow Daoists responsible for intercepting the True Daoist are also gradually weakening.  The True Daoist has not yet returned. We can only abandon the outer city to avoid greater losses. Most of the resources have been moved to the inner city. We must make a decision," a beautiful female cultivator urged.</p><p>The Qi cultivator was reluctant, but after taking a deep breath and glancing outside the city, he slowly nodded.</p><p>...</p><p>Qin Sang played with the death jade, guessing it was probably a treasure used to control the corpse array.  The Judge not only lost a main soul but also the death jade – a heavy loss.</p><p>Unfortunately, she didn't catch a living prisoner.</p><p>Qin Sang looked at Bai. Bai was holding the condensed ball of yellow light.  Corpse energy surged into it, emitting strange fluctuations. Then the ball flashed and disappeared into Bai's body.  The corpse energy on Bai's body solidified slightly.</p><p>Qin Sang was rather surprised. "I forgot to ask, Bai Xiong, how will you cultivate in the future?"</p><p>Bai twisted his neck, looking comfortable.  "Like other Corpse Kings, find a place with concentrated Yin energy and absorb it.  But there's a faster way – directly refine the extremely Yin Di Sha Qi."</p>
