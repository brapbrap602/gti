<h1>Chapter 764: Shifting Tides</h1><p>Qin Sang knew the young man was desperate.</p><p>He hid within the Ten Yama Envoys Formation, refusing to come out.</p><p>Nine Nether Devil Fire erupted from the formation, engulfing the golden ring.</p><p>For a moment, golden light was covered by devil fire, the two seemingly merging, but in reality engaged in a fierce confrontation, each trying to suppress the other within a small space.</p><p>The golden ring, capable of restraining opponent's magical treasures, seemed restricted in the face of the Nine Nether Devil Fire.  It shot out rings of light, but they were all shattered by the devil fire.</p><p>Although Qin Sang's cultivation was inferior to the young man's, wearing the poison-repelling armor, he didn't need to worry about the poisonous mist.  He prioritized stability, while the young man had to constantly divert his attention to resist the poison, and was eager to kill Qin Sang.</p><p>The three Ten Yama Envoys banners formed a grand formation, surpassing ordinary mid-grade magical treasures. With these advantages and disadvantages, the more anxious the young man became, the less effective his attacks were.</p><p>‘Boom! Boom!’</p><p>The Nine Nether Devil Fire, under the continuous impacts of the golden ring, fluctuated, its flames trembling, but it held firm.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression was grave. The difference in their strength was clear. Destroying the jade bracelet had given him the initial advantage, but he also had to be wary of the young man's desperation. One slip-up could lead to his death.</p><p>Before the jade bracelet was destroyed, the young man had been cautious. To protect it, he had held back in their exchanges, not daring to fight recklessly. Now, he had nothing to lose.</p><p>His eyes blazed with killing intent, and he attacked with all his might.</p><p>Qin Sang's strength had exceeded his expectations. A mere mid-stage Core Formation cultivator not only possessed astonishing swordsmanship but also such a powerful magical treasure.</p><p>With this treasure, it was almost impossible to defeat Qin Sang quickly.</p><p>Having witnessed the power of the Ten Yama Envoys Formation, the young man grew ruthless. Not only did he not stop, but he spared no spiritual energy, fully urging the golden ring to attack relentlessly.</p><p>The young man's offensive was like a violent storm.</p><p>Qin Sang focused entirely on controlling the treasure. The Two-Headed Hound panted by his side, then released another wave of wind blades, helping Qin Sang alleviate the pressure.</p><p>Together, man and beast showed signs of suppressing the golden ring.</p><p>Just then, a sudden change occurred.</p><p>Green light erupted from the ground, instantly spreading like a carpet. Grass and trees grew rapidly, frantically reaching towards Qin Sang's position. These were not plants, but incredibly sharp sword energies!</p><p>‘Swish, swish…’</p><p>The Ten Yama Envoys Formation was surrounded by sword energy. The young man was determined to pierce Qin Sang with a thousand swords!</p><p>Qin Sang's heart tightened. He knew the young man was making a desperate gamble. With such an unrestrained attack, it would be difficult for him to resist the poisonous mist for much longer.</p><p>Once the poison infiltrated his internal organs, even a god couldn't save him.</p><p>Qin Sang and the Two-Headed Hound roared simultaneously. The Nine Nether Devil Fire reversed, incinerating the vegetation. The Two-Headed Hound exerted all its strength, its vertical pupils shooting out gusts of wind, single-handedly resisting the golden ring.</p><p>But the young man's attack was too fierce. Even with their combined efforts, Qin Sang and the Two-Headed Hound couldn't withstand it.</p><p>Qin Sang knew he couldn't just wait to be killed. His advantage lay in his escape technique. Combining talismans with sword energy and thunderous sounds, his speed could even surpass the young man's.</p><p>Seeing that the situation was dire, Qin Sang recalled the Two-Headed Hound and immediately began to maneuver, delaying time and waiting for the young man to succumb to the poison.</p><p>As it turned out, Qin Sang's strategy worked.</p><p>The fiercest wave of attacks failed to kill Qin Sang. The young man's complexion worsened. The poison had penetrated his protective spiritual energy. Purple-red marks spread inward on his skin, invading his meridians, and waves of intense pain washed over him.</p><p>Finally, the young man could no longer endure. He had to stop, or he would die from the poison before he could kill Qin Sang.</p><p>The golden ring suddenly stopped, and the illusion receded like a tide.</p><p>The young man retrieved his treasure.</p><p>Qin Sang slowed his escape, breathing heavily, his back drenched in sweat. He had finally survived. The young man's condition was clearly deteriorating. His desperate gamble had failed, and he himself was being consumed by the poison.</p><p>He was truly the strongest opponent Qin Sang had ever encountered, so difficult to deal with.</p><p>However, before Qin Sang could relax, he suddenly noticed that the retreating grey sword, without warning, turned and thrust towards him.</p><p>The grey sword emitted a dazzling green light, its sword energy soaring, its momentum like a rainbow.</p><p>“You’re already at your limit, struggling against the poison. What use is this?”</p><p>Qin Sang stared intently at the grey sword, puzzled by the young man's action. This thought had just crossed his mind when he suddenly sensed something amiss and his expression drastically changed.</p><p>Immediately, dragon soul and sword energy manifested around him as he retreated explosively.</p><p>At the same time, Qin Sang abruptly waved his hand, unleashing the Nine Nether Devil Fire without reservation.</p><p>‘Poof!’</p><p>The grey sword plunged into the devil fire.</p><p>Qin Sang’s expression was anxious, as if he sensed imminent danger.</p><p>The next moment, a green light exploded within the Nine Nether Devil Fire, shattering it.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The thunderous explosion sent ripples through the purple mist.</p><p>The young man was struck as if by lightning, coughing up blood. His face was drained of color, and his aura suddenly weakened.</p><p>Qin Sang's face paled. He hurriedly retrieved the Ten Yama Envoys banners. He immediately felt a powerful wave of impact, sending him tumbling backward. He stumbled upon landing, barely managing to stay on his feet.</p><p>He then eagerly summoned the Ten Yama Envoys banners again, carefully inspecting them. Seeing that they were undamaged, he let out a sigh of relief.</p><p>The explosion just now was the young man decisively self-destructing his natal spirit sword!</p><p>If Qin Sang hadn't been vigilant and possessed exceptional escape skills, even if he had escaped, the Ten Yama Envoys banners might have been damaged, rendering the demonic formation incomplete.</p><p>Clearly, the young man wasn't completely desperate yet, attempting to escape the poisonous mist wasteland, perhaps still seeing a chance.</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't expected him to be so ruthless, self-destructing his natal spirit sword at this point!</p><p>Natal treasures were connected to a cultivator's mind and spirit. When a treasure was destroyed, the cultivator would also be injured, and those with special cultivation methods might even experience a drop in cultivation level.</p><p>Destroying a natal treasure and refining a new one meant not only finding the necessary materials, but also enduring a long period of nurturing, requiring immense time and effort.</p><p>The young man consumed a pill, his breathing slightly stabilizing. He stared expectantly at Qin Sang.</p><p>Seeing that Qin Sang was only injured, he was somewhat disappointed, then immediately elated because the Nine Nether Devil Fire, struck by the self-destruction of the grey sword, had dissipated on the spot.</p><p>His target had been the devil fire all along.</p><p>His sharp eyes had discerned that the key to the Ten Yama Envoys banners was the devil fire. Without it, Qin Sang would lose the only means to contend with him.</p><p>Unfortunately, Qin Sang's reaction and escape speed were too fast, preventing him from destroying the main body of the treasure.</p><p>Qin Sang also consumed a pill, suppressing his injuries. He sneered, pointing a finger at the Ten Yama Envoys banners. Black flames surged, and another mass of Nine Nether Devil Fire emerged.</p><p>The Ten Yama Envoys banners sealed the main body of the devil fire. As long as the banners weren't destroyed, there would be a continuous supply of Nine Nether Devil Fire, regardless of how many treasures the young man self-destructed.</p><p>Seeing this, the young man's eyes dimmed. He knew that his only chance was lost, and it was no longer possible to turn the tables.  Retreat became his only option.</p><p>Decisive, the young man retrieved the golden ring and retreated.</p><p>After a hard-fought battle, having achieved a hard-won victory, Qin Sang would not let him escape.  He immediately gave chase.</p>
