<h1>Chapter 122: Lingyan and Transactions</h1><p>Chapter 122: Lingyan and Transactions</p><p>When Qin Sang approached the end of the cave, he saw a burst of cyan light in front of him. Then, he saw the white cat emerge from the cyan light.</p><p>"Young master, have you killed Gu Tiannan?"</p><p>Qin Sang nodded and told the white cat to let Gu Yuan out.</p><p>Gu Yuan's abilities were far inferior to Gu Tiannan's, so it was easy to deal with him, even after his transformation. Qin Sang left Gu Yuan alive, sealed his cultivation, and planned to interrogate him later.</p><p>At this moment, the white cat walked up to Qin Sang, kowtowed, and said, "I thank Young Master Qin on Hei Wa's behalf for your kindness and chivalry in avenging his death."</p><p>Qin Sang felt ashamed. He thought about the unconscious villagers at the end of the cave and took out a bottle of healing elixirs, which he threw over to the white cat and said, "Dilute these elixirs with water and feed them to the villagers. It should be able to replenish their lost Qi and blood. Wake them up and send them down the mountain. Although you are a demon, you do not seem bloodthirsty. I will not make things difficult for you. I hope you will take care of yourself from now on. Otherwise, even Lord Qingzhu would not be able to save your life."</p><p>After warning the white cat, Qin Sang carried Gu Yuan and turned to leave.</p><p>"Young master, please wait!"</p><p>The white cat suddenly called out and stopped Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang turned around and saw that the white cat's eyes were filled with a hint of anticipation, which aroused his curiosity. Gu Tiannan was already dead. What else did the white cat want?</p><p>"What else do you want?"</p><p>The white cat hesitated for a moment before saying softly, "Young master is a kind-hearted person... I would like to make a transaction with you. I wonder if you are willing."</p><p>A transaction?</p><p>Qin Sang found it strange to be negotiating a transaction with a cat in a dark cave.</p><p>Suddenly, he noticed that the white cat's fur was bristling, and it seemed very nervous. His heart skipped a beat. Could this cat demon have something good?</p><p>"Tell me more," Qin Sang said noncommittally.</p><p>The white cat hesitated for a while before finally saying softly, "Young master should know about Lingyan, right?"</p><p>After saying this, a hint of vigilance appeared in the white cat's eyes. It quietly hugged the bamboo stick to its chest, which faintly emitted a faint cyan light, as if it was ready to run away at any moment.</p><p>"Lingyan?"</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes suddenly lit up, and he asked repeatedly, "Do you know where there is Lingyan?"</p><p>The amount of spiritual energy in heaven and earth varies. Over time, places with dense spiritual energy will slowly accumulate, forming spirit veins of varying sizes. The spiritual energy in spirit veins is much denser than in other places. Most cultivators' abodes are established on spirit veins.</p><p>Small spirit veins can provide several cultivation abodes for cultivators.</p><p>Large spirit veins, like the one on Yuanguang Peak, can be used as the foundation of an immortal sect after setting up a large formation. They are very rare in the entire Xiaohan Domain. It is said that Shaohua Mountain's spirit vein is even better than Yuanguang Peak.</p><p>This was why everyone found it unbelievable when they heard that Yuanguang Sect's Supreme Sovereign had decisively self-destructed their spirit vein. However, Yuanguang Sect later took over Queyinzong's business, so the gains and losses were balanced.</p><p>For cultivators, wealth, companions, Dharma, and land are all indispensable. When cultivators talk about land, they usually refer to the spiritual energy in their cultivation abode.</p><p>If cultivators could not find a spirit vein, those who were financially strong could buy a courtyard in a cultivator market or set up a spirit gathering formation to cultivate. Poor cultivators could only endure the thin spiritual energy and their cultivation speed would naturally be much slower than others.</p><p>Lingyan is a place where spiritual energy gathers in a spirit vein, but not all spirit veins can give birth to a Lingyan. Only the purest spirit veins, with an extreme degree of spiritual energy, can have such a magical place. It is elusive and undoubtedly the best choice for establishing a cave.</p><p>If news of an unclaimed Lingyan were to be leaked, countless cultivators would go crazy and a fierce battle would inevitably ensue.</p><p>No wonder the cat demon was so careful. Possession of something valuable could bring disaster, especially since the two of them were a human and a demon, who were inherently difficult to trust due to the deep-rooted观念 of the cultivation world.</p><p>Qin Sang's cultivation realm was not high before, so he was not that demanding in terms of spiritual energy. Now that he had broken through to the eleventh layer, he was beginning to feel that the spiritual energy in the cave of Dizhendong was not enough.</p><p>Even if he returned to Shaohua Mountain to cultivate, the best caves in Shaohua Mountain had already been occupied by his senior and junior fellow disciples. The cave he could be assigned to might not be much better than Dizhendong.</p><p>If he could find a Lingyan, it would be of great benefit to his future cultivation.</p><p>Being as lacking in talent as he is, Qin Sang would not pass up any opportunity that could increase the speed of his cultivation, but he wondered what this cat demon wanted in exchange.</p><p>Sensing the fervor in Qin Sang’s gaze, the white cat couldn’t help but clamp its tail between its legs, its fur standing on end even more prominently; its voice held a clear note of nervousness. “After that senior being enlightened me, he helped me find a spiritual eye. From that time on, I hid myself away and cultivated there. If you’re willing to trade, I can sell you the spiritual eye.”</p><p>Qin Sang was stunned upon hearing this. “Do you even know what a spiritual eye represents?”</p><p>He couldn’t believe that the cat demon would want to sell its own dwelling; for a cultivator, that was a choice so foolish that it bordered on the idiotic.</p><p>The white cat sighed quietly. “I do, but I don’t have any other options. I don’t have any cultivation techniques to follow, and I haven’t made any progress in years. That senior being told me before he left that he would come back after several years to take me away, but he never appeared again. All of the demons I meet nearby are beasts with no awakened sentience; they cultivate based on instinct and can’t offer me guidance. I’m afraid of being hunted and killed because I’m a demon, so I don’t dare approach any other cultivators. I have no companions with whom I can discuss the Dao. Once before, I met a casual cultivator who tricked me; later, he wanted to skin me and refine my fur into a magic tool. I’m at my wit’s end. I heard that Western Demon Mound is full of demons…”</p><p>Only after hearing the white cat’s words did Qin Sang understand its intentions.</p><p>Unwilling to resign itself to a dead end on the path of cultivation, it was willing to brave danger and leave behind the safety of its lair. Undeterred by the distance, it had crossed the territory of human cultivators and come to Demon Mound in search of guidance.</p><p>It reminded Qin Sang of himself in his early days.</p><p>The cat demon was also rather cautious; it was clear that it found it hard to trust humans and demons alike. The fact that it had helped Hei Wa was both because of their ancestral ties and because it wanted to make contact with a disciple of a righteous cultivation sect. It had only proposed this exchange because it was in such straits.</p><p>If Qin Sang had not stood up to Gu Tiannan, it would have understood that he harbored justice in his heart. If he had joined forces with Gu Tiannan, the white cat would never have mentioned the subject.</p><p>The cat demon’s approach was somewhat naive, but it was probably also out of desperation.</p><p>Of course Qin Sang wanted the spiritual eye, but he was also fully aware of its value. Of the items on his person, only the Ebonywood Sword, the Pitch-black Bead, and the Ten Directions Yama Banner could be considered valuable, but he definitely couldn’t use them for the exchange.</p><p>“What do you want?” Qin Sang asked tentatively.</p><p>The white cat seemed to have been ready for this question; it hurriedly replied, “I’m not greedy. All I want is a detailed map of Demon Mound and a few defensive magic tools.”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, contemplating the matter. He had a topographic map of the Small Cold Domain on hand, but selecting the magic tools was a bit more challenging. It wasn’t certain that any of them would be good enough to satisfy the cat demon.</p>
