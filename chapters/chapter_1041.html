<h1>Chapter 1033: Infiltration</h1><p>The three tokens resonated strangely with each other.</p><p>The Eastern Alliance Leader let the tokens float before him, his lips moving slightly as he formed hand seals and pressed downwards.</p><p>The illusory blades floating around him shimmered and charged towards the Immortal Restriction.</p><p>In the next moment, the Eastern Alliance Leader let out a low growl, his face contorted and veins bulging. His aura shifted dramatically, and a shadow suddenly appeared behind him.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the shadow transformed into the image of a three-headed, six-armed ancient demon!</p><p>The demonic image, though slightly translucent, exuded a terrifying aura.</p><p>Simultaneously, the Eastern Alliance Leader’s other hand retrieved a palm-sized, equally grotesque three-headed, six-armed demonic statue.</p><p>The demonic shadow flashed and merged into the statue.</p><p>A series of cracking sounds echoed as the statue rapidly grew, coming to life. It transformed into a real ancient demon, its eyes burning with a terrifying凶光 that chilled the heart.</p><p>The demonic statue’s heads turned, two looking towards the Immortal Restriction above, and the third fixating on the Eastern Alliance Leader, its gaze flickering uncertainly.</p><p>The Eastern Alliance Leader’s heart tightened. Under the statue’s gaze, he felt a stinging sensation.</p><p>He could sense that the statue might not fully obey his commands and showed signs of breaking free from his control.</p><p>Realizing this, the Eastern Alliance Leader’s expression darkened. He quickly executed a mental incantation, groaning and turning deathly pale. Then, he spat out a mouthful of blood essence, forming a blood restriction on the statue, finally gaining true control over it.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>The Eastern Alliance Leader pointed at the Immortal Restriction.</p><p>By now, the illusory blades conjured by the spirit array had already entered the shimmering light of the Immortal Restriction.</p><p>Faint ripples appeared within the shimmering light.</p><p>The illusory blades covered a wide area, encompassing the entire summit and the surrounding Immortal Restriction. As the light fluctuated, profound runes faintly emerged.</p><p>These illusory blades seemed to be probing the Immortal Restriction bit by bit, searching for its weaknesses.</p><p>The Eastern Alliance Leader stared intently at the shimmering light.</p><p>Moments later, one of the tokens flashed, shining brighter than before.</p><p>The Eastern Alliance Leader’s expression shifted slightly. He then pointed to a specific location on the Immortal Restriction and commanded, “Go!”</p><p>The demonic statue grinned ferociously. Its body shot upwards, its six arms raised like demonic swords, piercing into the shimmering light of the Immortal Restriction.</p><p>‘Poof!’</p><p>The shimmering light flared.</p><p>Profound runes shattered, revealing a breach.</p><p>The Immortal Restriction began to retaliate. Bolts of lightning erupted from the shimmering light, striking the demonic statue.</p><p>‘Boom! Boom! Boom!’</p><p>The statue trembled violently. Demonic light surged from its body, resisting the backlash of the Immortal Restriction. Despite this, cracks appeared on its body, and one arm was even severed, falling into the shimmering light and quickly disintegrating into ashes.</p><p>Seeing the terrifying power of the Immortal Restriction, a look of shock flashed across the Eastern Alliance Leader’s eyes.</p><p>But he didn’t stop, forcefully ordering the statue to push forward.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The statue successfully entered the depths of the shimmering light.</p><p>Seeing this, the Eastern Alliance Leader let out a relieved sigh, murmuring, “This statue truly does counter the Immortal Restriction. Unfortunately, it's too difficult to create. Even with the combined efforts of the three great merchant alliances, we’ve only managed to refine this one.”</p><p>With the statue inside, the Immortal Restriction’s backlash intensified, causing violent tremors that affected the surroundings, creating a huge commotion.</p><p>The Eastern Alliance Leader's smile vanished. He quickly erased all traces and retreated.</p><p>Despite his attempts to conceal his actions, the changes in the Immortal Restriction were no longer hidden.</p><p>In the distance, the old woman with the cane was patrolling.  Sensing something, she abruptly turned towards the mountain peak, a look of uncertainty on her face.</p><p>Then, her figure flickered as she sped towards it.</p><p>At the same time…</p><p>The old man had left the volcanic island at some point, traversing the lava to an unknown location. Clutching the token tightly, he looked nervously at the thick grey fog above.</p><p>The fog constantly swirled, but remained relatively calm.</p><p>Just then…</p><p>A hurricane suddenly and unexpectedly erupted within the grey fog.</p><p>‘Rumble…’</p><p>The fog was completely disrupted as the hurricane burst out, surging downwards.  It tore at the earth, whipping up scorching lava as if the entire space was violently shaking.</p><p>At the very center of the storm, the old man's body glowed red. Armor materialized, protecting him from the lava and debris.</p><p>Then, he stomped his foot and charged directly into the depths of the hurricane.</p><p>Only after entering the fog did he realize that there was a barrier formed by a restriction.</p><p>This barrier wasn't an Immortal Restriction, but one created later.</p><p>The barrier, originally protected by the Immortal Restriction, now faced a double-edged sword. The Immortal Restriction’s aftershocks impacted the barrier, causing cracks to appear.</p><p>Originally, even a late-stage Nascent Soul cultivator would have found it nearly impossible to breach this restriction.</p><p>Now, however, the old man had an opportunity.</p><p>“The Alliance Leader is truly unfathomable, actually capable of breaching the Immortal Restriction!”</p><p>The old man marveled.</p><p>Heeding the Alliance Leader's instructions, he waited until the fluctuations in the Immortal Restriction weakened slightly and the cracks began to close.  Spotting a larger fissure, he charged through without hesitation.</p><p>Emerging from the barrier…</p><p>His vision was instantly filled with blinding shimmering light.</p><p>“Crack!”</p><p>Crushing pressure descended, dimming the old man’s armor, which was on the verge of shattering.</p><p>Enduring the intense pain, the old man’s eyes widened. Unable to see anything clearly, he gripped the token tightly, transforming into a streak of sword light, taking advantage of the moment to traverse the shimmering light.</p><p>Even though this was only the edge of the shimmering light, its power was far less intense than the center of the Immortal Restriction, the old man still lost several protective treasures.</p><p>Within the Foundation Establishment trial grounds…</p><p>Sunu and the others stared blankly at the sky above.</p><p>Shortly after the token was activated…</p><p>Dark clouds gathered and lightning erupted.</p><p>Fear gripped everyone. They looked towards their senior brother, only to find him equally bewildered.</p><p>The scene was terrifying, as if heaven and earth were splitting apart!</p><p>A massive hole seemed to have opened in the sky, as if it was about to collapse.</p><p>Wind and lightning lashed against the cliffs on either side, sending boulders tumbling down and shaking the ground.</p><p>They couldn't have imagined that activating the token would cause such a commotion, and no one understood why.</p><p>Even though this location was some distance from the Hundred Treasures Pavilion, the cultivators there must have noticed the anomaly.</p><p>“Senior Brother, what did Master actually tell you to do? What are you hiding from us?!”</p><p>The seductive woman cried out, her face filled with terror as she stared at the terrifying scene above, angrily questioning him.</p><p>The long-bearded elder hesitated, "Master only instructed me to activate the token, nothing more…"</p><p>“Look! What's that? It looks like someone!”</p><p>The burly man suddenly interrupted, pointing at the massive hole in the sky.</p><p>Everyone quickly looked over.</p><p>A silver light had appeared within the hole at some point.</p><p>The silver light descended from the heavens, seemingly enveloping a human figure!</p><p>“There really is someone! Have we unleashed some kind of demon?”</p><p>The seductive woman anxiously stared for a moment, her expression suddenly changing. “Wait… it seems like…”</p><p>“It’s Master!”</p><p>The long-bearded elder gasped, his face filled with shock.</p><p>“Master has infiltrated here!”</p><p>Everyone was stunned, unable to believe it.</p><p>--</p><p>--</p><p>Returning home, there are a lot of things to do.</p><p>This is to make up for yesterday's chapter. I'll continue writing through the night and finish both yesterday's and today's updates.  Everyone can read them tomorrow morning.</p>
