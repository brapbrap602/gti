<h1>Chapter Two Thousand: Seed of Fire</h1><p>The Biyuan Shuanghua Divine Liquid couldn't be directly consumed by spirit insects; it required the master's assistance to refine.</p><p>Qin Sang formed a hand seal, and the divine liquid exploded into a mist, enveloping the Heaven's Eye Butterfly.</p><p>Within the hazy mist, the Heaven's Eye Butterfly gently flapped its wings, creating ripples. The divine liquid adhered to its wings, gradually seeping in, being absorbed and refined by the butterfly.</p><p>Qin Sang sat cross-legged on the sea surface, his gaze fixed on the Heaven's Eye Butterfly.</p><p>The refinement of the Biyuan Shuanghua Divine Liquid and the breakthrough were happening simultaneously.</p><p>At this moment, the Heaven's Eye Butterfly had begun its assault on the bottleneck. Its wings trembled slightly, the tremors growing more pronounced.</p><p>Qin Sang sensed the Heaven's Eye Butterfly's pain as it underwent the breakthrough. He could only gently soothe it, circulating the secret techniques of the *Panhu True Scripture* to help stabilize its foundation.</p><p>The mist gradually thinned.</p><p>The Heaven's Eye Butterfly's aura fluctuated dramatically. Its wings tightly wrapped around its body like a cocoon, the patterns on them becoming increasingly vibrant.</p><p>"Is it going to form a cocoon?"</p><p>Qin Sang's heart stirred.</p><p>Normally, spirit insects would undergo a process of cocooning and transformation during breakthroughs. While in the cocoon, the spirit insect would slumber, the duration varying. This was the spirit insect's most vulnerable stage.</p><p>Subduing a spirit insect was often done at this time, as the chances of success were highest.</p><p>The Heaven's Eye Butterfly had formed a cocoon during its initial transformation. However, during its fourth and fifth transformations, due to special circumstances, it hadn't followed the usual pattern of cocooning, slumbering, and emerging.</p><p>This time, there were no external interferences, but Qin Sang wasn't sure if the Heaven's Eye Butterfly would still form a cocoon.</p><p>Moreover, a spirit insect cultivating to the sixth transformation was equivalent to the Void Refinement realm. It would undoubtedly undergo earth-shattering changes, and previous experience might not apply.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang noticed a faint light emanating from the Heaven's Eye Butterfly, emitting peculiar fluctuations.</p><p>The faint light seemed to be composed of countless minuscule threads of light, swaying gently like soft绒毛.</p><p>Under this light, the patterns on the Heaven's Eye Butterfly became even more brilliant. A transparent membrane separated the butterfly from the outside world, forming a cocoon of light.</p><p>"It really is going to form a cocoon. This time, it's likely to slumber for a long time..."</p><p>Qin Sang thought.  Cocooning and slumbering were part of the spirit insect's transformation process. The moment of breaking free from the cocoon was also the final moment of transformation, coinciding with the arrival of the Heavenly Tribulation. This trip seemed to be in vain.</p><p>Just as Qin Sang was pondering, he suddenly sensed something amiss.</p><p>*Splash!*</p><p>Without any warning, the tightly clasped wings of the Heaven's Eye Butterfly vibrated violently, creating ripples on the light cocoon.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression changed instantly.</p><p>The situation quickly deteriorated. The Heaven's Eye Butterfly's wings trembled uneasily, as if a tremendous force was trying to pry them open, and the butterfly was desperately resisting.</p><p>If the wings opened and the light cocoon shattered, it would signify the failure of the breakthrough.</p><p>Qin Sang's face flickered with various emotions, having not anticipated this turn of events.  Spirit medicines were rare, and the opportunity for a breakthrough was fleeting. If this attempt failed, he didn't know how long he would have to wait for the next one.</p><p>Indeed, nothing in the world was foolproof, especially a spirit insect breaking through to the sixth transformation. Even as a Void Refinement cultivator, he couldn't guarantee success.</p><p>Perhaps the Heaven's Eye Butterfly could overcome this hurdle on its own. But if it waited until the last moment and failed, it would be too late for Qin Sang to intervene.</p><p>Qin Sang no longer hesitated, decisively forcing out his own lifeblood.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>Like the Biyuan Shuanghua Divine Liquid before, the lifeblood exploded into a bloody mist, directly permeating the Heaven's Eye Butterfly's body.</p><p>Witch cultivators nurtured their natal insect gu with their lifeblood. However, such a crude method was to be avoided as much as possible. On the one hand, it could cause the spirit insect to become ferocious and turn on its master. On the other hand, it could also affect the spirit insect's foundation, creating hidden dangers. Each feeding required the use of various secret techniques.</p><p>Qin Sang had always been extremely cautious before, and this time, it was out of necessity. However, it would only be this once. With more effort in the future, it could hopefully be remedied.</p><p>Qin Sang knew which was more important.</p><p>Ignoring his own well-being, he continuously forced out drops of his purest lifeblood, transforming them into layers of bloody mist, which the Heaven's Eye Butterfly devoured.</p><p>The Heaven's Eye on the wings shimmered with blood, permeated with blood threads.  Its gaze was both penetrating and ferocious, as if it had fallen into the demonic path.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't dare to relax for a moment, meticulously controlling the process based on the changes in the Heaven's Eye Butterfly's state.</p><p>After consuming Qin Sang's lifeblood, the Heaven's Eye Butterfly's aura changed again. Its wings stopped trembling, and the light cocoon gradually calmed down. The bloody glow in the Heaven's Eye also gradually faded.</p><p>As the light cocoon grew thicker and the Heaven's Eye Butterfly's condition stabilized, Qin Sang, his face filled with exhaustion, was about to stop when another unexpected change occurred!</p><p>*Rip!*</p><p>A crack appeared in the light cocoon.</p><p>Qin Sang's heart skipped a beat. He then realized that nothing was wrong with the Heaven's Eye Butterfly; it had actively torn open the light cocoon.</p><p>The cocoon was complete, but the Heaven's Eye Butterfly hadn't entered slumber. Instead, it tore the cocoon open!</p><p>At the same time, Qin Sang felt an extremely urgent intent from the Heaven's Eye Butterfly. It wanted to come out and find something, something it desperately needed, something it couldn't wait for even a moment.</p><p>Qin Sang knew what it needed: the Tribulation Lightning!</p><p>*Crack!*</p><p>Another crack appeared in the light cocoon. A leg stretched out, grabbed the cocoon, and pulled hard.</p><p>*Rip!*</p><p>The light cocoon instantly shattered.  Brilliant wings suddenly unfolded, revealing a graceful butterfly. Each pattern was perfect, like the most beautiful sprite in the vast world.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>A violent wind erupted, and dark clouds gathered in the sky.</p><p>Day turned into night.</p><p>The dark clouds churned, lightning danced, and heavenly might descended upon this area of the sea, creating a terrifying storm.</p><p>Perhaps driven by the Heaven's Eye Butterfly's urgent intent, or perhaps due to the effect of Qin Sang's lifeblood, similar to when it devoured the Vermillion Bird's blood essence and broke through to the fourth transformation, after a brief cocooning process, the Heaven's Eye Butterfly instantly reached the final stage of its transformation, attracting the Heavenly Tribulation!</p><p>Everything that had happened today was too unexpected. Qin Sang was somewhat caught off guard, but his reaction was swift. Ignoring his own weakness, he immediately mobilized the surrounding spiritual energy, sealing off this area of the sea to prevent the leakage of Qi.</p><p>The Tribulation Lightning was still brewing, but the Heaven's Eye Butterfly couldn't wait. Flapping its wings, it flew towards the tribulation clouds.</p><p>Facing the perilous tribulation clouds, a fragile butterfly charged forward without hesitation.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>*Crack!*</p><p>Lightning converged above the Heaven's Eye Butterfly, transforming into a lightning dragon that descended with the aura of destruction.</p><p>The Heaven's Eye Butterfly showed no fear. Its Heaven's Eye flashed, shooting out two bolts of Azure Lightning, meeting the tribulation lightning head-on and attempting to assimilate and devour it.</p><p>Qin Sang had witnessed this scene in the Talisman World.</p><p>He looked at the tribulation clouds and noticed that after the first bolt of tribulation lightning struck, the clouds hadn't disappeared.</p><p>After cultivators entered the Void Refinement realm, the Forty-Nine Heavenly Tribulation became the Sixty-Nine Heavenly Tribulation. The Heavenly Tribulation for spirit insects had also changed; it was no longer just a single bolt of lightning.</p><p>After the first bolt of tribulation lightning passed, it either dissipated as lightning or was assimilated and devoured by the Heaven's Eye Butterfly.</p><p>Then came the second, the third...</p><p>Later, this area of the sea was completely filled with thunder and lightning. Countless arcs of electricity flickered incessantly, making it impossible to distinguish between the heavenly tribulation lightning and the Heaven's Eye Butterfly's True Lightning.</p><p>Within the sea of lightning, the Heaven's Eye Butterfly was pursued by the tribulation lightning. Its figure flickered, appearing and disappearing, as if it were constantly teleporting, dodging and resisting the tribulation lightning while continuously devouring the surrounding stray lightning.</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang's expression shifted. Just as he was about to get a clearer look, he noticed another change in the tribulation clouds.</p><p>All the lightning converged into a single bolt and struck down with a roar.</p><p>"The Sixth Transformation Heavenly Tribulation for spirit insects, one transforming into nine," Qin Sang had been silently counting the tribulation lightning. This last bolt was the ninth.</p><p>A spirit insect's Heavenly Tribulation still couldn't compare to a cultivator's, but for a spirit insect, it was still a life-or-death ordeal.</p><p>However, the Heaven's Eye Butterfly didn't appear to be on the verge of life or death.</p><p>Facing the ninth bolt of tribulation lightning, the Heaven's Eye Butterfly sensed the danger and finally curled up its body.</p><p>As the tribulation lightning struck, the lightning accumulated on the surface of the Heaven's Eye Butterfly's body. A clear boundary appeared at the edges, where the Separation and Reunion Divine Light neutralized the lightning, but the sixth transformation tribulation lightning wasn't so easy to dispel.</p><p>The violent lightning engulfed the Heaven's Eye Butterfly, as if sealing it within a thick bolt of lightning, wreaking havoc.</p><p>After a brief stalemate, a brilliant glow suddenly appeared within the lightning. Then, a nimble butterfly shadow unfolded its wings, flickering repeatedly within the lightning, piercing through it in the blink of an eye and flying into the sky.</p><p>The tribulation clouds hadn't completely dispersed yet, but the Heaven's Eye Butterfly charged into them like a wolf entering a flock of sheep, actually preying on the scattered tribulation lightning within the clouds.</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang's eyelids twitched. Even though the power of a spirit insect's Heavenly Tribulation was weaker, this act was still quite astonishing.</p><p>The Heavenly Tribulation, now at its end, could no longer threaten the Heaven's Eye Butterfly. It flitted about, freely devouring the tribulation lightning like a joyous child.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>The Heaven's Eye Butterfly flew into Qin Sang's arms, clutching his clothes tightly. Its large, limpid eyes gazed at him.</p><p>Besides the Heaven's Eye on its back, the Heaven's Eye Butterfly also had eyes. Its gaze was lively and affectionate, sparkling with intelligence.</p><p>It had developed sentience, but still couldn't truly transform.</p><p>"The path of cultivation for spirit insects is truly arduous. No wonder there are no tribulations in between. I just don't know if their lifespans will be limited due to innate deficiencies. The Heavenly Dao should be fair..."</p><p>Qin Sang thought to himself, gently patting the Heaven's Eye Butterfly.  He was about to test what divine abilities it had comprehended, but the butterfly tilted its head and fell into a deep sleep in his arms.</p><p>His brow furrowed.</p><p>Qin Sang carefully examined the butterfly, confirming that it was unharmed. It needed to sleep to recover from forcibly breaking out of its cocoon and digest the power of the tribulation lightning.  His brow relaxed.</p><p>It was clear that the Heaven's Eye Butterfly had gained immensely this time. Previously, it only devoured and utilized tribulation lightning. This time, it seemed to have fused with its own divine abilities. He wondered what kind of transformation it would undergo.</p><p>Qin Sang was curious, but didn't wake it up, lest it leave any adverse effects.</p><p>He suddenly thought, after this transformation, would the cultivation method for the Seventh Transformation Void Butterfly, which he hoped to obtain from the Ghost Mother, still be suitable for the Heaven's Eye Butterfly?</p><p>...</p><p>Qingyang Temple, Main Hall.</p><p>After returning from the sea, Qin Sang met Taiyi and made a strange discovery. "Your cultivation hasn't progressed in these past few years?"</p><p>"This subordinate acted on his own accord, please forgive me, Lord!"</p><p>Taiyi explained his discovery and thoughts.</p><p>It turned out that after years of comprehending the Thunder Altar and fourth-order thunder talismans, Taiyi had gained new insights.</p><p>As a spirit talisman that had attained sentience through cultivation, he unexpectedly discovered a point of resonance with himself within the Thunder Altar and the fourth-order thunder talismans.  It was difficult to describe, but if he could grasp its true meaning, it would not only greatly benefit his cultivation but also make controlling the Thunder Altar easier.</p><p>Inspiration was fleeting. Taiyi didn't dare to break his meditative state and hadn't had time to report to Qin Sang.</p><p>He had spent these years immersed in comprehension and was starting to see some results.</p><p>"Oh?"</p><p>Qin Sang became interested. "Tell me more."</p><p>Taiyi pondered for a moment, carefully recalling his insights, and began to explain in a deep voice.</p><p>Listening to Taiyi's description, Qin Sang nodded from time to time, finding Taiyi's ideas quite reasonable.</p><p>After Taiyi finished speaking, seeing Qin Sang lost in thought, he quietly stood to the side.</p><p>Qin Sang was deducing for Taiyi. If it proved feasible, Taiyi's chances of breaking through to late-stage Nascent Soul would greatly increase. Moreover, he wouldn't have to wait until late-stage Nascent Soul to control the Thunder Altar to slay enemies. However, the price would be substantial, possibly even leading to Taiyi's self-destruction.</p><p>Nevertheless, as long as the Thunder Altar could be activated, it would be enough to deter most enemies.</p><p>Qingyang Temple had no mortal enemies outside. Qin Sang had forged alliances at the Azure Sky Dharma Assembly, both with righteous and demonic sects. It was unlikely that powerful enemies would attack immediately after his departure.  If Taiyi used this time to break through to late-stage Nascent Soul, the stability of Qingyang Temple could be ensured.</p><p>Qin Sang had originally intended to wait a little longer, until the next arrival of the Golden City, before setting off for the Great Zhou Dynasty.</p><p>This way, he would have no worries and wouldn't need to linger.</p><p>...</p><p>"Master, you called for me."</p><p>Yu Lang, who was cultivating, was awakened by Qin Sang and hurried over.</p><p>Qin Sang stood on the mountaintop with his hands behind his back, gazing at the landscape. He said softly, "In my life, I've dabbled in spirit cultivation, Dharma cultivation, body refinement, the Dao, Buddhism, demon cultivation, demonic arts, corpse refinement, ghost cultivation, assassination arts, swordsmanship, insect control, poison arts, thunder arts, artifact refinement, yin and yang, the five elements, and so on.  I've explored many paths, but mastered none."</p><p>Yu Lang was puzzled, kneeling on the ground and not daring to interrupt, shocked by the breadth of his master's knowledge.</p><p>"You're probably wondering why I haven't passed down any top-tier inheritances to you," Qin Sang turned around and said.</p><p>"This disciple wouldn't dare. Master surely has a profound reason," Yu Lang said respectfully.</p><p>"Being scattered and unfocused is not a good thing.  Like me, you have a resolute will. But you are also different from me. You have determined your own path early on. My path isn't suitable for you," Qin Sang enlightened him.</p><p>Yu Lang looked up, a glimmer of understanding in his eyes.</p><p>"You desire to walk the Great Vehicle path. I will give this world to you."</p><p>Qin Sang pointed beyond the mountain.  He continued, "You wish to pioneer the Martial Dao. I can't help you much in that regard. I've had some thoughts, which I will share with you now.  Demonic beasts cultivate Dharma Bodies. Can martial artists have Martial Bodies? Demonic beasts condense Dharma Bodies using their bloodline divine abilities. What about humans? What do martial artists have?  Unwavering perseverance, an unwavering focus on martial arts, chivalry, upholding righteousness, skills approaching the Dao, even ending war through martial might.  All kinds of spirits, beliefs, and wills, although intangible, contain immense power.  Just like sword intent, fist intent, saber intent, spear intent, all can become the Dao.  How to break through innate limitations, temper martial intent, and how to condense a Martial Body.  Besides martial intent, what other qualities can lead to a Martial Body, or even beyond the limitations of a Martial Body? These are the questions you need to ponder..."</p><p>Qin Sang saw both excitement and confusion in Yu Lang's eyes. He knew that these concepts were still a bit premature for Yu Lang. Only after reaching Nascent Soul would he truly touch upon the level of the Dao.</p><p>"My words are merely a starting point. These are the inheritances I have chosen to help you comprehend the Dao.  Do not open them until you reach Nascent Soul," Qin Sang produced a jade slip.</p><p>"Master!"</p><p>Yu Lang kowtowed deeply, tears welling up in his eyes. He had a premonition that his master was about to leave.</p><p>"There are no feasts that do not end. I am also on the path of seeking the Dao. I hope that one day, you can join me on this journey."</p><p>In the future, if Qin Sang chose the Great Vehicle Path of Slaughter, and Yu Lang achieved something, he could help him comprehend the Great Dao.</p><p>A disciple was a successor of the Dao, and could also be a protector of the Dao.</p><p>Of course, it was still too early to think about these things.  Qin Sang was merely planting a seed.</p><p>Tears streamed down Yu Lang's face as he suddenly saw a fiery red glow before him.</p><p>A sword was planted in the ground before him.  The sword's shape was ancient, dignified, and imposing.  It was entirely crimson, the flames burning on its blade bringing infinite hope.</p><p>"The sword's name: Seed of Fire!"</p><p>Qin Sang drifted away, his voice ethereal.</p><p>The Seed of Fire Sword was precisely crafted from the trunk of the Sun God Tree. Qin Sang retrieved the green copper block from the Purple Subtlety Palace.</p><p>In addition, Qin Sang left the Earth Travelling Boat to Taiyi.</p>
