<h1>Chapter 1553: The Sea-巡逻夜叉</h1><p>Chapter 1553: The Sea-巡逻夜叉</p><p>The commotion outside alerted the cultivators in the cabin, who rushed out, thinking they'd encountered enemies.  It was just a newly-awakened minor demon.  Such minor demons were common in the outer seas; after days at sea, everyone was used to them and paid it no mind.  Zhou Jin's actions, however, struck them as odd.</p><p>Zhou Jin used his true energy to conjure a hand, seizing the fish demon's head. With a forceful squeeze, the fish demon let out a pained whimper, its body convulsing. Its skull suddenly cracked open, releasing a small, rice-yellow pearl.</p><p>The pearl shimmered with a faint yellow light; shadows writhed within.</p><p>Just as Zhou Jin reached for it,</p><p>*pop!*  The inner image suddenly collided, shattering the pearl into dust.</p><p>In the instant of the pearl's self-destruction, a fluctuation clearly not belonging to the fish demon flashed past.</p><p>“Hiss…”</p><p>Sensing the fluctuation, everyone's faces changed.</p><p>Those present were all at least Foundation Establishment cultivators, experienced and knowledgeable. They instantly realized what it meant; the more perceptive among them immediately summoned their weapons and treasures.  Someone flew into the air to survey the surroundings.</p><p>"Someone's controlling the fish demon?"</p><p>The others looked to Qin Sang.  The fish demon was their initial discovery, and Qin Sang was clearly the leader of the three.</p><p>Qin Sang narrowed his eyes slightly and said calmly, "I didn't pay much attention earlier, but I noticed we've encountered the same type of fish demon multiple times since entering this sea area, which raised my suspicions. Now it seems this fish demon was indeed controlled. Whether it's by human or demon, we can't yet determine. However, this control method doesn't seem like a human technique."</p><p>"So you mean it's a spy for a high-level demon beast? Why would a high-level demon beast set up an outpost here?"</p><p>A commotion arose on the ship; some exclaimed in alarm.</p><p>To command spies so secretly…</p><p>Could they have inadvertently intruded upon the territory of a powerful transformed demon? Which transformed demon would choose a lair so close to the inner sea?</p><p>Qin Sang's thoughts raced.</p><p>A high-level demon beast controlling a fish demon to monitor this sea area… could there really be some secret?</p><p>If he'd misjudged, and a cultivator was controlling the fish demon, that would be even more concerning.</p><p>At this time, the person who had flown into the air returned to the ship.  In response to the questioning gazes of those present, they shook their heads helplessly, having found no unusual signs.</p><p>"Daoist Leng, there are still a few places we haven't checked, but I don't think it's necessary. We shouldn't stay here long. Let's return to the Southern Red Island Chain as soon as possible, observe the situation, and make plans later. What do you all think?"</p><p>A monk suggested a retreat.</p><p>Most aboard weren't actually seeking treasure; no one wanted to risk their lives investigating, so they quickly reached a consensus.</p><p>The ship tilted, changing direction to return to the Southern Red Island Chain.  Everyone separated to maintain vigilance.</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't in a hurry to separate from the Zhou couple. The situation was unclear; they didn't know the opponent's purpose or location. Revealing their identity now might create more variables.</p><p>No one lacked spirit stones, and they pushed the ship to its maximum speed.</p><p>Initially,</p><p>they sped for an incense stick of time.</p><p>The sea remained calm, everything normal.</p><p>Just as everyone thought they'd escaped danger, Qin Sang's expression suddenly changed; a gleam flashed in his eyes, his spiritual sense stirring slightly. An ice blade appeared in his palm, its blade silently flickering.</p><p>This blade was called the Snow-Treading Divine Blade, one of several magical treasures recorded in the *Qingwei Records*.</p><p>The top-tier ones were from Yin Changsheng's Suspend Sword Pavilion, but they were far too difficult to refine.  After careful consideration, Qin Sang chose one of the easier ones to refine—the Snow-Treading Divine Blade.</p><p>Qin Sang still positioned his avatar as a support and a backup for resurrection. At least until his main body prepared to break through to the Nascent Soul stage, he didn't plan to invest too much energy.</p><p>He used the remains of Lord Yin, along with some of the rewards from helping Tong Lingyu control Xuan Tian Palace, to forge the blade's core for his avatar.  His avatar nurtured it until recently, when it finally matured into a blade.</p><p>In terms of quality, it was slightly inferior to the Golden Sinking Sword Qin Sang had repeatedly refined, but it was more compatible with his avatar.</p><p>In addition, his avatar had made some progress in the *Xuan Tian Yi Qi Great Capture Hand*.</p><p>The *Ice Soul Divine Light* had made no progress and was essentially abandoned.</p><p>Qin Sang now deeply understood how difficult this divine ability was, understanding why the Listening Snow Pavilion had declined.  Though he cultivated the improved version from Liuli and had refined Ice Soul Gang Qi, the ability wasn't suited to him and remained incredibly difficult, forcing him to switch to the *Xuan Tian Yi Qi Great Capture Hand*.</p><p>Four-tiered Serpent Seal, Snow-Treading Divine Blade, and the *Xuan Tian Yi Qi Great Capture Hand*.</p><p>With these abilities, they could even stand a chance against powerful cultivators.  It's quality over quantity when it comes to treasures, so the avatar returned the Golden Sinking Sword and the Sun God Tree to its original form.</p><p>Soon, others noticed something amiss.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The treasure ship screeched to a halt. The scene ahead caused everyone to gasp.</p><p>A massive cloud appeared on the sea's surface, blotting out the sun.  Demonic energy surged skyward, rolling towards them.</p><p>Upon closer inspection, it was a cloud formed by countless demonic beasts.  A huge swarm had somehow appeared, blocking their path back and closing in for the kill.</p><p>No one believed it was a coincidence.</p><p>“Beast tide!”</p><p>Someone cried out in alarm.</p><p>If it were only a tide of low-level demonic beasts, the cultivators on board could easily fight their way out.  However, they sensed a threat among the swarm – high-level demonic beasts at the Yao Dan stage!</p><p>Only when the swarm appeared did the beasts' roars begin.  Clearly, these beasts were well-trained and controlled by a highly intelligent demon.</p><p>The East Sea demon tribe had been attracted. Even without the ancient immortal sect ruins, there must be some unknown secret.  But their immediate concern wasn't that; it was escaping!</p><p>“Senior Qin, what should we do?”</p><p>Zhou Jin and Ruan Yu clung to Qin Sang.  With Qin Sang present, they were less nervous, but still worried that a shapeshifting demon king lurked behind the swarm, leaving Qin Sang unable to protect them.</p><p>“Let's wait and see.”</p><p>Qin Sang held her Snow Stepping Divine Blade, poised to strike.  With her other hand, she flicked out a sliver of cold light, summoning a discreet ice chain.</p><p>Simultaneously,</p><p>The treasure ship's protective formation activated at full power. The formation created a protective dome around the ship, but it seemed thin and fragile against the beast tide.</p><p>“Everyone, today, we must fight our way out together! If we fight individually, the consequences of being surrounded by the swarm need not be explained.”</p><p>Leng Qi shouted sternly.</p><p>Everyone understood this, and no one dared to conceal their abilities any longer.</p><p>For a moment, the cultivators were bathed in shimmering light. Various divine abilities and treasures appeared, encompassing Buddhist, demonic, ghost, and Daoist arts.</p><p>“Drum God Wind! So it's Daoist Yuan Feng from the Yuan Feng Sect. Legend says the Drum God Wind melts flesh and bone—truly as rumored!”</p><p>One person brought out a pouch-like treasure, emitting a green divine wind that surrounded them, making their figure hazy. As soon as the treasure appeared, it was recognized by someone nearby.</p><p>The cultivator remained unmoved, glancing at the other's armor.  “My Drum God Wind wouldn’t be able to break through the Hun Yuan Armor of the Hun Yuan Sect.”</p><p>The other person’s expression faltered slightly before laughing it off.</p><p>Similar conversations occurred repeatedly.  The cultivators remained unaffected. Knowing their companions’ backgrounds and abilities boosted their confidence. They worked together efficiently; some helped Leng Qi reinforce the ship's defenses, while others prepared to strike the swarm head-on.</p><p>The ice chain formed a loop, hanging above Qin Sang's head.</p><p>Zhou Jin continued to control the jade ring, remaining vigilant.</p><p>Ruan Yu was surrounded by a layer of fine silk to protect herself from harm.</p><p>The swarm gradually closed in.</p><p>Everyone could now clearly see the whole picture. The number of demonic beasts wasn't as large as they had initially imagined; it didn't reach the scale of a true beast tide. This made sense; otherwise, if a large swarm had gathered around the Chi Nan island chain, news would have spread already.</p><p>“Roar! Roar!”</p><p>The roars were deafening, and the pressure from the swarm's advance was stifling.</p><p>Strange and bizarre demonic beasts filled the sky and sea, a dark mass that seemed chaotic but not entirely without organization.  Yao Dan stage beasts were mixed in, and they were the ones commanding the swarm!</p><p>“They’re here!”</p><p>Someone whispered.</p><p>Before the words left their mouth,</p><p>With a ‘boom,’ a huge wave suddenly surged into the air. The treasure ship violently shook, its bow rising high, almost capsizing.</p><p>Leng Qi, with the help of several cultivators, struggled to stabilize the ship.</p><p>Meanwhile, the beasts in the swarm unleashed their attacks. Some spewed demonic light, others used demonic arts, and still others fired their scales and feathers, forming a first wave of assault like a torrential flood.</p><p>The Yao Dan stage beasts in the swarm were mostly a type of blue shark.  Half their bodies were submerged. The previous huge wave was their doing.  Now, they opened their gaping maws, spitting out water spheres, concealing the attacks of the other beasts within.</p><p>The treasure ship was about to be engulfed by the torrent.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The treasure ship's forward momentum suddenly stopped.  A Xuanhuang light flared across the ship's hull.  The ship transformed into a mountain, seemingly weightless, before plunging heavily into the sea.</p><p>A monstrous wave crashed down, submerging the treasure ship and, fortuitously, shielding it from the brunt of the beast horde's attack.</p><p>The crew erupted in cheers.</p><p>The ship's defenses were limited; a direct hit would have likely shattered it.  Thanks to Leng Qi and his crew's skillful maneuvering, however, they emerged unscathed.</p><p>Leng Qi wiped the sweat from his brow and manipulated the ship's formation again.  The vessel, righted itself, absorbing the impact and surging back to the surface. They found themselves surrounded by a sea of monstrous creatures, deep within the heart of the swarm.</p><p>This was their plan: to penetrate the horde. While seemingly trapped, the creatures couldn't coordinate a concentrated assault as before, allowing the humans to leverage their individual strengths.</p><p>The blue sharks roared, their ferocity relentless as they launched wave after wave of attacks against the protective barrier.</p><p>"Kill!"</p><p>A thunderous roar from the crew drowned out the beasts' howls.  Blades flashed, magic surged, and the slaughter began.</p><p>The treasure ship became a grinder in the heart of the beast swarm, consuming countless lives.  The water turned crimson, the stench of blood overwhelming.  Countless limbs and bodies floated on the surface.</p><p>The protective barrier flickered, then finally failed. The ship disintegrated, torn apart by the beasts, but this was expected.  The crew launched themselves into the air, their formation unbroken.</p><p>The tide had turned in their favor.</p><p>Qin Sang sheathed her Snow-Step Blade, summoning ice chains to weave through the beasts, reaping a swathe of destruction with each pass.  Even holding back, her precision and perception as a Yuan Ying cultivator were unmatched, far outpacing her companions.</p><p>Yet, Qin Sang sensed something amiss.  Her attention drifted from the battle, focusing instead on a search.</p><p>And she found it.</p><p>In the rear flank of the beast tide, a large blue shark lay submerged, only its dorsal fin and part of its body visible.  Upon its back sat a hulking man.</p><p>The man was grotesquely ugly, bare-chested, wielding a trident like a sea demon.  Gills adorned his cheeks, revealing him to be a transformed demon.</p><p>As Qin Sang spotted the sea demon, it seemed to sense her presence. Its large eyes narrowed. The shark beneath him, sensing the blood in the water, stirred excitedly, its head surfacing, eyes gleaming with bloodlust.</p><p>*Slap!*</p><p>The sea demon struck the shark, nearly breaking its spine. The shark recoiled, cowering.</p><p>After a moment's observation, the sea demon snorted, raised his trident, and with a whistle, hurled it towards the center of the battle.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>The trident shot like a silver lightning bolt.  Its approach sent a chilling premonition through the fighting cultivators.</p><p>Simultaneously, the beast swarm parted.  The cultivators saw the sea demon and the descending trident, their faces etched with shock.</p><p>"A transformed demon!"</p><p>The cry barely left their lips when a white vapor erupted from the crowd.  The cultivators, momentarily stunned, whirled around.</p><p>Qin Sang looked up at the trident, her hand sweeping across her head.  Her energy coalesced into a massive hand that shot forth, intercepting the trident with breathtaking speed.</p><p>Where the energy hand passed, strange ripples distorted the air.  The trident struck an invisible barrier, its speed abruptly slowing, its glow compressed, revealing the weapon itself.</p><p>The energy hand pressed its advantage, reaching the trident, fingers closing to seize it, to claim the treasure.</p><p>The sea demon puffed out his cheeks, jets of water surging into the trident. With a *hum*, the trident splintered into three, shattering the energy hand.</p><p>At that instant, a sudden chill pierced the sea demon.</p><p>Qin Sang's blade flared, capturing his attention.  The surrounding cultivators shivered.</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>Where the Snow-Step Blade passed, a path of ice formed on the sea's surface, freezing any beast caught unawares.</p><p>The sea demon's face contorted.  He urged his mount, and the shark plunged beneath the waves.</p><p>"Protect them, or you will answer to me!"</p><p>With a chilling command, Qin Sang vanished, chasing after the fleeing demon.  The beast tide, leaderless, scattered, leaving countless corpses in their wake.</p><p>The surviving cultivators finally regained their senses, their eyes turning to the Zhou couple. Recalling Qin Sang's final order, they instinctively formed a protective circle around them.</p><p>Leng Qi stammered, "Zhou Daoists, does Senior Qin have any further instructions?"</p><p>Zhou Jin said gravely, "We return to the Chinan island chain immediately."</p><p>"Yes, yes... we mustn't delay Senior Qin..."</p><p>The others echoed his words.</p>
