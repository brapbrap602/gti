<h1>Chapter 1281: The Battle of Double Mirror Mountain</h1><p>Chapter 1281: The Battle of Double Mirror Mountain</p><p>The moment Qin Sang received the jade hairpin, a soul-stirring roar echoed from within it, resonating deep within her heart.  Without needing Lady Luo's guidance, Qin Sang understood through the incantations and tossed the hairpin into the air.</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>A furious roar erupted. The hairpin transformed into a ball of blue light, circling Qin Sang, sometimes taking the form of a jade hairpin, sometimes a small qilin.</p><p>The two women completed their preparations and emerged from the snow cave.  Lady Luo, disguised as Qin Sang, flew directly to the center of the enemy formation, revealing herself to assist Qing Jun. Qin Sang, swaying with a graceful posture, elegantly flew towards the front lines, ready to lead the low-level cultivators in the initial assault on the Zuoyuan's formation.</p><p>Along the way, unaware of the secret, many of the low-level cultivators, seeing this alluring figure, cast ardent gazes.  Fortunately, the urgency of the battle, and Lady Luo's status as a Yuan Ying master, deterred anyone from daring to approach.  However, encounters with those in the know were inevitable.</p><p>“Uh… Daoist Friend Luo.”</p><p>Jing Lin, aware of their plan, greeted Qin Sang with an odd look, maintaining a composed expression. Yet, upon seeing Qin Sang's alluring smile, he was utterly unnerved and fled as if his life depended on it.</p><p>Qin Sang, her heart numb, flew impassively to the front lines, looking up at the vast sky-lake above, convincing herself that this sacrifice was for the greater good.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>A deafening sound shook Double Mirror Mountain, signaling the commencement of the attack.</p><p>‘Whoosh…whoosh…’</p><p>Countless sharp whistling sounds suddenly filled the battlefield. A torrential gale erupted, swirling snow and obscuring the world in a hazy chaos.</p><p>At the storm's center, the figures of Qing Jun and Lady Luo appeared vaguely.  Around them were other figures and a neatly arranged array of strange wooden plaques.  Each plaque was as large as a door, engraved with peculiar runes, seemingly the source of the gale. On the battlefield, groups of cultivators stood around similar, smaller plaques, their runes glowing, forming a mystical formation. The cultivators chanted incantations, activating the plaques, echoing the actions of Qing Jun and the others.</p><p>All the plaques shone with dazzling light, and spiritual energy surged towards them, intensifying the wind. Weaker cultivators could barely keep their eyes open and struggled to stay on their feet.</p><p>Then, a strange phenomenon occurred.</p><p>The gale reached its peak, revealing gray strands of wind energy in the void – the manifestation of the hurricane's power.  These gray strands began to coalesce.  They merged and consumed each other, forming a gray funnel shape.</p><p>Seeing this, everyone knew the spirit array was about to unleash a terrifying tornado.</p><p>The wind column, restrained in place, took shape rapidly, expanding at an alarming rate. Thick columns of wind pierced the blue waters above, twisting and spinning wildly, sweeping everything from the mountain.  Rocks, snow, dead trees…</p><p>Leaving behind only devastation…</p><p>…</p><p>“The Xun Wind Array! The Two Realms Alliance actually dared to deploy this array.  They're really going all out! We need to find an opportunity to destroy their core array device. Let's see if they can forge another one!”</p><p>On top of Double Mirror Mountain, Zuoyuan's Yuan Ying masters, hidden within their formation, looked down at the mountain. One of them roared ferociously.</p><p>“Huh? Those two… they seem to be the same two who blocked Elder Ye at Blood Lake.”</p><p>One cultivator used secret techniques, vaguely seeing two figures at the formation's center, but the gale quickly obscured their vision, and their divine sense couldn't penetrate. They questioned, “It seems those two are leading the attack on Double Mirror Mountain.  They're awfully cowardly, not personally engaging in the assault. Are there other powerful figures?”</p><p>“Perhaps they're not eager to seize Double Mirror Mountain, but are probing and containing us, while their main force is the army from East Watch City and Stone Curve Mountain.  Maintaining the Xun Wind Array isn't easy. These two were previously unknown, but suddenly rose to prominence. While their treasures are potent, their foundations must be weaker than Elder Ye’s, needing to combine forces to sustain the array…”</p><p>Someone’s guess seemed reasonable.</p><p>“For now, we prioritize defense and observe their intentions. We seek an opportunity to destroy the Xun Wind Array’s core, and await news from Elder Cang Hong!”</p><p>The woman in purple robes made the decision, turning back to personally oversee the formation…</p><p>…</p><p>The hurricane seemed to tear at the very heavens.  The force of the wind reached the summit of Double Mirror Mountain.</p><p>The Sky Lake was disturbed.  Ripples spread, then waves—but strangely, the waves crashed downwards.</p><p>Qin Sang stood amidst the battle array, maintaining a graceful posture, her slender fingers curled around a palm-sized wooden token.  This was the wind token, linked to the power of the Xun Wind Array, ensuring communication and maintaining formation once inside the enemy’s spiritual array, preventing separation and vulnerability to attack.</p><p>The Xun Wind Array was incredibly powerful, one of the strongest arrays forged by the Two Realms Alliance.  Not only was controlling it extremely difficult, but the spiritual stones consumed were astronomical.</p><p>The wind columns grew thicker, showing signs of instability.  Suddenly, all the tokens shone brightly, violently vibrating as if about to shatter.</p><p>For a brief, eerie moment, the battlefield fell silent. Then, all the wind columns shot skyward like spears, aimed at the peak of Double Mirror Mountain!</p><p>The Sky Lake sensed the threat; its waters surged towards the attack, deepening and darkening to a profound, near-black blue.</p><p>But the Xun Wind Array's power was on par with the meticulously laid-out restrictions of the Zu Yuan sect, and under Qing Jun’s precise control, all wind columns focused their attack on a single point.</p><p>Before countless eyes, the columns pierced the Sky Lake unimpeded, sinking deep into the water before an earth-shattering roar erupted.</p><p>*Rumble…*</p><p>The sound was like heavy hammers pounding Double Mirror Mountain, echoing in everyone's hearts. The mountain, standing for countless years, seemed fragile, on the verge of collapse.  The terrifying spectacle filled everyone's eyes—some in terror, others in awe, some in anticipation…</p><p>*Crash!*</p><p>The Xun Wind Array’s power detonated deep within the Sky Lake.  The immense force ripped open the lake's surface; the water surged back, the fissure widening relentlessly.  Through the crack, the Zu Yuan cultivators, poised for battle, were clearly visible, their horrified expressions plain to see.</p><p>The clash of the two arrays reached its peak; the strongest shockwave dissipated, the battle reaching a stalemate, each force consuming and destroying the other.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>A cannon fired.</p><p>Battle cries echoed across the land.  Countless dark figures surged forward from the sloping hillside, charging towards the Sky Lake.</p><p>War was brutal, yet awe-inspiring.  Qin Sang had seen war before, but this was her first time leading troops, at the forefront of such a large-scale battle. Even in the cultivation world, where power was paramount, lower-level cultivators could unleash astonishing energy.</p>
