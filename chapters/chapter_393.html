<h1>Chapter 386: Thirteen Breaths</h1><p>Silence.</p><p>A dark, ghostly claw ripped through the void, causing a sharp pain in Qin Sang's forehead.</p><p>Less than three inches away!</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes widened, fixated on the claw inches from his face.  He could even see the corpse-poison energy flowing through its dark nails.</p><p>He swung his arm forcefully!</p><p>*Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!*</p><p>The Ten Yama Banners left his hand, flying in all directions. The banners unfurled in the wind, growing into man-sized flags, standing tall within the ice palace.</p><p>A strong, eerie wind arose.</p><p>The chilling Yin energy caused the already dim ice palace to lose what little light remained. Coupled with the overwhelming corpse energy emanating from the Flying Night Demon, the ice palace now resembled the eighteenth level of hell.</p><p>However, Qin Sang didn't directly manipulate the Ten Yama Banners to activate the Ten Yama Formation, nor did he choose to activate the Heavenly Corpse Talisman.</p><p>His mind sank into his Qi Sea.</p><p>A jade-like talisman emerged from his dantian.</p><p>The Nine Dragons Chariot Talisman!</p><p>A dragon's roar shook the heavens.</p><p>The talisman shattered, releasing a roaring dragon soul.</p><p>A dragon coiled around his body!</p><p>At this moment, the ghostly claw was less than an inch from his forehead.</p><p>Qin Sang, who had seemed slow against the Flying Night Demon, suddenly became incredibly agile, shifting sideways just in time.</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>The stench of corpse energy filled the air.</p><p>The claw narrowly missed his ear.</p><p>One breath!</p><p>Glancing from the corner of his eye, Qin Sang saw the Flying Night Demon brush past him.  He twisted his body at a strange angle.</p><p>In the next instant, another ghostly claw grazed his chest, tearing his robes to shreds.</p><p>Covered in cold sweat, Qin Sang continued to evade.</p><p>The two figures intertwined in the void, with Qin Sang desperately dodging.</p><p>Suddenly, the ice palace trembled slightly.</p><p>The Flying Night Demon stopped abruptly, turning to stare at the side chamber where Yun Youzi was. Qin Sang knew that Yun Youzi had begun his move and couldn't let the Flying Night Demon be distracted.</p><p>He immediately stopped dodging, channeling his spiritual energy into a sword and attacking.</p><p>Two breaths!</p><p>The Flying Night Demon was enraged, as expected.</p><p>Three breaths!</p><p>Four breaths!</p><p>Relying on the Nine Dragons Chariot Talisman and his understanding of the Flying Night Demon's movements from the previous exchanges, Qin Sang was able to anticipate its attacks and evade with all his might. Gaining these two breaths was already his limit.</p><p>He couldn't push it any further, or he would die!  Qin Sang sighed inwardly.</p><p>Within his mind, his divine sense surged out, locking onto the Heavenly Corpse Talisman inside the Flying Night Demon's head.</p><p>Qin Sang's vision darkened. The Flying Night Demon's grotesque face appeared before him, frozen in time.</p><p>A chilling sensation crept up his throat.</p><p>The demon's claws were about to pierce his skin. It, along with the Flying Night Demon, was momentarily immobilized.</p><p>Qin Sang retreated explosively!</p><p>Five breaths!</p><p>The Dragon Spirit whimpered and retreated back into his Qi Sea.</p><p>At the same time, the eerie wind howled, and ghostfire blazed, burning intensely.</p><p>The ice palace grew even colder, bone-chillingly so!</p><p>The Ten Yama Formation.</p><p>Activated!</p><p>The Heavenly Corpse Talisman's effect lasted only a moment. The Flying Night Demon instantly recovered.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>Countless Yin Soul Threads emerged, madly rushing towards the Flying Night Demon.</p><p>These Yin Soul Threads were different from those formed by the six Ten Yama Banners. They were thicker, and the ghostfire clinging to them was deeper, almost black, like a tangible substance, merging into a sea of flames.</p><p>Resembling flames yet black in color, they were eerily reminiscent of demonic fire born in the deepest abyss, sending chills down one's spine.</p><p>In an instant, the overwhelming Yin Soul Threads swarmed the Flying Night Demon.</p><p>A non-human roar echoed.</p><p>The Flying Night Demon retreated.</p><p>Six breaths!</p><p>*Whoosh…*</p><p>For the first time, Qin Sang clearly sensed strong emotions in the Flying Night Demon's dark eyes: rage, killing intent, fury…</p><p>And a hint of fear.</p><p>As expected of a living corpse. It stared at the black sea of fire and the countless threads, wary from being burned by the Yin Soul Threads and the black fire. It hesitated.</p><p>Seven breaths!</p><p>Eight breaths!</p><p>The Flying Night Demon vanished abruptly, only to be forced out by the black fire.</p><p>Scorched by the Yin Soul Threads, it roared in pain, yet its momentum didn't falter. Its eyes were fixed on Qin Sang. A black blade, formed from a spell, suddenly appeared before it.</p><p>The Flying Night Demon wielded the black blade, tearing through the Yin Soul Threads and breaking through the black fire as if it were dry brush.</p><p>Nine breaths!</p><p>At the same time, two dark figures stealthily entered the ice palace from the entrance, one on the left and one on the right.</p><p>This was the moment.</p><p>Qin Sang split off a strand of his divine sense, ordering the two refined corpses to charge towards the side chamber.</p><p>"Transform into a ghost!"</p><p>Qin Sang's focus remained entirely on the Ten Yama Formation.  His hand seals changed rapidly. The Yin Soul Threads suddenly dispersed, and the main spirits of the banners roared, merging into a single ferocious ghost, which stood before Qin Sang, fearlessly facing the charging Flying Night Demon.</p><p>*Bang! Bang! Bang!*</p><p>Ten breaths!</p><p>Eleven breaths!</p><p>After a series of heavy blows, the ghost, fighting fearlessly, was shattered by the Flying Night Demon. The main spirits of the Yama Banners screamed and dissipated into black smoke, unable to re-form for a short period.</p><p>The Flying Night Demon charged forward.</p><p>The brief exchange had severely drained Qin Sang, leaving him pale.</p><p>However, he had bought enough time.</p><p>A satisfied smile appeared on his face. He swallowed a few spirit pills he had kept hidden in his mouth, recovering some of his spiritual energy. He waved his hand, withdrawing the Ten Yama Formation. The Dragon Spirit reappeared, and he turned to flee.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>The two figures crossed paths once more.</p><p>Qin Sang desperately dodged the Flying Night Demon's sneak attack. The demon brushed past him, unexpectedly colliding with the Living Corpse that had just entered.</p><p>The Flying Night Demon's movements were beyond Qin Sang's control. It was the Living Corpse's misfortune.</p><p>However, he only needed one of the Living Corpse or the Malignant Corpse to reach the side chamber.</p><p>Qin Sang immediately abandoned the Living Corpse, ordering it to attack the Flying Night Demon as if sending it to its death.</p><p>*Thud!*</p><p>A fist shot out like lightning.</p><p>Just as the Living Corpse was about to be obliterated by the Flying Night Demon, a scene that astonished Qin Sang unfolded.</p><p>For some unknown reason, the Flying Night Demon's fist froze before the Living Corpse, and a human-like struggle appeared on its face.</p><p>It couldn't bring itself to deliver the blow!</p><p>Then, the Flying Night Demon roared and, surprisingly, abandoned the Living Corpse, appearing beside the Malignant Corpse not far away.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The Malignant Corpse's head exploded.</p><p>Twelve breaths!</p><p>What happened?</p><p>Why did the Flying Night Demon spare the Living Corpse but show no mercy to the Malignant Corpse?</p><p>Qin Sang was utterly bewildered. The biggest difference between a Malignant Corpse and a Living Corpse was the Heavenly Corpse Talisman, but the *Heavenly Yin Corpse Scripture* mentioned nothing like this.</p><p>While a Living Corpse was still a corpse, its essence was no different from a Malignant Corpse. It was a tool of slaughter.  There was no such thing as corpses sharing a moment of empathy.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't understand, but the situation didn't allow him to dwell on it.</p><p>The Flying Night Demon, having destroyed the Malignant Corpse, vanished once more.</p><p>Qin Sang instantly sensed something behind him, a feeling of dread washing over him.</p><p>As expected, the Flying Night Demon, once again ignoring the Living Corpse, was coming for him. Without hesitation, Qin Sang ordered the Living Corpse to rush into the side chamber while he retreated.</p><p>Only three breaths remained.</p><p>Not difficult.</p>
