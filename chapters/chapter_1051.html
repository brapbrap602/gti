<h1>Chapter 143: Success</h1><p>It's hard to imagine.</p><p>Even Heavenly Thunder can feel like being torn apart.</p><p>A palm print ripped through the lightning.</p><p>Venerable Ye appeared, his expression grim, his killing intent surging.</p><p>On the hand that tore the lightning, he wore a white glove woven like silk, thin and delicate, with a galaxy etched on the back and the sun and moon held in the palm.</p><p>This was a rare treasure, likely not from this era.</p><p>A galaxy swirled around his palm, the sun and moon shone brightly, and the lightning, repelled, couldn't get close.</p><p>His body was scorched black, his skin clearly marked by the Lightning Manipulation Art, but it didn't look as bad as imagined.</p><p>However, these were just superficial appearances.</p><p>Venerable Ye had broken his seal again, forcibly using the treasure to escape, paying a price unimaginable to ordinary people, invisible to the naked eye.</p><p>His eyes were like knives, fixed on Qin Sang.</p><p>"The old fox had a backup plan after all!"</p><p>Qin Sang was shocked and angry.</p><p>Under Venerable Ye's gaze, he felt a chill down his spine.</p><p>Seeing the dazzling escape light around Qin Sang, a strange glint flashed in Venerable Ye's eyes. With his remaining strength, he pushed off the ground with a powerful step, pursuing Qin Sang at an even greater speed.</p><p>Another heart-stopping chase unfolded within the cavern.</p><p>One side possessed exceptional escape techniques, no wonder they dared to steal treasure from a Nascent Soul cultivator.</p><p>The other, seemingly without refined escape techniques, was even faster.</p><p>The distance between them rapidly closed.</p><p>The wind howled behind him, and Qin Sang's scalp tingled.</p><p>Finally, Qin Sang reached the cave entrance, where Ming Wei was waiting for him.</p><p>Without hesitation, he rushed into the cave, quickly forming hand seals as he went.</p><p>*Whoosh! Whoosh!*</p><p>Demon banners sprang up from the ground.</p><p>They had been hidden for a long time, finally coming into play.</p><p>In an instant, the banners formed an array, and the Nine Nether Demon Fire surged forth, its flames raging.</p><p>"Go!"</p><p>Before the demon fire could fully coalesce, Qin Sang completed his seals and directed it behind him.</p><p>Then, grabbing all the demon banners, he rushed deeper into the cave and saw Ming Wei's anxious face.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>The Nine Nether Demon Fire erupted from the cave.</p><p>Venerable Ye, close behind, bore the brunt of it.</p><p>Seeing the overwhelming Nine Nether Demon Fire and sensing its aura, Venerable Ye was first stunned, then his expression changed drastically, and he cried out, "True Demon Flame!"</p><p>He stopped abruptly, holding the hand with the treasure across his chest, fully activating it for protection, seemingly extremely wary of the Nine Nether Demon Fire.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The demon fire collided with the palm print.</p><p>Rocks tumbled, and flames flew.</p><p>The palm print dimmed, the galaxy shattered, the sun and moon lost their light, and the treasure on Venerable Ye's hand melted like ice and snow, having been used twice and now nearing exhaustion.</p><p>Amidst the chaotic scene, Venerable Ye's furious roar echoed.</p><p>"All show and no substance! Not the true True Demon Flame!"</p><p>Ignoring the cost, he urged the remaining power of the treasure, breaking through the Nine Nether Demon Fire blockade, only to find the cave empty.</p><p>Ming Wei, following Qin Sang's instructions, had been waiting at the cave entrance.</p><p>She witnessed Venerable Ye's attack, dispelling any doubts about Qin Sang's words.  Instead, she began to worry whether he would act, whether he would succeed, and whether he would obtain the Soul Cleansing Liquid and share a bottle with her as agreed.</p><p>Then, she saw Qin Sang boldly make his move.</p><p>Lightning techniques, corpse refinement, spirit beasts, escape arts, one after another, he snatched the Soul Cleansing Liquid and nearly took Venerable Ye's life.</p><p>As expected, a Nascent Soul ancestor was not easy to deal with.</p><p>Ming Wei knew her responsibility was crucial. She immediately retreated, activating the Life Talisman, and waited for Qin Sang's return.</p><p>Their eyes met.</p><p>Seeing that Ming Wei hadn't deserted, Qin Sang relaxed, a slight smile appearing on his face.</p><p>At this moment, a wave of emptiness washed over him.</p><p>Activating the nine demon banner array had drained every bit of true essence he had just recovered with the spirit pills. Fortunately, this true essence was enough to fuel the Nine Nether Demon Fire for one attack, otherwise, he would have been forced to consume another drop of Three Light Jade Liquid.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang arrive, Ming Wei's excitement was barely concealed. She immediately activated the Life Talisman.</p><p>The Life Talisman glowed faintly, and a complex ancient character, representing 'life,' appeared on its surface.  A gentle light then transformed into a halo, falling upon them both.</p><p>Finally, Qin Sang ordered the Corpse Devil to sprint deeper into the cave, and Ming Wei also set up some traps. Then, they both vanished.</p><p>â€¦</p><p>Deep within the cave, the Corpse Devil and the puppets created chaos.  Various auras mixed within the tunnels, making it impossible to track.</p><p>Venerable Ye stood at the cave entrance, his search fruitless.</p><p>Just then, the elder with the long beard and the others finally caught up.</p><p>Unaware of the final situation, they all looked at Venerable Ye, hesitant to speak.  Noticing their master's expression, they grew more uneasy.</p><p>Their master had destroyed a treasure and forcibly broken his seal, yet he hadn't managed to stop the thief?</p><p>Three bottles of Soul Cleansing Liquid, just snatched away like that?</p><p>"Master, what do we do now?"</p><p>The elder with the long beard asked softly, gesturing behind him, a hint of worry in his eyes.</p><p>The cultivators in the cavern were all shrewd.</p><p>Initially deterred by the gruesome fate of Blood Bat and the others, they didn't dare to compete with a Nascent Soul cultivator.  After Qin Sang acted, the situation changed drastically, and they didn't dare to move, the confrontation ending before they could react.</p><p>Now, they were gradually realizing what had happened.</p><p>In the Trial Realm, Nascent Soul ancestors weren't so terrifying.</p><p>Three bottles of Soul Cleansing Liquid had been taken by Qin Sang, their whereabouts unknown, but there was still one bottle, snatched by the charming woman.</p><p>Malicious gazes fell upon the charming woman and her companions, and the crowd began to stir, slowly encircling them.</p><p>Abandoning one bottle of Soul Cleansing Liquid was a decision Qin Sang and Bai had discussed.</p><p>If necessary, they were willing to discard even more.</p><p>Helping them escape was only one reason.</p><p>If Qin Sang took all four bottles, the others would have no reason to fight.</p><p>Seeing no opportunity, even if the other cultivators realized Venerable Ye's weakness, they wouldn't make things difficult for him and might even unite against a common enemy, searching for Qin Sang together.</p><p>If Venerable Ye persisted, it would be troublesome if he discovered anything.</p><p>Now, sacrificing one bottle of Soul Cleansing Liquid made Venerable Ye and his group the target. If they could force Venerable Ye, their greatest enemy, away, Qin Sang and Ming Wei would be much safer. It was definitely a worthwhile trade.</p><p>"Give me the Soul Cleansing Liquid."</p><p>Venerable Ye said to the charming woman.</p><p>The charming woman bit her lip, unwilling, but meeting Venerable Ye's gaze, she was startled and quickly handed over the Soul Cleansing Liquid.</p><p>"Let's go!"</p><p>Venerable Ye glanced back, his eyes icy, causing the encircling cultivators to flinch.</p><p>"Master, are we just going to let this go?"</p><p>The burly man was very unwilling. The Soul Cleansing Liquid was crucial for Nascent Soul formation, a once-in-a-century opportunity!</p><p>"Hmph! The techniques that person used are not something ordinary people possess. His plan was meticulous. If it weren't for me, he probably would have taken all the Soul Cleansing Liquid.  These secret techniques couldn't have been created out of thin air.  Mobilize the Merchant Alliance, and it won't be difficult to find out his identity.  Then, we'll make him pay back with interest!"</p><p>Venerable Ye said coldly, sweeping into a tunnel.</p><p>Su Nu was secretly curious, unsure how Qin Sang had escaped the pursuit.  Her tense nerves finally relaxed.</p>
