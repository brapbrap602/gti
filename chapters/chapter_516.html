<h1>Chapter 509: A Side Project</h1><p>In truth, none of the four had ever met Patriarch Jiupao in person. This was the first time the Demonic Flame Sect's leader had appeared publicly.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded slightly, his gaze sweeping over each of them.  He had already gained a thorough understanding of their temperaments. Patriarch Jiupao had been lying low, his demonic nature yet to be revealed. Though the Demonic Flame Sect bore the "Demonic" title, its disciples seemed unaffected, indistinguishable from those of ordinary cultivation sects.</p><p>Among the four, Mei Gu was the most amiable and held the highest prestige within the sect.</p><p>"Rise," Qin Sang said, not wanting to linger.  He got straight to the point, "I've come to summon your Senior Brother Luo and the others for an important mission down the mountain. It's uncertain when we'll return. You four will remain to guard the sect. In my absence, Mei Gu will act as the sect leader, assisted by the other three…"</p><p>The four were taken aback by this unexpected news.</p><p>Regardless of their thoughts, Qin Sang issued his commands and made the necessary arrangements, leaving no room for objection.</p><p>Patriarch Jiupao had left behind a solid foundation.</p><p>Both the mountain's spiritual veins and the protective formation were excellent, requiring no further adjustments.</p><p>"After I leave, your priority is to cultivate and strengthen the sect. Continue as you have been. The protective formation is sufficient to ensure your safety. Remember, during your travels, avoid any perverse actions that might bring enemies to our sect. Otherwise, I will personally punish you…"</p><p>Qin Sang snorted, a bolt of lightning flashing from his brow accompanied by a deafening thunderclap. Sword Qi, like a cascading waterfall, enveloped the four!</p><p>The killing intent of the sword Qi shook their souls.</p><p>The full power of the magical treasure erupted. Overwhelmed by the Ebony Sword's aura, the four were terrified. They couldn't have imagined that beneath the black robe was merely a fake Core Formation cultivator, using his natal flying sword to feign strength.</p><p>This display left an indelible mark on them.</p><p>When Qin Sang withdrew the Ebony Sword, the sword Qi dissipated.</p><p>The four were drenched in cold sweat, as if they had been pulled from a river. Lu Xing and the others were visibly trembling.</p><p>"We dare not!"</p><p>…</p><p>Looking at the trembling four, Qin Sang softened his tone slightly.</p><p>He had no intention of truly leading a sect.  With his limited talent and precarious situation, he wouldn't divert his focus. He wouldn't invest any extra energy into the Demonic Flame Sect.</p><p>This was merely a side project for him.</p><p>Perhaps useful, perhaps not.</p><p>Patriarch Jiupao had poured his heart and soul into establishing this foundation, and it was now flourishing. Since there were no hidden dangers, it seemed a waste to destroy it all.</p><p>The Demonic Flame Sect was still weak. Its future development depended entirely on them.</p><p>Of course, since Qin Sang had intervened, he would leave his mark before departing.  He couldn't have the disciples only knowing the acting leader and not the true one.</p><p>"Summon all disciples under fifty who have broken through the tenth level of Qi Refining…" Qin Sang instructed Mei Gu.</p><p>"Yes, Master!"  Mei Gu's demeanor was far more composed than the others as she left to carry out the order.</p><p>Soon, all eligible disciples were gathered. Qin Sang distributed some of his recent spoils, personally bestowing a high-grade magical artifact upon each as encouragement.</p><p>Mei Gu and the others received top-grade magical artifacts.</p><p>Though they were ordinary top-grade artifacts, they still thrilled Mei Gu and the others.</p><p>Finally, after dismissing the other disciples, Qin Sang spoke privately with Mei Gu for a while, left her some items, and departed.</p><p>Upon descending the Earth Volcano, Qin Sang put the Demonic Flame Sect out of his mind. He hadn't lingered there long, giving him more time to prepare for his infiltration of the Azure Yang Demonic Sect, which was his true objective.</p><p>Returning to the cave, Qin Sang sat down on a rock and opened the Corpse Puppet Pouch. Fourteen bodies lay in a row before him.</p><p>Soul-Guiding Grass was rare, and Qin Sang only had two Heavenly Corpse Talismans left. Unwilling to waste them on these corpses, he killed them all. The two Core Formation cultivators he intended to refine into Malignant Corpses for his own use.</p><p>The remaining twelve would be mostly turned into zombies, with a few becoming Malignant Corpses.</p><p>Qin Sang's plan to infiltrate the Azure Yang Demonic Sect was intertwined with these corpses. He planned to take them to Azure Yang Market City and sell them to the Azure Yang Demonic Sect disciples!</p><p>Malignant Corpses were too conspicuous; he couldn't have too many.</p><p>Zombies were fine. Their strength was equivalent to Qi Refining cultivators. The Heavenly Corpse Sect's zombie refinement methods weren't vastly different from other corpse refining sects, but they utilized a wisp of Earthly Yin Qi for rapid refinement.</p><p>While the Azure Yang Demonic Sect wasn't as bloodthirsty and unrestrained as some other demonic sects, being in demonic territory, they had become desensitized to certain things.</p><p>Demonic corpse refinement techniques weren't uncommon, and the trade of corpses and refined corpses was commonplace. The Azure Yang Demonic Sect wouldn't overly restrict its disciples from purchasing zombies for self-defense.</p><p>However, with the current volatile situation, the Azure Yang Demonic Sect was very cautious. Qin Sang wasn't sure if they would allow disciples to bring corpses of unknown origin into the mountain gate.</p><p>These refined corpses were his test.</p><p>If they could enter the Azure Yang Demonic Sect, so could he!</p><p>Having obtained the *Heavenly Yin Corpse Manual*, Qin Sang was now a Core Formation cultivator. He'd never refined a zombie before, but he was already proficient in refining Malignant Corpses, so zombies wouldn't be a problem.</p><p>Qin Sang selected a cultivator, destroyed his dantian, erased the traces of his Core Formation cultivation, then drew in Yin Sha Qi and began carving corpse refining restrictions onto his body.</p><p>The restrictions were completed effortlessly.</p><p>Next, he retrieved the prepared beast soul and Earthly Yin Qi.</p><p>This step required caution, but it didn't pose a challenge to Qin Sang.  He methodically completed each step until the zombie was refined.</p><p>*Thump!*</p><p>Qin Sang caught the zombie's punch with one hand and assessed its strength.</p><p>This zombie was comparable to a cultivator at the eleventh level of Qi Refining.</p><p>A zombie refined from a Core Formation cultivator's corpse would have the strength of at least a tenth level Qi Refining cultivator. Qin Sang deliberately controlled the discrepancies to avoid suspicion from identical zombie strength.</p><p>Then, he channeled corpse Qi throughout the zombie's body, completely destroying its former appearance, transforming it into a true zombie with a green face and fangs.</p><p>Qin Sang spent two days in the cave, refining all the corpses into zombies and Malignant Corpses.  He stored them all in the Corpse Puppet Pouch and set off for Azure Yang City.</p><p>…</p><p>With the Spirit Tide in full swing, Azure Yang City and Heavenly Gloom Pass were sealed.</p><p>Many cultivators gathered outside the two passes, waiting for the Spirit Tide to recede so they could be the first to enter the Ancient Immortal Battlefield to search for treasures.  Gathering information here was also convenient.</p><p>With so many cultivators gathered at the two passes, auctions were constantly being held, with rare treasures frequently appearing. Surely, the Azure Yang Demonic Sect's leader wouldn't ignore these temptations?</p><p>Qin Sang, under the alias Qingfeng Daoist, mingled amongst the crowd. He learned that neither at Heavenly Gloom Pass nor Azure Yang City had the Azure Yang Demonic Sect's leader been seen.</p><p>It seemed the sect leader was playing it safe.</p><p>Qin Sang frowned inwardly. He had no choice but to wait patiently. After meeting up with Wandering Scholar, they each staked out one of the major passes, biding their time.</p>
