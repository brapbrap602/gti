<h1>Chapter 1553: The Patrolling Yaksha</h1><p>The commotion outside drew the attention of the cultivators within the cabin.  They rushed out, assuming they had encountered enemies.</p><p>It was merely a newly awakened lesser demon.</p><p>Such lesser demons were not uncommon in the outer sea.  Having sailed for many days, everyone had long grown accustomed to them and paid no attention.  Seeing Zhou Jin's actions, they were somewhat puzzled.</p><p>Zhou Jin conjured a palm of True Essence, seized the fish demon's head, and squeezed forcefully.  The fish demon let out a pained whimper, its body convulsing.  Suddenly, its skull cracked open, and a rice-yellow pearl flew out.</p><p>The pearl shimmered with a faint yellow light, and within it, a shadow writhed.</p><p>Zhou Jin was just about to grab the pearl.</p><p>*Crack!*  The shadowy form within suddenly collided, and the pearl exploded into powder.</p><p>In the instant of the pearl's self-destruction, a distinct fluctuation, not belonging to the fish demon, flashed and vanished.</p><p>"Hiss..."</p><p>Everyone who sensed that fluctuation changed color.</p><p>All present, the lowest in cultivation being Foundation Establishment stage, were well-informed and immediately realized something.  The more perceptive ones directly summoned their magical tools and treasures.</p><p>Someone flew into the air, scanning the surroundings.</p><p>"Someone is controlling the fish demon?"</p><p>The others looked at Qin Sang.</p><p>The fish demon was the first thing they had discovered, and Qin Sang was clearly the leader among the three.</p><p>Qin Sang narrowed his eyes slightly and said indifferently, "This humble Daoist didn't pay attention at first, but after entering this sea region, we encountered the same type of fish demon multiple times, which aroused my suspicion.  Now it seems that this fish demon was definitely controlled artificially.  As for whether it's a human or a demon behind it, it's still uncertain. However, this control method doesn't seem like a human technique."</p><p>"Fellow Daoist means this is a scout of a high-rank demonic beast?  Why would a high-rank demonic beast set up a hidden stake here?"</p><p>A commotion stirred on the ship, and someone exclaimed in alarm.</p><p>Someone who knows how to utilize spies, and with such secretive methods...</p><p>Could it be that they had inadvertently stumbled into the territory of some Transformation stage great demon? Which Transformation stage great demon would choose to establish their cave dwelling so close to the inner sea?</p><p>Qin Sang's thoughts also raced.</p><p>A high-rank demonic beast controlling fish demons to monitor this sea area… could there really be some secret here?</p><p>If he was mistaken and it was a cultivator controlling the fish demon, it was even more worth pondering.</p><p>At this moment, the person who flew into the air returned to the ship. Facing everyone's inquiring gazes, he shook his head helplessly, having found no unusual signs.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Leng, there are only a few places left unvisited. I don't see the need to go there.  This place is not suitable for a long stay.  We should quickly return to the Chi'nan Island Chain, observe the situation, and make further plans. What do you all think?"</p><p>A monk proposed a retreat.</p><p>Most people on the ship's true purpose wasn't treasure hunting. No one wanted to throw their lives away investigating information, so they quickly reached a consensus.</p><p>The ship tilted, changed direction, and returned to the Chi'nan Island Chain.</p><p>Everyone took turns keeping watch.</p><p>Qin Sang was not in a hurry to leave the group with the Zhou couple.  The situation was unclear, and the opponent's purpose and location were unknown.  Exposing their identities at this time might lead to more variables.</p><p>No one lacked spirit stones, so they set the ship's speed to its maximum.</p><p>At first,</p><p>they sped for the time it took an incense stick to burn.</p><p>The sea remained calm, and everything was normal.</p><p>Just as everyone thought they had escaped danger, Qin Sang's expression suddenly shifted. His eyes flashed with sharp light, his divine sense stirred, and an ice blade swam into his palm, its blade light silently extending and retracting.</p><p>This blade was named the Tread Snow Divine Blade, one of the few magical treasures recorded in the *Qingwei Record*.</p><p>The most supreme one was Yin Changsheng's Suspended Sword Pavilion, but its refinement was too difficult. After weighing his options, Qin Sang chose one of the easiest to refine—the Tread Snow Divine Blade.</p><p>Qin Sang's positioning for his avatar was still as support and a backup for resurrection.  At least until his main body was prepared to break through to the Deity Transformation stage, he didn't plan to invest too much energy into it.</p><p>He used Yin Dianzhu's relics, along with some of the gains from helping Tong Lingyu control the Xuantian Palace, to refine the blade embryo for his avatar. His avatar had nurtured it until now, and it finally matured into a blade not long ago.</p><p>In terms of quality alone, it was slightly inferior to the Golden Sink Sword, which Qin Sang had refined multiple times, but it was more compatible with his avatar.</p><p>In addition, the avatar had achieved minor accomplishment in the *Xuantian One Qi Great Capture Hand*.</p><p>The *Ice Soul Divine Light* had not progressed for a long time and was basically semi-abandoned.</p><p>Qin Sang now deeply understood how difficult this divine ability was, and why the Listen Snow Pavilion had declined.</p><p>Although he was cultivating the version improved by Liu Li, and had refined Ice Soul Gang Ying, the divine ability was incompatible with him, making it as difficult as ascending to heaven.  He had no choice but to switch to cultivating the *Xuantian One Qi Great Capture Hand*.</p><p>The Four Serpent Seal, the Tread Snow Divine Blade, and the *Xuantian One Qi Great Capture Hand*.</p><p>With these methods at his disposal, he could put up a fight even against a Grand Cultivator. Treasures were valuable in their quality, not quantity, so the avatar returned the Golden Sink Sword and the Sun God Tree to his main body.</p><p>Soon, others also noticed the anomaly.</p><p>*Splash!*</p><p>The treasure ship stopped abruptly, and the scene ahead made everyone gasp.</p><p>A dark cloud appeared on the horizon, blotting out the sky and sun. Demonic Qi surged towards them.</p><p>Looking closely, they realized it was a demonic cloud formed by countless demonic beasts.  A horde of beasts had formed here at some unknown time, precisely intercepting their return path, encircling them.</p><p>No one believed this was a coincidence.</p><p>"Beast Tide!"</p><p>Someone cried out.</p><p>If it were just a beast tide formed by low-rank demonic beasts, it wouldn't be difficult for the cultivators on the ship to join forces and break through.</p><p>However, at this moment, they sensed auras that could threaten them from within the beast horde, clearly indicating the presence of high-rank demonic beasts at the Core Formation stage!</p><p>Only when the beast horde appeared did the roars of the demonic beasts finally ring out.</p><p>It was evident that these demonic beasts were well-trained and definitely controlled by a great demon with awakened sentience.</p><p>The demonic races of the East Sea had also been drawn here.</p><p>Even without the ruins of an ancient Immortal Sect, there was definitely an unknown secret here. However, what they cared about now wasn't this, but how to escape!</p><p>"Senior Qin, what should we do?"</p><p>Zhou Jin and Ruan Yu stayed close to Qin Sang's side.</p><p>With Qin Sang present, they weren't as nervous, but they also worried that there might be a Transformation stage Demon King behind the beast horde, and Qin Sang wouldn't be able to protect them then.</p><p>"Wait and see."</p><p>Qin Sang gripped the Tread Snow Divine Blade, poised to strike. With his other hand, he flicked a finger, shooting out a streak of cold light, summoning an inconspicuous ice chain.</p><p>At the same time,</p><p>the treasure ship's protective formation was activated at full power.</p><p>The formation formed a light barrier, enveloping the ship, but in the face of the beast tide, it appeared extremely thin and fragile.</p><p>"Everyone, today we can only break through by joining forces!  If we fight separately and are surrounded by the beast horde, there's no need for me to elaborate on the consequences."</p><p>Leng Qi shouted in a deep voice.</p><p>Naturally, everyone understood this reasoning and dared not conceal their methods any longer.</p><p>For a time, treasures glowed on everyone's bodies.</p><p>Various divine abilities and magical treasures emerged endlessly, encompassing Buddhist, Demonic, and Ghostly Dao, everything imaginable.</p><p>"Drum God Wind!  So it's a fellow Daoist from the Yuanfeng Sect.  Legend has it that the Drum God Wind, once unleashed, can corrode flesh and bones. It truly lives up to its reputation!"</p><p>One person summoned a pouch-like magical treasure, spewing out a gust of green divine wind, which surrounded his body, making his figure blurry.  As soon as the treasure appeared, it was recognized by someone beside him.</p><p>The person remained impassive, glancing at the armor on the other person's body.  "My Drum God Wind is probably unable to break through the Hun Yuan Sect's Hun Yuan Armor."</p><p>The other person's expression faltered slightly, and he gave a dry laugh.</p><p>Similar conversations occurred frequently.</p><p>Everyone's actions remained unaffected.  Knowing the origins and divine abilities of their companions, they were even more confident. Their roles were clearly defined; some helped Leng Qi strengthen the treasure ship's defenses, while others poised themselves, preparing to deliver a head-on blow to the beast horde.</p><p>The ice chain formed a loop, suspended above Qin Sang's head.</p><p>Zhou Jin continued to control the jade ring, standing ready.</p><p>A layer of fine gauze surrounded Ruan Yu, protecting her from harm.</p><p>The beast horde gradually approached.</p><p>Everyone could see the full picture.</p><p>The number of demonic beasts wasn't as many as imagined, not quite reaching the scale of a beast tide.  This made sense; otherwise, the gathering of a large beast tide around the Chi'nan Island Chain would have definitely spread rumors long ago.</p><p>"Roar! Roar!"</p><p>Roars thundered like lightning, and the pressure brought by the beast horde's charge made it hard to breathe.</p><p>Bizarre and varied demonic beasts filled the sky and sea, a dense, dark mass.  They seemed like a disorganized mob, but they weren't entirely without order.</p><p>Core Formation stage demonic beasts were mixed within, and it was they who were commanding the beast horde!</p><p>"They're coming!"</p><p>Someone whispered.</p><p>Before the words finished,</p><p>*Boom!* a massive wave suddenly surged into the air.  The treasure ship trembled violently, its front rising high, soaring into the sky, almost capsizing.</p><p>With the help of several cultivators, Leng Qi exerted all his effort to keep the treasure ship stable.</p><p>At the same time, the demonic beasts in the beast tide unleashed their attacks. Some spat demonic light, some used demonic arts, and some shot out scales or feathers from their bodies, converging into the first wave of attack, like a torrential flood.</p><p>The Core Formation stage demonic beasts in the beast horde were mostly a type of blue shark.</p><p>Half of their bodies were submerged underwater.  The massive wave just now was created by them.  Now, they all opened their bloody maws, spitting out water spheres that concealed the attacks of other demonic beasts.</p><p>Seeing that the treasure ship was about to be engulfed by the flood,</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>The treasure ship's forward momentum suddenly stopped.  A mysterious yellow light flashed on the ship's body, transforming it into a mountain. It fell heavily, as if weightless, plunging into a deep trench in the sea.</p><p>The massive wave crashed down with a *slap*.  The treasure ship was driven into the seabed, but it also avoided the beast horde's strongest attack because of this.</p><p>Everyone cheered.</p><p>The treasure ship's defensive capabilities were limited. If it had taken the attack directly, it would probably be on the verge of collapse by now.  Under the control of Leng Qi and the others, they had turned decay into magic, and everyone remained unharmed.</p><p>Leng Qi wiped the cold sweat from his forehead, controlling the formation on the treasure ship to change again.</p><p>The treasure ship swayed, dissipating the impact, and surged back to the surface, only to find themselves surrounded by overwhelming demonic beasts, having already charged into the heart of the beast horde.</p><p>This was precisely their planned strategy.  By entering the beast horde, they appeared to be surrounded, but in reality, the beast horde could no longer organize the same powerful attack as before, while they could leverage the advantages of their individual strength.</p><p>Those blue sharks let out furious roars.  The demonic beasts were fearless of death, charging forward relentlessly, frantically assaulting the protective light barrier.</p><p>"Kill!"</p><p>Everyone shouted in unison, their momentum soaring, even overwhelming the roars of the demonic beasts.</p><p>Blade lights and sword glows, various divine abilities unleashed, a massacre began.</p><p>The treasure ship became a meat grinder in the center of the beast horde, devouring countless lives.</p><p>In an instant, the seawater changed color, the stench of blood pungent, all the blood of demonic beasts.  Countless severed limbs and broken bodies floated on the sea surface.</p><p>The protective light barrier flickered, finally unable to hold on any longer.</p><p>The treasure ship disintegrated with a resounding crash, torn to shreds by the beast horde.  Everyone had anticipated this, rising into the air one after another, their formation remaining unbroken.</p><p>The current situation was advantageous to them.</p><p>Qin Sang also pressed down on the Tread Snow Divine Blade, controlling the ice chain, weaving back and forth within the beast horde.  Every place he passed, he harvested a swathe of demonic beasts.</p><p>After all, he was a Nascent Soul cultivator. Even while holding back his power, he could still deliver impressive performance with precise control and keen perception, his efficiency far exceeding others.</p><p>Qin Sang always felt that it wouldn't be this simple.  His mind wasn't on the battlefield, but rather on searching everywhere.</p><p>Sure enough, he discovered an anomaly!</p><p>Diagonally behind the beast tide, in the distance, a blue shark lay quietly beneath the sea surface, revealing its dorsal fin and part of its body.  A burly man sat astride the blue shark.</p><p>The burly man had an ugly appearance, bare-chested, wielding a steel fork, like a patrolling yaksha.  His gills were still fish-like, clearly a Transformation stage great demon.</p><p>At the same time Qin Sang discovered the patrolling yaksha,</p><p>the patrolling yaksha seemed to have sensed something as well, his bell-like eyes narrowing.  The blue shark beneath him smelled the blood and moved excitedly, its head emerging from the water, its eyes revealing a bloodthirsty glint.</p><p>*Slap!*</p><p>The patrolling yaksha slapped the blue shark, almost breaking its spine.  The blue shark cried out in pain and subsided, not daring to move recklessly.</p><p>After gazing at the battlefield for a moment, the patrolling yaksha snorted coldly.  He raised the steel fork with one hand, whistled, aimed at the center of the beast horde, and hurled it fiercely.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>The steel fork transformed into a silver-white lightning bolt.</p><p>The sound of it piercing through the air boomed like thunder.</p><p>Before the attack arrived, the cultivators engaged in fierce battle felt a sense of heart-pounding fear, greatly alarmed.</p><p>At the same time, the beast horde suddenly parted to the sides.</p><p>Only then did everyone see the patrolling yaksha in the distance, and the steel fork descending from the sky, their expressions filled with horror.</p><p>"Transformation stage great demon!"</p><p>The cries of alarm had just rung out</p><p>when a white Qi suddenly soared into the air from within the crowd.</p><p>Everyone was still in a state of panic, stunned for a moment, before turning their heads abruptly.</p><p>Qin Sang looked up at the steel fork, swiping his hand over his head.  Xuan Qi transformed into a giant hand, reaching out through the air, grabbing towards the steel fork with a speed no less impressive.</p><p>Wherever the Xuan Qi giant hand passed, strange fluctuations appeared in the void.</p><p>The steel fork, facing the palm directly, encountered an invisible barrier, its speed suddenly decreasing drastically, its light also compressed, revealing the steel fork's true form.</p><p>The Xuan Qi giant hand pressed its advantage, rushing in front of the steel fork, its five fingers closing, as if it intended to grab the steel fork directly and seize the treasure.</p><p>The patrolling yaksha puffed out his cheeks, two streams of water spraying from his gills, merging into the steel fork.  After a humming sound, the steel fork split into three, shaking off the Xuan Qi giant hand.</p><p>Just at this moment, the patrolling yaksha suddenly felt a chilling intent.</p><p>The blade light in Qin Sang's hand erupted, firmly capturing the patrolling yaksha's attention.</p><p>The surrounding cultivators also couldn't help but shiver.</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>Wherever the Tread Snow Divine Blade passed, it left a trail of snow on the sea surface. The demonic beasts along the path, unable to dodge in time, were frozen into ice sculptures.</p><p>The patrolling yaksha's expression changed drastically. He squeezed his legs forcefully, and the blue shark dove into the seabed.</p><p>"Protect them well, or this humble Daoist will hold you accountable!"</p><p>Qin Sang left behind a cold shout, his figure flashing repeatedly, treading snow as he departed.</p><p>With the Demon King fleeing, the beast horde naturally couldn't maintain its formation, the demonic beasts scattering in all directions, leaving behind countless corpses.</p><p>Only then did everyone recover their senses, looking towards the Zhou couple, their expressions varied.  Recalling Qin Sang's order before leaving, they unanimously surrounded and protected them.</p><p>Leng Qi forced a smile, "Fellow Daoist Zhou, does Senior Qin have any further instructions?"</p><p>Zhou Jin said in a deep voice, "We return to the Chi'nan Island Chain immediately."</p><p>"Right, right...  Don't hold back Senior Qin..."</p><p>Everyone echoed in agreement.</p>
