<h1>Chapter 242: The Courtyard</h1><p>……</p><p>On the endless mountain range, there were ancient halls scattered among forests. Despite being dilapidated, there was still an air of ancient mystery.</p><p>These ancient halls were severely damaged, and there were no signs or plaques left.</p><p>However, Qin Sang noticed that there were areas in the mountain that looked like medicine gardens.</p><p>This was most likely a place for concocting pills!</p><p>What bothered Qin Sang was that the Fire Jade Centipede was still crawling in his palm, and up to this point, it still had not sensed the presence of any spirit objects.</p><p>Just as Qin Sang decided to sneak in to search the place, a person suddenly flew out from the ruins.</p><p>Those who entered the legacy site all knew each other by name.</p><p>Qin Sang remembered that this person was a disciple of the Taiyi Danzong. He called Cloud Wanderer his Senior Brother, yet his cultivation level was higher than Cloud Wanderer’s.</p><p>He was one of the nine in the first batch, and had entered the Ancient Immortal Legacy Site before Qin Sang.</p><p>This person’s face was full of gloom, and he flew out of the ancient hall cursing. He then directly boarded his sword and flew out of the mountain, seemingly uninterested in continuing his search.</p><p>When he saw Qin Sang, this person merely nodded without any interest. As Qin Sang passed him, he hesitated for a moment before saying, “Fellow Daoist Qin, I’m reminding you on the account of Senior Brother Cloud, don’t go in and waste your time. There’s nothing left in this dump. I searched from one end to the other. Not to mention magical artifacts or pills, I couldn’t even find a single stalk of spirit plant. Damn it, even a mouse would come out from here with tears in its eyes!”</p><p>Qin Sang was shocked, and quickly thanked him with cupped hands.</p><p>This person didn’t mind and didn’t even look back. He kept cursing as he flew, and his voice still rang out from afar when he disappeared from Qin Sang’s sight.</p><p>Qin Sang smiled and didn’t leave directly. He restrained his lightscreen, entered the mountain, and rapidly searched several magnificent ancient halls and medicine gardens.</p><p>It was as that person had said. There was nothing left except broken walls and fallen leaves.</p><p>Even the Fire Jade Centipede didn’t react.</p><p>When he returned to the mountaintop, Qin Sang gazed ahead, and the scenery beyond these mountains became increasingly desolate.</p><p>Then, he looked left and right and suddenly changed direction. He no longer headed north, but turned towards the west.</p><p>He had searched so many ruins along the way to no avail.</p><p>Qin Sang had already made some guesses, and now there was evidence. The less dangerous areas around the Ancient Cultivator Legacy Site had been ransacked by the Demonic Sect cultivators more than once, and they had probably excavated them.</p><p>Looking for Ancient Cultivator treasures here was like trying to find a needle in a haystack.</p><p>Finding any scraps was impossible.</p><p>If there were truly any treasures in the legacy site, they would only exist in one place.</p><p>……</p><p>On the road, Qin Sang occasionally saw lightscreens or swordlights flashing past in the distance, just like him, heading straight west.</p><p>In this direction, human figures appeared much more frequently, and it seemed that everyone was now aware of the situation, and they were tacitly coming together towards those four Heavenly Peaks.</p><p>As they got closer, the contours of the Four Heavenly Peaks gradually became clear, but they still couldn’t see the details of the mountains, as if there was an unknown restriction preventing those below from spying.</p><p>In the sky above, clouds and mist lingered around the peaks, and it was impossible to tell exactly how high they were. This cloud and mist didn’t look like natural clouds, and was somewhat like the fog in the trial space.</p><p>When they reached the foot of the Heavenly Peaks, the first thing they saw was a mysterious flame-shaped rune, suspended in mid-air. It was like an overturned bowl of red jade, sealing off a large space.</p><p>The runes were as red as fire, incomparably large, and covered the heavens and blotted out the sun.</p><p>Standing on the ground and looking up, one had the illusion of being surrounded by a sea of fire.</p><p>Qin Sang squinted and gazed at the flame runes, his heart filled with shock.</p><p>Even from such a distance, he could clearly sense the extreme violent energy contained within the flame runes, as if a terrifying storm capable of destroying heaven and earth was brewing.</p><p>Before the flame runes, he was so small. If the storm swept him away, he would die if even the edge of it grazed him!</p><p>This should be the guardian formation.</p><p>However, the flame runes were now covered with cracks, and he could see the tip of the iceberg through the gaps.</p><p>Beneath the flame runes, numerous strange peaks rose up, each with a different shape, arranged in neat rows.</p><p>One could imagine that in the past, when the Ancient Immortal Legacy Site was at its peak, countless cultivators would have traveled among these mountains, and the scenery must have been spectacular!</p><p>Most of these peaks were fully exposed, and there were ancient halls or altars on them. Like those in other places, they had all become ruined and damaged.</p><p>However, there are also some mountain peaks where certain areas are blocked by dense fog or barriers of light, impenetrable to the naked eye.</p><p>This thick fog is not ordinary fog, but a manifestation of a powerful restriction. As long as the fog remains, the restriction is still intact. It's likely that what's inside hasn't been taken yet!</p><p>However, any restriction that can endure until now and remain uncracked is certainly not simple.</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze shifted. Through a thin crack in the light barrier, he saw a mountain with several clusters of fog that lingered without dispersing, distributed in various locations on the mountain peak.</p><p>At this moment, three people had gathered in front of one of these clusters of fog.</p><p>All three were Foundation Establishment中期 experts who were trying to join forces to break the restriction. Their progress didn't seem to be going smoothly. After several attempts to enter the fog, they were all repelled without exception.</p><p>Every time they failed to break the restriction, several silver-white bolts of lightning would chase after them from the fog. They had to join forces to barely block them.</p><p>In the end, they were unable to break this restriction and had no choice but to leave and try somewhere else.</p><p>Seeing this scene, Qin Sang's heart sank slightly. If he wanted to gain anything, it seemed that he could only find someone to cooperate with.</p><p>After pondering for a while, Qin Sang set off and carefully passed through a crack in the flame rune, landing on a mountain peak at the edge.</p><p>Just as Qin Sang entered the rune, the fire jade centipede in his palm suddenly became unusually active.</p><p>There really is a treasure here!</p><p>Qin Sang didn't see any of his sect's senior brothers for the time being. He looked around and decided to search alone with the fire jade centipede.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the centipede's first target was the place where the three people had returned empty-handed.</p><p>Qin Sang was helpless. He could only grab the fire jade centipede and leave this mountain. After getting out of its range of perception, he released it again.</p><p>Thus, Qin Sang wandered aimlessly in the mountains, looking for his fellow disciples while searching with the help of the fire jade centipede. Whenever he noticed other people around, he would avoid them in advance.</p><p>The fire jade centipede could only sense spiritual objects with an abundance of fire element power, which limited its use. Qin Sang returned empty-handed several times, but he wasn't discouraged.</p><p>Another time, he found that the fire jade centipede was active again. He hurriedly followed it.</p><p>When he arrived, Qin Sang suddenly had a look of great delight on his face.</p><p>This time, the fire jade centipede had actually entered an abandoned courtyard!</p>
