<h1>Chapter 274: After the Event, Shaking Off and Walking</h1><p>A quarter of an hour later, they had escaped from the Stone Tablet once again.</p><p>Including the three Nascent Soul cultivators, none could hide the sight of their disheveled appearance.</p><p>The entire abode’s space had transformed into the Flame Spirit Beasts’ playground. They had just entered when they were besieged by a horde of Flame Spirit Beasts. The more Flame Spirit Beasts they killed, the more appeared. Even after joining up in battle formation, they felt great pressure, forced to retreat.</p><p>“Those Flame Spirit Beasts must’ve been born from the totems. Now that most of the totems had been destroyed, the birth rate of the new Flame Spirit Beasts has declined significantly. The three of us only need to spend a little more time to clear them out, little by little. It’s just that the space around the several Heavenly Peaks have completely collapsed, and spatial cracks run rampant. I fear that only Sect Masters can go near that place.”</p><p>Si Kong Mu Yue’s Dharma robe flashed and restored itself.</p><p>Flame Spirit Beasts had individually weak power, which Nascent Soul cultivators could easily handle. What they feared most was when Flame Spirit Beasts gathered together by the thousands or tens of thousands, like in the tunnels and the volcanic crater.</p><p>Now that Flame Spirit Beasts were scattered about the ancient cultivator’s gigantic abode, their density was much smaller by comparison. As long as the three Nascent Soul cultivators paid attention to stealthing their actions and not alarge a large group of Flame Spirit Beasts, it would be fine.</p><p>Che Yu Tao slowly shook his head. “Yuan Ying cultivators are all occupied with Heavenly Tribulations, and wouldn’t spare their attention easily. There are no treasures in the abode that can attract Yuan Ying cultivators… Furthermore, Daoist Si Kong wasn’t present at at the Heavenly Peak then, so you don’t understand the fear there. Close to the Heavenly Peak, space was extremely unstable. Cracks appeared frequently, and there were even spacial cracks that were invisible and hard to detect. Fellow Daoist Che nearly got swallowed by a crack and had a magic treasure destroyed before struggling free. Though the abode hasn’t been completely destroyed, the space at the depths of the abode is still changing drastically. Its danger is no lower than the core zone of the Ancient Immortal Battleground…”</p><p>Si Kong Mu Yue and Du Yi glanced at each other silently, hearing the subtext in Che Yu Tao’s words. Daoist Di Que and Daoist Xuan Yu were probably in great danger.</p><p>A heavy expression of worry surfaced on Du Yi’s face. “Daoist Di Que is fine; if Daoist Xuan Yu had an accident, I worry that the Shang Yuan Pure Palace may shift their anger to us…”</p><p>Du Yi understood clearly that out of the three of them, Si Kong Mu Yue and Che Yu Tao had support from their sects, so they didn’t need to fear the Shang Yuan Pure Palace’s anger. Only he had no significant backers, so it was highly possible that he would have face the fury of the Shang Yuan Pure Palace alone.</p><p>“Exploring and searching hidden places, encountering unexpected occurrences, is the most normal thing. The Shang Yuan Pure Palace won’t be so unreasonable. Moreover, Daoist Xuan Yu might’ve found a place to hide, so he might not necessarily have died. We can’t just ignore it; we must at least take a look by the Heavenly Peak.”</p><p>Si Kong Mu Yue paused, then continued, “Additionally, the mountain peaks before the Heavenly Peak might’ve been destroyed by the lava, but they were at the edge of the region of spacial cracks. They weren’t heavily affected by the spacial cracks, and a good half of them are still intact. The things within the mountains’ restrictions may not be very precious, but to Foundation Establishment disciples, they are treasures worth risking for. After we take care of these Flame Spirit Beasts, this place can become a training ground for our disciples.”</p><p>Che Yu Tao nodded. “Daoist Si Kong’s concerns are thoughtful. If that’s the case, then we three shall stay for a while. However, we still need to ask for a few helpers if we want to explore deeper into the abode…”</p><p>…</p><p>Xuanguan Pass.</p><p>Qin Sang stood outside the pass, looking up at the towering pass, full of emotions. If he counted, he hadn’t set foot into Xuanguan Pass for more than ten years now.</p><p>Suddenly, Mu Yifeng’s voice rang out beside his ear.</p><p>“Junior martial brother Qin, this brother still needs to report to Senior martial brother Qi, so I shall part ways first. We shall meet again another day.”</p><p>Qin Sang cupped his hands in return.</p><p>“Senior martial brother Mu, please go ahead.”</p><p>Watching Mu Yifeng leave, Qin Sang’s face was solemn.</p><p>After they came out of the ancient cultivator’s abode, Che Yu Tao had spread his orders, telling everyone to disperse.</p><p>Now that the ancient cultivator’s abode was occupied by Flame Spirit Beasts, there was no way for Foundation Establishment cultivators like them to enter the abode in the short term. They could only wait until the Nascent Soul cultivators had mostly cleared out the Flame Spirit Beasts before going inside to search for treasure.</p><p>The space of the abode had collapsed and the restriction formations on the mountains had loosened under the collision, perhaps becoming much more frail, easier to break than before.</p><p>Of course, it would also be more dangerous than before. After all, it was impossible to completely eradicate the Flame Spirit Beasts, and it was hard to say whether being at the edge of the area of spacial cracks was good or bad.</p><p>Qin Sang wasn’t interested in the treasures in the restriction. Only the Interior Scenery Rune, which he didn’t know Daoist Xuan Yu had stored somewhere, and the mysterious Stone Palace within the volcano’s belly attracted him.</p><p>The Heavenly Peak had already collapsed, and there was no way of knowing if the things inside had survived. Even if they had, Qin Sang still wouldn’t dare to go inside.</p><p>As Che Yutao said, the risks of the deep part of the Ruins are not inferior to the core area of the Ancient Immortal Battlefield. Even Daoist Jindan dare not trespass there, perhaps only the Yuan Ying ancestor can come and go freely.</p><p>If the Yuan Ying stage has already been broken, what would the Inner Scene Symbol be useful for?</p><p>It cannot be denied that this is a fascinating contradiction. Of course, Qin Sang is still a long way from thinking about this. The process of improving the Daoist Jindan is a task that lies before him.</p><p>Thinking of this, Qin Sang turned his palm and saw the relic that You Yunzi left.</p><p>You Yunzi has personal matters to deal with, leaving the relic to Qin Sang. After Qin Sang is settled, he can place the relic and the address in the Taiyi Pill Pavilion. When You Yunzi returns, they will discuss the trip to the herb garden.</p><p>The second Killing Talisman had been completely comprehended, and it was not necessary to continue practice before breaking into the middle stage of foundation building. Qin Sang decided to find a cave in the southern mountain of Xuanlan Pass for meditation, and so did not go to the Tianjing Secret Realm but returned directly to Xuanlan Pass.</p><p>The sky was getting dark.</p><p>After entering the city, Qin Sang found Yu Yangzi and leased a cave built by the sect.</p><p>Spirit stones still need to be used, and because Qin Sang asked for the best cave, the price was not low. However, he obtained the legacy of Di Que, and could afford it.</p><p>Then he went to Taiyi Pill Pavilion again.</p><p>After asking the deacon of Taiyi Pill Pavilion, Qin Sang sighed.</p><p>You Yunzi is right.</p><p>From the last time he came to now, over the past 20 years, Taiyi Pill Pavilion has never auctioned Heyun Dan, Wuzhi ointment, and Xueshen Yusheng Dan again. The last auction was a bottle of Wuzhi ointment, which was nearly 50 years ago.</p><p>Leaving You Yunzi's relic and cave address in the Taiyi Pill Pavilion, Qin Sang left the city that night.</p><p>The bright moon was high in the sky, and the snow was shining.</p><p>The night was like daytime.</p><p>To the south of Xuanlan Pass, there were snow-capped mountains stretching endlessly, like a giant dragon, no man's land.</p><p>The cold was bitter, but there were many spiritual veins hidden in the mountains, all of good quality. Mount Shaohua occupied several of them, which built caves for disciples and had Xuanlan guards patrolling them day and night to prevent anyone from trespassing in.</p><p>The cave was built on the top of a snow-capped mountain with an extremely wide view.</p><p>Qin Sang pushed open the stone gate, and a cold wind blew in, sweeping away the stale air inside. Feeling the spirit energy in the cave, Qin Sang nodded with satisfaction, closed the cave, set up some restrictions, and then sat cross-legged on the ice bed.</p><p>After thinking for a while, Qin Sang took out the bone chip and the Nine Dragons Heavenly Chariot Talisman.</p><p>Although he had not discussed it deeply with You Yunzi, he had already been inclined to accept the invitation and make a trip.</p>
