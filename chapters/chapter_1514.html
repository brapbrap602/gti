<h1></h1><p>Such a phenomenon could not possibly be the divine ability of that group of fiends and demons. Even Hun Mo and Tian Peng working together could not achieve this.</p><p>Palace Master Jiang and Elder Mei were dumbfounded.</p><p>They had not expected any real changes to occur on this trip. If Hun Mo and the others had trespassed deep into the Sacred Ground and accidentally been swept into the turbulent currents, suffering severe injuries, there might have been a chance to take advantage of the situation.</p><p>The scene before them shocked them to the point of near speechlessness.</p><p>The incomparably familiar Sacred Ground actually hid a secret that even they were unaware of.</p><p>"This…"</p><p>Elder Mei's mouth was slightly agape, and she stammered for a long while before muttering, "What exactly did the Palace Master do?"</p><p>The old demon Hun Mo had been lured here by Yin Changsheng.</p><p>She naturally suspected Yin Changsheng.</p><p>Palace Master Jiang stared at the space deep within the mist and said in a deep voice, "The Grand Elder questioned them just now. The Palace Master originally instructed them to create a false appearance around the stele and set up a killing array, waiting for Hun Mo to fall into the trap. Other than that, there shouldn't have been any further arrangements…"</p><p>If Yin Changsheng had known about the existence of the stele space, he would have opened it long ago.</p><p>"Could it be…that Hun Mo or Tian Peng discovered the secret of the stele? A secret that the cultivators of the Mysterious Sky Palace have never discovered throughout the generations?"</p><p>Elder Mei's voice was somewhat distorted; it was too unbelievable.</p><p>The Mysterious Sky Palace had been sitting on a treasure mountain without knowing it.</p><p>That group of fiends and demons discovered and opened the mysterious space on their first entry.</p><p>What kind of heaven-defying luck was this!</p><p>Could the stele be a sacred artifact of the demonic path or the demon race?</p><p>Qin Sang and Liuli flashed over to their side, also gazing at the white mist that was constantly expanding outward. It was Liuli's first time entering the Sacred Ground, so she didn't have as deep a feeling, only curiosity.</p><p>Qin Sang asked, "Is this the first time the stele has undergone such a change?"</p><p>Palace Master Jiang nodded, "Not to mention such an astonishing phenomenon, the predecessors have already tried various methods. No matter what we did, the stele never showed any reaction…"</p><p>Qin Sang ordered the Heavenly Eye Butterfly to fully activate its divine ability. As far as the eye could see, immortal mist swirled, and there seemed to be illusory shadows resembling pavilions inside, but it was unclear whether they were real or not.</p><p>The stele and the lotus platform were completely gone.</p><p>This space had been sealed for countless years, so why did it suddenly open at this time?</p><p>Qin Sang pondered to himself, wondering if it was related to the sword spirit. Could the sword spirit have sensed the fragments of the Killing Sword, thus triggering some restriction within the space?</p><p>The more Qin Sang thought about it, the more he felt it was possible.</p><p>In any case, he had to make a trip.</p><p>Qin Sang carefully examined the area and said, "There are no traces left by Hun Mo and the others here."</p><p>"The space is gradually opening. The stele should be the beginning, or rather, the entrance. Even if they made any arrangements, they were probably swallowed along with the stele," Palace Master Jiang nodded towards the front and assessed, "The entrance to the space now encompasses nearly ten *li* wide. It seems they have been inside for some time!"</p><p>Palace Master Jiang looked troubled.</p><p>Although he understood that time was of the essence, there was a group of ferocious fiends and demons inside. They only had four people, which was too thin. If they acted rashly, not only would they fail to obtain any opportunities, but their lives would be in danger.</p><p>Elder Mei frowned and immediately said, "I will go back and report to the Grand Elder, and bring people over. You act according to the situation!"</p><p>With that, Elder Mei summoned her magic treasure and used the fastest speed she had ever achieved in her life, disappearing into the turbulent void in the blink of an eye.</p><p>Qin Sang and Liuli exchanged a glance and said, "Palace Master Jiang, we are preparing to go in first to scout the path. What are your thoughts?"</p><p>Palace Master Jiang hesitated for a moment, "I'll search nearby to see if I can find any traces, and wait for the Grand Elder and the others. The stele is part of the Sacred Ground, so the space must have some connection with the floating mountain outside. Perhaps there's something we can use. The fiends and demons are powerful, so be careful. Liuli, take this Golden Toad."</p><p>With that, Palace Master Jiang took out two Golden Toads the size of a thumb.</p><p>The Golden Toads held pearls in their mouths.</p><p>Handing one Golden Toad to Liuli, Palace Master Jiang explained, "The space inside should not be very vast. This is a special magic artifact I obtained during my travels many years ago. It can transmit simple messages within a certain range, unless it is blocked by a special spirit array or seal. If you encounter any trouble, call for help immediately!"</p><p>In a place like this, having a means of communication was not a bad thing.</p><p>As Liuli took the Golden Toad, Qin Sang lightly patted his corpse puppet bag and took out Palace Master Yin's imprisoned Nascent Soul.</p><p>He released part of the seal.</p><p>Palace Master Yin woke up, feeling a bit confused at first. Upon seeing Qin Sang's face, he realized his current situation and said coldly, "Why not give Yin a quick death? You still妄想..."</p><p>Halfway through his sentence, Palace Master Yin realized that the surrounding environment was not right. He stared straight at the white mist, his Nascent Soul's face revealing an uncontainable expression of shock.</p><p>Seeing Palace Master Yin's expression, Qin Sang knew that Yin Changsheng had not tampered with anything.</p><p>He resealed him, and Qin Sang and Liuli flashed inside.</p><p>The entire entrance to the space was sealed by immortal mist.</p><p>The mist looked very mysterious.</p><p>Qin Sang did not dare to be careless. He let Liuli follow behind him, slowed down, and proceeded cautiously.</p><p>After walking some distance, they discovered that there were no obstacles here, not even restrictions or protective spirit arrays. The path was completely unimpeded.</p><p>Qin Sang gradually sped up. After hurrying along for a while, the mist gradually thinned.</p><p>The illusory shadows of the pavilions they had seen earlier were not illusions.</p><p>Emerging from the area shrouded in mist, they saw a small lake. A pavilion was built on the lake, with upturned eaves and cornices, exceptionally exquisite.</p><p>Qin Sang and Liuli stopped, concealed their auras, and observed their surroundings. They found that the cloud layer above was boundless and pressed down extremely low, giving people a feeling of extreme oppression and danger.</p><p>On the opposite bank of the lake was a mountain.</p><p>The lake water had already dried up, and this mountain was no longer as elegant and spirited as it used to be.</p><p>However, the pavilion and the buildings connected to it behind were still as fresh as new, completely intact. The mountain was full of sparkling lights, the radiance emitted by ancient restrictions.</p><p>Qin Sang did not see Hun Mo and the others, but he noticed some fresh traces on the mountain. Someone had forcibly broken the ancient restrictions here.</p><p>The direction pointed to by the traces was the most conspicuous wooden building behind the pavilion.</p><p>This building was only two stories high, with a red gourd carved on the top, slightly tilted. Three large characters were written on it – Alchemy Fragrance Pavilion.</p><p>"Alchemy Fragrance Pavilion, could it be a place where ancient cultivators refined pills? The pill room is right at the entrance, what kind of layout is this?"</p><p>Qin Sang muttered to himself, noticing that the restrictions of the Alchemy Fragrance Pavilion had been broken. It was estimated that the group of fiends and demons had looted it several times.</p><p>Beyond the Alchemy Fragrance Pavilion, several jade steps branched out, leading in different directions.</p><p>No figures were seen in any of the directions.</p><p>Qin Sang and Liuli discussed for a few moments and quietly headed towards the Alchemy Fragrance Pavilion.</p><p>Since they had arrived late, they didn't mind taking a bit more time.</p><p>Although the Alchemy Fragrance Pavilion had been preempted, by observing the restrictions inside, they could gain an understanding of this mysterious space.</p><p>With someone having paved the way, Qin Sang and Liuli arrived in front of the Alchemy Fragrance Pavilion effortlessly.</p><p>Qin Sang and Liuli exchanged a glance, their eyes filled with surprise.</p><p>They could not even tell what material was used to build this building. They could only be certain that it was not ordinary and was a spiritual material they had never seen before!</p><p>However, the more mysterious the space of the stele was, the greater the possibility of the existence of the Killing Sword fragments.</p><p>Qin Sang had once witnessed the inner hall of the Seven Kill Palace and the restored Purple Palace, with their magnificent grandeur. He originally felt that the Sacred Ground of the Mysterious Sky Palace was not worthy of the Killing Sword fragments.</p><p>After confirming that there were no traps around, Qin Sang and Liuli stepped to the door and gently pushed it open. The scene inside came into view.</p><p>The first floor was an empty hall.</p><p>The only thing was a jade pill furnace, which was as tall as a person, with large ears and a round belly. There were some small circular holes on the furnace lid, but no smoke was coming out of it now.</p><p>The spiritual fire below the furnace had long been extinguished.</p><p>There were no ancient restrictions here, but there were some auras of Daoist techniques and divine abilities that had not completely dissipated.</p><p>Old demon Hun Mo and the others had tried to take the jade pill furnace, but they had failed.</p><p>It was clear that this object was not as simple as it appeared!</p><p>Liuli seemed to be very interested in the patterns on the furnace and leaned closer to examine them.</p><p>Qin Sang did not act rashly. He casually glanced around and climbed the stairs leading to the second floor. The scene here was even more unexpected.</p><p>The furnishings on the second floor were also very simple.</p><p>On each of the four walls stood an identical table, presumably where pills were stored.</p><p>At this time, each of the four tables had a treasure gourd for storing pills, and none of them had been taken away!</p><p>"This…"</p><p>Seeing this scene, Qin Sang immediately raised his assessment of the stele space to a higher level.</p><p>So many experts had gone to great lengths to break the restrictions of the Alchemy Fragrance Pavilion, but in the end, they couldn't even get a single gourd. It was simply unbelievable!</p><p>Qin Sang felt a little strange. He hesitated for a moment, walked to the opposite table, raised his hand, and his True Essence surged out, forming a hand that grabbed one of the treasure gourds.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>A shocking scene appeared.</p><p>The moment the hand touched the treasure gourd, the light distorted, and it easily passed through the treasure gourd as if it were nothing.</p><p>When his hand left, the treasure gourd immediately returned to its original state.</p><p>Qin Sang was startled and said in surprise, "An illusion?"</p><p>An illusion so realistic that it could be mistaken for reality.</p><p>The Heavenly Eye Butterfly did not detect it at all.</p><p>Although the Heavenly Eye Butterfly's divine ability was strong, it was also limited by cultivation, and it was impossible to see through all illusions.</p><p>Qin Sang tried several times, and all the treasure gourds were the same. He could only look but not touch.</p><p>He immediately turned and went downstairs, and found that the jade pill furnace was also the same.</p><p>Qin Sang had to admit that his knowledge was shallow. He really couldn't tell whether these treasure gourds were illusions or were sealed by a special restriction, entering a mysterious state.</p><p>No wonder there were so many auras of Daoist techniques and divine abilities remaining around.</p><p>The treasure was right in front of them, but they couldn't touch it, like flowers in a mirror or the moon in the water. It was no wonder that the group of fiends and demons were angry and unwilling.</p><p>"It seems that opportunities are not so easy to obtain. It is still unknown who will ultimately obtain them."</p><p>Qin Sang sighed inwardly and looked at Liuli, who was focused on observing the pill furnace, "Immortal Fairy, have you discovered anything?"</p><p>Liuli raised her hand and pointed to one of the patterns on the pill furnace.</p><p>Qin Sang looked over and found that this pattern was drawn very simply. If one looked carefully, one could still see that it depicted the scene around the Alchemy Fragrance Pavilion.</p><p>There were several people sitting cross-legged in the pavilion on the lake, drinking wine and reciting poems, unrestrained and carefree. Wisps of smoke drifted out of the Alchemy Fragrance Pavilion behind them, and the young attendants were busy inside.</p><p>Following the brushstrokes, one could find that this picture seemed to encompass the entire space of the stele.</p><p>The latter part was more impressionistic than the former, and no accurate information could be seen.</p><p>However, after careful analysis, Qin Sang and Liuli confirmed that there were three places that should be the most important locations in the stele space.</p><p>No figures were seen around, and it was estimated that they had all gone there.</p><p>The three places were located in three directions, far apart from each other. Only by going through all of them could one determine what these places were used for.</p><p>The fiends and demons had probably already searched separately.</p><p>If they searched one place at a time, they would definitely not make it in time.</p><p>Qin Sang took out the Yang Puppet Crystal given to him by Dongyang Bo, released the demonic fire restriction, and his divine sense probed in. He did not sense the position of General Gui. He walked out of the Alchemy Fragrance Pavilion, climbed the jade steps, and tried one jade step after another.</p><p>Finally, after walking a certain distance on one of the jade steps, the Yang Puppet Crystal finally reacted.</p><p>General Gui was just ahead!</p><p>It was one of the three places that Qin Sang and Liuli had selected!</p><p>This group of fiends and demons were not good people, and there was no trust between them. They could only cooperate temporarily under the pressure of the Mysterious Sky Palace.</p><p>With the secret realm in front of them, it was already good that they hadn't immediately turned against each other, and they would definitely be extremely wary of each other.</p><p>Grand Sage Tian Peng led the army to conquer the human race, and his military exploits were outstanding. His prestige in the demon race even surpassed that of Grand Sage Nine-Headed. The demon kings had long suffered from the human race, and they shared a common hatred. They were obviously more united than the demonic cultivators.</p><p>Those demonic masters were also worried about being defeated one by one by the demon race, and they should not be too far away from Hun Mo.</p><p>If there was a treasure trove in the space of the stele, it was most likely there!</p><p>Thinking of this, Qin Sang called Liuli, left a mark for Tong Lingyu in a hidden place, and immediately set off.</p><p>The sensing of the Yang Puppet Crystal was sometimes clear and sometimes blurry.</p><p>Qin Sang judged that whenever General Gui used that puppet and activated the power of the Yin Puppet Crystal, it was easier to be sensed by the Yang Puppet Crystal.</p><p>In that case, General Gui might be fighting with someone!</p><p>"Have they already started fighting? It seems that they really found something…"</p><p>Qin Sang chuckled in his heart. It was easier to fish in troubled waters.</p><p>There were no ancient restrictions on the jade steps, which meandered through patches of exotic flowers and plants, dense forests and bamboo. But after the incident at the Alchemy Fragrance Pavilion, Qin Sang always felt that the scenery here was not real, and it might all be an illusion.</p><p>Along the way, Qin Sang remained vigilant, and did not feel that he was being spied on.</p><p>Before long, Qin Sang and Liuli climbed a hillside along the jade steps. Turning a corner, they saw the scene further ahead. It was another mountain peak, and there were more and more岔路.</p><p>With the Yang Puppet Crystal guiding them, they continued to walk, their goal clear. They climbed one mountain after another, getting closer and closer to that place.</p><p>At the same time, the sensing of the puppet crystal became clearer.</p><p>Unexpectedly, along the way, they did not encounter a single person, as if all the fiends and demons had disappeared.</p><p>"It's just ahead, be careful."</p><p>Qin Sang reminded her through voice transmission, concealed his aura, and slowed down.</p><p>Turning around this cliff face, Qin Sang's gaze suddenly froze.</p><p>On the pill furnace, this place was depicted with a straight ink line.</p><p>In reality, however, the road behind the cliff face turned sharply downward, leading to a deep valley. The interior of the deep valley was like a sea of clouds, a scene of chaos.</p><p>Deep in the clouds, colorful lights flickered, surging in the sea of clouds, as if they might rush out of the deep valley at any time and reappear in the world.</p><p>According to past experience, it was a sign that a treasure was about to be born.</p><p>There was no one in front of the deep valley.</p><p>The Yang Puppet Crystal pointed to the deep valley.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at the deep valley, carefully observed the entrance, and did not find anyone guarding it. It seemed that all the fiends and demons had been attracted inside.</p>
