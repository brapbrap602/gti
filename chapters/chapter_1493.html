<h1>Chapter 1484: The Opening of the Sacred Land</h1><p>Unnoticed, a month had passed in the blink of an eye. During this time, Qin Sang and Liu Li were inseparable, barely resting as they ventured deep into the frontlines, engaging in skirmishes with the demon tribes. The Profound Heaven Palace clearly intended to leverage Qin Sang's ability to infiltrate the demon ranks. However, Qin Sang did not draw too much attention to himself, diligently completing his tasks without fanfare.</p><p>He had initially hoped to seize the opportunity to capture the Poison Cloud Steed to feed his Fat Silkworm. However, the demon tribes were not as reckless as they had imagined; they were just as cautious. Over the course of the month, Qin Sang encountered demon kings only a handful of times, and each time, they moved in groups, heavily protected by the beast tides. After a period of standoff, both sides would tacitly withdraw.</p><p>Since no one had personally witnessed the two great demon sages, it was difficult to draw any conclusions from these signs alone. However, it couldn't be ruled out that the Nine-Headed Great Sage might still make a move. The demon tribes seemed to be probing as well.</p><p>Yin Changsheng, the Palace Master of the Profound Heaven Palace, was a figure of immense prestige in the North Sea, unrivaled in both cultivation and influence. It was precisely this atmosphere of uncertainty, with a storm brewing on the horizon, that made everyone uneasy.</p><p>A month later, the demon tribes became increasingly active, their pressure mounting daily. They began launching small-scale probes, which quickly escalated into a large-scale battle. Qin Sang and Liu Li were inevitably drawn into the fray. Unfortunately, the demon kings on the opposing side were extremely vigilant. At the first sign of trouble, they abandoned their subordinates and fled, leaving no opportunity for Qin Sang to pursue them with his Thunder Escape technique, especially under the watchful eyes of others.</p><p>In the end, both sides suffered casualties, leaving behind a trail of bodies as they faced off outside the Demon-Resisting Island. The demon army loomed overhead like a dark cloud.</p><p>Amidst this tense situation, the day of the Sacred Land's opening arrived as scheduled. Coinciding with a lull in the battle, it was decided to proceed with the prearranged plan. Qin Sang and the others quietly left Demon-Resisting Island.</p><p>This time, only Jiang Dianzhu, Qin Sang, Liu Li, and another Nascent Soul elder from the Listening Snow Pavilion, along with a group of talented juniors, entered the Sacred Land. Shi Xue remained behind with the others to defend Demon-Resisting Island. The other factions followed a similar approach, with most of their experts staying behind to guard against any potential demon incursions.</p><p>According to Tong Lingyu, this gathering would be the most low-key in recent years.</p><p>...</p><p>"Whoosh!"</p><p>A massive wave crashed down, sending up a spray of white foam.</p><p>"I never expected the Profound Heaven Palace's Sacred Land to be outside the Hidden Sun Realm," Qin Sang remarked, standing on a small island and reflecting on their recent journey.</p><p>After returning to the Hidden Sun Realm from Demon-Resisting Island, Tong Lingyu retrieved the Ice Demon Crystal and led the group into one of the Seventy-Two Springs. From there, they ventured into a highly secretive area and stepped onto an ancient teleportation array. The other end of the array led to this nameless island, which was clearly far removed from the Hidden Sun Realm, having traversed untold distances to reach this unknown location.</p><p>Qin Sang only knew that they were now at the southernmost edge of the North Sea, not far from the storm belt to the south, but the exact location remained a mystery. This was a fully intact ancient teleportation array, and even if they had been transported to the western reaches of the Boundless Sea, Qin Sang wouldn't have been surprised.</p><p>The island was heavily guarded, sealed off by a grand formation that not only prevented outsiders from entering but also restricted those on the island from leaving without the consent of the Palace Master and the Grand Elder.</p><p>Jiang Dianzhu stood beside Qin Sang and chuckled, "The Sacred Land is filled with treasures and is the cornerstone of the Profound Heaven Palace. How could it be something created by modern cultivators? Including the Body Cleansing Pool, all the restrictions within originate from ancient times. We can only follow the rules of the Sacred Land. Qingfeng, once inside, don't act rashly."</p><p>"I understand," Qin Sang nodded.</p><p>He awakened the Heavenly Eye Butterfly to observe their surroundings. On three sides, there was nothing but water, with no landmarks in sight. To the south, the storm belt loomed like a shadowy curtain, a familiar sight that stirred old memories within Qin Sang.</p><p>"Will the Palace Master appear today?" he asked, glancing back at the teleportation hall.</p><p>Jiang Dianzhu nodded, "This array can only be opened by combining the tokens of the Palace Master and the Grand Elder. It is precisely because of such caution that the location of the Sacred Land has never been leaked."</p><p>"How far is the Sacred Land from here?"</p><p>"It lies within the storm belt," Jiang Dianzhu pointed southward.</p><p>As they spoke, the teleportation hall suddenly emitted a series of ripples, glowing faintly. Qin Sang and Liu Li exchanged a glance, then suppressed their auras and followed Jiang Dianzhu, standing with the other cultivators from various factions as they awaited the Palace Master.</p><p>At that moment, a clear bird call echoed from within the hall.</p><p>"Chirp chirp..."</p><p>Qin Sang's expression turned peculiar as he glanced at the other Nascent Soul cultivators, all of whom remained unfazed, as if this were nothing unusual.</p><p>In the next moment, a strong gust of wind burst forth from the hall, and the first thing that caught their eyes was an incredibly majestic spirit bird—a rare descendant of the Vermilion Bird!</p><p>"Whoosh!"</p><p>The Vermilion Bird had two pupils in each eye, its gaze fierce and intimidating. Facing these Nascent Soul cultivators, it showed no fear, flapping its wings as it soared out of the hall, pulling a resplendent, golden carriage that exuded an inexplicable aura of authority.</p><p>At the sight of the Vermilion Bird and the carriage, the cultivators' eyes lit up. This divine bird-drawn carriage belonged to the Palace Master! The Palace Master had not broken his promise; he had come personally to open the Sacred Land, dispelling all previous rumors!</p><p>Qin Sang, too, was curious about this enigmatic Palace Master. His gaze shifted from the Vermilion Bird to the carriage, only to find that it was sealed on three sides, with the remaining side obscured by tassels, making it impossible to see inside.</p><p>"Greetings, Palace Master," Tong Lingyu stepped forward and bowed.</p><p>The others followed suit.</p><p>The divine bird-drawn carriage hovered in mid-air, the Vermilion Bird looking down at the Nascent Soul cultivators with a proud gleam in its eyes.</p><p>A calm voice emanated from within the carriage, "You have waited long enough. Grand Elder, open the formation at once."</p><p>"Understood!"</p><p>Tong Lingyu lightly tapped her storage pouch, tossing out half of a jade seal. At the same time, the tassels on the carriage swayed, and a stream of light flew out. The two halves of the jade seal merged into one, shooting upward and embedding themselves into the light barrier above the island.</p><p>Silently, a circular opening appeared in the barrier.</p><p>The Vermilion Bird flapped its wings, pulling the carriage through the opening first. Tong Lingyu then summoned a spirit boat large enough to accommodate everyone and turned to the group, "Fellow Daoists, please board."</p><p>Once everyone was on board, Tong Lingyu activated the boat's restrictions and piloted it out of the island. She retrieved the jade seal and followed the carriage southward, directly into the storm belt.</p><p>In an instant, the spirit boat was engulfed by the raging winds, the sky darkening around them. The carriage and the boat weaved through the storm, dodging and maneuvering.</p><p>Those on the boat found their senses blocked by the boat's restrictions, their vision filled with nothing but the omnipresent gales. While the restrictions were not overly powerful, anyone attempting to send a message outward would immediately be detected by the Grand Elder and the Palace Master.</p><p>Before long, the spirit boat shuddered and came to an abrupt halt. The divine bird-drawn carriage had already stopped.</p><p>Qin Sang looked outside, but there were no conspicuous signs of anything unusual. The Profound Heaven Palace's Sacred Land was deeply hidden.</p><p>At that moment, Tong Lingyu retrieved the ice box Qin Sang was familiar with. She placed her hand gently over the box, her palm glowing as the light flowed across its surface, activating layer after layer of restrictions.</p><p>"Click!"</p><p>The ice box opened, revealing a perfectly shaped, transparent crystal—the Ice Demon Crystal!</p>
