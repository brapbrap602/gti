<h1>Chapter 1874: My Wish</h1><p>Qin Sang put down the jade slip, hesitating, "On the battlefield, there are Grand Masters and Demon Kings clashing. I fear I will be of little use..."</p><p>Zuo Zhenren smiled, "If Grand Masters and Demon Kings could completely control the battlefield and directly engage in a life-or-death struggle, why the need for such a large-scale operation? Moreover, there are overt and covert clashes outside the battlefield, making it inconvenient to deploy Grand Masters.  Except for those Demon Kings who have self-reduced their cultivation, few Demon Lords would be a match for you... You don't need to worry about encountering a Demon King; they will certainly be in seclusion, focusing on restoring their cultivation; otherwise, it would be a case of losing sight of the forest for the trees!"</p><p>It was clear that Zuo Zhenren and the others felt the same way, which is why they valued Qin Sang so highly.</p><p>In Zuo Zhenren's opinion, Qin Sang's strength lay not only in his Spiritual Wood body, but also in his escape techniques, which were comparable to Ling You Wang's. As long as he didn't encounter a Demon King, he could come and go freely.</p><p>Such individuals were invaluable during wartime, and they were few and far between in the Dao Court's two academies.</p><p>Pausing, Zuo Zhenren looked at Qin Sang, who was lost in thought, and said, "Are you worried that, not being a direct disciple of our Daoist sect, you might be ostracized in the Dao Court?  In extraordinary times, we must take extraordinary measures.  These are turbulent times; whoever dares to be jealous of talent and ability will be defying the entire world, opposing the Dao Court, and opposing me, Zuo Zhenren!"</p><p>Zuo Zhenren's eyes widened slightly, and he slammed his fist on the table.</p><p>In fact, Qin Sang wasn't worried about this. Zuo Zhenren's personal recommendation had made his stance clear.</p><p>With a Grand Master backing him, a Dao Court veteran who had self-reduced his cultivation, even if someone harbored malicious intentions, they would have to think twice.</p><p>Making use of the chaos on the battlefield to seize opportunities was also part of Qin Sang's plan.</p><p>But not now.</p><p>"Senior's kindness overwhelms me."</p><p>Qin Sang stood up, bowed, and continued, "To be honest, my battle with Ling You Wang was fraught with peril, but it also brought unexpected benefits.  In the face of life and death, my mind became clear, and I gained enlightenment.  Later, I received guidance from you, Senior, which greatly inspired me.  Now, I am eager to enter seclusion and consolidate my gains."</p><p>This was true.</p><p>In the past year, Qin Sang had reflected on himself and felt that his path ahead was bright. The fierce battle at the altar had greatly benefited his cultivation. He had a feeling that the only thing he lacked was perhaps more experience.</p><p>Zuo Zhenren understood and nodded slightly.  "In that case, you should prioritize your cultivation. Only then can you better serve the Dao Court.  Rome wasn't built in a day, and the flames of war won't ignite immediately."</p><p>After some thought, Qin Sang decided to test Zuo Zhenren's position, "In your opinion, Senior, how long can this current stalemate last?"</p><p>"Humph! If I weren't lacking in strength, I would attack the Grand Saint Mansion right now! Those demons seem arrogant, but they are just bluffing. Gui Fang Kingdom has been secretly withdrawing its troops, intending to avoid battle."</p><p>Zuo Zhenren's face showed displeasure, and he stood up, slamming the table. "They stole treasures and now want to play the coward?  There's no such easy way out in this world!"</p><p>Qin Sang didn't know what exactly Gui Fang Kingdom had stolen, but from Zuo Zhenren's tone, the Dao Court seemed to have suffered a considerable loss.</p><p>"Since you have made your decision, I won't press you. Take this token.  When you have made up your mind, bring this token to find me. I will be cultivating at the altar," Zuo Zhenren handed over a golden token.</p><p>The token had a single character 'Zuo' engraved on it.</p><p>Qin Sang thanked him, received the token with both hands, and seeing that Zuo Zhenren was already showing signs of wanting him to leave, he bowed and took his leave.</p><p>Leaving the golden hall and returning to the platform, he found the golden-armored guard waiting for him.</p><p>The two rode on a cloud together, returning the way they came.</p><p>Leaving the White Stone Altar, Qin Sang turned back to look at it one last time before merging into the bustling streets.</p><p>He pondered their conversation; everything seemed to have gone smoothly.</p><p>This trip was a great success. His relationship with the Dao Court had taken another step forward, and with Zuo Zhenren as his backer, his future actions would be much easier.</p><p>Perhaps Zuo Zhenren had worked behind the scenes, allowing Qin Sang to exchange his merit in killing Ling You Wang for crucial information on Void Refinement cultivation. He had even some left, but he didn't plan to use them now.</p><p>Walking through the streets and alleys, he entered a green mountain within the immortal city.</p><p>A familiar courtyard scene came into view – it was Master Gu's mansion. Qin Sang recalled the letter, lightly touching the restriction on the gate.</p><p>"Who's there?"</p><p>"Oh! Senior, you're back!"</p><p>A cheerful laugh came from behind the courtyard, followed by two beams of green light that darted to the gate, revealing two pretty girls in sea-blue robes, smiling happily at Qin Sang, their faces full of delight.</p><p>"Are you Feng'er and Yan'er?"</p><p>Qin Sang looked at the two girls. Their features were somewhat familiar.  They were the two young acolytes he had met before.</p><p>Last time I was here, they were little acolytes, six or seven years old, delicate and pretty. Now, they look like seventeen or eighteen-year-old girls.</p><p>Their actual age is, of course, much more.  Living in the Gu residence, with few opportunities to go out, they are unspoiled by the world and remain innocent and carefree.</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>The two girls nodded like pecking chicks, opening the barrier without announcement.  Yan’er whispered, “Master is refining artifacts.”</p><p>Qin Sang smiled gently. After a year of being together, they still remembered her.  The parting gift must still be working its charm.</p><p>Escorted by the two girls, Qin Sang walked familiarly towards the guest hall, the sound of their chatter filling her ears.</p><p>Qin Sang had fond memories of her childhood here. The two girls were initially a little nervous, but seeing Qin Sang’s attitude was as before, their apprehension towards her disappeared completely.  They had heard Master Gu say Qin Sang came from Jushan Prefecture, while their furthest travels had only taken them to the other Jing Altars in Baishi Prefecture.  They yearned for the outside world and were both curious about and fearful of the demons of the Gui Fang Kingdom.</p><p>The two girls worked quickly and efficiently.  As soon as Qin Sang sat down, fragrant tea was served. They sat on either side of her, their elbows resting on the table, hands cupping their chins, their bright eyes fixed on Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang rarely had such a leisurely time. Leaning back in her chair, teacup in hand, surrounded by the fragrance of tea and orchids, she didn’t find their chatter annoying. She smiled, answering their questions freely and sometimes offering small gifts.</p><p>No matter how tricky Feng’er and Yan’er’s questions were, they always received intriguing answers.</p><p>Exclamations occasionally rang out from the guest hall.</p><p>Qin Sang took a sip of the fragrant tea, contentedly closing her eyes. She looked towards the door and nodded with a smile.</p><p>Master Gu entered from outside. The two girls didn't notice. They had just heard Qin Sang recount a story of battling a powerful demon king, their faces flushed with a mixture of fear and excitement, eagerly asking for details.</p><p>‘Snap!’</p><p>Master Gu deliberately made a noise.</p><p>The two girls turned to see their master, their faces paling. They quickly stood up, softly calling him “Master,” and hung their heads, unable to speak.</p><p>“Go,” Master Gu said calmly.</p><p>The two girls breathed a sigh of relief and hurried out, forgetting to refill their master’s tea.</p><p>Master Gu sat opposite Qin Sang, studying her for a moment before saying softly, “Friend, haven't you been too tense lately?”</p><p>Qin Sang was taken aback.  On reflection, it was true.</p><p>Since arriving in this world, she had been busy restoring her cultivation, then obtaining the *Poison God Scripture* and the Flower Field Manor.</p><p>Cultivation, body refinement, artifact refinement, sword practice…</p><p>Nie Yuan, the Demon Kingdom, Star Island Lake, Baishi Prefecture…</p><p>It had been a continuous cycle of cultivation and travel, without a moment's respite.</p><p>In the Storm World, while she had also cultivated diligently, she had friends and travels, offering more balance than now.</p><p>However, it was undeniable that her progress in this world was unparalleled, surpassing anything she had ever dared to imagine.</p><p>Qin Sang drank a large gulp of tea, savoring the bitter taste. “It is my wish,” she said.</p><p>Master Gu nodded, not pursuing the topic.  His tone shifted, and he said apologetically, “Did you receive the letter? The situation has changed, and I couldn’t contact you. I took the liberty of doing something, I hope you won’t blame me.”</p><p>Qin Sang put down her teacup, her expression turning serious. “Has a Grand Master seen the war drum?”</p><p>Master Gu shook his head. “Because of the impending war,  Grand Master Xun of the North Pole Exorcism Academy summoned us to the palace for an audience. I mentioned it briefly. However, without your permission, I wouldn’t have dared to show the war drum.”</p><p>In the letter, Master Gu had asked Qin Sang if she was willing to present the war drum to the Dao Court.  If the Dao Court could replicate it, even if they only managed to create a few spirit treasure-grade war drums, it would be a significant asset on the battlefield.  The moment he repaired the war drum, Master Gu had understood its value.</p><p>Master Gu continued, “Grand Master Xun doesn’t know everything yet, but he has offered a substantial reward, promising that he won’t mistreat you.”</p><p>Qin Sang remained silent for a long time before saying, “Master Gu should know that I wish to comprehend the art of artifact refinement by restoring this drum.”</p><p>A natural spirit treasure was a rare opportunity, one not to be easily missed.</p><p>A year ago, Qin Sang might have considered it.</p><p>Back then, there was no Illusory Storm, and finding the path to ascension didn’t necessarily require the Taiyi Star Chart.</p><p>Times had changed. Qin Sang had to seize every opportunity to improve herself, striving to repair this treasure.</p><p>As if expecting her answer, Master Gu said, “After you restore the war drum, you can present it to the Dao Court.  As long as you submit your insights into its restoration, I believe the Dao Court won't mind, and will instead fully support you in quickly understanding the restoration method…”</p><p>There was a hint of something unusual in Master Gu’s tone.</p><p>Qin Sang understood, a flicker of interest in her eyes.  “Master Gu means…?”</p><p>Master Gu nodded. “Friend Daoist, haven't you been lacking proper guidance? The Daoist Court possesses a vast collection of ancient texts, including countless treatises on artifact refinement, lost lineages of various schools, and even the opportunity to receive personal instruction from the Court's master artisans. Why not seize this chance?”</p><p>She gestured towards the forge. “As for the materials needed to repair the war drum, the Daoist Court is wealthy beyond measure. You need not worry about that.”</p><p>Qin Sang knew Master Gu's words weren't idle chatter; they surely came with the Court's approval.  The secret of the war drum had been leaked; Qin Sang didn't believe he could simply stay.  His thoughts were focused on what he could gain in exchange.</p><p>These terms were exceptionally favorable, exceeding his expectations. Every condition seemed tailored to his needs!</p><p>Artifact refinement lineage, tutelage from a grand master, precious materials…</p><p>Each precisely addressed his weaknesses, a testament to Master Gu's skillful negotiation.  Qin Sang harbored no fear of the Daoist Court breaking its promise; in this regard, the Court had an impeccable reputation.</p><p>“In that case, please trouble Master Gu to contact True Person Xun. I accept!”</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't think of a reason to refuse and decided immediately.</p><p>Master Gu rejoiced, immediately discussing details with Qin Sang in the guest hall and producing a blank talisman.  She listed the materials needed to restore the war drum.</p><p>At the end, Qin Sang, using his true essence as a writing implement, added several more items. These materials were for re-refining his Mingshan Armor.</p><p>“You… you…”</p><p>Master Gu pointed at Qin Sang, bursting into laughter.</p><p>“Master Gu, if there's anything you urgently need, just add it to the list,” Qin Sang laughed.</p><p>Master Gu shook her head, smiling, and put away the talisman without further comment. For the Daoist Court, these materials were insignificant.</p><p>“True Person Xun is busy with the war, rarely seen.  It will be difficult to meet him.  Once he returns, I will arrange a meeting. In the meantime, carefully review your own understanding of artifact refinement. Guidance from a grand master is invaluable; don't waste the opportunity by asking trivial questions!”</p><p>Master Gu's expression turned serious as she solemnly warned him.</p><p>Qin Sang responded respectfully and directly sought instruction from Master Gu, who readily complied, helping him organize his foundational understanding.</p><p>Six months later.</p><p>Qin Sang left the White Stone region, his escape light soaring north. He hadn't met True Person Xun during those six months, but his understanding of artifact refinement had deepened.  Master Gu’s guidance had given him a clearer direction for choosing texts and lineages.</p><p>After waiting for True Person Xun for a long time to no avail, Qin Sang decided to repair the Flower Field Formation first.</p><p>Nearly two years had passed. The area outside the altar had returned to its former lively state; the battlefield was covered in green grass, and the scars of war gradually faded.</p><p>Qin Sang entered the altar and smoothly reached his cave.  The hasty repairs to the formation, under constant tremors, had resulted in several malfunctions over time.</p><p>Qin Sang deployed his spiritual sense, sweeping across the entire flower field.</p><p>As expected, the flower spirits’ recovery in this environment was extremely slow.  Most were weak and listless, yielding not a single drop of flower dew in two years.</p><p>‘Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!’</p><p>Streams of light flew from his Qianjun Ring, shooting towards various points in the formation.</p><p>As Qin Sang worked, the barrier outside the flower field became increasingly solid and robust, until finally, the energy flowed smoothly, restoring it to its original state!</p><p>The space within the spiritual array instantly stabilized significantly.  Unless the altar experienced another upheaval, this formation could easily last a century.</p><p>Qin Sang lingered briefly before leaving the flower field space and heading deeper into the altar.</p><p>Compared to two years ago, the illusory storm showed little change. At this rate, it would likely take hundreds of years to subside.</p><p>Qin Sang sighed, exiting the altar. This time, he didn't go west, but east, visiting the snake demon before returning to Sword Heart Island.</p><p>If there was news of True Person Xun, Master Gu would send a message.</p><p>Qin Sang also needed to prepare. He would first study Master Gu's years of accumulated insights, the war drum safely stored, awaiting the Daoist Court's teachings to begin its restoration.  Of course, he couldn't neglect his cultivation.</p><p>Qin Sang instructed his sword servant to monitor mail from the White Stone region, then sealed his cave and entered seclusion.</p><p>Unexpectedly, five years passed in the blink of an eye.</p><p>One day, as Qin Sang silently cultivated, a slight movement in his expression indicated that his cave's restriction had been triggered.</p><p>He finished his current cycle of cultivation, putting away the jade bottle containing toxic fruit juice, then rose and opened the door, finding that the Sword-Wielding True Person had emerged from seclusion and stood outside.</p><p>…</p><p>Old friends reunited, drinking together and sharing conversation.</p><p>Qin Sang sipped the immortal wine, frankly asking the question on his mind.</p><p>The Sword-Wielding True Person held his cup, thoughtful.  “You mean Left Venerable Daoist? Indeed, there was some connection between us in the past, but that's long gone.  However, he is a highly respected and virtuous Daoist. Since you have a connection, if you encounter any difficulties, you can ask him for justice.”</p><p></p>
