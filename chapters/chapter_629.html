<h1>Chapter 621: Core Formation</h1><p>Chapter 621: Core Formation</p><p>“Junior Brother Tong, summon your spirit insects and join me in the formation. We must give it our all; leave nothing behind.  This demon is incredibly intelligent and cunning. If things turn south, it will eat the spirit fruit and escape before it’s fully ripe. The other disciples will follow from a distance and observe. Once the large demon is slain, you can deal with the remaining smaller ones.  Any spirit herbs or materials you collect are yours…”</p><p>Over thirty cultivators stood atop the mountain.</p><p>Six were Foundation Establishment cultivators; the rest were only Qi Condensation stage.</p><p>Those at the Qi Condensation stage wore similar robes, each with a strange insect symbol woven into the back.</p><p>If Qin Sang were here, he would recognize Yuan Hu, who had hunted the Blood-winged Hornets with him, among them.</p><p>The speaker was a lean, elderly man, with white hair, kind eyes, and a black wooden staff engraved with strange patterns in blue insect blood.</p><p>The elder was addressing them when a sudden clap of thunder interrupted.</p><p>Everyone’s faces changed, and they quickly ascended into the sky, gazing into the depths of the mountains.</p><p>They saw a massive gathering of dark clouds above a mountain peak to the southwest.  Lightning flashed and thunder roared within the clouds.</p><p>Following that initial thunderclap, continuous booms echoed, the clouds growing thicker, and lightning danced wildly.</p><p>Strangely, these clouds and lightning were confined to the mountaintop and a radius of less than a thousand meters.  Elsewhere, the sky was clear, devoid of any clouds or signs of a storm.</p><p>That area seemed to face the apocalypse; terrifying lightning was perilously close to the mountain peak, threatening to destroy it at any moment.</p><p>The thunder was deafening, shocking all living things.</p><p>Shrieks of terror from birds and beasts echoed around the mountain. Both mundane and demonic creatures, large and small, were terrified and fled.</p><p>The clouds continued to gather, black and oppressive, with howling winds, but still no rain fell.</p><p>Seeing this, the Five Insects Sect cultivators exchanged glances.  Though they had never witnessed such a sight firsthand, they had read of it in their sect’s records. The phenomenon seemed remarkably similar to something described in their texts.</p><p>The lean elder’s face was grim.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>A muffled sound echoed, and the spiritual energy around the mountain peak seemed to be drawn towards the clouds below, leaving the area devoid of spiritual energy.  Below the clouds, something resembling a funnel was taking shape.</p><p>Seeing this, there was no longer any doubt—someone was forming a golden core there!</p><p>“Senior Brother Sect Master, I remember that mountain is the lair of the Black-winged Eagle. Could it be…?”</p><p>Junior Brother Tong flew to the elder's side, his voice trembling.</p><p>If it was a demon beast forming a demon core, the entire Xiong Mountain region, including the Five Insects Sect, would be powerless to resist unless they chose to shut themselves within their sect.</p><p>If it was a bloodthirsty demon, the entire region would be devastated.</p><p>The elder clearly thought of this as well. The veins in his hand gripping the staff bulged as he said gravely, “It shouldn't be that beast. I saw it three years ago; it was only at the mid-Demon Spirit stage. Its potential is nearly maxed out. Even if it consumed some heavenly treasure, the Black-winged Eagle couldn't have leaped from the late Demon Spirit stage to Core Formation in just three years.  And the demon beast core formation seems different from that of cultivators…”</p><p>Junior Brother Tong paused, “Senior Brother, you suspect…?”</p><p>The elder nodded, his expression serious.</p><p>He suspected a cultivator, perhaps passing through or in secluded cultivation, had seized the Black-winged Eagle's lair to form their core.</p><p>A powerful force arriving in their territory wasn't good news for the Five Insects Sect.</p><p>Seeing the phenomenon persist, the elder made a decision.  “Junior Brother Tong, immediately return to the sect with everyone and activate the protective mountain array. Do not let anyone enter the mountain without my order!  As for those large villages, we can't worry about them for now.”</p><p>Junior Brother Tong’s face fell. “Senior Brother, you’re not going back?”</p><p>The elder shook his head. “I can’t leave. We’ve made too much of a commotion; it's impossible to hide this from that person. Leaving now would invite resentment. If it’s a passing cultivator, we'll respectfully send them on their way. If they intend to stay, the Five Insects Sect will eventually have to face them. It’s better to ascertain their intentions sooner rather than later. If I am killed, Junior Brother Tong will take over as sect master and immediately send out messages for help.”</p><p>Junior Brother Tong’s face was filled with anxiety. “Senior Brother, you go back, I’ll stay…”</p><p>“You lack the weight for it!”</p><p>The elder said gravely, “Rest assured, I know what I’m doing.”</p><p>The entire Western Frontier is barren, and our Bear Mountain is no exception.  A cultivator at the Golden Core stage, with such power, why would they be stuck in this insignificant place?  Passing through is the most likely explanation. My earlier arrangements were just precautions.”</p><p>As he spoke, the distant thunder gradually subsided, and the dark clouds dispersed.</p><p>The spiritual energy vortex became increasingly prominent.</p><p>Around the vortex, colorful auspicious clouds began to appear.  For a time, the mountaintop was filled with magnificent clouds that stretched across the sky, a breathtaking sight.</p><p>“Not good!  The auspicious clouds appear, the Golden Core is about to form! You must leave!”</p><p>The wizened elder urged his disciples to leave, adjusted his robes, and flew towards the phenomenon.</p><p>By the time he arrived, the entire mountain peak was enveloped in the radiant clouds.</p><p>After a while, the auspicious clouds dissipated, and the surrounding spiritual energy gradually calmed down, returning to normal.</p><p>The wizened elder waited for a moment, but seeing no activity from the cave dwelling on the mountain, he pondered briefly before flying towards the summit.</p><p>Unexpectedly, a dark shadow suddenly appeared before him as he reached the cave.</p><p>“Hiss…”</p><p>The wizened elder was startled by the ferocious-looking Sky-splitting Rakshasa, and upon sensing its powerful aura, he gasped in shock and awe.</p><p>“Not only did he successfully form a Golden Core, but he also possesses a corpse puppet that has transformed into a Sky-splitting Rakshasa…”</p><p>The wizened elder groaned inwardly, filled with envy for the person inside the cave.</p><p>He wondered what the cultivator's lifebound insect-gu was.  The successful formation of a Golden Core indicated that his lifebound insect-gu likely also completed its transformation.</p><p>This individual, having formed a Golden Core, would instantly surpass his peers, possibly even capable of defeating opponents of higher cultivation levels.  Such a figure would be extremely rare even in the established great sects outside the Western Frontier; perhaps even a descendant of a Nascent Soul cultivator.  The elder felt powerless even to feel envy.</p><p>However, seeing all this, the wizened elder felt relieved.</p><p>The other party's origins were mysterious, possessing a great heritage; they certainly wouldn't covet the resources of Bear Mountain.</p><p>The wizened elder, across from the Sky-splitting Rakshasa, offered a distant bow to the cave dwelling, clearing his throat, and said, “翠玄子, the sect leader of the Five Elements Sect, pays his respects to the senior.”</p><p>‘Bang!’</p><p>The stones in front of the cave dwelling suddenly burst apart.</p><p>翠玄子's pupils constricted as he saw an unusually young man emerge from the darkness.</p><p>Sunlight bathed him, making him appear spirited and full of vigor.</p><p>The young man smiled at him amiably, saying, “Are you the sect leader of the Five Insects Sect? I passed through this area, sensed the aura of Golden Core formation, and found a place to form my own. Luckily, I succeeded, but I seem to have disturbed you.”</p>
