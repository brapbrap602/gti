<h1>Chapter 408 Escape</h1><p>Although the formation was incomplete, a vast aura was brewing within.</p><p>Feng Hai was forced back by the formation, revealing a large opening.</p><p>This aura was beyond what the Black Tortoise bloodline could possess, leading one to wonder if the final form of the formation would manifest the legendary divine beast, the Black Tortoise.</p><p>Sensing danger, the Thunder Swallowing Falcon grew even more frantic. The lightning around it mixed with a faint bloody aura, indicating it was burning its essence blood.</p><p>Its wings spread wide, feathers bristling, bathed in thunder, transforming into a lightning bird.  Its wings commanded the thunder, somehow drawing upon the vast and boundless Frostwind.</p><p>The Frostwind and lightning intertwined, unpredictable and volatile. Countless wind blades and thunderbolts filled the sky, raining down on the Sect Master of Wuji and the cloaked figure.</p><p>The cloaked figure was fully focused on the formation and couldn't move.</p><p>Unable to dodge, the Sect Master of Wuji held his sword horizontally before his chest, its energy forming a giant wall of defense.</p><p>The wall of sword energy only held for a moment before shattering. The Sect Master of Wuji continued to condense new walls, but the sword energy grew increasingly thin, unable to last much longer.</p><p>Fortunately, the cloaked figure's Black Tortoise Shell formation was nearing completion.</p><p>The battle's impact was widespread. The power of Nascent Soul cultivators clashing at full strength was terrifying.</p><p>The earth trembled.</p><p>Countless cracks spread across the glacier, growing denser and denser. The glacier quaked, and ice chunks of all sizes tumbled down.</p><p>Qin Sang reluctantly withdrew his gaze. He longed to witness the earth-shattering clash between the Nascent Soul cultivator's meticulously prepared formation and the essence blood-burning Thunder Swallowing Falcon.</p><p>He wanted to see who would ultimately prevail.</p><p>But he dared not stay. Even if the glacier didn't shatter now, it would surely be destroyed soon, cutting off his escape route.</p><p>Qin Sang flew towards the glacier with all his might, finding the ice cave he had used before, now partially collapsed.</p><p>Glancing back at the distant battlefield, Qin Sang's eyes filled with envy.  He stared for a while, etching the scene into his memory, then turned and rushed into the ice cave.</p><p>The ice cave was filled with large cracks. Qin Sang maneuvered through, passing the place where the Nightbloom Lily grew.  He saw the spirit array was broken and the Nightbloom Lily had been taken by Yun Youzi.</p><p>Yun Youzi himself was nowhere to be seen.</p><p>Continuing his flight, he finally reached the restriction-sealed ice wall.</p><p>As the glacier neared destruction, under the pressure of the world's power, the restrictions on the ice wall flickered, destined to perish with the glacier.</p><p>Qin Sang, now intimately familiar with the restrictions, easily deactivated them and slipped into the ice hall. Finding it empty, he realized Yun Youzi hadn't rested here.</p><p>He likely sensed the changes in the ice cave and didn't dare linger, preferring to refine the Nightbloom Lily in a safer location.</p><p>This was for the best, saving Qin Sang the trouble of explaining.</p><p>Just as he was about to step into the teleportation formation, Qin Sang paused. He suddenly summoned the Five Elements Sword and struck at several weak points in the restriction on the ice wall.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>A crack appeared on the ice wall. Qin Sang retrieved his sword and entered the teleportation formation.</p><p>After he left, the icy wind finally shattered the ice wall, sweeping in and destroying the teleportation formation.</p><p>Qin Sang reappeared in the side chamber.</p><p>Having left the Sky Roc's territory, Qin Sang didn't rush to leave.  He couldn't feel any tremors here, indicating the battle wasn't nearby.</p><p>Moreover, the Boundless Valley was filled with ancient restrictions and warped space, defying common sense.</p><p>He wondered what methods that senior had used to leave a teleportation formation here, allowing one to traverse the inner and outer valleys and infiltrate the Thunder Swallowing Falcon's nest, which was located who knew where, to steal heavenly treasures.</p><p>Sitting cross-legged on the icy path, Qin Sang circulated his cultivation technique. Once his energy sea recovered, he awoke from meditation and eagerly opened his storage pouch to examine the Bloodsoul Mulberry.</p><p>His spiritual sense probed the pouch, and Qin Sang's face suddenly froze.</p><p>Along with the Bloodsoul Mulberry, he had also taken out a few pieces of spirit wood, purchased at great cost in Yin Mountain Pass, which he hadn't yet had the Ebony Sword absorb.</p><p>These spirit woods were originally diverse in shape and color.</p><p>Now, two of them were stained blood red, despite originally being green!</p><p>Not only had they become blood-colored, but their spiritual essence was also completely destroyed, turning them into useless wood.</p><p>Qin Sang had hastily stolen the Bloodsoul Mulberry and only had time to toss it into his storage pouch. It landed between these two pieces of spirit wood, and in such a short time, the spreading bloodlight had corroded them.</p><p>Qin Sang was shocked by the heavy loss, but also thrilled by the Bloodsoul Mulberry's power.</p><p>He enveloped the Bloodsoul Mulberry with spiritual energy.</p><p>After a closer look, Qin Sang suddenly cast multiple restrictions, sealing the bloodlight before storing it back in his pouch.</p><p>He didn't dare let the Ebony Sword absorb the Bloodsoul Mulberry rashly. Once the Ebony Sword refined it, it would transform into a magical treasure, potentially undergoing unknown changes and going out of control.</p><p>He needed to settle down, study it carefully for a while, and plan accordingly.</p><p>Putting away the Bloodsoul Mulberry, Qin Sang checked his storage pouch, a wry smile appearing on his face.</p><p>He hadn't expected this trip to assist Yun Youzi to be so fraught with unexpected events, a series of twists and turns with heavy losses.</p><p>Several useful magical artifacts were destroyed, and he was almost out of丹药. His storage pouch was practically empty, looking rather pathetic.</p><p>His Corpse Puppet pouch was also empty.</p><p>Fortunately, his gains were astonishing.</p><p>He learned how to control magical treasures, gaining a powerful means of self-defense.</p><p>The Bloodsoul Mulberry solved his future worries. At least before forming his Gold Core, he wouldn't need to expend resources searching for spirit wood to enhance the Ebony Sword.</p><p>Of course, Wu Shang's letter was also crucial.  Whether the method worked or not, Wu Shang's guidance showed Qin Sang a path to forming his Gold Core.</p><p>Thinking of Wu Shang's letter, Qin Sang remembered the Heavenly Corpse Talisman within his Nascent Soul.</p><p>He looked inward at his Nascent Soul space.</p><p>A faint yellow light still shone around his Nascent Soul. The Heart-Devouring Insect蛊 lay quietly, dormant.</p><p>His Nascent Soul itself seemed unchanged.</p><p>Qin Sang observed for a while, a thought flashing through his mind. A Buddha image suddenly appeared, and bright yellow light bloomed within his Nascent Soul.  Then, wisps of gray aura were expelled from his Nascent Soul, vanishing completely.</p><p>The Heavenly Corpse Talisman had been purged by the Jade Buddha!</p><p>Qin Sang withdrew his mind from his Nascent Soul space, released the restrictions on his body, opened his eyes, and raised his right hand, clenching it tightly.</p><p>He felt the changes in his body. The corpse transformation had stopped.</p><p>The bloodlust also faded, a slight urge remaining but easily suppressed.</p><p>Because of the short duration, his corpse transformation was shallow. According to Wu Shang, he only needed a few yang-rich spirit herbs to recover, and these were common.</p><p>Qin Sang carefully checked his body, finding no insurmountable problems, and finally let out a long breath, truly at ease.  He stood up and flew outwards.</p>
