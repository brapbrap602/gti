<h1>Chapter 454: The Minor North Star Essence Formation</h1><p>"Old Daoist, the time is up, and the outcome is undecided. It seems we must follow the old rules again."</p><p>Several figures flickered in and out of view in the sky, arrayed on two sides.</p><p>Two figures stood to the north.</p><p>One was a burly, red-haired elder.  He stood on the clouds, exuding an extraordinary aura. His face glowed with ruddy health, his tiger-like eyes radiating a world-conquering majesty and immense pressure. His spiritual energy was incredibly restrained, with no outward fluctuations.</p><p>Unknowingly to many, the red-haired elder's true identity was the Sect Master of the Pure Yang Sect. He was not only a leader of the righteous path but also the acknowledged number one expert in the Small Chill Region!</p><p>The others present were of similar stature. Beside the red-haired elder was a mysterious figure shrouded in rolling demonic energy, their form visible but their features obscured.</p><p>Facing the red-haired elder and the mysterious figure were three others suspended in the air.</p><p>In the center was a wiry old Daoist, clad in a blue robe, holding a horsetail whisk.  He possessed an immortal air and, facing the red-haired elder, his aura was no less imposing. However, his expression was grave as he silently observed the two battlefields below.</p><p>Behind the old Daoist stood two warriors.  Not only were their appearances similar, but their weapons and armor were identical, resembling twin brothers.</p><p>All five of these individuals were Nascent Soul experts.</p><p>Five Nascent Soul ancestors, who usually remained hidden from the world, had appeared simultaneously!</p><p>It was the red-haired elder who spoke.</p><p>The old Daoist withdrew his gaze, looked at the red-haired elder, and pointed his whisk at the Golden Core battlefield.  He said coldly, "It's only been five hours, and you've already been pushed back this far!  Given a few more hours, our side will surely annihilate yours!"</p><p>The red-haired elder roared with laughter, his voice exceptionally resonant, directly countering the old Daoist.  "Old Daoist, you grow more shameless with age. Do you truly believe the Small Chill Region has only these few people? If you're not afraid of the Abyss of Sin exploiting the opportunity to sever your lineage, feel free to attack! This old man will accompany you to the end! Then, I'd like to see if you, a solitary old Daoist, still have the leisure to search for treasures in the Violet Empyrean Palace!"</p><p>"You!"</p><p>"Insolent!"</p><p>The two warriors shouted in unison, taking a step forward, their halberds pointed at the red-haired elder, their battle intent soaring.</p><p>In the next moment, a long啸 resounded as the red-haired elder's aura surged.  A rich crimson energy erupted from him, radiating a supremely yang and righteous aura. His red hair danced wildly, like a descending deity.</p><p>The mysterious figure seemed to be watching a play.</p><p>Without the mysterious figure's assistance, the red-haired elder single-handedly resisted the two Nascent Soul experts.  The crimson energy rampaged, and he didn't fall behind.  Instead, the two warriors gripped their halberds tightly, their expressions extremely grave, as if they were enduring immense pressure.</p><p>The red-haired elder, towering over the two warriors, looked down with disdain.  "Where did these arrogant juniors come from, daring to shout at this old man? What? Do you want to fight this old man first and determine the outcome?"</p><p>"Red-haired old devil, I haven't seen you in decades, and your strength has improved again!  Come back!"</p><p>The old Daoist sighed lightly, waving his whisk. Specks of starlight fell onto the two warriors. He looked deeply at the red-haired elder. "The rules are the same as last time: Foundation Establishment, Golden Core, Nascent Soul, best two out of three."</p><p>The crimson energy pressing down on the two warriors dissipated, and they breathed a sigh of relief, exchanging glances of astonishment.  They silently retreated behind the old Daoist.</p><p>The red-haired elder withdrew his aura and nodded.  "Indeed! The old rules, best two out of three. The wager is the formation materials. The first match will be at Point Sky Peak. Old Daoist, you'd better prepare beforehand, lest you lack materials, have an incomplete formation, and miss the optimal time to open the Violet Empyrean Palace."</p><p>"Don't bother, even if the Heavenly Firmament Alliance is poor, we can still afford a Minor North Star Essence Formation! Let's go!"</p><p>Before his voice faded, the old Daoist and the two warriors vanished.</p><p>At the same time, the Heavenly Firmament Alliance's Foundation Establishment and Golden Core battlefields also received the order.  After a moment of commotion, they retreated in an orderly fashion.</p><p>Qin Sang finally felt relieved when he saw the Heavenly Firmament Alliance retreat, feeling utterly exhausted.</p><p>He sat cross-legged on the water to recover, disregarding his appearance. The others did the same.</p><p>While meditating, Qin Sang gazed at the figures in the sky.  Although no one had introduced them to him, he could guess that they were the Nascent Soul experts of both sides.</p><p>"I wonder if those two Nascent Soul experts are the ones I saw in Boundless Valley?"</p><p>After the three Nascent Soul experts of the Heavenly Firmament Alliance left, Qin Sang stared at the remaining two figures, muttering to himself.</p><p>He didn't recognize any Nascent Soul experts. Despite being a cultivator for so long, he hadn't even seen his own sect's ancestor, Duke Dongyang.</p><p>He wondered about the identities of these two.</p><p>During the three-year standoff, the Nascent Soul experts of both sides hadn't shown themselves.  Why had they suddenly gathered here?</p><p>Could it be because of the beam of light?</p><p>Qin Sang shifted his gaze to the beam, noticing it seemed slightly stronger than last night, but the mirror at its end remained unchanged.</p><p>He hoped no major changes would occur.</p><p>At least... not until he broke through to the Pseudo Core stage.</p><p>Qin Sang prayed silently.</p><p>The more powerful figures he encountered, the more powerless he felt, and his desire to improve his cultivation grew even more urgent.</p><p>He was like a rootless duckweed, drifting along with the overwhelming current, struggling desperately.  A stroke of bad luck could shatter him to pieces.</p><p>Only with sufficient strength could he transcend the current and control his own destiny!</p><p>...</p><p>After the old Daoist and the others left, the mysterious figure suddenly snorted coldly. "It seems the old Daoist is still不服气! In my opinion, we should have mobilized our full force long ago to blockade the Vast Azure Marsh, find Point Sky Peak, and monopolize the Essence Stones.  I'd like to see how they can enter the Violet Empyrean Palace without the Essence Stones!"</p><p>The red-haired elder slowly shook his head.  "Fellow Daoist Tongyou, you're unaware of the situation. I've heard that the Abyss of Sin has become increasingly active and aggressive.  We mustn't push the old Daoist too hard, lest he become desperate and invite a wolf into the house.  That wouldn't be good for us either."</p><p>The mysterious figure turned out to be the Demonic Monarch Tongyou, a Saint Monarch of the Demonic Path.</p><p>One was a leader of the righteous path, the other a Demonic Saint Monarch.  Judging by their conversation, not only were they not at odds, but they seemed to have a considerable level of rapport.</p><p>"The Abyss of Sin..."</p><p>Demonic Monarch Tongyou murmured, his figure flashing and disappearing.</p><p>The red-haired elder glanced down, his lips moving.</p><p>A moment later, he too vanished.</p><p>...</p><p>The vast lake water had long since swallowed all traces of blood.</p><p>After the all-night battle, aside from the wounds on their bodies, it seemed as if no trace remained.</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't fully recovered when he finally heard the order to withdraw.  Dragging his weary body, he returned to the True Water Mirage Formation.</p><p>After entering the Chaotic Islands' waters, Qin Sang dismissed his team. Just as he was about to return to his cave dwelling to rest, he suddenly noticed that the Core Formation experts hadn't dispersed but had entered Stargazing Island together.</p><p>"Could there be something else happening?"</p><p>Thinking of the strange beam of light, Qin Sang felt that things wouldn't end so simply.</p><p>Unfortunately, no one could provide him with answers.</p><p>With doubts and worries, he rode his cloud back to his cave, activated the restrictions, and entered secluded cultivation, awaiting the next battle.</p>
