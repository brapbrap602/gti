<h1>Chapter 914: Subordinates</h1><p>On the Poison Island.</p><p>Qin Sang left his cave dwelling and stood on a hill, looking down at the illusionary array.</p><p>At this time, the three people who had arrived by shuttle had entered Poison Island, triggering the illusionary array.</p><p>Although he wasn't clear on the details, seeing their appearance and the sinister wind chasing after them, Qin Sang could guess what was happening.</p><p>He couldn't help feeling a little helpless. He had been quietly cultivating in his cave, but some troublemakers had disturbed him, forcing him into this situation.</p><p>With his current cultivation, unless a Yuan Ying stage cultivator personally attacked, he wasn't afraid of anyone, but it's better to avoid trouble.</p><p>As Qin Sang pondered how to handle this, upon seeing the actions of the three people after landing on the island, and the cultivation levels of the scholar and the middle-aged woman, his expression changed slightly, showing a thoughtful look.</p><p>Just as Qin Sang was about to go down the mountain to take action, he suddenly narrowed his eyes slightly, staring intently at the outside of Poison Island, and discovered the presence of a shadowy figure.</p><p>“A Golden Core stage ghost, seems to be a demonic cultivator…”</p><p>Qin Sang's face darkened.</p><p>He judged from the momentum and speed of the sinister wind that the cultivators inside were at most Foundation Establishment stage, thinking it was a dispute between Foundation Establishment cultivators, even killing them all would be an easy task.</p><p>Unexpectedly, there was a Golden Core stage cultivator following behind.</p><p>It seemed the situation was more complicated than he thought.</p><p>However, a single Golden Core stage demonic cultivator wasn't enough to change Qin Sang's mind. He glanced indifferently at the shadowy figure, then withdrew his gaze, his figure flashing as he darted down the mountain.</p><p>For safety's sake, Qin Sang summoned his two-headed… beasts, and had them keep a close watch on the illusionary array.</p><p>After landing on Poison Island.</p><p>The scholar and the middle-aged woman entered the poisonous miasma, and acted separately as planned.</p><p>The middle-aged woman took out a gauze curtain and wrapped it around herself and her daughter.</p><p>Having taken Yin Chan Pills, they emitted a faint black aura that blended into the poisonous miasma. Coupled with the capabilities of the red-fringed curtain, a magical artifact, it allowed them to hide themselves effectively.</p><p>The scholar, without looking back, charged into the depths of Poison Island, intending to use himself as bait to lure the Eagle King.</p><p>The middle-aged woman wiped away her tears, resolutely turned, and flew in another direction with her daughter.</p><p>Not long after flying, they both cried out in alarm, discovering they had fallen into a strange illusionary array.</p><p>The illusionary array incorporated the power of the poisonous miasma, and was personally controlled by Qin Sang.  It was something that mere Foundation Establishment cultivators couldn't break.</p><p>The scholar felt dizzy and his expression turned shocked.  He hurriedly bowed towards the void, saying, "Junior doesn't know this is senior's domain, disturbing senior. Please forgive this transgression."</p><p>The illusionary array was eerily silent.</p><p>Just as the scholar was feeling uncertain, a cold, old voice suddenly came from above, saying, "Forgive you? You are audacious! You dared to disturb my cultivation and even brought so many cultivators here. Do you think I wouldn't dare to take your lives?"</p><p>Upon hearing this, the scholar's heart sank, secretly cursing his misfortune.</p><p>This old guy clearly wasn't a kind person.</p><p>He thought it was just a poisonous island, but it turned out to be occupied by this old demon, who had made it into his cultivation ground.</p><p>The Corrupted Winged Eagle King, a being that even Golden Core cultivators feared, had been secretly eliminated by this old demon.  Even the demon nest was occupied, without any rumors outside, showing how powerful the old demon was.</p><p>They hadn't shaken off their pursuers, and had now fallen into a demonic lair.</p><p>"Junior was rude, and is willing to take full responsibility, and accept any punishment. My wife and daughter know nothing of this, I only hope senior will forgive them…"</p><p>A cackling laugh echoed in the air, "Are you referring to them?"</p><p>The poisonous mist in front of the scholar fluctuated, forming a water mirror, reflecting the figures of his wife and daughter. The middle-aged woman and the girl were separated; the girl had already woken up, both of them looking panicked and helpless.</p><p>Seeing this, the scholar's expression tightened, and he immediately knelt down, begging, "I implore senior, they are innocent, please show mercy and don't harm them. I, your junior, will do anything…"</p><p>"Enough!"</p><p>A cold snort came from the air, interrupting the scholar, "Don't act in front of me. Your pursuers have arrived, including that Golden Core stage demonic cultivator. I haven't decided how to deal with you yet, or perhaps I'll simply hand you over to that friend…"</p><p>"Senior, no!"</p><p>The scholar cried out. After discovering the old demon on the island, he had some thoughts, but now he realized he had been seen through by the old demon. In his terror, he hurriedly pleaded.</p><p>"Then it depends on your worth, whether you're worth saving," the voice paused, "Tell me everything about your origins, and why you've angered that person outside. Don't hide a single thing."</p><p>"Any discrepancy in your account regarding your wife and daughter, and I'll cast you all out immediately."</p><p>Qin Sang stood over the scholar, looking down at him, while the scholar remained oblivious.</p><p>He had observed the scholar and his wife's earlier actions.  His decision to help wasn't purely out of compassion.</p><p>Firstly, he didn't want his cave dwelling exposed prematurely. If these people lacked powerful connections, he'd keep them.</p><p>Secondly, Qin Sang needed assistants. This couple's actions demonstrated their deep love for their daughter, making them easily controlled.</p><p>He anticipated a period of intensive cultivation in his cave dwelling, but someone needed to gather the necessary spiritual materials and gather intelligence.</p><p>The scholar and his wife were late-stage and mid-stage Foundation Establishment cultivators, respectively.</p><p>Qin Sang easily discerned that their cultivation techniques were unusual, and their true strength far exceeded their outward appearance.</p><p>Of course, Qin Sang would act within his capabilities. If the couple's enemies were too powerful, involving a Nascent Soul master, even he would be powerless.</p><p>Though terrified by the mysterious cultivator's methods, the scholar, hearing the possibility of his family's survival, felt a mixture of shock and joy.</p><p>"My wife and I are cultivators from White Flame Valley, outside the Riftwind Archipelago. We fled after attracting powerful enemies. For years, we've lived cautiously, hiding, never harming others. Unfortunately, our daughter was discovered by that fiend's underlings during an outing. They learned she possessed a Water Jade body and sought to abduct her as a sacrificial vessel..."</p><p>The scholar's expression shifted, before he finally gritted his teeth and revealed everything, without concealing anything.</p><p>"A Water Jade body?"</p><p>Qin Sang's expression changed slightly. He chuckled, saying, "I've heard that a Water Jade body's energy center condenses Water Jade Qi, remarkably effective for certain similar attribute demonic arts, explaining this incident. White Flame Valley… I haven't heard of it. Now tell me clearly: who are the enemies you provoked, and what is the origin of these people outside?"</p><p>The scholar, relieved that Qin Sang hadn't focused on his daughter, anxiously replied, "White Flame Valley is a minor sect; it's understandable, senior, that you haven't heard of it. Our former enemy is an elder from the Harmony Light Sect. The men outside are a notorious local fiend, the lord of the Sacrifice Demon Cave, and his followers..."</p>
