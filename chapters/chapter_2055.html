<h1>Chapter 2046: Foundation</h1><p>Qin Sang followed the instructions. Luo Hua Zhenren formed the Unhindered Seal, splitting it into six beams of spell light, one of which shot towards him.</p><p>Suppressing his instincts, Qin Sang allowed the spell light to land on him. He immediately felt a strange spiritual energy within his body. When he tried to grasp it, the energy dissipated.</p><p>Vaguely, Qin Sang felt a new connection within him, directed towards Luo Hua Zhenren.</p><p>This connection was rather profound, like a channel opened between him and Luo Hua Zhenren. However, Qin Sang's mind remained clear, without any sense of being controlled or deceived.</p><p>Luo Hua Zhenren stopped, quietly observing everyone.</p><p>Everyone focused their senses for a moment, then opened their eyes. They had confirmed that the Unhindered Seal posed no significant threat to them. At least, Luo Hua Zhenren couldn't control them with it. They calmed themselves, but retained a degree of vigilance, awaiting further instructions.</p><p>Luo Hua Zhenren nodded. "Everyone, please refine the spirit materials before you according to the predetermined method!"</p><p>With that, Luo Hua Zhenren gently shook the dust whisk in his hand. The bristles spread open, countless silver threads shooting downwards. Some clung to the precious furnace, others pierced into the raised platform. Everyone saw only a flash of silver light, the objects within obscured by the radiance.</p><p>Qin Sang sensed briefly, finding that he could no longer perceive the spiritual treasure. He wasn't worried; as long as Luo Hua Zhenren needed their help in the refinement, they would eventually be shown it.</p><p>His gaze fell upon the spirit material before him. Without hesitation, he drew one item towards himself.</p><p>It was a chicken-egg-sized, perfectly round white stone, called a Turbid Wave Stone.</p><p>It was said that from the moment a Turbid Wave Stone was born, it would first form a cocoon-like outer shell. When the interior had developed to a certain extent, it would form a second layer, and so on. Each layer formed made it purer, eventually resulting in multiple thin shells and the purest spiritual energy within.</p><p>The shells were incredibly fragile. Once broken, the spiritual energy would immediately dissipate. The same was true during refinement; there was no way to slow down or preserve the energy. Therefore, refining this material required first transforming the layers of shells into formless energy, enveloping the spiritual energy without affecting the crafting process.</p><p>At Luo Hua Sect, Qin Sang had already learned the properties of these treasures, making the refining process familiar.</p><p>Before him, the Turbid Wave Stone's shells were peeled away layer by layer, each layer with unique patterns, as varied as ocean waves.</p><p>He proceeded step by step, without a single misstep, until the white stone disappeared, leaving only a single drop of 'water'. The surface of the water droplet seemed to be enveloped by an invisible membrane.</p><p>He carefully moved it aside and summoned the next spirit material, refining each item one by one.</p><p>While busy, Qin Sang suddenly sensed something. He paused slightly, looking towards the precious furnace. Luo Hua Zhenren had withdrawn the dust whisk at some point, and the platform and furnace felt completely different.</p><p>"So it's an ingenious spirit array. The furnace gains a significant boost from the array. I wonder if this array is universally applicable, or if it only works with this particular furnace?"</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at the raised platform, this thought crossing his mind. He could tell that this furnace was quite extraordinary.</p><p>Whether alchemists or artificers, most had their own furnaces and cauldrons, used for refining pills and crafting treasures with twice the result for half the effort. Qin Sang mused that he hadn't found a suitable one yet, and it was time to seek one out for himself.</p><p>He couldn't help but think of the green copper block he had obtained from the Violet Firmament Palace. Its original form was unknown, whether it was a crafting cauldron or an alchemy furnace. Perhaps he could draw some inspiration from it.</p><p>Stray thoughts flashed through his mind, quickly suppressed by Qin Sang as he continued to focus on refining the spirit materials.</p><p>At this time, Luo Hua Zhenren glanced around. After everyone had finished refining, he flicked his dust whisk, sprinkling down specks of pure light.</p><p>‘Clang! Clang! Clang!…’</p><p>The platform’s array activated, the precious furnace vibrating violently.</p><p>"Everyone, please immediately enter meditation, into a state of selflessness!" Luo Hua Zhenren commanded once more. At the same time, the platform radiated spiritual light, six beams enveloping everyone.</p><p>Qin Sang sank into meditation. He immediately felt a force from the spirit array descend, his body engulfed by the spiritual light.</p><p>Luo Hua Zhenren's expression was serious. He held the dust whisk in one hand and formed a seal with the other, chanting incantations. Finally, with a low shout, he pressed his palm downwards.</p><p>At that moment, Qin Sang, in meditation, suddenly felt the Unhindered Seal emit a strange fluctuation, not his own, yet harmonizing with his own power. This fluctuation guided him invisibly, urging him to do something.</p><p>If he had intended to resist, he could have suppressed it, but doing so would have affected the treasure refinement.</p><p>He didn't resist, like an observer, watching his own hands form a seal – a secret art he had never cultivated, yet performed flawlessly.</p><p>Others felt the same as Qin Sang, though each person's seal was different. In the end, they all struck towards the raised platform.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>A vast spiritual light shot skyward, as if to overturn the heavens.</p><p>Outside the fire chamber, Luo Hua Sect cultivators were on high alert, casting spells to conceal the fluctuations of spiritual energy.</p><p>Everyone awoke from their meditation, immediately feeling different. They seemed to have become the masters of the platform’s spirit array, and felt closer to the furnace. However, each person could only control a sub-array; the true master was still Luo Hua Zhenren.</p><p>Looking at Luo Hua Zhenren, his aura was slightly unstable. Evidently, guiding six people to cast spells simultaneously was no easy task, and this was just the beginning. There were more challenges to overcome.</p><p>Luo Hua Zhenren closed his eyes and adjusted his breath for a moment. Then, with another command, Qin Sang and the others activated their respective sub-arrays.</p><p>The purpose of this array was to assist in refinement. Unless one had a deep understanding of the art of crafting, it would be difficult to fully utilize the array's power. Qin Sang naturally had no such worries. He silently activated the spirit array, drawing in a mass of refined spirit material essence.</p><p>The spirit material essence fell into the array and was immediately dispersed by the array's power, transforming into wisps of refined energy. Guided by the array, it underwent another transformation, finally merging into the precious furnace.</p><p>Others were doing the same. Luo Hua Zhenren bore the heaviest responsibility, carefully refining the spiritual treasure to avoid damaging its spiritual nature, while guiding these essences to be methodically refined into the furnace.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang's heart stirred. He finally sensed the spiritual treasure within the furnace.</p><p>An image appeared in his mind: a jade ruler floating quietly within the flames. The ruler was quite thick, less than a foot long, with a white surface and a bluish-green light fluctuating within.</p><p>Qin Sang clearly felt a spirit embryo gestating within the jade ruler.</p><p>This spiritual treasure was about to undergo a transformation. Judging by its spiritual nature, although Little Five was unique and incomparable, Cloud Wanderer Sword wasn't much inferior.</p><p>Did this mean that Cloud Wanderer Sword was also close to transforming?</p><p>Exploring on his own, without any reference, Qin Sang didn't know how far Cloud Wanderer Sword had progressed. Considering that it had been nurtured for nearly six hundred years after receiving essence and enlightenment from the Violet Firmament Child, it should be time for a spirit to manifest!</p><p>Perhaps Cloud Wanderer Sword would take that step before Little Five.</p><p>Due to the numerous karmic implications of the *Violet Firmament Sword Scripture*, even after Cloud Wanderer Sword advanced to a Postnatal Spiritual Treasure, he wouldn't dare to use it in combat lightly, and it might not provide much assistance. However, with a true spirit residing within the sword, it would finally be revealed whether Cloud Wanderer Zi could be reborn!</p><p>Qin Sang's thoughts raced, but his actions remained unaffected. Sensing Luo Hua Zhenren's urging, he sped up the array's operation.</p><p>Refined essences of various spirit materials flowed into the precious furnace, causing flames of different colors to appear within. Under Luo Hua Zhenren's control, the power of the spirit flames grew stronger and stronger. Finally, a glaze appeared on the surface of the jade ruler, a sign of melting.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Luo Hua Sect's refining technique was far more intense than they had imagined. Luo Hua Zhenren once again guided everyone to perform the secret art. A booming explosion echoed from the furnace. When Qin Sang came out of his meditative state, he discovered that the jade ruler had completely exploded into powder. Surprisingly, the spirit embryo remained unharmed.</p><p>Roaring flames erupted from the furnace's mouth, Luo Hua Zhenren bathed in the firelight.</p><p>Everyone knew that the most crucial moment had arrived. With unwavering focus, they assisted Luo Hua Zhenren with all their might, maintaining the powder's cohesive energy and refining the various essences. As time passed, the refined spirit material essences around them were mostly consumed.</p><p>Luo Hua Zhenren activated the Unhindered Seal again. This time, it lasted longer than before, and the secret art employed was far more complex.</p><p>Qin Sang felt a series of seals being cast through him. Due to being in meditation, he could only perceive the spirit embryo's existence, unaware of how the jade ruler had transformed.</p><p>An unknown amount of time passed. Qin Sang suddenly sensed a stir within the spirit embryo, as if a living being was gestating within. The originally chaotic spiritual nature was transforming, about to give birth to true consciousness.</p><p>It was like a seed sprouting, at the very beginning of germination.</p><p>"How did Luo Hua Zhenren achieve this?"</p><p>Qin Sang was extremely curious, but he couldn't make any movements, lest he disturb the Unhindered Seal.</p><p>Perhaps Luo Hua Zhenren had refined some unknown spirit material, but it was definitely closely related to this secret art. Unfortunately, Luo Hua Zhenren was only using him to perform a part of the secret art. Even if he discussed it with Shuang Hua Furen and the others later, they wouldn't be able to deduce the complete secret art, as the key lay solely with Luo Hua Zhenren.</p><p>Such sect secrets couldn't be divulged. Qin Sang could only wait for the jade ruler's refinement to be complete and comprehend the incomplete secret art, which would still yield considerable gains.</p><p>The emergence of spirituality was a very long process.</p><p>Everyone lost track of time, like sculptures, only the firelight flickering within the fire chamber.</p><p>…</p><p>Unknowingly, half a year had passed.</p><p>Outside the fire chamber, Luo Hua Sect cultivators formed an array, patiently waiting.</p><p>Apart from the intense fluctuations emanating from the fire chamber in the initial period, it had been exceptionally quiet.</p><p>"Why hasn't there been any reaction from inside? I wonder how far the refinement has progressed…"</p><p>Bored, the cultivators within the array communicated through sound transmission.</p><p>"The sect is being so cautious, what's strange about it taking a year or two?"</p><p>Another cultivator shook his head, about to say something more when his expression suddenly changed.</p><p>At the same time, everyone sensed something, gazing towards the fire chamber in unison. Instinctively, they activated the grand array to its fullest, a thick gray fog isolating the fire chamber from the outside world.</p><p>Inside the fire chamber, everyone was startled awake. The instant Qin Sang opened his eyes, he looked not at the precious furnace, but at Luo Hua Zhenren.</p><p>Luo Hua Zhenren's face was pale and haggard with exhaustion.</p><p>Qin Sang quickly scanned the area, but couldn't find any traces of remaining spirit materials. He sighed inwardly, giving up and turning his attention to the precious furnace.</p><p>At this moment, Luo Hua Zhenren ceased all movements.</p><p>Everyone sensed that the spirit embryo in the furnace had reached a critical juncture. This was a crucial step; if it could be overcome, it would be a earth-shattering transformation!</p><p>In an instant, the spirit embryo emitted intense fluctuations.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The spiritual flames within the furnace alternately dispersed and converged, unstable.</p><p>The spirit embryo's tremors grew more violent, as if a consciousness within desperately wanted to break through the embryonic wall and be reborn!</p><p>At that moment, Qin Sang raised his head, his gaze seemingly piercing through the dome, towards the heavens. He felt a familiar aura converging towards them, imbued with heavenly might – the aura of heavenly tribulation!</p><p>Others felt it too. Quan Zhenren's face lit up with excitement.</p><p>The heavenly tribulation was brewing. Was it about to succeed?</p><p>Outside the fire chamber, the Luo Hua Sect cultivators were in a commotion.</p><p>Heavenly tribulation couldn't be concealed. Now, the tribulation was only in its initial brewing stage, its aura still faint, barely masked by the grand array. Once the tribulation descended, cultivators in Yanling City would sense it.</p><p>However, once the spirit was born and the heavenly tribulation was triggered, there would be no need to conceal it!</p><p>"I wonder what the heavenly tribulation of a spiritual treasure looks like?"</p><p>Qin Sang looked at Luo Hua Zhenren, only to find him the calmest of all. He couldn't help but wonder, could there be another unforeseen event?</p><p>As this thought arose, Qin Sang saw a flicker of regret in Luo Hua Zhenren's eyes.</p><p>The next moment, the spirit flames within the precious furnace abruptly contracted. The surging spiritual energy exploded, not in transformation, but in an overload-induced explosion. Chaotic power surged out from the furnace's mouth.</p><p>The aura of the heavenly tribulation instantly dispersed.</p><p>"Sect Master!"</p><p>Quan Zhenren cried out in disbelief, unable to accept this outcome.</p><p>It had failed!</p><p>Even though Qin Sang and the others weren't Luo Hua Sect cultivators, they couldn't help but feel regret. This might have been their only chance to 'personally' refine a Postnatal Spiritual Treasure in their lifetime.</p><p>"It seems we were too hasty. After all, the foundation is insufficient, resulting in failure."</p><p>Luo Hua Zhenren sighed. His true essence transformed into a large hand, reaching into the precious furnace, stirring the chaotic energy and retrieving the jade ruler. The transformation had failed, but the ruler wasn't destroyed, although it had lost most of its spiritual energy and would likely take a long time to recover.</p><p>The spirit materials were all wasted, rendering Luo Hua Sect's meticulous preparations futile. This was a significant blow to the morale of the Luo Hua Sect cultivators.</p><p>"The sect has been preparing for so long, how could it fail! How, how…" Quan Zhenren couldn't accept it, his gaze filled with worry as he looked at Luo Hua Zhenren.</p><p>"Brother Quan, don't worry. Even if this attempt failed, I still have another chance. However, there's no turning back next time; it'll be an all-or-nothing gamble. These fellow Daoists are all trustworthy individuals, with no ties to those factions. After Brother Quan becomes the Sect Master, remember to maintain contact with them. They will be valuable allies in the future."</p><p>Luo Hua Zhenren offered words of comfort through sound transmission. He then withdrew the Unhindered Seal from everyone, saying aloud, "Thank you all for your assistance. Please return to the sect to rest and recover."</p><p>Everyone felt their bodies lighten, freed from a layer of constraint. They exchanged glances, seeing the calmness on Luo Hua Zhenren's face, unsure of how to offer consolation.</p><p>Tong Hu Zhenren bowed. "This setback is not what any of us desired. If your esteemed sect wishes to refine this treasure again in the future, just let us know. This poor Daoist will definitely come to assist, without asking for any reward!"</p><p>Everyone echoed his sentiment. Qin Sang nodded silently, still pondering Luo Hua Zhenren's earlier words.</p><p>"Insufficient foundation... what does this foundation refer to? Little Five was born from the Demonic Child, devoured it, and was then enlightened by the Violet Firmament Child. Cloud Wanderer Sword benefited even more from the Violet Firmament Child. I wonder if their foundations are sufficient?"</p>
