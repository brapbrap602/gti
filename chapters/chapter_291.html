<h1>Chapter 284: Suspicions</h1><p>Sheng Yuanzi, with his white hair and beard, looked like a Daoist priest with an immortal air, similar in age to Yun Youzi. However, his mocking expression and tone clashed sharply with his otherwise dignified appearance.</p><p>Before Yu Kong could respond, another voice interjected, “Old bull-nose, you’re no better than Old Ghost Yu.  I advise you all to be cautious, lest you be sold by these two old ghosts and still help them count their money.”</p><p>Luo Xingnan had arrived.</p><p>Qin Sang was secretly surprised.  His previous investigation had revealed that after their last departure from Autumn Firmament Market, Yu Kong and the other two had never collaborated again. Even this time, they were each acting independently, seemingly determined to never cross paths again. He hadn't expected their animosity to be so deep.</p><p>With such a critical situation at hand, they were openly undermining each other.</p><p>Sheng Yuanzi snorted coldly, retorting, “Old Ghost Luo, you are the most insidious.  In my opinion, the deaths of Fellow Daoist Shao and the others can't be separated from you!”</p><p>Luo Xingnan scoffed, “Old bull-nose, you always point fingers at others. And Old Ghost Yu is a silent, biting dog! If I hadn't been cautious and suspicious of you two, I would have been swallowed whole and skinned alive by you long ago!”</p><p>…</p><p>After a heated exchange, Sheng Yuanzi's forehead bulged with veins. Despite being insulted to his face, Yu Kong's expression remained calm, and his tone even, as if the “old dog” they were referring to wasn't him.</p><p>“Before Fellow Daoist Shao and the others met their demise, I was the only one who never had any contact with them. I also don't understand what kind of treasure could make you disregard the bonds of fellowship and resort to murder!”</p><p>Yu Kong shook his head and sighed, “No matter how eloquently you speak, I trust none of you now. Regardless of who the culprit is, it has nothing to do with me.  I'm not young anymore, and I just want to focus on my cultivation and strive to form my Gold Core soon. Let's all forget about each other.”</p><p>Yu Kong cupped his hands, ceasing his argument. Turning to Qin Sang and the others, he said,</p><p>“The Spirit Treasure Pavilion I've chosen specializes in defensive and trapping formations. Its offensive capabilities are only average. There's no possibility of a scapegoat.</p><p>Of course, the treasures within this pavilion are inferior to those in the most dangerous ones.  You all can weigh the pros and cons yourselves.</p><p>Fellow Daoists, don't be swayed by their words. Focus on breaking the formation. When we reach the Spirit Treasure Pavilion, you'll see whether my words are true or false. If any of you decide to withdraw then, I certainly won't stop you.”</p><p>With that, Yu Kong ignored Luo Xingnan and Sheng Yuanzi, summoning a cloud beneath his feet and flying towards the swarm of Cloud Beasts.</p><p>Sheng Yuanzi and Luo Xingnan glared at each other, finding the situation pointless, and flicked their sleeves as they departed.</p><p>Having witnessed this spectacle, everyone had different thoughts. Some showed worry in their eyes, while others appeared unfazed, their thoughts unreadable.</p><p>Qin Sang exchanged glances with Yun Youzi and Ge Yuan in the distance. They had gleaned quite a bit of information from the previous conversation.</p><p>It seemed that thirty years ago, something had indeed happened between these three and Shao Chunhui and his companions, leading to Shao Chunhui's death and mutual suspicion among the three old men.  They just didn't know if the catalyst was the medicinal garden.</p><p>Unfortunately, all three of them were putting on a good act, making it impossible to discern who was telling the truth.</p><p>It was even possible that none of them were the culprit, and the killer was someone else entirely.</p><p>If that were the case, Qin Sang and Yun Youzi could only accept reality, grab a few items, and return to Hanging Skull Pass.</p><p>At that moment, led by the elder, the cultivators at the mid Foundation Formation stage and above formed a battle formation and charged directly into the swarm of Cloud Beasts.</p><p>The nest erupted into chaos.</p><p>Countless bizarre Cloud Beasts, flying and running, poured out. Qin Sang and the others didn't dare to hesitate, quickly summoning their magical artifacts and bracing themselves.</p><p>The fierce battle lasted for eight days.  Many newly arrived cultivators joined the fray, including a Gold Core cultivator who unexpectedly appeared and played a crucial role.</p><p>It was Qin Sang's first time experiencing such a large-scale hunt. He obtained a considerable number of spirit-infused demonic materials, enough to earn a decent profit upon his return.</p><p>Finally, all the Cloud Beasts were eliminated.</p><p>The subterranean passage had undergone noticeable changes three days prior. The light within had become increasingly dim and weak. Now, it could only reach a height of about ten feet, a far cry from its previous imposing presence.</p><p>The Gold Core cultivator flew to the entrance of the passage, briefly probed it, and then flashed inside. The formation reacted instantly, emitting blade-like rays of light, but none could harm him.  In the blink of an eye, he disappeared.</p><p>So many people outside could only watch, lamenting their own inferiority.</p><p>After waiting for a long while, until evening, the protective formation finally weakened!</p><p>Accompanied by a deafening roar, streaks of light, like meteors, shot into the air, racing towards the cavern, illuminating the area like daylight.</p><p>Qin Sang and the others, closely surrounding Yu Kong, formed the Guiyuan Formation before even entering the cavern.  Others did much the same.</p><p>"Everyone, be careful!"</p><p>The cavern's entrance loomed, dark and ominous.</p><p>Yu Kong shouted, leading everyone in a leap into the cavern.</p><p>The instant they entered, Qin Sang's vision was filled with blinding white light. He couldn't even see the Xiu sisters right next to him, only sensing their presence through the Guiyuan Formation's energy.</p><p>Immediately after, a strange force pressed in from all directions. Qin Sang felt like he was sinking in quicksand, every movement a struggle.</p><p>Yu Kong, experienced and prepared, channeled everyone's combined power the moment the pressure hit. This power transformed into a massive blade of energy, cleaving a path forward.</p><p>Unable to see what lay ahead, they could only trust Yu Kong, following the path carved by the energy blade. After a short flight, they felt a sudden lightness as the oppressive force, along with the blinding light, vanished.</p><p>Their vision returned, but before they could take in their surroundings, Yu Kong's voice echoed in their minds, "We're inside the formation! Take the spirit pills immediately!"</p><p>Everyone quickly consumed the pills, replenishing their depleted spiritual energy, and then looked around.</p><p>They were in a vast, empty space, standing in the void. Above, below, and all around, there was nothing solid, only a hazy green mist, darker below and brighter above.</p><p>The entire space was deathly silent.</p><p>Yu Kong's expression was grave. "This is the Wind Formation," he said, his voice low. "That green mist may seem calm, but it's likely a corrosive wind!"</p><p>"I can't see anything," Yueya Xian said, a slight frown somehow adding to her allure.  "Senior Yu, did you encounter this formation the last time you entered the Immortal's Abode?"</p><p>Yu Kong shook his head. "No, last time it was the Fire Formation. As soon as we entered, we were engulfed in flames that threatened to incinerate us. I've heard the Wind Formation is just as violent. I don't know why it's so calm here. It seems something has changed."</p>
