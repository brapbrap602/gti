<h1>Chapter 2102:  To Fight External Evils, First Pacify Internal Strife</h1><p>Chapter 2103:  To Fight External Evils, First Pacify Internal Strife</p><p>Spring was warm and the sun shone brightly.</p><p>Yet, everyone felt a chill like an ice cellar within Qingyang Temple.</p><p>Those with impure intentions, the factions who hadn't timely reinforced the Northern Sea, had been restless and apprehensive since receiving the invitation.  Lacking the courage to refuse, they could only steel themselves and attend the ceremony.</p><p>Upon arrival at Qingyang Temple, they were treated with utmost courtesy, bathed in a gentle spring breeze of hospitality. The harmonious atmosphere created a false impression - that today was a day of great celebration for Qingyang Temple.  With powerful enemies lurking outside, for the sake of the bigger picture, Qingyang Temple might choose not to pursue the matter of their dereliction.</p><p>Now they realized how wrong they were.  In an instant, everyone felt threatened; some fidgeted nervously, their hearts pounding with fear.</p><p>“After such immense sacrifices, when the situation had only slightly improved, some couldn't wait to jump out and seize the fruits of victory!  For their own selfish gains, they disregarded gratitude and the lives of their allies!  What’s even more laughable is that true victory is still far off.  They didn't anticipate that the Changyou Clan Chief would break through to the second level of the Empty Realm at this time.”</p><p>Qin Sang's voice was filled with scorn. “If this humble Daoist hadn’t arrived in time, what would have happened? You were standing on the precipice of disaster without realizing it, yet internally you were still scheming and backstabbing, throwing away the last sliver of hope!”</p><p>No one could offer a rebuttal. Only Qin Sang's voice reverberated through Qingyang Temple, a deafening wake-up call.</p><p>Some felt ashamed, some were filled with righteous indignation, and others were consumed by fear.</p><p>“Perhaps some are thinking, now that this humble Daoist has returned, even if the sky falls, someone will hold it up.  As long as I hold back the Changyou Clan Chief, the situation isn't so dire.” Qin Sang surveyed the crowd, a cold smile playing on his lips. “Those who harbor such thoughts are nothing more than frogs in a well, with the vision of a mouse!”</p><p>Amidst a chorus of gasps, Qin Sang raised his head, gazing at the vast expanse beyond Qingyang Temple, his voice soft and distant.</p><p>“Having fought the Changyou Clan for many years, you should know that they are but one tribe within the Otherfolk.  Beyond the Changyou Clan, there are other tribes.  But do you know how many tribes the Otherfolk have? Do you know their strength?”</p><p>No one could answer his questions, so Qin Sang answered himself.</p><p>“The Otherfolk are divided into High Tribes and Vassal Tribes based on their strength.  The Changyou Clan is a vassal tribe of the Zhuyan Clan, and their strength ranks at the very bottom among the Vassal Tribes.</p><p>“And the Zhuyan Clan isn't even the strongest among the High Tribes.  These High Tribes, led by the Yuren Clan, form the Heavenly Division.  There's also the equally powerful Water Division, led by the Jiaoren Clan.</p><p>“Strong Vassal Tribes have experts of the second level of the Empty Realm, equivalent to Void Refinement cultivators.  And the High Tribes certainly possess mighty figures equivalent to the Body Integration stage, though they have long since withdrawn from worldly affairs.</p><p>“As for the Yuren and Jiaoren Clans, their strength is unfathomable, beyond our comprehension!”</p><p>Hearing Qin Sang's words, everyone finally understood the full picture. Although they had made various speculations before, they had greatly underestimated the Otherfolk.</p><p>The Otherfolk's strength was beyond their imagination.  The tiny Storm Realm had no chance against them.  Qin Sang's assessment was accurate: they truly were frogs in a well.</p><p>“This is our predicament. Once the Changyou Clan realizes they are no match for us, they will seek help from other tribes. But we have no one to rely on. Are there still those who believe that repelling the Changyou Clan will allow us to rest easy and carve up the Storm Realm among ourselves?”</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze swept across the faces of the crowd. Everyone averted their eyes, not daring to meet his gaze.</p><p>“Perhaps some will ask, are there only Otherfolk in the vast world?  Are there no Humans, Wu Clans, or Yao Clans? There are, and their strength is no less than that of the Otherfolk.”</p><p>Before anyone could express a glimmer of hope, Qin Sang's expression darkened, and he shook his head slightly. "But they are billions of miles away from us.  Moreover, this is the heartland of the Otherfolk.  No one will risk coming to our rescue."</p><p>The hope they had just glimpsed was cruelly shattered by Qin Sang, and morale plummeted.</p><p>Everyone was lost in despair.  This was clearly a dead end, and they saw no hope of breaking free.</p><p>Even those who suspected Qin Sang was exaggerating dared not question him openly.</p><p>“This is the situation we face.  To survive here, we can only rely on ourselves.  Don't despair.  This humble Daoist was born and raised here.  Having returned, I will not sit idly by and watch the Storm Realm and all living beings perish.  But this humble Daoist alone is not enough. We need everyone to work together to have even a sliver of a chance!”</p><p>Qin Sang's voice gradually rose, a call to action that stirred the hearts of the crowd.</p><p>But then, his tone took a sharp turn. “Precisely because of this, those who endanger us all must be eliminated!”</p><p>“Bring them forth!”</p><p>His shout was like thunder, pulling everyone back to reality from their momentary excitement.</p><p>A beam of azure light shot from the ground towards the clouds, transforming into a long staircase.  Disciples from Qingyang Temple's Enforcement Hall escorted several cultivators, walking briskly upwards.</p><p>Everyone stared intently, seeing that these individuals all wore ashen expressions.</p><p>“Eh? Isn’t that Old Devil Hong?  This old devil disappeared after ascending.  I thought he was dead.  I didn't expect he’d broken through to the Nascent Soul stage…”</p><p>Someone recognized the leading Hong.</p><p>“I recognize that one. He’s the great fiend of the Canglang Sea. It’s said that to cultivate his evil techniques, he slaughtered his entire clan, young and old.  Every time he appears, he massacres entire families.  He's extremely rampant…”</p><p>“This one’s Daoist name is Yuan Gui.  He loves to exploit others' kindness.  Countless small sects have been annihilated by him, and their deaths were incredibly gruesome.”</p><p>…</p><p>Old Devil Hong and the others were identified one after another, their heinous crimes laid bare for all to see, too numerous to record.</p><p>This wasn't surprising. Those gathered by Old Devil Hong were all villains of the worst kind.</p><p>Everyone was curious why Qingyang Temple had captured these fiends.</p><p>The Enforcement Hall disciples brought Old Devil Hong and the others before the main peak and bowed respectfully.</p><p>Qin Sang said indifferently, “Speak. What have you done?”</p><p>Old Devil Hong's lips moved, his eyes vacant.  His voice was flat and emotionless as he recounted their deeds, holding nothing back.</p><p>“After the last battle for the Azure Spirit Qi, the Flood Dragon King approached us and asked us to work for him. Decades ago, when news of Qingyang Temple’s re-establishment spread, the Flood Dragon King instructed us to secretly contact General Minshan of the Changyou Clan. In the end, we revealed this matter to the Changyou Clan, leading them to the Northern Sea…”</p><p>These words were like a bombshell.</p><p>The crowd erupted in an uproar. The timing of the Changyou Clan's attack was so precise; it turned out someone had informed them, and the mastermind was actually the Yao Clan of the Yao Sea.</p><p>Back then, if it weren't for Fairy Liuli leading the Central Continent and Northern Sea to their aid, the Yao Clan of the Yao Sea would have become prisoners of the Changyou Clan.  Now they dared to bite the hand that fed them.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes flashed. “Bring forth the Flood Dragon King.”</p><p>‘Clang!’</p><p>Chains rattled.  Several thick black chains emerged from the clouds, taut and strained, pulling a colossal creature from the ground below.  It was the Flood Dragon King, in his true Yao form.</p><p>Late Nascent Soul stage!</p><p>Seeing the Flood Dragon King’s cultivation level, everyone understood why he had betrayed them.  This arrogant Yao was clearly not content with being subservient.</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>The Flood Dragon King roared repeatedly, unwilling to be imprisoned, struggling frantically, churning the clouds and wind. His aura was still as ferocious as ever.</p><p>The chains tightened, clanging loudly, as if about to be broken by the Flood Dragon King.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>A bolt of lightning appeared out of nowhere, striking down mercilessly.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The lightning flashes seared everyone's eyes. Three consecutive bolts, like divine punishment, struck the Flood Dragon King with unerring accuracy.</p><p>When the lightning dissipated, the Flood Dragon King was left bloodied and mangled, lying无力ly on the sea of clouds, his eyes filled not with arrogance, but with utter despair.</p><p>Witnessing the miserable state of this peerless ferocious Yao, a deep reverence filled everyone's hearts.</p><p>“Besides you, who else was involved in this plot?” Qin Sang finally spoke, his voice calm, as if he wasn't interrogating a criminal.</p><p>The Flood Dragon King’s spirit was completely broken.  He only wished for a swift death. Like a walking corpse, he answered, “Golden Toad King, Phoenix Queen, Blood Swine King, White-headed Eagle King…”</p><p>It was like the Yama King calling out names.</p><p>Every time the Flood Dragon King uttered a name, someone from the Yao Sea’s seats paled, and a chain shot out from the sea of clouds.</p><p>The Phoenix Queen was the first to suffer.  The chain arrived in an instant.</p><p>The chain’s speed was too fast.  The Phoenix Queen was startled and opened her mouth to speak, but it was too late.  In her fright, colorful light shimmered behind her, revealing the phantom of a phoenix.  She raised her jade-like neck and instantly shifted into her Yao form, spreading her wings and soaring into the sky.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the chain carried a terrifying pressure. The Phoenix Queen's mind was assaulted, her body stiffened.  A sharp pain coursed through her as she was bound by the chains and thrown down beside the Flood Dragon King.</p><p>‘Thump! Thump! Thump!’</p><p>One by one, the Yao Kings were bound and tossed down, utterly humiliated.</p><p>Only Yuan Zhu remained composed at the table, sighing inwardly.</p><p>“Great True One, please hear me!”</p><p>The Phoenix Queen dared not struggle, crying out, “This junior was not the mastermind. The masterminds were the Flood Dragon King and the Golden Toad King.  By the time this junior knew, it was already too late.  This junior dared not defy them and could only submit.  Please, Great True One, see the truth!”</p><p>Her pleas had an effect. Qin Sang didn't simply accept the Flood Dragon King's words, but verified them through various sources, identifying the true masterminds.</p><p>Qin Sang looked down at the Phoenix Queen and the other Yao. “Your crimes are grave.  Though you were not the masterminds, your death sentence can be commuted, but you cannot escape punishment. You are all demoted to Yao soldiers, as a warning to others!”</p><p>He waved his sleeve, scattering talismans that embedded themselves into the foreheads of the Phoenix Queen and the other Yao. No one dared resist, allowing the talismans to enter.  They immediately felt a new constraint within them, their lives and deaths no longer under their own control.</p><p>The chains retracted, and the Yao didn't dare move.</p><p>Seeing these powerful Yao prostrate before the main peak of Qingyang Temple, trembling with fear, without a trace of their former regal pride, the onlookers felt a mixture of pity and apprehension.</p><p>Qin Sang continued interrogating the Flood Dragon King.  “Besides the Yao Sea, who else knew?”</p><p>“We intended to form an alliance with King Yu and the Dragon Whale Holy King.  They didn’t agree. However, we dispatched a large army back to the Yao Sea, which certainly couldn't have escaped the notice of the Eastern Sea.  He must have tacitly approved…”</p><p>Everyone’s gaze shifted to the Eastern Sea’s seats. The Dragon Whale’s expression changed dramatically. He hadn’t expected this old Flood Dragon to drag him down with him as he died.</p><p>“Nonsense!”</p><p>The Dragon Whale slammed his fist on the table and rose to his feet. Suddenly, he felt two sharp gazes piercing him, and he instantly felt as if doused with ice water, a chill running down his spine.</p><p>“Did you truly know nothing?”</p><p>“I…”</p><p>Facing Qin Sang’s sharp gaze, the Dragon Whale felt his heart pounding.  The excuses he had prepared couldn’t be uttered. He prostrated himself.  “Great True One, this junior did notice some unusual activity, but I did not deliberately conceal it.  As the ruler of the Eastern Sea, every action this junior takes must be carefully considered.  Acting rashly without a clear understanding of the situation could have led to grave consequences, potentially causing the Storm Realm to fracture.  When the Northern Sea was in peril, this junior had too many concerns. Although I immediately sent messages to the various clans of the Eastern Sea, I failed to provide timely reinforcements.  This is indeed this junior’s fault.  I am willing to accept punishment!”</p><p>Qin Sang looked deeply at the Dragon Whale. “There are many inconsistencies in your words. However, considering you did not collude with the Flood Dragon King, you are not beyond redemption.  You are also demoted to a Yao soldier, to be observed for future conduct.”</p><p>The Dragon Whale's massive body trembled. In the end, he let out a long sigh, a lament of a fallen hero, as he watched the talisman embed itself into his forehead, becoming a Yao soldier alongside his most trusted subordinates.</p><p>Qin Sang judged by actions, not intentions, and didn’t bother with King Yu.</p><p>Regardless of how King Yu had interacted with the Flood Dragon King, when the Changyou Clan attacked, the Yao Realm and the Northern Sea had stood together and hadn’t retreated.</p><p>With this series of blows and maneuvers, only the Northern Sea Yao Realm remained intact among the Yao Clan.</p><p>Just as everyone thought it might end there, Qin Sang unexpectedly turned to Old Devil Hong.  “Besides the Eastern Sea Yao Clan, who else knew?”</p><p>“Tianhao Pavilion, Elder Fan!”</p><p>Old Devil Hong’s answer caused another wave of commotion.</p><p>The cultivators of the Three Sects Alliance were thrown into disarray.  Tianhao Pavilion’s seats were to the far right of the three sects, with Old Devil Kurong and Old Devil Fan sitting side by side in the main seats.</p><p>Old Devil Fan reacted swiftly, instantly transforming into a wisp of black smoke and shooting towards the mountainside.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>A bolt of lightning struck the black smoke.  Surprisingly, what tumbled out was a stone figure.</p><p>Cunning and treacherous, Old Devil Fan had sensed danger and sent only a puppet to attend the ceremony.</p><p>Qin Sang smiled coldly and looked towards the sky.  A streak of light descended, revealing Old Devil Fan within.</p><p>Old Devil Fan was completely immobilized, his eyes filled with terror.  He had clearly experienced something terrifying.  His answer to Qin Sang's questioning caused even greater commotion.</p><p>Everyone looked at the Three Sects Alliance with disbelief.  They had known about the fiends colluding with the enemy, yet they had deliberately summoned the various sects of the Central Continent for discussion, delaying action.</p><p>Qin Sang slowly uttered four words:  “Their hearts are wicked!”</p><p>The three Sect Masters wore different expressions.</p><p>Master Xingren pressed his palms together and chanted a Buddhist prayer.</p><p>Master Yinci and several monks knelt down. “This disciple has been unfilial, disgracing the sect. Please, Abbot, grant us death.”</p><p>They understood that today, as those who knew and the masterminds, they were destined to die.  Only by taking responsibility could they protect the Abbot and the sect.</p><p>In truth, Master Xingren hadn’t personally orchestrated the plot, but he had hinted at it before entering seclusion.  This left a sliver of room for maneuver.</p><p>Master Xingren gently stroked Master Yinci's head, and the light in Master Yinci’s eyes gradually faded.</p><p>“This poor monk will eliminate all those who colluded with the evil fiends and give Great True One and all fellow Daoists an explanation. As the Abbot, this poor monk cannot shirk responsibility and is willing to resign from the position.  This poor monk implores Great True One to allow this useless body to remain, to meditate on my transgressions facing a wall.  When the next powerful enemy invades, I will enter the battlefield and atone for my sins with my life.  To die in battle would be no grievance!”</p><p>True One Qishen stepped forward and kowtowed deeply before True One Hegao, then turned and said, “We colluded with fiends and committed a grave error.  We deserve our punishment.  We hope Great True One will not implicate our sect.”</p><p>With that, blood trickled from the corner of True One Qishen’s mouth, and he ended his own life.</p><p>True One Hegao sighed towards the heavens.  “A misfortune for my sect.  This poor Daoist has nothing to say.  I submit to Great True One’s judgment!”</p><p>Old Devil Kurong’s face was grim.  He remained silent, offering no defense for Old Devil Fan, his thoughts unknown.</p><p>“Hahahaha…”</p><p>Old Devil Fan suddenly burst into maniacal laughter, his voice filled with hatred.  “Old Ghost Kurong, you think you can live after I die?  Who was it that introduced that Hong to me in the first place?”</p><p>Unexpectedly, knowing his death was certain, Old Devil Fan disregarded the future of his sect and turned on Old Devil Kurong.</p><p>Both the Sect Master and the Grand Elder had fallen, and they had done so by accusing each other.  Tianhao Pavilion would likely shatter into pieces.</p><p>At this moment, the same thought crossed everyone's minds.</p><p>The Three Sects Alliance was finished!</p><p>Tianhao Pavilion was finished!</p>
