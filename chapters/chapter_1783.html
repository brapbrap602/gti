<h1>Chapter 1774: True Treasures</h1><p>Before the courtyard.</p><p>Qin Sang, disguised, had just presented his calling card and stood with his hands behind his back, surveying the courtyard.  The trees were lush, birds sang sweetly, a truly exceptional retreat, anywhere. This was the residence of Master Qi.</p><p>A young Taoist boy soon hurried out, bowing, "Senior Mingyue, Master requests your presence."</p><p>"Thank you, young Daoist."</p><p>Qin Sang smiled warmly, offering his thanks, and followed the boy into the guest hall. The boy served tea and spiritual fruit. "Senior, please wait, Master is still busy and will be here shortly."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded. "Please go ahead, young Daoist."</p><p>After the boy left, Qin Sang sipped his tea, lost in thought.  His visit to Master Qi wasn't to commission the crafting of magical treasures. Qin Sang had two objectives.</p><p>First, to seek instruction in the art of refining artifacts. His life-bound spirit sword, the Yunyou Sword, had absorbed the essence of the Burning Wood spirit, and he hadn't dared to use it since, waiting for it to develop its own sentience. In the Storm Realm, he'd received some guidance and texts, but practical experience was scarce.</p><p>Secondly, to have the master appraise three fragmented treasures.</p><p>Qin Sang mused that the three fragments likely originated from the Immortal Palace and were certainly of high quality.  Presenting all three at once would invite suspicion and possibly unwanted trouble, which he wished to avoid.  With his current strength, he didn't fear the Jushan forces as much as the Dao Court, but some factions might be connected to the Dao Court. It was best to start with one.</p><p>Qin Sang's consciousness delved into his Qianjun Ring; the three fragments – a sword, a drum, and a scroll – came into view. He valued the Chengying Sword most, being a sword cultivator himself, and it appeared the most complete; the more he valued it, the more cautious he became.  The broken drum had a hole in its surface; it seemed that repairing the hole would restore the treasure. The scroll depicted a boundless expanse of water, constantly flowing, creating the sound of rushing water – an inherent magical effect.</p><p>Initially, Qin Sang couldn't discern their significance; judging by appearances, the scroll seemed the most precious.  Now, with his enhanced cultivation, he had a different perspective and suspected the scroll was the most severely damaged.</p><p>Just then, Qin Sang sensed someone approaching the hall, withdrew his consciousness, rose, and looked towards the door.  Seeing who it was, he was startled.  Such disregard for appearances was rare indeed!</p><p>The newcomer was a fat Taoist, hair disheveled, appearing flustered. His Taoist robe, a magical artifact capable of self-cleaning, was pristine except for a large hole in the side.  Considering his attire, his round physique seemed less unusual.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't imagine how a Yuan Ying cultivator could appear like this. Some alchemists who experimented on themselves, or heretical cultivators, might become monstrous.</p><p>The fat Taoist was the Master Qi he sought. His skill in artifact refinement was renowned; a pseudo-spiritual treasure at the Jushan auction was his creation.</p><p>But upon perceiving Master Qi's cultivation, Qin Sang's doubts grew.</p><p>"You can't judge a book by its cover,"</p><p>Qin Sang thought, but he couldn't help wondering if this man would meet his expectations.</p><p>"Daoist Mingyue?"</p><p>Master Qi strode into the hall, a gust of wind preceding him, his eyes squinting as he sized up Qin Sang. He muttered, "I thought some old geezer was using an alias to tease me.  But Daoist friend, you're a new face."</p><p>Qin Sang bowed, "This Daoist rarely visits Star Island Immortal Lake.  After my breakthrough, I've been traveling and wish to refine a suitable magical treasure, so I came to visit the Master."</p><p>"So you've recently broken through... please, sit."</p><p>Master Qi's expression changed.  Many Ascension Transformation Realm cultivators visited him, but not everyone saw him personally. If Qin Sang hadn't shown his late Yuan Ying stage aura, Master Qi wouldn't have been so quick to invite him.</p><p>"What treasure do you intend to refine, Daoist friend?" Master Qi, clearly focused on his craft, didn't ask Qin Sang's background, going straight to the point.</p><p>Qin Sang, also an artifact refiner, used his questions to subtly assess the master's skill, gradually abandoning his initial slighting thoughts.  The man's reputation was well-deserved; a few words brought sudden enlightenment to Qin Sang.</p><p>After a while, Master Qi frowned, "Daoist friend, you seem to lack a clear direction."</p><p>Qin Sang's questions had been all over the place. If he hadn't found them interesting, he would've lost patience long ago.</p><p>"That's why I sought the Master's guidance."</p><p>Qin Sang smiled.  "I will be staying in Hu Cheng for a while; there's no rush.  Besides, I've acquired something I'd like your expertise on, Master."</p><p>He spoke, the Qianjun ring flashing. A wooden box appeared in Qin Sang's hand, its seal breaking.</p><p>"This treasure was an unexpected find. I've had it for years but haven't been able to understand it.  I'd be grateful if you could examine it, Master."</p><p>Master Qi, understanding this was Qin Sang's true purpose, was somewhat surprised but also intrigued. His gaze sharpened as he looked at the box.</p><p>From their earlier conversation, Master Qi sensed Qin Sang wasn't entirely ignorant of the art of refining artifacts.  Those questions must have been a test. What kind of treasure warranted such caution?</p><p>'Pop!'</p><p>The box opened, and the sound of flowing water filled the hall.</p><p>Immediately, a scroll flew out, suspended in mid-air. Its shape was irregular, with five corners.  The entire scroll was covered with water, constantly flowing, as if a section of a river had been captured, its source and end unknown.</p><p>"Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!"</p><p>The sound of water echoed in the hall.</p><p>"This is..."</p><p>Master Qi stared intently at the scroll, his expression almost dazed. He abruptly turned to Qin Sang, his voice urgent. "Might I examine it in my hands?"</p><p>He knew the etiquette; he didn't ask about the treasure's origin.</p><p>"Of course."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, secretly anticipating the master's reaction. It seemed he had indeed noticed something.</p><p>Master Qi raised his right hand, and the scroll flew towards him.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes flickered; he sensed the master using some kind of secret technique, an invisible force enveloping the scroll.</p><p>Once the scroll rested in Master Qi's palm, beams of white light shot out, quickly forming a mist that shrouded the scroll.</p><p>Ignoring the presence of the stranger, Master Qi closed his eyes, his entire being immersed in the mist.</p><p>Qin Sang sipped his tea, quietly observing Master Qi.</p><p>Master Qi made several hand seals and sat cross-legged. The mist and the scroll hovered before him, the mist swirling, the scroll appearing and disappearing within it, rising and falling.</p><p>After a while, Master Qi changed his hand seals; the scroll would sometimes roll into a scroll, sometimes unfurling.</p><p>Qin Sang gradually understood. The mist contained a strange energy, and Master Qi was trying to manipulate this energy to penetrate the scroll – a rather exquisite refining technique.</p><p>However, the seemingly gentle flow of water repeatedly repelled Master Qi's attempts. No matter how many hand seals he used, the water would push back.</p><p>But Master Qi wasn't entirely unsuccessful. The mist gradually gathered at the edges of the scroll, forming a misty ring.</p><p>The changes in the mist became increasingly subtle.</p><p>After an unknown period, Master Qi let out a long sigh, regaining his composure.</p><p>Qin Sang was intrigued. Master Qi had tried everything, yet the scroll remained unchanged. Had he failed?</p><p>"Master, have you discovered anything?" Qin Sang asked eagerly.</p><p>Master Qi pondered. "I'm not entirely certain, but..."</p><p>He paused, then his tone shifted. He asked Qin Sang, "My friend, do you know what happens when a magic treasure nurtures a spirit, becoming a spirit treasure, and then continues to improve in rank?"</p><p>Qin Sang knew, of course.  The 'spirit' Master Qi referred to was what he understood as spiritual essence; once spiritual essence was born, it naturally nurtured a spirit.</p><p>"It births a spirit?"</p><p>"That's just one aspect."</p><p>Master Qi nodded. "I was fortunate enough to see an ancient text that recorded that after a treasure becomes a spirit treasure, one can choose to help it nurture a spirit, divided into innate and acquired types."</p><p>Qin Sang listened intently; this was a secret of spirit treasures. Even though he only possessed one.</p><p>Since he'd started, Master Qi decided to explain in detail.  "The innate and acquired distinction is based on the origins of the treasure and its spirit. Treasures refined by cultivators are called acquired spirit treasures. Legend speaks of naturally occurring spirit treasures, possessing inherent spirits, their spirits nurtured by heaven and earth, called innate spirit treasures. As for the differences between innate and acquired spirit treasures, that is beyond my knowledge..."</p><p>Master Qi continued, "Besides these, there's another branch, called True Treasures."</p><p>"True Treasures?"</p><p>Qin Sang showed a thoughtful expression.</p><p>"Yes, it's said that at the moment a spirit is about to be born, one can use immense power to forcibly interrupt the process and completely refine the nascent spirit into the treasure.  This creates a True Treasure."</p><p>At this point, Master Qi showed an expression of amazement. "When I first learned this secret, I was shocked for a long time. I thought it was a terrible waste."</p><p>According to that ancient text, Zhenbao artifacts are not inferior to Lingbao, and in some aspects, may even be superior.  Above Lingbao are the Xiantian Lingbao, the Houtian Lingbao, and Zhenbao; it is said that each has its unique strengths… ”</p><p>As for the exact differences between the three supreme treasures, Master Qi couldn't explain them, after all, he hadn't reached that level of cultivation.</p><p>Qin Sang understood that perhaps Daoist sects hold relevant texts and traditions; Master Qi, not being a member of a Daoist sect, wouldn't have access to them.</p><p>Qin Sang quickly composed himself, gazing at the scroll in astonishment, “Could it be that I've stumbled upon a great opportunity, is this one of the three supreme treasures?”</p><p>“Most likely a Zhenbao fragment…”</p><p>Master Qi hesitated, “In its complete form, it was probably a spirit map, a banner, or a cloud robe.”</p><p>“A Zhenbao fragment?”</p><p>Disappointment flashed in Qin Sang's eyes. He had thought it was a damaged Zhenbao; a damaged Zhenbao and a Zhenbao fragment are two different concepts.</p><p>He carefully examined the scroll.  He hadn't expected this treasure to be of such great origin. It seemed that the Wu Xiang Immortal Sect had explored the Immortal Palace very thoroughly back then.  Among the treasures within the Immortal Palace, the scroll, the Chengying Sword, and the broken drum were the three most striking.</p><p>“Could the other two also be Zhenbao?”</p><p>Qin Sang felt a surge of excitement.  Feigning enthusiasm, he looked at Master Qi, “Master, is there any way to repair this treasure?”</p><p>Master Qi smiled wryly, “Friend, you think too highly of me.  Forget about a Zhenbao fragment; even a slightly damaged Zhenbao is beyond my capabilities.  To be honest, my lifelong ambition is merely to refine a single Lingbao.”</p><p>At this moment, Master Qi, who had been hesitating to speak, finally couldn't contain himself.  Ignoring any formalities, he repeatedly asked, “Friend, can you tell me where you obtained this treasure?”</p><p>“This…”</p><p>Qin Sang hesitated before saying, “During a journey deep within the Evil Origin, I found it by chance.  Seeing its mystical nature, I brought it back. I never expected its origins to be so extraordinary.”</p><p>This was an excuse he had prepared in advance.</p><p>The Evil Origin, a dangerous and mysterious place, is not without opportunities for those who dare to explore it.</p><p>Master Qi didn't suspect anything, thoughtfully saying, “Friend, you may have encountered the place where great Daoist masters, or even legendary True Immortals, fought. Only they possess the ability to refine and shatter Zhenbao.”</p><p>Qin Sang held the scroll, turning it over and over, sighing softly, “So, not only is this treasure irreparable, but any attempt to refine it for other purposes is also a futile hope.”</p><p>“I truly cannot do it. If you could invite a Daoist expert, perhaps they could guide you,” Master Qi shook his head repeatedly.</p><p>Visiting Daoist experts would be necessary in the future.</p><p>Since it's a Zhenbao fragment, the risk of attracting unwanted attention is much lower.</p><p>Qin Sang thought to himself, turning his palm to put away the scroll.</p><p>Master Qi urgently called out, “Friend, wait!”</p><p>“Master, what is it?” Qin Sang's lips curved into a smile.</p><p>In the cultivation world, those who wholeheartedly pursue the Outer Dao, and those who wholeheartedly pursue the Immortal Dao, are both fools.</p><p>He had used a Wu clan alchemic formula to hook Master Lingxu, and he could use this Zhenbao fragment to hook Master Qi.</p><p>This method never failed, and he wasn't afraid that the other party wouldn't take the bait.</p><p>Sure enough, Master Qi rubbed his hands, cautiously saying, “Since you'll be staying in Hu Zhong City for a while, may I borrow this treasure to examine it? Although I cannot refine it, gaining some understanding of it would be greatly beneficial... I would be eternally grateful.”</p><p>Qin Sang feigned hesitation, “I would be happy to see your cultivation improve; it would be a fortunate event for fellow cultivators.”</p><p>Master Qi's face lit up with joy.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Qin Sang changed his tone, “However…”</p><p>Under Master Qi's worried gaze, Qin Sang said calmly, “To be frank, I am also quite interested in the art of refining, but unfortunately, I lack a master and my skills are still lacking.  While you are studying this treasure, could you allow me to observe and provide me with some basic explanations? Also, I intend to take on a disciple. I admire the renowned sects of Xingdao Immortal Lake and would like to secure a place for my disciple.  Could you recommend me at that time?”</p><p>For Master Qi, only the first condition was difficult.</p><p>The sects of Xingdao Immortal Lake had all sought out Master Qi at some point, and they had some connections.  Securing a place for a disciple would not be difficult.</p><p>Qin Sang's request was not simply to be told his insights.  Understanding a Zhenbao requires special Daoist techniques, and an explanation of its structure would inevitably involve the core essence of Master Qi's lineage, akin to instructing a direct disciple.</p><p>He was openly stealing his teacher's knowledge.</p><p>However, the temptation of a Zhenbao was too great!</p><p>Master Qi ultimately couldn't resist the temptation, “As you wish! However, let's agree beforehand that I cannot guarantee how much you'll ultimately understand.”</p><p>“That depends on my aptitude,”</p><p>Qin Sang smiled and handed over the scroll.</p>
