<h1>Chapter 1634: The Heartless Pavilion</h1><p>Chapter 1634: The Heartless Pavilion</p><p>The main Ice Palace.</p><p>幽蓝 (deep blue) light illuminated every corner of the Ice Palace.</p><p>For a long time, the scene within the Ice Palace remained unchanged, quietly nestled within the ruins of the Immortal Sect's estate.</p><p>Without intrusion, the deep blue light remained almost still.</p><p>Only when the Faceless Man and the Weeping Spirit Master passed, did the blue light intensify, and residual formation power continuously attacked them.</p><p>‘Bang!’</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The door of one of the Ice Palaces was blown open, crashing to the ground and shattering into pieces.  A green wave surged from the palace, nearby runes dissipated, and the sustaining formation power collapsed.</p><p>Following this, the two emerged through the empty doorway.</p><p>A green light, a wooden bead, hovered over the Faceless Man's chest.</p><p>The bead had just retracted its glow; it was this treasure that had blown open the Ice Palace door and shattered the formations.</p><p>Upon exiting the Ice Palace, they felt a sudden increase in pressure.  They both looked up, seeing the light pressing down on them. The light was gloomy, and the heavy pressure was suffocating.</p><p>Clearly, breaking the Ice Palace door triggered a chain reaction in the residual formation.</p><p>The Weeping Spirit Master calmly formed a hand seal.</p><p>The red flower artifact floating above his head gently vibrated, emitting a soft force that lifted upwards, supporting the weight of the descending light.</p><p>Instead of directly confronting the residual formation, the Weeping Spirit Master used gentleness to overcome hardness. After a moment of resistance, the light subsided, and the pressure disappeared.</p><p>The spirit formation was incomplete; some Ice Palaces were intact, others severely damaged.</p><p>The fragmented formation was disjointed, not forming a whole; they only needed to deal with the residual formation power within a certain range.  As long as they were careful not to make large movements, it wasn't particularly difficult.</p><p>To them, the threat within the Ice Palaces was less than that of the Kirin Shadow Wall.</p><p>“There aren’t many palaces left. Based on the layout of the Wood Phase Hall, the remaining ones should be core palaces similar to the Ancestor Hall…”</p><p>The Weeping Spirit Master estimated the distance they had covered in the Ice Palace, already nearing the core. The Faceless Man hadn’t yet found the unknown precious wood.</p><p>“The aura is ahead,” the Faceless Man’s senses sharpened, confirming, “It can’t be far!”</p><p>The Weeping Spirit Master rubbed his hands together.  “It seems this precious wood is highly valuable; the Water Phase lineage placed great importance on it. Following the aura, we can not only obtain the wood but also have a chance to find the Water Phase lineage’s treasury, striking two birds with one stone!”</p><p>“If we find the treasury, the precious wood is mine, and the rest of the treasures will be chosen by the Master first.”</p><p>The Faceless Man wasn't greedy.  For the upcoming trip to Emperor Grant Mountain, the Weeping Spirit Master was an essential helper; it wasn't worth jeopardizing their relationship over the Water Phase lineage's treasury.</p><p>“I thank you in advance, friend.”</p><p>The Weeping Spirit Master laughed heartily, quickly following the Faceless Man into the next palace.</p><p>Not long after they left…</p><p>A figure flickered, gradually solidifying before the shattered door—Qin Sang himself.</p><p>He stood openly under the light, yet suffered no attack.</p><p>“A pity, these two don’t seem inclined to separate, otherwise, defeating them individually would be much easier…”</p><p>Qin Sang watched the direction of their departure, his thoughts racing, a cold glint in his eyes, revealing his killing intent.</p><p>The Faceless Man’s abilities were too strange; his hidden clone was found even in the hidden halls.  Moreover, this man intensely desired his clone, making him a persistent and future threat.</p><p>Before, the Faceless Man's attention was focused on the Infinite Form Immortal Sect. Once things were settled, he would have free hands to target the clone, having gained benefits, his future strength would be hard to estimate.</p><p>He couldn't hand over the Dao Manifestation Tree, nor could he constantly guard against it, never allowing the clone to leave his presence.</p><p>One covets the spirit tree.</p><p>One must protect the clone.</p><p>The enmity between them was irreconcilable!</p><p>Qin Sang understood the importance of striking first; he wouldn’t sit idly by.</p><p>Now, the enemy was in the open, and he was in the shadows. Even with a companion, it was an opportunity too good to miss, worth a try!</p><p>Qin Sang’s figure flickered, disappearing without a trace.</p><p>Meanwhile…</p><p>Within the hidden hall…</p><p>The clone sat cross-legged beside an ice platform, his mind fully focused on the residual formation.</p><p>Through the formation, the clone could sense the actions within the spirit formation, knowing exactly the movements of the Faceless Man and the Weeping Spirit Master.  As expected, the two were heading straight for the Ancestor Hall, getting closer and closer!</p><p>The true body followed behind them.</p><p>Their every move couldn't escape the clone’s perception.</p><p>With the clone’s assistance, the true body could calmly track them, without fear of his actions being discovered.</p><p>"Almost there..."</p><p>Hua Shen murmured to himself, his expression growing increasingly serious.</p><p>The damaged formations corresponding to the intact and damaged flags were near the Ancestor Temple, in front of Gui Lian Ren and Qi Ling Dong Zhu. Qin Sang planned an ambush there; he was only two rows of palaces away from them!</p><p>A great battle was about to begin.</p><p>This battle absolutely must result in Gui Lian Ren's demise; Qi Ling Dong Zhu was secondary.</p><p>Of course, if he could kill both, Qin Sang wouldn't hesitate for a moment.</p><p>Facing two top experts alone, even with the advantage of time and place, Qin Sang dared not relax in the slightest.  His mind was taut, having already run through countless scenarios in a short time.</p><p>A tense atmosphere permeated the dark hall; the air seemed to solidify.</p><p>The flag's surface tightened, its spiritual light flickering uncertainly. After millennia of dormancy, it finally had the chance to see battle again!</p><p>In a flash,</p><p>Gui Lian Ren and Qi Ling Dong Zhu passed through another palace.</p><p>Only one row of palaces separated them from the ambush site!</p><p>Qin Sang's true body, abandoning his earlier relaxed pace, suddenly increased his speed, swiftly moving through the rows of palaces to close in on his enemies!</p><p>A great battle was about to begin!</p><p>At the critical moment,</p><p>Gui Lian Ren and Qi Ling Dong Zhu passed through the ice garden between the two rows of palaces, about to enter the main hall of the last row, when Gui Lian Ren suddenly noticed a pavilion in a corner of the garden. He made a questioning sound, "Wu Xin Pavilion!"</p><p>The two stopped, halting in front of the last row of palaces.</p><p>Qin Sang and Hua Shen nearly cursed aloud.</p><p>"Friend, do you recognize this spiritual pavilion?" Qi Ling Dong Zhu asked, following his gaze.</p><p>Gui Lian Ren nodded. "I remember reading a classic text that recorded anecdotes of some exceptionally talented ancestors of the Five Sects.  Among them, there was a Wu Xin Venerable of the Water Sect.  The Wu Xiang Immortal Sect didn't adhere strictly to Buddhism or Daoism or anything else; it's said this person was a Buddhist cultivator who once sealed his cultivation, carrying only a bowl and a kasaya, to endure hardships in the mortal world.  After his return, he built the Wu Xin Pavilion in Bing Yi Palace, where he practiced in seclusion for a hundred years, achieving great enlightenment. Upon emerging from seclusion, he achieved the Transformation God realm, a legendary feat!"</p><p>"This Wu Xin Pavilion is a Transformation God cultivation site?"</p><p>Qi Ling Dong Zhu's eyes lit up. He scanned the pavilion and seeing it was intact, rushed towards it without hesitation.</p><p>Gui Lian Ren hesitated for a moment, then quickly followed.</p><p>Compared to the other palaces, Wu Xin Pavilion was not large, only two stories, tucked away in a corner of the ice garden.  Its unremarkable appearance likely saved it from destruction.</p><p>Arriving before Wu Xin Pavilion,</p><p>Gui Lian Ren and Qi Ling Dong Zhu fumbled for a while, finding a flaw in the entrance restriction. One manipulated a wooden bead, the other summoned a wooden thorn; together they broke through the door.</p><p>A golden light appeared.</p><p>A wall of Buddhist light formed, but the light was thicker in some places and thinner in others.</p><p>The two, with sharp eyes, attacked the weaker parts of the Buddhist light.</p><p>'Crack!'</p><p>The light wall was steadily worn away by the two, the Buddhist light growing dimmer until it was torn apart with a shattering sound.</p><p>A vine shot into the light wall, pushing open the door of Wu Xin Pavilion.</p><p>Seeing nothing amiss, the two entered.</p><p>But soon, they emerged from Wu Xin Pavilion with disappointed expressions.</p><p>Inside Wu Xin Pavilion was only a meditation cushion, an incense burner, and a pile of incense ash.  Where were the Transformation God relics?</p><p>The Wu Xin Venerable had truly immersed himself in the mortal world; the cushion and incense burner were mundane items, of very ordinary material, not even considered magical implements.</p><p>The Transformation God cultivation site was a misnomer!</p><p>The two had wasted their efforts.  Their gaze swept over the row of palaces, their interest diminished.  Finding the precious wood and treasury was the real business.</p><p>They left Wu Xin Pavilion without returning to the main hall, instead choosing a nearby path, breaking through restrictions as they passed through this row of palaces.</p><p>This seemingly ordinary action caused Qin Sang's true body and Hua Shen to change color.</p><p>Behind this row of palaces was an icy lake.</p><p>Mist drifted over the icy lake, with several jade bridges spanning its banks.  Together with the islets and pavilions in the center, they appeared and disappeared in the cold mist, like a fairyland.</p><p>Although there were damaged areas, the beauty remained.</p><p>Strangely, on the same lake, some areas were frozen while others had rippling clear waters.</p><p>This icy lake was the area controlled by the intact flag!</p><p>The frozen parts were due to the incomplete formation; the formation's power leaked out and had an effect. The unfrozen, seemingly calm areas of the lake were where the formation was most intact.  They could be manipulated through the flag. Under Hua Shen's deliberate concealment, there was no trace of the formation's fluctuations on the ice surface.</p><p>The jade bridge leading to the main hall almost passed through the center of the lake – the perfect place for an ambush.</p><p>If the two hadn't been distracted by Wu Xin Pavilion and changed their path, they would have definitely crossed that jade bridge and fallen into the trap.  Qin Sang could have easily used the formation's power to separate them and defeat them one by one.</p><p>But they had taken a shortcut, stepping onto another jade bridge!</p><p>No matter how well-planned, accidents are inevitable.</p><p>Qin Sang, a cultivator of many years, understood this perfectly well.  His emotions remained unaffected; his mind raced, strategizing a response.</p><p>In a flash, they stood on the ice lake's edge.  After a brief pause, observing that the surrounding bluish sky was unremarkable, they chose a jade bridge and crossed.</p><p>This bridge wasn't far from the one connecting to the main hall.</p><p>However, the scenes beneath the two bridges were vastly different.</p><p>Below the bridge they chose was ice, thankfully a relatively small area near the water's edge, bordering the control range of the Treasure Banner.</p><p>But these top-tier experts reacted incredibly fast.  If the avatar activated the spirit array and caused a disturbance, they'd instantly respond.  Pulling them all into the array would be nearly impossible.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, they neared the bridge's midpoint.</p><p>Once across the lake, the ancestral hall was near; there'd be no chance for an ambush.  Qin Sang needed to decide immediately.</p><p>On the bridge, the Odd-faced Man and the Weeping Spirit Cave Master walked side-by-side. The Odd-faced Man was on the left, the Cave Master on the right, closest to the water.  If Qin Sang attacked, he could only pull the Cave Master into the array; the Odd-faced Man would likely escape.</p><p>"To be safe, I'll only deal with one! Him!"</p><p>Qin Sang made a decisive move, unwilling to waste the opportunity.  He would attack; even if he couldn't stop the Odd-faced Man, crippling him would be beneficial.  He could deal with the Odd-faced Man later!</p><p>Inside the hidden chamber, the avatar's hand firmly pressed against the ice disc, ready to activate the incomplete array.  Qin Sang's main body was already hidden near the ice lake's shore.</p><p>"Most of the structures here remain; the traces of battle are minimal…"</p><p>The Weeping Spirit Cave Master observed the surroundings, conversing with the Odd-faced Man.</p><p>The Odd-faced Man grunted, gazing down at the ice lake. He showed increased caution towards the chilling surface, opened his mouth to speak, when he sensed something amiss.</p><p>The next moment, the ice lake erupted.</p><p>…</p><p>Inside the hidden chamber, the avatar pressed down hard, his entire body's true energy surging into the ice disc. The illusion within the disc rapidly shifted.  Visible icy miasma flowed rapidly within the disc, its aura overflowing. A thin layer of ice crept up the ice platform, threatening to freeze the avatar's arm.</p><p>Then, the ice platform suddenly lit up, the light blindingly intense.  A cold, piercing light illuminated the entire chamber as bright as day. A powerful suction force erupted from within the platform.</p><p>‘Crack crack crack…’</p><p>The newly formed ice shattered.  All the icy miasma was instantly absorbed by the platform, the chamber’s chill significantly decreasing.</p><p>The platform could absorb spiritual veins, replenishing the ice disc's energy; it served as a conduit between the disc and the Ice Palace array.</p><p>Activated by the avatar, the platform's suction drew in the icy miasma from the disc, channeling it downwards into the array's eye.</p><p>Instantly, the spirit array's runes flashed repeatedly.</p><p>Guided by the avatar, the icy miasma gathered, flowing towards the Treasure Banner.</p><p>Even the broken banners weren't spared.  Qin Sang was always this way; once he acted, he held nothing back! He was willing to risk collapsing the entire Ice Palace array to activate both the broken and the Treasure Banners!</p><p>‘Whoosh whoosh…’</p><p>The Treasure Banner’s surface tightened as the icy miasma flowed inside. Its form drastically changed, morphing into banners of icy miasma; frigid and imposing.</p><p>Simultaneously, a ‘clinking’ sound echoed.</p><p>These sounds came from the other broken banners.  Some lacked banners altogether, only bare poles left.  As the icy miasma surged in, the poles violently shook, their bodies visibly cracking.</p><p>The avatar multitasked, using all his might to control the icy miasma, prolonging the broken banners' existence as much as possible.</p><p>Meanwhile, on the ice lake, the spirit array's power erupted!</p><p>‘Rumble rumble!’</p><p>The calm lake surface was suddenly torn apart, waves rising, columns of water shooting towards the sky.</p><p>All the incomplete array’s power, under the avatar’s control, surged towards this point. The bluish sky light frantically converged above the ice lake, enveloped by intense light, darkening the lake instead.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The water columns crashed into the sky light.</p><p>In areas that hadn't frozen, an endless icy wind inexplicably arose.  Visible white icy wind raged above the lake.</p><p>The phenomenon vanished, icy miasma soaring!</p><p>In an instant, the ice lake transformed into an extreme cold domain.  The Weeping Spirit Cave Master was at the edge of the icy wind!</p><p>"Watch out!"</p><p>The Odd-faced Man roared, his heart sinking.</p><p>Throughout their journey, they had triggered the incomplete array countless times, understanding its patterns.  This spectacle was clearly not a spontaneous reaction of the incomplete array.</p>
