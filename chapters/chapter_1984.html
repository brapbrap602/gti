<h1>Chapter 1975: Emergence</h1><p>The earth cracked and mountains crumbled.</p><p>Lava erupted ceaselessly, spreading across the sky before crashing back down, exhausted.</p><p>The earth was ablaze, thick smoke billowing.</p><p>The desert became a sea of fire.</p><p>And the fissures continued to widen, as if the earth held an endless supply of magma that had finally found a way to escape.</p><p>Under this apocalyptic scene, the destruction of the ancient prohibitions and the secret realm unleashed a terrifying power that could reduce cultivators to ashes—even Nascent Soul cultivators would feel a shiver of fear.</p><p>Though the Nine Immortals of Yun City were gathered here, each with extraordinary abilities, none dared to charge directly into the onslaught.</p><p>*Bang! Bang! Bang!*</p><p>The Nine Immortals watched helplessly as the stone pillars before them were swept away by the lava, the secret realm instantly rendered unrecognizable.</p><p>They had intended to use the Cloud Soldier Mystical Formation to suppress the eruption and conceal the phenomenon, but now realized how foolish that idea was.</p><p>With the destruction of both the secret realm and the Panlong Ancient Array's prohibitions, the power was far more than a simple superposition. Their immediate concern was survival!</p><p>“No good! Retreat!”</p><p>Yun Xi cried out in alarm.</p><p>In a single clash, the Cloud Soldier Mystical Formation—constructed by nine Nascent Soul cultivators using nine mystical weapons—was shaken.</p><p>*Bang! Bang! Bang!*</p><p>The mystical weapons trembled violently, threatening to be flung away at any moment.  The Nine Immortals struggled with all their might, to no avail.</p><p>Fortunately, their cultivation bases were all strong, and their coordination excellent. They reacted swiftly, immediately recalling their weapons.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>Nine sharp gleams flashed through the lava, breaking through the molten rock and shooting back, circling the nine cultivators.</p><p>The nine mystical weapons were askew, one fire spear even pointed at its owner. The Cloud Soldier Mystical Formation looked incredibly ragged and operated with great difficulty.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>Suddenly, a violent force slammed into them.</p><p>The Cloud Soldier Mystical Formation bore the brunt of the attack. The nine beams of mystical weapon light were instantly swallowed by the flames, seemingly extinguished, and swept towards the ground by the lava.</p><p>As they burst from the lava, a fissure tore open beside them, revealing the figures of the Nine Immortals of Yun City.</p><p>The nine were breathing heavily. The Cloud Soldier Mystical Formation had protected them from injury, but their faces were etched with fear. Without hesitation, they turned and fled.</p><p>They knew that deep within the secret realm, there might be a treasure related to the Panlong Ancient Array, but at this moment, no one dared to enter to retrieve it.</p><p>*Ding-ling-ling! Ding-ling-ling!*</p><p>As the danger receded and their minds relaxed, the Nine Immortals were startled by a ringing sound, turning their surprised gazes to the dragon ring bell at Yun Xi's waist.</p><p>Generally, the more crucial a part of the Panlong Ancient Array, the more violently the dragon ring bell reacted to its discovery.</p><p>The urgency of the ringing was unprecedented!</p><p>“Hiss…”</p><p>Yun Xi gasped, about to speak, when he felt something and his eyes narrowed, scanning sharply to one side.</p><p>In the direction of his gaze…</p><p>A faint wisp of grey, hidden within the thick smoke, was barely visible without careful observation.</p><p>Within the grey mist, a figure flickered, the expert from the Falling Soul Abyss who had been drawn here.</p><p>This person's dharma name was Chi Pi, sharing a name with an ancient auspicious beast. He was extraordinarily large and powerful, even more imposing than a bear.</p><p>His eyes were blood-red, his gaze ferocious, like a bloodthirsty beast.</p><p>Upon seeing the Nine Immortals emerge from the lava, Chi Pi immediately suppressed his ferocity. Though inherently savage, he was not reckless.</p><p>Yun Xi alone was no weaker than he, and with the Nine Immortals present, if surrounded, his chances of survival were slim.</p><p>Chi Pi's muscles tensed, his bones creaking like thunder. He leaped back, his form momentarily blurring, like a large bird, his speed astonishing.  This was a highly advanced evasion technique from the Falling Soul Abyss, called the ‘Obscuring Form Escape’, requiring immense physical strength to perform.</p><p>As he leaped, several black threads shot out from his waist.</p><p>Each thread was a small black insect, resembling a ground beetle, possessing a long, sharp tail and thin, cicada-like wings that vibrated, producing a sound like cicada chirping.</p><p>These ground beetles were specially cultivated corpse insects, used for communication, impervious to ordinary seals.</p><p>*Pop! Pop! Pop!*</p><p>The black threads exploded into clouds of blood mist, the corpse insects self-destructing.</p><p>The Nine Immortals saw this too, their expressions changing as they realized the message had been leaked and experts from the Falling Soul Abyss would soon arrive.</p><p>The destruction is unknown in its duration.  They must somehow penetrate the depths of the sacred site and retrieve the treasure before Chi Pi's reinforcements arrive; otherwise, a fierce battle is inevitable, and the outcome uncertain.</p><p>Chi Pi is even more anxious. He's outnumbered and powerless to stop the Nine Immortals of Yun Du. But the reaction of the Heartfire Jade indicates that what lies beneath is far more significant than any previously discovered sacred site. He cannot stand by and watch the Nine Immortals succeed; his master wouldn't forgive him.</p><p>Chi Pi senses that the apotheosis-level war both sects have been desperately avoiding might begin sooner than expected. Just as his anxiety peaks, he perceives a familiar presence approaching, and a smile touches his lips.</p><p>"Fei Luo, you've come."</p><p>Soon, a streak of light approaches, Fei Luo, who, having also sensed the disturbance, arrived at top speed. Fei Luo also holds a Heartfire Jade, radiating a dazzling light. He nods to Chi Pi, gazes at the fissure in the earth, his expression grave.</p><p>Chi Pi subtly shifts, standing shoulder to shoulder with Fei Luo.</p><p>"I recall you mentioning an unusual reaction from the Heartfire Jade in the past?"</p><p>Fei Luo nods. Two hundred years ago, shortly after entering the Fire Domain, the Heartfire Jade suddenly shone brightly. Though not as radiant as now, it was still extraordinary. Sadly, it only lasted a short time and has never recurred.  For years, he's scoured the Fire Domain, seeking the cause of that glow, suspecting a more significant, undiscovered relic.</p><p>Is this the source?  Fei Luo thinks it's highly probable. A minor eruption likely occurred here centuries ago, leaking energy and triggering the Heartfire Jade.  Even at a distance, the effect was quite striking.  They were the first to discover it but failed to seize the opportunity, allowing the Yun Du forces to beat them to it.</p><p>"What now?" asks Chi Pi.</p><p>Fei Luo is most familiar with the Panlong Ancient Array ruins and might find a way to reach the underground area and gain the upper hand. However, doing so under the watchful eyes of the Nine Immortals is incredibly challenging.</p><p>From afar, the Nine Immortals of Yun Du keep a watchful eye, their expressions wary, clearly anticipating a countermove.  Yun Xi assigns three to watch the Corpse Demon; the others discuss how to acquire the treasure.</p><p>Within the Fire Domain, powerful energies surge south, a brewing storm, tension palpable. A great battle is imminent.</p><p>However, neither the Nine Immortals nor the experts of the Lost Soul Abyss realize that, with the emergence of the Panlong Celestial Pillar, the situation has already slipped from their control.  The Pillar's emergence is completely unrestrained, its unique energy signature fully exposed to the heavens, causing a violent reaction in two artifacts, and simultaneously detected by two powerful ancestors.</p><p>...</p><p>Lost Soul Abyss.</p><p>Jing Zang, hidden in the shadows of his cave, analyzes the situation.  In his mind, he sees the human realm. Each nation, each faction, is clearly visible.  Ancestor Ming Hu has tasked him with controlling the overall situation; while his life isn't in danger, the mental strain is immense.</p><p>Yun Tian's actions haven't followed his plan.  His unexpected interventions repeatedly attempt to shift the situation to their advantage, catching Jing Zang off guard, though not entirely unexpectedly.</p><p>"Yun Tian..."</p><p>Jing Zang murmurs the name, suddenly sensing a disturbance in his cave's protective barrier. His brow furrows.  "Enter!"</p><p>A bright light appears at the entrance, and a disciple enters, bowing.  "Master, Master Wu has sent another Yin Yuan Diamond."</p><p>Jing Zang hums in acknowledgement, summoning the object. It’s a finger-sized black diamond, metallic in sheen, with streaks of grey energy flowing within, constantly forming grotesque faces – countless trapped souls. These souls are harvested from the human battlefields.</p><p>The human world is ravaged by war, countless lives lost.  The countless dead are easily exploited, a sea of blood inundates the land, the resentment reaching the heavens, precisely what the demons desire.  This is also part of Jing Zang's plan.</p><p>Jing Zang dismisses his disciple, swallowing the black diamond, ready to refine it, when his expression changes, and he instantly appears by the Black River.</p><p>"Master?"</p><p>Jing Zang is astonished by the river's transformation. A vortex has formed, water flowing towards the banks, the river parting to reveal an ancient stone staircase descending into the dark, cold depths, resembling a tomb passage.</p><p>Click… click… click…</p><p>The sound of a stone door moving came from below, along with a chilling yet overwhelmingly powerful aura emanating from the depths of the earth.</p><p>Before this aura, Jing Zang felt his mind trembling, fear welling up in his heart, spreading throughout his body involuntarily.  It felt as if a peerless demon was about to awaken—the ancestral master of Luohun Abyss,  Old Ancestor Minghu!</p><p>Only a handful of people in Luohun Abyss were qualified to approach the Black River, and Jing Zang was one of them.  Before, the Black River had acted as a barrier, greatly diminishing the terror of Old Ancestor Minghu’s aura.</p><p>“Master’s cultivation has deepened again!”</p><p>Jing Zang, both surprised and delighted, fell to his knees.  “Disciple greets Master!”</p><p>He lowered his head, his peripheral vision catching sight of shadows, deep and dark as water, spreading outward from the stone steps.  A figure was approaching, stepping out of the shadows.</p><p>Thump!</p><p>Thump!</p><p>Heavy footsteps, one after another, resonated in his heart, bringing even greater pressure. Jing Zang, a corpse cultivator, felt like he was drowning, his eyes filled with profound awe.</p><p>The figure from below ascended step by step.</p><p>The mysterious Old Ancestor Minghu gradually revealed himself from the shadows.  His height and build were unremarkable, his face that of an old man.  His wrinkles were terrifyingly numerous, coupled with pale skin, making him appear extremely aged.  He seemed frail, yet there was no trace of senility about him.  However, a chilling aura constantly surrounded him, as if he were a corpse just awakened from a tomb.</p><p>The eyes beneath the wrinkles were clouded and dull, their greyish-white irises lacking any luster. Yet, gazing into those eyes, one could sense that his gaze was both chaotic and all-encompassing, devouring all vitality.  The more one looked, the more terrifying the eyes became, unconsciously instilling deep-seated fear, silencing any thought of resistance.</p><p>Jing Zang, well aware of his master’s power, dared not look up, only able to see his master's legs.  These legs were extremely strange. At first glance, they appeared to be clad in armor; on closer inspection, the armor's patterns seemed etched directly onto the skin, covering Old Ancestor Minghu's entire body.  It was unclear whether the armor had been refined into his flesh or grown from his body—the two were indistinguishable, fused into one.</p><p>“Congratulations, Master, on achieving great mastery!”</p><p>Jing Zang called out from his kneeling position. He couldn't tell if his master had truly achieved mastery, but why else would he emerge from seclusion if he hadn't?</p><p>“Hehe…”</p><p>Old Ancestor Minghu gazed eastward, emitting a chilling laugh.  The laugh was eerie, but Jing Zang, familiar with his master, detected a hint of joy within it. His heart relaxed slightly. He hastened to flatter him, “Master, what good fortune has brought such joy?”</p><p>“The appearance of the蟠龙天柱 is indeed cause for celebration!”</p><p>Old Ancestor Minghu took a step, instantly vanishing.  His aura was no longer detectable within the entire Luohun Abyss.</p><p>Jing Zang’s face showed surprise.  If he remembered correctly, this was the first time his master had left Luohun Abyss in a thousand years. His master's personal intervention meant their carefully constructed plans might be rendered useless!</p><p>…</p><p>Yun Du Mountain.</p><p>Deep within the mountain range, towering peaks and swirling clouds created a scene of celestial beauty.</p><p>Passing through the mist…</p><p>The mountain’s scenery revealed itself, a sight worthy of being called a heavenly palace. Compared to this, Qin Sang's cultivation grounds were nothing more than a backwater.  Strange rocks and auspicious beasts, spiritual trees and rare flowers adorned the scene.  Within the magnificent palaces, numerous cultivators came and went, each extraordinary and gifted beyond the ordinary.</p><p>This was the location of Yun Du Mountain's overlord, the Yun Du Heavenly Sect.  Within the mountain gate, peaks rose one above the other, like layers of stairs reaching towards the heavens, the highest peak being the sect's sacred ground.</p><p>Atop the highest peak, the stars seemed within arm's reach, yet there was only a simple thatched hut.  A clear spring encircled the hut, with a cluster of purple bamboo planted by its side. These bamboo stalks emitted a strange luster; though slender, they were incredibly tough, a rare spiritual bamboo. The main material for the divine weapons used by the Nine Immortals of Yun Du was this bamboo.</p><p>The mountain wind blew, and the bamboo leaves rustled.</p><p>Inside the hut, a young man seemed awakened by the sound, opening his eyes.  The moment he opened them, breathtaking ethereal light flashed in his eyes, disappearing instantly.</p><p>The young man’s appearance was youthful, a stark contrast to Old Ancestor Minghu. His eyes were not as eerie, but gentle, like a kind elder, yet this caused no sense of incongruity.  This was Gu Yun Sou, the Supreme Grand Master of Yun Du Heavenly Sect.</p><p>Beside him lay a purple bamboo staff, beneath him a mat woven from bamboo leaves—nothing else. He turned towards the west, his expression slightly shifting. After a moment of contemplation, a stream of light flew from his body, his spirit body separating.  His spirit body looked identical to his physical form, but possessed a more ethereal aura.</p><p>The purple bamboo staff rose on its own and landed in the hands of his spirit body. Immediately, the spirit body moved, reappearing outside the mountain gate.</p><p>The disciples of Yun Du Tian didn’t notice. Only in a large hall at the front of the mountain, the current Sect Master of Yun Du Tian, who was meditating in seclusion, heard the transmission and awoke.  Upon learning the situation, his face was filled with shock, and he hastily left his seclusion.</p><p>Qin Sang probably hadn't anticipated that the move he made would have such a remarkable effect, causing an immediate stir among two Nascent Soul cultivators upon its emergence!</p>
