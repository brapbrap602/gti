<h1>Chapter 526: Verdant Peak Essence</h1><p>Golden Core!</p><p>After the flames vanished, Qin Sang immediately rose from the undergrowth. With a glint in his eyes, he activated his movement technique without hesitation and stealthily made his way towards Verdant Peak.</p><p>The Verdant Sun Devil Sect's Golden Core cultivator was the only person he was wary of. With this person gone, Qin Sang didn't have to worry about being easily exposed.  Therefore, he began his infiltration towards Verdant Peak before anyone else made a move.</p><p>He needed to save as much time as possible!</p><p>With the strength and speed of a Golden Core cultivator, traveling at full speed from the Verdant Sun Devil Sect to Boundless Valley, then entering the valley's second level, would take less than two hours at most.</p><p>The demonic beasts and monsters of the first level couldn't impede his progress.</p><p>Before coming here, Qin Sang and Wandering Scholar had agreed that Wandering Scholar would retreat immediately after succeeding, not lingering in the area.  No matter how strong he was, he couldn't fight an entire sect.</p><p>They had meticulously calculated every detail.</p><p>The sudden beast horde might buy Qin Sang more time.</p><p>Considering the round trip, even including the time it would take to rescue someone...</p><p>Qin Sang decided to set a limit of four hours. He had to complete the secret technique and leave the Verdant Sun Devil Sect within four hours!</p><p>"Four hours.  As long as nothing unexpected happens, it should be enough..." Qin Sang thought to himself.</p><p>As he drew closer to Verdant Peak, Qin Sang suddenly stopped, hiding behind a boulder.  Then, he saw several figures emerge from the green mist one after another, rushing down the mountain.</p><p>One of them summoned a two-pointed, slender, pod-shaped flying boat. Layers of green flames rose from its surface.</p><p>The flying boat expanded with the wind, and the others eagerly boarded.</p><p>A moment later, two more people arrived.</p><p>Suddenly, the flames on the flying boat intensified, and with a slight tremor, it transformed into a streak of light, shooting towards the sky at an astonishing speed, only slightly slower than the Golden Core cultivator's escape technique.</p><p>Qin Sang estimated that the flying boat's incredible speed was likely the result of the combined efforts of the cultivators on board.</p><p>These were turbulent times. The Verdant Sun Devil Sect's disciples were dispatched to the Verdant Sun Devil Sect's territory and the Chaotic Isles. The remaining experts within the sect were few, and these departing cultivators, if not all, were likely a significant portion!</p><p>Watching them depart, Qin Sang no longer had any concerns.</p><p>...</p><p>At the Verdant Sun Devil Sect's gate.</p><p>The flying boat arrived swiftly and was about to depart when it abruptly stopped before the stone tablet.</p><p>An unquestionable command came from within, "Fellow disciples, after our departure, the sect will be vulnerable.  Temporarily seal the gate; no one is permitted to enter or exit!"</p><p>Eight cultivators, all at the Foundation Establishment stage, were seated in meditation around the stone tablet.</p><p>Hearing this, a black-robed elder replied, "Rest assured, Junior Brother Li. Before Elder Wu departed, he also instructed us to activate the grand formation as soon as you left, leaving no opportunity for evildoers!  By the way..."</p><p>As if remembering something, the black-robed elder hurriedly retrieved a jade slip from his robes and sent it towards the flying boat.  "The scouting report from Boundless Valley has arrived. There is indeed a beast horde causing chaos. Elder Wu instructed you to go directly to the location marked in the jade slip after entering Boundless Valley to rescue the people, without needing to meet with him first."</p><p>"Understood!"</p><p>A spectral hand suddenly reached out from the flying boat, grabbed the jade slip, and retracted.</p><p>Then the flying boat trembled slightly and shot eastward with a 'whoosh'.</p><p>After their departure, the black-robed elder looked around and said in a deep voice, "Fellow disciples, activate the grand formation!"</p><p>"Activate the formation!"</p><p>"Activate the formation!"</p><p>...</p><p>Along with the shouts, the eight formed a circle, pressing their palms onto the stone tablet before them.</p><p>As their spiritual power flowed continuously into the tablet, it seemed to be cleansed of dust, gradually transforming into a transparent jade tablet.  The characters 'Verdant Sun' on the tablet radiated a dazzling brilliance.</p><p>Triggered by the stone tablet's transformation, the surrounding mountains were suddenly engulfed in swirling winds and clouds. The sea of clouds converged, and within moments, the Verdant Sun Devil Sect was completely sealed, including the stone tablet at the front of the mountain, along with the eight cultivators, all hidden within the sea of clouds.</p><p>For the other disciples, the sealing of the Verdant Sun Devil Sect's gate, aside from restricting entry and exit, had little impact. Seeing that it wasn't a major enemy attack, they were reassured and continued their cultivation as usual.</p><p>At this time, Qin Sang infiltrated Verdant Peak!</p><p>Only upon entering Verdant Peak did Qin Sang realize how chaotic the spiritual energy here was.  No wonder there were no restrictions or spirit formations around the mountain; they simply couldn't be maintained.</p><p>His figure quietly appeared, standing before a stone pillar. This pillar was shaped like a withered ancient tree, its top branching out in all directions.</p><p>Qin Sang tilted his head slightly, examining the green 'lanterns' hanging from the branches.</p><p>What Shi Ying brought back was already refined Verdant Essence.  This was Qin Sang's first time seeing raw Verdant Essence, and he found it quite novel.</p><p>It appeared as a wisp of ethereal air, yet it remained condensed and firmly attached to the branches.  Despite being so close, he couldn't sense any fluctuations from it.</p><p>Not far from Qin Sang, a Qi Refining disciple was absorbing Verdant Essence, completely unaware of being observed. Qin Sang took a few steps, silently arriving behind the disciple, and watched his actions.</p><p>The disciple channeled his Verdant Devil Flame, gently touching a wisp of Verdant Essence and executing dozens of hand seals in quick succession. Immediately, his Verdant Devil Flame grew stronger, as if it had absorbed nutrients from the Verdant Essence.</p><p>However, the ensuing consequence was that the previously docile Verdant Devil Flame suddenly became violent.</p><p>The disciple was clearly not experiencing this for the first time and remained calm. He channeled spiritual power into his palm, finally suppressing the restless flames before returning to his cave to cultivate.</p><p>Watching the disciple leave, Qin Sang shook his head slightly.  He didn't cultivate the Verdant Devil Flame and couldn't directly absorb the purest Verdant Essence like them.</p><p>Glancing around, Qin Sang found a relatively concealed wisp of Verdant Essence.</p><p>Standing before it, Qin Sang slowly closed his eyes, extending his right hand and cautiously probing, while simultaneously using his divine sense to perceive every minute change.</p><p>A moment later, Qin Sang opened his eyes, staring at the Verdant Essence with a furrowed brow.</p><p>No wonder the Verdant Essence at the foot of the mountain was in this form. Qin Sang discovered that the essence within these wisps wasn't pure enough. To cultivate with them, one would first have to refine the impurities and extract the pure essence.</p><p>Refining the impurities wasn't difficult, and Qin Sang had already thought of a method.  However, it would require some time, as Verdant Essence was very unstable and would dissipate with the slightest misstep!</p><p>He had limited time and couldn't waste it on this.</p><p>An idea struck Qin Sang.  He recalled some information he'd previously investigated. Verdant Essence had multiple forms, and it was highly likely that different forms of Verdant Essence had different levels of purity!</p><p>With this thought, Qin Sang didn't hesitate. He immediately activated his escape technique and sped towards the mountain summit.</p><p>As expected, the higher he went, the more condensed the Verdant Essence became, and the purer the essence within. Qin Sang was secretly delighted, increasing his speed even further.</p>
