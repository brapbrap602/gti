<h1>Chapter 1923: Talisman Spirit</h1><p>The three girls' mother, having regained her vitality after drinking the elixir water, also came up to help.</p><p>The mother was even busier than her daughters.</p><p>First, she pulled out the wild grass stuffed in her daughters' clothes, revealing their figures.  Then, she fetched water to wash away the grime from their faces and necks, tidied their hair, patted the dust off their clothes, and made them as presentable as possible.</p><p>"Back home, they were always clean, never this disheveled.  The world is too chaotic, I can only do this, only this...  Little girls love to be clean, but there's no way.  I'm useless, I'm sorry, I gave birth to you but can't protect you..."</p><p>The mother muttered to herself, as if explaining something to someone, but then she started to wipe away her tears.</p><p>The three girls were all quite comely and quick-witted. Without their mother saying anything, they understood her intentions, working diligently with reddened eyes, showcasing their efficiency and diligence.</p><p>Mortals couldn't see the Earth God. In their eyes, only Qin Sang was standing there.</p><p>The Earth God composed himself, refraining from any words of refusal.  He tightly gripped the jade pendant in his hand. A flash of white light enveloped him, revealing his form, although only the mother and daughters could see him.</p><p>"Ah!"</p><p>The three girls and their mother were startled to see a little old man suddenly appear beside Qin Sang.</p><p>However, recalling that Qin Sang was an immortal, the arrival of another immortal wasn't too surprising.</p><p>The Earth God looked at the mother, seeing through her thoughts. He coughed and said, "Don't delude yourself. The Daoist is an unparalleled celestial, possessing vast divine abilities. What kind of outstanding individual hasn't he seen? You've encountered the Daoist today and been given a new lease on life. This is due to the accumulated virtues of your ancestors. You should be content."</p><p>Her thoughts laid bare, the mother's face flushed with shame.  She mumbled softly, "My three daughters are all obedient and sensible. They know how to serve others and are very diligent. I see the young immortal doesn't have a maidservant. It would be good if he could choose one..."</p><p>The Earth God shook his head and sighed lightly. He couldn't blame her for her wishful thinking. When mortals encounter immortals, who could resist seeking immortal fate?</p><p>Among these people, who knew how many harbored the same thoughts as this mother?</p><p>"Fate, whether present or absent, is predetermined by Heaven.  Blindly seeking immortal fate will only invite disaster."</p><p>The Earth God spoke from the heart, offering a word of caution. He tapped the Earth-Stabilizing Staff in his hand. "I am the Earth God of this region. Due to the chaos in the world, I have long been without incense offerings, and my temple has been abandoned for a long time.  Seeing your motherly nature and judging from your speech, you are literate. I wish to re-establish my divine position and require someone to manage the mundane affairs in the temple. Are you willing to become my temple attendants?"</p><p>"Yes! Of course, we are willing! Quickly, pay respects to Grandpa Earth God!"</p><p>The mother's face was filled with joy, and she immediately tried to pull her daughters down to kneel, but the Earth God stopped them.</p><p>"After you assist the Daoist in distributing the elixir water, take this stone tablet and first find a place to stay in the Duzhi Kingdom. The stone tablet is imbued with divine power and can protect you. When the stone tablet becomes warm, it will guide you to the temple..."</p><p>The Earth God produced a palm-sized gray stone tablet, carved with his likeness,栩栩如生.</p><p>Having just received the jade pendant, he felt the weight of a thousand pounds on his shoulders.  He needed to think carefully, understand the situation, and then consider the matter of re-establishing his temple.</p><p>More refugees continued to arrive. Qin Sang and Xiao Wu stayed there for three days.</p><p>Many people drank the elixir water but were reluctant to leave. Finally, seeing no further benefits and that the immortal had no intention of accepting disciples, they set off for the Duzhi Kingdom.</p><p>Three nights later.</p><p>The figures on the dirt road became sparse.</p><p>Xiao Wu and the three girls, having some free time, squatted by the stove, gazing at the stars in the sky, occasionally adding firewood to the fire.</p><p>"Little Immortal Sister, look at that bright star!"</p><p>The youngest girl, nicknamed Yin'er, pointed to a star in the sky and said crisply.</p><p>The two older girls were more sensible and always treated Xiao Wu with a degree of reverence, being cautious in everything they did.  In contrast, Yin'er was the closest to Xiao Wu.</p><p>Qin Sang had cast an illusion on Xiao Wu.  Despite spending three days and nights together, they hadn't discovered that Xiao Wu was blind.</p><p>The spectacle of the three moons had ended after that midnight. The Blood Moon and the Dark Moon had hidden themselves somewhere, and now only a single bright moon hung high in the sky.</p><p>"My parents said that star is called the Matchmaker Star. If you pray to the Matchmaker Star, the Matchmaker will send us a good man."</p><p>Though young, Yin'er knew quite a bit, a shy expression appearing on her small face.  She suddenly asked, "Little Immortal Sister, will you marry someone in the future?"</p><p>"Marry?"</p><p>Xiao Wu hesitated. She had heard and seen so many stories and understood the meaning of marriage, but she had never considered it for herself.</p><p>"No," she shook her head slightly. "Why would I marry someone?"</p><p>"Can immortals not marry?"</p><p>Yin'er felt sorry for Xiao Wu. "Mother said marrying someone gives you support, someone like Father, who can protect us."</p><p>Xiao Wu shook her head. "I don't need anyone else's protection. Master will protect me."</p><p>Over these three days, Yin'er's father had rarely spoken, remaining silent, constantly gathering and carrying firewood, using this method to numb himself.  His wife didn't speak to him either.</p><p>'Slap!'</p><p>Hearing Yin'er's words, the father, huddled behind the woodpile, slapped himself hard, burying his face in his hands.</p><p>Hearing the suppressed sobs, the mother, with a complex expression, walked over and embraced her husband. The two wept in each other's arms.</p><p>The flames in the stove crackled.  The daughters didn't notice anything unusual.</p><p>Qin Sang sat cross-legged nearby.</p><p>The Earth God, taking advantage of Qin Sang's presence, was busy taming the group of demons.</p><p>For those demons that were unruly, the Earth God would activate the jade pendant, making them suffer until they understood their place and became obedient.</p><p>As for those whose demonic nature was difficult to eradicate, they were perfect for execution to establish authority.</p><p>Luo Hou and Zhu Que, having nothing to do, helped the Earth God tame the demons. Within three days, they had made these demons completely subservient to the Earth God, lining them up in the distance, awaiting orders.</p><p>...</p><p>"Finally here.  Three days, their reaction is rather slow."</p><p>Qin Sang, who was in meditation, suddenly opened his eyes, his gaze sharp as lightning, looking up towards the Duzhi Kingdom.</p><p>The Earth God was initially puzzled, but quickly sensed two auras rapidly approaching.  In the distance, he saw two white rainbows flying through the night sky.</p><p>"White Refining Escape Technique, it's Immortal cultivators from the Crane Pavilion," the Earth God whispered.</p><p>Among the renowned sects he had mentioned to Qin Sang earlier, the Crane Pavilion was one of them.</p><p>The Crane Pavilion was the righteous Immortal Sect of the Duzhi Kingdom, originally on par with Dragon Guard Mountain.</p><p>The Crane Pavilion collaborated with the Divine Dao, actively descending the mountain to protect the peace within the kingdom.  Demons dared not encroach, while Dragon Guard Mountain had been reduced to relocating their sect.</p><p>Qin Sang had anticipated this.  As the refugees entered the Duzhi Kingdom, the cultivators within the kingdom, upon learning of the events here, would definitely come to investigate.</p><p>'Whoosh! Whoosh!'</p><p>The two streaks of light approached rapidly, then abruptly stopped midway, having spotted the group of demons in the distance.</p><p>Only after confirming that Qin Sang and the Earth God appeared normal did they approach, descending from the sky.</p><p>The newcomers, one old and one young, both wore Daoist robes. One rode a white crane, a magnificent and obviously cultivated creature.</p><p>The old man was actually a Nascent Soul cultivator.</p><p>The Earth God recognized the old man's identity, his face showing surprise. He hurriedly bowed. "This humble god greets Pavilion Master Su."</p><p>This person was actually the current Pavilion Master of the Crane Pavilion!</p><p>"You are the Earth God of this region?"</p><p>Given Pavilion Master Su's status and cultivation, he wouldn't normally pay much attention to a minor Earth God, yet he meticulously returned the greeting and cupped his hands towards Qin Sang with a solemn expression.</p><p>"Who is this Daoist?"</p><p>"This humble Daoist is Qingfeng. Greetings, Pavilion Master Su," Qin Sang returned the greeting.</p><p>Pavilion Master Su mentally reviewed the name Daoist Qingfeng, confirming he had never heard of this person before. "Daoist Qingfeng is presumably not cultivating nearby? Forgive my presumption, but dare I ask where your immortal abode is?"</p><p>Pavilion Master Su had already seen the group of demons. Some possessed considerable cultivation, yet they were all behaving themselves.</p><p>The Earth God clearly didn't have the power to subdue this group of demons.</p><p>A Daoist with considerable cultivation appearing in this place, the Crane Pavilion naturally had to inquire about his intentions.</p><p>"This humble Daoist has no fixed abode. I came from the east, wandering here. Seeing the suffering of the people, I casually refined a few insignificant pills, hoping I haven't caused any inconvenience to the Crane Pavilion or fellow Daoist," Qin Sang said frankly.</p><p>"The Daoist's act of providing medicine and saving lives is a righteous deed, worthy of admiration.  How could it cause any inconvenience?"</p><p>Pavilion Master Su hesitated slightly, then probed, "The Daoist presumably disapproves of the demons' rampage. I wonder if you have any good strategies for demon expulsion?"</p><p>Qin Sang saw through him immediately. Pavilion Master Su's concern for demon expulsion was feigned; his true interest lay in Qin Sang's purpose here.</p><p>"Demons are rampant. Even if temporarily pacified, powerful demons from Twilight Fall Mountain could descend at any time to wreak havoc.  Unless all sects unite, the Immortal Dao enters the world, and joins forces with the Divine Dao, it will only address the symptoms, not the root cause, and won't change the situation. This humble Daoist is merely a wandering Daoist, unable to devise any effective strategies.  To be honest with Fellow Daoist Su, this humble Daoist came here to search for something."</p><p>Qin Sang didn't conceal his purpose, stating his intentions directly.</p><p>"Oh?  I wonder what the Daoist is seeking. If it's confirmed to be near the Duzhi Kingdom, this Su might be able to provide some clues," Pavilion Master Su's eyes flickered as he countered.</p><p>"This humble Daoist is searching for an ancient altar. This altar has three levels: a circular upper altar, an octagonal middle altar, and a square lower altar.  Its design is archaic, not of this era. It's likely damaged, perhaps only the altar base remains..."</p><p>Qin Sang described the altar's various characteristics to Pavilion Master Su.</p><p>Hearing this, Pavilion Master Su pondered for a moment, then shook his head. "This Su has never heard of such an altar. Since the Daoist says it's an ancient artifact, after countless years of change, it's probably buried deep underground."</p><p>Qin Sang showed disappointment, then continued, "This humble Daoist is most fond of thunder arts, hence my travels throughout the world, visiting fellow Daoists who also excel in thunder arts, to discuss and exchange insights.  If Pavilion Master Su knows of such Daoists, could you kindly introduce one or two?"</p><p>Hearing this, the disciple standing behind Pavilion Master Su's expression shifted slightly. He glanced at his master's back, but remained silent.</p><p>Pavilion Master Su shook his head again. "I'm afraid I must disappoint the Daoist.  Among the Daoists this Su knows, none are renowned for their thunder arts."</p><p>Qin Sang expressed his regret. "It seems this humble Daoist can only search on my own. I may impose upon you in the future, I hope Pavilion Master Su won't mind."</p><p>"Not at all! With Daoist Qingfeng here, the demons will surely tremble in fear.  We are only too happy.  Wherever the Daoist needs assistance, simply send a message to our sect, and this Su will lead my disciples to aid you."</p><p>Having ascertained Qin Sang's intentions, Pavilion Master Su exchanged some pleasantries. He didn't invite Qin Sang to visit his sect, but after a few more words, he found an excuse to take his leave.</p><p>Master and disciple mounted the crane, transforming into two white streaks, soaring through the air.</p><p>Watching their departing light, Qin Sang's eyes flickered. He called out to Xiao Wu, "The matter here is concluded, we should also leave."</p><p>Qin Sang handed the remaining pills to the Earth God and mounted his horse with Xiao Wu.</p><p>The family and the Earth God were all very reluctant.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>The Azure Steed conjured a demonic wind, rising into the air.</p><p>"Goodbye, Little Immortal Sister! You must come visit us again in the future!" Yin'er shouted loudly from below.</p><p>Xiao Wu simply waved, making no promises. After all, there might not be another opportunity to come here again.</p><p>...</p><p>Let's now turn to Pavilion Master Su and his disciple. After bidding farewell to Qin Sang, they rode their spiritual crane back to the Duzhi Kingdom.</p><p>The disciple had been wanting to speak but hesitated.  Only when they were nearing the Duzhi Kingdom, certain they couldn't be overheard, did he ask, "Master, isn't Senior Taiyi extremely proficient in thunder arts?"</p><p>Pavilion Master Su, sitting cross-legged on the crane's back, his eyes slightly closed, said indifferently, "Are you suggesting I introduce Fellow Daoist Taiyi to Daoist Qingfeng?"</p><p>"I remember you mentioning that Senior Taiyi once lamented the lack of fellow Daoists to exchange insights on thunder arts with, saying that self-study without interaction makes it difficult to attain the Great Dao.  This Daoist Qingfeng travels extensively seeking Dao companions. He must also be a master of thunder arts, perhaps the very person Senior Taiyi is looking for," the disciple said.</p><p>"You still lack experience, easily misled by appearances. Don't assume that just because that Daoist dispensed elixir water and helped the needy that he's a good person.  Demons in this world are cunning and deceitful, often disguising themselves as righteous cultivators."</p><p>Pavilion Master Su sighed lightly.  "Fellow Daoist Taiyi has lived in seclusion for many years. Only I and a few close friends can see him. He never reveals his true form when slaying demons.  I once asked him the reason, but he avoided answering.  He likely has hidden difficulties. I fear Fellow Daoist Taiyi may have provoked a powerful enemy and is hiding here to avoid disaster. If that Daoist came seeking revenge, and we directly lead him to Fellow Daoist Taiyi, wouldn't we be leading a wolf into the sheepfold?"</p><p>He patiently explained the stakes, guiding his disciple.</p><p>The disciple suddenly realized, ashamedly saying, "It was my rashness, Master."</p><p>The Duzhi Kingdom's border was in sight.  Pavilion Master Su said, "You return first. I will visit Fellow Daoist Taiyi. It's better if he's not an enemy. Let Fellow Daoist Taiyi decide whether to meet that Daoist himself."</p><p>With that, master and disciple separated. Pavilion Master Su rode the crane south, following the Duzhi Kingdom's border until the southern edge, flying past the Jing Kingdom to the south, and continuing further.</p><p>Along the way, Pavilion Master Su frequently cast spells to detect, guarding against being followed.</p><p>'Screech!'</p><p>The spiritual crane descended from the sky, letting out a cry.</p><p>Below were layer upon layer of continuous mountain peaks, with clear water like mirrors in the valleys, and green mountains reflected on the water, creating an exceptionally picturesque scene.</p><p>"Is it Pavilion Master Su? Why are you not guarding the Duzhi Kingdom and deterring demons at this time, but have the leisure to visit my humble abode?"</p><p>A deep voice echoed from the mountains.  On a mountain peak, an old man in white robes appeared.</p><p>The old man's expression and demeanor exuded an ethereal aura, like an immortal, smiling as he looked at Pavilion Master Su.</p><p>"I encountered a strange matter, a Daoist..."</p><p>Pavilion Master Su didn't keep him in suspense, recounting his previous experience.</p><p>Unexpectedly, upon hearing the word "altar," the old man's expression changed instantly, revealing an unprecedented urgency.  "Altar? What altar is he looking for? What is this person's background?"</p><p>Seeing this, Pavilion Master Su realized something was amiss.  He opened his mouth to speak, but his expression suddenly changed drastically as he looked behind the old man, as if he had seen a ghost.</p><p>Standing behind the old man was Qin Sang.</p><p>The old man whirled around, his palms crackling with lightning.</p><p>Qin Sang remained unfazed, studying the old man with a strange expression.  "Talisman Spirit Communication, quite rare! You call yourself Taiyi, are you the Taiyi Thunder Drill Talisman or the Taiyi Thunder罡 Talisman?"</p>
