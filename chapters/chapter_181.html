<h1>**Chapter 174: Entrust**</h1><p>"Slap!"</p><p>After a fierce struggle, the zombie was knocked away by the Jade Ruyi Talisman. Qin Sang followed closely behind and pierced the zombie's head with his flying sword, destroying its "primal spirit" and killing it.</p><p>Qing Ting immediately collapsed to the ground. The Jade Ruyi Talisman transformed into a talisman paper and floated down from mid-air, landing on the ground. A faint crack appeared in the middle of the talisman paper, indicating that the talisman's power had been significantly depleted.</p><p>Qin Sang ignored the zombie and stepped in front of Qing Ting, gently lifting her. He could tell whether her injuries were real or fake.</p><p>Placing his palm on her back, he continuously poured spiritual energy into Qing Ting's body, helping to suppress the corpse poison and examine her wounds. Qing Ting offered no resistance, allowing Qin Sang's spiritual energy to flow through her meridians, expelling the surface corpse poison and煞Qi.</p><p>After a moment, Qin Sang withdrew his palm, looking at Qing Ting with complex emotions. He wanted to speak but hesitated, finally letting out a sigh.</p><p>It was just as Qing Ting had said before. Not only was her spiritual energy nearly exhausted, but the corpse poison had also invaded her heart meridian. She had done well to hold on and use the talisman to help Qin Sang attack the zombie. There was no way to save her.</p><p>Unless there was a cultivator who was extremely proficient in alchemy, but with Qing Ting's life hanging by a thread, where could they find one?</p><p>Qing Ting had been staring at Qin Sang. Seeing his expression, her eyes dimmed, but she quickly smiled, her voice unusually weak and hoarse.</p><p>"Junior Brother Qin, there is no need to worry. Death is not something I fear, cough..."</p><p>Qing Ting coughed violently, as if her lungs were being ripped apart.</p><p>Qin Sang took out a healing pill and gave it to Qing Ting. Her complexion improved slightly, but it was only a temporary recovery. She suddenly pointed to a pile of rubble in the corner of the hall and said urgently, "Junior Brother Qin, there are some broken bones there. Please check if there are any relics."</p><p>Qin Sang raised an eyebrow, secretly surprised. Even at this moment, Qing Ting was still concerned about the relics of the skeleton. However, under Qing Ting's expectant gaze, he released a surge of spiritual energy that transformed into a giant hand, gathering the entire pile of rubble.</p><p>As expected, they found some broken bones, but no other relics.</p><p>Qin Sang showed each item to Qing Ting, but the expectation in her eyes gradually disappeared. In the end, she chuckled bitterly and murmured, "That's okay, too. I'm already dying. What would be the point even if I found them..."</p><p>As she spoke, Qing Ting suddenly summoned all her strength to sit up and solemnly said to Qin Sang, "Junior Brother Qin, the crisis is not over. Qing Ting is a dying person. I don't dare waste any more of Junior Brother Qin's time. I didn't expect there to be so much Earth煞Qi accumulated in the cave, implicating Junior Brother Qin and the other fellow Daoists. But rest assured, Junior Brother Qin. Once you open the iron door and continue forward, you will reach the Celestial Corpse Sect's forbidden ground. Once you arrive there and activate the dungeon's restrictions, you will be able to resist the Earth煞Qi. Once the Earth煞Qi recedes, you will be able to leave this place."</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at Qing Ting. "Senior Sister, you know this is the Celestial Corpse Sect?"</p><p>Qing Ting nodded but didn't explain further. She smiled wryly. "To die in such a place, I can only entrust my last wishes to Junior Brother Qin. I sold all my belongings to refine the Fire Crow Formation, so I have nothing left on me. Only this talisman and the Black Tiger remains in my mustard seed bag. I give them all to Junior Brother Qin. I only wish you could help me with one last thing."</p><p>If it was a small favor, Qin Sang naturally didn't mind. He asked, "Senior Sister, please tell me."</p><p>He watched as Qing Ting took out a black cloth bag from her undergarment. Qin Sang's eyes narrowed in surprise. It was a Corpse Puppet Bag!</p><p>He didn't know if she had obtained it from the outside world or if she had just found it. But the fact that she kept it close to her body... Could it be that there was a corpse puppet sealed inside?</p><p>Qing Ting opened the Corpse Puppet Bag, and a crystal coffin flew out, landing gently in front of the two of them. Lying in the crystal coffin wasn't a corpse puppet, but a person.</p><p>A square face, sharp eyebrows, and a high nose. He was tall and muscular. Although he lay motionless in the crystal coffin, he exuded an indomitable spirit and extraordinary charisma.</p><p>However, this person now looked like a corpse, without a trace of life. His skin was devoid of any color.</p><p>Seeing his appearance, Qin Sang suddenly recalled something and asked softly, "Senior Sister, is this Senior Brother Jiang?"</p><p>Qing Ting nodded slightly, her eyes filled with longing and love. She stared at his face, afraid that she would never see it again.</p><p>Qin Sang fell silent. When he was in the Qi Refining Stage, he had heard some fellow disciples gossiping that Senior Sister Qing Ting's Dao Companion was surnamed Jiang. The two of them were like celestial beings, deeply in love.</p><p>Later, Senior Brother Jiang had an accident while practicing outside, and he was said to have died. Unexpectedly, Senior Sister Qingting kept Senior Brother Jiang's body in a crystal coffin.</p><p>No!</p><p>When Qin Sang used his divine consciousness to scan the crystal coffin, he found that Senior Brother Jiang's body still had fluctuations in his soul. Although it was extremely weak, it was like a candle in the wind.</p><p>He was still alive!</p><p>Qingting stretched out her hand and pressed it against the crystal coffin. She opened it and hugged Senior Brother Jiang's body tightly. Holding his hand, she said to Qin Sang in a gentle voice, "Senior Brother's soul was badly damaged. I have tried every possible way to cure him, but I can only slow down the speed at which his soul dissipates... To us as a couple, death might be a kind of liberation. I just hope that Junior Brother Qin can bury me and Senior Brother together after you leave this predicament. We shared a bed in life, and we will share a grave in death."</p><p>After leaving the crystal coffin, Senior Brother Jiang's flesh quickly decayed, and the fluctuations in his soul also dissipated at an alarming rate.</p><p>At this moment, something shocking happened. Senior Brother Jiang's fingers suddenly moved slightly, and he held Qingting's hand feebly but firmly.</p><p>Qingting had a face full of surprise, and she threw herself into Senior Brother Jiang's arms, crying out loud.</p><p>It was as if she had been suppressing countless years of misery and despair, and her grief was overwhelming.</p><p>A tear also ran down the corner of Senior Brother Jiang's eyes.</p><p>Corpse Talisman of Heaven!</p><p>Inspiration flashed in Qin Sang's mind, and he suddenly understood what Qingting was looking for.</p><p>The Corpse Talisman of Heaven would turn Senior Brother Jiang into a corpse puppet, but it could merge with his soul and seal it, which might be able to prevent the soul from dissipating.</p><p>According to the Corpse Sutra of the Heavenly Darkness, after being sealed by the Corpse Talisman of Heaven, the process is irreversible. Senior Brother Jiang would definitely become a corpse puppet, and his soul would also undergo strange changes, making recovery impossible.</p><p>However, in the world of immortal cultivation, as long as there is hope, anything can happen. The true end is when the soul dissipates.</p><p>The Buddha's Jade would certainly be able to resist the Corpse Talisman of Heaven, but Qin Sang would not use himself to test this.</p><p>After Senior Brother Jiang's soul had completely dissipated, Senior Sister Qingting let out all her pent-up emotions. However, there was not a hint of fear on her face because she was about to die; instead, there was a strange look in her eyes.</p><p>She took back her storage pouch and her talismanic treasure and handed them to Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced inside the storage pouch and saw that there was nothing but the body of the black tiger and some low-value items. It was clear that Qingting had been drained of all her possessions by the Fire Raven Order.</p><p>Qin Sang had no use for these things, so he said, "Does Senior Sister Qingting have any relatives?"</p>
