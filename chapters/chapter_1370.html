<h1>Chapter 1362: Closed-Door Breakthrough</h1><p>Until he cultivates spiritual essence and advances to the Spiritual Treasure stage, Wu Mu Sword no longer needs refined spirit wood.</p><p>A lack of foresight breeds immediate worry.</p><p>If there’s a chance to obtain the Ten Great Spirit Woods, Qin Sang doesn't want to miss it.</p><p>After the monsters in Blood Lake awoke last time, he planned to wait for the chaos to subside and strengthen himself before returning to search for the Interdimensional Blood Mulberry. Unexpectedly, this incident occurred.</p><p>The Grandmaster Cang Hong and other Yuan Ying cultivators from the Abyssal Prison have been exploring the depths of the Heavenly Scar, searching for fragments of the Abyssal Ruins.  If lucky, the main body of the Abyssal Ruins might not be completely destroyed.</p><p>When he has free time, Qin Sang also intends to personally investigate Blood Lake.</p><p>However, judging from the various messages coming from the Abyssal Prison, the chances are slim. The Inner Valley of the Boundless Valley is even more thoroughly destroyed than the depths of the Heavenly Scar, making it another dead end.</p><p>Qin Sang holds high hopes for the third spirit wood and has been considering contacting the Pure Yang Sect.</p><p>With the Red-haired Ancestor's death and the sect's division, it's a perfect opportunity to take advantage of the situation.</p><p>But the news brought by Jiang Xue wasn't encouraging.</p><p>Initially, the Pure Yang Sect had practically exhausted all its resources. The Red-haired Ancestor even left the sect multiple times to personally search for the Vajra Fruit, ultimately finding nothing.</p><p>Centuries have passed, making it almost impossible to find any trace or clue.</p><p>The Pure Yang Sect has long since given up.</p><p>That Blood Nether Sect disciple is probably already reduced to bones, buried with the Vajra Fruit under some unknown expanse of sand.</p><p>That's why Jiang Xue so easily revealed this matter to Qin Sang.</p><p>Searching for the Vajra Fruit in the Northern Star Great Desert is like looking for a needle in a haystack.</p><p>However, having received the information, how can he rest easy without giving it a try?</p><p>As the leader of a sect, he doesn't lack manpower. Such matters of widespread investigation and information gathering don't require his personal involvement; his disciples are more than capable.</p><p>Qin Sang flicked out a stream of light.</p><p>Upon seeing this, the white cat leaped out of Peach Blossom Valley and soon returned with Li Yu Fu.</p><p>"Disciple greets Senior Uncle."</p><p>Li Yu Fu's brows still held traces of joy.</p><p>Establishing the Green Goat Temple was the last wish of Yun Youzi, a great weight on Li Yu Fu's heart.  Having finally fulfilled his long-cherished wish, Li Yu Fu was even more excited than Qin Sang, the temple master.</p><p>"Come in and speak..."</p><p>Qin Sang inquired about the trivial matters of the Green Goat Temple.</p><p>Li Yu Fu entered the cave dwelling and answered one by one.</p><p>In short, the Green Goat Temple is flourishing and has a bright future!</p><p>As long as Qin Sang, the temple master, continues to grow stronger, and successors emerge, with Yuan Ying cultivators constantly appearing, it’s not impossible for the Green Goat Temple to become the leading sect in the Little Cold Domain and even the Northern Star Region!</p><p>With the Heart Light Meditation Cushion, this is not a vain hope.</p><p>After hearing this, Qin Sang said: "This is all I can do.  From now on, you must not slacken in your cultivation; otherwise, even if the Green Goat Temple flourishes, it will only be a fleeting glory.  Especially you, Yu Fu, a genius with exceptional talent, second only to a Heaven Spirit Root cultivator. Your Grandmaster and I have high hopes for you.  From now on, leave the temple's affairs to Yi En and Han Qiu."</p><p>"Disciple understands!"</p><p>Li Yu Fu responded solemnly.</p><p>Qin Sang further instructed: "I need to enter closed-door cultivation again, and it will probably take at least several decades, or even a century.  Unless it's a major matter, do not disturb me in Peach Blossom Valley.  As for the Northern Star Alliance meetings, you will represent me and listen to Daoist Jing Yu."</p><p>Li Yu Fu accepted each instruction, then suddenly realizing something, his face lit up with surprise, "Senior Uncle is about to break through again?"</p><p>He found it incredible.  How long has it been since his Senior Uncle formed his Yuan Ying? Could he possibly break through to the mid-Yuan Ying stage within a hundred years?</p><p>His Grandmaster once said his Senior Uncle had a natural five-spirit root, could that be false?</p><p>He needs to consider that his Senior Uncle was around the same age as him when he formed his Yuan Ying, while he is still stuck in the Golden Core stage.</p><p>Li Yu Fu fell into deep self-doubt.</p><p>"Two more things…"</p><p>Qin Sang took out a visiting card and gave it to Li Yu Fu.</p><p>"After you return, arrange for some people to go out for training and to search for clues on my behalf. When you reach the desert, first present this visiting card to Daoist Lu…"</p><p>Mainly two things.</p><p>One is Tan Hao's whereabouts, the other is news about the Vajra Fruit.</p><p>After a moment's thought, Qin Sang said in a low voice, "If you find any trace of Tan Hao, report it immediately, and remember not to act rashly!"</p><p>Tan Hao has been missing for too long, and the mysterious person behind it is of uncertain disposition, and Qin Sang has a bad feeling about it.</p><p>A short while later.</p><p>Li Yu Fu respectfully left the cave dwelling.  He paused at the exit, spoke to the white cat for a few words, then flew out of Peach Blossom Valley.</p><p>The white cat raised its front paw, closing the Peach Blossom Valley's restrictions, and returned to its own cave.</p><p>A gentle breeze blew.</p><p>Peach blossoms were fragrant.</p><p>From then on, Peach Blossom Valley became a sacred place in the hearts of the Green Goat Temple disciples.</p><p>And Qin Sang, their temple master, disappeared for several decades.</p><p>…</p><p>In the cave dwelling.</p><p>Qin Sang added several layers of protective restrictions, then awakened the Fat Silkworm and fed it a Toxic Algae Fruit.</p><p>He had only a few poisonous algae fruits left, and hadn't found another food that the fat silkworm liked. He estimated he could only raise the fat silkworm to the late third transformation stage at most.</p><p>The Sky-Eyed Butterfly was also in a difficult situation.</p><p>Qin Sang had exchanged several rare spirit medicines at the trading fair, but the Sky-Eyed Butterfly was uninterested in all of them. It usually only drank spirit dew, offering minimal help.</p><p>Since breaking through to the fourth transformation, the Sky-Eyed Butterfly's cultivation had hardly improved. Qin Sang truly felt the difficulty of cultivating spirit insects.</p><p>The road connecting to the Canglang Sea was cut off, making a trip to the Witch Tribe to search for secret techniques impossible.</p><p>All Qin Sang could do was collect various spirit flowers and dews that spirit insects liked, testing them one by one.</p><p>The Fire Jade Centipede, however, remained interested in the Fire Melting Pill, showing signs of breaking through to the mid-third transformation stage. He expected that he wouldn't have to worry about it during the third transformation period.</p><p>But the bottleneck of the fourth transformation remained a major hurdle.</p><p>Fortunately, Qin Sang didn't rely on the Fire Jade Centipede in battle, only valuing its treasure-hunting ability.</p><p>After feeding the three spirit insects, Qin Sang sat cross-legged. His spirit body puppet sat opposite him.</p><p>The Qianjun Ring glowed, and a jade box flew out.</p><p>The jade box opened, revealing a Corpse Flower Amber.</p><p>After purification by the spirit vein, the Corpse Flower Amber was completely free of blood poison, extremely pure, and translucent, like a spirit flower carved from crystal.</p><p>Having already refined one Corpse Flower Amber, Qin Sang's next actions were very skillful.</p><p>He closed his eyes, silently activating his true energy, and performing the secret technique Jingyu had taught him.</p><p>As Qin Sang moved, the Corpse Flower Amber rotated gently. Beams of light flew from Qin Sang's body, forming a small vortex around the Corpse Flower Amber.</p><p>The vortex spun faster and faster.</p><p>'Crackle…'</p><p>The Corpse Flower Amber began to vibrate, fine cracks appearing on its surface.</p><p>Qin Sang tapped his fingers, countless runes entering the Amber. The crystal shattered with a 'pop', and countless fragments melted into a pool of pure spirit liquid.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>The liquid disappeared instantly.</p><p>Simultaneously, a stream of spirit liquid appeared around Qin Sang's spirit body, circling it.</p><p>Finally, the liquid formed a cocoon-like shape, enveloping the spirit body, expanding and contracting like a breath.</p><p>Qin Sang's breath calmed down as he slowly refined the medicinal power.</p><p>Truly a peerless spirit medicine that can help a transforming monster break through!</p><p>And Qin Sang had three such medicines!</p><p>During the refinement process, Qin Sang's cultivation improved at an astonishing rate. If anyone saw it, they would be dumbfounded!</p>
