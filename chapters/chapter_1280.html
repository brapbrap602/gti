<h1>Chapter 1272: A Dream of Millet</h1><p>Dongyang Bo was certain that Qin Sang would not dare to kill him in front of everyone. As long as he was careful, he had little to fear from any underhanded moves Qin Sang might make. Qin Sang had indeed removed his mask. Dongyang Bo keenly noticed that the attitudes of others toward Qin Sang were intriguing, carrying a hint of wariness and respectâ€”a clear indication of the status that strength brought. After learning about the events within the Blood Gate, Dongyang Bo was even more astonished. Qin Sang's performance had surpassed his expectations. Destroying the avatar of the Demon Lord Ye was an unprecedented feat for the alliance of the two realms!</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang slightly raised his head and exchanged a glance with Dongyang Bo. Their gazes were calm and unflinching, meeting briefly before parting. Qin Sang had already guessed Dongyang Bo's intentions. He chose to conceal the details of their earlier conflict, not only to avoid a public confrontation that would force others to take sides but also to cover up his own disgraceful act of betraying an ally. Even if Dongyang Bo tried to shift the blame onto him, others might not believe his lies. Sometimes, the truth didn't matter. Qin Sang had obtained the Nascent Soul Talisman Puppet and naturally had no reason to bring it up. The only one who knew the full story, Qing Jun, seeing the two men acting as if nothing had happened, could only sigh at the meeting of two formidable minds.</p><p>At this moment, the Nether Demon Lord, who had gone to investigate the blood mist, returned and said gravely, "The monsters resemble flesh puppets, with similar strength, but they are even more violent and bloodthirsty. This place is perilous. What do you all think?" The group exchanged uneasy glances. Earlier, they had each harbored their own thoughts. Some wanted to return to the Black Tower Formation to explore the ruins and search for treasures. Others wanted to look for fragments of the Blood Mulberry of the Netherworld. But now, none of that seemed possible. If these monsters continued to roam freely instead of returning to slumber, it would be nearly impossible to enter the Blood Lake again in the future.</p><p>After a brief discussion with Qing Jun, Qin Sang decided to leave. Jing Yu had not found the Blood Mulberry of the Netherworld in the blood pool, and the Blood Lake was vast. Searching for it here would be like looking for a needle in a haystack. Without the protection of the Nine Palaces Formation, the situation was too unpredictable. Even with his exceptional escape techniques, Qin Sang would not be able to survive if surrounded by monsters. He had plenty of time and would have other opportunities in the future.</p><p>The Nether Demon Lord, understanding the group's thoughts, asked for Qin Sang's and a few others' opinions before coldly stating, "Whether to stay or leave is up to you. However, I must warn you that if there is any sign of the monsters breaking out of the Blood Lake, we will seal it immediately!" Upon hearing this, the group stirred uneasily. The strongest among them were unwilling to take the risk. No one knew where the treasures were, and searching aimlessly would be futile. If they missed their chance, even if they survived, they would be trapped in the Blood Lake forever. Unless they had Jing Yu's luck and waited for someone to rescue them, who would dare to stay?</p><p>Reluctantly, the group cast one last glance at the Black Tower Formation, sighed inwardly, and agreed to retreat. Dongyang Bo entered the Nine Palaces Formation. They took turns controlling the jade talismans, with Dongyang Bo leading the way, avoiding the territories of the monster leaders as they swiftly navigated through the blood mist, searching for an exit. Fortunately, the monsters they encountered along the way were manageable, and they dealt with them before alerting others.</p><p>As they neared the edge of the basin, the three disciples of the Supreme Unity Alchemy Sect suddenly began to argue. "Master, you must not! The ancient restrictions there are extremely powerful and dangerous..." Si Di exclaimed, stepping in front of Chongyi Daoist to block his path. The group turned their attention to them, having noticed the three whispering among themselves since leaving the Blood Gate.</p><p>"Outrageous!" Chongyi Daoist angrily rebuked, asserting his authority as their master. "Do I need your permission to do as I please? Although we failed to break through before, the ancient restrictions were weakened when the seal was broken. This is the perfect opportunity."</p><p>Another disciple, Yao Jing, seeing that Chongyi Daoist's mind was made up, said, "I will accompany you, Master, along with Senior Brother."</p><p>"Foolish! I am already halfway to the Yellow Springs. My death is of little consequence. But if you are implicated, what meaning would there be in my centuries of toil?" Unable to persuade them, Chongyi Daoist roared in frustration, "Let all present bear witness! If these two unfilial disciples dare to take a single step after I am gone, I will expel them from the Supreme Unity Alchemy Sect today, and they shall never set foot in it again! Let this be sworn before heaven and earth!"</p><p>With that, Chongyi Daoist flicked his horsetail whisk, drawing a deep line on the ground. Si Di and Yao Jing, seeing their master's resolve, trembled with grief. The Nether Demon Lord and others, understanding the situation, tried to dissuade him. "This place is too dangerous, Daoist. Please reconsider!"</p><p>Chongyi Daoist clasped his hands in a salute and said calmly, "The Heavenly Tribulation approaches, and my time is short. Rather than clinging to life, I would rather take this chance. Farewell, fellow Daoists!" The news of the ancient cultivators had once given him a glimmer of hope, but it had now turned into a fleeting dream. Chongyi Daoist had devoted his life to his sect, and with two Nascent Soul cultivators now guarding the Supreme Unity Alchemy Sect, he was free of all attachments. With a smile, he faced death.</p><p>As he raised his horsetail whisk and strode into the blood mist, a faint song echoed:</p><p>"In youth, I ascended Supreme Unity,  </p><p>A carefree immortal, bold and free.  </p><p>A thousand years passed in the blink of an eye,  </p><p>A dream of millet, gone as I lie."</p><p>The group watched in silence as Chongyi Daoist's figure disappeared into the depths of the blood mist. Among them, some had only recently formed their Nascent Souls and had yet to feel the pressure of the Heavenly Tribulation. Others were in situations similar to Chongyi Daoist's but were held back by too many concerns, lacking the courage to risk everything. Yet, all could understand Chongyi Daoist's feelings. Even Dongyang Bo, who had never been on good terms with him, felt a genuine respect for the old man.</p><p>They worked together to dissuade Si Di and Yao Jing and continued their rush toward the edge of the Blood Lake. Along the way, they noticed that the number of monsters was increasing. In silence, they finally made it back to the entrance of the Blood Lake's seal, relieved to see that the monsters had not yet gathered there. They quickly flew out. A few figures were waiting outside the seal, their faces pale with fear as they stared at the Blood Lake. They were the Golden Core cultivators who had entered earlier, now reduced to less than a third of their original number.</p><p>After flying out of the Blood Lake, the group did not leave immediately, nor did they rush to restore the seal. Instead, they worked together to clear the wandering monsters, waiting for Chongyi Daoist. Touched by his resolve, they were unusually united. Si Di and Yao Jing guarded Chongyi Daoist's soul tablet, restless and anxious.</p><p>Qin Sang observed the group. The newly ascended Nascent Soul cultivators seemed deep in thought. They had only heard of the Heavenly Tribulation before, but now they were facing its cruelty for the first time. Qing Jun remained composed, her Dao heart steadfast, unmoved by external influences. Jing Yu's eyes flickered with relief. Though he had paid the price of two hundred years of imprisonment, he had ultimately achieved his goal, obtaining the Corpse Flower Blood Amber and securing a slim chance of survival. The older Nascent Soul cultivators, including the Nether Demon Lord, all wore solemn expressions, each facing the threat of the Heavenly Tribulation to varying degrees.</p><p>Dongyang Bo stood alone at the periphery, hands behind his back, gazing at the sky, lost in thought. Time passed minute by minute. The Blood Lake grew increasingly chaotic. Qin Sang also joined the effort, and the group worked together to clear the monsters. But it was clear they could not hold out much longer. The monsters had discovered the breach in the seal and were beginning to converge on it. Still, there was no sign of Chongyi Daoist.</p><p>*Crack!*</p><p>A faint sound, like a thunderclap, echoed in everyone's hearts. The soul tablet had shattered.</p>
