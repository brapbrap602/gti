<h1>Chapter 1962: Heavenpulse Sect</h1><p>White mist flowed like a river.</p><p>The members of the Yin family traveled on their magical treasures, stopping and starting. Yin Heqian's gaze swept over the surroundings, as if searching for something within the forest.</p><p>Standing on either side of him were a man and a woman, both with the rosy complexion of youth despite their snowy hair. Each held a compass-like artifact, steadily supported in their palms, channeling their True Essence into it.</p><p>At the center of each artifact, a circular mirror-like surface emitted a faint light, reflecting the features of the two elders.</p><p>The other members of the Yin family also wielded their respective magical treasures, their faces etched with vigilance.</p><p>Nian Hui stood alone at the rear, her expression and demeanor as cold and detached as ever, seemingly out of sync with the rest of the group.</p><p>In truth, within the entire Yin family, only Yin Qiao'er could hold a conversation with her.  Nian Hui spent most of her time in secluded cultivation, and many of the younger generation within the Yin family were unaware of her existence.</p><p>Yin Heqian's eyes, radiating a silver mystical light, scanned the area. In a deep voice, he asked, "Elder, Elder, do the Yuanhui Twin Compasses show any reaction? Have you discovered anything?"</p><p>The two elders remained silent, their eyes closed as they focused on channeling their energy into the Yuanhui Twin Compasses.  After a stick of incense had burned, they slowly spoke.</p><p>"Reporting to the Family Head, the flow of the earth's energy veins in these mountains shows some discernible patterns, indeed bearing some resemblance to the descriptions in ancient records. Time changes all things, mountains and rivers shift, whether this truly is the ancient Heavenpulse Sect remains to be verified. However, if this is the site of the Heavenpulse Sect, their Pulse Profound Pagoda must be located there!"</p><p>The white-haired man to Yin Heqian's left pointed towards an area diagonally ahead. The woman nodded in agreement.</p><p>"Legend says the Pulse Profound Pagoda is the Heavenpulse Sect's greatest treasure, intrinsically linked to their rise and fall. I wonder what kind of treasure it is, to possess such immense power."</p><p>Yin Heqian manipulated his magical treasure, flying towards the direction indicated by the white-haired man, sighing as he spoke.</p><p>"It must be a supreme treasure! Obtaining it would be like adding wings to a tiger for the Family Head, ensuring the Yin family's great prosperity!"</p><p>"Indeed! I still remember, decades ago, two thunderous booms shook the Yan Kingdom, followed by silence. Back then, rumors of the Heavenpulse Sect's imminent reappearance began to circulate within the cultivation world. The Bai Li clan, Ancient Sheep Mountain, and the Hengyu Gate all sent people to search for years, but found nothing.  Unexpectedly, we've stumbled upon a clue.  If we manage to be the first to arrive, it would truly be a testament to the Yin family's flourishing destiny!"</p><p>...</p><p>Those around him echoed his sentiments.</p><p>Yin Heqian showed no signs of pride. Shaking his head slightly, he said calmly, "It's too early to celebrate.  Let's wait until the two elders find concrete evidence before rejoicing."</p><p>As they spoke, they flew over dozens of mountain ranges.</p><p>"Wait!"</p><p>The white-haired man suddenly called a halt.  The artifact in his hand flashed, the mirror within reflecting a panoramic view of the mountains and rivers surrounding them, as if they were looking down upon the earth from above.</p><p>Upon closer inspection, the terrain appeared rather peculiar.</p><p>The mountains here seemed unremarkable at first glance, but with a wider view, they appeared shorter than the surrounding peaks, as if the earth itself had sunk in that area.</p><p>Ordinarily, this subtle difference might go unnoticed, but combined with the information the Yin family had previously gathered, there was definitely something unusual about this place!</p><p>"Something's amiss!"</p><p>Yin Heqian extended his divine sense, sweeping it across the area, and discovered numerous caves.</p><p>The caves were clearly more concentrated here than elsewhere, distributed haphazardly without any discernible pattern. Some were located on the mountains, others in the valleys, but they all shared one common trait: they all led underground.</p><p>Above ground, there were no anomalies, no ruins related to a 'pagoda.' To find the Pulse Profound Pagoda, they might have to enter the caves and search underground.</p><p>However, with so many cave entrances, which one should they choose?</p><p>The ruins might contain remnants of the Heavenpulse Sect's formations and restrictions. Rushing in blindly would only invite more trouble.</p><p>"Protect the elders!"</p><p>Yin Heqian commanded in a low voice. The others immediately dispersed, forming a protective circle around the two elders, and joined forces to conceal their presence.</p><p>The two elders sat facing each other, raising their respective compasses, the bases touching, merging them into one.</p><p>A moment later, they both spat out a mouthful of blood. The blood seeped into the Yuanhui Twin Compasses, permeating the reflected image within the mirror. It was as if there truly was a space inside, and as the blood flowed in, it transformed into wriggling blood-red earthworms, each burrowing into a different cave entrance.</p><p>The Yuanhui Twin Compasses trembled in the elders' hands, and after a while, a burst of blood-red light erupted, staining a specific area, encompassing roughly twenty caves.</p><p>Everyone's gaze shifted towards the corresponding area in reality.</p><p>"Family Head, we've done our best. The true entrance is likely within this area," the white-haired man said, his face etched with fatigue.</p><p>"Thank you for your hard work, Elders! Two of you stay here to protect the elders, the rest, follow me!"</p><p>Yin Heqian flew towards the designated area.  Unable to discern anything unusual from above, he chose a cave and descended underground, the others following close behind.</p><p>Descending along the cave, the passage gradually narrowed, then suddenly opened up into a vast, spiderweb-like network of tunnels.</p><p>At first, they attempted to explore with their divine sense, but detected nothing unusual.  However, as they continued deeper, they felt an inexplicable pressure suppressing their divine sense, affecting even Yin Heqian, with his Nascent Soul cultivation.</p><p>"This must be the Heavenpulse Sect ruins!" someone exclaimed excitedly.</p><p>"Silence!" Yin Heqian rebuked, turning to Nian Hui behind him. "Fourth Sister, have you discovered anything?"</p><p>Nian Hui surveyed her surroundings, then took a jade cicada from her sleeve. Gently rubbing its wings, the jade cicada miraculously came to life, its wings vibrating with a low hum.</p><p>Invisible sound waves rippled outwards, persisting for an hour before the wings folded, and the cicada settled back into Nian Hui's palm.</p><p>"Not here," Nian Hui stated calmly.</p><p>The expressions of excitement on the others' faces faded, but no one questioned her.  They were all well aware of the power of the Nine-Tone Cicada artifact, and Nian Hui would never lie.</p><p>"Let's go!"</p><p>Yin Heqian decisively returned to the surface, choosing another cave entrance and continuing their descent.</p><p>They repeated this process several times, until finally, upon entering the eleventh cave, Nian Hui gave a completely different answer!</p><p>"There!"</p><p>Nian Hui pointed with a jade-like finger towards one of the tunnels, and flew in first.</p><p>The cave seemed bottomless.  They flew for a long time without reaching the end, but the unusual phenomena within the cave grew more frequent.</p><p>"There's another stone pool ahead!" a member of the Yin family transmitted his voice, his tone laced with tension.</p><p>Nian Hui and Yin Heqian stopped beside the stone pool.</p><p>On one side of the tunnel, the wall receded inwards, forming a deep, square pit, its walls made of solid stone.</p><p>They had encountered similar stone pools in other caves.</p><p>The pool contained no water, its four walls covered in cryptic murals. The lines of the murals were chaotic, carved directly into the stone with a blade, difficult to describe, ancient and peculiar.</p><p>Despite their crude appearance, the murals possessed a strange allure, making it difficult to look away.</p><p>After staring for a prolonged period, the two cultivators with the lowest cultivation levels began to feel dizzy and disoriented, nearly losing control of their True Essence.  The more the others studied the murals, the more eerie they felt, a chill creeping into their hearts.</p><p>The group paused, a few deliberately averting their gaze, unable to bear the sight of the murals any longer.</p><p>Fortunately, Nian Hui didn't linger for long, continuing onward.</p><p>The deeper they went, the more stone pools they encountered, and the more oppressive the eerie atmosphere became.</p><p>Just as the Yin family ventured deep underground, others entered the area from different directions, and not just one group.</p><p>Within another tunnel, a group of four advanced in silence. Leading the way was a man who appeared to be around forty years old, with a goatee and sharp, perceptive eyes, radiating an air of competence.</p><p>This group belonged to a prominent cultivation family near the Yan Kingdom, with the double surname Bai Li. Originally a small, ordinary family affiliated with a cultivation sect, they had been blessed with extraordinary fortune.  Each successive family head had been a visionary leader, guiding the Bai Li clan towards gradual expansion. Now, with three Nascent Soul ancestors, they were a force to be reckoned with in the region surrounding the Yan Kingdom!</p><p>This man was one of the three ancestors, named Bai Li Qingkong.</p><p>"We've traveled so far, and still haven't reached the end.  Besides the Heavenpulse Sect, there shouldn't be any other ruins of this scale near the Yan Kingdom, right? I didn't expect them to resurface after lying dormant for so many years."</p><p>The speaker was a young man holding a folding fan. Unlike the others, his expression was relaxed and casual, as if he were simply appreciating the scenery.</p><p>"Third Uncle, with just the four of us, I don't know how long it will take to find the heart of the ruins. Should we send a talisman back to the family?"</p><p>Bai Li Qingkong responded indifferently, "There's no need to alert the Family Head and the Great Elder just yet."</p><p>"Understood!"</p><p>The young man wisely fell silent.</p><p>The other two didn't dare speak, continuing their silent journey through the dark depths.</p><p>Similar scenes played out elsewhere.</p><p>Due to various circumstances, they had all converged upon these ruins at the same time, each group with varying levels of strength, unaware of the presence of so many competitors.</p><p>...</p><p>"The thirteenth stone pool," the young man counted the stone pools they had encountered, piecing together the content of the murals in his mind.</p><p>Each mural was different, and perhaps by compiling all of them, they could uncover hidden secrets.  However, with only the four of them, it was uncertain how long it would take to explore the entire ruins.</p><p>Just as the young man was engrossed in reconstructing the murals, he was startled by a sudden tremor. Looking up, he saw a wave of scorching heat emanating from Bai Li Qingkong, rushing towards him.</p><p>Recognizing this heat wave as his Third Uncle's renowned escape technique, the young man relinquished resistance, allowing the wind to carry him away from the ground.</p><p>'Rumble!'</p><p>'Crack!'</p><p>To everyone's astonishment, cracks began to appear on the walls of the tunnel, spreading rapidly from ahead.</p><p>The tremors intensified, as if the ground was about to collapse.</p><p>In this perilous situation, Bai Li Qingkong's eyes flashed with determination. Instead of retreating, he advanced, enveloped in crimson flames, his speed increasing dramatically!</p><p>...</p><p>Meanwhile, deep underground.</p><p>The Yin family was gathered around a stone pool.</p><p>This stone pool was over ten times larger than the others, marking the end of the cave.  There was no path ahead, and behind the pool stood a massive stone wall.</p><p>The stone wall soared dozens of meters high, covered in even larger and more complex murals.</p><p>Yin Heqian and Nian Hui hovered before the stone wall, one on each side, their hands pressed against its surface as if trying to push open a pair of massive doors.</p><p>The other Yin family members stood behind them, forming a formation and channeling their energy.  Waves of blue light, like surging tides, flowed towards the stone wall, amplifying the two's efforts.</p><p>'Rumble!'</p><p>As the first tremor emanated from behind the stone wall, a crack appeared in the center of the mural.</p><p>But before the Yin family could celebrate, disaster struck.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>A terrifying force erupted from behind the stone wall, causing countless cracks to spread across its surface, sending fragments of stone tumbling down.</p><p>The wall was on the verge of collapse, and the tremors continued to intensify as the cracks widened, the cave rapidly falling apart.</p><p>"This is bad!" one of the Yin family members cried out.</p><p>Yin Heqian's face darkened. The change had occurred too swiftly, leaving no time to react, and there was no way to stop it.</p><p>If the tremors remained confined to the underground area, they might be able to delay discovery for a while.  However, if the entire ruins collapsed, it would immediately attract the attention of other cultivators.</p><p>Soon, every sect and influential family in the Yan Kingdom would come to claim their share!</p><p>"Change..."</p><p>Yin Heqian was about to give an order when he suddenly sensed a powerful aura rapidly approaching amidst the chaos, his heart clenching.</p><p>Clearly, the Yin family wasn't the only one to discover these ruins.</p><p>The situation was even worse than he'd anticipated. They'd attracted their rivals so quickly!</p><p>In his haste, Yin Heqian failed to notice the unusual expression on Nian Hui's face.</p><p>Ripples of emotion flickered in her eyes, a mixture of surprise and confusion. Gradually, as if realizing something, a hint of bitterness flashed within her gaze.</p><p>"Change formation!" Yin Heqian roared.</p><p>The Yin family, though alarmed, remained composed, swiftly altering their formation. They pushed their palms forward, conjuring a barrage of blue water diamonds that shot towards the stone wall.</p><p>Already weakened, the stone wall finally succumbed to the relentless assault, crumbling completely.</p><p>Beyond the dust and debris, an ancient stone hall was revealed.</p><p>The walls of the hall were covered in murals, but it had no floor, resembling a bottomless well leading into the unknown.</p><p>Faint glimmers of light could be seen in its depths, like the radiant glow of treasures.</p><p>Yin Heqian emerged from the rubble. Upon seeing the hall, he lunged forward, about to descend into the depths, but a sudden clap of thunder echoed from behind.</p><p>'Crack!'</p><p>A streak of red light shot towards Yin Heqian's back, accompanied by a hearty laugh.</p><p>"Family Head Yin, it's been a while. Why not stop for a chat? Why are you in such a hurry to leave?"</p><p>A blue light shimmered behind Yin Heqian.</p><p>The two lights collided, instantly becoming entangled.</p><p>Yin Heqian remained unharmed, but the force of the impact sent him staggering.  He steadied himself, suppressing his fury, and roared, "Bai Li Qingkong!"</p><p>...</p><p>Deeper underground.</p><p>In a place unknown to others.</p><p>Within a silent, pitch-black space, a figure sat cross-legged on a cold stone.</p><p>As the tremors reached him, the figure slowly opened his eyes, revealing a sharp, piercing gaze. It was the young man with the surname Shi.</p><p>He looked up, as if able to see the scene above, despite the intervening earth.</p><p>He 'saw' the three members of the Bai Li family, and Bai Li Qingkong.</p><p>"Bai Li!" the young man with the surname Shi uttered the name, his voice laced with bone-chilling hatred.</p><p>The Bai Li clan, the masterminds behind the massacre of the Sha family.</p><p>The Sha family had once been a prominent clan, but only he, a direct descendant, had escaped the slaughter.  He had endured humiliation and hardship, waiting for this day!</p><p>The Bai Li clan's current prosperity, with their three Nascent Soul ancestors, was built upon the corpses of the Sha family, fueled by their blood.</p><p>Besides the Bai Li clan, there were cultivators from other factions drawn to the ruins. These factions had, to varying degrees, also taken advantage of the Sha family's downfall.</p><p>--</p><p>--</p><p>I've been back in my hometown these past few days, completely disoriented, so updates haven't been consistent.  I'll be back to normal soon.</p><p>I haven't paid back the previous chapters yet, but I will. I'll note down another chapter for now.</p><p>(End of Chapter)</p>
