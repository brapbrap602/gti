<h1>Chapter 1474: The Cleansing Pool (4k)</h1><p>Chapter 1474: The Cleansing Pool (4k)</p><p>‘*Snap!*’</p><p>Liuli gently set down the jade cup.</p><p>Qin Sang sensed something and straightened his posture.</p><p>“Daoist Qin… have you heard the legend of the Buddhist Cleansing Pool?”</p><p>Liuli softly posed the question.</p><p>In the North Sea cultivation world, Buddhism is in decline, incomparable to Daoism.</p><p>Qin Sang, having cultivated for hundreds of years, has encountered only a handful of Buddhist cultivators, the most notable being the Jinghai Sect, which has since been destroyed and its lineage severed.</p><p>However, legends about Buddhism abound.</p><p>The Cleansing Pool is said to be one of the Buddha's most precious treasures.</p><p>It is said that even mortals without any cultivation, after a single visit to the Cleansing Pool, can wash away their karmic debts, attain enlightenment, and escape the cycle of reincarnation.</p><p>Daoism has similar legends, speaking of mortals who ascend to immortality by consuming a Nine-Revolution Golden Pill.</p><p>Even among these fantastical legends, the Cleansing Pool and the Nine-Revolution Golden Pill rank among the most unbelievable, more like wishful thinking of ordinary people.</p><p>Cultivators wouldn’t harbor such unrealistic fantasies.</p><p>Qin Sang had heard some of these legends but never paid them much attention.</p><p>He nodded slightly and asked with a smile, “Wouldn't the fairy be telling me that such a divine object truly exists?”</p><p>Even if the Cleansing Pool truly existed, it could only be in the Celestial Realm or the Buddhist Paradise.</p><p>Liuli didn't answer directly but turned to Shi Xue, seeming to seek her permission.</p><p>Shi Xue coughed lightly and said to Qin Sang, “Daoist, you are a guest elder approved by this Palace Master and Jiang Dianzhu.  Revealing this secret to you doesn't violate the rules. However, before that, you must swear a heart demon oath that you will never reveal what we discuss to a fourth person!”</p><p>Qin Sang's expression faltered, somewhat incredulous.</p><p>Could Xuan Tian Palace really possess a Cleansing Pool?</p><p>What struck Qin Sang as even stranger was why Shi Xue and Liuli were telling him this.</p><p>Without hesitation, Qin Sang expertly swore a heart demon oath, promising absolute secrecy.</p><p>Shi Xue nodded to Liuli.</p><p>Liuli then turned to Qin Sang and continued, “Only the four major lineages know the full details of this secret. Within the Xuan Tian Palace's sacred grounds lies a Cleansing Pool, though its effects are not comparable to Buddhist holy objects. Cultivators who enter the Cleansing Pool can improve their speed of spiritual energy absorption during cultivation, essentially enhancing their aptitude.  It even has some effect on Spirit Root cultivators with innate advantages.  It is believed that the lower one's innate spiritual root aptitude, the better the effect.”</p><p>Liuli emphasized the last sentence.</p><p>During their encounter on Shao Hua Mountain, she had thoroughly investigated Qin Sang, knowing he possessed five innate spiritual roots, the worst aptitude among cultivators, making success in cultivation highly improbable; this is why he even sold himself to build his foundation.</p><p>Yet, she wondered what opportunities he had encountered later, that with only a fragmented cultivation technique that fragments the soul, he had reached this level.</p><p>This was Liuli's biggest question since re-encountering Qin Sang.</p><p>Shi Xue leaned back in her chair, sipping tea, waiting to see Qin Sang's reaction.</p><p>Liuli hadn't revealed Qin Sang's information to her.</p><p>Shi Xue guessed that Qin Sang's aptitude was probably also a five-spiritual root, or at least dual-spiritual root.</p><p>However, no matter how good one's aptitude, the temptation of the Cleansing Pool was irresistible; it was a great opportunity that benefited one for life.</p><p>Improving cultivation speed, even saving just a year of hard cultivation, meant a greater chance of breaking through bottlenecks and reaching higher realms.</p><p>Except for her junior sister's stubborn nature, Shi Xue couldn't imagine anyone refusing such a temptation.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>As Shi Xue expected, even Qin Sang, with his exceptional composure, was extremely surprised and disbelieving upon hearing Liuli's words.</p><p>After hundreds of years of cultivation, Qin Sang had repeatedly realized the harshness of the cultivation world.</p><p>Insufficient aptitude meant obstacles at every turn, requiring him to constantly find ways to compensate.</p><p>Methods to improve aptitude were extremely rare; Qin Sang only knew of the *Soul-Cultivating Sword Scripture*, which was the reason for his current achievements.</p><p>Even if the Cleansing Pool only improved the speed of spiritual energy absorption, not the aptitude itself, it was still something every cultivator longed for.</p><p>Xuan Tian Palace's exclusive possession of the Cleansing Pool explained its enduring prosperity and the constant emergence of great cultivators.</p><p>With his natal sword inscribed with killing talismans, Qin Sang's cultivation speed already surpassed that of dual-spiritual root cultivators. If he could gain access to the Cleansing Pool, he might even surpass Liuli in the future.</p><p>However, Qin Sang wasn't swayed by this.</p><p>He never believed in unearned good fortune, quickly dismissing the fantasy. His gaze swept across Shi Xue and Liuli's faces before he mused, "Why would you two reveal this secret to me? Xuan Tian Palace wouldn't offer a casual guest elder a chance to enter the Cleansing Pool, would they?"</p><p>Shi Xue was surprised by Qin Sang's swift return to composure, a flicker of astonishment in her eyes. She explained to Liuli.</p><p>"The Cleansing Pool is only accessible when the sacred site opens.  The area around the pool is sealed by powerful restrictions, the timing of which is unknown. Only one person can enter the pool at a time, sometimes requiring competition. If the time limit passes with no one entering, the pool closes itself.  Furthermore, to avoid wasting opportunities on the unworthy, there's an ironclad rule…"</p><p>Here, Shi Xue wore a frustrated expression, saying dejectedly, "Only Yuan Ying stage cultivators who break through to the mid-Yuan Ying stage within three hundred years of their first tribulation – that is, within three hundred years of forming their Golden Core – are eligible."</p><p>This restriction eliminated most Xuan Tian Palace cultivators.</p><p>Including Shi Xue herself.</p><p>She had already survived her first tribulation, yet remained stuck at the early Yuan Ying stage, a 'commoner.'</p><p>Shi Xue's frantic concern for Liuli and her efforts to obtain the *Divine Maiden Scripture* from the Luo family were directly related to the Cleansing Pool.</p><p>Liuli was exceptionally gifted. If not for her emotional distress, she would certainly have broken through to the mid-Yuan Ying stage before her first tribulation, securing entry into the Cleansing Pool with her powerful Ice Soul Divine Light.</p><p>This would have allowed Liuli to potentially succeed the Grand Elder and revitalize the Listening Snow Pavilion.</p><p>The Cleansing Pool was likely left behind by a Xuan Tian Palace ancestor to ensure the sect's prosperity. However, after numerous internal conflicts and the loss of records, its origins are unknown.</p><p>Throughout Xuan Tian Palace's history, most Grand Elders and Palace Masters have come from the Cleansing Pool.</p><p>While their innate talent played a role, the pool's benefits were undeniable, adding polish to an already brilliant gem.</p><p>Upon hearing this, Qin Sang instinctively looked at Liuli, instantly understanding much.</p><p>He realized Liuli's first tribulation was approaching, explaining Shi Xue's anxiety.</p><p>Her last attempt to break through had failed.</p><p>However, if they both cultivated the *Divine Maiden Scripture*, Liuli could use dual cultivation to resolve the demonic energy imprint and potentially break through.</p><p>Yet, Liuli showed no hesitation, preferring to forgo a great opportunity rather than submit to the demonic energy.</p><p>Qin Sang observed closely, finding no regret on Liuli's face.</p><p>One could only say she was spoiled by talent.</p><p>"This condition is indeed harsh. Even your four main branches can't guarantee a cultivator reaching the mid-Yuan Ying stage before their first tribulation, can you?"</p><p>Qin Sang shifted his gaze from Liuli back to Shi Xue.</p><p>The current state of the Listening Snow Pavilion served as an example – even main branches decline.</p><p>"Correct."</p><p>Shi Xue admitted readily.</p><p>"Once a sufficiently talented disciple emerges, all four branches will nurture them with all their might. Even so, success in securing the Cleansing Pool isn't guaranteed. However, the pool opens roughly every three hundred years. Besides those who have already entered, those who missed out can try again before their second tribulation.</p><p>"Furthermore, we've tried various methods.</p><p>"For instance, absorbing exceptionally gifted disciples from the lesser branches or merging the branches altogether – though it's troublesome. Some use unorthodox methods, even disreputable demonic arts, to forcibly increase cultivation, even if temporarily.</p><p>"Even if it leaves lingering problems, the chance to enter the Cleansing Pool is worth it."</p><p>Shi Xue subconsciously glanced at Liuli.</p><p>She had sought the *Divine Maiden Scripture* for Liuli with this in mind.</p><p>Liuli, however, refused.</p><p>As Qin Sang listened, his thoughts raced.</p><p>Shi Xue and Liuli wouldn't have revealed these secrets without reason.</p><p>He met the requirements, and Qin Sang was confident that, barring intervention from Tong Lingyu or the Palace Master, securing the Cleansing Pool would be his.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression shifted, his eyes glittering.  He subtly guessed their intentions, looked deeply at Liuli, and said pointedly, "Unfortunately, I am neither from a main branch nor a lesser branch, but an outsider."</p><p>A guest elder is called a guest elder for a reason.</p><p>They bear no responsibility for the sect's lineage.</p><p>Correspondingly, they are not privy to the sect's true secrets.</p><p>Xuantian Palace wouldn't give such an opportunity to an outsider, would they?</p><p>Shi Xue opened her mouth to explain, but before she could, the silent Liuli spoke.  "When the Four Sects reconciled, a decision was made. Outsiders sincerely joining Xuantian Palace will be treated equally, but they must have a convincing reason, a deep enough connection, to guarantee they won't betray us."</p><p>She paused slightly, then said gravely, "For example, marriage!"</p><p>Before Qin Sang could respond, Shi Xue interjected, adding, "Xuantian Palace controls a vast territory and has never lacked geniuses. This is uncommon, but not unprecedented. However, these cultivators, like those who have participated in the competition multiple times, will be restricted. Xuantian Palace cultivators face a lower difficulty level in the initial restriction test. But these outsiders must pass the complete test; only those exceptionally strong have a chance, like Daoist Qin."</p><p>While speaking, Shi Xue kept looking at Qin Sang, her tone light. She had personally witnessed Qin Sang's abilities and knew better than anyone how powerful he was.  If he was willing, success was assured.</p><p>"I'm somewhat confused.  You two are suggesting a marriage alliance between myself and a cultivator from the Listening Snow Pavilion?" Qin Sang frowned.</p><p>"With me."</p><p>To his surprise, Liuli stepped forward. "No one else is involved."</p><p>Shi Xue looked helpless. "In the Listening Snow Pavilion, there are only my junior sister and I, plus another senior sister. Their status and cultivation are sufficient to persuade the Palace Master and the other three sects… My junior sister doesn't want to involve us."</p><p>Suddenly, Shi Xue stood up. "I remember, I almost forgot something important. Junior Sister, you stay and discuss this with the Daoist."</p><p>Qin Sang watched Shi Xue's hurried departure, and chuckled wryly.</p><p>After she was gone, he sighed. "I am indeed interested in the Cleansing Pool. However, merely pretending might not fool the Palace Master and the elders."</p><p>This was clearly different from the previous arrangement. That was a simple transaction; a clean break afterwards. If not for the many unforeseen events, they would have already parted ways.</p><p>This time, forming a true partnership with Liuli would create many ties.</p><p>If it was mutual, it would be fine. But while he and Liuli had known each other for centuries, sharing a complicated past, there was no genuine affection. Liuli was trapped by the evil technique’s imprint; her feelings for him were false.</p><p>Liuli's gaze softened slightly. She bit her lip, her voice still cold. "We have both cultivated the *Xuanyin Jade Tripod Scripture*."</p><p>Qin Sang understood.</p><p>The imprint remained, creating a connection between them that others lacked.</p><p>If they could use this to deceive everyone, it would be simple.</p><p>"I don't accept favors without giving something in return.  You must have other requests, wouldn't you? What must I do to earn this opportunity?"</p><p>Liuli wasn't surprised by his words.</p><p>It would have been strange if Qin Sang hadn't guessed.</p><p>"After you enter the Cleansing Pool, retrieve an item from the bottom for me."</p><p>"A treasure from the Cleansing Pool?"</p><p>Qin Sang immediately recognized the danger. He asked solemnly, "Retrieving this object… would it cause the Cleansing Pool to change, or alert the Palace Master and the Grand Elder?"</p><p>A treasure from such a sacred place wouldn't be ordinary. If Xuantian Palace discovered it, a deadly conflict would be inevitable.</p><p>Liuli carefully explained, "Master accidentally discovered this when he entered the Cleansing Pool; others should not know. He tried to retrieve it, but lacked the strength; the restrictions at the bottom are extremely dangerous. However, he got close and attempted to move it, and the Cleansing Pool didn't react. Unless one is extremely powerful, only the Ice Soul Divine Light can retrieve it. This is part of the reason I cultivated it. Your strength far surpasses cultivators of your level; you have a good chance. I will condense a Ice Soul Divine Light talisman, but its power will be weakened, and may not be effective."</p><p>A complex look flickered in Liuli's eyes.</p><p>Cultivating the Ice Soul Divine Light served multiple purposes. Even with a treasure slightly inferior to the Yin Li Pearl, she had over a 50% chance of breaking through to the mid-Yuan Ying stage.</p><p>But all her plans were disrupted upon reuniting with Qin Sang. The evil technique’s influence was more terrible than she imagined. Facing Qin Sang directly, the imprint was impacted, the Ice Soul's suppression of emotion failed, directly leading to her failed breakthrough.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered. Liuli's clear request put him at ease; he could improvise later. Taking some risks for the Cleansing Pool was worthwhile.</p><p>Understanding this, Qin Sang inquired about the Cleansing Pool's restrictions.</p><p>Liuli handed him a jade slip. "It's all in there."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, accepting the jade slip, agreeing to the matter.</p><p>"What else needs to be done?"</p><p>"Hold a wedding ceremony."</p><p>Liuli paused. "A fake one."</p>
