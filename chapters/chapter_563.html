<h1>Chapter 556: The Time Has Come</h1><p>“This…”</p><p>Qin Sang pondered.</p><p>He hadn’t expected the Wan Shi Chang to be so rare.  Obtaining one through simple trade would be extremely difficult.</p><p>The Eight Swords Elder was right; the jade slip offered another path.</p><p>Qin Sang was tempted, but his tone remained reluctant, a wry smile playing on his lips.  “Senior, you have quite the skill. I’m almost persuaded. However, you only offer a piece of Tian Du Rock and a jade slip in exchange. Even if the jade slip’s contents are true, I’ll still need to search far and wide, with no guarantee of success…  Senior needs to add something else.”</p><p>“How about an additional Yin Soul Grass?”</p><p>The Eight Swords Elder produced a jade slip and a jade box. The box indeed contained a complete Yin Soul Grass.</p><p>Qin Sang was startled, a wry smile spreading across his face.  “Senior has seen through me.”</p><p>The Eight Swords Elder stroked his beard.  “Daoist, you don’t know.  I’ve spent countless years and effort searching for a certain Zi Wei Secret Manual. Gathering the items you require represents my absolute limit.”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, lost in thought.</p><p>It was rare to find someone who possessed everything he needed. This was an opportunity not to be missed.</p><p>Judging by the Elder's tone, this was his final offer.  Further haggling could lead to greater losses.</p><p>With this in mind, Qin Sang pushed the Zi Wei Secret Manual forward. “Good! I’ll exchange it for these three items!”</p><p>The exchange was completed to everyone's satisfaction.</p><p>Qin Sang collected his items and hurried back to his residence.</p><p>The Tian Du Rock wasn't large, but it was more than enough to refine the Hun Yuan Tong Xin Ring.</p><p>Qin Sang carefully stored the Tian Du Rock and the Yin Soul Grass, then delved into the jade slip.</p><p>After a while, Qin Sang withdrew his spiritual sense, muttering that the exchange was worthwhile.</p><p>The Eight Swords Elder likely feared suspicion, providing an original, complete jade slip.</p><p>The jade slip contained not only information about the Wan Shi Chang, but also details on dozens of rare spiritual materials, including their growth environments and properties.  For Qin Sang, who intended to continue his study of refining, this jade slip was a treasure in itself.</p><p>The jade slip stated that the Wan Shi Chang's symbiotic beast was a creature called Que Huo Que.</p><p>The Que Huo Que resembles a swallow, with feathers as bright and clear as ice.  Its abilities are unique; it expertly manipulates ice, its wings creating chilling winds that can erode the soul and bone. Ordinary flames are ineffective; contact results in instant annihilation.  However, flames surpassing its abilities would become its nemesis.</p><p>The Wan Shi Chang's fundamental nature is a type of cold jade.  The Que Huo Que greatly enjoys the cold air emanating from the Wan Shi Chang and can sense it from a great distance.  Through prolonged absorption, the cold air gradually transforms the Que Huo Que, drastically increasing its power.</p><p>Legend speaks of the phoenix, which only nests in the phoenix tree, eats only bamboo shoots, and drinks only from the sweet spring.</p><p>The relationship between the Que Huo Que and the Wan Shi Chang is similar in nature.</p><p>Upon learning that the Wan Shi Chang's symbiotic beast was the Que Huo Que, Qin Sang exclaimed he'd been tricked.</p><p>The Wan Shi Chang was rare, but the Que Huo Que was no less so; Qin Sang had never heard of it before. Only after hearing from the Eight Swords Elder that Que Huo Que had once appeared in the inner valley of Wu Ya Valley did Qin Sang relent.</p><p>Qin Sang worried again.</p><p>He had been to the inner valley of Wu Ya Valley with Yun Youzi and knew how dangerous it was.</p><p>Furthermore, a mature Wan Shi Chang would easily attract Que Huo Que at the Core Formation stage, and the Nine Nether Magic Fire in his Ten Directions Yan Luo Banner might not be able to subdue them.</p><p>Fortunately, he didn't lack magical treasures, and wasn't concerned about lacking them after Core Formation; refining the Hun Yuan Tong Xin Ring wasn't urgent.</p><p>Afterward, Qin Sang ceased his travels, remaining at his residence to study the art of refining, using the jade slip and Wu Family's refining notes.</p><p>…</p><p>“Qin Junior Brother!”</p><p>‘Bang! Bang!’</p><p>A knock sounded on his room door.</p><p>Qin Sang sensed Qiu Mu Bai outside, a gleam flashing in his eyes.</p><p>Zi Wei Palace was finally about to open!</p><p>A month prior, Fei Tian Ye Cha's injuries had completely healed, his strength restored.</p><p>Opening the door, Ji Qing and the others had also emerged from seclusion.  Exchanging nods, they headed towards the depths of the residence.</p><p>Arriving before the cave dwelling, they did not find Che Yu Tao. A gaunt, elderly man in grey-white robes emerged.</p><p>It was Master Feng Ming!</p><p>Qin Sang remembered his first invitation to assist in a fight after establishing his foundation.  Feng Ming's disciple, Li, had died in the Corpse Cave, leading to Yu Dai Yue, as the organizer, incurring Feng Ming's wrath and narrowly escaping expulsion, triggering the subsequent tragedy.</p><p>The disciples bowed before Master Fengming.</p><p>Qin Sang, unwilling to suffer unwarranted calamity, bowed with the others.  Relieved that Master Fengming seemed to ignore her, she relaxed.</p><p>"Follow me."</p><p>Master Fengming said calmly, then, with a flash of light, he soared towards the Sushen Pass gate.</p><p>Qin Sang and the others quickly followed.</p><p>Along the way, Qin Sang approached Ji Qing, curiously asking, "Brother Ji, why isn't Master Che going to the Ziwei Palace?"</p><p>Ji Qing replied, "Master is staying behind to guard Sushen Pass."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded.  For a cultivator like Che Yutao, with such a clear and bright path, there was indeed no need to take risks.</p><p>She wondered how many other masters were going with Master Fengming, and if Qi Yuanshou was among them.</p><p>Master Fengming's speed was incredible.  Qin Sang and the others strained to keep up, finally arriving at Sushen Pass.</p><p>The gate, closed for half a year, stood wide open.  A hemispherical energy barrier bulged outwards beyond the gate, and they could see a dozen figures standing beyond it.  A Nascent Soul cultivator from the Taiyi Danzong stood before the gate.</p><p>Suddenly, a streak of sword light flashed from the east, arriving at the gate before them—it was Old Eight Swords.</p><p>The sword light retracted, revealing eight small flying swords, neatly circling his dantian. They formed a lotus blossom shape, then swiftly coalesced and vanished back into Old Eight Swords' body—a very impressive display.</p><p>"Eh?  Daoist Eight Swords, what brings you here?" The Golden Core cultivator guarding the gate recognized him.</p><p>Old Eight Swords produced a Ziwei Pass permit, bowing. "Daoist Liu, I've come for the Ziwei Palace, and it seems I haven't made the journey in vain."</p><p>After checking the permit, the Golden Core cultivator, Liu, allowed Old Eight Swords to pass.</p><p>Master Fengming arrived, and as Qin Sang and the others caught up, they started to head towards the pass.  But the Golden Core cultivator Liu stopped them.</p><p>"Wait."</p><p>Liu, seemingly at odds with Fengming, sneered, "What is the meaning of this, Brother Fengming? With the spiritual tide at its peak, you send your disciples to their deaths? Is it not a matter that can wait?"</p><p>Fengming snorted. "Don't spout nonsense! They are all going to the Ziwei Palace."</p><p>"So many Foundation Establishment disciples going to the Ziwei Palace?  Aren't you afraid of losing everything?"</p><p>The cultivator Liu was astonished, scrutinizing Qin Sang and the others, still hesitant to let them pass.  "Show me your Ziwei Palace permits."</p><p>At that moment, a calm voice came from beyond the gate.</p><p>"They do not need permits. I will protect them."</p>
