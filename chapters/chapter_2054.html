<h1>Chapter 2045:  A Heavenly Treasure of the Second Order</h1><p>Qin Sang entered the great hall, and several gazes immediately fell upon him. He glanced around; five people were seated within.</p><p>The main seat was empty. To the left sat a short, elderly man, his feet dangling, his soles unusually large. Beside him rested a purple wooden dragon-head cane, the dragon exquisitely carved, the cane nearly twice his height.</p><p>Seated beside the elder were two women, a matron and a young girl, strikingly similar in appearance, likely related—perhaps mother and daughter.</p><p>To the right of the main seat sat a man in black robes, his eyes closed as if in meditation. He only opened them to glance at Qin Sang upon his entrance, then immediately returned to his stillness.</p><p>The last person was quite extraordinary.  He was two-headed, with two heads sprouting from his shoulders, almost identical features aside from one head's long hair styled in a high bun, dressed in women's attire, and the other sporting a short beard, presenting a starkly different demeanor.</p><p>This peculiar individual was quite eye-catching, prompting Qin Sang to take a second look. Rumors spoke of the Unusual People clan with their various unique appearances, some lacking any monstrous traits and closely resembling human birth defects, such as being tiny as mice, having unusually long limbs, or ears extending beyond their shoulders, and so on.</p><p>Yet, this person didn't seem like an Unusual Person.</p><p>“Hehe…”</p><p>Upon meeting Qin Sang's gaze, the male head of the strange individual chuckled, “Regardless of your cultivation, friend, seeing us siblings is always a surprise.”</p><p>The female head merely gave Qin Sang a cold look, their personalities clearly different.</p><p>Master Luo Hua introduced them, “These are Daoists Chi Yuan and Bi Yuan, invited by our sect to assist.  They were conjoined twins in the womb, sharing one body.”</p><p>Qin Sang was inwardly astonished. He knew of many cultivation techniques created specifically for twins, who were said to have shared minds, supporting each other on their paths for twice the results with half the effort.</p><p>This was the first time he'd seen conjoined cultivators at the Refinement Void stage.</p><p>Even more peculiar, the strange individual called them siblings, yet Qin Sang sensed only one aura. Were the two consciousnesses, in fact, one?</p><p>This involved their private matters, so Qin Sang didn't pry, bowing, “Greetings to both Daoists.”</p><p>“This is Daoist Yu…”</p><p>Master Luo Hua then pointed to the man in black robes, introducing all five individuals starting with the strange person.</p><p>The two women were indeed mother and daughter. The matron was known as Madam Shuanghua, invited to this gathering, bringing her daughter to broaden her horizons.</p><p>The elder's Daoist name was True Person Tonghu, a venerable Daoist master.</p><p>Finally, Master Luo Hua introduced Qin Sang. Learning that Qin Sang was an elder of the Five Elements League, even the aloof Daoist Yu rose and bowed.</p><p>After the introductions, Qin Sang disregarded seniority and sat beside the strange individual.  After a brief exchange, he learned that the four present were all master artificers.  Daoist Yu and True Person Tonghu were also guest elders of the Five Elements League, while the strange person and Madam Shuanghua had different backgrounds.</p><p>“Master, now that Elder Qin has arrived, are there any other Daoists expected?  Might you inform us of the task at hand?” True Person Tonghu asked, swinging his large feet.</p><p>Master Luo Hua sat on the main seat, “True Person Tonghu seems impatient.”</p><p>“Not just Tonghu,” Madam Shuanghua said calmly, “We’ve been staying at your sect for days with nothing to do. It’s unsettling.”</p><p>The male head of the strange person chuckled again, “What trouble Master has encountered, we’ll find out sooner or later.  Since we're here, we’re not afraid of danger. Why such secrecy? It only makes everyone more anxious.”</p><p>Hearing this, Master Luo Hua smiled slightly, “You've likely all heard some distorted rumors, thinking I'd lead you into danger.  In fact, this was a deliberate misdirection.”</p><p>Everyone was taken aback.</p><p>Qin Sang, however, thought to himself, *This commission definitely has a hidden agenda.  Probably the other elders didn't want to handle it, and the League is taking advantage of my recent arrival.  They don't need to deceive me entirely, just hide key information, and gloss over the important details.  As long as I'm tempted by the treasure, it'll be hard to verify things in the short term.*</p><p>*And I can't blame the League. Even if I was tricked, I still have the option to refuse; at worst, it's just a wasted trip. If I accept, I can't blame others for any crisis later.*</p><p>Except for Madam Shuanghua's daughter, everyone in the hall was a Refinement Void cultivator, composed and experienced.  Their surprise didn't show as True Person Tonghu asked seriously, “Master, what is the meaning of this?”</p><p>“Firstly, to conceal our sect’s true objective. Secondly, to weed out those with powerful backgrounds,” Master Luo Hua said.</p><p>The others fell into thought, looking at each other, vaguely understanding Master Luo Hua's meaning.</p><p>A commission with such substantial rewards but unclear danger wouldn’t attract those with strong lineages or backgrounds.  They wouldn’t lack cultivation resources, so why risk it?</p><p>Qin Sang, recently joining the Five Elements Alliance, acted much like a solitary cultivator.  Even Qi Zhanglao, who had recruited him, suspected he was an ascended cultivator from the lower realms.  From what others had said, none of them seemed to be from major sects.</p><p>Lacking a strong background, having cultivated their abilities alone, they were more easily swayed by opportunities, and more easily manipulated.</p><p>Selecting these five individuals, it appeared that Luo Hua Guan had put considerable thought into the process.</p><p>"Master, please stop the riddles and tell us plainly what you require of us,"  Tong Hu Zhenren said with a wry smile.</p><p>Luo Hua Zhenren's expression darkened. He looked around at everyone.  "You all still have the chance to refuse. Once I reveal everything, before the matter is concluded, you cannot leave the sect, otherwise, don't blame me for turning against you. I swear on this, you will face no danger!"</p><p>The group exchanged glances, but no one left.  Shuanghua Zhenren sent a message to her daughter to leave, and the girl, unable to defy her mother, reluctantly departed from Xuan Shui Hall.</p><p>Various thoughts flashed through Qin Sang's mind, but he didn't retreat.</p><p>Luo Hua Zhenren smiled contentedly. "This matter is also an opportunity for you all. You are all masters of artifact refinement. You must all know of innate spiritual treasures. Has anyone personally refined one?"</p><p>At his words, the expressions of the group changed. They sensed what was coming, and even the usually cold and aloof female leader showed a heightened breath.</p><p>Tong Hu Zhenren's eyes gleamed. "Master, don't jest. Innate spiritual treasures are not something anyone can refine! I consider myself proficient in the art of refinement, but I wouldn't dare entertain such a thought."</p><p>"Indeed!"</p><p>The cultivator with the surname Yu nodded. "Innate spiritual treasures nurture spiritual entities.  This is a matter of incredible fortune, as difficult as ascending to heaven. I have no master to guide me, and even with the cultivation of my fellow Daoists here, I wouldn't dare hope for such a thing."</p><p>Shuanghua Madam and the female leader remained silent, their expressions reflecting the same sentiment.</p><p>Qin Sang's thoughts were far more complex. It seemed that in this vast world, innate spiritual treasures were indeed extremely rare.  No wonder he hadn't seen a single one despite encountering so many Nascent Soul cultivators.</p><p>However, he possessed two items with the potential to become innate spiritual treasures: Xiao Wu and the Yunyou Sword.  But these two treasures possessed great fortune, having been touched by Ziwei Tongzi.</p><p>For ordinary refiners, creating an innate spiritual treasure was indeed as difficult as ascending to heaven.</p><p>He wondered if it would become easier at the Unity Realm.</p><p>Luo Hua Zhenren's words implied that Luo Hua Guan wished to commission them to refine an innate spiritual treasure.  Qin Sang couldn't miss such an opportunity; even learning a little would be extremely beneficial to Xiao Wu's future transformation!</p><p>"As you all have surmised, I wish to refine an innate spiritual treasure, and I ask for your full assistance!"</p><p>Luo Hua Zhenren stood up and bowed deeply.</p><p>Everyone's expressions became excited; a surge of emotion crossed Tong Hu Zhenren's face. "How, Master, would you have us assist? Does your sect possess superior techniques for refinement that you are willing to share with us? If so, I will gladly forgo any reward!"</p><p>This question echoed the thoughts of everyone present.</p><p>Luo Hua Zhenren nodded.  "There is indeed a secret technique. I'm not sure of its origin, but its cultivation demands are extremely high. Even with my cultivation, I can only barely master it."</p><p>Hearing this, everyone's hearts sank, cooling from their previous excitement.</p><p>The female leader coldly demanded, "If you cannot cultivate it, how will we help you?"</p><p>Her male counterpart added, "Unless the Master only wants us to act as assistants."</p><p>"Since I have invited you all here, it is naturally for a crucial purpose, requiring your help to the very end. Otherwise, why would I be so cautious? Though you cannot cultivate the secret technique, I have a solution.  Our sect possesses a treasured talisman called the Barrier-Free Seal. I will cast this talisman on each of you, allowing you to use the technique through you, even though you do not fully understand it."</p><p>At Luo Hua Zhenren's words, an uproar erupted.</p><p>The female leader immediately shouted, "Absurd! With the talisman on our bodies, our minds will be under your control! Will we not be at your mercy?!"</p><p>The others were also furious, on the verge of storming out.</p><p>Qin Sang, however, remained the calmest. With the jade Buddha protecting him, he feared such talismans the least.</p><p>"Please calm yourselves and let me explain fully," Luo Hua Zhenren soothed them, before detailing Luo Hua Guan's plan.</p><p>When Luo Hua Zhenren finished, the anger subsided, and everyone fell into deep thought.  The hall was silent.  Luo Hua Zhenren didn't urge them, patiently awaiting their response.</p><p>It turned out that the innate spiritual treasure Luo Hua Guan wished to refine required, due to certain circumstances, the assistance of six master refiners.  Luo Hua Guan could provide one more true cultivator; the remaining five had to be sought from outside.</p><p>During the refinement, the six would assist in the refining process, and through the Barrier-Free Seal, they would cooperate with Luo Hua Zhenren in using the secret technique.</p><p>Luo Hua Zhenren couldn’t control their minds, but would use their hands to perform the secret technique. When Luo Hua Zhenren's intent was transmitted, they would only need to follow the instructions, guided by an unseen force.</p><p>It’s no wonder that Master Luo Hua didn't choose people with powerful backgrounds.  Such a refining process wouldn't allow their participation. Each person only handles a part, receiving an incomplete secret technique while risking being controlled.</p><p>For them, the knowledge gained is certainly invaluable, a rare opportunity; but it's different for those from large sects.  You must understand, during the refining, Master Luo Hua needs their willing cooperation. If someone harbors ill intentions or actively resists, while it won't destroy the treasure, it will significantly hinder the process.</p><p>Master Luo Hua's expression shifted slightly, sensing the silent communication among the attendees, but he didn't stop them, calmly observing everyone.</p><p>Qin Sang also joined the discussion.  Several people exchanged words, identifying all potential risks.</p><p>After a short while, Master Tong Hu spoke, "Master, could you please show us the charm?"</p><p>"Certainly. Once you see the Wu Zhang Seal, you will know it has no mind-control function!"</p><p>Master Luo Hua readily agreed, immediately sending a message to fetch it, adding, "With your cultivation, should the charm affect you in any way, your spiritual senses would undoubtedly detect it.  During the refinement, should I harbor any ill intent, you may all counterattack together."</p><p>Master Luo Hua's words were earnest, yet the others remained noncommittal, deciding to make a judgment only after seeing the charm.</p><p>Qin Sang looked at the others: Madam Shuanghua was at the mid-stage of the Transcending Void realm, while the others were at the early stage. United, they were a formidable force. If they fought back, even if Master Luo Hua personally intervened, Luo Hua Temple would pay a heavy price.</p><p>Next, including Qin Sang, everyone asked their questions, and Master Luo Hua answered each one.</p><p>Shortly after, a powerful aura approached from outside the hall. A Daoist priest entered, carrying a jade box.</p><p>"This is Disciple Quan. He will assist us," Master Luo Hua introduced Quan, opening the box to reveal a soft, clear light. A transparent charm slowly rose.</p><p>The charm was a foot long and three inches wide, with mystical inscriptions that seemed carved onto jade, hovering before everyone.</p><p>To gain their trust, Master Luo Hua even revealed part of the activation method.  After careful examination, everyone fell silent again.</p><p>After a long pause, Madam Shuanghua suddenly spoke, "Yanling City has a subterranean fire furnace. Could we refine the treasure there?"</p><p>Everyone's expressions changed, all looking towards Master Luo Hua.</p><p>Master Luo Hua frowned, pondering for a moment, "Very well. If we fail, so be it.  Once the spirit is formed and enters the tribulation, others won't be able to stop it. As the Madam wishes! But we need to transfer various preparations from the temple, which will take some time."</p><p>Qin Sang and the others relaxed, saying it was fine.</p><p>Thus, the refining was scheduled for three months later.</p><p>During those three months, Qin Sang and the others could not leave Luo Hua Temple, always accompanied.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't mind, allowing Master Yu Hong to guide her around Luo Hua Temple, visiting the Ju Fu clan several times.</p><p>...</p><p>Three months later.</p><p>Yanling City.</p><p>Luo Hua Temple had made all the necessary preparations. Qin Sang and the others secretly gathered in a fire chamber.</p><p>Master Luo Hua had further modified the chamber, constructing a high platform with a bronze beast-eared furnace.</p><p>Qin Sang sat south of the furnace, others taking their positions.  Various spirit materials floated before each person, needed for the refining.</p><p>Master Luo Hua was at the center, levitating above the furnace.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The platform's restrictive glow flickered, the spirit fire intensified, and the furnace emitted raging flames, filling the chamber with intense heat.</p><p>Everyone, being at the Transcending Void realm, remained unaffected, all looking at Master Luo Hua.</p><p>Master Luo Hua flicked his sleeve, a ball of light entering the furnace. The spirit fire subsided briefly, then erupted again.</p><p>Everyone vaguely saw something about a foot long within the light.</p><p>Before anyone could ponder further, Master Luo Hua brought out the Wu Zhang Seal, made a hand gesture, and said solemnly, "Fellow Daoists, please restrain your essence!"</p>
