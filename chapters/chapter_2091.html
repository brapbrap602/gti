<h1>Chapter 2082: Inside and Outside the Sect Gates</h1><p>Spring was warm and the sun shone brightly.</p><p>The new mountain gate of the Green Ram Sect, like the earth in early spring, was a scene of vibrant life and flourishing growth.  Previously, this place had been a desolate and dangerous terrain of jagged rocks, chaotic riverbeds, and overgrown weeds and trees. Despite the rich spiritual energy, it was filled with an untamed, wild aura.</p><p>Now, after meticulous modifications by the Green Ram Sect, the spiritual energy was even more potent than before.  Jade-green mountains and azure rivers, interspersed with wondrous peaks, vast marshes, and blessed lands, were now complemented by magnificent palaces and pavilions shrouded in immortal mist, creating an ethereal landscape.  Immortal trees and spirit flowers were planted along the mountains and waters, and spirit beasts leaped and soared through the air, giving the place the aura of a blessed immortal land.</p><p>The sky was clear, and white clouds drifted leisurely.</p><p>A white cloud rose from the great marsh in the east and flew westward at a steady pace, navigating the sea of clouds.</p><p>A Green Ram Sect deacon stood on the white cloud, followed by a dozen young boys and girls.  All of them were captivated by the magnificent mountains and rivers below, their faces filled with awe and pride as they pointed at the ground, their exclamations unceasing.</p><p>These were the younger disciples of the Green Ram Sect. Some came from the ancestral grounds of the Small Cold Domain, some from Green Ram Island, and others had cultivated in Deer Wild or other branch sects since childhood.  None of those places could compare to the mountain gate currently under construction.</p><p>They had been sent here over the years, and upon arrival, they were arranged in one location. Due to the heavy workload of building the mountain gate and the need to also focus on their cultivation, their teachers frequently checked their progress. They had almost no free time and this was the first time they had accompanied the deacon to view the entire mountain gate.</p><p>They couldn't help but imagine their future cultivation in this place, possessing their own cave dwelling, a truly blissful prospect!</p><p>At this moment, they saw a streak of azure light flying towards them, which the deacon caught in his hand.</p><p>The deacon smiled and turned back, saying, "Brother Bai has arrived. Among the spirit beasts he brought this time, several have exceptional bloodlines and aptitudes. You must seize this opportunity."</p><p>They all responded in unison, their expressions filled with anticipation.</p><p>When the mountain gate opened, the Green Ram Sect would record the contributions of its disciples and grant various rewards to motivate them.</p><p>These disciples had been given the opportunity to choose their spirit beasts first.</p><p>King Feather had moved to the Demon Realm, taking his subordinates and his clan with him, gradually relinquishing control over the Thousand Demon Hills.  The Thousand Mountains Bamboo Sea became the de facto leader of the demon clans in the North Star Realm. Even after Mistfall slaughtered most of the Thousand Mountains Bamboo Sea's experts, King Feather showed no intention of intervening.</p><p>The relationship between the Thousand Mountains Bamboo Sea and the Green Ram Sect remained close. Li Yufu and Yu Nu, to deepen the bond between the two factions, encouraged the disciples of the Green Ram Sect and the demon beasts of the Thousand Mountains Bamboo Sea to support each other.</p><p>Of course, this selection was two-way. Cultivators could choose spirit beasts, and spirit beasts could also choose cultivators.</p><p>Unlike the Spirit Taming Sect, the Green Ram Sect's inheritance did not rely on spirit beasts to aid cultivation, so they did not force the two sides to form spirit contracts; it was entirely voluntary.</p><p>If a cultivator could have a powerful spirit beast companion, it would greatly benefit their cultivation, and vice versa.</p><p>However, spirit beasts with exceptional talent were extremely rare. Whether or not one could gain the recognition of such a spirit beast depended entirely on fate. Their opportunity to choose first undoubtedly gave them an advantage.</p><p>Within the sect, they could not subdue spirit beasts by force as they could in the outside world. They began to rack their brains, thinking about how to present themselves to gain the recognition of the spirit beasts.</p><p>The new mountain gate was far larger than Deer Wild.  They pondered for a long time, and realized they had not yet reached their destination, having already lost count of how many mountain ranges and lakes had passed beneath their feet.</p><p>Finally, the white cloud stopped mid-air and suddenly descended rapidly.  They felt their feet sink as they landed on a wide mountaintop.</p><p>The mountaintop was a scene of bustling activity, with hawks, falcons, foxes, leopards, flower and wood spirits, and all manner of creatures. There were dozens of spirit beasts, neatly arranged in formation behind an old man.</p><p>The old man was tall and thin, with rough skin like tree bark and a stern expression, resembling an old scholar.</p><p>"Brother Bai!" the deacon stepped forward and bowed.</p><p>The old man meticulously returned the greeting, "Greetings, Fellow Daoist Tan Yi."</p><p>After exchanging greetings, Tan Yi looked at the group of demons behind the old man. "Brother Bai, did you only bring these?"</p><p>"They are the batch with the best aptitudes. The others are at Yuanling Peak."</p><p>The Bai surname demon cultivator replied.</p><p>They also had their own selfish motives, wanting their talented offspring to bond with the most promising disciples of the Green Ram Sect, achieving a synergistic effect.</p><p>Hearing these words, everyone was secretly excited, looking at the group of demons behind the old man.  The demons were also looking them over with their round eyes.</p><p>Unlike the demon cultivators outside, the spirit beasts from the Thousand Mountains Bamboo Sea had a peaceful aura, their eyes sparkling with intelligence. Some were small and adorable, some were simple and endearing, and some had compelling gazes and majestic demeanors.</p><p>Qin Zheng was inexplicably drawn to a small white fox. The fox was petite, seemingly not fully grown, with pure white fur except for a ring of black fur around its neck and chest, like a fluffy scarf.</p><p>The little fox also noticed his gaze and glared back fiercely.  Qin Zheng felt a strange connection but couldn't help but steal glances at it.</p><p>Seeing this, the little fox's eyes rolled, revealing a cunning glint. It suddenly stepped out of the group of beasts, occasionally glancing back at Qin Zheng with alluring eyes, before finally leaping down the mountain.</p><p>To Qin Zheng, this was clearly an invitation. His heart pounded. For some unknown reason, apart from this little fox, none of the other spirit beasts held any appeal for him, and he didn't care about the little fox's aptitude.</p><p>Qin Zheng whispered to the disciple beside him, indicating his intention to leave. Seeing that the disciple was talking to the old man, he finally couldn't hold back any longer. He withdrew from the crowd, activated his movement technique, and swept down the mountain.</p><p>After chasing in the direction the little white fox had disappeared for a while, Qin Zheng realized that he had been led into a dense forest.</p><p>The little fox leaped onto a tree branch, looked back at him as if urging him on, and then vanished into the forest again.</p><p>Seeing that the little fox was indeed waiting for him, Qin Zheng was overjoyed and exerted his movement technique with all his might. Unexpectedly, the little fox was even faster than him, and the distance between them grew wider and wider. If the little fox hadn't waited for him each time, he would have lost its trail long ago.</p><p>"Where are you taking me?" Qin Zheng shouted.</p><p>The little fox didn't respond, only looking back at him.</p><p>In this relentless pursuit, Qin Zheng's spiritual energy was rapidly depleting, but he was completely unaware, his eyes fixed only on the little fox.</p><p>"Ouch!"</p><p>A cry of surprise suddenly came from the forest. Qin Zheng was startled and found that his foot had been tripped by a vine.  His internal spiritual energy became disordered, and he tumbled towards the ground.  Below him happened to be a patch of mud, and he plunged headfirst into it.</p><p>Emerging from the mud, covered in muck, Qin Zheng heard a "hee hee" sound. The little fox was on a tree branch, laughing uproariously, covering its nose and mouth with its paws, as if to say he was too smelly.</p><p>"I'm... I'm sorry, I..."</p><p>Qin Zheng's face flushed red, and he stammered, not knowing how to explain. He regretted his previous neglect of cultivating his movement techniques, which had led to him being tripped by a vine and making a fool of himself in front of the little fox, but he was completely oblivious to the suspicious appearance of the vine.</p><p>He hurriedly cast a water-controlling spell, cleaning off the mud and stench from his body. Fortunately, the little fox didn't seem to mind and continued to beckon him with its eyes to follow.</p><p>Next, the person and the fox traversed one forest after another. Accidents occurred frequently along the way, each time with Qin Zheng as the victim, accompanied by the little fox's joyful cries.</p><p>Although Qin Zheng vaguely felt that the little fox was playing tricks on him, he was unwilling to believe it, thinking that the forests in this area were strange and probably hadn't been cleared by the sect yet. The little fox must have been here before and therefore knew where the dangers were.</p><p>After crossing several mountains, Qin Zheng followed the little fox to a cliff.</p><p>Below the cliff, next to a large river, they stood at the base of the cliff and felt a scorching heat blowing towards them. The cliff face was riddled with cavities, with flames erupting from within, and thick smoke billowing. The lake water flowing past here had become much warmer.</p><p>The little fox pointed at the smoke and dust above and chirped twice.</p><p>Qin Zheng looked up and saw a small tree growing halfway up the cliff, bearing two bright red fruits.</p><p>The little fox chirped again and looked at Qin Zheng expectantly.</p><p>"You want me to get the spirit fruits for you?" Qin Zheng asked.</p><p>The little fox nodded repeatedly.</p><p>"It really was looking for my help."</p><p>Qin Zheng dispelled his doubts, immediately brimming with fighting spirit as he rubbed his hands together and examined the cliff.</p><p>"It doesn't seem to be ordinary earth fire. The smoke has undergone some kind of mutation, making it even more dangerous. I can only climb up close to the cliff face..."</p><p>Qin Zheng stretched out his hand, but he wasn't deterred.  He swallowed a few pills to restore his spiritual energy, donned his most precious magical robe, and then circulated a water-attribute spell, coating his body with a layer of ice before using his hands and feet to climb upwards.</p><p>The climbing process wasn't as easy as he had imagined. The flames erupting from the cavities could even burn through his magical robe.</p><p>Qin Zheng gritted his teeth and persevered. When he finally reached the spirit tree after much hardship, his right hand gripped the stone platform. Suddenly, he felt a soft touch on his fingertips. His heart tightened, and he looked up, his face filled with astonishment.</p><p>The little fox had somehow arrived at the base of the tree, its front paws resting on his hand, completely unharmed. It tilted its head and looked at him with scrutinizing eyes.</p><p>"You..."</p><p>Qin Zheng was about to speak.</p><p>The little fox wrinkled its pink nose. "You're so clumsy. How are you going to protect me in the future?"</p><p>"You can talk?"</p><p>Qin Zheng was so shocked that his internal spiritual energy went haywire, destabilizing his spell. He was immediately burned by the fire, yelping in pain as he plummeted downwards.</p><p>The little fox looked helpless, covered its eyes, and sighed deeply.</p><p>The Thousand Mountains Bamboo Sea wasn't short of Demon Kings now.  With ample Emperor Flow Nectar, a single drop was enough to awaken the intelligence of a lesser demon.</p><p>"Splash!"</p><p>Qin Zheng fell into the river, drifting in the water before struggling to shore, the burning pain somewhat relieved.</p><p>The little fox jumped down and opened its mouth to say something, but suddenly froze, then嗖, hid behind Qin Zheng, curling up into a ball and covering its head with its tail.</p><p>Qin Zheng was puzzled, then immediately noticed two figures in the air.  Upon recognizing the appearance of one of them, his face paled.</p><p>"Ancestor..."</p><p>Qin Zheng hastily knelt down. "Qin Zheng greets Ancestor!"</p><p>Qin Niansui had just arrived from the North Sea and happened to be passing by.  He didn't pay attention to this junior member of the Qin family, only glancing at the little fox before continuing to fly towards the main peak.</p><p>The little fox trembled. After a while, it cautiously lifted its tail.  Seeing that the person in the air had left, it let out a long sigh of relief. Seeing Qin Zheng staring at it blankly, it nudged his arm. "Hey! What's your name?"</p><p>"My name is Qin Zheng," Qin Zheng replied honestly.</p><p>"Qin?"</p><p>The little fox's eyes rolled. It jumped onto his shoulder and lay down, sharing one of the fruits with him. "You'll do!"</p><p>...</p><p>Qin Niansui naturally wouldn't pay attention to the games of the younger generation.  His brow was furrowed, worried about the future of the sect.</p><p>Currently, only a few Nascent Soul cultivators in the Green Ram Sect knew about Qin Sang's return.</p><p>Qin Niansui didn't understand why Martial Uncle Yufu had made such a decision.  The Green Ram Sect had long wanted to re-establish its mountain gate, but they knew that all eyes were on them, so they could only postpone it repeatedly.</p><p>The Green Ram Sect had led the various races and sects against the Chang You Clan, and to convince them, they always maintained the moral high ground, taking the lead.  Initially, there were many skeptical voices, but later, when the experts of the Thousand Mountains Bamboo Sea were slaughtered by Mistfall, the Green Ram Sect suffered heavy losses, which also demonstrated to the world their unwavering determination, silencing any further dissent.</p><p>This situation had not come easily, and the Green Ram Sect had gone to great lengths to unite all parties.  Each race and sect had their own calculations, but with the Green Ram Sect setting an example, they could only consider the bigger picture, lest they defy the will of the world.</p><p>Now, with the external enemy still present, the Green Ram Sect's initiative to withdraw its manpower for the sake of opening its mountain gate seemed like a selfish act in the eyes of others.</p><p>If even the Green Ram Sect acted this way, how could they suppress the restless ambitions of the other factions in the future?</p><p>Could it be true, as the rumors suggested, that Fairy Liuli had been seriously injured in her last battle with the Chang You Clan's patriarch, and her condition was not optimistic, forcing the Green Ram Sect to prepare a retreat?</p><p>Even the North Sea was rife with such talk, let alone the Middle Continent.</p><p>It was said that during this tri-clan conference, the demon clans of the Demon Sea were the first to raise the issue, demanding assistance in reclaiming their ancestral lands. Although the Four Saints Palace and the Witch Clan did not explicitly agree, the situation was extremely tense.</p><p>"Husband, don't worry. Martial Uncle must have carefully considered this. When the time is right, we will naturally know."</p><p>The beautiful woman beside Qin Niansui offered gentle words of comfort.</p><p>The woman was Qin Niansui's Dao Companion and also Bai Hanqiu's eldest daughter.  Back then, when Bai Hanqiu mentioned this matter to Qin Sang, Qin Sang had left two jade pendants, which the couple now wore.</p><p>"Although Martial Uncle has his considerations, for the sake of the sect's grand plan, regardless of what others think, I must speak up about the hidden dangers I see!"</p><p>Qin Niansui shook his head slightly, his gaze sweeping across the ground.</p><p>He had to admit that the new mountain gate was truly magnificent, far surpassing the other sect locations. Even he couldn't help but be moved, no wonder the disciples were so enthusiastic.  Unfortunately, they only knew the joy of this place, unaware of the dangers lurking outside.</p><p>They increased their speed and soon arrived at the main peak, where a deacon greeted them as they landed.</p><p>Upon learning of their purpose, the deacon turned and entered the hall to report.</p><p>...</p><p>At this time, Li Yufu was at the back mountain of the main peak, respectfully standing in front of Qin Sang's cave dwelling.</p><p>After waiting for a while, he suddenly saw spiritual light flickering on the surface of the stone door as it slowly opened.  A moment later, Qin Sang walked out.</p><p>"Greetings, Martial Uncle."</p><p>Li Yufu bowed and followed Qin Sang as they flew to the summit.</p><p>Qin Sang stood with his hands clasped behind his back, releasing his divine sense, silently sweeping across the land, perceiving the changes within the Green Ram Sect.</p><p>After this period of seclusion, his cultivation had basically stabilized, and the Green Ram Sect had also undergone dramatic changes, basically meeting the requirements he had set before entering seclusion.</p><p>Next, he would begin preparations for constructing the Thunder Altar. Qin Sang planned to establish the main altar first, then build branch altars.  The construction of the mountain gate would proceed simultaneously with the construction of the altar.</p><p>Due to the extremely demanding requirements of the Thunder Altar, the Green Ram Sect's strength alone was insufficient.  Some things he had to do himself. (End of Chapter)</p>
