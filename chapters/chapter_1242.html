<h1>Chapter 1234: Encounter</h1><p>Qin Sang and Fat Chicken were both startled.</p><p>They had been avoiding the Wind and Thunder Mountain, doing nothing to provoke it, yet they had still managed to disturb the Blood Thunder.</p><p>Reacting swiftly, Qin Sang enveloped Fat Chicken with his true essence and instantly fled a great distance. However, the Blood Thunder clung to them like a persistent shadow, relentlessly pursuing them no matter how Qin Sang changed direction.</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang understood the situation and quickly retracted his spiritual sense while rapidly shifting his position.</p><p>'Whoosh...'</p><p>The Blood Thunder finally gave up the chase and retreated, leaving behind residual thunder energy in the void, like scattered drops of blood that vanished in an instant.</p><p>Fat Chicken was still shaken.</p><p>When pursued by the Blood Thunder, it felt as though its demonic blood was about to freeze, its body stiffening under the lock of the Blood Thunder's power. If struck, it would likely have been injured.</p><p>If the Blood Thunder had any other sinister abilities, the consequences would have been far worse than mere injury.</p><p>It turned to look at Qin Sang, unsure whether it was its own fault or if Qin Sang had done something to provoke the Blood Thunder.</p><p>After a moment of contemplation, Qin Sang transmitted a message: "Follow behind me, focus on activating the Thunder Bead, and sense your mother's location. Do nothing else."</p><p>"Yes!"</p><p>Fat Chicken knew that rescuing its mother here would rely entirely on Qin Sang, so it obediently complied.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at the Wind and Thunder Mountain and set off again, this time keeping an even greater distance from it.</p><p>He probed with his spiritual sense, and this time, the Blood Thunder did not react.</p><p>"This Blood Thunder is indeed strange. It can sense spiritual sense, even if it doesn't make direct contact. As long as it gets close, it will pursue. However, the Blood Thunder's sensing range is limited. As long as we keep our spiritual sense restrained and stay far enough away, we should be fine. The warnings from our predecessors were not without reason..."</p><p>As Qin Sang moved forward, he continued to test the rules of the Blood Lake.</p><p>Gradually, he gained some insights and began to pick up speed.</p><p>...</p><p>"Master, ahead seems to be one of the strange mountains marked on the fragment map."</p><p>Half an hour later.</p><p>Qin Sang and Fat Chicken saw a stone mountain. The mountain rose straight up like a pillar, standing out starkly and serving as a perfect landmark. The fragment map depicted just such a mountain.</p><p>The scenery here was completely different from the Wind and Thunder Mountain they had seen earlier.</p><p>There was no Blood Thunder or Yin Wind here, but the mountain was covered in strange blood-red trees. These trees grew horizontally from the cracks in the stone, resembling spikes protruding from the mountain, making the entire mountain look like a spiked mace.</p><p>The bodies of these blood trees were as hard as metal, their leaves like jagged iron shards. Blood clouds swirled around them, and anyone caught here would suffer the agony of having their flesh torn and their soul corroded.</p><p>Qin Sang took out the fragment map, located the mountain's position, and observed the surrounding terrain, confirming it was indeed the same mountain.</p><p>"According to the map's markings, the interior of the Blood Lake is considered the north, while we have landed on the southwest side. If we head straight east from here and make two round trips, we should be able to explore the outer perimeter of the Blood Lake..."</p><p>Qin Sang proceeded according to plan.</p><p>Fat Chicken followed closely behind Qin Sang, focusing on activating the Thunder Bead, but unfortunately, there was still no reaction.</p><p>Qin Sang silently noted everything he saw and heard. The outer perimeter was relatively easy to navigate, as these areas, similar to the Wind and Thunder Mountain, were spaced apart, with safe zones in between.</p><p>However, this only applied to the outer perimeter.</p><p>...</p><p>In a place filled with scattered rocks, there was a massive pit hundreds of feet wide in the center. The pit was bottomless and exuded an air of mystery.</p><p>At this moment, a Golden Core cultivator, with a treasure mirror floating above his head, was slowly descending into the depths of the pit.</p><p>'Bang! Bang!'</p><p>From time to time, blood-formed tentacles would emerge from the pit, striking the cultivator with immense force.</p><p>His expression remained calm as the treasure mirror above his head emitted a kaleidoscope of light, forming a soft barrier that neutralized the force of the tentacles. Despite the ferocity of the attacks, the barrier remained unbroken.</p><p>The blood tentacles were formidable, but the cultivator had set up a hidden formation at the entrance of the pit, ensuring that even if someone passed by, they would not notice anything unusual.</p><p>The cultivator was fully focused on battling the endless stream of tentacles, unaware that a man and a beast had arrived outside the pit, observing everything.</p><p>It was Qin Sang and Fat Chicken, who had been searching all along.</p><p>The formation set up by the cultivator was intricate, but it could not withstand Qin Sang's Heavenly Eye technique.</p><p>This was the second person Qin Sang had encountered.</p><p>Qin Sang had come across two cultivators so far, both at the Golden Core stage.</p><p>Qing Jun and the others must have already moved ahead.</p><p>"These guys clearly have guidance from higher powers. They have specific objectives and aren't just here to die. It seems that all sides have kept some information hidden, not entirely ignorant of the Blood Lake."</p><p>After observing for a while, Qin Sang nodded to himself.</p><p>After a brief glance, Qin Sang turned his gaze away and moved on.</p><p>These Golden Core cultivators knew little, and capturing them would be of no use.</p><p>From Qin Sang's observations, the formations within the pit were not weak. Even if he personally intervened, it would take considerable effort, and he couldn't afford to waste so much time here.</p><p>After searching for half a day, the Thunder Bead still showed no reaction.</p><p>Qin Sang estimated that if the Thunder Falcon Demon King was still alive, the chances of her being trapped in the outer perimeter of the Blood Lake were slim.</p><p>If she was trapped deeper within the Blood Lake, there was a risk of being caught in the crossfire of battles between the two realms. Qin Sang didn't want to be the first to act, but he also couldn't afford to arrive too late.</p><p>As they continued forward, Qin Sang occasionally tested the ancient formations, gauging their strength.</p><p>After moving swiftly for a while, Qin Sang was about to pass between two mountain peaks when his expression suddenly changed. He urgently transmitted a message to Fat Chicken, "Return to the Unity Ring immediately."</p><p>Hearing this, Fat Chicken was greatly alarmed, thinking they had encountered some danger. It quickly scanned the surroundings but found everything calm.</p><p>The mountain peaks on either side were shrouded in blood mist, with frequent Blood Thunder strikes, but they were still far enough away that they shouldn't suddenly attack.</p><p>Despite this thought, Fat Chicken didn't dare to delay. It knew that Qin Sang's abilities far surpassed its own, and there must be a reason for his command. It quickly stored the Thunder Bead and hid within the Primordial Unity Ring.</p><p>The treasure ring on Qin Sang's wrist flashed as he flicked his sleeve, and his figure vanished into thin air.</p><p>Once hidden, Qin Sang carefully activated his Heavenly Eye technique, peering through the mountain peaks to gaze at a distant summit.</p><p>It was a barren mountain, desolate and covered in scattered rocks, with nothing else in sight—no people, no signs of life.</p><p>But in Qin Sang's vision, there was a subtle difference. On a protruding stone platform, there was a faint white glow, invisible to the naked eye, clearly something unusual.</p><p>Seeing the white light, Qin Sang felt a sense of familiarity.</p><p>Within the white light was a chaotic void.</p><p>With the help of the Heavenly Eye Butterfly's enhanced abilities, Qin Sang could faintly make out the treasure emitting the white light and discovered a figure within it.</p><p>"It's really him!"</p><p>Qin Sang's expression turned to one of surprise. Before he could clearly see the figure's face, he ordered the Heavenly Eye Butterfly to retract its power, lest the other party detect them.</p><p>He would never forget this treasure—Dongyang Bo's life-bound treasure, the Diamond Ring!</p><p>Back in the Purple Palace, Dongyang Bo had used the Diamond Ring to capture Qin Sang and bring him into the Bronze Hall, threatening Chen Yan in person. If not for the Blood Filth Divine Light, Qin Sang might not have escaped that calamity.</p><p>"Why hasn't he joined up with Senior Sister and the others? What is he doing here?"</p><p>Qin Sang had initially thought the chances of success were slim and hadn't planned to act now, but he never expected to encounter Dongyang Bo in the outer perimeter of the Blood Lake.</p>
