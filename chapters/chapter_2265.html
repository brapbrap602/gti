<h1>Chapter 2255: Shadow of the Demon</h1><p>*BAM!*</p><p>With a sound like a thunderbolt on a clear day, the peaks trembled. The mountaintop slowly tilted outward before collapsing.</p><p>The Xian City army camp was located right there, on the summit!</p><p>The demons stared dumbfounded, gazing at the black figure in the sky with a mixture of fear and awe.</p><p>That single blow not only shattered the mountain-protecting formation but also completely destroyed the enemy camp!</p><p>What terrifying power!</p><p>Dust and smoke billowed.  Cries of agony rose from the ruins, and countless severed limbs flew out.  But the demons quickly noticed something amiss—the severed limbs lacked blood, their ends glowing with various colored lights, some even shimmering with a metallic luster.</p><p>On the palanquin, the commander's jaw dropped.</p><p>"Puppets? They were all puppets!"</p><p>A demon cultivator surnamed Gu exclaimed.</p><p>Qin Sang also showed surprise, though he had anticipated this.</p><p>After several clashes, the Xian City forces had learned the妖族 commander's personality. He wasn't an ambitious leader striving for glory, and both sides had been engaging in a tacit game of cat and mouse. This sudden large-scale invasion was certainly suspicious, so Xian City had left behind puppet soldiers to deceive the demons, while their main force had secretly withdrawn.</p><p>Qin Sang himself had provided both the strategy and the puppet-making techniques.</p><p>The black-robed figure, after shattering the formation with one strike, put away his staff, flew back to the palanquin, and coldly glanced at the commander.</p><p>The commander's heart trembled; his face turned ashen.</p><p>If he hadn't been so eager to impress the two envoys, he wouldn't have alerted the enemy. His clever plan had backfired; he'd destroyed the enemy camp, but they had all escaped.</p><p>A young Phoenix cultivator reprimanded him, "Foolish! Do you know why Yuan and I are here? No wonder you've accomplished nothing! Get back and face your punishment!"</p><p>Soon, Qin Sang and the demon cultivator surnamed Gu both received messages ordering them to await the arrival of a new commander.</p><p>The palanquin shimmered and vanished into the sky, carrying the commander away.</p><p>Qin Sang watched the palanquin leave without approaching the black-robed figure. If it was the Yuanxiang clan leader in disguise, there would be no danger.  But if it was the gray figure, it would be suicide. Qin Sang suspected the latter.</p><p>The gray figure had entered the illusion with them, but unlike them, it seemed to have retained its original strength. The black-robed figure's behavior, however, was normal; it even possessed intelligence!</p><p>Could there be another Qin Sang somewhere in the illusion?</p><p>Qin Sang mused. Even at his peak, he wouldn't have feared an intelligent gray figure, as he had always been careful not to reveal his full strength.</p><p>But now, he was so weak; the gray figure could crush him with a single finger!</p><p>This sudden discovery cast a shadow over Qin Sang's heart.  Unexpectedly, he had gained another powerful enemy.</p><p>Qin Sang was absent-minded while cleaning up the aftermath.</p><p>After gathering the spoils of war, Qin Sang and the demons returned to their previous camp. The commander's departure left the camp vulnerable, but the sight of the black-robed figure's power would deter Xian City from any immediate counterattack.</p><p>Qin Sang remained in the camp, his mind consumed by thoughts of the black-robed figure. He discreetly questioned the deputy commander and other demons about the figure's identity, but they knew only that he was a high-ranking envoy sent by the Phoenix clan.</p><p>As expected, things remained peaceful, and Xian City didn't counterattack. During this time, Qin Sang didn't wait for a new commander, but for the call he'd been longing for!</p><p>...</p><p>"Daoist Tianqi, are you going out?"</p><p>Outside the camp, the demon cultivator surnamed Gu was on guard duty when he saw Qin Sang fly out from the camp's center.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded. "The new commander is late. Staying cooped up in camp isn't a solution. I want to investigate and see if the enemy is making any moves."</p><p>Once out of the camp and away from the demons' sight, Qin Sang immediately changed direction, hiding in the deep mountains until he reached his pre-selected location.</p><p>Night had completely fallen.</p><p>There was no moon, and only a few sparse stars were visible.</p><p>Qin Sang expertly set up an array, then sat cross-legged, activating the *Tianyao Lianxing* technique to contact the mysterious person.</p><p>"Senior, are you a Great Ancestor of the Qingluan clan?"</p><p>Qin Sang asked, this time deliberately adopting a nervous tone, unlike last time.</p><p>"...Yes...you...ancestral hall...worship...which ancestor?"</p><p>The mysterious person was indeed a powerful being of the Qingluan clan.  Their voice was still intermittent, but the meaning was clear enough for Qin Sang to understand.</p><p>"Junior doesn't know which ancestor to worship, because Junior was born into a minor branch and isn't sure if my bloodline is pure."</p><p>Some time ago, I unexpectedly grasped a faint image of a divine being—a Azure Bird—and then I heard your voice…"  Qin Sang had already prepared an excuse regarding her identity.</p><p>"I see! But...why...you?"</p><p>The mysterious Azure Bird was surprised.</p><p>This was also Qin Sang's question. There were many Azure Birds, why was it her?</p><p>Even the mysterious Azure Bird didn't know the reason. It seemed it wasn't the mastermind; the root of the problem lay in the "Heavenly Demon Transformation" and the illusion.</p><p>Qin Sang was considering whether to reveal part of the "Heavenly Demon Transformation" secret when the mysterious Azure Bird's voice became urgent.  "Very well! Perhaps...we...share a bloodline...you are exceptionally gifted...your bloodline...has undergone a transformation...that's why...you heard me. My lucid moments...are becoming shorter...don't...waste time...on...unimportant matters…"</p><p>After speaking this long sentence, the mysterious Azure Bird seemed very strained, pausing before continuing, "Do you remember...what I said last time...?"</p><p>"Yes! You warned me about the extra-worldly demons! But..."</p><p>Qin Sang was confused. "What exactly are extra-worldly demons, and how can I identify them?"</p><p>The Azure Bird said, "Humans...descendants of gods...all the powerful beings…"</p><p>The answer was unexpected.</p><p>Qin Sang looked shocked. "What?  You mean the powerful beings behind humanity and the descendants of gods are all extra-worldly demons?"</p><p>"They...were not...but...corrupted by demons…"</p><p>The Azure Bird's condition was clearly unstable; its voice kept becoming blurry. Qin Sang could only listen and guess.</p><p>It meant that the powerful beings behind humanity and the descendants of gods were originally normal, but were later corrupted by extra-worldly demons, turning into demons themselves.</p><p>This led her to deduce that the mysterious Azure Bird was likely fighting extra-worldly demons, or powerful beings who had been corrupted.</p><p>"Why are the extra-worldly demons invading our world and corrupting those powerful beings?" Qin Sang pressed.</p><p>"Because this world...is about to nurture...a treasure of immense power!  In the past…"</p><p>The Azure Bird tried to explain the situation concisely, and Qin Sang finally understood the situation, confirming many of her previous guesses.</p><p>It turned out that the powerful beings of this world had sensed changes in fate and predicted that this world was about to nurture a treasure of immense power. This treasure was incredibly significant; it could help them transcend.  Therefore, all the powerful beings were alarmed.</p><p>Later, some powerful beings understood the celestial mechanisms and calculated the conditions to accelerate the treasure's maturation: to cause the beings of this world to slaughter each other.</p><p>While it was unclear if this would work, and not all powerful beings agreed with this cruel method, under the combined efforts of some, the situation gradually escalated to this point.</p><p>Initially, they intended to let the younger generation wage war first, to test the effectiveness of this method.  Unexpectedly, the great war erupted among the powerful beings themselves. Even more shocking, the powerful beings behind humanity and the descendants of gods were unknowingly corrupted by extra-worldly demons.</p><p>The extra-worldly demons' goal was obvious: to seize the treasure being nurtured in this world!</p><p>The treasure was nurtured in this world and should belong to its inhabitants, yet it was coveted by extra-worldly demons, bringing disaster.</p><p>Currently, powerful demon beings and extra-worldly demons were engaged in a great battle at the boundary. Their battle was beyond Qin Sang's comprehension; she only knew that neither side could withdraw, and neither could contact the outside world or transmit information.  The persistent calls of the mysterious Azure Bird unexpectedly managed to be heard.</p><p>Knowing the truth of this world, Qin Sang secretly guessed that the extra-worldly demons the Azure Bird spoke of were probably the powerful beings of the Otherworldly race.</p><p>Could the so-called treasure be the 'seed' Hong Tian spoke of?</p><p>The powerful beings of the Otherworldly race had also entered the illusion and were battling the powerful beings within, the situation was tense, leaving them unable to spare any resources, so they sent their younger generation to seize the treasure?</p><p>Qin Sang felt she was close to the truth, but many questions remained unanswered, such as the origin of those gray figures.</p><p>"We...are holding the demons...in a desperate battle...they sent...their wings...into the world…"</p><p>The Azure Bird's following words were very close to Qin Sang's guesses.</p><p>It was clear that these youngsters who had entered the illusion were the 'extensions' of the extraterrestrial demons!</p><p>Qin Sang's thoughts raced, but he remained calm.  "Senior, do you want me to find these extensions of the extraterrestrial demons?"</p><p>"Exactly!"</p><p>The mysterious Azure Bird's tone suddenly became urgent. "Eliminate them!  Prevent the treasure...from falling into the wrong hands!"</p><p>Unfortunately, the mysterious Azure Bird was completely unaware that he was speaking to one of the extraterrestrial demons' extensions!</p><p>"Eliminate the extensions of the extraterrestrial demons…"</p><p>Qin Sang looked troubled, his voice hesitant. "Junior's abilities are weak, I'm far from a match for those demons.  Furthermore, how can I find them, how can I distinguish who is an extraterrestrial demon?"</p><p>Before the mysterious Azure Bird could answer, Qin Sang pressed on. "I've heard that when one reaches your level of cultivation, they can transform into stars, residing in the heavens, overseeing the mortal world like a god. Nothing on earth can escape your eyes.  Where are these extraterrestrial demons hiding now?"</p><p>"I...cannot see very far...and...the demons' invasion...has disrupted the celestial order...I am entangled with a powerful enemy…"</p><p>The mysterious Azure Bird's voice was low.</p><p>Hearing this, Qin Sang's mind stirred; the mysterious Azure Bird hadn't denied it!</p><p>In other words, the powerful Yaozu cultivator who transformed into a star did indeed have the ability to monitor the world, but perhaps due to limitations in cultivation, the range of his observation varied.</p><p>If so, could he use this being to help him find someone?</p><p>A while ago, a letter arrived from the Dong Liang Sect.</p><p>Besides those sent to Yongtu City to fight, the Dong Liang Sect cultivators who remained at the sect were all busy with Qin Sang's matter, fully investigating the truth of that night, searching for survivors of the Ning family.</p><p>All clues had been checked repeatedly, with no news of any survivors.</p><p>It seemed likely that Miss Ning was dead.</p><p>Qin Sang had prepared himself for Liuli's rebirth, and was agonizing over how to find her when, unexpectedly, heaven sent him a 'star'!</p><p>He didn't know what Liuli would look like after her rebirth, but there was a clue. As long as Liuli remembered the stone pavilion, she would likely rebuild an identical one after being reborn.</p><p>If the mysterious Azure Bird could help him find such a pavilion, he could find Liuli!</p><p>The time wasn't right, so Qin Sang buried this thought, his expression unchanged, silently listening to the mysterious Azure Bird.</p><p>And the mysterious Azure Bird's next words answered another of Qin Sang's questions.</p><p>According to the mysterious Azure Bird, the extensions of the extraterrestrial demons lacked sufficient cultivation, their true forms unable to enter this realm. They could only use a method similar to reincarnation, transferring their essence into the bodies of living beings in this world.</p><p>In fact, these 'extensions of the extraterrestrial demons' were in a far more difficult situation than the mysterious Azure Bird imagined. Most were likely still unaware, believing themselves to be natives.</p><p>Thinking back, when Qin Sang first awoke, he had indeed been very much like a demon possessing someone else's body.</p><p>As such, these extraterrestrial demons were indistinguishable from the native beings on the surface. Even if the mysterious Azure Bird could monitor the world, he could only see the surface, unable to discern their true nature.</p><p>However, there was another way to find them!</p><p>The mysterious Azure Bird claimed that when the extraterrestrial demons sent their extensions into this realm, although they couldn't stop it, the demons' aura caused a disturbance in the celestial order, giving birth to a shadow of demonic energy, which now also existed in this realm.</p><p>Using this shadow, they could find their true forms.</p><p>As soon as the shadow and true form met, their auras would converge, and the extraterrestrial demons would be exposed.</p><p>"The shadow…is it those grey figures?"</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes flickered.</p><p>If they encountered the grey figures, they would no longer be able to hide their identities. However, they had been reborn as natives, their cultivation lost, while the grey figures retained their full strength.  If they met, wouldn't they be killed instantly?</p><p>Surely the powerful being from the Yi Ren tribe would have foreseen this situation and not ignored such a major weakness.</p><p>"The Sacred Mountain!"</p><p>At this thought, Qin Sang had a flash of inspiration.</p><p>Before entering the illusion, everyone had been vying for a place on the Sacred Mountain.  In order to compete for the Ling Huan Treasure Key, Qin Sang had also secured a position near the summit.</p><p>But the treasures were given by Hong Tian and others, originally rewards for the trials in the sacred land.</p><p>The competition for places on the Sacred Mountain itself had no reward; it was clearly preparation for the subsequent journey into the illusion!</p><p>Perhaps, upon encountering the shadow, the function of the Sacred Mountain would be revealed, possibly allowing them to instantly recall their identities and restore their strength.</p><p>But Liuli wasn't on the Sacred Mountain!</p><p>Qin Sang's heart sank. He asked, "Senior, do you want me to report this to my clan and have them encircle and wipe out the extraterrestrial demons?"</p><p>"Quickly…quickly go!"</p><p>The mysterious Azure Bird urged repeatedly, his voice growing weaker. He had said all this so that Qin Sang would bring the truth back.</p><p>But Qin Sang couldn't do as he wished!</p><p>Qin Sang's mind raced, and a look of terror appeared on his face.  "Those extraterrestrial demons are so terrifying, even the powerful human cultivators couldn't escape. Who can I trust now?  What if…the clan leader and the others have already become the extraterrestrial demons' claws?"</p>
