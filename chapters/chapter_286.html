<h1>Chapter 279 | Remarkable Sword</h1><p>Chapter 279 | Remarkable Sword</p><p>According to Qin Sang’s requirements, Cloud-wanderer chose Yu Kong from the three. </p><p>"Fellow Daoist Yu once entered Qiuhong Market and was able to leave safely from the defensive array. He is very familiar with the defensive array. This is an advantage that others do not have. The requirements set forth for everyone are not harsh. After entering the array, the Daoist leader is willing to continue cooperating. Of course, that would be a good thing. If he is unwilling, Fellow Daoist Yu will not force him. However, at the time of breaking the array, everyone must work together with one heart. No one can be selfish. What does the Daoist leader think of this?"</p><p>The shopkeeper said with some anticipation.</p><p>Hesitation appeared on Qin Sang's face. His gaze lingered on the shopkeeper as if he were undecided.</p><p>Seeing this, the shopkeeper gently slapped his thigh, stood up, and said, "Humble one has been presumptuous. The Daoist leader can have tea first. Humble one will not disturb the Daoist leader's雅兴."</p><p>Qin Sang quickly stood up and stopped the shopkeeper. "Fellow Daoist has misunderstood. Poor Daoist is not doubting Fellow Daoist, but has only heard that the defensive array of Qiuhong Market still has more than a year until its low point. It seems that there is no need to rush."</p><p>Invited earnestly by Qin Sang, the shopkeeper sat down again. "The longer the磨合, the more skilled the coordination, and the greater the probability of breaking the array. The Daoist leader must understand this principle. It is better to make plans early. By chance, there is an upper room in humble one's teahouse that is empty. Fellow Daoist can first stay in the small shop and make inquiries in the town to see if what humble one has said is true or false."</p><p>That night, Qin Sang stayed at the teahouse.</p><p>The second day, after leaving the teahouse, Qin Sang pretended to be taking a leisurely stroll in Western Waste Town. He vaguely felt that someone was spying on him, but he ignored it.</p><p>Qin Sang proactively asked at places recruiting people. Sometimes, he was politely refused. Sometimes, he received a warm invitation. Qin Sang did not agree to anything hastily.</p><p>For two days in a row, Qin Sang thoroughly investigated Western Waste Town. He had more than acted the part. He found the shopkeeper again and asked him to make an introduction.</p><p>The shopkeeper did not refuse and personally took Qin Sang to meet Yu Kong.</p><p>Yu Kong was rich and powerful. He had rented a cave府 in Western Waste Town. The cave府 was a small courtyard with two entries. Qin Sang followed the shopkeeper and met Yu Kong in the main hall.</p><p>Yu Kong was tall and thin with a feather fan and silk scarf. His temperament was calm. He was wearing a brocade robe, looking more like a scholar. From his appearance, his age seemed to be around 40.</p><p>More than 30 years ago, however, he was already a Foundation Establishment cultivator who had entered Qiuhong Market. His real age was definitely much greater than his appearance suggested.</p><p>Including Yu Kong, the three of them were all mid-Foundation Establishment cultivators. They had been hiding in Western Waste Town the entire time, gathering people and practicing the array.</p><p>Fortunately, Qin Sang and the others just wanted to find the location of the secret passage through Yu Kong and the others and did not really want to kill and seize the treasure. Otherwise, their odds of success would be extremely low.</p><p>Of course, after finding the garden, they would have to rely on their own abilities when fighting for the spirit medicine.</p><p>When he saw Qin Sang enter the hall, Yu Kong stood up immediately and said in a pleased tone, "This is Daoist Leader Qingfeng, is it not? The old shopkeeper has mentioned the Daoist leader to a certain Yu many times. Meeting you today, it is clear that you have an extraordinary demeanor!"</p><p>The shopkeeper smiled and said, "See, how could humble one have lied to you?"</p><p>Qin Sang had already seen Yu Kong’s portrait. The gap in their cultivation was enough to make him behave respectfully.</p><p>"Poor Daoist Qingfeng, paying respects to Fellow Daoist Yu! Poor Daoist is new here and have nowhere to turn. Fortunately, the old shopkeeper introduced me. I have heard that Fellow Daoist Yu has a grand aspiration and is willing to lead scattered cultivators like us into Qiuhong Market. Although poor Daoist’s strength is meager, I am willing to be driven by Fellow Daoist Yu. I hope Fellow Daoist Yu will not reject me."</p><p>Seeing that Qin Sang's words were respectful and contained no hint of arrogance, Yu Kong nodded secretly and said with satisfaction, "Daoist Leader Qingfeng is being too modest. A certain Yu only visited Qiuhong Market once. I just know some things about the defensive array, so I dared to stand out and make a suggestion. At the time of breaking the array, it will take all of the Fellow Daoists working together sincerely to accomplish the task. How could it be reasonable to reject the Daoist leader?"</p><p>After a pleasant conversation, the matter was settled.</p><p>After the shopkeeper had taken his leave, Yu Kong took Qin Sang to the backyard. "Daoist Leader Qingfeng, follow me. The spiritual force in this courtyard is quite strong. The Daoist leader can find a room in this small courtyard to live in, cultivating while practicing the array. There are also a few Fellow Daoists that the Daoist leader needs to get to know. When we break the array, we need to cooperate closely."</p><p>As he said this, Yu Kong released his divine sense, touching the restrictions of the three rooms for a moment.</p><p>Not long after, the doors of the rooms were all pushed open by four people. They were all Foundation Establishment early-stage cultivators. There were tall ones and short ones with not much difference in their strength.</p><p>The two sisters who came out of the first room looked quite similar. Their temperaments, however, were completely different.</p><p>"These are the Xiu sisters. They are skilled with a combined swordplay called the Liubo Sword. It can be strong or gentle, transforming freely. Its power is extraordinary."</p><p>After Yu Kong introduced them to Qin Sang, he helped Qin Sang make introductions.</p><p>The Xiu sisters. One of them was charming and seductive. Her name was Xiu Zhirui. She looked at Qin Sang curiously. When she saw Qin Sang looking over at her, she covered her mouth and smiled, her beautiful eyes sending a flirtatious glance.</p><p>The other woman was more aloof. Her name was Xiu Zhiying. She glanced indifferently at Qin Sang and ignored him.</p><p>"This is fellow Daoist Shangguan Lifeng. His precious blade can slice through anything and has made him famous among the rogue cultivators here," said Yu Kong as he gestured toward a man who emerged from another house, carrying a long saber in his arms.</p><p>The saber was entirely black. The edge of its blade wasn't pointed at Qin Sang, but even still he could sense its unparalleled sharpness. It was clear that this was no ordinary magic weapon.</p><p>In town, it was common for cultivators to store their magic weapons inside their bodies or inside mustard seed pouches.</p><p>Qin Sang knew that Shangguan Lifeng wasn't deliberately trying to mislead him. It was likely that he had mastered a high-level saber technique that required him to be in constant contact with his precious saber to reach the state where the saber and man became one, which would allow him to improve the power of his saber techniques.</p><p>"This one is..."</p><p>Just as Yu Kong was about to introduce the last person to Qin Sang, he was rudely interrupted by that last person.</p><p>"My name is Yan Wu, there's no alias about it, and I'm quite skilled when it comes to the way of talismans. I'm confident that I'm better than those old fogies at the Upper Pure Palace! Daoist Qingfeng, these seniors might have brought you here, but you still have to prove yourself worthy to the rest of us. Show us what you got, and don't come crawling to us for help later!"</p><p>This man was tall and muscular with a rugged appearance. He didn't mince words as he pointed a finger at Qin Sang.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Yan is a straight talker, and I ask that the Daoist please refrain from taking offense."</p><p>Yu Kong attempted to smooth things over, but he didn't actually try to stop Yan Wu. He looked expectantly at Qin Sang, as he was also waiting to witness his abilities.</p><p>Qin Sang had anticipated this, and he chuckled lightly as a beam of light suddenly flashed from the center of his brow.</p><p>――――</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>A dazzling beam of sword light shot out, and the sword energy immediately expanded dozens of meters.</p><p>The sword seemed like a streak of lightning, and the faint sound of a dragon's roar could be heard from it. If not for the fact that there was a protective restriction over the courtyard, then it would have been sufficient to shock an entire half of West Wilderness Town.</p><p>Right after, and before several pairs of astounded eyes, the sword energy abruptly dispersed and then reassembled into a sword formation. The power of the sword formation ruthlessly pressed down upon them, with most of its power targeting Yan Wu.</p><p>'Bang, bang...'</p><p>Yan Wu was completely caught off guard, and he stumbled backward several steps.</p><p>"Is this power, along with my lifebound spiritual sword and this sword formation, sufficient enough?"</p>
