<h1>Chapter 480: The Serpent Lady's Praise</h1><p>Qin Sang, clutching the yellow-armored man, landed on the ground. His skin, pale from blood loss, quickly regained its color thanks to the medicinal pills he'd prepared beforehand.</p><p>The black flames dissipated.</p><p>Beneath the sea of fire lurked four dark figures, each a formidable corpse-puppet crafted from the remains of late Core Formation cultivators.</p><p>This was Qin Sang's backup plan. If he'd lost the yellow-armored man, he wouldn't have hesitated to deploy these corpse-puppets or even the Void Thunder Talisman.</p><p>Qin Sang laid the yellow-armored man down.  His primordial spirit, severely damaged by the Nine Nether Demonic Flames, required immediate attention.  Qin Sang quickly administered treatment, then sealed the man's primordial spirit with a Heavenly Corpse Talisman before storing him within his Corpse Puppet Sack.  He would wait until he reached the Pseudo Core Formation stage before attempting to refine the man into a living corpse.</p><p>With Yu Hua and now the yellow-armored man, he had two candidates; at least one should prove successful.</p><p>Fortunately, the yellow-armored man's storage pouch survived the flames.  While it contained no treasures as remarkable as the Void Thunder Talisman, its contents were still a considerable fortune.</p><p>Then there was the pouch of Star Essence Stones. A quick estimate revealed roughly a hundred stones, barely covering the bottom.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered, pouch in hand. The yellow-armored man was one of the strongest among the sixty-six who entered Zenith Peak, yet even with the Spirit Locking Bracelet, he'd gathered so few stones.  Qin Sang already possessed over three hundred; with these, he had close to the equivalent of four people's collection.</p><p>Zenith Peak was vast, and everyone was scattered.  The others lacked Elder Jing's ability to discern the weaknesses of the restrictions and navigate the dangers so effortlessly. Even with luck, they might encounter two deposits at most, and victory wasn't guaranteed.</p><p>"This should be enough.  More would be excessive," Qin Sang thought.</p><p>No longer in a hurry, he proceeded cautiously, gathering a few more Star Essence Stones along the way, bringing his total to around five hundred.  As he left the canyon, the allotted time was almost up.</p><p>Qin Sang looked around, found a clearing away from the canyon, and stared at the sky.  The chaotic suction force, like a raging wind, was everywhere.</p><p>Suddenly, the wind stopped, as if time itself froze.</p><p>Now!</p><p>This pause was fleeting; missing it meant being trapped on Zenith Peak.</p><p>Qin Sang immediately summoned his Cold Gold Sword, merging with it and soaring skyward at maximum speed.</p><p>Like fireworks, dozens of multicolored escapes shot up from all over Zenith Peak, racing towards the heavens.</p><p>The chaotic winds reversed, now pulling from above.</p><p>Having experienced this upon entry, Qin Sang expertly navigated the chaotic suction, maintaining his sword light. Soon, an immense, white light filled his vision, resembling a giant hole in the sky.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>He plunged into the white light, and the chaos vanished.  Blinding whiteness gave way to the familiar sight of the boundless lake.</p><p>The gentle lapping of waves calmed his tense nerves.</p><p>Before he could steady himself, a gust of wind alerted him to an incoming attack. He dodged just in time, recognizing a fellow cultivator from the Spirit Controlling Sect who had exited Zenith Peak alongside him.</p><p>They exchanged nods and flew towards their respective camps.</p><p>The Serpent Lady and Vice-Island Master Xiao were still waiting.</p><p>Nearly twenty people had already emerged, standing respectfully behind the two island masters.  Senior Brother Rong was among them, a worried frown etched on his face.</p><p>Spotting Qin Sang, Rong offered a small smile and a nod.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced around, surprised by the number of survivors.</p><p>Upon reflection, it made sense.  Those who entered Zenith Peak were elites; barring extreme misfortune, survival was likely.</p><p>Suddenly, Qin Sang felt his waist lighten. Elder Jing had retrieved the pouch of Star Essence Stones.</p><p>"Oh?"</p><p>The Serpent Lady weighed the pouch in her hand, giving Qin Sang an appraising look.  She nodded slightly. "I recall you're a disciple of Lesser Hua Mountain. Well done!"</p><p>Instantly, all eyes fell on Qin Sang, the only one to receive the Serpent Lady's praise.</p><p>She tossed the pouch into the air and with a gesture, it opened, spilling Star Essence Stones.</p><p>One hundred, two hundred…</p><p>The stones glittered like crystals in the sunlight, seemingly endless, continuing to pour from the pouch.</p><p>This caught the attention of not only the Small Cold Region but also the Heavenly Path Alliance.</p><p>The onlookers' expressions ranged from shock and envy to apprehension as their gazes shifted between Qin Sang and the ever-flowing stream of stones.</p><p>Qin Sang stood before the Serpent Lady, his expression calm and unreadable.</p><p>His mind, however, was preoccupied with something else.</p><p>Ji Wu was not among the twenty. If he hadn't emerged, he likely perished within Zenith Peak, which was good news.  However, it was too early to be certain; more cultivators were still exiting.</p><p>Finally, the pouch emptied.</p><p>Over five hundred Star Essence Stones formed a small pile, their allure captivating.</p><p>The golden-armored warrior of the Heavenly Path Alliance glared at Qin Sang, his gaze so intense that Qin Sang felt a jolt, his face paling further, his heart skipping a beat.</p><p>Such a terrifying gaze, such a terrifying aura!</p><p>Qin Sang was inwardly shaken. Thankfully, the Serpent Lady intervened, her smile unwavering as she shielded him with her serpent staff.</p><p>"What's this?  Can't the Heavenly Path Alliance sore losers accept defeat gracefully without resorting to bullying?" she mocked.</p><p>"The outcome is not yet decided!" the golden-armored warrior retorted coldly, ignoring her taunt and turning back to the exit.</p><p>The waiting continued.</p><p>The Serpent Lady addressed Qin Sang, her tone gentler.  "Among those who have emerged, you've collected the most Star Essence Stones.  Even in past competitions, few have matched your achievement.  Lesser Hua Mountain has taught you well."</p><p>Qin Sang bowed, offering his prepared explanation. "You flatter me, Senior. It was merely good fortune. I stumbled upon a large cluster of free-floating Star Essence Stones…"</p><p>Whether the Serpent Lady believed him or not, she didn't press the matter, her attention returning to the Zenith Peak entrance.</p><p>As time passed, the beam of light narrowed, the mirror at its end shifting.</p><p>When the beam vanished entirely, Zenith Peak would close, hidden once more.</p><p>Qin Sang counted twenty-eight survivors from the Small Cold Region, including himself, meaning five hadn't made it.  The Heavenly Path Alliance had twenty-seven.</p>
