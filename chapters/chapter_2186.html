<h1>Chapter 2176: The Earth Splits</h1><p>Qin Sang recounted his earlier findings, speculating that Xin Hu might have fallen into that silent space.  Hearing this, both Liuli and Liao Chen considered it plausible, but whether to immediately go to the place Qin Sang described was a point of hesitation for all of them, including Qin Sang himself.</p><p>The journey was far too long, consuming many days, and there was no guarantee of finding Xin Hu even if they entered that space.  If a breakthrough were to occur here, they would miss their chance.</p><p>It was a difficult choice.</p><p>Fortunately, not many people should know about the silent space. If Xin Hu truly fell there, even if they arrived late, they could still get there before most others.</p><p>After some discussion, they decided to stay and observe for a while before making a decision.</p><p>During their recent escape, they had flown an unknown distance. The sea of light had expanded behind them, far exceeding Xin Hu's original scope.</p><p>After the frenzy, there were signs of an ebb. They retreated further, landing on a mountain, closely monitoring the changes in the sea of light.</p><p>After repelling the blood shadow, they encountered no other enemies, but they dared not be careless. Qin Sang remained vigilant, protecting Liao Chen with Liuli.</p><p>Liao Chen's condition was not optimistic; his injuries were severe, and this attack only worsened matters.</p><p>In Qin Sang's view, if Liao Chen couldn't recover his injuries quickly, and a breakthrough suddenly appeared, taking Liao Chen to Xin Hu would be more harmful than beneficial.  Not only would it not help Liuli much, but it would also require him to divert his attention to caring for Liao Chen.</p><p>Liao Chen was a helper chosen by Ning Zhenren for Liuli.  Until the very end, Qin Sang couldn't say these words directly and abandon Liao Chen. However, he had no personal connection with Liao Chen, only a nominal alliance. His rescue was out of consideration for Liuli. When necessary, he wouldn't hesitate.</p><p>Liao Chen seemed to have brought many elixirs. He took three more bottles of pills, slowly refining the medicinal power within.</p><p>Once Liao Chen felt slightly better, they looked at the fluctuating sea of light and exchanged their guesses about the changes in the sacred land.</p><p>The most crucial point was whether this change was intentionally caused by the ancestors of the Yi Ren tribe, or if the sacred land had genuinely encountered a problem.</p><p>If the former, it was part of a test.  Maintaining patience, the rules would eventually surface, and then the real competition would begin.</p><p>If the latter, it meant that something serious had happened to the ancestors of the Yi Ren tribe, and a great upheaval would sweep across the entire tribe. Their priority wouldn't be opportunities, but finding a way out.</p><p>The high monks of Ziyun Mountain had entered the sacred land many times and were very familiar with it. Liao Chen also mentioned that while the trial rules in the sacred land had varied in the past, they had never seen anything on this scale – directly destroying Xin Hu and many secret realms and legacies, even aiming to destroy the entire sacred land.</p><p>It seemed the strong Yi Ren warriors were just as confused as they were, all waiting for a signal, good or bad.</p><p>"I wonder where Clan Chief Yuanxiang is now?" Qin Sang said.</p><p>Within the sacred land, only the Zhu Yan tribe and Clan Chief Yuanxiang were well-disposed towards them.  Seeking refuge with Clan Chief Yuanxiang was undoubtedly the safest choice.</p><p>"The Zhu Yan tribe will not interfere in the disputes between the outsiders. Our temple and Clan Chief Yuanxiang have agreed to work together to crack an ancient formation, but that will have to wait until the Xin Hu matter is resolved," Liao Chen shook his head slightly. "I also don't know which secret realm Clan Chief Yuanxiang is currently exploring."</p><p>After a while, Qin Sang again detailed his experience in that silent space.</p><p>Upon hearing Qin Sang mention the toxin floating in the space, Liao Chen's expression suddenly changed. He hurriedly asked, "The toxin the Master mentioned, was it a kind of poisonous mist? What color was it?"</p><p>"It was a pink poisonous mist, or perhaps peach-colored..."</p><p>Seeing that Liao Chen seemed to remember something, Qin Sang recalled his previous experience and described it in detail.</p><p>"Did the Master personally come into contact with the poisonous mist? How potent was the poison?" Liao Chen asked repeatedly.</p><p>At the time, Qin Sang hadn't considered the connection to the Xin Hu dispute and hadn't seriously analyzed the toxin.</p><p>"I should have been some distance from the source of the poisonous mist. The mist was thin. When I tried to absorb a trace, my true essence became chaotic, showing how potent the poison was."</p><p>Liao Chen nodded, his gaze sweeping over Qin Sang and Liuli. He said solemnly, "The poisonous mist that Master Qin described reminds me of a place."</p><p>Qin Sang said earnestly, "I would like to hear more."</p><p>Liao Chen continued, "Among the Yi Ren tribe, there are many tribes skilled in using poison, so the sacred land is not short of places where poisonous miasma gathers.  Poisonous miasma can vary greatly in toxicity, and sometimes the toxicity can be used to identify the secret realms and legacies left behind by the ancestors of a particular tribe.  These are often exclusive to a specific tribe. Outsiders who don't know the special detoxification methods will find it difficult to take the inheritance inside."</p><p>Ancient texts left by my temple’s founder mention a poisonous miasma, a place of peach-colored toxic fog, much like the one described by Daoist Qin. It is called the Azure Scorpion Hall.</p><p>“Master is suggesting that the Azure Scorpion Hall may have been breached by the radiant light, causing the miasma to seep into the Silent Space?” Qin Sang mused.</p><p>“Precisely,” Lu Chen nodded, regretfully adding, “Unfortunately, that founder did not explore the Azure Scorpion Hall deeply and did not record the toxicity of the peach-colored miasma.”</p><p>Qin Sang pondered for a moment, then continued, “Master, do you know the location of the Azure Scorpion Hall?”</p><p>Lu Chen produced a jade slip, revealing a map.  After locating their position and studying it for a while, he circled an area and declared, “The Azure Scorpion Hall is nearby!”</p><p>Qin Sang looked at the spot Lu Chen indicated, finding it much closer than the Thunder Hall—only about three days’ journey.</p><p>Logically, the miasma in the Azure Scorpion Hall shouldn’t reach the Thunder Hall, but the Silent Space and the Sacred Land are distorted. Places clearly in the north of the Sacred Land appear near the Thunder Hall within the Silent Space.</p><p>“Azure…”</p><p>Suddenly, a muffled thunderclap interrupted Qin Sang.</p><p>The three looked in the direction of the sound, towards the heart of the light sea. The sight that met their eyes caused them to change color.  A surge of radiant light erupted from the depths of the light sea; another massive wave was brewing.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>Qin Sang abruptly stood, stared for a moment, and shouted, “Go!”</p><p>Liuli and Lu Chen also sensed the danger. Another wave of radiant light was forming much faster than expected, meaning the Sacred Land was changing even more rapidly. They needed to leave immediately to avoid a repeat of their previous experience.</p><p>Lu Chen allowed Qin Sang to use his true energy to lift him into the air, Liuli following close behind. They fled without looking back.</p><p>Their quick response proved effective. By the time the earth-shattering roar reached them, they were far from the edge of the light sea, beyond the most dangerous zone.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced back, seeing bursts of radiant light spreading like glowing orbs.</p><p>A new surge of light brewed within the light sea, a tidal wave as powerful, if not more so, than before.</p><p>Qin Sang continued to flee, wanting to put as much distance between himself and the light sea as possible, even if it meant missing some observations.  Being caught in it would be disastrous.</p><p>While fleeing, Qin Sang transmitted his thoughts, “Judging by this, a quick resolution is unlikely. I wish to visit the Azure Scorpion Hall first. What do you think?”</p><p>He wanted to scout ahead and gain access to the Silent Space quickly if necessary.</p><p>Lu Chen and Liuli both nodded in agreement. There was no other option but to try a different approach.  The more prepared they were, the better their chances.</p><p>However, this carried risks. Lu Chen asked, “The peach-colored miasma’s toxicity is unknown. Does Daoist Qin possess antidotal skills?”</p><p>Qin Sang modestly replied, “I know a little. However, if the Azure Scorpion Hall was breached by the radiant light, its formations must have also been damaged. In these kinds of hidden realms, miasma often intertwines with formations, supporting each other. If the formations are destroyed, the miasma’s potency may be weakened.”</p><p>After a pause, he asked, “Did the venerable monk from your temple record any connection between the Azure Scorpion Hall and any particular tribe?”</p><p>“Our founder encountered powerful members of the Xie Gou tribe near the Azure Scorpion Hall. Perhaps this hidden realm was created by an ancestor of the Xie Gou tribe…”</p><p>Lu Chen revealed all his knowledge of the Azure Scorpion Hall, but it offered little help for their immediate plans.</p><p>“Xie Gou…”</p><p>A thoughtful expression crossed Qin Sang’s face.  He recalled that the Xie Gou tribe was a water-affiliated tribe, not a superior one.</p><p>He knew the Xie Gou tribe was proficient in using poison, particularly in warfare. Their poison spread like a plague, rapidly claiming countless lives.</p><p>Such poison posed little threat to top experts like them, but the Xie Gou tribe's abilities certainly went beyond that.</p><p>As he thought, Qin Sang’s gaze inadvertently fell on a patch of radiant light.  His pupils constricted, and his speed slowed.</p><p>“Daoist Qin?”</p><p>Liuli questioned, thinking he’d spotted another danger.</p><p>Qin Sang gestured for them to look.  They saw the radiant light, and surprise crossed their faces as well.</p><p>Previously, all the radiant light, except that of the light sea, dissipated after reaching its peak, eventually vanishing completely.</p><p>This patch of radiant light, however, did not fade. It flickered, rose, and fell, seemingly brewing another surge of light.</p><p>“This…”</p><p>The three exchanged a glance, a feeling of foreboding heavy in the air.</p><p>Compared to the Sea of Radiance, this glow was insignificant, encompassing only a few nearby peaks.  It resembled a lake of light, but its implications were drastically different!</p><p>Following the Heart Lake, other areas began to show persistent glows.  Once such a light lake appears, it certainly won't be the only one. When the entire sacred land is covered in these expanding light lakes, they will eventually engulf the whole area, robbing everyone of their last foothold!</p><p>At this thought, Liuzhen's face grew even paler. His old wounds were not healed, and new injuries were added.  Unable to rest and recover, the powerful Grey Figure added to his danger. He couldn't rely on others to save him forever.</p><p>"We'll face whatever comes," he muttered. "Worrying won't help now!"</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't afford to lose heart either, offering comfort.  "The truth will eventually surface.  Perhaps the glow won't affect the Silent Space.  Once we reach the place I mentioned, Venerable Monk will be able to heal properly."</p><p>Glancing deeply at the light lake, Qin Sang increased his speed, heading straight for the Bi Xie Ancient Temple.</p><p>Unexpectedly, after only a short while, Qin Sang suddenly stopped, frowning at the front.  Liuli and Liuzhen were also on high alert.</p><p>Directly ahead was a majestic peak, with radiant barriers on either side, leaving only the central peak untouched by the glow.  A lone figure stood atop the peak, watching them with an ambiguous expression.</p><p>The person wore a long robe, only their face visible. The robe itself seemed to be a spiritual treasure, and the deliberate concealment made it impossible to determine their tribal affiliation.</p><p>"This path is blocked," the robed figure boomed.</p><p>Qin Sang coldly snorted. "Hiding your identity! Who are you, and why are you blocking my way?"</p><p>He glanced at the two sides but took no action.  Liuli and Liuzhen understood Qin Sang's intentions. They needed to avoid conflict but couldn't appear weak, lest they invite unwanted attention.</p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p>Before he could finish, Qin Sang let out a soft gasp, his gaze moving past the peak to the robed figure's back.</p><p>There seemed to be the energy of a magical battle.</p><p>Using his celestial vision, Qin Sang indeed discovered a large formation. Although concealed, some signs were still visible.</p><p>Noticing Qin Sang's actions, the robed figure's expression changed, their eyes hardening.  They stared intently at Qin Sang, as if ready to attack if he dared to take another step forward.</p><p>Just as the tension reached its peak, a rift suddenly opened in the void behind the mountain, and a figure flew out.</p><p>Their robes were bloodstained, their breathing ragged, clearly injured, yet their expression was triumphant as they carried two corpses.</p><p>"The journey was worthwhile!  Hmm, who are they?"  Their gaze fell on Qin Sang and the others, killing intent still lingering in their eyes.</p><p>The robed figure shook their head slightly, moving to stand beside their companion, exchanging words in hushed tones, apparently weighing the pros and cons.  Finally, fixing their gaze on Qin Sang, they slowly retreated.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't pursue them, relieved that they had just fought a battle and were injured. Otherwise, another conflict might have ensued.</p><p>"The situation is becoming increasingly chaotic," Qin Sang sighed.</p><p>A significant change had clearly occurred in the sacred land, and this trial would likely end prematurely.  The powerful warriors of the Yi Ren tribe had waited and prepared for hundreds, even thousands of years for this trial. Countless plans were disrupted by this event.  Unable to obtain the desired opportunities, many might seek to compensate their losses by harming others.</p><p>It was foreseeable that such situations would become increasingly common.  The sacred land would become a lawless jungle where the strong preyed on the weak.</p><p>In this jungle, the three of them, lacking a Transcendence-后期cultivator and with an injured member, were undoubtedly the weakest, the easiest targets.</p><p>No one could have predicted that the sacred land trial would turn into such a situation.</p><p>The three of them flew silently, carefully concealing their auras and maintaining vigilance.</p><p>They soon encountered several more light lakes, and the frequency of the radiant outbreaks increased, the crisis growing closer!</p><p>'Rumble…'</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>…</p><p>The earth shook.</p><p>The radiance filled the sky, and then a streak of light narrowly escaped the edge of the glow.</p><p>Qin Sang and the others had experienced this countless times and continued on their way.  But this particular glow intensified, its power terrifying.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't help but stop, turning to look back. The glow had pierced the sky, forming a massive pillar of light, like a sword thrust into the heavens.</p><p>A thunderous roar reverberated from the heavens, surpassing even thunder, as if the celestial dome had been pierced!</p><p>Then, Qin Sang and the others widened their eyes, witnessing a shocking sight.  A gigantic chasm, stretching north and south, had appeared in the sky, centered on the radiant pillar, tearing the heavens apart.</p><p>The sky had split open!</p>
