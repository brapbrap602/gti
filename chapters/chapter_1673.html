<h1>Chapter 1664: Emperor's Bestowal</h1><p>The connection was severed!</p><p>Qin Sang had been closely observing the Fire Jade Centipede's reaction.  The moment they tumbled out of the fissure and escaped the Five Elements Divine Restriction, the centipede's agitation ceased.  Kun Dao's whereabouts were unknown.</p><p>Unlike the murky depths of the Nine Nether Geomagnetic Field, the outside world was bathed in brilliant light, bright as day. Qin Sang now stood upon a rocky outcrop, the gurgling of flowing water reaching his ears.</p><p>Collecting his thoughts, Qin Sang glanced back to see a stone wall and a waterfall. The stream of water was slender, not at all boisterous, but rather imbued with a sense of refreshing elegance.</p><p>The water cascaded into a pool. The stone pool was not large, yet the water level remained perfectly even with the edge.</p><p>No matter how much water flowed in, it never overflowed.</p><p>This was clearly the work of some kind of restriction, but not one meant for offense or defense.  The surroundings appeared peaceful, which was precisely why Qin Sang had chosen this spot to emerge.</p><p>Though the scenery was beautiful, there were no signs of life.</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head slightly and took a step forward, looking down from the rock.</p><p>There was no doubt that he had passed through the Five Elements Divine Restriction and entered the interior of Emperor's Bestowal Mountain.</p><p>The view from above and below was similar.  As far as the eye could see, layers upon layers of clouds and mist formed a multicolored wall, encircling the entire mountain.</p><p>Yet there were differences.</p><p>From below, the Heavenly Staircase on Emperor's Bestowal Mountain seemed to be directly exposed.  Now, Qin Sang had a peculiar sensation, as if an unseen force hung in the air, isolating the mountain from the world outside.</p><p>If this force truly existed, it could be inferred that the entire Emperor's Bestowal Mountain was enveloped within it, its edges merging seamlessly with the clouds and mist, connected to the Five Elements Divine Restriction.</p><p>Because of this sensation, Qin Sang couldn't discern whether the clear blue sky he saw was real or an illusion.</p><p>It was like being placed within a bounded field, with the Five Elements Divine Restriction serving as its entrance.</p><p>Of course, this was merely Qin Sang's conjecture.  Apart from this, there was no discernible difference between the inside and outside of the cloud barrier.</p><p>"That woman is probably hiding somewhere, licking her wounds..."</p><p>Qin Sang sneered.</p><p>Kun Dao's injuries from the Heavenly Lightning and the Death Seal were real, especially Su Zinan's Death Seal, which was quite sinister and didn't seem easy to resolve.</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't afraid of Kun Dao's pursuit, but he feared she might be frightened off, causing the Crimson Immortal Pendant to become lost again.</p><p>This woman held the geographical advantage, but neither Qin Sang nor Su Zinan feared her. With their discerning eyes, they could naturally see that Kun Dao's control over the Five Elements Divine Restriction was limited, and her own power wasn't particularly formidable.</p><p>If this woman lurked in the shadows like a venomous snake while the situation was chaotic, she would indeed be dangerous and require vigilance.</p><p>In a direct confrontation, however, Qin Sang didn't believe he would lose.</p><p>He turned and looked up. From this position, he could vaguely see flickering white light on the southern slope of Emperor's Bestowal Mountain, which should be the Heavenly Staircase he had seen earlier.</p><p>According to Zhu Wudao, the Heavenly Staircase was the only way to reach the Wordless Jade Wall, and attempting to find another path was futile. Emperor's Bestowal Mountain was the heart of the Formless Immortal Sect, heavily fortified with restrictive formations. Even Grand Cultivators like themselves had to tread carefully on the mountain.</p><p>The shadows of pavilions and halls were faintly visible amidst the mountain forests.</p><p>Each one was shrouded in clouds and mist, heavily guarded.</p><p>"Can she manipulate the restrictions and spirit formations in other areas, or is it limited to the Five Elements Divine Restriction?"</p><p>Qin Sang pondered, reminding himself to be cautious in his actions.</p><p>Kun Dao was nowhere to be seen, and Su Zinan, the Poison King, and the others were also unaccounted for.</p><p>Qin Sang flipped his hand and retrieved the golden sword.</p><p>Recalling the Boiling Snow Pill he had destroyed, Qin Sang felt a pang of regret. But if he hadn't acted decisively, Su Zinan would have obtained it, leaving him no choice.</p><p>Having endured the impact of the Nine Nether Geomagnetic Field, the golden sword's luster was significantly dimmed, turning a dark gold.</p><p>Qin Sang channeled a sliver of divine sense, touching the golden sword and sensing its essence. He was quite surprised to find that it wasn't a spiritual treasure or a magical treasure, but rather a treasure similar to a jade slip.</p><p>Due to its special material and refinement method, sword intent was preserved within the sword, serving as both protection and a seal.  If it were an ordinary jade slip, it would have been destroyed in the explosion.</p><p>Sealed within such a precious golden sword, it must contain either a top-tier cultivation technique or crucial information.</p><p>The jade sword should have been similar, but unfortunately, it was destroyed.</p><p>Qin Sang's interest in the golden sword intensified.  After some probing, he found it quite troublesome.</p><p>Having suffered repeated damage, the seal had weakened considerably.  It wouldn't be difficult to break, but it had also become sensitive. Forcibly breaking the seal might cause it to collapse entirely, repeating the fate of the jade sword.</p><p>Just as Qin Sang hesitated, a blaze of light suddenly erupted from the direction of the Heavenly Staircase.</p><p>Someone was already ascending the staircase. Qin Sang's expression turned serious.  He didn't linger, analyzing the golden sword's seal while swiftly moving towards the staircase.</p><p>The Wordless Jade Wall remained his primary objective, even taking precedence over the Immortal Pendant.</p><p>Emperor's Bestowal Mountain held a transcendent status. The Formless Immortal Sect had meticulously crafted its landscape, making it a place of breathtaking beauty, with each step revealing a new vista.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't linger on the scenery, swiftly traversing the mountain, avoiding areas with restrictive formations as much as possible. It still took him considerable effort to reach the foot of the Heavenly Staircase.</p><p>Along the way, Qin Sang had gained a good understanding of the layout of Emperor's Bestowal Mountain.</p><p>It was no wonder one had to ascend via the Heavenly Staircase.  Most of the buildings on the mountain were situated on either side of the staircase, with towering pavilions and multi-storied structures, often veiled in dense fog, appearing otherworldly.</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>A gentle breeze brushed past the Heavenly Staircase as Qin Sang's figure materialized.</p><p>He looked up and saw an archway bearing the inscription 'Emperor's Bestowal', written in bold, powerful strokes.  A single glance caused his eyes to sting slightly, as if sword intent surged forth, piercing his inner being and unsettling his mind.</p><p>It must have been inscribed by a peak Sword Cultivator!</p><p>Qin Sang knew that passing through this archway signified truly setting foot upon Emperor's Bestowal Mountain.</p><p>He glanced left and right, still not seeing Su Zinan or the others.  Looking up the staircase, due to the intrusion of others, the upper reaches were shrouded in swirling clouds and flickering lights, obscuring any figures.</p><p>Qin Sang stepped through the archway.  For a moment, his scalp tingled, as if a sword were truly pointed at him from above, a subtle warning.</p><p>Along the way, he discovered traces of broken restrictions, with residual auras bearing distinct characteristics that pointed to Purple Lightning True Person's handiwork.</p><p>Signs of combat were scarce, making it impossible for Qin Sang to determine the outcome of the battle between the righteous path and the demonic cultivators.</p><p>He paused briefly, then quickened his pace.  After ascending tens of thousands of steps, his figure suddenly halted.  Using his Heavenly Eye divine ability, he spotted two figures â€“ the two True Persons of the Eight Scenery Palace.</p><p>At the same time Qin Sang saw them, Purple Lightning True Person seemed to sense something. He abruptly turned, his pupils flashing with purple lightning, his sharp gaze fixed directly on Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze narrowed slightly, his expression unchanged as he stood with his hands clasped behind his back.</p><p>Only then did he notice that the two True Persons were being obstructed by a strange wind.  Gray gusts swirled, forming a massive vortex that firmly blocked their path.</p><p>The strange wind was imposing, yet its sound was faint, with Qin Sang only hearing a low, whistling sound.</p><p>Before the wind vortex, Crane Cry True Person wielded a cerulean umbrella.  The umbrella spun on its own, emitting beams of azure light that continuously pierced the vortex, but seemingly to little effect.</p><p>"I didn't expect that Old Devil Fan would refine a Yin Profound Wind Pearl. With the wind formation enhanced by the pearl, Zhu Wudao has created quite a nuisance..."</p><p>Crane Cry True Person furrowed his brow, racking his brains for a way to dispel the wind vortex.</p><p>The Yin Profound Wind Pearl was a secret treasure of the Sky Howl Tower, requiring the gathering of five types of naturally occurring Yin Winds, along with various precious spiritual materials, for its refinement. Because it was a single-use treasure, it was even more valuable, and it had been a long time since anyone had refined one.</p><p>This treasure, combined with the Sky Howl Tower's Yin Profound Demonic Formation, possessed drastically increased power.</p><p>Old Devil Fan currently lacked manpower to deploy the demonic formation, but unexpectedly, he used it here. Combined with the pre-existing wind formation of the Heavenly Staircase, it was remarkably effective in stalling them.</p><p>As he spoke, Crane Cry True Person noticed Purple Lightning True Person's actions and said gravely, "Someone else has entered?"</p><p>Purple Lightning True Person grunted in acknowledgment, retracting his gaze and continuing to observe the wind vortex.</p><p>Crane Cry True Person, however, was distracted.  He snorted, "With Sect Master Yue absent, these demons and ghosts, seeing our diminished numbers, dare to harbor such thoughts."</p><p>Purple Lightning True Person remained unconcerned.  "Zhu Wudao breached the Jade Pavilion, creating a weakness in the sword formation. It's normal for them to be able to enter.  Ignore them. Keep a close watch on Zhu Wudao."</p><p>"I'm just worried about someone exploiting the situation if a fight breaks out later."</p><p>Given Crane Cry True Person's temperament, he would prefer to eliminate both the demonic cultivators and the remnants of the Formless Immortal Sect, but the current situation and their limited strength didn't allow for it.</p><p>With the path to the Immortal Palace severed, they had to seize the opportunities within Emperor's Bestowal Mountain before the various factions gathered, or their efforts would truly be in vain.</p><p>What Purple Lightning True Person said next greatly surprised Crane Cry True Person.</p><p>"Brother, I've perused ancient texts and found a record mentioning a Wordless Jade Wall on Emperor's Bestowal Mountain.  Its origins are shrouded in mystery, but it's said to contain Nascent Soul insights, allowing one to comprehend profound mysteries.  Having entered the mountain, I observe the summit's aura and find it consistent with the ancient texts. It seems the records are true. It must be Zhu Wudao who revealed this secret, using the Wordless Jade Wall to barter for their assistance. Since they are drawn by the Wordless Jade Wall, let them fight amongst themselves."</p><p>Purple Lightning True Person spoke indifferently, showing no interest in the Wordless Jade Wall.</p><p>"Nascent Soul insights, how can we relinquish them?" Crane Cry True Person was puzzled.  What was the purpose of all their efforts if not to obtain the opportunities within the Immortal Palace Sword Tomb and strive for Nascent Soul?</p><p>He didn't understand why his senior brother had changed his mind.</p><p>"Junior brother, you're unaware," Purple Lightning True Person shook his head. "That Wordless Jade Wall is quite peculiar. For unknown reasons, only those who have cultivated diligently on Emperor's Bestowal Mountain for a prolonged period, allowing their Qi to harmonize with the Jade Wall, can truly grasp its profound mysteries. Other cultivators can still gain some benefits, but the effects are far less significant.  For me, it's like tasteless chicken ribs. Zhu Wudao must know this as well, which is why he's not afraid of others competing with him."</p><p>"This..."</p><p>Hearing these secrets, Crane Cry True Person became even more perplexed. "If that's the case, why would Zhu Wudao risk being hunted by us, just to enter Emperor's Bestowal Mountain?"</p><p>If the Wordless Jade Wall was as Purple Lightning True Person described, it wasn't worth Zhu Wudao risking his life, unless there was something else attracting him.</p><p>"He must be after a certain spiritual treasure," Purple Lightning True Person said solemnly. "This treasure, deeply hidden within the Formless Immortal Sect, has unknown origins.  Since its acquisition, it has been sealed within Emperor's Bestowal Mountain, rarely used. Aside from the upper echelons of the Formless Immortal Sect, outsiders are unaware of its form, let alone its location. Rumors claim its power is unparalleled, having played a crucial role in the Demonic Tribulation. There were even rumors claiming it to be the number one spiritual treasure in the Central Continent!"</p><p>Crane Cry True Person was astonished. "The number one spiritual treasure in the Central Continent? That's quite a claim.  How does it compare to our Eight Scenery Palace Lantern?"</p><p>"Their uses are different; they cannot be compared. If it is as powerful as the rumors suggest, even if I don't achieve Nascent Soul, wielding that spiritual treasure, I wouldn't fear any Nascent Soul cultivator."</p><p>Purple Lightning True Person was pursuing Zhu Wudao precisely for this treasure.</p><p>Purple Lightning True Person knew he couldn't enter the Sword Tomb, and ordinary opportunities were unlikely to propel him to Nascent Soul. He had personally stirred up this chaos, and to protect the Eight Scenery Palace, he had to find another way.  Thus, he set his sights on that mysterious spiritual treasure.</p><p>This treasure was stored on Emperor's Bestowal Mountain and had vanished without a trace since the Formless Immortal Sect's destruction, most likely still remaining on the mountain.</p><p>Zhu Wudao's actions also indicated the presence of other valuable treasures on Emperor's Bestowal Mountain.  Even if it wasn't that specific spiritual treasure, there must be something else.  Keeping an eye on him was the right course of action.</p><p>However, he didn't know the treasure's location or appearance, and the current situation didn't allow for a thorough search. Zhu Wudao was an excellent guide.</p><p>Crane Cry True Person thought further, asking, "If this spiritual treasure is so powerful, why didn't the Formless Immortal Sect use it when they were destroyed?"</p><p>Purple Lightning True Person sighed. "Back then, the Patriarchs of the Daoist Temple and the Buddhist Monastery realized that the surviving experts of the Formless Immortal Sect had been tainted by demonic influence and had sealed themselves within Emperor's Bestowal Mountain. You must understand the horror of demonic taint. In the beginning, it can be purged, but once the demonic intent takes root, there's no turning back. That Demonic Tribulation ravaged the Southern Barbarian Two Continents, and the cultivation world had already suffered greatly. If it were to happen again, there would be no stopping it. To prevent such a catastrophe, the Patriarchs took action against the Formless Immortal Sect, eliminating the threat. When they launched their attack, they completely sealed off Emperor's Bestowal Mountain, preventing anyone from entering. Naturally, no one could ascend the mountain to retrieve the treasure..."</p><p>...</p><p>Behind the wind vortex.</p><p>Zhu Wudao and Old Devil Fan, one sitting and one standing.</p><p>They weren't far from the Daoist True Persons, but the wind vortex between them was like an impassable chasm.  Seeing the Wind Pearl and the vortex successfully holding back the two True Persons, both of them appeared quite relaxed.</p><p>Zhu Wudao sat cross-legged, his eyes slightly closed, his fingers moving like a wheel as he sent out hand seals.  These seals, however, weren't directed at the wind vortex, but towards the sides of the Heavenly Staircase.</p><p>Hidden within the stone steps on either side of the staircase were concealed runes at regular intervals.</p><p>Old Devil Fan stood beside Zhu Wudao, manipulating the Wind Pearl while looking up at the summit of Emperor's Bestowal Mountain. Then, glancing down at Zhu Wudao, he chuckled, "As expected of a descendant of the Formless Immortal Sect, Junior Brother, you possess such profound knowledge of this place. All the formations and restrictions are at your command, used as you please."</p><p>Zhu Wudao continued his actions, modestly replying, "Senior Brother flatters me. What I know is merely superficial. I can only gradually activate the runes along the Jade Path. If not for Senior Brother's assistance with the Wind Pearl, buying me some time, I wouldn't be able to form the formation, and it would be impossible to hinder them in the slightest."</p><p>"That old bull-nosed Purple Lightning is indeed formidable, but Junior Brother needn't worry.  That old Daoist, as the mastermind behind this chaos, has undoubtedly incurred the wrath of many. The Eight Scenery Palace will have plenty of trouble in the future. As long as the Nascent Soul insights you mentioned are real, I'll guarantee your safety," Old Devil Fan said leisurely.</p><p>"The Wordless Jade Wall is just above. Once the formation here is complete and they're trapped, I'll take Senior Brother there."</p><p>Zhu Wudao spoke frankly.</p><p>As he spoke, he sent out more and more hand seals. A faint, clear light shimmered from the sides of the jade steps, and then lantern-like phantoms slowly rose.</p><p>These weren't lanterns, but wind cages, empty in the center, with swirling streams of azure wind circulating within.</p><p>A single wind cage possessed no great power, but together, numerous wind cages instantly formed a vast wind formation.</p><p>In an instant, a furious gale swept across the Heavenly Staircase!</p>
