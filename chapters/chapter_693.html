<h1>Chapter 685: On the Right Track</h1><p>A month after discovering the trace of the Jiao dragons.</p><p>In the cave dwelling, the elderly couple and four others had returned at some point.  All five were in the main hall, restless, only Qin Sang was absent.</p><p>"The Daoist's speed is beyond our reach. Why hasn't he returned yet? Could it be...?"</p><p>The Wang sisters' brows were furrowed, their voices filled with deep worry. "If something happened to the Daoist, wouldn't the trading company blame us for insufficient investigation, for causing harm to the Daoist?"</p><p>The elderly couple remained relatively calm.  "The Daoist's strength is extraordinary. Even a Jiao dragon at the Yaodan stage wouldn't easily be able to harm him. Don't worry. We'll wait another day, if..."</p><p>Mid-sentence, the old woman's expression suddenly changed, and she dashed out of the cave dwelling.</p><p>Immediately, the others sensed something and followed suit.</p><p>As soon as they reached the entrance, they saw a streak of sword light speeding towards them. It circled the island once before descending in front of them—it was Qin Sang.</p><p>The elderly couple and the others breathed a sigh of relief, their faces lit up with joy.</p><p>"Senior, you're finally back!  Were there really Yaodan-stage Jiao dragons in that group?"</p><p>Qin Sang nodded. "That's right, at least one at the mid-Yaodan stage."</p><p>He hadn't expected to encounter an accident while hunting the last Jiao dragon.</p><p>After discovering the migration trail of the Jiao dragon group, they immediately followed it for more than ten days, confirming it was just a group of Yaoling-stage blue Jiao dragons. Qin Sang decided to make his move.</p><p>However, for some reason, he felt a nagging sense of unease before he acted.</p><p>Qin Sang ordered the elderly couple and the others to stay far away, then approached the Jiao dragon group alone.  As a precaution, he sent out a Sha corpse to test the waters.</p><p>Unexpectedly, a Yaodan-stage Jiao dragon was hidden among the group. It instantly killed the Sha corpse and charged towards his hiding place. Judging by its aura, it was at least a mid-Yaodan stage Jiao dragon.</p><p>Upon discovering this Jiao dragon, Qin Sang instantly realized he'd been tricked.</p><p>It seemed his initial feeling after hunting the first blue Jiao dragon was correct; that blue Jiao dragon's identity was not simple.</p><p>However, Qin Sang hadn't expected these beasts to be capable of luring and ambushing him. This Yaodan-stage Jiao dragon likely possessed intelligence.</p><p>Deep in the Demon Sea, even facing a pre-Yaodan stage demonic beast, Qin Sang would observe before deciding whether to attack, let alone a mid-Yaodan stage Jiao dragon.</p><p>Startled, Qin Sang didn't hesitate; he turned and fled, warning the elderly couple and the others to leave immediately.</p><p>Fortunately, Qin Sang was cautious enough. His real body was hidden far away, and with the Nine Dragon Heavenly Chariot Talisman, which had absorbed eight Jiao dragon spirits, coupled with sword energy and thunder sounds, his escape speed was astonishing.</p><p>After a series of twists and turns, amidst the Jiao dragon's enraged roars, he successfully evaded it.</p><p>"We can't stay in this sea area anymore. Do you know of any other places where Jiao dragons appear?"</p><p>Qin Sang had been targeted by the Yaodan-stage Jiao dragon, and continuing to hunt Jiao dragons nearby was extremely risky. He decided to change direction. Demonic beasts in the Demon Sea also had their territories, so Qin Sang wasn't too panicked, but recalling how close he came to being lured into an ambush made him shudder; he dared not underestimate them again.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang chased by a Yaodan-stage demonic beast yet remaining calm, the elderly couple and the others secretly admired his composure, gradually calming down themselves.</p><p>The elder pondered for a moment, then said, "Beyond the sea trench, the most suitable place is west of Duyan Island. There's a sea area where a type of fish demon called Fuhu is abundant. Jiao dragons seem to enjoy eating Fuhu, and their presence can sometimes be seen there. However, Yaodan-stage demonic beasts occasionally appear around the Fuhu sea area; only Foundation Establishment-stage cultivators dare to hunt there."</p><p>Qin Sang's heart stirred. He looked around at everyone and asked, "When do you plan to return to Duyan Island?"</p><p>The five were taken aback. "Senior, why do you ask?"</p><p>Qin Sang mused, "I've decided to go to the Fuhu sea area and find a cave dwelling there to cultivate for a few years. If you're not in a hurry to go back, I intend to continue employing you to find demonic beasts for me. However, this time I need you to help me locate the lairs of Yaodan-stage demonic beasts, because my cultivation method requires it. Of course, you won't need to participate in the hunting itself."</p><p>The Qiongyu Trading Company had more than just him as a refiner, only the most refined spirit materials were reserved for Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang and Qiongyu Trading Company agreed that he would only return every few years, which would not affect his own cultivation. Hearing the elder mention the Fuhu sea area with its numerous Yaodan-stage demonic beasts, it was a perfect place for him to comprehend killing talismans.</p><p>He had brought a lot of pills and other items before leaving, so he decided not to return to Duyan Island for now.</p><p>But demonic beasts won't come to him; his efficiency in searching for them alone is low, and it would waste a lot of time.</p><p>These individuals are quite adept, though their cultivation is somewhat low.  However, they're more than capable of locating monster nests.</p><p>The five exchanged glances.  Having followed Qin Sang and benefited greatly, and understanding his character, they were naturally delighted.</p><p>However, the Fuhu Sea was far too dangerous for cultivators at their level (False Core Stage), leaving them hesitant.</p><p>"Following me will ensure you're well-rewarded. As long as you diligently serve me, I will personally refine magical artifacts for you, no worse than that bone sword and bone spear."</p><p>Qin Sang's words were alluring. He then turned to the elderly couple, "You two have reached the limit with the Demonic煞妖 pills, but you can still take other spirit medicines. Accumulate more resources; perhaps you'll encounter an opportunity for Core Formation. Or are you truly willing to give up?"</p><p>The question struck their hearts.</p><p>The couple exchanged a look and gritted their teeth. "We, husband and wife, are willing to follow your commands, Daoist Master."</p><p>They then turned to the other three. "Fellow Daoists, unlike us, you haven't taken many Demonic煞妖 pills and still have hope. Whatever you decide, we won't mind. If we part ways, I hope we'll never forget our years hunting monsters together."</p><p>The man in gray robes readily agreed, having been promised a bone sword by Qin Sang.</p><p>The Wang sisters smiled wryly. "When we first arrived, we knew nothing. We owe our current standing to your guidance, seniors. How could we abandon you now? Besides, the Daoist Master is offering us an opportunity that may never come again.  If we miss it, we will surely regret it for the rest of our lives."</p><p>All five agreed to Qin Sang's terms.</p><p>Qin Sang laughed heartily and immediately led them away from the cave, flying directly west.</p><p>Two months later, they reached the Fuhu Sea. After more than ten days, they found a deserted island concealing a spirit vein and carved out several cave dwellings near it.</p><p>"Finally on the right track,"</p><p>Qin Sang sighed, looking at the simple dwellings.  Since his Core Formation, he had been unsettled, unable to cultivate peacefully. Now, he had finally found a suitable place.</p><p>"You five will take turns guarding the island. The other four will pair off and go out, prioritizing the search for the Jiao. If you discover a monster nest, don't act rashly. Wait for me to personally assess the monsters' cultivation level."</p>
