<h1>Chapter 1784: The Wooden Jiao</h1><p>A cold wind swept across the desolate wilderness.</p><p>First, a silver sword light flashed from high above, followed shortly by a green glow.  As the two beams of light passed, figures flickered momentarily in the swaying vegetation on either side.</p><p>Qin Sang and the other three, led by the Swordmaster, maintained a safe distance to avoid any unexpected attacks.  They had only been in the Evil Marsh for three days, and encounters with powerful beasts were uncommon, but this caution was habitual.</p><p>Powerful beasts typically roamed only the deepest parts of the Evil Marsh, rarely venturing to the edges, and even more rarely approaching the area around Mount Ju. Even the Daoist sect would find a powerful beast near here a serious problem.</p><p>Though Zhongmao, Baishi, and Ju Mountains are adjacent, vast stretches of their borders connect with the Evil Sea and Marsh, often suffering beast attacks.</p><p>Qin Sang knew the mountain and river gods under the Daoist court’s jurisdiction were, at most, at the Transformation stage. Unless the Daoist court deployed all its high-ranking officials to guard the borders, the region would never know peace.</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>Qin Sang struck a monkey demon on the forehead, the creature collapsing silently. Without pausing, he moved on, his gaze sharp as he surveyed the area.  Although many beasts were encountered, opportunities to attack were infrequent.</p><p>Beasts weren't entirely mindless; as they grew stronger and time passed, they gradually succumbed to the influence of the Six Heavens' noxious qi, losing themselves. Lower-level beasts were merely more ferocious and bloodthirsty than ordinary demons, not significantly different. Even true beasts possessed the instinct for self-preservation, fleeing upon sensing the group’s presence.</p><p>Cultivators entering the Evil Marsh wouldn't lose their minds in a short time. Even after spending decades in the depths, they wouldn't necessarily lose their rationality.  However, exceeding a certain limit, the Six Heavens' noxious qi would take root in the primordial spirit, becoming extremely difficult to remove. This change was gradual, so cultivators might not notice any abnormality initially, but it remained a hidden danger.</p><p>As their cultivation deepened, it would inevitably erupt, leading to regret.  Therefore, cultivators entering the Evil Marsh either planned carefully or prepared abundant elixirs.</p><p>Initially, the four exchanged messages frequently, but later it became monotonous travel.</p><p>After more than a month's journey, the deeper they ventured into the Evil Marsh, the wilder the scenery became.</p><p>“There's a mountain ahead.  Further on, we might encounter beasts of comparable strength.  This area is relatively calm; let’s meditate here for a while.”</p><p>The Swordmaster transmitted his voice, suddenly accelerating.  The others quickly followed, arriving at the mountain shortly after.</p><p>Upon seeing the summit, Qin Sang was surprised, but the Swordmaster and the others reacted with indifference, leaping to the peak and finding stones to sit on.</p><p>Qin Sang arrived last, landing on a black stone next to the others.  The stone was square and sharply edged.  Using his spiritual sense, he discovered many similar stones nearby, though most were severely damaged and scattered on the slopes.</p><p>These stones couldn’t have formed naturally; they were clearly artificial.</p><p>Observing the traces on the summit, Qin Sang made another discovery.  “This… seems to be the ruins of a Daoist temple…”</p><p>This surprised him. This location wasn't near Mount Ju. Four powerful cultivators had traveled for a month, albeit not at full speed due to various concerns.  Yuan Ying cultivators certainly wouldn't dare stay here long.  Who would build a temple in such a place?</p><p>Furthermore, Qin Sang noticed the ruins were very old, an ancient temple.  The traces suggested it was abandoned and then occupied by beasts. For some reason, this lair was now abandoned again.</p><p>“Could it be that the Evil Marsh once had cultivators?”</p><p>Qin Sang's thoughts raced, even suspecting that this area, like Mount Ju, was once within the Daoist sect’s territory.</p><p>This speculation led to more questions. If there was a temple, it meant the area was once suitable for cultivation. Why did it become the Evil Marsh?</p><p>The Swordmaster looked over, saying, "Qingfeng, focus on stabilizing your mind."</p><p>“Thank you for the reminder, senior brother. I understand the importance of that.”</p><p>Qin Sang bowed slightly, putting aside his thoughts and sitting cross-legged.  Protected by the Jade Buddha, he had nothing to fear, but he still needed to maintain appearances.  Deep in the Evil Marsh, he occasionally took a pill.</p><p>After meditating, they continued their journey.</p><p>Unexpectedly, they encountered their first powerful beast shortly after leaving the mountain!</p><p>*Roar!*</p><p>A roar echoed from ahead, somewhat muffled due to distance.</p><p>A powerful roar filled the air, instantly alerting the four cultivators.  They stopped in their tracks.</p><p>Night had fallen.</p><p>Moonlight bathed the land.  Dark clouds gathered in the north, a swirling mass pressing towards them.</p><p>Yuhuang Zhenren lightly plucked at her strings, a green light shooting forth, transforming into a符影 (fuying) that vanished into an ancient tree.  The tree withered instantly, then a shadowy wooden figure sprang from the dead wood. Its presence was almost imperceptible, blending seamlessly with the forest.</p><p>The figure bowed to Yuhuang Zhenren before disappearing into the ground.</p><p>Qin Sang, observing Yuhuang Zhenren's actions, watched closely.  Previously, she and Guyun Zhenren had handled most beast encounters; Yuhuang Zhenren rarely took action. This time, she used a powerful talisman without summoning an altar.</p><p>"That talisman is one of Yuhuang Zhenren's life talismans, excellent for scrying. We should have results soon,"  Zhijian Zhenren explained through voice transmission.</p><p>Only talismans imbued with powerful cultivation techniques are called life talismans.  Yuhuang Zhenren, having achieved third-order cultivation, possesses three.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered for a moment before asking his question. In their eyes, he was a lucky, low-level cultivator, so his naiveté was expected.</p><p>Zhijian Zhenren explained, "You'll understand once you reach third-order cultivation. At the Dongxuan level, your altar stabilizes.  For talismans you've mastered, you don't need to summon your altar, even when using life talismans. However, if you haven't fully grasped a spell, you must summon the altar to draw on its power.  Of course, this only applies to the Golden Seal Altar…"</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, understanding Zhijian Zhenren's earlier actions.  The Golden Seal Altar's advantage over the Military Altar lay in its instantaneous activation, without the need for prior preparations.</p><p>"Although," Zhijian Zhenren continued, "it's said that with deep enough cultivation of the Military Altar, one can bypass summoning soldiers and directly communicate with the altar's forces to instantly form an array."</p><p>Guyun Zhenren scoffed, "I've yet to see such a master. Who knows if that's true?"</p><p>A green shadow emerged from the ground and entered Yuhuang Zhenren's palm.</p><p>Yuhuang Zhenren's face brightened. "It's a wooden Jiao! Its power is only slightly above ours, and there are no other high-level beasts nearby."</p><p>"A wooden Jiao?  Are you planning to use its core to forge an altar?" Zhijian Zhenren guessed Yuhuang Zhenren's intention.</p><p>Yuhuang Zhenren cultivated wood-type magic.  Forging a third-order altar requires either rare treasures or the essence, bones, or core of a powerful beast.  High-level beasts in Guifang were not easily slain, and suitable beasts were rare, hence Yuhuang Zhenren's delight.</p><p>"Mid-stage Dongxuan cultivators. What do you two think?" Zhijian Zhenren looked at Qin Sang and Guyun Zhenren.</p><p>Guyun Zhenren cracked his neck, radiating intense fighting spirit.  Qin Sang nodded in agreement.</p><p>They were all early-stage Nascent Soul cultivators. Hunting a beast comparable to a thunder turtle should pose no threat.</p><p>"Thank you for your help," Yuhuang Zhenren said with a graceful bow.</p><p>They flew towards the beast, discussing their plan, when they sensed the presence of other cultivators below.</p><p>Zhijian Zhenren said gravely, "Let's deal with them first."</p><p>Their target was a high-level beast; they didn't want to reveal their presence prematurely.</p><p>…</p><p>Inside a mountain cave, three Daoists worked frantically, anxiety etched on their faces.</p><p>One summoned an altar, continuously launching talismans towards the cave entrance, gradually forming a dark barrier.  The other two, positioned before an incense burner, worked together, filling the small cave with thick smoke. Both the smoke and the barrier concealed their presence.  All three were Shengxuan Zhenren.</p><p>"Senior Brother, will the beast find us?"</p><p>A female cultivator on the left of the incense burner spoke, her voice trembling.</p><p>"I knew we shouldn't have gone so deep! We haven't even erased our tracks outside.  This area rarely sees high-level beasts," the Daoist sealing the entrance grumbled.</p><p>The last Daoist, a middle-aged man, sensed the external aura. "Junior Brother, Junior Sister, don't worry.  The stronger the beast, the lower its intelligence. It won't find us through traces. We'll be safe once it passes."</p><p>Before he finished, a cold snort echoed, accompanied by an overwhelming pressure. "You're quite bold, coming here."</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>The three's faces turned pale. They rose abruptly, but found no one. The middle-aged Daoist bowed to empty space, "We didn't know you were here, Senior.  We were hiding from the beast and disturbed you. Please forgive us. We'll leave immediately after it passes."</p><p>"No need to wait, leave now. It can't detect you," the voice was cold and unwavering.</p><p>The three exchanged a look, resentment and worry etched on their faces, yet an unseen pressure stifled any thought of rebellion.</p><p>Heavy-hearted, they deactivated the seal on the cave entrance and started to leave, only to be stopped again.</p><p>"Wait! How long have you been here? Did you notice anything unusual?"</p><p>The middle-aged Taoist’s expression brightened.  "We arrived ten days ago.  A large group of ferocious beasts charged out from the depths of the  Abyssal Wasteland. We watched for a few days, seeing no other abnormalities, and took a chance; we didn't retreat."</p><p>The four in the air exchanged glances.</p><p>"That place is further north. It shouldn't affect this area so quickly,"  Master Guyun doubted.</p><p>"Perhaps someone intervened along the way? Time is of the essence. Kill the Wood Jiao and depart immediately," Master Zhijian commanded.  Everyone immediately dispersed, each to their task.</p><p>The three Xuan-level masters emerged from the cave. Seeing the Wood Jiao change its flight path, they rejoiced, escaping without looking back.</p><p>"It's coming!"</p><p>In a mountain valley, Qin Sang and Master Guyun stood on opposite peaks, watching the approaching dark clouds.</p><p>A slender green shadow flickered ahead of the clouds.</p><p>Master Guyun raised his arm, black light flashed, and a long spear materialized in his palm.</p><p>The spear was entirely black, its luster cold, its blade hinting at a bloody gleam—clearly a peerless weapon.</p><p>Gripping the spear, Master Guyun's fighting spirit surged and intensified.</p><p>Compared to him, Qin Sang was far more reserved. He didn’t activate his Wood Spirit body; golden light flowed over his body as he activated the King Kong Heavenly Armor Seal.</p><p>'Roar!'</p><p>An enraged dragon's roar shook the earth.</p><p>The dark clouds churned, and a long figure burst forth, nearly a hundred meters long, its giant eyes radiating terrifying ferocity, sharp horns atop its head, its entire body covered in thick, green scales.</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>The Wood Jiao suddenly swung its long tail, seemingly cleaving a green chasm in the void.</p><p>At that moment, both Qin Sang and Master Guyun's hearts leaped, let alone Master Youhuang, who faced the Wood Jiao directly.</p><p>For cultivators at the Transcendence stage, each increment of cultivation brought exponentially greater power from Heaven and Earth.</p><p>Although the Wood Jiao was a beast, its every move instinctively borrowed the power of Heaven and Earth to suppress its enemies, and each strike was unrestrained.</p><p>In Master Youhuang's eyes, it wasn't just a tail; it was an overwhelming force.</p><p>In an instant, terrifying pressure descended with the tail, making Master Youhuang feel as if he'd sunk into a mire. This blow seemed capable of shattering the void and erasing him from existence.</p><p>Master Youhuang, however, was prepared. Calmly, he shifted, transforming into a符影 (talismanic shadow).</p><p>'Crack!'</p><p>The tail swept past, shattering the shadow.</p><p>Simultaneously, countless fist-sized green lights rose from the forest, coalescing into a human form—Master Youhuang.</p><p>Unharmed, this action only enraged the Wood Jiao further.</p><p>Roaring, the Wood Jiao dived, its eyes blazing with an intense ferocity, their color now pure white.</p><p>Instantly, all the vegetation ignited with a ghastly white flame.</p><p>White flames soared, strangely leaving the forest within untouched.</p><p>Master Youhuang's face paled slightly. He felt a strange force relentlessly draining his energy, frantically trying to suppress it.</p><p>Then, the Wood Jiao descended, flames raging, enough to incinerate the heavens. The Wood Jiao's actual body was invisible, only the overwhelming white flames dominating the world.</p><p>"Beast! Die!"</p><p>A sudden roar exploded.</p><p>Master Guyun glared at the white flames, his fighting spirit exploding. He leaped, like a released tiger.</p><p>With a flick of his wrist, he hurled the spear, transforming into a black lightning bolt.</p><p>The spear spun rapidly, its immense power forming a black vortex at its tip. The vortex grew larger, and a mere graze caused half a mountain to collapse.</p><p>The sounds of wind and thunder erupted, instantly piercing the white flames, blasting a black hole within the inferno.</p><p>The Wood Jiao was exposed.</p><p>At that moment, a figure appeared beside the Wood Jiao—Qin Sang, his hands forming the Demon-slaying Seal.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes suddenly flashed.</p><p>So close to the Wood Jiao, and a level below in cultivation, he sensed no suppression from the power of Heaven and Earth emanating from it.</p><p>"Impossible?"</p><p>Qin Sang was equally surprised. Even in his prime, he had to evade the Thunder Tortoise's attacks.</p><p>In a flash, Qin Sang traced the source, surprisingly finding his Dharma image resonating.</p>
