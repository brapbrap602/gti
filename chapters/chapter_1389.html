<h1></h1><p>Venerable Feng's eyes flickered, "With his strength, he should be able to hold off Bifang on his own, and that's enough. If we truly obtain the Xuan Tian Palace treasure, the fewer people who know, the better. Besides, having an outsider is unlike having centuries of friendship between us; it would be difficult to share the spoils."</p><p>The white-robed scholar hesitated slightly, "The situation is not yet under our control; I fear that when the ruse is finally revealed, we won't be able to hide the truth from his eyes and will be forced to speak the truth."</p><p>Venerable Feng had already prepared a countermeasure, saying lightly, "That won't be a problem either! It's all a conspiracy by the demon race; we've been kept in the dark all along and only just realized it."</p><p>"Venerable Feng's words are most true."</p><p>The black-clad swordsman chuckled.</p><p>...</p><p>Qin Sang sped across the sea, playing with a bamboo-slip-shaped treasure in his hand, which was a unique communication treasure of Fengyang Mountain.</p><p>Along the way, he clearly felt that the atmosphere was even more tense than when he left.</p><p>He learned from Venerable Feng's mouth that:</p><p>There were at least five demon kings lurking nearby.</p><p>The strongest, Bifang, Qin Sang had already experienced, and its strength was beyond doubt, having always been Venerable Feng's mortal enemy.</p><p>Another one worth noting was Frogfish.</p><p>Qin Sang had also fought him, and Frogfish's poison was precisely countered by the Fat Silkworm.</p><p>The other three great demon kings each had their own methods, but their reputations were inferior to the two demons.</p><p>According to Venerable Feng's plan, if they were to fall into a chaotic battle, Qin Sang would entangle Bifang, allowing Venerable Feng to act as he saw fit, whether to cooperate with Qin Sang to surround and kill Bifang or to first slay the other demon kings.</p><p>Qin Sang recalled being chased by the three great demon kings.</p><p>Bifang only displayed exquisite escaping techniques and *blood light* divine powers at that time, and surely there were other divine powers that he had no chance to use.</p><p>How could such a strong expert not have trump cards?</p><p>Qin Sang made up his mind that unless he was confident in killing Bifang, his primary consideration would be his own escape route.</p><p>Hunting Star Island.</p><p>The shape of the island was somewhat similar to Crescent Moon Realm, long and narrow in shape, stretching from east to west like a city wall, blocking the azure waves surging from the north and south.</p><p>Qin Sang flew to the outside of Hunting Star Island in a low-key manner, took out the token, and the token turned into a stream of light and shot in.</p><p>Before long, a streak of escaping light flew out from the island, which was a Core Formation stage cultivator.</p><p>This person was also Venerable Feng's direct disciple, ordered to lead troops and garrison this place.</p><p>"Qian Cheng greets Senior Mingyue!"</p><p>This person swept his gaze, saw Qin Sang, and quickly flew over and bowed down.</p><p>Qin Sang instructed Qian Cheng not to make a fuss, and then followed him into the island.</p><p>Qian Cheng brought Qin Sang to the best cave dwelling on the island.</p><p>"You may step back. If there is any abnormal movement from the demon race, do not panic and report to me in time."</p><p>Qin Sang did not refuse, looked around, and said lightly.</p><p>Qian Cheng repeatedly agreed, looking overjoyed. With a Nascent Soul cultivator stationed on the island, they had a backbone, and even if the demon race attacked the island, they would have the power to resist.</p><p>Qin Sang's cave dwelling was on the top of a mountain, with no figures visible around, extremely quiet.</p><p>He walked into the cave dwelling and closed the door.</p><p>Not long after, suddenly a phantom figure quietly left the cave dwelling. Qin Sang looked around and swept towards a desolate low mountain on the edge of the island.</p><p>The cave dwelling was silent, with a person sitting upright, holding a communication magic treasure in his hand, actually a Nascent Soul puppet in disguise!</p><p>Qin Sang came to the desolate mountain, his figure swayed, passed through the island's restrictions, quietly escaped the island, and found an inconspicuous reef nearby, arbitrarily opening up a cave dwelling.</p><p>With a Nascent Soul intentionally hiding, the cultivators on the island would not be able to discover his trace even if they searched the heavens and the earth.</p><p>The reason why it was so troublesome was because Qin Sang did not completely trust Venerable Feng.</p><p>Nascent Soul Ancestors were all cunning and treacherous. Qin Sang had only met Venerable Feng twice, and he knew even less about the nature of Island Lord Shen and others, and did not dare to fully believe their words.</p><p>He came to the outer territories alone.</p><p>If the other party was intent on setting a trap and framing him, it would be imperceptible, and there would not even be anyone to avenge him.</p><p>At the very least, they would divert the trouble eastward, letting him attract the demon race's main force, and his situation would be very dangerous.</p><p>One should always be wary of others.</p><p>Qin Sang took precautions and had his true body escape, leaving the Nascent Soul puppet in the cave dwelling, so that he could remedy the situation in time if something happened.</p><p>After breaking through the Nascent Soul mid-stage, he had even stronger control over the Nascent Soul puppet.</p><p>Plus, his Senior Sister's previous careful guidance.</p><p>Although it could not be as flexible and free as an *incarnation outside the body*.</p><p>As long as they were not too far apart, or separated by a barrier formed by powerful restrictions, he could control the Nascent Soul puppet through the soul imprint on it.</p><p>Venerable Feng and Island Lord Shen had not seen Qin Sang take action.</p><p>Only a few demon kings knew that he had a Nascent Soul puppet.</p><p>Presumably, those demon kings would not communicate with Venerable Feng about this matter.</p><p>Having made the arrangements.</p><p>Qin Sang sat down cross-legged in the cave dwelling and took out the Demon Banner.</p><p>He planned to focus his energy on the *Fire Seed Golden Lotus* and the *Heavenly Demon Body Refining* first, which did not require such harsh requirements for Heaven and Earth spiritual energy.</p><p>Time passed slowly in quiet cultivation.</p><p>This sea area was surging with undercurrents, but the surface was still calm.</p><p>The guards on Hunting Star Island did their jobs in an orderly manner, and nothing important happened. Qian Cheng did not dare to disturb Qin Sang's quiet cultivation.</p><p>...</p><p>Nameless Island.</p><p>The white-robed scholar sat withered in the hall, and every once in a while, he would try to urge the demon rat essence blood to find the Xuan Tian Palace traitor.</p><p>But looking at his furrowed brows, it seemed that there was not much progress.</p><p>...</p><p>North.</p><p>Waves surging.</p><p>Demonic aura soaring to the sky!</p><p>If a human race cultivator saw this scene, he would definitely tremble in his legs, and without hesitation, turn around and run away.</p><p>Above the sea, it was a dark mass.</p><p>Tens of thousands of demon soldiers, some hovering in mid-air, some floating up and down in the water, surrounded a small island.</p><p>Now it can still be seen that there are human race city ruins on the island, but at this moment it is silent, and no one can be seen.</p><p>The demon soldiers entrenched around seemed to be very afraid of this island and dared not step into it.</p><p>Immortal Mountain in the island.</p><p>The cave dwellings of cultivators were now occupied by several demon kings.</p><p>The three demon kings who had chased Qin Sang were all present and had all transformed into human form.</p><p>Frogfish had become a bald man with dark green skin and fish scales still present.</p><p>The meat tumor on top of Bifang's head was bright red and dazzling. Even in human form, it could not dissolve this unsightly meat tumor, resulting in an extremely strange appearance, which could be described as ugly.</p><p>Cunning Fox had transformed into a stunningly beautiful young woman, petite in stature, draped in light gauze, with alluring secrets looming, and her eyes full of affection, shimmering with watery light, infinitely charming.</p><p>In addition, there were two other demon kings, a man and a woman, sitting on stone chairs with their eyes closed to rest.</p><p>Frogfish looked anxious, pacing back and forth, and occasionally looked towards the cave dwelling.</p><p>"Why is there no movement after so long? Could it be that Fellow Daoist Hong's divine power has failed?"</p><p>Bifang persuaded Frogfish to be calm and not impatient, "The human race is ignorant, don't you know? Fellow Daoist Hong comes from the Rainbow Rat clan, born with twins, naturally telepathic. The two bodies cultivate together, and the other body is a natural avatar. Although its strength is not strong, it has enviable peerless divine powers. If the main body falls, it can be resurrected with the help of the avatar. Fellow Daoist Hong has always been cautious, and this time he did not expect the trick of Old Ghost Feng, and was calculated, losing the main body. The avatar hasn't been used yet, so it must be foolproof. However, resurrection must not be so simple, so let's wait patiently."</p>
