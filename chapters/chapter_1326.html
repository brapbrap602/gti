<h1>Chapter 1318: Disturbance in the Forbidden Area</h1><p>Having just approached the forbidden area, the Fire Jade Centipede showed unusual activity.</p><p>Qin Sang had only witnessed this behavior twice before.  Once, when he discovered the Red Fire Gilded Metal in an ancient cultivator's relic, and again in the Abyssal Ruins, when he was drawn to a mysterious white bronze artifact.</p><p>Qin Sang looked up towards the mountaintop.  Whatever was attracting the Fire Jade Centipede was within the mountain!</p><p>Besides the mountain within a mountain, what other secrets were hidden within the Xu Ling Sect's forbidden area?</p><p>Qin Sang suppressed his curiosity, placing a restriction on the Fire Jade Centipede to prevent Bing Han from noticing it and causing a misunderstanding.</p><p>There might be rare treasures within the mountain, but Qin Sang had no desire to claim them. His purpose in coming to the Xu Ling Sect was to befriend Bing Han and learn her refining techniques; he didn't want any complications. No matter how rare the treasure, it couldn't compare to the Southern Ming Li Fire.</p><p>Returning the Fire Jade Centipede to his corpse puppet bag, Qin Sang collected his thoughts, took out a demonic banner, activated the Fire Lotus Seed within him, and began cultivating the "Fire Seed Golden Lotus" technique, refining demonic fire.</p><p>Before long, the Yan Huo Pavilion suddenly shook.</p><p>Qin Sang was startled awake, a sharp light flashing in his eyes. He rose to his feet, his gaze fixed on the mountaintop.</p><p>That fluctuation had appeared again.</p><p>Here, his perception was even sharper. The entire forbidden area trembled violently.</p><p>Qin Sang was certain that the source of the fluctuation was within the mountain!</p><p>Surprise registered on his face.  Based on his perception, the power of the fluctuation was extremely strong, indicating an even more intense source.  Even with his cultivation, if he were inside the mountain at this moment, he would need to use a magic weapon to defend himself.</p><p>"What exactly is going on in there?  Could it be the treasure the Fire Jade Centipede sensed?"</p><p>Qin Sang mused silently.</p><p>He was certain that Bing Han wasn't meditating peacefully.  The fluctuation was definitely connected to her.</p><p>Qin Sang noticed Yun Lan guarding outside, quietly observing.  Yun Lan seemed calm and unfazed by the fluctuation.</p><p>He suspected he might be overthinking, shook his head, sat cross-legged, put away the demonic banner, and summoned his Nascent Soul Puppet.</p><p>While subduing the Nascent Soul Puppet, Qin Sang also began to experience the puppet's soul shadow.</p><p>The Dao-演道 Tree was truly extraordinary.</p><p>Qin Sang merged his consciousness with the soul shadow, forgetting himself, as if he had become a different person.</p><p>This was a dangerous practice. He could be backlashed by the soul shadow and completely lost himself, yet Qin Sang had no qualms.</p><p>What he gained was not the expected residual memories of the soul shadow, but rather an indescribable understanding of the realm and the Dao that the soul shadow had possessed during its lifetime.</p><p>This understanding remained within the soul shadow's form and could be experienced by others.</p><p>Qin Sang's will was firm; he would not be swayed by another's Dao.  But this experience was greatly beneficial to him, not in terms of cultivation speed, but in overcoming bottlenecks.</p><p>The Dao is interconnected. By merging others' understandings, one's own path becomes clearer.</p><p>This process of integration was not fast, but Qin Sang wasn't short on time. Whenever he had free time, he would summon a puppet.</p><p>Over time, this accumulation would lead to a breakthrough.</p><p>By the time the Corpse Flower Blood Jasper was purified, his cultivation would likely make a giant leap forward.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, five days had passed since Qin Sang arrived at the Xu Ling Sect.</p><p>During these five days, fluctuations occurred every day.</p><p>Qin Sang had identified a pattern.  The fluctuations varied in intensity, with only one being the strongest each day, while the others were very weak. The forbidden area showed no reaction, but they couldn't escape Qin Sang's perception.</p><p>After the strongest fluctuation, everything would become calm.  Then, at the same time the next day, the fluctuations would reappear.</p><p>Day six.</p><p>The Xu Ling Sect's forbidden area.</p><p>A beam of light shot out from within the mountain, circled briefly, and then sped towards a palace.</p><p>Qin Sang, who was meditating in the Yan Huo Pavilion, immediately noticed the person, surprise in his eyes.  He rushed out of the pavilion, ignoring Yun Lan, and flew into the air.</p><p>"Eh? Daoist Friend Qin!"</p><p>A familiar voice came from the beam of light, which suddenly stopped.  It was Xiang Qing.</p><p>"What's going on, Daoist Friend Xiang?"</p><p>Qin Sang looked at Xiang Qing, secretly suspicious.</p><p>Xiang Qing appeared extremely dishevelled, his robes scorched, his breath ragged, as if he had expended a great deal of energy.</p><p>"It's a long story,"</p><p>Xiang Qing shook his head.  "Shortly after the three-realm peace talks, I returned to the Xu Ling Sect with Daoist Friend Bing Han. I've tried several times, all failing, and this time I almost suffered a backlash. I was just about to invite Daoist Friend Qin, but it seems you've already arrived."</p><p>"I've been waiting for some time!  What happened in the mountain?  Even the two of you together failed?"</p><p>Qin Sang asked in surprise.</p><p>Xiang Qing possessed the aura of the Ancestral Saint Fire, indicating he had refined a portion of it, making him even stronger than before.</p><p>Xiang Qing paused.  "Friend Qin, are you unaware of the circumstances?  Then I cannot say more. I swore an oath to Daoist Bing Han, promising not to reveal the secrets of the Xu Ling Sect to anyone. If you wish to know, you must ask Daoist Bing Han. She should be coming out soon…"</p><p>"I will explain personally to Friend Qin.  Friend Xiang, go and recover your energy. This fire poison is extraordinary; even with your Green Sun Demon Fire, you cannot let it fester for too long."</p><p>Before the words were finished, a woman in court dress flew down from the mountaintop – Bing Han.</p><p>Xiang Qing bowed slightly to Qin Sang and flew into the palace.</p><p>Bing Han appeared instantly before Qin Sang.</p><p>Though outwardly showing no signs, her weakness was undeniable. Like Xiang Qing, her true energy had been severely depleted.</p><p>"I wonder if my arrival is opportune. It seems there are important secrets of your sect involved here."</p><p>Qin Sang looked up at the mountaintop.</p><p>Bing Han smiled. "Friend Qin, you’ve arrived at the perfect time!  You've seen through our actions. The mountain's secrets are indeed vital to the Xu Ling Sect and cannot be lost. If you wish to know, please come with me."</p><p>With that, Bing Han gestured and prepared to fly towards the mountaintop.</p><p>But Qin Sang remained where he stood, motionless. "From what Friend Xiang said, this matter is no small thing. Should I also swear an oath?"</p><p>Bing Han responded seriously, "Friend Qin, if you don't mind, it would be best."</p><p>"And what will I gain in return?" Qin Sang fixed his gaze on Bing Han.</p><p>"What do you desire?"</p><p>Bing Han clearly saw that Qin Sang had his own goals.  The matter was of great importance, and she didn't want to haggle further.  She said bluntly, "The entire Xu Ling Sect will do our utmost to fulfill your request."</p><p>Qin Sang hesitated, a little amused and bewildered. He had intended to ask for help, but unexpectedly stumbled upon Bing Han and Xiang Qing's scheme, and now Bing Han was asking for *his* assistance.</p><p>This wasn't a bad thing; it would make negotiating terms easier later.</p><p>Bing Han's scheme wasn't about the ancient realm, but judging by their condition, it was undoubtedly dangerous.</p><p>"I wish to borrow all your sect's alchemic texts to study.  And if you could provide some personal guidance, that would be even better!"</p><p>When Qin Sang said "all," he deliberately emphasized the word.</p><p>"So Friend Qin wishes to learn alchemy."</p><p>Bing Han wasn't surprised. Most cultivators at the Nascent Soul stage refined their own artifacts, the ones most suited to themselves.</p><p>She breathed a sigh of relief. "Friend Qin, rest assured. Whether you succeed or not, I will open the texts to you. But you will need to swear an oath not to divulge their contents.  I trust you understand."</p>
