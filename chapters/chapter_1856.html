<h1>Chapter 1847: The Vajra Bodhi Tree</h1><p>The tremors of the Ritual Platform refused to subside, instead intensifying with each passing moment.</p><p>The vibrations spread beyond the Platform, causing the earth to tremble and the vegetation to sway.  A wave of commotion swept through the ranks of both armies, as cultivators and demon cultivators alike turned their gazes towards the source of the disturbance.</p><p>Amidst the swirling auspicious clouds, an irrepressible golden light ascended, gradually dyeing the multi-colored clouds with its brilliant hue.</p><p>Such a spectacle had occurred countless times over the past few days, but this time was clearly different.</p><p>The sheer magnitude and ferocity of the golden light were unprecedented, even leading some to wonder if the auspicious clouds shrouding the Ritual Platform would be dispersed, revealing its true form.</p><p>Everyone sensed an imminent transformation, their expressions taut with anticipation.</p><p>At the rear of both armies, where the celestial phenomena originated, the Demon Kings and Grand True Ones ascended in unison, their faces etched with solemnity as they gazed upon the Ritual Platform.</p><p>Even with their exceptional eyesight and divine abilities, they were unable to penetrate the thick veil of auspicious clouds and discern the true scene within.</p><p>The origin of these auspicious clouds remained a mystery.  They were certainly not ordinary clouds, but perhaps remnants of the ancient formations and divine powers that once graced the Ritual Platform, preserved through the ages.</p><p>They could only wait patiently outside, hoping that the Platform would not collapse.  Otherwise, it might take hundreds, even thousands of years for it to regain stability.</p><p>The cultivators and demon cultivators within the Ritual Platform had a clearer view.</p><p>The overwhelming golden light formed waves of radiant tides, sweeping across every corner.  One could faintly discern nine distinct sources within the tide, one large and eight smaller, corresponding to the nine nascent souls brought by the demon cultivators.</p><p>Following the appearance of an ancient tree, a tenth source of light emerged, resembling ten golden suns illuminating the Ritual Platform.</p><p>Moreover, the golden light emanating from the ancient tree was even more dazzling and immense than that of the nine nascent souls!</p><p>The tree's shadow swayed gently.</p><p>The ancient tree seemed to have sprung from nothingness, rising from the ground and materializing within the golden light.</p><p>All eyes were drawn to it, filled with shock, bewilderment, and avarice!</p><p>Regardless of their expressions, the demon cultivators' eyes held a hint of confusion. The tree's appearance was completely unexpected.</p><p>They had followed the Great Sage's command and successfully deployed the Nascent Soul Formation to pinpoint the approximate location of the Divine Court.</p><p>Everything had proceeded smoothly.</p><p>With the formation complete, the power of the nascent souls naturally converged towards a specific area, suggesting a high probability that the Divine Court was hidden within that region.</p><p>The Dao Court had not discerned their true intentions, acting like headless flies, their attention diverted by the constantly erupting golden light, their formation scattered.  The demon cultivators, having planned in advance, were poised to seize the initiative.</p><p>The appearance of the ancient tree was an unforeseen event.</p><p>This tree was not located within the area targeted by the Nascent Soul Formation, and therefore should have been unrelated to the Divine Court. It was likely that the golden light had impacted some illusory landscape, revealing the ancient tree that had long been hidden within, unknown to the world.</p><p>However, the commotion caused by the ancient tree was far too significant.</p><p>At this moment, every cultivator within the Ritual Platform, regardless of the layers of illusion separating them, could see the gradually solidifying tree shadow.</p><p>The ancient tree's roots were unseen, only its shadow was clearly visible.</p><p>The tree did not appear to be a mere phantom. Cultivators closer to it could see the massive trunk, the gnarled roots, the sturdy branches, the distinct veins on the leaves, and even the fruits hidden amongst the foliage.</p><p>The entire tree shimmered with gold, exuding an ancient aura that filled onlookers with awe.</p><p>It was undoubtedly an ancient tree, perhaps existing for thousands, tens of thousands of years, hidden deep within the Ritual Platform, unknown to anyone.</p><p>Its leaves resembled countless golden flakes, densely covering the entire tree like a golden umbrella, glittering brilliantly.</p><p>In contrast to the abundant foliage, the fruits on the tree were exceedingly rare.  They were oval-shaped, plump, and also golden, their surfaces marked with peculiar patterns.</p><p>The crowd was initially captivated by this extraordinary ancient tree.  Those with broader knowledge, however, found their gazes fixated on the fruits, their minds recalling ancient texts and hidden lore, their expressions gradually shifting to astonishment.</p><p>"Could this be…"</p><p>…</p><p>"A Vajra Bodhi Tree?"</p><p>Qin Sang, concealed within the flower field, could now sense the Nascent Soul Formation and see the golden ancient tree.</p><p>His eyes gleamed, completely disregarding the Formation, his attention fully captivated by the ancient tree, as memories surged within his mind.</p><p>The Vajra Bodhi Tree, a legendary spiritual root of heaven and earth, was exceedingly rare.  The tree itself possessed no remarkable qualities; its value lay in its fruits, which embodied the spiritual essence of heaven and earth and the concentrated essence of the tree itself.</p><p>The fruit of the Vajra Bodhi Tree, known as the Vajra Fruit, was ranked among the Ten Divine Woods!</p><p>"Vajra Fruit, it's actually Vajra Fruit!" Qin Sang murmured. He was familiar with the Vajra Fruit. Long ago, one had appeared in the Small Cold Region, triggering a conflict that led to the destruction of the Blood Nether Sect, a major demonic sect, by the Pure Yang Sect.</p><p>Afterwards, a Blood Nether Sect disciple had absconded with the Vajra Fruit, its whereabouts unknown.  The Pure Yang Sect searched tirelessly but to no avail. Qin Sang had also tasked Li Yufu and others to search for it during their travels in the desert, but they had found nothing.</p><p>Because of that Vajra Fruit, Qin Sang had learned about this divine wood and recognized the ancient tree at a glance.</p><p>The Vajra Fruit that had appeared in the Small Cold Region was but a single fruit, while here stood an entire Vajra Bodhi Tree!</p><p>It was said that Vajra Fruit took an extremely long time to grow and mature, and a Vajra Bodhi Tree would only bear fruit once in its lifetime, but it would not bear only a single fruit.</p><p>The moment the Vajra Fruit ripened, the tree's life force would be depleted, although this would not be immediately apparent to the naked eye.</p><p>Qin Sang widened his eyes and counted.  He could see three or four fruits with his naked eye, and considering those hidden beneath the leaves and on the other side of the tree, there were likely more than a dozen, all of them ripe!</p><p>"Hiss…"  Qin Sang's expression flickered.  He never expected to encounter Vajra Fruit here and now.</p><p>Even though Qin Sang had resolved to remain secluded, how could he remain indifferent in the face of a tree laden with Vajra Fruit?  Few in the world could maintain such composure.</p><p>Moreover, his natal spirit sword could devour spiritual wood to enhance itself, and the Ten Divine Woods were the most precious spiritual woods of all.</p><p>"Is the Dao Court and the Ghost Fang Kingdom fighting over these Vajra Fruits?"  The thought flashed through his mind.</p><p>"Something doesn't seem right…" A spark of insight ignited within Qin Sang. He recalled the Nascent Soul Formation and turned his head, narrowing his eyes as he carefully sensed the surrounding energies.</p><p>The fluctuations of the golden light, the flow of spiritual energy within the formation…</p><p>Qin Sang could only perceive these things vaguely, but he could ascertain that the spiritual energy of the formation was converging on a different area, seemingly unrelated to the Vajra Bodhi Tree.  The two seemed to have little connection.</p><p>Although he was unsure of the Nascent Soul Formation's purpose, Qin Sang could make some educated guesses.</p><p>"If the Dao Court and the Ghost Fang Kingdom are using this formation to search for something, they should have directly targeted the Vajra Bodhi Tree. Why is the spiritual energy deviating?  Could it be an accident?" Qin Sang pondered.</p><p>There was another reason. Qin Sang didn't believe that a few Vajra Fruits were worth such a large-scale mobilization of forces by the Dao Court and the Ghost Fang Kingdom.</p><p>He believed that with the resources of the Dao Court and the Ghost Fang Kingdom, they certainly wouldn't lack treasures comparable to Vajra Fruit.</p><p>The Ten Divine Woods, despite their fame, were merely ten types of spiritual wood.</p><p>Since arriving in this realm, Qin Sang had sought guidance on refining techniques from Master Qi and Master Gu, diligently collecting refining manuals and gaining considerable knowledge.</p><p>At the same time, he had always been attentive to various spiritual woods, discovering that this realm also had its own concept of the Ten Divine Woods.</p><p>In an ancient text, Qin Sang had encountered the speculations of an unnamed predecessor.</p><p>This predecessor believed that being listed among the Ten Divine Woods did not necessarily mean that these ten types of spiritual wood were the most precious in existence.</p><p>The world was vast, and spiritual woods were as numerous as the stars in the sky. Why were only these ten chosen?</p><p>The names of spiritual woods were given by cultivators, and so were their rankings.</p><p>For ten specific spiritual woods to be selected and widely recognized, there must be a reason.</p><p>Firstly, the spiritual wood must be rare; rarity equated to value.</p><p>Secondly, the spiritual wood itself must be extraordinary, possessing unique divine abilities or properties, such as the Soul Nurturing Wood.</p><p>The White Soul Nurturing Wood allowed fragmented souls to endure for countless years, awaiting rebirth.</p><p>Alternatively, there might be a widely circulated story associated with the spiritual wood, a tale that captivated people's imaginations and contributed to its renown.</p><p>The story could be a great calamity, a tumultuous love-hate entanglement, or even the forging of a world-shaking treasure using the spiritual wood, thus spreading its fame.</p><p>This predecessor cited an example: the Clear Fortune True Bamboo, the true form of Wandering Cloud.</p><p>The book mentioned a legendary divine seal called the Clear Fortune True God Seal.  According to records, this seal was one of the supreme treasures of the Daoist divine path, imbued with boundless power.</p><p>The name of the Clear Fortune True God Seal coincided perfectly with that of the Clear Fortune True Bamboo.  Legend had it that the seal was forged from an entire Clear Fortune True Bamboo.</p><p>The Daoists would not name such a supreme treasure lightly.</p><p>He speculated that the name of the Clear Fortune True Bamboo was related to the divine seal, perhaps even deriving its name from the seal, thereby ascending to the ranks of the Ten Divine Woods.</p><p>The veracity of legends was difficult to determine, and the divine seal itself was lost to time, but it sufficed to illustrate a point.</p><p>Because of the accounts in this book, Qin Sang grew increasingly suspicious of this realm's origins.</p><p>A divine wood named after a Dao Court treasure, yet its fame spread to other small realms, was certainly not something a small, isolated force could achieve.</p><p>This realm, the Dao Court, held too many secrets!</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang lacked the time to delve into these mysteries.  He was weighing the consequences of participating in the struggle for the Vajra Fruit.</p><p>Unless the Dao Court and the Ghost Fang Kingdom needed the Vajra Fruit to refine some specific treasure, they wouldn't mobilize such a large force for just a few fruits.</p><p>If their target wasn't the Vajra Bodhi Tree, then there would be no problem.</p><p>The Nascent Soul Formation and the Vajra Bodhi Tree appeared almost simultaneously.  They wouldn't neglect their true objective and delay their grand scheme, at most dispatching a small contingent to compete for the Vajra Fruit.</p><p>Qin Sang's chances were not slim.</p><p>Even if they were indeed after the Vajra Fruit, Qin Sang could fish in troubled waters while they fought.</p><p>As long as he wasn't greedy, snatching one or two Vajra Fruits and retreating, he shouldn't attract relentless pursuit.</p><p>He weighed the pros and cons in an instant.</p><p>Qin Sang deemed it feasible. He swept his gaze over the flower field and made a decisive move!</p><p>The foundation of the White Bone Earth was stable, the flower field showed no signs of imminent collapse, and he had no worries.</p><p>If there were only one Vajra Fruit, Qin Sang would still hesitate.  In this situation, he would never forgive himself for missing such an opportunity.</p><p>Just as this thought crossed his mind, another change occurred.</p><p>As the Vajra Bodhi Tree solidified, finally revealing itself completely to everyone present, resembling a towering ancient tree growing within the Ritual Platform, just as everyone attempted to discern whether it was real or an illusion, the outer leaves of the tree began to shimmer with golden light, like golden flames, igniting the entire tree in an instant.</p><p>The Nascent Soul Formation, having reached its peak, began to wane.</p><p>The ancient tree blazed with light, completely overshadowing the Nascent Soul Formation.</p><p>The entire tree seemed to be burning, the flames spreading to its roots.  As the flames spread, the tree once more became illusory.</p><p>Whether it was being reduced to ashes or simply fading back into concealment, the tree's shadow grew increasingly faint.</p><p>Once the tree vanished, finding it again would be incredibly difficult, unless the Great Sage intervened and refined another Nascent Soul Formation.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression shifted slightly. He dared not delay. He leaped out of the flower field space, swiftly executing a series of hand seals, completely sealing the flower field formation.</p><p>Glancing at the fading tree shadow, Qin Sang activated his Thunder Escape technique and plunged resolutely into the still unstable illusory landscape.</p><p>Even if no one obtained the Vajra Fruit, Qin Sang would at least locate the area where the tree grew before it vanished, so he could search for it later.</p><p>Unlike Qin Sang, the other cultivators and demon cultivators within the Ritual Platform, glancing at the fading tree shadow and then at the area indicated by the Nascent Soul Formation's spiritual energy – the two locations seemingly not too far apart – were faced with a difficult decision.</p><p>The Vajra Fruit was precious, and a tree full of them was incredibly tempting, but they bore a more important mission, one that concerned their very survival.</p><p>In the eyes of most Demon Kings and Grand True Ones, the Vajra Fruit was merely a worldly possession, insignificant compared to the Divine Court.</p><p>Ruo Quan Zhenren and his companions recognized the Vajra Fruit.</p><p>The True One who cultivated the Golden Seal Altar and crafted the Jade Bamboo Staff stared at the ancient tree, unable to tear his eyes away. He cultivated the Golden Seal Altar, and its construction required wood-attribute spiritual materials, preferably spiritual wood. This was the first time in his life he had encountered one of the Ten Divine Woods.</p><p>"Do not be deceived by the demons' tricks!" Ruo Quan Zhenren snapped, glancing pointedly at the True One.</p><p>The True One was jolted as if struck by a thunderclap, his mind clearing, awakening from his greed.</p><p>The Vajra Fruit might not be real, it could be a demonic trap to sow discord and distract them.</p><p>The True One took a deep breath, resolutely averting his gaze.  Seeing Ruo Quan Zhenren and the others moving further away, he hastened to catch up.</p><p>Elsewhere, Wan Zhenren and his companions were also drawn to the Vajra Bodhi Tree, mainly out of admiration for the rare treasure, but not with the same urgency as the previous True One.</p><p>The old Daoist flicked his dust whisk, chuckling. "We can search for that spiritual tree after the main task is complete. Then, this poor Daoist will accompany you all.  If we obtain any Vajra Fruit, I will give them all to you."</p><p>Pausing, the old Daoist glanced towards the ancient tree, his eyes filled with meaning.  "There should be other fellow Daoists in that direction.  Perhaps we will pass by the spiritual tree on our way to meet them. We can pluck a few fruits then. If there's any surplus, and any of you urgently need it, this poor Daoist can shamelessly request one or two for you."</p><p>Upon hearing this, even Wan Zhenren's eyes lit up. They bowed their thanks, their minds at ease.</p><p>The old Daoist nodded with a smile, pointing his dust whisk towards the area where the Nascent Soul Formation's spiritual energy converged. "The main task is paramount. Fellow Daoists, do not be distracted.  Once we succeed, the Dao Court's rewards will surely surpass the Vajra Fruit."</p><p>"As you command!"</p><p>The True Ones' morale soared. They no longer paid attention to the ancient tree, following the old Daoist as they flew away.</p><p>Similar scenes unfolded in other locations.</p><p>Whether Daoist True Ones or Demon Kings and Marquises, the vast majority would not be swayed by the Vajra Fruit.</p><p>Having reached their level of cultivation, they were all deeply versed in weighing the pros and cons, and would not sacrifice the greater good for minor gains.</p><p>However, there were always exceptions.</p><p>Especially those closer to the ancient tree's location.  A slight change in their course would allow them to obtain the legendary Ten Divine Wood without much delay. Why not seize the opportunity? (End of Chapter)</p>
