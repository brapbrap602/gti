<h1>Chapter 998: Nascent Soul Late Stage</h1><p>After testing his physical changes in the uncharted waters, Qin Sang returned to his cave dwelling and continued his cultivation.</p><p>Seasons came and went.</p><p>Qin Sang had been in the Heavenly Dao Sect market town for eight years.</p><p>In other words, less than a year remained until his meeting with Yuan Zhu.</p><p>Except for occasional outings and discussions with fellow cultivators, Qin Sang had mostly been in seclusion, diligently cultivating.  Building on his previous foundation, Qin Sang focused on inscribing killing talismans and refining his true essence, steadily improving his cultivation.</p><p>Now, the first killing talisman created by Senior Qingzhu was nearing completion.</p><p>Qin Sang had been in seclusion for several months.</p><p>He inspected his inner self, confirming there were no abnormalities.</p><p>The killing talismans on the Spirit Sword were also very stable.</p><p>Qin Sang took a deep breath, his mind sinking into his Purple Mansion, inscribing the final stroke on the Blackwood Sword!</p><p>…</p><p>A month later.</p><p>Qin Sang emerged from seclusion, quickly walking towards the city gates, then activating his escape technique, flying to another uncharted sea area.</p><p>His aura manifested, clearly revealing him to be at the Nascent Soul Late Stage!</p><p>Before joining the Seven Killing Hall, Qin Sang was already at the Nascent Soul Mid-Stage, only now breaking through again.</p><p>"The absence of bottlenecks feels quite good."</p><p>Qin Sang smiled, summoning the Blackwood Sword.</p><p>He had focused on improving his cultivation and hadn't further refined the Blackwood Sword with Soul-Nourishing Wood, remaining a high-grade magic treasure.</p><p>Once everything was settled, he would find a safe cave dwelling and continue to enhance the Blackwood Sword.  Using the remaining Soul-Nourishing Wood to upgrade it to a top-grade magic treasure wouldn't be difficult.</p><p>However, as far as Qin Sang knew, simply relying on materials wouldn't be enough to make the Blackwood Sword advance to a spiritual treasure.</p><p>He had befriended several cultivators skilled in refining, and during their discussions, learned some secrets.</p><p>The key to a spiritual treasure lies in the word "spiritual"!</p><p>Not a spirit, but spirituality.</p><p>In ancient times, treasures that had given birth to spirits were considered supreme treasures.</p><p>Before giving birth to a spirit, imbuing a magic treasure with a hint of spirituality is an essential step.</p><p>However, nobody knew how to imbue a magic treasure with spirituality, not even these refiners.</p><p>A refiner surnamed Guo seemed to remember something and said, "It is said that a cultivator's life-bound magic treasure, cultivated alongside their life force, is more likely to develop spirituality than ordinary magic treasures. This is one of the benefits of a life-bound treasure..."</p><p>The group discussed animatedly, without reaching a conclusion.</p><p>Someone self-deprecatingly said, "With our cultivation levels, we can't even guarantee success in refining low-grade magic treasures. We shouldn't be so ambitious. Spiritual treasures are far beyond our reach; we haven't even heard of one appearing. In the entire cultivation world, there might not be a single spiritual treasure…"</p><p>Another person objected, turning to a white-haired elder nearby, expectantly asking, "Daoist Wu comes from the Heavenly Dao Sect, surely you know many untold secrets. Could you reveal a thing or two?"</p><p>The white-haired elder was indeed a cultivator from the Heavenly Dao Sect.</p><p>The reason everyone was gathered here was thanks to the white-haired elder.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the elder sighed bitterly, "I've been transferred to the market town, how much can I possibly know? My understanding of spiritual treasures is no greater than yours. However, I also agree with your guess, simply because our cultivation is too low to be in contact with that level…"</p><p>The cultivator surnamed Guo chuckled, interrupting, "I only said that life-bound magic treasures are more likely to develop spirituality than ordinary ones, but I didn't say it was *easy*…Fellow cultivators, consider the difference between high-grade magic artifacts and magic treasures.  The difference in materials and power between high-grade magic treasures and spiritual treasures must be immense, too."</p><p>Listening to their discussion, Qin Sang pondered.</p><p>The Eighteen Demon Banners were special. Each banner individually was only equivalent to a low-grade magic treasure in quality, and the banners' power came from demonic fire, making the possibility of developing spirituality extremely low. He could only place his hopes on the Blackwood Sword.</p><p>The Blackwood Sword had been refined with Soul-Nourishing Wood, so the material of the sword body was not a concern.</p><p>He just didn't know how to make it develop spirituality and advance to a spiritual treasure.</p><p>However, two high-grade magic treasures would be enough to make him invincible after forming the Nascent Soul, and he had plenty of time to come. No need to rush.</p><p>Remembering this, Qin Sang subconsciously stroked the Spirit Sword, feeling its smooth surface.</p><p>"Sword Wheel!"</p><p>Qin Sang shouted, the Sword Wheel reappearing.</p><p>Previously, he had focused on cultivation and hadn't thoroughly understood the Sword Dao. Once he comprehended what he had learned on the Sword Path, the Sword Wheel would undoubtedly take on a new form.</p><p>After testing the power of the Sword Wheel, Qin Sang put away the Blackwood Sword, summoned talismans, and activated the Sky Demon Transformation divine ability.</p><p>The most important thing was escape techniques.</p><p>At the Nascent Soul Late Stage, he could unleash the full power of the Nine Dragon Heavenly Chariot Talisman.</p><p>The *Sky Demon Refining Form* had also advanced.</p><p>Sword energy surrounded him, inseparable from the shadow of a dragon.</p><p>Qin Sang looked down for a moment, then his wings flapped, and his figure vanished instantly.</p><p>The next moment, with a sound like thunder, a lightning bolt appeared out of thin air.</p><p>*BOOM…*</p><p>Thunder roared.</p><p>Qin Sang, on a whim, flew continuously.</p><p>After a long while, he finally stopped and withdrew his escape technique.</p><p>By then, he was far from the previous sea area.</p><p>Qin Sang slowly exhaled, frowning in recollection.</p><p>In terms of speed alone, he far surpassed his escape abilities ten years ago when pursued by Mou Laomo.</p><p>Among Golden Core cultivators, it would be difficult to find anyone whose escape techniques could rival his.  Many are proficient in one escape technique, but mastering three top-tier ones like him is exceptionally rare.</p><p>He could easily toy with cultivators of the same level.</p><p>But compared to Nascent Soul cultivators, Qin Sang couldn't say for sure;  it's a significant difference in realm after all.</p><p>After testing his treasures and abilities, Qin Sang returned to his cave abode to stabilize his cultivation.</p><p>Soon, he would travel to the Storm Belt to meet Yuan Zhu.</p><p>Before that, Qin Sang decided to pay a visit to Heaven's Dao Sect.</p><p>Over the years, he'd not only made contact with the sect's Golden Core disciples, but also learned a great deal about the sect's Nascent Soul masters.</p><p>Some of these masters were involved in external affairs, while others were highly secretive, secluded in deep cultivation.</p><p>None of those he'd learned about matched the description of the Ning surname sword cultivator.</p><p>Months later, Qin Sang left seclusion, activating the restrictions of the white cave abode.</p><p>This time, Bai wouldn't accompany him.</p><p>The cave door opened, and Qin Sang went inside, finding that Bai still emanated corpse qi, but his expression was livelier than before.</p><p>While Qin Sang occasionally went out, Bai remained in seclusion, experimenting.</p><p>Finally, the primordial life force within him gradually stabilized.</p><p>Qin Sang said with relief, "Friend Daoist, you look much better.  The corpse qi shouldn't be a major threat for now, should it?"</p><p>Bai nodded, but showed little joy.  "This isn't enough. With only Golden Core strength, I can't accomplish much in the cultivation world. Unfortunately, I dare not rashly attempt to become a Corpse King."</p>
