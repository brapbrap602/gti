**272: Destruction**

Two or three years.

Qin Sang nodded slightly. With that much time, he could weigh his decision carefully.

Most importantly, he could restore the Nine Dragons Heavenly Chariot Amulet and increase his safety.

As he spoke, the Spirit Bamboo Flying Boat sped through the underground. Suddenly, Cloud Wanderer’s eyes lit up and he pointed ahead.

“Brother Qin, look over there!”

Qin Sang followed his finger and saw a tiny crack on the circular seal in the direction Cloud Wanderer pointed. It extended into a tributary ahead.

They were still far away from the stone tablet, but it was clear that the fragile point in the circular seal wasn’t unique to the trial space. They had stumbled upon one fortunately.

As the strange noise began, the earthquake became increasingly violent, and the circular seal was impacted more and more. It was normal for a crack to first appear at its most vulnerable point.

They might not have been able to find the trial space, but having now found a fragile point, they couldn’t miss it. Without needing to be told, Qin Sang understood Cloud Wanderer’s meaning. He immediately turned the Spirit Bamboo Flying Boat’s direction and followed the crack into the lava tributary.

He tracked the crack with his gaze until he finally found the end of the crack.

At the end of the tiny, thin crack was a gap the size of a thumbnail. The circular seal there was shimmering brightly and trying to fix itself, but the constant tremors made it unstable and not only prevented the seal from recovering, but also made the gap larger.

Over the gap, a crack had been torn into the ground by the quake.

Qin Sang and Cloud Wanderer exchanged glances and said in unison:

“We can try!”

The Fire Spirit Beast was in pursuit, and they didn’t have time to wait for the gap to break apart by itself. When they were about to reach the gap, both of them acted at the same time.

The Ebony Sword flew out of Qin Sang’s forehead and the Sword Energy formed a circle, then quickly converged into the sword body.

Cloud Wanderer took out a bright, green pearl. It was about the size of a longan and crystal clear. The inside of the pearl had alternating wind and thunder and light and darkness. It was as if a small world was evolving inside the pearl.

When the pearl appeared, Qin Sang actually felt a strange sense of pressure. He couldn’t help but feel inwardly alarmed.

He’d only felt such pressure from Dharma treasure-class items like the Jade Octave and Eight Trigrams Saber Amulet. This pearl was surprisingly similar to them, but the pressure was much smaller; it was far from being comparable to a Dharma treasure.

However, this was more than enough to prove that the pearl was extraordinary; it was definitely the very best among supreme-grade magical artifacts. To the naked eye, it was on par with the Ten Directions Yama Banner.

It seemed that while Cloud Wanderer had been traveling for many years, he had indeed had some good fortune, even if he hadn’t cured his hidden injury.

The Spirit Bamboo Flying Boat and this pearl were both extraordinary.

“Go!”

Cloud Wanderer gave a low roar. The pearl dragged a green light and ferociously crashed into the gap.

Qin Sang didn’t want to be outdone, so he immediately urged the Ebony Sword to rush into the circular seal together with the pearl.

As Qin Sang had expected, the pearl’s power was indeed on par with the Ten Directions Yama Banner. It was even better than the Ebony Sword.

*Boom!*

The seal at the gap was momentarily stunned from being attacked by the pearl and the Ebony Sword at the same time.

The time was short, but it was enough.

The Spirit Bamboo Flying Boat turned into a ray of light and passed through the gap in the blink of an eye. The Fire Spirit Beast, chasing closely behind, lost Qin Sang and the other’s aura and gradually calmed down.

The crack in the ground could let people through, so the two collected their magical artifacts and flew up.

“That’s a good treasure!”

Qin Sang glanced at the pearl with a strange look in his eye and complimented it.

Cloud Wanderer’s face was pale as he said with a bitter smile, “This Flawless Pearl is indeed this old Daoist’s greatest reliance, but it takes up too much energy. It’s like a beast that devours spiritual energy. Every time I use it, it can suck my Dantian dry. It’s really not as useful as Brother Qin’s Ebony Sword.”

…

They had finally escaped.

As soon as Qin Sang flew out of the ground, the scene before him made him jump in fright.

They were in the southwest of the stone tablet and about equidistant from the stone tablet and Heavenly Peak. They could see the eye-catching stone tablet in the distance.

The air was filled with a pungent smell.

The sky to the west had completely changed color, turning blood red.

The ground had cracked open and lava shot out of the ground like rain, spewing into the sky before fading away.

The flame-like seal had been torn to pieces. Under the seal, countless peaks had toppled and collapsed, breaking into pieces with the ground. They were then surrounded by endless lava, becoming isolated islands.

One could clearly see countless Fire Spirit Beasts swimming around in the lava. It seemed like the ancient cultivator’s ruins were about to become the domain of the Fire Spirit Beasts.

To Qin Sang’s astonishment, the four heaven peaks began to tilt, and two of them even collided with each other, causing half of them to collapse.
Qin Sang recalled the trembling sensation he had felt at the beginning. He looked towards the heaven peak that Si Kong Muyue had come from, and wondered if that was the source of the changes.
Qin Sang noticed that the ancient cultivator ruins’ space seemed to be collapsing. Bare eyes could see some black lines appear around the collapsed heaven peak. They extended across the void. Some of them stretched for hundreds of feet. The Fire Spirit Beasts and magma collided with the black lines and disappeared into thin air.
They were incredibly similar to the legendary space cracks!
Qin Sang gasped. Even the war waged between the Daoist of the Earthly Lack and the Daoist of Xuan Universe had not been able to shake those totem restrictions in the slightest. However, the ancient cultivator ruins, which had existed for so long, were suddenly going to be destroyed.
Had this place been on the verge of collapse to begin with, and had they become the final straw that broke the camel’s back?
“Junior Brother Qin, we must leave quickly to avoid being caught in this,” said You Yunzi. His composure was much better than Qin Sang’s. He pointed at the ground in the distance and said as a reminder.
The cracks in the ground were spreading outwards at a speed visible to the naked eye. Sometimes, the ground could be seen arching high up, before being entirely lifted up. Magma and the Fire Spirit Beasts immediately rushed out from underground, and the magma submerged the land.
The vegetation that was struggling to survive met its true end.
At this time, everyone was moving towards the stone tablet at the exit.
There were several silhouettes suspended near the stone tablet. They had arrived earlier and were observing the situation.
In the west, there was a ray of light galloping as some escaped. Some were fast and others were slow, but fortunately the Fire Spirit Beasts that had rushed out from the ground were not too many yet. Even those who were at the back did not need to worry about being discovered.
Qin Sang hesitated and said, “Senior, please go ahead. I still have a small matter to attend to.”
“Junior Brother Qin, be careful. The speed at which the restrictions are collapsing will definitely increase,” You Yunzi did not ask much and reminded Qin Sang before controlling the spirit bamboo flying boat to fly towards the stone tablet.
After seeing You Yunzi’s silhouette disappear, Qin Sang thought silently for a while before his figure flashed. However, he went against the tide and moved westwards for a while before hiding in the path that people must pass through as they escaped towards the stone tablet.
Rays of light flickered past from above, as magma and the Fire Spirit Beasts neared.
Qin Sang remained motionless.
Only until the final ray of light flew past did he fail to see Ren Hong.
Only then did Qin Sang start moving.
