<h1>Chapter 1282:  Overconfidence</h1><p>Figures surged through the gaps torn in the barrier by the wind pillars.</p><p>On the battlefield, Qing Jun and other cultivators manipulating the formation remained motionless, still concentrating their efforts on attacking the Sky Lake and manipulating space.  The cultivators of the Two Realms Alliance could be described as pouring in.</p><p>Though seemingly chaotic, the incoming cultivators maintained their formations and order.  Seasoned by countless battles, everyone understood that disorder on the battlefield meant death.</p><p>Qin Sang, holding a wooden tablet in one hand and a kirin hairpin in the other, drifted into the Sky Lake.</p><p>Through the torn water, the true form of Double Mirror Mountain was faintly visible.  The mountain was covered in snow, the Cui Yuan cultivators stood in tight formation, their expressions grave.  At the sight of the enemy, they descended with war cries, their magical treasures shining.</p><p>The breaches in the Sky Lake were uneven, forcing the creation of smaller, individual battlefields.  Water and mist mingled, both sides utilizing the power of their formations to slaughter their opponents; thunder and fire filled the sky, various attacks flashing.</p><p>Both sides were prepared, each using their own methods to evade or withstand attacks…</p><p>Amidst this scene, all fought.</p><p>Qin Sang weaved between the formations, deploying the kirin hairpin.  He showed no mercy, regardless of whether his opponent was a Golden Core or Foundation Establishment cultivator.</p><p>Following Madam Luo’s custom, Qin Sang activated the hairpin, suspending it before his chest.  At times, it shot out several hairpin-like projectiles like sharp swords; at other times, it transformed into a kirin, viciously charging at opponents and striking fear into their hearts.</p><p>He silently observed his surroundings, waiting for the enemy to approach.</p><p>After reaping several lives, Qin Sang sensed something, her brows furrowed. She turned towards another battlefield, pausing before moving silently towards it.</p><p>In that direction, several Two Realms Alliance squads were performing exceptionally well.  These squads included not only Golden Core cultivators but also demon core-stage beasts, wreaking havoc among the enemy ranks, driving them into disarray.</p><p>These were Li Yu Fu, Mei Gu, Fat Chicken, and others.</p><p>Since the great battle had begun, no one could remain untouched. Qin Sang had intentionally allowed them to hone their skills, ordering them to lead their respective squads and group together for mutual support.</p><p>Qin Sang knew the consequences of being a target, but these younger cultivators seemed to have missed this point.</p><p>The most flamboyant among them was none other than Fat Chicken.</p><p>Recently, Fat Chicken had been elated, having successfully broken through to the late Transformation stage, avenged his仇人, and rescued his birth mother.  His mood was exceptionally buoyant.</p><p>Jing Yu was on her way but wouldn't make it in time for this battle.  However, before leaving, she had given Fat Chicken several protective treasures.</p><p>Fat Chicken possessed powerful bloodline, already among the top cultivators and beasts of his level.  Now, even more powerful, he was virtually invincible and displaying remarkable prowess.</p><p>Engrossed in the slaughter, Fat Chicken and his companions, White Crane, shouted and cheered.  Even Yue’er couldn't suppress her excitement.</p><p>Li Yu Fu and the others, while maintaining composure, couldn't keep up with Fat Chicken’s speed, desperately trying to dissuade him.</p><p>Then, several Cui Yuan squads charged towards them, their momentum ferocious, clearly aiming for them.  Retreat was no longer possible; they had to fight.</p><p>"Go!"</p><p>Fat Chicken summoned the Thunder Bead, overly confident, and gracefully spread his wings, advancing with imposing majesty.  White Crane, delighting in the chaos, cheered loudly, even Yue’er unable to remain still.</p><p>A thunderous falcon formed from lightning charged directly into the enemy formation, followed by the attacks of Li Yu Fu and the others.</p><p>The Cui Yuan cultivators felt threatened, their expressions changing as they huddled together, activating the formation's protective power and unleashing their own treasures to defend.</p><p>"Boom!"</p><p>The thunder falcon exploded upon impact.</p><p>The Thunder Bead, reforged by Jing Yu and given to Fat Chicken, was far superior to its previous version; coupled with Fat Chicken's outstanding strength, its power was extraordinary.</p><p>Amidst the blinding light, countless electric snakes scattered, accompanied by cries of shock and screams.</p><p>Fat Chicken cackled, bathed in thunder, leading his team into the fray.</p><p>Unfortunately, the Cui Yuan cultivators were not so easily defeated. They had already witnessed Fat Chicken's performance and were prepared.  While appearing severely wounded, their injuries were actually minor, and they quickly launched a counterattack.</p><p>Fat Chicken and the others suddenly saw darkness before them as earth-bamboo shoots appeared, their sharp points aimed at them, and they were fired upon.</p><p>The group was startled and quickly stopped their flight, unleashing their own treasures to bombard the earth-bamboo shoots.</p><p>"Bang! Bang! Bang!"</p><p>The earth-bamboo shoots shattered, scattering debris.</p><p>Cultivators from the Abyss seized the opportunity to rearrange their formation and attacked.  Several burning gazes fixed on the Lei Nianzhu, clearly coveting the treasure.</p><p>Pang Ji roared, smashing a soil sprout with a swipe of his claw, and ordered an immediate assault.</p><p>High-ranking cultivators from the Abyss exchanged a glance, subtly shifting their formation to engage Pang Ji's forces.</p><p>For a time, a chaotic melee ensued, vibrant lights flashing as both sides clashed.</p><p>Pang Ji consistently failed to gain the upper hand. The Abyss constantly kept several people focused on him, severely restricting his movements.  His mind gradually calmed, finally realizing that even with his strength, he couldn't act with the same impunity as a transformed great demon.</p><p>Just as the calmer Pang Ji prepared to make amends, a frantic shout echoed from behind him.</p><p>"Junior Sister, watch out!"  Li Yu Fu cried.</p><p>His junior sister was Mei Gu, Qin Sang's newly-accepted disciple.</p><p>Li Yu Fu cared for the Green Sheep Temple even more than Qin Sang. Mei Gu was the second cultivator in the Temple to reach the Core Formation stage, after him, and they were very close.</p><p>In the chaos, their formation had unknowingly been torn apart, leaving Mei Gu isolated.</p><p>At that moment, a twisted, sickening shadow erupted from the ground, lunging towards Mei Gu.</p><p>Having fought the Abyss for so long, everyone immediately recognized it as a creature manifested by the Dark Crystal Tower – someone was secretly using it to hunt!</p><p>At this point, the Nascent Soul cultivators in the Shuangjing Mountain camp were not outnumbered by the Two Realms Alliance, yet each Nascent Soul cultivator bore immense responsibility and pressure.</p><p>Facing the Two Realms Alliance, they could hardly spare attention for the battlefield of lower-level cultivators. Yet, when they did intervene, they revealed their bloodthirsty fangs!</p><p>Panic spread, and reinforcements rushed to Mei Gu’s aid. But the Abyss cultivators had been waiting for this, refusing to let them easily rescue her, launching a frenzied counterattack.</p><p>Mei Gu, leading a sect and having gained experience through countless battles, possessed even more experience than Pang Ji and Li Yu Fu.  Showing no panic upon finding herself alone, she launched her Seven Suns Ruler at the monster, then summoned a treasure mirror before her, blasting a white light at the creature.</p><p>But these two attacks failed to kill the monster.</p><p>She bought herself precious time, while Pang Ji and Li Yu Fu fought off their opponents.  Just then, a streak of light hurtled towards them – a fierce Kirin beast, which swiftly tore the monster to shreds.</p><p>A collective gasp of relief swept through the cultivators.  Looking up, they saw a graceful woman descending.</p><p>—</p><p>—</p><p>I'm currently adjusting my sleep schedule.  Due to disrupted circadian rhythms, things have been very difficult.</p><p>I've found that waking up early is better than staying up late. I'm forcing myself to sleep before midnight, writing whatever I can't finish in the early morning.  Therefore, my update times will be erratic, but I guarantee a daily update.</p><p>Please bear with me for a while. I'm already seeing some improvement, and I'm confident I can conquer this biological clock!</p>
