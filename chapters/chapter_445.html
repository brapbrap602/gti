<h1>Chapter 438: Conscription</h1><p>The Ghost Roc Cloud sped silently across the water's surface.</p><p>The Herb Garden was in sight.</p><p>Qin Sang and Mu Yifeng concealed their presence and deactivated the garden's protective formation.</p><p>Upon entering, they discovered Jie Ying and the others hadn't started closed-door cultivation. They were gathered outside, anxiously staring beyond the formation.  Seeing Qin Sang, they were visibly relieved.</p><p>"This is our fellow disciple, Senior Brother Mu..."</p><p>Qin Sang introduced Mu Yifeng.</p><p>Jie Ying bowed to Mu Yifeng, then turned anxiously to Qin Sang, asking repeatedly, "Senior Brother Qin, did you notice anything unusual outside?"</p><p>Qin Sang nodded and asked in return, "What have you discovered?"</p><p>Jie Ying's face was filled with worry. "Just a while ago, several cultivators flew past overhead, hurrying north. It's never been this frequent before. Later, two patrol squads flew south together. Their flight was incredibly urgent. Something must have happened in the south! Could it be... a war is about to break out?"</p><p>"Patrol squads heading south? It seems someone has already reported back. Stargazer Island has received the news."</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at Mu Yifeng.</p><p>On their way back, they also saw many cultivators fleeing north, but no patrol squads.</p><p>Mu Yifeng forced a smile. "I'm registered with Stargazer Island; I have no choice. Even if they already know about the enemy, I must return and report what I know, awaiting their orders. However, my injuries are severe, my magical tools are heavily damaged, and my combat strength is greatly reduced. I shouldn't be assigned any missions in the short term. Junior Brother Qin, you don't need to get involved in this mess. We'll stick to our original plan. You can drop me off near Stargazer Island, and then you can leave..."</p><p>Qin Sang gave a noncommittal "Mmm."</p><p>The "Soul Nourishing Sword Scripture" required combat experience and comprehension of killing talismans, but only under the premise of ensuring his own safety.</p><p>Now, at the very beginning of the war, the situation was unclear, and it was the most chaotic time. The best choice was to leave this place, avoid the turmoil, and wait for things to stabilize before making a decision.</p><p>"Junior Brother Jie, you must immediately harvest the ripe spiritual herbs, seal the formation, and leave this place with me."</p><p>Jie Ying and the others were overjoyed. They immediately followed Qin Sang's orders, each performing their assigned tasks. Soon, they had harvested all the ripe spiritual herbs, packed them into storage pouches, and handed them over to Qin Sang.</p><p>"Let's go!"</p><p>Qin Sang waved his hand, sealing the Herb Garden's formation. Then, he summoned the Ghost Roc Cloud, its vapor enveloping everyone.</p><p>Including Mu Yifeng, the Ghost Roc Cloud carried fourteen people.</p><p>The Qi Refinement stage disciples' cultivation levels were too low, so Qin Sang had to carry them. This slowed down the Ghost Roc Cloud considerably.</p><p>Along the way, they saw two cultivators fleeing north, just like them, but they didn't recognize them and chose not to interfere.</p><p>Nothing happened along the way, and they were nearing the agreed-upon location.</p><p>Just then, Qin Sang and the others were startled by a thunderous roar.</p><p>This was... the sound of cultivators flying!</p><p>Qin Sang and Mu Yifeng exchanged glances, their expressions changing slightly. They abruptly stood up, flew out of the Ghost Roc Cloud, concealed themselves, and ascended to a higher altitude. Witnessing the astonishing scene in the north, they couldn't help but gasp.</p><p>More than twenty streaks of light were rapidly approaching from the north.</p><p>Flying swords, treasure ships, spirit boats, flying shuttles, flying needlesâ€¦</p><p>All kinds of flying artifacts, dazzling and diverse.</p><p>It was like a grand exhibition of flying artifacts.</p><p>They flew recklessly in the sky, their multicolored lights interweaving, creating a magnificent spectacle as they sped southward, approaching Qin Sang's location.</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang didn't hesitate. He immediately turned back to the Ghost Roc Cloud, controlling it to plunge downwards into the water.</p><p>Jie Ying and the others didn't know what had happened. Seeing Qin Sang's grave expression, they felt uneasy and stayed put within the cloud, afraid to move.</p><p>Unexpectedly, just as they descended a few meters underwater, everyone suddenly heard a cold snort, seemingly right next to their ears.</p><p>"Get out!"</p><p>Qin Sang felt a buzzing in his head. His body trembled violently, and his spiritual power almost dissipated. The Ghost Roc Cloud spiraled out of control, scattering explosively.</p><p>Then, an immense suction force came from above.</p><p>A water spout engulfed everyone, pulling them out of the water.</p><p>*Splash!*</p><p>The water spout burst, and Qin Sang and the others plummeted back down like dumplings, landing awkwardly in the water. Looking up, they saw a figure materialize above them, as if stepping out of thin air.</p><p>This person looked only in his early twenties, with unremarkable features. However, he possessed an aura of authority that others lacked. Simply standing there, he became the focal point of the world, impossible to ignore.</p><p>Especially his eyes, sharp and piercing, seeming to see through people's hearts.</p><p>Sensing the faint but profound aura emanating from this person,</p><p>Qin Sang's heart tightened. Ignoring his soaked clothes, he quickly stood up and bowed, about to introduce himself. However, Mu Yifeng was faster. He knelt on one knee before the figure. "Disciple of Lesser Hua Mountain, Patrol Guard Mu Yifeng, greets Vice Island Master Xiao!"</p><p>Vice Island Master Xiao!</p><p>Could this be the Island Master of Stargazer Island?</p><p>Qin Sang, quick-witted, followed Mu Yifeng's lead. "Disciple of Lesser Hua Mountain, Qin Sang, greets Vice Island Master Xiao!"</p><p>"All from Lesser Hua Mountain?"</p><p>Vice Island Master Xiao's gaze swept over them.</p><p>Qin Sang felt the man's gaze like two sharp swords, his body tensing up. He dared not move.</p><p>From the corner of his eye, he noticed the approaching streaks of light from the north. Two of them looked familiar. He suddenly recalled the two cultivators they encountered earlier, and his heart sank with a sense of foreboding.</p><p>Vice Island Master Xiao finally fixed his gaze on Mu Yifeng, his expression darkening. He questioned coldly, "Where were you going?"</p><p>Mu Yifeng explained, "Reporting to Vice Island Master Xiao, this junior followed Senior Fang and Senior Shentu. We were ambushed by Celestial Alliance traitors. Under Senior Fang's orders, I broke through the encirclement to seek reinforcements from Stargazer Island. I was nearly killed by the Celestial Alliance but was saved by Junior Brother Qin. We were returning to Stargazer Island to report the enemy's movements. We suddenly saw you flying towards us and, unsure whether you were friend or foe, we resorted to such measures. Please forgive us!"</p><p>After hearing Mu Yifeng's explanation, Vice Island Master Xiao grunted, his expression softening slightly. He said indifferently, "No need to return to Stargazer Island. All Foundation Establishment cultivators, follow me south."</p><p>Qin Sang had expected this.</p><p>Jie Ying and Mao Ji's faces paled, their expressions filled with terror. They looked pleadingly at Qin Sang, seeking his help.</p><p>Qin Sang pretended not to see.</p><p>He couldn't even guarantee his own safety, let alone speak up for them.</p><p>The Vice Island Master of Stargazer Island, this title carried immense weight, representing the formidable authority bestowed upon him by the major sects of the Xiao Han Region.</p><p>He wielded the power of life and death; it was no exaggeration!</p><p>To defy his orders was to court death.</p><p>Seeing those two figures among the approaching cultivators, Qin Sang had a premonition.</p><p>He hadn't expected the change to come so quickly. Despite his haste, with barely any delays along the way, he was still too late to escape the vortex of this slaughter.</p><p>Without allowing Qin Sang and the others to speak, Vice Island Master Xiao changed his tone and inquired about what Mu Yifeng had witnessed.</p>
