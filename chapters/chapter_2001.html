<h1>Chapter 1992: Grandmaster Yue</h1><p>The Heavenly River Inverse Slaughter Formation.</p><p>From its name, it seemed related to the Nine Heavens Silver River, naturally utilizing the power of the stars.  Unlike the Northern Palace Dipper Refining Talisman performed by True Person Xingqiong back then, using a killing formation to channel stellar essence into the body undoubtedly carried certain risks.  But without other options, Qin Sang could only take this gamble.</p><p>Qin Sang patiently listened to the other party describe the characteristics of the Heavenly River Inverse Slaughter Formation.</p><p>The other party didn't hide their desire for the *Cycle of Life and Death*. In this setting, everyone was shrewd; there was no need for pretense.</p><p>Overhearing, Gu Yunsou became even more certain that this person was the infamous Zhen Laomo of the Myriad Luo Dao.</p><p>"This old devil resides on Myriad Luo Island. Though a demonic cultivator, he maintains a detached relationship with the demonic path.  It's said that Myriad Luo Island's cultivation method, the *Scripture of Unquenchable Thirst*, is bizarre and unorthodox.  His temper is erratic, and even other demonic cultivators are reluctant to deal with him."</p><p>The *Cycle of Life and Death* was useless to Qin Sang. If he could exchange it for the Heavenly River Inverse Slaughter Formation, he was naturally willing, but Zhen Laomo's conditions made him frown.</p><p>How could he hand over the *Cycle of Life and Death* without seeing the Heavenly River Inverse Slaughter Formation?</p><p>If it were a reputable sect like the Clear Sky Sect, there would be some credibility.  These demonic cultivators were capricious and tyrannical, making them impossible to trust.</p><p>The trade meeting was still ongoing, with waves of divine senses arriving one after another.  It wasn't convenient to discuss details at this time, so Qin Sang said, "Which peak is Fellow Daoist staying at? After the trade meeting, I will personally pay you a visit."</p><p>Zhen Laomo was silent for a moment, then said, "Brown Peak."</p><p>Gu Yunsou knew this peak and said, "Brown Peak is located in the northernmost part of the city. This old devil is truly reclusive."</p><p>After dealing with Zhen Laomo, Qin Sang contacted others and negotiated terms.</p><p>Both sides had intentions and were decisive individuals.  Often, they could finalize a deal within a few exchanges. Qin Sang eventually sold two spirit treasures, but didn't acquire any others in return. What he exchanged for were top-grade spirit materials.</p><p>Spirit treasures were valued for their quality, not quantity. Qin Sang preferred to refine and enhance his own.</p><p>Then it was Gu Yunsou's turn.</p><p>As dawn approached, the trade meeting came to an end.</p><p>Thanks to Gu Yunsou's auspicious words, Qin Sang's harvest was indeed bountiful, bolstering his confidence in upgrading treasures like the Bright Mountain Armor.</p><p>"The trade meeting has concluded. Fellow Daoists, please return."</p><p>The host only said this one sentence and fell silent. The orbs of light in the mist extinguished one by one, and darkness once again enveloped the space.</p><p>A moment later, Qin Sang felt his body lighten, and light reappeared in his vision. He was 'spit out' by the flower lantern.</p><p>Hua Ying made a face at them, crawled back into the heart of the flower, and the bud closed.</p><p>In an instant, Qin Sang could no longer sense Hua Ying's presence; it had completely vanished.</p><p>Looking around, they were on a vine bridge at the foot of a mountain.  The surrounding environment had drastically changed; it was no longer the previous mountain.</p><p>Unknowingly, they had been transported to another location.</p><p>Being able to easily relocate these Void Refinement cultivators was related to their lack of resistance, but it also demonstrated the host's powerful control over the city.</p><p>No wonder no one dared to cause trouble during past trade meetings.</p><p>Qin Sang sighed inwardly and said to Gu Yunsou, "Please accompany me to Brown Peak."</p><p>"I also want to see what tricks Zhen Laomo is up to. Now that he knows Patriarch Ming Hu was slain by Daoist Priest, that devil surely wouldn't dare scheme against you."</p><p>Gu Yunsou had a purely spectatorial attitude, even anticipating some conspiracy from Zhen Laomo to further probe Qin Sang's depths.</p><p>In Gu Yunsou's eyes, Qin Sang was unfathomable. The spirit treasures that appeared at the trade meeting indicated that at least two Void Refinement cultivators had fallen at his hands.</p><p>The two identified their direction and headed towards Brown Peak.</p><p>Qin Sang also considered the possibility of Zhen Laomo harboring ill intentions, but he wasn't worried. Firstly, his strength had greatly increased, and secondly, he wasn't lacking in helpers.</p><p>A small Cave Heaven was enough to bind Gu Yunsou, Sect Master Yu, and himself onto the same boat.</p><p>Before long, they arrived at the northern edge of the city and saw a mountain.</p><p>This mountain had few flower lanterns and was relatively dark. Before even entering the mountain, they could sense faint fluctuations emanating from a treasure garden.</p><p>"It's Zhen Laomo."</p><p>Gu Yunsou transmitted his voice.</p><p>As the two approached the treasure garden, bright light suddenly erupted from within the dark garden. The gates opened on their own, and a middle-aged man dressed in white robes came out to greet them.</p><p>This man had a square face and a fair complexion, without a beard. Judging by his appearance alone, it was difficult to associate him with a demonic giant.</p><p>Only when carefully observing his eyes could one detect a deep chill.</p><p>This person was Zhen Laomo.</p><p>Zhen Laomo's gaze swept across Qin Sang's face, and he said bluntly to Gu Yunsou, "I knew it. Just relying on you, old thing, you definitely couldn't kill the old zombie!"</p><p>Cloud Capital Heaven and the Fallen Soul Abyss had been fighting for so long. If they could eliminate Patriarch Ming Hu, they wouldn't have waited until now.</p><p>Then, he slightly cupped his hands towards Qin Sang, "This must be Daoist Priest Qing Feng, right?  I've been looking forward to meeting you!"</p><p>"The old devil has also heard of Daoist Priest's name. You're not completely ignored," Gu Yunsou retorted.</p><p>Zhen Laomo snorted, "The whole city is talking about the mysterious person you brought.  What's so strange about me knowing?"</p><p>Entering the treasure garden, they took their seats and got straight to the point.</p><p>"Where is the Heavenly River Inverse Slaughter Formation now? I must see it with my own eyes to be assured. Otherwise, how can I know if Fellow Daoist is deceiving me?" Qin Sang spoke frankly.</p><p>Zhen Laomo frowned, "To be honest with Daoist Priest, obtaining this formation requires some effort. I didn't anticipate Daoist Priest would make such a request and came unprepared. If Daoist Priest gives me that secret technique first, the chances of success can increase by thirty percent. I can use other items as collateral to ease Daoist Priest's worries."</p><p>Hearing this, Qin Sang and Gu Yunsou exchanged glances, finding it strange.</p><p>They initially thought the Heavenly River Inverse Slaughter Formation was in someone else's hands, and Zhen Laomo needed to trade with the formation's owner. But judging by Zhen Laomo's tone, it didn't seem quite like that.</p><p>After pondering for a moment, Qin Sang said, "It seems Fellow Daoist Zhen doesn't wish to reveal the origin of this formation?"</p><p>Zhen Laomo nodded and affirmed.</p><p>"In that case, Old Devil, you should go retrieve it yourself. Daoist Priest wants the Heavenly River Inverse Slaughter Formation and has no interest in other treasures."</p><p>Gu Yunsou suddenly interjected,毫不客气, "The Clear Sky Grand Assembly lasts for half a year. Isn't that enough time for a trip?"</p><p>"You…"</p><p>Zhen Laomo's face showed a hint of anger.</p><p>The Clear Sky Grand Assembly concerned the future landscape and was crucial for a sect. If he, a Void Refinement ancestor, wasn't present, they would lose many benefits.</p><p>Gu Yunsou was playing the bad cop.</p><p>Qin Sang explained his difficulties, "Fellow Daoist Zhen must understand, missing the Clear Sky Grand Assembly makes it difficult to gather everyone together. I must seize this opportunity and cannot place my hopes solely on Fellow Daoist."</p><p>"Indeed. If there are no results in the subsequent trade meetings, I will recommend Daoist Priest to Elder Yi of the Clear Sky Sect. They might have it in their collection, though the price will be higher.  By then…"</p><p>Gu Yunsou sneered, "Old Devil, you better think carefully. Although the Clear Sky Sect doesn't discriminate against demonic cultivators, will they sit idly by and watch a top-tier secret technique fall into the hands of the demonic path?"</p><p>Gu Yunsou and Qin Sang cooperated seamlessly, their words like a string of pearls.</p><p>*Slap!*</p><p>Zhen Laomo slammed the table and stood up, pacing back and forth as if weighing something. After a moment, he made his decision, "I'll entrust my few incompetent disciples to Daoist Priest then!"</p><p>Myriad Luo Island was isolated, and he had no close acquaintances. Entrusting them to Qin Sang was actually more reassuring.</p><p>"But I have one condition.  Daoist Priest cannot give the Soul Extinguishing Lamp of the old zombie to anyone else. After this matter, I will exchange it for other treasures."</p><p>Qin Sang reckoned that the Heavenly River Inverse Slaughter Formation was likely real and felt somewhat relieved. He smiled and said, "As long as Fellow Daoist Zhen can bring back the formation, besides the Soul Extinguishing Lamp, Patriarch Ming Hu also had a few other spirit treasures. Would Fellow Daoist be interested?"</p><p>"My path and the old zombie's are different. Only the Soul Extinguishing Lamp is of some use to me. The others are no different from scrap metal," Zhen Laomo said dismissively.</p><p>"I'll set off now. Farewell!"</p><p>Zhen Laomo was unusually decisive, cupping his hands and leaving immediately.</p><p>Outside the treasure garden.</p><p>Qin Sang and Gu Yunsou watched Zhen Laomo depart.</p><p>"I didn't expect Zhen Laomo would rather skip the Grand Assembly than reveal the origin of the Heavenly River Inverse Slaughter Formation. I was thinking that if Zhen Laomo dared to have any malicious intentions, I would help Daoist Priest eliminate him as well, ridding the cultivation world of a major scourge," Gu Yunsou said regretfully.</p><p>Qin Sang now only hoped that Zhen Laomo would successfully obtain the Heavenly River Inverse Slaughter Formation and return alive, without any further complications.  He didn't echo Gu Yunsou's sentiment and turned to look at the treasure garden.</p><p>A red-haired young man was standing at the entrance, his usual arrogance replaced with respect.  He was Zhen Laomo's direct disciple.</p><p>"Since I promised Zhen Laomo, I will stay at Brown Peak for now."</p><p>"Alright," Gu Yunsou nodded. "Zhen Laomo operates alone, without external support. He wouldn't dare to ask for too much, only needing to protect his existing interests and guard against others taking a bite. With Daoist Priest stationed at Brown Peak, others will be wary and won't actively provoke him. It won't require much effort."</p><p>Qin Sang called Zhen Laomo's disciple over and instructed him to go to Clear Drum Peak and bring Tai Yi and Yu Lang.</p><p>Gu Yunsou continued, "Yesterday I saw Grandmaster Yue's eldest disciple. Grandmaster Yue is preparing a batch of spirit pills, which requires two months to refine. After the pills are complete, she will personally come and meet with Daoist Priest."</p><p>"Good!"</p><p>Qin Sang was in high spirits.</p><p>Both the stellar essence infusion and the Azure Origin Frost Flower Divine Liquid had prospects. This trip had been worthwhile!</p><p>After seeing Gu Yunsou off, Qin Sang occupied Zhen Laomo's treasure garden.</p><p>When Tai Yi and Yu Lang arrived, he ordered them to change into Myriad Luo Dao robes, disguising themselves as Myriad Luo Island disciples to participate in the Clear Sky Grand Assembly.</p><p>Firstly, the rewards at the Clear Sky Grand Assembly were quite generous.</p><p>Secondly, it would allow them to broaden their horizons and gain experience. When Green Goat View grew stronger, they would also need to join the Grand Assembly.</p><p>After another half an hour, daylight broke, and the Clear Sky Grand Assembly commenced!</p><p>As the hour of Mao arrived, the booming of bells and drums shook the mountains. Countless cultivators emerged from their caves, gazing towards the sky.</p><p>A halo of azure light spread across the horizon, with brilliant clouds and shimmering霞光.</p><p>Deep within the radiant glow, clouds and mist swirled, and immortal mountains appeared faintly, exuding an air of mystery.</p><p>Accompanied by the continuous ringing of bells, ripples formed within the clouds and mist, and teams of cultivators flew out, some carrying banners, some holding flags, forming a grand procession.</p><p>At the same time, the vine bridges on all the peaks trembled and began to break apart.</p><p>*Swish! Swish! Swish!*</p><p>The tightly wound vines separated from each other, whipping through the air like dancing serpents.</p><p>The piercing sounds of air being sliced filled the air as the vines shot towards the sky, forming ladders to the heavens.</p><p>Pairs of celestial maidens and jade children appeared in the sky, holding purifying vases and scattering sweet dew.</p><p>The water mist condensed without dispersing, forming clear and luminous platforms in the sunlight, refracting rainbows and creating a variety of beautiful scenes that dazzled the eye.</p><p>The celestial platforms were formed.</p><p>Cultivators called out to each other and ascended.</p><p>Guided by the jade children, Qin Sang led the Myriad Luo Island disciples and sat down at Myriad Luo Island's designated area, attracting curious glances.</p><p>The following ceremony was extremely extravagant, showcasing the power and grandeur of the Clear Sky Sect.</p><p>Qin Sang lost interest after watching for a while and turned his attention inward, contemplating other matters.</p><p>Having obtained new spirit materials at the trade meeting, his plans for upgrading the Bright Mountain Armor also needed to be adjusted.</p><p>Over the next six months, he needed to carefully consider and consult other artifact refining grandmasters about the Dao of Artifact Refinement.</p><p>"Cloud Capital Heaven's flying artifacts were purchased from Eternal Firm Mountain. There must be artifact refining grandmasters there…"</p><p>Qin Sang glanced towards a certain area of the celestial platform, pondering asking Gu Yunsou for an introduction.</p><p>Before he knew it, the ceremony had ended, and an elder of the Clear Sky Sect announced the start of the Grand Assembly.</p><p>"Mid-Void Refinement."</p><p>Qin Sang narrowed his eyes slightly, sensing the aura of the Clear Sky Sect elder and judging his cultivation level.</p><p>He then looked towards the Clear Sky Sect's seating area.</p><p>This time, the Clear Sky Sect had only dispatched four elders, and three of them were at Early-Void Refinement.</p><p>The Grand Assembly began, starting with elite disciples from the Clear Sky Sect and other sects engaging in sparring matches for entertainment.</p><p>Tai Yi and Yu Lang blended in among the Myriad Luo Island cultivators.</p><p>Except when it was their turn to spar, Qin Sang spent most of his time contemplating the Bright Mountain Armor.</p><p>At dusk, the first day of the Grand Assembly concluded. The next session would be three days later.</p><p>Qin Sang called Tai Yi and Yu Lang over, pointed out their shortcomings in the sparring matches, and left them to comprehend on their own.</p><p>Two months passed quickly.  Qin Sang didn't wait for Zhen Laomo, but he did wait for Grandmaster Yue.</p><p>There was no Grand Assembly on this day.  Just past noon, Grandmaster Yue personally paid a visit.</p><p>Qin Sang was meditating in the treasure garden and hurried out to greet her, seeing a woman standing at the door.</p><p>He hadn't inquired about Grandmaster Yue's gender before and realized she was a female cultivator.</p><p>"Daoist Priest Qing Feng."</p><p>Grandmaster Yue nodded slightly.</p><p>"I greet Grandmaster Yue. Please come in!"</p><p>Qin Sang observed Grandmaster Yue discreetly.  Her appearance wasn't strikingly beautiful, but her demeanor was gentle, and her every movement brought a feeling of warmth and comfort.</p><p>Seeing Grandmaster Yue, Qin Sang couldn't help but think of Grandmaster Gu.</p><p>Grandmaster Gu and Grandmaster Ling Xu were both alchemy grandmasters he had befriended in the Talisman World. Though there were special circumstances, their help to him was undeniable.</p><p>With the Dao Court's return to the Great Thousand World, free from the Six Heavens Ancient Qi and the restrictions of the Merit Seal, the cultivation level of the Dao Court cultivators would definitely rise by a significant margin.</p><p>He wondered if they would be able to break through to Void Refinement.</p><p>Unknowingly, it had been almost five hundred years since he ascended to the Great Thousand World.</p><p>In the Great Thousand World, the average lifespan of a human Nascent Soul cultivator, excluding those particularly skilled in life preservation, was around three thousand years, although variations of a few hundred years were possible.</p><p>He wondered if there would be a chance to meet them again in this lifetime.</p><p>Qin Sang sighed inwardly. Whenever he thought of these things, it would stir up those memories he had deliberately sealed away.</p><p>If this was the case for his old friends from the Dao Court, what about his old friends from the Storm Realm?</p><p>Thinking of this, Qin Sang's mood became somewhat somber, but he didn't let it show, maintaining a calm expression as he welcomed Grandmaster Yue into the treasure garden and offered her the Gan Xue spirit tea he had prepared earlier.</p><p>Grandmaster Yue wasn't initially interested in tea, but after taking a sip, she couldn't help but praise it.</p><p>Qin Sang exchanged a few pleasantries. In his less than cheerful mood, he didn't want to beat around the bush and asked directly, "Fellow Daoist Gu Yunsou mentioned that Grandmaster Yue is searching for the Azure Origin Frost Flower Divine Liquid, the true owner of this pill formula?"</p><p>"Indeed!"</p><p>Grandmaster Yue set down her teacup and said solemnly, "No matter what, I will refine the Azure Origin Frost Flower Divine Liquid for Daoist Priest, free of charge! I just want to presumptuously ask Daoist Priest, where did you obtain this pill formula?"</p>
