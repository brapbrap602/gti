<h1>Chapter 946: Blockade</h1><p>The monstrous bird's strength was equivalent to a Nascent Soul early-stage cultivator.</p><p>Using the "Summoning Thunder Technique," Bai, his clone, and the two-headed beast might have a chance to repel the bird. However, this would inevitably alarm the beasts below and attract Mu Laomo.</p><p>A choice must be made if it comes to that.</p><p>With the Soul-Nourishing Wood, his cultivation would no longer be restricted. He believed that next time he entered the Seven Killing Hall, he could traverse the sword path on his own.</p><p>But time waits for no one, and no one can predict what might happen decades later; unforeseen accidents might occur.</p><p>Now that he could escape safely, Qin Sang naturally welcomed it.</p><p>He was more cautious than before, quickly escaping the chasm and heading towards the outer edge of the Purple Mist Desolate Land.</p><p>…</p><p>Inside the chasm.</p><p>The monstrous bird appeared, forming a three-way standoff, each wary of the others.</p><p>At that moment, a long howl suddenly came from the direction of the Ghost Place. Mu Laomo, clad in icy fire, rushed to the beasts in the blink of an eye.</p><p>In an instant, all the beasts' eyes focused on Mu Laomo.</p><p>These beasts, influenced by the Seven Killing Hall, were extremely ferocious. Upon discovering Mu Laomo—whose aura far surpassed theirs, posing the greatest threat as an unwelcome guest—they immediately dropped their conflicts and relentlessly attacked him.</p><p>The monstrous bird spread its wings, spitting black light.</p><p>The canine-like beast leader spewed a jet of purple fire.</p><p>Another group of dragon-like beasts intertwined their tails, their bodies instantly entwining. Purple energy surged, and their size ballooned, transforming into a true dragon-like creature. Its long tail slammed down towards Mu Laomo.</p><p>Suddenly besieged by the beasts, Mu Laomo was furious, "Blind beasts! I haven't sought you out, yet you dare obstruct my path? Get out of my way!"</p><p>Mu Laomo roared, and the icy flame armor on his body suddenly erupted.</p><p>A sizzling sound echoed as the purple mist was scorched by the Dongming Icy Flame. The flame coalesced into a ball, rushing towards the purple fire spat by the leader.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The icy flame and the purple fire collided.</p><p>The two spiritual flames unleashed a terrifying shockwave, creating a two-colored pillar of fire that soared into the sky, pushing back even the purple mist.</p><p>At the same time, a gray pouch appeared in Mu Laomo's hand. He aimed it at the monstrous bird and the dragon, muttered an incantation, and countless black sand grains erupted from the pouch.</p><p>These grains varied in size, from microscopic dust to the size of a grain of rice, yet they were incredibly heavy, like a wall, blocking the black light and stopping the dragon.</p><p>For a moment, the power Mu Laomo displayed shocked the beasts.</p><p>Mu Laomo staggered back several yards, his figure trembling before regaining his footing.  Simultaneously confronting these beasts' attacks wasn't as easy as he'd made it sound.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Mu Laomo didn't even glance at the beasts. He looked up, his eyes fixed on a deep pit on the upper cliff wall, the one left by the monstrous bird's attack on Qin Sang, as if he had discovered something.  Then, he pushed off the ground and dashed towards the cliff wall.</p><p>The beasts, encountering such an arrogant opponent who dared ignore them, were enraged.</p><p>"Get out of my way!"</p><p>Mu Laomo controlled the demonic fire with one hand and wielded the magic sand with the other, fighting fiercely to break through.</p><p>Soon after, a roar of humiliated fury echoed from the depths of the chasm.</p><p>"If you fall into my hands, you will suffer the cruellest tortures, begging for death but finding none!"</p><p>With his experience, the clues made everything clear.</p><p>That fellow not only stole the treasure and destroyed the demonic fire but also escaped right under his nose, and he was completely unaware. Mu Laomo was furious.</p><p>…</p><p>Above the chasm.</p><p>Qin Sang sped towards the cave where the earthworm dragon resided, deliberately avoiding the canyon.</p><p>He sensed the earth-shattering battle behind him and could guess the identities of both parties.</p><p>He hadn't interfered and had been extremely cautious, leaving behind no trace besides the marks of the monstrous bird's attack.</p><p>Even if that Nascent Soul cultivator discovered something, it wouldn't lead them to him.</p><p>Thinking this, Qin Sang felt relieved.</p><p>Finally, the earthworm dragon's cave was in sight.</p><p>Just as Qin Sang was about to enter, the ground suddenly trembled, and the sound of battle came from behind, accompanied by several roars he hadn't heard before.</p><p>"Did the fight reach here? Or did that Nascent Soul cultivator shake off those beasts and encounter a new opponent? This direction… could it be that top-tier beast that attacked Madam Liu…"</p><p>Qin Sang was startled. That Nascent Soul cultivator was even more formidable than he had imagined.</p><p>Passing through the cave and arriving on the other side of the high cliff, Qin Sang breathed a sigh of relief, his face showing a look of relief.</p><p>The outside world was vast, full of secret realms and cultivators.  Finding a place to hide would be easy; even with incredible power, no one could find him.</p><p>Qin Sang, realizing her predicament, didn't flee directly into the ancient woods. Instead, she changed course, opting to circumvent the danger and avoid a direct confrontation.</p><p>Meanwhile,</p><p>Mou Laomo, having sustained injuries in his struggle to escape the monstrous birds and beasts, finally broke free at considerable cost.  He was about to search for his target when another beast was drawn to the area, forcing yet another battle.</p><p>After finally repelling this creature, Mou Laomo knew that even a cultivator at the Golden Core stage would have ample time to escape the Purple Mist Wilderness.  </p><p>This realization brought a volatile change to his expression; he was furious.</p><p>After careful consideration, he flew directly towards the wasteland near the Seven Killing Hall exit.  Mou Laomo was confident that his speed would allow him to reach the wasteland first.  He reasoned that when the immortal barrier closed and everyone was forced to leave, they would all have to pass through that wasteland.</p><p>Deep within the forest,</p><p>an elderly Golden Core cultivator was harvesting a spirit herb.</p><p>He had just placed the herb in his jade box, a pleased expression still on his face, when he seemed to sense something.  He looked towards the depths of the forest, listening intently.</p><p>His expression suddenly changed.  After a quick glance around, he darted behind the roots of an ancient tree and, with a flick of his sleeve, released a puff of white smoke.  </p><p>The smoke enveloped him, and he vanished, leaving no trace.</p><p>The next moment, a fierce wind swept through, carrying a figure—Mou Laomo.</p><p>As he passed overhead, Mou Laomo paused slightly, glancing down.  With a single hand movement, he unleashed a burst of spiritual energy, striking the area where the cultivator had hidden with lightning speed.</p><p>White smoke erupted from the roots, and the cultivator leaped out, his face filled with terror. He fled, transforming into a streak of escaping light.</p><p>Mou Laomo let out a disdainful snort and flicked his finger, sending out a chilling flame that formed a fiery chain, which shot towards the cultivator and ensnared him.</p><p>The cultivator felt an intense chill, his body instantly stiffening, leaving him utterly helpless.</p><p>With a whoosh,</p><p>the chilling flame dragged the cultivator back.</p><p>“It’s you…”</p><p>The cultivator recognized Mou Laomo, but before he could say more, darkness consumed him, followed by a bloodcurdling scream.</p><p>Moments later, Mou Laomo retracted his hand, ceasing the soul search, and muttered, "Useless."</p><p>The Winter Nether Flame erupted, incinerating the cultivator to ashes, erasing him from existence.</p><p>The wind howled once more as Mou Laomo vanished, leaving behind only a gritted-teeth whisper, "I'll see just how far you can run!"</p><p>—</p><p>—</p><p>These two chapters were quite challenging to write; I revised them several times.  I'm exhausted.</p>
