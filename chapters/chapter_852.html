<h1>Chapter 844:  Yue Xian Gu</h1><p>Qin Sang noted that Elder Zou mentioned in his conversation that the Seven Killing Hall would reopen in more than forty years.</p><p>The time was finally set, even sooner than expected!</p><p>It would still be led by the Wu Clan.</p><p>The Seven Killing Hall would open twice in a hundred years.</p><p>Following the usual pattern, the first two openings of the Seven Killing Hall were less than three hundred years apart.  Wouldn't that mean she could enter the Seven Killing Hall multiple times before its next opening?</p><p>What were the Wu Clan looking for that they were willing to pay such a high price to repeatedly open the Seven Killing Hall?</p><p>Last time, the Grand Wu Priest obtained a treasure in the Heavenly Tower and was pursued by the Demon Lord, nearly triggering a war between the two clans.  Perhaps that treasure wasn't what they were actually seeking.</p><p>Regardless of the Wu Clan's schemes, it was none of Qin Sang's concern. The more times she could enter the Seven Killing Hall, the better. She could investigate all the secrets and find the ancient teleportation array before the Hall opened.</p><p>Qin Sang readily agreed to Elder Zou's request.</p><p>“Mao Shan Vine, Qing Wu Root… Scorpion Poison Grass…”</p><p>Elder Zou pondered for a long time. “I haven't seen these two herbs before. Let me inquire around. Many cultivators are trapped in the Demon Sea now, and treasures frequently appear on the Great Waste Island. There's a good chance we can find them. The order to defend the Great Waste Island comes from both righteous and demonic sects, and the three major trading alliances are also strictly following it.  Brother, stay on this island for now and don't worry. The demon race probably won't be crazy enough to actually attack Great Waste Island, and the storm will eventually subside. Though this island is on the periphery, your safety isn't immediately threatened. I'll think of a way.”</p><p>Qin Sang needed the Mao Shan Vine but couldn't directly ask for it, so she had to beat around the bush, asking Elder Zou to help investigate.</p><p>Leaving the Demon Sea was difficult in the short term.</p><p>After sending Elder Zou away, Qin Sang sat cross-legged outside her cave, holding a bone flute, cultivating by drawing on the power of the celestial stars.  When it was her turn, she would lead her team on island patrols.</p><p>While waiting for news, Qin Sang didn't give up her own efforts. She contacted old acquaintances, looking for a way out.</p><p>As days passed, the situation on Great Waste Island grew increasingly tense.</p><p>Demonic creatures frequently appeared in the nearby waters.  Contrary to expectations, after their defeat at Heavenly Witch Island, the demon race seemed to have gone mad and were trying to attack Great Waste Island, with more and more demonic beasts gathering.</p><p>Qin Sang even sensed an extremely terrifying aura during a patrol, possibly a transformed demon, and immediately led her troops to flee.</p><p>A storm was brewing.</p><p>At this rate, in a short time, Great Waste Island would be surrounded by a monstrous tide, and a great battle would break out.</p><p>Now, almost no cultivator could break through the demonic beasts' blockade and return.</p><p>Those trapped deep in the Demon Sea had uncertain fates.</p><p>Qin Sang, after a long wait, finally received news from Elder Zou. That day, after finishing her patrol, she eagerly flew to the island where Elder Zou was.</p><p>“Brother is here!”</p><p>Elder Zou greeted her warmly.</p><p>During this time, Qin Sang had readily helped Elder Zou, without revealing her secrets, by drawing maps of the Seven Killing Hall and analyzing various information. Their relationship had become quite close.</p><p>“I found the Mao Shan Vine you wanted. Our trading alliance has it!”</p><p>Elder Zou’s expression was mysterious, and he said in a low voice.</p><p>Qin Sang already knew that the East Pole Alliance had Mao Shan Vine, but she still pretended to be overjoyed, anxiously asking, “Where is it now?”</p><p>“Brother, don't rush.”</p><p>Elder Zou remained silent, leading Qin Sang into his cave, closing the cave door, and setting up several layers of soundproofing restrictions.</p><p>This behavior surprised Qin Sang, but she patiently waited.</p><p>Elder Zou sat in front of Qin Sang, no longer playing coy, lowering his voice. “Although we found the Mao Shan Vine, it’s not easy to obtain. The trading alliance values it highly, and you can't buy it with spirit stones. There’s only one way…”</p><p>Qin Sang leaned forward.</p><p>“A senior in the trading alliance is gathering people to rescue someone from the depths of the Demon Sea. If you go with that senior to save the person, the Mao Shan Vine will be one of the rewards. Also, that senior is very capable and promises to send the person back to the Canglang Sea to avoid the calamity if the mission succeeds.”</p><p>Elder Zou paused and said solemnly, “While searching for the Mao Shan Vine, I was approached by that senior, inviting me to go. I haven't refused yet. If you agree to these conditions, I can take you to meet him. I don't need to tell you how dangerous it is to enter the depths of the Demon Sea now. You must carefully consider.”</p><p>Going to the depths of the Demon Sea would not only allow her to obtain the Mao Shan Vine but also leave the Demon Sea. Qin Sang was immediately interested.</p><p>She had the Heavenly Demon Transformation and wasn't afraid of falling into the Demon Sea; going once wasn’t impossible.</p><p>However, even Elder Zou referred to this person as a senior. Could it be a Nascent Soul master?</p><p>After carefully inquiring about the reasons, Qin Sang felt relieved.</p><p>The woman was known as Yue Xiangu, a highly respected elder, not a Yuan Ying cultivator, but stuck at the bottleneck before achieving that stage.  Yue Xiangu held considerable influence, and Old Man Zou, having received her kindness, addressed her with respect.</p><p>If she were a Yuan Ying master, this trip wouldn't be simply about saving someone; Qin Sang would need to consider things carefully.</p><p>As long as it didn't involve a Yuan Ying dispute, Qin Sang was confident in his abilities and didn't hesitate long before asking Old Man Zou to take him to see Yue Xiangu.</p><p>Since it was Qin Sang's decision, Old Man Zou didn't dissuade him further and took Qin Sang to meet her.</p><p>Yue Xiangu was currently on an island near Da Huang Island. Upon their visit, they found her entertaining guests – two late-stage Jindan cultivators!</p><p>"Daoist Zou, have you reconsidered and agreed to go with me?"</p><p>Yue Xiangu was an elderly woman with silver hair, her face deeply lined and showing her age.  She seemed weary.</p><p>Such a sight on a peak Jindan cultivator indicated that she was facing dwindling essence and a short lifespan.</p><p>Upon seeing Old Man Zou, Yue Xiangu's eyes lit up with anticipation.</p><p>Old Man Zou shook his head, gesturing to Qin Sang.  "Senior Yue, I didn't come for myself. This junior brother of mine, Qingfeng, possesses extraordinary abilities and might be able to help you."</p><p>The smile vanished from Yue Xiangu's face. She glanced at Qin Sang, her tone displeased.  "Daoist Zou, the person I need to save is extremely important to me. This is no trifling matter!"</p><p>The other two guests watched with amusement.</p><p>"Senior, please calm down,"</p><p>Old Man Zou said calmly. "I wouldn't recommend this junior brother without reason. Cultivation level is only superficial; cultivators who can overcome their limitations are not uncommon. My junior brother has been to the Seven Killing Hall and returned unscathed. Isn't that proof enough of his abilities?  You've been searching for a suitable candidate, so allow my junior brother a try."</p><p>Yue Xiangu gave a soft exclamation, dropping her condescending attitude. "You've been to the Seven Killing Hall?"</p><p>"Yes!"</p><p>Qin Sang nodded.  Following Old Man Zou's cue, he flicked his finger, and his ebony sword flew from his palm, splitting into numerous sword beams, displaying formidable swordsmanship.</p><p>Instantly, the room was filled with a flurry of sword light, countless sword shadows appearing and disappearing, creating the illusion of a sword domain.</p><p>"Sword light division!"</p><p>Yue Xiangu slowly exhaled.</p><p>The other two guests also looked serious, sitting upright.</p><p>—</p><p>I've been on leave for quite some time, and a lot of work has piled up at the company. I will make up for yesterday's chapter later.</p>
