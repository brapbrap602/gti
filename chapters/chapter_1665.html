<h1>Chapter 1656: Mani Pearl</h1><p>Above, five-element divine prohibitions formed swirling clouds.</p><p>Below, a tide of mist churned.</p><p>Only the plaza in the middle appeared calm and safe. Aside from his avatar, no other figures were visible, and nothing felt amiss.</p><p>His avatar's spirit was taut, eyes gleaming as they swept across every corner.</p><p>He didn't release the Fire Jade Centipede.</p><p>The centipede had performed a great service, its ability to sense treasures unexpectedly useful for warnings.  Without it, his avatar might have already fallen prey to a trap.</p><p>This was crucial information, absolutely not to be revealed to the enemy.</p><p>If the enemy discerned the Fire Jade Centipede's origins and guessed how their movements were leaked, they could use some kind of sealing technique to block the treasure, preventing any further warning. His avatar's situation would become extremely dangerous.</p><p>Even the slightest rustle of grass and trees could stir his spirit.</p><p>As it turned out, these were just natural phenomena. There was no trace of the enemy; he seemed to be playing mind games with the air.</p><p>However, the Fire Jade Centipede was restless, its head constantly swaying. It couldn't pinpoint the treasure's location, unsure whether it was being interfered with or if the enemy was moving at high speed.</p><p>Although his avatar was still at the edge, he could see that the five-element prohibitions here were magnificent and strict, far surpassing the remnants of the Fire Rhinoceros Island formation or the crumbling protective formation of the Pure Ocean Sect.  They could potentially affect the Fire Jade Centipede's perception.</p><p>If it was the latter, the enemy's speed was already alarmingly fast, enough to make Qin Sang's heart tremble.</p><p>Something unusual was afoot!</p><p>The enemy, hidden in the shadows, possessed unknown strength and exceptionally powerful concealment techniques. They had infiltrated this close, yet his avatar remained completely unaware.</p><p>Qin Sang knew very well that the first batch to enter Emperor Bestowal Mountain were mostly Grand Cultivators with powerful backgrounds, not to be underestimated. He knew too little about these people and couldn't guess who it was.</p><p>Did the other party, seeing his avatar's relatively low cultivation and solitary state, harbor malicious intent?</p><p>This thought flashed through his avatar's mind.</p><p>With his true body absent, he sought only self-preservation. He maintained his protective divine light, while his arm trembled slightly, a flash of cold light enveloping a small seal as it flew above his head.</p><p>Spiritual treasure revealed, Jiao Serpent emerges!</p><p>The Four Jiao Serpent Seal hovered overhead, the Jiao Serpents coiling and dancing around his avatar, their cold light flickering like ethereal flames burning in the void, their aura awe-inspiring.</p><p>Shielded by the Jiao Serpents, his avatar's figure flickered in and out of existence.</p><p>With both a spiritual treasure and divine light protecting him, even a powerful cultivator would have to consider whether they could easily subdue his avatar and whether it was worth making a move here.</p><p>Within the five-element divine prohibitions.</p><p>Kun Dao silently materialized.</p><p>She stood amidst the swirling clouds, her robes fluttering, ethereal like a celestial being.  There were no fluctuations of Daoist arts or True Essence around her, yet she remained untouched by the omnipresent five-element prohibitions.</p><p>Through the clouds, Kun Dao observed the avatar.  Seeing the spiritual treasure above his head, a strange look flashed in her eyes.</p><p>Then, she looked towards the boundary between the clouds and the outside, the edge of the five-element prohibitions. Recalling the forced manifestation and the uncomfortable sensation when she had previously attempted to cross the boundary, she furrowed her brows, clearly displeased.</p><p>She didn't bother to hide her emotions; they were all displayed outwardly.</p><p>Tilting her head, Kun Dao seemed to be weighing the pros and cons, then suddenly faded away.</p><p>At the same time, the avatar noticed the Fire Jade Centipede suddenly become still.</p><p>Within his sleeve, the Fire Jade Centipede wriggled its plump body, struggling to lift a section, swaying it back and forth, its small eyes filled with confusion. But it didn't dwell on these matters, quickly lying back down, ready to fall asleep.</p><p>"Gone?"</p><p>The avatar was suspicious.</p><p>Logically, the Fire Jade Centipede hadn't been exposed.  The enemy couldn't have found the source of the leak and remedied it so quickly.</p><p>It was likely they were deterred by the spiritual treasure.</p><p>However, the avatar didn't dare to let his guard down. He looked around, moved away from the exposed plaza, and found a concealed spot within a forested area. Maintaining the spiritual treasure's protection, he set up layers of defensive formations around himself.</p><p>He decided to wait and see if the enemy had truly given up or was merely feigning retreat before deciding on his next move.</p><p>The churning mist intensified the mountain winds, causing the forest to rustle.</p><p>The avatar sat in meditation, seemingly entering a trance within this environment.</p><p>Soon, the avatar didn't need to worry anymore. Sensing his true body approaching for a rendezvous, he simply waited in place.</p><p>Qin Sang's true body shook off his pursuers, swiftly exiting the Blazing Sun divine prohibition, continuing outwards. Before long, he reached the edge of the clouds and returned to the plaza.</p><p>Just as he stepped onto the plaza, Qin Sang abruptly stopped.</p><p>On one of the jade staircases extending from the plaza, two figures emerged from the misty tide.</p><p>Their eyes met, all six of them momentarily stunned.</p><p>The newcomers were none other than the Poison King and Master Huaiyin.</p><p>Working together to enter the formation, they naturally had an easier time than Qin Sang's avatar. However, without guidance on the mountain, they misjudged the direction several times within the formation.</p><p>Thus, although they entered the formation at the same time as the avatar, they arrived a little later.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang, the Poison King sized him up, letting out a soft "Eh?" before appearing on the plaza in a flash, facing Qin Sang with a slight bow.  "Greetings, fellow Daoist."</p><p>Master Huaiyin followed closely behind, placing his palms together in a Buddhist greeting. Unfamiliar with the experts of the Central Continent, he remained half a step behind the Poison King, not wishing to overstep.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression was indifferent, returning a casual greeting, inwardly sighing. Two more Grand Cultivators!</p><p>While greeting Qin Sang, the Poison King also observed the surroundings. Seeing the clouds blocking the path above and only Qin Sang present on the plaza and its vicinity, he understood that they were late.</p><p>However, according to Old Devil Fan's message, further guidance would be left for them if anything happened.  But there was nothing here, a clear breach of promise.</p><p>The so-called alliance was, after all, just a temporary measure, extremely fragile. The Poison King had long anticipated Old Devil Fan tearing up the agreement and wasn't surprised at all.</p><p>A hundred thoughts raced through the Poison King's mind, but none showed on his face, his manners impeccable.</p><p>Collecting his thoughts, the Poison King was curious about Qin Sang. "Fellow Daoist seems unfamiliar?"</p><p>Qin Sang twitched the corner of his lips, his tone flat. "The Poison King's reputation precedes you.  It's only natural that someone insignificant like myself wouldn't catch your eye."</p><p>Looking at the exquisitely beautiful face before him, rivaling any beauty in the world, Qin Sang was greatly surprised, unexpectedly encountering the Poison King so soon.</p><p>The legends of the Poison King's breathtaking beauty, blurring the lines between male and female, were indeed true.</p><p>Whether the Poison King was male or female remained a popular topic of discussion in the cultivation world.</p><p>As the master of the Ten Thousand Poison Mountain, their presence here, away from the Golden Jade Continent, suggested they were pursuing the Strange-Faced Man.</p><p>Remembering that the jade beetle the Poison King so desperately desired was slumbering within his dantian, Qin Sang couldn't help but hesitate, discreetly observing the monk.</p><p>The monk was powerfully built, his Qi and blood overflowing, exceptionally vigorous.</p><p>Qin Sang, also a body cultivator, could tell that this person must have cultivated a top-tier body refining technique to a profound level, at least stronger than himself.</p><p>He marveled, mentally going through the famous Buddhist masters of the Central Continent, but none matched.</p><p>"Just empty reputation, nothing more."</p><p>Unaware of Qin Sang's thoughts, the Poison King, seeing his indifferent attitude, couldn't press further, and introduced himself, "This is Master Huaiyin, an eminent monk from the Western Lands. We were traveling together in the Southern Continent when we witnessed the celestial phenomenon and came here by chance. There are still many things we don't understand, and we have a few questions we'd like to ask fellow Daoist."</p><p>So he was from the Western Lands.  I wonder if he had ever met the Ghost Mother?</p><p>Qin Sang bowed slightly to the monk and said lazily, "The Ten Thousand Poison Mountain dominates the Barbarian Continent. Does the esteemed Poison King not know where this is?"</p><p>"We only guessed it to be the legacy of the Formless Immortal Sect..."  The Poison King hadn't finished speaking when Qin Sang interrupted.</p><p>"That's enough!  What other purpose could there be for coming here, other than treasure hunting! I know no more than you do and can't answer your questions."  Qin Sang spread his hands, making a move to leave.</p><p>The Poison King frowned, a strangely captivating expression appearing on their face.</p><p>If Qin Sang's cultivation were lower, the Poison King wouldn't hesitate to subdue him first.  However, with the enemy's whereabouts unknown, it was unwise to offend a Grand Cultivator rashly.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang about to leave, the Poison King's mind raced.  "Forgive my presumption, but I'd like to inquire about someone, this person..."</p><p>Saying this, the Poison King channeled True Essence, condensing a water mirror that displayed a figure with a face covered in centipede scars.</p><p>As expected.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression remained unchanged, seemingly glancing casually at the mirror, then scoffing, "You dare to claim ignorance?  This person is one of the masterminds behind the opening of this legacy!"</p><p>"To be honest, we truly didn't know,"  the Poison King shook their head frankly.  Seeing that Qin Sang hadn't grasped their meaning, they directly asked if he had seen this person in the mountains, offering a reward for information on his whereabouts.</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head and walked away.</p><p>The Poison King sighed softly, unsure whether Qin Sang meant he didn't know or hadn't seen the person. They exchanged a glance with Master Huaiyin, scrutinizing the five-element divine prohibitions.</p><p>Qin Sang left the plaza, flying a certain distance, making sure no one was following before flashing into the forest.</p><p>The Poison King's swift appearance was unexpected.</p><p>In his heart, Qin Sang was reluctant to return the Jade Beetle.</p><p>Such a unique insect, one of a kind in the world.</p><p>He hoped to subdue it himself or let the Poison Bead devour it.  Improving the Poison Ward Armor was secondary; he was eager to see if the Poison Bead would undergo any changes after consuming this extraordinary venomous insect.</p><p>If he could master the Jade Beetle's poisonous light, he could then cultivate the Heaven Severing Soul-Shaking Needle, effectively acquiring two powerful poison Dao techniques at once.</p><p>"I'll play it by ear!"</p><p>Qin Sang thought to himself.</p><p>He had disguised himself when he visited the Seven Fragrance Pavilion, so there shouldn't have been any slips.</p><p>With these thoughts, Qin Sang concealed his presence, quietly approaching the place where his avatar was hiding.</p><p>With their minds connected, he already knew what his avatar had encountered.</p><p>Before long, Qin Sang appeared beside his avatar.</p><p>Under his Heavenly Eye, everything was clear; there were no enemies hidden nearby.</p><p>"Who could it be?"</p><p>Qin Sang wondered.  Counting carefully, it couldn't be Su Zinan or the Poison King's group.  Zhu Wudao was being targeted by the two True Lords of the Eight Scenery Pavilion, making Old Devil Fan the most likely suspect.</p><p>Demonic techniques were strange and unpredictable, and Old Devil Fan's actions did fit the profile.</p><p>Or perhaps, there were other unknown experts who had entered the mountain.</p><p>Unable to figure it out, Qin Sang stopped dwelling on it, sitting down cross-legged, taking the lotus seat from his avatar.  The avatar then withdrew his defenses, flying up to observe changes in the five-element divine prohibitions, particularly the metal element divine prohibition.</p><p>With Old Devil Zhu possessing the Metal Phase Token, the metal element divine prohibition was most likely to show some changes.</p><p>Before acting, Qin Sang wanted to see what secrets his newly acquired treasure held.</p><p>He held the lotus platform in one hand and the Wish-Fulfilling Jewel in the other.</p><p>The indentation in the lotus platform perfectly matched the Wish-Fulfilling Jewel; it was too coincidental!</p><p>Qin Sang narrowed his eyes, thinking about the connection between the Pure Ocean Sect, Xiao Xiangzi, and the Formless Immortal Sect.  He brought his hands closer, slightly turning the lotus platform so that the indentation faced the Wish-Fulfilling Jewel.</p><p>At this moment, he felt a subtle attraction between the two treasures.</p><p>Qin Sang's heart stirred. Just as he was about to join them, he suddenly remembered something.  His divine sense probed into the Thousand Jun Ring, summoning several streaks of light that transformed into a flag formation, sealing off the area to prevent any unusual phenomena from being detected by outsiders.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang pressed the Wish-Fulfilling Jewel into the lotus platform!</p><p>'Click!'</p><p>With a crisp sound, the Wish-Fulfilling Jewel nestled into the lotus platform, a perfect fit.</p><p>Exactly half of the jewel was above, and half below.</p><p>A seamless whole!</p><p>Qin Sang stared intently, noticing that at the moment of connection, the ring of red flames within the lotus platform seemed to expand momentarily before immediately returning to normal, encircling the Wish-Fulfilling Jewel, making its luster even deeper.</p><p>There were no other unusual occurrences.</p><p>Hesitating briefly, Qin Sang extended a strand of divine sense, surprised to find that the Wish-Fulfilling Jewel's name had changed.  A new name appeared in his mind -- Mani Pearl!</p><p>Clearly, this was its true name. The name "Wish-Fulfilling Jewel" was likely inscribed later by someone after the treasure was separated.</p><p>Mani Pearl. Qin Sang had seen this name in Buddhist scriptures. Some sutras described the Mani Pearl as a Buddha's treasure, possessing exceptional divine abilities.</p><p>But many Buddhist cultivators also liked to name their refined magical treasures after names from Buddhist scriptures, often with forced connections, so it was impossible to determine the treasure's origin based solely on its name.</p><p>Restored to its complete form, was it still a defensive magical treasure?</p><p>Qin Sang carefully examined it, only to be even more astonished.</p><p>Before, he couldn't determine the Wish-Fulfilling Jewel's rank.</p><p>Now, not only could he not determine the Mani Pearl's rank, but he couldn't even be sure if it was a magical treasure at all. This treasure defied his understanding.</p><p>He even felt that calling it a magical instrument wouldn't be entirely wrong.</p><p>It sounded absurd, but the world of cultivation was full of unusual existences. Special magical instruments weren't rare, but Qin Sang dared not make any definitive statements about the Mani Pearl.</p><p>"It seems my understanding of the Dao of Refining is still too shallow."</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head, channeling True Essence into the Mani Pearl, using the same method he used with the Wish-Fulfilling Jewel.</p><p>The next moment.</p><p>A brilliant golden light erupted around Qin Sang.</p><p>The familiar protective barrier appeared.</p><p>The protective ability was still there, seemingly a little denser, but it wasn't much different from the Wish-Fulfilling Jewel. Did the complete Mani Pearl have no other powers?</p><p>Qin Sang thought it strange, studying it for a moment.  Seeing the seemingly real and illusory flames within the Mani Pearl, and recalling that it came from the Fire Phase Hall, a sudden inspiration struck him.</p><p>Subconsciously, Qin Sang summoned his Fire Seed Golden Lotus, guiding a wisp of Demonic Fire into the Mani Pearl.</p><p>A strange scene unfolded.</p><p>The Nine Nether Demonic Fire entered the Mani Pearl effortlessly, without any resistance.</p><p>Within the crystal-clear Mani Pearl, a black flame appeared, dyeing the pearl black. Then the red flames on the lotus platform flickered, emitting a strange fluctuation.  Simultaneously, the golden light of Qin Sang's protective barrier darkened, subtly infused with a layer of black flames.</p><p>In an instant, the protective barrier transformed into a protective fire barrier!</p><p>Qin Sang didn't sense the familiar fierceness of the Demonic Fire from this protective fire barrier, but rather a sense of solidity. He quickly drew more Demonic Fire from the Fire Lotus into the Mani Pearl, which devoured it all.</p><p>The more Demonic Fire it absorbed, the denser the protective fire barrier became.</p><p>Qin Sang then divided his attention, using the Golden Sinking Sword to attack himself, discovering that although the protective fire barrier only possessed simple defensive capabilities, it was far superior to the Wish-Fulfilling Jewel, and its strength increased with the amount of Demonic Fire infused!</p>
