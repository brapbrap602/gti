<h1>Chapter 1494: The Grand Elder's Scheme (4k)</h1><p>"To cultivate the Ice Soul Divine Light to Great Completion at the early Nascent Soul stage is unprecedented. Even this old man didn't expect you to truly achieve it. Bingyao has delivered a great gift to this old man."</p><p>Yin Changsheng looked at Liuli with a gaze filled with delight and excitement, a sinister smile spreading across his face, as if he were gazing upon a rare and valuable treasure.</p><p>He made no attempt to conceal the fluctuations in his expression.</p><p>It was unclear whether he believed victory was already assured, rendering such efforts unnecessary, or if Tong Lingyu's words were true – that he had already been ensnared by inner demons, descending into madness, unable to maintain his state of mind.</p><p>Hearing these words, Qin Sang and Liuli exchanged a glance, understanding Yin Changsheng's intentions.</p><p>At the same time, they both thought of the same event.</p><p>During the grand wedding, Shang Lu, disregarding his status as the leader of a lineage, staged a farce of snatching the bride.</p><p>Everyone, including Qin Sang and Liuli, believed that Shang Lu's goal was to test Qin Sang. Little did they know, he was clearly using the Cleansing Pool as a smokescreen, his true objective being to force Liuli to act, to test her proficiency in this divine ability.</p><p>Tong Lingyu had made so many preparations, yet was defeated so thoroughly. Yin Changsheng must have had help.</p><p>Shang Lu was one of them!</p><p>At the time, they were only thinking about letting Qin Sang conceal his strength. Who could have known that Shang Lu's intentions were far more intricate? Shang Lu's actions were so deceptive that even Tong Lingyu was fooled, let alone them.</p><p>"And you!"</p><p>Yin Changsheng's gaze landed on Qin Sang. "Divine Sense manifestation at the mid-Nascent Soul stage! What's even more wonderful is that you two are Dao Companions! As a pair of lovebirds fated to share the same destiny, you barely meet the requirements of the Slaughtering Yin Blood Pool. The heavens have been kind to me, sending me two geniuses at the last moment, haha..."</p><p>Yin Changsheng laughed loudly, his laughter echoing through the underground cavern. His goal was about to be achieved, and his mood was exceptionally buoyant.</p><p>But to Qin Sang's ears, the sound was tinged with even more madness.</p><p>The three ice platforms of the Slaughtering Yin Blood Pool.</p><p>The final ice platform was actually intended to capture both him and Liuli.</p><p>Qin Sang desperately wanted to tell Yin Changsheng that he and Liuli were only feigned Dao Companions, bound by a connection arising from a cultivation technique of mutual supplementation, and might not meet the requirements. Unfortunately, Yin Changsheng would certainly not listen.</p><p>Back then, Qin Sang and Liuli could never have imagined that a simple transaction would leave behind a curse of destiny, firmly binding their fates together, the repercussions lingering for hundreds of years, still influencing them to this day.</p><p>Yin Changsheng was so confident, clearly having seen through his identity long ago.</p><p>Qin Sang had no idea when he had been exposed.</p><p>During his fight with Shang Lu, Qin Sang had been careful to conceal his powerful Divine Sense.</p><p>However, the Thousand Transformations Mask was not a supreme treasure. Shi Xue had mentioned before that if he encountered someone determined, using special divine abilities or Dharma treasures, it was possible to be seen through.</p><p>Moreover, Qin Sang had once ascended the Towering Sky Peak, not far from this Palace Master.</p><p>"This humble Daoist has a question."</p><p>Qin Sang's vigilance was at its peak, yet his tone remained calm as he spoke, interrupting Yin Changsheng's maniacal laughter.</p><p>"This humble Daoist only met the Grand Elder a little over ten years ago, and had never set foot in the Hidden Sun Realm before, nor had I ever met you, Fellow Daoist. My entering the Sacred Ground was also a spur-of-the-moment decision. Could it be that Fellow Daoist possesses the ability to foresee the future?"</p><p>This was indeed what puzzled Qin Sang.</p><p>Judging from Yin Changsheng's tone, although Liuli's divine ability was at Great Completion, her cultivation was insufficient and did not meet the requirements of the Slaughtering Yin Blood Pool. Him and Liuli becoming Dao Companions was a complete accident.</p><p>Yin Changsheng clearly couldn't have started plotting only ten years ago.</p><p>If he hadn't appeared, and there weren't enough people for the three ice platforms, wouldn't Yin Changsheng's efforts have been in vain?</p><p>Could he wait another three hundred years for the next destined person?</p><p>However, Qin Sang's real purpose in asking was to stall for time.</p><p>He analyzed the situation and felt that the chances of killing Yin Changsheng were slim. If he could escape the underground cavern, he would have more options.</p><p>He and the All-Seeing Heavenly Butterfly had been investigating the ancient restrictions in the cavern, and they were gradually starting to see a glimmer of hope. The weak point seemed to be at the top of the cavern, but the restrictions there were also extremely powerful, requiring a sufficient amount of time.</p><p>Once outside, he might be able to pull the Mixed Demon Elder and the Great Sage Sky Roc into the fray.</p><p>Additionally, Qin Sang was also silently observing the blood pool.</p><p>If escape was impossible, a battle was inevitable.</p><p>The Sun Divine Tree might not be able to easily hit the Palace Master, but he could attack what the Palace Master was forced to defend.</p><p>However, Yin Changsheng certainly valued the blood pool highly and should have protective measures in place. He couldn't act rashly.</p><p>Qin Sang's thoughts raced, calculating various possibilities.</p><p>"Without you two, this old man would have had to settle for second best, capturing the Mixed Demon as the third blood servant. However, the Mixed Demon is not a direct descendant of the Profound Sky Palace, so the effect would have been greatly diminished."</p><p>Yin Changsheng chuckled, speaking of this demonic giant with extreme casualness.</p><p>"I didn't expect that brat to cause such a commotion, but it's no matter. They're just a bunch of chickens and dogs. Once this old man achieves Soul Transformation, I will naturally cleanse the Sacred Ground."</p><p>So it was him!</p><p>The Mixed Demon Elder was actually lured in by Yin Changsheng!</p><p>The Profound Sky Palace Master was the traitor!</p><p>After learning the purpose of the blood pool and the ice platforms, Qin Sang had vaguely suspected it, but hearing Yin Changsheng confirm it still left him speechless.</p><p>He wanted to curse.</p><p>During this trip to the Sacred Ground, he had already shielded two people from disaster.</p><p>Bingyao was one thing.</p><p>He himself had been tempted by the Cleansing Pool and stepped into the trap on Bingyao's behalf. He had no one to blame but himself.</p><p>But he had no friendship with the Mixed Demon Elder, in fact, they were enemies.</p><p>Shielding an enemy from disaster was truly unjust.</p><p>"This humble Daoist..."</p><p>Qin Sang's thoughts raced, his mouth opened, and he was about to say something more.</p><p>Yin Changsheng suddenly let out a mocking laugh. "You want to stall for time?"</p><p>Before his voice faded.</p><p>The temperature in the cavern plummeted. A bone-chilling coldness permeated everything, extremely terrifying. Qin Sang felt as if his body and true essence were about to freeze.</p><p>'Whoosh! Whoosh!'</p><p>The ice spikes embedded in the ground were uprooted one after another, shattering in mid-air, transforming into a pale, cold mist, further intensifying the coldness in the area.</p><p>Qin Sang's heart was filled with alarm.</p><p>At the same time, Qin Sang, using the All-Seeing Heavenly Butterfly's divine ability, saw through the cold mist and discovered that thirteen ice mirrors had materialized at the top of the cavern.</p><p>Yin Changsheng had surely made preparations before pulling them in.</p><p>He had just used some to capture Tong Lingyu.</p><p>The thirteen ice mirrors were one of them.</p><p>'Clack! Clack!'</p><p>The thirteen ice mirrors flipped slightly, all aligning to face him and Liuli.</p><p>"Be careful, this is one of the Palace Master's strongest divine abilities, the Falling Nether Divine Restriction!"</p><p>Liuli's warning sounded in his ear.</p><p>Qin Sang did not know what the Falling Nether Divine Restriction was, but he instinctively reacted, activating the Wish-Fulfilling Treasure Pearl, a罡 cover protecting his body, while simultaneously summoning the demonic flames to stand guard.</p><p>Only then did Qin Sang clearly see the surfaces of the mirrors.</p><p>The interiors of the ice mirrors were not crystal clear. Within each mirror, special runes shimmered, forming patterns, similar to restriction diagrams. Qin Sang felt a sense of familiarity.</p><p>At this moment, Tong Lingyu's warning came from the Slaughtering Yin Blood Pool.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist, there is no need to fear. His Falling Nether Divine Restriction and my Cold Nether Nine Restrictions share the same origin. Your spirit fire can resist this divine ability! This person hid in the ice coffin, using a sinister technique, and has already been ensnared by inner demons. He cannot continue to act unrestrainedly, or he will bring about his own destruction. If Fellow Daoist can persevere, you can win without a fight!"</p><p>After the Ten Thousand Demons Assembly, Tong Lingyu had sparred with Qin Sang.</p><p>Confirming that Qin Sang could restrain her Cold Nether Nine Restrictions, she became even more determined to win Qin Sang over.</p><p>Yin Changsheng's cultivation far surpassed Tong Lingyu's, and the power of the Falling Nether Divine Restriction was naturally incomparable to the Cold Nether Nine Restrictions.</p><p>However, the spirit fire's restraining effect on the Falling Nether Divine Restriction could significantly weaken the divine ability's power. Qin Sang at least had a chance to resist and wouldn't be directly defeated by the divine restriction.</p><p>Hearing Tong Lingyu's reminder, Qin Sang's heart stirred.</p><p>What he feared most was not knowing his opponent.</p><p>If he only needed to hold on for a period of time, until Yin Changsheng lost control, with the Sun Divine Tree, he might have a chance.</p><p>He just didn't know how long this period would be!</p><p>'Ding ding...'</p><p>The ice mirrors vibrated, emitting a clear and melodious sound.</p><p>Before Tong Lingyu's voice had faded, the restriction diagrams within these ice mirrors shot out, manifesting in mid-air. The surrounding cold mist was drawn to the restriction diagrams, surging towards them frantically.</p><p>In an instant, the restriction diagrams materialized into reality, their power earth-shattering.</p><p>Qin Sang felt as if he had fallen into a small world of ice and snow controlled by Yin Changsheng.</p><p>Although it was an illusion, the terrifying pressure was real, even stronger than Tong Lingyu's Cold Nether Nine Restrictions from before.</p><p>Qin Sang's entire body stiffened. He gritted his teeth, channeling the demonic flames with all his might.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>The demonic flames split into two, one part flying towards Liuli.</p><p>Even in this situation, Qin Sang still split half of the demonic flames to protect Liuli.</p><p>If they followed Tong Lingyu's advice, the following battle would certainly be arduous. Helping his companion was helping himself.</p><p>Liuli also understood this principle, allowing the demonic flames to form a fire armor over her, activating the Ice Soul Divine Light, and joining Qin Sang in resisting the Falling Nether Divine Restriction.</p><p>'Boom! Boom! Boom!'</p><p>The restriction diagrams were like mountains of ice, crushing down horizontally.</p><p>The stone cavern shook violently.</p><p>The blinding cold light instantly enveloped them, the divine restriction erupting!</p><p>Qin Sang and Liuli were at the center of the vortex, their figures almost invisible. The fire armor dimmed, making one worry that they had already been swallowed by the divine restriction.</p><p>However, the true situation was not dire.</p><p>The Nine Nether Demonic Flames indeed had a restraining effect on the Falling Nether Divine Restriction. The Falling Nether Divine Restriction's strongest sealing ability was unable to take effect on them.</p><p>If this stalemate continued, it would be exactly what Qin Sang wanted.</p><p>Unfortunately, Yin Changsheng would not let them have their way.</p><p>"Eh? Interesting, it seems I underestimated you."</p><p>Seeing that the Falling Nether Divine Restriction had not restrained the two, Yin Changsheng's eyes narrowed slightly, examining the fire armor on their bodies, and beckoned with his palm towards the ground.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>The Four-Yoked Teng Snake Seal flew high.</p><p>The Teng Snakes danced, roaring silently, the powerful aura of the spirit treasure permeating the air, shaking one's soul!</p><p>Qin Sang's expression changed.</p><p>Earlier, seeing the Four-Yoked Teng Snake Seal casually tossed aside near the blood pool, Qin Sang had thought that Yin Changsheng was unable to control this spirit treasure.</p><p>It was said that the Four-Yoked Teng Snake Seal had always been wielded by the Grand Elder of the Profound Sky Palace.</p><p>Spirit treasures were unlike Dharma treasures, which anyone could refine. Without understanding the Treasure-Controlling Incantation, it was useless even if held in one's hand.</p><p>Qin Sang finally understood why Tong Lingyu had been defeated so miserably.</p><p>Your spirit treasure was given to you by someone else, what do you have to win with?</p><p>At the same time, the ice platforms within the blood pool creaked. The two ice platforms occupied by Tong Lingyu and Luo Yun slowly sank towards the bottom of the blood pool, blood threads forming a dense network across their bodies.</p><p>Tong Lingyu mustered her remaining strength, unable to stop it. The blood threads had already climbed up her neck.</p><p>It was as if countless blood-drinking worms were crawling on her snowy neck.</p><p>Qin Sang had been stalling for time, but Yin Changsheng had deliberately played along, thus completing the restrictions on Tong Lingyu and Luo Yun.</p><p>The Four-Yoked Teng Snake Seal's body disappeared.</p><p>Qin Sang saw a familiar scene.</p><p>Above the cavern, cold flames surged, vast and boundless, obscuring the sky. From within the cold flames came strange hissing sounds, surely the roars of the Teng Snakes manifested by the treasure seal.</p><p>Qin Sang was horrified.</p><p>The hissing sounds were ear-piercing and incessant. There were definitely more than one Teng Snake.</p><p>The same spirit treasure, in the hands of Tong Lingyu and Yin Changsheng, felt completely different.</p><p>Without even needing to engage in combat, Qin Sang could confidently say that facing the Four-Yoked Teng Snake Seal in Yin Changsheng's hands, even if he went all out, unleashing the demonic banner and the sword formation, he had no chance!</p><p>He could only use the Sun Divine Tree!</p><p>Qin Sang was secretly anxious. He had to conserve enough true essence to resist the Falling Nether Divine Restriction. He could only strike once with his full strength, and his incarnation could only strike twice.</p><p>Three chances, he had to either blast open an exit or shatter the blood pool!</p><p>The figures of the Teng Snakes were faintly visible within the cold flames.</p><p>At this moment, there was no way to hide any longer.</p><p>Just as Qin Sang touched the Qiankun Ring, about to summon the Sun Divine Tree.</p><p>The blood in the blood pool churned. Tong Lingyu, about to be sucked into the bottom of the pool, used her last ounce of strength to shout, "Liuli, quickly use the Treasure-Controlling Incantation I taught you!"</p><p>When fighting Yin Changsheng, Tong Lingyu realized that the Treasure-Controlling Incantation for the spirit treasure was actually divided into two parts.</p><p>Yin Changsheng possessed the complete Treasure-Controlling Incantation, but had only taught her the first part.</p><p>The Four-Yoked Teng Snake Seal was still firmly in Yin Changsheng's grasp.</p><p>Just as they started fighting, Tong Lingyu suffered a major setback.</p><p>However, Tong Lingyu was not unaware of this. She had prepared for so long, hesitating to act, one of her concerns being whether Yin Changsheng had tampered with the spirit treasure, allowing him to counter her.</p><p>She understood better than anyone how terrifying a cultivator wielding a spirit treasure could be.</p><p>Discovering that the Four-Yoked Teng Snake Seal was close to Liuli, Tong Lingyu secretly transmitted the Treasure-Controlling Incantation to her.</p><p>Now, having cultivated the Ice Soul Divine Light to Great Completion, she even possessed the qualifications to have the Four-Yoked Teng Snake Seal willingly acknowledge her as its master!</p><p>At the wedding ceremony, learning that Liuli's divine ability had reached Great Completion, Tong Lingyu was also extremely pleased. As long as the Four-Yoked Teng Snake Seal was given to Liuli to refine, there was a high chance of gaining the spirit treasure's recognition.</p><p>However, once a spirit treasure acknowledged a master, unless the master's mark was erased, even if others had cultivated the Treasure-Controlling Incantation, forcibly controlling it would greatly reduce its power. Tong Lingyu would lose her strongest means.</p><p>At that time, the Great Sage Sky Roc was leading the demon race to stir up trouble, and Tong Lingyu was overwhelmed, needing the ability to deal with a Demon Sage.</p><p>Liuli's cultivation was insufficient, and controlling the spirit treasure would limit its power. Moreover, gaining the spirit treasure's recognition was not instantaneous, requiring time to refine it.</p><p>She had originally planned to wait until after returning from the Sacred Ground, when she decided to act against Yin Changsheng, to consider whether or not to give the Four-Yoked Teng Snake Seal to Liuli.</p><p>Now it was too late to regret.</p><p>The spirit treasure had not yet acknowledged a master.</p><p>Even the person most compatible with the spirit treasure had to undergo refinement to gain its recognition. It was impossible to directly snatch it from someone else's hands during a fight, otherwise, who would dare use a spirit treasure?</p><p>Fortunately, Liuli had cultivated the first part of the Treasure-Controlling Incantation and had refined the Four-Yoked Teng Snake Seal for a period of time. Coupled with the spirit treasure's strong affinity for her, although she couldn't directly claim it as her own, she could form a constraint on Yin Changsheng.</p><p>Restraining his divine ability, restraining his spirit treasure.</p><p>Tong Lingyu's eyes revealed a glimmer of hope. She had prepared for so long, and although she had failed to kill Yin Changsheng, her efforts were not in vain, playing a crucial role at this moment!</p><p>Hope lay with Qin Sang and Liuli!</p><p>Although Liuli did not fully understand the situation, upon hearing Tong Lingyu's reminder, she unhesitatingly executed the Treasure-Controlling Incantation!</p>
