<h1>Chapter 1547: Mount Liuhxu</h1><p>The fat silkworm, having advanced to its fourth transformation—equivalent to a Nascent Soul cultivator’s level—hadn't seemingly developed any new abilities beyond its poison resistance.  Qin Sang had hoped for at least some defensive poison abilities, some combat potential.  Even something akin to the Sky Eye Butterfly's Sky Eye radiance would have been useful in a fight.  Instead, the fat silkworm was only effective in specific environments, like the three poisonous lands of the Qisha Hall, or against poison-using opponents like the frog-fish.  How could such a spirit insect survive in the perilous world of cultivation?</p><p>Forced by Qin Sang, the fat silkworm coughed up several balls of seven-colored light, its tongue hanging out, eyes glazed over, only managing to thicken its poison-resistant carapace.  Qin Sang gave up, turning to check on Ya Gu.</p><p>One glance told Qin Sang that Ya Gu was different. But the change wasn't outwardly visible. She was the same as before: rosy cheeks, closed eyelids, steady breathing – a sleeping beauty.  The change was in her spirit.</p><p>Qin Sang could clearly sense that Ya Gu’s spirit had become more stable.  This was clearly linked to the fat silkworm's advancement. The ‘anchor’ was stronger, allowing Ya Gu to firmly grasp the lifeline to light even in the face of the dark storms.  There might have been other reasons Qin Sang didn't understand. The connection between Ya Gu and the fat silkworm was far closer than he imagined.</p><p>Although Ya Gu couldn't respond, her condition had clearly improved. If not for the incident at Qisha Hall, she would be even better, perhaps even awake.  At least there was hope.</p><p>Qin Sang rubbed the fat silkworm's head.  If he could wake Ya Gu, even if the silkworm had no abilities, it wouldn't have been raised in vain.</p><p>‘Whizz!’</p><p>Finally free, the fat silkworm eagerly retreated into Ya Gu's brow and fell fast asleep.</p><p>Qin Sang remained, not rushing to leave. He hadn't moved far from the tribulation site, waiting to see if any cultivators were alerted by the heavenly tribulation. The silkworm’s tribulation had been unexpected and rushed, making it difficult to avoid attention.  A fourth-transformation spirit insect was exceptionally rare in the cultivation world.  News of it might attract Nascent Soul cultivators hunting for it, or even the attention of major sects.</p><p>Qin Sang’s prediction proved correct.  Soon, two figures approached from afar, an old man and a young man, appearing like grandfather and grandson, yet both possessing considerable cultivation. The younger man had the higher cultivation, mid-Golden Core stage, the elder slightly weaker.</p><p>“Just like that, attracting two Golden Core cultivators.  It seems the influence of Fudou County’s sects is not small…” Qin Sang thought, watching their movements.</p><p>The two headed straight for the tribulation site.  The tribulation clouds had dispersed, but the aura of the heavenly tribulation hadn't completely vanished. Qin Sang couldn't erase it entirely.</p><p>Experienced as they were, the two sensed the aura before approaching and immediately recognized it.</p><p>“Heavenly Tribulation!” They exclaimed, their eyes meeting in shocked realization.</p><p>Busy with something else, they hadn’t witnessed the tribulation firsthand.  Sensing an unusual energy fluctuation, they'd investigated out of curiosity, never expecting to find someone undergoing a tribulation.</p><p>Only Nascent Soul cultivators could trigger a heavenly tribulation—common knowledge.  A chill ran down their spines.  They regretted their recklessness and instinctively wanted to flee.</p><p>However, they had already seen the scene of the tribulation. The area was charred, the mountaintop almost leveled by the tribulation thunder, the entire mountain a wreck—a combination of the tribulation and Qin Sang's actions.</p><p>The devastation was clear, but there was no sign of the cultivator who had undergone the tribulation.  Remembering the relatively short duration of the thunder, they wondered if the mysterious Nascent Soul cultivator had failed.</p><p>Exchanging glances, they couldn't resist the temptation and cautiously approached, searching carefully but finding no Nascent Soul cultivator's remains, much to their disappointment.</p><p>“Let’s quickly report to Master Brother, the sect leader,” the young cultivator said. “We don't know which Nascent Soul senior passed by and underwent a tribulation here. Let the sect leader report it to the Liuhxu Sect. Maybe they can find clues.”</p><p>The elder stroked his goatee, agreeing. “That’s right. Regardless of the senior’s identity, it’s none of our business.  What a pity! Nothing left after the heavenly tribulation!”</p><p>“That senior might not have failed. Have either of us ever seen a real heavenly tribulation?”  The younger cultivator shook his head, sealing the mountain with a formation before signaling the elder and flying away.</p><p>Qin Sang stood not far from them.</p><p>The two were completely unaware that their conversation was being overheard.</p><p>Certain that the two hadn't actually seen the silver tribulation lightning, and had been misled into believing it was a cultivator's tribulation, Qin Sang decided against interfering, letting them leave.</p><p>News of a Nascent Soul tribulation disrupting the situation in Fudou County wasn't necessarily a bad thing; it wouldn't necessarily spiral out of control.</p><p>“Six Emptiness Sect…”</p><p>Qin Sang murmured, his figure flickering before vanishing.</p><p>Later, Qin Sang returned to Fudou County, selecting a refined residence at the Six States Hall, awaiting Zhou Jin's arrival.</p><p>Two months later.</p><p>Zhou Jin arrived as promised.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang, Zhou Jin was overjoyed, bowing deeply.  "Greetings, Senior Qin."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded.  "I didn't expect to be gone for nearly a decade. You've remained in Fudou County all this time. Have you discovered anything?"</p><p>Zhou Jin, worried about Ruan Yu's illness, had been anxious for ten years without news from Qin Sang, fearing the senior had met with an accident or forgotten the matter. He'd been constantly on edge, yet dared not slacken his efforts.</p><p>Thankfully, his worst fears hadn't materialized.</p><p>Suppressing his excitement, Zhou Jin spoke rapidly. "Following your instructions, Senior, I left Zezhou and came to this area, investigating the Pu Mountain and Xie family..."</p><p>Pu Mountain, the Xie family.</p><p>Related to the superior Daoist site recorded by Xiao Xiangzi.</p><p>The Daoist site, Qingxu Illusionary Realm, was located on Pu Mountain.</p><p>The Xie family, once boasting two Nascent Soul cultivators, held a prominent position even in the cultivator-rich Central State. Qingxu Illusionary Realm was extremely secluded, always controlled by the Xie family, unknown to outsiders.</p><p>Qingxu Illusionary Realm served not only as a secluded dwelling but also held other secrets.</p><p>Generations of Xie family descendants had painstakingly researched it, yet failed to unlock its secrets until one of their Nascent Soul cultivators befriended Xiao Xiangzi, impressed by his unique abilities.  They invited him into Qingxu Illusionary Realm, finally solving the mystery.</p><p>The jade slip didn't detail what benefits the three obtained within Qingxu Illusionary Realm.</p><p>Ironically, while sharing the treasure after unlocking the secret, the Xie family patriarch, overcome by greed, attempted to kill Xiao Xiangzi and seize the treasure for himself.</p><p>Xiao Xiangzi certainly hadn't yet broken through to the Transformation God stage at that time; otherwise, the Xie family patriarch wouldn't have been so reckless.</p><p>Even so, both Xie family Nascent Souls were killed by Xiao Xiangzi in retaliation.</p><p>Xiao Xiangzi didn't exterminate the entire Xie family.  Enraged, however, he wasn't willing to let them off easily, personally sealing Qingxu Illusionary Realm, preventing future Xie family members from entering.</p><p>Cooperation and betrayal were commonplace in the cultivation world.</p><p>Qin Sang was unsurprised.</p><p>Xiao Xiangzi didn't see anything wrong with his actions.</p><p>This betrayal ignited Xiao Xiangzi's murderous intent, nearly leading him to slaughter the entire Xie family and pushing him to the brink of demonic possession. This incident jolted him awake, making him aware of his inner demons.</p><p>His subsequent travels and the refining of Spirit-Subduing Incense allowed him to resolve the issue and eventually break through to the Transformation God stage.</p><p>Later, reflecting on his path, he realized the other Xie family Nascent Soul hadn't initially intended to betray him, but had been coerced by the Xie family patriarch.</p><p>Since the other party had chosen to attack him, regardless of their true intentions, Xiao Xiangzi couldn't afford to show mercy.</p><p>However, the anger from the betrayal had lessened considerably.</p><p>Xiao Xiangzi recorded this incident, hoping whoever received the jade slip would travel to Central State, find the Xie family, and, if the restriction on Qingxu Illusionary Realm remained, open it and return it to them, settling this grievance.</p><p>Qin Sang sent Zhou Jin to find the Xie family.</p><p>Firstly, to fulfill Xiao Xiangzi's request, and secondly, so he could cultivate in seclusion within Qingxu Illusionary Realm.</p><p>Time changes everything; names shift, power ebbs and flows.  Just as the destroyed cave dwelling in Sky Crack Valley and the renamed Zhu Lan Temple, even if the Xie family no longer existed and Qingxu Illusionary Realm had a new owner, Qin Sang wouldn't be surprised.</p><p>"After arriving, I traveled throughout Fudou County and the three surrounding counties, but couldn't find Pu Mountain.  Later, I learned that after Zhuozhou was incorporated into the Nineteen States of Smoke and Rain,  Mount Unremembered had overseen a large-scale geomantic survey, redrawing the boundaries of Zhuozhou and changing many place names.  I then sought out ancient texts…"</p><p>Zhou Jin's tone was bright, clearly indicating a discovery.  "Three years ago, I finally found 'Pu Mountain' in an ancient text. After much investigation, I confirmed that Pu Mountain was within Fudou County, now known as Luo Yan Mountain! However, the Luo Yan Sect, not the Xie family, now owns Luo Yan Mountain."</p><p>"Luo Yan Gate?"</p><p>Qin Sang's thoughts stirred. "Do the cultivators of this sect wear jade pendants engraved with the character 'Luo' at their waists?"</p><p>The two individuals drawn by the Fat Silkworm Heavenly Tribulation possessed such tokens.</p><p>Mount Pu had indeed changed hands, but it remained unclear whether Luo Yan Gate had discovered the Pure Void Illusionary Realm.</p><p>"Senior has met disciples of Luo Yan Gate?"</p><p>Zhou Jin nodded.  "Luo Yan Gate boasts numerous experts. I dared not act openly, so I could only secretly investigate the relationship between Luo Yan Gate and the Xie family.  I later discovered that Luo Yan Mountain was originally seized from the Xie family by Luo Yan Gate, forcing the Xie family to relocate and leading to their decline."</p><p>The deaths of two Yuan Ying masters and the loss of the Pure Void Illusionary Realm had stripped the Xie family of its foundation, causing its swift downfall.</p><p>Its survival to the present day, with its bloodline unbroken, was remarkably difficult, owing largely to the stable situation in the Central Plains.</p><p>Upon learning the Xie family's whereabouts, Zhou Jin immediately sought them out.</p><p>Now, the Xie family had become an unremarkable sect in the cultivation world, their current clan head only at the Foundation Establishment stage.  Their ancestral lands on Mount Pu had been usurped, its name changed, and they dared not utter a word of protest.</p><p>"I deliberately approached the Xie family and learned something," Zhou Jin paused, "When the Xie family relinquished Mount Pu, they made a deal with Luo Yan Gate.  The agreed-upon time has long since passed, yet Luo Yan Gate shows no sign of returning it.  Senior, if you wish to help the Xie family reclaim Mount Pu, you can begin here."</p><p>Zhou Jin mistakenly believes Qin Sang to be a long-lost member of the Xie family, returning to their ancestral lands to seek justice.</p><p>"Luo Yan Gate is very powerful?"</p><p>Qin Sang asked in return.</p><p>From Zhou Jin's tone, it seemed he couldn't force Luo Yan Gate to comply and return Mount Pu using his cultivation base alone.</p><p>Zhou Jin respectfully said, "Luo Yan Gate's sect leader is merely at the late Golden Core stage; Senior could easily eliminate them. However, there's something else to watch out for: Luo Yan Gate is backed by the Six Void Gate. The deal between Luo Yan Gate and the Xie family was witnessed by someone sent by Six Void Gate. I've been investigating their connection and discovered that the Luo Yan Gate sect leader has a close relationship with Six Void Gate.  Six Void Gate has three Yuan Ying elders; their power is formidable, making them the overlords of the surrounding prefectures.  Even Mount Bu Nian can't interfere, and the prefect of Fudu Prefecture has no control over matters outside the city."</p><p>Zhou Jin’s diligence extended even to uncovering the difficulties Qin Sang would face.</p><p>"Well done."</p><p>Qin Sang was quite pleased with Zhou Jin, keeping his promise and producing the jade slip containing the medicinal formula and a jade box.</p><p>Zhou Jin was overjoyed, quickly accepting both. Upon opening the box and seeing a spirit herb inside, he looked up in astonishment.</p><p>"This Black Essence Grass is the main ingredient in the formula. I unexpectedly found it in the Western Desert. This herb is extremely precious; even if you searched for it yourself, it would take at least ten years, possibly delaying treatment."</p><p>Qin Sang paused slightly, looking at Zhou Jin. "My sect is currently short-handed. If you're willing, you can bring Ruan Yu to Mount Pu for cultivation upon your return."</p><p>"Thank you, Senior!"</p><p>Zhou Jin prostrated himself in heartfelt gratitude.</p><p>Afterwards, Qin Sang carefully questioned Zhou Jin for details, pondering his next plan.</p><p>If it were only Luo Yan Gate, he could simply go there and drive them off the mountain, minimizing the impact. Now that Six Void Gate was involved, he needed to carefully strategize.</p><p>Of the three Yuan Ying cultivators in Six Void Gate, only one was at the mid Yuan Ying stage.</p><p>Attacking with his avatar would be swift, but the consequences would need consideration.</p><p>In the Central State, regardless of one's cultivation level, one couldn't act recklessly.</p><p>Furthermore, it was unclear if the Pure Void Illusionary Realm had been exposed; if it involved a struggle over a sacred site, things would become far more complicated.</p><p>After some deliberation,</p><p>Qin Sang instructed Zhou Jin to take him to the Xie family first.</p><p>…</p><p>The Xie family, driven from Mount Pu by Luo Yan Gate, lacked the strength to secure a good spirit vein and settled for an inferior one.</p><p>This accelerated their decline, depleting almost all their accumulated resources. Even their clan head failed to break through to the Golden Core stage, remaining stuck at the False Golden Core realm.</p><p>However, due to their past foundation, the Xie family's protective mountain formation retained considerable power.</p><p>"Clan Head Xie, a friend has come to visit."</p><p>Arriving at the Xie family stronghold, Zhou Jin channeled his true essence and called out loudly.</p><p>His voice carried into the Xie family compound.</p><p>Soon, the mist parted, and a figure emerged, Xie An, the Xie family head, his bearing quite impressive.</p><p>"Daoist Zhou, what a rare guest," Xie An approached quickly, his attitude extremely warm. Seeing Qin Sang beside Zhou Jin, and unable to sense his cultivation level, he felt a jolt of apprehension. "This Daoist friend is...?"</p><p>Zhou Jin coughed, saying, "This is Senior Qin."</p><p>"Senior!"</p><p>Xie An was stunned.</p><p>Zhou Jin was a Golden Core cultivator; the senior he referred to must be...</p>
