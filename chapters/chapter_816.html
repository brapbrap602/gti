<h1>Chapter 808: Quheng Island</h1><p>When Qin Sang continued to inquire, wanting to learn more,</p><p>Fellow Daoist Wang shook his head. "I've been traveling abroad for decades and haven't returned once during that time. Decades have passed, and things have changed drastically. Back then, I only heard rumors of such an extraordinary individual. Later, I knew nothing more. If you're interested, Fellow Daoist, I'll give you the location of Spirit Turtle Island. However, if the island master's temperament hasn't changed, it might not be easy to see him."</p><p>"Thank you, Fellow Daoist Wang."</p><p>Qin Sang noted down the address.</p><p>Fellow Daoist Wang wanted to hunt demons in the Demon Sea and asked Qin Sang for advice.</p><p>Qin Sang had spent several decades in the Demon Sea and had considerable experience. He immediately informed Fellow Daoist Wang of some precautions in detail. Both were pleased.</p><p>After chatting for a while longer, Qin Sang got up and said goodbye, returning to his cave.</p><p>He took out the sea chart of the southwest sea region, found the Gale Archipelago, and pinpointed the location of Spirit Turtle Island.</p><p>As Fellow Daoist Wang had said, Spirit Turtle Island was very remote. Without guidance, Qin Sang would never have imagined that Senior Qing Zhu would choose to establish his secluded cultivation grounds in such a place.</p><p>The imagery of peach blossoms had always been subtly connected to Senior Qing Zhu. Intuition told Qin Sang that it was best to see for himself.</p><p>However, Heaven Ascension Island and the Gale Archipelago were very far apart. A round trip would take years, and he needed to be wary of various hidden dangers along the way.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered in his cave for a long time, finally deciding to go personally. Acting decisively, he immediately began to prepare, purchasing necessary items, and setting off a few days later.</p><p>Before leaving, Qin Sang sent a message to Madame Liu's informant.</p><p>There had been no news from Madame Liu for over a year.</p><p>Ambushing the confidant of the Alliance Leader, being a late-stage Core Formation expert herself, could only mean waiting patiently for the right opportunity. But compared to killing Xiang Yi, finding Senior Qing Zhu was obviously more important.</p><p>Prepared, Qin Sang left Heaven Ascension Island alone. After traveling a certain distance, he summoned the Twin-Headed Hound, mounting the spirit beast to travel across the water.</p><p>Since he still hadn't figured out the effect of the spirit fruit, Qin Sang didn't dare to give it to the Twin-Headed Hound rashly. The Twin-Headed Hound was unwilling, but under Qin Sang's pressure, it could only obey.</p><p>One person and one beast embarked on a long journey to find someone.</p><p>Riding on the Twin-Headed Hound, Qin Sang's own cultivation wouldn't be delayed too much. Holding spirit stones, he comprehended the Killing Talismans during the day and refined his body with star essence at night.</p><p>Although he didn't take the busiest route, he would still encounter other cultivators on the way. Qin Sang ordered the Twin-Headed Hound to avoid them.</p><p>Most cultivators, upon discovering someone riding such a high-level demon beast, would wisely steer clear. Even experts who considered themselves powerful wouldn't dare to bother Qin Sang, given his aloof demeanor.</p><p>In fact, Qin Sang was only afraid of Nascent Soul Grandmasters.</p><p>In the vast sea, he shouldn't be so unlucky as to run into a Nascent Soul Grandmaster.</p><p>Following the planned route, he cultivated while traveling.</p><p>When encountering large islands along the way, Qin Sang would discreetly land and explore, resupply, and experience the local customs. He adhered to his principles, minimizing contact with local influential forces or major sects to avoid complications.</p><p>The journey was relatively smooth, and Qin Sang gained a lot of knowledge.</p><p>Continuing his journey, Qin Sang got closer and closer to the Gale Archipelago, already within the southwest sea region.</p><p>The southwest sea region was probably the most chaotic place in the Canglang Sea. The righteous and demonic sects had limited control here, and the Wu Clan forces were also involved, stirring up trouble.</p><p>Entering the southwest sea region, Qin Sang no longer dared to travel so openly, preferring to slow down.</p><p>"After nearly a year of refinement, the power of my wings has doubled, and my flight speed has increased significantly. It seems this path is the right one..."</p><p>Arriving in an uninhabited sea area, Qin Sang used his divine ability, flapping his wings, flying up and down over the sea.</p><p>Having complete control over his body felt more free and exhilarating than manipulating a magical artifact.</p><p>The Twin-Headed Hound followed behind Qin Sang, its large eyes full of confusion. It couldn't understand how this person could grow wings out of thin air. Could he also have demon beast bloodline?</p><p>After enjoying his flight, Qin Sang retracted his wings, landed on the Twin-Headed Hound, and took out the sea chart to check.</p><p>"Ahead is a place called Golden Ring Island, occupied by the Golden Ring Sect. This sect is the largest faction in the vicinity, with a dubious reputation, neither entirely righteous nor demonic. Their sect leader is a Nascent Soul expert. Let's just bypass it..."</p><p>Qin Sang drew an arc with his finger, pointing towards the Gale Archipelago, and ordered the Twin-Headed Hound to move forward.</p><p>After much meandering and stopping, he finally arrived in the waters near the Gale Archipelago.</p><p>Early one morning, Qin Sang and the Twin-Headed Hound appeared on the sea surface. With the light of the rising sun, they saw a long shadow appear ahead and stopped.</p><p>"Finally arrived!"</p><p>Qin Sang sighed from the bottom of his heart.</p><p>Drifting at sea for so long, even with his cultivation, he couldn't help but feel a little weary.</p><p>"This should be Serpent Island, the northernmost point of the Gale Archipelago. The slender island is like a tall wall, easy to recognize. Entering Serpent Island is equivalent to entering the Gale Archipelago. Quheng Island, where the largest city of the Gale Archipelago is located, is just over three hundred miles south of Serpent Island. The island master is appointed by both the righteous and demonic sects. This area is also the most stable place in the Gale Archipelago. I can go there to gather some information..."</p><p>Qin Sang recalled the Twin-Headed Hound, changed his appearance, concealed his aura, and set off discreetly.</p><p>Crossing Serpent Island, before long, a towering dark shadow came into Qin Sang's view.</p><p>Quheng Island was a mountain protruding from the sea. The slopes were relatively gentle. From afar, one could see rows of houses built around the mountain, the summit reaching into the clouds, with faint glimpses of palace-like structures.</p><p>From time to time, cultivators could be seen flying in and out of Quheng Island.</p><p>Qin Sang's figure flashed repeatedly as he ascended Quheng Island. He wasn't questioned and was allowed entry with a small amount of spirit stones, but he had to leave within a specified time unless he paid more.</p><p>Unlike other places in the Gale Archipelago, Quheng Island was not much different from Heaven Ascension Island, orderly and without much conflict.</p><p>Disguised as a low-level cultivator, Qin Sang inquired everywhere, gaining a more detailed understanding of the Gale Archipelago.</p><p>The Gale Archipelago was vast. If these islands were connected, they would be larger than the Wu God Continent, but unfortunately, the environment was far worse.</p><p>Especially in the southern part of the archipelago, storms frequently raged, bringing boundless sea fog that lingered year-round, along with powerful sea beasts. Such a place was naturally a haven for evil cultivators, and the situation could only be described as chaotic. Only the area around Quheng Island was barely considered a sanctuary.</p><p>But the righteous and demonic sects could only control this area.</p><p>Some cultivators wanted by the righteous and demonic sects hid in the depths of the Gale Archipelago, making them difficult to capture.</p><p>After understanding the situation in the Gale Archipelago, Qin Sang left Quheng Island that night, continuing south. Unexpectedly, as he approached Spirit Turtle Island, he was suddenly hit by a storm.</p><p>He descended from his flying light, stood on the water, and looked up at the sky.</p><p>To the southwest, the sky was dark and cloudy, like a ferocious beast, devouring everything at an alarming speed.</p><p>The calm before the storm, the air was filled with a chilling, suffocating tension.</p>
