<h1></h1><p>Chapter 1293: Good News </p><p>"I never thought I'd have the chance to see the Daoist again!"  </p><p>Shangguan Lifeng's expression was complex, a mix of joy at reuniting with an old acquaintance and a sense of restraint. Remembering something, he quickly asked, "I wonder where the other Daoist is now?"  </p><p>Qin Sang sighed, "Senior Yunyouzi passed away many years ago."  </p><p>Shangguan Lifeng fell silent, the feeling of inferiority in his heart fading slightly. At least he was still alive.  </p><p>'Boom!'  </p><p>In the distance, thunder rumbled, shaking the earth and mountains.  </p><p>Within the depths of the dark clouds, lightning danced wildly, bursting forth like a blazing sun, nearly tearing the clouds apart. The thunderous roar was deafening.  </p><p>Amidst the lightning, the faint silhouette of a giant falcon could be seen, its wings like clouds hanging from the sky, as if it were a divine bird commanding the thunder. It let out a sharp, piercing cry, soaring into the heavens.  </p><p>The sight was enough to make one's expression change, and the sound sent chills down one's spine.  </p><p>Qin Sang narrowed his eyes, recognizing that it was Jingyu unleashing her divine abilities. Such a shocking display must mean she had encountered a formidable enemy. His expression darkened as he said in a low voice, "This is not the time for catching up. You can find me later with this token... Be careful, fellow Daoist."  </p><p>Qin Sang tossed a token to Shangguan Lifeng, then with a flap of his thunderous wings, transformed into a bolt of lightning and charged into the dark clouds.  </p><p>Shangguan Lifeng opened his mouth, wanting to say something but hesitating. It wasn't until Qin Sang's figure disappeared from view that he realized he had forgotten to ask about Daoist Qingfeng's true identity.  </p><p>Daoist Qingfeng must have been an alias; otherwise, he would have heard of him before.  </p><p>He quickly flipped the token in his hand and saw the character 'Qin' engraved on it.  </p><p>Then he remembered the stunning phoenix wings on Qin Sang's back, which didn't seem real.  </p><p>Shangguan Lifeng suddenly thought of someone, his eyes widening in shock.  </p><p>"It's him!"  </p><p>...  </p><p>The Sin Abyss had long planned this ambush, setting up a killing array to lure their enemies into a trap.  </p><p>The Two Domains Alliance had fallen into the trap, and their defeat seemed imminent.  </p><p>Unexpectedly, Qin Sang and the others joined the battlefield, and with this variable, the situation quickly changed. After a fierce battle, the Sin Abyss's Nascent Soul cultivators, seeing that they could not gain any further advantage, had no choice but to retreat hastily.  </p><p>After the battle, Qin Sang and the other two were recuperating.  </p><p>"Thanks to the three of you, otherwise not only would we have suffered heavy losses, but the two of us might not have made it out alive," said one of the two Nascent Soul cultivators commanding this army. After regrouping the remaining troops, he came before them and bowed in gratitude.  </p><p>This person was a Left Elder from the Heaven's Path Alliance.  </p><p>The Left Elder was still shaken by the close call.  </p><p>The Sin Abyss's ambitions were immense this time. Not only did they want to annihilate this army, but they also aimed to take out the two Nascent Soul cultivators as well.  </p><p>"The situation was too favorable before, and we nearly forgot that the Sin Abyss was once a man-eating tiger. The slightest carelessness gave them an opening," the Left Elder explained with shame.  </p><p>Qin Sang stood up and said gravely, "It seems Old Demon Ye is still unwilling to accept defeat. This must have been a premeditated counterattack. I'm sure the Left Elder isn't the only one who was ambushed. However, the tide is unstoppable. They want to use this to halt our advance, but it's just wishful thinking!"  </p><p>Before he could finish speaking, another Nascent Soul cultivator hurried over. "I just received a message from the Daoist. Several other armies were ambushed like us. The Daoist ordered us to hold our ground and not retreat. Reinforcements will arrive soon..."  </p><p>Everyone exchanged glances.  </p><p>True One Elder's judgment aligned with Qin Sang's. This was the Sin Abyss's last gasp. As long as they crushed this offensive, the Sin Abyss would no longer have the strength to counterattack!  </p><p>The greater good took precedence.  </p><p>There was no time to meet with Shangguan Lifeng.  </p><p>After receiving the news, Qin Sang and the others left the Left Elder to handle the aftermath while they immediately set off to support other battlefields.  </p><p>Qin Sang and Jingyu barely rested, rushing from one battlefield to another.  </p><p>The Two Domains Alliance advanced with unstoppable momentum. Even when they suffered temporary setbacks, they were not easily routed. Most of them managed to hold out until reinforcements arrived, then organized counterattacks, preventing a complete collapse.  </p><p>This was a major battle that lasted two days and two nights.  </p><p>After the battle, heavy rain poured down.  </p><p>The rain washed away the bloodshed of the past two days.  </p><p>The Sin Abyss's final wave of attacks was repelled, and seeing that they had no chance left, they finally ceased their assault.  </p><p>This battle was the heaviest loss the Two Domains Alliance had suffered since the counteroffensive began, but it also ignited their ferocity. They soon delivered an even more brutal counterblow to the Sin Abyss.  </p><p>...  </p><p>Two months later.  </p><p>Since the major battle, the situation had rarely seen any significant fluctuations.  </p><p>Before the Sin Abyss launched their invasion, the central region of the great plain was a buffer zone between the Sin Abyss and the Heaven's Path Alliance, a disputed area. Now, the Two Domains Alliance's army had crossed this region and was advancing into the heart of the Sin Abyss.  </p><p>Wherever the army passed, cities and spirit mines that once belonged to the Sin Abyss changed hands. Seeing the benefits, the Two Domains Alliance naturally had no intention of stopping.  </p><p>After discussions among the Nascent Soul cultivators, they concluded that the Sin Abyss was likely planning to retreat to their stronghold. They decided to press on relentlessly, driving the Sin Abyss completely out of the plains.  </p><p>As for invading the Sin Abyss's stronghold, everyone knew it was unlikely. It would provoke the Sin Abyss cultivators into a desperate fight, and even if the Two Domains Alliance won, the cost would be devastating.  </p><p>The Heaven's Path Alliance and the Sin Abyss had deep-seated hatred, and some were eager to push forward. However, the cultivators from the Minor Cold Domain remained calm and had little interest in such madness.  </p><p>The biggest winner of this war was undoubtedly the Minor Cold Domain.  </p><p>Regardless of other benefits, the resources on the plains, which the Minor Cold Domain had no access to before, were now directly divided in half. They also gained a passage into the desert. Moreover, the Minor Cold Domain's homeland had never been touched by war. The Sin Abyss had been blocked at the Heaven's Path Plateau, and the Minor Cold Domain had only contributed manpower and resources.  </p><p>An unnamed small city.  </p><p>An army had stormed in, driving out the Sin Abyss cultivators, and was now resting in the city.  </p><p>City Lord's Manor.  </p><p>Li Yufu held a token and hurried into the most secluded courtyard in the manor.  </p><p>After his last seclusion, Li Yufu had successfully broken through to the mid-Golden Core stage.  </p><p>Despite the continuous battles recently, Li Yufu felt no fatigue. During this period, he even smiled while meditating.  </p><p>Li Yufu remembered his master's evaluation of his senior brother back in the day and was filled with admiration. When the two were only at the Foundation Establishment stage, his master had already seen the potential in his senior brother.  </p><p>After this war, the Two Domains Alliance's spoils would undoubtedly include a share for Qin Sang. With just a few mines on the plains, it would be enough to support the development of a sect.  </p><p>Under Qin Sang's guidance, he and Mei Gu had been searching for disciples among the rogue cultivators to join the Green Goat Sect. Using Qin Sang's name, they had attracted quite a few talented individuals.  </p><p>It was easy to imagine that once Qin Sang announced the establishment of the sect, the Green Goat Sect would instantly become a force that no one could ignore!  </p><p>This was all the work of his senior brother!  </p><p>"I never thought we'd fulfill our master's wish so quickly..."  </p><p>Li Yufu's heart was at ease, no longer plagued by doubts. He focused entirely on cultivation.  </p><p>He understood that these were just temporary gains.  </p><p>In the long river of time, countless sects had risen and fallen like fleeting flowers.  </p><p>The Green Goat Sect's foundation was still shallow, but such foundations couldn't be built overnight. Even with his senior brother's immense capabilities, it was impossible. The responsibility lay with their generation!  </p><p>Li Yufu gripped the token tightly, his expression resolute. He approached the courtyard and gently activated the restriction, saying softly, "Senior Brother, the old friend you mentioned is outside the City Lord's Manor, requesting an audience with you."  </p><p>Qin Sang's voice came from within, "Oh? He's finally here. Bring him in..."  </p><p>"Yes!"  </p><p>...  </p><p>Qin Sang walked out of the meditation room, condensing earth into stone to form a table and chairs.  </p><p>This was the first time Shangguan Lifeng had visited since their last meeting.  </p><p>Qin Sang hadn't sent anyone to look for him, as if he had forgotten about the man. However, he had been secretly investigating Shangguan Lifeng's character and had gained some understanding of his conduct.  </p><p>A moment later, Li Yufu led Shangguan Lifeng in. After bowing, he quietly withdrew.  </p><p>"Qin... Senior."  </p><p>Shangguan Lifeng hesitated for a moment, then bowed deeply, only to feel a gentle force supporting him.  </p><p>"We met in humble circumstances. There's no need for such formality. From now on, just call me Daoist Qingfeng. It sounds more familiar..."  </p><p>Qin Sang smiled and pointed to the stone stool opposite him. "Sit!"  </p><p>"Thank you, Daoist, for the seat."  </p><p>Shangguan Lifeng sat down as instructed, but his demeanor remained stiff.  </p><p>Qin Sang sighed inwardly. The gap in their cultivation levels was too great. Their relationship could never return to what it once was. Even if he wanted to treat Shangguan Lifeng as an equal, Shangguan Lifeng wouldn't dare accept it.  </p><p>He examined his old friend.  </p><p>Shangguan Lifeng sat upright, his attire more akin to a mortal swordsman than a Golden Core cultivator.  </p><p>He wore tight-fitting clothes, and his treasured blade wasn't stored within his body but slung across his back. The blade was sheathed, but one could faintly sense an extremely sharp sword intent emanating from it, as if it thirsted for blood the moment it was drawn!  </p><p>This was Shangguan Lifeng's unique secret technique—nurturing sword intent.  </p><p>"Fellow Daoist, have you encountered some trouble?"  </p><p>Qin Sang noticed the hesitation in Shangguan Lifeng's eyes and asked directly.  </p><p>Shangguan Lifeng seemed caught off guard, as if his thoughts had been exposed.  </p><p>After deciding to visit Qin Sang, Shangguan Lifeng had been uncertain about how to broach the subject. They were old acquaintances, but they had only collaborated once.  </p><p>Two hundred years had passed since their last meeting. How much difference was there between them and strangers?  </p><p>Shangguan Lifeng didn't believe that this bit of camaraderie would make a Nascent Soul ancestor treat him differently, especially since Qin Sang had recently saved his life.  </p><p>If Qin Sang were capricious, overstepping his bounds could lead to dire consequences.  </p><p>Shangguan Lifeng steeled himself and suddenly stood up. "Please forgive my rudeness, Daoist. I wish to ask for your guidance once more."  </p><p>Qin Sang looked thoughtful. He had already discerned Shangguan Lifeng's intentions.  </p><p>Before Qin Sang could ask, Shangguan Lifeng volunteered his story. "When we parted last time, Daoist personally demonstrated the killing intent within sword techniques, and I was deeply captivated. Since then, I've kept it in mind, unable to forget. Later, I happened to encounter a great war and threw myself into the battlefield, seeking that killing intent. After a hundred years of bitter struggle, I finally grasped a fraction of it. If not for this, I might not have faced so many hardships and might have formed my Golden Core much earlier. But I have no regrets! However, after breaking through to the Golden Core stage, I can no longer see the path ahead..."  </p><p>Shangguan Lifeng summoned his treasured blade into his palm, gently stroking it, his eyes filled with confusion.  </p><p>After listening, Qin Sang nodded slightly. He looked at Shangguan Lifeng, then at the blade in his hand, and suddenly asked, "You say you've pursued this for a hundred years. But are you truly devoted to the path of killing, or are you in love with the blade itself?"  </p><p>Hearing this question, Shangguan Lifeng's expression froze. He opened his mouth but couldn't speak, instantly breaking into a cold sweat. Beads of sweat rolled down his face, and his lips trembled.  </p><p>"I..."  </p><p>'Clang!'  </p><p>Without warning, a sword cry rang out.  </p><p>Shangguan Lifeng was startled. All the scenery in the world vanished, including Qin Sang. The only thing in his vision was a single flying sword!  </p><p>The sword was perfect, every curve just right, thin and translucent like glass.  </p><p>This was his first thought.  </p><p>Then, to his horror, he realized that the sword had appeared right in front of him, so close that its tip was almost touching his brow. He hadn't even seen the sword's trajectory before it was at his forehead.  </p><p>This experience was completely different from the last time.  </p><p>There were no sweeping sword energies, not even the slightest hint of killing intent.  </p><p>It was the epitome of simplicity!  </p><p>Yet Shangguan Lifeng felt as if he had been severed from the world. No matter how hard he tried, he couldn't escape this sword. Of course, he didn't have the ability to escape.  </p><p>His bones creaked, his hands felt as heavy as mountains, his eyes bloodshot, and his face flushed red. He couldn't move.  </p><p>On the brink of death, the terrifying pressure didn't shatter Shangguan Lifeng's Dao heart. Instead, he roared inwardly, his eyes wide open, staring fixedly at the sword before him.  </p><p>"Ah!"  </p><p>Shangguan Lifeng's veins bulged, his expression ferocious. Finally, he let out a hoarse roar.  </p><p>With all his strength, he channeled his true essence into his blade and slashed out with all his might!  </p><p>'Whoosh!'  </p><p>Amidst his roar, a blade light shot through the air like a rainbow, striking the flying sword squarely.  </p><p>In the next moment, both the blade light and the sword vanished.  </p><p>Along with them, the pressure on Shangguan Lifeng disappeared.  </p><p>"Huff... huff..."  </p><p>Shangguan Lifeng leaned on his blade, gasping for breath. He felt utterly drained, as if all his true essence had been consumed by that single strike.  </p><p>"Chirp... chirp..."  </p><p>Birds chirped in the sky.  </p><p>A few birds flew past, oblivious to the strange events in the courtyard.  </p><p>Shangguan Lifeng woke as if from a dream, returning to reality. He sheathed his blade and bowed deeply. "Thank you, Daoist, for your guidance."  </p><p>This strike hadn't dispelled all his confusion, but it had cleaved through the endless fog, allowing him to catch a glimpse of a different landscape.  </p><p>However, this experience seemed different from the last time, though he couldn't quite pinpoint how.  </p><p>Shangguan Lifeng attributed it to the difference in their cultivation levels.  </p><p>Still, Shangguan Lifeng liked this feeling. It seemed to be what he had been searching for all along.  </p><p>"An old friend of mine practiced the same cultivation method as I did. Based on that method, he created a sword scripture. What you just experienced was the first move of that scripture," Qin Sang said lightly.  </p><p>Shangguan Lifeng was stunned.  </p><p>Qin Sang stood up and walked toward the meditation room. "When you've figured out the answer to that question, come find me again."  </p><p>Shangguan Lifeng understood that Qin Sang was seeing him out. He cupped his hands slightly and left the courtyard.  </p><p>Li Yufu was waiting outside. Seeing him emerge, he gestured and said, "Senior Brother instructed me to prepare a meditation room for you. Please follow me."  </p><p>"Thank you, fellow Daoist," Shangguan Lifeng said absentmindedly.  </p><p>Li Yufu noticed something was off and grew curious. What had his senior brother done to him?  </p><p>Would this person join the Green Goat Sect in the future?  </p><p>If so, the Green Goat Sect would have three Golden Core cultivators. Moreover, this person had some reputation, and Senior Brother seemed to value him highly. He might even have the potential to reach Nascent Soul.  </p><p>After that day, Shangguan Lifeng didn't seek out Qin Sang again.  </p><p>Qin Sang didn't rush him, giving him time to think.  </p><p>Since ancient times, blades and swords have been spoken of in the same breath. For low-level cultivators, the difference between the two isn't significant—both are weapons of slaughter. But as one's cultivation level rises, the gap between them becomes as vast as heaven and earth.  </p><p>If Shangguan Lifeng wasn't willing to abandon the blade for the sword, teaching him the "Green Bamboo Sword Scripture" would be futile. Unless he possessed the extraordinary talent of Senior Green Bamboo, who could comprehend sword scriptures and blade techniques simultaneously, it would be nearly impossible.  </p><p>But Qin Sang thought the chances were slim. Given Shangguan Lifeng's limited lifespan, he didn't have much time left. Over two hundred years, he would need to prepare diligently for Nascent Soul formation while also creating his own blade techniques. How difficult that would be!  </p><p>Shangguan Lifeng's strength lay in his unwavering focus, which was a talent in itself.  </p><p>If he could continue down the path Senior Green Bamboo had forged, he might still achieve something remarkable. That was why Qin Sang was willing to give him a chance.  </p><p>However, the hardest thing in the world is to make choices, especially when it concerns one's own path of cultivation.  </p><p>...  </p><p>The Two Domains Alliance continued to conquer cities and strongholds, pressing forward step by step.  </p><p>During this period, news kept pouring in. The Two Domains Alliance had almost figured out the Sin Abyss's intentions. They planned to abandon the plains entirely and retreat to their stronghold, fortifying Yu City.  </p><p>Late at night.  </p><p>In the grand hall.  </p><p>Qing Jun was engrossed in a magical sand table that depicted the three domains.  </p><p>At that moment</p><p>Although he had obtained the Nascent Soul Puppet Talisman, he lacked the knowledge to control it. If he were to plot to seize the secret techniques of the Upper Primordial Tranquility Palace, Dongyang Bo would undoubtedly interfere, causing unforeseen complications. Fortunately, his senior sister, Qing Jun, was highly skilled in the art of puppetry and had devised a solution.</p><p>"However..." Qing Jun's tone suddenly shifted. "Even if we transform it into a Puppet Seal, we cannot alter its inherently malevolent nature. This is precisely why the successive generations of patriarchs in the Upper Primordial Tranquility Palace have been unable to tame it. Given your current cultivation level, controlling it would still be extremely perilous. It would be best to find a treasure that can protect your primordial spirit."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, frowning. "Even you, Senior Sister, cannot resolve the chaotic soul shadows within the puppet talisman? If we could refine all the soul shadows and merge them with the puppet, wouldn't its power increase?"</p><p>"You're correct, but it's nearly impossible. Unless we can understand why this puppet talisman is so unique—how it can seal soul shadows and endure to this day," Qing Jun replied, examining the puppet talisman for a long while before sighing. "I've pondered this for a long time but found no clues. In my opinion, the reason likely lies not in the restrictions within the puppet but in the puppet itself!"</p><p>This idea aligned with Qin Sang's own intuition. The world of cultivators was filled with countless strange artifacts, and they had encountered many treasures they had never seen before. Moreover, the puppet talisman was heavily restricted and had long since lost its original form, making it difficult to trace its origins.</p><p>Qin Sang took the puppet talisman, which Qing Jun had shrunk and handed to him. "I've already completed part of the transformation using a secret technique. Now, I'll teach you this Puppet Seal. It will take some time, but you can follow the steps to convert the talisman into a Puppet Seal. Take it back and refine it yourself. These soul shadows are of no use to me. However, try to sense as many soul shadows as possible. It will undoubtedly help you overcome your bottleneck, and you might soon break through to the mid-stage."</p><p>"Thank you for your kind words, Senior Sister," Qin Sang said, looking at the puppet talisman in his hand. Whether he could succeed as smoothly as Qing Jun suggested would depend on the puppet talisman and the Corpse Flower Blood Amber.</p><p>Qing Jun then taught Qin Sang the Puppet Seal. The art of puppetry, like sword arts and alchemy, was complex and profound. Without dedicating significant effort to understanding it, one could hardly achieve anything noteworthy. Fortunately, Qing Jun had laid the groundwork, and Qin Sang only needed to memorize the Puppet Seal and a few key precautions.</p><p>After learning the Puppet Seal, Qin Sang was about to take his leave when he suddenly sensed something and stood up abruptly. "Brother Bai is here!"</p><p>The Corpse Talisman within Bai's body had been crafted by Qin Sang, and the two shared a connection that allowed them to sense each other when nearby. Qin Sang was both surprised and concerned. Bai had just emerged from seclusion and suddenly appeared on the battlefield. Had he encountered some difficulty, or had he successfully broken through to become a Corpse King?</p><p>Qin Sang quickly bid farewell to Qing Jun and flew out of the hall, heading toward the city's outskirts. The army was stationed within the city, heavily guarded, so Bai dared not enter. Instead, he triggered a restriction outside the city, alerting Qin Sang.</p><p>Qing Jun watched Qin Sang's retreating figure, her brows slightly furrowed as if deep in thought. She glanced in the direction of the Sin Abyss before returning to her meditation chamber to enter a state of deep concentration.</p><p>"Senior Qin!"</p><p>"Greetings, Senior Qin!"</p><p>Qin Sang did not fly directly out of the city, adhering to his own rules. Instead, he dashed through the streets, and the cultivators he encountered along the way respectfully stepped aside and bowed. His mind preoccupied, Qin Sang soon arrived at the city gate. He showed his token to the guards and ordered, "Open the city gate's restrictions!"</p><p>"As you command!" The guards immediately complied.</p><p>It was late at night, and dark clouds covered the sky, obscuring any starlight. Qin Sang flew out of the city and scanned his surroundings, then soared dozens of miles before suddenly losing his connection with Bai. Immediately, an unexpected event occurred.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The grassland below exploded, creating a massive crater and sending dirt, rocks, and grass flying everywhere. Amid the chaos, a shadowy figure silently lunged toward Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang was initially startled but then laughed heartily. "Brother Bai, I'm no longer the same as before. Did you really think such tricks could ambush me?"</p><p>Before he finished speaking, eighteen demon banners flew out from his sleeve, swirling in the air and rapidly expanding. Demon flames surged forth, instantly forming a sea of fire. The shadowy figure, caught off guard, plunged into the flames and cried out in surprise, "When did you gain the ability to control all the demon banners?"</p><p>Qin Sang didn't answer, merely laughing as he taunted, "Dare to ambush me? Taste the power of demon flames!" With a hand seal, he directed the flames to converge around Bai, forming a fiery sphere.</p><p>"Relying on external tools is no feat of strength! Come down and fight me hand-to-hand!" Bai shouted defiantly from within the flames.</p><p>"Hand-to-hand combat? I might not fear you!" Qin Sang retorted, though his eyes betrayed a hint of surprise.</p><p>Within the flames, Bai wore a Daoist robe and appeared almost human, save for his pale complexion. Sensing the true power of the demon flames, he unleashed a surge of corpse energy, his body remaining unchanged. Unlike the Corpse Kings in the Immortal Tomb, he did not transform into a monstrous figure with fangs, claws, and black fur. Only his eyes turned blood-red, filled with a thirst for blood.</p><p>For a moment, the demon flames were held at bay, and even when a few flames licked his body, they caused no harm. An ordinary Corpse King would not have been able to withstand the flames so easily. It seemed Bai had gained significant benefits from the Corpse Soul Pearl and Bone Curse.</p><p>"I surrender! Your demon banners are too overpowered!" Bai shouted.</p><p>Qin Sang retracted the banners, and the two landed on the ground.</p><p>"Congratulations on advancing to Corpse King, Brother Bai!" Qin Sang clasped his hands in congratulations.</p><p>Bai waved his hand lightly and sighed, "I broke through too late. I must have missed many opportunities."</p><p>Qin Sang chuckled. "From the Abyssal Chasm to now, we've fought countless battles. Facing Elder Ye in the Blood Lake was especially perilous. What opportunities are you talking about?"</p><p>"Exploring secret realms is always an opportunity! Tell me all about your experiences in the Blood Lake," Bai urged eagerly.</p><p>"Let's return to the city and discuss it there," Qin Sang suggested.</p><p>As they flew toward the city, Qin Sang asked, "I wanted to guard you during your tribulation, but you boldly faced it alone. Did anything unusual happen?"</p><p>"I finally sensed the opportunity and couldn't wait for you, so I found a place to force the tribulation. It was different from yours—I nearly fell to the inner demon tribulation, but it turned out fine in the end," Bai said, his expression tinged with lingering fear.</p><p>"Your strength clearly surpasses that of an ordinary Corpse King. You must have been confident in overcoming the tribulation," Qin Sang remarked, then quickly added, "Now that you've advanced to Corpse King, has the Corpse Talisman within you been resolved? Why did I lose my connection with you earlier?"</p><p>"It's more or less resolved. The Corpse Talisman has merged with my primordial spirit, so it's difficult to shatter, but it no longer affects me. I spent so long in seclusion to deal with the Corpse Talisman's issues," Bai explained, extending his hand. His flesh gradually became transparent, revealing bones inscribed with strange patterns.</p><p>"The Bone Curse!" Qin Sang recognized it immediately.</p><p>Bai nodded. "While studying the Bone Curse, I realized that although it and the Corpse Talisman are entirely different, they share a subtle connection, as if they originate from the same source. I used the Bone Curse to harness the power of the Corpse Talisman. After countless failures, I finally succeeded."</p><p>"The Corpse Talisman is only at the Foundation Establishment level. I didn't expect it to be so troublesome!" Qin Sang exclaimed, realizing the talisman was more formidable than he had thought.</p><p>"The Corpse Talisman can at most refine a Flying Night Fiend, but that doesn't mean it's limited to that level. The powers of the Corpse Talisman and Bone Curse are just the tip of the iceberg, and their methods are highly unorthodox. None of the corpse-related secret techniques you've collected correspond to them. I racked my brains to uncover some clues. To truly understand their origins, we'll need to find that mysterious person in the water prison. These two techniques must have a significant background!"</p><p>Seeing the joy on Qin Sang's face, Bai's tone suddenly shifted. "Don't celebrate too soon. My method only works for me. Ya Gu's cultivation is too low to withstand the full power of the Bone Curse."</p><p>Qin Sang's smile froze. He had hoped Bai could help Ya Gu resolve the Corpse Talisman, allowing him to put the matter to rest.</p><p>"However, you needn't worry. I've devised a way to address the immediate issue. While it won't wake her, it can alleviate her condition, pulling her out of the darkness and restoring her to her state before the overexertion—perhaps even better. How much she recovers is uncertain, but that fat silkworm might help. Of course, to fully awaken Ya Gu, we'll need to find the mysterious person and obtain the complete technique," Bai explained.</p><p>Qin Sang breathed a sigh of relief. "That's still good news. Once the war is over, I'll send people to search for Tan Hao's whereabouts. We're almost at the city gate. For now, it's best you don't reveal yourself openly. Return to the Corpse Puppet Bag."</p>
