Chapter 1872: Adamantine Fruit


‘Whoosh…’
‘Bang! Bang! Bang!’

The flower fields trembled, mountains cracked, and giant boulders tumbled down. Just as they were about to smash into the flower beds, an invisible force flung them away.

Qin Sang was under immense pressure, sweat beading on his forehead.

As long as the Healing Platform remained turbulent, he dared not relax for a moment.

Multiple breaches had appeared in the flower field formation. Qin Sang summoned the Cloud Wanderer Sword, deploying the Seven Lunar Mansions Sword Formation to stabilize the array, but he couldn't reverse the flower field's collapse.

‘Boom!’

An unusual rumble echoed from the ground.

Qin Sang's expression changed drastically. His divine sense swept across the area, and he immediately discovered a tear at the edge of the flower field.

Immediately afterward, ripping sounds arose from all directions as the flower field began to shatter from the outside in.

After some deliberation, Qin Sang decided to concentrate the power of the flower field formation to protect the Flower Spirits, abandoning the outer areas.

‘Bang! Bang! Bang!’

Giant rocks broke free from the earth, mountain peaks crumbled, and cracks continued to spread inward.

The Flower Spirits were planted in clusters within flower beds built upon piles of white bones, located in the center of the flower field space.  However, their roots were interconnected with the earth's veins, and the damage to the outer areas would inevitably affect them.

Qin Sang had no better option.  Ensuring the Flower Spirits' survival was paramount. After the Healing Platform calmed down, he could slowly nurture them back to health. This was better than uprooting them entirely.

‘Rumble…’

Tremors continuously emanated from outside.

Qin Sang couldn't discern whether they originated from the illusionary storm, the battles raging outside, or both.

He looked up.  Illusions and auspicious clouds obscured the view beyond the Healing Platform. Although he couldn't see what was happening, a lingering sense of oppression weighed on his heart—a primal instinct, the fear of overwhelming power.

As expected, Nascent Soul Grand Masters must be engaged in a fierce battle. The Qi within the Healing Platform was too chaotic for Qin Sang to determine how many there were.

However, Qin Sang wasn't as tense as before. The initial pressure he felt had originated from above the Healing Platform, and it was gradually receding. The chances of the Healing Platform being further affected were diminishing.

Now, his only concern was the illusionary storm.

After a long while, Qin Sang sensed a change in the tremors and his face brightened.

"Finally weakening…"

In the next instant, the smile froze on Qin Sang's face. His hands swiftly formed seals, his True Essence surging as he poured all his effort into condensing nine spiritual seals, flicking them toward the formation's nine most crucial nodes.

Simultaneously, an incredibly powerful fluctuation erupted from the depths of the Healing Platform, triggering astonishing phenomena within all affected illusions.

‘Crack!’

A deafening thunderclap resonated throughout the space.

A fissure ripped through the earth, bisecting the entire landmass and nearly splitting the flower field in two.

Several flower beds were unfortunately situated along the fissure.  Fortunately, Qin Sang reacted swiftly, his wide sleeves sweeping out as he pulled the Flower Spirits from the ground, one by one.

‘Poof!’

The white bones crumbled into dust, rendering these flower beds practically useless.

The uprooted Flower Spirits tightly closed their buds, their spiritual light dimming, their vitality severely diminished.

Thankfully, that violent tremor was a singular event.

After the tremor, the illusionary storm seemed to have reached its limit, ceasing its expansion. The previous surge felt like a final burst of energy.

Tremors continued, but they were within a tolerable range.

Qin Sang waited a while longer, confirming that the storm likely wouldn't expand further.  Relieved, he glanced at the flower field below and descended.

Sweeping his gaze across the area, Qin Sang began his work, his figure flitting around the flower field as he examined the damaged parts of the formation.

Finally, Qin Sang selected spirit materials from the Qianjun Ring, summoned the Nine Nether Demonic Fire, and began refining formation tools on the spot to repair the array.

To fully restore the formation, he would need to return to Ju Mountain Prefecture and acquire more spirit materials.

After a period of intense work, Qin Sang activated the formation once more, and the barrier surrounding the space immediately stabilized.

Only then did Qin Sang have time to inspect the Flower Spirits.  After a thorough examination, he couldn't help but sigh.

The flower field was saved, but the Flower Spirits were in a precarious state.

Apart from those he had uprooted, the surviving Flower Spirits were also withered and listless, all having suffered damage.

Flower Spirits were inherently delicate. Even after the Healing Platform and flower field returned to normal, they would require time to recuperate. Before their recovery, the source of Flower Dew would be a problem.

"Fortunately, there are still the Poison Fruits…"

Qin Sang transplanted the uprooted Flower Spirits into other flower beds. These Flower Spirits would recover even slower, potentially taking centuries.

The illusionary storm’s impact on Qin Sang didn't end there.

Although the storm had stopped expanding, it hadn't subsided entirely. The tremors persisted, and the Qi within the Healing Platform remained incredibly chaotic.  This location was not spared.

Until the storm calmed, the Healing Platform was no longer suitable for cultivation; it could only serve as a place to cultivate flowers.

"It seems I must return to Sword Heart Island," Qin Sang mused.

After waiting for a long period, Qin Sang flew towards the edge of the formation, directly facing the impact of the tremors.

He left the flower field, traversing familiar paths.  What he saw was both familiar and strange.

The surrounding illusions had undergone various changes, and his past experiences weren't entirely applicable.

However, the eye of the storm wasn't nearby, so the changes weren't drastic. Some of the old paths were still traversable.

Qin Sang explored the area, cautiously venturing towards the center of the Healing Platform.

He followed the path he had previously forged, but the further he went, the more difficult the journey became. With the Heavenly Eye Butterfly’s assistance, Qin Sang pressed onward until he finally witnessed the illusionary storm with his own eyes.

Gazing through the fragmented illusions, he saw a gray expanse resembling a howling hurricane, its interior utterly chaotic.

Qin Sang's last shred of hope vanished.

The location of the Crimson Gold Spirit Needles was within the heart of the illusionary storm!

Even if he brought Mo Xingdao here, it would be impossible to find the scene matching his memory.

The path to ascension was unpredictable.

How long would it take for the illusionary storm to subside? Decades? Centuries? Even millennia? Would it ever return to its original state?

"Will I be forced to cultivate in this realm, relying on the Celestial Court?"

Qin Sang frowned, observing for a long while.  Suddenly, a glint flashed in his eyes as he fixated on a particular spot.

Gradually, Qin Sang's expression eased. He noticed that the storm was showing signs of receding, albeit slowly.  It was a good omen.

Moreover, as the storm receded, the illusions in that area seemed to be coalescing, indicating that their foundation remained.

"I wonder if the illusions at the storm's center can be restored. There might still be a chance. I must make the necessary preparations…"

Qin Sang thought of the Taiyi Star Carriage.

If he were to venture into the storm later, he might have to rely on the Taiyi Star Carriage.  He decided that once he broke through to late-stage Nascent Soul, he would devote all his energy to improving his refining skills and restoring the treasure.

Pondering these matters, Qin Sang observed for a while longer before retreating along the same path.  However, he didn't return to his cave dwelling; instead, he headed straight for the exit of the Healing Platform.

It was the tenth day after the great battle.

He seemed to be the only one left in the Healing Platform. He didn't encounter any other True Masters or Demon Marquises. When Qin Sang reached the auspicious clouds at the edge of the Healing Platform, using the Heavenly Eye, he saw that the outside world was silent and deserted.

Outside the Healing Platform stretched a vast plain. The towering mountains on the other side of the plain had been leveled, leaving the earth in ruins.

Although the battlefield had been cleared, the lingering stench of blood testified to the ferocity of the final battle.

He had deliberately delayed his exit to avoid being caught in the crossfire, so he was unaware of which side had emerged victorious.

The Qi on the battlefield was incredibly mixed and filled with the frenzied aura of ferocious beasts, making it difficult to discern anything.

Qin Sang looked up at the sky.

The sky was gloomy, as if a perpetual haze shrouded the land.

Qin Sang knew this wasn't a normal weather phenomenon but the lingering remnants of the Grand Masters' battle.

Sensing the residual aura, Qin Sang still felt a shiver of fear. It was undoubtedly left by Nascent Soul Grand Masters, and the chaotic Qi indicated that there were far more than two or three.

Judging by the remnants, the battlefield had steadily moved deeper into the Land of Evil.  The outcome remained unknown.

Qin Sang lingered outside the Healing Platform for a while before returning to his cave dwelling.  He needed to observe for a longer period before he could safely leave.

…

Inside the cave dwelling.

Qin Sang consumed a medicinal pill and sat in meditation to regulate his breathing.  Once his injuries had healed, he slowly awoke.

As the saying goes, misfortune may be a blessing in disguise, and fortune may harbor misfortune.

Qin Sang had lost much in this upheaval, but his gains were equally significant.

He had battled Demon Marquises, slain a Demon King, and after this battle, late-stage Nascent Soul was within reach.

True Master Zuo, in his attempt to recruit him, had imparted insights into the path to Soul Formation. However, due to the intervention of the Demon Saint and Great Saint, the final battle hadn't taken place, and Qin Sang had essentially benefited from the situation.

Although he still needed to exchange his battle merits for the knowledge, if not for the urgent circumstances, True Master Zuo certainly wouldn't have been so thorough.

Thinking of his gains, he couldn't help but recall the beginning of it all.

The Qianjun Ring shimmered, projecting two beams of golden light that landed in Qin Sang's palms, glowing brilliantly.

The Adamantine Fruits were quite heavy.

"Adamantine Fruit, the fruit of the Adamantine Bodhi Tree, embodying the essence of the Treasure Tree, ranked among the Ten Divine Trees, renowned as the most坚硬 and unyielding wood in the world…"

Information about the Adamantine Fruit flashed through Qin Sang's mind.

It was said that treasures refined using Adamantine Fruit were incredibly durable, almost indestructible.  Using it to refine a sword wasn't considered a waste, however. Weapons crafted from Adamantine Fruit were exceptionally sharp, specifically designed to break through defensive techniques.

"Although there are only two, they can significantly enhance the Cloud Wanderer Sword's blade…"

Qin Sang thought, summoning the Cloud Wanderer Sword and putting away one of the fruits.

‘Hum!’

The spirit sword hummed, its light enveloping the Adamantine Fruit.

The sentient sword seemed to recognize the fruit's value, appearing eager.

Qin Sang smiled, silently circulating his profound arts and guiding the Cloud Wanderer Sword to absorb the divine wood.

The sword light drew the Adamantine Fruit from Qin Sang's palm, slowly lifting it into the air. The fruit rotated within the sword light, its outer skin beginning to ‘melt.’

Witnessing this long-awaited scene, Qin Sang couldn't help but feel a surge of emotion.  He focused his mind and devoted all his energy to controlling the sword.

Finally, the Cloud Wanderer Sword transformed into a sword embryo, engulfing the Adamantine Fruit and converting it into the purest form of spiritual wood energy, gradually absorbing it.

The sword embryo hovered before him.

Qin Sang carefully sensed it, nodding after a moment.

The Cloud Wanderer Sword had already advanced to a spiritual treasure and was no longer what it used to be.  The speed at which it absorbed divine wood far surpassed its previous capabilities. It wouldn't take long to ‘digest’ this Adamantine Fruit.

He put away the spirit sword.

Next, Qin Sang retrieved his other spoils of war one by one, meticulously categorizing them. Then he remembered the two captives he had in the Healing Platform.

The spirit of a female demon and a Demon Marquis under the command of the Spirit Nether King.

Keeping them with him while cultivating in the Healing Platform would be inconvenient. Since he had decided to return to Sword Heart Island, he could leave them there.

The path to ascension was uncertain, and he only had Mo Xingdao as an assistant. He needed more manpower.

Both demons were pragmatic and shouldn't be difficult to subdue.

However, Qin Sang didn't rush to release them.  He rose, walked out of the cave dwelling, glanced around, and then soared out of the flower field.

Two months had passed, and the tremors caused by the storm persisted. The surrounding illusions were slightly more stable than before.

After some travel, Qin Sang arrived above the blue sea of light. He looked down at the surface, sensed the area, and then plunged into the sea.

He descended rapidly.

Qin Sang headed straight towards the location of the hidden valley. When he arrived, however, all he saw was endless blue.

The valley had vanished.

Unwilling to give up, Qin Sang searched the surrounding area for a long time, even resorting to consuming his lifeblood to enhance the Heavenly Eye Butterfly's abilities. Yet, he found no trace of the valley.

Hovering above the seabed, Qin Sang fell into deep thought.

The Adamantine Bodhi Tree hadn't vanished like the other bubbles. Qin Sang had a hunch that they still existed, but he didn't know where.

Although the hidden valley had appeared here, there might be other entrances elsewhere.

However, the blue sea of light was vast, and the pressure he felt here was immense. Searching inch by inch would take an unknown amount of time.

"I'll return when I have the opportunity."

Qin Sang transformed into a streak of lightning, bursting out of the sea. He returned to his cave dwelling to check on things and then flew towards the exit of the Healing Platform.

Outside the Healing Platform, all was silent.

Unsure of the current situation, Qin Sang didn't dare head directly to Star Island Immortal Lake. He first traveled west, making a large detour, and finally reached Ju Mountain Prefecture via White Stone Prefecture.

He was cautious along the way and encountered no incidents, smoothly arriving at White Stone Prefecture. There, he immediately sensed a tense atmosphere.

After some inquiries, he learned that the Celestial Court and the Ghost Fang Kingdom were amassing troops along the Yellow Springs Path, and war was imminent.

One piece of news puzzled Qin Sang.

Not long ago, the Celestial Court had announced that the Palace Master of the Yin Heaven Palace had joined the Northern Dipper Exorcism Court and been bestowed the title of Third Rank Nine Heavens Golden Gate Celestial Immortal, Nine Heavens Inspector. The Northern Dipper Exorcism Court had held a grand celebration at the Healing Platform for this occasion, and a True Monarch had even issued a decree, showering the Palace Master with honors.

In Qin Sang's understanding, True Monarchs didn't involve themselves in worldly affairs.  The Third Rank was the highest rank among Celestial Court officials, true rulers of a prefecture.

Third Rank Celestial Immortals were undoubtedly few and far between. Even with late-stage Soul Formation cultivation, without sufficient merit and seniority, one might not qualify.

The relationship between the Celestial Court and the Daoist sects and temples was delicate. Although True Masters from various sects could hold positions in the Celestial Court, it would likely be very difficult for them to reach such a high position.

What qualifications did the Yin Heaven Palace Master possess?

Moreover, the Yin Heaven Palace was also a Daoist sect, located on the Yellow Springs Path, dedicated to slaying demons and eliminating evil, undoubtedly supported by the Celestial Court.

The two were already closely aligned. Wasn't this gesture redundant?

Qin Sang couldn't comprehend it.  Carrying his doubts, he returned to Ju Mountain Prefecture.  The atmosphere there was even more tense than in White Stone Prefecture.

Once war broke out, Ju Mountain Prefecture would be on the front lines, and cultivators lived in constant fear.

Upon entering Star Island Immortal Lake, Qin Sang was even subjected to an inspection.  He had to present the Sword Heart Island token given to him by True Master Zhi Jian to be allowed passage.

Returning to Sword Heart Island, the Sword Servant sensed the formation being activated and immediately came to greet him.

"This old servant greets True Master."

Despite their long acquaintance, the Sword Servant still performed a full bow.

Qin Sang had tried to dissuade him several times without success. Resigned, he let him be, landing on the shore and looking towards True Master Zhi Jian's cave dwelling. "Is Fellow Daoist Zhi Jian on the island?"

The Sword Servant nodded. "Master has been in secluded cultivation and hasn't emerged. If True Master has urgent matters, this old servant will awaken him."

"There's no need! I intend to cultivate on Sword Heart Island.  Inform me when Fellow Daoist Zhi Jian emerges from seclusion."

Qin Sang shook his head, stopping the Sword Servant, and walked towards his own cave dwelling.

Qin Sang had initially wanted to inquire about the relationship between True Master Zhi Jian and True Master Zuo, but there would be plenty of opportunities later. It wasn't urgent.
