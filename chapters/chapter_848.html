<h1>Chapter 840: Demonic Qi</h1><p>Chapter 840: Demonic Qi</p><p>Truly a powerful demon, its physical body was incredibly strong.  The strange scales covering its body possessed a peculiar power, preventing Xingluo from killing it outright.</p><p>Naturally, Qin Sang wouldn't stop there.  Seizing the opportunity, he retracted Xingluo, his figure flashing as he closed in on the fish demon's crippled body.</p><p>The two-headed beast blocked the fish demon's escape route.</p><p>At the last moment, the fish demon's eyes burned red as it left behind two hateful glares. Then, using some unknown secret technique, it self-destructed!</p><p>The self-destruction of its physical body resulted in a bloody explosion, sending a wave of blood mist outwards.</p><p>This wave not only contained immense power, but also seemed to possess a corrosive force.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression changed, his figure halting abruptly. He hastily channeled his ebony sword, slashing out a protective wall of sword energy to resist the impact.</p><p>Then, a tremendous force struck, tearing through the sword energy. Qin Sang retreated, forced to evade the blast.</p><p>The two-headed beast was too close and failed to dodge in time, only managing to roar angrily as it retreated, using its abilities. Green energy surged around it, resisting the blood mist.</p><p>Fortunately, the fish demon was already heavily wounded, its self-destruction greatly weakened. The two-headed beast was fast enough that the blood mist was stopped by its green energy as it approached.</p><p>Its fur was mottled and corroded by the blood mist, making it look disheveled, but thankfully it remained unharmed.</p><p>However, the blood mist was incredibly strange; a portion of it penetrated the green energy, turning it a mixture of green and red, attempting to burrow into the beast's body.</p><p>The two-headed beast struggled to cleanse the blood mist. Though it prevented further corrosion, complete removal proved difficult.</p><p>Just as Qin Sang and the two-headed beast were in this predicament, a blood-red streak suddenly shot from the blood mist, speeding towards the beast horde and escaping at an incredible pace.</p><p>"The demon pill?"</p><p>Qin Sang's expression shifted. The fish demon hadn't died, it had simply self-destructed, leaving behind its escaping demon pill.</p><p>It was now too late to stop its escape.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't pursue.  His priority was to escape; several powerful auras were drawing near.</p><p>A disembodied fish demon posed little threat.  Qin Sang merely glanced at the blood-red streak and ignored it, flashing to the two-headed beast's side to check its condition.</p><p>The blood mist wasn't a serious threat, but like a clinging poison, it was difficult to completely remove.</p><p>Qin Sang feared the blood mist carried the fish demon's power, allowing it to track them.</p><p>Being hunted by the fish demon and its horde would be a major problem.</p><p>Considering this, Qin Sang had an idea and summoned the Nine Netherworld Demon Fire.</p><p>The blood mist proved no match for the demon fire, being consumed by it, emitting a foul stench.</p><p>"Kill! Kill them! I will eat their flesh, drink their blood!"</p><p>The fish demon, having narrowly escaped death, screamed madly amongst the horde, consumed with hatred for the one responsible for its maimed state.</p><p>Fueled by the fish demon's cries, the other beasts went into a frenzy, charging at Qin Sang.</p><p>The blood mist finally cleared. Qin Sang and the two-headed beast fought their way through, using the ebony sword to carve a bloody path through the horde!</p><p>The major demons hadn't arrived yet; the lesser demons were no match for Qin Sang and the two-headed beast.</p><p>The few powerful auras, having witnessed the fish demon's near-death experience, seemed startled and hesitant, losing the opportune moment to attack.</p><p>The disembodied fish demon, struggling for survival, didn't dare pursue, watching helplessly as Qin Sang cut through the horde, his distance growing. Its cries grew increasingly furious and shrill.</p><p>Qin Sang charged outwards, throwing a scroll upwards after a short distance.</p><p>The flying flowers created an illusionary landscape, confusing the surrounding lesser demons and causing them to lose their target.</p><p>In the midst of the beast tide, this illusion wasn't very effective and easily broken.</p><p>However, for Qin Sang, it provided sufficient cover.</p><p>He recalled the two-headed beast and activated the Heavenly Demon Transformation!</p><p>"Whoosh!"</p><p>A pair of phoenix wings unfurled behind him, his aura shifting dramatically, the demonic energy emanating from his body becoming incredibly dense.</p><p>This was a peculiar change Qin Sang discovered after cultivating this technique.</p><p>Since beginning to cultivate the "Heavenly Demon Refinement", even before he could use the Heavenly Demon Transformation, this change had been gradually happening.</p><p>Previously, to disguise himself and appear weak to his enemies, he had intentionally taken a Demonic煞妖丹 pill, already possessing a faint demonic aura.</p><p>Therefore, he hadn't initially noticed the change within himself.</p><p>Having broken through the second level of the *Tian Yao Lian Xing* technique, Qin Sang felt his demonic aura had intensified.  Upon mastering the Tian Yao Bian transformation, he was astonished to discover his demonic aura was almost as strong as a demon beast at the Yao Ling stage.</p><p>This strange change initially worried Qin Sang, fearing the technique would transform him into a beast. After a long time, however,  he confirmed that besides the aura, his body hadn't changed, and suspected his phoenix wings were the cause.</p><p>With his demonic aura and magnificent wings resembling a Azure Phoenix, Qin Sang felt he could easily pass for a powerful transformed demon. Trapped in the beast horde, he conceived a plan: using Tian Yao Bian to deceive the demons and escape.</p><p>His cultivation was only at the second level of *Tian Yao Lian Xing*, meaning Tian Yao Bian was imperfect and couldn't fool powerful demons. However, it might deceive less intelligent lesser demons.  Having been pursued by the fish demons for so long, the escape route opened by Jin Guang had closed, leaving Qin Sang to find his own way out.</p><p>Sure enough, his illusion was immediately disrupted by the horde. In the next moment, Qin Sang and his double-headed… (the original text is illegible here) …were lost.</p><p>Wrapping himself in his wings, he blended into the horde.  Emerging quietly, he was surprised to find the demons were less hostile. The demonic aura from Tian Yao Bian was actually masking his presence!</p><p>Treated as one of their own, he faced less resistance, making his escape less conspicuous amidst the chaos.  When the fish demon and its followers arrived, they were furious to find Qin Sang had vanished. Even the most sensitive demons, with their keen sense of smell, couldn't find him – he had seemingly disappeared.</p><p>Enraged, the fish demon, unable to devise a solution, abandoned the idea of keeping the treasure for itself and urgently contacted the leopard demon.</p><p>Once he’d escaped, Qin Sang relaxed, skillfully weaving through the beast horde until he reached the outer edge, finally seeing the night sky and stars.  He didn't realize that Tian Yao Bian had altered his aura, inadvertently saving him from a great calamity.</p><p>…</p><p>While Qin Sang escaped, the Shang Meng members were engaged in a desperate battle. Surrounded by a large number of powerful demons, including intelligent and formidable ones like the crane demon, they faced a relentless and well-coordinated assault. Even their skilled warriors struggled against this fierce attack, quickly finding themselves in a dire situation.</p><p>Madam Liu and Jin Ying deeply regretted not leaving with Qin Sang, unaware that they were inadvertently involved in his predicament.</p>
