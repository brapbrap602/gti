<h1>Chapter 491: Body Snatching</h1><p>Feitian Yecha raised a hand and pressed it against the stone door.  Corpse energy surged, touching the restriction.</p><p>A cold snort came from within the stone chamber.</p><p>“Didn’t I tell you, unless it’s a matter of earth-shattering urgency, don’t disturb me!”</p><p>That voice…</p><p>Qin Sang’s heart stirred, his brow furrowing slightly.  He found the voice strangely familiar, bearing some resemblance to Ji Wu’s, yet utterly unlike his usual tone.</p><p>At this moment, there was no time for such trifles.</p><p>Qin Sang dismissed the thought and immediately ordered Feitian Yecha to break the restriction with all its might.  Simultaneously, he mobilized the power of the Ten Directions Yama Array.  Ghost flames erupted from the formation, surging toward the stone door to assist Feitian Yecha.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>With a tremendous roar, the restriction on the stone door shimmered faintly before being brutally shattered.</p><p>The heavy stone door, unable to withstand the force, was then smashed to pieces by Feitian Yecha’s claw.</p><p>Stones flew, and dust filled the air.</p><p>Undeterred, Feitian Yecha charged ahead, bursting into the chamber. Qin Sang’s gaze pierced through the dust, swiftly scanning the room for Ji Wu.</p><p>His plan was to kill Ji Wu first, then concentrate on dealing with the Jiupao Daoist, giving himself a fighting chance.</p><p>Qin Sang was extremely tense. This was a fleeting opportunity.  He could only succeed by catching his opponents off guard, before they could unite their forces.</p><p>He had to seize this moment!</p><p>The stone chamber was empty.</p><p>Its furnishings were extremely sparse; only a meditation cushion lay on the floor.  A spirit gathering array was also present; Qin Sang could see the entire layout at a glance.</p><p>The scene inside the chamber astonished Qin Sang.</p><p>He easily located Ji Wu, seated on the cushion, but the Jiupao Daoist was nowhere to be seen.</p><p>Even if the Jiupao Daoist’s physical body was destroyed, his golden core or primordial spirit should still be present.</p><p>There was nothing but Ji Wu!</p><p>“Who are you?”</p><p>Caught completely off guard, Ji Wu remained impassive, sitting motionless on the cushion, his chilling gaze fixed on Feitian Yecha and Qin Sang.</p><p>His expression and tone were unlike anything Qin Sang had ever witnessed.</p><p>Ji Wu’s aura was incredibly powerful.  Facing his gaze, Qin Sang felt a tightness in his chest.  He had only felt such pressure from Nascent Soul stage cultivators.</p><p>At this moment, although Ji Wu’s appearance was identical to before, Qin Sang was certain—they were absolutely not the same person!</p><p>Qin Sang paused, suddenly understanding.</p><p>“Body snatching?”</p><p>Qin Sang was utterly amazed.</p><p>The Jiupao Daoist had chosen to seize Ji Wu’s body, and it seemed he had succeeded.  Ji Wu had been completely transformed into a different person; calling him the Jiupao Daoist was more accurate now.</p><p>No wonder!</p><p>No wonder the Jiupao Daoist treated Ji Wu like a son, supporting his cultivation relentlessly, even when he himself was gravely injured and desperately needed medicine, pushing Ji Wu to the False Core stage.</p><p>Ji Wu had been a vessel prepared by the Jiupao Daoist for himself!</p><p>The Jiupao Daoist's plan was excellent. Ji Wu must have been carefully chosen.  Once his golden core was restored and Ji Wu broke through to the False Core stage, he would perform the body snatching, changing his identity.</p><p>Then, under Ji Wu’s identity, he could move openly in Xiao Han domain without fear of pursuit by the Yuanzhao sect.</p><p>Qin Sang guessed that the Jiupao Daoist's recall of Huang Shizhong wasn't purely coincidental.</p><p>This plan was incredibly thorough. Perhaps, over the years, during Ji Wu’s cultivation, the Jiupao Daoist had subtly planted his influence.</p><p>Qin Sang sighed. Ji Wu had traveled far and wide, diligently searching for medicinal herbs to heal his master—the Jiupao Daoist, whom he revered.</p><p>Ji Wu had barely escaped from Zhantian Peak, yet he sacrificed the Xuanzhen Pill and chose the Gui Fu Pill instead.</p><p>At the moment of truth, what was Ji Wu thinking?</p><p>In the afterlife, would he be able to rest in peace?</p><p>Seeing no response, the Jiupao Daoist glanced outside the stone chamber and asked again, “It seems Mo Yan has fallen at your hands! My Moyan sect seeks no conflict with the world; Ji, I do not know either of you. I wonder what grievances you two have against us, that you would dare attack our sect and kill our elite members!”</p><p>“Ji?”</p><p>Qin Sang sneered, refusing to waste words with the Jiupao Daoist. He simply growled, “Kill!”</p><p>The Jiupao Daoist had been attacked, yet instead of retaliating immediately, he sat calmly, asking about grievances and possible resolutions. Qin Sang didn't believe the Jiupao Daoist was so patient.</p><p>He must have a reason for not, or unable to, get up, attempting to buy time with words.</p><p>Perhaps the body snatching wasn't complete, or the restorative pill hadn't fully taken effect!</p><p>Qin Sang had no obligation to answer Jiupao's questions, nor would she reveal her identity.  She acted decisively, ordering the Flying Night Rakshasa to attack!</p><p>The Flying Night Rakshasa unleashed a surge of corpse energy, stepping into the stone hut and disappearing in a flash.</p><p>Jiupao, realizing his plan was discovered, changed his expression immediately.  His eyes narrowed, filled with resentment, as he glared at Qin Sang. "With a mere, insignificant corpse puppet, you dare act recklessly before me? You don't know what you're doing!"</p><p>Before he finished speaking, Jiupao's figure flickered, finally leaving his meditation cushion.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>The Flying Night Rakshasa arrived, but its sharp claws only tore through Jiupao's afterimage.</p><p>Then, the Flying Night Rakshasa suddenly swung its arm.</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>A muffled sound echoed.  The Rakshasa had expelled a blast of corpse energy, forcing Jiupao, who was trying to ambush Qin Sang from the shadows, into the open.</p><p>Simultaneously, Qin Sang moved swiftly, hiding behind the Flying Night Rakshasa and deploying the Ten Directions Yama Array beside her.</p><p>The first clash between the Flying Night Rakshasa and Jiupao seemed evenly matched.</p><p>"Flying Night Rakshasa!"</p><p>Jiupao, abandoning his attempt to kill Qin Sang, steadied himself. He stared intensely at the Rakshasa, then turned his gaze towards where Qin Sang was hiding. His eyes flickered, his disguise dropped. "The Ten Directions Yama Banner! Who are you?! To enter without triggering the spirit array… I must know you!"</p><p>Qin Sang, hidden within the array, felt both surprise and relief.</p><p>Relief that the Flying Night Rakshasa hadn't let her down; even if it couldn't win, escape was possible.</p><p>Surprise that Jiupao, having just undergone body snatching, still possessed terrifying strength, showing no signs of injury.  Had the restorative pill completely healed his wounds?</p><p>Ignoring Jiupao's question, she continued to command the Flying Night Rakshasa to attack relentlessly.</p><p>*Bang! Bang! Bang!*</p><p>In the dark stone hut, only two dark figures could be seen moving with incredible speed, their identities indistinguishable.  The sounds of impacts were constant, wild spiritual energy flying everywhere.</p><p>The hut's protective formations, already damaged by Qin Sang, were now riddled with holes.</p><p>*Rumble!*</p><p>Finally, unable to withstand the assault, the stone hut collapsed.</p><p>Qin Sang, sheltered within the array, used ghostfire to assist the Flying Night Rakshasa, a small contribution at best.</p><p>However, she still hadn't used her two magic treasures.</p><p>As the battle continued, Qin Sang noticed that Jiupao wasn't as strong as he appeared. His displayed strength wasn't as terrifying as the true Golden Core cultivators she had encountered before.</p><p>An opportunity!</p>
