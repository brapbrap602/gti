<h1>Chapter 576: The Full Story</h1><p>Chapter 576: The Full Story</p><p>It's important to know that each level of the Outer Palace is fraught with peril.  Places like the Immortal Tombs require even Dongyang Bo and Chen Yan to proceed cautiously.</p><p>Yun Youzi's aura hasn't changed much; he's clearly still at the False Core stage!</p><p>Qin Sang looked at Yun Youzi intently.</p><p>Yun Youzi has always been an enigma, though nothing too outlandish.  And since Qin Sang himself kept secrets, he never delved too deeply.</p><p>Everyone has secrets and taboos.  Unnecessary probing easily turns friends into enemies.</p><p>Yun Youzi has never betrayed him, in fact, he's helped him greatly. Qin Sang wouldn't be so ungrateful as to repay kindness with treachery. He's ruthless, yes, but only towards his enemies.</p><p>Now, Qin Sang finds Yun Youzi increasingly inscrutable.</p><p>Passing through the Outer Palace levels and reaching the Inner Palace this quickly is impossible for a normal False Core cultivator, even a Golden Core expert would struggle!</p><p>Could Yun Youzi be hiding his strength?</p><p>Is his cultivation comparable to a Nascent Soul cultivator?</p><p>This thought startled Qin Sang. He chided himself for such a preposterous idea.</p><p>Yun Youzi's background is well-known. His mortal life in the Great Sui Dynasty is verified by Abbot Jixin. His path after joining the Taiyi Danzong is even clearer.</p><p>From Qi Condensation to Foundation Establishment, then False Core.</p><p>He's climbed every rung of the ladder, a well-known arduous journey.</p><p>Qin Sang himself was involved in many of these events.</p><p>If Yun Youzi was hiding his strength, maintaining this deception for so long makes no sense.</p><p>Perhaps he discovered a shortcut into the Inner Palace.</p><p>"I pushed myself to the limit and only just arrived.  I didn't want to miss out on this, my friend,"</p><p>Yun Youzi let out a sigh of relief, then continued, "Let's go straight to pick the Crimson Cloud Purple Fruit. We arrived so quickly that the others may not even be here yet."</p><p>With that, Yun Youzi used his movement technique to dash towards the ancient medicinal garden.</p><p>Qin Sang had been about to ask a question indirectly, but decided against it. Whatever secrets Yun Youzi holds, as long as they weren't directed at him, it was fine.</p><p>He suppressed his curiosity and followed silently.</p><p>Noticing Qin Sang's gaze lingering on the ancient city ruins, Yun Youzi spoke, "Qin, you find that palm print odd as well, don't you?"</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, sighing deeply, "Such a terrifying palm print…whose is it? Could the legendary giants, those who could tear apart dragons and phoenixes, really have existed?"</p><p>This palm print didn't seem to be caused by spiritual energy.</p><p>The fingerprints and palm lines are clearly visible, more like an imprint from a fleshy hand.</p><p>This is what shocked Qin Sang.</p><p>How powerful of a body could obliterate an immortal city with a single palm strike?</p><p>Cultivating the body to such an extent is unheard of.</p><p>Qin Sang suspects that even at his peak, he couldn't even pierce this being's skin; it would be like tickling him.</p><p>The cultivation world isn't without body refinement techniques, but these methods require massive resources, including but not limited to various precious spiritual herbs and treasures.</p><p>Those unconventional methods have severe limitations and are extremely difficult to cultivate.</p><p>In today's cultivation world, resources are scarce, so it's incredibly difficult to follow this path – far harder than orthodox cultivation.</p><p>Even cultivators who attempt body refinement generally do so after achieving high cultivation, and only then begin to consider the refinement techniques. With powerful backing, gathering resources becomes much easier.</p><p>However, cultivating both body and cultivation simultaneously might lead to a rapid increase in combat strength in the short term, but in the long run, the divided focus will ultimately hinder progress.</p><p>"Not necessarily giants," Yun Youzi shook his head, "In the ancient cultivation world, those who pushed body refinement to its limits possessed the divine ability of 'Transforming into Heaven and Earth.'  Great powers wielding this ability could transform into Heaven and Earth itself, moving mountains and seas; leaving such a mark wouldn't be unusual.”</p><p>Transforming into Heaven and Earth?</p><p>Qin Sang fell silent, realizing his own ignorance and insignificance more and more.</p><p>This world, revealed to him partially through Ziwei Palace, unveiled a new layer of reality.</p><p>The mysterious barrier at the edge of the Ancient Immortal Battlefield, the Immortal Tombs in the Ziwei Palace Outer Palace, and now the palm print in the Inner Palace – each surpasses Qin Sang's wildest imaginings.</p><p>Whose sacred relics are these that persist to this day, astounding the world?</p><p>Mahayana cultivators?</p><p>Or perhaps…immortals?</p><p>"That single palm strike utterly destroyed the immortal city.  Nascent Soul cultivators once searched the city, finding some surviving artifacts, but without exception, all were powerless. It's said this wasn't due to the passage of time but a terrible force that directly destroyed the artifacts' essence, most likely from the palm print."</p><p>Yun Youzi's tone held awe and longing.</p><p>The two fell into thoughtful silence.</p><p>After a while, Yun Youzi broke the silence.</p><p>"Qin, these things are far removed from our present concerns.  What matters now is healing our hidden injuries."</p><p>While the likelihood of encountering competitors is low, we should still be prepared.</p><p>"With the Wuxia Pearl at full power, it can restrain a Yuan Dan stage cultivator for a while, the duration depending on the cultivator's level...</p><p>"I also have some understanding of ancient restrictions.  If we encounter enemies, I can try to use them to trap our opponents, buying you time."</p><p>Qin Sang looked at Yun Youzi in surprise. The Wuxia Pearl had such power, it could even restrain a Yuan Dan stage cultivator? Had it already transformed into a magic weapon?</p><p>Yun Youzi spoke with great confidence. He never boasted, so it should be believable.</p><p>Since Yun Youzi was helping him gather herbs and had volunteered this information, Qin Sang decided to reveal some of his secrets. "Senior, I have a Xuantian Thunder. If it comes to it, I'm willing to trade it for the Jiangyun Purple Fruit. I also control a flying Rakshasa-level corpse puppet. Having it clear the way and break the restrictions will definitely speed things up considerably."</p><p>After this trip, I can form my Golden Core.</p><p>Cultivating corpse arts isn't a major issue for Golden Core cultivators, as long as I don't act recklessly, slaughter ordinary people or other cultivators. My sect would turn a blind eye.</p><p>There's no need to hide it anymore.</p><p>"Xuantian Thunder! Flying Rakshasa!"</p><p>Yun Youzi was startled, his face full of astonishment as he looked at Qin Sang. "I've met many False Core cultivators, but I've never seen one as secretive as you. Even Golden Core cultivators who underestimate you will suffer a great loss! Did you obtain the secret method for refining the Flying Rakshasa in the ice cave?"</p><p>Qin Sang knew he couldn't hide it from Yun Youzi, so he answered vaguely, "Consider it so. Thanks to the senior's guidance."</p><p>Yun Youzi chuckled.</p><p>"I've long suspected you possessed corpse refinement techniques, and that your Flying Rakshasa shares the same origin.</p><p>"Are you wondering why I haven't questioned you?</p><p>"In my view, there is no inherent good or evil in methods, only in the person using them.</p><p>"Don't misunderstand my investigation, I know you're not inherently wicked.</p><p>"Using decisive methods to kill those who deserve it, while upholding your principles and maintaining your bottom line – that's what cultivators should strive for!"</p>
