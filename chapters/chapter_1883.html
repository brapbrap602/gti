<h1>Chapter 1874: My Heart's Desire</h1><p>Qin Sang put down the jade slip, hesitating. "On the battlefield, with Grand True Cultivators and Demon Kings clashing, I fear a junior like myself would have no place to contribute…"</p><p>Zuo Zhenren smiled. "If Grand True Cultivators and Demon Kings could completely dictate the war's outcome, they would simply duel each other directly. Why such a grand mobilization? Moreover, there are overt and covert conflicts beyond the battlefield where deploying Grand True Cultivators is inconvenient.  Aside from those Demon Kings who have severed their cultivation, I imagine few among the Demon Marquises could be a match for Fellow Daoist… You needn't worry about encountering a Demon King. They will certainly be in secluded cultivation, focusing all their energy on restoring their cultivation base. Otherwise, it would be losing the greater for the lesser!"</p><p>It was evident that Zuo Zhenren and the others also held this view, which explained their high regard for Qin Sang.</p><p>In Zuo Zhenren's eyes, Qin Sang's strength lay not only in his Spiritwood Body but also in his escape techniques, rivaling even Ling You Wang. As long as he didn't encounter a Demon King, he could come and go freely.</p><p>Such individuals were incredibly valuable during wartime, and even within the two academies of the Dao Court, they were few and far between.</p><p>After a pause, Zuo Zhenren looked at the contemplative Qin Sang and added, "Is Fellow Daoist worried that, not being a direct disciple of our Immortal Sect, you might face ostracism within the Dao Court?  Desperate times call for desperate measures.  In these tumultuous times, anyone who dares to be envious of virtue and ability is defying the world, opposing the Dao Court, and opposing me!"</p><p>Zuo Zhenren's eyes widened slightly as he slapped the table.</p><p>In truth, Qin Sang wasn't worried about this. Zuo Zhenren's personal recommendation spoke volumes.</p><p>He had a Grand True Cultivator backing him, one who was a meritorious contributor to the Dao Court who had severed his own cultivation. Even if someone harbored ill intentions, they would have to think twice.</p><p>Exploiting the chaos of the battlefield to seize advantages was within Qin Sang's plans.</p><p>However, not now.</p><p>"Senior's kindness is overwhelming; this junior is deeply honored."</p><p>Qin Sang rose and bowed before continuing, "To be honest, my battle with Ling You Wang was fraught with peril, yet also a mixture of fortune and misfortune. Amidst life and death, my spiritual platform became clear, and I gained some enlightenment.  Later, guided by Senior's insights, I was greatly inspired. Now, I'm eager to enter secluded cultivation and digest what I've gained."</p><p>These words were not false.</p><p>Over the past year, Qin Sang had reflected on himself and felt his path ahead widening. The fierce battle at the Healing Platform had greatly benefited his cultivation. He had a premonition that all he lacked was accumulation.</p><p>Zuo Zhenren understood and nodded slightly. "In that case, Fellow Daoist should prioritize your cultivation. Only then can you better serve the Dao Court in the future.  Rome wasn't built in a day, and the flames of war won't ignite instantly."</p><p>After some thought, Qin Sang decided to probe Zuo Zhenren's thoughts.  "In Senior's view, how long can this current stalemate last?"</p><p>"Hmph! If my strength were sufficient, I would attack the Great Sage Mansion this very instant! Those demons may appear arrogant, but they are merely bluffing. The Ghostfang Kingdom has been secretly withdrawing its forces, intending to avoid battle."</p><p>Zuo Zhenren's face showed anger as he slammed the table. "They stole the treasure and now want to hide like turtles?  There's no such easy bargain in this world!"</p><p>Qin Sang was unaware of what exactly the Ghostfang Kingdom had stolen, but judging by Zuo Zhenren's tone, the Dao Court seemed to have suffered a significant loss.</p><p>"Since Fellow Daoist has made up your mind, I won't insist. Please accept this token.  When you've reached a decision, bring this token to me. I will remain cultivating at the Healing Platform."  Zuo Zhenren handed over a golden token.</p><p>The token was engraved with the character 'Zuo'.</p><p>Qin Sang thanked him, accepting the token with both hands. Seeing that Zuo Zhenren was hinting at his departure, he bowed and excused himself.</p><p>Leaving the golden hall and returning to the platform, he saw the golden-armored guard waiting for him.</p><p>The two rode the cloud qi, returning the way they came.</p><p>Exiting the White Stone Healing Platform, Qin Sang glanced back before blending into the bustling streets.</p><p>He pondered the previous exchange, ensuring there were no flaws.</p><p>This trip had been quite fruitful. His relationship with the Dao Court had deepened, and having secured Zuo Zhenren as a backer, future actions would be much easier.</p><p>Perhaps due to Zuo Zhenren's influence behind the scenes, Qin Sang's reward for slaying Ling You Wang, exchanged for insights into Void Refinement cultivation, had even yielded a surplus, but he didn't intend to use it now.</p><p>Passing through streets and alleys, he entered a verdant mountain within the Immortal City.</p><p>The familiar courtyard came into view – it was Grandmaster Gu's residence. Qin Sang's mind flashed back to the letter, and he gently activated the restriction on the gate.</p><p>"Who is it?"</p><p>"Ah! Senior is back!"</p><p>Cheerful laughter came from the back of the courtyard, followed by two streaks of azure light flitting to the gate. Two elegant young women in turquoise robes appeared, beaming at Qin Sang with delight.</p><p>"Are you Feng'er and Yan'er?"</p><p>Qin Sang looked at the two young women. Their features were somewhat familiar; they were the two Dao Child attendants he had met before.</p><p>Last time, they were six or seven-year-old Dao Children, delicate and charming. Now, they looked no older than seventeen or eighteen.</p><p>Their actual ages were, of course, greater than that. Cultivating within the Gu residence, they had few opportunities to venture out. Unsullied by the world, they remained innocent and carefree.</p><p>"Mm!"</p><p>"Mm!"</p><p>The two girls nodded vigorously, opening the restriction without announcement. Yan'er whispered, "Master is refining tools."</p><p>Qin Sang smiled. After spending more than a year together, they still remembered him.  Perhaps the parting gifts were still working their magic.</p><p>Surrounded by the two girls, Qin Sang walked familiarly towards the guest hall, their chatter filling his ears.</p><p>Qin Sang had fond memories of his childhood. The two girls were initially apprehensive, but seeing Qin Sang's unchanged demeanor, they lost all the formality they usually showed towards other guests.</p><p>They had heard Grandmaster Gu mention that Qin Sang came from the Ju Mountain Healing Platform, while they had only been to other Purification Platforms within the White Stone Healing Platform.  They were filled with yearning for the outside world, both curious and fearful of the demons of the Ghostfang Kingdom.</p><p>The two girls were quick and efficient, their tasks clearly divided. As Qin Sang sat down, fragrant tea was served.  Then, one on each side, they sat beside him, elbows on the table, chins resting on their hands, their bright eyes fixed on Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang rarely enjoyed such leisurely moments. Leaning back in his chair, holding the teacup, enveloped by the aroma of tea and orchids, he didn't find their chatter bothersome.  With a smile, he answered all their questions, occasionally even producing small gifts.</p><p>No matter how curious or unusual Feng'er and Yan'er's questions were, they always received novel answers.</p><p>Exclamations occasionally echoed from the guest hall.</p><p>Qin Sang took a sip of tea, contentedly narrowing his eyes.  He glanced towards the door and nodded with a smile.</p><p>Grandmaster Gu entered from outside. The two girls, completely oblivious, were engrossed in a story Qin Sang had just fabricated about battling a Demon King – a tale both frightening and thrilling. Their faces flushed, they eagerly inquired about various details.</p><p>'Clap!'</p><p>Grandmaster Gu deliberately made a noise.</p><p>The two girls turned and saw their master, their expressions changing instantly.  They hurriedly stood up, softly addressing her as "Master" before lowering their heads, not daring to speak.</p><p>"Go on," Grandmaster Gu said softly.</p><p>The two girls breathed a sigh of relief, scurrying out, forgetting even to pour tea for their master.</p><p>Grandmaster Gu sat opposite Qin Sang, scrutinizing him for a moment. She said softly, "Fellow Daoist, haven't you been too tense lately?"</p><p>Qin Sang paused, realizing it was true.</p><p>Since arriving in this realm, he had first been preoccupied with restoring his cultivation, then obtaining the *Poison God Classic* and the Flower Field cave.</p><p>Cultivation, body refinement, tool refining, sword practice…</p><p>The Land of Calamity, the Demon Kingdom, the Star Island Immortal Lake, the White Stone Healing Platform…</p><p>He was either cultivating or traveling, never having a moment of leisure.</p><p>During his time in the Storm Realm, although he also cultivated diligently, he had friends, family, and travels, providing more variety than now.</p><p>However, there was no denying that his progress in this realm was unmatched, something he wouldn't have dared to imagine before.</p><p>Qin Sang took a large gulp of tea, savoring the bitterness. He said, "My heart's desire."</p><p>Grandmaster Gu nodded, not pursuing the topic.  Changing the subject, she said apologetically, "Did Fellow Daoist receive that letter?  The situation has changed.  I was unable to contact you for a time and took the liberty of acting on my own. I hope Fellow Daoist won't mind."</p><p>Qin Sang set down his teacup, his expression turning serious. "Has a Grand True Cultivator already seen the war drum?"</p><p>Grandmaster Gu shook her head. "With the impending war, True Cultivator Xun of the Northern Pole Exorcism Academy summoned us for a report. I briefly mentioned it. However, without Fellow Daoist's permission, I wouldn't dare to present the war drum."</p><p>In the letter, Grandmaster Gu had asked Qin Sang if he was willing to present the war drum to the Dao Court.</p><p>If the Dao Court could replicate it, even if they could only create a few spirit treasure-grade war drums, it would be a powerful asset on the battlefield.</p><p>The moment she repaired the war drum, Grandmaster Gu had recognized its value.</p><p>Grandmaster Gu continued, "True Cultivator Xun doesn't know the full details yet, but he has promised substantial rewards, ensuring that Fellow Daoist won't be treated unfairly."</p><p>Qin Sang remained silent, pondering. After a long while, he said, "Grandmaster Gu should know that I wish to comprehend the Dao of Tool Refining by restoring this drum."</p><p>A  posterior heaven-bestowed spirit treasure was a rare opportunity, one he couldn't easily abandon.</p><p>A year ago, Qin Sang might have considered it.</p><p>Back then, there was no Illusionary Storm, and finding the path to ascension might not have required relying on the Taiyi Star Carriage.</p><p>Times had changed. Qin Sang had to seize every opportunity to improve himself, striving to restore this treasure.</p><p>As if anticipating this, Grandmaster Gu said, "After Fellow Daoist restores the war drum, then present it to the Dao Court.  As long as you also offer your insights on restoring it, I believe the Dao Court won't mind. On the contrary, they will fully support Fellow Daoist in quickly grasping the restoration method…"</p><p>There was a hint of something in Grandmaster Gu's tone.</p><p>Qin Sang picked up on it, his heart stirring.  "Grandmaster's meaning is…"</p><p>Grandmaster Gu nodded. "Aren't you lacking true teachings, Fellow Daoist?  The Dao Court's collection of ancient texts is vast, including countless tool refining manuals and inheritances from lost sects. You might even have the opportunity to receive personal guidance from the Dao Court's tool refining Grandmasters.  Why not seize this chance?"</p><p>She pointed towards the refining chamber. "As for the spirit materials needed to restore the war drum, the Dao Court is immensely wealthy.  Fellow Daoist needn't worry about that."</p><p>Qin Sang knew that Grandmaster Gu's words were not empty promises. They must have been sanctioned by the Dao Court.</p><p>With the secret of the war drum revealed, Qin Sang didn't believe he could forcibly keep it. His only concern was what he could exchange it for.</p><p>These conditions were too good, even better than he had anticipated, all tailored to his needs!</p><p>Tool refining inheritances, Grandmaster guidance, precious spirit materials…</p><p>Each one precisely targeted Qin Sang's weaknesses, likely thanks to Grandmaster Gu's mediation.</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't worried about the Dao Court breaking its promise. In this regard, the Dao Court had always had an impeccable reputation.</p><p>"In that case, I'll trouble Grandmaster Gu to contact True Cultivator Xun.  I agree!"</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't find a reason to refuse, making his decision decisively.</p><p>Grandmaster Gu was overjoyed.  She immediately began discussing the details with Qin Sang in the guest hall, taking out a blank talisman paper and listing the spirit materials needed to restore the war drum.</p><p>At the end of the list, using true essence as ink, Qin Sang added a few more items.</p><p>These materials, Qin Sang intended to use to reforge the Bright Mountain Armor.</p><p>"You, you…"</p><p>Grandmaster Gu pointed at Qin Sang, chuckling in amusement.</p><p>"Grandmaster Gu, if you have anything you urgently need, just add it to the list," Qin Sang said with a smile.</p><p>Grandmaster Gu shook her head with a smile, putting away the talisman paper without further comment.  To the Dao Court, these spirit materials were a mere trifle.</p><p>"True Cultivator Xun is busy with the war, elusive and rarely seen. When he returns, I will seek an audience with him. During this time, Fellow Daoist should carefully organize your understanding of the Dao of Tool Refining.  A Grandmaster's guidance is worth a thousand gold pieces. Don't waste the opportunity by asking insignificant questions!"</p><p>Grandmaster Gu's expression turned serious as she earnestly reminded him.</p><p>Qin Sang solemnly agreed, deciding to directly consult Grandmaster Gu. She didn't decline, helping him with his initial organization.</p><p>Six months later.</p><p>Qin Sang left the White Stone Healing Platform, his escape light heading north.</p><p>He hadn't seen True Cultivator Xun during these six months, but Qin Sang had gained a deeper understanding of the Dao of Tool Refining.  Under Grandmaster Gu's guidance, he also had a general direction for which classics and inheritances to choose later.</p><p>Since True Cultivator Xun hadn't appeared, Qin Sang decided to repair the Flower Field's grand formation first.</p><p>Nearly two years had passed, and the area outside the Healing Platform had regained its former bustle.  The battlefield was covered in lush green grass, the traces of war gradually fading with time.</p><p>Qin Sang entered the Healing Platform, smoothly reaching his cave.</p><p>He had hastily repaired the formation before, but after so long, under constant tremors, several areas were malfunctioning.</p><p>Qin Sang spread out his divine sense, sweeping across the entire flower field.</p><p>As expected, in this environment, the flower spirits' recovery was also slow.</p><p>Most of the flower spirits were listless.  In two years, not a single drop of flower dew had been produced.</p><p>'Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!'</p><p>Streams of light flew out of the Thousand Jun Ring, shooting towards various parts of the grand formation.</p><p>With Qin Sang's actions, the barrier outside the flower field became increasingly solid and robust, until finally, the qi flow became harmonious, restored to its original state!</p><p>The space within the spirit formation immediately stabilized considerably.</p><p>Unless the Healing Platform experienced further upheaval, this formation could last for a hundred years without issue.</p><p>Qin Sang paused briefly before leaving the flower field space, continuing deeper into the Healing Platform.</p><p>Compared to two years ago, the Illusionary Storm had barely changed. At this rate, it would likely take at least several hundred years to subside.</p><p>Qin Sang sighed inwardly, withdrawing from the Healing Platform. This time, he didn't head west but east, briefly meeting the Snake Demon before returning directly to Sword Heart Island.</p><p>If there was news of True Cultivator Xun, Grandmaster Gu would send a message.</p><p>Qin Sang now also needed to begin his preparations, first comprehending the insights Grandmaster Gu had recorded over the years. He also carried the war drum with him, waiting to receive the Dao Court's tool refining true teachings so he could restore the war drum as soon as possible.</p><p>Of course, his cultivation couldn't be neglected.</p><p>Qin Sang asked the Sword Slave to keep an eye out for letters from the White Stone Healing Platform, then sealed his cave and entered secluded cultivation.</p><p>Unexpectedly, five years passed in a flash.</p><p>One day, Qin Sang was silently circulating his profound arts when his expression shifted slightly, sensing his cave's restriction being activated.</p><p>He continued circulating his true essence for a full cycle, putting away the jade bottle containing poisonous fruit pulp beside him.  He rose to open the door and saw True Cultivator Zhi Jian, already out of seclusion, standing outside.</p><p>…</p><p>Old friends reunited, raising their cups in celebration.</p><p>Sipping the immortal brew, Qin Sang, without reservation, voiced the questions in his mind.</p><p>True Cultivator Zhi Jian held his wine cup, lost in thought. "You speak of Zuo Fengdao, Zuo Zhenren? We do have some history, but it's all in the past.  However, he is a virtuous and highly respected True Cultivator, esteemed for his moral character. Since you have a connection, if you encounter any difficulties in the future, you can ask him to preside over the matter."</p><p>(End of Chapter)</p>
