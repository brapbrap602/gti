<h1>Chapter 1391: The Mysterious Ice Box</h1><p>Chapter 1391: The Mysterious Ice Box</p><p>Island Master Shen and the others also suspected the demons were behind it, feigning a desperate struggle for the treasures of the White-robed Cultivator while secretly sending the Rainbow Rat to steal them.  They only blamed themselves for overlooking the Rainbow Rat.</p><p>Mocked by Master Feng, Bi Fang felt even more humiliated and angry, wishing he could catch the Rainbow Rat and tear it to pieces. But reason told him it was too late.</p><p>The island was so close to the storm zone; once the Rainbow Rat escaped into it, no one could trace it.</p><p>Bi Fang glared fiercely at the Eagle and Serpent demons. They had some connection with the Rainbow Rat.</p><p>The Eagle demon gave a wry smile, a mixture of admiration and anger, “I never imagined it would have the guts to swallow the treasure in that state…”</p><p>The Xuan Tian Palace treasures were coveted by everyone. The Rainbow Rat's audacity was astounding.</p><p>Of course, some demon kings suspected the Rainbow Rat's sudden disappearance might be related to the White-robed Cultivator, who ultimately triumphed, but it no longer mattered.</p><p>Master Feng and the others didn't believe their lies, dismissing it as mere posturing.  They were acting like they got the better end of the deal.</p><p>"Kill!"</p><p>Master Feng roared. Since they couldn't find the Rainbow Rat, they would vent their anger on the demon kings before them.</p><p>Qin Sang heard Master Feng's transmitted message, inviting him to join forces to hunt down Bi Fang.</p><p>Although they hadn't obtained the Xuan Tian Palace treasures, the ice boxes used as bait contained valuable items.  The White-robed Cultivator, worthy of his Xuan Tian Palace origins, was very wealthy. Island Master Shen and the others grabbed several, and later divided them, with Qin Sang receiving a share.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression shifted slightly. After a moment's thought, he agreed to Master Feng's proposal.</p><p>The chaotic battle erupted. Qin Sang and Master Feng attacked Bi Fang without a word, their killing intent palpable.</p><p>Bi Fang was startled, not daring to hesitate. He flapped his wings rapidly, the blood flame feathers on his body jingling like a drawn bowstring, and fled towards the outside of the island.</p><p>Island Master Shen and the other three attacked, engaging the Frog, Fish, and other four demon kings, but being one person short, they were soon exploited.</p><p>The chase between the two factions’ masters once again unfolded over the sea.</p><p>A crimson light split the night sky.  Two more streams of light followed closely.</p><p>Like three meteors, they streaked across the sea. The three lights were incredibly fast, but there was still a gap between them.</p><p>Bi Fang's blood flame transformation technique was not yet complete. His speed was like lightning, and he eventually dashed into the storm zone.</p><p>Qin Sang could still keep up, but Master Feng gradually fell behind. His escape technique was agile and capable of transforming into wind and smoke, penetrating anything, but he lacked in pure speed.</p><p>Qin Sang was rather surprised at the speed Bi Fang displayed. After observing for a while, he finally discovered the clue.</p><p>Bi Fang had transformed into a mass of blood flame, with blood flames continuously erupting from his body, burning his own essence, likely using a technique that overdrew his potential.</p><p>“This is already the third transformation of the Blood Flame Transformation, Bi Fang's technique is indeed extraordinary…”</p><p>Qin Sang thought to himself. No wonder Bi Fang had been wreaking havoc between the Xianyue Realm and the Xing Sha Islands for so long without being eliminated.</p><p>"I'll see how long your essence blood can burn!"</p><p>Qin Sang sneered inwardly.</p><p>Unexpectedly, after chasing for a while, seeing that he couldn't shake off Qin Sang, Bi Fang flew out of the storm zone.</p><p>Soon, Qin Sang discovered a surge of demonic energy to the north. A massive number of demon troops appeared on the sea.  The demon army had finally arrived.</p><p>The demon army was well-trained, maintaining its formation while advancing.</p><p>Qin Sang frowned, stopped, and watched helplessly as Bi Fang escaped into the Myriad Demon Formation.</p><p>The demon army had formed an array, and it was uncertain if there were other demon kings present.  Without his Nascent Soul puppet, he didn't want to risk breaking through.</p><p>Though reluctant, he had to give up.</p><p>Instead of returning to join Master Feng, he flew near the storm zone, flew back a short distance, and a dark shadow appeared on the surface of the sea.</p><p>His Nascent Soul puppet had returned.</p><p>The Sky-Eyed Butterfly, still excited, flew to Qin Sang, rubbing against him before returning to his qi sea.</p><p>He received the ice box from his Nascent Soul puppet.</p><p>Qin Sang examined it, discovering that the seal on the ice box was quite complex and required careful study.</p><p>“Spiritual body…”</p><p>Holding the ice box, Qin Sang reflected on the battle, thoughtful.</p><p>On both battlefields, the White-robed Cultivator's Nascent Soul was nowhere to be seen. But the aura he exuded clearly indicated a Nascent Soul cultivator.</p><p>In the storm zone battle, the White-robed Cultivator couldn't have manipulated anything further; he must have perished. However, his spiritual body seemed different from the typical cultivator's primordial spirit.</p><p>His incorporeal form was surprisingly solid, not at all ethereal, like a ghost cultivator with a physical body… Could he be solely cultivating his spirit?</p><p>Qin Sang's mind stirred.</p><p>In the current cultivation world, such cultivators were rarer than physical body cultivators.</p><p>At least, in the Northern Star Region, there were no known cultivators who solely cultivated their spirit or physical body and reached the Yuan Ying stage.</p><p>Could it be that spirit or body-cultivators don't need to form a Nascent Soul?</p><p>Qin Sang recalled the ancient texts he had read.  Relevant records were extremely scarce, virtually nonexistent.</p><p>As far as Qin Sang knew, most cultivation paths could be categorized into three: refining essence, cultivating Qi, and cultivating spirit.  In ancient times, all three could lead to the Dao.  The path of spell cultivation was just one of them.</p><p>In this era, the immortal path was arduous.</p><p>For humans, only spell cultivation was the only true path.  Other paths, even if cultivation was possible, the chance of reaching the Golden Core stage was slim, thus they gradually declined and were abandoned.</p><p>Spell cultivators refine true essence and form a Nascent Soul.  The other two paths might not achieve this!</p><p>"The 'Fire Seed Golden Lotus' is merely a technique for subduing spirit flames.  Sadly, 'Heavenly Demon Body Refinement' originates from the demon race, and I cannot fully cultivate it. Otherwise, I should have gained some insights."</p><p>Qin Sang's thoughts raced, sighing inwardly, "The Xuan Tian Palace, the greatest power in the North Sea, truly lives up to its reputation! They possess this rare technique, and it's actually possible to reach the Yuan Ying stage with it. I wonder if I'll ever have the chance to study it."</p><p>It was a pity that he didn't obtain any cultivation techniques from the white-robed person's belongings.</p><p>Qin Sang tried a few more times, but couldn't open the ice box for the moment, so he stored it in his storage ring. After a long detour, he rejoined Master Feng and the others.</p><p>Learning that Qin Sang had lost track of Bi Fang, Master Feng was quite regretful, but also understood that it wasn't Qin Sang's fault.</p><p>"Bi Fang burned its essence blood to escape this time.  It won't be stirring up trouble for a hundred years, at least.  The frog fish and other demons are also injured. This is a perfect chance to drive them all back to the Demon Realm!"</p><p>Master Feng wanted to vent his anger on the nearby demons, but remembering the treasure, he was still very upset. "It's infuriating that that treasure fell into their hands!"</p><p>Qin Sang remained calm, echoing Master Feng's sentiments, and together they cursed the Rainbow Rat.</p><p>They rejoined the human army, made arrangements, and returned to the nameless island.</p><p>Entering the main hall, everyone was silent, the atmosphere heavy.</p><p>Island Master Shen dispelled the gloom on his face, smiling faintly, "At least we got a few ice boxes. The treasures on that person should be good, so we didn't return empty-handed. Let's see what we have…"</p>
