<h1>Chapter 963: Setting Up the Formation</h1><p>Caiyi Xianzi was very familiar with the area, guiding them swiftly through the poisonous algae. Qin Sang, seeing no opportunity to act, patiently followed along.</p><p>Fortunately, these transformed demonic beasts hadn't yet suspected him.</p><p>The lakebed was devoid of soil, covered instead with withered poisonous swamp plants and thick seed pods.</p><p>Soon, they reached the lake's depths.</p><p>Due to the intense poison, few cultivators dared to venture into the Flower Fairy Lake in search of treasure.  Their journey was remarkably smooth, encountering no one along the way.</p><p>Deeper in, the demons grew more cautious.</p><p>They soon arrived at a raised, circular hill.</p><p>Caiyi Xianzi suddenly signaled for Qin Sang and the others to stop, then darted towards the hill alone.  Her figure flashed and disappeared into the poisonous algae. After a while, she returned, smiling.  "The barrier is unchanged since last time, untouched. This was once an ancient cultivator's cave dwelling.  The treasures inside have been looted, leaving only an empty cave. The barrier remains intact, able to block energy fluctuations. We can use it to set up a spirit formation; there's no need to look elsewhere."</p><p>Hearing this, the demons rejoiced.</p><p>"Caiyi Xianzi, please lead the way."</p><p>Caiyi Xianzi nodded, leading the demons towards the hill.  They quickly reached the center of the hilltop.</p><p>"The entrance is here."</p><p>To the demons' surprise, Caiyi Xianzi pointed to the ground beneath their feet.  With a wave of her jade hand, a sharp gust of wind, like steel blades, sliced through the thick layer of decaying poisonous algae, revealing the hill's true nature.</p><p>Black rock, remarkably smooth and clearly artificial, was exposed beneath the algae.</p><p>The decaying algae emitted wisps of dark green smoke, instantly filling the opening.</p><p>Looking at the smoke, Caiyi Xianzi's tone grew serious. "The poison in this smoke is far more potent than what's in the air. Even with the Thousand-Year Viper pills, don't be careless.  This is the entrance to the cave. The ancient restriction has already been broken by cultivators; getting inside won't be difficult."</p><p>Then, Caiyi Xianzi took out some items and arranged them at the entrance. After making preparations, the demons formed a circle and slowly descended into the opening.</p><p>The poisonous smoke from the decaying algae was as potent as the poisonous mist in the Purple Mist Valley.</p><p>Qin Sang felt a sudden weight on his feet as he stepped onto the black rock, surrounded by the extremely cold, poisonous smoke.</p><p>"Attack!"</p><p>Caiyi Xianzi shouted, flicking her sleeve.  A bright light suddenly flashed in the poisonous smoke.  A clear phoenix cry rang out as a fist-sized phoenix flew from her sleeve.</p><p>The phoenix spread its wings, lifelike, and struck the rock in the center.</p><p>Yuan Zhu and the other demons were not to be outdone, each using their own methods, some employing magical treasures.</p><p>Qin Sang, maintaining his Sky Demon transformation, flapped his wings forcefully and punched downwards, sending a green fist shadow hurtling towards the rock.</p><p>The demons' attacks came almost simultaneously.</p><p>The ancient restriction, feeling the impact, finally manifested itself.  Countless runes appeared on the rock's surface, and the poisonous smoke, capable of corroding even true energy, was instantly dispelled by an unknown force.</p><p>Immediately afterward, Qin Sang and the others felt a tightening sensation, as if trapped in a vast sea of mist.</p><p>The mist only lasted a short time, then their attack landed.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The hill trembled slightly, the swamp shook, and countless nearly ripe seeds were flung into the air, creating a shower of flowers.</p><p>A 'creak, creak' sound echoed as the black rock split in the middle and flipped inward, revealing a passage leading inside.</p><p>Qin Sang and the others had already broken free from the mist's confinement when the restriction was broken.</p><p>"Let's go. There's no danger inside."</p><p>Caiyi Xianzi entered the passage first, followed by the demons.</p><p>The passage was straight, leading to a heavy iron door.  After the demons opened the door, they saw a remarkably grand stone hall.</p><p>Several side chambers connected to the hall.</p><p>It was clear that the hall's furnishings had once been exquisite, but now nothing remained.  The place was dilapidated; even if any treasures had survived, they would have long been looted.</p><p>"Caiyi Xianzi was right. This is indeed the perfect place," Gu Heng said with satisfaction, surveying the hall before walking to a high platform. "No time to waste. Let's begin setting up the formation."</p><p>Having said that, Gu Heng patted his pouch, and hundreds of streams of light flew out, encompassing various treasures and floating in the air, almost filling the platform.</p><p>The others quickly rushed to the platform, working together to set up the formation under Gu Heng and Caiyi Xianzi's instructions.</p><p>This spirit array was incredibly complex. Qin Sang silently assisted in its construction, simultaneously attempting to analyze it.  He had some experience with array restrictions, yet this array left him completely baffled; it was unlike anything he'd encountered before.  It seemed that the human and demon races differed not only in their cultivation methods but also in other aspects.</p><p>The demons were in excellent spirits, their task proceeding smoothly, and they chatted and laughed while setting up the array.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at the demons, then looked at Yuan Zhu beside him, asking, "Yuan Daoist, what are your plans after completing the Great King's task?"</p><p>"I intend to leave the Seven Killing Hall..." Yuan Zhu replied.</p><p>At this moment, a descendant of the Ghost Car (Gui Che) beside them interjected, "I actually discovered a hidden realm within the Seven Killing Hall. It's quite interesting, possibly related to our demon ancestors. If you have nothing pressing, perhaps you'd join me in exploring it. We've gone to great lengths to reach this human sacred site; we can't leave empty-handed.  I'll take first pick of any treasures we find, and the rest will be divided equally. Taking human treasures is also a contribution to our demon race."</p><p>Yuan Zhu chuckled, "It seems, Daoist Che, you didn't try your best last time, only thinking about finding treasures, eh?"</p><p>The Ghost Car descendant smiled without replying.</p><p>Yuan Zhu pondered for a moment, then said, "If it truly is a legacy of our demon ancestors, a visit wouldn't hurt.  I also have something I need to do; let me consider it further..."</p><p>Qin Sang offered a noncommittal agreement.</p><p>He inwardly felt relieved.  Once the array was complete, these transformed demon beasts would likely disperse, giving him a chance to escape easily and eliminate them one by one.  He could capture a few and question them about their method of early transformation.</p><p>With this in mind, Qin Sang felt less urgency.</p><p>Working together, the demons quickly formed the array's basic structure.  A large array appeared on the high platform, with a square altar at its center.</p><p>The altar's base was made of jade, intricately carved with countless famous immortal beasts and auspicious creatures—dragons, phoenixes, qilin, kunpeng—each vividly depicted, as if about to spring from the jade into the real world.  </p><p>The moment the array was complete, a grey mist suddenly erupted from the top of the altar, containing subtle fluctuations that were hard to comprehend.</p><p>Finally, the spirit array was finished.  Gu Heng and the Caiyi Fairy stood on either side of the altar, while the demons lined up around them, encircling the altar.</p>
