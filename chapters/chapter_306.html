<h1>Chapter 299: The Fool (Part Two)</h1><p>Ge Yuan, as if afraid Qin Sang would snatch it from him, moved with incredible speed.</p><p>By the time Qin Sang arrived, Ge Yuan was standing at the edge of a pool.</p><p>A wondrous flower bloomed in the depths of the pool.</p><p>This spiritual flower grew at the pool's edge, surrounded by swirling mist. Its stem was straight, and its blossom was enormous, larger than an adult's hand, and a brilliant blue.</p><p>Sky-blue petals overlapped, their color rich and pure. The flower's pistil emitted a sparkling, dust-like brilliance, converging into a beam of blue light that pierced the dense fog.</p><p>A refreshing fragrance filled the air, invigorating the mind.</p><p>"Blue Dew昙!"</p><p>This Blue Dew昙 seemed to be precisely what Ge Yuan sought. His eyes were glazed over, his face filled with ecstasy.</p><p>Seeing Ge Yuan's state, Qin Sang stopped at the periphery to avoid any misunderstanding.</p><p>He had followed, not to compete for the spiritual herb, but to observe the environment where such herbs grew, to assess any potential dangers.</p><p>Now, it seemed, there were no protective measures at all.</p><p>The Blue Dew昙 grew alone in the depths of the pool, with no guardian spirit beasts or restrictive formations.</p><p>The pool water was pure and crystal clear.</p><p>The herb was within easy reach.</p><p>Upon seeing the flower, Qin Sang immediately recognized it as a mature, thousand-year-old spiritual herb.</p><p>Qin Sang remembered the blue light. Ge Yuan was right; it ranked high among the twenty-one spiritual herbs, but several others were even more potent!</p><p>This mountain was undoubtedly a treasure trove!</p><p>Excitement surged within Qin Sang, and he was about to set off towards the Primal Yellow Qi when he paused, his gaze lingering on the Blue Dew昙.</p><p>He felt a strange, inexplicable sensation emanating from the flower.</p><p>Intrigued, Qin Sang stopped, his eyes scanning the area, finally settling on the spiritual aura radiating from the Blue Dew昙.</p><p>The blue beam of light reached towards the sky.</p><p>Within the beam, the herb's aura mingled with the fog, like countless blue mayflies dancing within, creating a breathtaking scene.</p><p>As Qin Sang's gaze followed the light into the depths of the fog, the strange feeling persisted, though he couldn't discern its cause.</p><p>Meanwhile, Ge Yuan, having confirmed the absence of danger around the Blue Dew昙, could no longer contain himself.  He darted across the pool's surface, reaching for the flower's stem.</p><p>"Wait!"</p><p>The instant Ge Yuan neared the Blue Dew昙, the strange feeling intensified. Though unsure of the reason, Qin Sang didn't hesitate, urgently calling out to Ge Yuan.</p><p>However, Ge Yuan turned, casting a hostile glance at Qin Sang. Instead of stopping, he accelerated, his hand reaching for the Blue Dew昙.</p><p>Simultaneously, a light flashed behind him, and a short sword appeared, pointed at Qin Sang.</p><p>In Ge Yuan's eyes, Qin Sang saw suspicion, warning, and killing intent! He believed Qin Sang was trying to steal the Blue Dew昙.</p><p>Qin Sang cursed him inwardly as a fool. It was too late to stop him.</p><p>Suddenly, a sense of foreboding washed over Qin Sang. He looked up, his face paling.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>Just as Ge Yuan's hand was about to touch the Blue Dew昙, several bolts of lightning appeared out of nowhere, descending from the sky.</p><p>The beam of light vibrated violently, and a shimmering electrical net unfurled, snapping towards Ge Yuan.</p><p>All the lightning bolts converged on a single target: Ge Yuan!</p><p>Amidst the deafening thunder, a terrifying aura of destruction enveloped him.</p><p>Qin Sang, being further away, felt less of the impact, but Ge Yuan, the lightning's sole target, was seized by a fear of death.</p><p>Ge Yuan finally understood. Qin Sang hadn't tried to stop him out of greed but because he had sensed danger.</p><p>The protective formation around the herb was too well-hidden. They had checked carefully but failed to detect it.  Blinded by the sight of the long-sought herb, Ge Yuan had made a grave error.</p><p>Regret was too late. The lightning was too powerful.  He urged his short sword forward in an attempt to defend himself, but the high-grade magical artifact shattered instantly, turning to dust, leaving him aghast.</p><p>Being struck by the lightning meant only one thing: death!</p><p>His hand was inches from the herb, but he couldn't reach it.</p><p>Intense frustration flashed across Ge Yuan's face. In the end, he dared not extend his hand.  No matter how precious the herb, it was worthless without life to enjoy it.</p><p>‘Bang!’</p><p>Ge Yuan stomped on the water's surface, his body retreating rapidly.</p><p>At the same time, Qin Sang, disregarding Ge Yuan's fate, turned and fled down the mountain.</p><p>The commotion from the triggered formation couldn't be hidden from Luo Xingnan and the others. Ge Yuan was exposed, but Qin Sang might still have a chance.</p><p>As expected, the moment the formation was triggered, the battle at the summit paused. Then, the roars of the beasts intensified drastically.</p><p>‘Whoosh… ’</p><p>A hurricane erupted, the fog swirling. Several enormous figures emerged, diving towards the pool.</p><p>Luo Xingnan's furious roar echoed: "Who are these thieves!"</p><p>Before his voice faded, a piercing shriek tore through the fog. A jade, fork-like artifact, faster than the beasts, arrived in an instant.</p><p>Ge Yuan, pursued by lightning, was already struggling.  The sight of the approaching jade fork filled him with terror. He narrowly avoided being impaled, but the spiritual energy radiating from the fork struck him, sending him tumbling.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The jade fork plunged into the pool.</p><p>Water splashed, and waves of spiritual energy rippled outwards.</p><p>The beasts arrived close behind the fork. They were a flock of massive birds, their black wings concealing bodies several meters long.</p><p>Their heads were not bird-like but resembled human heads, complete with facial features, though their mouths were still beaks, opening and closing with bird-like screeches, creating a grotesque appearance.</p><p>Human-headed birds!</p><p>[Reader Benefits] Read and get cash or points, and a chance to win an iPhone12 or Switch!

He abandoned any hope of hiding.</p><p>There were no obstacles on the mountain. From the moment the formation was triggered, only a blink of an eye had passed before Luo Xingnan and the others arrived. There was no chance to escape.</p><p>The Blue Dew昙's protective formation, seemingly designed only to guard the herb, dissipated after repelling Ge Yuan.</p><p>Luo Xingnan's cold gaze swept over the two men. He sneered, "So it's you two thieves working together. You stumbled into this place by sheer luck!  How dare you try to steal herbs right under my nose!"</p><p>Ge Yuan served under Sheng Yuanzi, and Qin Sang followed Yu Kong.  Luo Xingnan remembered them.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at the disheveled Ge Yuan and exchanged a look with Yun Youzi.  Both felt a sense of helplessness.</p>
