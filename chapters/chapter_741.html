<h1>Chapter 733: Mid-Stage Golden Core</h1><p>Good news: the fat silkworm's absorption of the poisonous beast's core went smoothly, and there are signs of a breakthrough.</p><p>After checking on the two spirit insects, Qin Sang entered a meditative state, and the cave fell silent.</p><p>…</p><p>A nameless deserted island.</p><p>The island is unusually large, with large groups of demonic beasts roaming it.</p><p>Deep within the island's earth lies a huge cavern, its strange crystals shimmering with a dreamlike light.</p><p>In the depths of the cavern, a stalactite pillar has been cut in half by a sharp weapon.  A figure sits cross-legged on the remaining portion, meditating.</p><p>This person is Qin Sang.</p><p>The stalactite pillar is massive; Qin Sang sits in its center, surrounded by a temporary spirit gathering array.</p><p>Strangely, the cavern's spiritual energy is incredibly abundant, more than enough for his cultivation.</p><p>His complexion is rosy, his body motionless, yet his breath rises and falls unevenly.  Any other cultivator witnessing this would be filled with envy, for this is a sign of an imminent breakthrough!</p><p>Feitian Yecha and the two-headed… [creature's name] wait anxiously.</p><p>The two-headed… [creature's name] occasionally glances at Qin Sang, its eyes flickering, seemingly more expectant than Qin Sang himself.</p><p>It clearly remembers Qin Sang's oath: to set it free upon reaching the late-stage Golden Core.</p><p>The day of freedom draws ever closer!</p><p>The two-headed…[creature's name] is capable of discerning advantage and disadvantage.</p><p>Over the years of following Qin Sang, while used in combat, Qin Sang never abandoned it in danger, showing a degree of loyalty.</p><p>It's not uncommon for spirit beasts to prosper along with their masters.</p><p>Qin Sang appears to have considerable talent.</p><p>But this doesn't fully satisfy the two-headed…[creature's name]; it has never forgotten the joy of freedom.</p><p>Qin Sang, undisturbed, feels the surging true energy in his dantian, his five-colored golden core spinning at an astonishing speed.</p><p>Day and night blur in the cavern.</p><p>This state has continued for an unknown length of time.</p><p>After some time, Qin Sang suddenly groans, his expression contorting.  His golden core emits a brilliant light, and the surrounding spiritual energy surges, then frantically rushes towards his dantian.</p><p>In an instant, the surrounding spiritual energy is completely drained.</p><p>Qin Sang lets out a long roar.  With a resounding “boom,” his aura suddenly explodes, an invisible wave sweeping outward, instantly destroying the spirit gathering array.</p><p>The spirit stones, already depleted, are pale and crumble easily.</p><p>The stalactite beneath him trembles, emitting a "crack" before collapsing.</p><p>Dust billows.</p><p>The next moment, a figure shoots into the air, followed by a burst of unrestrained laughter echoing through the cavern.</p><p>The laughter ceases.</p><p>Qin Sang lands lightly on the ground.</p><p>By now, twenty-two years have passed since he arrived on Wuyuan Island, and nearly fifty since his arrival in the Canglang Sea.</p><p>Learning of the Qisha Temple's early opening, Qin Sang dared not be slack.  He spent nearly twenty-two years in the depths of the demon sea.</p><p>He journeyed alone, living among demonic beasts.</p><p>Decades of arduous cultivation have finally borne fruit!</p><p>“Twenty-two years… I remember Elder Zou saying the Qisha Temple would open in over twenty years, but the exact time was never specified. It should be soon though…”</p><p>Qin Sang mutters to himself, eagerly inspecting his inner state, his eyes gleaming.</p><p>Not only has his true energy grown stronger, but his spiritual sense has also improved significantly.</p><p>As expected, after breaking through to the mid-stage Golden Core, the fragments of Dongyang Bo's forbidden talismans have finally been eradicated. While the corpse pill minimized their effects, their presence was still unsettling.</p><p>However, Qin Sang frowns. That mass of grey energy remains stubbornly persistent.</p><p>He directs even stronger true energy to assault it, but the result is the same as before – it's consumed without a ripple.</p><p>Fortunately, the grey energy has remained docile since his breakthrough, so he decides to leave it be.</p><p>Qin Sang looks around, cuts down another stalactite, and leaps onto it, intending to carefully examine the changes in his body and attempt to cultivate the technique from Senior Qingzhu, comparing it to the original.</p><p>Unexpectedly, after a period of meditation, Qin Sang is startled awake.</p><p>He looks towards the cavern ceiling, listening intently.  After a moment, he gestures, summoning Feitian Yecha and the two-headed…[creature's name], and sends them towards the cavern mouth.</p><p>The cavern entrance is well-concealed, hidden in waist-high weeds and obscured by rocks.</p><p>This patch of weeds is elevated, and from the mouth of the cave, Qin Sang can vaguely see the coast.</p><p>Surprisingly, the island's demonic beasts have become agitated.  Around him, the howls of beasts and cries of birds rise and fall in a terrifying chorus.</p><p>On the western side of the desolate island, in the Demon Sea, waves crashed relentlessly despite the absence of strong winds.  Between the towering waves, shadowy figures of varying sizes swam, occasionally breaching the surface, revealing an intensely ferocious aura that was truly breathtaking.</p><p>"A beast tide?"</p><p>Qin Sang frowned.  This wasn't his first encounter with a beast tide during his years on Wu Yuan Island; he had witnessed one previously while on Jin Yuan Island.  Fortunately, Jin Yuan Island had received advance warning, allowing the cultivators to evacuate to Mu Yuan Island with minimal casualties.  That experience had instilled in him a deep understanding of the beast tide's terrifying power.  The sheer number of demonic beasts was overwhelming, making individuals feel insignificant, fueling his desire to become stronger.</p><p>Later, Qin Sang learned that the previous beast tide wasn't even the worst.</p><p>"This is deep within the Demon Sea, so far from Wu Yuan Island, and the beast tide is already starting here?  And why is it so much sooner this time? It's been less than a decade..."</p><p>Qin Sang's expression was grave; he had a premonition that this beast tide would be exceptionally dangerous.</p><p>After a moment's thought, Qin Sang left his cave dwelling and silently flew towards the eastern side of the desolate island, determined to warn others.  Over the years, the Wang sisters had flourished the trading company's business, benefiting Qin Sang greatly. Through the company, he had acquired many cultivation-enhancing pills.  He didn't want to see the company destroyed by the beast tide.</p><p>"Unfortunately, I've been too focused on solidifying my cultivation and haven't had time to practice the technique created by Elder Qingzhu. I'll have to wait until I get back. It's time I returned. I haven't heard from Elder Zou for some reason, and I don't want to miss the Seven Killing Hall."</p><p>With the beast tide nearby, Qin Sang remained cautious, avoiding detection. Reaching the eastern side of the large desolate island, seeing that the beast tide hadn't yet reached this area, he felt relieved and continued eastward. Once a safe distance from the tide, he activated the Nine Dragon Celestial Chariot Talisman.</p><p>With the Jiao spirit enveloping him, Qin Sang transformed into a red streak of light, disappearing into the horizon in a few blinks. His enhanced cultivation had noticeably increased the talisman's speed!</p><p>Along the way, he experimented with combining sword energy and thunder sound, marveling at his incredible speed. Even ordinary late-stage Golden Core cultivators would likely be left far behind!</p><p>Qin Sang was elated, alternately using the Nine Dragon Celestial Chariot Talisman and his dual-headed… [Name of weapon redacted due to character encoding issues] to sense the beast tide's movements.</p><p>"It seems they're heading towards Mu Yuan Island…"</p><p>Having confirmed the beast tide's target, Qin Sang immediately accelerated.</p>
