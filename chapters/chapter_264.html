<h1>Chapter 257: Escape</h1><p>Chapter 257: Escape</p><p>Old Man Dique had to be extra careful, using most of his power to dodge the magical talisman left by Daoist Xuanyu. But even if the Heavenly Melody Conch only used a tiny bit of its spiritual power, it could easily capture Qin Sang!</p><p>The conch was in the air, its opening facing Qin Sang. Inside, it created a whirlpool, dark and deep like an abyss, emitting immense pressure.</p><p>Qin Sang immediately felt as if he were sinking into a swamp. No matter how he tried, he couldn’t escape the immense pressure from all directions.</p><p>At this moment, a fierce zombie rushed out and flew toward the Heavenly Melody Conch. But Old Man Dique seemed to have anticipated this. As soon as the fierce zombie appeared, he gently shook the conch, sending out a sound wave that also suppressed it.</p><p>If Old Man Dique didn’t want to kill Qin Sang so quickly, he would have aimed the sound wave at him.</p><p>Qin Sang’s timing was excellent. Most of Old Man Dique’s power was tied up by the talisman, so he had to be very alert, or Daoist Xuanyu would notice if the talisman was activated.</p><p>There was no question of who was more important to him: Daoist Xuanyu or Qin Sang.</p><p>And so it was. Old Man Dique only used a small portion of the Heavenly Melody Conch’s power.</p><p>But even so, Qin Sang was still unable to fight back.</p><p>The gap was too large!</p><p>Qin Sang smiled wryly to himself. Fortunately, he had anticipated this situation. He turned his palm over, revealing a black bead that he had been hiding in his palm.</p><p>Dark Yin Thunder!</p><p>He gave up all resistance, letting himself be suppressed by the Heavenly Melody Conch as he clenched his teeth and poured all of his spiritual power from his body into his palm, then flicked his wrist.</p><p>It was right in front of Qin Sang.</p><p>The Dark Yin Thunder exploded!</p><p>The force of the destruction made Qin Sang’s scalp tingle. A scene appeared in Qin Sang’s eyes.</p><p>A black light rapidly grew and expanded in his eyes.</p><p>Like a drop of black ink spreading, it had a cold, determined beauty.</p><p>At such close range, he was doomed!</p><p>The Dark Yin Thunder had to be exploding extremely quickly, but to Qin Sang, everything seemed too slow, as if it had been a thousand or ten thousand years.</p><p>Death was staring him in the face.</p><p>But Qin Sang was very calm. He knew that Old Man Dique would never allow the Dark Yin Thunder to explode here.</p><p>The Heavenly Melody Conch had been sealed by Old Man Dique to conceal its aura and appearance. In a hurry, it would not be possible to contain the power of the Dark Yin Thunder explosion with a seal like this.</p><p>Although the range of the Dark Yin Thunder’s explosion wasn’t very large, even if a hint of it escaped, it was possible that Daoist Xuanyu would notice it, causing their mission to fail.</p><p>In front of the stone palace.</p><p>“Dark Yin Thunder!”</p><p>Old Man Dique’s face darkened as he coldly uttered three words. “Good! Good! Good!”</p><p>He had never imagined that Qin Sang would break free from his control in such a determined manner.</p><p>But what was the point?</p><p>He was still just an ant that could be crushed at any time!</p><p>“Since you’re in such a hurry to die, I shall grant you your wish!” Old Man Dique was furious.</p><p>“Seal!”</p><p>The Dark Yin Thunder exploded in an instant, so fast that Old Man Dique didn’t even have time to kill Qin Sang first.</p><p>As Old Man Dique barked, the Heavenly Melody Conch quickly released Qin Sang, and the whirlpool in the opening stopped, reversed, and then spun rapidly. The pressure immediately became a powerful suction force, enveloping the Dark Yin Thunder. Finally, before it could explode, it absorbed all of the black light that it had divided without missing a beat.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The Heavenly Melody Conch vibrated wildly and its aura became chaotic.</p><p>As expected of a magic treasure, it swallowed the Dark Yin Thunder and absorbed the full force of the explosion. From the outside, it seemed to be completely unharmed.</p><p>At the same time, the pressure on Qin Sang’s body suddenly disappeared. He had been waiting for this moment, and his figure shot out like lightning. It looked as if he was courting death as he charged into the group of Fire Birds without hesitation.</p><p>But halfway there, Qin Sang’s figure suddenly froze, like a corpse, and relied on his momentum to fly into the group of Fire Birds. His ‘corpse’ had only just appeared when it was surrounded by Fire Birds.</p><p>Old Man Dique turned to look at Ren Hong and asked coldly, “Are you certain that you can’t use spiritual power or Divine Sense in the Fire Bird group?”</p><p>Ren Hong didn’t know anything about what Qin Sang had done, or even see Qin Sang’s ‘corpse’.</p><p>He was wondering why Old Man Dique’s aura had suddenly changed when he heard his question. He was startled and noticed the lingering killing intent on Old Man Dique’s face, so he quickly replied, “Reporting to Master, those Fire Birds are extremely sensitive to changes in spiritual power and Divine Sense. Even the slightest fluctuation will cause them to notice and become extremely ferocious. Master, you must be careful…”</p><p>“The spiritual energy is so chaotic that if there’s a talisman, it will be triggered.</p><p>So, Xuan Yu the Devilish couldn't have left any other secret marks in the flock of birds...</p><p>Elder Di Que nodded in agreement and looked up, relieved. After a brief moment of chaos, the flock of firebirds returned to normal, which meant that they had finished consuming Qin Sang's 'corpse'.</p><p>Any remains would have been immediately incinerated by the endless elemental fire energy, leaving no traces behind.</p><p>Elder Di Que sensed something and found that the Celestial Sound Conch had become sluggish.</p><p>After spending all this time hunting geese, he ended up getting pecked in the eye by one.</p><p>The insignificant ant he could have crushed with ease had almost caused him great trouble.</p><p>Elder Di Que's heart was filled with hatred. He wished he could drag Qin Sang back from the underworld and tear him into pieces with his own hands.</p><p>“Let's go!”</p><p>Elder Di Que glanced at Ren Hong imperceptibly, determined to kill him as soon as he was no longer useful to avoid making the same mistake again.</p><p>Ren Hong was still in the dark.</p><p>Inside the crater.</p><p>Although he wasn't afraid of the impact of the cries, these firebirds weren't comparable to the ones in the trial space when they flapped their wings to create a hurricane of flames. Their power was not to be underestimated.</p><p>Qin Sang concealed himself within the flock of firebirds. His robes were tattered and his body was covered in dense burn marks. He was in great pain, but he was still alive and wore an unusually relaxed expression.</p><p>He had finally forced Elder Di Que to detonate the strand of Illusory Divine Sound in his spiritual energy space!</p><p>The divine sound had transformed into a blade, aimed at his spiritual energy, but it had been devoured by the Jade Buddha.</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't waited for Elder Di Que to order him to enter the flock of firebirds to probe them and then fake his death precisely because of this strand of Illusory Divine Sound.</p><p>As long as this hidden danger remained, his condition wouldn't be able to escape Elder Di Que's notice. Faking his death wouldn't work and there was even a chance that his ability to withstand the firebirds' cries would expose the Jade Buddha.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't have the ability to neutralize Elder Di Que's hidden danger, so he could only force Elder Di Que to do it himself. That was why he had taken the risky step of detonating the Xuan Yin Thunderbolt in front of him.</p><p>This was a dangerous gambit.</p><p>From the moment he saw the firebirds, Qin Sang had begun planning.</p><p>He absolutely couldn't continue to be a pioneer. He had started to struggle after breaking through the stone palace and, after reaching the ancient cultivator's cave府, the restrictions within would inevitably be even more dangerous. Even if he managed to survive by luck, Elder Di Que would most likely kill him to silence him.</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't naïve enough to believe that Elder Di Que would genuinely take him as his disciple.</p><p>Elder Di Que had plotted against Daoist Xuan Yu, who was backed by Shang Yuan Qing Jing Palace, one of the eight great immortal sects. If he didn't eliminate all witnesses, he would be digging his own grave.</p><p>Qin Sang understood this rationale.</p><p>Elder Di Que definitely understood it too.</p><p>Ren Hong understood it as well, but he was powerless to resist.</p>
