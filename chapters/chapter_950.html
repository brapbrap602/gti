<h1>Chapter 942: The Banner</h1><p>Chapter 942: The Banner</p><p>This treasure is a fragment of an ancient artifact.  Its original rank is unknown, but now it can only be used to conceal one's aura.  The young man surnamed Fang relied on the Crimson Silk to move freely within human territory.</p><p>Upon hearing Qin Sang explain the Crimson Silk’s use, Bai’s face lit up. "Excellent! With this treasure, we should succeed without fail. Friend Daoist, let's begin..."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded.</p><p>The floor of the cavern and the canyon walls were of similar material, shimmering with a metallic luster and incredibly hard.  Bai explained that this was due to the existence of the magic seal.</p><p>The magic seal permeated the entire Ghostland, completely shrouding it, sealing away the wandering spirits and eternally suppressing this place.  Because of the altar, Bai could sleep within the cavern.  Elsewhere, if he dared approach the magic seal, he would immediately suffer its backlash. Earlier, when he observed the Nascent Soul at the valley entrance, he had to remain far behind.</p><p>Bai led Qin Sang to the altar, pointed out the key points for breaking the magic seal, then sat cross-legged in the center, waiting to assist Qin Sang in retrieving the demonic fire and activating the altar.  His clenched hands and eyes betrayed his nervousness.</p><p>Qin Sang circled the altar several times, pondered for a moment, then sat cross-legged near it, taking a demonic banner from his storage ring.  He closed his eyes, recalling the alchemic methods of the Old Ancestor Kuiyin.</p><p>At this stage, it wasn't alchemy in the strict sense, but rather the retrieval of the Nine Nether Demonic Fire, sealing it with the original restrictions of the Xuan iron pillar and the power of the spirit thread.  During this process, he not only had to suppress the Nine Nether Demonic Fire's resistance, but also the magic seal's backlash.</p><p>Retrieving the demonic fire at the canyon entrance, where it revealed its true form, might have been easier. However, firstly, the Nascent Soul was observing from outside, and secondly, that method wouldn't weaken the magic seal.</p><p>Fortunately, Bai could manipulate the power of the altar to help him counter the magic seal at critical moments.</p><p>After long contemplation, Qin Sang mentally rehearsed the process several times, ensuring there were no omissions.  He opened his eyes, nodded at Bai, and said, "Let's begin!"</p><p>Bai took a deep breath, his expression serious as he surveyed the eight spirit pillars on the altar.  The pillars' material was unknown; after years of weathering, they appeared as unremarkable, greyish stone columns.</p><p>Bai's lips moved, reciting the incantations etched into his soul, unsealing the altar that had slumbered for countless years.</p><p>Qin Sang gripped the demonic banner, ready to use his secret techniques to retrieve the demonic fire, his eyes fixed on Bai's movements.  Bai's incantations grew faster, but the altar remained motionless.</p><p>Suddenly, the altar shuddered violently, causing the entire cavern to tremble.  The next moment, a 'crack-crack' sound came from one of the spirit pillars at the altar's edge.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced over.  A faint light glowed from the middle of the pillar, illuminating it from within.  The pillar's appearance drastically changed, as if shedding a layer of stone shell, its interior resembling exquisitely carved jade.</p><p>Alarmingly, under the light, countless spiderweb-like cracks spread throughout the pillar's interior.</p><p>Qin Sang's heart tightened. Seeing Bai seem to pause his incantation, he quickly asked, "Were these cracks already in the pillar?"</p><p>The magic seal's power was waning; it seemed the altar was also in poor condition.  Qin Sang worried that the pillar might shatter midway, causing their efforts to fail. If that happened, he would be trapped in the Ghostland for decades.</p><p>Bai's expression was also serious. He stared at the pillar for a long time before saying, "Friend Daoist, rest assured. The cracks are due to the altar's weakened power from the magic seal's corrosion.  However, I personally refined this object before my death; it's not as fragile as it appears.  Moreover, the magic seal's power is not what it once was; the pillar can hold until we break the magic seal and pacify the spirits."</p><p>Qin Sang relaxed. "In that case, I'm relieved. I've prepared my secret technique. Friend Daoist, directly assault the magic seal and force the demonic fire to manifest."</p><p>"Good!"</p><p>Bai nodded, pointing a finger at the pillar.  His finger moved like a spinning wheel, rapidly shooting beams of light into the pillar.  Then, amidst a heart-stopping creaking sound, the pillar suddenly erupted with a strong light, illuminating the entire chamber in detail. At the point where the pillar connected to the altar, countless incredibly complex runes appeared.</p><p>Qin Sang was enveloped in a bright light. Upon seeing the runes, a profound sense of peace washed over her, yet her mind remained clear.  This was perhaps due to the jade Buddha, or perhaps the altar's power did not affect the living.</p><p>The runes appeared, and a sudden change occurred.</p><p>The ground shimmered with strange light, and then countless black lines emerged, like a vast dark net encompassing the altar.</p><p>From these black lines, Qin Sang sensed a familiar aura—the Nine Netherworld Inferno!</p><p>The instant the black lines appeared, the light from the spiritual pillar dimmed abruptly. The runes spun and were forced back into the altar; the pillar's light grew ever fainter.</p><p>"Open!"</p><p>Bai's eyes widened, and with a sharp cry, he pressed down with one hand. The runes on the altar exploded, condensing into a ball of spiritual light that slammed into a section of the dark net before Qin Sang.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>Following the violent tremor, Qin Sang, using the celestial butterfly's power, observed the changes.</p><p>The black net, rising from the ground, revealed its true form: countless strange runes danced, enveloping and consuming the altar's spiritual light.  They seemed to sense Bai's presence and surged madly towards the altar.</p><p>Bai's expression changed, and he hastily channeled the altar's power to resist the rune's assault, his gaze fixed expectantly on Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang stared intently at the point where the black net had erupted.</p><p>The power of the demonic restriction, forced back by the altar, manifested itself.  The demonic restriction runes were borne by strands of the Nine Netherworld Inferno.  Normally, the inferno and runes were inseparable, but a flaw had created an opportunity.</p><p>Seizing the chance, Qin Sang immediately waved her demonic banner towards the area.</p><p>The banner descended slowly near the inferno.  Black light flashed, and a sudden suction force drew out a strand of the Nine Netherworld Inferno.  Qin Sang simultaneously used a secret technique to activate the artifact and seal the inferno.</p><p>An astonishing sight unfolded. The aggressive inferno, trapped within the banner's black light, struggled violently but could not break free.</p><p>Gradually, the strand of inferno calmed, vanished in a flash, and disappeared into the banner.</p><p>Simultaneously, the strange runes shattered, and the black net's intensity weakened.</p><p>Bai rejoiced, urging repeatedly, "Friend, quickly collect the inferno! Once we succeed, we immediately go to the other locations. We must destroy those key restrictions before the demonic restriction recovers!"</p><p>Qin Sang, aware of the urgency, did not hesitate, expending her spiritual energy to accelerate the process. Strand by strand, the Nine Netherworld Inferno was sealed within the banner.</p><p>Under Bai's tense gaze, a brand-new demonic banner was completely refined!</p><p>Qin Sang summoned the banner into her palm and couldn't help but smile.</p><p>The Kuiyin Ancestor would never have imagined that the Ten Directions Yama Banner, which he had painstakingly created, would reappear and shine brilliantly in her hands!</p>
