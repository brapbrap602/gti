<h1>Chapter 1028: The Scheme</h1><p>Inner Sanctum.</p><p>The Nascent Soul cultivators who entered the Inner Sanctum, except for those qualified to participate in the trial, all followed Ling Zhuzi through a large door on the left side of the Seven Kills Hall.  After traversing a long corridor, a glimmer of light appeared ahead. A stone gate, already open, stood before them.  Beyond the gate lay a high platform, swept by a howling, frigid wind.</p><p>Surprisingly, faced with this mere yin wind, these Nascent Soul cultivators all activated their True Essence or the protective auras of their Dharma robes.  It seemed the yin wind here was no ordinary breeze.</p><p>Ling Zhuzi was the first to step outside the gate, standing at the edge of the platform to gaze into the distance. The others followed in an orderly fashion.</p><p>Even here, the various factions remained clearly divided.  Cultivators of the righteous and demonic paths gathered around Ling Zhuzi and the Demon Lord, respectively. The members of the three great merchant alliances clustered together, their three leaders pointing and whispering amongst themselves, communicating through secret sound transmission.  Other factions, both large and small, kept their distance from these three, forming their own groups. They observed the movements of the righteous, demonic, and merchant groups, making no rash moves.</p><p>"A hundred years have passed, yet the Inner Sanctum remains unchanged."  Ling Zhuzi sighed, hands clasped behind his back.</p><p>The platform they stood upon was built upon a sheer cliff face.  The smooth, mirror-like cliff had only this single cave and platform as an entrance to the Inner Sanctum. Below the cliff was a bottomless abyss, pitch black, from which the chilling yin wind endlessly blew, like the wails of ghosts.</p><p>Looking out, celestial restrictions shimmered in the air.  Ahead lay a vast expanse of mountains and valleys, with strange lights flickering in some areas, hinting at ancient ruins and hidden dangers.</p><p>But there was no scenic beauty here.  The entire Inner Sanctum was shrouded in darkness, swept by the incessant yin wind and its eerie howls. A faint black mist, resembling ghostly qi, drifted everywhere.  Broken walls and ruins were commonplace, riverbeds were dry and lifeless, and some mountains had completely collapsed, their rubble filling the valleys. A scene of utter desolation.</p><p>Coupled with the omnipresent dangerous restrictions, the entire Inner Sanctum resembled a ghostly realm.  Anyone entering here would instinctively be on high alert.</p><p>"Since the Four Saints discovered the Seven Kills Hall, this place has never changed! One day, this Lord will explore all the secrets of the Seven Kills Hall and discover what happened in the ancient cultivation world that severed the path of immortality for future generations!" The Demon Lord declared, his brow raised in defiance.</p><p>His words resonated with some of the Nascent Soul cultivators present, eliciting sighs.  In this desolate era, they had emerged as Nascent Soul cultivators. In ancient times, they would have been elites among cultivators, with limitless futures.  This was especially true for the Demon Lord and Ling Zhuzi.</p><p>Now, however, born in the wrong era, they saw no hope of immortality, not even daring to dream of reaching the Deity Transformation stage. They could only linger on, threatened by the recurring heavenly tribulations.  What difference was there between them and dried bones in a tomb?</p><p>After these words, the Demon Lord drifted away, and the other Nascent Soul cultivators, snapping back to reality, began to move.</p><p>Ling Zhuzi sighed softly and turned to address the group. "Once the celestial restrictions fluctuate, it means the Inner Sanctum is about to close. Time is limited. Fellow Daoists, if you have something to do, set off quickly."</p><p>With that, Ling Zhuzi led his group away.  Immediately, streaks of light shot out from the platform, flying in different directions.  Among them, the members of the three great merchant alliances remained together.</p><p>Led by their three leaders, they did not head directly into the depths of the Inner Sanctum but flew towards the left side of the platform, soon landing on a mountain covered in dilapidated buildings.</p><p>After everyone had departed, a barely perceptible ripple appeared in the celestial restrictions at the top of the cliff. Hidden within the shimmering light, the old woman scanned the departing cultivators before examining the surrounding restrictions.</p><p>"The celestial restrictions here are normal, and the restrictions left by our ancestors haven't changed either. Why did it appear earlyâ€¦?"  The old woman muttered to herself, puzzled.  Tapping her cane, she vanished.</p><p>On the mountain, the cultivators of the three great merchant alliances landed.  Looking up, they could only see the lower half of the mountain. The summit was completely enveloped by celestial restrictions, obscuring the view.</p><p>While the others waited, the three alliance leaders quietly moved to the edge of the celestial restrictions.</p><p>The red-faced old man, the Northern Star Alliance Leader, casually set up an isolation barrier, then formed a hand seal. After a moment of silence, he said, "There's no one around."</p><p>The Eastern Horizon Alliance Leader nodded and glanced at the summit. "This is the true location of the Trial Grounds, completely hidden within the celestial restrictions. After setting up the formation, we will act separately as agreed. I will stay here and unlock the altar hidden within the Trial Grounds. The two of you should leave quickly and go to the other locations. Unlock all the altars as soon as possible and don't miss the timing. Success or failure hinges on this!"</p><p>The Northern Star Alliance Leader nodded slightly, while the Western Dusk Alliance Leader remained silent, offering no objection.</p><p>After a brief discussion, the three alliance leaders retrieved various precious treasures from their spatial pouches and collaborated to set up a peculiar grand formation.  The formation's location was extremely concealed, and it emitted no discernible fluctuations, making it difficult to discern its purpose. It unexpectedly required the combined efforts of the three alliance leaders.</p><p>"We'll leave this to you, fellow Daoist. Let's go."  The Northern Star Alliance Leader addressed the Western Dusk Alliance Leader and led his people away from the mountain.</p><p>After everyone had left, the Eastern Horizon Alliance Leader looked up at the celestial restrictions for a moment, then sat down in the center of the grand formation on the altar, closing his eyes in meditation.</p><p>An unknown amount of time passed.</p><p>The Eastern Horizon Alliance Leader suddenly opened his eyes, a glint flashing within them. He then raised his hands, his fingers moving rapidly as he formed hand seals, sending streams of them into various parts of the grand formation.</p><p>'Hum...'</p><p>The altar trembled slightly.  However, the entire grand formation remained calm, without any noticeable activity. Even if someone were nearby, they would hardly detect anything unusual.</p><p>Finally, the Eastern Horizon Alliance Leader fully activated the grand formation.  Countless shimmering, indistinct circular mirrors appeared within the formation. At the center of each mirror, a faint, ethereal, lime-green aura flickered.</p><p>The Eastern Horizon Alliance Leader continued, focusing his entire attention on casting spells.  The fluctuations of the mirrors intensified, and the auras, like trapped fish, were unable to escape the confines of the formation and began to coalesce towards the center.</p><p>As the Eastern Horizon Alliance Leader neared the end of his spellcasting, these auras transformed dramatically, resembling countless bladeless flying swords, ethereal and without substance.</p><p>The ethereal blades pointed towards the grand formation in the air, their sharp edges gleaming.</p><p>Completing this step, the Eastern Horizon Alliance Leader paused, feeling exhausted. After consuming a few spirit pills, he continued casting spells.</p><p>The blade forms changed again, their faint lime-green hue fading until they became completely transparent, invisible to the naked eye.</p><p>"Hu!"</p><p>The Eastern Horizon Alliance Leader exhaled deeply.</p><p>Opening his eyes and looking at the floating ethereal blades, a hint of joy appeared on his face. He then retrieved a token from his spatial pouch, grasped it firmly, and made no further movements.</p><p>The ethereal blades hovered motionless beneath the restrictions. The Eastern Horizon Alliance Leader seemed to be waiting for a specific moment.</p>
