<h1>Chapter 894: Trouble Brews</h1><p>Chapter 894: Trouble Brews</p><p>When the others entered the stone hall, Huashen arrived at the foot of the mountain. After waiting a while, he saw two figures flying from a distance—Fang Ting and Zhao Songqiao.</p><p>"Zhang, we apologize for keeping you waiting,"</p><p>Zhao Songqiao bowed slightly, his expression somewhat tense.</p><p>Huashen took the two of them and flew inside. Unexpectedly, halfway up the mountain, a green figure suddenly appeared before them, revealing a somewhat short and stout man.</p><p>"Ah! Greetings, Uncle-Master!"</p><p>Huashen, startled, hastily bowed.</p><p>The stout man was a cultivator from the Lan Dou Sect who had come with them; his cultivation was slightly higher than a Daoist boy. Huashen only knew he was a true disciple of the Five Elements lineage, but didn't know his name.</p><p>"Is he the disciple that Grandmaster Huayang brought in? Who are they, and why did you bring them here?" The stout man raised his chin, frowning.</p><p>This man seemed to recognize Huashen.</p><p>Fang Ting and Zhao Songqiao stood stiffly.</p><p>Huashen thought for a moment, then replied: "Uncle-Master, they are disciples of Senior Chen from Yan Miao Pavilion. This is Fang Ting, Senior Chen's direct disciple, and she's a friend of mine. She came to see me."</p><p>"Fang Ting?"</p><p>The stout cultivator seemed to remember something, looking at Fang Ting. His eyes flickered, and a playful smile suddenly appeared on his face. "I've heard that Grandmaster Huayang's unfulfilled wish might be accomplished by a Qi Condensation cultivator. Haha…"</p><p>"Good luck!"</p><p>The stout cultivator patted Zhang Yue's shoulder, a suggestive smile on his face, then vanished in a flash of light.</p><p>Huashen was startled, understanding the hidden meaning in the fat man's words. He subconsciously looked at Fang Ting, who had her head bowed low, her ears as red as rubies.</p><p>"Ahem…"</p><p>Zhao Songqiao cleared his throat, saying, "Junior Brother, Junior Sister, shouldn't we be going?"</p><p>…</p><p>Outside Dongming Island, a patch of water was shrouded in shadow.</p><p>Several figures sat cross-legged within the shadows, one of whom was the Fang-surname young man who had previously tricked Qin Sang.</p><p>"Senior Brother, it's about time. Dongming Island has appeared, weakening the protective array. It's time to move. If we wait any longer, more Nascent Soul cultivators from various sects will arrive, making things difficult."</p><p>A man in black robes opened his eyes and said in a low voice.</p><p>At this time, another middle-aged cultivator with a gloomy expression asked, "Second Senior Brother, how are the spies you planted?  If we need to use them, don't let anything go wrong."</p><p>"Rest assured! He will be prepared ahead of us."</p><p>The man in black robes said confidently.</p><p>"That's good. That thing is indeed on Dongming Island. If only I hadn't bothered with those Dou Niu Peak remnants! That damned human cultivator not only killed Fourth Senior Brother, but also spread the news all over Tianxing Island, ruining Fourth Senior Brother's plans.  The human experts we had recruited became wary, so we had to abandon the plan. If we had brought them to attack Dongming Island directly, with our strength, the chances of forcibly breaking into the island and seizing that object would have been high."</p><p>The middle-aged cultivator said resentfully.</p><p>"Are you saying I made a mistake?"</p><p>The Fang-surname young man suddenly opened his eyes, revealing a murderous look, and stared coldly at the middle-aged cultivator.</p><p>"Junior Brother dares not. I am merely filled with hatred for the murderer of Fourth Senior Brother and Little Junior Brother, leading to my unintentional words…"</p><p>The middle-aged cultivator trembled, and in terror quickly knelt down, explaining repeatedly.</p><p>"Ninth Junior Brother meant no harm. He's always been carefree. Senior Brother, don't mind him. That human cultivator, merely a small mid-Nascent Soul cultivator, has repeatedly offended our Black Serpent Mountain. Sooner or later, we will extract his soul, burn him day and night with hellfire, and settle every single score!"</p><p>The man in black robes quickly smoothed things over, then reprimanded the middle-aged cultivator, "What do you know? Without capturing the Dou Niu Peak remnants, how can we be certain that the object is on Dongming Island?  Moreover, Senior Brother has always been wary of another Yuan Ying ancestor from the Lan Dou Sect, which is why he hasn't dared to act rashly.  It was only from the mouths of the Dou Niu Peak remnants that we learned that the human cultivator was actually the ancestor of the Dou Niu Peak lineage, and that the turmoil of those years was caused by him.  This resulted in internal strife in the Lan Dou Sect, severely damaging its vitality.  Not only was the Dou Niu Peak lineage expelled, but that Yuan Ying ancestor was also fatally wounded and perished.  It is deplorable that the Lan Dou Sect has been concealing this matter, claiming he was merely in seclusion."</p><p>A dwarf, only half the height of an adult, suddenly let out a strange laugh, "It's no wonder the Lan Dou Sect has kept this matter under wraps, it involves the death of a Yuan Ying ancestor. While Dou Niu Peak's cultivation techniques are ordinary, the accompanying 'Control Lightning Technique' is truly exquisite and exceptionally sophisticated. If the Lan Dou Sect could secretly cultivate a group of cultivators proficient in this technique, it would definitely be a formidable weapon."</p><p>Even the most sophisticated techniques are useless if you can't cultivate them; they're just so much useless paper. Isn't that precisely why the Lan Dou Sect ended up the way it did?</p><p>The robed man scoffed, his brow furrowed slightly. "Tenth Brother, I remember you kept a copy of the *Lei Yi Technique*.  Are you thinking of cultivating it?  Be careful, you might go mad!"</p><p>The dwarf chuckled dryly. "I don't want to end up like them, living in constant fear, hiding in a cave like an icy coffin at the bottom of the sea. I kept the technique to study it, to see if there's anything I can learn from it."</p><p>The robed man's expression softened slightly. "The Eldest Brother and I will present this technique to Master. With Master's insight, he should be able to glean something useful from it. We'll ask Master for guidance then. Don't try to cultivate it yourself, to avoid any accidents."</p><p>"Thank you for the reminder, Second Brother. I understand!"</p><p>The dwarf bowed.</p><p>The robed man then addressed the square-faced young man.  "Eldest Brother, you're going into the lion's den with the corpse puppet. Be careful.  The island is teeming with Foundation Establishment cultivators from various sects. If you can't get what we need, self-destruct the corpse puppet and retreat immediately. The cultivators outside the Lan Dou Sect will only think it's an internal matter.  Their uncertainty will buy us time; that's our opportunity."</p><p>Upon hearing this, everyone's gaze fell upon the two people standing behind the square-faced young man.</p><p>These two men stood with their eyes closed, silent as statues.</p><p>Strangely, their vital signs were normal.</p><p>Even more astonishing was their identity: they were disciples expelled from Dou Niu Peak, whom they had captured, yet now they obeyed their former enemies implicitly, acting as guards.</p><p>"It's a pity Master only gave us two Blood Corpse Insects. If we had more, we could control several Foundation Establishment corpse puppets to self-destruct, trapping all the cultivators on the island, and it wouldn't be so troublesome,"</p><p>someone muttered.</p><p>The robed man glared at him. "Do you think cultivating these strange Blood Corpse Insects is so easy? Master cultivated them for an unknown length of time, using insect-controlling techniques, just to barely upgrade them to the third stage. If we had more, Black Serpent Mountain would be bankrupt!"</p><p>"Enough, let's stop wasting time. I'm leaving now. We must get what we need this time. Anyone who slacks off or makes a mistake, I'll flay them alive!"</p><p>The square-faced young man coldly snorted, and with his corpse puppet, flew out of the shadows.</p>
