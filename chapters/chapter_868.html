<h1>Chapter 860: The Kui Dragon</h1><p>“Fourth Brother, is this the Xue junior brother you took on as a disciple?”</p><p>Another figure in black robes looked over, appraising the shopkeeper from head to toe.</p><p>The gaze from beneath the robes was exceptionally sharp.</p><p>The shopkeeper looked uncomfortable, quickly bowed deeply, and respectfully said, “Junior Brother Xue Ming greets Second Brother and the other senior brothers.”</p><p>The Second Brother grunted, nodded slightly, and said, “Fourth Brother’s judgment should be sound. Junior Brother Xue, as long as you work diligently, the Master will not mistreat you. Although we are not of the same bloodline, our divine scriptural paths are similar, and we are all forced to cultivate human techniques; even the insect-gu arts can only serve as a supplement. Between us, there is no difference other than bloodline.  A little guidance from the Master will benefit you for a lifetime.  By the way, this is a magic weapon the Master asked me to give you. Refine it upon returning; it can be used for self-defense.”</p><p>Saying this, the robed figure produced a long blade and handed it to Xue Ming.</p><p>Xue Ming was overjoyed, receiving it with both hands and prostrating himself, “I will forever remember the Master's grace in bestowing this treasure.”</p><p>The Second Brother chuckled, waved his hand, and said, “The Master will bestow many more treasures in the future. You may go now, and do as your Fourth Brother instructs…”</p><p>Shopkeeper Xue Ming, delighted with his treasure, left happily.</p><p>At this time, the Fourth Brother asked doubtfully, “Second Brother, is this blade truly a gift from the Master?”</p><p>“I encountered an unwise human cultivator on the way and conveniently killed him and took it.”</p><p>The Second Brother said nonchalantly, “The Xue Ming you recruited will be useful in Tianxing City. Furthermore, the Master isn't like other clansmen, harboring deep hatred for humans; taking him as a direct disciple is quite possible. Consider the treasure a gift to family. Time is of the essence; let's set off quickly. We must set up the Beast King Banner in time, lest we ruin everything.”</p><p>The group set off, pursuing Qin Sang and the others, but this was human territory, so they moved cautiously, avoiding contact with human cultivators.</p><p>At this point, another person spoke, “Second Brother, Fourth Brother, the eldest brother is traveling with those human cultivators. After so long, their identities won't be revealed, will they?”</p><p>“No!”</p><p>The Fourth Brother said confidently, “The ancient treasure, the Crimson Yuan Shawl, bestowed by the Master, can conceal our tribe's identity and disguise us as human cultivators. Unless we encounter a Yuan Ying stage cultivator, there's no chance of exposure. I've used this treasure to interact with human cultivators in Tianxing City without revealing myself.  Unfortunately, it's a damaged treasure, and the Master has no way to repair it; it will be destroyed after a few uses.”</p><p>“That’s good. However, according to the eldest brother’s message, this matter seems quite complicated. Since it's for the Master to find a treasure, why has it turned into hunting demons?  Even a late-stage Demon Core demon beast should be manageable with us brothers manipulating the Beast King Banner. Why make it so complicated?”</p><p>The Fourth Brother's tone was also doubtful, “The eldest brother mentioned that this demon beast seems to be a spirit beast raised by a cultivator. To obtain that treasure, we must start with these people.  However, they're not easy to deal with, so this trip is likely to probe their strength. With the Master away, we must proceed cautiously. That's why the eldest brother made such an arrangement.  Once we arrive, we mustn't act hastily, but wait for the eldest brother's signal.”</p><p>…</p><p>Two months later.</p><p>Qin Sang and the others arrived at an unfamiliar sea area, still flying on their magic treasures.</p><p>During these days, they had never stopped practicing their formations. Now, the five had fully mastered the Heavenly Cold Fierce Wind Array and worked together seamlessly, able to unleash the array's true power.</p><p>The young man surnamed Fang was also very pleased.</p><p>At this time, a small island appeared ahead.  After a turn of their flight, they flew directly toward the island, then circled briefly before landing on it.</p><p>The group set foot on solid ground, climbed to a high point, and looked around. They found that the island was not large and the spiritual energy was exceptionally thin.  There were no signs of demon beasts, and it didn't look like a large demon lair either, which puzzled them.</p><p>“Friend Fang, you brought us to this godforsaken place. What demon are you planning to hunt?”</p><p>The young man surnamed Fang remained calm, found a clean spot to sit cross-legged, and said, “Fellow Daoists, don't worry. The time hasn't come yet. We just need to wait.”</p><p>“Wait?”</p><p>The young man surnamed Fang nodded and pointed to the northeast.  “The beast's lair is there, but it only comes out on rainy days. The island's terrain is unique; whenever there's heavy rain, thunder will inevitably strike, and this thunder attracts the beast. This place is at the edge of the North Sea, so we won't have to wait too long.”</p><p>“Thunder and rain…”</p><p>Qiu Ji doubtfully said, “Is it a thunder beast?”</p><p>The young man surnamed Fang smiled without answering.</p><p>Seeing this, the others could only patiently clear an area and wait quietly for the rainy day to arrive. To ensure success, they continued to practice the array.</p><p>They waited for five days.</p><p>Late into the sixth night, a sudden gale swept in, the sky darkening with storm clouds that rapidly gathered, instantly blotting out the stars.</p><p>The waves crashed wildly.</p><p>*Rumble…*</p><p>Salty sea wind carried heavy moisture; distant thunder rumbled, and flashes of lightning flickered within the ominous clouds.</p><p>Everyone rose abruptly, exchanging glances of excitement and anticipation.</p><p>“Friend Fang, can you tell us what kind of beast it is now?”  Ma Debao, stroking his beard, pressed, unable to contain his curiosity.</p><p>The young man surnamed Fang stared intently at the beast's lair, his eyes shining with excitement. Then he turned, glancing at the dark, stormy sky behind them before calmly retracting his gaze.  He said quietly,  "Since things have come to this, I'll no longer conceal it. Our target is a Kui Dragon!"</p><p>“Kui Dragon!”</p><p>“It's a Kui Dragon!”</p><p>Gasps of astonishment rippled through the group. No one expected this beast!</p><p>“No wonder we had to wait for a thunderstorm! No wonder you were so secretive! It's said that Kui Dragons are divine beasts that control thunder; they summon and extinguish lightning at will.  Artifacts crafted from their hide and bones easily grant the user mastery over thunder, transforming them into supremely powerful, yang-based treasures! If news of a Kui Dragon's appearance got out, even Yuan Ying Masters would be stirred into action!”</p><p>Qin Sang, expert in crafting, knew rare materials intimately. Thunder-based treasures were exceptionally rare; but those made from Kui Dragon hide and bone directly conferred this power.</p><p>The Kui Dragon was treasure from head to tail; no wonder the young man surnamed Fang was so cautious.</p><p>The young man surnamed Fang chuckled, “If it were a true Kui Dragon, then what Friend Qin says would be accurate. But Kui Dragons are ancient divine beasts—how could one exist in this age? This beast is merely a creature with some Kui Dragon bloodline; it's not that exaggerated. However, its thunder abilities are indeed formidable. We'll have to rely on everyone to activate the spirit array to withstand the lightning and suppress the beast.”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded; that made sense. True descendants of ancient divine beasts were rarely seen, even in the Demon Sea.</p>
