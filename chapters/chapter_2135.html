<h1>Chapter 2125: Dharma Body Strikes</h1><p>Mist and rain blurred the world.</p><p>The army marched in silence.</p><p>The path ahead, initially dim, suddenly plunged into absolute darkness. Within the blackness, countless eerie figures seemed to lurk—the Thunder Soldiers conjured by the Nine Heavens Azure Pool Thunderstorm Grand Art.</p><p>Both sides, having clashed numerous times already, collided without preamble. In an instant, blinding lightning flashed, and magical treasures flew through the air. The scene within the downpour grew increasingly chaotic, illuminated by the brilliance of Daoist arts and divine abilities, making it difficult to distinguish friend from foe.</p><p>In a short span of time, the battle had become incredibly fierce.</p><p>On the battlefield, Li Yue and the others were searching for Qin Sang's trace.</p><p>"Form the array!"</p><p>Unable to locate Qin Sang, Li Yue didn't persist. He transmitted the order and shifted his gaze towards Min Zhuo.</p><p>Min Zhuo nodded solemnly, chanting an incantation and forming a peculiar hand seal. His figure gradually became ethereal as wisps of white cloud qi surged around him.</p><p>In a flash, Min Zhuo transformed into a mass of cloud mist in place. The dense cloud qi seemed boundless, continuously expanding outwards without thinning. Min Zhuo's figure vanished within the cloud mist, his whereabouts unknown.</p><p>Min Zhuo's position was the eye of the formation. His actions signified the activation of the grand array.</p><p>While battling the Thunder Soldiers, the Lu King's army's battle formation had undergone multiple transformations, but its previous performance was unremarkable, displaying no exceptional power. Now, with the array activated, its true profoundness was revealed!</p><p>'Whoosh…'</p><p>A chilling wind swept through the downpour.</p><p>Clusters of white cloud mist drifted across the battlefield. The cloud qi was light and airy, floating upwards, morphing into various shapes.  Simultaneously, these clouds expanded, and new clouds continued to form, gradually connecting into a single mass.</p><p>In an instant, the battlefield was enveloped by a gigantic white cloud mass.  The cloud's emergence, instead of amplifying the downpour's intensity, actually seemed to weaken it.</p><p>The cloud mass expanded, its qi continuously rising.</p><p>In reality, the cloud qi wasn't as weightless as it appeared. After the cloud mass formed, the void trembled frequently, as if a colossal hammer repeatedly struck the heavens, attempting to shatter the Nine Heavens Azure Pool!</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>…</p><p>The cloud mass surged like a raging tide, shaking heaven and earth.</p><p>Since Qin Sang had unleashed the Nine Heavens Azure Pool Thunderstorm Grand Art, this was the first time the curtain of rain had been so significantly affected. In some areas, the downpour abruptly lessened, the rain becoming intermittent; in others, the sky began to clear.</p><p>Whenever this occurred, the nearby Thunder Soldiers' strength would be impacted, with some even dissipating before they could self-detonate.</p><p>In these areas, the Lu King's army launched a counteroffensive. Initially suppressed, they finally gained the upper hand. As the tide turned in one battlefield after another, the Lu King's army's morale soared.</p><p>However, Qin Sang wouldn't passively watch the Nine Heavens Azure Pool Thunderstorm Grand Art be broken. Lightning flashed intensely in the sky, striking the cloud mass with world-shaking thunderous might.</p><p>'Crack!'</p><p>'Rumble!'</p><p>…</p><p>Each bolt of lightning tore a large hole in the cloud mass, ripping apart the cloud qi. The lightning's residual energy could be clearly seen wreaking havoc within the cloud mass, annihilating countless wisps of qi. But as the residual energy dissipated, an endless stream of cloud qi immediately replenished the gaps.</p><p>Under the relentless barrage of lightning, the cloud mass became riddled with holes, constantly undergoing a cycle of tearing and mending. Yet, these attacks couldn't stop the cloud mass's continued ascent. The collision between the two forces intensified!</p><p>Gradually, the cloud qi, initially a small mass, grew into a boundless, vast sea of clouds, seemingly capable of rivaling the thunderstorm itself.</p><p>When the cloud qi filled the nine heavens, it might truly be able to sweep away the Nine Heavens Azure Pool and devour all the 'rainwater'!</p><p>While Min Zhuo and the others were fully focused on driving the formation, Li Yue remained vigilant, utilizing his Spirit Eye secret art to scan every corner of the battlefield.</p><p>Failing to find Qin Sang, he looked up at the sky and murmured, "How much longer can you endure? You should be making your move soon!"</p><p>This thought had barely crossed his mind when a sense of foreboding struck Li Yue.</p><p>Within his perception, four auras simultaneously appeared in four different directions. These auras were familiar—Qin Sang, the Frost Marten, the Stone Statue, and the Firebird, old adversaries who had repeatedly appeared on the battlefield.</p><p>The moment they materialized, they erupted with astonishing momentum and speed, charging towards a specific point in the cloud mass.</p><p>Li Yue knew that was precisely where Clan Leader Min Zhuo was located. The enemy was indeed aiming to destroy the formation's eye!</p><p>Everything was proceeding as the Grand Preceptor had predicted. Li Yue quickly identified which aura belonged to Qin Sang and personally intercepted him.</p><p>Back then, Qin Sang, alone, had dared to charge into the formation against a multitude of experts. His strength had been proven. His previous performance had indeed been incredibly formidable. Among those present, only Li Yue dared to single-handedly obstruct Qin Sang!</p><p>Of course, the others had previously been apprehensive before Qin Sang due to their fear of the Five Elements Crown. Now that they had a method to counter both the Five Elements Crown and the Nine Heavens Azure Pool Thunderstorm Grand Art, they no longer held the same level of dread.</p><p>Without needing Li Yue's command, the cultivators had already retrieved the Six Harmonies Decree but kept them concealed, preparing to surprise Qin Sang.</p><p>Li Yue flew forward, spirit light flickering in his brow, projecting three white streams of qi that landed before him, transforming into three companion beasts.</p><p>These three companion beasts were all variant species of demon oxen, tall, robust, and exceptionally strong. However, their races differed: a Green Ox, a Black Ox, and a White Ox with a rhinoceros horn, its bloodline unknown.</p><p>'Moo!'</p><p>The three demon oxen' roars were comparable to thunder.  Each expelled a stream of qi from its nostrils—green, black, and white—which simultaneously converged upon Li Yue.</p><p>In the next moment, the three streams of qi transformed into a tri-colored battle armor on Li Yue's body. The armor was incredibly heavy, its surface shimmering with three-colored spirit light.</p><p>Li Yue's physique wasn't particularly imposing, but clad in this battle armor, he exuded an astonishing, awe-inspiring pressure, possessing boundless strength. His eyes resembled two deep pools, looking down upon all creation!</p><p>Back then, Lu Gan, after a brief clash with Qin Sang, had learned that Qin Sang was a body cultivator. Thus, the Grand Preceptor had specifically invited Li Yue to emerge from seclusion to counter Qin Sang. However, due to their apprehension towards the Five Elements Divine Light, they had previously been probing, and Li Yue had few opportunities to act.</p><p>Clad in his battle armor, Li Yue took a step forward, instantly crossing countless sand dunes and blocking Qin Sang's path.</p><p>If Qin Sang only possessed the strength he had previously displayed, and with the Five Elements Crown and Nine Heavens Azure Pool Thunderstorm Grand Art being countered, Li Yue was confident in intercepting him.</p><p>Li Yue could even spare attention to sense his surroundings, guarding against sneak attacks.</p><p>In the next moment, Li Yue suddenly noticed something amiss about Qin Sang. His pupils abruptly contracted.</p><p>He hadn't clashed with Qin Sang many times, yet for some reason, Qin Sang now seemed somewhat unfamiliar and strange.</p><p>"That spirit treasure resembling a spirit tablet is gone…"</p><p>This thought flashed through Li Yue's mind as Qin Sang drew near.</p><p>Without giving Li Yue time to ponder, five-colored brilliance flashed from Qin Sang's sleeve as the Five Elements Crown spun out.</p><p>In the next instant, the Five Elements Divine Light bypassed Li Yue and shot towards the formation's eye.</p><p>Qin Sang unleashing the Five Elements Divine Light immediately upon engaging was unexpected, but Li Yue and the others were prepared.</p><p>Dots of crimson fire appeared within the cloud mist, instantly transforming into clusters of blazing flames. Within the flames, the Six Harmonies Decrees materialized, turning to face the formation's eye. The jewels inlaid within the decrees emitted a bright blue light, and a ring of blue flame surged into existence before the formation's eye.</p><p>The blue flames blazed fiercely, forming a circular ring of fire. The Five Elements Divine Light struck the very center of the fire ring.</p><p>Behind the fire ring, within the formation's eye, cloud mist swirled, Min Zhuo's figure flickering in and out of view.</p><p>At this moment, all the experts on the battlefield anxiously watched the formation's eye. The figure within the eye wavered slightly, then shifted along with the eye. Min Zhuo remained unharmed!</p><p>"It worked!"</p><p>Everyone rejoiced.</p><p>The Six Harmonies Decree could indeed counter that crown! From this day forward, they need no longer fear the Five Elements Divine Light!</p><p>Seeing the Five Elements Divine Light neutralized, Qin Sang's expression remained unchanged, seemingly unsurprised. He had used it so many times; it would have been strange if the opponent hadn't developed a countermeasure.</p><p>Without pausing, Qin Sang continued his advance unabated, closing the distance to Li Yue.</p><p>At this moment, Li Yue's mood was the polar opposite of the others'.</p><p>The instant Qin Sang made his move, he finally understood the source of the strange feeling.</p><p>"Dual cultivation of body and dharma! No! This isn't a Dharma Idol. Could it be…"</p><p>Li Yue initially assumed Qin Sang had used some secret art to conceal his cultivation. But when a sword light stung his eyes, he immediately realized a possibility.</p><p>In an instant, his vision was filled with countless sword shadows, each incredibly sharp, shattering the void.</p><p>"A Sword Cultivator!"</p><p>Li Yue was filled with shock and anger. He had prepared for a fierce battle with Qin Sang, all his preparations based on the premise that Qin Sang was a body cultivator.</p><p>He had been constantly vigilant against sneak attacks from the shadows, never expecting the variable to come from Qin Sang himself!</p><p>The consequences of this misjudgment were severe. Even though he and Qin Sang were of the same realm, losing the initiative meant he had already lost half the battle. Moreover, one of his companion beasts remained within the Eight Desolate Formation Diagram; he wasn't at his full strength!</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>Enveloped by sword shadows, Li Yue instinctively raised his arm and struck with a forceful palm.</p><p>The power of a single palm transformed into a terrifying hurricane. Within the hurricane, a gigantic palm shadow materialized, capable of flattening mountains with ease.</p><p>The sword shadows were dispersed, but Li Yue's mood didn't improve. He found himself within a profound night sky, surrounded by countless stars, each resembling a spirit sword, imbued with powerful sword intent.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>Within the boundless starry sky, even the gigantic palm shadow appeared minuscule. The palm struck the empty void. The sword stars, impacted by the palm wind, merely shimmered before quickly returning to normal.</p><p>…</p><p>As Li Yue fell into the sword array, Si Lu and the others also engaged their opponents. Fierce battles erupted in three directions, bursts of multicolored light erupting. Only Qin Sang's area remained eerily quiet.</p><p>To evade the Five Elements Divine Light, Min Zhuo had been forced to shift the formation's eye, causing a momentary stagnation in the formation.</p><p>Qin Sang seized the opportunity. The Nine Heavens Azure Pool Thunderstorm Grand Art's power surged, unleashing a furious torrent of thunder that forcefully pushed the cloud mass down a significant distance. The Si You Clan experts were naturally also suppressed by the thunderous might.</p><p>With the shift in momentum, despite their smaller numbers, their side possessed overwhelming气势, making it difficult to determine the ultimate victor.</p><p>Meanwhile, at the edge of the downpour, a figure suddenly materialized—the Grand Preceptor.</p><p>A sharp glint flashed in his eyes as he stared intently at Qin Sang.</p><p>"Dual cultivation of body and dharma!"</p><p>The Grand Preceptor finally realized he had still underestimated this Fellow Daoist Qin.</p><p>Dual cultivation of body and dharma, and to such a high degree of mastery in both.</p><p>His Dharma Idol, at only early Soul Formation stage, had been able to defeat numerous experts consecutively. What level of power did his higher-cultivation Dharma Body possess?</p><p>Moreover, even the Heaven Trapping Golden Shackles couldn't restrain him!</p><p>This Fellow Daoist Qin's true strength likely wasn't inferior to a true late-stage cultivator. He alone could serve as Si Lu's backing!</p><p>Thinking of this, the Grand Preceptor inwardly mused that Attendant Xia had likely truly perished. Otherwise, with two late-stage powerhouses, they could have openly returned to the battlefield, eliminating the need for painstaking schemes and plots.</p><p>Facing two late-stage powerhouses, even the Si Emperor would have to carefully consider the consequences.</p><p>They had finally forced out the enemy's trump card, though it was somewhat unexpected.</p><p>However, for them, this outcome might be preferable to Attendant Xia remaining unscathed.</p><p>Although this Fellow Daoist Qin possessed strength comparable to a late-stage powerhouse, he hadn't yet reached that realm. In certain aspects, he was still inferior to a true late-stage cultivator. This was his weakness.</p><p>Qin Sang seemed to sense something, glancing over, his gaze unfathomable beneath the rain.</p><p>It appeared to be a casual glance; his true target remained the formation's eye. After all, Clan Leader Min Zhuo was presiding over the eye. Eliminating him here would eliminate much future trouble.</p><p>Qin Sang raised his right hand, pointing towards the space above the formation's eye.</p><p>'Rumble…'</p><p>An unusual thunderous sound emanated from the nine heavens.</p><p>The Thunder Pool within Qin Sang began to circulate. A point of thunder light condensed at his fingertip, transforming into a bolt of lightning that struck directly at the heavens!</p><p>'Crack!'</p><p>Within the curtain of rain, thunder erupted, illuminating every detail. Lightning threads danced among the raindrops, enveloping the entire rain-covered domain, forming a fine net of lightning in the sky.</p><p>The darkness was swept away, the surroundings bright as day!</p><p>The surrounding Heaven and Earth Yuan Qi became turbulent, drawn by the lightning threads, forming a spirit tide. New lightning then arose within the spirit tide, colossal thunder serpents and lightning pythons surging to the crest of the spirit tide, treading upon the void, forming profound and mystical lightning runes.</p><p>The runes hung in the air, radiating thunderous light, manifesting the form of a Thunder Seal, high in the sky, like the heart of the heavens, the Lord of Thunder!</p><p>It was a complete Five Thunders Heavenly Heart Seal!</p><p>Today, after the Thunder Ancestor's possession, Qin Sang finally unleashed the complete Five Thunders Heavenly Heart Seal Rune!</p><p>The manifestation of this seal faintly resembled the grandeur of that time!</p><p>'Crack!'</p><p>Thunder rolled, and the cultivators within the downpour couldn't help but squint, their hearts filled with terror.</p><p>Outside the rain, the Grand Preceptor's expression shifted slightly. He flicked his finger, and a golden light shot out, revealing the Heaven Trapping Golden Shackles. He had already secretly prepared this treasure, anticipating the unexpected.</p><p>In his hands, its power was incomparable to when it was wielded by Lu Gan.</p><p>Both Qin Sang and the Grand Preceptor acted with extreme swiftness. The golden light erupted almost simultaneously with the appearance of the Thunder Seal, dividing the heavens and earth into two halves—one blazing with lightning, the other bathed in golden light.</p><p>The golden light forcefully penetrated the curtain of rain. A gigantic golden lock materialized at its center, sharing the sky with the Five Thunders Heavenly Heart Seal.</p><p>Simultaneously, thunder illuminated the world, seemingly about to engulf the formation's eye and Min Zhuo.</p><p>"It's over!"</p><p>This thought arose in some minds.</p><p>Facing such terrifying thunderous might, relying solely on Min Zhuo himself, the odds were stacked against him. It all depended on whether Lu Gan and the Grand Preceptor could rescue him in time.</p><p>'Crack!'</p><p>The faint sound of the lock's clasp clicking resonated clearly amidst the thunder, unleashing invisible waves that seemed to imprison both heaven and earth, along with the very thunder itself!</p>
