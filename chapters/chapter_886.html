<h1>Chapter 878: Superb Acting</h1><p>“I have two spiritual roots!”</p><p>Fang Ting raised her hand high, skipping to the front of the crowd amidst gasps of surprise and envy.  Facing the cultivator surnamed Chen, her face beamed with excitement.</p><p>Just then, she heard a whispered message in her ear, quickly swallowing the word "Master" she was about to utter.  Composing herself, she bowed respectfully, "Reporting to Senior, my name is Fang Ting. I possess dual water and earth spiritual roots. Please examine me, Senior."</p><p>The others couldn't help but murmur among themselves, suspecting something was amiss.</p><p>The girl's acting was simply too poor.</p><p>The two clearly knew each other, and she might even have been accepted as a disciple already.</p><p>However, no one held it against her. Possessing dual spiritual roots, she could enter the Verdant Isle Sect directly, bypassing any tests.</p><p>Cultivator Chen nodded with a smile. "Indeed, dual spiritual roots. Come with me. The rest of you may ascend the Cloud Bridge. Remember to perform well."</p><p>Beckoning Fang Ting to his side, Cultivator Chen turned to leave.</p><p>At that moment, Fang Ting's lips moved slightly, as if transmitting a message.</p><p>Cultivator Chen paused momentarily, his gaze shifting to the disguised cultivator.  His expression remained unchanged, and without a word, he flew back to the island with Fang Ting.</p><p>Fang Ting pouted slightly, giving the disguised cultivator a helpless look before departing.</p><p>The disguised cultivator smiled wryly to himself. He had guessed Fang Ting possessed decent talent, but he hadn't expected her to have connections with a Verdant Isle Sect Golden Core cultivator.  He regretted trying to get close to her now.</p><p>Fang Ting mentioning him to Cultivator Chen might have been well-intentioned, but for him, it could be a blessing or a curse.</p><p>He knew that after such brief contact, Fang Ting couldn't possibly have any feelings for him.</p><p>But if Cultivator Chen valued her highly and wanted to eliminate any potential distractions to her cultivation, expelling him would be a grave injustice.</p><p>The disguised cultivator could do nothing but wait and see.</p><p>After Cultivator Chen left, the remaining three continued to prepare the Cloud Bridge, while the cultivator in the blue robe began assessing the crowd's talent and bone age, eventually selecting over thirty individuals.</p><p>"Fellow Daoists, you do not meet the requirements of our Verdant Isle Sect. Please return."</p><p>These individuals, possessing four or five spiritual roots, were already quite old, yet stuck at the sixth level of Qi Refinement.  Their faces were grim; they had known their chances were slim, coming merely to try their luck, but they hadn't expected to be dismissed before the test even began.</p><p>The Cloud Bridge was quickly prepared.  With only a brief instruction to keep walking on the bridge without stopping and not to use any talismans or artifacts, they urged the group to ascend.</p><p>The group exchanged glances.</p><p>No one knew what trial awaited them on the Cloud Bridge, and no one wanted to be the first.</p><p>At that moment, the disguised cultivator stepped forward, gazing at the Cloud Bridge with a calm expression. He walked to the bridgehead at a steady pace and stepped onto the Cloud Bridge without hesitation.</p><p>The four Verdant Isle Sect cultivators exchanged a look. The swordsman nodded slightly, a hint of admiration in his eyes.</p><p>The others, seeing this, suddenly understood, cursing themselves inwardly for being foolish. The swordsman had made it clear that the test wasn't necessarily about reaching the end.</p><p>Daring to be the first to ascend the bridge demonstrated courage, easily leaving an impression on the Verdant Isle Sect cultivators and gaining an advantage.</p><p>The test was everywhere.</p><p>No longer hesitating, the group surged onto the Cloud Bridge.</p><p>The disguised cultivator walked at the front. The cloud beneath his feet felt soft and elastic, but spiritual energy was required to stand on it. At first, there were no unusual occurrences, but after a few steps, a strange wind appeared, blowing from both sides of the bridge.</p><p>At the same time, the scenery around him changed.</p><p>Both ends of the Cloud Bridge vanished, leaving only the group and an endless white bridge stretching towards the horizon. The lake below seemed to stretch infinitely, its surface shimmering, its depths unfathomable.</p><p>The Skyeye Butterfly was still asleep, and the disguised cultivator, unsure if any Nascent Soul cultivators were observing, didn't dare wake it.</p><p>From the moment the Cloud Bridge appeared, the Skyeye Butterfly had recognized it as an extension of the island's formation.</p><p>The disguised cultivator calmly observed the changes in the Cloud Bridge, his face betraying no alarm.</p><p>If the Cloud Bridge tested strength, his ninth level of Qi Refinement was sufficient to handle most variables. If it tested character or willpower, he had even less to worry about, needing only to be careful not to overact.</p><p>Continuing forward, the wind intensified, requiring him to circulate his spiritual energy for protection.</p><p>At this point, the disguised cultivator deliberately slowed his pace.  Others were catching up, and they unhesitatingly overtook him.</p><p>Circulating his spiritual energy for protection, he was passed by one person after another, continuing forward at a steady pace while secretly observing the changes in those ahead.</p><p>The illusion on the Cloud Bridge couldn't be too strong. If it was a test of character, perhaps with the help of the jade Buddha, he could be immune, in which case his acting would be crucial.</p><p>As he progressed, the wind grew stronger, lashing against him like whips.</p><p>The group could only slow their pace.</p><p>At the same time, subtle changes occurred in the water below. Something seemed to be tempting them, whispering repeatedly, "Jump down! Jump down!"</p><p>The end of the bridge was still nowhere in sight. The Cloud Bridge's length was despair-inducing, and the distance between them grew. Those at opposite ends could no longer see each other.  He imagined that in the end, one would only see oneself, walking alone on the bridge.</p><p>These changes subtly influenced their mental states.</p><p>This Cloud Bridge was a dual test of character and strength.</p><p>Someone suddenly realized, "This isn't a Cloud Bridge at all; it's clearly borrowed some of the power from the Verdant Isle Sect's Path of Inquiry."</p><p>Suddenly, a young man screamed, clutching his head, his face contorted in various expressions. Then, his footing gave way, and he fell.</p><p>Everyone's hearts jolted as they watched him plummet towards the water.  A flying sword appeared out of thin air, catching him and carrying him away.</p><p>On the shore,</p><p>The four cultivators stood together, observing the changes in the group on the bridge.</p><p>"Such weak character?"</p><p>The swordsman frowned.</p><p>The cultivator in blue said, "He has three spiritual roots and is only fifteen years old."</p><p>The middle-aged cultivator nodded slightly. "He can be molded, but requires tempering. Send him to the Crucible Hall."</p><p>The flying sword carried the young man back, and the swordsman pointed to the left.</p><p>The young man, utterly exhausted and shaken, sat down dejectedly to recover, unaware of his fate.</p><p>Starting with the young man, more and more people fell from the bridge, directed by the four cultivators to either the left or the right.</p><p>The disguised cultivator continued walking on the Cloud Bridge, now unable to see anyone else ahead or behind.  He didn't know how many remained.  A profound sense of isolation washed over him as the temptation from the water intensified.</p><p>The illusion couldn't affect his mental state, but his spiritual energy was rapidly depleting in the ever-increasing wind.</p><p>He put on a superb act, his expression twisting and turning, sometimes confused, as if struggling against the Cloud Bridge.  His spiritual energy fluctuated with his changing expressions.</p><p>"Just about right..."</p><p>Sensing his spiritual energy nearing depletion, the disguised cultivator's face suddenly filled with panic. Unable to maintain his spiritual energy any longer, he tumbled from the Cloud Bridge.</p>
