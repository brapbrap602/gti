<h1>Chapter 660: Secrets of the Seven Killing Hall</h1><p>Qin Sang quickly cast several spells, suppressing Du Han's cultivation.  Although it was a carefully planned ambush, even with thorough preparations, Qin Sang hadn't expected to capture Du Han so easily.  After all, Du Han had been a Core Formation cultivator for many years and hailed from a prestigious sect; he certainly had some trump cards.  Originally, Qin Sang's plan was to kill Du Han and, before his soul dissipated, seize a chance to search his soul, obtaining the crucial information he sought. After that, escape would be his priority.</p><p>Now, having successfully captured Du Han, the immediate pressure from the Li Wu Palace was lifted, allowing him to plan things calmly. Leaving Du Han aside, Qin Sang meticulously cleaned the battlefield, erasing all traces of the encounter. Where complete concealment was impossible, he created extensive damage to mask his actions.</p><p>While clearing the traces, Qin Sang found Du Han's Black Water Mirror in the woods. Of Du Han's two magical treasures, the bone claw was destroyed, while the Black Water Mirror was only damaged.  Defiled by the bloody divine light, the mirror’s power was significantly diminished, causing it to fall from the sky.  Being a magical treasure, it didn’t suffer the same fate as a magical artifact, which would have its essence completely destroyed.  After erasing Du Han's presence, Qin Sang planned to refine the mirror in his dantian for a while to restore it.</p><p>However, as the mirror was a gift from the Li Wu Palace, Qin Sang wasn't sure whether the palace had tampered with it, so he dared not act rashly. He stored it in his Qianjun Ring, intending to claim it after leaving the Western Frontier, or even the Wu Shen Continent. The Black Water Mirror was quite powerful, a top-tier low-grade magical treasure. Sadly, facing Qin Sang's surprise attack, Du Han was unable to unleash its full power and was swiftly incapacitated. In a fair fight, Qin Sang would never have won so easily.</p><p>Although the Li Wu Palace was involved, the Cang Lang Sea was vast. Once Qin Sang reached the human cultivator's territory, he could use it cautiously without too much worry.</p><p>After ensuring everything was secure, Qin Sang carried Du Han into the depths of the mountains, to a hidden cave.</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>Qin Sang threw Du Han to the ground. Du Han awoke, his Core Formation cultivator aura still strong. He glared coldly at Qin Sang.  "I’ve roamed the Demon Sea for years, yet I fall to a nobody at my doorstep.  Victory and defeat are the ways of the world. Kill me, or do as you wish!"</p><p>Du Han then closed his eyes, refusing to speak further, seemingly seeking a swift death.  Qin Sang, however, had ways to make him talk.</p><p>Soul searching would destroy Du Han's soul, and Qin Sang wasn't ready to kill him yet, so he used the "Soul Seizing Curse."  Using the curse on Du Han took far less time than on Foundation Establishment cultivators, fortunately, Qin Sang was prepared and asked the most crucial questions first, preventing the need for a soul search.  As expected, the Li Wu Palace indeed had a method similar to a Soul Lamp; upon Du Han's death, they would instantly know.  He would have to wait until he left the Western Frontier and secured an escape route before acting.</p><p>The first half of the "Heavenly Yin Corpse Manual" only contained the method to create living corpses from Foundation Establishment cultivators. Qin Sang dared not use it on Du Han. Unable to put him in his Corpse Puppet Bag, he took a black coffin from his Qianjun Ring, placing Du Han inside and carrying it on his back.  Qin Sang then layered multiple restrictive enchantments on the outside of the coffin to prevent detection and used a ribbon-like artifact as camouflage.</p><p>With the coffin on his back, Qin Sang fed the Sky-Eyed Butterfly, then took out the fat silkworm, only to find it hadn’t yet formed its cocoon. He put it back in its container. He then summoned Ya Gu and checked on her condition.  Without a moment's hesitation, he left the cave and flew towards Qianhu Village.</p><p>He needed to leave the Western Frontier, but before that, he had to take the old witch doctor from Qianhu Village.  Too many people in the Xiong Shan region, including those in Jing Lei Village and Bai Hua Palace, had seen Qin Sang's face; it was impossible to erase all traces.  From Du Han, he learned that the Li Wu Palace had only one Nascent Soul ancestor, comparable in strength to the eight righteous sects of the Xiao Han Domain.  They were undisputed overlords in the Western Frontier, but compared to the entire Cang Lang Sea, especially the human territories, they were insignificant.</p><p>Qin Sang planned to leave the Wu Shen Continent, no longer fearing the Li Wu Palace’s threat.  Revealing his face was no longer a concern; he didn't believe they would launch a large-scale attack for a Core Formation cultivator. Even if others had seen him, once outside the Li Wu Palace’s influence, finding him would be like searching for a needle in the ocean.</p><p>The old shaman of Qianhu Village was different. He was the only one besides Ya Gu who had seen Qin Sang's severed left arm enveloped in corpse energy!</p><p>This matter was of grave importance, leaving Qin Sang no room for carelessness.  He had naturally used the *Destroying God Incantation* to interrogate Du Han, and now he needed answers to his most pressing questions.</p><p>What he learned was far more complex and shocking than he had imagined!</p><p>Even flying through the air, Qin Sang couldn't help but shiver, feeling as though countless mysteries had suddenly descended upon him, pulling him into a terrifying vortex.</p><p>To understand this, one must first understand the Seven Killing Hall.</p><p>It turned out that the Seven Killing Hall was a hidden realm discovered by human cultivators, located within a storm in the outer reaches of the Canglang Sea!  Even for Du Han, with his Golden Core cultivation, the journey from the Witch God Continent to the Seven Killing Hall would take more than half a year.</p><p>After its discovery, several human cultivators explored the hall and reaped significant rewards.</p><p>Unfortunately, the Seven Killing Hall wasn't always accessible.  It didn't remain open constantly; entry was only possible during its appearances.</p><p>Whenever it appeared, numerous human cultivators would brave the storm to enter.</p><p>Upon hearing this, Qin Sang felt a familiar sense of dread and immediately asked Du Han to recount the past appearances of the Seven Killing Hall.  Shockingly, the intervals between the hall's recent appearances coincided precisely with those of the Purple Micro Palace!</p><p>It was highly improbable that two completely unrelated hidden realms would exhibit such uncanny synchronicity.</p><p>At this point, the last of Qin Sang's hopes vanished.  He likely teleported from the Purple Micro Palace to the Seven Killing Hall, and the mysterious missing ancient corpse that fell from the sky was… him.</p><p>However, the Seven Killing Hall and the Purple Micro Palace weren't entirely identical.</p><p>The Purple Micro Palace was hidden deep within the Ancient Immortal Battlefield, only accessible when the spiritual tide arrived and the palace manifested itself.</p><p>In the Canglang Sea, after years of exploration, human cultivators discovered that the protective array of the Seven Killing Hall experienced a period of low activity every few decades.</p><p>By setting up a large array outside the Seven Killing Hall during this period, even if the hall wasn't manifested, it was possible to forcefully breach the array and gain entry.</p><p>Besides the cultivator responsible for breaching the array, other cultivators were permitted to enter and search for treasures, although they were required to pay a substantial sum of spirit stones to compensate for the array-breaker's efforts.</p><p>While discovered by human cultivators, Witch cultivators could also enter if they paid enough spirit stones.</p><p>However, there was one condition: the Witch cultivator's cultivation could not exceed the Golden Core stage.</p>
