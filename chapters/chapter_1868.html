<h1>Chapter 1859: The Swallowing Seas Clam</h1><p>The unexpected strike failed to achieve its desired effect.  Ling Youwang no longer concealed himself, attempting several times to draw upon the water elemental power within the nearby illusions, only to abandon the effort due to interference from other illusory landscapes.</p><p>Having learned his lesson, Qin Sang deliberately kept his distance from any illusions that Ling Youwang might exploit, spending far more time than he had initially anticipated.</p><p>Qin Sang now held a deep apprehension for the Demon King, abandoning all thoughts of counterattack.  He ceased using the illusions to obstruct Ling Youwang, focusing solely on escaping toward the Jungle Domain.</p><p>“I truly lack the necessary refinement…” Qin Sang sighed inwardly.</p><p>Cultivating both his physical body and Dharma powers, possessing both spirit treasures and profound divine abilities, his current strength was enough to be considered formidable amongst his peers, evident in his exhilarating battle with Marquis Dingxiang.</p><p>Yet, facing a Demon King who had willingly severed his cultivation, he constantly felt suppressed.  Especially when Ling Youwang invoked his Dharma Idol divine abilities, the immense power and unpredictable transformations left Qin Sang in awe.</p><p>He wondered if there existed a peerless genius capable of contending with a Demon King at the Nascent Soul stage. At least, Qin Sang couldn’t achieve it yet, even after nearly slaying Marquis Dingxiang.</p><p>Perhaps when both the *Yuan Shen Sword Nurturing Chapter* and the *Celestial Demon Body Refining Scripture* reached their peak, he might be able to rival Ling Youwang.</p><p>This pursuit had been extremely harrowing for Qin Sang, but also deeply enlightening. He felt he had benefited immensely, though he lacked the opportunity to quietly contemplate these insights. He could only deeply imprint Ling Youwang's every move into his memory.</p><p>Especially in the Dao of the Dharma Idol, Ling Youwang was a veritable teacher.</p><p>A Nascent Soul Demon Cultivator's understanding of the Dharma Idol was less profound than a Demon King’s.</p><p>Observing a true battle between Demon Kings might leave one bewildered and confused, limited by one’s own cultivation and perception.</p><p>A Demon King who had severed his cultivation was a once-in-ten-thousand-years encounter, an unparalleled guide.</p><p>Thinking of this, Qin Sang couldn’t help but feel a pang of regret.  It was a pity their encounter was premature.  If he had waited several decades or a century, progressed further, and possessed true strength to contend with Ling Youwang, leveraging his familiarity with the terrain, he might have had a chance to defeat or even injure the Demon King.</p><p>After such a battle, he would very likely completely comprehend the eleventh layer of the *Yuan Shen Sword Nurturing Chapter*, and it would greatly benefit his breakthrough to the Void Refinement stage.</p><p>Stray thoughts arose.</p><p>Qin Sang remained focused, his mind locked onto Ling Youwang, observing his every action.</p><p>Simultaneously, Ling Youwang kept his gaze fixed on the streak of lightning that was Qin Sang, a strange glint flickering within the dark fish Dharma Idol's gloomy eyes.</p><p>As a Demon King, his perception was naturally sharp. Even if Qin Sang concealed his intentions perfectly, it was inevitable that he would reveal subtle clues, which Ling Youwang seized upon.</p><p>If Qin Sang's previous use of illusions was to set a trap, it suggested he possessed some unique ability.</p><p>However, Qin Sang’s consistent and unerring avoidance of illusions imbued with water elemental power, preventing him from deploying his Dharma Idol divine abilities, was no mere coincidence. He must possess an intimate knowledge of the layout of the illusions in this area.</p><p>This was rather intriguing.</p><p>“Is this child truly without recourse, destined to be chased by this King until his strength is exhausted, forced to surrender?”  This thought flashed through Ling Youwang's mind, his expression suddenly sharpening.</p><p>Qin Sang felt an inexplicable chill.  He knew he couldn't conceal himself from Ling Youwang's Dharma Eye forever.  Looking ahead, he decided it was time, and immediately abandoned his pretense.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>Lightning tore through the sky, flying straight ahead, traversing the illusions, heading directly for the Jungle Domain!</p><p>Ling Youwang snorted coldly, his black fish Dharma Idol’s powerful tail thrashing, slamming heavily against the dark waves.</p><p>*Crash!*</p><p>Waves surged skyward as the fish leaped from the water.</p><p>Mid-leap, the black fish Dharma Idol raised its head high, its massive mouth opening towards the heavens in a silent roar. A gray mist emerged from its throat.</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>The gray mist filled the air. Within the dim void, an outline appeared, resembling an open book.  As it became clearer, it revealed itself to be two clam shells.</p><p>Their inner surfaces were jade-like, adorned with numerous shimmering points of light, like pearls inlaid upon the shells.</p><p>The outer shells, however, were dull gray, devoid of any remarkable features.</p><p>The clam shells were slightly ajar, their inner flesh hollowed out.  Clearly not a living creature, but a refined mystical treasure.</p><p>This treasure was known as the Swallowing Seas Clam, the spirit treasure that had accompanied Ling Youwang for the longest time.</p><p>The clam shells materialized within the gray mist, aligning themselves remotely towards the streak of lightning ahead. The light points within erupted with a dazzling brilliance.</p><p>Strangely, the light points blazed with extreme brightness one moment, then became incredibly dim the next.</p><p>Simultaneously, the surrounding world, including the area around Qin Sang, suddenly darkened, as if dusk had descended.</p><p>*Splash!*</p><p>The black fish Dharma Idol flicked its tail, sending a wave of dark water crashing onto the clam shells.</p><p>The outer shells grew darker, almost black, accompanied by faint, intermittent cracking sounds. The two shells began to close inward. As they closed, the Swallowing Seas Clam itself gradually became illusory, eventually vanishing altogether.</p><p>Qin Sang witnessed a terrifying scene.</p><p>The illusion they were currently within had no sky or earth.  Countless white wisps drifted through the boundless void, swirling everywhere, omnipresent.</p><p>The surroundings were a blinding white, resembling a scene of heavy snowfall.</p><p>As the Swallowing Seas Clam closed, Qin Sang noticed the surroundings growing even darker, even his escape light seemed suppressed, dimming down.</p><p>At the same time, Qin Sang noticed the white wisps ahead inexplicably compressing into a mass, forming a gigantic white roller, rolling towards him, absorbing all the wisps in its path.</p><p>The wisps were as light as willow catkins, the white roller shouldn’t be heavy, yet it brought forth a sense of infinite oppression.</p><p>When he saw the true source of the anomaly, Qin Sang’s expression changed drastically, his escape light halting abruptly.</p><p>What was pressing down wasn't made of wisps at all, but the void itself!</p><p>The void seemed to be bent by a terrifying force.</p><p>The white roller tumbled down at an alarming speed, its momentum overwhelming.  Qin Sang, positioned before the roller, appeared incredibly small, about to be crushed into paste in the next instant.</p><p>Even more terrifying was the void folding in from the front. No matter how fast he was, there was no path ahead, only futility.</p><p>Unless he retreated.  But Ling Youwang was lurking right behind him!</p><p>In reality, the void hadn't been altered. A Nascent Soul cultivator didn’t possess the power to shake the void.</p><p>With his cultivation, Qin Sang could discern some irregularities, guessing it was likely the power of that clam shell.</p><p>The folding of the void was an illusion, but its power was real, and the danger it posed was no less genuine.</p><p>Even if he saw through the illusion, it would be difficult for Qin Sang to find a weakness in a short time.  His only option now was to overcome force with force!</p><p>*Boom! Boom! Boom!*</p><p>The white roller was upon him.</p><p>Qin Sang felt as if a mountain was pressing down, a sense of suffocation washing over him, the suffocation of being crushed by the void.</p><p>At this moment, the Celestial Eye Butterfly sent another warning.</p><p>From behind.</p><p>After deploying the Swallowing Seas Clam, the black fish Dharma Idol’s tail continued to thrash.  Its large mouth opened, spitting out a ball of white light.</p><p>Within the white light was a jade-white pearl.</p><p>The pearl slowly rotated above the black fish Dharma Idol’s head. A white thread unspooled from it, growing longer and longer as the pearl shrunk, finally becoming a thin white rope several zhang long.</p><p>The rope tautened, emitting a gentle white light, seemingly harmless, but in reality, it was also a spirit treasure.</p><p>The black fish Dharma Idol shook its head, revealing two long barbels around its mouth, as slender as dragon whiskers.</p><p>The barbels flicked out, hooking onto the white rope.</p><p>White light blazed as the rope twisted, merging into the two barbels, which instantly transformed into the same material as the rope.</p><p>*Crash!*</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>The fish’s body twisted, its tail curling upwards, its entire body arching. Simultaneously, the two barbels shot towards its tail.</p><p>The two barbels twisted together, wrapping around the tail.  At the same time, the black fish Dharma Idol's body abruptly unfolded, causing the barbels to instantly tighten.</p><p>*Twang!*</p><p>The sound of a bowstring resonated, lingering in the air.</p><p>The black fish Dharma Idol transformed into a longbow, drawn without a hand, the bowstring pulled taut, aimed directly at Qin Sang, the bow curved like a full moon!</p><p>Blinding white light converged on the bowstring.</p><p>Qin Sang's heart pounded heavily, a stinging sensation spreading through his body, a feeling of inescapable doom.</p><p>Ahead, the void folded; behind, a spirit arrow locked onto him.</p><p>In this desperate situation, Qin Sang flicked his sleeve, a five-colored radiance carrying a crown flying out.</p><p>At this critical juncture, Qin Sang finally dared not hold back any longer.</p><p>The Five Elements Crown hovered before Qin Sang, shimmering with five-colored radiance, magnificent and noble, extraordinarily peculiar.</p><p>Like a living creature, the treasure light pulsed rhythmically, resembling the inhalations and exhalations of a living being.</p><p>“This is…”</p><p>Seeing the Five Elements Crown, a sharp glint flashed in the black fish Dharma Idol’s eyes, instantly recognizing the treasure’s extraordinary nature, a sense of foreboding arising within him.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>Dark waves surged, another giant wave appearing, transforming into mist mid-air, dissipating into nothingness.</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>The white roller slammed into Qin Sang, the entire void seemingly flipping over.</p><p>Qin Sang’s figure remained unmoved. The Five Elements Crown radiated brilliant light, the five-colored radiance intertwining, transforming into a Grand Five Elements Absolute Divine Light.</p><p>Compared to the spectacle created by the Swallowing Seas Clam, this divine light appeared insignificant.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>The Grand Five Elements Absolute Divine Light pierced through the white roller.</p><p>A large section in the middle of the white roller, where the divine light struck, became empty, the white wisps vanishing completely.</p><p>The divine light continued into the void, as if colliding with an invisible wall, producing a deafening roar.</p><p>Qin Sang felt the entire space tremble. Cracks appeared in the void where the divine light struck, filled with five-colored radiance.</p><p>Immediately afterward, the void collapsed at the cracks, forming a large hole. Bright light shone through the opening, revealing the true appearance of the illusion beyond!</p><p>This divine light was the Reverse Five Elements Absolute Divine Light, reversal meaning absolute, achieving success with a single strike!</p><p>Qin Sang’s expression relaxed. He had great confidence in the power of the Five Elements Crown, but the same spirit treasure wielded by different individuals possessed varying power.</p><p>Even an ordinary spirit treasure, when wielded by a Demon King, should not be underestimated.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>In an instant, Qin Sang retrieved the Five Elements Crown, flashing to the edge of the hole.</p><p>Ling Youwang witnessed everything. A rare flicker of annoyance crossed the black fish Dharma Idol’s face.</p><p>If it were a Grand True Lord of the Dao Court, such difficulty wouldn’t be surprising.</p><p>But this child, clearly an unknown figure, possessed a seemingly endless supply of divine abilities and treasures, even the Swallowing Seas Clam couldn’t trap him.</p><p>There was another reason.  Ling Youwang had learned from Marquis Dingxiang that this individual possessed a method to defile spirit treasures.  He didn’t dare let the Swallowing Seas Clam get too close, inevitably impacting its effectiveness.</p><p>Even so, having his attack neutralized in a single strike was still far beyond his expectations.</p><p>His fish eyes stared at the Five Elements Crown, as if trying to discern the treasure's secrets.  Meanwhile, the barbels tightened, the white light elongating, forming a light arrow.</p><p>*Twang!*</p><p>The bowstring thrummed!</p><p>The arrow flew!</p><p>The light arrow was faster than lightning, arriving just as Qin Sang appeared at the opening!</p><p>In a split second, the arrowhead was less than three inches from the back of Qin Sang's neck.</p><p>In imminent peril, Qin Sang didn’t turn his head, nor did he attempt to dodge.</p><p>Dodging now, waiting for the opening to close, he wouldn’t have the power to unleash a second Grand Five Elements Absolute Divine Light.</p><p>His blood and Qi surged within him like thunder. The Bright Mountain Armor shimmered with flowing light, its radiance converging on the back of his neck.</p><p>Ripples spread, the armor plates transforming into a flowing river.</p><p>White light blazed, ripples shimmering on the water’s surface.  The ten-zhang-long light arrow plunged halfway into the river.</p><p>The True Treasure fragment lived up to expectations, remaining unpierced by the light arrow, blocking this fatal blow.</p><p>But in the next moment, Qin Sang suddenly sensed something amiss.  His thoughts raced, and he instantly understood the reason, his heart jolting with surprise.  He immediately urged the Bright Mountain Armor to redistribute the True Treasure fragment’s power, infusing it throughout all the armor plates.</p><p>At the same time, the light arrow exploded, countless sharp fragments engulfing Qin Sang.</p><p>Had he not reacted in time, he would have been sliced to pieces!</p><p>“Truly cunning and treacherous!” Qin Sang snorted coldly. Ling Youwang must have discerned the Bright Mountain Armor's transformation through their previous battles.  Fortunately, his reaction was swift enough.</p><p>*Puff! Puff! Puff!…*</p><p>Fragments of the light arrow covered his entire body, all blocked by the armor plates.</p><p>Although Qin Sang wasn't injured, he felt an immense force slam into his back, as if struck by a mountain. His face paled, feeling his internal organs shift. Thankfully, having cultivated the Vajra Glazed Body, his internal injuries were not severe.</p><p>Borrowing the momentum, he lunged forward, the lightning dimming then brightening again.</p><p>*Splash…*</p><p>The residual wave from the black fish Dharma Idol reached the opening, but it was too late.</p><p>The two barbels detached from the tail.  The Swallowing Seas Clam rose from below, floating amidst the dark waves, slowly opening and closing.</p><p>Gazing at Qin Sang's escaping light, Ling Youwang wore a contemplative expression.</p><p>If Ling Youwang's initial intention was to retrieve the Adamantine Essence, his thoughts had now changed.  He was now more interested in Qin Sang himself.</p><p>Ling Youwang wasn’t unwilling to continue pursuing Qin Sang, but he wasn't as relaxed as he appeared.</p><p>Although he possessed the knowledge of a Demon King, his cultivation had truly fallen to the Profound Enlightenment realm.  Utilizing the power of his Dharma Idol to deploy profound divine abilities, even wielding spirit treasures, came with a considerable cost.</p><p>However, giving up now was absolutely impossible.  A Profound Enlightenment cultivator, possessing so many methods, was quite remarkable. Ling Youwang didn't believe the other party had any treasures stronger than that crown.</p><p>He at least wanted to see what other means the cultivator had before deciding on his next move.</p><p>Furthermore, Ling Youwang judged that wielding that crown wasn’t easy for the other party, otherwise, he wouldn’t have risked taking that arrow.</p><p>Indeed, this was the case.  From his battle with Marquis Dingxiang until now, Qin Sang hadn’t had a single moment to recover.  His cultivation was still at the mid-Nascent Soul stage, his True Essence dwindling. He could only take risks.</p><p>He needed to escape into the Jungle Domain as soon as possible, relying on the Spirit Wood Body to withstand the Demon King, seizing the opportunity to restore his True Essence.</p><p>Ling Youwang didn't withdraw his two spirit treasures.  The dark waves propelled the Swallowing Seas Clam forward.</p><p>It was unknown how many illusions they traversed, how far they flew during their pursuit.</p><p>Finally, a familiar sight came into Qin Sang's view.</p><p>A cerulean canopy stretched out ahead, cerulean winds accumulating into a thick celestial wall, remarkably conspicuous amidst the numerous illusions.</p><p>“Finally!”</p><p>Qin Sang breathed a sigh of relief, unable to resist glancing back, seeing the dark tide surging behind him.</p><p>Without hesitation, Qin Sang plunged directly into the celestial wall.  He immediately felt himself enveloped by abundant and pure wood spirit energy, continuously absorbed by his Spirit Wood Body, rapidly recovering.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>Qin Sang crashed into the jungle, sending countless leaves fluttering down.</p><p>Near the point of impact, some ancient trees swayed rhythmically. More than a dozen banners rose from the canopy, forming a formation in the blink of an eye! (End of Chapter)</p>
