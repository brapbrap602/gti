<h1>Chapter 1754: The Ghost Fang Kingdom</h1><p>‘Bang! Bang!’</p><p>On the banks of an unnamed river, Qin Sang, after confirming the absence of any River Gods or Earth Deities, flung two demons onto the ground.</p><p>The Snake Demon remained unconscious.</p><p>The狽 Demon (Bei Yao) rolled over, its eyes still filled with shock and bewilderment. It waited for a command that never came.  It hadn't anticipated Qin Sang's sudden capture of the Snake Demon, a testament to his unpredictable nature, which further instilled fear in the Bei Yao.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang glanced at the Bei Yao.</p><p>The Bei Yao shuddered, instantly comprehending the unspoken command in Qin Sang's gaze. It conjured a gust of demonic wind, gathering river water and drenching the unconscious Snake Demon.</p><p>The Snake Demon slowly regained consciousness, shaking its head groggily.</p><p>Because the Skyeye Butterfly was inherently fragile, Qin Sang generally shielded it from direct confrontation, rarely giving it opportunities to act independently.</p><p>However, the Skyeye Butterfly had already reached the peak of the late Fourth Transformation, a mere step away from the Fifth Transformation, and its divine abilities possessed considerable power.</p><p>Due to Qin Sang’s instructions to spare the Snake Demon’s life and the Skyeye Butterfly’s concealed ability to devour tribulation lightning, the heavenly lightning that struck the Snake Demon earlier hadn't harnessed the power of tribulation.</p><p>Even so, the Snake Demon nearly perished under the heavenly lightning.</p><p>As its awareness gradually returned, the Snake Demon recalled the previous events.  Looking up and seeing Qin Sang standing on the riverbank, it was instantly terrified. Just as it was about to speak, the perceptive Bei Yao approached and whispered a few words into its ear.</p><p>The Snake Demon's eyes turned crimson with rage after hearing the Bei Yao’s words. It spat at the Bei Yao, its gaze filled with such venom that, were Qin Sang not present, it would have devoured the Bei Yao on the spot!</p><p>The Bei Yao wiped the spittle from its face without retaliating, merely sneering at the Snake Demon.</p><p>As the Snake Demon calmed down, its eyes flickered with uncertainty, finally sighing and choosing submission.  It slithered to Qin Sang's feet, prostrating itself on the ground.  “This humble demon pays respects to the Immortal.  Whatever treasures the Immortal desires, this humble demon will gladly offer with both hands, begging only for the Immortal's mercy and to spare this humble demon's life.”</p><p>Qin Sang withdrew his gaze from the distant horizon, glancing down.  “Reveal your Demonic Essence.”</p><p>“This…”</p><p>The Snake Demon was taken aback. This must be a Daoist True Man. Daoist techniques were unparalleled in the world. Could its meager Demonic Essence truly catch the eye of a True Man, worthy of his attention?</p><p>It subconsciously glanced at the Bei Yao, receiving no cues. Not daring to hesitate further, it took a deep breath, and a spectral image materialized behind it.</p><p>The spectral image was that of a colossal serpent, nearly a hundred zhang long, coiled on the ground like a small mountain.</p><p>The Serpent Specter’s appearance was identical to the Snake Demon’s, its scales the same color, differing only in size.</p><p>Seeing the Serpent Specter, Qin Sang initially mistook it for the Snake Demon's Dharma Idol, but upon closer inspection, he realized it was completely different from his own Azure Phoenix Dharma Idol.</p><p>The Serpent Specter seemed to be condensed from the Snake Demon’s vital essence and blood, its eyes vibrant and lively, not at all stiff, but brimming with life.</p><p>“This is Demonic Essence?”</p><p>Qin Sang examined the Serpent Specter with curious eyes. Indeed, it was vastly different from human cultivation techniques and Dharma Altars.</p><p>The Snake Demon nodded submissively.  “This is the Inner Truth manifested through cultivating my Demonic Essence through Focused Contemplation.”</p><p>Focused Contemplation…</p><p>Qin Sang's heart stirred.</p><p>The method of Focused Contemplation was likely common to both Daoism and demon cultivation, but Daoists manifested Dharma Altar Guardian Deities, while the Snake Demon manifested a Serpent Specter nearly identical to itself, its Qi also identical to the Snake Demon’s.</p><p>External Deities, Inner Truth!</p><p>Could this be the difference between Daoist techniques and Demonic Essence?</p><p>Qin Sang focused his attention, inquiring about the function of Demonic Essence.</p><p>The Snake Demon dared not conceal anything, nor did it need to. The most important function of Demonic Essence was to cultivate Inner Truth, also known as Inner Divinity, to protect one's mind and spirit from the chaotic influences of heaven and earth.</p><p>The biggest difference from Dharma Altars was that Demonic Essence didn't stabilize Vital Qi, and demon cultivators mostly cultivated physical power, for which chaotic Qi was beneficial.</p><p>Physical power was this world's demon cultivators' interpretation of body refinement, a fitting term.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered for a moment, then asked, “Where did you obtain this Demonic Essence cultivation method?”</p><p>“This…”</p><p>The Snake Demon hesitated.  “When this humble demon's spiritual awareness was still dim, I inadvertently stumbled upon a cavern, the secluded abode of a great power from my Serpent Spirit lineage, and within, I obtained a fortuitous encounter…”</p><p>The Snake Demon recounted its past experiences.</p><p>That day, while wandering, it came across a cavern. Drawn by some unknown force, it ventured deep into the cavern and into a grotto.  A beam of spiritual light shot into its brow, instantly awakening its intelligence. Cultivation techniques then appeared in its mind, and it began cultivating in a daze.</p><p>When the Snake Demon broke through to the Transformation stage, it gradually sensed something amiss. The Inner Divinity's protection of its mind seemed to weaken.</p><p>Since it hadn't yet cultivated the inherited techniques to completion, it wasn't certain.  After cultivating for a while longer, it finally confirmed its suspicions.</p><p>Only then did the Snake Demon recall something.  The Serpent Spirit predecessor had also left behind a token in the grotto, stating that if a descendant of the Serpent Spirit lineage reached the Transformation stage, they could take the token to the Ghost Fang Kingdom in the Double Mountain Region to seek it out.</p><p>Since the Snake Demon had been cultivating in seclusion within the cavern, unaware of the outside world, it only learned after venturing out that the Ghost Fang Kingdom was the realm of demons and ghosts, opposing the Dao Court.</p><p>The Double Mountains referred to Mount Ju and Mount Gang.</p><p>Legend had it that the Dao Court originally controlled four regions, but for unknown reasons, it lost the Double Mountain Region, which was seized by demons and ghosts, who established the Ghost Fang Kingdom, rivaling the Dao Court.</p><p>The predecessor hadn't described the Ghost Fang Kingdom in detail, and the Snake Demon dared not provoke the Dao Court's Immortal Officials, so it wasn't clear about the situation in the Double Mountain Region. It was said that the Dao Court and the Ghost Fang Kingdom weren't on good terms, constantly engaging in conflict.</p><p>Hearing this, Qin Sang interrupted the Snake Demon and turned to question the Bei Yao.</p><p>The Bei Yao should know more.</p><p>Having served a Daoist True Man, although it hadn't been privy to true secrets, it had heard some things.</p><p>The Dao Court also referred to two Double Mountains, Central Lush Region, White Stone Region, as well as Mount Ju and Mount Gang.</p><p>Central Lush Region and White Stone Region were governed by the Heavenly Hub Institute and the Northern Pole Exorcism Institute, respectively.</p><p>The region truly occupied by the Ghost Fang Kingdom was Mount Gang, while Mount Ju, located between the Dao Court and the Ghost Fang Kingdom, was the most chaotic, a constant battleground between the two sides.</p><p>When the Bei Yao was subdued by its former master, its former master had recently returned from Mount Ju.</p><p>The soldiers under the Bei Yao’s former master often boasted of their military exploits on the battlefield, leading the Bei Yao to regard them as demon collaborators, filled with disdain.</p><p>The constant fighting between the Dao Court and the Ghost Fang Kingdom suggested that the legends held some truth.</p><p>Reaching the Ghost Fang Kingdom wouldn't be easy.</p><p>The Snake Demon certainly wouldn't dare traverse the Dao Court's territory.  Circumventing it through the edges was also unsafe. Daoist cultivators referred to the wildlands beyond the Dao Court as the Demonic Wasteland and the Demonic Sea.</p><p>Having cultivated here, the Snake Demon knew that the Demonic Wasteland and the Demonic Sea were fraught with peril. It might lose its life before even finding the Ghost Fang Kingdom.</p><p>It had cultivated for many years, devoting all its spare time to refining the nine shed snake skins. Its other abilities were mediocre, and its meticulously refined snake skins hadn't helped it escape danger, leading to its capture by Qin Sang.</p><p>Having learned the full story, Qin Sang instructed the Snake Demon to lead him to the cavern grotto.</p><p>The man and the two demons retraced their steps.</p><p>The cavern was located amidst the Snake Demon’s nine cave dwellings. After the inheritance was taken by the Snake Demon, there was nothing special about this place, so the Skyeye Butterfly hadn't paid particular attention to it.</p><p>‘Drip… Drip…’</p><p>The grotto was silent, the dripping water clearly audible.</p><p>The Snake Demon shrunk its size, transforming into a seven-foot-long thin-scaled brocade snake, slithering across the ground, past thick stone pillars, and then diving into an underground river. After a short while, it found the entrance to the grotto.</p><p>The Snake Demon turned its head.  “Immortal, this is the place.”</p><p>Qin Sang stepped forward, finding the grotto extremely narrow.  In the center was a circular stone pool filled with crystal-clear water. Beside the pool sat a smooth black stone, the only furnishing in the grotto.</p><p>Qin Sang released his divine sense and had the Skyeye Butterfly investigate, finding no hidden restrictions.</p><p>The Snake Demon had lost count of how many times it had searched this place, worried that the Serpent Spirit predecessor might return, and thus remained nearby to cultivate.</p><p>“You plotted against the Dao Court Branch Master because you suspected a connection between Dharma Altars and Demonic Essence?”</p><p>Qin Sang looked directly into the Snake Demon’s eyes, suddenly asking.</p><p>The Snake Demon shuddered, terrified, and艰难ly nodded.</p><p>The path to the Ghost Fang Kingdom was blocked. After careful consideration, the Snake Demon decided to wait until its cultivation was higher before setting off, hoping for a safer journey.</p><p>At the same time, the Snake Demon was actively seeking ways to resolve its own predicament.  Noticing the Dharma Altars cultivated by Daoist cultivators, it felt that the two were quite similar and might offer insights to solve its hidden troubles.</p><p>It had once secretly captured a few low-level cultivators, but gained little.</p><p>Even without personal experience, based solely on the two demons' descriptions of Dharma Altars and Demonic Essence, Qin Sang felt there must be a connection between the two, perhaps diverging due to differences in cultivation methods, resulting in different manifestations.</p><p>After pondering for a while, Qin Sang summoned the Bei Yao and ordered the Snake Demon to impart its Demonic Essence cultivation method to it, wanting to personally observe the process.</p><p>The Bei Yao was overjoyed.</p><p>Although it would once again be under someone else's control, at least it could continue cultivating.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the Snake Demon sighed, avoiding the Bei Yao’s gaze, and shook its head.  “This humble demon doesn't know how to impart the cultivation method to others. When this humble demon awakened, it cultivated instinctively…”</p><p>Before Qin Sang could react, the Bei Yao was already wide-eyed, gnashing its teeth at the Snake Demon, but dared not act out in Qin Sang’s presence.</p><p>Qin Sang waved his hand, dismissing the two demons, and sat down on the black stone to meditate.</p><p>Having captured the two demons, he had gained a certain understanding of both Daoist and demon cultivation methods.</p><p>Whether in the Dao Court or the Ghost Fang Kingdom, the methods of transmitting cultivation techniques seemed to be controlled by major powers.</p><p>This indicated an unimaginable level of internal control within these factions, and the high-level cultivators held immense power over the lower-level ones.</p><p>In the Storm Realm, even if one offended a major sect, they could still become a rogue cultivator, hiding in remote areas and cultivating in seclusion.  But in this world, offending the Dao Court would make life impossible.</p><p>That Serpent Spirit predecessor originated from the Ghost Fang Kingdom. The Demonic Essence cultivation method it passed on to the Snake Demon should be orthodox demon cultivation. Since Demonic Essence didn't have the ability to stabilize Vital Qi, it meant that using chaotic Qi to temper the body likely had no adverse effects.</p><p>Thus, he could confidently cultivate the *Heavenly Demon Body Refinement* technique, continuing to temper his physical body and seek breakthroughs.</p><p>But this wasn't a long-term solution, and he would eventually have to return to the path of spiritual cultivation.</p><p>“Mount Ju…”</p><p>Qin Sang slightly raised his head, gazing eastward, his expression thoughtful.</p><p>Finding a way to break through within the Dao Court would be difficult, but the more chaotic a place, the easier it would be to act!</p><p>The clash between the two major forces, the Ghost Fang Kingdom and the Dao Court, as well as the collision between Demonic Essence and Dharma Altars, also intrigued Qin Sang.</p><p>With this in mind, Qin Sang had a clear plan for his next move. There was no need to rush into contact with the Dao Court. He could first travel east to Mount Ju!</p><p>However, there was one point he had to consider.</p><p>The Dao Court and the Ghost Fang Kingdom had been at war for many years, and it wasn't just a conflict of ideologies. There were likely cultivators above the Nascent Soul stage present on the battlefield.  Although his current strength was considerable, it might not be enough to guarantee his safety.</p><p>Each major breakthrough in the *Heavenly Demon Body Refinement* technique required absorbing stellar essence. Chaotic Qi and the Dragon Transformation Pool’s spiritual liquid alone weren't sufficient, and he hadn't found a solution for this yet.</p><p>However, before that, he could first open the spiritual apertures of the Dao Manifestation Tree, integrate it into his body, and refine a Spiritual Wood Body.</p><p>With a plan in mind, Qin Sang left the grotto and returned to the cavern, only to discover the two demons brawling.</p><p>The Bei Yao was biting the Snake Demon’s vital point, while the Snake Demon was tightly constricting the Bei Yao’s neck. Both were covered in mud, looking utterly disheveled.</p><p>Afraid of disturbing Qin Sang, the two former Demon Kings had reverted to their bestial nature, carefully fighting, not even breaking a single stone pillar.</p><p>The Snake Demon was forced to dissipate several demonic glows, greatly weakening its cultivation, yet it managed to fight the Bei Yao to a standstill.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang approach, the two demons froze, ceasing their fight, and respectfully stood at Qin Sang's sides.</p><p>Qin Sang made no comment on their behavior.  “This poor Daoist intends to travel to Mount Ju soon.  Are you willing to accompany me?”</p><p>The two demons nodded simultaneously.</p><p>They knew that refusing would be a death sentence.</p><p>Qin Sang saw through their thoughts and smiled faintly.  “This poor Daoist isn't a cruel person, nor do I desire to command an army. If you follow my orders diligently, returning your freedom is not a difficult matter.  You can then directly join the Ghost Fang Kingdom, and this poor Daoist will not interfere. If you make significant contributions, this poor Daoist will have further rewards.”</p><p>The two demons exchanged glances, greatly tempted.</p><p>They didn't dare hope for any great rewards, but the chance to join the Ghost Fang Kingdom was extremely appealing.</p><p>As for whether Qin Sang would keep his promise, they couldn't be sure, but their situation couldn't get any worse.</p><p>“We are willing to follow the Immortal!”</p><p>The two demons bowed in unison, their voices carrying more sincerity.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded inwardly.  Mount Ju was the battlefield of two major forces, and the two demons might become valuable assets.</p><p>Soon, the man and the two demons arrived at the most superior of the Snake Demon’s nine cave dwellings.</p><p>“Guard this place.”</p><p>Qin Sang left a single instruction and entered the dwelling to cultivate.</p><p>The snake and the狽 stood guard on either side of the cave dwelling, exchanging glances, their anger flaring up again.</p><p>…</p><p>Two years later.</p><p>The cave dwelling opened from within, and Qin Sang stepped out with a smile.</p><p>Although he knew that using the Dao Manifestation Tree as a spiritual medium to cultivate the *Postnatal Wooden Figure Stele* would be easier, he hadn't expected to open all the spiritual apertures and integrate them into his body in just two years.</p><p>Back then, the Strange-Faced Man had spent over twenty years opening the spiritual apertures on the Scarlet Profound Ancient Tree.</p><p>And the Strange-Faced Man had spent a long time tempering his own apertures beforehand.</p><p>The more thorough the preparation, the greater the chance of success.  Even so, integrating the Scarlet Profound Ancient Tree into his body was extremely difficult and nearly failed.</p><p>Qin Sang, however, had only begun tempering his apertures two years ago.  He had just made a casual attempt and, as if it were the most natural thing, effortlessly integrated them into his body.</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't anticipated such ease and was quite surprised. This was naturally due to the Dao Manifestation Tree, saving him a considerable amount of time.</p><p>Completing this step was equivalent to initially refining a Spiritual Wood Body.  However, to use it in combat, he still needed to nurture it within his body for some time.</p><p>As his cultivation increased, it would gradually reveal more miraculous properties.</p><p>Looking around, seeing the two demons diligently guarding the place for two years, still in a weakened state, he dismissed the idea of using them for practice.</p><p>Qin Sang pointed eastward.  “Let’s go!”</p><p>(End of Chapter)</p>
