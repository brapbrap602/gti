<h1>Chapter 2151: The Yuanjiao Fair</h1><p>Qin Sang examined the message, then flicked his finger, sending a stream of light towards a cave in the back mountain.</p><p>Moments later, Su Nu gracefully arrived, surprised: "The Sacred Ground is about to open?"</p><p>Qin Sang handed the message to Su Nu, "The Zhu Yan tribe just sent word. The Yi Ren have discovered several clear signs. The next ebb of the foul air will be a massive one!"</p><p>"So soon!"</p><p>Su Nu's beautiful eyes flickered. She knew Qin Sang was going to the Sacred Ground, and that she would be looking after Qingyang Temple in his absence.</p><p>"How are your preparations, Brother Qin?"</p><p>"Fortunately, I haven't slacked off. I've refined the Kuntian Golden Lock," Qin Sang said. "Many powerful Yi Ren will gather at the Yuanjiao Fair. It's also a good opportunity to exchange knowledge and resources. If you need any cultivation materials, you might find them there."</p><p>"Good. As long as it doesn't interfere with Brother Qin's important matters, just let your younger sister know before you leave. I'd like to broaden my horizons!"</p><p>Su Nu seized the opportunity to discuss Dao with Qin Sang before returning to her seclusion.</p><p>…</p><p>Eighteen years later, over a century had passed since the great war.</p><p>Spring was warm and sunny.</p><p>The grass grew long, and orioles sang.</p><p>A white cloud floated above Qingyang Temple. Yu Nu and Li Yu stood on the cloud, their expressions respectful, as if waiting for someone.</p><p>A figure suddenly appeared before them – Qin Sang. They immediately bowed.</p><p>"Reporting to Master Uncle, the evil river began to recede this morning," Li Yu reported.</p><p>"What does the great tide look like?" Qin Sang asked.</p><p>"Cang Lang sent a message saying the great tide has just begun. The foul air seems to be drawn in by a powerful force, instantly exposing the source of the Qingling energy. Even the previous ebb tide didn't reach this far!"</p><p>Li Yu exclaimed in amazement.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded slightly. With the ebb tide beginning, it was time for them to leave.</p><p>The Yuanjiao Fair was about to open. Although younger disciples were permitted, since it was in Yi Ren territory, Qin Sang decided to only bring Li Yu and Yu Nu.</p><p>He turned towards the back mountain of the main peak. A scarlet light, the Vermilion Bird, flew out a moment later.  Su Nu also emerged from her cave and quietly joined them on the cloud.</p><p>With everyone assembled, the white cloud drifted out of the temple gates and vanished into the sky in an instant.</p><p>They traveled swiftly and continuously, reaching the Zhu Yan tribe. Instead of directly visiting the Yuan Xiang clan leader, they first sought out Yuan Miao, with whom they were most familiar.</p><p>Upon seeing Yuan Miao's beaming expression, Qin Sang had a hunch, "Friend Daoist, you also received permission to enter the Sacred Ground?"</p><p>Yuan Miao laughed heartily, "Thanks to several sparring sessions with True Person Qin. By pointing out my flaws, my strength increased significantly. I soundly defeated those old fellows, and the clan leader chose me."</p><p>Qin Sang was also delighted. Having a familiar face in the Sacred Ground was always beneficial, even if they might not meet.</p><p>After some pleasantries, Qin Sang and the others stayed at Yuan Miao's cave, awaiting the Zhu Yan tribe to activate the teleportation array.</p><p>Three days later, at dawn, Yuan Miao received a message. They immediately set off for the Zhu Yan tribe's teleportation hall. As they approached the hall, Qin Sang saw the Yuan Xiang clan leader standing before it, surrounded by a dozen figures.</p><p>These individuals, some leaning against pillars with their arms crossed, others casually seated in meditation, were all Zhu Yan elite, each with powerful physiques and robust vital energy, their sharp gazes imbued with a fierce aura—clearly seasoned top-tier experts.</p><p>Nearly all were in meditation, maximizing their cultivation time.</p><p>Upon noticing Qin Sang and his companions, they all looked up. Their gaze carried an immense pressure.  Those with weaker wills might be intimidated into collapse.</p><p>The smile faded from Su Nu's face.</p><p>Qin Sang swiftly intervened, protecting Li Yu and Yu Nu, his expression unchanged as he followed Yuan Miao to the front of the hall.</p><p>Most of the Zhu Yan experts were focused on cultivation and paid no attention to outsiders. Some simply resumed their meditation; others noticed that Qin Sang and his group were outsiders, but merely glanced at them before falling silent. An oppressive quiet filled the hall.</p><p>"Greetings, Clan Leader Yuan Xiang," Qin Sang bowed, his gaze sweeping over the assembled warriors. He had expected at least dozens of Nascent Soul experts, but there were only a few.</p><p>The Yuanjiao Fair didn't restrict numbers; any Nascent Soul cultivator could attend. Surely the Zhu Yan tribe had more than these few. Moreover, among those present, only the Yuan Xiang clan leader was a late-stage expert.  The Zhu Yan's top combat power shouldn't be inferior to the Si You tribe.</p><p>Clan Leader Yuan Xiang perceived Qin Sang's confusion. "Others are still in seclusion. They will bring their juniors later."</p><p>The stronger members of the various powerful clans would depart in a few days.  The opening of the Yuanqiao City was initially chaotic, not an ideal time to travel. We have a special mission.”</p><p>It turned out that Yuanqiao City was located deep within the Vile River, only surfacing when the foul miasma receded.</p><p>During this period, Yuanqiao City was isolated, perpetually tainted by the miasma. The protective array was in disarray from the constant assault, the city appearing dilapidated.  Therefore, the leading clans needed to arrive first, to repair the array and restore the city.</p><p>Before the Yuanxiang clan leader finished speaking, a white streak of light shot across the sky, carrying nearly ten figures within its glow.</p><p>“Friends from the Youyao clan have arrived,” the Yuanxiang clan leader chuckled.</p><p>Qin Sang looked over.  The group was led by a man in white robes.  Their features bore a resemblance to the Zhuyan clan, with silvery hair. Their demeanor was gentle and approachable, unlike the sharp, aggressive nature of the Zhuyan.</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't directly interacted with the Youyao clan before, but he had heard countless tales of them.</p><p>In the eyes of the powerful clans, the Youyao clan's status and reputation were almost equal to the Zhuyan, sometimes even considered another leading clan. However, feelings towards the Youyao were complex.</p><p>On one hand, they were more approachable and easier to negotiate with than the Zhuyan.  Requests for assistance were generally met with a response. On the other hand, offending them carried far worse consequences than offending the Zhuyan.</p><p>The Zhuyan were straightforward, unlikely to implicate the innocent.  A fight might settle the matter.  But offending the Youyao could result in death without even knowing how it happened, potentially even harming your entire clan.</p><p>The existence of Qingyang Manor had been tacitly approved by the Yuanxiang clan leader, but prolonged interactions with other clans were inevitable.  For Qingyang Manor's sake, Qin Sang didn't want to offend powerful enemies like the Youyao.  He stood behind the Yuanxiang clan leader, smiling in greeting.</p><p>The Youyao experts noticed Qin Sang; several looked at him, including the man in white.</p><p>Qin Sang sensed something unusual in their gazes, a flash of golden light in their eyes, reminiscent of the feeling of being observed during his first battle with Yuan Miao – there might have been a Youyao expert nearby then.</p><p>“That Yuan brother is the Youyao clan's Grand Elder, only three hundred years older than me,” Yuan Miao secretly transmitted, his tone filled with admiration and respect.</p><p>The Zhuyan clan admired strength, not envying it.</p><p>Qin Sang covertly studied the man in white. Yuan Miao was a genius within the Zhuyan, and this individual, only three hundred years older, was considered from the same generation.  To become a top-tier expert comparable to a late-stage cultivator, and hold such a high position, he was undoubtedly a genius among geniuses.</p><p>“Yuan Jian greets the Yuanxiang clan leader,” the man in white said upon reaching the hall, bowing first.  His gaze then shifted to Qin Sang.</p><p>“Both of you are young talents.  Realist Qin likely doesn't know Elder Yuan. I'll introduce you…”</p><p>The Yuanxiang clan leader chuckled, pulling Qin Sang forward.</p><p>Yuan Jian smiled and bowed, “Realist Qin, while you may not know me, I've heard countless tales of your feats. I've long admired your name!”</p><p>Qin Sang returned the bow, humbly expressing his unworthiness.  Then, he heard a faint whisper, like a murmur, "Be wary of this one after entering the Sacred Land…"</p><p>The voice was nearly imperceptible, unheard by anyone else.</p><p>Qin Sang felt a chill. He recognized the voice as the Yuanxiang clan leader.</p><p>He recalled Min Zhuo’s mention of someone behind the scenes.  The Yuanxiang clan leader's warning... did he suspect Yuan Jian?</p><p>It seemed the relationship between the Zhuyan and Youyao clans wasn't as harmonious as it appeared.</p><p>Qin Sang's doubts intensified. Why would the Youyao Grand Elder make such preparations against him?</p><p>Unfortunately, the Yuanxiang clan leader offered no further explanation, seemingly unwilling to elaborate.</p><p>Perhaps the Yuanxiang clan leader lacked conclusive evidence, or maybe he didn’t want outsiders to know about the rift between the clans, Qin Sang mused.</p><p>Dismissing these thoughts, Qin Sang maintained a calm demeanor. Yuan Jian showed no signs of abnormality either.  They appeared to get along exceptionally well.  Other Youyao experts approached and chatted with Su Nu, creating an atmosphere of harmony.</p><p>Shortly after Yuan Jian's arrival, several more figures arrived, all powerful clan members, some bringing their juniors, planning to head to Yuanqiao City early.</p><p>The Yuanxiang clan leader occasionally looked to the sky, mentally calculating the time.  When the sun was high, he declared, “The time has come. The city should have appeared. Let us depart!”</p><p>With a sweep of his sleeve, the Yuanxiang clan leader opened the teleportation hall, and everyone entered.</p><p>The teleportation array activated, bathing everyone in light.</p><p>Qin Sang used his cultivation to shield Li Yu Fu and Yu Nu from the effects of teleportation.  Then, a crushing force hit them, followed by a dizzying sensation before they landed on solid ground.</p><p>Vision returned, revealing the scene before them, leaving everyone speechless.</p><p>They found themselves in a large, empty ancient hall. The hall doors were shut tight, and an eerie silence filled the air, concealing what lay beyond.  In the darkness, more than a dozen eyeballs floated in mid-air, scattered yet arranged with a certain order.</p><p>These eyeballs were round and full, existing without bodies, pale and bloodless, their edges devoid of flesh; only the central part, less than ten percent, was pitch-black, with pupils as fine as needles.</p><p>Upon Qin Sang and the others' arrival, the eyeballs all seemed to "look" at them, revealing strange and unmistakably living gazes.</p><p>This scene was so bizarre that Li Yu Fu and Yu Nu felt a shiver down their spines.</p><p>The next moment, the eyeballs flickered. Faint spiritual light appeared around them, gradually forming humanoid silhouettes, complete with heads and limbs, though their appearances were extremely grotesque.</p><p>The foremost eyeball transformed into a hazy figure, floating forward. It bowed to the Yuanxiang clan leader with a gentle, refined female voice that sounded somewhat ethereal.</p><p>"Wei Yin greets the Yuanxiang clan leader."</p><p>The Yuanxiang clan leader, setting aside his casual demeanor, returned the bow solemnly. "It has been many years, Clan Leader Wei Yin. I trust you are well."</p><p>"They are from the Yimu clan..."</p><p>Hearing Yuan Miao's telepathic message, Qin Sang recalled the records concerning this tribe.</p><p>The Yimu were also one of the upper clans of the Tianbu.  As their name suggests, they are characterized by a single eye located in the center of their face. Their facial features differ significantly from humans, but their bodies and limbs are similar.</p><p>Their most unique aspect is their abilities and cultivation methods. Unlike the Zhuyan clan, who focus on physical cultivation, the Yimu cultivate their spiritual essence, making them spiritual cultivators among the heterogenous races.</p><p>During this cultivation process, the Yimu's physical bodies gradually degenerate, becoming pure energy which is absorbed by their eye. The disappearance of these individuals' physical forms, leaving only an eyeball, indicates they had reached exceptionally high realms of cultivation.</p><p>Conversely, their spiritual essence grows stronger, referred to by the Yimu as a spirit body.  If they choose not to manifest their spirit body, only an eyeball is visible to outsiders. Among humans, a spirit body of a Nascent Soul cultivator is called a Yangshen. Qin Sang had the fortunate experience of meeting one.</p><p>Traveling across several major states in Dazhou, Qin Sang observed that spiritual cultivators were rarer than physical cultivators. This path is not prevalent among humans, but among heterogenous races, tribes similar to the Yimu are numerous, spiritual cultivation is not uncommon, and their abilities are often unpredictable and dangerous.</p><p>The one who had greeted them was Wei Yin, the Yimu clan leader.</p><p>Wei Yin was known for her gentle nature and, judging by her voice, was a woman. The Yimu had a distinction between genders before shedding their physical bodies.</p><p>She exchanged greetings with Yuan Jian and Qin Sang, and while conversing with the Yuanxiang clan leader about the Yuanjiao Sea Market, she floated towards the hall doors.  Reaching the door, she raised a seal and pressed it against the surface.</p><p>'Hum!'</p><p>A幽蓝灵光亮起, the rust on the hall door peeled away, revealing two jade doors of a vibrant jade green.</p><p>Qin Sang sensed the activation of a formation barrier by the seal, and then heard creaking sounds as the doors slowly opened.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>A strong wind rushed into the hall through the opening, revealing the scene outside.</p><p>The ancient hall they stood in was built upon a floating island. The island was not large; ten meters beyond the hall was a cliff, and below lay the sea, its water a deep black, with enormous, raging waves.</p><p>Beyond the island, countless dark shadows floated in the void – more floating islands, stretching to the horizon, innumerable.</p><p>These islands varied in size and height, all desolate and devoid of life.  It was evident that there had once been structures on them, but most were now ruins, a scene of utter desolation. Upon leaving the hall, they found that while the hall itself remained intact, it was also aged and worn, bearing the marks of long-standing decay.</p><p>Despite the decay, the islands remained, connected by a persistent formation barrier that protected this place.</p><p>Their gaze swept across the islands, and they saw a vast, dark curtain blotting out the sky.</p><p>Some islands were even hidden behind this curtain.</p><p>This was the foul energy, forming a black tide, overwhelming and terrifying; each crashing wave was like a cataclysmic event, shaking the islands violently, and the formation seemed on the verge of collapse – far more violent and terrifying than the scene Qin Sang had witnessed at the edge of the Nie River.</p><p>At that moment, they saw lights flashing on distant islands, indicating the arrival of other tribes.</p>
