<h1>Chapter 541: Condensing Essence, Dispelling Clouds to See the Sun!</h1><p>Chapter 541: Condensing Essence, Dispelling Clouds to See the Sun!</p><p>The Sky-Flying Rakshasa's power is merely pseudo-Golden Core.</p><p>But at least it wasn't the worst outcome. Even possessing comparable strength to the Sky-Flying Rakshasa far surpasses other cultivators at the Fake Golden Core stage, greatly benefiting my search for a Golden Core formation material.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't hesitate long before making up his mind.</p><p>He retracted the ebony sword into his primordial spirit, his mind connecting with the killing runes on the sword; the familiar feeling returned.</p><p>Qin Sang was about to start cultivating and absorbing spiritual energy when he suddenly had a thought. He tried using his cultivation technique to activate the true essence in his dantian, but discovered a complete incompatibility between the two.</p><p>The "Primordial Spirit Nurturing Sword Chapter" can only be cultivated using the spiritual energy of heaven and earth.</p><p>The true essence itself remained unaffected.</p><p>If the "Primordial Spirit Nurturing Sword Chapter" could utilize true essence to cultivate, I might be able to seize control of the corpse pill and refine it into my Golden Core, thus undergoing a transformation.</p><p>His intentions were ruthlessly crushed by reality.</p><p>"Too much wishful thinking!"</p><p>Qin Sang chuckled self-deprecatingly, "From now on, I'll just use this corpse pill as an external pill."</p><p>Absorbing spiritual energy from heaven and earth is too slow, and this isn't a place rich in spiritual energy.</p><p>Delay breeds danger.</p><p>Qin Sang quickly set up a simple spirit gathering array around him, then held a medium-grade spirit stone in each hand, rapidly absorbing spiritual energy into his body.</p><p>At this time, his spiritual energy had been completely depleted during the Violent Qi rushing towards the Golden Core. After forming the corpse pill, he could only use true essence; his dantian was essentially devoid of spiritual energy, completely drained.</p><p>Abundant spiritual energy poured into his meridians, following familiar pathways. After circulating a full cycle, it gathered in his dantian.</p><p>"Huh?"</p><p>Qin Sang was surprised to find that his dantian wasn't entirely devoid of spiritual energy.</p><p>The moment the new spiritual energy entered his dantian, amidst the turbulent true essence, a trace of extremely minute, almost imperceptible spiritual energy quietly emerged, swimming out from within.</p><p>It was so tiny, hidden within the true essence, that he hadn't noticed it before.</p><p>Even now that it had appeared, it seemed nonexistent, almost impossible to sense.</p><p>Strangely, Qin Sang felt an extreme sense of hunger from this wisp of spiritual energy, an unprecedented experience.</p><p>Like a starving and thirsty beast, emaciated and bony, finally encountering water and food, it was incredibly urgent and joyful, gulping it down in large mouthfuls.</p><p>Under Qin Sang's astonished gaze, this wisp of spiritual energy devoured the new spiritual energy.</p><p>Compared to the newly arrived spiritual energy, this wisp was insignificant; the two were not on the same scale. Yet, Qin Sang felt that the new spiritual energy was being 'consumed.'</p><p>The scene of a snake swallowing a whale appeared vividly before Qin Sang's eyes.</p><p>Qin Sang continuously absorbed spiritual energy from the two medium-grade spirit stones. This spiritual energy flowed into his dantian and was completely devoured by that wisp of spiritual energy.</p><p>Similar to a seed, it sprouted and grew after receiving nutrients.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't stop it, patiently waiting until it gradually grew larger and became clearly perceptible.</p><p>When he tried to activate this wisp of spiritual energy…</p><p>Silence filled the cave.</p><p>The next moment, Qin Sang suddenly stood up from the ground, his eyes wide, staring fixedly at his dantian. He seemed to have seen something incredibly unimaginable, shocking him beyond belief.</p><p>After a moment of stunned silence, Qin Sang suppressed his excitement, took a deep breath, quickly sat cross-legged, and carefully sensed this wisp of spiritual energy again.</p><p>It lacked the previous feeling of elusiveness.</p><p>Incredibly heavy!</p><p>Incredibly dense!</p><p>Exceptionally thick, like mercury!</p><p>No wonder it had devoured so much external spiritual energy to grow to this size.</p><p>Qin Sang could hardly believe it, confirming it countless times before daring to believe that his spiritual energy had truly changed like this!</p><p>If he remembered correctly, the experiences and records left by the predecessors on the Baofeng Peak of Mount Shaohua indicated that this situation was a sign of imminent Golden Core formation!</p><p>Moreover, their spiritual energy hadn't reached this level of density before they successfully formed their Golden Cores.</p><p>According to their descriptions, most people hadn't even reached half this level, yet their success rate was still high. Those with even denser spiritual energy than his could still successfully form Golden Cores with stability!</p><p>Why did this happen? What caused his spiritual energy to change?</p><p>Amidst his elation, Qin Sang couldn't help but ponder the cause.</p><p>Qin Sang was certain that before infiltrating the Qingyang Demon Sect, there were no signs, because his dantian still contained spiritual energy then, evenly distributed with the earth-sha spirit energy.</p><p>There's only one possibility, the Violent Qi rushing towards the Golden Core!</p><p>Qin Sang carefully recalled that on Divine Firmament Peak, in order to prevent the earth-sha and heaven-dry violent qi from colliding prematurely, allowing them to impact the Golden Core simultaneously, he had no choice but to wrap them in spiritual energy.</p><p>During this process, his spiritual energy continuously endured the impact and tempering of both.</p><p>At that time, Qin Sang was solely focused on ensuring the success of the Gangsha Pill refinement, leaving no time to notice any changes in her spiritual power.  What little remained after its depletion was so insignificant she couldn't detect it.</p><p>Later, her Qi Sea was overtaken by the true energy of the Corpse Pill, suppressing that tiny sliver of spiritual power, preventing it from surfacing.</p><p>"Yin and Yang... Yin and Yang..."</p><p>A thought struck Qin Sang like lightning.</p><p>That's it!</p><p>The Kanli Golden Core, named for Kan and Li, while a single pill, contains the effects of both Yin and Yang energies.</p><p>The Iris flower and the Snow Spirit Lotus are prime examples of Yin and Yang herbs, growing together, one thriving in ice and snow, the other in magma – their environmental requirements are extremely demanding.</p><p>To Qin Sang's knowledge, all other spiritual objects, including the Xuanzhen Pill and others, possess both Yin and Yang energies.</p><p>As the saying goes, Yin cannot exist alone, nor can Yang.</p><p>The path to Golden Core refinement mirrors the harmony of Yin and Yang.</p><p>Earthly Demonic Qi is the ultimate Yin energy in the world, while Heavenly Gang Qi is the ultimate Yang energy. Opposing yet complementary, they represent the ultimate Yin and Yang forces!</p><p>Could they aid in Golden Core formation?</p><p>Condensing Demonic Qi and refining Gang Qi!</p><p>Wu Shang's brilliant idea—it actually applies here!</p><p>Qin Sang didn't know if anyone in the ancient cultivation world had discovered that condensing Demonic Qi and refining Gang Qi could aid in Golden Core formation.  She had read too few ancient texts, and most were incomplete.</p><p>At least in the more recent records she’d seen, and among the many cultivators she’d encountered in the Turbulent Islands, no one knew about this.</p><p>The reason is not hard to imagine.</p><p>Firstly, these two rare items are extremely difficult to obtain.</p><p>Earthly Demonic Qi, at least, is on the ground; with patience and searching, it can be found and obtained.</p><p>Heavenly Gang Qi, however, resides in the highest heavens, beyond the belt of gale winds that even Nascent Soul masters dare not cross.  How could cultivators at the False Core stage ever hope to ascend and obtain it?</p><p>They can only wait for Gang Qi to fall from the heavens, transforming into Gang Essence.</p><p>Yet, throughout the Xiaohan Region, in its vast expanse, only two places possess Gang Jade: one in the cave abode of Xiaohan Region's most powerful cultivator, and the other occupied by an ancient and powerful demonic sect.</p><p>Forget attempting it; they don't even have access to Heavenly Gang Qi.</p>
