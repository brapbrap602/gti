<h1>Chapter 2103: Crimson Ceremony</h1><p>With the Three Great Sects exposed for their deeds under the watchful eyes of all, their reputations plummeted, and the dissolution of the Tri-Sect Alliance became a foregone conclusion.</p><p>Even if the Eight Sceneries Sect and the Sweet Dew Zen Monastery wouldn't completely collapse from this, it would be difficult for them to recover their vitality.</p><p>This wasn't the Lower Realm anymore, where occupying the resources of an Immortal Palace could ensure everlasting prosperity and an unshakeable foundation.</p><p>Every sect and every clan had to heed Qin Sang's will. Unless Qin Sang changed his opinion of them, they would remain suppressed, allowing other sects to rise in their place.  With this ebb and flow, the Eight Sceneries Sect and the Sweet Dew Zen Monastery would only gradually decline.</p><p>It remained to be seen whether the Sky Hao Tower could weather this storm.</p><p>Everyone looked at Old Devil Ku Rong.</p><p>Old Devil Ku Rong possessed remarkable fortitude.  Facing Old Devil Fan's accusations, he remained composed. "The position of Sect Master belongs to the most capable. I never used any insidious methods to suppress the Grand Elder. This was normal internal competition within the sect. Grand Elder, do not let the resentment in your heart blind you and slander me. Dragging me down with you will not benefit the Fan family or the sect in the slightest. It will only bring pain to those close to you and joy to your enemies!"</p><p>Then, Old Devil Ku Rong cupped his hands towards Qin Sang. "Great True One, if I may explain, long before the North Sea ambush, this junior and the two Sect Masters entered seclusion to refine a treasure to counter the might of the Chang You Clan's Patriarch.  After over a decade in seclusion, we have made remarkable progress through deep thought and meditation. The treasure is nearing completion and only needs a period of refinement to reach its full potential. This is the treasure; the two Sect Masters can testify…"</p><p>As he spoke, he opened his palm, revealing a small golden seal. The seal was unadorned, its surface covered with golden lines that constantly twisted and writhed, as if true golden characters might eventually emerge.</p><p>Everyone silently praised Old Devil Ku Rong's cunning, worthy of a great Devil Dao figure. He had planned for failure even before victory.  His words effectively framed Old Devil Fan's accusations as revenge.  His subsequent mention of the Fan family seemed both a threat and a promise: as long as Old Devil Fan took the blame, he would protect the Fan family.</p><p>In front of Qin Sang, it was impossible to openly promise Old Devil Fan anything.  This was the limit of what Old Devil Ku Rong could do.</p><p>Old Devil Fan, however, seemed not to understand, or perhaps he no longer cared. He let out a chilling, strange laugh.  "You are the Sky Hao Tower's Sect Master. Without your scheming behind the scenes, how could the Tri-Sect Alliance have followed my instructions?  Whether he knew or not, just ask that surnamed Hong, and everything will be clear!"</p><p>The latter half of his sentence was directed at Qin Sang.</p><p>Old Devil Fan had clearly abandoned all hope, filled with hatred for Old Devil Ku Rong. "My current predicament is all thanks to you!  You dream of escaping?  The road to the Yellow Springs is less lonely with company, haha…"</p><p>"You…"</p><p>Looking at the near-frenzied, irrational Old Devil Fan, Old Devil Ku Rong felt utterly troubled.</p><p>The following response from the Hong surnamed cultivator sealed Old Devil Ku Rong's fate.</p><p>It turned out that after forming an alliance with the Flood Dragon King, Cultivator Hong had reported the matter to Old Devil Ku Rong. However, Old Devil Ku Rong hadn't expressed his stance at the time. It was only some time later that Old Devil Fan approached him.  It was clear that Old Devil Fan had acted on Old Devil Ku Rong's instructions.</p><p>At this point, Old Devil Ku Rong could no longer maintain his composure. He cried out urgently, "Great True One, do not listen to the slander of this villain! This junior…"</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes were deep and icy. Before Old Devil Ku Rong could finish, several chains erupted from the sea of clouds and shot towards him.</p><p>Old Devil Ku Rong was undoubtedly a Devil Dao genius, rarely matched in the Storm Realm, and one of the cultivators with the greatest hope of breaking through to the Void Refinement stage. Killing him was a pity.</p><p>But the world of cultivation never lacked geniuses.  The Flood Dragon King, with his even higher cultivation, wasn't he an even greater loss?</p><p>In Qin Sang's eyes, they were no different from ordinary Nascent Soul cultivators.  With him presiding over the main altar and Su Nu and the others managing the three branch altars, everyone else could only preside over ordinary altars.  A slight difference in cultivation level didn't matter much; there was no need to 'consider the bigger picture.'</p><p>Qin Sang wanted to make an example of them, to let everyone know that anyone who dared to betray him, even those as powerful as the Sky Hao Tower's Sect Master or a demon king, would meet the same end!</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>Old Devil Ku Rong and all those from the Tri-Sect Alliance involved in the plot were bound and thrown before the main peak to await their judgment.</p><p>Everyone was deathly silent, only Old Devil Fan's manic laughter echoed through the heavens.</p><p>However, the reckoning wasn't over yet.</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze shifted towards the seats where the Cang Lang Sea representatives sat. Bao Xi turned and nodded to someone behind him. A figure wearing a bronze mask flew out and knelt before the main peak, removing the mask to reveal the delicate face of a young man.</p><p>Seeing the young man's appearance, a middle-aged cultivator in the Zhong Zhou seats' pupils constricted, a sense of foreboding washing over him.</p><p>Grief etched on his face, the young man kowtowed repeatedly. "This junior, Yue Yi, is from the Yue family of Cang Lang Sea. My father and several clan elders responded to the call to reinforce the North Sea comrades, but were ambushed by villains who slaughtered over a hundred members of my Yue family and plundered our clan.  Upon hearing the news, my father rushed back, but the villains, fearing retribution, laid another ambush, resulting in my father's tragic death. I implore the Great True One to uphold justice!"</p><p>"Do you know who the culprits are?" Qin Sang asked.</p><p>"It's him!"</p><p>The young man pointed at the middle-aged cultivator, his eyes bloodshot. "He somehow learned that my Yue family possessed a piece of Azure Jade and asked my father for it.  My father refused, and he bore a grudge, killing and stealing!"</p><p>Those around the middle-aged cultivator erupted in an uproar upon hearing this. This person was an elder of the Spirit Weng Sect of Zhong Zhou. Though the Spirit Weng Sect wasn't as powerful as the Eight Sceneries Sect and other top sects in its heyday, it was still a righteous sect.  Unexpectedly, he had committed such an atrocious act, killing for a treasure.</p><p>Those who knew the situation recalled that the Spirit Weng Sect had a cultivation technique that required special spiritual objects, and it seemed the Azure Jade was one of them.</p><p>"Slander!"</p><p>The middle-aged cultivator slammed his hand on the table and rose, arguing vehemently, "This junior has never done such a thing! I ask the Great True One to discern the truth!"</p><p>"The Azure Jade must still be on him.  It has a unique fish shape and bears a mark inscribed by my father using a secret technique.  Even if someone stole it, it would take at least a year to erase."</p><p>The young man even had a method of verification. The middle-aged cultivator froze, then suddenly felt his body tighten as his Mustard Seed spatial artifact flew out on its own.  Moments later, the restrictions on it shattered, and the contents spilled out.  Indeed, there was a fish-shaped jade treasure, bearing a hidden mark, exactly as the young man described.</p><p>The middle-aged cultivator's face turned ashen.  The Spirit Weng Sect Master hurried forward. "This was done by him and his accomplices on their own.  The sect was truly unaware; otherwise, this junior would have done everything to stop it. This junior's poor judgment is unforgivable. I will ensure that the Yue family receives justice and will compensate them for all their losses…"</p><p>"Our allies risked their lives on the front lines, while they cowered and took advantage of the chaos to loot and pillage. Their crimes are unforgivable!" Qin Sang roared coldly.</p><p>*Swish! Swish!*</p><p>The middle-aged cultivator and his accomplices were bound by chains and dragged away.</p><p>Next, several others stepped forward to testify. All those who had taken advantage of the chaos during the North Sea ambush were either captured on the spot at Green Goat View or would not escape death.</p><p>Before the main peak of Green Goat View, the number of prisoners grew, a sea of black, many of them figures whose mere presence could shake the Storm Realm. The sight was chilling.</p><p>Finally, this great purge was coming to an end.</p><p>"Forced by circumstances, only severe punishment will suffice! The Flood Dragon King was the second most powerful cultivator after Fairy Liu Li at the late Nascent Soul stage, and Sect Master Ku Rong was a Devil Dao genius. However, their actions disregarded the greater good and only harmed the Storm Realm. The law is impartial. This poor Daoist has no choice but to eliminate them with a heavy heart, making an example to warn everyone!"</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze was burning. Wherever it landed, heads bowed.</p><p>"These are certainly not all. Some have hidden themselves well, while others have not yet had the chance to commit their evil deeds. You had best take this as a warning and remain hidden!"</p><p>The chains tautened, slowly lifting, suspending the prisoners in mid-air.</p><p>They had initially clung to a sliver of hope that, given their numbers, Qin Sang might spare them to fight against the external enemies.</p><p>Now, seeing that Qin Sang was truly about to kill them, the breath of death drawing near, fear flooded their hearts.</p><p>Some wept bitterly, some desperately begged for mercy, others, like Old Devil Fan, descended into madness. It was a display of the full spectrum of human emotion.</p><p>Old Devil Ku Rong and the Flood Dragon King were filled with resentment.  They had been fortunate to be brought to the Great Thousand World by the Storm Realm; otherwise, they might not have ascended. Their future should have been bright. Even if the Storm Realm were destroyed, they could have escaped in advance, preserving themselves and continuing their pursuit of the Dao.</p><p>Yet, because of a single misstep, they had lost everything!</p><p>"Roar!"</p><p>The last roar of the Flood Dragon King was abruptly cut short as his dragon head was severed at the neck.  His massive head tumbled down, blood gushing like a geyser, a gruesomely magnificent sight.</p><p>*Thump! Thump! Thump!*</p><p>At the same moment, the others were also beheaded. The pungent smell of blood quickly spread, staining the white clouds crimson.</p><p>The One Breath Lotus, nourished by the blood, bloomed with even more vibrant, alluring flowers.</p><p>On this day, heads rolled at Green Goat View.</p><p>This grand ceremony transformed into a crimson ritual, a human sacrifice.</p><p>Heads littered the ground, corpses swaying in the wind, suspended in mid-air.</p><p>This scene deeply impacted everyone present, etching the word "awe" into the depths of their hearts.</p><p>The massacre of so many might seem cruel, but the crimes of each were clear, and the judgment fair and just. No one could find fault.</p><p>Mountain winds swept through the sea of clouds.</p><p>The only sound seemed to be the wind, as everyone stared at the swaying corpses, restless and uneasy.</p><p>The ceremony had only just begun, and they wondered what awaited them next.</p><p>Qin Sang waved his hand, and flames ignited on the bodies, reducing them to ashes. The stench of blood vanished.</p><p>The previous display was warning enough. Today was Green Goat View's day of celebration; the corpses couldn't be left hanging in the sky.</p><p>Having eliminated the primary offenders, Qin Sang's expression softened somewhat. He said gently, "Everyone harbors selfish desires, and greed is difficult to satiate. The emergence of villains is not surprising. What brings this poor Daoist comfort is that in the face of this calamity, the North Sea comrades did not flinch, and many fellow Daoists were able to prioritize the greater good, such as the Western Buddhist Sect, the Wu Clan Daoists, some Daoists from the Demon Sea and the East Sea, the Four Saints Palace, Mount Not Mindful, Myriad Venom Mountain, and the瓊影門…"</p><p>Qin Sang looked at each one, expressing goodwill.</p><p>Master Huai Yin, Old Devil Fang, the Venom King, Sect Master Murong, the Feather King, Yuan Zhu, and others nodded in response.</p><p>The atmosphere gradually eased.</p><p>"You must have already realized that the Storm Realm faces not only external threats but also internal strife, such as the inheritance of various sects. Previously limited by the Lower Realm, the inheritances are incomplete beyond the Nascent Soul stage. Many fellow Daoists are likely facing the predicament of their lineage ending, with no path to cultivate…"</p><p>Qin Sang paused deliberately.</p><p>Those present were all intelligent and understood his implication. Their eyes brightened.</p><p>Qin Sang smiled. "This poor Daoist anticipated this issue. The enemy possesses complete inheritances, while we lack cultivation techniques.  Over time, the gap will only widen. Therefore, before coming here, this poor Daoist specifically gathered some cultivation techniques and Daoist arts in the Great Thousand World. They may not be suitable for everyone, but they can at least provide some reference and hope. If time permits, this poor Daoist can also help some fellow Daoists deduce and refine their cultivation techniques…"</p><p>Upon hearing this, everyone was overjoyed, their anticipation immediately outweighing their previous fear.</p><p>They also understood the meaning of the words "if time permits."</p><p>It seemed Qin Sang would display the collected cultivation techniques for everyone to study and practice. However, cultivating a different technique was certainly not as good as asking Qin Sang to help deduce their own sect's inheritance.</p><p>Even if Qin Sang wasn't familiar with their sect's techniques, his insight was unparalleled.  Just pointing them in the right direction would make their own deductions much easier.</p><p>The somber atmosphere vanished, and everyone cheered in unison.</p><p>"Thank you for your compassion, Great True One! We will pledge our lives to repay you!"</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head slightly.  "This is not for me, but for yourselves. The Storm Realm is our shared home.  This poor Daoist wants to see the Storm Realm prosper, and I'm sure you feel the same. Other matters can be discussed later. The most urgent task is how to defend against external enemies. This poor Daoist already has some ideas. After the ceremony, please remain, Sect Masters. This poor Daoist has something to discuss."</p><p>With that, Qin Sang nodded to Li Yu Fu, stepped aside, and stood at the edge of the altar, observing the ceremony.</p><p>Having witnessed their ancestor's awe-inspiring display of power, the Green Goat View disciples were already brimming with excitement and morale.</p><p>Even the dry and tedious ceremonial chants, recited from their mouths, carried a mountain-shaking momentum.</p><p>Many seats in the guest area were now empty. Seeing those vacant spots, everyone couldn't help but feel a chill, sitting up straight and patiently watching the ceremony.</p><p>Grand ceremonies had fixed rituals. Li Yu Fu led the Green Goat View disciples, proceeding step by step, without any missteps.  It continued until late at night, and no one showed impatience.</p><p>Finally, the ceremony concluded, but the guests didn't leave.  Following the Green Goat View disciples, they settled in for the night.</p><p>The various sect masters, along with Old Devil Fang, Yuan Zhu, and others, were invited to the Welcoming Guests Peak.</p><p>Qin Sang was waiting for them there.</p><p>"Yuan Zhu greets the Great True One."</p><p>Yuan Zhu took the initiative to bow.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist, there's no need for formalities.  It has been over a thousand years since we last parted. Recalling the past is like a dream. It is truly fortunate that we could meet again," Qin Sang said with emotion.</p><p>Yuan Zhu shared the sentiment.</p><p>Back then, he and Qin Sang had nearly died at the hands of the Nine Phoenix King, their situation perilous in the extreme.  At that time, they couldn't have imagined achieving such accomplishments.</p><p>Once everyone was seated, Qin Sang returned to the main seat and glanced around, his gaze not as intense as it had been during the day.</p><p>"This poor Daoist's words earlier were not meant to alarm. Even with countermeasures, this poor Daoist cannot guarantee absolute success. Therefore, my first priority is to find a refuge. You can select talented junior disciples to be sent there.  In the worst-case scenario, at least a spark of our lineage can be preserved."</p>
