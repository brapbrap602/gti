<h1>Chapter 2137: The Obsidian Skeleton</h1><p>“It might be in the Lu manor, or perhaps Lu Wang carries it on him.  When Fellow Daoist Qin locates the Mirage Conch, and if he intends to part with it, perhaps he might consider the Royal Family.  I assure you, Fellow Daoist Qin will be satisfied.”</p><p>Shaoshi spoke earnestly.</p><p>Although Qin Sang was powerful, he was an outsider and ineligible to enter the sacred grounds of the Otherfolk.  This treasure was useless to him.</p><p>The Mirage Conch of the Siyou Clan must be wielded by a descendant of the Siyou Clan. Among them, the only one on good terms with Qin Sang was Si Lu. Unless Qin Sang was willing to gift it, Si Lu certainly couldn't offer a higher price than the Royal Family.</p><p>The Si family of Yanshan already possessed a Mirage Conch, and with no top experts under Si Lu’s command, one was more than enough. Additional Mirage Conches held little significance for them.</p><p>The sacred grounds held countless opportunities, but they also served as a crucible for the Otherfolk cultivators, a place to temper and select the strongest. Dangers lurked within, some unavoidable even with the greatest caution.  Without sufficient strength, numbers didn't necessarily guarantee safety, and the sacred grounds could easily become a place of death.</p><p>Qin Sang remained noncommittal. Shaoshi was helpless; he couldn't force Qin Sang to hand over the Mirage Conch before things turned openly hostile.</p><p>As they spoke, the tide of battle shifted dramatically. The outer defenses of the Lu manor fell, and the inner manor crumbled soon after. Banners ripped apart and scattered in the wind as the protective formation shattered, leaving the advancing army unimpeded.</p><p>Si Lu had won a decisive victory.</p><p>From this day forward, the Lu family of Hanjiang would cease to exist!</p><p>At this moment, Shaoshi made a timely appearance, publicly announcing the Si Emperor’s decree, appointing Si Lu as the new Yan Wang. This not only represented the Royal Family’s recognition of his legitimacy but also tacitly approved the Lu family's destruction.</p><p>Seeing the Royal Family’s stance, the other factions abandoned their own schemes.  The Si family of Yanshan, and the title of Yan Wang, once again became familiar to the Siyou Clan.</p><p>Si Lu’s vengeance was complete, but rebuilding the Si family of Yanshan would take time. Qin Sang wasn't concerned with the subsequent affairs and soon returned to the Storm Realm. Su Nu and Zhu Que remained for a time to assist Si Lu.</p><p>…</p><p>Qingyang Temple.</p><p>Qin Sang’s journey didn't take long. Returning to his cave dwelling, he woke Min Zhuo and released some of his seals.</p><p>Min Zhuo slowly opened his eyes, realizing he was still restrained, unable to move, though his internal injuries had improved considerably.</p><p>During this time, Qin Sang had fed him various healing elixirs and, sparing no True Essence, personally tended to his wounds. Yet, Min Zhuo didn't believe Qin Sang’s actions were out of kindness, but he couldn't fathom his true intentions.</p><p>“Fellow Daoist Qin, what exactly do you plan to do with me? Just give me a quick death!”</p><p>Min Zhuo spoke coldly.</p><p>He had initially harbored a sliver of hope of submitting to Qin Sang, but Qin Sang’s demeanor indicated otherwise.  He gradually realized that Qin Sang likely wouldn't allow him to leave alive.  Qin Sang's strange actions filled him with an inexplicable chill.</p><p>Qin Sang produced two meditation mats, settling onto one and gesturing towards the other.  Powerless to resist, Min Zhuo landed opposite Qin Sang, sitting upright.</p><p>“What are you doing?!”</p><p>Sensing danger, Min Zhuo demanded sharply.</p><p>As he finished speaking, spiritual light flashed from the Thousand Jun Ring, projecting a beam of obsidian light. It revealed a skull, its surface smooth and radiating an obsidian glow. The empty sockets seemed to flicker with an eerie light.</p><p>This obsidian skull was obtained after Qin Sang slew Patriarch Ming Hu. It was formed from the patriarch’s remains.</p><p>Initially covered in cracks, Qin Sang had been unsure of its power and stored it away. Later, in his spare time, he took it out to study, discovering that it could self-repair, though thankfully not to the point of resurrecting Patriarch Ming Hu.</p><p>Combining his understanding of Artifact Refinement, Qin Sang treated it as a magical treasure.  Through repeated experimentation, his comprehension of the obsidian skull deepened. He personally refined it, developing certain ideas he intended to test on Min Zhuo.</p><p>The obsidian skull floated between Qin Sang and Min Zhuo, facing the latter.  Stared at by the empty sockets, Min Zhuo felt a chill run down his spine, a premonition of something terrible.</p><p>Qin Sang consecutively struck several hand seals. The obsidian glow flickered erratically, and the skull's surface seemed to ignite with obsidian flames. These illusory flames emitted no heat, making the skull appear even more sinister.</p><p>“Forgive me,” Qin Sang said indifferently.  With a thought, the obsidian skull flew towards Min Zhuo.</p><p>“What is this…”</p><p>Min Zhuo cried out in alarm, but his words were cut short by a sudden, searing pain.</p><p>The obsidian skull settled directly atop his head, its base pressed tightly against his scalp.</p><p>Min Zhuo appeared to have two heads, the point of connection erupting with bursts of illusory obsidian fire.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>Min Zhuo shrieked in agony. Though his cultivation was sealed, his mind remained clear, yet even he couldn't endure this torment.</p><p>Through the obsidian flames, one could see the light cutting into his skin like blades. The skull was embedding itself into his scalp, burrowing deeper, attempting to penetrate his body.</p><p>Min Zhuo suffered immensely, but completely restrained, he couldn't even struggle.</p><p>Qin Sang watched with an impassive gaze, his eyes fixed on the obsidian skull.</p><p>There were no normal wounds, and therefore no blood. At the point of connection, only a mass of writhing flesh buds pulsed, indistinguishable whether they belonged to Min Zhuo, the obsidian skull, or perhaps a symbiotic growth—a truly grotesque sight.</p><p>The skull burrowed deeper, and Min Zhuo’s screams grew hoarse, his breath weakening as deathly energy invaded his body.</p><p>Even more horrifying, Min Zhuo felt his consciousness fading.</p><p>The process was proceeding more smoothly than anticipated.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded inwardly. But just as this thought crossed his mind, his expression hardened.</p><p>The obsidian skull, now halfway embedded, suddenly began to tremble without warning. The obsidian light flashed violently as a force within Min Zhuo fiercely resisted.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes flickered, and he immediately intervened, attempting to stabilize the skull, but the repulsive force was too strong, his efforts futile.</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>With a loud crack, the light abruptly dimmed, and the obsidian skull was ejected from Min Zhuo’s body.</p><p>Min Zhuo’s body appeared unharmed, with no visible wounds, yet the pain lingered, his breath still weak, as if the skull had inflicted significant damage. It took a long time for him to regain a sliver of vitality.</p><p>“Demon! You falsely claim to be a Daoist Master!”</p><p>Min Zhuo roared, his eyes filled with hatred.</p><p>Qin Sang ignored him, picking up the obsidian skull and examining it, recalling the process and silently calculating.</p><p>Min Zhuo’s cultivation was completely sealed; logically, he shouldn't have been able to resist, yet the repulsive force had been undeniable.</p><p>After careful consideration, Qin Sang deduced the source of the resistance: Min Zhuo’s life force and will, and also the obsidian skull itself.  The two were inherently incompatible. Forcing their union was doomed to fail.</p><p>He had been limited by his past experiences, attempting to manipulate a living corpse with the obsidian skull.  Soul Formation cultivators possessed endless lifespans and unwavering wills, making them nearly impossible to transform into refined corpses while alive, at least not with his current cultivation.  Furthermore, he had abandoned the path of necromancy long ago.</p><p>Understanding this, Qin Sang ceased his futile attempts and looked up at Min Zhuo.  “Lend me your body.”</p><p>“You…”</p><p>Min Zhuo’s eyes glazed over, their light rapidly extinguishing.</p><p>The patriarch of the Chang You Clan perished.</p><p>Qin Sang once again guided the obsidian skull onto Min Zhuo’s head. This time, he encountered no resistance. However, after embedding itself halfway, the skull’s progress slowed.</p><p>During this process, Qin Sang continued to comprehend the changes, making adjustments as needed.  Certain aspects he hadn’t fully grasped before were now validated in practice, and he quickly grasped the underlying principles.</p><p>Under Qin Sang's control, the skull burrowed deeper, until it completely vanished within Min Zhuo's body.</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>Min Zhuo stood up straight, his eyes closed.  His features remained unchanged, showing no outward sign of the obsidian skull that had replaced his own skull.</p><p>It could be described as parasitism or fusion. Through the obsidian skull, Qin Sang effortlessly obtained a refined corpse.  Of course, only now did it appear effortless; the prior process of comprehending and refining the skull had been far from easy.</p><p>With a thought, Qin Sang commanded Min Zhuo to walk out of the cave. He obeyed completely.</p><p>Unlike a living corpse, both the obsidian skull and the body were inanimate, devoid of their own will.  Unless a new consciousness arose in the future, betrayal was impossible.</p><p>Qin Sang flew outside, hovering in the air, facing Min Zhuo.</p><p>Moments later, Min Zhuo spread his arms wide, and the roar of water filled the air as a great river materialized out of thin air, meandering in nine bends.</p><p>He could manipulate Heavenly and Earthly Essence like a true Soul Formation cultivator, and he could even utilize Min Zhuo’s divine abilities!</p><p>This was an unexpected boon. Qin Sang immediately ordered Min Zhuo to attack him.</p><p>*Crash!*</p><p>The river surged, its currents roaring as they rushed towards Qin Sang.  The Ming Shan Armor materialized around him, and he secretly activated his Dharma Idol and the Great Vajra Wheel Seal, preparing to withstand the blow head-on.</p><p>*Rumble…*</p><p>Waves crashed and thundered as they washed over Qin Sang, who stood firm like a pillar in the river, unyielding.</p><p>*Splash!*</p><p>The river water abruptly reversed its course, returning to Min Zhuo and coalescing into a colossal water giant, its massive fist hurtling towards Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang raised his hand to block, fist meeting palm.  The void trembled violently.  Fortunately, he had set up restrictions beforehand, preventing the disturbance from reaching others.</p><p>In the next instant, Min Zhuo was pushed back, the river water dispersing around him.</p><p>Qin Sang lowered his hand, pondering in silence, assessing Min Zhuo's strength.</p><p>The ability to control Heavenly and Earthly Essence alone was beyond the reach of Nascent Soul cultivators.  This was undoubtedly Soul Formation level combat prowess, though still slightly inferior to Min Zhuo in his prime.</p><p>Qin Sang understood.  The most suitable host for the obsidian skull wasn't a Dharma cultivator.</p><p>“A Soul Formation body refiner, or a powerful demon with an innately strong physical body, would be ideal to fully unleash the power of the obsidian skull," Qin Sang thought to himself.</p><p>This was another invaluable aspect of the obsidian skull. Qin Sang discovered he could extract it from Min Zhuo’s body and transfer it to another. Whether there were any limitations to this switching remained to be seen.</p><p>The obsidian skull was undoubtedly a rare treasure with numerous advantages, but not without its drawbacks.</p><p>Besides the specific requirements for the host body, Patriarch Ming Hu’s cultivation had only been at the early Soul Formation stage.  The obsidian skull couldn't be without limitations.  Despite Qin Sang’s meticulous refinement, transforming it from its original skull form, he couldn't guarantee whether it could control a corpse with a higher cultivation level than its previous owner.</p><p>Unfortunately, on the battlefield, to prevent Lu Wang and the others from escaping using their divine abilities, Qin Sang hadn't held back.  None of the slain experts had remained intact.</p><p>After his experiment, Qin Sang returned to his cave with Min Zhuo.</p><p>Min Zhuo stood silently behind Qin Sang, like a shadow guard.</p><p>His appearance remained unchanged, his skin now with an almost imperceptible obsidian tint. Qin Sang could control his expressions, making them appear lively and realistic.  Aside from a faint aura of deathly energy, he was indistinguishable from a living person, giving no indication of being a refined corpse.</p><p>There were many ways to conceal deathly energy. Qin Sang retrieved a cloak and had Min Zhuo wear it.</p><p>As long as he didn't act, Min Zhuo was essentially a corpse, posing no threat of exposure. Qin Sang stored him within his Small Cave-Heaven. From now on, he had another fearless helper at his disposal.</p><p>Finally, Qin Sang had time to thoroughly examine the belongings of Lu Wang and the others.  Most of the spiritual treasures from the Lu manor were attuned to the Siyou Clan's bloodline.  Qin Sang left them all to Si Lu, allowing him to trade them within the Siyou Clan for useful treasures.</p><p>Upon reflection, Qin Sang had no immediate needs, except for spirit pills and medicines that enhanced cultivation. These were always valuable and in demand.</p><p>The path ahead seemed clear; he only needed to continue cultivating steadily.</p><p>Qin Sang categorized the items based on their value and type, handing over those of lesser value to Li Yufu or using them to enhance his sect.</p><p>With the world stabilized and the people’s hearts won over, he could manage his sect according to his vision.  The Storm Realm's structure would inevitably change, requiring him to establish altars, preach the Dao…</p><p>These matters required a step-by-step approach. Before that, he needed to visit Ziyun Mountain.</p><p>Not long after, Su Nu and Zhu Que returned.</p><p>Qin Sang informed them of his upcoming departure, requesting Su Nu to stay and oversee the sect.</p><p>Upon hearing this, Zhu Que perked up, hopping onto Qin Sang's shoulder and chirping, “I'm going too! I'm going too! With this Zhu Que around, all beings will bow their heads in submission, unable to defy!  I’ll definitely help you win the beauty’s heart! Hehe…”</p><p>It was unknown from whom this creature had learned such a thing, its laughter becoming increasingly vulgar.</p><p>Qin Sang had already intended to bring Zhu Que along.  The next day, he bid farewell to Su Nu and set off for Ziyun Mountain.</p><p>Not long after entering the Zhu Yan Clan's territory, Yuan Miao received news and personally came out to greet him.</p><p>Since their last encounter, Yuan Miao hadn't mentioned sparring again.</p><p>After exchanging pleasantries, they arrived at the Teleportation Hall, where Yuan Miao handed Qin Sang a token.</p><p>“This is our clan’s Guest Elder token. Carry it with you, Fellow Daoist, for convenience.  The Clan Leader instructed me earlier that the place you're heading to is located at the southernmost tip of the Mist Sea, connected to the teleportation formations of the major clans. It's our Heavenly Branch's gateway to and from the Mist Sea. Beyond the Mist Sea lies the territory of the Eastern Sea aquatic race. Although we have an alliance with them, it's a chaotic place and not safe.  Moreover, Fellow Daoist is of human origin, so caution is advised…”</p><p>At this point, Yuan Miao slapped his forehead. “I almost forgot that Fellow Daoist’s demon disguise is flawless.  Your journey will certainly be uneventful.”</p><p>Qin Sang smiled faintly, attaching the token to his waist and donning a cloak.  As Yuan Miao activated the Great Teleportation Formation, he bowed slightly and stepped into the formation.</p><p>The world spun, and the void distorted.</p><p>After a flash of light and shadow, Qin Sang felt himself land back on solid ground, now countless miles away.</p>
