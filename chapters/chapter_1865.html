<h1>Chapter 1856:  Astonishment</h1><p>Blood-Polluting Radiance!</p><p>Since the life-bound spirit sword merged with the Jiao wood spirit, the radiance has lain dormant for many years, finally reappearing today.</p><p>The Jade Kettle is a spirit treasure; naturally, it wouldn't be completely destroyed as before after being defiled by the Blood-Polluting Radiance.</p><p>However, a spirit treasure tainted by the Blood-Polluting Radiance will have its spirit clouded, its essence veiled as if by a cataract, and its power weakened.</p><p>The master only needs to refine it to cleanse the defilement and fully restore its spirit, or with some effort, temporarily suppress it using the treasure's power.</p><p>But there's no time for refinement on the battlefield!</p><p>The bloody light suddenly appeared, and the Jade Kettle's own treasure radiance offered no resistance. The bloody light easily pierced through the radiance and fell upon the Kettle.</p><p>Half of the Jade Kettle's body was stained blood-red, as if the Kettle contained half a pot of blood plasma, or as if a pool of blood had been splashed on its body, adding a touch of eerie beauty.</p><p>The Jade Kettle trembled violently, emitting a bright light, but it was powerless to stop the Blood-Polluting Radiance's invasion. The bloody light flashed, penetrating the Kettle's body and merging with it, after which the Jade Kettle's treasure radiance suddenly dimmed.</p><p>Around the Jade Kettle, white smoke gathered into a white ribbon, one end connected to the Kettle's mouth, circling and dancing around it like a sash.  Previously, it was through this ribbon that it entangled with the Yunyou Sword.</p><p>No matter how sharp the spirit sword, no matter how many times the ribbon was cut, it would instantly regenerate and wrap around the sword again and again.</p><p>If Qin Sang's swordsmanship was slightly inferior, or if the Yunyou Sword's grade was not high enough, it might even be bound by the ribbon.</p><p>The moment the Jade Kettle was defiled, the dancing ribbon instantly lost its previous agility.  Though not completely dissipated, the smoke was noticeably scattered.</p><p>Now was the time!</p><p>The Yunyou Sword let out a clear ring, its light blazed, and its energy surged a hundred meters outward.</p><p>‘Pfft! Pfft! Pfft!’</p><p>With a single stroke, the ribbon was severed into several pieces, the smoke dissipating into wisps.</p><p>Seizing the opportunity, the Jade Kettle was too late to stop the Yunyou Sword.</p><p>The sword's light was not aimed at the Jade Kettle itself, but at Dingxiang Hou's true form in the dream, passing by the Kettle, the sword energy like a rainbow.</p><p>In an instant, a sword descended from the heavens, its roar like thunder, cleaving the dream sky!</p><p>A heaven-cleaving sword, a golden sun hanging in the sky.</p><p>The sword's light and the golden light were evenly matched in momentum.</p><p>The Yunyou Sword and the Sun Wheel Seal erupted almost simultaneously, the Dingxiang Hou's dream world suffering a double blow.</p><p>The dream power was already struggling to withstand the golden sun, the dream world already in disarray under the golden light's assault, and with this heaven-shaking sword strike, a greater collapse began.</p><p>Wherever the sword light passed, the scenes in the dream world were annihilated, encountering almost no effective resistance, leaving a striking scar in the sky. The sword's momentum was awe-inspiring, fiercely attacking Dingxiang Hou!</p><p>The Sun Wheel Seal destroyed the dream.</p><p>The sword struck the enemy's true form.</p><p>The coordination between the spirit sword and the divine ability was seamless!</p><p>Qin Sang pressed down firmly on the wildly struggling tapir demon, the golden sun above his head, his eyes radiating divine light.</p><p>At this moment, Dingxiang Hou's hiding place had become a mountain, but to counter the golden sun, a volcano filled with magma.</p><p>Red light illuminated the sky from the mouth of the volcano, magma surged, emitting intense heat. Dingxiang Hou slumbered deep within the mountain, surrounded by magma, yet unharmed.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The sword light descended from the heavens, swift as a meteor.</p><p>Before the sword arrived, the magma in the mountain was already impacted by an invisible force, continuously flowing to both sides, creating a sword scar in the middle.</p><p>The sleeping Dingxiang Hou's body writhed uneasily. He never imagined that the spirit treasure he relied on would be broken by his opponent's spirit sword, and the timing of this sword strike was so incredibly precise.</p><p>In shock, Dingxiang Hou cast some spell, causing wisps of black smoke to rise from his body.</p><p>The black smoke quickly drifted into the magma. A ‘crackling’ sound was heard, the red light faded, and the magma solidified into black rocks.</p><p>In an instant, the entire mountain became a black mountain, seemingly forged from black iron, a unified whole, clearly incredibly hard.</p><p>Almost the instant the magma solidified, the sword light arrived!</p><p>‘Bang! Bang! Bang!’</p><p>The sword light plunged straight into the mountaintop.</p><p>The peak was split in two on the spot.</p><p>As the sword light continued to cut downwards, a sword scar ran from the peak to the mountain's interior, the mountain body violently shaking.</p><p>The black mountain was indeed harder than iron. Before reaching the mountain's interior, the sword's momentum noticeably weakened. Judging by its remaining power, even if it could split the mountain, the speed would be significantly slower.</p><p>A brief delay was all Dingxiang Hou needed to escape the sword's edge.</p><p>Before Dingxiang Hou could breathe a sigh of relief, Yunyou Sword trembled slightly.  A soul-stirring clang resonated from within the mountain.</p><p>Simultaneously, an unprecedentedly powerful sword intent erupted from the base of the sword scar, accompanied by a sharper, more dazzling sword light!</p><p>‘Rip!’</p><p>A strange sound, like cloth tearing, echoed from the sword scar – the mountain was splitting apart.</p><p>The Seven Souls Formation unleashed.  Qin Sang, no longer concealing her strength, directly wielded Yunyou Sword to cast it, rather than using sword shadows.</p><p>Yunyou Sword, dormant for many years, had previously lacked full power when the formation was cast through other spirit swords.</p><p>This was the first time, after Yunyou Sword's transformation, that its full might was unleashed in actual combat!</p><p>The Black Mountain, capable of withstanding sword shadows, was now as fragile as silk under Yunyou Sword.</p><p>The sword scar rapidly expanded, instantly piercing the mountain's interior!</p><p>Inside the mountain, Dingxiang Hou abruptly stood, his eyes still closed, but his face contorted in terror.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The cave ceiling tore open, the sword light filling the chamber.  The spirit sword hung above him, its terrifying intent and killing aura assaulting his mind. He felt the breath of death in his dream.</p><p>"Ugh!"</p><p>In sheer terror, Dingxiang Hou unhesitatingly bit his tongue, spitting out a mouthful of refined blood.</p><p>The blood twisted and morphed into a creature resembling a tapir demon.</p><p>Meanwhile, the external dream world rumbled incessantly, the dream itself rapidly collapsing, unable to withstand the Day Wheel Seal any longer.</p><p>The dream was overwhelmed by a golden tide of light, shattering into countless fragments.  These fragments further disintegrated, light as dust, swept away by the golden light, leaving the dream world utterly unrecognizable.</p><p>Qin Sang felt the struggle beneath her cease. The tapir demon first became rigid, then dissipated into a wisp of white smoke.</p><p>Also vanishing was the jade bottle entangled with the four dream serpents.</p><p>Only the Black Mountain remained, though the sword scar across its middle was striking, nearly cleaving it in two.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>Sword light pierced the mountain base, the sword scar completely bisecting the Black Mountain.</p><p>The split mountain sides collapsed, revealing a cavern large enough to contain Dingxiang Hou's demonic form.</p><p>The cave was filled with sword light, alongside a surge of dense blood.</p><p>A crystalline bubble seemed to float near the blood.</p><p>From the scene, it appeared that Dingxiang Hou had been defeated by the spirit sword, slain in a single blow, reduced to a blood mist, leaving no corpse behind.</p><p>Qin Sang knew the terrifying power of the Seven Souls Formation unleashed by Yunyou Sword.</p><p>Yet, seeing this, Qin Sang showed no joy, abruptly turning her head to scan the edge of the dream.</p><p>There, a faint white shadow silently emerged, then solidified, revealing a tapir demon – Dingxiang Hou himself.</p><p>Dingxiang Hou’s eyes snapped open, awakening from the dream, his eyes still reflecting lingering horror.</p><p>Had he not possessed extraordinary abilities, he would have perished under the sword!</p><p>This was the peculiar nature of his dream path abilities; he could forcibly awaken upon sensing danger, instantly transferring to any location within the dream's reach, but at the cost of his refined blood and severe depletion of his vital energy.</p><p>This dream-escape ability was exceptionally difficult to counter. Any method of confinement, be it formations or spells, even if his physical body was firmly bound, couldn't prevent his dream-shift.</p><p>Of course, foreknowledge of his ability would offer a countermeasure. However, Qin Sang lacked this knowledge of Dingxiang Hou, and he escaped, rendering much of the spirit sword's power wasted.</p><p>The power of that strike sent shivers down Dingxiang Hou's spine. Blood welled from his back, staining his white fur, causing a burning pain.</p><p>He was injured; Yunyou Sword had left a long scar on his back, its intent penetrating deep into his flesh.</p><p>The pain wasn't just from the wound but also from his internal organs; he felt as if his entire body had been cleaved.</p><p>While the external wound wasn't severe, Dingxiang Hou knew his internal organs were injured, compounding the damage from his ability.</p><p>Moreover, he had lost the spirit tree!</p><p>The bubble, encased in sword light, quietly floated where the cave once was.</p><p>Dingxiang Hou's escape ability could transport familiar objects, things that had been with him for years, sharing a linked aura, or items of low rank and insignificant power.</p><p>The bubble was clearly not one of these; he hadn't even understood the blue enchantment on its surface.</p><p>Desperate to escape, Dingxiang Hou had no time for material possessions.</p><p>At this point, Ding Xiang Hou knew that in his current state, he couldn't possibly reclaim the Spirit Tree from Qin Sang. He didn't know how he would explain this to the Lord.</p><p>He hesitated whether to continue the fight, but hadn't noticed that he had lost his sharpness. He secretly thought that if the fight continued, he might very well meet his end.</p><p>This thought had just crossed his mind when Ding Xiang Hou suddenly sensed something was wrong, a warning alarm going off in his heart, immediately turning him pale with fright.</p><p>The sword intent hadn't missed its target because of his retreat, it followed like a shadow, an imminent death threat, unavoidable!</p><p>“What kind of sword technique is this!”</p><p>Ding Xiang Hou was terrified, feeling his entire body grow cold, his blood nearly freezing.  Without time to think, he hastily activated a token in his mind.</p><p>Black water gurgled out from his brow, a blood-red token emerging from the water. The blood token exploded, transforming into a beam of bloody light sweeping across a wide area.</p><p>The bloody light washed over his body, colliding fiercely with the murderous sword intent.</p><p>The sword's hum resonated in Ding Xiang Hou's ears. His heart leaped, then he rejoiced, finally gaining a respite. His body flickered, merging into the bloody light, burning his life force to perform a blood escape.</p><p>This blood token was a rare treasure; he received it as a gift from Ling You Wang, who personally refined it, infusing it with the essence of a demon king's blood – a lifesaver in desperate situations.</p><p>Even with other means at his disposal, forcing him to use the blood token meant he dared not stay any longer. His fighting spirit vanished, he only wanted to escape.</p><p>He not only lost the Spirit Tree, but also failed to retrieve his slightly damaged Spirit Treasure, the Jade Flask, afraid of being pursued by Qin Sang.</p><p>A blood-red streak tore through layers of light waves, breaking through the air, its speed astonishing.</p><p>A flash of lightning, and Qin Sang appeared where Ding Xiang Hou had been moments before, frowning at the receding blood-red streak.</p><p>The blood escape was fast, but his own speed wasn't slow either, and the opponent was already sword-wounded; the blood escape wouldn't last long.</p><p>If it weren't for the threat of the Demon King, pursuing him might have had a considerable chance of killing the demon.</p><p>After some thought, Qin Sang gave up the chase, sighing inwardly.  He acknowledged the demon king's trusted subordinate indeed possessed life-saving measures.</p><p>He considered his planning in this battle flawless; apart from not using the Five Element Crown, he'd used almost all his trump cards.</p><p>However, Qin Sang was already very satisfied with the outcome: the Sun Wheel Seal broke the divine ability, the spirit sword severely injured the strong enemy, and most importantly, he had seized the Spirit Tree.</p><p>As for the Spirit Treasure, the Jade Flask, it mattered little.  Unless the flask body was inscribed with the Tongbao Spell, it was unlikely to be useful to him.</p><p>Looking in the direction of Ding Xiang Hou's escape, Qin Sang could only see a chaotic sea of light, yet he felt a vague unease, remembering the fleeing demon marquis earlier – fearing the imminent arrival of the Demon King.</p><p>He didn't dare linger, casually storing the dimly glowing Jade Flask into his Qianjun Ring, then flew to the side of the bubble.</p><p>Grasping the bubble, Qin Sang flapped his phoenix wings and flew in the opposite direction, examining the bubble as he flew.</p><p>Extremely pure Wood Spirit energy emanated from the bubble, the entire bubble covered by a huge crown of leaves.</p><p>Although he couldn't see the tree trunk, the shape of the leaves was identical to the Vajra Bodhi Tree, and there was a Vajra fruit on the top of the crown, deeply attracting Qin Sang's attention.</p><p>The blue light restriction on the surface of the bubble was stronger than any he had encountered before. Breaking it wouldn't be easy.</p><p>Fortunately, Qin Sang had the assistance of the Sky-Eyed Butterfly, and he had accumulated experience breaking restrictions before.</p><p>Qin Sang immediately activated the secret technique from the *Pan Hu Zhen Jing*, fully assisting the Sky-Eyed Butterfly to analyze the restriction's network to break it as quickly as possible and obtain the Vajra fruit.</p><p>While breaking the restriction, Qin Sang flew straight towards the outer edge of the valley, hoping to weaken the restriction's power.</p><p>Unexpectedly, at that moment, Qin Sang's unease intensified, and he abruptly turned around.</p><p>Behind him was still the same monotonous sea of light, but Qin Sang felt the distant light waves were somewhat gloomy.</p><p>At his level of cultivation, it was difficult to experience illusions.  There was only one explanation: he was being targeted by Ling You Wang!</p><p>Before even seeing the enemy's figure, the oppressive presence emanating from the Demon King was already suffocating. Qin Sang's heart leaped, not daring to hesitate for a moment, and he flew with all his might.</p><p>……</p><p>In the rear.</p><p>Ding Xiang Hou had escaped with his life, not daring to stop his blood escape until he saw Ling You Wang, only then did his mind relax, feeling as if he had finally escaped death.</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>Ling You Wang blocked the bloody light.</p><p>The bloody light stopped, revealing Ding Xiang Hou.</p><p>Sensing Ding Xiang Hou's weak aura, Ling You Wang's eyes flashed with a sharp light, and he asked in a deep voice, “How many opponents were there?”</p><p>Seeing Ding Xiang Hou's sorry state, Ling You Wang was also shocked. He knew the strength of his subordinate; his Dream Path divine ability was incredibly profound.</p><p>Without understanding Ding Xiang Hou's abilities, even Ling You Wang, after self-mutilation, would have had to put in some effort.</p><p>“Only one! I am incompetent, I was no match for him, I lost the Spirit Tree and the Spirit Treasure,” Ding Xiang Hou said with shame, his tone urgent, knowing the urgency of the situation, quickly recounting his encounter.</p><p>Yuan Hou, who had been flying away with You Bo, caught up at this time. Seeing Ding Xiang Hou, he was shocked and filled with fear.</p><p>“This person is extremely powerful, Your Majesty, be careful!”</p><p>Finally, Ding Xiang Hou couldn't help but remind him.</p><p>Ling You Wang looked into the distance, his eyes filled with killing intent. He snorted coldly, suddenly transforming into a fish demon form, riding the waves away.</p><p>“Let Yuan Hou take you to meet with them.”</p><p>Ling You Wang left these words, the two demon marquis looked at each other, knowing that they probably couldn't even catch up, so they obeyed the order.
