**Chapter 290: Traps**

“I didn’t detect any warning signs from my men… Even if we were in danger, I don’t think we’d be trapped here with those old geezers around. Stop being so paranoid. Yu the old ghost has been in there for a while now. We can’t afford to dawdle!”

Having spoken his mind, Luo Xingnan turned into a beam of escape light and sped away, the others following closely behind.

Master Shengyuan shook his head helplessly and admitted that Luo Xingnan made some valid points. Nevertheless, he waved his hand to launch a spiritual energy attack at the abyss. The attack cut through the dark energy and caused a stir, but no other changes could be observed.

Master Shengyuan rushed to catch up upon realizing this.

They soon flew over the abyss and found it to be calm.

Master Shengyuan looked away and let down his guard, laughing at himself for his earlier suspicions.

However, the laughter had barely left his face when he suddenly heard an extremely faint hissing sound.

“What is that!?”

Master Shengyuan’s laughter froze, and his face darkened.

It was not just Master Shengyuan who had heard it, but everyone else. They looked around and found the source of the sound coming from two hills in front of them.

Not far across from the abyss stood two stone mountains, like sentinels of the wilderness.

The stone mountains were barren and not particularly short, but compared with the distant mountains that grew spirit herbs, they paled in comparison. They were not eye-catching at all.

Master Shengyuan and his companions had been so focused on the abyss that they had completely overlooked these mountains. After all, there was nothing to be seen on their bare slopes. With nothing amiss in the abyss, no one had imagined that there could be trouble there.

The sound came suddenly, like the hiss of some kind of monster.

The next moment, the ground began to shake violently, and the hissing sound grew louder. It thundered across the plains and quickly rose to a deafening volume.

Soon after, a cloud of red mist erupted from the top of each mountain, shooting up with a loud whoosh.

It seemed as if there were giant caves inside the mountains. The red mist appeared without warning and spread out indefinitely, covering half the sky in an instant.

The two clouds of mist met between the mountains, forming a roadblock.

“There are snakes inside!” someone yelled, pointing at the mist.

“Grappling snakes!”

Finally, everyone saw the tip of the iceberg of the red mist.

The mist was the breath exhaled by a type of snake-like demonic beast!

These snakes were exceptionally strange and had the bodies of serpents. Each one was at least several dozen meters long. Unlike true snakes, these grappling snakes had forked tails, and the two resulting snake tails were like iron hooks, gleaming with a dark iron luster.

Their unique appearance allowed everyone to quickly identify the grappling snakes. At the same time, they recalled the records about them.

These demonic beasts possessed the power of a Peak Mortal Realm demon at maturity. With cultivation, it was easy for them to break through to the Spirit Demon Realm.

Their greatest strength was their poison.

The red mist they exhaled could not only act as a protective shield, absorbing damage, but it also contained deadly venom. Even a cultivator who accidentally inhaled it or had their body exposed to it would be in grave danger.

The two tail hooks also carried a poison that could kill instantly, and they were incredibly hard. They could even withstand the attack of magic weapons!

At the moment, the red mist covered the sky, and countless snake figures could be seen writhing within it. It was impossible to tell how many grappling snakes were hiding, but there were at least dozens. Even if only half of them had broken through to the Spirit Demon Realm, it would be a huge problem!

To make matters worse, there might even be Great Demons of the Mid or Late Spirit Demon Realm among them!

Luo Xingnan and Master Shengyuan exchanged a glance, both deeply perplexed. Before the grappling snakes appeared, there had been no trace of fighting on or near the mountain. How had Yu Kong avoided the grappling snakes’ senses and passed by them?

However, that was not the time to consider that.

“Retreat to the cave!”

The two did not dare to hesitate. They made a decision and gave the order to retreat.

The terrain was open here, and if they were surrounded by a swarm of snakes and trapped in the red mist, no one could be sure that they would survive.

Only by relying on the narrow cave entrance could they calmly set up a formation, divide the swarm, and slowly hunt down the grappling snakes. The grappling snakes were only demonic beasts, after all, and there were so many Foundation Establishment cultivators present that they were not afraid even of such a large number of them.

The others obeyed the order and quickly retreated into a formation.

The grappling snakes hissed and roared, and the red mist spread rapidly, pursuing them relentlessly.

“Be careful not to get injured! Don’t let these brutes smell blood!”

Sheng Yuanzi suddenly thought of something and yelled out.
Rumor has it that the Hook Snake is very sensitive to blood, especially that of Human Cultivators, and will become extremely frenzied and go berserk if it smells it, unlike the Hook Snake here.
Before the sound of his voice faded, they suddenly heard two loud bangs beneath their feet.
The crowd was shocked and looked down to see two clouds of blood mist explode in the abyss.
Flesh and bone fragments, mixed with blood, splashed everywhere.
The crowd was caught off guard and immediately surrounded by the two clouds of blood mist on the left and right.
“Moon Crescent Immortal!”
Luo Xingnan’s face changed dramatically, and he cried out in shock.
Sheng Yuanzi’s expression was also extremely horrified, obviously recognizing the withered vine elder.
At that moment, they suddenly understood something. No wonder there were no secret marks left, and there were no fighting marks.
Their spy had been exposed long ago, and Yu Kong had known it all along, but turned a blind eye, allowing the spy to pass the message and lure them in.
This was obviously a trap精心设计的陷阱 designed by Yu Kong!
Its purpose may have been to use them to attract the Hook Snake, or there may have been a more sinister idea.
“Quick! Wipe out the blood mist!”
Sheng Yuanzi was the first to react and shouted, at the same time releasing a fiery red flame to try to burn the blood away. The others naturally did not dare to neglect it, and they all worked to remove the smell of blood.
But it was too late.
The red mist followed relentlessly, just behind them. At the moment when the body exploded, the Hook Snake had already smelled the blood.
In the red mist, where Luo Xingnan and the others could not see, the Hook Snake’s eyes suddenly turned bright red, staring at everyone in the abyss.
The roaring sound suddenly erupted dozens or hundreds of times.
Even more alarmingly, deep in the abyss, the dark energy suddenly rolled violently, and two huge snake figures shot out of the abyss with the sound of a roaring roar, like arrows leaving a bowstring, at an alarming speed!
At this time, Qin Sang and the others, who were hiding in the dark, did not dare to breathe, for fear that the Hook Snake, which was about to go crazy, would smell them and they would suffer the same fate as Luo Xingnan and the others.
―――――
Qin Sang quietly looked at Yu Kong’s hiding place. Now that the Hook Snake had been completely attracted by Luo Xingnan and the others, Yu Kong did not take the opportunity to sneak past from the other side to quietly gather herbs.
Does he want to stay here and watch the battle, waiting for the outcome of this battle before moving?
