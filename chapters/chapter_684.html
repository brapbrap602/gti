<h1>Chapter 676: Red Leaf Island and Huntian Island</h1><p>“Fellow cultivator, you should know that the transformation brought about by a demonic beast’s pill formation is immense, far surpassing the benefits we cultivators receive.  Demonic beasts with powerful bloodline abilities, such as the offspring of the royal lineages like the Jiao dragons and Fengluan, often surpass their cultivation level after pill formation, making them extremely difficult to deal with. There was a tale, of a late-stage Demonic Core Xuanwu bloodline turtle battling a human Yuan Ying cultivator and successfully escaping, seemingly without serious injuries. This might be due to the Xuanwu’s innate defensive abilities, but it also illustrates the power of these strong demonic beasts. Every year, news emerges of cultivators at the Pill Formation stage perishing at the hands of demonic beasts of the same realm.”</p><p>The strong man didn’t directly provide Qin Sang the information he sought, but instead launched into a lengthy discourse on demonic beasts.</p><p>Qin Sang frowned. “Fellow cultivator, why are you rambling about these well-known facts? What does this have to do with the island where the six-petaled butterfly orchid grows?”</p><p>Demonic beasts, unlike cultivators who cultivate external objects, cultivate their own bodies.  Pill formation entails a simultaneous transformation of their physical bodies and inner bloodline power, directly boosting their strength.</p><p>Post-pill formation demonic beasts are incredibly challenging to handle.  Encountering one of the same realm alone, without powerful methods, requires careful consideration.</p><p>Especially in the Demon Sea.</p><p>Before entering the Demon Sea, Ran Luo repeatedly warned them that hunting demonic beasts of the same realm is best done with several companions to avoid accidents.</p><p>Of course, Qin Sang was not to be taken lightly.  He had the assistance of the Flying Night Rakshasa, and possessed a false Pill, giving him far superior sustained combat capabilities.</p><p>The strong man chuckled.  “It's good that you understand this, Fellow Cultivator. Wu is merely afraid that you'll underestimate the situation, suffer a setback, and return to cause trouble, damaging Wu’s reputation. The island where the six-petaled butterfly orchid grows is deep within the Demon Sea; I call it Red Leaf Island. Several demonic beast groups lurk around this island. I've personally seen several large demonic beasts at the Demonic Core stage. I barely escaped with my life, and even with countless spirit medicines, I wouldn't return…”</p><p>As the strong man described Red Leaf Island, Qin Sang's expression grew increasingly serious.</p><p>The strong man's aura was no weaker than Du Han's. He was a Wu tribe cultivator, and most likely possessed a third-stage spirit insect.</p><p>No wonder he kept mentioning his near-death experiences.  The area around Red Leaf Island was indeed extremely dangerous.</p><p>“How much longer until the six-petaled butterfly orchids on the island mature?” Qin Sang pressed.</p><p>The strong man scratched his head and chuckled awkwardly. “Wu doesn't know much about spirit medicines. After returning, I asked several people to identify it; that's how I learned it's called a six-petaled butterfly orchid. However, the remaining plants are still in bud, so it probably won't be more than a few years.”</p><p>Qin Sang asked some details and silently estimated the time.</p><p>“Growing in such a place, the six-petaled butterfly orchids are impossible to collect alone, right?  If we were to invite fellow cultivators and openly clear out the demonic beasts just for a few spirit flowers, the cost would be far too high, making it unprofitable!”</p><p>Qin Sang feigned dejection. “What price are you hoping for, Fellow Cultivator Wu?”</p><p>The strong man grinned cunningly. “That depends on how you want to buy them. The locations of those spirit flowers are extremely well-hidden; otherwise, they would've been devoured by the demonic beasts long ago. Without my guidance, even if you reach Red Leaf Island, you won't find the flowers.”</p><p>Even though the information was seemingly worthless, he didn't want to give it away for free.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered for a moment, then said: “Fellow Cultivator, you’re buying talismans; surely for a junior cultivator? Talismans, while powerful, have obvious flaws: limited uses and only for emergencies. A high-quality magic weapon, on the other hand, can grow alongside a cultivator…”</p><p>With that, Qin Sang produced a spirit sword.</p><p>This sword was one of a batch he had refined incorporating Cold Gold, and the last remaining one, the others having been sold.</p><p>The Cold Gold sword was a gift for Ya Gu, and Qin Sang was currently keeping it for her.</p><p>Cold Gold was as rare as other materials in the Canglang Sea region, a rare find; this sword could easily serve as the base for a magic weapon, later refined with high-grade demonic beast bones.</p><p>“Cold Gold?”</p><p>Sensing the Cold Gold aura emanating from the spirit sword, the strong man was indeed greatly moved, and without much hesitation, agreed to the exchange.</p><p>Having obtained the location of Red Leaf Island and the six-petaled butterfly orchids, Qin Sang took his leave of the strong man and returned to the building he had initially entered; the topographical map and the auction list were already prepared.</p><p>Qin Sang first examined the list for the Grand Auction, finding nothing he urgently needed, before opening the topographical map.</p><p>From Tianwu Island to Dahuang Island is a long and winding route; each island and its surroundings along the route are unique.</p><p>The situation on each island was extremely complex.</p><p>The steward wisely withdrew. Qin Sang patiently examined the maps, island by island, until she located Duyan Island.  The information here was less detailed than what Elder Zou had given her, but it served as confirmation.</p><p>Quickly scanning, Qin Sang finally discovered a region teeming with Que Firebirds!</p><p>However, her joy soon faded.</p><p>The strongest of these Que Firebirds were only at the Yaoling stage; not a single Yaodan-stage bird was found.</p><p>This was good news.  According to Que Firebird habits, a flock only has one king, meaning there could be at most one Yaodan-stage bird in this area.</p><p>The problem was the location's remoteness.</p><p>The map showed the Que Firebirds were deep within the Demon Sea, near an island called Hutian Island.  But traveling from Hutian Island to the Que Firebird area was extremely dangerous.</p><p>Aside from the long journey, the route passed through numerous powerful妖兽 territories.</p><p>Worse, several of these妖兽 were exceptionally skilled in escape techniques.</p><p>The map warned that without the strength of a late-stage Jindan cultivator, hunting in that area was not recommended.  If a妖兽 horde were alerted, escape would be impossible.</p><p>While Qin Sang possessed the Sword Qi Thunder Sound divine ability, her speed was only comparable to a mid-stage Jindan cultivator—insufficient for that region.</p><p>“Unless I can collect all the dragon souls for the Nine Dragon Heavenly Chariot Talisman and unleash its full power,”</p><p>Qin Sang muttered to herself.</p><p>Gathering the souls of ten peak Yaoling-stage dragons was nearly impossible in Xiaohan Domain;  Qin Sang had always approached it casually.  However, it wasn't difficult in the Demon Sea.</p><p>With all the dragon souls, the Nine Dragon Heavenly Chariot Talisman's true power could be unleashed.</p><p>If Shangyuan Qingjing Palace hadn't exaggerated, Qin Sang believed that with the talisman and her Sword Qi Thunder Sound ability, even if her escape technique wasn't as good as a late-stage Jindan cultivator's, it wouldn't be far behind.</p><p>“I need to be patient for a while longer, and first establish myself on Duyan Island with Elder Zou. Duyan Island and Hutian Island aren't too far apart. After collecting the dragon souls, I will then go after the Wan Shi Chang. The Six-Petaled Butterfly Violet can wait. The Hun Yuan Tong Xin Ring is a secret treasure of the Yu Ling Sect, incredibly effective against妖兽; it will be a huge help in the Demon Sea, so the sooner I refine it, the better.”</p><p>Qin Sang made her decision, put away her things, and left the shop with the steward's respectful farewell. She then spent the rest of the day strolling around Tianwu Island.</p>
