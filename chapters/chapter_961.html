<h1>Chapter 953: Qing Jun</h1><p>After finalizing the company dividend and establishing a high-accumulation policy, Liu Yu had the bank print banknotes representing the emperor's share of the profits and the imperial treasury's income.  His countenance brightened, shedding his earlier worries, and he set off for the capital.</p><p>This time, he didn't travel by sea.  He wasn't concerned about a ship sinking and causing the emperor to worry about maritime transport; after all, he was carrying banknotes. Even if the ship sank, it wouldn't lead to legends like the sinking of a Spanish galleon – he could just print more.</p><p>He chose a classic route back to the capital: Suzhou, Yangzhou, Qinghe Ferry, crossing the Yellow River, north along the Yellow River, through Shandong, and finally to the capital.</p><p>The Grand Canal was soon to be abandoned, and he wanted to see it one last time before that happened.  His last visit to Qinghe Ferry to greet the emperor had been in early winter; now it was summer.</p><p>The weather was pleasant, a time that should have been bustling with activity, yet everywhere he looked, there was an inexplicable sense of desolation.</p><p>Before even reaching Qingjiang Port, the Huang Huai governor, who had come to greet him, looked pale.  He'd received news of Liu Yu's arrival some time ago and knew it boded ill. Liu Yu was known for his habit of wandering around and investigating the people's conditions.  Such wanderings at this particular juncture could easily get him killed.  If anything untoward happened, the governor couldn't bear the responsibility.</p><p>He inwardly grumbled,  "You're from the navy; why couldn't you just take a ship to Dagu Port? Why choose the canal route? You're just asking for trouble!"</p><p>Despite his inner discontent, he maintained a polite exterior. He summoned his trusted aides, selected seventy or eighty strong men, and instructed them to follow Liu Yu to ensure his safety.</p><p>After the pleasantries, he introduced several people Liu Yu recognized, including Liao Hanhui, who had previously boldly proposed a plan to control the Huai River and had been encouraged by the emperor with the words "May you emulate Yu the Great in your endeavors".</p><p>Among the "Xiangjun"  trained from canal workers were some of Liu Yu's former subordinates, former engineers who were now instrumental in training the Xiangjun.</p><p>The Huang Huai governor hosted a banquet, but it was held in a tent outside the city, not in Qingjiang Port.</p><p>"Lord Xing, please don't blame me for any lack of hospitality. If we held this banquet inside Qingjiang Port, we wouldn't be able to enjoy it peacefully.  'A gentleman keeps his distance from the kitchen'; knowing something is one thing, seeing it firsthand is another,"</p><p>The Huang Huai governor raised his cup, setting the tone for the welcome feast.  Several officers from the Jinghai Palace, former engineers, understood the implication.  Before anyone had taken a sip, they chimed in, "For the sake of the nation, some sacrifices must be made. Temporary hardship for lasting benefit.  My lord, please don't be disheartened."</p><p>Liu Yu laughed heartily, drained his cup, and said, "Rest assured. I initiated this, and I'm fully aware of the consequences.  Qingjiang Port's population of 800,000 might dwindle to 80,000 within three years."</p><p>"Did you think I'd be greeted with flowers and enthusiastic welcome upon my arrival at Qingjiang Port, a scene of vibrant life and flourishing prosperity?"</p><p>"My expectations were closer to Xiang Yu trapped at Gaixia, facing his inevitable demise at the Wu River."</p><p>He poured another cup, stood, and continued, "Water control isn't my forte, but abandoning the canal and focusing on maritime routes and the fate of the Southern Ocean are intrinsically linked to it.  Whether this battle becomes another Gaixia or Pengcheng rests on all of you. To our success!"</p><p>Everyone stood and drank with him.</p><p>Liao Hanhui hastily added, "My lord, rest assured.  His Majesty's trust is bestowed upon me; I shall shoulder this heavy burden. This plan to control the Huai River was my idea, my suggestion.  Though I'm humble, I have some confidence."</p><p>"The rains are heavy now.  We should wait until the weather turns cold and the water recedes, then work intensively for several months to prioritize the main channels.  We can gradually construct irrigation canals and tributaries later."</p><p>"During the Qin and Han dynasties, they were able to construct the Dujiangyan Irrigation System, the Zhengguo Canal, even conquer Lingnan and build canals.  Are we inferior to them now?"</p><p>"Let me be clear. The floods in Hongze Lake, the Huai River, and Anhui cause deaths every year.  Controlling the Huai River this year will inevitably lead to casualties and will affect hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions, of people along the canal.  But is it not better than facing the annual death toll, or even a catastrophic breach of Hongze Lake, where we might say, ‘It wasn’t me, it was the flood’?"</p><p>"I..."</p><p>Liao Hanhui noticed Liu Yu's troubled expression and thought Liu Yu felt guilty, at least toward the 800,000 people of Qinghe Port.  The abandonment of the canal would force them to migrate, ending their prosperous commerce, possibly even relegating Huai'an Prefecture to obscurity.</p><p>He didn't know that Liu Yu's resolve was unshakeable.  He'd experienced events like the Dahu Ridge trade route in Lingnan countless times; he wasn't that fragile.</p><p>Before Liao Hanhui could finish, the Huang Huai governor, fearing that Liao Hanhui's impassioned words might lead to an indiscretion, quickly interjected, laughing, "Alright, alright, this isn't a pre-battle pep talk.  When I took over Lord Xing's affairs in the Western Regions, even when suppressing the Changhui rebellion, I didn't make such passionate speeches.  It's unnecessary, truly unnecessary."</p><p>"We now have ample funds.  Xing Gong guarantees the sea transport of rice and grain will arrive on time. The Academy of Sciences has developed a highly efficient explosive; though unsuitable for warfare and somewhat dangerous, it's excellent for earthmoving."</p><p>"What the Qin, Han, Sui, and Tang dynasties could do, why can't our dynasty?  Why dwell on Xiang Yu's defeat at Gaixia? It's unnecessary."</p><p>"Do you think you're the only ones shouldering the responsibility?"</p><p>"I'm taking on this highly unpopular task. Do you realize how many ancestral graves and fields this water control project will affect? His Majesty instructed me to proceed without fear of offending anyone. But to be frank, this sort of thing…no one will openly oppose it, but how many daggers will be plunged into my back in secret?"</p><p>"Open attacks are easy to dodge, but hidden arrows are hard to guard against. We're all in this together, like grasshoppers on the same rope.  Insults?  Let them call us whatever they want."</p><p>"What's the big deal? Xing Gong, myself, and many of you here, we've all fought our way through bloody battles.  Is this something to lament over, as if making preparations for the afterlife?"</p><p>Liu Yu, somewhat numb, had reached the point where it was "too many fleas to itch."</p><p>As the saying goes, "man proposes, God disposes."  Everything that can be done has been done. Whether it succeeds this year depends on whether Heaven grants us this opportunity, and shows pity on these people who have suffered under the Huai River for centuries.</p><p>Echoing the words of the Huai-Huang Governor, Liu Yu added, "Exactly.  What's the big deal? Brother Liao, you're an expert in water control; you’re the specialist. Since you’re confident, what more could I worry about?"</p><p>"While we're at it, why not show us the water control plan? I'd like to take a look."</p><p>Liao Hanhui readily agreed.  Soon, a massive map was unfurled.</p><p>Holding a wine cup, Liao Hanhui stood before the map, truly exhibiting the bearing of a leader charting the course of a nation.</p><p>However, Liu Yu couldn't help but feel a sense of reflection.  The same iron tools, the same lack of machinery, the same people, roughly the same level of productivity.</p><p>The same engineering project, but vastly different organizational capabilities.  In later times, the Huai River's irrigation main canal, leading to the sea, would be a project undertaken at the level of a single prefecture-level city.</p><p>The same shovels, baskets, and lock system at the Qinghekou level; a prefecture-level city could mobilize the necessary resources, starting in November and finishing in May.</p><p>But now, it requires the entire nation's might, a year's entire national budget, and years without major undertakings. National resources are needed: rice from Nanyang, beans from Liaodong, iron from the Beijing area, money from Songjiang Prefecture, and even loans from the Netherlands.</p><p>The national mobilization effort barely surpasses what a prefecture-level city could accomplish in later times.</p><p>Having witnessed many large-scale projects in his past life, Liu Yu remained calm while Liao Hanhui passionately explained his plan, pointing to the map with great enthusiasm.</p><p>The planned waterway passes through areas that have seen the largest population migrations to Nanyang in recent years, especially disaster-stricken Funing.</p><p>The new canal will draw water from Gaojia Yan, pass through Huai'an and Funing before reaching the sea.</p><p>Later, a three-tiered embankment will be constructed between the Yellow River and the new canal.</p><p>According to Liao Hanhui's enthusiastic presentation, this will transform Funing and other disaster-stricken areas into fertile irrigated fields.</p><p>Of course, while the work will take place in northern Jiangsu, Anhui province will likely benefit the most.</p><p>A major cause of Huai River floods was the previous dynasty's policy of prioritizing the Grand Canal, causing the Hongze Lake to rise, hindering upstream flow, and causing floods with even slight rainfall.</p><p>The downstream was blocked.</p><p>And, without the need to protect the Grand Canal, the "protect the north, not the south" Yellow River strategy, which started in the Ming dynasty, can essentially be abandoned.</p><p>However, Liu Yu had no control over Anhui's affairs.</p><p>But from Liao Hanhui's presentation, a plan of "entrapment" gradually formed in Liu Yu's mind.</p><p>Funing was the place where the great disaster forced Liu Yu to implement the purely "throwing money" Qingmiao loan.</p><p>Since the new canal will transform it into an irrigated area, Liu Yu felt his money should not be wasted.</p><p>His Qingmiao loan had a significant influence there, being a charitable organization with a widespread network of informants.</p><p>Now that the new canal will pass through, local people will have to be mobilized.</p><p>How to conduct this "entrapment"?</p><p>Liu Yu already had a rough idea.</p><p>As Liao Hanhui spoke about the planned Funing irrigation area, he also criticized the "evil policies" of the previous and current dynasties.</p><p>"In the past, to protect the Grand Canal, during floods, water had to be drained from the fields; during droughts, when the crops were half-withered, the water for the Grand Canal couldn't be used for irrigation."</p><p>"Now that the Grand Canal is abandoned, once this new canal is built, we can drain water during floods and irrigate during droughts. That is what a river should be."</p><p>"If the new canal connecting Huai'an to Funing is completed, I estimate that at least 1.2 million mu of irrigated land can be added."</p><p>As Liao Hanhui's finger reached Funing and Sheyang, Liu Yu said, "For this section, it'll be necessary to organize the people, to conscript laborers, right? I suspect the local militia alone won't be enough."</p><p>Liao Hanhui hurriedly replied, "That's correct."</p><p>The Duke remained silent, so I will speak.  We must ask the Duke to coordinate the transport of grain and equipment by sea.</p><p>That region is a major destination for those heading south overseas these past few years, and the Duke is quite familiar with the area. Since the Green Sprout Loan program reaches every county, the grain and equipment should not be a problem.</p><p>"There are no natural disasters this year, my point is..."</p><p>He glanced at Liu Yu before finally saying, "My point is, could the departure of those peasants who owe the Duke money and are going south be delayed until next March?"</p><p>"Work begins in October. Barring unforeseen circumstances, and if the weather turns cold early without autumn rains, the project should be completed by March. I've checked, the monsoon winds haven't started by March, making it still feasible to travel south overseas."</p><p>Liu Yu smiled, "Even if they don't leave this year, it's not a big deal; it's just another 120,000 or so silver taels. But this is me overstepping my authority. The Jiangsu Jiedushi needs to issue a document for me to coordinate. Although they owe money from the Green Sprout Loan, they haven't left for the south yet; they are still people of northern Jiangsu, and I have no jurisdiction over them."</p><p>"Alright, when I return to the capital, I will report this to His Majesty.  I'll also request an additional assignment: I will take charge of logistics, supplies, and the requisition of funds and grain in the coastal regions."</p><p>Everyone was relieved by his statement.  Their greatest fear was his inaction.  Coordinating the logistics for tens of thousands of people is no small feat, especially since it relies on sea transport. An additional department to coordinate this would only complicate matters.</p><p>Everyone is in this together, each facing their own difficulties: Liu Yu has the most problems, Liao Hanhui is the most vulnerable, while the Huang Huai governor is in a powerful position but risks alienating people and incurring their wrath.  Since they can’t back out, they must do their best.</p><p>Liu Yu’s reasons for wading into this murky water are simple: fishing and law enforcement.</p><p>The money and grain intended for the conscripted laborers will be given to the local gentry.</p><p>They will "distribute" it to the laborers.</p><p>Liu Yu thought, executing everyone would inevitably lead to wrongful convictions, while executing every other person would surely let some escape.  Today, I'm giving you the opportunity to embezzle, intercept, and deduct.  If I don't kill half of the gentry in Yancheng, Fu'an and Sheyang, I’ll change my surname next year.</p><p>Moreover, there's no need to be explicit. A subtle mention to the Emperor will convey Liu Yu's intentions.</p><p>If he weren’t planning a nationwide crackdown, he would have told Liu Yu directly that this was unacceptable.  The absence of opposition is tacit approval, perhaps even prompting the advance preparation of execution squads and land surveys.</p>
