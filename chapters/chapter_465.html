<h1>Chapter 458: Sword Flight</h1><p>After leaving Observation Island, Qin Sang, his brow furrowed, flew towards his cave on his cloud.</p><p>Hearing the sound of a sword's hum behind him, Qin Sang stopped and turned to see Senior Brother Rong catching up.</p><p>"Junior Brother Qin, what are your thoughts? Are you interested in cooperating? We could agree on a meeting point after entering Sky Peak. What do you think? Or do you have another plan..."</p><p>Both of them slowed down, flying side by side.</p><p>After listening to Senior Brother Rong, Qin Sang hesitated for a moment, then slowly shook his head.</p><p>"Junior Brother also understands that one tree doesn't make a forest, but joining forces on Sky Peak is too difficult. Senior Brother also heard what Senior Xiao said.  After the restriction is opened, we'll have less than an hour to collect Star Essence Stones.</p><p>"Judging by the illusion Senior Xiao showed us, Sky Peak is towering, vast, with complex terrain and layers of restrictions.</p><p>"Sky Peak is so large, and there are only sixty-six of us, scattered all over. Unless our luck is terrible, we're unlikely to encounter any opponents.</p><p>"Senior Snake Lady's reminder was just to tell us to be prepared, to avoid being caught off guard.</p><p>"Under these circumstances, joining forces doesn't make much difference. The most important thing is the Star Essence Stones, and the real obstacles are the hidden restrictions within Sky Peak.</p><p>"After we are dispersed by the restrictions, we don't know where we will end up. Communication devices won't work inside.  Agreeing on a meeting point beforehand would waste too much time and energy, putting the cart before the horse!"</p><p>This was the reason Qin Sang had been unsure.</p><p>This Sky Peak competition wasn't simply a fight to determine who was stronger. His two magic treasures would have limited use.</p><p>Great strength was certainly essential; otherwise, he wouldn't even be able to pass the restrictions on Sky Peak. But ultimately, how many Star Essence Stones one could collect depended largely on luck.</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't opposed to cooperating with Senior Brother Rong.  From their interactions, he could see that Senior Brother Rong had a good character and cared for him as a fellow disciple, and he was also quite capable.</p><p>It was simply that the environment of Sky Peak didn't allow for it.</p><p>Senior Brother Rong had no choice but to give up on the idea of cooperation, sighing lightly, "Junior Brother Qin is right. I just discussed this with Shang Yi, and we share the same view... I can only wish Junior Brother Qin victory and that you achieve your goals."</p><p>"The same to you, Senior Brother Rong."</p><p>After exchanging a few words, they parted ways and flew towards their respective caves.</p><p>While flying on his cloud, Qin Sang assessed his own situation.</p><p>Compared to others, his advantages were his two magic treasures and the Nine Dragons Chariot Talisman. However, anyone who had reached this stage wouldn't be without their own trump cards.</p><p>Luck was predetermined, but success depended on effort.</p><p>It was a pity that Sky Peak appeared too early. It would have been better if it were two years later.</p><p>Once he reached the Pseudo Core Formation stage and could use the Ebony Sword more freely, he would be able to use the Sword Qi Thunder Sound divine ability while in Sword Unity and Sword Flight, greatly increasing his speed, far surpassing cultivators of the same realm.</p><p>This was why the Sword Qi Thunder Sound divine ability was so coveted and revered.</p><p>If he had time to return to Boundless Valley and extract the Flood Dragon's spirit, he could enhance the Nine Dragons Chariot Talisman and achieve even greater speed.</p><p>Qin Sang had a certain understanding of the strength of Core Formation cultivators. He estimated that with the combined power of Sword Qi Thunder Sound and the enhanced Nine Dragons Chariot Talisman, his speed would surpass the Foundation Establishment stage and rival early Core Formation masters.</p><p>Such speed would undoubtedly be a powerful advantage on Sky Peak.</p><p>Having missed the opportunity, Qin Sang couldn't do anything about it.  Since stepping onto the path of immortality, he had never relaxed for a moment. If he couldn't catch up, he couldn't catch up.</p><p>Qin Sang sighed inwardly, pushing aside these useless thoughts. He landed in front of his cave and habitually checked the restrictions he had left outside, finding everything normal.</p><p>He opened the restriction and pushed the door open.</p><p>Sitting cross-legged on the meditation mat, he activated the spirit gathering array.</p><p>Just as Qin Sang was about to enter meditative cultivation, he suddenly sensed something unusual in the cave.</p><p>Immediately afterward, his expression changed drastically. He abruptly turned his head, glaring at a corner of the cave.</p><p>"Who's there!"</p><p>At the same time, Qin Sang sprang to his feet, flashing to the cave entrance. His hand quickly swept across his waist, and the Cold Gold Sword and Yin-Yang Compass instantly flew into his palms. The Ebony Sword in his Nascent Soul was also ready to be unleashed.</p><p>Qin Sang stared intently at the shadow in the corner of the cave, his entire body drenched in cold sweat. Even on the bloodiest battlefields, he had never been so terrified.</p><p>There was a dark figure in the shadowy corner, clearly human-shaped.</p><p>His cave had been silently invaded!</p><p>The restrictions he had meticulously set up showed no signs of being broken, as if they were mere decorations!</p><p>Who was it?</p><p>Or was it some kind of monster?</p><p>Qin Sang's back pressed against the stone door, the coolness of the stone seeping into him.  With a little force, he could break through the door and escape, but he didn't dare to move.</p><p>He could feel a faint, almost imperceptible divine sense locked onto him.</p><p>This divine sense seemed to hold no malice, but Qin Sang didn't dare to act rashly.</p><p>His cave was some distance from Observation Island, and the cultivators on the surrounding islands were weaker than him.  If he couldn't defeat this intruder, the others wouldn't stand a chance either.</p><p>This was the Chaotic Islands, protected by the True Water Mirage Array.</p><p>Anyone who could silently infiltrate this place must possess unimaginable power. A rash move would only provoke the shadowy figure, and he might be killed before any help arrived.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't help but wonder if his magic treasures had been exposed...</p><p>It was best to stabilize the situation first.</p><p>His mind was in turmoil, but he forced himself to calm down. His thoughts raced, and he surprisingly spoke first, "Who are you? I rarely make enemies. If..."</p><p>Mid-sentence, Qin Sang saw the shadowy figure slowly emerge from the darkness, revealing an aged face. His expression froze, his voice faltering, and a look of astonishment appeared on his face.</p><p>"Grandmother Jing? Is that you!"</p><p>Qin Sang exclaimed softly as he recognized the old woman's face.</p><p>The old woman before him was thin and frail, hunched over with age, her face deeply wrinkled.  It was Grandmother Jing, the owner of the secret shop in Moonlit Marketplace.</p><p>It was uncommon to see cultivators above the Foundation Establishment stage as old as Grandmother Jing.</p><p>Unless their lifespan was nearing its end and their vital essence was depleted.</p><p>But when Qin Sang first met her in Moonlit Marketplace, she had looked like this, and now, seventy years later, her appearance hadn't changed at all.</p><p>Moreover, back then, Qin Sang had just recently broken through to the Foundation Establishment stage and felt that Grandmother Jing was unfathomable, completely beyond his comprehension.</p><p>Now, he was nearing the Pseudo Core Formation stage, and she still felt the same.</p><p>To Qin Sang, Grandmother Jing's aura was like a deep spring, profound and mysterious.</p><p>Qin Sang had only sensed this feeling from Core Formation cultivators.</p><p>"It's good that Fellow Daoist Qin still remembers this old woman."</p><p>Grandmother Jing nodded slightly, the wrinkles on her face bunching together in an awkward smile.</p><p>"How could this junior forget the help Senior provided me back then?"</p><p>Qin Sang gave a dry laugh, outwardly relaxing and putting away the Cold Gold Sword and Yin-Yang Compass. However, the Ebony Sword in his Nascent Soul remained poised.</p><p>There was a reason for this.</p><p>Grandmother Jing had disappeared for so long, and now she had suddenly appeared, infiltrating his cave.</p><p>It was simply too abnormal.</p><p>Grandmother Jing had a good reputation in Moonlit Marketplace, and Qin Sang admired her, but that didn't mean it was still the case seventy years later.</p>
