<h1>Chapter 1667 The Demon Servant</h1><p>In a mountain valley.</p><p>The silver glow on the stone tablet grew dimmer, its sealing power weakening.</p><p>The Demon Lord’s screams turned into maniacal laughter.</p><p>Imprisoned beneath the tablet for countless years, he was finally free.</p><p>His voice echoed far and wide, a sound of utter exhilaration.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The stone tablet shook.</p><p>The seal was breached, revealing a crack in the center of the tablet.  It didn’t shatter, but slowly began to mend.</p><p>A bizarre sight emerged from beneath the tablet.</p><p>A mass of dark energy morphed into a grotesque face, sometimes laughing wildly, sometimes contorting in a terrifying grimace. The face was bound by chains.</p><p>The chains clattered, their luster fading, as if about to break.</p><p>“The secret technique you promised us…”</p><p>The three alliance leaders shouted urgently, preparing to intervene.</p><p>The Demon Lord, without a word, shot three beams of light towards them, while simultaneously using the dark energy to seize Su Nu, who offered no resistance.</p><p>The three caught the beams of light, sensing a strange secret technique within.</p><p>“It’s real!”</p><p>The Xi You Alliance Leader quickly verified its authenticity. The restless True Energy within him calmed instantly upon activating the technique; the bottleneck in his cultivation even showed signs of loosening. He was overjoyed.</p><p>‘Clang!’</p><p>The Demon Lord, chains still attached, burst from the stone tablet and entered Su Nu’s body through her forehead.</p><p>Su Nu’s face was filled with terror. Her eyes rolled back, her expression freezing before contorting in excruciating pain. Chains, identical to those binding the Demon Lord, appeared on her body.</p><p>“Attack!”</p><p>The three alliance leaders exchanged a fierce glance and bellowed in unison!</p><p>A ring-shaped restriction appeared around Su Nu’s waist, and a void-like sword energy erupted from her wrist.</p><p>A shocking scene unfolded.</p><p>The ring-shaped restriction set by the Bei Chen Alliance Leader tightened rapidly.  The sword energy left by the Dong Ji Alliance Leader, instead of striking Su Nu, veered, slashing viciously at the Bei Chen Alliance Leader’s restriction.</p><p>“You…”</p><p>The Bei Chen Alliance Leader glared at the Dong Ji Alliance Leader, instantly understanding the betrayal. Without looking at the Demon Lord, he retreated swiftly.</p><p>At that moment, he heard the sound of chains.</p><p>“No!”</p><p>A premonition of danger filled the Bei Chen Alliance Leader's heart. He spat out a beam of light.</p><p>A fiery red long dao expanded rapidly, slashing towards his side, but missed.  Simultaneously, a chilling pain shot through his abdomen.</p><p>He had been injured by a flying sword.</p><p>The Bei Chen Alliance Leader recognized the sword instantly—the Dong Ji Alliance Leader's life-bound spiritual sword!</p><p>The Dong Ji Alliance Leader coldly watched his former companion, his expression devoid of emotion, as if attacking a stranger.</p><p>‘Pff!’</p><p>A slender jade hand pierced through the Bei Chen Alliance Leader's chest from behind.  A still-beating, blood-soaked heart was clutched in the hand, shockingly crimson.</p><p>The hand holding the heart belonged to Su Nu, possessed by the Demon Lord.</p><p>She showed no trace of her former gentleness, her hands stained with blood, her eyes filled with greed and madness; she was a completely different person.</p><p>The chain markings on her skin grew more prominent, yet she was able to move freely, having escaped the tablet's confines, to assassinate the Bei Chen Alliance Leader.</p><p>The Bei Chen Alliance Leader's eyes lost their light.</p><p>The next moment, his Nascent Soul leaped from his skull, looking around in bewilderment, desperately fleeing towards the valley exit.  But his opponent was prepared, the Dong Ji Alliance Leader's life-bound spiritual sword waiting there.</p><p>Countless dazzling sword lights formed a powerful sword array in the void, the sword intent overwhelming, engulfing the Nascent Soul.</p><p>The Nascent Soul was startled. It flickered and instantly appeared far away, escaping the sword array.</p><p>This wasn’t due to the Bei Chen Alliance Leader's speed, but a natural, powerful ability inherent to Nascent Souls upon their separation from the body.</p><p>However, using this ability each time came at a great cost, leading to severe depletion of energy; thus, cultivators only resorted to it in the direst of situations.</p><p>Therefore, it was known as the strongest escape technique.</p><p>In this crisis, the Bei Chen Alliance Leader had no other choice.</p><p>The Nascent Soul teleported, charging towards the valley exit without hesitation. Yet, before it could take a step, Su Nu's alluring face appeared before it.</p><p>As if anticipating the Nascent Soul's teleportation, the Demon Lord was waiting there. A jade hand reached out, imbued with powerful restrictive force.</p><p>The Nascent Soul's face turned ashen. It was helpless, captured by the Demon Lord's grasp.</p><p>Then, the Demon Lord vanished, blocking the valley exit, cutting off the Xi You Alliance Leader's escape route, and thrusting the Bei Chen Alliance Leader's Nascent Soul into his mouth.</p><p>The Demon Lord chewed on the Nascent Soul, a look of ecstasy on his face, as if savoring a delicacy.</p><p>“Interesting…”</p><p>The Demon Lord looked at the Xi You Alliance Leader, a sly smile on his face.</p><p>A moment ago, the three leaders of the Merchant Alliances attacked together.  However, the Xi You leader showed no intention of fighting, nor did she activate the restrictions on Su Nu.  She fled without looking back.</p><p>If not for their superior strength and swift action in defeating the Bei Chen leader—and the terrifying speed of the Demon Lord—they might not have been able to stop her.</p><p>The Xi You leader’s teeth clenched, her eyes wide with fear as she slowly backed away.  Witnessing the Demon Lord devour a Nascent Soul, her face turned pale, her eyes filled with terror.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>A sound pierced the air from behind. The Dong Ji leader blocked her escape route, staring at her impassively.</p><p>“Traitor! You’ve allied yourself with a demon!”</p><p>The Xi You leader backed against a rock wall, shouting angrily.</p><p>The Dong Ji leader remained unmoved, coldly replying,  “The Bai Li family has served the Demon Lord for generations!”</p><p>“Heh heh…”</p><p>The Demon Lord chuckled menacingly, “It wasn’t betrayal.  I secretly implanted a demonic curse on him years ago, turning him into my servant. He has been utterly loyal. If I hadn’t been sealed and suppressed back then, lacking sufficient power to deal with more than one of you at once, all of you would have fallen under my control.  Alas, once he reached the late Nascent Soul stage, he might have broken free from the curse. So I treated him equally in cultivation to keep him hidden among you.”</p><p>The Xi You leader showed no surprise, a cold smile playing on her lips. “I’ve known those two were unreliable for a long time!”</p><p>“Huh?”</p><p>The Demon Lord was taken aback.</p><p>The Xi You leader turned towards the mountain pass, shouting, “Aren't you going to make your move? How long do you intend to wait?”</p><p>“Heh heh, I’ve been waiting outside, but the situation changed so rapidly, I hadn’t even reacted before Qing Yun was already at a disadvantage... no wonder he dares to call himself the Demon Lord!”</p><p>In the stone forest,</p><p>a swirling mist parted to reveal a figure slowly emerging—the Demon Master.</p><p>The Demon Master approached, his pace deceptively slow yet swift, appearing at the mountain pass entrance.  Facing the Demon Lord, his expression remained calm and composed.  His gaze swept over the scene, landing on the Bei Chen leader's corpse without flinching.</p><p>“Late Nascent Soul?”</p><p>The Demon Lord paused, his eyes narrowing slightly.</p><p>The Dong Chen leader’s lips moved, secretly transmitting a message.</p><p>Seeing only the Demon Master appear, the Xi You leader's heart sank.  She angrily demanded,  “Why didn’t you save Ji?”</p><p>The Demon Lord was too powerful; just the two of them couldn't possibly subdue him! The Demon Master certainly had the ability to save the Bei Chen leader, but he hadn't acted.</p><p>“No need to rush,”</p><p>the Demon Master said calmly, “Reinforcements are arriving soon. Besides, don't you have a hidden advantage?”</p>
