<h1>Chapter 1826: The Great Vajra Wheel Seal</h1><p>A clear mind, severed spiritual energy.</p><p>This was one of Qin Sang's greatest achievements in comprehending the legacy of the Chengying Sword.</p><p>Part of the credit goes to the True Person of the Sword.</p><p>Over several decades, Qin Sang repeatedly traveled between Jushan and the Evil Origin, visiting the True Person of the Sword each time.</p><p>While it was ostensibly a discussion of Dao, it was largely Qin Sang seeking guidance.</p><p>The True Person of the Sword was a rare and enlightened master. He hadn't inherited the Chengying Sword, but his understanding of the sword Dao was profound.</p><p>He wouldn't dictate Qin Sang's direction, his words were concise and to the point, revealing the true meaning, allowing Qin Sang to corroborate the Chengying Sword legacy and forge his own path.</p><p>Qin Sang was like a student, receiving a teacher's guidance, then returning to seclusion for diligent cultivation, accumulating new questions before returning for further instruction.</p><p>Therefore, even though Qin Sang hadn't devoted all his energy to the Chengying Sword over the years, his progress was still evident.</p><p>The same killing formation, the same white tiger specter—compared to thirty years ago, Qin Sang's current use of it showed a clear difference in power, and this was not solely due to improved cultivation.</p><p>Qin Sang named this newly comprehended sword technique "Sword Originates from the Heart Sea."</p><p>Maintaining a calm heart allows one to sense nearby killing intent.</p><p>The Green Fox Saint King, ambushed by him, could not possibly have been composed. Once locked onto by his heart, even if using secret techniques to escape, he couldn't evade the sword intent.  Where Qin Sang's heart reached, his sword intent followed, striking to kill.</p><p>Before the battle, the Sky-Eyed Butterfly discovered a special mark left by the Green Fox Saint King outside the palace.</p><p>After all, he was dealing with a late Nascent Soul cultivator; it was highly likely the Green Fox Saint King would leave a contingency plan.</p><p>Qin Sang's move was a gamble, but he had a certain degree of confidence. If successful, the benefits would be immense.</p><p>The Chengying Sword legacy, the guidance of the True Person of the Sword, and his previous understanding of the Dao of Killing had opened the true door of the sword Dao for Qin Sang.</p><p>Before, although he considered himself a seasoned swordsman, he was actually still at the level of "technique." This sword technique barely touched the threshold of "Dao."</p><p>In Qin Sang's heart, his impression of the True Person of the Sword rose again and again. Perhaps his realm wasn't high enough, but in terms of understanding the sword Dao, he had yet to see his equal, and he certainly would not stop there.</p><p>Qin Sang envied this talent without jealousy, eagerly anticipating the achievements of this fellow cultivator, yet couldn't help but feel pity for Elder Qingzhu.</p><p>Why the True Person of the Sword meticulously guided him, Qin Sang didn't understand.</p><p>Perhaps it was a casual act of kindness, effortless beneficence, a great Dao for Qin Sang, while for him it was just a casual remark.</p><p>Perhaps it was due to their connection from years ago, their kindred spirits.</p><p>Perhaps there was ulterior motive.</p><p>Since ancient times, actions speak louder than words. Qin Sang hoped it was the former. If the True Person of the Sword had other intentions, as long as they weren't detrimental to him, he would repay him with all his strength.</p><p>Fortunately, he obtained the poison technique and the flower field, his cultivation advancing by leaps and bounds, giving him the ability to repay kindness.</p><p>Sheathing his sword.</p><p>Clenching his fist.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes narrowed slightly, his phoenix wings flapping violently, his figure instantly transforming into a lightning bolt, a thunderous shock!</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>Electric light illuminated the great hall, instantly reaching the front of the well platform, abruptly colliding with a faint deer shadow.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>A heavy punch slammed out.</p><p>The deer shadow countered with its antlers.</p><p>Both figures shuddered violently, separating on contact, each retreating.</p><p>Qin Sang landed in the air, only three meters from the well platform, forcibly stopping, coldly looking at the demon below, issuing a chilling question: "You want to contend with this cultivator for this treasure?"</p><p>Xia Hou, whose black deer form had manifested, landed with a ‘bang,’ his four hooves heavily striking the ground, causing the palace to tremble.</p><p>Mo Xingdao had slain the demon soldiers and escaped the battlefield; only Qin Sang and Xia Hou remained within the palace.</p><p>Xia Hou slightly raised his head, narrowing his demon eyes, emitting a disdainful snort, but a flash of surprise and alertness flickered in his eyes.</p><p>Earlier, Qin Sang's sudden entry into the battle startled Xia Hou. Initially, he thought it was a helper ambushed by the Green Fox Saint King.</p><p>But seeing Qin Sang directly attack the Green Fox Saint King, with what seemed like deep hatred, attacking mercilessly, he immediately changed his mind, quietly approaching the Five Elements Crown after escaping, intending to seize the treasure in the chaos.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the Green Fox Saint King fell so quickly.  After all, the cultivation Qin Sang displayed wasn't high; even with a surprise attack, the Green Fox Saint King shouldn't have been unable to hold his own, at least for a while.</p><p>Only after this strike did he understand that the Green Fox Saint King's defeat was by no means accidental.</p><p>"Who are you!"</p><p>Xia Hou took a closer look at Qin Sang, feeling strangely uneasy.</p><p>His skin was as rough as tree bark, like a wood spirit.  His body was translucent, like a jade monster. His whole body was covered in green fur, surrounded by poisonous smoke, like a poisonous creature who had achieved enlightenment, yet he also possessed a pair of phoenix wings.</p><p>This pair of wings strongly resembles the legendary Azure Luan's wings.  Having seen a picture of the ancient beast at the Prince's Manor, Qin Sang's wings could almost be mistaken for the real thing. None of those who claim descent from phoenixes possess wings so similar.</p><p>Xia Hou was perplexed.  Since they weren't the Green Fox's allies, and didn't resemble Daoist cultivators, even scouring Gui Fang's monsters couldn't reveal the source of this creature.  Where did the Green Fox encounter such a being?</p><p>Qin Sang didn't bother with pleasantries.  Stopping his retreat, he charged forward.  He was wearing his Huifeng armor and gauntlets, but under the glow of the glazed light, they appeared almost transparent.</p><p>His four-serpent seal, Nine Netherworld fire, were all sheathed, even the Gray Warbler sword was only for a flanking maneuver. He intended to rely solely on his physical strength and the Wood Spirit body to directly confront Xia Hou!</p><p>His spiritual sense was limited, and his true essence was only at the early stage of transformation, requiring careful calculation.  His confidence stemmed from the "Seven Master Buddha Seal," now more accurately called the Great Vajra Wheel Seal!</p><p>His battles against the Green Fox King and Xia Hou had given him immense confidence.  Today, he finally achieved the unification of the seven seals, comprehending this ultimate seal.</p><p>As he suspected, the "Seven Master Buddha Seal" was a disassembled version of the Great Vajra Wheel Seal.  Some unknown master had split this powerful Buddha seal into seven, making its comprehension more accessible.</p><p>Among all the Dao techniques and supernatural powers Qin Sang possessed, cultivating this seal was the most straightforward.</p><p>Using the Great Vajra Wheel Seal, he transformed into a Vajra Glass Body, his body like pure glass.  His physical strength reaching the transformation stage, his primordial essence circulated within his body, drawing heavenly energy inward, faintly forming the rudiments of an inner world.  His body transformed into glass, his inner world stabilized, making each movement and strike exceptionally potent.</p><p>This cultivation method wasn't without drawbacks. Qin Sang vaguely sensed that the Great Vajra Wheel Seal was vast and profound, with different understandings for each person.  His use of the seal differed from the monk in the image he'd seen.</p><p>After understanding the Great Vajra Wheel Seal, Qin Sang discovered that his Inner Lion Seal also received a boost.  The Inner Lion Seal specialized in healing and recovery, while the Great Vajra Wheel Seal provided an overall enhancement.</p><p>He wondered about the power of the other seven seals. He cautiously guessed that they would likely have similar specializations to the Inner Lion Seal.  Based on this deduction, the Great Vajra Wheel Seal was probably the foundational seal of the Nine Great Luminous Seals!</p><p>Those with exceptional talent would reap greater rewards by self-cultivation, perhaps even using it to comprehend the Buddhist Vajra path.  Qin Sang, however, was merely following precedent, not his own understanding.</p><p>Still, physical strength wasn't Qin Sang's core strength. The Great Vajra Wheel Seal's power was so overwhelming that he was satisfied.</p><p>Qin Sang advanced with a step-void movement, forgoing thunder escape to display his overwhelming momentum, suppressing the surroundings.</p><p>Xia Hou's pupils constricted slightly, glancing at the Five Elements Crown on the well platform.  Observing the Green Fox King's previous cautious actions, they could guess that this treasure was not easy to obtain, and the slightest misstep could invite unbearable backlash.</p><p>Neither he nor Qin Sang dared to rashly take the treasure, even trying to avoid provoking the spirit, lest it become an enemy’s accomplice.  The situation came down to who was stronger, to repel or even kill the opponent!</p><p>Qin Sang displayed unwavering confidence, and Xia Hou was no less determined.  Transforming into a black deer, its strength fully restored. Its head slightly lowered, black light burst from the tips of its antlers, black energy surging, repeating its old trick, preparing to condense a vortex.</p><p>A gust of wind arose, black energy howled. Before Qin Sang, black clouds gathered, obscuring the sky.  The black energy threatened to engulf him, gradually forming a vortex at its center.</p><p>At that moment, a streak of light shot into the vortex's center.  This light was extraordinarily slender, originating from Qin Sang's dantian, the Heavenly Eye Butterfly's Heavenly Eye Divine Light.</p><p>This divine light was capable of breaking through magical defenses, and had been ready since the encounter with the Green Fox King, but hadn't been used until now.</p><p>Compared to the black energy, the Heavenly Eye Divine Light was so weak, but the instant it pierced the vortex, the black energy vortex burst apart.  With a deafening boom, the momentum of the black energy was severely weakened.</p><p>Xia Hou watched in astonishment as Qin Sang broke through the black energy and swiftly closed in with thunder escape, retreating in panic.  In haste, it opened its mouth, spewing crimson breath that transformed into red lightning, striking towards Qin Sang's face.</p><p>Qin Sang felt a flash of crimson, a fierce wind hitting his face.  Coldly snorting, he twisted his right arm, smashing his heavy fist into the lightning.</p><p>A violent clap of thunder accompanied the blow, landing squarely on the crimson lightning. The lightning solidified, then shattered piece by piece.  Qin Sang's momentum remained fierce as he pressed forward.</p><p>Xia Hou had witnessed the fate of the Qinghu Saint King firsthand and was not unprepared.  He had secretly activated his divine ability, and Qin Sang's deliberate attack was, in turn, his opportunity!</p><p>A brilliant light surged from Xia Hou's back.  A shimmering deer, black and white, leaped into the air, its hooves slamming down with tremendous force.</p><p>Qin Sang felt an incredible pressure bearing down, enveloped by shadow.  Above him, a gigantic deer leg smashed through the void!  An ordinary person would have been crushed to pulp.</p><p>Qin Sang looked up slightly. His expression was obscured by the shadows, his gaze deep. He raised both fists and struck at the deer's leg.</p><p>With this blow, a tremor ran through his arms and his entire body, like thunder and the shattering of jade.  At the tips of his fists, the air seemed to warp, a manifestation of immense power – seemingly both impossibly strong and as soft as water, a perfect blend of hardness and softness.</p><p>Fist met leg.</p><p>A burst of black light erupted. Qin Sang was sent crashing to the ground, but his stance remained firm as he took three steps back. The deer leg, still carrying its force, landed heavily before him, then dissipated, failing to inflict any damage.</p><p>"Hiss!"</p><p>Xia Hou's face showed shock. He hadn't expected Qin Sang to react so easily. This divine ability was his masterpiece.  The deer phantom he had manifested wasn't a true Dharma form, yet this attack, imbued with his own understanding of the heavens, contained celestial might, the strongest aspect of this ability.</p><p>Those of inferior cultivation faced the oppressive weight of the heavens, inherently at a disadvantage.  Qin Sang was strong, but Xia Hou had seen through him – he relied on his Dao techniques and external objects.  The disparity in their understanding of heavenly power was difficult to overcome with Dao techniques. Had the attack of the Five Elements Crown not been so overwhelming, he wouldn't have been so passive against Qinghu, forced to use his ultimate ability.</p><p>Yet Qin Sang was completely unaffected, the power of his fists showing no signs of being suppressed. Xia Hou looked at him strangely; the lack of celestial suppression effectively nullified the largest gap between their realms.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>Qin Sang launched another attack, his eyes flashing with excitement born from his understanding of the killing Dao. The exhilaration of slaying the Qinghu Saint King far surpassed the thrill of hunting beasts.</p><p>Enemies, all slain!</p><p>Those vying for opportunities, also slain!</p><p>Qin Sang understood. Before him, the figure of the creator of the "Chapter of Soul Cultivation through Swords" seemed to appear. That person emerged from mountains of corpses and seas of blood, awakening from endless slaughter, later curbing their bloodlust, sheathing their sword, drawing it only for cause.  Once drawn, regardless of the enemy's strength, they would fearlessly press forward.</p><p>One battle to sever karmic ties!</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes burned brighter, he let out a rare, long howl, his momentum unstoppable.</p><p>The black deer hesitated, feeling strangely suppressed by Qin Sang.  It snorted angrily, "Relying on a single divine ability to run rampant, I'll see how long you can fight!"</p><p>It saw that Qin Sang was not simply a cultivator of physical strength. The black fire was ordinary; the spiritual treasures and the sword array could threaten it, but limited by Qin Sang's cultivation, they were inferior to the Great Vajra Wheel Seal.</p><p>This was Qin Sang's reliance, but such a powerful divine ability must be extremely draining. Qin Sang's vital energy wouldn't last as long as his!</p><p>With a snort, Xia Hou charged at Qin Sang, leaving behind afterimages in the air, its antlers like swords piercing towards Qin Sang's head.</p><p>Although Xia Hou was a deer, it made no difference to Qin Sang.  Excitement mingled with composure. He shifted a fragment of the treasure into his palm, pressing against the antlers, his body shuddering from the impact.</p><p>In an instant, the man and the deer were locked in close combat, two cultivators at the Transcendence stage engaged in a brutal melee.</p><p>In the vast hall, the Five Elements Crown floated quietly above the well, a silent witness. A mass of dark light moved continuously within the hall, revealing only flickering shadows, their true forms indistinguishable.</p><p>The battle continued, with no clear victor.</p><p>Qin Sang seemed to be running out of options, with no stronger techniques left. Xia Hou also seemed to be focusing on wearing down Qin Sang, or perhaps wary of the Celestial Eye Divine Light, rarely employing his divine abilities.</p><p>Just as the battle reached a stalemate, Xia Hou's eyes flickered.  Without warning, its two antlers detached, instantly merging into one, resembling a fan with numerous holes, which it aimed at Qin Sang with a powerful swipe.</p><p>The attack was sudden.</p><p>Even when ambushing Hong Yuzi and being ambushed by the Qinghu Saint King, he hadn't used it.</p><p>The wind howled, forming pillars of air around Qin Sang, instantly casting him in shadow and subjecting him to immense binding force. The five points of the antlers flashed coldly, shooting out five crescent-shaped blades of light like razor-sharp blades.</p><p>In a flash, the crescent blades crisscrossed. Each blade was like a spatial fissure.  Even if the treasure fragment could withstand one, it couldn't withstand five.</p><p>Xia Hou had clearly been lulling Qin Sang into a false sense of security.  Its eyes gleamed with malice, and it licked its lips, but suddenly froze.</p><p>A clear phoenix cry echoed from within the wind pillar.</p><p>A blue-green phoenix spread its wings, ignoring the wind pillar. As its feathers stirred, it exuded an aura that immediately reminded Xia Hou of the phoenix from the residual image.</p><p>The blue-green phoenix spread its wings wide, then dove, turning into a streak of blue light aimed at Qin Sang.</p><p>The next moment, within the wind pillar, an immensely powerful aura erupted! </p>
