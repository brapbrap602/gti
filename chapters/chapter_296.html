<h1>**Chapter 289: Ambush**</h1><p>As they were about to exit the tunnel, the group spotted the surrounding terrain. They were on a steep and towering cliff, separated from the savanna below by a narrow chasm.</p><p>"Conceal yourself! Hold your breath!"</p><p>Yu Kong whispered. He cast his Stealth spell, floating silently towards the ground.</p><p>Qin Sang scanned the area, eyeing the chasm.</p><p>Although not particularly wide, the chasm seemed bottomless. The Yin Qi was even denser than the Yin Specter Abyss, but it was less turbulent.</p><p>As they neared the chasm, Yu Kong abruptly stopped and gently pushed the two corpses forward.</p><p>They drifted towards opposite ends of the chasm, slowly descending along the edge, disappearing inch by inch.</p><p>As they fell, the runes Yu Kong drew on them flickered. The corpses eventually vanished, leaving no trace, including their auras.</p><p>Qin Sang released a strand of Divine Sense, scanning where they had disappeared. He detected nothing unusual.</p><p>Yu Kong moved with great caution, as if worried about startling something in the chasm. After concealing the corpses, he sighed in relief.</p><p>"Follow me," he transmitted. Instead of crossing the chasm, he led the group to a concealed position on the edge.</p><p>Though eager for the herbs, the group realized from Yu Kong's actions that the chasm held an unknown danger. They suppressed their impatience and stayed concealed.</p><p>Still not satisfied, Yu Kong drew similar runes around the group.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't decipher the trap he had set for Luo Xingnan and Sheng Yuanzi, but he knew they couldn't wait. If they didn't act now, Yun Youzi and Ge Yuan wouldn't have a chance to escape. He crushed the Harmony Pendant.</p><p>They waited, but no one emerged from the tunnel. Yu Kong remained calm.</p><p>Time passed.</p><p>Finally, a figure appeared at the entrance, followed by several others.</p><p>Luo Xingnan and Sheng Yuanzi led the group.</p><p>They had arrived together.</p><p>Their followers stood in separate formations behind them.</p><p>Qin Sang spotted Yun Youzi and Ge Yuan. He furrowed his brow. When he crushed the Harmony Pendant, he had warned them of the possible danger in the chasm, where Luo Xingnan and Sheng Yuanzi faced certain peril. But they had not seized the opportunity to escape.</p><p>With no way to communicate, Qin Sang couldn't tell if they had failed to leave or had other plans.</p><p>Unfazed by their arrival, Yu Kong said, "They're both here. This will be less troublesome."</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at the chasm.</p><p>Its depth likely concealed dangers beyond his comprehension, giving Yu Kong the confidence to eliminate Luo Xingnan and Sheng Yuanzi.</p><p>Unfortunately, he could no longer send messages through the Harmony Pendant to warn Yun Youzi and Ge Yuan. He could only hope for their safety.</p><p>If they died, he would have to rethink his plans. He had no qualms with Yu Kong, and he preferred a mutually beneficial outcome.</p><p>Even if Yu Kong plotted against him, he would not target him. Qin Sang's treasures were far more impressive than those of loose cultivators, compensating for some of the gap between them. With enough caution, he could find an opportunity to escape.</p><p>He even saw a chance to counterattack at the right moment.</p><p>Only Yan Wu troubled him, filling him with unease whenever he looked his way.</p><p>Qin Sang remained still, observing the approaching figures above.</p><p>The two groups stood at the entrance, gazing at the distant mountain.</p><p>――――</p><p>"Where is that Yu geezers?"</p><p>Sheng Yuanzi scanned the area, finding no one in the clearing or the cloud-covered mountains.</p><p>Staring in fascination, Luo Xingnan muttered, "Shao Chunhui has truly found a treasure trove! This must be the cave master's herbal garden. These herbs are at least a thousand years old, gleaming like the sun! That old dog is probably already up the mountain. We should move before he ruins it."</p><p>"Sheng Yuanzi glanced at Luo Xingnan. 'Since Shao Chunhui came back empty-handed last time, it shows that the restrictions in that smog are not simple. It is a good time to let that old demon Yu help us scout the way first. Why are you in such a hurry? Since we have confirmed that this is the handiwork of that old demon Yu, shouldn't you call back the people you planted beside me?'</p><p>"Since it couldn't be confirmed whether it was you or that old dog Yu, it was natural for me to prepare for both possibilities."</p><p>Being criticized outright, Luo Xingnan looked completely shameless and withdrew his obsessed stare. He waved his hand at a thin and shriveled old man behind Sheng Yuanzi. "Fellow Daoist Gong, come back."</p><p>The old man by the surname Gong took a step forward and cupped his hands towards Sheng Yuanzi. "Each man fights for his own master. I hope the Celestial Master will excuse me."</p><p>"Indeed it's you! Do you really think I dare not kill you?"</p><p>Sheng Yuanzi gave a cold hum, his gaze pressing and his killing intent obvious.</p><p>Under the pressuring aura of Sheng Yuanzi, the old man by the surname Gong trembled, and his face turned slightly pale.</p><p>Luo Xingnan took a step forward, helping the old man by the surname Gong block Sheng Yuanzi's aura. He said indifferently, "Tit for tat! Old Brahman, since we have decided to join hands against that old dog Yu, it is meaningless to haggle over such trifles as this. After killing that old dog Yu and getting the elixir, we shall each go our separate ways on the road to the Great Dao. I only wait until I have formed my Golden Core to burn an incense stick for your ashes upon my return. Before that, I have no interest in continuing to scheme against you. Furthermore... much less to say that I don't have any of your men around me."</p><p>"You want to form your Golden Core? In your next life perhaps!"</p><p>Sheng Yuanzi had a look of disdain as he pointed to a man dressed in a long robe behind Luo Xingnan. "Fellow Daoist Chen, don't worry. I guarantee that that old ghost Luo will not dare to lay a hand on you again in the future."</p><p>The man in the long robe only said, "I only hope that Senior will remember his promise."</p><p>Sheng Yuanzi gave a cold laugh and swept his gaze over the crowd behind him. He pointed at the distant mountains and said, "Look at the brilliance on those mountains. The elixirs there will be more than enough for us to take one each. However, the prerequisite is that we are able to break the restrictions and get rid of that old demon Yu, so I need everyone to give it your all. But if anyone tries to fool me, don't blame me for being merciless."</p><p>Luo Xingnan's words were to the same effect.</p><p>After warning everyone else, Luo Xingnan and Sheng Yuanzi discussed some things and then led everyone to swoop down the cliff.</p><p>"Hold on..."</p><p>Just when they were about to leap over the abyss, Sheng Yuanzi paused and motioned for everyone to stop.</p><p>Luo Xingnan asked with a frown, "Did your men leave secret marks?"</p><p>Sheng Yuanzi stared at the abyss and shook his head. "Not so..."</p><p>Luo Xingnan scoffed, "The more you live, the more regressed you become, old Brahman. It's just a small ditch. Can it scare you to this extent? If there were any danger, there would definitely be traces of fighting here."</p><p>Chapter 289: Convergence</p><p>As they were about to exit the cave, everyone saw the scene ahead. The cave was located on a steep and towering cliff, with a deep chasm separating the cliff base from the plains below.</p><p>"Conceal yourselves! Hold your breath!"</p><p>Yu Kong reminded them sternly, then activated his concealment technique, silently drifting down towards the bottom of the cliff.</p><p>Qin Sang surveyed the surroundings, gazing down into the abyss.</p><p>The chasm wasn't particularly wide, but it was bottomless, even more sinister than the Yin Sha Abyss of the Kui Yin Sect.  It was shrouded in Yin energy, though much calmer than the Yin Sha Abyss.</p><p>As they neared the chasm, Yu Kong paused, gently pushing two corpses forward.</p><p>The bodies drifted to either side, slowly falling into the abyss.  They clung to the edge, descending inch by inch.</p><p>During their descent, the patterns Yu Kong had drawn on the corpses flickered, and then the bodies vanished completely from sight, their auras also masked.</p><p>Qin Sang discreetly extended a wisp of divine sense, sweeping over the spot where the corpses had disappeared, but found nothing unusual.</p><p>Yu Kong seemed to be exceptionally cautious, as if afraid of disturbing something within the abyss.  Only after the bodies were hidden did he breathe a sigh of relief.</p><p>"Follow me…"</p><p>Yu Kong's voice transmitted, but instead of flying directly across the chasm to gather the spirit herbs, he led everyone to a hidden spot along the edge.</p><p>Though eager for the spirit herbs, everyone understood from Yu Kong's actions that there must be something else lurking in the chasm.  They could only patiently hide with him in the shadows.</p><p>Finally, still not fully reassured, Yu Kong drew patterns similar to those on the corpses around everyone.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't yet discern what kind of trap Yu Kong had set for Luo Xingnan and Sheng Yuanzi, but he knew they couldn't wait any longer. Otherwise, Yun Youzi and Ge Yuan might miss their chance to escape.  He quietly crushed the Communication Pendant.</p><p>They waited in hiding for a long time, yet no one emerged from the cave.  However, Yu Kong showed no signs of impatience.</p><p>After another period of time, a figure finally flashed at the cave entrance, followed by several others.</p><p>The two figures at the front were Luo Xingnan and Sheng Yuanzi.</p><p>They had arrived together.</p><p>Behind them, their two groups were clearly separated.</p><p>Qin Sang saw Yun Youzi and Ge Yuan, and his brow furrowed almost imperceptibly. When he crushed the Communication Pendant, he had specifically warned them about the potential danger in the abyss and that Luo Xingnan and Sheng Yuanzi were likely doomed.  He hadn't expected them to follow the others in.</p><p>However, with no way to communicate, Qin Sang couldn't tell if they hadn't had a chance to escape or if they had other plans.</p><p>With his two rivals arriving together, Yu Kong wasn't flustered. He snorted, "Both of you arrived together. Saves me the trouble."</p><p>Qin Sang glanced down at the abyss.</p><p>The danger within must be greater than he had imagined for Yu Kong to be so confident in eliminating both Luo Xingnan and Sheng Yuanzi.</p><p>Unfortunately, with the Communication Pendant broken, Qin Sang could no longer send a warning to Yun Youzi and Ge Yuan.  He could only pray for their safety.</p><p>If Yun Youzi and Ge Yuan perished, he'd have to revise his plans and prepare for both eventualities.</p><p>He had no conflict with Yu Kong, and a peaceful resolution would be ideal.</p><p>Even if Yu Kong had ulterior motives, he wouldn't deliberately target Qin Sang. Qin Sang possessed far more treasures than a typical rogue cultivator, which could compensate for any disparity in strength. As long as he remained cautious, escaping wouldn't be difficult.</p><p>He might even find an opportunity to turn the tables.</p><p>Only Yan Wu presented a significant threat.  Every time Yan Wu looked at him, Qin Sang felt a chill down his spine.</p><p>Qin Sang remained motionless, observing the figures above, his eyes flickering.</p><p>The two groups stood at the cave entrance, gazing at the distant mountains.</p><p>――――</p><p>"Where's that old ghost Yu?"</p><p>Sheng Yuanzi narrowed his eyes, scanning the surroundings. He found the plain empty, and the distant mountains were shrouded in mist, obscuring the view.</p><p>Luo Xingnan stared at the mountains, his eyes filled with obsession. He murmured, "Shao Chunhui really stumbled upon an extraordinary place! This must be the owner's herb garden. These are at least thousand-year-old spirit herbs, truly dazzling! That old dog has probably already entered the mountains. We should move before he plunders all the treasures."</p><p>Sheng Yuanzi glanced at Luo Xingnan, "Shao Chunhui returned empty-handed last time, indicating that the restrictions within those mists aren't simple. Let that old ghost Yu scout the way for us. What's the rush? Now that we've confirmed that it's all Yu Kong's doing, shouldn't you recall the spy you planted by my side?"</p><p>"Before I was certain whether it was you, old bull-nose, or that old ghost Yu, I naturally had to make preparations for both scenarios."</p><p>Called out directly, Luo Xingnan showed no shame.  He withdrew his obsessed gaze and beckoned to a withered old man behind Sheng Yuanzi, "Fellow Daoist Gong, come back."</p><p>The old man surnamed Gong stepped forward and bowed to Sheng Yuanzi, "Each serves their own master. Please forgive me, Daoist Priest."</p><p>"It was you all along! Do you really think I wouldn't dare kill you?!"</p><p>Sheng Yuanzi snorted coldly, his gaze sharp, killing intent evident.</p><p>Under Sheng Yuanzi's imposing aura, the old man surnamed Gong trembled, his face paling slightly.</p><p>Luo Xingnan stepped forward, shielding the old man from Sheng Yuanzi's pressure. He said calmly, "The feeling is mutual! Old bull-nose, since we've decided to join forces against that old ghost Yu, dwelling on such trivial matters is pointless. After we kill Yu Kong and obtain the spirit herbs, we'll go our separate ways. I'll burn incense for your ashes after I form my Gold Core. Until then, I have no interest in playing these games with you. Besides… don't tell me you don't have your own people by my side."</p><p>"You want to form your Gold Core? In your next life!"</p><p>Sheng Yuanzi scoffed, pointing at a man in a long robe behind Luo Xingnan, "Brother Chen, don't worry, I guarantee that old ghost Luo won't dare touch you again."</p><p>The man in the long robe simply said, "I only hope you will honor your promise, Senior."</p><p>Sheng Yuanzi chuckled, glancing at the people behind him, and gestured towards the distant mountains, "Look at the radiant light on the mountain. There are more than enough spirit herbs up there for each of us to take one. However, that's assuming we can break the restrictions and deal with old ghost Yu, so I need all of you to give it your all. But if anyone tries to fool me, don't blame me for being ruthless."</p><p>Luo Xingnan echoed the same sentiment.</p><p>After warning the others, Luo Xingnan and Sheng Yuanzi conferred briefly, then led everyone down the cliff.</p><p>"Wait…"</p><p>Just as they were about to leap across the chasm, Sheng Yuanzi paused slightly, signaling everyone to stop.</p><p>Luo Xingnan frowned, asking, "Did your man leave a mark?"</p><p>Staring into the abyss, Sheng Yuanzi shook his head, "No…"</p><p>Luo Xingnan sneered, "Old bull-nose, you're getting more timid with age. A small ditch like this scares you? If there were any real danger, there would be signs of a struggle."</p>
