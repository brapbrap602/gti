<h1>Chapter 1021: Encounter</h1><p>“Unfortunately, I only have one set of the spirit array.”</p><p>Su Nu looked down at the jade bracelet fragments, a look of regret on her face.  Her strength was slightly weaker than the young man's; she had only managed to kill him through surprise and the use of that forbidden artifact.  She pondered the young man's final words.</p><p>Su Nu's eyes flickered, suspecting that she might be overthinking, misinterpreting things. But as she recalled her past tragic experiences – the girls with lives as bright as flowers, all killed by evil sorcery, and the hideous face of Yue Xiangu – a shiver ran down her spine. That period was a nightmare she could never escape. Without those memories, she would have undoubtedly believed the Eastern Pole Alliance Master's concern for her, and considered those people her true friends and family.</p><p>Su Nu sighed, wiped away all traces, and searched the young man's pouch. She kept what she could use and destroyed the rest. She looked around, about to use her movement technique to escape.</p><p>A rumbling sound came from beneath the ice, rapidly approaching. At first, Su Nu didn't pay much attention, thinking it was just ordinary beasts attracted by the commotion. She had already killed two ice lizards there, fought a fierce battle with her senior brother, and detonated the forbidden artifact – quite a noisy affair.</p><p>But the next moment, Su Nu's face turned pale.</p><p>“Crack!”</p><p>The ice in the distance suddenly shattered. An ice dragon burst from the surface, its body translucent, its blood and bones visible to the naked eye.  The ice dragon soared into the air, looking down at Su Nu with intense madness and killing intent, a terrifying sight.</p><p>“Comparable to a late Core Formation cultivator…”</p><p>Sensing the ice dragon's aura, Su Nu's heart sank. To gain the young man's trust and lure him into a trap, she had even resorted to self-harm to create a disguise, and then fought a draining battle with him. Her strength was far below her peak.  Facing such a powerful beast, she felt far from confident.</p><p>Just as this thought crossed her mind, an even more alarming sight appeared. The surrounding ice began to crackle, and in an instant, the entire ice surface was crisscrossed with fissures. Below the ice, numerous white shadows moved, rapidly encircling her – a multitude of ice dragons, large and small.</p><p>She had not disturbed a single beast, but an entire swarm!  The trial grounds contained powerful beasts comparable to late Core Formation cultivators, and even top-tier beasts – a stroke of bad luck could lead to an encounter – but disturbing so many at once was extremely rare.</p><p>It was all because she stayed in one place for too long.  Su Nu felt bitter. She'd probably be killed here before the Merchant Alliance could even scheme against her.</p><p>“Demon Wings!”</p><p>Su Nu's lips moved slightly, and she quickly formed hand seals.  Demonic energy surged from her body, coalescing behind her into a pair of black wings. The wings were unusual, like skeletal wings without skin or feathers.  Strands of demonic energy formed black bones, piecing together grotesque, bony wings.</p><p>“Whoosh!”</p><p>With a flap of her wings, Su Nu darted towards the weakest point in the ice dragon swarm – the opposite direction from the ice dragon king in the air.</p><p>The ice dragon king roared, its voice piercing, its body launching itself forward in a swift attack.</p><p>“Bang bang bang…”</p><p>The ice shattered repeatedly as more white shadows burst forth, scrambling towards Su Nu.</p><p>“Demonic Yuan Slash!”</p><p>Su Nu gritted her teeth, changing her hand seals. Demonic energy gathered in her palm, instantly transforming into a massive black demonic blade, nearly seven feet long.</p><p>Knowing that if she couldn't escape quickly, her chances were slim, Su Nu unleashed her full power.  Compared to the enormous demonic blade, Su Nu’s body appeared thin and small.  She soared through the air, holding the blade aloft, and slashed down at the swarm of ice dragons!</p><p>“Swish!”</p><p>The shadow of the demonic blade was like a black light, exceptionally striking against the white expanse of ice.</p><p>“Tear!”</p><p>The two medium-sized ice dragons in the front were cleaved in two almost effortlessly.  But alarmingly, the other ice dragons were not deterred, instead driven even madder by the scent of blood.</p><p>“Bang bang bang…”</p><p>The shattered corpses crashed onto the ice.  Su Nu forged a path with her demonic blade, charging forward. The ice dragon king drew closer, making her hair stand on end, and more ice dragons were gathering from beneath the ice.</p><p>Finally, after the demonic blade cut down another ice dragon, a gap opened ahead.</p><p>“Out!”</p><p>Su Nu’s heart leaped with joy.  She flapped her wings, flashed out of the encirclement, and immediately sheathed her blade, turning into a black streak of light and fleeing far away.</p><p>The ice dragon king roared in fury, its figure like lightning, pursuing Su Nu relentlessly.</p><p>Under the ice, white figures appeared and disappeared without a trace.</p><p>After a burst of speed, Su Nu glanced back and saw that the Ice Jiao King was relentlessly pursuing her, as if they had a deep-seated feud.</p><p>Her biggest concern was that the commotion was attracting more beasts. If several more powerful monsters like the Ice Jiao King were drawn in, her situation would become extremely dangerous.</p><p>Thinking this, Su Nu took a talisman from her pouch, one of the life-saving measures given to her by the Merchant Guild before she left.</p><p>Activating the talisman, a green aura surrounded Su Nu, and her speed increased dramatically.</p><p>…</p><p>Elsewhere in the Xuanbing Plains.</p><p>Unfazed by the cold, Qin Sang effortlessly killed a beast and continued on his journey without a second thought.</p><p>Of course, he wasn’t reckless.</p><p>The Xuanbing Plains harbored creatures that could pose a threat to him.</p><p>He knew that the trial grounds might even contain top-tier beasts comparable to Yuan Ying cultivators. No one could be certain if any were lurking in the Xuanbing Plains.</p><p>The overconfident often met a bad end.</p><p>Shortly after, Qin Sang seemed to sense something, abruptly stopping his flight and looking towards his rear right.</p><p>He frowned slightly, scanned his surroundings, then swiftly flew to a distant location, disappearing from sight as he concealed himself.</p><p>Soon after, a monstrous roar, mixed with the piercing sound of something tearing through the air, came from the direction Qin Sang was watching.</p><p>A moment later, a black streak of light appeared in Qin Sang's field of vision.</p><p>Clearly, a cultivator was being chased by a beast!</p><p>“So there are powerful beasts lurking in the Xuanbing Plains!”</p><p>Hidden in the shadows, Qin Sang thought to himself. His gaze swept over the cultivator, just as he was about to see what beast was pursuing her, his eyes suddenly narrowed.</p><p>“How is it her?”</p><p>To Qin Sang’s surprise, the person being chased was Su Nu!</p><p>Su Nu, having become a close confidante of the East Pole Alliance leader, had rapidly increased her cultivation to the late Jindan stage. This couldn’t be solely attributed to talent; the East Pole Alliance must have provided resources and intensive training.</p><p>With the Merchant Guild's support, Su Nu should have easily passed the first three trials. However, to Qin Sang's surprise, Su Nu was injured and being chased by a beast without fighting back, appearing quite distressed.</p><p>“Huh?”</p><p>At that moment, a voice from the corpse puppet bag suddenly said, “This girl… her cultivation technique is quite unique.  Those wings on her back… they feel… strangely familiar!”</p>
