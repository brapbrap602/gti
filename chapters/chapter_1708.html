<h1>Chapter 1699: The Hundred Rivers Market</h1><p>The Hundred Rivers Market.</p><p>There are two explanations for this name.</p><p>One is the surrounding geography; it's located on the east coast of the Northern Wasteland, near a region with abundant waterways that converge into the East Sea.</p><p>The second is that the market was founded by a figure known as the Hundred Rivers Patriarch.</p><p>The East Sea coast is the most prosperous area of the Northern Wasteland.  Over half of the Northern Wasteland's demonic sects have established their bases here, making it relatively peaceful compared to other parts of the region. While not as strictly regulated as the Central Plains, cultivators are subject to certain constraints. The various demonic sects have established unspoken rules and generally avoid reckless actions.</p><p>However, in a land where demonic sects hold sway, there's always a shortage of those who respect the rules.</p><p>Therefore, even on the East Sea coast, safe places suitable for trade are few and far between. The Hundred Rivers Market is one of them.</p><p>The owner of the Hundred Rivers Market dares to set rules and has the power to enforce them.</p><p>Choosing the Hundred Rivers Market for a transaction carries a deeper meaning.</p><p>It's rumored that the market has close ties to the Jade Gate Sect. Some even claim that the forces controlling the market are actually Jade Gate Sect disciples, two sides of the same coin.</p><p>The Jade Gate Sect is immensely wealthy, due to its influence in the East Sea, the Northern Wasteland, and the Central Plains, navigating these three regions with skill.</p><p>Mo Xingdao hails from the Northern Wasteland, and Qin Sang is wary of Mo Xingdao forging alliances with demonic sects and harboring ill intentions. The Hundred Rivers Market is a location acceptable to both.</p><p>At that time, Qin Sang hadn't yet been targeted by the Saint King; his caution was simply habitual.</p><p>If he hadn't been injured, with his main body and avatar present, he wouldn't fear Mo Xingdao's trickery, unless Mo Xingdao managed to rally all the Northern Wasteland demonic sects to hunt him down.</p><p>Where rivers converge, boats are naturally abundant.</p><p>Many cultivators even occupy the waterways near the Hundred Rivers Market, using spirit formations to seal off sections of water and construct magical boats, using them as floating residences.</p><p>Some of these floating residences are also rented out.</p><p>Inside a seemingly ordinary magical boat, a member of the Moonlit Guard sat in meditation.</p><p>Suddenly, the Moonlit Guard's eyelids twitched, awakening from their trance. They flipped their hand, revealing a small jade seal, a type of communication talisman.</p><p>The seal glowed faintly, quite noticeable in the dim interior of the boat. The jade bead at its top emitted a rhythmic luminescence.</p><p>The Moonlit Guard's expression tightened.</p><p>They respectfully addressed the jade bead: "Greetings, Master!"</p><p>"Is Mo Xingdao still in his residence?"</p><p>The voice of Qin Sang's avatar came from the seal.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang's avatar had arrived near the Hundred Rivers Market, remaining unseen.</p><p>Some days prior, Qin Sang received news that Mo Xingdao had appeared at the Hundred Rivers Market and ordered his subordinates to secretly monitor Mo Xingdao's movements.  The Moonlit Guard was only at the early Nascent Soul stage; even a full-scale deployment wouldn't allow them to track Mo Xingdao, only leading to their deaths. Qin Sang hadn't held out much hope, merely instructing them to gather information.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Mo Xingdao showed no intention of concealing himself, leaving the pre-arranged mark and renting a residence in the west market of the Hundred Rivers Market, never venturing out, seemingly waiting for Qin Sang to approach.</p><p>Of course, whether Mo Xingdao was truly present or, like Qin Sang, employing a ruse, remained unclear. The Moonlit Guard dared not investigate.</p><p>"He hasn't been seen leaving."</p><p>The Moonlit Guard replied.</p><p>In the distance, Qin Sang's avatar fell into thought, gazing towards the Hundred Rivers Market.</p><p>Only the avatar had come this time; the main body was severely injured, and even if it arrived, it would be hard-pressed to be of much use. Should anything unexpected occur, the avatar could act as a decoy, preventing harm to the main body.</p><p>After a moment, the avatar spoke to the talisman, the Moonlit Guard responding respectfully. Once the connection was severed, however, their brow furrowed, filled with apprehension.</p><p>Controlled by the Moonlit Seal, their life and death were in the hands of another; they dared not rebel.</p><p>Fortunately, the new master seemed less capricious and brutal than Su Zinan, having previously entrusted them with a refined artifact.</p><p>The Moonlit Guard opened their pouch and took out a mirror – the repaired Thousand Realms Mirror.</p><p>Gently touching the mirror's surface, spiritual energy flowed from their palm.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>The mirror's surface shone brightly, emitting an intense light.</p><p>Strangely, the beam of light seemed to encounter an invisible barrier in the void, abruptly ceasing. As the light's intensity fluctuated, a perfect replica of the Thousand Realms Mirror gradually formed in the void.</p><p>The mirror image only lasted a moment before disappearing.</p><p>Leaving the mirror image behind, scattering invisible mirror imprints along the way, one could easily escape and return to the boat in case of danger. The Thousand Realms Mirror is undoubtedly a life-saving treasure, but it requires prior preparation and is limited by distance.</p><p>The mirror image solidified.</p><p>Concerned for their safety, the Moonlit Guard carefully checked again, confirming everything was correct before leaving the boat, boarding a pleasure craft, and sailing into the Hundred Rivers Market.</p><p>The city was crisscrossed by canals, with a Spirit Lake at its heart.  The four markets—east, west, south, and north—were built around this lake, making it a veritable water city.</p><p>Being a Yuan Ying master, Mingyue Wei encountered no trouble entering the city. He went to the west market and arrived at Mo Xingdao's cave abode.</p><p>He touched the restriction.</p><p>The abode opened, and a man emerged.</p><p>This man was dressed as a scholar, bearing no resemblance to Mo Xingdao.</p><p>"Friend Daoist…"</p><p>The scholar's eyes narrowed slightly, a question on his face.</p><p>Before he could finish, Mingyue Wei's brow pulsed with blood energy, revealing the Mingyue Seal.</p><p>The scholar smiled faintly, his features twisting and changing to reveal his true form—Mo Xingdao himself!</p><p>He had disguised himself when leaving a mark, as news of the North Waste's top independent cultivator entering the city would cause unrest in the entire Baichuanxu.</p><p>He had traveled with Su Zinan for a time, but hadn't seen all of Mingyue Wei's men.  Seeing the Mingyue Seal confirmed the identity.</p><p>"Please come in, Daoist friend.  May I ask your Daoist name?"</p><p>Mo Xingdao gestured politely, showing no disrespect for Mingyue Wei's status.</p><p>"A mere servant, I have no face to use my old name."</p><p>Mingyue Wei's expression was impassive.</p><p>Mo Xingdao nodded, unperturbed, and asked, "Is Qingfeng Daoist well?"</p><p>After witnessing Su Zinan's captured infant remnant, he knew that Luye and Mingyue Wei had fallen into the hands of Qin Sang's avatar. The name Qingfeng Daoist, used by Qin Sang's avatar, had spread widely after the Xie family's visit to Ganlu Temple to mourn.</p><p>"I am here on my master's orders."</p><p>Mingyue Wei, mindful of his duty, said nothing more. He immediately produced a communication talisman, informed the avatar of the situation, and left the cave abode.</p><p>A somewhat indistinct voice came from the talisman, "Daoist Mo."</p><p>Mo Xingdao's response was unexpected, "Daoist Qin, you're late. You kept me waiting."</p><p>After a moment of silence, the avatar said, "Daoist Mo already knows."</p><p>"The Saint King harbors ill intentions, but it's not hidden from those with discerning eyes.  I'm not the only one who feels injustice for Daoist Qin; it's just that we are insignificant," Mo Xingdao said gravely.</p><p>The avatar sighed, "Daoist Mo's concern is appreciated. Daoist Mo certainly knows of my predicament.  I had no choice but to contact you this way. Please don't mind."</p><p>Mo Xingdao said it was alright, then looked outside the cave, questioning, "Daoist Qin wouldn't have placed the Five Elements Pill on Mingyue Wei, would you? I've brought the Spirit Rhinoceros Fruit.  I wonder what Daoist Qin's intention is. Does our previous agreement still stand? Or will we change the terms?"</p><p>His very presence here demonstrated his commitment.</p><p>The avatar didn't answer, continuing, "Like Daoist Mo, I travel alone, with no one to assist me. Though I barely escaped the Saint King's pursuit, I was severely injured and my foundation shaken. My injuries are extremely serious and unhealed. My avatar's cultivation is insufficient to act alone."</p><p>Mo Xingdao listened silently, without interrupting.</p><p>"It's not that I don't trust Daoist Mo, but these two spiritual herbs are extremely important.  The Saint King sees me as a thorn in his side, and I'm jumpy. Even at my peak, I wouldn't dare be careless."</p><p>Having explained his situation, the avatar said, "I initiated this trade, and I won't go back on my word."</p><p>Mo Xingdao understood, "Daoist Qin means…"</p><p>"Both the Five Elements Pill and Spirit Rhinoceros Fruit are to be taken at the moment of breakthrough, and neither is urgently needed for you or me…Daoist Mo's cultivation hasn't reached its peak, has it?"</p><p>The avatar suddenly asked.</p><p>Mo Xingdao's expression shifted slightly, but he didn't answer.</p><p>However, their cultivation levels were similar, and they had even fought before. Although Qin Sang couldn't fully see through Mo Xingdao, he could make some simple judgments based on various clues.</p><p>The avatar suggested, "Since it's not urgent, could you be flexible and wait a while? Once things calm down and my main body recovers, we can arrange the trade."</p><p>Being targeted by the Qinghu Saint King left Qin Sang no room for error.</p><p>Mo Xingdao managed to bring the Spirit Rhinoceros Fruit out, but at what cost?  Having stayed on the Guiyan Plateau for so long, Qin Sang couldn't help but be suspicious.</p><p>Even with the threat of a Nascent Soul cultivator, the avatar facing Mo Xingdao and his puppet alone was too vulnerable.</p><p>Regarding matters of life and death, caution was paramount.</p><p>Qin Sang was trying to buy time, at least until his main body refined the Devilfire Origin, gaining the ability to fight a Nascent Soul cultivator before considering the exchange.</p><p>Not to mention the benefits of the enhanced spiritual sense.</p><p>Based on the performance of the two Nascent Soul cultivators in the Demon Subduing War, Qin Sang estimated that once he refined the Devilfire Origin, the Fire Lotus would also possess Nascent Soul level power, and under his control, it would consume far less than the six firebirds.</p><p>This wouldn't take too long.</p><p>Mo Xingdao's puppet, adept at Yin-Yang escape techniques, was elusive and less cautious than his master.</p><p>To persuade Mo Xingdao, Qin Sang used reason and emotion, sending a contingent of冥月卫 to show his seriousness.</p><p>Both sides tacitly avoided mentioning their collaboration and transaction after the Six States Hall's treasure exchange, though both were aware of each other's identities. That transaction had been successful, laying a solid foundation for their current arrangement.  They were essentially holding each other's medicinal herbs in safekeeping.</p><p>If Mo Xingdao disregarded everything else and insisted on trading now, Qin Sang would have to carefully consider his intentions.</p><p>Mo Xingdao neither agreed nor refused, remaining silent for a moment before saying, "My purpose in coming, Daoist friend, is twofold. First, to keep our appointment. Second, to deliver a message."</p><p>On the other side of the talisman, the avatar's eyes narrowed sharply, his body tensing.  Even through the talisman, Mo Xingdao could sense the avatar's tension.</p><p>He spoke calmly, "Daoist friend, have no fear. I come on the orders of the Holy One, Hui Guang. Before I left, the monk gave me a grain of sand, instructing me to break the enchantment within upon contacting you.  He has an important matter to discuss with you, concerning your feud with the Qinghu Holy King, the Xie family, and your future circumstances. As a testament to his sincerity, the Holy One remains in Central Plains. If you don't mind, Daoist friend, I shall open the sand now."</p><p>A long silence followed.</p><p>The avatar, certain the other party couldn't trace him through the talisman, added another layer of concealment. If the transmission distance weren't limited, he would have retreated even further.</p><p>What did the Holy One, Hui Guang, want?</p><p>Was it because the Xie family's pleas couldn't silence the rumors, and he felt the pressure?</p><p>Could Hui Guang protect him from the Qinghu Holy King?</p><p>The Holy One certainly had the power, but Qin Sang couldn't fathom his reasons.</p><p>Since Hui Guang sent Mo Xingdao with a message, he must know about the transaction. If this wasn't handled carefully, the transaction could face further complications.</p><p>The avatar said in a low voice, "Please, proceed."</p><p>Mo Xingdao then took a grain of yellow sand from his pouch.</p><p>A seemingly ordinary grain of sand, upon Mo Xingdao's incantation, suddenly expanded, transforming into countless motes of dust.</p><p>As the Buddhist saying goes, "a grain of sand contains a world," and this scene perfectly illustrated the saying.</p><p>The dust motes floated in the cave, dyeing the entire space a dusky yellow, with the sound of wind and sand.  Then, two human figures gradually emerged from the dust.</p><p>The figures were blurry, composed of yellow sand, but recognizable as an old monk and a woman.</p><p>Hui Guang had used this extraordinary grain of sand and his profound abilities to transmit his thoughts from the Central Plains to this location.</p><p>The sand-formed image of the old monk stared blankly at the talisman, his lips moving.  His voice, as deep as Hui Guang's, echoed, "Is this Daoist Qin?"</p><p>After a moment, the avatar replied, "Greetings, Holy Monk."</p><p>Upon confirming the identity, Hui Guang's speech accelerated, "This method of transmission cannot be sustained for long. I will be brief. It's said, 'old grievances should be resolved, not festered'. I wish to mediate, to resolve the conflict between you and the Qinghu Holy King. What is your decision, Daoist Qin?"</p><p>The avatar was momentarily stunned.</p><p>He never expected Hui Guang to intervene so proactively.</p><p>Did the righteous sects of Central State truly uphold justice?</p><p>Hesitating slightly, the avatar coldly replied, "What conflict? It's just that I've been unilaterally hunted by the Holy King, right?  Everyone knows those two crocodile demons were his subordinates. Let's not resort to such deceptive tactics!"</p><p>The ethereal image of the Qinghu Holy King remained silent.</p><p>Hui Guang's tone remained even, calmly stating the truth, "I have investigated. The Qinghu Holy King attacked you because he was attracted to a treasure on your person, coupled with past grievances, leading to his immediate action. I know this reason is flimsy and hardly justifiable. But those of us at this level of cultivation have witnessed such things many times. We know there are no irreconcilable feuds.  If this knot can be untied, you won't have to live so cautiously and can finally find peace. Therefore, I believe there's a possibility of reconciliation."</p><p>Perhaps because the secret technique was indeed unsustainable, Hui Guang's words were extraordinarily blunt.</p><p>Faced with such frankness, the avatar was speechless.</p><p>Before the avatar could respond,</p><p>Hui Guang continued, "The Qinghu Holy King sincerely repents and is willing to compensate for your losses and vow never to harm you again. I will serve as a witness!"</p>
