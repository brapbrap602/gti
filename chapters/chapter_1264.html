<h1>Chapter 1256: The Baptism</h1><p>If that ancient cultivator truly had no means of resistance, he absolutely must not fall into the hands of the Abyssal Sin. The key to unraveling the ancient secrets might very well lie with this person! If the ancient cultivator was as terrifying as the Demon Lord, then it was even more imperative to prevent Old Demon Ye from breaking the seal. No matter what, they had to go and investigate.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang deep in thought, Jing Yu took the Thunder Thought Beads and whispered a few words into Fat Chicken's ear. Fat Chicken, obeying his mother's instructions, retreated into the Primordial Unity Ring. For him, this place was far too dangerous—even the residual shockwaves could crush him to dust.</p><p>Qin Sang turned his gaze to Jing Yu.</p><p>Jing Yu let out a soft sigh and spoke gravely, "Regardless of what you and the others decide to do, I must return and find a way to seize the Corpse Flower Blood Amber."</p><p>"The ancient cultivator is enigmatic and unpredictable, and the Abyssal Sin is formidable. For you to go alone would be unwise," Qin Sang advised, trying to dissuade her. He didn’t want Jing Yu to throw her life away—otherwise, saving her would have been in vain.</p><p>Jing Yu’s expression darkened as she glanced at the Primordial Unity Ring on Qin Sang’s wrist. When she had spoken earlier, she had already cast an invisible barrier to prevent Fat Chicken from hearing.</p><p>"After entering the dark prison, although my life was not in immediate danger, my injuries were severe, and I lacked the necessary spiritual medicines. Most of my energy was spent on healing. Moreover, this place is unsuitable for cultivation. Over the past two hundred years, my progress has nearly come to a standstill.</p><p>"Additionally, all of my protective treasures were destroyed by the flesh puppets.</p><p>"Soon after leaving, I will face a heavenly tribulation. If I cannot obtain the Corpse Flower Blood Amber and attempt to break through forcibly, this tribulation will be a certain death sentence!"</p><p>Jing Yu’s tone was bitter. She had just reunited with her child, yet now she had to risk her life again. Failure to overcome the tribulation would mean eternal separation.</p><p>Qin Sang sighed inwardly. Having only recently formed his Nascent Soul, he had not yet truly felt the oppressive weight of a heavenly tribulation, but he could understand Jing Yu’s plight. Under the Heavenly Dao, all are but ants, and everyone is struggling to survive.</p><p>After a moment of hesitation, Jing Yu added, "Fellow Daoist Qin, in truth, your human race can also refine the Corpse Flower Blood Amber. You only need to place it at the core of a top-tier spiritual vein and nurture it for ten years using the spiritual vein and a secret technique to cleanse the blood poison from the amber. The residual medicinal power is extremely pure and can be directly absorbed into the body. It is an exceedingly rare divine medicine that can directly enhance Nascent Soul cultivation!"</p><p>Upon hearing this, Qin Sang was momentarily stunned. He fell silent, unable to help but wonder if Jing Yu was deceiving him to secure his help in obtaining the Corpse Flower Blood Amber.</p><p>The Phoenix Blood was sealed within the Phoenix Wings, so the Corpse Flower Blood Amber would be of no use to him and could only be exchanged. No matter how precious a treasure, if it was of no use to him, Qin Sang had to carefully consider whether it was worth the risk.</p><p>Jing Yu, perceptive as ever, noticed Qin Sang’s concern and quickly said, "Fellow Daoist Qin, you’ve just helped me escape. How could I be so ungrateful as to deceive you? Here is the secret technique for baptizing the Corpse Flower Blood Amber. Please take a look. This technique has been passed down through my clan for generations. We’ve long known about the Corpse Flower Blood Amber, but we only knew that the cleansed amber could enhance cultivation. We’re unsure if it retains any effects that aid in breaking through bottlenecks. The cost is that the spiritual vein’s energy will be affected by the blood poison, but it will recover within a few years…"</p><p>Qin Sang caught the silver light Jing Yu flicked toward him, and a secret technique appeared in his mind. It was indeed profound and extraordinary—Jing Yu couldn’t have fabricated it.</p><p>He thought to himself: After forming the Nascent Soul, every breakthrough must be achieved through one’s own efforts. Even if the Corpse Flower Blood Amber couldn’t help him break through a bottleneck, saving years of arduous cultivation would still be worthwhile. As for the spiritual vein, he could borrow the Yuan Mirage Sect’s.</p><p>Moreover, even if he didn’t seize the Corpse Flower Blood Amber, he still needed to go to the center of the grand formation.</p><p>"The Corpse Flower Blood Amber’s effect on impacting bloodline power is strongest during the first consumption. However, after cleansing the blood poison, no matter how much is consumed, it won’t affect refinement. Back then, five pieces emerged, and there may be even more inside. I only need two…"</p><p>One for herself, and one for Little Fat.</p><p>Jing Yu knew she was outmatched and hoped to persuade Qin Sang to assist her.</p><p>Earlier, Little Fat had spoken highly of this Senior Qin, claiming he dominated the Northern Star Realm and was the foremost expert of the current era. She felt this was an exaggeration, but it was enough to show that this man was extraordinary.</p><p>Qin Sang didn’t hesitate for long and agreed.</p><p>Jing Yu was overjoyed. She gazed fondly at the Unity Ring and said, "Fellow Daoist Qin, if something goes wrong this time, or if I fail to overcome the tribulation, I entrust Little Fat to you."</p><p>Qin Sang looked deeply at Jing Yu and said, "He has the ability to protect himself, and with the fusion of the Phoenix Thunder Power, his future is boundless. He doesn’t need anyone to take care of him. The heavens favor the virtuous, Fellow Daoist. Don’t be too pessimistic, or it may hinder your tribulation."</p><p>"Thank you for the reminder, Fellow Daoist. I was overthinking."</p><p>Jing Yu took a deep breath, her expression returning to normal. She accepted a bottle of spiritual pills from Qin Sang to quickly restore her peak strength.</p><p>During their earlier departure from the Black Tower and their subsequent conversation, Qin Sang had summoned a sword talisman. After activating it, he sensed the location of the Netherworld Demon Lord.</p><p>They were now heading to meet the Netherworld Demon Lord, as Jing Yu knew how to find the center of the grand formation. To deal with the ancient cultivator and the Abyssal Sin, everyone needed to work together. At that time, he and Jing Yu could seize the opportunity to take the Corpse Flower Blood Amber amidst the chaos.</p><p>Qin Sang led the way, activating his treasures to clear the path, while Jing Yu followed behind, silently refining the pills.</p><p>The scenery within the formation shifted several times.</p><p>Jing Yu said, "They’re wandering aimlessly within the formation. It seems they haven’t deciphered the formation’s patterns yet. I’ve recovered ninety percent of my strength. Let’s hurry and join them. I’ve heard of Old Demon Ye’s reputation—he’s not to be underestimated. Delaying may lead to unforeseen changes."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded.</p><p>The two activated their escape lights—one riding a sword, the other transforming into lightning—and sped off.</p><p>The sword talisman guided them, drawing them closer.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>Qin Sang and Jing Yu arrived at a vast open area, where they saw blood lightning and radiant lights ahead—a fierce battle was underway.</p><p>As they approached, they realized the Netherworld Demon Lord and the others were besieging several flesh puppets.</p><p>Everyone except Qin Sang had gathered.</p><p>The flesh puppets roared in fury, their bodies covered in wounds, yet they remained tenacious and ferocious. Their injuries were visibly healing at an astonishing rate. The blood axes in their hands wielded the power to split mountains and part seas. With each swing, a blood light shot out, forcing everyone to dodge.</p><p>"Who’s there?"</p><p>"Who goes there?"</p><p>…</p><p>As Qin Sang and Jing Yu approached, several shouts rang out, followed by two streaks of light—Qing Jun and the Netherworld Demon Lord.</p><p>Both sides halted their escape lights.</p><p>Qin Sang and Qing Jun’s eyes met, and they nodded slightly.</p><p>Qing Jun looked at Jing Yu beside him, somewhat surprised that she appeared unharmed.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Jing Yu?"</p><p>The Netherworld Demon Lord actually recognized Jing Yu, his face filled with astonishment.</p><p>"Greetings, Fellow Daoist Netherworld, Fellow Daoist Cold…"</p><p>Jing Yu bowed to each of them, and they quickly returned the courtesy.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist, you’ve been missing for many years. I thought you had already…"</p><p>The Netherworld Demon Lord, who dominated the demonic path of the Small Cold Domain, had once interacted with the demon kings who lived in seclusion in the Boundless Valley. They had maintained a mutual non-aggression pact.</p><p>After Fat Chicken fused with the Phoenix Thunder Power, his appearance had also changed.</p><p>The Netherworld Demon Lord glanced at Qin Sang, recalling how Qin Sang had frequently released the bird during their journey. His behavior had been peculiar, and now it all made sense. "Fellow Daoist Jing Yu, have you been cultivating in the Blood Lake all this time?"</p>
