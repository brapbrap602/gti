Chapter 710: The Hunt


During his flight, Qin Sang discovered two more traces of Great Demons. Without exception, they were all drawn by the strange icy flames, converging towards the source from distant seas.


Knowing that more and more Great Demons would be attracted, Qin Sang didn't dare linger. He flew towards the sea route without stopping, finally reaching an island marked on his map late at night, rejoining his planned course.


This place was very far from the icy flames.  He could no longer see anything unusual in that direction. However, on his way, Qin Sang vaguely heard the roars of monstrous beasts behind him. These beasts seemed to be fighting amongst themselves. He couldn't tell whether it was because of the icy flames or if some treasure had survived on the island.


"Icy flames…"


Qin Sang murmured, thinking that with the power of the icy flames, it was unlikely that these Core Formation stage demons could subdue them. He himself was no exception, lacking the strength to covet such power.


Withdrawing his gaze, Qin Sang checked the sea chart to confirm his direction.


He now had two choices: either return the way he came, as they had already confirmed that the first half of the sea route marked on the chart was accurate, or go for broke and continue to traverse the Thousand Demon Sea.


Having already reached the heart of the Thousand Demon Sea, he felt reluctant to turn back. After a brief deliberation, Qin Sang decided to continue following the sea chart's guidance.


Now was a golden opportunity.  The Great Demons of the Thousand Demon Sea's core region were drawn to the icy flames, leaving their lairs. Even if the sea chart was slightly off, the danger was much less than before.


Acting decisively, Qin Sang meditated on the island to recover his strength. Once fully restored, he set off immediately.


After three days of travel, Qin Sang was relieved. The markings on the sea chart were accurate; it seemed to be genuine. However, as a precaution, he proceeded cautiously and slowly. It took him almost a month to finally cross the Thousand Demon Sea.


…


Vast blue waves stretched as far as the eye could see, merging seamlessly with the sky.


Qin Sang stood on a large island, several hundred miles in diameter. Being on it felt like being on land. Half the island was covered in jungle, the other half by towering mountains.


Remarkably, this island was not occupied by monstrous beasts and teemed with life. Apart from the absence of humans, birds, beasts, fish, and insects all lived peacefully on the island.


The mountains near the coast were almost bare rock, with only a few tenacious plants growing in the crevices, offering a touch of green.


On the eastern side of the island, the mountains stretched to the coast and jutted out into the sea, forming a sharp, cape-like landform.


Qin Sang was currently standing at the highest point of this cape.


The wind at the cape was particularly boisterous today!


"Continuing from this island, I will leave the Thousand Demon Sea," Qin Sang gazed at the unusually calm sea, recalling the information he had obtained earlier. "It is said that this sea area ahead is actually safer than the Thousand Demon Sea, with fewer Great Demons. Of course, compared to the seas around Hunyuan Island, it's still quite dangerous. Few cultivators have the strength to cross the Thousand Demon Sea and reach here, but the Ember Sparrow is said to inhabit this area…"


Having overcome numerous obstacles to finally arrive here, a smile appeared on Qin Sang's face.


If nothing unexpected happened, Qin Sang planned to refine the Hunyuan Concentric Rings and then seclude himself here for a decade or two, avoiding the brunt of the war between the two clans. He would wait until there was a compelling reason to leave before returning to see how the situation had developed.


He had prepared ample supplies and had seized a large amount of resources from the withered old man he'd slain, so he didn't need to worry about running out. However, his two spirit insects were a concern.


The Fat Silkworm was fine. By devouring poisonous pills, its strength could rapidly increase without the need for other food.


The Sky-Eyed Butterfly, on the other hand, needed to be fed spirit herbs for rapid transformation.


He had already begun feeding the Sky-Eyed Butterfly a concoction made with Six-Petal Butterfly Violets, with good results. Unfortunately, he only had two Six-Petal Butterfly Violets, which he estimated would only be enough for the butterfly for a decade or so.


His immediate priority was to find the Ember Sparrow's nest and locate the Eternal Camphor Tree.


Someone had seen Ember Sparrows in the depths of this sea. Qin Sang's figure flickered, transforming into a streak of light as he set off once again.


Without a specific area to search, Qin Sang could only embark on a long journey of seeking the elusive bird.


The Ember Sparrow was a demonic bird, but its species had a strict hierarchy. Under the king's rule, members of the flock only moved within their territory.


As long as he could find one Ember Sparrow, finding the nest would be much easier.


A single Ember Sparrow flock could number in the thousands, or even tens or hundreds of thousands. Most Ember Sparrows, upon reaching adulthood, were barely considered transcendent, only slightly stronger than wild beasts, with short lifespans.


Only a few Ember Sparrows with powerful bloodlines had the potential for further advancement. Those fortunate enough to transform into the Core Formation stage gained the ability to establish their own territories.


However, even ordinary Ember Sparrows were incredibly ferocious, innately possessing a cold wind magic power. In combination with their large numbers, they were a formidable force.


With so many Ember Sparrows, their combined aura alone was enough to deter most.


The symbiotic relationship between the Ember Sparrow and the Eternal Camphor Tree was something Qin Sang had only seen recorded in the jade slip given to him by Old Man Eight Swords. Even with the vast collection of ancient texts in the Small Cold Realm, very few people knew about it, let alone in the Vast Wave Sea Region.


Those unaware of this relationship would certainly not risk entering a demonic bird's nest without a compelling reason.


Finding a small demonic bird in the vast ocean was no easy task, especially while needing to constantly remain vigilant against other monstrous beasts. After nearly a month of wandering the sea, Qin Sang finally discovered a demonic bird on a deserted island that closely resembled the Ember Sparrow!


Its feathers were like ice, its form like a swallow. Its sharp beak was transparent, and its size was similar to a goshawk. It stood on a reef by the shore of the deserted island, looking exceptionally majestic.


*Splash!*


The Ember Sparrow stared intently at the seabed, then suddenly plunged into the water.


A sea beast resembling a carp let out a sharp shriek.  Waves churned as the two beasts engaged in a life-or-death struggle in the sea.


The sea beast had the upper hand. The Ember Sparrow cried out in alarm, but the sea beast failed to notice the dozen or so other Ember Sparrows lurking in the crevices on the shore, watching intently.


When the Ember Sparrow being pursued unknowingly surfaced, these other Ember Sparrows suddenly sprang into action, shooting out like arrows loosed from a bowstring.


Terror flashed in the sea beast's eyes. It was too late to dive back down. The Ember Sparrows flapped their wings, their gusts of cold wind converging into a single mass, freezing the sea beast solid on the surface.  Quickly, they tore it apart.


However, these Ember Sparrows didn't immediately feast. Instead, they each grabbed a large chunk of flesh, flapping their wings and flying eastward.


Qin Sang, hidden on the island, watched the entire hunting process.


Their coordination was incredibly smooth, as if they had rehearsed countless times, the strategy etched into their instincts.


One of the Ember Sparrows, at the late Spirit Gathering stage, was the leader.  Under its watchful gaze, none of the other Ember Sparrows dared to steal a bite while dismembering the sea beast.
