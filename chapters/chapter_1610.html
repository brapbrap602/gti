<h1></h1><p>Wearing the Blood Alligator Bone Hand was like controlling a true ferocious beast.</p><p>A sinister aura constantly assaulted the wielder.</p><p>This was unavoidable when controlling the alligator bone; it couldn't be erased, and one had to endure this drawback.</p><p>Of course, with Qin Sang's cultivation, suppressing the Blood Alligator Bone Hand was no problem.</p><p>"Remembered?"</p><p>Qin Sang glanced sideways at Shen Chen.</p><p>Shen Chen had just been intimidated by the sinister aura of the Blood Alligator Bone Hand, swallowed his saliva, and nodded repeatedly.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, put away the treasure, and left Feiyun Ferry. To save time, he directly carried Shen Chen and flew back to Pu Mountain.</p><p>He brought Shen Chen back to the Xie family and found him a pavilion in the Clear Void Illusion Realm.</p><p>"Cultivate here from now on. Before your cultivation reaches a certain level, don't go out unless necessary! If you need anything, have Xie An arrange it for you."</p><p>Shen Chen's face fell upon hearing this, but he dared not disobey Qin Sang's orders, repeatedly agreeing. Secretly, he thought, 'Fine, I won't go out. Such a good cave dwelling, with servants attending to my needs, it's an environment many could only dream of.'</p><p>He was also quite patient, otherwise, he wouldn't have been able to delve into refining techniques and reach the middle stage of Golden Core.</p><p>Qin Sang instructed Xie An to take Shen Chen to cultivate and turned to enter his cave.</p><p>Inside the cave.</p><p>His avatar continuously absorbed Cold煞 Qi from the mysterious ice disc.</p><p>Sensing the arrival of its original body, the avatar stopped cultivating. The second Nascent Soul flew out from the crown of its head and returned to Qin Sang's body. While nurturing it, Qin Sang also learned of the avatar's progress.</p><p>A moment later, a look of pleasant surprise flashed in Qin Sang's eyes.</p><p>The avatar's progress was slower than expected, and it still hadn't mastered the Ice Soul Divine Light.</p><p>However, the reason wasn't a bottleneck.</p><p>In fact, after the avatar started absorbing Cold煞 Qi, coupled with its previous profound accumulation, its progress in this Daoist art had been very smooth.</p><p>The reason it took so long was that while cultivating the Daoist art, the avatar spent day and night with the mysterious ice disc and made new discoveries.</p><p>After obtaining the mysterious ice disc, Qin Sang had an idea. Since this treasure could assist in cultivating the Ice Soul Divine Light, could it also be helpful to the avatar's cultivation technique?</p><p>With this thought, the avatar tested it during cultivation and unexpectedly made progress!</p><p>The avatar first absorbed the Ice Soul Essence, then refined two Kan Mirage Pearls. The original body had also been intermittently cultivating during these years of seclusion and had reached the peak of the middle stage of Nascent Soul.</p><p>The avatar was different from Liu Li.</p><p>Liu Li's cultivation had already reached the threshold, but due to being plagued by the evil technique, her state of mind was unstable, and she couldn't break through. After sealing her emotions with the Ice Soul technique, her own Dao path became closely tied to the Ice Soul Divine Light. At the moment she mastered the divine ability, she suppressed her inner demons and forcefully broke through.</p><p>For the avatar, the Ice Soul Divine Light was merely a Daoist art.</p><p>Qin Sang knew that the late stage of Nascent Soul was a major hurdle and didn't expect the avatar to break through quickly. He originally planned to focus on his original body first and slowly seek opportunities for the avatar, but unexpectedly found an opportunity from the mysterious ice disc.</p><p>Worthy of being a treasure brought into the tomb by the Water Phase Lord, the mysterious ice disc truly was a rare treasure!</p><p>Of course, what the avatar sensed now was only an opportunity. It still needed to master the Ice Soul Divine Light and gain a certain level of control over Cold煞 Qi before it could deduce the cultivation technique and sort out its clues.</p><p>For the next few years, Qin Sang's original body also stayed in the Clear Void Illusion Realm.</p><p>He secluded himself for a full seven years.</p><p>Both the original body and the avatar remained within the cave.</p><p>Two figures sat facing each other within the cave, the mysterious ice disc floating near the avatar, and the Heaven's Eye Butterfly resting beside Qin Sang. The aura of Demonic Fire and Near-Dragon Saliva alternately emerged.</p><p>The three entities each focused on their own tasks, undisturbed.</p><p>For seven years, this scene remained almost unchanged.</p><p>Suddenly, the original body seemed to sense something and abruptly opened its eyes, sharp light shooting out as it stared intently at the avatar's hands.</p><p>Then the Heaven's Eye Butterfly reacted, as if waking from a dream. It looked at the avatar in a daze, instinctively rubbed its wings against Qin Sang's original body, then returned to focusing on refining the energy of the Near-Dragon Saliva.</p><p>At some point, the avatar had placed its hands together on its knees, palms cupped like a crescent moon. Ice Soul Divine Light power gathered in its palms, giving rise to a thick, cold mist.</p><p>If Qin Sang had seen Liu Li's breakthrough, he would have immediately noticed the difference.</p><p>The commotion Liu Li caused back then was much smaller than the avatar's, with only a layer of cold air.</p><p>Now, the avatar's entire body was almost enveloped in a thick cold mist, its figure barely visible. Part of the mist was caused by the Ice Soul Divine Light affecting the environment, but most of it was the manifestation of Cold煞 Qi!</p><p>As time passed, the avatar gradually gathered the cold mist, finally converging it all into its palms and merging it into the Ice Soul Divine Light.</p><p>It held a snow-white ice ball in its hand, not transparent at all.</p><p>Holding the snow-white ice ball, the avatar silently chanted incantations. The mysterious ice disc trembled slightly, and wisps of Cold煞 Qi were drawn out from within, drifting toward the avatar.</p><p>To be precise, they drifted toward the ice ball in the avatar's hand and merged into it without any obstruction.</p><p>Since the beginning of its seclusion, the avatar's actions had always been cautious. This was the first time it acted so boldly, drawing in a large amount of Cold煞 Qi.</p><p>The temperature within the cave plummeted, becoming extremely cold.</p><p>'Whoosh...'</p><p>The wind howled.</p><p>The original body didn't feel the fierce cold wind; the sound came from the ice ball in the avatar's hand.</p><p>At this moment, a small cold air storm formed within the ice ball, filled with incredibly violent power. If it exploded, it would be enough to destroy the cave!</p><p>Soon, the surface of the ice ball began to distort, gradually transforming into a white vortex. The vast Cold煞 Qi was confined within the vortex, and one could see with the naked eye how unstable its power was.</p><p>Even so, the avatar didn't stop, concentrating on the vortex in its palm, continuously merging in more Cold煞 Qi.</p><p>The wind howled louder and louder, echoing in the small cave.</p><p>Cold air began to leak from the vortex's arms, a sign of imminent collapse!</p><p>Finally, the avatar let out a low shout, its internal Qi fluctuating. The vortex abruptly contracted!</p><p>A breathtaking scene unfolded. The violent energy on the verge of eruption was forcibly compressed, shrinking from the size of a palm to a white dot, which was instantly absorbed into the avatar's body.</p><p>In the next moment, the avatar's body trembled, an unusual cold light erupting from the depths of its eyes.</p><p>The original body shifted its gaze to the avatar's face, poised and ready.</p><p>The avatar's aura rose and fell, as if a tempest raged within its body. The cold light in its eyes grew increasingly intense until its eyeballs turned completely white, as if sealed by profound ice.</p><p>'Whoosh...'</p><p>After a moment of silence, the avatar let out a long breath. The cold light in its eyes quickly receded, returning to normal, and its aura also calmed down.</p><p>Seeing this, the original body's expression softened, and a smile appeared.</p><p>The Ice Soul Divine Light was finally mastered!</p><p>After adjusting its breath, the avatar returned to normal and awoke from its meditative state. It walked out of the cave with the original body, silently chanting incantations. White cold light surged in its eyes, and its eyeballs instantly turned white.</p><p>Exactly the same as before.</p><p>'Swoosh!'</p><p>A white light suddenly appeared in the void, instantly erupting and freezing a large area of space.</p><p>The frozen area was filled with dense Cold煞 Qi, the power so great that even Shen Chen, who was cultivating on the other side of the Clear Void Illusion Realm, sensed it.</p><p>The avatar and the original body exchanged glances.</p><p>The Ice Soul Divine Light had indeed been completely transformed, losing the concealment aspect of the original version, but the speed at which the divine light erupted surpassed Liu Li's, and its power was greater.</p><p>Both advantages and disadvantages.</p><p>...</p><p>Next.</p><p>The avatar continued to cultivate in seclusion in the Clear Void Illusion Realm.</p><p>Qin Sang's original plan was to let the avatar go out and act after mastering the Ice Soul Divine Light and greatly increasing its strength, carrying the Gu God Token and attempting to contact the Gu God Cult.</p><p>Since it sensed the opportunity for a breakthrough, cultivation naturally took priority.</p><p>With sufficient strength, it didn't need to fear too many things, making it easier to act.</p><p>Once the original body refined the Near-Dragon Saliva and the Demonic Fire Origin, and both the Heaven's Eye Butterfly and the avatar broke through, the original body and the avatar combined would be two great cultivators who had mastered top-tier divine abilities and possessed spirit treasures.</p><p>Below the Deity Transformation stage, they would be virtually invincible!</p><p>This temptation was irresistible to anyone, unless there were new developments in the few major matters he was most concerned about. Otherwise, Qin Sang's choice would definitely be to continue cultivating in seclusion.</p><p>After mastering the Ice Soul Divine Light, the avatar devoted all its energy to cultivation, starting from scratch to comb through the Clear Subtlety Record, searching for points of harmony between the cultivation technique and Cold煞 Qi, exploring opportunities for a breakthrough.</p><p>The original body would occasionally go out, instructing Shen Chen and maintaining contact with the Six Continents Hall.</p><p>After his night talk with Qin Sang, Mu Tongshu secretly mobilized the Six Continents Hall's resources to investigate the origin of the meteorite fragments.</p><p>However, as the盂兰盆 Festival approached, the Six Continents Hall, as a merchant association, needed to devote all its efforts to preparing for this grand event and couldn't spare too many people. The investigation hadn't made much progress.</p><p>Qin Sang knew that he couldn't rush things, so he didn't press the issue and also turned his attention to the盂兰盆 Festival.</p><p>This盂兰盆 Festival not only stirred the hearts of Central Plains cultivators, but from the Northern Wilderness in the north to the Western Desert in the west, the entire cultivation world's gaze would be focused on Jinyu Prefecture.</p><p>In the cultivation world, stability was never the norm.</p><p>Without Deity Transformation cultivators to deter them, although it wouldn't shake the status of the Eight Sceneries Sect and the Ganlu Zen Monastery or change the landscape of the Central Plains, the resurfacing of hidden dangers was inevitable.</p><p>Countless schemers lurked in the shadows.</p><p>All sorts of chaos would occur.</p><p>This was precisely the opportunity Qin Sang had been waiting for.</p><p>When the time was ripe, the original body and the avatar would emerge, and he could strategize and stir up the storm!</p><p>Spring passed and autumn arrived.</p><p>The plants in the Clear Void Illusion Realm would also change with the seasons, experiencing growth and decay.</p><p>No matter how the cultivation world changed, it wouldn't affect the small Fudù County for the time being. The Xie family and Loutai Monastery supported each other and continued to flourish.</p><p>The strength of Pu Mountain and Loutai Monastery steadily increased, and new Golden Core cultivators emerged among the younger generation. Whenever someone was close to breaking through, they would be sent to the Clear Void Illusion Realm.</p><p>They knew that this was where the ancestor cultivated in seclusion and were very cautious, curious about the two forbidden areas within the Clear Void Illusion Realm.</p><p>One was Qin Sang's cave.</p><p>The other was the pavilion where Shen Chen cultivated, which only Xie An was allowed to approach.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't want anyone to connect his original body and avatar for the time being.</p><p>"If only it could always be so peaceful!"</p><p>Most disciples thought this way, but the occasional tragedies coming from the north reminded them that killing always existed, just not yet reaching Pu Mountain.</p><p>...</p><p>"I almost forgot about the盂兰盆 Festival..."</p><p>A soft sigh echoed within the cave.</p><p>Qin Sang's original body awoke from its meditative state and put away the fire lotus and demonic banner.</p><p>The Heaven's Eye Butterfly, losing its source of Near-Dragon Saliva energy, also leisurely awoke, transforming back into an ordinary butterfly and returning to Qin Sang's dantian.</p><p>Calculating the time, the盂兰盆 Festival was about to begin.</p><p>He turned to look at the avatar.</p><p>The avatar was still focused on deducing the cultivation technique, wisps of Cold煞 Qi swirling around its fingertips. It had made considerable progress compared to when it first entered seclusion over a decade ago, but it was still a bit short.</p><p>The same was true for the original body, having only refined about half of the Near-Dragon Saliva.</p><p>That was why he hadn't attended any of the recent Treasure Exchange Meetings or auctions.</p><p>However, the盂兰盆 Festival couldn't be missed, and Qin Sang prepared to go there in advance.</p><p>He walked out of the cave and summoned Xie An.</p><p>"Has Bu Nian Shan sent anyone?" Qin Sang asked.</p><p>Xie An shook his head, "This disciple recently inquired with other sects in Zhuozhou, but none of them could contact Bu Nian Shan."</p><p>Qin Sang was somewhat surprised, "What are Situ Yu and Lu Zhang doing? Is Bu Nian Shan really going to close itself off for a hundred years and completely abandon its interests in the盂兰盆 Festival?"</p><p>He originally intended to have the avatar attend the盂兰盆 Festival with Bu Nian Shan, using the identity of the Xie family ancestor, so it would be justifiable.</p><p>If Bu Nian Shan insisted on closing itself off, and the avatar went alone, it might be targeted by Bu Nian Shan's enemies and face inevitable provocations.</p><p>He had to switch to his original body and go through the Six Continents Hall.</p><p>To avoid being ambushed again, Qin Sang had the avatar interrupt its cultivation this time as well. The second Nascent Soul returned to his original body, and they set off together.</p><p>He didn't rush to Jinyu Prefecture but first went to Feiyun Ferry.</p><p>Jiang Mu happened to be at Feiyun Ferry.</p><p>As soon as the two met, Jiang Mu couldn't stop smiling.</p><p>"Elder Qin, your timing couldn't be better! The Hall has a batch of treasures that need to be transported to Jinyu Prefecture for auction. The three Hall Masters are all unavailable, and I've been worried about the lack of manpower... The north isn't very peaceful right now!"</p><p>Qin Sang chuckled, "Brother Jiang, you haven't been waiting for me this whole time, have you?"</p><p>Jiang Mu sighed, "These times are truly more chaotic than before. I've been feeling uneasy lately! Even during the most stable periods, the merchant association has been robbed several times. The most vicious incident involved not only the goods being stolen, but over a hundred people on the ship were killed. The Hall Master was furious and personally pursued the culprits into the Western Desert, slaying them all and sending a warning throughout Zhongzhou!"</p><p>The Six Continents Hall was the least willing to see the stability of the Central Plains disrupted.</p><p>The two talked as they flew towards the treasure ship docked on the north bank of Feiyun Ferry.</p><p>"Are there any changes to the proceedings of this盂兰盆 Festival?" Qin Sang glanced westward, towards the Ganlu Zen Monastery.</p><p>The procedures of past Dharma Assemblies were largely the same.</p><p>If there were sudden changes this time, the Ganlu Zen Monastery definitely had other motives.</p><p>"There are some differences from before."</p><p>Jiang Mu assumed Qin Sang was concerned about trading opportunities and carefully explained,</p><p>"This Dharma Assembly will have two major auctions, three days before and after the assembly, both hosted by Jinyu Gate. Jinyu Gate is indeed wealthy, and it's said they'll be bringing out many rare treasures, not to be missed.</p><p>"Because of this, there aren't any major Treasure Exchange Meetings before the first auction; everyone is preparing for it.</p><p>"Three days after the first auction ends, the Dharma Assembly officially begins. The procedures are still the same as before, with competitions and debates on alchemy, artifact refining, talismans, formations, and Buddhist scriptures, etc., which have little to do with us. We can just treat it as entertainment.</p><p>"During the days of the Dharma Assembly, there will be Treasure Exchange Meetings every night. Vice Hall Master Jiang You will compile a list at that time.</p><p>"For the Treasure Exchange Meeting hosted by our Hall, we hope Elder Qin can attend and deter any troublemakers.</p><p>"There's another special aspect of this Dharma Assembly. Rumors of the disappearance of Deity Transformation cultivators have been circulating for many years, and some hidden factions might resurface.  I expect the Treasure Exchange Meetings won't just be about trading treasures; some people will be forming alliances in secret. If Elder Qin doesn't want to be involved, please don't make any promises lightly..."</p>
