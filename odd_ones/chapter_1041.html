    “So, this is what the [Spirit Instrument]’s benefits are.”
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    Han Xiao’s eyes sparkled.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    [Spirit Instrument] was a class talent he obtained by default after
            becoming a Divine Throne Mechanic, which was only effective when
            building Universal Treasures. When successful, it would give
            bonuses. This was his first time seeing the exact bonuses it gave,
            and he was pleasantly surprised.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    Previously, Han Xiao did not if there were any other ways to obtain
            God’s Trait Transformation Points, but now he had found one—building
            Universal Treasures.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    The same blueprint would not provide multiple points, meaning even
            if he built another gold-grade King mechanical suit, he would not
            receive more God’s Trait Transformation Points. Hence, he needed to
            get more gold blueprints.
   </p>
   <div class="chapter-c">
    <div class="chapter-c">
    </div>
   </div>
   <p class="calibre5">
    Han Xiao was curious. There were other Beyond Grade A Mechanics who
            had built Universal Treasures throughout history, but from the
            intelligence provided by the dynasty, this method of obtaining God’s
            Trait Transformation Points was not mentioned.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    He had some speculations.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    Some Beyond Grade As who successfully built Universal Treasures
            probably did not fulfill the prerequisites to obtain God’s Trait
            Transformation Points, so they could not notice this effect. For
            example, Austin.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    As for those who knew, maybe they hid this information for their own
            purposes and did not report it… or the advanced civilizations kept
            this a secret deliberately.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    It could even be that he was the only one who could obtain God’s
            Trait Transformation Points through this method because the other
            Beyond Grade As did not have the interface!
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    Of course, it could also be that the dynasty did not know about this
            but the other two Universal Civilizations did. After all, the three
            Universal Civilizations were not a family; they would not share
            their secrets.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    “The problems I’m facing now at this level are finally touching the
            blind spots of the Universal Civilizations… Makes sense. The dynasty
            doesn’t know about the First Sanctum too.”
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    Han Xiao shook his head.
   </p>
   <div class="chapter-c">
    <div class="chapter-c">
    </div>
   </div>
   <p class="calibre5">
    “I still have the Emperor’s Cape blueprint in my hands. If I’m able
            to build it, I’ll obtain another God’s Trait Transformation Point.
            Indeed, becoming stronger through building things is the best way
            for Mechanics.”
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    As for the randomly decreased Attribute Points that were changed
            into Free Attribute Points, it was similar to resetting attributes.
            After every level up, Race Evolution, or Promotion, all attributes
            would automatically be increased. This would shift some of the
            Attribute Points in less important attributes to the main attribute,
            slowly making him stronger, which was quite useful.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    Han Xiao felt that this could be triggered repeatedly but probably
            had a limit. Maybe the number of points reduced and given was
            related to the difficulty of building the Universal Treasure. The
            more difficult it was, the more points would be affected.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    Furthermore, following the logic of the increased cost of blueprint
            gambling… if he built the same Universal Treasure multiple times,
            the points should decrease slowly too. For example, King reset two
            hundred of his Attribute Points the first time, but the second time
            might be less than two hundred.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    “By the way, this time, it actually decreased my Luck…”
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    Han Xiao opened the attribute interface and looked at his Luck,
            which turned from a stick to an egg. His mouth twitched
            uncontrollably.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    In his previous life, players with the subclass [Gambler] had tested
            that the lowest the Luck attribute could go was zero. It was the
            bottom line. To Gamblers, it meant this put them at an ‘unbeatable’
            spot.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    He previously only had one Luck, which had decreased to zero, and
            then he obtained two hundred Free Attribute Points…
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    “So, I basically netted 199 Attribute Points‽
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    “I don’t know if this is lucky or unlucky…”
   </p>
   <div class="chapter-c">
    <div class="chapter-c">
    </div>
   </div>
   <p class="calibre5">
    Han Xiao was speechless.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    Although it was an amazing deal, he could not smile. Tears were
            running in his belly.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    “Sometimes, you only realize how precious something is when you have
            already lost it.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    “Brother, I can’t do without you. It cannot be zero!”
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    The Great Mechanic Han clenched his teeth and solemnly pressed on
            the “+” button beside his Luck attribute…
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    +1.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    The next moment, the value of his Luck attribute returned to that
            noble, pure, magnificent, and holy ‘1’.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    Han Xiao almost felt like his soul had ascended.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    Actually, Han Xiao was mainly worried that if his Luck was zero, the
            next time an attribute reset came, Luck would not be considered in
            the range of attributes.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    He looked depressed, but he was actually overjoyed and wanted it to
            happen to him more.
   </p>
   <div class="chapter-c">
    <div class="chapter-c">
    </div>
   </div>
   <p class="calibre5">
    “In addition to what I have in my interface, I now have 2,248 Free
            Attribute Points. My Endurance is now more than 11,700, and as long
            as it exceeds 15,000, I will be able to obtain one more God’s Trait
            Transformation Point through the next Promotion… Hmm, let’s save it
            for now.”
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    Suppressing his excitement, Han Xiao looked at his attributes
            interface, pondered a while, and used the one God’s Trait
            Transformation Point on [God’s Trait Transformation—Machinery].
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    Machinery and Void represented his main class and species; the
            transformation paths of these two should be mostly the same for
            everyone. Through testing, the former enhanced his Mechanic
            abilities, and the latter strengthened his Racial Talents and gave
            him bonus attributes.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    Since he now had [Spirit Instrument] as a method to obtain God’s
            Trait Transformation Points, he would have to invent more gold
            blueprints, which would require strong Mechanic abilities. Not only
            did the main class path increase his basic Machinery Affinity and
            ability strength, it also slightly enhanced the effects of his
            various Mechanic abilities.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    The next moment, his cells operated at full capacity. His energy
            waves increased drastically, and electric sparks appeared from all
            over his body. His flesh and bones were both itching and hurting,
            which made him narrow his eyes a little.

    Stage Two (New): +15% building, enhancing, repairing abilities, +1%

   <p class="calibre5">
    “Not bad.”
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    Han Xiao scratched his chin. He felt like this was not as good as
            the first enhancement. It might be that the first stage was like a
            welcoming gift and was an exception, while the later stages would
            keep getting better.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    Then, he looked at the new talent, [Universal Treasure Creator]. Its
            introduction was that building a Universal Treasure meant that he
            had touched a certain new level. Its effect was +10% Machinery
            Creation Performance, +1 level to all machinery abilities, +4% basic
            success rate of building gold equipment, and +2% basic success rate
            of inventing gold blueprints.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    Its effects were quite good, but Han Xiao’s attention was attracted
            by the notification that came with this talent.
   </p>
   <div class="chapter-c">

   <p class="calibre5">
    “This so-called The First Sanctum again…”
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    An electric spark flashed past Han Xiao’s eyes.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    He now had two Ability Fragments, and he still did not know what use
            they had, but since they were so difficult to obtain, it was
            definitely something important.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    Without any clues, there was no point in overthinking. Han Xiao put
            the thought away and looked at the Legendary Point given.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    _____________________

   <p class="calibre5">
    “Speaking of which, since I have the core technology, if I build
            more Kings and sell them, I can make quite a lot of money.”
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    Han Xiao smiled at this thought.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    He was just thinking about it. There was no way he would exchange
            his trump card for money; he now had no interest in money.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    After making sure he had gone through all the new things he had
            obtained on the attributes interface, Han Xiao finally looked at the
            gold Grade King mechanical suit closely.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    At this point, it was not yet colored. The appearance of King was a
            magnificent full cover style mechanical armor. The details on every
            piece of its plates were exceptionally exquisite, giving off the
            beauty of a top-class mechanical product. It was like a piece of
            art.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    A palm-sized triangular device was embedded on its chest and was
            glowing slightly. This was the King mechanical suit’s only set
            attachment, Throne. As long as it was taken off, no matter where it
            was placed, the King would be able to instantly arrive at its place.
            Its effect was comparable to the Multi-Dimensional Sky Opening
            Transportation Device.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    Performance-wise, naturally, it was far superior to orange equipment
            in every way. As equipment specially made for Beyond Grade A
            Mechanics, it provided a 1.075 multiplier to the wearer’s total
            Machinery Affinity, as well as a thirty-five percent bonus to the
            effective area of Mechanical Force enhancement. It was a mechanical
            suit that was top-notch even among Beyond Grade A equipment.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    Han Xiao immediately put it on like an old driver who had just
            bought a new car, tested it with excitement, and recorded the
            various parameters. Only then did he reluctantly stow it away.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    “If the mechanical suit I was using last time was a home-use
            Volkswagen, King would be a Pagani, Koenigsegg, or a Bugatti sports
            car.”
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    Han Xiao was very satisfied.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    After organizing all his gains, he ordered the mechanical assistants
            to clean up the workshop while he set the Divine Mechanical Throne
            to lazy sofa mode.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    He leaned back and opened the forums comfortably, planning to reward
            himself by looking at those idiotic players.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    In Version 4.0, the player forums had made some changes and updates.
            It added the new Flickering World panel, which was like a world
            channel to the players.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    As more and more people arrived, the popularity of the Flickering
            World panel exceeded all the other panels in no time, quickly
            becoming the most active channel on the forums.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    Han Xiao flipped through the posts for a while and saw Bun-Hit-Dog’s
            newly released video.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    The Black Star Army series got a new episode again. Its content was
            what the army had done during the version update, and its views
            seemed to have broken records again.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    He clicked in and watched it. This was not really the best episode
            ever, but since tons of players had joined the Black Star Army, more
            people came to learn about the Black Star Army’s history, hence the
            explosive increase in the view count of even the videos posted in
            the past.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    Ever since Version 1.0, Bun-Hit-Dog had been making series videos,
            which already had many episodes by now. The new players could
            binge-watch from the start and learn about the complete rise of the
            Black Star Army. As a super faction that grew before the eyes of the
            players, it could give them a strong sense of immersion.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    Most of the foreign players who had joined the army came for the
            benefits and did not have any sense of belonging at all. However,
            learning the history of a faction could slowly build up their unity,
            and Bun-Hit-Dog’s series videos played a huge part in that, like
            fertilizer.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    “Ideology construction has to be heeded. They need to be given more
            knowledge about the Black Star Army so that the players will feel
            the warmth of a home.”
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    While mumbling, Han Xiao continued to flip through the posts.
            Suddenly, he saw that someone had made a post to expose the
            Limitless Financial Group.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    The content was shockingly the spying mission given by Sorokin,
            which required players to purchase intelligence from Black Star Army
            players.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    The Limitless Financial Group actually kept this secret very well.
            At least Han Xiao did not know about it through other sources.
            Sadly, the players sold Sorokin out on the forums.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    It’s probably more difficult for me not to know…
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    Han Xiao’s mouth contorted slightly.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    The player forums were a special information exchange platform; no
            outsider could interfere with it. However, he could browse it, which
            gave him an incomparable intelligence advantage that currently only
            he had.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    To him, players were a natural free intelligence network. Even if he
            did nothing and sat at home, the player forums would continuously
            provide intelligence about the other organizations.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    Currently, the Limitless Financial Group was the organization that
            was most passionate about recruiting the players other than himself.
            That unlucky b*stard wanted to use the players as his spies but had
            no idea that he was exposed by the players instead, and Han Xiao did
            not have to pay the price for it.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    The joy of having privileges has always been this simple and dull.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    Thinking of Sorokin’s face that was clearly covered in plots and
            conspiracies, Han Xiao almost wanted to laugh.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    Might as well let the army players accept his mission, then sell
            some intelligence to take Sorokin’s money for free. He’s that rich
            anyway.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    While Han Xiao was having these wicked ideas, he suddenly saw a very
            popular post title, and his attention was pulled over immediately.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    ‘The Army Players’ Corpses Have Been Camped Time After Time. Who Is
            Targeting the Black Star Army‽’
