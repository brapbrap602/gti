Chapter 183: News Arrives

The five elements of Yin were ready, and the Earth Sha gas was enough, but one thing was still missing – a monster soul.

A naturally formed Corpse Fiend was nurtured in Yin energy for many years, and transforming from a Zombie to a Corpse Fiend took a very long time. In this process, spirituality would be born on its own. After the strength increased further, the Corpse Fiend would awaken its intelligence, just like a human cultivator.

Refining a corpse was different. Elder Baiyun had only recently died, and the five elements of Yin and the Earth Sha gas could not give the refined corpse spirituality.

If there was no spiritual Corpse Fiend, then it would be no different from a dead thing.

In a real battle, Qin Sang could not always control the Corpse Fiend. More often, he had to let it act based on instinct. Therefore, it needed to be given spirituality when it was refined.

There was a soul refining technique in the 《Celestial Corpse Scripture》, where a spell would attract a living soul during the refining process. The living soul would then be refined together with the corpse, and when the refinement was complete, the Corpse Fiend would be given spirituality.

Of course, refining a living corpse did not require this step.

The living soul of a human cultivator’s primordial spirit was best, but a monster’s soul could also be used. The strength of the monster had no strict requirements. When Qin Sang travelled to Mingqin Island, he had also collected some, but it was not enough.

He left the Sunken Hole and went deep into the Cloudmist Marshlands, spending a few days collecting enough monster souls before preparing to return to his cave, to go into seclusion and refine his corpse. However, he saw a sound transmission talisman in Huilong Temple. It had been left by Grandma Jing.

‘There is news of what Fellow Daoist Qin needs. Come quickly after reading this!’

Qin Sang was overjoyed when he saw the sound transmission talisman’s message. He had not had much hope, because the secret shop’s circle was too small, with only a few people. Furthermore, most of them were Qi Refining cultivators. The chances of getting good news from Sky痕 Pavilion and Senior Brother Wen were greater. He had not expected Grandma Jing to be the one to surprise him with good news.

Everything had to make way for the news of the Sacred Spring object. After some thought, Qin Sang took out the magic tools that he had hidden in his cave and carried them with him.

Grandma Jing had been unclear in her sound transmission talisman’s message. He did not know if the Sacred Spring object was in a secret place’s ruins, or whether someone had collected it and wanted to sell it.

If it was hidden in a secret place, then it was possible that someone wanted to sell the information, and the price would not be too high. After buying it, Qin Sang planned to return to the cave, refine a Corpse Fiend helper, and then explore the secret place based on its circumstances.

If someone was directly selling the object, then it would be hard to say. Even though his wealth was not bad, it was not certain that it would satisfy the other party’s price. After all, Sacred Spring objects were very rare. Such transactions were extremely rare in the cultivation world, and there was no fixed price, so it all depended on the agreement of the two parties. However, no matter how high the other party’s price, he would have to pay it.

If it really did not work, then he would go far away, avoid Shaohua Mountain’s informants, and sell these magic tools.

After making up his mind, Qin Sang flew on his sword at full speed, and when he entered Taobambu Inn, he saw Grandma Jing sitting at the shop’s entrance. A bunch of peach blossoms were scattered around her feet, and she was holding a section of peach wood and carefully carving it with a small knife. Her expression was extremely focused.

She did not use a single bit of spiritual energy, and even her physical strength was very weak. She was completely relying on her technique to carve the object, but the finished product was exquisite, like a work of art.

These peach branches were also mortal wood, looking a bit like Sword Gate Pass’s Crimson Jade Peaches. However, if you looked closely, there were actually many differences.

Qin Sang stood to the side, waiting for Grandma Jing to finish carving before bowing slightly. He explained, “Greetings to Grandma Jing. Please forgive me, Grandma Jing. I’ve been travelling outside the entire time and only returned to Huilong Temple and saw the sound transmission talisman. I came here immediately.”

“Hmm.”

Grandma Jing placed the finished product on the counter, raised her head, and slowly said, “Fortunately, Fellow Daoist Qin arrived in time, otherwise they would have returned tonight. Fellow Daoist Qin, please wait. This old woman will have them return immediately.”

Sisters?

Two women?

Qin Sang muttered to himself and apologized to Grandma Jing before walking to the back of Taobambu Inn.

Taobambu Inn only sold some handicrafts that were made of peach blossoms or bamboo. However, this was Qin Sang’s third visit, and it was the first time that he had seen Grandma Jing working. He only found out now that she had made them herself.

These finished products were very exquisite, but they were also very expensive. Ordinary people could not afford such expensive decorations, and coupled with the remote location, business was very poor.

Qin Sang glanced around and saw that only two pieces had been sold over the past few days. Of course, Grandma Jing certainly did not care about that.

The secret shop is in the back hall of Taozhu Pavilion. It is actually a large hall with simple bamboo chairs inside. Qin Sang sat down to wait patiently. Within less than fifteen minutes, he heard footsteps from outside. Grandma Jing entered with two young women.

The two women looked about thirty years old. They were not exceptional-looking but pretty enough. Their faces bore a resemblance and they looked like close sisters.

The woman walking in front was slightly taller with a cultivation of Qi Refining Layer Eleven. The one behind her was one realm lower.

Qin Sang was relieved after seeing their cultivation. Two Qi Refining cultivators should not have big appetites.

He could tell that the two women were very respectful of Grandma Jing. As Grandma Jing walked in front, she pointed at Qin Sang and said, “This is the Qin Sang fellow-cultivator I told you about.”

She said to Qin Sang, “They are the Le sisters. The one with the higher cultivation is the elder sister, Le Xing, and the other is the younger sister, Le Rou.”

Qin Sang smiled and cupped his hands in greeting. “Greetings Fellow Cultivators.”

The two women exchanged glances and returned the greeting. “We dare not. Le Xing and Le Rou pay respects to Senior Qin.”

Grandma Jing coughed slightly. “Fellow Cultivator Qin, their father was also a member of the secret shop. You two need not stand on ceremony. Just state your needs directly instead of beating around the bush. I’ll be here to bear witness and will not interfere. It’s up to you two to discuss whether this deal will happen or not.”

With that, Grandma Jing glanced at Qin Sang.

Qin Sang’s heart skipped a beat. He knew that Grandma Jing was silently warning him. She loathed infighting among members of the secret shop.

The three of them sat down opposite each other. Grandma Jing faked sleep at the side. Qin Sang went straight to the point. “Fellow Cultivators, I am looking for a dried-up Spirit Spring. Ideally, the Spirit Spring should have dried up on its own, but one that was destroyed by external forces would suffice. Grandma Jing sent a message, saying the two of you have news of such a treasure?”

After listening to Qin Sang, the elder sister, Le Xing, replied straightforwardly, “Senior Qin, not only do we have news of it but we also have one in our possession.”

He did not expect them to have one already, saving him time and energy having to go elsewhere.

Qin Sang was overjoyed, but he kept his face calm. “Since the two of you asked Grandma to inform me, you must have intended to trade it. I wonder what you would like in exchange for it?”

Le Xing and Le Rou exchanged glances. Hesitation showed on their faces as they bit their lips. “We would like a cave abode with a Spirit Eye.”
