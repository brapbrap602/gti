<h1>Chapter 1191: The Lifeless Demon Seal</h1><p>Chapter 1191: The Lifeless Demon Seal</p><p>Qin Sang had tried to study the item himself, but to no avail.  The artifact's restrictions and the spirit array runes were unlike anything he had ever seen. Bai was diligently refining the Corpse Soul Pearl, and it was unclear how long it would take him to advance, leaving no time to repair the Binding Demon Rope.</p><p>Qing Jun accepted the Binding Demon Rope and the jade slip containing the spirit array's imprint. After examining them, she remained silent for a long time, silently pondering and studying the array diagram.</p><p>“In the ancient forbidden area of Ziwei Palace, I obtained a fragment of an ancient scripture. Some of the runes within are remarkably similar to this spirit array. I have been studying the scripture and have made considerable progress. The runes on this imprint are clearly visible. Given some time, I may be able to restore the array.”</p><p>Qin Sang was delighted.  “Senior Sister, please take it. I hope you can decipher it soon.” He didn't care whether he or his senior sister controlled the Binding Demon Rope.  It was useless in his hands.  Even when Bai advanced, it would still be many years. This treasure could only be used against ancient demons, making its use very limited.</p><p>The greatest current threat came from the ancient demons potentially lurking behind the Abyss of Sin.  Dealing with them was a shared goal between him and Senior Sister Qing Jun; it didn't matter who wielded it. Besides, his Senior Sister's cultivation was higher than his, so she could utilize it far more effectively.  She had already given him the banners.</p><p>The Demon Sealing Stake and the Binding Demon Rope shared the same origin; its restrictions were far denser and more complex than the Rope, indicating a higher order. Once Senior Sister restored the Binding Demon Rope array, he could learn from it to study its coordination with the Demon Sealing Stake.  Later, after refining all the Nine Netherworld Demon Fires, he could repair the Demon Sealing Stake and possess a similar treasure, even more powerful. It was a win-win situation.</p><p>“You’re quite generous,” Qing Jun said, glancing up, but she didn’t refuse.  After all, repairing the Binding Demon Rope benefited them both.</p><p>After a moment’s thought, Qing Jun produced a jade slip and tossed it to Qin Sang.  “You exchanged a nearly complete Binding Demon Rope for a few broken banners?  This contains a breakthrough secret technique called the ‘Lifeless Demon Seal.’”</p><p>Qin Sang quickly caught the jade slip. He understood his Senior Sister's nature.  As she had said before, she pursued the immortal path, acting according to her own heart, viewing others as mere passersby in the mortal realm.  While it sounded detached, truly achieving it was far from easy.  Only by resolving all karmic entanglements and remaining guiltless could one truly be free.  How many truly detached individuals existed in the entire cultivation world?</p><p>Qin Sang knew he couldn't achieve such detachment. Because of Elder Qingzhu, their relationship was closer than with others, but they were not yet at the point of freely sharing everything.  Furthermore, the contents of the jade slip gave him no reason to refuse.  Each breakthrough secret technique was incredibly precious.</p><p>“A breakthrough secret technique? It’s also useful for Nascent Soul cultivators?” Qin Sang was overjoyed, eager to examine it with his divine sense.</p><p>Qing Jun continued, “Wait. Let me warn you: The Lifeless Demon Seal can be cultivated below the Transformation God realm, but it can only be used once in a lifetime.  It carries extreme risks and is easily exploited, even by Nascent Soul cultivators.  The creator of this evil technique was undoubtedly insane. Unless absolutely necessary, you must not cultivate it; just study it for reference. I foolishly tried to use the Lifeless Demon Seal to break through to the Nascent Soul stage and was plagued by its repercussions for hundreds of years, nearly facing utter ruin.  Only recently have I truly resolved the issue…”</p><p>Qin Sang's heart shuddered. His Senior Sister, with her extraordinary talent, hadn't solved the problem for hundreds of years, revealing the immense danger of this evil technique.  He wouldn't act rashly; he carefully put away the jade slip and listened to his Senior Sister’s explanation of this evil technique.</p><p>They then discussed a few other matters. Senior Sister Qing Jun was eager to study the Binding Demon Rope and left after a short while.  Qin Sang closed the side hall, took out the Lifeless Demon Seal, and carefully studied it.</p><p>Soon after, Qin Sang withdrew his divine sense, lost in thought.  His Senior Sister's words were not an exaggeration; the risks of the Lifeless Demon Seal were terrifying, and the cultivation process was even more appalling.  Its creator was undoubtedly mad.</p><p>The process of cultivating the evil technique was the process of condensing the Lifeless Demon Seal.  Upon breakthrough, the seal would form and then shatter, forcing a breakthrough with its power. The shocking truth was that the so-called Lifeless Demon Seal was condensed from one's own inner demons!</p><p>To cultivate the Lifeless Demon Seal, one must meditate day and night on their greatest obsession, nurturing their inner demons and allowing them to grow. During this process, if one is not careful and is devoured by their inner demons, their mind and spirit will be destroyed!  The danger speaks for itself. The sight of this evil technique would chill anyone to the bone.</p><p>Inner demons – one of the greatest fears among cultivators.  Everyone tries to prevent them from arising, yet someone dared to defy this, to cultivate and refine a demonic seal by nurturing an inner demon!</p><p>The most terrifying thing isn't that suppressing the backlash of an inner demon guarantees the successful cultivation of the Lifeless Demon Seal.</p><p>To successfully refine the Lifeless Demon Seal, a cultivator must have a strong obsession.</p><p>Otherwise, the inner demon will inevitably run rampant!</p><p>Qin Sang finally understood Qing Jun's strange behavior.</p><p>Her father disappeared, and her mother died of grief.</p><p>From the beginning of her cultivation, she carried a blood feud, her only obsession being revenge.</p><p>She was extremely talented and cultivated rapidly, but forming a Nascent Soul wasn't something that could be achieved at will.</p><p>So, Qing Jun cultivated the *Lifeless Demon Seal*, nurturing her inner demon with her obsession, solely to personally kill Leng Yuntian.</p><p>At that time, Leng Yuntian showed no signs of forming a Nascent Soul. Qing Jun was confident that once she broke through to the late Golden Core stage, she could certainly kill Leng Yuntian.</p><p>Then she would refine the demonic seal, form her Nascent Soul, kill Leng Qian, and destroy the Yuan Shen Sect!</p><p>Fate is fickle.</p><p>She didn't expect Leng Qian's life to be nearing its end, and before his death, he would do anything to help Leng Yuntian form a Nascent Soul.</p><p>Although Leng Yuntian's Nascent Soul formation was unorthodox, and his strength was inferior to that of a normally formed Nascent Soul, he was still beyond the reach of a Golden Core cultivator, causing Qing Jun to be unable to refine the demonic seal for a long time.</p><p>Even more shocking for Qing Jun was that she spontaneously broke through the Nascent Soul bottleneck, without even using the *Lifeless Demon Seal*.</p><p>She tried every method, made countless preparations, yet she still suffered immensely during the Nascent Soul tribulation. Even worse, even after passing the Nascent Soul tribulation, the inner demon's backlash didn't disappear; it became even more terrifying, almost causing Qing Jun to lose her mind.</p><p>Desperate, Qing Jun had a sudden inspiration. She used her masterful puppetry techniques on herself, sealing her emotions, and refining herself into a heartless puppet. Only then could she barely suppress her inner demon.</p><p>This method solved the immediate crisis, but her cultivation was also sealed. Later, after gaining some proficiency, she could temporarily unseal part of her cultivation, but only for a short time before having to fully suppress her inner demon again.</p><p>She could only use a fragment of her consciousness to inhabit a puppet, using the alias of Jing Po Po, traveling the world, seeking revenge or a solution to her inner demon.</p><p>After that, she met Qin Sang.</p><p>She killed Leng Yuntian at Zi Wei Palace, but because she was so deeply affected by the evil technique, it took until now to completely resolve the issue.</p><p>Qin Sang put aside these thoughts, looking at the jade slip in his hand.</p><p>He certainly didn't fear the backlash of an inner demon.</p><p>…But…</p><p>"I don't have an inner demon!"</p><p>Qin Sang sighed.</p>
