<h1>Chapter 908: Star Platform</h1><p>The rest were miscellaneous items.</p><p>Qin Sang stared at the messy ground, his gaze finally settling on the stone platform. It was the only thing that caught his eye. Although it looked dilapidated, it exuded an unusual aura, clearly an ancient artifact.</p><p>Could this be what the Black Serpent Mountain went through so much trouble to steal?</p><p>The Sky-Eyed Butterfly had been watching; the black-robed man couldn't have given it to anyone else unless he had failed.</p><p>Out of caution, Qin Sang picked up the other items one by one, probing them with his divine sense and true essence. He confirmed they were all ordinary objects, leaving only the stone platform.</p><p>He lifted the platform with his palm and released his true essence, which was completely absorbed by the platform.</p><p>The platform was like a bottomless pit, accepting everything. As the true essence continued to pour in, a faint light emanated from the platform, illuminating Qin Sang's surprised face.</p><p>"This is the power of the celestial stars..."</p><p>Qin Sang's face was full of surprise. "This object can actually connect to the stars on its own!"</p><p>Then, he suddenly realized something. His eyes flashed, and he abruptly increased his true essence, pouring it into the platform continuously. The faint light from the platform only became slightly brighter, and the platform itself didn't change, but the celestial star power grew stronger.</p><p>'Crack!'</p><p>Qin Sang's true essence was almost exhausted. He stopped the infusion and placed the platform on the ground, staring at it with delight. This object might solve his biggest current problem.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang, without taking a break, checked every corner meticulously, countless times.  He even tried attacking the platform with Daoist techniques and magical treasures, but to no avail.</p><p>He found no runes within the platform. It seemed like a pure stone, with no other peculiarities besides its resonance with the celestial stars.</p><p>Qin Sang exhausted all his methods and finally stopped, lost in thought.</p><p>"The Barrier Breakers Sect stored the platform in the Brightmoon Island caverns. Either this object is too important, and moving it would cause an explosion like yesterday's, or they didn't understand its true value, treating it as a tool to aid in cultivating the 'Lightning Manipulation Technique'.</p><p>"But the Black Serpent Mountain's ancestor sent out all his disciples, so he must know its secrets. His painstaking efforts to obtain the platform are definitely not as simple as they appear.</p><p>"Could it be some kind of ancient Witch Tribe treasure, something humans can't activate?</p><p>"It seems the Witch Tribe also has similar secret techniques!  In ancient times, not only was spiritual energy incredibly abundant and heavenly treasures readily available, but talented individuals also emerged constantly.  Each tribe produced countless brilliant cultivators. Unlike now, where every cultivation world is confined to a corner, like a cage."</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head, looking at the platform.</p><p>Then, he summoned the Sky-Eyed Butterfly. After several attempts, he still found nothing. Besides their innate insect Gu and bloodline, Witch Tribe cultivators also possessed something humans lacked: Divine Markings.</p><p>"If only Yagu were awake, she could help me try..."</p><p>Qin Sang murmured, suddenly remembering Yagu, and couldn't help but sigh. The joy of discovering the platform's function diminished somewhat.</p><p>"I'll find another opportunity later.  The Witch Tribe's Divine Marking Dao is almost extinct. I can just grab any low-level Witch Tribe cultivator.  For other human cultivators, unless they cultivate star power, the platform isn't very useful. But it's extremely valuable to me. From now on, I'll call it the Star Platform!"</p><p>Qin Sang gathered his thoughts, his eyes gleaming.</p><p>He discovered that the more true essence he infused, the stronger the celestial star power the platform drew.  With sufficient true essence, it might reach the requirements for Star Essence Infusion.</p><p>"Myself, the Two-Headed Vulture, the Sky-Eyed Butterfly, and the Fat Silkworm, that's four existences at the Core Formation stage. Working together, we should barely be able to meet the requirements. It's a pity I left the Flying Night Devil at the Seven Kill Palace.  But if it's still not enough, I'll find a way to refine a few more. Soul-Attracting Grass is easier to find than Scorpion Venom Grass..."</p><p>Qin Sang estimated in his mind.</p><p>After all, it was only for breaking through the third level of the "Celestial Demon Body Refinement". The requirements shouldn't be too stringent.</p><p>The Star Platform was a significant matter. First, there was the Black Serpent Mountain ancestor, and now the Barrier Breakers Sect's Nascent Soul cultivator must also know its value. Leaking this information could lead to his death, so he couldn't ask for help.</p><p>Fortunately, throughout his cultivation journey, he had learned a lot of unorthodox methods and could actually gather so many helpers himself.</p><p>"I didn't expect to find a solution not from the cultivation technique itself, but from a stone."</p><p>Qin Sang carefully examined the Star Platform.  Even the mottled scars on it seemed pleasing to the eye now. The corners of his mouth curled up slightly, a smile unconsciously appearing on his face.</p><p>From now on, his cultivation would be unimpeded.</p><p>A heavy weight finally lifted from Qin Sang's heart.</p><p>He quickly calmed down and began to consider his situation.</p><p>"This is not a place to stay for long. I should quickly recover through meditation and find a hidden place to lay low.</p><p>"Since I have a direction for the Star Essence Infusion, I don't need to wander around anymore.</p><p>"With the Barrier Breakers Sect and the Black Serpent Mountain after me, I definitely can't go to big cities like Tianxing City. I need a remote or chaotic place where I won't be easily exposed. It also needs ample spiritual energy and can't be occupied by a sect.</p><p>"Such places aren't hard to find in the Demon Sea.</p><p>"In the Inner Sea, almost all places with good spiritual veins are already occupied. Forcibly taking one would only expose me faster. Only the Rain Desert in the North Sea and the Gale Archipelago are suitable.</p><p>"The Rain Desert is in the extreme north of the North Sea, too far away. The journey would take a long time.  And it's extremely desolate. If I encounter any trouble along the way, it would be difficult to buy spiritual materials and medicinal herbs, or find help. It seems I can only go to the Gale Archipelago.</p><p>"The Gale Archipelago is incredibly chaotic; killing is commonplace.  Neither the righteous nor demonic sects have influence there.</p><p>"I won't offend others unless they offend me.  With my strength, it shouldn't be difficult to carve out a place for myself.  After a few decades, when things have calmed down, I can come out again.</p><p>"Also, Senior Qingzhu's cave is there. I might be able to find out some things I didn't know before."</p><p>Qin Sang's thoughts flashed quickly, and he soon decided on his destination.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang couldn't help but sigh.  Perhaps Senior Qingzhu was in a similar situation back then, which forced him to flee to the Gale Archipelago and live incognito for two hundred years?</p><p>By a strange twist of fate, he was now embarking on a similar path as Senior Qingzhu.</p><p>Two people who had never met were inexplicably entangled.</p><p>Qin Sang put away the Star Platform, then burned the remaining worthless items, destroyed the two storage pouches, took out spirit stones, circulated his cultivation technique, and entered meditative recovery.</p><p>An hour later, Qin Sang was back to his peak condition. Under the moonlight, he embarked on his journey westward.</p><p>Along the way, he took turns traveling with the Two-Headed Vulture.</p><p>Besides cultivating the "Celestial Demon Body Refinement", he focused on improving his avatar.</p><p>By the time he reached the waters of the Gale Archipelago, his "Celestial Demon Body Refinement" had reached the late stage of the second level, and his physical strength had increased significantly.</p><p>His avatar had also successfully broken through to the mid-stage of Core Formation, and Nascent Soul formation was just around the corner.</p>
