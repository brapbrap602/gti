<h1>Chapter 1370: The Long Journey</h1><p>“Her primordial spirit seems to be merging with the light; it should be a good thing…”</p><p>Qin Sang’s face showed anticipation.</p><p>Since he issued the bounty from the Northern Star Alliance, he had received many leads over the past three years. Disciples like Li Yu Fu had traveled extensively investigating, and Qin Sang even left seclusion once for this.</p><p>But none of the results were what he sought.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang took out other items from the Qianjun Ring, sifted through them, and pondered what preparations he still needed to make before his departure.</p><p>After some thought, he took out the Jinchen Sword.</p><p>The Jinchen Sword was still a high-grade magic weapon.</p><p>Refining the Solar God Tree had depleted most of Qin Sang’s savings.</p><p>After making a promise to the True Person Cang Hong, he had obtained several precious spiritual objects. Some had already been refined into other items, and a portion was reserved for the Jinchen Sword.</p><p>Qin Sang had a plan. He entered the fire chamber and began to refine the Jinchen Sword again.</p><p>The next day.</p><p>Qin Sang walked out, his expression normal.</p><p>“Unfortunately, it still lacks a bit of refinement! A top-grade magic weapon isn’t so easily refined. I have the Eighteen Demon Banners, so I’m not in a hurry.  Being able to use the Seven Souls Killing Formation is enough. I can travel and gather spiritual objects along the way…”</p><p>Although he hadn’t succeeded, Qin Sang wasn’t discouraged.</p><p>With all preparations complete, he didn’t intend to delay any longer and sent out a stream of light.</p><p>The white cat received the order, turned, and left the valley to relay the message back to Qingyang Temple and Qianshan Bamboo Sea.</p><p>Li Yu Fu happened to be at the sect, while Shangguan Lifeng and others were traveling.</p><p>In a short while, Li Yu Fu and Tan Yi En arrived at Peach Blossom Valley.</p><p>Qin Sang gave them a few instructions.</p><p>Previously, Qin Sang had already discussed it carefully with Jing Yu; there was no need to wait for her.</p><p>That night, Qin Sang left the valley.</p><p>Li Yu Fu, Tan Yi En, and the white cat stood respectfully before Peach Blossom Valley.  Only after Qin Sang’s figure had disappeared for a long time did they stand up straight, their faces filled with reluctance.</p><p>The white cat guarded Peach Blossom Valley.</p><p>Li Yu Fu and Tan Yi En returned to Qingyang Temple to make arrangements.</p><p>Qin Sang traveled alone on this trip; he didn't even bring the little demon, only his Nascent Soul puppet companion.</p><p>Not long after Qin Sang left.</p><p>Ambiguous news spread throughout the cultivation world.</p><p>Some said Qin Sang continued his seclusion in Peach Blossom Valley, preparing to break through to the late Nascent Soul stage, shocking the world; others said Qin Sang had gone on a journey, searching for the Ascension Platform in the Ancient Immortal Battlefield…</p><p>Having once shone brightly in the Three Realms War and breaking through to the mid-Nascent Soul stage at a breathtaking speed, Qin Sang had become a legendary figure in the Northern Star Realm.</p><p>His legends were widely circulated and recounted in various realms.</p><p>In the hearts of these people, Qin Sang's ascension to Grand Cultivator status was a foregone conclusion, only a matter of time.  Some people, having nothing better to do, even gambled on whether Qin Sang could break through to the legendary Transformation Deity stage.</p><p>However, even if that day did come, those who participated in the gambling would have long turned to dust, their bets impossible to collect.</p><p>Other Nascent Soul cultivators feared Qin Sang’s strength.</p><p>Moreover, there was Jing Yu, at the mid-Transformation stage, guarding him.</p><p>Therefore, even though Qin Sang hadn't appeared for a long time, no force dared to challenge Qingyang Temple. Qingyang Temple, dominating the northern shore of the Yun Cang Great Marsh, flourished even more.</p><p>…</p><p>Southern sea area of the Northern Star Realm.</p><p>A gentle sea breeze blew, the water surface calm.</p><p>Qin Sang casually cast an invisibility spell, flying on his sword, without deliberately increasing his speed.</p><p>He flew for a while.</p><p>Without knowing how far he had flown, he clearly felt the wind and waves getting stronger.</p><p>The further he flew, the more violent the wind and waves became.</p><p>‘Rumble…’</p><p>Waves rose to the sky, ceaselessly.</p><p>The wind howled, thunder rumbled.</p><p>Having spent over a hundred years in the Canglang Sea, Qin Sang was all too familiar with this scene. Such strong winds and waves must be influenced by a storm, indicating that he was approaching the storm zone.</p><p>Indeed.</p><p>In less than a stick of incense, the storm zone came into view.</p><p>Qin Sang paused, his gaze shifting as he surveyed the sky-obscuring, iron curtain-like storm zone ahead. As expected, the scene here was exactly the same as the storm zones around the Canglang Sea.</p><p>After entering the storm zone, heading directly south would allow him to pass through and enter the Three Northern Seas.</p><p>But it’s easier said than done.</p><p>The storm zone was fraught with danger, and it wasn't possible to fly through peacefully. A moment’s carelessness, a loss of direction, and one would never be able to escape the storm zone.</p><p>And such a thing was quite possible.</p><p>Qin Sang took out the Moon Gazing Rhinoceros Horn in advance.</p><p>He remembered Yuan Zhu saying that powerful demon cultivators from the Demon Sea had once taken the Moon Gazing Rhinoceros Horn into the storm zone, attempting to find the Canglang Sea and change their perpetually defensive situation.</p><p>Yuan Zhu's cultivation was insufficient, and he didn’t know if the Moon Gazing Rhinoceros Horn’s effect would weaken or become unclear if one ventured too deep into the storm zone. He only reminded Qin Sang to be careful.</p><p>Presumably, the Three Northern Seas wouldn’t be too far from the Northern Star Realm, so the Moon Gazing Rhinoceros Horn shouldn’t become ineffective.</p><p>The storm belt stretched endlessly, with no clearly safe path; entry from any point was the same.  Along the way, unless he was lucky enough to stumble upon an undamaged ancient cultivator's abode, there were no places for him to rest and recover. He had to push through in one go.  Especially in the latter half of the journey, his spiritual energy was heavily depleted; with no way to retreat, he could only press forward, under immense pressure.  These two main reasons are why even Yuan Ying stage cultivators didn't dare to casually cross the storm belt.</p><p>Qin Sang thought of Chen Yan. When she left the Northern Star Realm, her cultivation was only at the early stage of the Nascent Soul realm.  It was likely she either possessed some kind of auxiliary treasure, or knew of a hidden, secret path.  Her master was a powerful cultivator, possibly leaving her something.</p><p>Spiritual energy surged.  The Moon Gazing Rhinoceros Horn emitted a soft glow, its mysterious sensing guiding Qin Sang's direction.  Gripping the horn tightly, Qin Sang chose a random spot and plunged into the storm!</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>Gray whirlwinds assaulted him.  During the Golden Core stage, Qin Sang had ventured deep into the storm belt to evade Old Mou, but now it was even less of a challenge. Qin Sang's figure flickered, dodging effortlessly, shooting forward.</p><p>The storm was boundless. There was no life here, no visible stars or end, an incredibly oppressive environment. A solitary figure, without looking back, bravely pressed onward through the storm.</p><p>...</p><p>Three Northern Seas Regions.  A vast expanse of open ocean.  The sea surface wasn't calm.  However, the sky was cloudless here, unlike what one would expect before a storm.</p><p>'Crack!'</p><p>Suddenly, a thunderclap echoed from afar.  The sound was earth-shattering.  A green light flashed from the north, like a green rainbow, its speed comparable to thunder; it hurtled across the sky, shrinking to a pinpoint of light in an instant.  Following the green light, one red and one black遁光 (escape light) pursued it closely, their auras as powerful as the green light's.</p><p>Terrifying demonic energy!  Pursuing the green light were actually transformation stage Great Demons, and they had all manifested their demonic forms!</p><p>The red escape light's true form was a single-legged divine bird, its head like a fleshy tumor, hideously ugly. Its bloodline was indistinguishable from its appearance; its entire body emanated crimson blood energy, with a nauseating stench.  The single-legged bird's plumage didn't seem originally red, but stained crimson by the blood energy.</p><p>The single-legged bird had a slender body and immense wings, spanning a hundred meters, like a blood cloud, its aura not at all inferior to the light in front of it!  Its triangular demonic eyes revealed bloodlust and excitement, fixed firmly on the direction of the fleeing green light.</p>
