<h1>Chapter 481: Who Gets the Spoils</h1><p>Ji Wu was among the five who hadn't yet emerged!</p><p>The beam of light grew thinner and thinner, about to vanish completely.</p><p>Just then, the beam fluctuated violently, and a blurry figure appeared, squeezing out at the last moment before the mirror disappeared.</p><p>The figure looked disheveled, barely making it out as Sky Peak closed.  They stumbled and fell into the water.</p><p>When the figure surfaced, their face became clear.</p><p>A collective sigh swept through the Righteous Alliance.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression hardened, the ease vanishing from his face. It was Ji Wu!</p><p>He had assumed Ji Wu had perished inside, eliminating a major threat. He hadn't expected him to emerge at the last second.</p><p>Ji Wu's breath was ragged, his robes tattered, his left arm limp. He had exhausted himself escaping and was still gasping for air as he flew towards Elder Jing.</p><p>For a cultivator of his strength, such a sorry state was rare.</p><p>Even more surprising, Ji Wu presented over three hundred Star Stones.</p><p>Aside from Qin Sang, Ji Wu had the most!</p><p>Everyone silently observed Ji Wu. Emerging at the last moment suggested he'd encountered something. His injuries and tattered robes fueled speculation.</p><p>Visibly disappointed at not being first, Ji Wu glanced at Qin Sang and retreated into the crowd.</p><p>The beam of light vanished completely, leaving the water's surface undisturbed, as if Sky Peak had never existed.</p><p>Elder Snake tapped her staff, and the bags of Star Stones arranged themselves in a row before her.  She announced, "The outcome is clear. No need to count, is there?"</p><p>The Golden Armored General snorted, swept up all the Star Stones, turned, and cursed, "Useless bunch!"</p><p>Then, with a stomp, the General transformed into a golden ray of light and departed.</p><p>The members of the Righteous Alliance exchanged glances, their faces downcast, leaving in silence.</p><p>...</p><p>Stargazer Island.</p><p>Elder Snake, in high spirits, beamed at everyone, offered words of encouragement, and gestured for Vice-Island Master Xiao to bring out the rewards.</p><p>Ten treasures shimmered into view.</p><p>This time, everyone knew who the treasures belonged to.</p><p>Those who hadn't qualified could only watch with envy.</p><p>Most of those envious glances were directed at Qin Sang.</p><p>"As agreed, the top ten collectors of Star Stones are entitled to choose a treasure.  Shaohua Mountain's Qin Sang, Demonic Flame Sect's Ji Wu..."</p><p>Senior Brother Rong wasn't among them.</p><p>After naming Qin Sang and the others, Elder Snake continued, "Your contributions were also crucial to our victory against the Righteous Alliance.  Stargazer Island will reward each of you with a top-grade magical artifact. Choose for yourselves."</p><p>With a wave of her hand, Elder Snake sent dozens of beams of light flying, each containing a dazzling array of artifacts.</p><p>The scene reminded Qin Sang of the time in the Kuiyin Sect when Yi Tiannie forced them to become spies. Although decades had passed, the memory remained vivid.</p><p>It was the greatest crisis he had ever faced, and also the greatest turning point on his path of cultivation.</p><p>Fortune and misfortune are intertwined.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't help but feel a surge of emotion.</p><p>The cultivators present weren't overly excited about top-grade artifacts, but they were better than nothing.  It was a pleasant surprise, and smiles spread across their faces as they chose their preferred artifacts.</p><p>"Qin Sang!"</p><p>Once the others had chosen, Elder Snake pointed to Qin Sang.  "You placed first, so you choose first."</p><p>Qin Sang took a deep breath and, amidst a sea of disappointed gazes, declared without hesitation, "I choose the Snow Spirit Lotus and the Iris Flower."</p><p>Unsurprised, Elder Snake gestured, and the two spiritual herbs floated into Qin Sang's hands.</p><p>The Snow Spirit Lotus emanated a gentle coolness, while the Iris Flower exuded warmth.</p><p>Preserved by restrictions, their spiritual essence remained intact.  Holding them, Qin Sang's breath quickened.  He carefully placed them in his storage pouch.</p><p>He could feel hostile gazes upon him, but he wasn't afraid.  No one would dare cause trouble within the True Water Illusion Formation.</p><p>Even after leaving the chaotic waters, he feared no one.</p><p>"Second, Ji Wu!"</p><p>Elder Snake's voice startled Qin Sang. He instinctively looked at Ji Wu, who was looking at the Profound True Pill, second only to the two spiritual herbs in value, with a hesitant expression.</p><p>Ultimately, he made a choice no one expected.</p><p>"I want the Restoration Pill!"</p><p>Ji Wu's words caused an uproar.</p><p>The Restoration Pill was perhaps more valuable than the Profound True Pill, but for Core Formation cultivators, no healing medicine compared to one that aided in Nascent Soul formation.</p><p>The cultivators after Ji Wu, initially surprised, were now overjoyed.</p><p>Elder Snake was also taken aback but asked no questions, handing the Restoration Pill to Ji Wu.</p><p>Qin Sang silently watched Ji Wu put away the pill, a sense of urgency rising within him.  The Restoration Pill was unlike any other healing medicine; it was effective even for Nascent Soul cultivators.</p><p>Such a pill would cause a sensation at auction.</p><p>Daoist Jiupao had been collecting healing medicines for years; his injuries must have partially healed.  If he obtained the Restoration Pill…</p><p>Qin Sang clenched his fists.</p><p>The joy of obtaining the two spiritual herbs diminished.</p><p>Soon, all the treasures were claimed.</p><p>Qin Sang and the others took their leave.  Only the two Island Masters remained in the hall.</p><p>"Senior Redhair made a wager with the Righteous Alliance.  Now that the Foundation Establishment disciples' competition has concluded, we must prepare for the second round.  What are the arrangements? Will the other disciples be dismissed, leaving only a select few?"  Vice-Island Master Xiao inquired.</p><p>Elder Snake shook her head. "The Righteous Alliance won't retreat easily! Besides, the terms of the next competition haven't been decided.  Senior Redhair contacted me earlier.  He considers this a draw, an excellent opportunity for the disciples to gain experience. No need to retreat. We remain here, engaging the Righteous Alliance once every ten days.  We'll withdraw only after the Purple Firmament Palace opens."</p><p>Vice-Island Master Xiao pondered and sighed, "Experience is good, but casualties are inevitable. Even in the relatively safe environment of Sky Peak, four promising disciples perished, one of whom was my nephew…"</p><p>Elder Snake wasn't as sentimental.</p><p>"Fate is fickle.  No one is to blame, Daoist Xiao. You can't protect him forever. How many fellow cultivators, with greater talent than ours, have we known? How many remain? Fellow Cultivator Leng Yuntian's talent was inferior to ours, yet he's now a Nascent Soul Grandmaster, the head of a sect."</p><p>"Him?"</p><p>Disdain flashed in Vice-Island Master Xiao's eyes, but he said no more.</p><p>They discussed further and then departed.</p><p>...</p><p>After leaving Stargazer Island, Qin Sang declined all invitations, exchanged pleasantries with Senior Brother Rong and the others, and amidst congratulations, flew back to his cave dwelling.</p><p>Sealing his cave, Qin Sang sat down, lost in thought.</p><p>(Recently, users from another site have been spamming advertisements in the comment section.</p><p>I don't object to advertising; I even want to advertise elsewhere.
