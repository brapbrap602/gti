<h1>Chapter 1693: Reunion</h1><p>“His Spiritual Flame possesses the might of a Nascent Soul Grandmaster. Aren't you tempted, old monk?” Di Qing Fox Saint King asked rhetorically.</p><p>“Although this poor monk was preoccupied at the time and didn't sense the aura of the Spiritual Flame, judging from their descriptions, it seems to be a Demonic Flame, is it not?”  Wise Light Saint peered through Qing Fox Saint King's thoughts.</p><p>Both the Soul Calming Incense formula and the Southern Bright Departure Fire were things she was determined to obtain.  Qin Sang was simply guilty of possessing treasures that others coveted.</p><p>Qing Fox Saint King fell silent.</p><p>Wise Light Saint didn't press further, instead reminding her, “Unless this flame can be refined by the Saint King, greatly enhancing your cultivation and divine abilities, it's best left alone. If it's merely for another combat technique, this flame's power is too ferocious, and I fear it will be difficult to control.  Using it rashly in the Returning Ruins, causing violent fluctuations, may attract hordes of savage beasts, placing us in even greater danger. This person is already a frightened bird; we cannot use force.  The Saint King had best heed this poor monk's words, and not stubbornly pursue this, creating unnecessary complications.”</p><p>The Returning Ruins of the East Sea were infested with savage beasts.</p><p>Even before the Heavenly Dao's Demonic Sound provoked the savage beasts into a frenzy, the Returning Ruins were an extremely dangerous place. Even Nascent Soul Grandmasters would only venture in after reaching a bottleneck in their cultivation and making thorough preparations. Di</p><p>Now, with the savage beasts driven mad by the Demonic Sound, there was no telling what awaited within their lairs.</p><p>In their eastward journey to ascension, the savage beasts posed one of the greatest threats.</p><p>Especially within the Returning Ruins. While they might be able to handle a single savage beast, if they engaged in open conflict, the resulting disturbance would likely attract even more.</p><p>“If I could subdue the Artifact Spirit and control this treasure, this King wouldn't need to insist on anything else,” Qing Fox Saint King glanced at the Five Elements Crown atop the Demonic Body, her tone finally softening.</p><p>Of course, she also understood that after this failure, capturing that man again would be incredibly difficult.</p><p>Unless she and the old monk personally intervened, anyone else who encountered him would be courting death.</p><p>If there was any hint of trouble, that man would sense it and disappear, perhaps even fleeing Zhongzhou and finding refuge in the Storm Belt. Would they postpone their ascension indefinitely, remaining in Zhongzhou until they unearthed him? Di</p><p>The old monk was a local power; finding that man would require relying on the Buddhist sect's influence.</p><p>The most urgent matter now was finding a way to help the Ancient Devil suppress its madness and regain some semblance of intelligence, so they could interrogate it about the secrets. Incidentally, they could also verify some of their previous theories on the Ancient Devil and investigate the Heavenly Dao's Demonic Sound.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>Several monks rushed towards the shattered mountain.</p><p>The presence of other colored spiritual lights within the five-colored cloud indicated that the Five Elements Divine Prohibition hadn't yet destroyed all the formations on the mountain. They were tasked with salvaging the remaining treasures of the Formless Immortal Sect.</p><p>Other Buddhist experts were also scattered throughout, occupying key locations within the legacy realm and driving away unrelated individuals.</p><p>Unfortunately, they were short-handed, and coupled with the unfolding events, those people had scattered like birds as soon as the Demonic Body showed signs of defeat.  The passages of the legacy realm continued to expand, now encompassing almost half of the Taiyue Mountain Range. The legacy realm was about to re-emerge into the present world. Wise Light Saint's plan to capture everyone was impossible to execute; she could only focus on controlling the legacy realm first. Di</p><p>In the sky.</p><p>Poison King emerged from the grey cocoon, having narrowly escaped death. He surveyed the mountains of the legacy realm, his gaze flickering uncertainly.</p><p>Poison King had already learned from Yue Lingtian about the events that transpired during his confinement, feeling both fortunate and apprehensive.</p><p>Fortunate that he had initially leaned towards a trade and hadn't made a mortal enemy of that man.  Apprehensive that the Gu King had fallen into such a person's hands, how could he retrieve it?</p><p>Mo Xingdao circulated his Qi, observing Qing Fox Saint King and Wise Light Saint, then glancing at the others before discreetly retreating.  Unexpectedly, a voice transmission rang in his ears, freezing him in his tracks.</p><p>…</p><p>“Injured as I am, I cannot rise to greet you. Please forgive my rudeness.” Di</p><p>Within a simple stone dwelling carved into the corner of a desolate mountain, Qin Sang paused his healing and looked towards Liu Li who had entered, a smile appearing on his pale face.</p><p>It was evident that smiling was difficult for him, requiring a deliberate pull of his lips.</p><p>His avatar had delivered Liu Li and then hastily departed.</p><p>Qin Sang explained, “My avatar was disguised as the ancestor of the Xie family of Pushan.  This time, his identity was exposed, provoking the Yao Clan Saint King, and it's likely to bring disaster to the Xie family. I have several friends still in Pushan. Unaware of the changes here, I need to quickly send a message to warn them, so they can prepare.”</p><p>The fastest way, before the rumors spread, was through the Six Provinces Hall, but he wasn't sure if it would be in time.</p><p>Qin Sang could only do his best and leave the rest to fate.</p><p>Presumably, with Ghost Mother overseeing things, suitable arrangements could be made. Di</p><p>Liu Li nodded slightly, recognizing the severity of Qin Sang's true body's injuries.  “What are your plans?”</p><p>“Naturally, to first find a place to heal…”</p><p>Qin Sang twitched his lips, inadvertently aggravating his internal injuries, almost causing him to gasp.</p><p>He forced himself to maintain his smile, gazing at Liu Li. He saw her dressed in a grey robe, and though she wore a monk's hat, he could still see the coiled black hair beneath the brim.</p><p>The lay Buddhist attire not only failed to conceal Liu Li's exquisite beauty but added a touch of elegance and serenity, softening her usual coldness, making her appear less unapproachable.</p><p>Qin Sang felt a strange sense of relief.</p><p>When Liu Li had cut her hair and resolutely left, he had thought he would never see her again. Di</p><p>Looking at the familiar face, he couldn't help but blurt out, “Fortunately, Fairy didn't actually shave her head.”</p><p>Liu Li remained silent, staring at him coldly.</p><p>Qin Sang quickly fell silent, giving a dry laugh.  In his current state, it was best not to be too presumptuous, or Liu Li could kill him with a single slap.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang noticed Liu Li's cultivation was still at Mid-Nascent Soul, but her aura was already on par with his avatar, at the peak of Mid-Nascent Soul.</p><p>“Fairy's cultivation?”</p><p>Recalling that Liu Li could still sense him, indicating that the hidden danger of the demonic cultivation hadn't been resolved, he wondered if she was again facing a bottleneck?</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't help but worry. Di</p><p>Liu Li said calmly, “When the legacy realm appeared, I sensed the opportunity for a breakthrough, and was about to enter seclusion.”</p><p>Guessing what Qin Sang wanted to ask, Liu Li paused, looked at him, and said, "You can shield the brand."</p><p>They had both cultivated the "Mysteries of the Jade Cauldron Scripture," with Qin Sang taking the dominant role.</p><p>Although she diligently suppressed the brand, if Qin Sang willed it, a slight thought would render her efforts futile, revealing the brand's secret.</p><p>Qin Sang seemed completely unaware of this, meaning he had never entertained such thoughts. Even during the confrontation with Yin Changsheng at the Holy Land, when she had willingly opened her mind, Qin Sang had merely borrowed her True Essence to control the Sun God Tree, then immediately severed the connection, without the slightest extraneous thought or action.</p><p>“It’s still best to find a way to remove the brand as soon as possible!”</p><p>Qin Sang sighed. Di</p><p>Judging by Liu Li’s tone, while cultivating Buddhist Dharma had been quite effective, it wasn't enough to completely eliminate the hidden danger.</p><p>Since they were discussing breakthroughs, Qin Sang retrieved a jade sphere from the Myriad Treasures Ring and offered it to Liu Li.</p><p>The jade sphere was the size of a baby's fist, emitting a pure, emerald green light, shimmering like a night pearl.  It contained countless tiny cavities, nested within each other. However, it appeared incomplete in some areas, with an unfinished aspect.</p><p>The jade sphere was the Heavenly Exquisite Spirit Embryo.</p><p>Liu Li didn't accept it, but her gaze was drawn to the Heavenly Exquisite, instinctively sensing its extraordinary nature.</p><p>Qin Sang explained, "This object is called the Heavenly Exquisite.  I obtained it from an opponent. It's a treasure crafted by the Wood Phase lineage, and can aid in breaking through to Nascent Soul.  Ascending to Nascent Soul, the step of sensing the heavens and earth is crucial, and closely tied to one’s spiritual roots... As you know, I have five spiritual roots, so this is useless to me.  I also don’t lack treasures to aid in breakthroughs. I plan to trade the Five Elements Pill with Mo Xingdao for the Spiritual Rhinoceros Immortal Fruit, though I don't know if he'll escape."</p><p>Saying this, Qin Sang retrieved a wooden box, revealing the cyan light sphere containing the Heavenly Exquisite’s secret technique. Di</p><p>Liu Li extended her divine sense into the light sphere. After reading its contents, a strange expression crossed her face.</p><p>After a moment of silence, Liu Li shook her head.  “It was but a small effort on my part.”</p><p>Her temperament hadn’t changed at all!</p><p>He had said so much, yet still couldn’t persuade Liu Li to accept.</p><p>Qin Sang sighed inwardly, "To you, it might be a small effort, but to me, it was a life-saving grace. Moreover, Fairy took a great risk in helping me. You cultivate Buddhist Dharma, so shouldn’t you know that guarding against me so vigilantly is in itself an attachment?  Going with the flow is the true path."</p><p>Liu Li remained firm, only making a copy of the light sphere’s contents. "I haven't yet reached Late-Nascent Soul. I have plenty of time to gather resources and refine the Heavenly Exquisite. Since the Laurel Immortal Dew has appeared in Zhongzhou before, it’s not extinct.  I may yet find it."</p><p>Qin Sang opened his mouth, but in the end, he could only retract the Heavenly Exquisite Spirit Embryo. Di</p><p>“In that case, I'll hold onto this for Fairy for now. Also, I still have a stick of Soul Calming Incense. If Fairy needs it, don't hesitate to ask.”</p><p>Liu Li gave a noncommittal response.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't press the matter further, instead changing the subject. "Which sect did Fairy join? Will today’s events have any adverse consequences?"</p><p>With the teleportation passage exposed, the relationship between that sect and the Formless Immortal Sect would also be revealed.</p><p>If there were any repercussions, the sect might take it out on Liu Li.</p><p>"Veiled Moon Convent.  Our founding ancestor was once the Dao Companion of an elder from the Formless Immortal Sect. After the Formless Immortal Sect's destruction, its members sought refuge in seclusion, using other identities when venturing out…"</p><p>Liu Li briefly explained the origins of the Veiled Moon Convent. Di</p><p>Learning that the Veiled Moon Convent's ancestor originated from the Water Phase lineage and had strong ties to the Metal Phase lineage, Qin Sang's expression shifted slightly, and he hurriedly took out a few more items.</p><p>There were jade slips obtained from the Ice Instrument Palace, containing the inheritances of the Water Phase Hall:  "Grand Unity Water Storage," "Lightless Shield," "Primordial Silence Divine Wheel," and "Misty Ripple Shadow Clone."</p><p>There was also the golden sword obtained from Emperor Bestowal Mountain, containing the sword array inheritance of the Metal Phase Hall.</p><p>Qin Sang handed everything to Liu Li, leaving the arrangements to her.</p><p>Scanning the contents of the jade slips and the golden sword, Liu Li couldn't help but glance at Qin Sang again, surprised by the abundance of his gains from the Formless Immortal Sect.</p><p>This time, Liu Li didn't refuse.</p><p>She had lied about returning to the Secret Hall for treasures, when in reality, she had gone to rescue Qin Sang. The old nun had seen through her deception, but hadn't been angered, even lending a hand. In the end, they hadn't been able to retrieve the treasures within the Secret Hall. Di</p><p>This debt needed to be repaid.</p><p>Returning the inheritances of the two lineages would be a way to fulfill her obligation.</p><p>Perhaps because they had been apart for so long, a sense of awkwardness lingered. After finishing discussing these important matters, Qin Sang found himself at a loss for words.  Liu Li, with her naturally cold and aloof demeanor, was even less likely to initiate conversation.</p><p>For a time, silence filled the dwelling, as they gazed at each other without speaking.</p><p>After a while, Qin Sang glanced outside. "My avatar should be nearing the nearby Six Provinces Hall.  Does Fairy know who is currently at the Xie family?"</p><p>Not expecting Liu Li to offer him a way out of the awkward silence, Qin Sang continued on his own, "I was originally heading north to Jin Yu Zhou for the Ullambana Assembly, but unexpectedly encountered Senior Ghost Mother there.  Being able to arrive before the legacy realm appeared was also thanks to her guidance.  I initially came for the Zhongzhou Immortal Palace, but unexpectedly, the path to the Immortal Palace was broken. Judging by True Person Eight Sceneries Purple Thunder’s actions, he must have also ascended to the upper realm."</p><p>Hearing "Ghost Mother," Liu Li's eyes flickered slightly. “Ya Gu?” Di</p><p>Finally, a response!</p><p>It was good that she still remembered Ya Gu.</p><p>Qin Sang's spirits lifted. He smiled and said, "My previous efforts weren't in vain.  After Senior Ghost Mother examined her, Ya Gu's condition is stable. Senior Ghost Mother is helping her, and will certainly be able to undo the Heavenly Corpse Talisman and awaken her."</p><p>As if infected by Qin Sang's smile, Liu Li's expression softened slightly. She said softly, "Congratulations."</p><p>Qin Sang knew she must have thought of her master.</p><p>In a way, they were both bound by their attachments.  His attachment was about to be resolved, while Liu Li and her master were separated by realms, their reunion a distant hope.</p><p>"Rest assured, Fairy, your master is blessed and will certainly overcome this danger. I learned many secrets from Senior Ghost Mother this time…" Di</p><p>Qin Sang quickly relayed everything he learned from Ghost Mother to Liu Li.</p><p>"The Ascension Platform has flown to the Demon Realm, but the Immortal Palace and the Ascension Platform shouldn't be connected...  The ascension from the Immortal Palace would have created a huge commotion. Unless someone in the upper realm had made arrangements to conceal it, there would definitely be news circulating. Senior Ghost Mother is preparing for ascension. I'll ask her to investigate this matter after she reaches the upper realm. Perhaps she can find news of your master, and even better, offer assistance. After we ascend, we'll visit Senior Ghost Mother in the Wu Clan."</p><p>"Ascension..."</p><p>Liu Li seemed lost in thought, a hint of anticipation in her eyes.</p><p>This anticipation was the driving force behind her relentless efforts.</p><p>Seeing no sign of his avatar's return, Qin Sang decided not to wait any longer. He suggested they leave and shamelessly requested her protection. "May I trouble Fairy to escort me once more?"</p><p>Learning that Cave Master Weeping Spirit had also died at Qin Sang's hand, Liu Li was speechless. Di</p><p>How long had they been in Zhongzhou? How did this person have enemies everywhere?</p><p>Cave Master Weeping Spirit had a notorious reputation in the Southern Barbarian Two Provinces.  Known for his mastery of ghost dao and unpredictable mystical abilities, once he set his sights on someone, they wouldn’t even know how they died. More often than not, even death was a luxury.</p><p>Sects including the Myriad Poison Mountain and Taiyue Sect were reluctant to provoke such a vicious individual.</p><p>After achieving a certain level of cultivation, he had rarely appeared, but his sinister reputation remained undiminished.</p><p>Unexpectedly, he had died here without a sound.</p><p>Qin Sang planned to visit Cave Master Weeping Spirit's cave dwelling first, not the one known to the public, of course.</p><p>This cunning individual had multiple hideouts. His medicinal garden was located in the most secluded cave, its location unknown even to his disciples. Perhaps he could find spiritual herbs there that would aid his recovery and hasten his healing. Di</p><p>He could recuperate in Cave Master Weeping Spirit's cave, but staying too close to Poison King wasn't a long-term solution.</p><p>After consuming some medicinal pills, Qin Sang was barely able to move.</p><p>Cave Master Weeping Spirit's cave was situated in an uninhabited region of Man Zhou. The two traveled southwest. The Southern Barbarian Two Provinces were vast and sparsely populated, riddled with poisonous miasma, so there was no need to worry about being discovered.</p><p>Along the way, Qin Sang recounted his experiences over the years, also learning that Liu Li had originally intended to find a Buddhist temple in the Western Desert for quiet cultivation, but had unexpectedly encountered the Convent Master during her travels.</p><p>They journeyed together through the Western Desert and formed a bond.  Liu Li accepted the Convent Master's invitation to join the Veiled Moon Convent, and at her urging, chose to cultivate while retaining her hair.  She had remained within the convent ever since.</p>
