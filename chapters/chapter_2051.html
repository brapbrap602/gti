<h1>Chapter 2042: Xu Wei</h1><p>Jian Nu said, "I relayed the message to my master and returned to await you, but I did not see him again."</p><p>They knew the danger facing Tian Yue, but they could do nothing.</p><p>Qin Sang sighed, "Friend Daoist, do you still plan to return to Baiyu City? Did your master leave any instructions?"</p><p>Jian Nu replied somewhat dazedly, "My cultivation is too low to assist my master. He said he wouldn't be settling down anytime soon and told me to decide where to go, that I didn't need to remain confined to Baiyu City. But I have no relatives in the Great Thousand World, and all my former associates disappeared along with the Dao Court.  Besides Baiyu City, I don't know where else to go."</p><p>Since following Tian Yue, he had considered himself a servant, loyal and diligently fulfilling every command.  Suddenly granted freedom, he was at a loss.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered, "I am going to Kan Prefecture, establishing a Daoist field overseas. You could come with me. If you wish to travel the Great Thousand World, the East Sea is vast, and you can explore freely while we watch each other's backs. If you prefer seclusion to cultivate, I will prepare a cave abode for you in my Daoist field."</p><p>He smiled, "The location I've chosen is within the territory of a foreign race, surrounded by enemies on all sides.  It's unlikely to be peaceful, but you won't lack opportunities to hone your swordsmanship."</p><p>If Qin Sang were forced to flee, Jian Nu staying in Da Zhou could serve as support.  Since they escaped safely, it was better to keep Jian Nu close.</p><p>Jian Nu is a pure sword cultivator, a direct disciple of Tian Yue, with exceptional swordsmanship; below the Refinement Void stage, he should be nearly invincible, a powerful asset.</p><p>Lately, Qin Sang has been considering how to resolve the crisis and survive in the foreign race territory after finding the Storm World.</p><p>Relocating the entire world is the worst option.</p><p>The Storm World's countless inhabitants—even if Qin Sang's small Heaven was intact—would require countless trips, not to mention the unstable space, where living beings wouldn't survive for long.</p><p>Using other artifacts for relocation would inevitably cause a huge commotion.  Would the surrounding foreign races stand idly by? If our path is blocked and we are pursued from behind, how many would survive?</p><p>Qin Sang believed that as long as the Storm World hadn't been destroyed, the situation wasn't critical. Perhaps the Chang You Clan tried to swallow the world alone, suppressing news and preventing other foreign races from intervening; or perhaps the powerful figures among the foreign races, arrogant in their status, considered the Storm World no threat and ignored it, leaving the matter to be resolved below.</p><p>However, once he appeared in the Storm World, the situation would change.</p><p>The Storm World, having suddenly become a Refinement Void-level power, would surely draw the attention of the foreign race's powerful figures.  Therefore, even if he and Su Nu found the Storm World, they couldn't act rashly, directly attacking the Chang You Clan.  They must consider the geographical environment and employ strategy.</p><p>The internal situation of the Storm World is also intricate.  The various regions were originally separated by storms, with diverse customs and countless sects, and the three races—humans, witches, and demons—live together, entangled in grievances.</p><p>Both internally and externally, they must carefully unravel the situation and handle it patiently.</p><p>Thus, the Storm World's Nascent Soul-level powerhouses are vital, a crucial pillar of strength; they might need to ask Jian Nu to lead the Storm World cultivators in battle.</p><p>Upon Qin Sang's invitation, Jian Nu didn't hesitate, readily agreeing, "I will follow your commands, Daoist Master!"</p><p>With another powerful ally, Qin Sang felt elated and took Jian Nu to meet Su Nu and Gu Ya.</p><p>After introductions, Qin Sang only said Jian Nu was an old acquaintance, without revealing his background, and the two women didn't ask further.</p><p>Upon learning of Jian Nu's cultivation, Gu Ya rejoiced.  Bringing back so many experts this time—hopefully the Storm World can hold out until they arrive!</p><p>…</p><p>"This is Xu Wei City."</p><p>Qin Sang smelled the slightly salty sea breeze and tested the stone pavement underfoot—the ground was solid.</p><p>Looking around, the sky was clear.</p><p>Under the blue sky, rooftops stretched as far as the eye could see.  The pavilions and buildings here had a unique charm, decorated with various sea creatures, their shapes peculiar and colors vibrant.  The roof tiles, crafted from special spirit shells, were like glazed glass, glittering under the sun like waves washing over a fairy city.</p><p>The land was almost completely flat, without even a single high mountain, like a giant pancake extending endlessly in all directions.  The sea was invisible; if not for the sea breeze, one would think they were still on land.</p><p>Qin Sang recalled the legend of the giant turtle. This fairy city seemed to lie on a turtle shell.  Xu and Wei are two of the seven mansions of the Northern Black Tortoise constellation. The city's name must have a meaning connected to this.</p><p>Xu Wei City is the capital of Kan Prefecture, one of the eight major prefectures, located in the East Sea.  It is said that Kan Prefecture's territory is almost entirely at sea, composed of numerous islands.</p><p>“Has Brother Qin sensed the giant turtle’s will?”</p><p>Su Nu emerged from behind Qin Sang. She was fascinated by the legends of the giant turtle and had just tried to probe its depths with her spiritual sense, only to find it as unyielding as stone, no different from any other place.</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head.  “A turtle that supports a celestial city… its cultivation is unimaginable, far beyond our reach. Even if it’s still alive, Xu Wei City wouldn't allow anyone to disturb its slumber;  powerful formations must be in place.”</p><p>Jian Nu and Gu Ya followed behind them.</p><p>Gu Ya felt closer to leaving her sect, her excitement barely concealed.</p><p>Jian Nu remained unmoved by external matters, glancing briefly before returning her gaze to her spiritual sword, her mind never straying.</p><p>After a brief reconnaissance to understand Xu Wei City's layout, Qin Sang's first stop was naturally the Five Elements Alliance.</p><p>Xu Wei City was oval-shaped, its interior resembling the pattern of a turtle shell, divided into distinct sections. Like other large celestial cities,  small teleportation arrays facilitated travel within Xu Wei City.</p><p>Reaching the Five Elements Alliance's area, Qin Sang rented a courtyard to settle everyone before heading to the Alliance alone.</p><p>With Qin Sang gone, and nothing pressing, Su Nu planned to take the others for a stroll.</p><p>Each of the Eight Great Heavenly States had unique products.  Most of the other states bordered the sea, but Kan State was the only sea-based state, giving it unparalleled advantages.</p><p>However, Jian Nu had already entered meditative seclusion in her room.</p><p>“I wonder where Brother Qin found this eccentric!”</p><p>Su Nu sighed, but didn't press the matter.</p><p>…</p><p>“The Five Elements Alliance.”</p><p>Qin Sang gazed at a secluded courtyard ahead, surprised by the Five Elements Alliance's style in Xu Wei City.</p><p>Regardless of location within the Eight Great Heavenly States, the Five Elements Alliance's signboard style and font were always the same, only the color varied to indicate rank.</p><p>Entering the courtyard, Qin Sang felt he’d passed through a formation barrier;  the interior held a different world altogether.</p><p>The courtyard was deep and expansive, each building protected by its own independent barrier.  From the outside, Xu Wei City appeared sparse, lacking greenery, but the courtyard was filled with the sound of clear springs, a tranquil scene.</p><p>A maid immediately approached. Qin Sang presented his token, and the maid, showing deference, led him through a side corridor, eventually arriving at a small courtyard with an octagonal stone pavilion.</p><p>“Elder Qin, please wait in the pavilion. I will go fetch Elder You.”</p><p>The maid bowed and left.</p><p>Inside, Qin Sang sensed the pure essence of earth fire, realizing that a superior fire chamber must be present.</p><p>“If Xu Wei City is built on the turtle’s back, why are there subterranean fire veins?  The city’s abundant spiritual energy… where does the spiritual vein originate? Could it be plundering life force from the giant turtle?”</p><p>This thought suddenly struck Qin Sang.</p><p>Moments later, sensing an approaching presence, Qin Sang looked towards the pavilion entrance. A man in black robes slowly approached, his expression cold, his physique strong, his hair dark, his age unreadable – presumably Elder You.</p><p>This person's cultivation was similar to his own. The leader of the Kan State Five Elements Alliance must be someone else entirely. However, he wasn't yet worthy of being a guest of honor for such a figure, so Elder You's reception was appropriate.</p><p>The Five Elements Alliance’s elders held different ranks. Qin Sang, merely a guest elder, had no authority to interfere in the Alliance's affairs.</p><p>Elder You held significant power within the Alliance.  Sent to other celestial cities, he would be a regional ruler, a figure no force dared to underestimate.</p><p>Qin Sang rose and bowed. “Greetings, Elder You.”</p><p>“Elder Qin, your courtesy is appreciated.”</p><p>Elder You returned the bow, his stern expression softening slightly.  After the formalities, he went straight to the point. “Elder Qin, you’ve come from another Heavenly State? What brings you here?  Does the Alliance require assistance?”</p><p>For every guest elder, the Five Elements Alliance would try to fulfill their requests, as long as they weren’t excessive.</p><p>Seeing Elder You’s directness, Qin Sang stated his purpose. “Qin has been a wanderer, unsettled, a life unsustainable in the long term.  Coming to Kan State, I wish to find a suitable place to cultivate. Does the Alliance have detailed sea charts I could examine?”</p><p>Elder You’s demeanor brightened. “Elder Qin intends to stay in Kan State for an extended period?”</p><p>A passing guest elder wouldn't benefit their branch much; a polite response would suffice. But if the other party intended to settle in Kan State, it was a different matter entirely, someone worth cultivating a relationship with.</p><p>“What are your plans, Elder Qin?  Seek patronage, or establish your own dojo?  If the former, the Alliance has several unoccupied caves you can choose from. Also, I’ve cultivated in Kan State since childhood. Through the Alliance, I have connections with many prominent sects and can introduce you. With Elder Qin’s abilities, news of your arrival will attract invitations from these sects. Rest assured, the Alliance has few restrictions; these options are not mutually exclusive.”</p><p>Elder You was genuinely considering Qin Sang’s needs.</p><p>Qin Sang remained noncommittal. “My knowledge of Kan State is limited. I wish to understand the area better before making a decision.”</p><p>"That's only natural. I was hasty," Elder You nodded, immediately ordering someone to fetch a nautical chart.</p><p>The chart was etched onto a jade slip. Qin Sang's spiritual sense swept over it, instantly grasping its entirety.</p><p>It seemed Elder You wasn't trying to make things difficult; he'd presented the entire map of Kan Prefecture.</p><p>The chart was dotted with glowing points, like stars, highlighting major immortal cities and prominent sects of Kan Prefecture.</p><p>Elder You explained that the blank areas weren't unclaimed, but rather unstable, changing hands frequently.  Since these weren't major powers, their influence was negligible, so he hadn't bothered to detail them.</p><p>Even in the Eight Great Heavenly Prefectures, stability was relative.</p><p>The chart didn't reveal much. If Qin Sang truly intended to establish a dao field here, he'd have to explore personally. He didn't have that kind of time, so after a cursory glance, he looked towards Kan Prefecture's eastern border, only to find limited information there.</p><p>He hadn't found the location of the Mist Sea, his primary concern.</p><p>Qin Sang flicked a finger, his true essence manifesting a replica of the chart, pointing to an immortal city on the eastern border.  He asked curiously, "Is this the furthest branch of our Alliance?"</p><p>This city, built on Sleepless Island, was called Sleepless City.</p><p>Sleepless City possessed a teleportation array connecting it to other immortal cities, almost bordering Kan Prefecture's boundary.  The other cities were similar, acting as gateways guarding Kan Prefecture.</p><p>From Elder You's tone, Kan Prefecture hadn't expanded its territory in a long time.</p><p>"The situation at sea doesn't seem optimistic…"</p><p>Qin Sang mused inwardly.</p><p>The Five Elements Alliance had a branch in Wuyu Mountain in the Darklands beyond Dui Prefecture, but not a single one beyond Kan Prefecture.</p><p>Elder You looked at the spot Qin Sang indicated, nodding in agreement. He subtly guessed Qin Sang's intention, surmising the man likely disliked constraints and wanted to establish a dao field in the deep sea.</p><p>"Elder Qin has just arrived in Kan Prefecture and may not know this. In other Heavenly Prefectures, the nearby areas are mostly controlled by humans, influenced by the Great Zhou Dynasty, allowing for communication. Kan Prefecture is different.  Sea monsters run rampant in the vast ocean, countless tribes and countless Eastern Sea aquatic races…"</p><p>Elder You seemed to recall something, adding with a sigh, "Since childhood, I've heard a saying: it's rumored that the original sea territory wasn't ours.  Only through constant reinforcements via teleportation arrays did we gain a foothold and gradually develop into a Heavenly Prefecture. The East Sea has a Dragon Palace, ruling all monsters, the king of the Eastern Sea aquatic races. However, in my thousands of years of cultivation, I can't recall how many monster uprisings I've witnessed, yet I've never seen a true dragon emerge from the Dragon Palace."</p><p>"A true dragon?"</p><p>Qin Sang's expression turned serious.</p><p>Many legends spoke of true dragons, invariably celestial beasts blessed by heaven's fortune and auspicious omens. If true dragons existed, they would undoubtedly be peak-level powerhouses.</p><p>The East Sea situation was incredibly complex.</p><p>There were the eight human Heavenly Prefectures, the Mist Sea's unusual people, the mysterious Dragon Palace, and countless other races and forces.</p><p>Elder You also separated a strand of true essence, attaching it to the edge of the chart.  A mist rose, transforming into another map.</p><p>However, this chart's contents were far more simplified and vague than that of Kan Prefecture.</p><p>Qin Sang noticed several human sects within, and quite a few at that.</p><p>"This is a chart drawn ten years ago. The deep sea situation is even more volatile than Kan Prefecture's; it needs re-exploration.</p><p>"Elder Qin, please observe. These sects are all founded by humans, each possessing strong power and long histories. Legend says that unknown peerless experts are cultivating in seclusion in the deep sea.</p><p>"But don't think that because there's no Great Zhou Celestial Law, you'll be completely unrestrained. Our cultivation levels don't allow for such recklessness.</p><p>"To gain a foothold there, race isn't the priority; you need sufficient strength to deter enemies, requiring alliances with other forces.  Even within the alliances, there are rules, perhaps stricter than the Great Zhou Celestial Law.</p><p>"As I said earlier, the East Sea has no tranquil land!"</p><p>Qin Sang followed Elder You's guidance, observing one by one, noticing that human influence weakened the further into the deep sea he looked.</p><p>There were also monster tribes, resulting in a mixed human and non-human settlement.  It was unclear if they coexisted peacefully.</p><p>Suddenly, Qin Sang's heart stirred. He saw a marking on the far ocean made by Elder You, with the words 'Mist Sea'.</p>
