<h1>Chapter 1131: Ancient Treasure</h1><p>Since obtaining the Star Platform, Qin Sang had cultivated both the *Thunder Control Art* and the *Heavenly Demon Body Refinement Technique* with its assistance. Despite spending countless days and nights with the Star Platform, Qin Sang had made no progress in uncovering its secrets. It seemed that the Star Platform was merely a tool to connect with the stars and aid in the cultivation of the *Thunder Control Art*. However, Qin Sang felt that there had to be more to it.</p><p>The Black Snake Mountain's Ancestor had coveted the Star Platform, going so far as to send disciples to steal it from the Luan Dou Sect. This suggested that the Star Platform was likely tied to some profound secret of the Witch Clan. During his time in the Canglang Sea, Qin Sang had secretly investigated the Star Platform multiple times but found no relevant information. With most of his energy focused on cultivation and the Seven Slaughter Palace, he had not delved deeper into the matter.</p><p>Now, at the Finger Heaven Peak, the Star Platform had undergone an unprecedented transformation.</p><p>"Could it be because there wasn’t enough concentrated stellar energy before?" Qin Sang pondered, staring at the Star Platform.</p><p>This was the first time he had brought the Star Platform to a place like the Finger Heaven Peak. During his focused breakthrough, the Star Platform had absorbed an unknown amount of stellar energy. What was once an ordinary stone had now become somewhat translucent. Starlight passed through it, and its material seemed to be transforming into jade.</p><p>Previously, the Star Platform had been pitted and scarred. Now, those scars appeared to have turned into mysterious runes, imbuing the platform with an extraordinary aura.</p><p>After Qin Sang dispersed his cultivation, the Star Platform became the core. Stellar energy continued to be drawn into it, as if it were a bottomless pit. Not only did the absorption not slow down, but it also accelerated. Gradually, the commotion it caused surpassed even Qin Sang's cultivation efforts.</p><p>The stellar energy on the Finger Heaven Peak was extremely dense. The open area Qin Sang had chosen was quite large, yet the stellar energy within it was nearly depleted by the Star Platform.</p><p>"If this continues, will it affect the stability of the ancient restrictions and the space?" Qin Sang retreated to the side, somewhat worried.</p><p>If the Finger Heaven Peak were destroyed by the Star Platform, he wouldn’t just offend one or two people—he would incur the wrath of all the cultivators from the Little Cold Domain and the Tianxing Alliance.</p><p>*Whoosh...*</p><p>A vortex of stellar energy formed, its scale astonishing. The Star Platform was at its center. Qin Sang had no choice but to retreat further. He kept a close eye on the immortal restrictions surrounding the open area, noticing that the light clusters intertwined with the restrictions, nearly condensing into stellar stones, remained stable and unaffected by the anomaly.</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang's expression eased slightly. His gaze returned to the Star Platform.</p><p>He was shocked. The amount of stellar energy the Star Platform had absorbed was immense. The stellar energy accumulated over countless years on this hillside had been nearly drained. It was hard to imagine what level of ancient treasure this was.</p><p>Finally, a resonant hum emanated from within the stellar vortex. In an instant, the stellar energy dispersed, revealing the glowing Star Platform. Unexpectedly, the next moment, the Star Platform's light dimmed, returning to its former simple and unremarkable appearance.</p><p>Once the commotion caused by the Star Platform subsided, Qin Sang cautiously approached. Despite absorbing so much stellar energy, the platform showed no obvious changes. He lifted his hand, drawing the Star Platform into his palm, and channeled his true essence into it.</p><p>It was exactly the same as before.</p><p>One thing was certain: the Star Platform had undergone some unknown transformation.</p><p>"Is it because my cultivation is too low to control the Star Platform? Or is it because it’s a treasure of the Witch Clan, requiring Witch Clan bloodline? With Ya Gu still unconscious and no descendants of the Witch Clan in the Little Cold Domain, I might have to return to the Canglang Sea to find out..."</p><p>Qin Sang pondered, deciding to store the Star Platform for now. Roughly calculating, he had been inside for quite some time. The Nascent Soul cultivators outside were likely growing impatient.</p><p>He calmed his breath, erased his traces, and continued collecting enough stellar stones. Returning to the teleportation array, he sent all the treasures back to the immortal mansion on the other side.</p><p>*Splash...*</p><p>A figure broke through the water.</p><p>Qin Sang flew out of the Finger Heaven Peak and saw the three Nascent Soul ancestors waiting for him.</p><p>"Reporting to the three seniors, this junior has completed the cultivation of the secret technique," Qin Sang said, bowing.</p><p>Jiu Gu and the demonic path Nascent Soul scrutinized Qin Sang, confirming that the seals they had left were untouched. Their expressions softened slightly as they removed the seals. Then, the three of them used talismans to reseal the Finger Heaven Peak.</p><p>"Cold Sect Master, your request has been fulfilled. I shall take my leave! The signs of unrest in the Sin Abyss are becoming more apparent. The key fortresses must not be neglected. I hope the two of you will not delay too long," Jiu Gu said, heading south to return to the Cangheng Island. The demonic path Nascent Soul flew northeast toward the Sky Severing Mountain, the stronghold of the demonic path.</p><p>Qing Jun then took Qin Sang back to the Yuan Shen Sect.</p><p>After distancing themselves from the other two, they changed direction and flew for a while, arriving at a cluster of reefs. Qing Jun took out a treasure seal, infused it with true essence, and shot a sword-like green light into the sky.</p><p>Immediately, the void rippled, and the gate to the immortal mansion appeared out of thin air, accompanied by various phenomena.</p><p>The immortal mansion opened with a resounding boom.</p><p>Suppressing their cultivation, the two of them entered the mansion. Inside, it resembled a true residence, like a garden, though the damage was even worse than that of the Finger Heaven Peak. They had to suppress their cultivation to the Qi Refining stage.</p><p>Upon reaching the interior of the mansion, the teleportation array was surrounded by ancient restrictions and radiant light, identical to those at the Finger Heaven Peak.</p><p>Qin Sang had heard from Senior Sister Qing Jun that this immortal mansion was the source of Senior Qing Zhu's tragedy. Qing Jun's aunt, who was Qing Zhu's senior sister, had obtained the treasure seal when the mansion first appeared. Leng Yuntian discovered the teleportation array and, in his attempt to seize the mansion, murdered Qing Zhu's senior sister, creating a deep-seated enmity.</p><p>Ironically, the Yuan Shen Sect gained little from this and ultimately perished because of the mansion, with the entire sect falling into Qing Jun's hands.</p><p>Qin Sang retrieved the Star Platform and other treasures.</p><p>Qing Jun counted the stellar stones and nodded in satisfaction, "Good, this is enough! How is your body refinement technique progressing? I don’t see much change in you. Did the breakthrough fail?"</p><p>"Senior Sister, your insight is as sharp as ever," Qin Sang said gloomily. "I had a premonition that the true intent of the Azure Phoenix puppet wouldn’t be enough for me to comprehend the Heavenly Demon Form. However, my physical body has indeed improved by one level. I hope it will aid in forming my Nascent Soul."</p><p>"Visualizing a Heavenly Demon for body refinement... What a strange technique," Qing Jun shook her head repeatedly, having never heard of such a thing.</p><p>Qin Sang didn’t tell her that he was cultivating a demonic technique.</p><p>As they spoke, the two left the immortal mansion and flew toward the Yuan Shen Sect.</p><p>"Senior Sister, think carefully. How much do you remember about the mysterious stone slab and the Qiji Demon King? It seems now that the only way to observe a true Heavenly Demon in the cultivation world is through that stone slab," Qin Sang pressed, unwilling to give up.</p><p>The *Heavenly Demon Body Refinement Technique* was of extraordinary origin, and even more precious was the fact that the Jade Buddha blocked the stellar miasma, allowing him to cultivate this technique at an incredible speed. His current talent could support the simultaneous cultivation of both techniques, refining both his body and spirit.</p><p>Bai speculated that the Southern Brightness Fire might contain a feather of the Vermilion Bird, but the Purple Palace's opening was uncertain, and obtaining the Southern Brightness Fire was even more so. Even if there were a Vermilion Bird feather, who knew if it was just a remnant and whether it still retained the Vermilion Bird's aura?</p><p>If there was a chance to approach the mysterious stone slab, Qin Sang would definitely strive for it.</p>
