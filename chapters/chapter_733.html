<h1>Chapter 725: Unexpected News</h1><p>“I am well aware of the nature of the Seven Killing Hall, yet I have no choice but to go…”</p><p>Qin Sang sighed.</p><p>Ran Luo, seeing this, ceased her persuasion, but then informed Qin Sang of surprising news.</p><p>“Rumors about the Seven Killing Hall have indeed circulated in the Inner Sea for a year or two, but only a limited number of people know about it.  I only heard about it in passing during a conversation between Elder Zou and a friend.  It is said that this time is different; the next opening of the Seven Killing Hall might be in more than twenty years.”</p><p>Qin Sang was incredibly surprised.  “More than twenty years? How can it be so soon? Wouldn’t that be only fifty years since the last time, twenty years less than before! To forcibly break the immortal array before it reaches its low tide period, the price paid would be far more than double! No power could withstand that! Did Elder Zou say anything about the reason?”</p><p>Qin Sang was anxious. He originally had ample time to break through to the mid-stage of the Core Formation realm. He also had enough time to cultivate both his spirit insects to their third transformation, maximizing their effectiveness.</p><p>The sudden twenty-year shortening made his own cultivation urgent, and it was likely he couldn’t complete the third transformation of his two spirit insects before the Seven Killing Hall opened.</p><p>“No, Elder Zou doesn’t know either.”</p><p>Ran Luo shook her head.  “Perhaps the immortal array of the Seven Killing Hall has undergone changes, but I suspect it’s not that simple, because there's another variable. Elder Zou mentioned that it seems much harder to obtain entry permits to the Seven Killing Hall this time than before; only established powers stand a chance. Before, cultivators could obtain permits through other channels, such as auctions. If you tried hard enough, it wasn't too difficult, but it will be extremely hard now.”</p><p>Time was shortened, and places were limited.</p><p>The sudden change caught Qin Sang off guard.</p><p>He had been reluctant to become too involved with the forces of the Canglang Sea, even keeping a certain distance from the Qiongyu Trading Company, but it turned out to be a wrong choice.</p><p>After a moment of thought, Qin Sang said gravely, “Daoist Ran, does our Trading Company have any chance of securing a permit?”</p><p>“I don’t know. I never thought of going to such a dangerous place before, I only took it as a curious story.”</p><p>Ran Luo shook her head.  Seeing Qin Sang fall silent, she thought for a moment and said, “Even if our Trading Company can’t, the Dongji Alliance certainly can.  Our Trading Alliance’s strength surpasses even the top sects of both righteous and demonic paths. Daoist Qin is considered a member of our Trading Company; through the Dongji Alliance, we might be able to secure a permit. If you are interested, I can ask Elder Zou on your behalf. Elder Zou has countless connections and is sure to have a way.”</p><p>“Then I would be grateful for your help, Daoist Ran.”</p><p>Qin Sang said gratefully.</p><p>With only over twenty years left, he had to cultivate with all his might to ensure that he broke through to the mid-stage Core Formation realm before the Seven Killing Hall opened.</p><p>If he returned to the Inner Sea to search aimlessly, not only was there no guarantee of obtaining a permit, but he would also waste a lot of time.</p><p>Relying on the Qiongyu Trading Company and the Dongji Alliance was indeed the best option.  Securing a permit would likely be difficult, and the Alliance and Company might use this opportunity to make demands; as long as they weren't too excessive, Qin Sang decided to accept them.</p><p>“Daoist Qin, there's no need to be so polite, I need your help as well. Our newly hired refiner simply can't compare to you,” Ran Luo giggled, covering her mouth.</p><p>“I consider it my duty.”</p><p>Qin Sang bowed.</p><p>After a few more polite exchanges, Qin Sang urged Ran Luo to send the materials to the refining room to begin refining. Ran Luo reciprocated by sending someone to contact Elder Zou, who was on another island.</p><p>After refining the Hun Yuan Tong Xin Huan (literally: Primordial Unity Heart Ring, possibly referring to a magic item), Qin Sang made significant progress in the art of refining. He felt that his success rate in refining magical items would not be lower than other refiners.</p><p>The premise was the use of the Nine Nether Demon Fire.</p><p>Besides the immense consumption and lengthy time, the residual demonic energy of the Nine Nether Demon Fire was the reason Qin Sang hadn't mentioned it to Ran Luo.</p><p>When refining magical weapons, the residual demonic energy of the Nine Nether Demon Fire was minimal and could be concealed using special refining techniques.</p><p>However, if it was magic treasures like the Hun Yuan Tong Xin Huan, it would be hard to explain. Experienced refining masters would immediately see that the refiner must possess a unique spiritual fire.</p><p>This would bring unnecessary trouble.</p><p>Until he could resolve this issue, Qin Sang thought it best to keep a low profile.</p><p>Batch after batch of materials were sent, and Qin Sang stayed in the refining room for over a month without leaving.</p><p>One day, while Qin Sang was resting after refining his last magical weapon, he heard a guard knocking at the door.  He learned that Ran Luo was visiting, and his heart stirred. He quickly opened the door.</p><p>“Daoist Ran, do you have news?”</p><p>“Daoist Qin, you’ve worked hard.”</p><p>Ran Luo nodded and looked around before saying, “Elder Zou has learned of the matter and has sent a letter. Please come with me, Daoist Qin.”</p><p>The two returned to their quarters, and Ran Luo handed Qin Sang a letter.</p><p>The content of the letter was simple. Qin Sang glanced over it, and as he held the paper, his expression changed, and he fell silent.</p><p>After a while, Ran Luo softly said, "The information Elder Zou found is probably true.  He said even he didn't expect the East Extreme Alliance's demands to be so harsh.  Not only do they want all the spirit stones, but they also require everyone to act together."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded subconsciously.</p><p>The spirit stones were expected, though the number was staggering.  He could almost gather the required amount by selling his demon core.</p><p>The second requirement was what made Qin Sang hesitate.</p><p>The East Extreme Alliance demanded that all their members, upon entering the Seven Killing Hall, must obey their orders and not act independently. They could only pursue their own affairs after completing the assigned task.</p><p>The Alliance didn't specify the task, only saying it wouldn't take too long, shamelessly labeling it "confidential."</p><p>The East Extreme Alliance's confidence showed how rare the opportunity to enter the Seven Killing Hall must be.</p><p>In contrast, the Qiong Yu Trading Company's request, or rather, Elder Zou's request, was much simpler.  Elder Zou hoped Qin Sang would genuinely join the Qiong Yu Trading Company and, like Ran Luo, manage affairs on a large island.</p><p>"I only recently formed my Golden Core; I'm afraid I'm hardly up to the task," Qin Sang tentatively said.</p><p>Ran Luo smiled slightly. "Why be so modest, Daoist? You easily killed even a direct disciple of Black Serpent Mountain. Your strength is unfathomable. I am far inferior."</p><p>"Black Serpent Mountain...?"</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't heard of the name, but a sudden thought struck him.</p><p>Ran Luo nodded and said seriously, "The person who ambushed you back then was likely a direct disciple of the Black Serpent Mountain ancestor of the Wu tribe. After you killed him, the people from Black Serpent Mountain lost track of you and wouldn't let it go. After the great turmoil between the two tribes ended, they sent people to Duoyan Island to secretly investigate your identity. Fortunately, I discovered them in time. Elder Zou, using the island master's authority, secretly drove them off the island and set up several traps to mislead them.  Daoist, don't worry.  Only Elder Zou and I know about this; they certainly won't be able to trace it back to you."</p>
