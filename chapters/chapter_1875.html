<h1>Chapter 1866: The Demon's Drum</h1><p>“My explanation has been rather general, and I cannot fully expound on the Great Dao, but some principles are universal.  The skillful application lies in one's heart; you must understand this for yourself…”</p><p>Zuo Zhenren used these words to conclude his teaching, a caution to Qin Sang to use it as a reference, not to blindly follow, lest it hinder his own path.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, committing Zuo Zhenren's advice to memory.  At his level of cultivation, he understood this principle perfectly well.</p><p>Straightening his robes, Qin Sang bowed deeply to Zuo Zhenren, who received the bow calmly.</p><p>This act of Zuo Zhenren was true teaching.</p><p>For Qin Sang, the value lay not only in clarifying the direction of his future cultivation, but also in gaining a deeper understanding of the Great Dao, a benefit that would last a lifetime.</p><p>Zuo Zhenren's teachings partly stemmed from his own experience, partly from Daoist scriptures and traditions, and his explanation of the Way of Force originated from the demon cultivators of this world—rooted in talismanic arts.</p><p>But the Great Dao leads to the same destination by different paths.</p><p>Qin Sang cultivated the *Heavenly Demon Transformation*, absorbing stellar energy to refine his body; this had no connection to talismanic arts, yet he, like the demon cultivators of this world, could cultivate a Dharma Aspect, a clear testament to this fact.</p><p>Zuo Zhenren nodded slightly and slowly closed his eyes.</p><p>The golden armored warrior also remained silent, standing guard before Zuo Zhenren, its gaze fixed on Qin Sang, though its eyes lacked any life.</p><p>Clearly, Zuo Zhenren had withdrawn the wisp of his consciousness from the golden armored warrior and was concentrating on his breathing.</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang did not disturb Zuo Zhenren, but sat down slowly, his face still in deep thought.</p><p>He was pondering the *Heavenly Demon Transformation*. He had previously considered this cultivation method extraordinary, but he had underestimated it.</p><p>According to Zuo Zhenren, the Dharma Aspect was a manifestation of 'external scenery'.  The fact that he was able to form a Dharma Aspect phantom at the Yuan Ying stage was astonishing.</p><p>“It must be related to the Azure Bird’s blood…”</p><p>Qin Sang mused.</p><p>The more he reflected on Zuo Zhenren’s words, the more he felt the profound mystery of the *Heavenly Demon Transformation*.</p><p>This method followed a path of ‘first knowing the what, then knowing the why’, first allowing the cultivator to cultivate a Dharma Aspect, then comprehending the Dharma Aspect and understanding the Great Dao, which was clearly much easier than blindly stumbling around.</p><p>The creator of such a cultivation method must have possessed extremely high cultivation and a profound understanding of the Great Dao to achieve such masterful skill and effortless grace.</p><p>This was truly a profound method!</p><p>“Remarkable. Unfortunately, I’m not a demon; this method isn't suited to humans,” Qin Sang sighed.</p><p>For a demon cultivator, this single cultivation method would be enough!</p><p>The following time, Qin Sang was completely immersed in thought, not even glancing at the treasures before him.</p><p>The Demon King's belongings, rare treasures seldom seen in the outside world, lay on the ground, untouched.</p><p>“Balancing the Five Elements…”</p><p>Qin Sang examined his inner self, his ‘gaze’ falling on his dantian, sensing the circulation of his true energy.</p><p>How could he achieve a balance among the Five Elements without favoring one over another?</p><p>He certainly hadn't achieved this yet.</p><p>The *Chapter on Cultivating the Nascent Soul Sword* had no elemental attributes. In the beginning of his cultivation, Qin Sang had chosen an ebony sword, refining a body of Wood Spirit true energy.</p><p>“Since it requires all five elements, I will absorb the five elemental spiritual qi simultaneously and harmonize them within my body…”</p><p>Qin Sang stroked his chin, pondering to himself, “It will certainly be difficult at first, and I must start with the generative and destructive cycles of the Five Elements. I don’t expect to truly achieve the ceaseless generative cycle of the Five Elements, but at least they shouldn’t conflict with each other, lest I destroy my foundation. It will require considerable effort…”</p><p>He knew he couldn't do this immediately. The urgent task was to quickly improve his cultivation, at least until he broke through to the late stage of the Transcending God realm before attempting this, but he also couldn't delay too long; he feared that at the peak of the Transcending God realm it would be too late to change. He needed to carefully consider this.</p><p>Qin Sang's thoughts continued to wander, “Could I use external objects, or even other cultivation methods and secret techniques?”</p><p>He thought of the *Fire Seed Golden Lotus*, the Four-fold Serpent Seal, and the Five Element Crown, but he lacked inspiration.</p><p>At this moment, the golden armored warrior’s eyes flashed with golden light, and it said in a deep voice, “Have you made your selection, Daoist Friend?”</p><p>Qin Sang was startled back to reality. He saw that Zuo Zhenren's complexion had improved, becoming noticeably rosier, suggesting he was about to depart.</p><p>He quickly dismissed his stray thoughts and looked down at the treasures on the ground.</p><p>After a moment, Qin Sang made his decision. With a flick of his sleeve, his true energy swept up all the spiritual materials that could be, or might be, used for refining weapons.</p><p>He had decided that instead of taking those treasures of unclear use and uncertain value, he would choose materials for refinement.</p><p>He still wished to make further progress in the Way of Refinement, and these materials would definitely be useful.</p><p>In the future, even if they couldn't be used to repair the Taiyi Star Chart, they could be exchanged for other materials.</p><p>Qin Sang could not identify all of these materials, but since they were collected by the Demon King, each was undoubtedly of great value.</p><p>Among those materials he recognized, three were extremely rare: a section of withered vine, a crystal whose interior displayed ever-changing cloud patterns, and a very heavy golden stone.</p><p>That crystal was called the Yan Tu Yuan Crystal.  Gu Zhenren had once lamented his inability to obtain it; only a Grand Master could hope to acquire such a treasure.</p><p>It seems you are interested in the art of crafting magical artifacts, my friend.  Unfortunately, my knowledge in this area is limited..."</p><p>The golden armored warrior gestured towards the spiritually imbued objects wrapped in true essence, pointing to a piece of curled cloud brocade.  "This is Jade God Silk. It’s not naturally occurring; it's woven from the silk of a rare jade silkworm, combined with the essence of a Glacial Birch tree's heartwood.  The method of crafting it is lost to time. Only a type of avian spirit beast in the Gui Fang kingdom, called a Qihua bird, can recreate it using its magical abilities. It's incredibly rare. Not only is it exquisitely beautiful, but it also possesses extraordinary mystical properties. It's perfect for creating protective garments. Many cultivators covet a piece of Jade God Silk but cannot obtain one. That non-metal, non-wood object is…"</p><p>The golden armored warrior rapidly described several of the magical objects.</p><p>"Thank you for your guidance, senior," Qin Sang expressed his gratitude.  Left Zhenren’s casual remark saved him a lot of trouble.</p><p>Left Zhenren smiled faintly. "These magical objects, while precious, are nothing compared to the four spiritual treasures.  Keep a few of those pills for yourself; take the rest.  Some are healing pills, but most aren't suitable for me; you might find them useful later. Others refine the body, but they may not be compatible with our human physiology; use them cautiously."</p><p>Qin Sang looked at the small pile of jade bottles on the ground. He had already set his sights on these pills, guessing that Left Zhenren wouldn't want them, so he hadn't rushed to take them. Now that Left Zhenren offered them, he didn't hesitate to store them in his Qianjun Ring.</p><p>Neither of them were petty, so the distribution was quick.  Qin Sang received several more treasures, some of which even Left Zhenren couldn't identify. His gains were substantial.</p><p>An incense stick later…</p><p>A loud ringing of golden chains echoed. The golden armored warriors simultaneously raised their arms, the golden chains wrapping around their arms with a 'whoosh, whoosh, whoosh' sound.</p><p>A brilliant golden light erupted from the warriors, and when the light subsided, they had transformed into numerous golden beads, each the size of a soybean.</p><p>Left Zhenren flicked his sleeve, gathering all the beads into it. He stood up, patted his robe, his expression returning to normal. He nodded to Qin Sang. "Qingfeng Daoist, we should leave. Do you need to prepare anything else?"</p><p>"No, I'm ready."</p><p>Qin Sang rose. His strength had recovered to about eighty or ninety percent. As for his injuries, he could only temporarily suppress them with pills – just as Left Zhenren would do.</p><p>Another tremor emanated from deep within the altar.  The two stood side-by-side, staring for a moment before they launched themselves into the air, breaking through the atmosphere.</p><p>Left Zhenren, anxious about the battle, flew at great speed, but Qin Sang was able to keep up.</p><p>Meanwhile, Liu Zhenren, following Left Zhenren's instructions, anxiously awaited his return.  Suddenly, he sensed two powerful auras whooshing past; one was Left Zhenren. He hurriedly pursued them but only heard a command to leave the altar.</p><p>Soon, they were beyond the blue sea of light, but unfortunately, they hadn't encountered Ding Xiang Hou and the other demons.</p><p>During their flight, Qin Sang and Left Zhenren exchanged information in secret. First, Left Zhenren explained the key points of formation warfare and the divine abilities of the Great Masters within the altar, to help Qin Sang integrate into the Daoist court.  Later, it was mostly Qin Sang asking Left Zhenren for guidance.</p><p>"I dare to ask, senior…" Qin Sang hesitated, "In ancient texts I've read, it's stated explicitly that the heavens are vast, encompassing both Great and Small Thousands. So, is this world a Small Thousand World or a Great Thousand World?"  This question had plagued him for a long time.</p><p>As soon as he asked, Qin Sang sensed two gazes upon him.</p><p>"Heh heh… Qingfeng Daoist also knows of the Great Thousand. I had the same question in my youth, and asked several True Masters.  They only answered with four words – 'Self-contained realm'."</p><p>"Self-contained realm?"</p><p>Qin Sang frowned. It sounded like a Small Thousand World, but there seemed to be a deeper meaning.</p><p>Clearly, the Daoist Court and the True Masters knew of the Great Thousand World's existence, but seemed uninterested in it.</p><p>Left Zhenren himself didn't seem to fully understand and offered no further explanation, leaving Qin Sang to ponder it himself.</p><p>They passed through layers of illusions, the journey becoming more difficult. Left Zhenren, with his keen spiritual perception and boundless abilities, quickly discerned the intricacies.</p><p>Later, they found markers left by Daoist Masters, putting them on the right track and speeding up their progress.</p><p>Qin Sang was happy to remain unassuming, avoiding revealing his previous explorations of this place.  It would be difficult to explain.</p><p>However, they were far behind; catching up to the battlefield in a short time was impossible.</p><p>The tremors from deep within the altar became more frequent and intense; Left Zhenren's anxious expression was clear.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>'Crash!'</p><p>'Bang bang bang…'</p><p>Suddenly, a powerful tremor spread, affecting the entire altar. The illusions surrounding them instantly dissolved into chaos.</p><p>This tremor was more violent than any before, comparable to the golden light's eruption.</p><p>Qin Sang was on high alert, about to ask a question, when he suddenly felt a pang of inexplicable fear.</p><p>The next moment, Qin Sang heard a drumbeat.</p><p>‘Dong!’</p><p>The sound resonated from deep within the ritual platform, penetrating layers of illusions without losing its power.  The sound was strong, carrying a strange energy that lingered in her ears and heart, refusing to dissipate.</p><p>Instantly, Qin Sang's heart pounded, her blood surging as if about to burst from her head.</p><p>It was an unprecedented feeling.</p><p>The drumbeat was incredibly overwhelming!</p><p>“What was that?”</p><p>Stopping abruptly, Qin Sang turned to Zuo Zhenren, her face grave.</p><p>Such power at this distance… was it the Divine Court, or some supreme treasure?</p><p>Qin Sang noticed Zuo Zhenren had also stopped, intently focused on the drum's origin.</p><p>‘Dong!’</p><p>The second drumbeat was even more powerful than the first!</p><p>“The Demonic-Summoning Drum!”</p><p>Zuo Zhenren suddenly cried out in alarm.</p><p>…</p><p>Outside the ritual platform.</p><p>Since the Daoist Court and Gui Fang Kingdom had amassed their forces, the conflicts within the platform had been intense, while the outside remained relatively restrained.</p><p>The soldiers' initial fervor gradually waned during the standoff, creating a heavy atmosphere on the battlefield.</p><p>Until the Divine Court appeared, its strange phenomena obscured by auspicious clouds.  However, the unique energy fluctuations couldn't escape the perception of the Grand Masters and the Demon Kings.</p><p>At once, the Grand Masters and Demon Kings materialized above the battlefield, restraining their cultivation as much as possible, yet still causing celestial phenomena.</p><p>Thunder shook the mountains and fields.</p><p>Dark clouds crackled with lightning in the sky, while sand and stones swirled on the ground.</p><p>Within the clouds, powerful figures were vaguely visible, forming two opposing camps mirroring the battlefield below.</p><p>However, their gaze was fixed on the ritual platform, sensing the continuous tremors, their expressions varied, their eyes filled with wonder.</p><p>‘Dong! Dong! Dong!’</p><p>War drums pounded on the battlefield, their sound resounding.</p><p>“Roar! Roar! Roar!”</p><p>Both sides roared, their morale instantly boosted.  Their eyes glowed red, fixed on their enemies, poised to attack.</p><p>The tension escalated, a spark away from ignition.</p><p>At that moment, a drumbeat, utterly different from the war drums, reached the ears of all cultivators and demon cultivators.</p><p>The war drums fell silent.</p><p>All present held their breath, a profound silence descended.</p><p>Above the dark clouds, a Grand Master uttered the same exclamation as Zuo Zhenren, “It's the Demonic-Summoning Drum! Those demons dare bring the Demonic-Summoning Drum into the Vile Wasteland!”</p><p>The Grand Masters' expressions changed drastically, turning to stare at the opposing Demon Kings, disbelief etched on their faces.</p><p>The Demon Kings, equally startled by the drumbeat, exchanged glances.  Sensing the Grand Masters' gaze, they erupted in boisterous laughter.</p><p>A tall Demon King in a black robe suppressed his laughter, his expression sinister as he stared at the Grand Masters.  His voice, hoarse yet chilling, sent shivers down their spines:  “Hear my command!  If the Daoists dare make a move, I order you—kill!”</p><p>The command swept across the battlefield, driving the demon cultivators into a frenzy.</p><p>…</p><p>While Qin Sang and Ling You Wang grappled, the masters of the Daoist Court and Gui Fang Kingdom raced towards the South Heavenly Gate.</p><p>Initially, they seized opportunities to attack each other, but finding it ineffective, they focused solely on escape.</p><p>The Daoist Court Grand Masters, centered around the Old Daoist, formed a battle formation, their energies converging into one. The Grand Masters spared no expense, unleashing several rare talismans.</p><p>Transforming into streaks of light, they resolutely shattered all obstacles in their path.</p><p>In contrast, the Demon Kings' departure was far more spectacular.</p><p>The Demon Kings selected for the ritual platform were carefully chosen, each possessing a unique cultivation path encompassing Yin and Yang, and the Five Elements.</p><p>Most illusions were related to Yin and Yang and the Five Elements, allowing them to frequently find a Demon King whose Dharma Image could manipulate the illusions, greatly enhancing their strength and ensuring swift passage.</p><p>Other Demon Kings would also utilize their Dharma Images in coordination, their speed no less than the Daoist Grand Masters.</p><p>As time went on, the Daoist side consumed more and more talismans, but thankfully, they were well-prepared and could sustain themselves.</p><p>The Old Daoist's expression, however, was filled with anxiety.  Maintaining pace wasn't sustainable.  The farther they traveled, the harder it would be for others to catch up; ultimately, only they would face the enemy.</p><p>The situation demanded immediate action.</p><p>Finally, after a frantic flight, the imperial decree radiated a blinding light, signaling their proximity to the Divine Court.</p><p>The Divine Court's energy fluctuations persisted; even without seeing the South Heavenly Gate, they could lock onto its location via the decree.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>Water reached the sky, as the demons arrived on surging water currents.</p><p>The water receded, leaving the demons in place, excitedly staring ahead.</p><p>Simultaneously, a roaring sound came from behind.  The White-robed Demon King turned, snorted, his eyes gleaming with killing intent.</p>
