<h1>Chapter 628: A Glimmer of Spirit, Return to the Cycle</h1><p>When did the gray mist enter his body? He hadn't noticed it at all!</p><p>Qin Sang felt a chill down his spine.</p><p>Could it have been when he had just been transported, while he was unconscious?</p><p>He couldn't remember how long he had been out.</p><p>Could he have encountered something strange during that time without realizing it? He hadn't appeared at the other end of the transportation formation, but was floating on the river. Could it be because of this gray mist?</p><p>There was another possibility: that he was awake when the gray mist invaded him, but hadn't noticed.</p><p>Two places were the most suspicious: the bronze hall in the Violet Palace and the ancient transportation formation.</p><p>Both were built by ancient cultivators and held their own mysteries.</p><p>In the bronze hall, Qin Sang's life had been in another's hands. He was focused on escaping and had no time to carefully examine the layout.</p><p>However, he still remembered the altar, the demonic pit, and the blood pearl in Chen Yan's hand.</p><p>None of them seemed like benign objects.</p><p>As for the ancient transportation formation, even present-day cultivators couldn't unravel its secrets, let alone this one that required two high-grade spirit stones and could transport across such a vast distance.</p><p>During the transportation, Qin Sang felt a terrifying power bearing down on him, almost tearing him apart.</p><p>Either of these places could be the source of the gray mist.</p><p>But Qin Sang couldn't figure out what the gray mist was or why it had sought him out.</p><p>He began to probe it with a trace of true essence, but whether from his Corpse Pill or Gold Core, the true essence was swallowed by the gray mist like a stone sinking into the sea, without any reaction.</p><p>His divine sense was the same. Upon entering, it was immediately severed, leaving Qin Sang unable to perceive anything within the gray mist.</p><p>Later, he boldly used more true essence and divine sense to attack the gray mist, but the result was the same.</p><p>It was as if the gray mist had made itself at home in his qi sea, even more stubborn than the forbidden talisman fragments!</p><p>The only good news was that this gray mist remained quietly in his dantian, next to his Gold Core, without moving, and didn't interfere with his cultivation or combat.</p><p>It bothered him, but Qin Sang couldn't do anything about it.</p><p>Helpless, he could only allow the gray mist to occupy his dantian.</p><p>Fortunately, it seemed harmless for now. He'd find a way to deal with it after his cultivation improved.</p><p>Out of sight, out of mind. Qin Sang shifted his 'gaze' from his dantian to his physical body and nascent soul.</p><p>Forming his Gold Core had brought about an all-around improvement. The stubborn corpse energy in his body had been completely purged the moment spiritual energy flooded his body.</p><p>He no longer had to worry about turning into a corpse.</p><p>Recalling the scene when he was rescued by the mute girl from the Qingyi River, Qin Sang gave a wry smile.</p><p>At the time, he was drifting among the debris, missing an arm, with corpse energy erupting from his body. Not only was he bloodless, but his skin had turned a bluish-black, almost resembling a vicious ghost.</p><p>The mute girl, washing clothes by the river, was startled by the armless corpse and almost kicked him back into the river. Fortunately, Qin Sang woke up and cried for help, and she brought him home.</p><p>Otherwise, he didn't know how much longer he would have drifted. If he had drifted into the wilderness, it would have been even more dangerous.</p><p>"I'll return to Thousand Households Village first to settle my karmic debt with the mute girl, and then go search for spirit insects and the forbidden area," Qin Sang thought.</p><p>The Five Insect Sect's geomantic map wasn't detailed about the outside world, especially the wilderness. It only marked the habitats of about twenty kinds of spirit insects, none of which Qin Sang wanted.</p><p>He could wait until the Five Insect Sect gathered more information before searching for his natal insect gu.</p><p>As for the ancient transportation formation, he could only search slowly. He planned to follow the river he had drifted on first to see if he could find anything.</p><p>With these thoughts, Qin Sang opened his Thousand Jun Ring and retrieved the three Ten Yama Banners.</p><p>One was intact, and two were damaged, but only the banners themselves were affected.</p><p>According to Patriarch Kui Yin's refining method, he only needed to condense the purest soul power into threads to repair these two magical treasures.</p><p>The three Ten Yama Banners could be arranged into a simple formation, yet possess the power of a mid-grade magical treasure. For the time being, they would be Qin Sang's most powerful treasures.</p><p>The Ebony Sword and the Mixed Yuan Concentric Rings were both low-grade magical treasures.</p><p>Now that he had formed his Gold Core, Qin Sang could begin the repairs.</p><p>He placed the two damaged treasures on his lap and then took out all the Ten Yama Banner talismans.</p><p>Besides the ten he used himself, there were fourteen seized from the remnants of the Kui Yin Sect, more than two full sets.</p><p>These two sets of ghost banners were even more powerful than talisman treasures, arguably the strongest below the level of magical treasures.</p><p>Now that he had formed his Gold Core, Qin Sang no longer needed them. But if he were to auction them, they would surely cause a sensation, with countless Foundation Establishment cultivators vying for them, fetching a good price.</p><p>However, repairing magical treasures required a vast amount of pure soul energy. These twenty-four banners might not be enough.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't leave the Western Frontier for now. This barren land likely didn't have many soul-refining tools. If he couldn't gather enough pure soul energy, he would have to extract the souls from the ghost banners to repair the magical treasures.</p><p>Whether searching for insects or for secret realms and forbidden areas, he would have to venture deep into the wilderness. Qin Sang needed to increase his strength as quickly as possible and couldn't wait any longer.</p><p>*Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh...*</p><p>Twenty-four small ghost banners flew out of Qin Sang's hand and planted themselves in three rows on the ground.</p><p>He reviewed the refining method several times, then picked up the least damaged magical treasure and simultaneously summoned a ghost banner from the ground.</p><p>*Whoosh...*</p><p>Suddenly, a ghostly wind howled, and the cave became extremely cold, filled with shadowy figures.</p><p>*Crack!*</p><p>The ghost banner suddenly shattered.</p><p>Unfazed, Qin Sang discarded the destroyed banner. He thrust his palm forward, and his powerful true essence instantly enveloped the ghostly wind, compressing it into a ball that floated towards him.</p><p>Chilling ghostly wails rose and fell.</p><p>Unmoved, Qin Sang's hand seals changed repeatedly, his fingertips shooting out complex restrictions into the ghostly wind.</p><p>A moment later, a grayish-white smoke slowly emerged from the wind, extremely fine, like a thread. This was the purest soul energy condensed into a soul thread, which could be directly used to weave the banners of the Ten Yama Banners.</p><p>As the soul thread was extracted, the ghostly wind gradually subsided.</p><p>Soon, the soul thread broke off, less than a foot long.</p><p>Destroying one ghost banner yielded only such a short piece of soul thread. It was hard to imagine how Patriarch Kui Yin had gathered enough for ten magical treasures.</p><p>Qin Sang beckoned with a finger, and the soul thread floated to his fingertip, seemingly alive, wrapping itself around it, giving off a chilling sensation.</p><p>He didn't rush to repair the magical treasure, but looked back at the ghostly wind.</p><p>The wails had stopped, but some souls hadn't dissipated, drifting in the wind as green flickers, the last vestiges of their spirits.</p><p>It was said in the cultivation world that a glimmer of spirit offered a chance for reincarnation.</p><p>The Ten Yama Banner magical treasures were, in this way, less malicious than the talismans.</p><p>Repairing the treasures only required the purest soul energy and didn't necessitate further imprisonment of the souls.</p><p>"Does reincarnation truly exist?" Qin Sang murmured, finally waving his hand and releasing the ghostly wind.</p><p>The flickers of light drifted about, gradually fading away.</p>
