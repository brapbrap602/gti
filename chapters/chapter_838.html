<h1>Chapter 830: The Decision</h1><p>Chapter 830: The Decision</p><p>When Qin Sang arrived at the small courtyard, Madam Liu was already waiting.</p><p>It had only been a few years since she left the Seven Kills Hall, yet her cultivation had improved significantly, nearing the late Jindan stage.</p><p>Despite this advancement, her face showed no joy, only a faint sadness and weariness.</p><p>Years of tracking Xiang Yi had taken a heavy toll.</p><p>"I finally see you in person, Daoist,"</p><p>Madam Liu said softly, a hint of reproach in her voice.  When Qin Sang left Tianxing Island, Madam Liu, being no match for Xiang Yi, had missed a golden opportunity.</p><p>Qin Sang knew he was at fault. "I had no choice; a crucial matter required my immediate attention. Madam, your investigation into Xiang Yi must have yielded some results, right?"</p><p>Madam Liu was intelligent; she briefly expressed her displeasure but didn't dwell on it. Her expression turned serious. "Thank goodness you returned in time, Daoist. Otherwise, I would have despaired."</p><p>"What do you mean?"</p><p>Qin Sang activated the spirit array, inviting Madam Liu inside to sit down, and then set up a sound-proofing restriction.</p><p>They sat down.</p><p>After settling, Madam Liu explained, "Daoist, remember what I mentioned before? Xiang Yi is highly regarded by the Merchant Alliance leader, and after leaving the Seven Kills Hall, he would soon reach the peak of the late stage."</p><p>"Of course, I remember," Qin Sang said gravely, "Has he already broken through?"</p><p>Qin Sang had encountered late-stage peak experts before, but he always managed to prevail for specific reasons.</p><p>For example, he ambushed the young man from the Xiyou Alliance, destroying his anti-poison artifact with his Blood-Polluting Light and using the resulting toxic fog to kill him.  The mysterious body cultivator was burned to death by the Dongming Cold Flame.</p><p>Recently, his opponent's abilities were completely countered by the Jade Buddha.</p><p>"That's precisely what I fear. After returning, I immediately started investigating Xiang Yi's whereabouts. Before his breakthrough, there was a slim chance, but you were absent, Daoist. I dared not act rashly, lest I alert him, and could only watch helplessly as the villain continued his reign of terror..."</p><p>The Liu couple deeply loved each other, and now Madam Liu’s hatred for Xiang Yi had only intensified. "Thankfully, fate intervened. Xiang Yi didn't cultivate in seclusion for long before being forced to leave his retreat; he hasn't broken through yet. You must have heard about the upheaval in the Demon Sea, Daoist."</p><p>"Are you referring to the demon tribe's unrest?"</p><p>Qin Sang nodded.  Various rumors had been circulating increasingly.</p><p>"It's said the demon tribe is stirring, with frequent beast tides in the Demon Sea, and even long-standing large islands have been attacked. However, I believe this is just a new cycle, a back-and-forth struggle like before. Regardless, the human and Wu tribes won't abandon the Demon Sea."</p><p>Madam Liu hummed. "Whatever the demons' intentions or how the battle unfolds, it's beyond our control.  The beast tides are actually advantageous to us. To counter the crisis, the Merchant Alliance has dispatched its top experts to the Demon Sea, including Xiang Yi. He, who should be in closed cultivation, has had to interrupt his training and answer the call. He's currently on an island in the Demon Sea. After returning, he will immediately close himself off to breakthrough.  Therefore, this may be our only chance..."</p><p>Pausing slightly, Madam Liu added, "Acting in the Demon Sea offers another advantage. With the current chaos, if Xiang Yi dies there, the Merchant Alliance will only assume he was careless and perished at the fangs of a beast. They won't suspect us..."</p><p>"It seems you've made thorough preparations, Daoist."</p><p>Qin Sang looked deeply at Madam Liu.</p><p>As Madam Liu said, the timing was indeed excellent. The only problem was that going into the Demon Sea now meant going against the tide, risking being swept away.</p><p>Madam Liu, eager for revenge, had disregarded her own safety.</p><p>Xiang Yi must be killed; otherwise, Qin Sang would have no peace of mind. However, sacrificing herself wouldn't be worth it.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered in silence, weighing the options. He decided that a trip might be feasible.</p><p>While the demon tribe was powerful, the human and Wu tribes, after years of development, had considerable strength in the Demon Sea and wouldn't be easily defeated.</p><p>He was confident in his improved swordsmanship and the protection of his Star Conch treasure. Even if he encountered danger in the Demon Sea, he could cope.</p><p>Killing Xiang Yi would not only eliminate a major threat but also bring Qin Sang a substantial reward, saving him from future distractions and allowing him to focus on cultivation.</p><p>He needed to cultivate the *Heavenly Demon Transformation* to the late third stage before the next opening of the Seven Kills Hall, and time was tight.</p><p>Xiang Yi, a powerful cultivator and close associate of the East Pole Alliance leader, undoubtedly possessed significant wealth.</p><p>Madam Liu, to persuade Qin Sang to help, promised him all the spoils from killing Xiang Yi.  </p><p>Qin Sang, however, had a secret motive: he wanted to visit Huntian Island and see if he could acquire more Dongming Cold Flames.  He still coveted the flames; the power of the fire pearls they created was unforgettable.  A few more pearls would make him unstoppable at the Golden Core stage.  </p><p>The Dongming Cold Flames were guarded by the Huntian Island master's men.  Qin Sang had previously stolen a wisp of the flames, but dared not return for fear of a trap.  Transformed demons and Nascent Soul masters couldn't subdue the flames, yet he had managed to take some. The island master, if he knew, would never forgive him.</p><p>The current demon uprising kept the island master preoccupied, presenting a good opportunity.  However, he wasn't sure if the flames were still there.</p><p>Madam Liu anxiously awaited Qin Sang's reply.</p><p>"Besides myself, Madam Liu, did you find any other helpers?" Qin Sang asked, instead of immediately agreeing.</p><p>Madam Liu sighed, "My husband's savings are almost gone.  Even if I find help, who would dare to face a late-stage expert, especially an ally of the League Master? I only have one friend, currently surveilling Xiang Yi in the Demon Sea, but she only recently reached the Golden Core stage and can't offer much assistance.  I have a plan: we'll lure Xiang Yi off the island and attack him there. I managed to obtain a rare and valuable talisman that can temporarily suppress his true essence, weakening him. But it needs time to activate, and during that time, you must hold Xiang Yi off to buy me time…"</p><p>To convince Qin Sang, Madam Liu revealed her entire plan without reservation.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded silently.  He wouldn't fully trust her plan, of course. He would assess the situation and adapt accordingly.  Even if the assassination failed, he could ensure his escape.</p><p>"Very well, I will go with you, Madam. However, this is sudden. I need a night to make arrangements.  May we leave tomorrow morning?"</p><p>Qin Sang agreed.</p><p>Madam Liu's face lit up with joy. "We mustn't delay!  You must hurry, Daoist!"</p>
