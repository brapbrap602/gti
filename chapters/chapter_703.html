<h1>Chapter 695: The Bone Flute Again</h1><p>The market was surprisingly located underground.</p><p>Cultivators had magically carved out a space, protected by powerful restrictions and formations.  The subterranean area was divided into two sections, separated by a stone gate. Only cultivators at the Golden Core stage were allowed into the inner section.</p><p>Arriving in the underground space, Qin Sang saw many extremely simple stone houses, clearly meant for single use and then abandonment.</p><p>Many cultivators were already milling about, moving between the various houses.</p><p>Han Cuo and his companions offered to show Qin Sang around, but he politely declined.</p><p>Han Cuo dismissed the others, then turned to Qin Sang and said, “I just inquired. The inner trading event will be held in a few days, after all the Golden Core cultivators have arrived.  Why don't you browse the outer market for now? Many of the stone houses here belong to managers from large trading companies on Huntian Island. They are all reputable.  Feel free to buy whatever you need. I have some things to attend to, so I won't disturb you further, Qin Dao You. I'll come find you when the trading event begins.”</p><p>“Please do as you wish, Han Dao You.”</p><p>Qin Sang watched Han Cuo enter a stone house, then after a moment's thought, began to explore the market.</p><p>He eventually selected several trading companies and finalized his transactions.</p><p>By this time, his storage ring, previously filled with demonic corpses, artifacts, and a large amount of spirit stones, was now full of pills, talismans, and other supplies. He was at least set for the next decade and a half.</p><p>He attempted to purchase some pills that would improve his cultivation, but they were far more expensive than he'd anticipated, and the market had very few, making them even more costly.</p><p>Qin Sang held onto some of his artifacts and demonic cores, planning to see if he could exchange them for more desirable treasures at the inner trading event.</p><p>It's worth noting that he managed to acquire three venomous beast inner cores from one trading company, enough to sustain the Fat Silkworm until the later stages of its second transformation.</p><p>Qin Sang also bought a large quantity of herbs favored by the Sky-Eyed Butterfly.</p><p>Even if he couldn't immediately head to the Qianyao Sea Region, Qin Sang had no intention of leaving Huntian Island.  This rare opportunity allowed him to fully replenish his supplies.</p><p>His greatest concern was the situation in the Qianyao Sea Region.</p><p>After some investigation, Qin Sang’s expression grew increasingly grave.  The information gathered from these trading companies was consistent with what Han Cuo had said: the route through the Qianyao Sea Region was definitely impassable.</p><p>He tried to obtain information on alternative routes, but found none.</p><p>Only one trading company manager suggested that Qin Sang try his luck at the inner trading event in a few days.</p><p>Perhaps some expert had unexpectedly discovered a new path through the Qianyao Sea Region, but such discoveries were generally kept secret.  If Qin Sang was willing to pay enough, he might be able to convince someone to reveal it.</p><p>After numerous inquiries yielded nothing, Qin Sang entered the inner section, rented a stone house, and patiently waited.</p><p>Before the trading event began, Golden Core cultivators began to arrive one after another.</p><p>After two days in the inner section, Qin Sang stepped out of his stone house and unexpectedly found that several fellow cultivators had gathered in the small square outside, displaying their treasures and seemingly negotiating trades.</p><p>Qin Sang's interest piqued, and he strode over.</p><p>The cultivators in the square noticed Qin Sang and looked over. Some nodded amicably, others coldly averted their gaze.</p><p>Approaching the square, Qin Sang was somewhat disappointed by the items displayed by the outermost cultivators.  These were treasures that Foundation Establishment cultivators would covet, but for Golden Core cultivators, they were rather unremarkable. It seemed they were all saving their best treasures for the main event.</p><p>“A poison pill?”</p><p>Just as Qin Sang was about to leave, he spotted a poison pill, and strode over to haggle with the seller before purchasing it.</p><p>There weren't many people, but to ensure privacy, they sat quite far apart.</p><p>Qin Sang acquired several items he needed and soon reached the end of the square. He saw a thin middle-aged man sitting cross-legged on a cushion.</p><p>The man's aura was strange, faint and elusive. His complexion was unusually pale and gaunt, like someone severely injured and depleted of Qi and blood.</p><p>Although, this wasn't necessarily the case; some unique cultivation techniques could produce similar effects.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn’t stare too long.  His gaze quickly scanned over the man, and then his interest shifted to the items laid before him.</p><p>The man had several jade bottles containing pills and a large pile of demonic corpse materials, but not a single demonic core.</p><p>Just as Qin Sang was about to pass the man and return to his stone house, he noticed something familiar, and his eyes suddenly narrowed in shock.</p><p>It was a segment of bone, about the size of a finger bone!</p><p>The bone was hollow, with a jade-like, oily luster, identical to the bone flute he had obtained from the Shadow Leopard!</p><p>In Ziwei Palace, he and Yun Youzi had contended with the Shadow Leopard for the Crimson Cloud Purple Fruit.  In the end, he used the Xuantian Thunder to drive the Shadow Leopard away.</p><p>The aftershocks of the Xuantian Thunder shattered the golden ring around the Shadow Leopard's neck, revealing the bone flute.</p><p>They discovered this bone flute was connected to stellar energy; it couldn't be stored in a spatial pouch, but Qin Sang successfully put it into his storage ring.</p><p>Yun Youzi guessed it might be a fragment of some treasure.</p><p>After putting it away, Qin Sang didn't give it much thought.  Finding such a thing in the vast world of cultivation was incredibly unlikely; he harbored no hope.</p><p>Yet, unimaginably far away, in the Canglang Sea, he saw a second bone flute.</p><p>No mistake, it was the same thing!</p><p>The moment Qin Sang saw it, he sensed the identical aura.  This one, just like the one he possessed, resonated with the power of the celestial stars!</p><p>The same treasure, shattered and scattered to such distant locations… what had happened?</p><p>Qin Sang was astonished and secretly alarmed.</p><p>Were these two bone flutes all that remained of the treasure? What would happen if they were reunited?</p><p>Qin Sang was incredibly curious, but his expression remained unchanged. He calmly stood before the stall owner, his gaze fixed on the flute.</p><p>The stall owner opened his eyes, saw Qin Sang, and asked in a raspy voice, "What has caught your interest, sir?"</p><p>Qin Sang sighed inwardly.  Apart from the flute, everything else the stall owner displayed was ordinary. The flute's uniqueness was evident to anyone.</p><p>Finding a bargain was impossible.</p><p>However, the stall owner's raspy voice hinted at a possible underlying illness, piquing Qin Sang's interest.</p><p>Qin Sang went straight to the point, pointing at the bone flute, and asked, "Sir, what is this bone object? Might I examine it?"</p><p>The stall owner was startled.  His gaze subtly scanned Qin Sang's chest and surroundings before he nodded. "I don't know its name.  If you wish to examine it, please feel free."</p><p>Qin Sang knelt down and, under the stall owner's watchful eyes, gently picked up the flute. After a brief examination, he confirmed it was identical to his own!</p>
