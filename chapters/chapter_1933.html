<h1>Chapter 1924 Taiyi</h1><p>“You must be the Taiyi Thunder Drill Talisman,”</p><p>Qin Sang guessed.</p><p>The Taiyi Thunder Drill Talisman and the Taiyi Thunder Gang Talisman are both orthodox inheritances of the Daoist Court's Thunder Department.  The former is a second-order talisman, the latter a third-order; the two are closely related.</p><p>The aura emanating from Taiyi didn't exceed that of a late Yuan Ying cultivator.  In terms of cultivation alone, it matched a second-order Taiyi Thunder Drill Talisman.  But this was Qin Sang's first encounter with a sentient talisman; he'd never witnessed such a thing before.  Only by using some method to inspect Taiyi's true form could he be completely certain.</p><p>“You!”</p><p>Taiyi's expression changed dramatically. The lightning about to erupt between his palms abruptly subsided.</p><p>“Who are you? How do you know about the Taiyi Thunder Drill Talisman and the Taiyi Thunder Gang Talisman!”</p><p>His gaze was filled with shock as he looked at Qin Sang.</p><p>At this moment, Taiyi noticed the surprised expression on Su Xuanzhu's face, realizing his own shock had caused him to overlook something crucial.  The person before him not only named the two talismans but also identified him instantly.</p><p>A deep wariness flashed in his eyes, but he knew any action now would be futile.  The other party had infiltrated his dojo, approaching within less than three meters behind him without his notice.  Had Su Xuanzhu not alerted him, he probably wouldn't have discovered the other party until an attack was launched.</p><p>This meant there was a vast difference in their strength, rendering any action on his part meaningless.</p><p>Taiyi steadied himself and said to Su Xuanzhu, “Daoist Su, this Daoist and I have matters to discuss. Please excuse yourself to my cave for a moment.”</p><p>“This…”</p><p>Su Xuanzhu hesitated. He wasn't sure if Taiyi genuinely had a secret he wanted him to avoid, or if he didn't want him involved.  But then he thought, if this Qingfeng Daoist harbored ill intentions, even if he stayed to join forces with Taiyi, he likely wouldn't gain any advantage.</p><p>“In that case, Su will not disturb the two Daoists.”</p><p>Su Xuanzhu glanced at Qin Sang, seeing no objection, bowed, and before descending the mountain, couldn't help but say, “Cultivation is not easy, and now with rampant demons and suffering creatures, we need Daoist Taiyi to suppress them.  Both of you are accomplished cultivators; I hope you will cherish yourselves and the people…”</p><p>Unsure of the reasons behind their conflict, he could only offer indirect advice.</p><p>As he flew on his crane towards Taiyi's cave, Su Xuanzhu looked back at the mountaintop.</p><p>“Daoist Taiyi is actually a sentient talisman…”</p><p>Among common beliefs, beasts achieving enlightenment are considered demons, plants becoming sentient are considered spirits, and mountains transforming are considered monsters; there's no clear boundary for what constitutes a demon beyond human.</p><p>The most common demons are undoubtedly birds, beasts, fish, and insects.</p><p>A sentient talisman?  Even Qin Sang, let alone Su Xuanzhu, had never seen such a thing, both marveling at the wonders of the world.</p><p>“I’ve heard that when spiritual treasures are refined to their peak, they will nurture a spirit, but Daoist Taiyi's situation doesn't seem like…”</p><p>Su Xuanzhu found it incredible, but judging from Taiyi's demeanor, it was almost certainly the case.</p><p>After Su Xuanzhu left, Taiyi's thoughts raced. He said solemnly, “Indeed, I am a Taiyi Thunder Drill Talisman, who, by chance, became sentient.  Daoist, you identified my true nature and know of these two talismans. You must have inherited from a certain Thunder Altar, correct?”</p><p>“It seems your origin is from a certain altar. Do you know the origin of these altars?” Qin Sang countered.</p><p>“Daoist, you needn't probe.  Given our connection through the Thunder Altar, I have no qualms sharing all I know…”</p><p>Taiyi gradually regained his composure and indeed revealed everything he knew.</p><p>“To my knowledge, these altars are a type of Thunder Altar from the Daoist Court's Thunder Department; I may have been a talisman refined by an ancient expert who built the altars… that is all I know. If you ask me what the Daoist Court is, I cannot answer.  Times change. Nothing lasts forever. Even the most powerful immortal sects eventually perish. The Daoist Court was perhaps a great power in ancient times, long since vanished into the river of time.”</p><p>Taiyi spread his hands.</p><p>Before he finished speaking, Taiyi's expression froze, his eyes fixed on Qin Sang's left hand.</p><p>Qin Sang raised his left hand, and a seal appeared in his palm – the Five Thunder Envoy's Seal!</p><p>Of course, the real seal wasn't there; this was a projection created by Qin Sang. But the projected seal's aura perfectly matched the original, making it difficult for others to discern its authenticity.</p><p>“This… Could this be… the Five Thunder Envoy's Seal!” Taiyi was utterly shocked, his voice trembling.</p><p>Qin Sang held up the seal, “You don't understand the Daoist Court, yet you know the Five Thunder Envoy's Seal.”</p><p>"I have cultivated my abilities and obtained some fragmented texts, which record this seal as belonging to the Thunder Department of the Daoist Court, the seal of the Five Thunder Department Commander! You…"</p><p>Taiyi suddenly realized that the seal was in Qin Sang's possession and perfectly resonated with their aura, indicating Qin Sang's complete mastery of it.</p><p>As far as he knew, to fully and skillfully manipulate such a precious seal, one must receive the Daoist Court's recognition.</p><p>In a sense, such seals were official Daoist Court seals; seeing the seal was like seeing the person!</p><p>Taiyi's eyes widened in disbelief.</p><p>The next moment, Taiyi thought of something, hastily withdrew the thunder light from his palms, and deeply bowed to Qin Sang with a solemn expression.</p><p>"Greetings, Commander!"</p><p>His demeanor was unusually respectful, his tone filled with uncontainable excitement.</p><p>"It seems the position bestowed upon me by the Daoist Court is not entirely empty…"</p><p>Qin Sang thought this, retracted the seal with a sweep of their hand, and looked at Taiyi, who remained bowed, "Rise. You are not a Daoist Court official; such formality is unnecessary."</p><p>Taiyi straightened up, repeatedly saying he dared not: "The one who created my original being might have been the master of the Thunder Altar, or their descendant.  The master of the Thunder Altar originated from the Penglai Water Department; even they would bow before the Commander, how dare I be disrespectful!"</p><p>At this moment, Taiyi's heart surged with emotion.</p><p>In the Daoist Court's Thunder Department, the Five Thunder Department was as renowned as the Penglai Water Department.  The head of a department was at least a Unity Stage expert!</p><p>It was said that even Yun Du Mountain's overlord, Yun Du Tian, didn't have a Unity Stage expert in their sect.</p><p>It was all worth the long wait!</p><p>Taiyi almost wept with joy.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't expose him, walking to the edge of the mountaintop, surveying the surrounding mountains, and said calmly, "Tell me about your experiences over the years."</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>Taiyi stood respectfully behind Qin Sang, recounting his story.</p><p>"Commander, please see, the Thunder Altar is within this mountain; it's now dilapidated, only remnants of the altar base remain."</p><p>He pointed towards the mountain where the cave dwelling was located.</p><p>"I am a Taiyi Thunder Drill Talisman, of unknown origin and unknown reason for being left in the ruins. I was originally without sentience, a mere inanimate object.</p><p>"Originally, the terrain here wasn't so rugged; it was relatively flat, with many commoners living here.</p><p>"I don't know when, but a mountain god temple was built in the mountain, above the Thunder Altar ruins. There was once a mountain god, and the temple enjoyed flourishing incense offerings.</p><p>"Perhaps because of this, I was imbued with 'humanity,' nurtured and slowly gained sentience.</p><p>"Perhaps the mountain god didn't discover me, or perhaps they sensed the talisman's change and pitied my difficult birth, keeping me there.</p><p>"Unfortunately, I never had a chance to thank them personally.</p><p>"By the time I truly developed sentience, time had changed everything; the mountain god temple had become ruins."</p><p>Its birth was an extremely long process.</p><p>Taiyi spoke slowly, his words encapsulating the passage of time.</p><p>Part of what he said was a faint remaining sensation, and part was based on various traces; before gaining sentience, he had no accurate memories.</p><p>"After awakening, I spent day after day pondering my origins, carefully exploring the world. I tried to befriend people; at that time, unaware of the wickedness of human hearts, I was simple-minded, easily revealing my identity, which attracted covetousness and pursuit. Later, I began searching for these Thunder Altars, collecting relevant texts, learning about the Daoist Court, the Thunder Department, and Daoist Thunder techniques…"</p><p>His memories after awakening were much clearer.</p><p>"Lei Xiao Sect, you've been there, haven't you?" Qin Sang asked.</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>Taiyi nodded, regretfully saying, "The Lei Xiao Sect obtained some inheritances and developed into a renowned sect; unfortunately, when I found them, the Lei Xiao Sect had already crumbled."</p><p>"There shouldn't be many more like the Lei Xiao Sect, right?"</p><p>If there were several more renowned sects like the Lei Xiao Sect, the Thunder Department's legacy wouldn't have made little impact on Yun Du Mountain.</p><p>Qin Sang asked the question that concerned them most, "Over the years, how many Thunder Altars have you found, and what were your findings?"</p><p>Taiyi nodded, bitterly smiling, "The Thunder Altars I found were all incomplete; most, like this one, only had the altar base remaining. The remaining inheritances and texts were few, scattered and chaotic. I did my best to piece together these things. I've organized the texts and stored them in the cave dwelling; Commander, please come with me…"</p><p>Saying this, Taiyi flew towards the cave dwelling, followed by Qin Sang.</p><p>Xiao Wu and the others were still waiting outside, and having received a message, they were rushing here.</p><p>Taiyi's cave dwelling was also a cave, but it was cleverly arranged.</p><p>Master Su was sitting in meditation; seeing the two descend one after the other, he quickly stood up, observing them.</p><p>Seeing Taiyi's respectful behavior towards Qingfeng Daoist, without any pretense, completely genuine, he was secretly astonished.</p><p>He understood his old friend's temperament; relying only on strength wouldn't make him submit.</p><p>Elder Taiyi said, "I have urgent business today and cannot entertain you, my friend. I will personally apologize at your residence another day."  This was his way of dismissing the visitor.  He and Master Su were close friends, so there was no need for beating around the bush.</p><p>Master Su replied without hesitation, "It seems you two have reached an understanding.  I'm relieved. Until we meet again,"  He summoned a crane, bowed slightly, and flew north.</p><p>Qin Sang followed Taiyi into the innermost chamber, which was furnished like a mortal scholar's study, complete with writing brushes, ink, paper, and inkstones.  One bookshelf held dozens of neatly arranged books. Behind them were wooden tablets, bamboo scrolls, and jade slips, many damaged.</p><p>Taiyi explained, "These are the original texts. These books contain the content I've organized and verified. Whenever I have free time, I pore over them, trying to find useful clues…" He gestured, then stepped back.</p><p>Qin Sang picked up a book and looked through it.  "You aspire to the Daoist Court, yet you haven't considered leaving Yun Du Mountain?"  Taiyi's every move showed his longing for the Daoist Court; the books' contents reflected this as well.</p><p>Qin Sang used his spiritual sense to quickly scan the books, then examined the original texts.</p><p>Taiyi sighed, "There are precedents. I have the ambition, but I dare not. If my true identity is discovered, my fate will not be pleasant. I had planned to wait until my strength increased further before cautiously exploring…"</p><p>Yun Du Mountain and Mu Luo Mountain both teem with experts, including many powerful cultivators; it's possible someone would recognize his identity.  A sentient talisman is rare and highly coveted.  Taiyi could only proceed cautiously, concealing himself among the common folk.</p><p>As Taiyi had said, the information on thunder techniques and traditions here was rudimentary, with little detail on post-Metamorphosis cultivation. However, some content piqued Qin Sang's interest. Taiyi had also been studying these altars and recorded his findings and thoughts.</p><p>"I also want to repair those thunder altars, but my skills are inadequate, and I haven't been able to do so," Taiyi said apologetically.</p><p>Qin Sang examined everything carefully, then frowned. "You haven't found the main altar?"  Daoist altars always have a main altar and subsidiary altars.  The main altar is the core!  Finding it would solve everything.</p><p>Taiyi hesitated. "I'm not sure which is the main altar. Perhaps, like most of the thunder altars, it's been completely destroyed."  If the altar's creator was slain by a powerful enemy, the main altar would undoubtedly have been the primary target—a reasonable assumption by Taiyi.</p><p>Regardless, the location of the main altar must be determined.  Qin Sang had Taiyi lead him to the altar base, sighing as they arrived. The main structure of the altar was gone, only a few stones embedded in the ground remained.</p><p>It was impossible to reconstruct the entire altar from just these stones. Although Qin Sang had repaired subsidiary altars, they weren't identical, possessing subtle, yet crucial, differences.  Visiting other subsidiary altars with Taiyi could wait.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered, looking at Taiyi. Taiyi felt uneasy under Qin Sang's gaze.</p><p>"You wish to improve yourself. Have you considered how to break through your limitations?" Qin Sang asked abruptly.</p><p>Taiyi was overjoyed, immediately replying respectfully, "I beg for your guidance, Master!"</p><p>"This is my first time seeing a talisman spirit like you.  I wonder how your cultivation techniques relate to your true form? If your true form were upgraded to a third-order Taiyi Thunder Bolt Talisman, would it be like a cultivator's rebirth?"</p><p>The two talismans share a lineage and interconnected apertures.  Theoretically, the Taiyi Thunder Drill Talisman could be redrawn to become a more powerful Taiyi Thunder Bolt Talisman.</p><p>However, this is not easy, especially when modifying a sentient talisman. But if Qin Sang could achieve this, Taiyi's understanding of thunder and talismans would greatly improve.</p><p>Unexpectedly, before Qin Sang finished speaking, Taiyi's body shone with thunder, transforming into a silvery talisman.</p><p>The talisman was less than a foot long and three inches wide, radiating thunder, with intricate thunder patterns forming a lifelike thunder drill—sharp and ready to burst forth.</p><p>"Thank you, Master, for your help!"</p><p>The talisman, carrying Taiyi's ecstatic voice, floated towards Qin Sang.</p><p>"Wait!"</p><p>Qin Sang chuckled helplessly, pointing out, returning Taiyi to human form.  Even with Taiyi's willingness, carelessness could lead to his annihilation.</p><p>(To be continued)</p>
