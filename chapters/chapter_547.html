<h1>Chapter 540: Breaking the Talisman</h1><p>Chapter 540: Breaking the Talisman</p><p>The space within the iron finger ring was larger than a mustard seed pouch.</p><p>Qin Sang stored all his belongings inside, filling only a small portion.</p><p>On a whim, he opened the corpse puppet bag, summoned the remaining corpse puppet, and unexpectedly found that he could successfully store it within the iron finger ring.</p><p>Could he do the same with a living corpse?</p><p>Lacking a living corpse for testing, Qin Sang remembered the blood-winged skull bees, and grabbed the spirit beast bag nearby.</p><p>"Buzz buzz buzz…"</p><p>A bloody shadow flew out of the spirit beast bag. Upon closer inspection, it was a blood-winged skull bee, about the size of a fist.</p><p>These blood-winged skull bees were still in their first larval stage, showing no signs of metamorphosis.</p><p>Furthermore, their growth rate was extremely slow. The blood-winged skull bees Qin Sang currently possessed were about the same size and strength as those he had encountered in Wuya Valley.</p><p>However, this seemed to be their limit. Qin Sang had tried using the methods he used to cultivate the skull bees to enhance their strength, but to no avail.</p><p>He had risked returning to where the blood-winged skull bees lived to find the reason for their unusual growth, only to discover that their nest had been destroyed and was now occupied by countless ghost beasts; the blood-winged skull bees were long gone.</p><p>Qin Sang remained clueless about how to cultivate them, and could only feed them blood to keep them alive.</p><p>Although the blood-winged skull bees were aggressive and unyielding, refusing to acknowledge a master, Qin Sang's prolonged feeding had some effect.</p><p>At least, when they sensed Qin Sang's presence, they wouldn't immediately go berserk and attack.</p><p>But that was all.  He still couldn't control them in battle. If the skull bees weren't rare insects, Qin Sang would have discarded them long ago.</p><p>A single blood-winged skull bee hovered before Qin Sang.</p><p>He had originally collected a beehive, which eventually hatched over two hundred bees. Although the individual combat power of these blood-winged skull bees wasn't high, releasing all the bees from the spirit beast bag simultaneously could easily overwhelm an unprepared Foundation Establishment stage cultivator.</p><p>Qin Sang channeled his true energy, restrained the blood-winged skull bee, and sent it into the iron finger ring.</p><p>After waiting for a while and summoning it again, the blood-winged skull bee was dead.</p><p>"It seems I can't discard the corpse puppet bag and the spirit beast bag after all."</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head, cleaned up the blood-winged skull bee's corpse and the debris in the cave, unconsciously rotating the iron finger ring on his right thumb, lost in thought.</p><p>After a while, Qin Sang collected his thoughts and resumed his meditative posture.</p><p>This time, he focused his mind inward, 'observing' the Corpse Pill, then his consciousness returned to his primordial spirit space, and he resolutely broke the Heavenly Corpse Talisman!</p><p>'Crack!'</p><p>A brilliant golden light erupted, and the Heavenly Corpse Talisman shattered.</p><p>At that moment, Qin Sang's heart leaped into his throat. He anxiously watched the changes in his dantian.</p><p>The instant the Heavenly Corpse Talisman shattered, the corpse refinement restrictions on his body, like uprooted weeds, crumbled. The five elemental Yin objects that stabilized his dantian also began to show signs of instability.</p><p>Qin Sang was surprised.  The first things to change were those.</p><p>The five elemental foundation was established before the Heavenly Corpse Talisman sealed his soul. He hadn't expected that breaking the talisman would trigger a chain reaction, and at such an alarming speed.</p><p>The unstable five elemental Yin objects were no longer useful in his dantian, and might even cause harm. Qin Sang didn't hesitate, quickly expelling them and continuing to observe the changes in the Corpse Pill.</p><p>In just a single breath, almost all the corpse refinement restrictions on Qin Sang's body dissipated.  Qin Sang clenched his fists, intently 'staring' at the Corpse Pill.</p><p>The worst hadn't happened.</p><p>Qin Sang could feel that although the Heavenly Corpse Talisman had shattered and the corpse refinement restrictions had dissipated, his closeness to the Corpse Pill hadn't disappeared. His prediction had come true!</p><p>However, it was far from time to celebrate.</p><p>The last restriction shattered!</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>His true energy in his dantian suddenly surged.</p><p>The Corpse Pill suddenly lit up, then began to violently tremble, causing the true energy in his dantian to boil violently, like water brought to a boil.</p><p>A sharp pain shot through his dantian.</p><p>Qin Sang's face changed drastically.</p><p>At this moment, although he and the Corpse Pill weren't strangers, when he tried to use his true energy to stabilize the Corpse Pill, he found a new kind of resistance.</p><p>It was like a child trying to wield a large sword – he couldn't manage it.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression was uncertain. He couldn't tell if this outcome was good or bad.</p><p>Unable to use his true energy, he couldn't stabilize the Corpse Pill.</p><p>However, the Corpse Pill hadn't shattered, nor had there been any backlash, which at least meant there was still a chance of salvage.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression was grave.  After a moment's reflection, he resolutely poured his spiritual sense into his dantian, desperately trying to contact the Corpse Pill. He discovered his spiritual sense was too weak; without the aid of true energy, he couldn't soothe the Corpse Pill.</p><p>Undeterred, Qin Sang immediately used his spiritual sense to activate the ebony sword, bringing it into his dantian to leverage the artifact's aura.  This had limited effect.</p><p>When Qin Sang attempted to utilize the power of the restrictions in the *Heavenly Yin Corpse Manual*, modifying the restrictions designed for refining the Corpse Pill and integrating it with the human pill, he finally achieved some results.  He channeled modified restrictions towards the Corpse Pill based on his understanding of restrictions.</p><p>However, he still couldn't subdue the Corpse Pill. Continuing like this, the Corpse Pill would inevitably break free from his control.</p><p>During this process, however, the connection between Qin Sang and the Corpse Pill became clearer, and a dawning realization took hold.  The problem might not be the Corpse Pill trying to escape.</p><p>Instead, it was likely his own weakness.  He was only using spiritual sense, and without the Heavenly Corpse Talisman and the *Heavenly Yin Corpse Manual*, controlling the Corpse Pill was impossible, hence the instability and stagnation of his true energy.</p><p>Their connection remained unbroken; Qin Sang was certain the Corpse Pill wasn't rejecting him.  If he could stabilize it, he could regain control!</p><p>This didn't mean he needed to be stronger than the Corpse Pill to suppress it. He only needed to use leverage—the Corpse Pill's affinity for him and the restrictions from the *Heavenly Yin Corpse Manual*—to keep it under control. Otherwise, a Corpse Pill weaker than him would be useless.</p><p>Then, a thought struck him: spiritual energy!</p><p>After the Heavenly Corpse Talisman was unsealed, Qin Sang was reborn, the *Chapter on Cultivating the Sword with the Yuan Spirit* returning to him. He could use spiritual energy to stabilize the Corpse Pill.</p><p>But his cultivation was only at the False Core stage, still insufficient to control the Corpse Pill, a pill capable of rivaling genuine Core Formation cultivators!</p><p>Qin Sang's mind raced, searching for other solutions. He finally conceived of one: allowing the Corpse Pill to dissipate some of its power.</p><p>He estimated that if he reduced the Corpse Pill's power to the level of a Flying Night Rakshasa, he could subdue it and use it as an external pill.  This was a significant loss, however; he could no longer recklessly antagonize Core Formation cultivators.</p>
