<h1>Chapter 1323: Overseas Concerns</h1><p>Xu Ling Sect.</p><p>Qin Sang left the Scripture Pavilion as dusk fell.  </p><p>Two months had passed unnoticed, she realized, after checking the time.</p><p>Qin Sang gazed at the setting sun, still immersed in the scriptures, her interest unsatisfied.</p><p>The Scripture Pavilion's keeper, a Golden Core cultivator, was elderly and past the age of forming a Nascent Soul, enjoying his retirement within the sect.  Significantly older than Qin Sang, he stood respectfully, awaiting her instructions.</p><p>"I've caused you much trouble these years," Qin Sang turned and thanked the old man.</p><p>The old man repeatedly demurred, "Senior Qin is too kind.  I am only following the Sect Master's orders; it is my duty."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded. "I intended to thank Daoist Bing Han personally. Is she free?"</p><p>"Reporting to Senior, the Sect Master is currently in seclusion," the old man replied.</p><p>Qin Sang soared towards Bing Han's cave dwelling, moving freely within the Xu Ling Sect after years of residence.</p><p>Along the way, disciples of the Xu Ling Sect, accustomed to this foreign Nascent Soul ancestor, showed no fear, pausing to pay their respects.</p><p>As Qin Sang arrived, the cave dwelling's protective formation flickered, and Bing Han emerged to greet her.</p><p>"Daoist Qin has already mastered all the scriptures?"</p><p>Bing Han invited Qin Sang inside, guessing her purpose.</p><p>"I wouldn't dare claim mastery. I've memorized them, but the deeper meanings remain elusive. I need to put them into practice to fully understand. I will likely need to frequently consult you in the future, disturbing you often."</p><p>Qin Sang was, in fact, taking her leave.</p><p>The Northern Star Realm was at peace; no major incidents had occurred.</p><p>Knowing her foundation was weak, she treated herself as a beginner, diligently filling in gaps. She spent ten years studying the sect's collection while experimenting, finally completing her review. Of course, true mastery required further cultivation.</p><p>Bing Han smiled. "Daoist Qin's visits are most welcome. The disciples say the sect has felt unprecedented peace under your protection. We are only worried about your exceptional talent and rapid progress – soon, I might have nothing left to teach you.”</p><p>After their pleasantries, Bing Han asked, "Daoist Qin, are you leaving for the Ancient Immortal Battlefield?"</p><p>Qin Sang nodded. "Indeed. I recently received a message from Daoist Zhen Yi. The spiritual tide in the Ancient Immortal Battlefield is intensifying, and it is time to investigate the Zi Wei Palace's formation again. This time, we should be able to determine its opening date. Also, it's almost my turn to oversee the Seven Waters Mystical Formation.”</p><p>"If you can pinpoint the time, it means the Zi Wei Palace's opening is imminent, aligning with earlier predictions; it should be within a hundred years…"</p><p>Bing Han’s eyes flickered with worry. "Elder Ye escaped to the Sinful God Palace and hasn't emerged for ten years. Who knows what schemes he's brewing?  This investigation of the Zi Wei Palace is fraught with uncertainty!"</p><p>"We'll meet whatever challenges arise,"</p><p>Qin Sang showed no fear.</p><p>She had already instructed her familiars, Fatty Chicken and the others, to find a safe haven overseas.</p><p>If even all the forces of the Northern Star Realm combined couldn't defeat Elder Ye, retreat would be their only option.</p><p>Bidding farewell to Bing Han,</p><p>Qin Sang flew north to Xuanlu Pass, meeting with Daoist Zhen Yi and the others before entering the Ancient Immortal Battlefield.</p><p>The spiritual tide was at its peak, but this time, only top experts from various regions were present, unfazed as they flew through the turbulent energies.</p><p>Arriving at the location of the Zi Wei Palace,</p><p>Daoist Zhen Yi produced a set of formation artifacts, and they worked together to detect the fluctuations of the Zi Wei Palace’s formation.</p><p>After a day and night of work, they finally found something.</p><p>"Let's go!"</p><p>Daoist Zhen Yi put away the artifacts and flew off. "Unless something unexpected happens, the Zi Wei Palace will open in ten years."</p><p>"According to this timeline, this interval was nearly seventy years, half the previous one. Will the next one be only thirty years or less?”</p><p>The Infernal Venerable Tong You remarked.</p><p>Daoist Zhen Yi's face brightened. "It's possible!  Perhaps the Zi Wei Palace will eventually open completely, accessible at any time, revealing all its secrets. The cultivation world will finally have its golden age!"</p><p>Grandmaster Cang Hong was guarding the celestial gate in the Abyssal Ruins; this time, Immortaless Qiu Zhi had come.</p><p>Calm and composed, she said, "The emergence of the Zi Wei Palace is a double-edged sword. If cultivators outside the Northern Star Realm learn of it, they won't stand idly by."</p><p>At her words, the joy on their faces lessened; they all felt the pressure.</p><p>"Mid-Nascent Soul cultivators would find even crossing the Storm Belt risky, so we shouldn't worry about large-scale invasions.  However, the Immortaless has a valid point. It would be hard for the Northern Star Realm to resist cultivators from the other three realms. We must be prepared and keep the news as secret as possible."</p><p>A cultivator surnamed Lu said gravely.</p><p>The Winged King shook his head.  "There are no secrets that remain hidden forever.  The news can't be kept under wraps indefinitely!  As far as I know, there are several hidden realms within the Purple Micro Palace. We lacked the time and power to break the ancient seals before. Now that past grievances are forgotten, and we can share information freely and work together to break the seals!  In the first few years, our gains will be unimaginable. We mustn't give outsiders a chance to interfere."</p><p>Qin Sang and the others understood the Winged King's concerns, fearing the exclusion of the demon clan by humans.</p><p>The opening of the Purple Micro Palace brought immense benefits; humans couldn't possibly keep it all.  Moreover, powerful figures from outside the region were watching covetously.</p><p>Those present were not fools. They knew that infighting at this time would only benefit outsiders, and they unanimously voiced their support to reassure the demon clan.</p><p>Of course, this was contingent on first dealing with the trouble caused by Old Master Ye.</p><p>Returning from the Ancient Immortal Battlefield,</p><p>Qin Sang hurried to Peach Blossom Valley, learning that his senior sister was in seclusion. He then went to the Deep Earth Cave, confirming Bai's safety, before flying towards Wan Ye Mountain.</p><p>All the disciples of the Green Sheep Sect were on Wan Ye Mountain.</p><p>Before the Green Sheep Sect was officially established, Li Yu Fu had used it as a temporary base, meticulously rebuilding it. Now, Wan Ye Mountain had regained its former prosperity.</p><p>The Green Sheep Sect, and its disciples, had undergone massive changes in the past ten years.</p><p>Tan Yi En failed several attempts at forming his golden core, eventually succeeding by taking a demon-killing pill.  He was adept at managing people, employing both kindness and authority, handling sect affairs efficiently, and demonstrating excellent organizational skills. He had become the de facto head administrator of the Green Sheep Sect, earning the praise and full support of Li Yu Fu and Mei Gu.</p><p>Bai Han Qiu made a similar choice.</p><p>She struggled to establish her foundation, then realizing that her talent was insufficient for great achievements. She happened to meet a male cultivator she admired, forming a Daoist couple with him, supporting Tan Yi En, and living a blissful life.</p><p>Li Yu Fu, Mei Gu, Shangguan Li Feng, and several newly accepted Golden Core disciples also had their own fortunate encounters.</p><p>The demons from the Thousand Mountain Bamboo Sea cultivated the *Celestial Demon Transformation*, progressing rapidly under Jing Yu's guidance.</p><p>Qin Sang landed on the summit of Wan Ye Mountain, entering a cave dwelling, and sent a beam of light out to summon Tan Yi En.</p>
