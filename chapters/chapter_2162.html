<h1>Chapter 2152: The Venerable Envoy</h1><p>Streaks of light flew out, revealing figures one after another. These people came from different tribes, their appearances incredibly diverse and bizarre.</p><p>Li Yufu and Yu Nu watched in awe. Among the strange races they had seen, the most peculiar were the Jiaojiao tribe's Ji Hong. Although small in stature, with features and limbs resembling humans, there were many here far stranger.</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze swept across the archipelago, locking onto a distant island.  From there, the most people flew out, many with wings, their auras the most formidable, displayed without restraint.</p><p>Under the influence of these auras, dark clouds gathered in the sky, and the celestial phenomena shifted dramatically.</p><p>When their auras erupted, the surrounding tribes immediately weakened, none daring to contend with them. From within those auras, Qin Sang faintly sensed obscure presences, seemingly no less powerful than the Yuanxiang Clan Leader, and there was more than one!</p><p>“The Yu Clan's experts have arrived!”</p><p>The Yuanxiang Clan Leader said in a deep voice, turning to look at Qin Sang and the others. “Next, the grand formation will be re-established and the Sea Market restored. You are free to choose any spirit island to settle on.”</p><p>With that, he nodded to Wei Yin and Yuan Jian, leading the three clans’ experts toward the dark clouds.</p><p>Qin Sang and Su Nu exchanged glances, finding a small island nearby. They set up a Go board and began to play, awaiting the spectacle to come.</p><p>The teleporting hall flickered repeatedly, as more and more experts from the strange races arrived. In a short time, two to three hundred Celestial Tribe experts gathered around the Yu Clan, and more continued to arrive.  Under normal circumstances, it was almost impossible to see so many experts of the Void Refinement stage gathered in one place.</p><p>Qin Sang saw Si Lu and Shao Shi in the crowd. They surrounded a regal figure. This person had hair as dark as ink, bound by a jade crown; eyebrows like distant mountains, eyes like stars. Standing with hands clasped behind his back, his demeanor was calm yet exuded authority.  Even amongst so many experts, it was impossible to ignore his presence.</p><p>“This person must be Emperor Si…”</p><p>This thought flashed through Qin Sang's mind.  Emperor Si, sensing his gaze, turned and looked, a faint smile appearing on his lips as he nodded in greeting.</p><p>Now wasn't a good time to talk. Qin Sang simply nodded in return and looked towards the other side of the archipelago.</p><p>Far in the distance, at the edge of his vision, a power no weaker than the Celestial Tribe gathered there. It should be the Aquatic Tribe experts, clearly separated from this side. The two auras seemed to be locked in a subtle confrontation.</p><p>In addition, there were a few scattered auras that were neither close to the Aquatic Tribe nor particularly respectful of the Celestial Tribe.</p><p>The experts of each tribe gathered together, seemingly discussing something, or perhaps waiting for a certain moment, as they remained inactive.</p><p>The tide of foul energy receded, allowing them to distinguish day and night by the natural light. After waiting for three days and three nights, everyone finally made their move.</p><p>By this time, the foul energy had retreated even further, revealing more and more islands, and the outline of the grand formation had basically emerged.</p><p>“It's beginning…”</p><p>Qin Sang and Su Nu looked up from the Go board and saw everyone scattering with a rumble, flying in an orderly fashion towards various positions within the grand formation.  The Aquatic Tribe experts on the other side did the same.</p><p>Rumbling thunder echoed around them, and the waves on the sea grew fiercer.</p><p>Suddenly, a faint mist appeared in the void, starting from the edges of the archipelago. As the mist churned, more and more islands were enveloped.</p><p>Before long, Qin Sang and Su Nu were surrounded by a white expanse.</p><p>If someone were standing outside the archipelago at this moment, they would see a massive cloud of mist floating above the sea. The mist constantly shifted, stretching and extending, ultimately transforming into a white Azure Dragon. Only its head was visible, its tail unseen, its body stretching for countless miles, the myriad islands all within its belly.</p><p>'Roar!'</p><p>A sudden roar shook heaven and earth.</p><p>The Azure Dragon raised its head, its tail like a long whip. A casual flick caused the wind and clouds to change color, and the sea to surge with monstrous waves, tearing open a bottomless chasm in the surface.</p><p>The River of Calamity seemed to tremble, the foul energy stagnating for a moment before shattering with a boom. The mighty dark tide was actually dispersed by the aftershock.</p><p>The Azure Dragon, seizing the opportunity, rode the clouds and soared straight into the nine heavens.</p><p>Qin Sang raised his head, looking towards the sky.  He noticed a peculiar fluctuation spreading out, all the islands ascending upwards with the clouds, their speed accelerating, as if about to break through some kind of constraint, to tear open this world.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>Thunder cracked in the sky.</p><p>Everyone's hearts trembled as they witnessed a breathtaking scene.</p><p>The Azure Dragon smashed a hole in the sky, seemingly truly intending to escape into the void. A white ring of clouds formed at the opening, then expanded at an astonishing speed.</p><p>Wherever the cloud ring passed, the chaotic forces scattered in the void were smoothed out, and the remaining foul energy was completely purged. The roaring tide of foul energy gradually faded away, becoming almost inaudible.</p><p>Peace, tranquility, brightness, and cleanliness—these scenes, originally unrelated to the River of Calamity, appeared before everyone.</p><p>White clouds drifted leisurely.</p><p>Raindrops began to fall, gently and silently landing on each island, nourishing all things unseen.</p><p>The rain brought vitality.  New sprouts began to emerge from the soil on the islands. Qin Sang looked down at his feet, a touch of green appearing in the cracks of the stones.  Tender shoots emerged from the crevices, twisting and turning upwards, quickly unfurling leaves, growing into branches, and finally blossoming into delicate pink flowers, blooming beside the Go board, swaying in the gentle breeze, emitting bursts of fragrance.</p><p>In a short time, the barren ground beside them was covered with patches of red flowers and green trees, a small stream meandering past their feet.</p><p>Looking at the other islands, they had all transformed. Some had babbling brooks and waterfalls like white ribbons cascading from the heavens; some extended vines, connecting with other islands; some grew a colossal tree that reached towards the sky, still growing, as if supporting the heavens; some remained shrouded in mist, hazy and indistinct…</p><p>A myriad of scenes, each with its own unique characteristics.</p><p>The rain lessened.</p><p>The surroundings instantly became clear and bright, beams of light shining through the gaps in the clouds, dispelling all gloom and chaos.</p><p>The clouds gradually thinned, but didn't dissipate completely. Amidst the swirling mist, a rainbow bridge spanned the islands, stretching towards the horizon, dreamlike and illusory.</p><p>Qin Sang was admiring the beautiful scenery and didn't notice the strange look that flashed across Su Nu's eyes, as if she had sensed something unusual.</p><p>She glanced at Qin Sang surreptitiously, her expression normal as she gently pinched a Go piece, seemingly focused on the game.</p><p>Except for a few special islands, all the islands were now unclaimed, allowing everyone to choose according to their preferences.</p><p>The Yuanjiao Sea Market typically lasted for about half a year.  This was the grandest event of the strange races.  During this period, countless cultivators would come and go, some intending to stay longer, building their own dwellings.</p><p>Qin Sang wanted to wait until the end of the Sea Market, so he decided to build a temporary palace on this island. He wasn't particular about grandeur.  Sweeping his gaze around, he chose a nearby location with auspicious feng shui and drew upon the surrounding spiritual energy.</p><p>'Rumble…'</p><p>Stone pillars and walls rose from the earth, and several simple stone halls were instantly constructed, serving as his cave dwelling.</p><p>Li Yufu and Yu Nu bowed and excused themselves to meditate within the halls. From their departure until now, not much time had passed, but they had experienced repeated shocks. Even with Qin Sang's protection, they still felt mentally exhausted.</p><p>Qin Sang and Su Nu continued their game of Go, calmly observing the changing scenery. As the grand formation gradually stabilized, the transformations continued, becoming more and more like a celestial paradise, lacking only spirit beasts and celestial birds.</p><p>As the game neared its end, Qin Sang held a slight advantage. He looked up at the horizon and saw Yuan Miao flying towards them, calling out, “Fellow Daoist Qin.”</p><p>“Where is Clan Leader Yuanxiang?” Qin Sang asked.</p><p>“The Clan Leader has accepted the Yu Clan King’s invitation to a banquet. Those invited are basically the clan leaders or grand elders of the major tribes, all at least late-stage experts. Even if Fellow Daoist Qin possesses combat power comparable to the late stage, your cultivation is not there yet, and as someone from an outside tribe, you are not qualified to participate,” Yuan Miao said frankly.</p><p>Qin Sang secretly felt it was a pity. Such a trading meeting between top experts would definitely have countless treasures.  Even just observing would be beneficial.</p><p>"This game is Brother Qin's victory."</p><p>Su Nu conceded, placing her piece down. “I shall accompany you.”</p><p>The three immediately set off. Yuan Miao led them towards one of the spirit islands, the one with the towering giant tree.</p><p>The giant tree was surprisingly still growing, albeit slowly. Its top was like a canopy, its layered branches and leaves resembling a pagoda, standing out amongst the other islands, visible from any corner of the archipelago.</p><p>The spirit island where the giant tree grew was one of the largest, located at the very center of the archipelago, with the Celestial Tribe on one side and the Aquatic Tribe on the other.</p><p>Arriving near the giant tree, Qin Sang noticed people coming and going, but an invisible boundary separated the Celestial and Aquatic Tribes, and no one crossed that line.</p><p>“Can we go to the other side?” Qin Sang asked.</p><p>“It’s best to wait until there are more people.  There’s no actual restriction, but it's a psychological barrier. Once there are more people, it will be normal.  However, Fellow Daoist Qin is from an outside tribe, so the Aquatic Tribe shouldn't be too exclusionary,” Yuan Miao said.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, looking up and seeing bright red fruits hanging among the green leaves. The fruits were round like melons, without any fragrance.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang noticed someone shooting a ball of spiritual light at the tree. The giant tree then grew a new fruit. The fruit, when it first appeared, split into three segments, like a gaping maw, swallowing the spiritual light before closing tightly.</p><p>“The trading meeting will start a little later.  Actually, this place is where everyone trades. Some call it the Treasure Tree.  If you have something to sell, you hang it on the tree, and if someone is interested, you can trade here. You can see it if you extend your divine sense.  Each fruit contains a treasure. If you find something you like, you can contact the seller through the giant tree…”</p><p>Yuan Miao explained as he eagerly began to examine the fruits.</p><p>Qin Sang split off a few strands of divine sense, sending them towards several fruits.  Upon contact, he immediately knew what was inside.</p><p>Some contained only a single treasure, while others included the seller's detailed introduction and conditions.</p><p>“Eh? Such a large bundle of Thousand Feather Silk!”</p><p>Qin Sang hadn’t expected to find something so quickly.  Thousand Feather Silk was an essential material for constructing Daoist altars. What he’d obtained from the Five Elements Alliance had already been used, leaving very little.</p><p>This bundle of Thousand Feather Silk was even larger than the one he had received from the Five Elements Alliance. The seller called it Nine-Colored Silk.</p><p>The seller didn't demand a specific treasure in exchange, keeping the conditions quite broad, implying room for negotiation.</p><p>Qin Sang immediately extended his divine sense into the fruit.</p><p>To build the altar, he had nearly emptied his coffers.  Later, after absorbing the Lu family's assets, he had recovered, and now he was quite wealthy.</p><p>As the saying goes, preparedness averts peril. He intended to continue collecting materials for constructing the altar, planning to make substantial purchases during this Yuanjiao Sea Market.</p><p>As soon as his divine sense entered the fruit, Qin Sang sensed the other party’s response, “Which tribe does Fellow Daoist belong to?”</p><p>“This old man has a piece of Blue Ripple Gold and wishes to exchange it for your Nine-Colored Silk,” Qin Sang replied.</p><p>Seeing this, the other party stopped inquiring about Qin Sang's identity. “What’s the size and quality?”</p><p>“Superior quality…”</p><p>Qin Sang conjured an image of a piece of blue gold with his divine sense.</p><p>The other party was silent for a moment, then said, “It's a bit small.  It’s only the first day of the Sea Market.  Wait a bit longer, perhaps you can exchange it for something better.”</p><p>“This old man can increase the price.”</p><p>As if anticipating this, Qin Sang conjured images of various spiritual objects with his divine sense.</p><p>“Wait!”</p><p>The other party suddenly exclaimed. “That Soul Jade Pearl, along with the Blue Ripple Gold, can be exchanged!”</p><p>“Good!”</p><p>Qin Sang immediately agreed.</p><p>He had already selected the useful treasures from the Lu family treasury, leaving the rest for trading.</p><p>“Fellow Daoist, please send the two treasures towards the Treasure Tree fruit. Once I confirm they are correct, I will release the restriction…”</p><p>Qin Sang followed the instructions, retrieving the Soul Jade Pearl and Blue Ripple Gold, wrapping them in true essence, and sending them towards the fruit.</p><p>The fruit seemed to be stimulated.  A new bud sprouted from its stem, growing a new fruit, snug against the previous one, swallowing the two spiritual objects.</p><p>A moment later, the previous fruit swayed, opening its mouth and spitting out the Thousand Feather Silk.</p><p>Qin Sang took the Thousand Feather Silk and noticed that the original fruit quickly withered, leaving only the new fruit on the stem. The new fruit was green, indicating that the transaction was complete, waiting for the seller to come and collect the treasures.</p><p>Treasures hung here weren't afraid of being stolen because experts from the Jiao and Yu Clans were constantly watching, and the Treasure Tree itself was also extraordinary.</p><p>However, this form of trading had its limitations. There was a risk of deception, and transactions involving valuable treasures would definitely require more caution.  Some shady dealings could only be conducted privately.</p><p>Putting away the Thousand Feather Silk, Qin Sang continued his efforts, his divine sense sweeping over the fruits. He quickly exchanged for three more spiritual objects, secretly sighing that this trip had been worthwhile.</p><p>Yuan Miao and Su Nu also had their own gains.</p><p>The appointed time arrived, and Yuan Miao called the two to attend the trading meeting.  Su Nu, however, declined. “I shall not go. I was fortunate enough to obtain a treasure I have sought for many years and must refine it as soon as possible.”</p><p>Qin Sang and Yuan Miao didn't suspect anything.</p><p>Yuan Miao said, “There will be many more trading meetings.  It’s nothing to miss one.”</p><p>The three then parted ways.</p><p>Su Nu returned to the cave dwelling, waited for a while, then quietly left.</p><p>She deliberately disguised herself, flying alone towards the edge of the islands, finally arriving at a secluded small island.</p><p>The island was covered with a type of slender, emerald-green tree.  Its leaves resembled bamboo leaves, rustling softly in the breeze.</p><p>Flashing into the depths of the forest, Su Nu found a wooden cabin, not particularly elaborate, seemingly built casually.</p><p>The door was tightly closed.</p><p>Su Nu landed in front of the door and transmitted her voice, “Which Venerable Envoy has arrived?”</p><p>The cabin remained silent.</p><p>Su Nu frowned, waiting for a moment.  There was still no response from inside.  She spoke again, “Is it the Divine General?”</p>
