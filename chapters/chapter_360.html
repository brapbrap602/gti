<h1>Chapter 353: Reckoning</h1><p>Chapter 353: Reckoning</p><p>At this time, the elderly man also noticed Qin Sang, a fellow Foundation Establishment cultivator, and looked over with vigilance.</p><p>Qin Sang paid no attention to the warning in the elder's gaze, took a step forward, removed his cloak, and said, "Fellow Daoist Han, do you remember me?"</p><p>"Patriarch, be careful!"</p><p>The elder had been on guard against Qin Sang.  Seeing Qin Sang's movement, he immediately leaped to block in front of the Han Patriarch.</p><p>It turned out he had become the head of the Han family.</p><p>Qin Sang stopped, observing this Han Patriarch.</p><p>As they say, one's environment shapes one's character. Compared to the youthful naiveté of their first meeting, the Han Patriarch now exuded the authority of a leader.</p><p>I remember back then, his cultivation was not high, and he almost perished with a demonic cultivator. Now, he is the head of a clan.</p><p>I myself cultivated with the help of the Yan Luo Banner, skipped the Foundation Establishment stage thanks to the Danlong Ginseng, and consumed a thousand-year-old elixir to reach my current level.</p><p>This person’s talent must be extraordinary.</p><p>"General Qin!"</p><p>The Han Patriarch clearly remembered Qin Sang, a look of surprise appearing on his face. He hastily reached out to restrain the elder.</p><p>"Elder Liu, calm yourself! General Qin saved my life!"</p><p>The Han Patriarch stepped past Elder Liu, quickly walking forward with a surprised expression. "General Qin, is it really you? When did you return to Youshan Market? Why have you been out of contact all these years...?"</p><p>Mid-sentence, the Han Patriarch's face froze. He finally noticed something amiss—not only had Qin Sang's appearance changed little, but his cultivation was on par with his own!</p><p>At the same time, he also saw the Shao Hua Mountain token Qin Sang had taken out.</p><p>"Shao Hua Mountain? Qin... Qin Daoist, are you now a disciple of Shao Hua Mountain?" The Han Patriarch's tone was incredibly shocked, but his brows gradually furrowed.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded. "It was fortunate for me to obtain a Shao Hua Mountain sword intent decree.  By chance, I was accepted into Shao Hua Mountain. I'm just passing through Youshan Market, here to reminisce, and unexpectedly I meet Fellow Daoist Han."</p><p>The Han Patriarch's brow was tightly knit. He had a strong suspicion, and murmured, "Daoist Qin, your spiritual roots…"</p><p>Qin Sang's cultivation was clearly displayed—undeniably at the Foundation Establishment stage.</p><p>But he clearly remembered that during the Great Sui Celestial Crane Imperial Seal and the Imperial Enthronement, Zhen Ming had tested Qin Sang's aptitude on his behalf, and reported that he had no spiritual roots!</p><p>Because of this, Qin Sang had devoted himself to the Dao, pleaded repeatedly, and faced many further complications.</p><p>If he truly had no spiritual roots, how could he be accepted into Shao Hua Mountain, let alone have such high cultivation?</p><p>Unless…</p><p>Qin Sang 'hmm'ed, looked into the Han Patriarch's eyes, and said calmly, "I do indeed possess spiritual roots, but my aptitude is unremarkable. Back then… perhaps Daoist Zhen was negligent and failed to detect them."</p><p>"Impossible!"</p><p>The Han Patriarch declared.</p><p>Cultivators, even the simple task of detecting spiritual roots, could be wrong? What a joke!</p><p>The Han Patriarch's face was filled with murderous intent, his eyes flashing with cold light.</p><p>Even with his composure, he could barely suppress the burning rage in his chest.</p><p>One was shame towards Qin Sang, the other was anger at being deceived.</p><p>The Han Patriarch turned to the elder and said, "Elder Liu, you are in charge of the aftermath. If manpower is insufficient, use my authority as Patriarch to call upon the clan elders. I must return to Han Family Fort immediately."</p><p>The elder was completely bewildered but seeing his Patriarch's furious expression, he dared not speak further and obeyed without hesitation.</p><p>"Yes, Patriarch."</p><p>Then, the Han Patriarch took a deep breath, forcibly suppressing his anger, and looked at Qin Sang with deep apology, speaking sincerely, "Daoist Qin, it was my fault back then! I never imagined he would dare to be so bold… If you have the time, would you please come with me to the Han family? I will give you a proper explanation!"</p><p>Qin Sang had been observing the Han Patriarch's expression. Seeing no falsehood, he considered it and agreed.</p><p>Qin Sang was also very curious. He and Zhen Ming had no grievances, why would Zhen Ming harm him?</p><p>However, his feelings for Zhen Ming were complicated.</p><p>Zhen Ming almost ended his immortal path.  He should be extremely angry, but Qin Sang considered his own experiences over the years and had to admit that if it weren't for Zhen Ming, he wouldn't be where he is today.</p><p>Because of Zhen Ming's declaration that he lacked cultivation talent, he was forced to go north to Youshan Market, eventually joining Shao Hua Mountain.</p><p>Though he had experienced countless hardships and several near-death experiences, he had gained his current cultivation and several rare treasures.</p><p>If he had joined the Han family back then, he would only have been an outer disciple. Without the Danlong Ginseng, without the Foundation Establishment Pill, with his aptitude, he would probably still be stuck at the tenth level of Qi Refinement in his sixties or seventies.</p><p>Then he would accept reality, give up on the immortal path, marry, have children, and die in Han Family Fort, a life of mediocrity.</p><p>At most, he would live a few more decades than an ordinary person.</p><p>It would be impossible to have the limitless possibilities he now possessed.</p><p>It's simply fate.</p><p>Several people left You Shan Market.  Master Han gave a few more instructions to his subordinates, summoned a flying vessel, and invited Qin Sang aboard. They sped off towards the southwest.</p><p>Only on the vessel did they have time to catch up.</p><p>"When you rescued me, Daoist Qin, I and that demon were both severely injured. I was near death, my spiritual energy depleted, and all my pills were gone.  Those few Water Dew Pills barely kept me alive long enough to return to my family.  My elders treated me, and it took eight years of seclusion to recover.  The Emperor's coronation ceremony took place during a crucial point in my recovery.  Knowing what I know now, even if it meant risking further injury, I would have personally gone. I would never have entrusted it to that scoundrel, Zhen Ming!"</p><p>Master Han lamented, deeply distressed.</p><p>Qin Sang knew Master Han wasn't exaggerating.  Even back then, despite his inexperience, he could tell how serious the injuries were.  Master Han must have been holding on, fearing that ordinary people would suspect something and cause trouble.</p><p>"Daoist Han, I didn't know Daoist Zhen Ming.  I've always been cautious and haven't offended him. He has no reason to harm me," Qin Sang said pointedly.</p><p>Master Han's face darkened. After a long pause, he slowly shook his head. "To be honest with you, Daoist Qin, while there's competition within Han Manor, our family traditions are sound. Strength speaks for itself; there aren't many underhanded schemes.  Moreover, Zhen Ming and his close relatives could not, and would not, dare oppose my branch of the family. He's always been well-behaved and never acted out of line. That's why I felt safe letting him receive you, never imagining he would dare to act so brazenly and do this behind my back."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded slightly.  It made sense. Zhen Ming targeting him wouldn't have affected the family succession struggle; the cultivation world ultimately respects power.  Since there was no long-standing family feud, it seemed Zhen Ming acted on impulse.</p><p>Qin Sang felt a little frustrated. He had always been careful; how had he offended Zhen Ming?</p>
