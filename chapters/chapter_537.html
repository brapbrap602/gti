<h1>Chapter 530: The Outer Pill</h1><p>Qin Sang stood in the shadows, observing the protective formation.</p><p>He searched for a long time without finding the eye of the array.  The protective formation of the Qingyang Demon Sect, crafted by a Yuan Ying cultivator, was incredibly intricate. Qin Sang felt a dizzying headache and, finding himself utterly lost, gave up.</p><p>He knew, however, that even if he found the array's weak point, he couldn't break through.</p><p>To escape, he had to wait for the Qingyang Demon Sect to open the formation themselves.</p><p>Qin Sang quickly considered his options.</p><p>His presence had been discovered, but the two who had spotted him were trapped by the Ancestral Sacred Fire, unable to send a message.</p><p>But he couldn't stall for too long. Once that Core Formation cultivator returned, rescued them, and learned the truth, the sect would immediately seal the mountain, searching the entire sect with all its might, relentlessly pursuing him until he was captured.</p><p>Trying the same trick again, hiding in the shadows and waiting for an opportunity to escape, was clearly impossible.</p><p>By then, the Qingyang Demon Sect would have him trapped, with nowhere to run.</p><p>Qin Sang was currently weak. Before fully mastering the power of the corpse pill, he couldn't kill those two by charging into the green light.</p><p>Qin Sang even suspected that even if he controlled the corpse pill, provoking the Ancestral Sacred Fire without the Qingyang Demon Fire would likely result in his own demise before he could kill those two.</p><p>He had experienced firsthand the power of the Ancestral Sacred Fire. If those two hadn't cultivated the Qingyang Demon Fire and been protected by that strange green flag, they would have been instantly reduced to ashes.</p><p>The green light, though not the Ancestral Sacred Fire's main body, was a manifestation of its purest power. Once unleashed, it was far more terrifying than the Nine Nether Demon Fire within the Ten Directions Yama Banner!</p><p>What about the Void Heaven Thunder?</p><p>Qin Sang pondered, then silently shook his head, dismissing the idea.</p><p>The traces left by the Void Heaven Thunder's explosion couldn't be easily erased in a short time; he would still be exposed.</p><p>The Void Heaven Thunder was his most reliable tool and couldn't be used lightly.  Wasting it without achieving his goal would only put him in even greater danger.</p><p>After a moment's reflection, Qin Sang decided to remain calm. Since he couldn't leave, he'd find a place to familiarize himself with the corpse pill. Once his strength recovered, doing anything would be easier than idly speculating here.</p><p>He had less than two hours.</p><p>Qin Sang had just discovered that his progress in mastering the corpse pill far surpassed Yu Hua's. With all his effort, there was a good chance he could control its power within that time.</p><p>Then, with strength comparable to a Flying Night Rakshasa, along with the Ebony Sword and Void Heaven Thunder, he might not fear that Core Formation cultivator.</p><p>That cultivator was only in the early Core Formation stage, after all.</p><p>Thinking this, Qin Sang looked around and found a hiding spot not far from the Qingyang Demon Sect's mountain gate, settling down to meditate, focusing intently on sensing the corpse pill within his body.</p><p>As time passed, Qin Sang's control over the corpse pill became increasingly effortless and natural. As his familiarity grew, a gradual understanding dawned on him.</p><p>His previous spiritual energy and the corpse pill's true essence were not of the same level.</p><p>Qin Sang channeled the true essence power. Although it lacked the seamless, intimate feeling of his previous spiritual energy, there was no obstacle in wielding it; it was truly his power to command.</p><p>It wasn't an exaggeration to say that Qin Sang was a changed man.</p><p>However, this change was only at the level of true essence. His spiritual sense and physical body remained unchanged; he hadn't undergone the complete transformation of a true Core Formation cultivator, attracting heaven and earth's energy and causing changes in the wind and clouds.</p><p>This was his fatal flaw. Unless Qin Sang accepted the irreversible corpse transformation, relinquishing control of his true essence and allowing his soul and body to endure the impact.</p><p>The Flying Night Rakshasa's strength lay in its physical body.</p><p>Its unpredictable speed and ability to withstand attacks from cultivators of the same level resulted from the constant refinement by the corpse pill during its transformation.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't want to undergo corpse transformation. His physical body remained largely unchanged, meaning he had given up the Flying Night Rakshasa's greatest strength.</p><p>Logically, Qin Sang's strength was even inferior to the Flying Night Rakshasa's.</p><p>But as time went on, Qin Sang was surprised to discover that even without fully controlling the corpse pill, the true essence power it manifested had already surpassed that of Yu Hua, who possessed a powerful physical body!</p><p>Qin Sang estimated that once the corpse pill was completely under his control, his strength would be almost equal to a true early Core Formation cultivator!</p><p>What he lost in one area, he gained in another.</p><p>This was completely unexpected by Qin Sang.</p><p>Was it because he used an active golden core, or because of the combination of earth煞 qi and 乾天罡 qi that caused this transformation?</p><p>Perhaps both.</p><p>This discovery filled Qin Sang with immense joy and renewed confidence.</p><p>Qin Sang soon discovered that his Corpse Pill differed greatly from Yu Hua's. Its true energy composition was unusual, a fusion of the pill's inherent power, earth-sunder energy, heaven-gan energy, and corpse energy.  Spiritual energy was a negligible component; heaven-gan and earth-sunder energies were paramount.</p><p>While the Corpse Pill could absorb ambient spiritual energy to recover after depletion, the process was extremely slow, practically inconsequential in battle.  Even using spirit stones offered little improvement.  Rapid recovery in combat required simultaneously absorbing heaven-gan and earth-sunder energies.  Obtaining earth-sunder energy was feasible, but Qin Sang lacked a way to carry heaven-gan energy.</p><p>This meant that even with his enhanced strength, he could only sustain a burst of power for a limited time, needing to kill or escape his opponent before his true energy was exhausted.  This felt strikingly similar to legendary external pills.</p><p>Qin Sang frowned.  The cultivation world abounded with legends of external pills, the ultimate aspiration for any cultivator. Yet, true external pill techniques had never truly surfaced.  Still, it was conceivable.  External pill refinement, like internal pill refinement, would surely be no easier, perhaps even harder.  It was said only Nascent Soul cultivators possessed the ability to refine external pills.</p><p>Whether Shao Hua Mountain held any external pill techniques, Qin Sang wasn't sure.  He lacked the standing to access such high-level techniques, though he'd glimpsed references to external pills in a fragmentary, unidentified ancient text at Baota Peak.  These references bore striking similarities to his own Corpse Pill.  He recalled the Sky Yin Corpse Manual's method for creating the Flying Night Rakshasa:  wasn't it essentially implanting an external pill into a refined corpse?</p><p>Deep within the damp ditch, Qin Sang awoke from his meditative state, his eyes opening to a thoughtful expression. He shook his head slowly, deciding to postpone further contemplation. He'd only recently obtained the Corpse Pill, hadn't had time for thorough understanding, and surely overlooked something.  A careful assessment could only be made after ensuring his safety.</p><p>With that thought, Qin Sang rose. He could now largely control the Corpse Pill, faster than anticipated – within just an hour and a half.  The Qingyang Demon Sect's Nascent Soul cultivator hadn't returned.  Qin Sang decided to wait no longer and return to Shen Gang Peak, to cause the Qingyang Demon Sect some trouble.  He couldn't steal the Qingyang Gan Ying, but he could sabotage it.  If the Ancestor Saint Fire became unstable, they'd likely be too preoccupied to bother him.</p>
