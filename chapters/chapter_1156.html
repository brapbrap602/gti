<h1>Chapter 1148: Thunder Butterfly? Tribulation Butterfly?</h1><p>A glint of greed flashed in the eyes of Demon King Qianji as his figure vanished from the spot in an instant. The demon concubine, realizing what had happened, quickly led her subordinates in pursuit. She knew why the demon king was so excited.</p><p>Spirit insects are notoriously difficult to gain sentience, and their innate abilities are often singular, making their strength incomparable to that of shape-shifting demons or Nascent Soul Ancestors. However, they often possess unique and extraordinary uses. Especially those rare and peculiar insects—their innate abilities might even surpass their own rank, achieving effects that transcend their level.</p><p>A fourth-transformation spirit insect is exceedingly rare. Taming one would be akin to obtaining a priceless treasure. Naturally, the demon king would be tempted.</p><p>Near the Abyss of Ten Thousand Snakes, there had been a spirit insect of such a high realm all along, yet they had occupied this place for so long without ever noticing it. But as the demon concubine recalled the thief from before, an ominous premonition crept into her heart.</p><p>...</p><p>Meanwhile, atop the mountain peak.</p><p>Before the heavenly tribulation descended, Qin Sang and Bai had retreated far away to protect the Heavenly Eye Butterfly. Of course, if the Heavenly Eye Butterfly failed to withstand the tribulation, Qin Sang wouldn’t easily give up. He had already prepared for the worst, determined to fight no matter what.</p><p>The *Heavenly Demon Refinement* had already broken through. If the Heavenly Eye Butterfly could successfully advance, it would be an unexpected boon. With these two sources of strength, Qin Sang was filled with confidence in forming his Nascent Soul.</p><p>Bai gazed at the tribulation clouds and, noticing Qin Sang’s tense expression, reassured him, “Don’t worry. I see the tribulation clouds are nearing their limit. The power isn’t as terrifying as you think. Your Heavenly Eye Butterfly has devoured the true blood of the Azure Phoenix. If it can’t even survive this minor tribulation, it would be a disgrace to the name of the Azure Phoenix! You’re just overthinking it. You should focus on consolidating the residual power within your body.”</p><p>“The true blood of the Azure Phoenix?” Qin Sang was momentarily stunned. That Azure Phoenix power was the true blood of the Azure Phoenix? He hadn’t felt any influence on his own essence blood.</p><p>Bai countered, “Although I didn’t see the stone slab, your wings have solidified into a physical form, and the Heavenly Eye Butterfly has undergone such a drastic transformation. What else could it be but the true blood of the Azure Phoenix sealed within the slab?”</p><p>Qin Sang fell into deep thought.</p><p>Bai continued, “The reason you didn’t feel it is because you’re human. The true blood of the Azure Phoenix could only flow into your wings, reshaping them into phoenix wings. The pair of wings on your back can now be called true phoenix wings. The fact that the Heavenly Eye Butterfly could devour the true blood of the Azure Phoenix is beyond my expectations. It’s likely related to that mutation you mentioned. After this second mutation, the Heavenly Eye Butterfly has transcended the category of spirit insects. Its future potential is limitless!”</p><p>Bai’s tone was filled with emotion, envious of Qin Sang’s luck in taming such a spirit insect.</p><p>*Crack!*</p><p>A tribulation bolt descended from the sky, interrupting their conversation.</p><p>Qin Sang instinctively clenched his fists. After his breakthrough, both his physical body and his phoenix wings had become more stable, capable of withstanding the impact of the Azure Phoenix’s power. Now, he forcibly suppressed his own energy, focusing entirely on the Heavenly Eye Butterfly’s tribulation.</p><p>The moment the tribulation bolt appeared, threads of lightning surged across the Heavenly Eye Butterfly’s wings. In an instant, the wings were enveloped in thunder. Countless fine electric arcs intertwined, forming a net of lightning that continued to solidify. Finally, with the Heavenly Eye Butterfly at its core, it condensed into a bolt of lightning that shot back toward the tribulation bolt!</p><p>In terms of scale and momentum, it was no match for the tribulation bolt. One couldn’t help but wonder if it would be obliterated upon contact.</p><p>At that moment, the Heavenly Eye Butterfly suddenly soared high into the sky, fearless, embracing the lightning as it actively charged toward the tribulation bolt!</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The two bolts of lightning collided, creating a deafening roar. Thunder devoured and annihilated each other, turning the world into a sea of silver.</p><p>Suddenly, Qin Sang’s expression changed drastically. The lightning condensed by the Heavenly Eye Butterfly was shattered by the tribulation bolt. Losing its barrier, the tribulation bolt struck directly at the Heavenly Eye Butterfly’s body.</p><p>Qin Sang was horrified. Without hesitation, he rushed toward the Heavenly Eye Butterfly.</p><p>Bai didn’t stop Qin Sang, though his expression was slightly awkward. He had predicted that the Heavenly Eye Butterfly would easily pass the tribulation, but now it seemed he had been proven wrong. The Heavenly Eye Butterfly’s improvement wasn’t as significant as he had imagined.</p><p>“Could it be that it awakened too early, lacking sufficient foundation?” Bai murmured thoughtfully, glancing behind him warily, keeping an eye out for the demon king.</p><p>Unexpectedly, just as Qin Sang moved, another change occurred.</p><p>The tribulation bolt descended in an instant. The Heavenly Eye Butterfly gently fluttered its wings, and the Heavenly Eye on its wings suddenly opened. Two beams of strange light shot out from the Heavenly Eye, alternating between azure and silver, like two sharp swords piercing into the tribulation bolt!</p><p>Qin Sang stopped in his tracks, stunned.</p><p>The tribulation bolt, struck by the strange light, was torn apart and dissipated before it could reach the Heavenly Eye Butterfly.</p><p>Then, an even more shocking scene unfolded.</p><p>The two beams of strange light converged mid-air, forming a net. At this moment, the tribulation bolt hadn’t completely dissipated. The last remnant of lightning was captured by the net of light. Then, along with the tribulation bolt, the net was forcibly drawn into the Heavenly Eye Butterfly’s Heavenly Eye.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>The thunderous power within the Heavenly Eye Butterfly’s body was thrown into chaos. The Heavenly Eye Butterfly conveyed a sense of pain, its body trembling as it forcibly closed its Heavenly Eye. Gradually, it calmed down.</p><p>Qin Sang stood frozen in place.</p><p>Bai’s eyes were wide with shock.</p><p>“Controlling the tribulation lightning?” Bai’s expression twisted, his voice almost distorted.</p><p>Qin Sang was equally stunned by the Heavenly Eye Butterfly’s actions.</p><p>Tribulation lightning was no ordinary heavenly thunder. Qin Sang, who possessed the *Art of Thunder Control*, knew the difference well. He had drawn heavenly thunder during thunderstorms to cultivate this secret technique, but he would never dare to face tribulation lightning in such a manner—unless he had a death wish.</p><p>The Heavenly Eye Butterfly, bold beyond measure, had actually captured the tribulation lightning and devoured it into its body—and it seemed to have succeeded. Even if it was just a trace, it was something unimaginable for ordinary beings.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang couldn’t help but believe Bai’s words. The Heavenly Eye Butterfly had devoured the true blood of the Azure Phoenix, and combined with its originally mysterious Heavenly Eye ability, it had triggered a chain reaction, enabling it to perform such a heaven-defying feat. Otherwise, it would be hard to explain.</p><p>“A phoenix butterfly? A thunder butterfly? Or… a tribulation butterfly?” Qin Sang stared blankly at the Heavenly Eye Butterfly.</p><p>In a single night, he realized he no longer recognized his own life-bound insect. The transformation and mutation weren’t the end. The Heavenly Eye Butterfly had brought him an even greater surprise—devouring tribulation lightning.</p><p>The heavenly tribulation had ended. The Heavenly Eye Butterfly hovered quietly in the void. After devouring the tribulation lightning, it showed no immediate changes, but Qin Sang knew it couldn’t be that simple. If it could devour tribulation lightning at the fourth transformation, what would happen at the fifth transformation, or even the legendary ninth transformation?</p><p>Qin Sang couldn’t imagine it.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>The Heavenly Eye Butterfly’s aura gradually stabilized. Suddenly, it darted toward Qin Sang like a swallow returning to its nest.</p><p>Qin Sang quickly opened his arms, catching it in an embrace. The Heavenly Eye Butterfly clung tightly to him, nuzzling gently against his chest, conveying feelings of closeness, lingering fear, and affection—far clearer and more precise than before, a sign that its intelligence had also improved.</p><p>“Let’s go! The tribulation is over, and Demon King Qianji is catching up!” Bai reminded in a low voice, retreating into the corpse puppet bag.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, allowing the Heavenly Eye Butterfly to return to his dantian to recover its energy. He glanced back, crushed a Qingfu Coin to send a message to the Willow Spirit, instructing it to leave the area. Then, with a tap of his foot, his phoenix wings flapped, and he transformed into a streak of azure light, speeding away.</p><p>After breaking through with the *Heavenly Demon Refinement*, he no longer feared shape-shifting demons as he once did. However, the Azure Phoenix’s power within him wasn’t fully tamed yet, making combat unfavorable.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>The azure light streaked across the sky.</p><p>Qin Sang was overjoyed. After his breakthrough, his speed had indeed increased dramatically. Shaking off Demon King Qianji wouldn’t be difficult.</p>
