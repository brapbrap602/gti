<h1>Chapter 193: People on the Mountain, Things Under the Mountain (Part 3! Seeking subscriptions! Seeking votes!)</h1><p>The sword qi he aroused with his Yanyan Blade was fiery red, compressed by Qin Sang into a length of three meters. At first, it was somewhat illusory, now swallowing then spitting out in an uncertain way. Under Qin Sang's control, it became increasingly solid.</p><p>When the sword qi stabilized, Qin Sang’s eyes flashed; he stared at the Yanyan Blade for a long time before suddenly giving a short shout: “Open!”</p><p>The blade hummed and vibrated violently. The sword qi surged wildly like clouds in the wind.</p><p>A crack appeared in the sword qi, growing wider and wider. The sword qi was stripped off the spiritual blade, transforming into a clump of fiery red qi that burned like a raging fire. Then, at speed visible to the naked eye, it dissipated.</p><p>Qin Sang didn’t dare to be careless. According to the requirements of the [Thousand Mechanisms Sword Formation], he used all his strength to rouse his divine sense and spiritual force, drawing the stripped-off sword qi closer with all his might, preventing it from dissipating.</p><p>When the sword qi was slightly more stable, he separated out a strand of divine sense to lead into the sword qi, trying to condense the sword qi according to the method taught in the sword technique.</p><p>As Qin Sang condensed it, this mass of sword qi fluctuated violently. Sometimes it was compressed, sometimes it was stretched out, gradually moving closer to the shape of a spiritual blade, able to barely hold the shape of a blade.</p><p>But this was far from meeting the requirements of the [Thousand Mechanisms Sword Formation]. If Qin Sang let loose the suppression, the sword qi would disperse immediately. The sword qi had to be condensed to a certain degree, able to exist in the shape of a spiritual blade for a long time, for it to be successful.</p><p>This was also the greatest difficulty of the [Thousand Mechanisms Sword Formation].</p><p>Just as Qin Sang was trying to continue.</p><p>‘Pop!’</p><p>Out of nowhere, the sword qi exploded abruptly. Countless needle-like sword qi shot out in all directions, looking like they were going to riddle the cave with holes.</p><p>Qin Sang’s expression darkened. He immediately dispersed the strand of divine sense in the sword qi, then raised his hand to extinguish the sword qi. Frowning, he pondered for a moment before standing up.</p><p>The cave was too small. If he didn’t manage to control the sword qi well, there was a chance that the explosion would cause the cave to collapse. If he damaged the spiritual vein, it wouldn’t be worth it at all. Thinking of this, Qin Sang put away the Yanyan Blade, tidied away the clutter, sealed off the cave, and flew towards Xianglong Mountain on his flying sword.</p><p>Inside Huilong Temple, everything was as before. Ever since Qin Sang had taken it over, he had sealed it off with clouds and mist, never showing his face to mortals. The ordinary people below the mountain had gradually grown accustomed to it.</p><p>There was a sound transmission talisman inside, sent by Senior Brother Wen. It told him that he hadn’t been able to find withered spiritual spring items yet. Only then did Qin Sang remember that he had forgotten to tell Senior Brother Wen about this previously. He quickly sent a reply, and asked a few other questions.</p><p>Ancient South and his disciple used Huilong Temple as their cave abode, so naturally there wouldn’t be a shortage of spiritual force. Moreover, practicing sword techniques wasn’t too demanding in terms of spiritual force.</p><p>Qin Sang sat down on the ground in the courtyard. This time, he didn’t use the Yanyan Blade, but instead directly summoned the Ebony Blade.</p><p>After having been nurtured for a whole month, the Ebony Blade had already smelted the Golden Silk Cypress Wood, and the embryo of the blade had some extra purity and green in comparison to before. As for whether it could withstand a second killing talisman, Qin Sang didn’t know yet. The only thing he could do was gather as much spiritual wood as possible to increase the Ebony Blade’s resilience so that the Ebony Blade wouldn’t become the shortcoming that limited his cultivation.</p><p>The Ebony Blade was his lifebound spiritual blade, more manageable than the Yanyan Blade. Qin Sang easily repeated the steps from before, summarizing the experience from his failure just now.</p><p>…</p><p>The scorching summer had finally passed and it was time for the harvest. When the villagers below Xianglong Mountain worked, they would always remember to look up at the mysterious mountain top, talking non-stop when they brought it up, their faces flushed with excitement.</p><p>The mountain was covered in smoke and mist that didn’t disperse all year round; inside it was a temple where it was said that there were celestial beings.</p><p>In just a few short years, countless people who sought immortals had come here for the name.</p><p>Some people built huts outside the clouds and mist, kneeling and kowtowing every day, though they had never received a reply. However, they never gave up, believing that their heart to cultivate the Way was simply not sincere enough, and that the Celestial Masters were testing them.</p><p>Some people barged into the clouds and mist at the risk of their lives. They would remain for several days, their minds muddled. Upon awakening, they would find themselves at the bottom of the mountain again, famished.</p><p>Among them were high officials, wealthy gentlemen, and martial arts experts.</p><p>More and more people who sought immortals gathered here, causing the price of the houses in the village to rise. Gradually, it developed into a small town, becoming more and more prosperous.</p><p>The villagers were delighted. Many people who saw the opportunity began to start other businesses, able to live well without relying on farming. They were grateful to the immortals on the mountain, and worshipped them with even more sincerity than they did the Buddhas.</p><p>Little did they know that there were no immortals in the temple on the mountain, only a lone cultivator who arduously pursued the path of immortality.</p><p>Qin Sang sat alone in the courtyard. He had not moved for two months, his back appearing incredibly lonely. He had no idea about the matters at the bottom of the mountain. He was covered in fallen leaves and dust, his mind completely in the spiritual blade.</p><p>Swoosh!</p><p>A blood-red light flashed through the air, turned and halted abruptly, hovering side by side with the Ebony Sword. This turned out to be a crimson longsword, that on closer inspection, had a somewhat spectral feel to it, as if composed of Sword Qi.</p><p>Qin Sang opened his eyes, staring excitedly at the crimson longsword. Three whole months of arduous cultivation had finally allowed him to master this sword technique!</p><p>However, the power of a single Sword Qi was extremely weak, and certainly not enough to deploy a Sword Formation.</p><p>Qin Sang immediately focused his mind on the crimson longsword.</p><p>Ten days later, the longsword shook gently, splitting into two. Both Sword Qi were now extremely ethereal, struggling to maintain their form. Qin Sang’s expression tightened, and he repressed it with all his might, finally managing to keep the Sword Qi from collapsing.</p><p>After a short while, the two Sword Qi coalesced slowly into the shape of a longsword.</p><p>Qin Sang smiled, and brandished the Ebony Sword as well. The three longswords stood tip to tip, pointing directly at the center. As the number of split Sword Qi increased, they would form a disk, just like when Wu Yuesheng had performed the technique.</p><p>When cultivated to its peak, the Myriad Machine Sword Formation could split into sixty-four Sword Qi, forming an array with the Ebony Sword. However, the greater the number of split Sword Qi, the more demanding it became for the cultivator.</p><p>Qin Sang could clearly feel the Qi attraction between the Ebony Sword and the Sword Qi. He only needed to focus on manipulating the Ebony Sword to wield the Sword Formation.</p><p>And to Qin Sang’s delight, the Sword Qi was formed from the Ebony Sword’s Sword Qi, and the intent to kill that the Sword Qi carried was greatly amplified, exerting a more powerful impact on the enemy’s mind.</p><p>Swoosh!</p><p>The Sword Qi retracted, and the Ebony Sword flew back into Qin Sang’s glabella.</p><p>Condensing two Sword Qi was enough for now. He could take his time in the future. He had already been at Dragon Return Abbey for over three months. He wondered what the situation was like in his cave abode. Had that tree root managed to ripen the Spirit Spring?</p><p>Qin Sang stood up, and the magic robe on his body flashed. He brushed away the fallen leaves and dust, scanned his surroundings, and summoned the sound transmission符 that Senior Brother Wen had sent back. After reading its contents, his expression changed slightly. He gave it some thought before flying directly towards his cave abode.</p><p>From beginning to end, he never even glanced down the mountain.</p><p>Stealthily submerging himself underwater and activating the Dark Turtle Carapace Formation, Qin Sang hurried through the water. As soon as he entered the cave abode, his face suddenly lit up with delight. The spiritual energy in the cave abode was a whole lot denser than when he had left!</p><p>Qin Sang immediately flashed to the edge of the pool and looked at the Spirit Spring.</p>
