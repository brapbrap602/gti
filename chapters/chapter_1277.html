<h1>Chapter 1269: The Fall</h1><p>The shattering of the mask was deliberate on Qin Sang's part.</p><p>Dongyang Bo already knew his identity, so there was no need to hide it any longer.</p><p>Using the Blood Demon Avatar of the Old Demon Ye as a sacrifice was the perfect opportunity!</p><p>The Blood Demon Avatar self-destructed, causing the demon banners to be struck by the shockwave.</p><p>With no time to reorganize the demon banner formation, Qin Sang swept up all the banners with a flick of his sleeve, extinguished the demonic flames, and urged his sword forward to assist Qing Jun in dealing with the Old Demon Ye.</p><p>At that moment, he heard a mournful cry from the Azure Phoenix, and his heart couldn't help but tremble.</p><p>...</p><p>At the same time as the Blood Demon Avatar self-destructed.</p><p>The Azure Phoenix and the Old Demon Ye's Profound Ice Hand almost simultaneously reached for the Jade Bone.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The sound of the avatar's self-destruction drowned out the clash of their attacks.</p><p>The Azure Phoenix had just grasped one of the Jade Bone's arms when a terrifying chill suddenly spread. The ice rapidly climbed up the Azure Phoenix's talons, freezing its body in an instant.</p><p>Along with the chill came an overwhelming force.</p><p>High in the blood-red sky.</p><p>A single azure feather, as clear as a mountain stream, was encased in a layer of ice, making the Azure Phoenix appear even more ethereal. Like a divine phoenix falling from the heavens, its long tail feathers trailed behind, scattering stardust-like ice shards like rain.</p><p>The Azure Phoenix let out a sorrowful cry, its final song as clear and heartbreaking as the call of a phoenix.</p><p>It struggled to fulfill its master's command, but in the end, it fell short. Both talons, along with half of its body, shattered along with the ice, scattering into the filthy blood pool.</p><p>The Old Demon Ye's Profound Ice Hand crumbled inch by inch, sending the Azure Phoenix flying. Shards of ice, carrying the Jade Bone, flew back under the cover of the Yin-Yang Twin Halberds.</p><p>In the end, the Old Demon Ye had the upper hand!</p><p>Qing Jun's body trembled violently, and a trickle of bright red blood spilled from the corner of her mouth, a sight both shocking and heart-wrenching. The scene of mountains, rivers, and the bright moon shattered, no longer able to be maintained.</p><p>The Azure Phoenix puppet was severely injured, and its master suffered a backlash.</p><p>The Five Directions Pagoda and the Thunder Bead tried to salvage the situation, but it was too late. The Jade Bone was taken away by the Yin-Yang Halberds, and there was no time to pursue it.</p><p>Qing Sang, having just escaped the aftermath of the Blood Demon Avatar's self-destruction, witnessed this scene. He could only watch helplessly as the Old Demon Ye, carrying the Jade Bone, rushed toward the entrance of the blood pool.</p><p>"The ancient cultivator is dead!"</p><p>Just as Qin Sang was about to chase after them with his sword, Qing Jun's cold voice reached his ears.</p><p>He saw the Five Directions Pagoda abandon its pursuit of the Old Demon Ye and suddenly speed off in another directionâ€”toward the battlefield where Tianzheng Elder and Tongyou Demon Lord were fighting!</p><p>Qin Sang paused for a moment, then immediately understood.</p><p>When the alliance of the two realms had decided to enter the Blood Lake, they had already prepared for this scenario.</p><p>The Old Demon Ye and the Sin Abyss had been scheming for years.</p><p>And they, not even fully aware of the true intentions of the Sin Abyss, had sent people to investigate, but the results were unsatisfactory. The chances of disrupting the Sin Abyss's plans were less than one in ten.</p><p>As it turned out, the Old Demon Ye had first laid a false trail, then used the Blood Gate and the Black Tower Formation as obstacles, keeping them running in circles.</p><p>If not for the unexpected variable of Jingyu, by the time they figured out the patterns of the Black Tower Formation and found this place, the Old Demon Ye would have long since escaped with the Jade Bone.</p><p>In their contingency plan, if they couldn't disrupt the Sin Abyss's plans, they would take advantage of the Sin Abyss's unpreparedness to kill one of their Nascent Soul cultivators, weakening their strength.</p><p>Later, from Jingyu's words, they learned that there was an ancient cultivator still alive within the Black Tower Formation, and everyone finally understood what the Sin Abyss was plotting.</p><p>A living ancient cultivator held immense value, and naturally, everyone was greatly tempted.</p><p>But a dead ancient cultivator, aside from the Jade Bone's unique appearance, was no different from the ancient cultivator remains they had seen in secret realms before.</p><p>When Qing Jun had grasped the Jade Bone earlier, she had confirmed that it was completely lifeless.</p><p>The ancient cultivator had struggled to survive, refining his body into this state, but in the end, he could not escape the fate of death. Before they had even arrived, he had already exhausted his life force and died completely.</p><p>Because of this, even after they had broken the seals of the blood pool, the cage, and the shackles on the Jade Bone, it had remained completely unresponsive.</p><p>Over the years, numerous ancient cultivator remains had been excavated from the Ancient Immortal Battlefield and the Purple Micro Palace, some of which were as unusual as the Jade Bone.</p><p>But the fact was, it was difficult to obtain useful information from these remains.</p><p>The ancient cultivator had fallen.</p><p>And now that the Jade Bone was in the hands of the Old Demon Ye, retrieving it would not be easy.</p><p>Qing Jun made a decisive move, following the prearranged plan, and without any warning, the Five Directions Pagoda changed direction and slammed toward Tianzheng Elder.</p><p>Qin Sang, understanding her intent, glanced at the Old Demon Ye and immediately redirected his sword light.</p><p>Coincidentally, when the Blood Demon Avatar had self-destructed earlier, it had blocked Tianzheng Elder's path, causing him to miss the best opportunity to retreat.</p><p>Tongyou Demon Lord also received Qing Jun's warning. A seasoned veteran, he quickly changed tactics, his demonic seal summoning endless baleful winds as he turned to block the Star River.</p><p>The situation changed in an instant.</p><p>In this moment, it was Tianzheng Elder who was desperate to escape, while Tongyou Demon Lord fought desperately to hold him back.</p><p>Within the Star River, Tianzheng Elder's face was filled with anger.</p><p>Although he had always taken this Purple Micro Palace traitor seriously, he had no intention of risking his life here. He had been delaying Tongyou Demon Lord, buying time for the Old Demon Ye to deal with the stronger enemies, while also looking for an opportunity to retreat.</p><p>The strength Qin Sang had displayed had far exceeded his expectations.</p><p>Tianzheng Elder had sensed that something was wrong and had long since prepared to retreat. When he saw the Old Demon Ye and the Jade Bone rushing out of the blood pool, he had been about to make his move.</p><p>The Blood Demon Avatar being forced to self-destruct by the demonic flames was truly unexpected.</p><p>Caught off guard, Tianzheng Elder was unfortunately caught in the blast, missing his chance. However, he also understood that in such a critical moment, the Blood Demon Avatar's self-destruction had been a last resort, and he couldn't blame the Old Demon Ye.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>Behind him, demonic energy surged. The power of Tongyou Demon Lord's innate demonic seal was something he had already experienced earlier.</p><p>Ahead, the Five Directions Pagoda clashed with the Old Demon Ye's Yin-Yang Halberds, neither side gaining the upper hand.</p><p>To the side, sword light blazed, its momentum shaking the heavens.</p><p>If Qin Sang were allowed to set up his sword formation, even the Blood Demon Avatar would find it difficult to break through. Moreover, Qin Sang still had that terrifying demonic flame. Once the demonic flame regained its strength, he might very well follow in the footsteps of the Blood Demon Avatar.</p><p>Surrounded on three sides, Tianzheng Elder was in grave danger!</p><p>Since the two sides had first clashed, although the situation had been unpredictable, everyone had been cautious, not easily putting themselves in danger.</p><p>But now, first the Blood Demon Avatar had self-destructed, and then Tianzheng Elder had been caught in the crossfire.</p><p>The situation was critical!</p><p>Although Tianzheng Elder had been prepared, such a move would inevitably take a heavy toll on him. He couldn't help but sigh. There was no other way now.</p><p>The Star River Diagram, which had manifested the Star River, was now mostly tainted by Tongyou Demon Lord. The remaining stars shone brightly, their light piercingly intense.</p><p>The Star River disappeared, leaving only a massive ball of light.</p><p>The ball of light pulsed like an embryonic sac.</p><p>A giant made of starlight rose, merging with the stars, standing tall and mighty.</p><p>They were at varying distances, but the Yin Thunder Gourd, the Demonic Seal, the Five Directions Pagoda, and the Ebony Sword all arrived in quick succession, followed by the Thunder Bead, surrounding the giant.</p><p>The giant's body was riddled with holes, on the verge of collapse, but it was tenacious, desperately trying to break free.</p><p>'Crack!'</p><p>A thunderstorm descended.</p><p>Qin Sang knew this was a critical moment and unleashed his Thunder Summoning Technique.</p><p>Heavenly thunder tore through the giant's body, but Tianzheng Elder, familiar with Qin Sang's methods, had prepared for this. A green porcelain plate appeared within the giant's wounds, and the lightning merely danced across its surface.</p><p>At the same time.</p><p>The battle at the entrance of the blood pool also reached its conclusion.</p>
