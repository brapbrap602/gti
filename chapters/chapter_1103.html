<h1>Chapter 1095: The True Feather of the Vermilion Bird</h1><p>"I'm fine. Sister Mute's condition is stable," Bai Chuanyin replied.</p><p>As Qin Sang walked out, he said, "The Purple Palace and the Seven Slaughter Hall have completely different auras. I'll take a look at the Heavenly Mountain later. You can try to see if it stirs any memories..."</p><p>Passing through the Sword Path Hall once again, Qin Sang unexpectedly gained new insights!</p><p>While delighted, Qin Sang secretly mocked himself. Back then, his cultivation was too low, and his vision too narrow, causing him to underestimate this Sword Path.</p><p>The hall was filled with an overwhelming sea of sword intent, vast and boundless, as if it had no end.</p><p>Combined with the "Green Bamboo Sword Scripture," he gained another layer of understanding.</p><p>This was his third visit to the Seven Slaughter Hall.</p><p>Qin Sang had first fought alone against a puppet sword formation in the trial realm, then obtained the "Green Bamboo Sword Scripture." Along with his previous accumulations, he felt he was not far from comprehending sword momentum and sword formations.</p><p>However, he no longer needed to force himself to independently comprehend a sword formation.</p><p>The cultivation technique he obtained in the Nether Valley was the subsequent five layers of the "Primordial Spirit Sword Nurturing Chapter," which could take him from the mid-Golden Core stage to the late Nascent Soul stage!</p><p>Moreover, the divine ability after forming the Nascent Soul in this technique was a sword formation called the Seven Souls Slaughter Formation!</p><p>Seeing this sword formation, Qin Sang immediately understood why, after forming his Golden Core, a sword light containing a soul aura had emerged from the technique.</p><p>It was related to the sword formation!</p><p>As the name suggested, the Seven Souls Slaughter Formation was not merely a killing sword formation but also possessed other great divine abilities.</p><p>Exiting the ancient Sword Path Hall, Qin Sang stood before a cliff.</p><p>The surrounding forest swayed like waves, a scene full of vitality.</p><p>"It's indeed different from the Seven Slaughter Hall," Bai appeared beside Qin Sang, surveying the surroundings with curiosity.</p><p>He noticed the shadow of the Heavenly Mountain. "Is that the Heavenly Mountain you mentioned? Its aura seems even more majestic than the Yitian Peak. Could there also be a Demon Lord sealed beneath it?"</p><p>Mentioning the Demon Lord's might, Qin Sang still felt a lingering fear.</p><p>"If there really is a Demon Lord, there's no one here to stop him from breaking the seal. Before I left, the highest cultivation here was the Red-Haired Ancestor, who hadn't broken through to the late Nascent Soul stage. At best, he was on par with the leaders of the three major merchant alliances..."</p><p>Qin Sang gazed at the Heavenly Mountain but detected no unusual movements.</p><p>He wasn't sure if the one summoned by the Sin Abyss was truly a Demon Lord.</p><p>Qin Sang thought it unlikely. Even if it were an ancient demon, its strength would be limited. Otherwise, the Sin Abyss wouldn't need to scheme against the Cold Domain and the Heavenly Alliance—they could have just crushed them outright.</p><p>After a moment of contemplation, Qin Sang observed the fluctuations in the clouds and said, "We still have some time. Let's head straight to the Heavenly Mountain."</p><p>"Agreed!"</p><p>The two immediately set off, swiftly heading toward the Heavenly Mountain.</p><p>Qin Sang's goal was to see if the stone formation by the small lake, where Dongyang Bo had led them into the Heavenly Mountain, was still there.</p><p>The sword spirit was also part of the killing sword.</p><p>Since the sword spirit was within the Black Tower of the Heavenly Mountain, could there also be a cultivation technique hidden there?</p><p>Even Lian Chenyan's master was trapped in the Black Tower. Qin Sang currently lacked the strength to enter but could prepare in advance, waiting until his cultivation improved before investigating.</p><p>This place was sparsely populated.</p><p>Qin Sang flew for a long time without seeing anyone else.</p><p>Only when they neared the Heavenly Mountain did the two exchange a glance and immediately dive into the forest, concealing their presence.</p><p>Strange lights flickered atop the Heavenly Mountain, with fluctuating auras. It was clear that Nascent Soul ancestors were battling inside.</p><p>The two agreed on a meeting point.</p><p>Qin Sang quietly headed toward the small lake on the mountain, while Bai went elsewhere.</p><p>The small lake was located halfway up the Heavenly Mountain.</p><p>Recalling the path Dongyang Bo had taken him, Qin Sang easily found the lake.</p><p>Hiding in the distance, he used his Heavenly Eye technique to observe for a while. Seeing nothing unusual in the lake, he cautiously approached and found that the stone formation at the bottom was gone.</p><p>"Indeed, the entrance is no longer here!"</p><p>Qin Sang frowned, glancing at the summit of the Heavenly Mountain.</p><p>If he successfully formed his Nascent Soul, he should have the strength to forcefully break through the ancient restrictions. However, to uncover the secrets of the Black Tower and the Bronze Hall, he would likely have to deal with Shaohua Mountain and Dongyang Bo.</p><p>"Dongyang Bo, Lian Chenyan... I wonder if they turned against each other after I left..."</p><p>Qin Sang retreated from the Heavenly Mountain, where Bai was already waiting at the meeting point.</p><p>Bai stood on the ground, staring at the summit of the Heavenly Mountain, lost in thought.</p><p>When Qin桑 approached, Bai seemed to snap out of his reverie and exchanged a few words with Qin Sang before retreating into the Corpse Puppet Bag.</p><p>"Sword Scar Mountain!"</p><p>Qin Sang looked in another direction, his expression solemn.</p><p>"If this old man fails, the next time you enter the Purple Palace, light an incense stick for me. That will be enough!"</p><p>These were the last words Wanderer Yun had said to him before he left.</p><p>To this day, Qin Sang had not forgotten a single word!</p><p>Wanderer Yun, in his pursuit of forming a Golden Core, willingly threw himself into the South Ming Flame, using the demonic fire to burn his body, temper his soul, and be reborn from the flames.</p><p>Although Qin Sang had helped him obtain the green copper block that countered the South Ming Flame, Wanderer Yun's actions were still akin to a moth flying into the flame—a near-suicidal endeavor.</p><p>Qin Sang had come here to fulfill his promise.</p><p>If Wanderer Yun succeeded, they would meet again, supporting each other as they continued their journey on the path of immortality.</p><p>But if Wanderer Yun perished in the South Ming Flame...</p><p>Qin Sang would still light an incense stick to bid farewell to his old friend.</p><p>As Qin Sang sped through the forest, even with a heart as hard as iron, he couldn't help but feel uneasy.</p><p>Both Green Bamboo and Wanderer Yun were like mentors and friends to Qin Sang.</p><p>Compared to Green Bamboo, he had spent more time with Wanderer Yun, and their bond was deeper.</p><p>He had just witnessed the end of Green Bamboo's legend and didn't want to lose another old friend.</p><p>Arriving at the foot of Sword Scar Mountain, Qin Sang took a deep breath and followed the instructions Wanderer Yun had given him, passing through the ancient formation.</p><p>This time, it was much easier than before. Soon, Qin桑顺利抵达石殿。</p><p>环顾四周。</p><p>石殿一切正常，没有其他修士的痕迹。</p><p>秦桑找到那块石砖，伸手按下，一阵波动传来，地道开启，旋即一股灼热气息扑面而来。</p><p>南明离火仍在！</p><p>他快步向暗道深处掠去，终于看到一团深红色的火焰。</p><p>秦桑迫不及待走上前，视线飞快从南明离火之中扫过，一颗悬着的心猛然放了下来，脸上浮现出惊喜之色。</p><p>绿铜块不在这里！</p><p>至少说明云游子没有陨落在这，很可能成功了。</p><p>这时，尸傀袋传出白一声轻咦，“竟是南明离火！”</p><p>秦桑闻言，连忙追问，“道友认得此火？”</p><p>白现身，点点头，指着南明离火中心的神鸟虚影，惊叹道：“这是朱雀本命真火！如果我没猜错，这团南明离火至今仍不熄灭，很可能是朱雀真羽！其威能，绝对不逊色九凤王手中那根长翎，若是完整真羽，势必更强！”</p><p>“竟是朱雀真羽！”</p><p>秦桑也被惊到了。</p><p>九凤王的那枚长翎，留给他难以磨灭的印象，朱雀真羽竟还强过长翎！</p><p>白瞥了秦桑一眼，呵呵一笑道：“想收服朱雀真羽可不容易，没有朱雀血脉，无法获得朱雀真羽认可。即便是朱雀后裔，以现世的情况，血脉稀薄无比，也不可能做到。”</p><p>（感谢是夏天呀大佬打赏盟主！</p><p>过年应酬太多，静不下心来。等回去稳定，会把加更补上！）</p>
