<h1></h1><p>Golden Jade Prefecture.</p><p>The Azure Fox Holy King, having little interest in the human cultivators' Dharma Assembly, had dragged the Radiant Light Holy Sage out to the Storm Belt upon hearing news of a ferocious beast sighting. They had only just returned.</p><p>Before them lay a giant cartographic map, primarily depicting the northern regions of the Middle Continent, with the majority of markings located within the Storm Belt beyond the barrier.</p><p>"The information gathered by the Zen Monastery over the years indicates that over eighty percent of the ferocious beasts have appeared in the northern part of the Middle Continent," the Radiant Light Holy Sage said, drawing a circle on the map.</p><p>The Azure Fox Holy King, however, seemed somewhat distracted.</p><p>"Last night, at the hour of Zi, did you perceive that strange whisper within the Demonic Sound of the Heavenly Dao?"</p><p>The Radiant Light Holy Sage's expression stiffened slightly.</p><p>"So you heard it as well."</p><p>The Azure Fox Holy King sighed. "Though the whisper was extremely brief, this King is certain it was not an illusion.  Previously, the Demonic Sound of the Heavenly Dao could be explained as a celestial shift, but what is this whisper? Could someone be eroding the Heavenly Dao?"</p><p>The Radiant Light Holy Sage remained silent for a long while before speaking. "It may not necessarily be a person behind it.  It could still be a mutation of the Heavenly Dao, creating the illusion of a whisper. That sound clearly lacked reason, its meaning obscure."</p><p>"Regardless of what lies behind it, it's not a good omen."</p><p>The Azure Fox Holy King countered, "Whether it has meaning can only be known through communication. In this world, only you and I can perceive the Demonic Sound of the Heavenly Dao. Old Monk, do you dare to actively communicate with it?"</p><p>"It's highly unlikely we'd receive a response. The whisper, like the Demonic Sound of the Heavenly Dao, is imbued with boundless madness."</p><p>The Radiant Light Holy Sage didn't explain the basis for this deduction.</p><p>The Azure Fox Holy King added, "Directly perceiving the whisper might even accelerate the rate of corruption by madness, shaking our Dao Foundations, and perhaps even inviting a great terror."</p><p>This was the most fatal consequence.</p><p>"What is happening to this realm?"</p><p>The Azure Fox Holy King couldn't help but sigh.</p><p>When the nest overturns, no egg remains intact.</p><p>The Heavenly Dao of this realm was mutating. First came the Demonic Sound, then the whisper. What would come next?  Pessimistically speaking, there might come a day when the influence of the Demonic Sound was no longer limited to those at the Nascent Soul realm, spreading its madness to all living beings.</p><p>If this small world was truly heading towards destruction, billions of living beings would be buried with it!</p><p>The Azure Fox Holy King and the Radiant Light Holy Sage were the most unwilling to accept this fate.</p><p>They had already reached the pinnacle of this realm.  All they needed to do was cultivate diligently, accumulate sufficient power, and then journey eastward to the Returning Ruins, pass through the Gate of the Dao Marker, and escape this cage.</p><p>Yet, on the verge of transcendence, they encountered this unheard-of, strange phenomenon, something their immense power couldn't even begin to address.</p><p>Beneath Immortals, all are ants.</p><p>They had heard this countless times when their cultivation was low, and they had felt its truth deeply.</p><p>As their cultivation grew and their status rose, they could take whatever they wanted from this world, controlling life and death. They hadn't felt like 'ants' in a long time.</p><p>The Radiant Light Holy Sage couldn't answer.</p><p>Their gazes fell back to the map.</p><p>The Azure Fox Holy King said, "The frequency of ferocious beast appearances has significantly decreased compared to the initial period.  We must capture the next beast that passes through.  This King doesn't want to wait another few hundred years!"</p><p>The Radiant Light Holy Sage replied, "Even with ferocious beasts whose cultivation is comparable to ours, capturing them alive is extremely difficult.  They know no fear, and become even more ferocious when injured.  They won't be captured easily. We must make thorough preparations."</p><p>"This King's Palace Guardian Immortal Formation, with half of its formation flags being ancient immortal flags, combined with your personal oversight of the Diamond Subduing Demons Formation, Old Monk, gives us a reasonable chance. However, to lure the beast step by step into the formation requires meticulous planning beforehand. We'll begin setting the trap at the location we previously selected..."</p><p>As the Azure Fox Holy King spoke, he pointed to several locations on the map.</p><p>While the two discussed hunting the beast...</p><p>The Dharma Assembly was in full swing.</p><p>The Radiant Light Holy Sage, intending to lure out the hidden dangers, had not only erased the memories of the cultivators near the Unfounded Palace but had also deliberately concealed his movements. Only a handful of individuals, such as Grandmaster Xingji, knew of the Nascent Soul cultivator's return.</p><p>Today, the Dharma Assembly had reached its most anticipated segment: the sparring matches.</p><p>The Golden Jade Sect had specifically refined a Grand Golden Gate Formation for this purpose.</p><p>Four thousand-foot-tall golden gates stood tall in the void, positioned in the four cardinal directions.</p><p>Between the golden gates, dense clouds churned like a sea.</p><p>This was the arena where the cultivators from various sects would spar.</p><p>The surging cloud waves provided ample space for Nascent Soul cultivators to fully unleash their divine abilities.</p><p>Runes flickered on the pillars of the golden gates, with Golden Jade Sect experts stationed at each direction, guarding the gates and ready to respond to any unforeseen circumstances.</p><p>At this moment...</p><p>Around the arena, cloud-formed seats were arranged in layers, rising upwards in a dense formation.</p><p>The seats were packed with people, with hardly any empty spaces visible.</p><p>The northernmost section, however, was less crowded, reserved for the powerful figures of the various sects.</p><p>Sect Master Jin Wudai of the Golden Jade Sect, as the host, sat in the center, watching the grand spectacle with evident satisfaction.</p><p>The Sweet Dew Zen Monastery and the Eight Scenery Pavilion flanked him on either side, while the other sects took their respective positions.</p><p>True Person Seven Careful of the Eight Scenery Pavilion, disguised as Pavilion Master True Person Zi Lei, had kept a low profile after arriving at Golden Jade Prefecture, appearing only once during the opening ceremony of the Dharma Assembly.</p><p>The sparring matches were directly related to the final distribution of benefits, so even if he had other important matters to attend to, it would be inappropriate not to appear today.</p><p>On the arena...</p><p>Two figures, a man and a woman, were engaged in an intense spar.  They were True Person Yang of the Eight Scenery Pavilion and Yu Zhi, an expert from the Golden Jade Sect.</p><p>Yu Zhi, the female cultivator, was petite, with skin as smooth and delicate as jade, even more so than a baby's.</p><p>She wielded a three-zhang long red silk ribbon.</p><p>As the red ribbon danced, it emitted a series of crisp, metallic sounds.</p><p>It turned out that the ribbon was inlaid with a row of gold, round, square-holed coins. With each wave, gold and red light flickered alternately, and as the female cultivator moved, she seemed to be dancing with the ribbon, a captivating sight.</p><p>The beauty was only superficial.</p><p>Only True Person Yang, her opponent, knew the true power of the red ribbon.</p><p>True Person Yang wielded a thumb-sized jade sword, his natal magic treasure, refined from a rare type of spiritual jade.  It could easily pierce through an opponent's protective true essence, possessing remarkable power.</p><p>Facing Yu Zhi, however, True Person Yang was inwardly groaning.</p><p>Hidden within the radiant light of the dancing red ribbon were extremely fine golden threads.</p><p>Every time the jade sword struck, encountering the golden threads, it would meet significant resistance, its power greatly diminished, allowing Yu Zhi to easily dodge.</p><p>What troubled True Person Yang the most was that when the jade sword approached the golden threads, they would seize the initiative, clinging to the sword like a tenacious vine.</p><p>'Puff!'</p><p>The jade sword returned empty-handed once again.</p><p>True Person Yang changed his tactics.  He had intended to use the sword to engage Yu Zhi in a prolonged battle, searching for an opening.</p><p>Unexpectedly, as the jade sword circled Yu Zhi, its blade suddenly trembled, nearly losing control.</p><p>True Person Yang's expression drastically changed. He let out a long cry, forcibly retracting the jade sword and immediately putting distance between himself and Yu Zhi, his face full of vigilance.</p><p>Seeing this, a look of satisfaction flashed in Jin Wudai's eyes. He turned slightly and asked, "In Pavilion Master's opinion, what will be the outcome of this battle between Seventh Sister and True Person Yang?"</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Yu Zhi's 'Chisel Gold Control Jade Technique' has reached the Transformation Realm.  Disciple Nephew Yang's natal magic treasure is being restrained. He's going to lose."</p><p>True Person Seven Careful seemed somewhat distracted.</p><p>From the corner of his eye, he saw a monk hurriedly enter the arena, walking briskly towards Grandmaster Xingji.</p><p>--</p><p>--</p><p>Yesterday afternoon I drove home for several hours and went straight to bed. I woke up at noon and my mom didn't have the heart to wake me...</p><p>I wrote two thousand words first, I'll eat something and then continue writing.</p>
