<h1>Chapter 1133: Seven Slaughter Sword Formation</h1><p>The breakthrough of the fourth layer of *Heavenly Demon Refinement* and the advancement of the Sky-Eye Butterfly to its fourth transformation both provided significant assistance in forming the Nascent Soul. However, Qin Sang was completely clueless about how to advance his spirit insects. With no other options, he could only focus on improving himself. Now that he had discovered clues related to the stone slab and the phantom of the Azure Phoenix, how could he not seize this opportunity? Without trying, how would he know if it was possible?</p><p>Having made his decision, Qin Sang did not rush to act. Instead, he used the Sword Wheel as a foundation, integrating insights from the Puppet Sword Formation, *Primordial Spirit Sword Nurturing Art*, and *Green Bamboo Sword Scripture*. After much deliberation, he finally created his own sword formation.</p><p>To call it "self-created" was somewhat embarrassing. The formation was derived from the Seven Souls Slaughter Formation of the *Primordial Spirit Sword Nurturing Art*. However, Qin Sang's cultivation level was insufficient to fully comprehend the true essence of the Seven Souls Slaughter Formation. As a result, he had to incorporate the various transformations of the Puppet Sword Formation into it.</p><p>More importantly, the *Green Bamboo Sword Scripture* played a crucial role. Senior Green Bamboo was undoubtedly a genius in the sword path, having created a killing talisman and continued his cultivation method even at the Golden Core stage. Although Qin Sang had only grasped a portion of the *Green Bamboo Sword Scripture*'s true meaning, he had benefited immensely, with his sword path realm advancing significantly. After meticulous refinement, the sword formation now appeared quite impressive.</p><p>Outside his cave abode, Qin Sang soared through the air and found an open area.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>A green shadow, swift as lightning, shot through the air. In the next moment, the green shadow abruptly halted mid-air, the light dissipating to reveal a figure with phoenix wings.</p><p>Qin Sang activated his Heavenly Demon Transformation, sensing the improvements brought by years of arduous cultivation. Both his physical body and cultivation had broken through, and his strength had risen accordingly. This was evident in his movement techniques alone. After activating the Heavenly Demon Transformation, he could fully unleash the power of dual cultivation of body and spirit. His speed alone was now faster than when he simultaneously used three divine abilities before. Combined with his ability to freely wield the Nine Dragons Heavenly Chariot Talisman, unleash the full power of his secret talismans, and his further advancement in sword cultivation, Qin Sang felt that his speed was now comparable to that of an early-stage Nascent Soul cultivator.</p><p>The three-colored light of his movement technique flickered. Qin Sang instantly vanished deep into the mountains, only to return moments later. His movement technique was indeed far superior to before, and a satisfied smile appeared on his face. This would be his best means of survival.</p><p>"Rise!"</p><p>With a slight thought, the Ebony Wood Sword trembled and shot out a dazzling sword radiance, cold and luminous like moonlight.</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>The sword radiance circled above Qin Sang's head for a moment. As he completed the sword seal, the Ebony Wood Sword split into new sword lights. Seven of these sword lights took shape first. These seven sword lights were the divine abilities obtained from cultivating the *Primordial Spirit Sword Nurturing Art*. Senior Green Bamboo had called them "sword souls." Now that Qin Sang's cultivation had reached a high level, all seven sword lights had appeared.</p><p>These seven sword lights were different from ordinary ones, each carrying a trace of spiritual aura. However, Qin Sang's cultivation was still insufficient to fully utilize them, so he could only use them as the backbone of his sword formation.</p><p>Subsequently, one sword light after another split from the spirit sword, their brilliance intensifying. The sword lights converged into a river, illuminating the area around Qin Sang.</p><p>"Form the formation!"</p><p>Qin Sang shouted, and the sword seal changed again.</p><p>A humming sound filled the air as the seven sword souls suddenly scattered, forming the rudiments of a sword formation around Qin Sang. Other sword lights continued to appear, eventually forming a complete sword formation!</p><p>At a glance, the sword formation appeared circular, slowly rotating in mid-air, resembling a dazzling sword lotus! The lotus had sharp edges, embodying Qin Sang's understanding of the sword path and the insights he had gained from Senior Green Bamboo.</p><p>Even before activation, the formation exuded a sharp, unstoppable aura!</p><p>Qin Sang stared intently at the sword formation. As the sword seals changed, the formation's shape also shifted unpredictably, sometimes condensing into a towering giant sword, other times scattering as if without any pattern. Qin Sang had incorporated all the transformations of the Puppet Sword Formation he had memorized, and the results were quite impressive.</p><p>Suddenly, all the sword lights contracted violently, converging into a thick beam of light that shot into the sky, piercing through the clouds.</p><p>The beam was awe-inspiring, instantly dispersing the clouds in the sky.</p><p>Qin Sang looked up, watching the beam until it disappeared. Sensing the power of this strike, he nodded slightly.</p><p>"It's not as powerful as the Twelve Demon Banner Grand Formation, but it has the advantage of being under my control. Additionally, the Misty Cosmos Pill I bought on Cangheng Island has an effect similar to Soul Cleansing Liquid, instantly boosting my spiritual sense. Unfortunately, it's too expensive and rareâ€”I only managed to acquire one. Although I've used up all the Three Lights Jade Liquid, my cultivation has advanced significantly. After using the Twelve Demon Banners, my true essence no longer depletes completely as before, giving me a chance to escape... With these divine abilities combined with my movement techniques, even facing a demon king or a Nascent Soul cultivator, I might still have room to maneuver..."</p><p>Moreover, his goal was to approach the stone slab, not to engage in a life-and-death battle with a demon king.</p><p>Qin Sang dispersed the sword formation and recalled the Ebony Wood Sword. After a moment of contemplation, he softly said, "This formation was born from the Seven Souls Slaughter Formation. Let's call it the Seven Slaughter Sword Formation."</p><p>Afterward, Qin Sang returned to his cave abode and secluded himself for a while, consolidating all his divine abilities.</p><p>Before setting out, Qin Sang woke Bai.</p><p>To his delight, Bai agreed to accompany him to the Heavenly Demon Hills. With Bai's assistance, his chances of success increased.</p><p>Leaving the cave, Qin Sang first visited a familiar market to inquire about the recent state of the cultivation world. Then he turned northwest, planning to pass through the Immortal-Demon City to enter the demon realm.</p><p>The Immortal-Demon City was a major city controlled by the Spirit Taming Sect, bordering the demon realm of the Heavenly Demon Hills. It was said to have the support of the Heavenly Demon Hills and served as a gateway connecting the Heavenly Demon Hills and the cultivation world of the Minor Cold Domain.</p><p>Years ago, Wanderer Yun had mentioned that he had been lurking in the Immortal-Demon City for many years, gathering information about the Crimson Cloud Purple Fruit.</p><p>Now Qin Sang knew that this was just Wanderer Yun's way of avoiding revealing his true identity. He must have known about the Crimson Cloud Purple Fruit long ago.</p><p>In fact, during the battle in the Purple Micro Palace against the Shadow Devouring Leopard for the Crimson Cloud Purple Fruit, Wanderer Yun's manipulation of the Demon King Blood Restriction to suppress the leopard had already hinted at his true capabilities.</p><p>However, Qin Sang had never imagined something as bizarre as the fusion of human and demon souls, so he hadn't delved deeper into it.</p><p>The further west he traveled, the harsher the environment became, and the sparser the population grew.</p><p>The Heavenly Demon Hills were a place of rugged mountains and treacherous waters.</p><p>Mortals had always lived in the Heavenly Demon Hills, but after the cultivators ceded the area to the demons, only some of the mortals were relocated to this side of the mountain range.</p><p>As a border city between humans and demons, the Immortal-Demon City was filled with peculiar scenes of coexistence between the two races, making it the largest demon city in the Heavenly Demon Hills.</p><p>After a long journey, Qin Sang arrived at the Immortal-Demon City, joining a merchant caravan to blend into the city.</p><p>Upon entering the city, Qin Sang witnessed a scene even more peculiar than anything he had seen in the Canglang Sea.</p><p>Not only were humans walking the streets, but he also occasionally saw groups of wolves, tigers, and leopards passing by.</p><p>Among them, the leading demons, though still in their beast forms, were clearly different. They lacked wildness, spoke human language, and were as courteous as humans, clearly having been enlightened by the Emperor's Sap. Under their guidance, their less intelligent subordinates were well-behaved, rarely causing harm to humans.</p><p>The mortals in the city seemed long accustomed to the presence of these fierce demons, showing no fear.</p><p>Qin Sang wandered through the streets and alleys, arriving at an inconspicuous shop.</p><p>To his surprise, there was no shopkeeper inside. Instead, a white cat lay lazily on the counter.</p><p>---</p><p>---</p><p>I returned late today and only managed to write one chapter. I'll make up for it later.</p>
