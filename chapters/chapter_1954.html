<h1>Chapter 1945: Palm-Grasped Thunder</h1><p>The Taiyi Thunderclap Talisman, when still, remains dormant; when roused, it shakes heaven and earth!</p><p>The halo above Qin Sang's head blazed with brilliant light, as if an endless torrent of thunder was unleashed from within.</p><p>The surrounding vital essence of heaven and earth seethed in response. Bolts of lightning crackled into existence, transforming the desolate wilderness into a realm of thunder and lightning.</p><p>Above and below, thunder was omnipresent, its every arc aimed at Qingyuan.</p><p>Qingyuan seemed to have fallen into a cauldron of boiling thunder plasma.</p><p>‘Rumble!’</p><p>Even more dazzling flashes of lightning erupted from within the thunder plasma.</p><p>Although the Taiyi Thunderclap Talisman shared a common origin with the Taiyi Thunder Drill Talisman, it was not a simple upgrade.  The power manifested by the thunder talisman wasn't a few thunder drills, but eight thunder dragons!</p><p>Silver-white thunder dragons frantically devoured the surrounding lightning, growing in size and power, becoming immensely huge and formidable in an instant.</p><p>Their tails reached the heavens, their heads bowed to the earth, as if they were divine dragons descending from the celestial realm. The roar of thunder was their furious cry.</p><p>Qingyuan was surrounded by thunder dragons.</p><p>Compared to the colossal thunder dragons, Qingyuan appeared insignificant, especially since there were eight of them!</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>A deafening clap of thunder echoed through the air.</p><p>The eight thunder dragons, twisting and turning, fiercely charged toward Qingyuan.</p><p>This attack was overwhelmingly powerful, as Qin Sang held back little, manipulating the vital essence of heaven and earth with his full strength, transforming it into thunder.</p><p>Life-or-death battles between Void Refinement cultivators often involved a struggle for the vital essence of heaven and earth, but even then, they rarely dared to act so recklessly.</p><p>The vital essence wasn't necessarily the more the better. If one couldn't fully control it, achieving a level of meticulous precision, it would become a vulnerability in the eyes of an opponent of the same rank.  If the opponent seized the opportunity, or even usurped control of the essence, the Daoist technique would crumble.</p><p>With both sides exercising caution, such a powerful display of force was seldom seen, even in a protracted battle.</p><p>However, since they had agreed to a contest of Daoist techniques, there was naturally no need to worry about these concerns.</p><p>The two had already joined forces to seal off the surrounding area, preventing even the greatest commotion from reaching the outside world.</p><p>The thunder dragons coalesced into one.</p><p>Where Qingyuan stood, only a blinding ball of thunder light remained visible to the naked eye. Qingyuan's body was completely engulfed by the thunder.</p><p>Only Qin Sang could see through the thunder light, observing the scene within.</p><p>From the moment the Taiyi Thunderclap Talisman erupted, Qingyuan had maintained his hand seal posture, floating three zhang above the ground, motionless.</p><p>He seemed to have not employed any Daoist technique, but Qin Sang knew that the key lay within his hand seals.</p><p>"This is…"</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze sharpened as he immediately understood.</p><p>This was, in fact, a talisman!</p><p>A talisman refined to its utmost essence. Although Qingyuan didn't have a talisman altar to store talisman imprints, he could still activate talismans with a flick of his wrist!</p><p>Countering a talisman with a talisman!</p><p>This demonstrated Qingyuan's astonishing mastery of the Dao of Talismans!</p><p>As the thunder enveloped him, a watery blue light shimmered in Qingyuan's palm. Then, the sound of surging waves echoed around him. A great river flowed forth from the void, rapidly condensing into four water mirrors that encircled Qingyuan.</p><p>‘Splash! Splash! Splash!’</p><p>Lightning bolts struck the water mirrors, as if hitting a thin membrane of water.</p><p>Thunder was supremely powerful and unyielding.</p><p>The surface of the water mirrors was incredibly supple, rippling and rebounding, yet capable of overcoming strength with softness, forming an impenetrable barrier.</p><p>Crackling sounds and flashing lightning surrounded Qingyuan, but no matter how ferocious the lightning's assault, it couldn't penetrate the water mirrors and harm him.</p><p>The Taiyi Thunderclap Talisman alone was clearly insufficient to defeat Qingyuan. Qin Sang had anticipated this and had already begun chanting incantations, preparing another talisman while the thunder dragons attacked.</p><p>This talisman was also a third-order thunder talisman, called the Noxious Smoke Severed Rainbow Talisman, even more potent than the Taiyi Thunderclap Talisman.</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't fully deciphered this talisman yet and hadn't condensed its Divine Talisman Imprint, so activating it wasn't as swift as the Taiyi Thunderclap Talisman.</p><p>However, with the aid of the talisman altar, even without the Divine Talisman Imprint, Qin Sang's speed in activating talismans was beyond the reach of others.</p><p>Just as the power of the thunder dragons began to wane, the Noxious Smoke Severed Rainbow Talisman was ready.</p><p>Suddenly, the vital essence of heaven and earth stirred once more. Dark clouds gathered high above, darkening the sky.</p><p>This gloom lasted only a brief moment before flames illuminated the void.</p><p>“Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh…”</p><p>What fell from the dark clouds wasn't rain, but balls of fire.</p><p>A rain of fire descended from the heavens!</p><p>Countless meteors plummeted from the sky.</p><p>This scene seemed familiar, reminiscent of the Golden Bell Fire-Lightning Summoning.</p><p>The Noxious Smoke Severed Rainbow Talisman summoned boundless thunderfire, but the fire wouldn't directly strike the ground. Instead, it converged mid-air, forming a rainbow of thunderfire.</p><p>The fire rainbow tore through the sky, shooting toward Qingyuan with astonishing momentum, as if piercing the heavens themselves. Billowing black smoke trailed in its wake.</p><p>The thick black smoke even obscured the body of the fire rainbow.</p><p>If this area hadn't been sealed, the people in Jindu County would only have seen the sky-obscuring black smoke and the initial segment of the fire rainbow, hence the name "Severed Rainbow."</p><p>Both in terms of power and spectacle, the Noxious Smoke Severed Rainbow Talisman was superior.  The four water mirrors alone weren't enough to defend against it.  Qingyuan joined his fingers into a sword shape and pointed towards the sky.</p><p>A point of primal yellow light coalesced at his fingertips, exuding a sense of profound weight and containing infinite possibilities.  It suddenly shot towards the celestial pole!</p><p>Another talisman!</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The primal yellow light pierced through the dark clouds. Qin Sang suddenly felt as if heaven and earth trembled, as though an immense, unparalleled force had collided with this void.</p><p>Suddenly, a shadow enveloped Qingyuan.</p><p>A stone stele, completely jet black and less than ten zhang tall, yet impossibly heavy, fell from the sky, piercing through the dark clouds as it descended.</p><p>Just at this moment, as the fire rainbow approached, the stone stele slammed down towards it.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The black smoke exploded instantly.</p><p>Although the fire rainbow wasn't completely destroyed, its path was blocked by the stone stele.</p><p>This space seemed to be suppressed by the stele. The subsequent thunderfire couldn't cross over, only encircling the stele.</p><p>More and more thunderfire gathered around the stele, flames licking at its surface.</p><p>The sky burned crimson, yet the stele remained unmelted.</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't surprised. He didn't even glance at it, but acted again!</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>The Jade Clarity Thunder Summoning Talisman!</p><p>Along with the thunder came rolling thunderfire.</p><p>The Golden Bell Fire-Lightning Summoning followed closely behind.</p><p>At this point, the thunderfire summoned by the Noxious Smoke Severed Rainbow Talisman was at its peak power. Suddenly, it surged back, merging with the new thunderfire.</p><p>The Noxious Smoke Severed Rainbow Talisman created the ideal environment, and the Golden Bell Fire-Lightning Summoning absorbed the power of the thunderfire, its potency boosted to a terrifying level.</p><p>This was an insight Qin Sang had gained after studying the Dao of Thunder. Certain thunder talismans with similar properties, when used in conjunction, could achieve far greater power. The same principle applied to talisman diagrams.</p><p>And this wasn't the end. Amidst the raging thunderfire, the Five Thunders Heavenly Heart Seal Talisman appeared!</p><p>Three talismans unleashed simultaneously, their thunderous might unparalleled!</p><p>“Excellent!”</p><p>Qingyuan's eyes flashed with brilliant light.  He used his finger as a brush, drawing in the void. A rune instantly formed.</p><p>This rune's shape was peculiar, possessing a strange elegance. It resembled flowing water, a long banner swaying in the breeze, or perhaps a wisp of wind itself.</p><p>The rune floated upwards and then dissipated.  New runes continuously formed at Qingyuan's fingertips.</p><p>Each rune's form was different, yet all shared a similar elegance.</p><p>Runes appeared and vanished one after another, eventually forming a faint outline in the air, resembling a cyan cloth bag.</p><p>The bag's opening was slightly closed. Facing the onslaught of thunder, it suddenly opened wide, unleashing an immensely powerful suction force.</p><p>‘Whoosh! Whoosh!’</p><p>Nearly tangible gales could be seen at the bag's opening.</p><p>This seemed like a bottomless wind bag, capable of swallowing everything, including thunder!</p><p>Whether it was the combined power of the three talismans or the stray lightning in the void, all were devoured by the wind bag.</p><p>In an instant, the chaos between heaven and earth subsided, leaving only the wind bag, slowly descending before Qingyuan, bulging and full.</p><p>Qin Sang stared at the wind bag in astonishment. This attack, aside from not using the Azure鸞 True Thunder, was practically his strongest means in the Dao of Thunder.</p><p>He had personally witnessed Thunder Ancestor using the Five Thunders Heavenly Heart Seal and had a deep understanding of this talisman.</p><p>Even a mid-Void Refinement cultivator wouldn't dare to take this attack lightly.</p><p>Yet, it was absorbed into a bag in an almost comical manner.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't attack again.  Continuing this spar held no further meaning.</p><p>‘Buzz, buzz, buzz…’</p><p>The wind bag wriggled and pulsed, muffled rumbles emanating from within.</p><p>Qingyuan closed his eyes, seemingly exerting all his strength to suppress the thunderous power inside, not as relaxed as he appeared.</p><p>However, Qin Sang soon noticed something amiss.</p><p>After remaining still for the time it took to brew a cup of tea, Qingyuan raised his hand and gently patted the wind bag.  A ball of thunder light was expelled.</p><p>The thunder light warped and distorted, emitting fluctuations familiar to Qin Sang.</p><p>The Jade Clarity Thunder Summoning Talisman!</p><p>Qin Sang's expression shifted slightly.  What was truly shocking was that Qingyuan hadn't merely replicated the talisman, but had also imbued it with a hint of the High Zenith Divine Thunder Scripture's aura!</p><p>Talismans carried Daoist techniques, and Daoist techniques were the foundation of the Talisman Dao lineage!</p><p>How had Qingyuan accomplished this?</p><p>Qin Sang was deeply shaken.  He opened his mouth to speak, but then hesitated, watching as Qingyuan patted the wind bag again. A ball of thunderfire flew out.</p><p>As expected, the thunderfire transformed into the Golden Bell Fire-Lightning Summoning, also carrying the aura of a Daoist technique!</p><p>Then, Qingyuan became still once more.</p><p>Qin Sang was eager to know the reason.  He patiently waited for three full hours before Qingyuan finally moved, patting the wind bag again.</p><p>The remaining thunder returned to the world, right in front of Qin Sang, transforming into the Five Thunders Heavenly Heart Seal.</p><p>The mastery Qingyuan displayed with this talisman now rivaled Qin Sang's own.</p><p>Qin Sang suspected that Qingyuan's inability to execute the complete Five Thunders Heavenly Heart Seal Talisman was related to him, as he hadn't fully deciphered it himself!</p><p>Most astonishing was the Daoist technique aura imbued within the thunder talismans.</p><p>Qingyuan had actually used these three thunder talismans to reverse-engineer the High Zenith Divine Thunder Scripture. Even though he hadn't fully deduced it, this feat was still utterly astounding.</p><p>After all, the High Zenith Divine Thunder Scripture, refined by generations of Dao Court sages and embodying the collective wisdom of countless individuals, was one of the three Grand Official Scriptures!</p><p>“Truly ingenious!”</p><p>Qingyuan exhaled softly, expressing his sincere admiration.</p><p>Qin Sang remained silent, numbed by what he had witnessed.</p><p>The person before him was possibly far more powerful than he had imagined!</p><p>“Fellow Daoist… have you cultivated Daoist techniques before?” Qin Sang asked, his voice strained.</p><p>He wondered if addressing the other party as 'Fellow Daoist' was still appropriate.</p><p>Qingyuan nodded slightly. “I've encountered some fragmented techniques, but the renowned orthodox transmission of the Thunder Ministry - the High Zenith Divine Thunder Scripture - has been lost for ages.  I've always yearned to see it, much to my regret! Today, I've finally fulfilled my wish.”</p><p>Qin Sang fell silent again.</p><p>“Unfortunately, Daoist techniques are intrinsically linked to scriptures.  Ultimately, one cannot fully deduce them solely through 'talismans.' However, today, I've had the privilege of witnessing the splendor of the orthodox Thunder Ministry transmission of the Talisman Dao lineage. I'm deeply satisfied.  Many thanks, Daoist Priest.”</p><p>Qingyuan noticed Qin Sang's expression and seemed to misunderstand, adding with a touch of embarrassment, "Overwhelmed by excitement, I couldn't resist studying and imitating.  Please forgive my presumptuousness, Daoist Priest."</p><p>Was this imitation?  Wasn't this outright theft of his techniques?</p><p>But, was there such a thing as blatant, open theft?</p><p>To learn another's Daoist techniques with a single glance, such a terrifying ability... Who would dare to use Daoist techniques in front of this person!</p><p>Qingyuan flicked his finger, sending a streak of spiritual light toward Qin Sang.  “It's impolite not to reciprocate. Please accept this Palm-Grasped Thunder technique, Daoist Priest.”</p><p>Qin Sang hesitated at first, but after hearing the function of this Daoist technique, he immediately reached out and caught the spiritual light.</p><p>“This is not a technique for killing, but it's quite profound.  By using Palm-Grasped Thunder, one can grasp all manner of divine thunder, except for tribulation lightning, within one's palm.  By observing it with one's heart, one can quickly understand the characteristics of thunder…”</p><p>Qingyuan explained.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't refuse this Daoist technique!</p><p>He hadn't used the Azure鸞 True Thunder at all while activating the talismans earlier.</p><p>Firstly, he didn't want to reveal his trump card. Secondly, he couldn't fully control the Azure鸾 True Thunder yet.</p><p>If the power of this Palm-Grasped Thunder wasn't exaggerated, it would be immensely beneficial to him.</p><p>Clearly, Qingyuan had sensed the unique thunder power hidden within him and had identified the crux of the problem, offering a targeted solution.</p><p>Qin Sang held the spiritual light, hesitated, then said, “I can channel the power of the talisman altar to create a token for you. If you find the Myriad Dharma Sect Altar, it will let them know that the Talisman Dao lineage still exists in the Great Thousand World! However, I'm not sure how effective it will be, or whether the Talisman Dao lineage will meet with you…”</p><p>Qingyuan's strength was unfathomable.  He might genuinely be able to locate the Dao Court.</p><p>This action not only curried favor with Qingyuan, but also allowed Qin Sang to relay a message.</p><p>The Dao Court and the First Sword Attendant definitely still had contact. If they had already pinpointed the Sword Pavilion's location, they might actively seek him out to retrieve the Earth Slaughter Sword fragment and the cultivation techniques.</p><p>Qingyuan was naturally delighted.</p><p>His greatest fear was finding the Myriad Dharma Sect Altar only to be shunned by the Talisman Dao lineage.  This token would allow him to communicate with them.</p><p>Qin Sang retrieved a piece of spirit jade from the Thousand Jun Ring, channeled the power of the High Zenith Divine Thunder Scripture, left an imprint within the spirit jade, and refined it into a special magical artifact.</p><p>As long as it was near the Dao Court, it would certainly be detected.</p><p>“Many thanks! Take care, Daoist Priest!”</p><p>Qingyuan bowed slightly, no longer lingering. With a flick of his sleeve, he strode southward, his pace as steady as a carriage.</p><p>Qin Sang watched Qingyuan depart, his emotions complex.</p><p>His attitude toward Qingyuan was contradictory.</p><p>He felt fortunate to encounter such a powerful being and should have sought guidance, yet he also harbored reservations, not daring to impose.</p><p>He couldn't take the other party's easygoing nature for granted.</p><p>When he traveled down the mountain, the low-ranking cultivators he encountered probably felt the same way.</p><p>Glancing around, Qin Sang mused that Cloud Metropolis Heaven and the Fallen Soul Abyss were likely unaware that a mysterious, powerful being had passed near their sect gates.</p><p>“What a carefree wandering immortal!”</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't help but sigh.</p><p>Of course, he knew clearly that all of this was predicated on Qingyuan's immense power.</p><p>Lost in thought, Qin Sang pondered for a long while before his divine sense touched the spiritual light, and a Daoist technique instantly imprinted itself into his mind.</p><p>Qin Sang sat down on the spot.  A full day and night passed before he slowly came to.</p><p>Summoning his escape light, he flew back to the Green Ram Temple. (End of Chapter)</p>
