<h1>Chapter 1270: Aftermath of the Battle</h1><p>Chapter 1270: Aftermath of the Battle</p><p>Ye Laomo, having personally refined the treasure banner, possessed a deep understanding of the array, surpassing even Jiang Chenzi and the others who wielded it.  He brought back the jade bone and personally oversaw the array, significantly increasing its power, allowing it to break free from the Nine Palaces Formation.</p><p>Xiang Qing's side had persevered remarkably.</p><p>Everyone generously contributed various magical treasures, barely managing to contain the treasure banner array.</p><p>By this point, they were nearing their limits.</p><p>Especially the four wielding talismans; only Xiang Qing, with her profound demonic cultivation, fared somewhat better.  Daoist Chongyi and his two disciples consumed multiple pills in rapid succession.</p><p>The tide turned.  Unable to maintain their defense, they could only watch as Ye Laomo led the treasure banner array toward the Blood Pool to rescue Tian Zheng Laoren.</p><p>They quickly gathered their array's power, following closely behind to assist Qin Sang and the others, preventing Ye Laomo from striking them down.</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>…</p><p>Several dull thuds echoed as the treasure banner array unleashed countless beams of bloodlight.  Despite their strength, the Ebony Sword, the Five Directions Pagoda, and other magical treasures were no match for the onslaught, being knocked away one after another.</p><p>The starlight giant dissipated, revealing the pale, weakened Tian Zheng Laoren. Several bloody patches marked where the starlight giant had been injured.</p><p>Without looking back, Tian Zheng Laoren plunged into the treasure banner array.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>The Ebony Sword returned, poised to strike Tian Zheng Laoren in the back.</p><p>Several beams of treasure light shot from the treasure banner array, forcing the Ebony Sword back.</p><p>Qin Sang sighed inwardly; Ye Laomo was too fast. Despite their best efforts, they still failed to kill Tian Zheng Laoren.</p><p>Tian Zheng Laoren's transformation into the starlight giant rendered him a near-immortal being of illusory starlight, invulnerable to many attacks.</p><p>Any injuries sustained would only affect his physical form after the secret technique dissipated.</p><p>Earlier, the demonic banner had been scattered by the aftermath of the Blood Demon's self-destruction. They hadn't had time to reform the banner array; otherwise, they might have had a chance!</p><p>The treasure banner array, having rescued Tian Zheng Laoren, turned and charged outwards.  Having obtained the jade bone, Ye Laomo and the others had no reason to linger.</p><p>“I thank you all for your contributions today. I will remember this, and repay you in due time!”</p><p>Ye Laomo's icy voice, filled with killing intent, echoed across the battlefield.</p><p>This was followed by the angry shouts of Jiang Chenzi and the others.</p><p>Despite having had the upper hand, something had gone wrong, leading to Ye Laomo's self-destruction and Tian Zheng Laoren's severe injuries.  He would need at least a decade of recuperation to regain his full strength; their anger was understandable.</p><p>Even worse, the jade bone was now lifeless, further infuriating them; their carefully laid plans might be completely ruined.</p><p>This battle proved a disastrous loss, potentially affecting the outcome of the Three Realms War!</p><p>Qing Jun and the others followed closely, flying into the Nine Palaces Formation.</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze met Jing Yu's; seeing Jing Yu nod slightly, Qin Sang felt a surge of joy.  Although they had missed the ancient cultivator's jade bone, acquiring the Corpse Flower Blood Jasper was a significant gain.</p><p>"Thank you, everyone,"</p><p>Xiang Qing released the Nine Palaces Formation, welcoming them inside.</p><p>Fatigue was evident on her face.</p><p>Daoist Chongyi and his disciples were barely managing to control the jade talismans. Xiang Qing alone bore the brunt of maintaining the array, shifting formations, and repelling enemy attacks, resulting in immense mental exhaustion.</p><p>“It’s a pity the jade bone fell into Ye Laomo’s hands.  I wonder what they’ll be able to glean from it,”</p><p>Daoist Chongyi sighed, his face etched with regret.</p><p>Facing an impending Heavenly Tribulation, he knew he couldn't survive it.  Having trained two Yuan Ying disciples, he was prepared to face death peacefully, but the news of the ancient cultivator had rekindled his hope and fighting spirit.  He pushed himself and his disciples to their limits, using pills to sustain the Nine Palaces Formation, but it was all in vain.</p><p>Lord Tongyou also felt regret but didn't voice his thoughts.</p><p>He had led the four who infiltrated the Blood Pool.</p><p>During the struggle for the jade bone, Tian Zheng Laoren had kept him at bay.</p><p>Tian Zheng Laoren was a peerless expert, and no one could blame him.</p><p>But compared to Qin Sang, who forced the Blood Demon's self-destruction, and Qing Jun, who faced Ye Laomo head-on, he felt inadequate and ashamed.</p><p>“Each generation has its own heroes…”</p><p>Lord Tongyou mused, glancing at Qing Jun and Qin Sang.</p><p>He and Qing Jun had known each other for over two hundred years. She had once successfully disguised herself as Leng Yuntian.  Though later exposed, she had somehow gained the Red-Haired Ancestor's tacit approval, her success following a clear pattern.</p><p>The young Qin was a meteoric rise.</p><p>Just a few decades ago, he was a mere Foundation Establishment cultivator. Now, even Lord Tongyou had to avoid his demonic fire; it was truly terrifying.</p><p>Throughout the history of Beichen, few have achieved such a feat.</p><p>“Dongyang Bo, hah!”</p><p>Tongyou Mojun recalled the scene at the Cang Heng Island meeting.  Even without knowing the full story, he could guess the gist.  Dongyang Bo, so cunning, had driven such a powerful individual from the sect.  Truly, a grave misjudgment.</p><p>“Continue the pursuit!”</p><p>Qing Jun took the jade talisman from Si Di, reassumed control of the formation, and said gravely.</p><p>Everyone nodded.</p><p>Ye Laomo lost an avatar; his own power would undoubtedly be affected, his energy depleted.  As for Tianzheng Laoren, he was practically incapacitated.  They still had a chance!</p><p>As for the treasures here, Zu Yuan could no longer contend with them; they would have ample time to explore later.</p><p>“Ming… uh… should I call you Mingyue Daoist friend or Qin Daoist friend?”</p><p>Chongyi Daochang, recovering from his despondency, handed the jade talisman to Qin Sang, his tone complex.</p><p>“I am Qin Sang.  Earlier, I had no choice but to use a secret technique to transform into a demonic form.  If I offended anyone, I beg your forgiveness.”</p><p>Qin Sang felt several subtle gazes upon him, scrutinizing and observing.  He raised his jade talisman, assisting his senior sister in activating the formation to pursue the enemy, while bowing and surveying the group, saying frankly.</p><p>“Not at all! Not at all!”</p><p>“Your methods are impressive, your disguise flawless.  I thought you were truly a demon king!”</p><p>“Though Daoist Friend Qin served among the demons, you never flinched, guarding the front lines, achieving great merit countless times. Who dares to say otherwise? I will not forgive them!”</p><p>“With Daoist Friends Tongyou, Leng, and Qin here, how could we not destroy Zu Yuan?”</p><p>“Our Xiao Han domain is destined for greatness!”</p><p>…</p><p>The crowd was cordial, returning his bows with courtesy.  At the thought of another great general joining Xiao Han domain, excitement and surprise shone in their eyes.  The situation in Beichen was unstable; Xiao Han’s prosperity and decline were intertwined.</p><p>Other matters could wait.</p><p>Xiang Qing chuckled wryly, “Daoist Friend Qin, you deceived me so thoroughly.”</p><p>Qin Sang quickly apologized, and they shared a smile.</p><p>As for Dongyang Bo and Shaohua Mountain, no one present mentioned them.</p><p>Qing Jun, Tongyou Mojun, Xiang Qing, and Qin Sang each held a jade talisman. Qing Jun directed the formation, pursuing Zu Yuan relentlessly, chasing them out of the Blood Pool, their forces clashing periodically.</p><p>Ye Laomo focused only on escaping, refusing to engage.</p><p>Soon, they reached the Blood Gate, following Ye Laomo as he broke through.  To their astonishment, they discovered a dramatic change outside the gate!</p>
