<h1>Chapter 898: Yuan Chen's Secret</h1><p>Dou Niu Peak!</p><p>Qin Sang's heart tightened at the mention of the name, his gaze fixed on the three individuals.  He never expected to encounter the main players during this visit to Dong Ming Island for the ceremony!</p><p>It seemed there was a deep-seated feud between the Dou Niu Peak lineage and the Lan Dou Sect, preventing the Dou Niu Peak cultivators from even returning to Lan Dou Island.  Was this the reason why the Lan Dou Sect remained so tight-lipped about Dou Niu Peak, making it impossible to find any information on their members?</p><p>Qin Sang's mind raced, but his expression remained unchanged.</p><p>Beside the burly man stood a leaner man of similar cultivation. A younger man stood behind them, head slightly bowed, maintaining a low profile.</p><p>Qin Sang swept his gaze across the three cultivators from Dou Niu Peak, a hint of suspicion in his eyes.  For some reason, the young man gave him a vague sense of familiarity, though he was certain they had never met.</p><p>Of course, Qin Sang didn't stare, suspecting it might be a mere illusion.  The spiritual perception of Nascent Soul cultivators was very sharp.</p><p>Standing inconspicuously at the back of the crowd, Qin Sang planned to find an opportunity to approach the three later, and thus avoided any actions that might cause misunderstanding.</p><p>Sect Leader Lu coldly said, “What item? What are you talking about? The Lan Dou Sect owes your Dou Niu Peak nothing!”</p><p>The burly man's eyes narrowed.  “Junior Brother Lu, don't play coy with me. That item was discovered by our ancestor; when did it become yours? Don't tell me you intend to reveal all your secrets in front of everyone here?”</p><p>“You…”</p><p>Sect Leader Lu's face changed.</p><p>Cultivators from other sects began to look at each other with suspicion. What item was he referring to? Was it some kind of unspeakable secret?</p><p>Ignoring Lu's anger, the burly man glanced around, his tone shifting to one of calm confidence.  “Junior Brother Lu, since we're fellow cultivators, surely you won't refuse us a drink here in the wilderness?”</p><p>Sect Leader Lu's expression shifted, finally he coldly snorted and flew towards the bamboo pavilion.</p><p>The burly man chuckled, pushed through the crowd, and swaggered after him.</p><p>Daoist Hua Yang and other Lan Dou Sect cultivators wore grave expressions, their eyes complex. Others had varied reactions, all deeply curious about the day's events.</p><p>Everyone hurriedly followed, and Qin Sang dared not lag behind.</p><p>Unexpectedly, upon entering Dong Ming Island, Sect Leader Lu paused slightly before the bamboo pavilion, turned, and bowed.  “Today's matter is an internal affair of the Lan Dou Sect; we cannot invite everyone inside. We hope for your understanding.”</p><p>With that, Sect Leader Lu activated the pavilion's restrictions, flashing inside.  Daoist Hua Yang and the others followed closely behind.</p><p>The Lan Dou Sect had sent a total of five Nascent Soul cultivators; the remaining three were slightly weaker than Daoist Hua Yang.  They could easily overpower the three from Dou Niu Peak.</p><p>But the burly man snorted coldly, unhesitatingly following into the pavilion.</p><p>Then, with a flash of green light, the restriction completely enveloped the bamboo pavilion, silencing all sound.</p><p>Everyone was shut out, unable to learn the Lan Dou Sect's secret, leaving them all disappointed.</p><p>Qin Sang was no exception.  He considered, now that it was clear Dou Niu Peak had broken with the Lan Dou Sect and was no longer on Lan Dou Island, whether he should recall his avatar.  Staying with the Lan Dou Sect might not yield any information and could even be dangerous.  Directly contacting the Dou Niu Peak cultivators might be safer.</p><p>However, the three did not seem easy to approach.</p><p>“What is Dou Niu Peak? I've never heard of it.  The Lan Dou Sect has a Dou Niu Peak lineage?  And they seem to be at odds with Sect Leader Lu?  Friend Hu, I saw you seemed to know something; could you enlighten me?”</p><p>Unable to enter the pavilion, the cultivators unwillingly gathered on a nearby bamboo platform to await developments.</p><p>A cultivator surnamed Qi couldn't contain his curiosity and asked someone next to him.</p><p>Cultivator Hu shook his head slightly. “I only know a little.  I once heard my master mention that besides the Five Elements and Yin-Yang lineages, the Lan Dou Sect had another very mysterious lineage. But he didn't know Dou Niu Peak's origins or their cultivation methods.  Does anyone else know anything?”</p><p>Cultivator Hu looked around.</p><p>Some shook their heads.</p><p>Others echoed, “I don't know much either. The Lan Dou Sect never publicly acknowledged a Dou Niu Peak lineage; you don't often come to the island, so it's understandable that you wouldn't know…”</p><p>…</p><p>Rumors swirled among the crowd.</p><p>Even sects closely related to the Lan Dou Sect, such as Yan Miao Pavilion, knew little about Dou Niu Peak, assuming the lineage had died out.</p><p>Only now did they learn that Dou Niu Peak still had surviving members, and that they had fallen out with the Lan Dou Sect and been expelled from Lan Dou Island.</p><p>Does anyone remember when, without warning, Lán Dòu Mountain was suddenly closed off, its protective array activated for months?  I had just reached the Foundation Establishment stage back then, so I remember it vividly.  The cultivators on the island were terrified, fearing a major attack.</p><p>A cultivator gasped, then added with growing alarm, “Shortly after that, another Yuan Ying master went into seclusion and hasn’t been seen since. Could it be…?”</p><p>“That was over a hundred years ago,” someone else mused, “It was certainly strange…”</p><p>More and more cultivators recalled the event, finding it increasingly suspicious.</p><p>Qin Sang listened to their discussion, her eyes flashing.</p><p>In the Bamboo Pavilion.</p><p>Fellow disciples faced each other in silence, the atmosphere heavy with tension.</p><p>Lu, the Headmaster, his expression calm, devoid of anger, broke the silence after a moment. “Senior Brother Gao, why are only three of you here? Where are Senior Brother Qi Yunzi and the others?”</p><p>“You haven’t forgotten Senior Brother Qi Yunzi? He certainly thought highly of you from a young age.”  The burly man softened slightly. “Don’t you know? Senior Brother Qi Yunzi was already nearing the end of his lifespan.  He was seriously injured during that incident and passed away shortly after leaving Lán Dòu Island. As for the other senior brothers, many are no longer with us, and others are too occupied suppressing the Star煞 to leave their secluded dwellings for long. The Dou Niu Peak lineage rests solely on my shoulders now.”</p><p>“Of course, I remember. Senior Brother Gao, Senior Brother Hong, you both guided me… And this is…?” Lu turned to the young man.</p><p>“This is Junior Brother Fang. Very talented; he reached the Golden Core stage at a young age.”  The burly man introduced.</p><p>“Greetings, Senior Brother Lu,” the young man politely bowed.</p><p>“He also cultivates the *Yuán Chén…* technique?” Lu looked at the young man, his brow furrowed.</p><p>“No,” the burly man shook his head. “We wouldn’t let our juniors repeat the same mistakes.”</p><p>Lu sighed slightly.  “Since Master Wu ultimately allowed you to leave Lán Dòu Sect, relieving you from practicing the *Yì Léi* technique, why do you continue to cultivate it? Why not switch to a different one?”</p><p>“Do you think the *Yì Léi* technique can be abandoned so easily? Lán Dòu Sect nurtured us to cultivate the *Yì Léi* technique, fully prepared to abandon us afterward.  Surely you know this?”</p><p>The burly man sneered.</p>
