**Chapter 285: The Wind Is Rising**

At this moment, the same cyan aura surrounded them from all sides. They had no idea where the exit was, so everyone focused on Yu Kong, hoping that his experience would help them quickly find a way to break the formation.

"The wind is rising."

Qin Sang, who had been observing his surroundings carefully, suddenly uttered these words.

Everyone was startled and followed Qin Sang's gaze. They saw that the cyan aura at their feet was indeed stirring.

Like a calm lake surface rippling under a gentle breeze, dark currents seemed to surge deep within the cyan aura. As the ripples spread, this change began to extend to other areas.

At this moment, everyone keenly felt delicate threads of wind brushing against their faces.

But then, the wind suddenly intensified.

In an instant, the tranquility was completely shattered.

A strong gust, a fierce gust, a storm...

The cyan aura danced in the wind, as if it were solidified wind. It condensed into wind orbs of different sizes before Qin Sang and the others.

Qin Sang and the others were immediately caught in the midst of countless wind orbs, truly experiencing the power of this cyan aura.

The cyan aura above them was light and ethereal, but it seemed to carry a scorching flame. The cyan aura below them surged, carrying the chill of an endless icy wind. The cyan aura in the middle was as sharp as a blade.

Everyone hurriedly activated their spiritual energy to protect their bodies and shattered the wind orbs nearby.

However, they soon found that the wind orbs in other places seemed to have eyes and were moving towards their location. As they approached, the wind orbs devoured each other, growing larger and more powerful.

Everyone could sense that shattering the wind orbs was becoming more difficult. If they continued like this and did not leave the formation soon, they would definitely be devoured by the wind orbs.

Thinking of this, everyone became extremely anxious, but they still could not find the exit.

Just then, Xiu Zhicui suddenly pointed forward and shouted excitedly, "Look there!"

The Xiu sisters had joined forces to resist the wind orbs, making things easier for them than for the others.

Everyone gazed in the direction she pointed and saw something strange. In the distant sky at the end of their vision, there was a deep wind cave standing tall. The cave was only now revealed because the cyan aura had gathered into orbs.

"That should be the exit."

Yu Kong pointed at the wind cave and gestured as if to leave. "Let's go!"

Elder Mu Teng's voice was cold. "Fellow Daoist Yu, the situation of the formation is constantly changing. Is it wise to rush over without first observing it carefully? What if this wind cave is a decoy or even a trap? Or what if we go through all the trouble to reach it, only to find that it has suddenly moved somewhere else? Wouldn't that be a waste of our effort?"

Everyone agreed with him, their faces filled with hesitation.

Seeing this, Yu Kong hurriedly explained.

"Everyone, don't worry. If someone were controlling this formation, it would indeed be as unpredictable as Fellow Daoist Mu Teng said. With our cultivation, we would definitely meet our deaths.

However, the master of the cave has passed away, and the formation is now unmanned. Moreover, it is currently at its weakest point, and its operation is sluggish. It won't exhibit such complex changes.

If the wind cave is the exit, it is impossible for it to move elsewhere in a short period. Even if the wind cave is a false exit, as long as we approach it, we should be able to quickly find the real exit.

The formation may be powerful, but after years of erosion, it is no longer a deathtrap. At least eight out of ten people who attempt to break the formation will be able to enter the cave safely. With so many of us here,

As long as we find the exit, escaping won't be difficult. If we hesitate, things will change, and it will only lead to chaos."

In the end, everyone chose to believe Yu Kong. They maintained the Primordial Return Formation and flew towards the wind cave.

Yu Kong activated a Qi Blade to clear the way. With his strong stance, he cleaved through the wind orbs blocking their path and headed directly for the wind cave. Their speed was quite fast.

As they drew closer to the wind cave, the wind orbs around them grew more numerous. Cyan aura, as solid as substance, slammed into them, colliding violently with their bodies. The power became increasingly terrifying.

Their figures trembled and struggled to move forward. At this moment, Yu Kong suddenly waved his hand, releasing the spiritual energy gathered in the formation's core. It transformed into a milky-white barrier, enveloping everyone within.

As the cyan aura struck the barrier, it created ripples, and the barrier shook violently, but it did not shatter.

With the barrier's protection, the pressure on everyone was greatly reduced, and they breathed a sigh of relief. But then they tensed up again because the fluctuations on the barrier were becoming increasingly violent, threatening to collapse.

Without Yu Kong's reminder, everyone knew what to do. They hurriedly poured all their spiritual energy into the formation's core, trying their best to maintain the barrier for as long as possible.

Without the Qi Blade to clear the way, their speed slowed down significantly. However, they were already quite close to the wind cave, and they were now certain that the wind cave was the exit.

Yu Kong did not lie to them. Before the low ebb ended, the great formation would not change much, and there was no sign of the wind cave shifting elsewhere.

Dawn was just ahead, and as long as they persisted a little longer, they could get out of the great formation!

Suddenly, Qin Sang felt that the wind group floating ahead seemed a little unusual, then he heard Yu Kong shout urgently, "Be careful!"

Before the voice fell, the huge wind force that was beating on the barrier suddenly disappeared.

The next moment, a very powerful suction force suddenly emitted from those wind groups!

This change came abruptly and without warning. The barrier was directly torn apart by the powerful suction force, and everyone was caught off guard, exposed outside.

Wu Chen, who was at the forefront, was directly **** out by a suction force, and the great formation collapsed without attacking.

Wu Chen reacted very quickly, hurriedly waving his treasure fan, and several sword lights broke through the fan, breaking free from the suction force. His body borrowed strength to penetrate a wind group, and he went straight for the wind cave without looking back.

Qin Sang had been prepared early on. Seeing this, he immediately transformed into sword light, cutting off the two suction forces that entangled him, and flying forward along the path opened up by Wu Chen.

For a while, everyone broke away from the great formation and fought separately.

At this time, Yan Wu at the edge of the Guiyuan Great Formation suddenly exclaimed, but this person reacted the slowest, and he failed to respond in time when the Guiyuan Great Formation collapsed. When he wanted to make a move, it was too late.

Unexpectedly, seven or eight wind groups came straight to him, surrounding him in a circle, and they were already close at hand, and an artifact was torn apart as soon as it was taken out.

Seeing that Yan Wu was about to be swallowed by the wind group.

At this time, everyone was doing their best to rush to the wind cave, taking care of themselves, and even if they had spare strength, they would not risk turning back to save Yan Wu.

Qin Sang wouldn't do it even more. In Xihua Town, Yan Wu provoked trouble, and Qin Sang used him to establish his prestige. After losing his face, Yan Wu hated Qin Sang.

In the past year, Yan Wu has never given Qin Sang a good face. The other people in the team could clearly see the contradiction between the two, and Qin Sang naturally would not go to a hot face with a cold butt.

Qin Sang had no doubt that if he was caught in the suction force instead, Yan Wu would not only not save him, but he would not hesitate to make trouble for him if he had the opportunity.

Unexpectedly, seeing that Yan Wu was about to be swallowed by the wind group, Yu Kong, the strongest and closest to the wind cave, suddenly stopped, waved his palm, and a crimson chain shot out from his palm.

The chain was as flexible as a snake, and when it was played and flicked, it fell to Yan Wu's body, and then burst into a dazzling light, helping Yan Wu block several suction forces.
