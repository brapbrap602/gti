<h1>Chapter 1176: Tianxing Plateau</h1><p>Ancient texts and the Wu Clan's unique insect-gu techniques corroborated each other.  Qin Sang, though unable to find information on the Sky-Eyed Butterfly, felt less lost than before, developing some ideas that would require further investigation.</p><p>“Even the Imperial Spirit Sect hasn't recorded it.  From now on, we'll have to rely on each other and find our way slowly,” he said.</p><p>Qin Sang turned, his gaze softening as he looked at the Sky-Eyed Butterfly. The butterfly, seeming to sense his thoughts, gently pressed its soft wings against his cheek, as if offering comfort.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Qin Sang returned the ancient text, bid farewell to the Imperial Spirit Sect's Vice-Sect Master, and headed south, arriving at Cang Heng Island in the Yun Cang Great Marsh.  Tan Yi'en, having received instructions, was already waiting.</p><p>On the island, Qin Sang contacted a large trading house, commissioning them to gather the spiritual herbs needed for the Fire Melting Pill formula.  He would specify which major city he wanted to fortify, and the herbs would be delivered there.</p><p>Serving the Demon King, the trading house was naturally delighted and offered very reasonable prices.  Simultaneously, Qin Sang purchased some materials. He still had a considerable number of high-grade demonic bones, which, combined with Golden Immersed Wood, would be used to refine flying swords.</p><p>Finding top-tier materials proved difficult for now.  However, Qin Sang wasn't aiming too high; a mid-grade spirit sword would suffice temporarily, leaving room for improvement later.</p><p>After a day of attending to various matters, Qin Sang and Tan Yi'en set off, crossing the Yun Cang Great Marsh to its southern bank.  This marked Qin Sang's first time setting foot in the Tianxing Alliance.</p><p>He moved swiftly, landing on a mountain on the shore, gazing southward.</p><p>The Yun Cang Great Marsh and the Yun Cang River to its west formed a natural barrier between the Small Cold Domain and the Tianxing Alliance.  Legend has it that the two regions were once inseparable, but a rift appeared at some point, and conflicts intensified until they ultimately resorted to war.</p><p>The Tianxing Alliance takes its name from the Tianxing Plateau.  South of the Yun Cang Great Marsh, the terrain rises sharply, revealing a vast plateau whose area is said to be as large as the Small Cold Domain and the Sky Demon Hill combined.  Records indicate that the summit of the Tianxing Plateau is the highest point in the entire Bei Chen Realm.</p><p>Compared to the Small Cold Domain, the Tianxing Plateau, while rugged and diverse in its terrain, is relatively monotonous, mostly consisting of high-altitude snowy mountains.  The worldly affairs differ greatly from those of the Small Cold Domain.</p><p>Because the Small Cold Domain lies between the Tianxing Plateau and the Ancient Immortal Battlefield, the Tianxing Alliance cultivators' northward path is blocked. High-level cultivators can still traverse, but low-level cultivators find it exceedingly difficult to reach the Ancient Immortal Battlefield.</p><p>South of the Tianxing Plateau stretches a boundless expanse of desert—the Bei Chen Great Desert, the namesake of the Bei Chen Realm. The desert's vastness makes up more than 80% of the Bei Chen Realm's territory.</p><p>Qin Sang had heard from Senior Sister Qing Jun that among the four Bei Chen Islands, the Bei Chen Island, despite not being the smallest, possesses the weakest overall cultivation strength – a direct consequence of its environment.</p><p>The desolate desert is thin in spiritual energy and poor in resources, making it unsuitable for both mortals and cultivators alike. Finding suitable caves for cultivation is exceptionally difficult.</p><p>Life is sparse in the vast desert, with settlements few and far between. Oases dot the landscape, supporting small, scattered forces, none of which are significant.</p><p>Within the Bei Chen Realm, the Bei Chen Great Desert is the most expansive, yet the vast majority of cultivators reside in the Small Cold Domain, the Tianxing Alliance, and the Abyss of Sin. These three powers are regarded as sacred lands by the desert cultivators, with the Small Cold Domain particularly advantageous due to its proximity to the Ancient Immortal Battlefield.</p><p>The Abyss of Sin is located to the southeast of the Tianxing Alliance, separated by a grassland that served as a buffer zone between them.  This grassland is said to be steadily eroding under the encroachment of the desert.</p><p>Now, the once-buffering grassland is completely under the Abyss of Sin's control.</p><p>The southern side of the Tianxing Plateau is gentler than the northern side, although the decrease in altitude is uneven; often, a flat stretch is followed by a cliff face.  The two largest drops are known as the two great southern steps of the Tianxing Plateau.</p><p>The Tianxing Alliance, holding a superior position, suffered consecutive defeats in the last war. The first step's pass has already fallen to the Abyss of Sin, which is steadily advancing, threatening to overrun the final defenses and leave the Tianxing Plateau undefended.</p><p>The Tianxing Alliance is an alliance formed by various forces on the Tianxing Plateau to resist enemies on both flanks, currently led by the Elder Zhen Yi.</p><p>Qin Sang summoned his phoenix wings, enveloping Tan Yi'en with his spiritual energy, and soared towards the summit of the Tianxing Plateau, also the location of the Tianxing Alliance's central city.  This was the highest peak Qin Sang had ever seen.</p><p>Night had fallen.</p><p>The sky was clear and cloudless, a pristine expanse.  </p><p>Myriad stars twinkled, forming a silver river that seemed within reach.</p><p>But even with Qin Sang's cultivation, he dared not easily enter the high-altitude wind belt.</p><p>Qin Sang gazed at the vast and profound sky, recalling the bold words he'd spoken to the Princess of Dongyang. After achieving Nascent Soul, he had journeyed through Da Sui and perfected the protective seals around the Princess's tomb.</p><p>Now, he was one of the world's top cultivators.</p><p>Yet, the higher his cultivation, the smaller he felt.</p><p>Nascent Soul, Divine Transformation, Void Refinement, Unity, Mahayana—then to transcend tribulation and ascend, becoming an immortal.</p><p>In this world, late-stage Nascent Soul was the strongest; Divine Transformation cultivators existed only in legends, and those above that were even more beyond comprehension.</p><p>Where did the path lie?</p><p>If the storm belt was a cage, might the path be beyond it?</p><p>"Thinking too much."</p><p>Qin Sang chuckled self-deprecatingly. Each subsequent bottleneck required his own efforts to overcome; whether he could break through the late-stage Nascent Soul was still unknown.</p><p>Finally, he saw the outline of Tianxing City.</p><p>Though far inferior to Tianxing City in the Canglang Sea, it was the most prominent city here.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't conceal his aura.  With a flap of his wings, he flew straight towards a city gate.</p><p>The guards at the gate spotted Qin Sang and a cultivator at the Nascent Soul stage quickly flew out, bowing respectfully. "Senior, are you the Bright Moon Demon King?"</p><p>They had clearly received news of the Demon King's arrival and easily recognized him.</p><p>"It is I."</p><p>Qin Sang retracted his wings, landing before the man and setting Tan Yi'en down.</p><p>"Elder Ji is waiting for you esteemed Demon Kings within the city. Please follow me, Senior…"</p><p>"Wait for me here."</p><p>Qin Sang instructed, then followed the cultivator into the city.  Moments later, they arrived at a palace, clearly a central location within the city, where he met Elder Ji of the Tianxing Alliance.</p><p>"I just heard from the Serpent King about the Bright Moon friend, and here you are."</p><p>Elder Ji, clad in a Daoist robe, was lean-faced, appearing to be around forty, and exceptionally warm towards Qin Sang.</p><p>"The Serpent King spoke very highly of the Bright Moon friend.  Only now do I understand. Another young prodigy from the Sky Demon Peak! With the Bright Moon friend's presence, Sandie Pass will surely be impregnable."</p><p>"Elder Ji, you flatter me.  The Serpent King must have exaggerated."</p><p>Qin Sang returned the bow. "So, you've decided to have me stationed at Sandie Pass?"</p><p>******</p>
