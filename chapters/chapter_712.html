<h1>Chapter 704: Chaos Within</h1><p>The cavern was eerily silent.</p><p>In such an environment, everyone subconsciously felt tense.</p><p>Qin Sang was pondering the reason for the Nine Nether Devilfire's unusual activity. Was there some kind of powerful spiritual fire hidden within the cave, or was it triggered by this strange cold mist?</p><p>The cavern wasn't as deep as he'd imagined. Lost in thought, Qin Sang noticed the stout cultivator at the front had stopped and whispered, "The cave entrance is just ahead."</p><p>Qin Sang then realized the stone steps had come to an end, opening onto a flat stone floor.</p><p>The space here seemed vast, but the dense cold mist severely limited visibility, obscuring everything and even restricting his divine sense.</p><p>Qin Sang and the others hurried forward, finally making out the shadow of a black stone wall.  A perfectly circular opening was visible in the wall, covered by a black barrier of light.</p><p>The light barrier was thin, allowing them a glimpse of a small stone chamber beyond.  The furnishings were simple, and on the nearest wall was a shelf, now empty, suggesting the stout cultivator had already taken the treasures.</p><p>One by one, the group examined the restriction at the entrance, finding it incredibly intricate.  Its former power must have been immense to have survived the corrosive effects of the cold mist.</p><p>"Breaking this restriction isn't difficult," the stout cultivator said. "I've already been inside.  Breaking it on my own would consume too much energy, but with the seven of us working together, it'll be much easier. However, we must be careful not to destroy the restriction.  These restrictions work together to seal the cold mist.  There are hordes of demonic beasts nearby, and if the mist escapes the cavern, the resulting phenomenon could easily attract powerful demons..."</p><p>Everyone listened patiently as the stout cultivator explained how to break the restriction.</p><p>Just then, a female cultivator glanced back and asked, "Fellow Daoist Fan, where does the cold mist originate? What's on the other side of this space? Are there any other caves? Have you checked?"</p><p>The stout cultivator paused, then looked towards the depths of the mist. "That's not a stone wall, but a sheer cliff face. There's a deep chasm there, incredibly deep, unknown, and mysterious. The mist fills the chasm and seems to emanate from its depths."</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Fan, have you ventured down? What exactly is in the chasm that could produce such strange cold mist?" Qin Sang asked.</p><p>He suspected that if there was spiritual fire, it might be within the chasm, and the mist might be related to it.  If the mist was a byproduct of the spiritual fire's power, it would surely carry the fire's unique aura, which would explain the Nine Nether Devilfire's reaction.</p><p>Qin Sang was usually a man of few words, rarely speaking.</p><p>The stout cultivator looked at Qin Sang with some surprise and nodded. "I descended along the cliff face into the chasm, but it seemed bottomless. Apart from the mist, there was nothing. After descending a certain distance, I suddenly felt an inexplicable fear and didn't dare continue. I returned to focus on breaking the cave restriction. Later, I discovered so many treasures within the cave.  If we can open the third layer of the restriction, the rewards will be unimaginable. Why risk exploring the unknown?"</p><p>The stout cultivator's words were those of a seasoned veteran.  The others walked over and indeed saw a bottomless chasm.  Considering their own situations, they realized they would have made the same choice.</p><p>Transformed beast hide, Sun-Piercing Talismans…</p><p>Any one of these items would secure their cultivation in the Core Formation stage, let alone several.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Fan, you mentioned the third layer of the restriction is extremely strong and difficult, likely requiring a long time. I fear I won't be able to withstand the cold mist for that long. We shouldn't delay, let's break the restriction quickly," the scholar in blue said gravely.</p><p>The stout cultivator's expression turned serious, and he nodded slightly. "Then do as I say and attack this point on the restriction together.  Using brute force will trigger a backlash, but it won't be too powerful.  Don't be afraid. When a crack appears in the barrier, rush in as quickly as possible..."</p><p>After confirming everyone had memorized the key points, the stout cultivator waved his hand.  The group fanned out around him and sat down.</p><p>The stout cultivator flicked his fingers, shooting out seven black bone spikes.</p><p>*Thud, thud, thud…*</p><p>The spikes landed on the light barrier, one in the center and the other six surrounding it.</p><p>These spikes were refined from some kind of beast bone.</p><p>Qin Sang, having some knowledge of restriction formations, realized the spikes were likely specialized tools for breaking restrictions.  As for their power, it was still unclear.</p><p>Deploying the spikes seemed to have taken a toll on the stout cultivator.  He took a few breaths before saying, "Fellow Daoists, choose a spike and channel your true essence into it. Then follow my instructions."</p><p>The stout cultivator aimed at the central spike, and Qin Sang casually chose one and channeled his true essence into it.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the seemingly unremarkable spike absorbed the influx of true essence without any sign of strain.  As more and more true essence flowed in, a phantom image appeared on the spike, growing larger and larger.</p><p>Following the stout cultivator's commands, everyone carried out their tasks meticulously.  Soon, these phantoms merged into one, forming a giant spike phantom, perfectly aligned with the center of the light barrier.</p><p>"Go!"</p><p>The stout cultivator's face flushed red as he let out a strained yell.</p><p>The spike phantom trembled abruptly and slammed into the light barrier.</p><p>The next moment, a loud bang echoed through the cavern, shaking the ground. So close to the light barrier, the group was deafened by the resounding boom.</p><p>Then, a startling scene unfolded.  A crack appeared in the center of the light barrier, running from top to bottom.  Two ripples, like waves of water, spread out, and a burst of black light erupted from the barrier.</p><p>Everyone's faces changed as they dodged hastily. Qin Sang retreated without hesitation.  The black light tore through the cold mist like a hot knife through butter, scattering the group and creating chaos.</p><p>Just then, the stout cultivator's anxious shouts came from ahead, "Don't panic! The restriction is broken! Follow me inside!"</p><p>Qin Sang realized he had retreated too far. After the initial shock, he now sensed that while the black light seemed powerful, it wasn't particularly aggressive.</p><p>He quickly stopped, pushed off the ground, and charged towards the light barrier, quickly returning to the front.</p><p>At that moment, a graceful figure flashed past Qin Sang, seemingly one of the female cultivators.  He could vaguely see several figures within the stone chamber beyond; it seemed the others had already entered.</p><p>Seeing her pass through the light barrier safely, and with the crack rapidly closing, Qin Sang didn't hesitate. He was about to enter when he abruptly stopped.</p><p>A strange look flashed in his eyes as he retreated instead of advancing.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Qin, what are you waiting for? The restriction is about to restore itself. Why aren't you coming in?"</p><p>The voice of the wiry old man suddenly rang out from behind him.</p>
