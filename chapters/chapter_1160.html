<h1>Chapter 1152:  Visitors from the Past</h1><p>After a short while, the various demons arrived.</p><p>What surprised Qin Sang most were Fat Chicken and White Crane. In just a few months, the two had become extremely close, arm in arm, looking quite roguish.</p><p>“Master!”</p><p>White Crane landed, shaking its feathers with a flamboyant air, and grinned at Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang paused, glancing at Fat Chicken.</p><p>“My brother!”</p><p>Fat Chicken spread its wings, embracing White Crane, in a show of loyalty.</p><p>Qin Sang thought to himself,  “It’s that kid, alright.”</p><p>Yun Youzi’s Imperial Dew had already been destroyed in the Heavenly Tribulation.</p><p>It wasn’t surprising that Fat Chicken, whose mother was a shapeshifting demon, possessed Imperial Dew.</p><p>However, even shapeshifting demons were reluctant to use too much Imperial Dew to enlighten lesser demons, yet Fat Chicken had readily used it on White Crane, whom he’d only recently met.</p><p>These two birds, gluttonous and lecherous, were truly a match made in heaven!</p><p>“When you look for a partner, absolutely avoid descendants of the Phoenix clan,”</p><p>Qin Sang sincerely warned Fat Chicken, his words carrying a deep meaning.</p><p>Fat Chicken was taken aback, not understanding.</p><p>White Crane rolled its eyes, turning to embrace Fat Chicken, declaring righteously,  “A brother's wife is not to be trifled with!”</p><p>…</p><p>Qin Sang didn’t have time to deal with the two birds for now. If they dared to cause him trouble in the future, he would certainly discipline them properly.</p><p>Now, the Hun Yuan Tong Xin Ring and White Crane were no longer of much use to Qin Sang. He decided to release White Crane from its restraints and let it remain in the Thousand Mountains Bamboo Sea.</p><p>“Daoist Friend Liu, nothing major has happened recently, has it?”</p><p>Qin Sang turned to the willow tree spirit and asked.</p><p>The willow tree spirit said with a heavy tone, “There have been several skirmishes at the front lines. It’s said that the momentum of the Abyss of Sin has slowed down again, creating a situation of uncertainty and deception. Old Monkey King has personally led his men to join forces with the Immortal Demon City and other demon kings' subordinates on the distant battlefield. Apart from that, the Feather Demon King hasn't issued any new orders.”</p><p>“They left already?”</p><p>Qin Sang frowned, knowing he couldn’t stop this.</p><p>To minimize casualties, the best way was to crush the Abyss of Sin's ambitions.</p><p>“Don't worry, I’ve decided to attempt a breakthrough to the Yuan Ying stage. After the breakthrough, I will personally go to the battlefield.”</p><p>As soon as he said this, the demons were in an uproar.</p><p>“I'll go and activate the great formation…”</p><p>Before the willow tree spirit could finish, Qin Sang stopped him.</p><p>“Human and demon races face different Heavenly Tribulations. I cannot undergo the tribulation in the Thousand Mountains Bamboo Sea. The Yun Cang Great Swamp is the best option. Although I'm quite confident, just in case, there are some things I need to arrange beforehand.”</p><p>Qin Sang said in a deep voice.</p><p>He valued the Thousand Mountains Bamboo Sea and the demons so much because of Yun Youzi’s last words.</p><p>Hearing this, the demons looked grave.</p><p>Looking around, Qin Sang issued a series of orders.</p><p>“Daoist Friend Liu, Xiaobai, if I fail in the tribulation and fail to live up to the senior’s entrustment, you cannot continue to stay in the Thousand Mountains Bamboo Sea. Retreat to the Ice Sea as soon as possible, and stay hidden as long as you can.”</p><p>“White Crane, I set you free, but you must assist Daoist Friend Liu and Xiaobai until they are safe.”</p><p>“Fat Chicken, we’re old acquaintances. I know your background. If I die in the Heavenly Tribulation, the previous conditions will be considered null and void, and I won’t force you to stay. But you must promise me one thing: If Daoist Friend Liu and the others encounter danger, you must go to your mother for help and ask her to intervene once.”</p><p>Fat Chicken chuckled, “Master, you’re too cautious. You’re already daring enough to challenge the Qieji Demon King; a mere Heavenly Tribulation should be a piece of cake, right?”</p><p>The willow tree spirit and White Cat were not so optimistic.</p><p>They had been traumatized by Yun Youzi’s two failed attempts at transcending the tribulation.</p><p>White Cat's eyes were full of worry, timidly saying, “Qin Gongzi, can I go to Yun Cang Great Swamp with you to protect you?”</p><p>Qin Sang didn’t refuse. After some thought, he said, “Alright. Fat Chicken, White Crane, you two come with me too. I still have a few junior disciples in the human realm. You can get to know them. Daoist Friend Liu, you stay…”</p><p>…</p><p>After making the arrangements, Qin Sang and the three demons set off to return to the human realm.</p><p>This time, Qin Sang traveled at top speed, crossing mountain ranges and heading straight for the Great Sui Dynasty.</p><p>All three were there.</p><p>Bai Hanqiu was in seclusion, striving to break through the Foundation Establishment bottleneck.</p><p>Li Yu Fu, after extensive travels, had finally gained some insights and returned to his cave abode.</p><p>Tan Yi En’s cultivation had also greatly improved.</p><p>Upon Qin Sang's return, the three immediately emerged to greet him.</p><p>Qin Sang introduced the three demons to them, checked their cultivation, gave some pointers, bestowed some treasures, and then explained his plan.</p><p>The three were stunned, feeling both joy and sorrow.</p><p>Qin Sang stated clearly that if he failed in the tribulation, he would entrust Tan Yi En and Bai Hanqiu to Li Yu Fu, who would later join the Green Sheep Temple.</p><p>He didn’t stay long.</p><p>A few days later, everyone traveled to Yun Cang Marsh, Li Yu Fu accompanying them.  Qin Sang made a trip to Cang Heng Island, while the others fanned out to search.  They soon found a suitable island for his tribulation.</p><p>"Such a large gathering!  All these people protecting me," Qin Sang exclaimed, standing with Bai on a mountain on the island.</p><p>Bai chuckled, "You're so cautious, Qin Sang.  Others may not know your true strength, but I do.  You've made everyone worry needlessly!"</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head, remaining silent.  His secret past was something Bai couldn't possibly know.  Yun You Zi was an exception; he wasn't normal either. Though Qin Sang didn't believe he'd face a dual-element tribulation, even with boundless confidence, his nature compelled him to prepare for any eventuality.</p><p>"Thank you, everyone," Qin Sang said, bowing.</p><p>Bai nodded and led the others away from the island, taking up positions on the perimeter.</p><p>Qin Sang first set up a protective array around the mountain peak, then took out twelve demonic banners and planted them in the ground.  This twelve-banner array was one of his mainstays for the tribulation.  Next, he meticulously organized his pills and artifacts, making sure they were readily accessible.</p><p>With his external preparations complete, Qin Sang took out a Transcendence Pill and examined it closely.</p><p>"Senior..." After a long moment, Qin Sang sighed softly, almost inaudibly.  He didn't rush to take the pill, instead slowly closing his eyes.</p><p>Back in the Thousand Mountain Bamboo Sea, he’d wondered whether the Four-Change Spirit Insect or the fourth level of body refinement was more important. He’d successfully sensed a glimmer of opportunity for a breakthrough—a precious chance to use the pill and break through his bottleneck.</p><p>Everything was ready.  He just needed to proceed.</p><p>After some contemplation, Qin Sang decided to wait no longer.  His mind calmed, he adjusted himself, meticulously reviewing his cultivation techniques from the beginning, again and again.</p><p>Three days passed. Qin Sang's dantian was full of True Qi, his blood brimming with energy.  He had pushed his physical and spiritual state to their peak.  Still, this wasn't enough.  He held back.</p><p>His thoughts drifted, recalling his past, returning to his birthplace.  Scenes from his memories surfaced—the faces of his loved ones, their smiles.  It had all been more than two hundred years ago, and even with his cultivation, these memories were beginning to fade.</p><p>"All are but passing visitors..."  Qin Sang recalled his senior sister Qing Jun's words.</p><p>Having entered the path of cultivation, Qin Sang had long understood this.  He remained unmoved, continuing to refine his understanding of cultivation – this was what truly mattered.</p><p>******</p>
