<h1>Chapter 163: The Grey Qi Finally Appears</h1><p>“This is…”</p><p>Descending the steps, Ning Wu Hui waved her hand.</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly felt a strange, chilling power penetrate him to the bone. He couldn't help but shiver, quickly circulating his true essence to dispel the cold.</p><p>At his current cultivation level, he rarely encountered such a thing.</p><p>Rounding a corner of the cliff face, a look of surprise flashed across Qin Sang's eyes.</p><p>They were standing on a wide earthen platform at the edge of the cliff.  Before them lay a deep, dark valley.</p><p>Immortal-restricting light filled the air above, completely sealing the valley within.</p><p>The valley was exceptionally long and narrow, giving the impression that it wasn't naturally formed. As a sword cultivator, Qin Sang suspected it had been cleaved by a single sword strike.</p><p>This was somewhat alarming.</p><p>Mount Yitian clearly had a significant history, possibly being an ancient forbidden ground. Who would dare to carve a valley here?</p><p>The valley was bottomless, filled with a dense black fog. The chilling aura he felt earlier originated from this fog.</p><p>“What kind of energy is this, so cold?”</p><p>He realized that if he allowed this energy to enter his body, it could actually corrode his flesh.</p><p>“This is called the Nether Valley,” Ning Wu Hui said, her gaze fixed on the valley’s depths.</p><p>“Nether Valley? Could it be the legendary Nether Qi…”</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly understood. Nether Qi was one of the strange energies born between heaven and earth recorded in ancient texts. It had nothing to do with the *Nether Scripture* he cultivated during the Qi Refining stage.</p><p>“Senior Qing Zhu’s command was for you to come to the Nether Valley?”</p><p>“To retrieve something here, and then wait for him in another place…”</p><p>Ning Wu Hui glanced at the stone walls on either side, walked to the edge of the platform, sat down cross-legged, and set up a protective spiritual formation around herself. Then, her External Nascent Soul leaped out from the top of her head, cradling a crimson-gold spiritual sword.</p><p>“Be careful. I sense something unusual in the depths of the Nether Valley. There might be ancient restrictions…” Qin Sang couldn’t help but warn.</p><p>No wonder Senior Qing Zhu wanted Ning Wu Hui to cultivate an External Nascent Soul.</p><p>Even standing here, he could sense that the Nether Valley was not a benign place. It was extremely dangerous, and even with his strength, he wouldn't dare to venture into the valley easily.</p><p>Ning Wu Hui’s Nascent Soul nodded at Qin Sang and flew into the Nether Valley with a ‘whoosh’.</p><p>The Nether Qi churned, and strange, shadowy figures flickered within, bizarre and unsettling.</p><p>Ning Wu Hui sat motionless, focusing all her energy on controlling her External Nascent Soul.</p><p>“There might be some treasure inside that can help Senior Qing Zhu suppress his demonic soul…” Qin Sang vaguely guessed at Senior Qing Zhu’s plan.</p><p>If Ning Wu Hui could successfully retrieve the treasure, Senior Qing Zhu could recover, and the ancient teleportation formation would be within reach.</p><p>The Nether Qi roiled, and his Heavenly Eye could not see what was happening inside. He didn't know what Ning Wu Hui would encounter or what she would retrieve.</p><p>Unable to help, Qin Sang could only stand by patiently and wait.</p><p>Suddenly, Ning Wu Hui’s physical body trembled, blood trickled from the corner of her mouth, and the spiritual formation flickered.</p><p>Qin Sang was startled. After confirming that Ning Wu Hui’s physical body was otherwise unharmed, he relaxed slightly, but his heart was still in his throat.</p><p>Ning Wu Hui’s success or failure not only concerned Senior Qing Zhu but also his own chances of returning to the Xiao Han Realm.</p><p>Just then, the Nether Qi began to violently shake. A fierce wind swept through the narrow valley, and the Nether Qi surged out, rushing towards the platform where they stood.</p><p>Qin Sang flashed in front of Ning Wu Hui’s physical body, using all his strength to resist the Nether Qi, trying to help even a little.</p><p>‘Rumble…’</p><p>Deafening booms echoed continuously.</p><p>The entire valley began to shake, but the immortal restrictions above remained undisturbed.</p><p>“If we were at the foot of the mountain, such a commotion would have attracted Nascent Soul ancestors.  Fortunately, we are within the immortal restrictions.  I wonder if the tremors will affect those below…” Qin Sang thought with alarm, understanding that this was caused by the External Nascent Soul breaking through the restrictions.</p><p>This chaos lasted for a full incense stick’s worth of time before subsiding.  The Nether Valley gradually calmed, but the External Nascent Soul still hadn’t emerged, and the physical body remained motionless.</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang couldn’t help but feel apprehensive.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>Finally, there was movement from the depths of the Nether Valley.  A streak of light shot out from the Nether Qi, flashing and flying to the platform above. It was the External Nascent Soul.</p><p>He didn't know what it had experienced down there.</p><p>After the round trip, the External Nascent Soul’s aura was greatly diminished, much weaker than before.</p><p>The crimson-gold spiritual sword circled the External Nascent Soul, its light dimmed and its movements sluggish. Even her natal spiritual sword had been damaged.</p><p>“Are you…” Qin Sang started to ask, but then noticed something clutched in the External Nascent Soul’s small hand.</p><p>The External Nascent Soul flew to the top of its physical body, placed the object in its hand, and then returned inside.</p><p>Ning Wu Hui slowly opened her eyes, exhaustion and a hint of excitement evident in her gaze.</p><p>Now, Qin Sang saw the object clearly.</p><p>Surprisingly, it wasn't some precious treasure, but an irregular metal shard, seemingly a fragment of something. One edge shimmered with a cold light, incredibly sharp, like a sword’s edge.</p><p>The shard showed no signs of decay, despite having existed there for who knows how long.</p><p>On its surface was an incomplete ancient character.</p><p>“This is…”  Qin Sang stared at the ancient character, his heart jolting. “It’s part of the character ‘kill’!”</p><p>“The Nether Valley was indeed difficult to traverse, but thankfully I had the External Nascent Soul! I’ve expended too much energy and need to meditate for a while to recover my strength. Please wait a moment…”</p><p>Ning Wu Hui quickly swallowed a few spirit pills. Just as she was about to put away the shard and refine the pills, she noticed Qin Sang still staring at it.</p><p>“Do you recognize this?” Ning Wu Hui asked in surprise.</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head. After a moment of hesitation, he asked, “This ‘kill’ character looks familiar. Could you let me touch it? I can't tell from its appearance, but direct contact might allow me to sense something…”</p><p>Ning Wu Hui readily agreed but didn’t hand it over directly.</p><p>She held the shard between her fingers. Qin Sang extended his hand, channeled a wisp of true essence, lightly touched it, and then immediately withdrew, frowning in thought for a moment before shaking his head helplessly.</p><p>“It’s not the divine sword I saw in the ancient texts…”</p><p>Ning Wu Hui didn’t suspect anything and put the shard away, closing her eyes to meditate.</p><p>Unbeknownst to her, a storm was raging in Qin Sang’s heart.</p><p>Just now, when the External Nascent Soul flew over with the shard, the grey qi that had been hidden deep within his dantian actually trembled slightly!</p><p>After awakening in the Shaman God Continent, Qin Sang had first discovered the grey qi in his dantian but had yet to understand its nature.</p><p>Later, as his cultivation continuously broke through, the grey qi remained inactive, and he couldn't expel it from his body.</p><p>Helpless against the grey qi, Qin Sang had stopped paying attention to it after seeing that it didn't seem to affect him, guessing that there might be a change after he reached the Nascent Soul stage.</p><p>This was the first time the grey qi had shown any unusual activity, and it was triggered by the shard!</p><p>Just now, when Qin Sang tried to touch the shard, the grey qi seemed to feel an immense attraction, wanting to leave his dantian and merge with the shard.</p><p>Qin Sang quickly withdrew his hand, preventing his secret from being exposed.</p>
