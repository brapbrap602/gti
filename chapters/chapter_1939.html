<h1>Chapter 1930 The Third Thunder Altar</h1><p>A certain mountain forest in Mulu Mountain.</p><p>Several streaks of light approached from the west, circled briefly in the air, and landed on the ground, revealing several figures in red robes.</p><p>“Junior Brother Tu’s aura disappeared somewhere nearby,” a woman’s alluring voice said from the center of the group.</p><p>Her hand was as translucent as jade, unlike ordinary human flesh. She held a blood-red jade pendant.</p><p>Within the pendant, a wisp of greyish-white energy, about the thickness of a little finger, was sealed.</p><p>At this moment, the pendant was covered with cracks, and the greyish-white energy was dissipating.</p><p>The woman and a red-robed man beside her stood in place, sensing something with the jade pendant.</p><p>The others spontaneously dispersed, quickly searching a radius of a thousand li, and reported back, “No signs of pursuit or combat.”</p><p>The woman made a sound of acknowledgement.  “So, Junior Brother Tu was captured alive and brought here to be silenced.  Ling Shi’s lair and the Eight-Formation Toxic Swamp were completely destroyed, but we don’t know if this happened after he subdued Ling Shi, or if Ling Shi had some powerful hidden method.”</p><p>“If he could even fail against that old poisonous thing Ling Shi, Junior Brother Tu is simply incompetent!”</p><p>The red-robed man beside her snorted disdainfully. “No matter how incompetent Junior Brother Tu is, he was still taught by the Master. Ling Shi only has the ability to protect himself; he could never capture Junior Brother Tu alive! Ling Shi is solitary and never deliberately befriends powerful figures.  Perhaps it was another force that took advantage of the chaos, possibly an enemy intentionally targeting our Falling Soul Abyss.”</p><p>“Another force?”</p><p>The woman frowned thoughtfully.</p><p>In all of Mulu Mountain, there were few who could defeat Tu Yuan and dare to offend the Falling Soul Abyss.</p><p>At that moment, a sharp tearing sound came from the distance, and a red-robed cultivator shouted urgently.</p><p>“Not good! Something happened to the Sky-Blue Sand vein! All the Sky-Blue Sand has been mined out!”</p><p>‘Snap!’</p><p>The woman crushed the jade pendant in her hand and said coldly, “Ling Shi might still be alive!”</p><p>The man beside her remained quite calm. “If I were Ling Shi, I would have already fled far away; it would be difficult to find me.  Now, completing the Master's task before his seclusion is the top priority. Fortunately, Junior Brother Tu didn't know many secrets and couldn't reveal much. However, we need to be more careful in our future actions to avoid repeating the same mistake.”</p><p>The group searched again for a long time, still unable to find any trace, and could only leave reluctantly.</p><p>……</p><p>At this moment.</p><p>Qin Sang was already on his way back.</p><p>After interrogating Tu Yuan, he learned some information about the Falling Soul Abyss.</p><p>The ancestor of the Falling Soul Abyss, Tu Yuan’s master, was known as the冥鹘老祖 (Minghu Ancestor), the only Nascent Soul cultivator in the Falling Soul Abyss.</p><p>Qin Sang was curious about Minghu Ancestor’s cultivation level, whether he had reached the mid-Nascent Soul stage or even higher.</p><p>Nascent Soul cultivators are elusive, and only some ambiguous rumors exist about them in the outside world.</p><p>Unfortunately, Tu Yuan’s status wasn't high enough. In his eyes, his Master's cultivation was unfathomable, and his Master had been in seclusion deep within the Falling Soul Abyss for many years, he had never seen his Master make a full effort.</p><p>This also shows that Yun Du Tian was very wary of Minghu Ancestor, and the two sides kept to themselves.</p><p>Subduing Ling Shi was indeed an order from Minghu Ancestor, but it was passed on by other senior brothers. Tu Yuan was only the executor and didn't know the purpose of subduing Ling Shi.</p><p>Ling Shi himself was also clueless.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't intend to investigate further. This trip was a complete success; he not only found the main culprit but also brought the person back.</p><p>Ling Shi followed Qin Sang to the dojo located in the Fire Domain and couldn’t help but marvel.</p><p>He wondered how the Falling Soul Abyss and Yun Du Tian cultivators would react upon learning that a mysterious strong cultivator was hidden here.</p><p>“Master, you’re back.”</p><p>Gui Hou respectfully greeted Qin Sang, then looked at Ling Shi with a wary eye.</p><p>“This is Daoist Friend Ling Shi. Arrange a cave dwelling for him; he will cultivate in the dojo from now on,” Qin Sang said, turning to Ling Shi, “How long will it take to refine the Sky-Blue Sand?”</p><p>Sky-Blue Sand is a special spiritual object. After being refined by Ling Shi's poisonous technique, it can produce a powerful poison and can also be used with other spiritual objects to enhance their toxicity.</p><p>Let Ling Shi refine it first. If direct refining can meet the requirements, there’s no need for further trouble.</p><p>He directly emptied a vein, and there should be enough Sky-Blue Sand.</p><p>“Junior has not been in contact with Sky-Blue Sand for many years. After a short rest, I will immediately begin refining,” Ling Shi, having witnessed Qin Sang's formidable strength, was already convinced and addressed him respectfully.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded and flew towards his cave dwelling.</p><p>Gui Hou welcomed Ling Shi, saying, "Fellow Daoist Ling Shi, I am Gui Hou.  There's plenty of space in the mountains. Please choose a comfortable spot, but not too close to the summit. We wouldn't want to disturb the Master's seclusion. Please, follow me." Gui Hou gestured and flew towards the foot of the mountain.</p><p>"Thank you, Daoist Gui," Ling Shi replied, bowing and following.</p><p>Qin Sang, unconcerned with Ling Shi's arrangements, returned to his cave dwelling to continue his seclusion.  He followed his planned regimen: studying the sword formation, sword domain, and the Azure Bird Dharma Aspect.</p><p>Creating a sword formation and understanding the sword domain were immense challenges for Qin Sang.  The sword domain, in particular, was not something a Nascent Soul cultivator should attempt.  Only with the help of the *Ziwei Sword Scripture* and the Tianyue Sword Light did Qin Sang have a chance to glimpse its secrets.</p><p>By contrast, comprehending the Azure Bird Dharma Aspect was much easier, and his progress was most significant.</p><p>After settling in, Ling Shi spent three months in seclusion refining pills. He then emerged, arriving at the summit and carefully activating the cave dwelling's restrictions.</p><p>"Enter."</p><p>A crack appeared in the stone door.</p><p>Ling Shi adjusted his robes, entered the cave, and presented Qin Sang with a jade bottle. "This is the Tianqing Powder I have refined, Daoist, please examine it."</p><p>The jade bottle contained half a bottle of light green powder.  The primary ingredient was Tianqing sand, hence the name.</p><p>"I have always been fascinated by Tianqing sand," Ling Shi explained, "and over the years, I've accumulated some spiritual herbs. I've added some to the Tianqing Powder…"</p><p>Ling Shi carefully explained the medicinal properties to Qin Sang, who then unsealed the bottle, poured out half the Tianqing Powder, sniffed it lightly, and without any protective measures, swallowed it.</p><p>This left Ling Shi speechless.  Even with his profound knowledge of poisons, he wouldn't dare ingest Tianqing Powder so casually.</p><p>After consuming the Tianqing Powder, Qin Sang sat motionless.  His qi and blood began to churn violently.  Without the poison pearl, suppressing the poison was much harder, but Qin Sang's cultivation was far superior now. He could suppress the poison with his potent true essence.  The Tianqing Powder's toxicity was not overwhelming, and the Poison God Scripture he obtained only covered the pre-Nascent Soul stages, offering minimal true essence enhancement.  However, for body refinement alone, it was still much faster than normal cultivation.</p><p>Because his understanding of the Azure Bird Dharma Aspect surpassed his progress in the cultivation technique, Qin Sang's cultivation was exceptionally smooth, without any bottlenecks.</p><p>After a while, Qin Sang expelled a breath of turbid air and praised, "Excellent!"</p><p>The Tianqing Powder's toxicity would be enough to support his cultivation for some time.</p><p>Qin Sang estimated that the Tianqing Powder alone wasn't sufficient to cultivate the *Sky Demon Transformation* to its fifth-layer peak.  He instructed Ling Shi not to be negligent, promising to gather other spiritual herbs to enhance the Tianqing Powder's toxicity.</p><p>Ling Shi readily agreed and took his leave, returning to refine more Tianqing sand.</p><p>In the days that followed, Qin Sang periodically received Tianqing Powder from Ling Shi, continuing his cultivation cycle.</p><p>…</p><p>The Fire Domain.</p><p>A certain lava river.</p><p>Three figures were walking along the riverbed.</p><p>They walked on the riverbed, amidst the flowing lava, yet their pace was incredibly swift, faster than galloping horses—faster than flying.</p><p>All three wore red cloaks; they were the same individuals who had resonated with Qin Sang's initial activation of the bronze pillar.</p><p>Their leader was known as Lord Feiluo.</p><p>Two hundred years had passed, and they were still searching relentlessly in the Fire Domain.</p><p>For some reason, however, their original group of four had dwindled to three: Lord Feiluo, the alluring woman, and the tall man.</p><p>They continued their silent journey through the lava.</p><p>"Wait!"</p><p>The alluring woman suddenly spoke.</p><p>Lord Feiluo, at the head of the group, stopped and turned back.  "Lord Feiluo," she said, "six hundred li further and we reach Abandoned Smoke Lake. Several cultivation families reside near Abandoned Smoke Lake, and it's rumored they have close ties to the Liuhe Sect, one of the three major sects of the Fire Domain."</p><p>"So, we're not far from Liuhe Sect's territory?" the tall man asked.</p><p>"Yes," the alluring woman nodded.</p><p>Two hundred years had mellowed the tall man; he mused, "Over the last two hundred years, we’ve found three ancient ruins, but none triggered the same reaction in the Flame Heart Jade. This suggests a fourth, undiscovered ruin remains hidden."</p><p>For years, we've avoided the Fire Region Three Sects as much as possible, but as our search area shrinks, it's inevitable. Even if it's a dragon's den, we must venture in!"</p><p>The alluring woman looked at Master Feiluo and said, "I'm not suggesting we give up; otherwise, these two hundred years would have been wasted.  I'm worried that the relic site is under the control of the Fire Region Three Sects. Although the three of us are unlikely to be detected, we are outnumbered. If we have to confront them…should we send a message back to the sect for reinforcements?"</p><p>Master Feiluo remained silent while they spoke.  Hearing this, he didn't comment, only saying, "Let's go!"</p><p>They exchanged a look, then reluctantly followed.</p><p>...</p><p>While Qin Sang's main body diligently cultivated, his avatar, using Taiyi's notes, had located a second repairable thunder altar.</p><p>This altar was hidden deep beneath a lake.</p><p>According to Taiyi's descriptions, thunder altars are usually built on mountaintops, high up.  Those built under a lake are rare.</p><p>This location was likely once a mountain peak, but over time, due to geological changes, it became submerged by lake water and sediment.</p><p>Because of this, this altar was exceptionally well-preserved, even better than the one at the Leixiao Sect.</p><p>With his previous experience, Qin Sang worked with increasing ease, repairing the altar in just two months.</p><p>He didn't remove the mud from the altar's surface; he simply concealed it with a restriction.</p><p>Sitting cross-legged on the altar, Qin Sang channeled his true essence, attempting to sense other altars.</p><p>To his delight, this time, his efforts weren't in vain; he received a response, originating from the Leixiao Sect's altar.</p><p>There was indeed a connection between the altars, even across vast distances.</p><p>Initially, these altars were intended to form a larger array.</p><p>However, when Qin Sang tried to utilize the power of the two altars, he failed.</p><p>He still couldn't pinpoint the location of the main altar.</p><p>"It seems I'll need to repair a third altar," Qin Sang murmured, images of Taiyi's notes flashing through his mind.</p><p>This was the fifth altar they had found, and only now had they found a usable one.</p><p>Hopefully, some of the remaining altars could also be repaired.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>Qin Sang broke the surface of the water.</p><p>Xiao Wu and Zhuque were playing by the lake, while Luo Hou lay on the grass, adapting to his new body.</p><p>Only Taiyi diligently protected him.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang emerge, Zhuque chirped, turning to flee, but Qin Sang stopped it in mid-air, making it his obedient mount.</p><p>Priorities first. Finding the main altar was paramount. They flew on Zhuque, hardly stopping, searching one by one.</p><p>They first went northwest, reaching the border between Muluo Mountain and the Fire Region.  According to Taiyi's information, this area might be the edge of the altar network.</p><p>Then, they searched southward along the Muluo Mountain border, eventually reaching the Lihu Lake watershed, but found no more altars to the south.</p><p>Qin Sang therefore deduced that the area where the altars were located likely coincided with the mortal realm, whether by coincidence or design.</p><p>Unable to repair these altars for now, Qin Sang made a note of each and continued eastward.</p><p>"This is the sixteenth one. If the altars truly span the entire mortal realm, these are probably less than a quarter of the total.  What an enormous scale!  It's unnecessary for a simple ritual to require this much effort.  It seems the creator of the altars really intended to establish a vast…"</p><p>Qin Sang sighed, gently patted Zhuque, concealed their presence, and headed towards a mountain ahead.</p><p>This mountain was majestic, towering above its surroundings.</p><p>From mid-mountain, the slopes were sheer cliffs, impassable even for monkeys or birds.</p><p>A few ancient pines and cypresses stubbornly clung to the cliff face, serving as a stark contrast.</p><p>They landed on the summit. Qin Sang released Zhuque's restraints. Zhuque immediately transformed into its true form, muttering something under its breath.</p><p>"Master, no one has tampered with my restriction."</p><p>The altar was built in a hidden crevice. Taiyi inspected it and reported respectfully.</p><p>Qin Sang stepped forward, examining the altar, his eyes brightening.</p><p>This altar was severely damaged, worse than the others, yet Qin Sang saw that the main structure remained, and restoration was possible.</p><p>"This is it!"</p><p>Qin Sang immediately decided. "Taiyi, check the surrounding area for any sect presence."</p><p>"Yes!"</p><p>Taiyi departed.</p><p>Zhuque, not having received permission, was even more disgruntled.  Unwillingly, it was no match for Qin Sang and could only hop around Xiao Wu, grumbling its discontent.</p><p>It was dawn.</p><p>The morning mist had yet to dissipate, and the rising sun painted the east with fiery hues.</p><p>Qin Sang worked busily beside the altar.</p><p>Xiao Wu sat on the cliff edge, her small hand tracing the angles of the rocks, gazing at the sunrise and the vast expanse, her chubby legs dangling over the edge.</p><p>Zhuque, also captivated by the beauty, nestled beside Xiao Wu, unusually calm, quietly admiring the view.</p><p>The sun fully rose.</p><p>Zhuque yawned, stretched its neck, scanning the forest below, then froze.</p><p>Something seemed to have caught its eye.  It tilted its head, stared for a long time, nudged Xiao Wu with its wing, and pointed down. "Look! Look!"</p>
