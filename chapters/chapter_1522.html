<h1>Chapter 1513: The Demons’ Demise (4k)</h1><p>As Qin Sang activated the Exquisite Pagoda, the mist at the edge of the stone tablet space immediately ceased its expansion.</p><p>The mist, like a tide, receded, faster than its advance, and progressively thinned!</p><p>Something was brewing.</p><p>There were no obvious abnormalities within the space.</p><p>However, the demons were gathered before the Exquisite Pagoda, and even through the golden barrier, they could sense its changes.</p><p>Those with keen spiritual senses halted their attacks, an ominous premonition filling their hearts, leaving them uncertain and alarmed.</p><p>Qin Sang and Liuli, wielding the Stupa, entered the barrier, a sight witnessed by all the demons.</p><p>They harbored various speculations about the Stupa's function, but how could they give up until the very end?</p><p>Even if Qin Sang could become the master of the Exquisite Pagoda, it was impossible to defeat so many masters with a single treasure.  Breaking through the golden barrier and entering the Exquisite Pagoda offered a chance to reverse the situation and seize the treasure.</p><p>It seemed they had thought too simply…</p><p>The aura emanating from the Exquisite Pagoda grew increasingly brighter.  Though mostly obscured by the golden barrier, the light cast a rainbow-hued glow on the surrounding mist, bathing the demons in iridescent light.</p><p>Sensing something, the demons looked up at the jewel atop the Exquisite Pagoda.</p><p>The rainbow light shimmered, the aura emitting an unknown wave.</p><p>The dangerous premonition stemmed from this wave.</p><p>The wave, invisible and intangible, pierced the golden barrier, spreading and finally merging with the entire stone tablet space.</p><p>The space itself didn't change; those outside remained oblivious, but the demons clearly felt that the Exquisite Pagoda had transformed!</p><p>At this moment, the Exquisite Pagoda seemed to merge with the space, becoming one.  The Exquisite Pagoda was the stone tablet space, and the stone tablet space resided within the Exquisite Pagoda!</p><p>This sensation was so absurd, so beyond comprehension, that the demons suspected it was an illusion.  Looking around, they found others sharing the same expression.</p><p>Simultaneously, the Exquisite Pagoda's power surged.  The relatively low pagoda seemed to grow before their eyes, becoming increasingly imposing and majestic.</p><p>“This is…”</p><p>Tianpeng the Great Saint’s eyes flashed, his expression changing drastically.  “Stop him!”</p><p>Understanding Tianpeng the Great Saint's intent, the demons, no longer holding back, unleashed their most powerful techniques, attacking the golden barrier frenziedly.</p><p>In an instant, the golden light and rainbow aura were shattered, transforming the area before the Exquisite Pagoda into a terrifying battlefield.</p><p>Tianpeng the Great Saint unleashed the Golden Peng.</p><p>Bifa reactivated the Blood Flame technique.</p><p>Gui General remained outside, a thin black line extending from his brow, connecting to a puppet.  The puppet was an exact replica of Gui General.  Using some unknown sorcery, it clung to the golden barrier, as if trying to merge with it.</p><p>…</p><p>Waves of arcane techniques and divine powers, arrays of magical artifacts and treasures, intermingled, clashed, and erupted, yet strangely vanished, plunging the vicinity into darkness.</p><p>Within the darkness, the demons disappeared, the darkness concealing a terrible danger.</p><p>Assaulted by the darkness, the golden barrier swayed, yet it couldn’t be broken instantly.</p><p>But the Exquisite Pagoda wouldn't wait.  In a moment, it transformed from an unreachable mountain into an overwhelming ‘heaven,’ enveloping all, suffocating the demons, and instilling boundless fear.</p><p>The change was too swift.</p><p>They had only managed one attack before the situation escalated to this point, their gazes now filled with terror as they stared at the Exquisite Pagoda.</p><p>Xiao Xiangzi had made elaborate preparations to prevent the demons from detecting the array beforehand and escaping before its activation.</p><p>In truth, the array's activation wasn't slow; Xiao Xiangzi's 'slow' was relative to him and the demons.</p><p>Finally, a demon, unable to risk his life gambling on breaking through the barrier before the danger arrived, roared, turned, and fled towards the valley entrance.</p><p>His actions served as a catalyst for others.</p><p>In an instant, several figures vanished into the mist, more and more choosing to abandon the assault.</p><p>Even Tianpeng the Great Saint, despite his furious rage and curses, couldn't reverse the tide and was forced to retreat.</p><p>Before leaving, Tianpeng the Great Saint, his gaze cold and dark, fixed his eyes on the Exquisite Pagoda, memorizing the appearances of Qin Sang and Liuli.</p><p>In the deep valley, the demons unleashed their powers, fleeing at top speed.</p><p>The fastest demon, bursting from the valley, saw the scene outside and his expression changed, his face filled with horror.</p><p>The stone tablet space was almost unrecognizable.</p><p>Above, a rainbow light filled the space, vaguely revealing a blurry shadow.  Upon closer inspection, it was revealed to be the silhouette of a gigantic tower.</p><p>The tower's size was unimaginable, piercing the heavens; the entire stone tablet space was contained within it.</p><p>"So it wasn't an illusion after all!"</p><p>The demons simultaneously arrived at this conclusion.  They finally understood the purpose of the Exquisite Pagoda: to wipe them all out!</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>Two resounding booms echoed.</p><p>One came from behind; there was no need to look back to know it originated from the Exquisite Pagoda. A ray of rainbow light pierced the clouds, broke free from chains, and shot towards the sky, quickly merging with the tower's shadow.</p><p>The other sound came from the left of the deep valley. That was considered the core of the stone tablet space, the location of the grandest and most mysterious hall – Yong'an Hall.</p><p>All signs indicated that Yong'an Hall was the place where the stone tablet space's master cultivated and the most likely location of treasures.  Upon entering the space, the demons were immediately drawn to Yong'an Hall.  Despite their considerable experience, even they were awestruck by the palace-like hall, making it their first exploration target.</p><p>Some demons remained in Yong'an Hall, but they would never escape.  For Xiaoxiangzi's main focus was precisely Yong'an Hall!  The original plan was to activate the spirit array once the demons entered. It was indeed the core, but a core of a trap.  At this moment, the numerous halls came alive, each a part of the grand array, compressing inwards, their shadows flickering.</p><p>The Exquisite Pagoda activated the spirit array, suppressing everything within. Yong'an Hall bore the brunt of the attack, but the entire space was affected.  The demons felt as if they were burdened by a mountain, unable to move within the stone tablet space.</p><p>At the edge of the stone tablet space, figures fled in panic.  Yuan Ying Masters, their faces etched with rare terror and urgency, were among them – the Xuan Tian Palace cultivators, including Tong Lingyu.  After receiving Liuli's warning, others were hesitant, but Tong Lingyu and Jiang Dianzhu overruled them. Now they could only be thankful.</p><p>Only after escaping the stone tablet space did they dare to look back. Through the thinning mist, they were shocked by the scene.</p><p>The stone tablet space was in upheaval.  Streams of profound light shot into the sky, with Yong'an Hall being the most striking.  Rainbow light burst forth above, spreading everywhere. An Exquisite Pagoda expanded at a visible rate, descending with earth-shattering power.  Its momentum seemed to aim at suppressing the entire space!</p><p>Everyone held their breath, their faces stunned.</p><p>"Where are Liuli and the others?" Elder Mei quickly scanned the surroundings.</p><p>Jiang Dianzhu's face was grim. They had only foreseen the danger thanks to Liuli's warning.  Why were Liuli and her spouse, the first to discover the danger, nowhere to be seen?</p><p>Tong Lingyu frowned, searching the space.  At that moment, someone nearby noticed something, his expression changing, pointing and shouting, "Look there!"</p><p>Where he pointed, numerous escaping lights streamed out.  One, a golden light like an arrow, was none other than the Great Saint Tianpeng.</p><p>More and more escaping lights emerged.  They were all renowned demons from the North Sea.  The demons, once awe-inspiring rulers of their territories, had lost their imposing demeanor, their expressions filled with terror, like desperate insects scrambling for survival.  Even the top-tier expert, Great Saint Tianpeng, lost his usual composure as he watched the rapidly descending tower.</p><p>A long cry.  The golden pengs circling Tianpeng shattered, their essence absorbed into his feathers, dramatically increasing his speed, quickly surpassing everyone else.  Considering the tower's descent speed, only the fastest few had a chance of escape.  The demons trailing behind cursed their lack of speed, despair etched on their faces.</p><p>Some demons abandoned their physical bodies, attempting to teleport using their Yuan Ying, but as soon as their Yuan Ying appeared, they felt an inexplicable force, freezing them in place, their teleportation abruptly interrupted.</p><p>Seeing this, Tong Lingyu and the others exchanged glances, understanding their course of action.  Xuan Tian Palace was in turmoil, and this was a heaven-sent opportunity to eliminate their enemies.  To miss this chance would be a waste of their years of cultivation. They silently invoked their treasures, preparing for battle.</p><p>*Rumble!*</p><p>The space shook violently; the Exquisite Pagoda was almost upon them.  Its shadow enveloped all the demons. The tower's base was almost within reach.</p><p>Great Saint Tianpeng's speed reached its peak, like a golden lightning bolt tearing through space, creating thunderous sounds.</p><p>"Attack!"</p><p>Tong Lingyu hissed, and the Xuan Tian Palace cultivators suddenly charged from the shadows.</p><p>A jade-green sword light flashed, the Qingxiao Sword striking!</p><p>Other cultivators' magic weapons followed closely, most targeting the same foe as Tong Lingyu.</p><p>Grand Sage Tianpeng!</p><p>Grand Sage Tianpeng's eyes flashed crimson.</p><p>"I will slaughter your entire sect!"</p><p>Grand Sage Tianpeng roared like thunder, his gaze sharp as a knife, radiating bone-chilling hatred and killing intent.</p><p>Tong Lingyu sneered, unthreatened, unhesitating.</p><p>The Qingxiao Sword blazed with light, its momentum earth-shattering, its movements refined to the extreme.</p><p>Had it been only the Qingxiao Sword, Grand Sage Tianpeng might have had a sliver of a chance, but there were no ifs.</p><p>The other attacks followed swiftly, sealing off all of Grand Sage Tianpeng's escape routes.</p><p>"You shall die!"</p><p>Grand Sage Tianpeng's cry was incredibly shrill. He was meant to rule the North Sea, yet he was about to die here so ignominiously—how could he accept it?</p><p>His body trembled, his blood burning, countless feathers and golden light burst forth from him, like a blazing sun.</p><p>The Qingxiao Sword's light was even overshadowed.</p><p>Tong Lingyu's cultivation was slightly inferior, but she wasn't lacking in support.  The other cultivators' attacks immediately pressed in.</p><p>The Xuan Tian Palace cultivators' magic weapons varied, but largely adhered to the principle of Xuan Ice.</p><p>Their combined attack was like a pale blue river of ice, vast and unstoppable, surging forward to engulf the golden light.</p><p>Even as powerful as Grand Sage Tianpeng, he couldn't withstand this long-planned ambush. He was forcefully driven back, unable to advance an inch, his hope of escape completely severed!</p><p>Bi Fang and other demons suffered the same fate as Grand Sage Tianpeng.</p><p>Bi Fang used a self-mutilating escape technique. Having once escaped Qin Sang, its speed was naturally considerable.</p><p>However, after joining Grand Sage Tianpeng, it had been forced to exert itself, and Xuan Tian Palace had long since taken note.</p><p>Bi Fang saw a flash before Jiang Dianzhu's ice jade cauldron smashed into it.  In the midst of its overexertion technique, it was too late to react. With a loud "bang," it flew backward, leaving behind a desperate shriek.</p><p>…</p><p>While blocking the demons, Tong Lingyu and the others searched for Qin Sang and Liuli, but to no avail.</p><p>Suddenly, Tong Lingyu's expression shifted. Her right hand moved, sliding a hexagonal mirror from her sleeve.</p><p>The mirror was only half a palm in size, with a slightly bulging circular surface in the center.</p><p>Tong Lingyu pointed the mirror into the distance, and a figure appeared from thin air.</p><p>It was the Old Demon Hunmo!</p><p>Before the Exquisite Pagoda, after being severely injured by Qin Sang, the Old Demon felt a chill down his spine.</p><p>With many enemies, fearing an ambush, he retreated to heal, planning to wait until his injuries were under control before seeking another opportunity.  Unwittingly, this turned out to be fortunate.</p><p>In his current state, had he not retreated earlier, he would never have escaped to this place.</p><p>He had intended to flee while Xuan Tian Palace attacked Grand Sage Tianpeng, but he was still discovered.</p><p>Tong Lingyu's face changed. Without hesitation, she redirected the Qingxiao Sword, abandoning her previous target and aiming it at Old Demon Hunmo.</p><p>Xuan Tian Palace was currently vulnerable, the fewer powerful cultivators outside, the better. Moreover, Old Demon Hunmo was the main culprit behind this invasion of the sacred land.</p><p>Old Demon Hunmo's heart jumped. He quickly raised his black bamboo staff, pointing it at the Qingxiao Sword, and a burst of demonic light erupted.</p><p>With a loud "bang," the jade-green sword light pierced the demonic light.</p><p>Old Demon Hunmo held his black bamboo staff, a dark aura surging across his wrinkled face. The black bamboo staff vibrated, flying from his hand, transforming into a colossal club and smashing down.</p><p>He moved in a blur, trying to escape.</p><p>But Elder Mei had already received a warning and, abandoning her opponent, joined Tong Lingyu against Old Demon Hunmo.</p><p>“Crack, crack, crack…”</p><p>Ice crystals rapidly formed, instantly creating a thick ice wall in front of Old Demon Hunmo.</p><p>Others joined the attack.</p><p>Having lost his ghost spirit, Old Demon Hunmo finally understood the meaning of being at his wit's end.</p><p>…</p><p>Amidst desperate and resentful howls, the Exquisite Pagoda crashed down!</p><p>Clouds and mist swirled, like rising smoke.</p><p>Old Demon Hunmo, Grand Sage Tianpeng, and the numerous demons were all suppressed beneath the pagoda!</p><p>Tong Lingyu and the others kept a close watch on these major threats, ensuring no one slipped through, though only a few demons managed to escape.</p><p>These demons dared not look back, fearing being hunted down by Xuan Tian Palace. They immediately fled into the chaotic currents, including the Old Demon Hunmo's senior disciple.</p><p>He chose not to save his master, but to flee for his own life.</p><p>At the moment the Exquisite Pagoda fell, Old Demon Hunmo's eyes froze, rapidly turning pale.</p><p>Simultaneously, a dark shadow, strikingly similar to Old Demon Hunmo, suddenly appeared in his senior disciple's black pupils.</p><p>The senior disciple's expression stiffened for a moment, then quickly returned to normalcy. He sneered, "I appreciate Master's kindness, but I fear I can't accept such a gift."</p><p>As he spoke, a tear rolled down the senior disciple's eye, seemingly peeling off a thin film to become a complete teardrop, which revealed itself to be a magical artifact.</p><p>The teardrop was crystal clear, containing a small figure sealed within, frantically banging against the teardrop's surface, emitting a silent roar.</p><p>The senior disciple looked relieved and casually put away the teardrop.</p><p>——</p><p>——</p><p>Thanks to Qi Zhi You Zou for the generous donation.</p>
