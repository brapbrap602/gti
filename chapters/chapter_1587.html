<h1>Chapter 1578: The Illusory Tomb of the Water Phase</h1><p>Su Zinan wore a smile, sharing the good news with Old Wu.</p><p>But what he was doing was an act of treachery against a loyal servant.</p><p>The silken net was made from tendons extracted from Spirit Pythons raised in a serpent's lair. This type of Spirit Python was called the Earthbound Dragon, and it wasn't entirely inaccurate to call their tendons 'dragon sinews.'</p><p>The dragon sinews were first soaked in spiritual medicine for a hundred years, then refined through ninety-nine sacrificial procedures, finally forming the silken net, transparent, concealed, and possessing a toughness rarely seen in the world.</p><p>Old Wu fell into the trap and was bound by the silken net.</p><p>"You beast!"</p><p>Old Wu could never have imagined that the person he had raised with his own hands would lead him to utter ruin.</p><p>Su Zinan remained unmoved, not only showing no shame but also a deep anticipation in his eyes.</p><p>The dragon sinew net tightened, revealing the shadowy forms of pythons. These dragon sinews seemed to have transformed back into Earthbound Dragons, their heads and tails connected, their bodies intertwined, writhing ceaselessly.</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>The center of the dragon sinew net suddenly bulged, emitting a muffled sound.</p><p>The Blood-Drinking Demonic Halberd frantically attacked from within the net.</p><p>Su Zinan snorted, calmly flicking his fingers.  A brilliant light erupted in the void, and a talisman formation abruptly appeared.  Spiritual energy surged, talisman shadows flowed, converging within the net, targeting the Blood-Drinking Demonic Halberd.</p><p>With every talisman shadow that landed on the Blood-Drinking Demonic Halberd, its spiritual light dimmed. Old Wu felt his treasured halberd growing heavier, a barrier forming between him and his lifebound magical treasure.</p><p>Su Zinan knew Old Wu very well.</p><p>The trap wasn't just the dragon sinew net, but also the talisman formation specifically designed to counter the Blood-Drinking Demonic Halberd!</p><p>A strange sound escaped Old Wu's throat. The blood shadow reappeared around him, though much fainter than when he fought Qin Sang. Judging by Old Wu's contorted expression, it was also much more strenuous.</p><p>The blood shadow's destruction by the Sun God Tree had significantly impacted Old Wu.</p><p>Old Wu forcibly summoned the blood shadow to assist in unleashing the Truth-Shattering Demonic Halberd.  Unexpectedly, three faceless heads flew towards him. Their smooth faces split open into wide maws, devouring most of the blood shadow in the blink of an eye.</p><p>The momentum of the Blood-Drinking Demonic Halberd shifted from ascendance to decline.</p><p>His technique was nearly broken.</p><p>Old Wu roared fiercely, burning his vital essence to forcibly complete the Truth-Shattering Demonic Halberd technique with sheer willpower.</p><p>The dragon sinew net strained, and two intersecting blood marks appeared in the center. With a ripping sound, the dragon sinews snapped. The Earthbound Dragons howled silently as the net was torn apart.</p><p>At this moment, the power of the talisman formation solidified on the surface of the Blood-Drinking Demonic Halberd, like a layer of frost, dimming its spiritual light and hindering its use.</p><p>Old Wu didn't even dare to reclaim his lifebound magical treasure. Instead, he flipped his hand and produced a talisman disc.  The runes on this disc were exceptionally simple, only three in total!</p><p>*Crack!*</p><p>The talisman disc shattered, releasing the talismans.</p><p>The three talismans merged into one, their power condensing into a pair of blood-red wings in the void, dripping with crimson, their凶煞aura soaring to the heavens!</p><p>The blood wings flashed, appearing beside Old Wu's ribs and flapping powerfully.</p><p>Old Wu transformed into a streak of blood, escaping through the air.</p><p>However, the blood wings only managed a single flap. The medicinal pool suddenly shimmered with the light of a spirit array, shooting out an inconspicuous black light that struck Old Wu mid-air. With a resounding *crack*, Old Wu's physical body exploded into a mist of blood, leaving no bones behind.</p><p>"Did you forget? I learned all these skills from you..."</p><p>Su Zinan revealed a sinister smile, his gaze shifting to the side of the bamboo grove.</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>The earth exploded.</p><p>A blood shadow shot into the sky. It was Old Wu's Nascent Soul, abandoning his physical body in an attempt to escape unnoticed.</p><p>His Nascent Soul's eyes were tightly closed, trembling uncontrollably, having lost its spiritual awareness.</p><p>The three faceless heads circled the Nascent Soul rapidly, constantly emitting chilling ghostly Qi.</p><p>One of the faceless heads, unable to resist, slammed into its two companions, opened its wide mouth, and swallowed Old Wu's Nascent Soul in one gulp, eagerly flying back to its master.</p><p>The other two let out frustrated shrieks, but they could do nothing.</p><p>Su Zinan was already sitting cross-legged on the ground, his fingers moving like wheels, completing a series of incredibly complex hand seals, which he imbued into the head that had swallowed Old Wu's Nascent Soul.</p><p>The head rolled back and forth, emitting sharp cries.</p><p>Soon, the head finally quieted down. Its smooth surface bulged and caved in, spontaneously forming facial features that were identical to Old Wu's.</p><p>Below the head swirled a dark, ethereal ghost mist, where Old Wu's soul was trapped.</p><p>Old Wu's ghost head abruptly opened its eyes, fixing Su Zinan with a hateful glare. Its expression struggled violently, but the movements grew smaller and smaller until they ceased entirely.</p><p>"Two more to go..."</p><p>Su Zinan murmured, looking at the completed ghost head.</p><p>*Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh!*</p><p>Old Wu's ghost head and the other two faceless heads flew to Su Zinan. He flipped his hand, producing a triangular black banner, and stored them within.</p><p>Standing up, Su Zinan stretched, glanced at the battlefield, a wicked smile curving his lips. He turned and walked out of the purple bamboo grove.</p><p>Having not seen their beloved for years, the women were filled with longing. They beamed upon seeing Su Zinan, their smiles tinged with a hint of resentment.</p><p>Surrounded by beauties, he was truly content.</p><p>The air was filled with sweet laughter and the fragrance of orchids and cassia.</p><p>Su Zinan embraced them, his eyes narrowing as he enjoyed their soft warmth. Suddenly, he asked, "Did you hear anything just now?"</p><p>The women froze, hastily shaking their heads.</p><p>Su Zinan looked around, sighing, "How lamentable that time is merciless, and youth fleeting. In a blink, beauty fades."</p><p>Before his words ended, dragon sinews shot out from his fingertips.  With a series of *whooshing* sounds, they tightly wrapped around the women's delicate necks, lifting them into the air.</p><p>*Crack...*</p><p>Their neck bones were nearly crushed.</p><p>The women's faces contorted in pain, struggling desperately, their eyes filled with disbelief.</p><p>Moments ago, he was their loving companion; now, he was merciless.</p><p>Seeing their expressions, Su Zinan grew even more disgusted.  Like discarding trash, he flung them into the serpent's lair in the bamboo grove to be devoured by the Earthbound Dragons.</p><p>Only a terrified Golden Core female cultivator remained.</p><p>Su Zinan approached her, pinching her chin and tilting it slightly upwards. He tapped her between the eyebrows with a finger. "Forget."</p><p>The female cultivator's eyes closed, then slowly opened. Looking at her beloved so close, her cheeks flushed slightly, her eyes filled with affection.</p><p>"Once you reach Nascent Soul, you will be my Moon Consort."</p><p>Su Zinan kissed the female cultivator lightly, then turned and left Luye.</p><p>...</p><p>Inside the ice cave.</p><p>Qin Sang and his Avatar entered the crevice.</p><p>As they descended, Qin Sang silently calculated the time.</p><p>All signs pointed to the disappearance of the Central Continent's Nascent Soul cultivators, and the Moon Consort's words confirmed this.</p><p>That old man had gone back for reinforcements, and at most, he would bring Nascent Soul cultivators.</p><p>However, these considerations only allowed Qin Sang to be a bit bolder in his decisions. Facing such a formidable opponent capable of utterly destroying him, no one could be certain without absolute assurance.</p><p>His true body would follow and assess the situation.</p><p>If the crevice led directly to the tomb of the Water Phase Master, his true body and Avatar could join forces. Suppressing Old Man Yanshan shouldn't be difficult. Retrieving the legacy and leaving would be straightforward.</p><p>But if the situation below proved too complex, preventing immediate resolution and requiring too much time, he would send either his true body or his Avatar away, securing an escape route based on the circumstances.</p><p>The crevice led to an unknown destination.</p><p>The further down they went, the colder it became, the denser the Cold煞Qi grew.</p><p>These signs indicated that the source of the Cold煞Qi was below, likely originating from the tomb of the Water Phase Master.</p><p>Restrictions were layered everywhere.</p><p>As Qin Sang progressed, he discovered that some restrictions had already been broken, undoubtedly by Old Man Yanshan. Many restrictions remained intact, and Qin Sang couldn't discern how he had bypassed them.</p><p>While there were traces of forced entry, the methods used were quite ingenious, indicating a deep familiarity with this place.</p><p>Qin Sang could only rely on brute force to break the restrictions.</p><p>Guided by the Heaven's Eye Butterfly, he alternated between Demonic Fire and the Four-Chariot Green Serpent Seal, forcibly blasting a path forward.</p><p>Deep within the crevice.</p><p>Old Man Yanshan stood before a wall of white ice, his hands pressed against it, ripples of blue water emanating from his palms, spreading across the entire surface.</p><p>The ice wall was embedded in the stone, not ordinary profound ice, but fused with powerful restrictions, blocking both divine sense and vision, obscuring what lay within.</p><p>Under the impact of the water ripples, the ice wall gradually shifted from white to transparent. Once the white vanished, it would signify the depletion of the ice wall's power, allowing Old Man Yanshan to enter the tomb.</p><p>Just as he was concentrating on breaking the restriction, the ground trembled violently.</p><p>Old Man Yanshan's expression changed drastically. He looked up, seeing only a dense network of restrictions. His eyes flickered uncertainly as he channeled his True Essence, projecting his voice through the restrictions, "I didn't expect Fellow Daoist to achieve victory so quickly. No wonder Patriarch Situ praised you so highly in his letter."</p><p>Qin Sang, rapidly breaking restrictions as he descended, faintly heard Old Man Yanshan's voice. He paused briefly, glanced at his surroundings, and had his Avatar respond, "This humble Daoist also didn't expect Fellow Daoist to be a Water Phase inheritor of the Formless Immortal Sect!"</p><p>"Not quite."</p><p>Old Man Yanshan denied, "This old man can't be considered an inheritor. The Formless Immortal Sect's Water Phase is divided into the Water Manipulation and Frost Ice lineages. I only managed to obtain some cultivation techniques and secret arts of the Water Manipulation lineage, gaining a vague understanding of some secrets, truly insignificant. Otherwise, this old man wouldn't have needed to stay in the Northern Wastelands for so many years, waiting until today."</p><p>"Is this truly the tomb of the Water Phase Master? And what about the Snow Fox?"</p><p>Qin Sang continued his descent as he questioned.</p><p>Old Man Yanshan was surprisingly willing to answer, "Indeed, the outside is an illusory tomb, while the inside is the true one! The Snow Fox is actually a guide, preventing the treasures from being forgotten. If a true inheritor of the Water Phase lineage were to pass through the snowy plains and discover the Snow Fox, they would know this is the ancestral master's tomb. Upon gaining the Snow Fox's recognition, they could retrieve the Water Phase Master's legacy. This old man suspects, perhaps out of concern that someone like Fellow Daoist, possessing divine eyes, might arrive first, the Water Phase Master constructed an illusory tomb outside. Those unaware of the truth would only believe this place is for condensing Cold Crystals, stealing the crystals, and thus overlooking the true treasures..."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded inwardly. The Water Phase Master's arrangements were quite ingenious. For the sake of realism, he even set up a killing formation within a formation, as if genuinely guarding against the theft of Cold Crystals.</p><p>Before Old Man Yanshan's disappearance, he hadn't considered this possibility.</p><p>If not for Old Man Yanshan's intrusion, disrupting the seamless layout, even with the Heaven's Eye Butterfly assisting in the search, Qin Sang wouldn't have uncovered the truth so easily.</p><p>Qin Sang's ignorance didn't mean Luye was unaware.</p><p>If Luye hadn't interfered, Old Man Yanshan could have simply followed Qin Sang out, then returned quietly to retrieve the treasures, leaving Qin Sang completely oblivious to being used.</p><p>"So, Fellow Daoist used me to locate the tomb?" Qin Sang asked again.</p><p>Old Man Yanshan avoided a direct answer, "This old man harbored no intention of harming Fellow Daoist. Fellow Daoist came for the Cold Crystals, while this old man's goal was the Water Phase Master's legacy. Our purposes did not conflict. I had no intention of monopolizing the Cold Crystals, fully meeting Fellow Daoist's requirements. Does that count as deception?  It was merely each taking what they needed."</p><p>"How does Fellow Daoist explain the matter of Luye?"</p><p>Qin Sang narrowed his eyes, a cold glint flashing within.</p><p>Old Man Yanshan wanting to claim the Water Phase Master's legacy for himself was understandable. But Qin Sang couldn't tolerate being manipulated and becoming enemies with Luye.</p><p>Old Man Yanshan sighed, "If I said I knew nothing and had never seen anyone from Luye here before, Fellow Daoist would likely not believe me, would you?  Had I known this would happen, I wouldn't have been so careless while pursuing the Snow Fox. Moreover… doesn't Fellow Daoist also have a helper hidden in the shadows, concealed for half a year? Such patience you both possess!"</p><p>Situ Yu hadn't mentioned Qin Sang's Avatar in his letter, leaving Old Man Yanshan unaware.</p><p>Qin Sang sighed in response.</p><p>He wasn't a good person. He had committed acts of forced acquisition and disguised theft in the name of seeking the Dao.</p><p>However, if there was a possibility of cooperation, he preferred it.  His true body had only followed as a precaution.</p><p>Saying this aloud, Old Man Yanshan certainly wouldn't believe him.</p><p>Putting himself in the other man's shoes, he would also be suspicious and wary.</p><p>After a moment of silence, Old Man Yanshan sighed, "Fortunately, there was Fellow Daoist, this hidden piece. Otherwise, both of us would be in grave danger today.  Whether Fellow Daoist believes it or not, this old man had no intention of harming you.  I admire Fellow Daoist's divine abilities and had hoped we could become friends. Alas, fate is cruel. Now that Fellow Daoist has seen through my actions, I have nothing to say. As for the Water Phase Master's legacy, let's rely on our respective abilities! From this day forward, we shall go our separate ways!"</p><p>As he spoke these words, Qin Sang rapidly approached, the tremors in the crevice growing even more violent.</p><p>Old Man Yanshan withdrew his gaze, staring at his hands.</p><p>His ten fingers trembled, ripples of water surging forth, not only flowing across the surface of the ice wall but beginning to visibly seep into it.  Under the impact of the ripples, the white within grew increasingly thin.</p><p>He had inherited an incomplete legacy, and after years of contemplation, reaching this point was already quite remarkable.</p><p>Whether it was due to the tremors outside or the ice wall itself vibrating, a reactive force transmitted to Old Man Yanshan's palms, causing his breathing to quicken.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the white within the ice wall thinned considerably, becoming more transparent.</p><p>Old Man Yanshan was overjoyed. He poured his True Essence into the technique without reservation.  One-Yuan Heavy Water seeped from his palms into the ice wall, striking like a giant hammer. With a *crack*, a fissure appeared in the center of the ice wall.</p><p>Once a flaw appeared, the ice wall could no longer maintain its integrity.</p><p>The cracks spread rapidly.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The ice wall shattered, sending shards of ice flying.</p><p>Old Man Yanshan couldn't conceal his delight as he charged into the tomb through the hail of ice.</p><p>The tomb wasn't large, square in shape.  Inscribed on the wall facing the entrance were several lines of text, presumably the Water Phase Master's last testament.</p><p>The contents within were clearly visible.</p><p>In the center lay a long block of profound ice. Old Man Yanshan initially assumed it was a coffin containing the Water Phase Master's remains, but he saw no bones. It was a solid ice bed.</p><p>The Water Phase Master had likely returned to the embrace of heaven and earth.</p><p>Three jade boxes were neatly placed on the ice bed.</p><p>In front of the bed, a spirit array was laid out, still functioning. At the center of the array was an exquisitely crafted ice disc, suspended in mid-air, crystalline and translucent, unlike any mundane object.</p><p>Powered by the spirit array, at regular intervals, a wisp of Cold煞Qi emanated from the ice disc, secretly transferring to the illusory tomb above, condensing into Cold Crystals to mislead those who stumbled upon it.</p><p>Old Man Yanshan's gaze was fervent.  His eyes were fixated on the ice disc within the spirit array.</p>
