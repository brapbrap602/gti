<h1>Chapter 727: Thunderclouds</h1><p>A thin layer of restriction covers the surface of the Dongming Cold Flame.</p><p>The restriction carries the aura of Nine Nether Demon Fire, emitting a faint grayish-black color, but it cannot obscure the extremely pure azure glow of the Dongming Cold Flame.</p><p>Qin Sang held the cold flame, carefully separating a strand of spiritual sense, and pierced through the restriction.</p><p>Inside the Dongming Cold Flame, a blue light flashed, and Qin Sang instantly lost perception of that strand of spiritual sense; it was easily annihilated by the Dongming Cold Flame.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression was somewhat helpless.</p><p>For months, this wasn't his first attempt, and the results were always similar.  He still had no clue how to subdue the Dongming Cold Flame.</p><p>"Could it be that I can only refine it into a disposable artifact similar to the Xuantian Thunder?"</p><p>Qin Sang muttered to himself.</p><p>Skilled in artifact refinement, he naturally considered solving this through refinement. After pondering for days, he discovered that forcibly compressing the Dongming Cold Flame using the Nine Nether Demon Fire might allow him to condense it into a fire pearl.</p><p>If refined into a fire pearl, the power of the cold flame would erupt instantly, its power far exceeding that of the Xuantian Thunder.  Probably few below the Yuan Ying stage could withstand it. The drawback is that it would also only be usable once.</p><p>"Such a rare cold flame, to condense it into a one-time-use fire pearl… such a waste. And condensing a fire pearl isn't so simple either; I'd need to at least break through to the mid-stage of Core Formation before attempting it."</p><p>Qin Sang hesitated, somewhat reluctant.</p><p>After a few more attempts, the Dongming Cold Flame remained unmoved, so Qin Sang put it away again.</p><p>…</p><p>Green Warbler Island.</p><p>Named after a type of small bird called the Green Warbler, these birds are not demonic beasts, are harmless, and are much loved.</p><p>Green Warbler Island is the kind of island without a Yuan Ying cultivator stationed there. Although it has a protective island formation, it appears exceptionally fragile in the face of a demonic tide. Qin Sang walked along the streets of Green Warbler Island and found that both sides were lined with extremely crude stone chambers and stone houses.</p><p>After exploring Green Warbler Island, Qin Sang bought the most detailed nautical chart of the surrounding area, easily determining the location of Red Leaf Island, and then departed alone.</p><p>Red Leaf Island is east of Green Warbler Island.</p><p>There aren't many cultivators on such small islands, and the explored sea area around them is limited. Red Leaf Island happens to be outside this range, and it's surrounded by dense demonic beasts, a dangerous place that everyone on Green Warbler Island speaks of with fear.</p><p>After traveling some distance from Green Warbler Island, out of sight of other cultivators, Qin Sang released his two-headed bird.  He and the beast flew across the sea, heading straight for Red Leaf Island.</p><p>Red Leaf Island is quite far from Green Warbler Island.  It took Qin Sang and the two-headed bird more than half a month to reach it. He wondered what treasure that Wu tribe strongman was searching for that led him so far.</p><p>Approaching Red Leaf Island, even Qin Sang dared not act carelessly.</p><p>Here, once the demonic beasts are alarmed, it's not a matter of a few; it's hordes upon hordes. These demonic beasts call to each other, forming groups and teams, instantly triggering a small beast tide, capable of trapping him here.</p><p>Having the two-headed bird keep watch, Qin Sang took out a scroll, concealed his figure, and constantly monitored the movements of the Hun Yuan Tong Xin Ring, proceeding cautiously.</p><p>Not long after setting out, the Yin Ring in Qin Sang's body began to vibrate incessantly.</p><p>The density of demonic beasts here surpassed even the Qian Yao Sea area, causing Qin Sang to be secretly shocked.</p><p>Fortunately, the Hun Yuan Tong Xin Ring hadn't yet sensed the aura of a Core Formation demonic beast.  Those lesser demonic beasts couldn't see through Qin Sang's concealment, allowing him to move forward with confidence.</p><p>However, this good fortune didn't last long.  Not far from there, the Yin Ring suddenly vibrated violently. Qin Sang's expression changed, and he had no choice but to detour.</p><p>The journey that should have taken half a day ended up taking a full day and night.  Only at nightfall did he finally see the shadow of Red Leaf Island.  No wonder that Wu tribe strongman looked so apprehensive when he spoke of Red Leaf Island.</p><p>Submerged at the water's surface, Qin Sang looked at Red Leaf Island from afar.</p><p>Red Leaf Island wasn't large; it was covered with ancient trees, the leaves of which were a fiery red. Under the cold moonlight, the red leaves formed a continuous expanse, like a red cloud floating on the sea.</p><p>Mist constantly shrouded the base of the ancient trees, never dissipating, creating a scene like a fairyland where red clouds and seas of mist layered upon each other.</p><p>"Good luck. No sign of demonic beasts."</p><p>Qin Sang reached the edge of Red Leaf Island, cautiously observing his surroundings, and secretly breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p>Only after landing did he discover that there wasn't a single blade of grass on Red Leaf Island. The only plants were the red-leaved ancient trees, and the island was completely silent, without a single insect or beast.</p><p>Entering the woods, Qin Sang grew more vigilant. The island's fog wasn't miasma, but unusually dense.  A sea of white obscured vision, and even his spiritual sense only extended a short distance.</p><p>Remembering the directions from the Wu tribe warrior, Qin Sang looked around, slightly adjusting his course, and headed straight into the heart of Red Leaf Island.</p><p>Walking among the ancient trees, he found the ground covered in blade-sharp stone fragments, standing upright everywhere.</p><p>The terrain seemed formed by sea erosion.  Numerous cracks ran between the stones, from which the thick fog constantly seeped.  The ancient trees' roots burrowed deep into these crevices.</p><p>The journey was peaceful.  Soon, Qin Sang reached his destination: an exceptionally tall ancient tree. Its massive roots resembled giant pythons, some as tall as two men. The roots intertwined, forming a canopy-like base.</p><p>Climbing onto the roots, Qin Sang searched until he found a hole between two dead roots, just large enough for a person to pass through. As the Wu tribe warrior had said, the six-petal butterfly violet lay beyond.</p><p>Mist filled the hole. Qin Sang sent his Sky-Flying Nightfork ahead, followed by his two-headed… (The original text contains a character that's difficult to directly translate and maintain its context, it's best omitted here for clarity).  Only then did he enter.</p><p>The tree's root system was incredibly complex and vast. The passage twisted and turned, descending deep underground. Eventually, the roots thinned, giving way to stone walls.</p><p>He was now in a subterranean canyon.  Suddenly, Qin Sang paused, listening intently.  He heard a faint rumbling, like distant thunder.  His Sky-Flying Nightfork continued undisturbed.  Hesitantly, Qin Sang pressed on.</p><p>The thunder grew louder, echoing deafeningly through the cavern.  Just as Qin Sang frowned, he received a message from his Sky-Flying Nightfork.  His face lit up, and he quickened his pace.</p><p>*Crack! Crack!*</p><p>Deep within Red Leaf Island lay a vast subterranean cavern. Qin Sang and his Sky-Flying Nightfork landed on the water's surface, looking up.</p><p>The cavern was free of dense fog, but thick clouds of mist hung from the ceiling.  Strangely, far underground, lightning flickered within the mist – thin streaks of electricity appearing and disappearing.</p><p>Illuminated by the flashes, the cavern's interior was visible. Qin Sang quickly spotted several familiar six-petal butterfly violets, fully bloomed and mature.</p><p>As Qin Sang was about to fly over and harvest them, the dormant Sky-Eyed Butterfly in his Qi Sea stirred, seeming eager to emerge.  It seemed drawn to the thunderclouds.</p>
