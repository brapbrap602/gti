<h1>Chapter 1851: Imperial Edict</h1><p>Why could the Demon King enter the Ritual Altar?</p><p>Moreover, there were no celestial signs around him.</p><p>While powerful, he was still far from a true Transcendent Void cultivator. Qin Sang had experienced the Demon King's terror during a past assassination attempt.</p><p>Qin Sang's first thought was to temporarily suppress his cultivation with a secret technique. But if doing so could hide celestial signs and enter the Ritual Altar, it would be too easy. Transcendent Void cultivators shouldn't need to worry about celestial signs.</p><p>Could it be self-truncation?</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't certain. The Dao Court and Gui Fang Kingdom possessed unfathomable resources, surely many methods unknown to him.</p><p>However, based on Qin Sang's understanding of the illusory scene, one thing was certain: Transcendent Void cultivators dared not use their full power within the Ritual Altar.  Revealing celestial signs would inevitably trigger a violent reaction from the illusory scene, and the one causing the disturbance would be the first to suffer.</p><p>Temporarily suppressing cultivation might allow for a chance to unleash a full-power strike after unsealing one's cultivation, but the consequence would be being forced out of the Ritual Altar, or even serious injury.  It was unlikely that they would use such a method against him for a mere Demon Marquis.</p><p>These thoughts flashed through Qin Sang's mind, but he wasn't intimidated by the mention of the Demon King.  His eyes narrowed, his speed not decreasing but increasing, instantly closing in on Marquis Gui.</p><p>The last barrier before Marquis Gui was shattered before the Great Vajra Wheel Seal and the palm-sized sword, not even lasting a breath.  It crumbled in an instant under Marquis Gui's despairing gaze.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>A huge palm shadow enveloped Marquis Gui, its force like a collapsing mountain.</p><p>“Audacious!”</p><p>King Ling You coldly snorted.</p><p>He used his divine ability, arriving through the water, but his speed was surprisingly inferior to this unknown cultivator.  He barely arrived to witness this scene, leaving him somewhat too late to intervene.</p><p>Ignoring the snort, Qin Sang's palm slammed down. Marquis Gui, having exhausted all his means, was unable to dodge. He let out a shrill scream, blood spraying into the air.</p><p>Marquis Gui bore the brunt of the attack, feeling like his limbs were shattering into dust under the terrifying force.  His internal organs shifted instantly, leaving him grievously injured.</p><p>The next moment, Marquis Gui felt a tightening around his neck, held firmly by a hand.  Stars danced before his eyes, and he seemed to see a phantom Buddha Seal.</p><p>An unparalleled force suddenly erupted. Marquis Gui's eyes bulged, and he could even hear the sound of his own spine breaking.</p><p>“Hoh…”</p><p>Marquis Gui's eyes were bloodshot, struggling wildly.</p><p>Seeing this, King Ling You laughed angrily. The black, shadowy waves beneath his feet ceased their advance, rising with alarming speed, like a surging river.</p><p>‘Rumble…’</p><p>The sound of the waves was deafening.</p><p>A giant wave suddenly rose from the black, shadowy waves, a strange shadow faintly visible in the spray, leaping from the water behind King Ling You.</p><p>From the waves, the shadow emerged. A black fish head poked out from above King Ling You’s head.</p><p>The fish head resembled a common black fish, its mouth full of fangs, its dark eyes fixed on Qin Sang, who was still wreaking havoc, revealing a fierce light.</p><p>However, the body was not that of a fish, its shape long and close to a dragon, with black scales identical to a dragon’s, and three-toed claws at its fins; it was clearly an unfinished dragon transformation of a fish demon!</p><p>‘Splash…’</p><p>The shadowy waves continued to rise, engulfing King Ling You, leaving only the black fish swimming within the waves.</p><p>‘Gulp…’</p><p>A strange sound came from within the black fish. Its long tail swung violently, carrying the black, shadowy waves, like a bursting dam, rushing forward.</p><p>This black fish was King Ling You’s Dharma form.</p><p>The Demon King had self-truncated, but not completely eliminating his Dharma form. In the manipulation and understanding of Dharma forms, he was far superior to Demon Marquises.</p><p>This alone was enough to suppress a Demon Marquis.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly felt his vision darken, black water appearing from all directions, a terrifying scene of overflowing water.</p><p>Behind him, rivers seemed to flow, accompanied by the majestic power of the Dharma form, bringing an overwhelming sense of oppression.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang felt as if he had fallen into a whirlpool, about to be crushed.</p><p>Qin Sang immediately understood what he was facing: the Demon King's Dharma form!</p><p>While alarmed, Qin Sang breathed a sigh of relief. The Dharma form's might was terrifying, but compared to the true Demon King's Dharma form that had hunted him before, there was a clear difference!</p><p>As expected, the Demon King was significantly restricted within the Ritual Altar.</p><p>‘Splash…’</p><p>The sound of the waves filled his ears, the pressure from behind drawing closer.</p><p>Qin Sang quickly assessed the power of the Demon King's Dharma form. Summoning his Qingluan Dharma form should allow him to resist the Dharma form's might, preventing being suppressed, or at least limiting the degree of suppression.</p><p>However, he could only integrate the Qingluan Dharma form into his body, passively using its power; he was self-admittedly inferior in the art of Dharma form manipulation.</p><p>If the Demon King only had these means, Qin Sang wouldn't be overly afraid.</p><p>This was obviously impossible.  Even with Qin Sang's self-confidence, she didn't believe she could defeat the Yao Wang.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't look back, her hand clenching tightly as she combined the power of the Great Vajra Wheel Seal and part of the Green Luan Dharma Image.</p><p>Crack!</p><p>Bones shattered.</p><p>Gui Hou's struggle ceased, his eyes lifeless. Qin Sang swayed, her Dharma Image power breaking through the suppression just in time, surging out before the water could close in.</p><p>In an instant, the sound of water disappeared, the surrounding water momentarily still.</p><p>Hei Yu's eyes froze, its mouth gaping open, spewing a jet of black water – too late.</p><p>Qin Sang recalled her Yunyou Sword, flapping her phoenix wings once, turning into lightning and breaking through the waves.  In a few flashes, she vanished from the demons' sight.</p><p>Hei Yu watched Qin Sang flee, abandoning the pursuit. It floated on the surface of the dark waves, its dragon tail continuously swaying.</p><p>Dingxiang Hou arrived late, Ping Hou having narrowly escaped, still shaken.</p><p>The two demons looked at Hei Yu, not daring to speak.</p><p>Other Yao Hou sensed the disturbance here and gradually approached.</p><p>Amidst the swirling water, the waves receded, and Hei Yu disappeared, revealing Lingyou Wang, a deep anger flashing in his dark eyes.</p><p>"A Dharma Image?"</p><p>Dingxiang Hou stepped forward and asked in a low voice.</p><p>Lingyou Wang remained expressionless, a faint "Mm" escaping his lips.  He added, "He doesn't bear the aura of a Da Zhenren."</p><p>Daoist demon soldiers are attached to a Daoist altar for cultivation, inevitably absorbing their master's aura.  While difficult for ordinary people to discern, it's clear to Lingyou Wang.</p><p>The lack of a Da Zhenren's aura indicated that he wasn't a soldier of a Da Zhenren.</p><p>If he were a soldier raised by the Daoist court, he should bear Daoist talismans.</p><p>Dingxiang Hou showed an expression of disbelief.  "Could he be a hidden talent?  Could he be a Yao Wang who has pledged allegiance to the Daoist court?"</p><p>Having spoken, Dingxiang Hou himself thought the second possibility unlikely.  The Daoist court would find it difficult to trust a demon cultivator.</p><p>Demon cultivators can only rely on Daoists; the Daoist court has never granted a demon cultivator the rank of five-talisman directly.</p><p>If he were a solitary demon cultivator, it would make sense. This demon may have received information, relying on his strength to stir up trouble.</p><p>The Gui Fang nation occupies Gangshan, and the Gangshan seal is their foothold in this world. Demon cultivators, like Daoists, must secure a position in the seal to become a Yao Wang.</p><p>Even among the demons, some are free spirits unwilling to be constrained.  They seek to obtain a third-rank cultivation method and hide in the demon kingdom of Jushan, at the cost of never achieving the five-talisman rank.</p><p>Who could resist the temptation of the seal?  Ultimately, they usually join Gui Fang, but exceptions exist.</p><p>These demon cultivators can only hone their skills, possibly achieving a Dharma Image.</p><p>Of course, this possibility is extremely low.  Gui Fang has many talented demons; even those who receive guidance from Yao Wangs or even Great Saints rarely achieve a Dharma Image.</p><p>He had followed Lingyou Wang for many years before barely grasping the basics.</p><p>"Regardless of this fellow's origins, I will ensure he never returns," Dingxiang Hou declared fiercely.</p><p>Lingyou Wang glanced at Dingxiang Hou; his expression was unreadable. "The Dharma Image power he displayed was slightly inferior to yours. However, that may not be his full strength."</p><p>Dingxiang Hou was startled, understanding the warning.  He quickly bowed in response.</p><p>Unaware of the demons' conversation, Qin Sang had escaped far away.  Confirming that no one was pursuing her, she paused, raising the demon corpse.</p><p>The situation was urgent; Qin Sang couldn't hold back.</p><p>Gui Hou was dead, his spirit severely damaged, only a remnant soul remained.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't bother with pleasantries, preparing to perform a soul search. Gui Hou, terrified, pleaded for mercy, revealing everything he knew.</p><p>"It really was self-imposed cultivation reduction…"</p><p>Qin Sang murmured.</p><p>Gui Hou explained that when they had previously encountered the Daoists, Lingyou Wang had warned them that they needn't fear a Da Zhenren.</p><p>The Da Zhenren had reduced his cultivation, falling to the Dongxuan rank.  Even without Lingyou Wang, the Yao Hou could form a demon array to escape.</p><p>Presumably, the Yao Wang would be no exception.</p><p>This relieved Qin Sang considerably; otherwise, she would have had to seriously consider snatching something from the jaws of a Yao Wang.</p><p>"How long have you been inside? Did Lingyou Wang discover anything?" Qin Sang coldly asked again.</p><p>Gui Hou answered truthfully. They had only recently entered the blue light sea; this was the second tremor they'd experienced.</p><p>Lingyou Wang seemed to have sensed something during the tremor and ordered an investigation.</p><p>Qin Sang, having learned Lingyou Wang's orders and combining them with the phenomena during the tremors, fell into thought.</p><p>After a moment, Qin Sang sealed Gui Hou's remnant soul, leaving it with the female demon.  She surveyed her surroundings and flew towards the source of the tremors.</p><p>…</p><p>The blue light sea surged with undercurrents.</p><p>Beyond the light sea, the winds howled.</p><p>The golden light rapidly faded. The nine primordial fetuses were far more ethereal than before, their power soon to be exhausted and vanish completely.</p><p>However, the primordial fetus formation had accomplished its task, its direction clear.  Groups of cultivators and demon cultivators converged.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the area indicated by the formation was sparsely filled with illusions, with large expanses of auspicious clouds.</p><p>When the old Daoist and Wan Zhenren arrived, they found two teams of Daoist court experts hesitating outside the area, including Ruoquan Zhenren.</p><p>The old Daoist immediately joined them, inquiring about the situation.</p><p>Ruoquan Zhenren worriedly said, "Those demons were well-prepared. Their speed of assembly far surpasses ours. I fear…"</p><p>"It's alright," the old Daoist looked around. "As long as we wait for one more comrade, our demon soldier formations will be enough to fight them."</p><p>Though they had self-diminished their cultivation, unable to retain their Dharma bodies like the demon kings, their troops far outnumbered those of Donghuan Zhenren, which was their confidence.</p><p>As they spoke, all the Zhenrens looked towards the front.</p><p>Even through the illusions, they could sense unusual fluctuations. The jade talismans in their hands emitted a faint glow, subtly resonating with the area.</p><p>Shortly after, another team of Daoist court experts arrived.</p><p>After a brief discussion, the Zhenrens summoned their troops.</p><p>In an instant, demon soldiers formed their ranks, banners like a forest, a dark, countless mass.</p><p>These demon soldiers were clearly elite troops. There were nearly twenty Zhenrens present, but the types of demon soldiers were few, most Zhenrens commanding only three to five types, many with the same kind.</p><p>Within the formations, altars floated, especially four that were particularly extraordinary, visibly denser than the others.</p><p>These four altars belonged to four great Zhenrens, with the old Daoist leading, the other three arrayed behind him in a line.</p><p>The other Zhenrens also summoned their altars, guarding the four great Zhenrens.</p><p>The altars' energies were interconnected. It was less a demon soldier formation and more an altar formation.</p><p>With several beams of talismanic light descending, the demon soldiers belonging to each altar were unified.</p><p>The old Daoist lightly flicked his whisk, taking Taiwei steps, chanting an incantation with each step.</p><p>It was as if he spoke with heavenly authority. With the incantations, the demon soldiers' energy involuntarily erupted, beams of energy shooting into the sky, forming dark clouds above.</p><p>Dark clouds pressed down upon the city.</p><p>Yet the demon soldiers grew even more excited, roaring incessantly, their voices shaking the heavens. The Zhenrens aided them with talismanic techniques.</p><p>‘Pop!’</p><p>With the final step, the dark clouds suddenly solidified, forming a black talismanic chart out of thin air, descending from the heavens.</p><p>The chart was the condensed energy of all the troops and seamlessly merged into the formation.</p><p>In an instant, black energy surged within the formation. The troops were no longer individual soldiers but a single entity, invincible!</p><p>"Heaven's purity, earth's spirit, soldiers follow orders.</p><p>Soldiers follow the seal, generals follow commands!"</p><p>The old Daoist flicked his whisk forward. The Zhenrens and demon soldiers responded thunderously. The black energy transformed into a giant sword, pointing forward, its interior vaguely showing the radiant altars.</p><p>In just a dozen breaths, the black energy sword effortlessly shattered the illusion, without losing a single soldier, appearing in the view of the Gui Fang State demon cultivators.</p><p>Stared at by dozens of demon cultivators, including the demon kings, the black energy showed no signs of weakening; its momentum even increased threefold.</p><p>Despite their numerical advantage, the demon cultivators all wore grave expressions. Several demon kings summoned their Dharma bodies without hesitation—flying birds and beasts, a chaotic scene.</p><p>‘Boom! Boom! Boom!’</p><p>Dharma bodies blocked the black energy sword. The demons braced themselves, ready for battle.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>Dark clouds obscured the sky. Blue demon lightning coursed through the clouds, striking directly at the Daoist army formation.</p><p>Below the black energy sword, a body of water formed.  Thick stone walls appeared out of nowhere in front, accompanied by dragon roars and tiger howls, strange fluctuations assaulting the formation.</p><p>Behind the demon king Dharma bodies and the demons, a scholar in white robes sat cross-legged in the air, seemingly oblivious to the changes around him.</p><p>His hands rested on his knees, one hand glowing with golden light, the other making a certain hand seal.</p><p>Within the golden light was half a token, with characters in the middle, but it was split in two, making the characters illegible.</p><p>With the scholar's movements, the golden light intensified, the golden token trembling as if about to leave his palm.</p><p>Seeing this, the old Daoist's face changed. He flipped his hand, revealing half a golden token in his own hand.</p><p>If the two halves were combined, one could see the character '敕'!</p><p>This was a Daoist court decree. During the Daoist court's heyday, some important decrees were issued through the Divine Court.</p><p>This decree was apparently never issued, having been kept in the Divine Court. It suddenly appeared a hundred years ago.  It was recently confirmed that some vestiges of the Divine Court remained. Through this token, one could still sense the Divine Court. The last conflict was over this token, each side obtaining a half.</p><p>At this moment, the old Daoist's half-token also shone with golden light.</p><p>The old Daoist tossed his half-token, forming a talisman with one hand, attempting to seal it.</p><p>The two halves were one. Sealing this half would stop the scholar and buy time.</p><p>The scholar coldly glanced over, snorting disdainfully, and flicked his finger towards the half-token!</p>
