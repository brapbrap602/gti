<h1>Chapter 1177: Sandie Pass</h1><p>Elder Ji nodded.  "Sandie Pass's location is crucial.  Currently, two cultivators are stationed there, but we're still uneasy. We hope you'll go to reinforce them and assist in operating the grand formation. Of course, Daoist Mingyue, if you have any difficulties, please feel free to mention them; we can discuss it."</p><p>"Do you have a general map of the front lines? I'd like to see the situation first." Qin Sang didn't directly agree or refuse, stating his requirement.</p><p>"Certainly."</p><p>Elder Ji readily agreed, taking out a jade slip and handing it to Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang activated his spiritual sense, carefully examining it.</p><p>The contents were simple; the so-called deployment map was quite rudimentary, but it contained everything Qin Sang wanted.</p><p>Currently, the two most important locations at the front lines, one east and one west, are Wangdong City and Shiqu Mountain.  The top experts of the Two Realms Alliance –  True One Daoist,  Tongyou Demon Lord, and others, including Senior Sister Qingjun – are divided into two groups, stationed in these two locations, establishing large camps.</p><p>Senior Sister Qingjun is currently at Shiqu Mountain.</p><p>Other important passes and cities also have Nascent Soul cultivators stationed, each responsible to one of these two main camps.</p><p>Because the Abyss of Sin has stretched the front lines too long, creating a confusing situation, the Two Realms Alliance has had to adopt this strategy.</p><p>Conveniently, Sandie Pass falls under the jurisdiction of Shiqu Mountain.</p><p>Several other passes similar to Sandie Pass exist, their importance second only to the two main camps.  The human race invited a demon king to assist, precisely to secure these key locations.</p><p>As long as these locations hold, even if other areas are lost, they can still withstand the Abyss of Sin's offensive, or even launch a counterattack.</p><p>Besides these, there's a pass in the far west, Hukou Pass, located in the most remote area, at the edge of the high plateau, essentially the gateway to the Heavenly Demon Hills.  Currently, it's guarded by the demon race.</p><p>The Abyss of Sin is well-prepared; the desert forces adjacent to the Skywalk Plateau were swept away long ago by the Abyss of Sin, and Hukou Pass also faces their threat.</p><p>The demon race doesn't want the Abyss of Sin to break through here, so King Yu has been vigilant.</p><p>After understanding the situation, Qin Sang thought Sandie Pass was a good choice and didn't request a change.</p><p>Elder Ji was delighted.  He immediately produced a pouch.  "This contains Golden Sinking Wood, and a sum of spirit stones. Please check them."</p><p>Qin Sang accepted and examined them.</p><p>Unexpectedly, this piece of Golden Sinking Wood was as thick as an arm. Golden Sinking Wood is the essence of a spiritual tree's heartwood; even a mature spiritual tree would rarely yield a thicker piece.</p><p>The Two Realms Alliance had invested heavily.</p><p>"I'll accept them without hesitation!"</p><p>Qin Sang readily accepted them.</p><p>Previously, to obtain cultivation resources, he had sold most of the treasures brought back from the Canglang Sea, except for the Demonic煞妖丹 and the top-grade demon cores and bones.</p><p>Although Nascent Soul masters wouldn't lack spirit stones, having more in this situation is always good.</p><p>"You have been fighting the Abyss of Sin for so long. You must understand them well.  Do you have detailed records? It would help me prepare."  Qin Sang's understanding of the Abyss of Sin was limited to what he had heard from Senior Sister Qingjun.</p><p>"Of course… even if you hadn't mentioned it, I would have given them to you.  Also, this is your identification token."</p><p>Elder Ji handed him a jade slip and a token.</p><p>Qin Sang then requested the transfer of Lao Ma Hou and other Thousand Mountain Bamboo Sea beasts to Sandie Pass, and Elder Ji agreed to all of them, although the Two Realms Alliance would handle the dispatch, so it would take a few days.</p><p>As for the disciples of the Demon Flame Sect, they are currently stationed at Shiqu Mountain with Senior Sister Qingjun.</p><p>Aunt Mei has probably already contacted the Azure Sun Demon Sect.</p><p>After further discussions, both parties reached an agreement.</p><p>Time was of the essence, so Qin Sang immediately took his leave from Elder Ji.</p><p>Traveling south from here, the land slopes downward, the view ahead unobstructed.</p><p>They could vaguely see that the distant mountains were getting lower and lower.</p><p>When they reached the second tier, Tan Yi'en exclaimed in amazement.</p><p>A sheer cliff, thousands of feet high, smooth as a mirror, with howling wind and snow.</p><p>Unless attacking from a few narrow passes, it's very difficult to feign an attack on such a cliff; even cultivators would find it troublesome.</p><p>Sandie Pass is still some distance from Shiqu Mountain, and Elder Ji was in a hurry, so Qin Sang decided to go to Sandie Pass first and then contact Senior Sister Qingjun.  After descending the second tier and traveling a considerable distance, he finally arrived at his destination.</p><p>Along the way, he encountered patrols, but showing his token ensured smooth passage.</p><p>…</p><p>Sandie Pass.</p><p>Several peaks layered upon each other, the terrain is perilous, a strategically important place.</p><p>There is no city here.  The Two Realms Alliance has set up a grand formation, with a mist covering tens of miles, preventing the Abyss of Sin from scouting.</p><p>Inside, there is no mist.  At the center stands a tall building, surrounded by neat rows of stone houses.</p><p>With no immediate battles, cultivators were resting in their quarters.</p><p>The core of the formation is in this tall building.</p><p>Two Nascent Soul masters were currently chatting leisurely in the building. One of them was from the Skywalk Alliance, his monastic name was Jinglin.</p><p>Another cultivator, a direct disciple of Master Chongyi of the Taiyi Danzong, named Si Di, achieved Yuan Ying stage a century ago.</p><p>Both are at the early Yuan Ying stage.</p><p>“Elder Ji sent a message earlier, saying we'd receive a helper. I wonder which demon king it will be?”</p><p>Daoist Jinglin looked forward to it.</p><p>Their expressions were calm, suggesting the battle wasn't critical, but reinforcements were always welcome.</p><p>“I hope it's not that black bear!”</p><p>Si Di snorted, seeming to have a conflict with the black bear, “Otherwise, my Yuejin Mirror might accidentally strike in the wrong direction!”</p><p>Daoist Jinglin chuckled, “Elder Ji wouldn't send someone who doesn't get along with us. Even if it were the black bear, it's only controlling the Cold Bell Array, so you wouldn't have to deal with it…”</p><p>Before he finished, a streak of light flew into the tower. Daoist Jinglin caught it, “They're here!”</p><p>They flew out of the tower, then with a flash of light, arrived at the edge of the array, seeing two figures standing outside. One wore a mask, exuding pure demonic energy, clearly a demon king.</p><p>“Hm?”</p><p>They exchanged glances.</p><p>They had heard of the demon kings of Tianyao Hill, even if they hadn't interacted with them.  This one was completely unfamiliar.</p><p>"I am Mingyue, the demon king of Qianshan Bamboo Sea.  You two must be Daoists Jinglin and Si Di?"</p><p>Qin Sang introduced himself, flicking his sleeve, and sending a token forward.</p><p>After verifying it, they let Qin Sang and Tan Yien inside.</p><p>"No wonder we don't recognize you, Daoist Mingyue.  We hear that a senior bamboo cultivator from Qianshan Bamboo Sea is very mysterious.  It's surprising there's another demon king."</p><p>Jinglin and Si Di were outwardly enthusiastic.</p><p>Qin Sang subtly noticed the disappointment in their eyes but didn't mind.</p><p>After some pleasantries, they invited Qin Sang into the tower for a detailed discussion. Tan Yien was taken to other accommodations by a Golden Core cultivator.</p><p>Before Tan Yien left, Qin Sang gave him the token.</p><p>If Tan Hao's acquaintance wasn't at Sandie Pass, Tan Yien would go to other camps to look for him.  With Qin Sang's token, he could move freely here.</p><p>******</p>
