<h1>Chapter 1040:  Retreat</h1><p>Chapter 1040:  Retreat</p><p>He who fails to plan, plans to fail.</p><p>Facing a Yuan Ying master, there’s no room for carelessness.</p><p>Qin Sang's first priority was to consider an escape route, should the treasure acquisition fail and provoke the Venerable Ye.  How could he avoid being hunted down?</p><p>Ming Wei and the life-saving talisman in her possession were the safest option. But the talisman might not offer complete protection; careful planning for its use was crucial.</p><p>“Friend Daoist means…?”</p><p>Ming Wei hesitated.</p><p>She wasn’t entirely convinced by Qin Sang's words.</p><p>A Yuan Ying master breaking the immortal barrier and traversing the trial realm seemed fantastical, unprecedented.</p><p>But Qin Sang’s cautious demeanor forced her to consider the possibility.</p><p>The cavern was a complex web of factions, including top experts like Xue Fu and Daoist Xiao Yun, each more dangerous than her.</p><p>It would benefit Qin Sang nothing to deceive her; it would be like cutting off his own arm.</p><p>Qin Sang turned, glancing at the cavern entrance. “Once Venerable Ye acts, others will be stunned, unable to react immediately.  Our only opponent will be him.  As long as we escape Venerable Ye, we're safe. Friend Daoist, stay hidden with the talisman.  Once I succeed, return and activate it…”</p><p>Ming Wei remained silent.</p><p>She understood that this plan meant Qin Sang would bear the brunt of the Yuan Ying master's wrath, while she only watched from afar.</p><p>If things went south, she could easily retreat; the danger to her would be minimal.</p><p>However, this would put her far from the Soul-Washing Liquid. She could only trust Qin Sang's abilities and put all her hope in him.</p><p>Ming Wei looked up, meeting Qin Sang's gaze. “Later, you won't just focus on yourself, grab your Soul-Washing Liquid, and leave, will you?”</p><p>“Since we’re defying Venerable Ye, what difference does one or two bottles make?  The talisman is in your hands; I'll naturally acquire a bottle for you. Otherwise, if you're enraged and break our agreement, leaving me with no way out, I'd be in a terrible fix. If you're still not convinced, I'll swear on my Dao heart."</p><p>The Soul-Washing Liquid was their shared goal, the reason Qin Sang trusted Ming Wei.</p><p>Against a powerful enemy, they had to stick together.</p><p>“Good! I hope you keep your word!”</p><p>Ming Wei knew the odds were stacked against them, that it was a case of too many monks and too little porridge.  Her hopes were already slim. Receiving Qin Sang's promise, she moved away from the cavern.  She noticed Qin Sang followed.</p><p>Noting Ming Wei's questioning expression, Qin Sang explained, "Venerable Ye surely knows the talisman’s function. We can't use it under his nose. If he stays put, we'll be trapped. We need to create a diversion…"</p><p>They searched the cavern walls for the most labyrinthine passage, one with multiple branching tunnels.</p><p>Qin Sang created a diversion, releasing several corpse puppets from his bag, sending them into the different tunnels to lie in wait.</p><p>Then, he flicked his sleeve, releasing nine miniature demonic banners!</p><p>For over a decade, Qin Sang had been trying to master a formation using these nine banners, and his efforts had borne fruit.</p><p>Ming Wei looked at the banners, surprised.</p><p>She sensed that these seemingly insignificant black banners were not simple. Her experience as the Venerable's follower surpassed that of any other cultivator at her level, yet she couldn't fully comprehend them.</p><p>They seemed like flags, yet also like magical treasures; they were strange.</p><p>Ming Wei knew this must be Qin Sang's secret.  She suppressed her curiosity and didn't ask.</p><p>‘Whoosh! Whoosh!’</p><p>The nine banners moved swiftly, forming a complex formation before Qin Sang. Black flames seemed to writhe on their surfaces.</p><p>Qin Sang examined the formation, sensing its power, then pressed his palm downwards.</p><p>‘Plop plop plop…’</p><p>The nine banners sank into the ground.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded to Ming Wei, then returned to the cavern.</p><p>Ming Wei, having guessed Qin Sang’s intentions, retrieved several puppets from her pouch and sent them into the depths of the tunnels. She held the talisman tightly, her eyes fixed on the sealing light barrier in the center of the cavern.</p><p>She gripped her hand, her mind taut.</p><p>Back in the cavern,</p><p>Qin Sang flew his sword into the throng of earth spirits, advancing rapidly.</p><p>The cultivators were besieging the sealing barrier.  The fate of the Soul-Washing Liquid would soon be decided.</p><p>Along the way, Bai emerged from his corpse puppet bag, exchanged a few words with Qin Sang, and then separated.  The cavern was in utter chaos; no one noticed Bai's true identity.</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>A sword blow sent a dirt spirit flying, breaking through the encirclement.</p><p>More dirt spirits swarmed in, their strength increasing the closer they got to the sealing barrier.</p><p>Qin Sang, alone with her sword, moved steadily closer to the barrier, finally able to make out the scene within.</p><p>A high platform stood in the center.</p><p>Its surface was carved with strange markings, like runes.</p><p>The platform was large, yet only four vials of Soul-Washing Liquid sat upon it, leaving the space seem empty.</p><p>Qin Sang examined it carefully, finding no mechanisms. She wondered how the liquid appeared there and where it came from.</p><p>The seal was unbroken; it wasn't time for a major battle yet.</p><p>However, the cultivators each harbored their own agendas, their positions carefully chosen, undercurrents swirling beneath the surface.</p><p>No one knew who was secretly allied with whom.</p><p>Without Elder Ye, things would certainly have escalated into a dramatic play of trust and betrayal.</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze swept across the assembled cultivators, pausing on Elder Ye.</p><p>Like Xue Fu and the others, Elder Ye was diligently attacking the seal, inconspicuous. No one would suspect a Yuan Ying master was among them.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't use her Sky-Eyed Butterfly to spy on Elder Ye, fearing detection.</p><p>Nevertheless, observing Elder Ye, she noticed some strange things.</p><p>Facing the dirt spirit army, Elder Ye always gave an impression of effortless ease. Although disguised, he inadvertently displayed an incredibly precise control over his true energy, making Qin Sang secretly apprehensive.</p><p>Behind Elder Ye,</p><p>Su Nu and the others formed a battle formation, grappling with the dirt spirit army.</p><p>Su Nu's eyes lacked excitement, filled with deep worry.</p><p>She didn't know how much chance Qin Sang had.</p><p>If Qin Sang fell at the hands of Elder Ye, she would have no hope left, only to await her own demise.</p><p>The long-bearded elder and his companions were already exchanging messages, fantasizing about the future, their tone relaxed, brimming with confidence in Elder Ye.  Hearing them, Su Nu forced a smile and deflected their comments.</p><p>*Boom! Boom!*</p><p>Sword energy, blade light.</p><p>Magical techniques, magical artifacts.</p><p>Attack after attack relentlessly struck the sealing barrier.</p><p>The barrier trembled incessantly, its light dimming, becoming thinner and thinner.</p><p>The cultivators stared intently at the Soul-Washing Liquid within, poised to strike.</p><p>Qin Sang chose not to get too close to the seal.  She remained at the outer edge, fending off dirt spirits while using her ebony sword to send waves of sword energy and light toward the seal.</p><p>Her attention remained fixed on Elder Ye.</p>
