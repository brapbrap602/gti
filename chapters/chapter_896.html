<h1>Chapter 888: Forbidden Ground</h1><p>The demonic primordial spirit nurtured by the sword soul had faint yellow light fluctuations on its surface, the lingering power of the jade Buddha.</p><p>The Yin and Yang Qi entered the Purple Mansion, paused slightly, then flew to the surroundings of the primordial spirit, slowly circling it, clearly visible.</p><p>“It works!”</p><p>The avatar opened his eyes, his expression shifting slightly.</p><p>After reading the incantation, he felt that the Yin-Yang Armor was extraordinary.  Later, after listening to the Daoist boy's teachings, he gained further insight. With his understanding, cultivating this basic incantation and applying it creatively wasn't difficult.</p><p>With a brief attempt, he successfully integrated the Yin-Yang Armor into his Purple Mansion without it dissipating.</p><p>This shows that the Yin-Yang Armor is not just external armor, but can also serve as protective armor for the primordial spirit.</p><p>The main body has the jade Buddha, so there's no urgent need for this type of primordial spirit protection spell that defends against attacks on the primordial spirit.  No matter how strong the armor, it couldn't compare to the jade Buddha.</p><p>Moreover, he suspected that the "Yin-Yang Heavenly Battle Secret Technique" was incomplete.  Later revisions of the cultivation method couldn't fully develop the Yin-Yang Armor's subsequent transformations, therefore it could not unleash its true power.</p><p>However, wearing the armor can conceal the jade Buddha's golden light, acting as a layer of protection.</p><p>Although even Nascent Soul Masters dare not easily separate their Nascent Souls from their bodies, the risk of exposing the jade Buddha is minimal. But nothing is absolute in the cultivation world. As his cultivation increases, the opponents he encounters will be increasingly powerful and their methods increasingly strange, and his knowledge will broaden.  Being able to conceal the existence of the jade Buddha is always a good thing.</p><p>This treasure is his biggest secret.</p><p>If seen by someone with malicious intent, it could bring trouble.</p><p>Once the main body cultivates a set of Yin-Yang Armor to cover the primordial spirit, the golden light can be hidden.</p><p>The fluctuating golden light emitted by the jade Buddha is too unique, and ordinary methods cannot conceal it. Only this peculiar armor formed by Yin and Yang Qi can perfectly mask it.</p><p>Compared to the "Yin-Yang Heavenly Battle Secret Technique," this most basic incantation pleased him even more.</p><p>The avatar suppressed his delight, rose, and left the stone chamber.</p><p>Gao Yi stood outside, glancing inside, and asked doubtfully, “Junior Brother Zhang has already refined the jade pendant, why didn't you call me?”</p><p>“I was worried about interrupting Senior Brother's important matters.  I could cultivate here just as well, so I didn't bother you.”</p><p>The avatar replied calmly.</p><p>“What important matters do I have? Let's go to the cave abode now, Junior Brother.”</p><p>Gao Yi chuckled, his impression of the avatar improving slightly.</p><p>The two left the stone hall together, activated their flying artifacts, and flew towards the mountain peak where the cave abode was located. Along the way, when they encountered fellow disciples, Gao Yi would introduce the avatar.</p><p>Gao Yi was only thirty years old, but he had been studying the art of refining with Jin Yan, his nature was uncomplicated. After being subtly flattered by the avatar, he considered him a confidant and enthusiastically arranged a cave abode for him.</p><p>After finishing all the matters, night had fallen.</p><p>The avatar's cave abode was on the mountaintop, with an excellent view. He looked up at the bright moon and stars, then glanced at the Lan Dou Gate, a slight smile appearing on his face, before turning to close the door.</p><p>For the next few days, the avatar stayed peacefully in Lan Dou Gate, refining the Yin-Yang Armor while trying to make more acquaintances.</p><p>He found an opportunity to leave the sect, contact the main body, and transmit the Yin-Yang Armor incantation while conveying messages.</p><p>Outside Lan Dou Gate.</p><p>Qin Sang found a desolate mountain, created a stone cave, and sat cross-legged inside, manipulating incantations.</p><p>With his cultivation level, cultivating this incantation was effortless. In less than an hour, two auras, one black and one white, condensed around him.</p><p>At this time, Qin Sang opened his eyes, swept his gaze, and softly shouted, “Condense!”</p><p>‘Poof!’</p><p>The Yin and Yang Qi collided violently, but the resulting fluctuations were perfectly suppressed by Qin Sang.</p><p>The two auras intertwined, as if mutually devouring each other.</p><p>Soon, a gray armor appeared on Qin Sang’s body, looking very ordinary, only with a Yin-Yang Taiji symbol on his chest, like the Yin-Yang disk of the old Daoist Huayang, gently rotating.</p><p>“Withdraw!”</p><p>Qin Sang shouted again, and the Yin-Yang Armor instantly disappeared into his body.</p><p>Simultaneously, a Yin-Yang Armor appeared around his primordial spirit in the Purple Mansion. The faint yellowish light emanating from the jade Buddha on the surface of the primordial spirit was now concealed by the Yin-Yang Armor.</p><p>“This armor is not powerful, its use is limited in high-level cultivator battles. However, it is sufficient to conceal the jade Buddha, a small achievement.”</p><p>Qin Sang murmured to himself, continuing to refine it for a while before shifting his focus.</p><p>“Even true disciples of the Yin-Yang lineage don't know about Dou Niu Peak's existence, it seems there are many secrets hidden within. Let the avatar continue the investigation.  I'll continue to contact fellow cultivators at the Nascent Soul stage as planned.”</p><p>Qin Sang made a decision in secret, his figure quietly leaving, heading straight towards the Lan Dou Gate market.</p><p>……</p><p>Lan Dou Gate.</p><p>All the disciples in the Stone Hall gathered in the largest chamber.  Master Jin Yan sat on the dais, calmly lecturing.</p><p>This was the monthly sermon, a reward for the disciples' hard work, where they could ask Master Jin Yan about cultivation and artifact refinement.  Huashan was among them.</p><p>Jin Yan, though seemingly rough, had a good temper, patiently answering every question.</p><p>After the serious lecture, the atmosphere relaxed.  Huashan, lost in thought, sensed something amiss. Turning, he saw a sturdy boy glaring at him, then raising his hand.</p><p>Huashan's expression shifted slightly; he smiled inwardly.</p><p>"Xiong Biao, what's your question?"</p><p>Jin Yan called on him.</p><p>Xiong Biao stood, "Master Jin, besides our Five Elements and Yin-Yang lineages, are there other true inheritors in our sect?"</p><p>Jin Yan frowned, "What kind of question is that?  How does it benefit your cultivation?"</p><p>"Zhang and I made a bet," Xiong Biao said, his face crestfallen. "He said there's a lineage called Douniu Peak, but we've never heard of it. He's definitely pulling my leg."</p><p>"Douniu Peak!"</p><p>Jin Yan's face changed, his gaze sharpening as he fixed Huashan. "Who told you about Douniu Peak?"</p><p>Huashan inwardly noted Jin Yan's knowledge.  A cultivator at the late Foundation Establishment stage, skilled in artifact refinement, and holding a prominent position in the Lan Dou Sect by occupying the Stone Hall – he certainly knew more secrets than an ordinary disciple.</p><p>Huashan intended to use Jin Yan as a starting point.  He'd chosen a naive boy to provoke him, and it worked.</p><p>Quickly thinking, Huashan stood, appearing terrified. "I heard Master Huayang mention Douniu Peak as a true lineage in Yanmiao Pavilion. After joining the sect, I couldn't find Douniu Peak, so I asked Brother Xiong…"</p><p>His abduction from Yanmiao Pavilion by Old Daoist Huayang was already known throughout the Lan Dou Sect, including to Jin Yan.</p><p>"Master Huayang…"</p><p>Jin Yan's expression softened slightly. After a moment of silence, he said, "Whether it's a true lineage or not, I don't know.  However, this place is now forbidden. Naturally, you haven't heard of it… From now on, no one is allowed to mention the words 'Douniu Peak', or you'll face my wrath!"</p><p>Jin Yan coldly snorted, and left with a flick of his sleeve.</p><p>---</p><p>---</p><p>Wishing you all wealth, wealth, wealth!</p>
