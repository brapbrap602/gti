<h1>Chapter 1335: The Soul-Trapping Cavern</h1><p>The crater had a name—the Soul-Trapping Cavern.</p><p>Everyone was waiting for it to open.</p><p>The sword-wielding Daoist was the most famous disciple of the Heavenly Dao Sect, his Daoist name was Xiao Yun.</p><p>The other person was equally influential, having close ties to the Demon Lord; his appellation was Blood Bat.</p><p>The two were rising stars of the righteous and demonic paths, their presence here unsurprising.</p><p>Time passed.</p><p>Dark mist swirled in the mountains, but it remained confined within the crater, held back by some kind of restriction.</p><p>Suddenly, a fluctuation appeared above the mist.</p><p>A Bagua-shaped barrier flickered into existence.</p><p>Seeing the barrier appear, the cultivators' eyes burned with intense eagerness.</p><p>Then, a tearing sound echoed, and five figures flashed into view before them.</p><p>"Eastern Extremity Alliance!"</p><p>Someone whispered, recognizing them.</p><p>These five were Su Nu and others; Venerable Ye was among them, but he wore a mask, concealed his cultivation, and stood quietly in the back.</p><p>Outside the crater's perimeter.</p><p>Qin Sang and Ming Wei waited not far apart.</p><p>He immediately saw Su Nu and felt surprised.</p><p>With Su Nu's strength, and aided by the other Eastern Extremity Alliance cultivators, passing the final trial was expected; but to enter the Soul-Trapping Cavern and compete for the Soul-Washing Liquid seemed a stretch.</p><p>However, with so many fellow disciples protecting her, even if she failed to obtain the treasure, her safety shouldn't be a concern.</p><p>Su Nu stood beside Venerable Ye, appearing weak and docile.</p><p>She furtively observed those around her; catching Blood Bat's cold gaze, she quickly averted her eyes, looking timid.</p><p>Currently, Qin Sang was without his mask and wings, his aura completely different. Su Nu's gaze glanced over him without a flicker of recognition, seemingly not recognizing the one who had saved her life.</p><p>Their arrival was perfectly timed.</p><p>The Soul-Trapping Cavern's barrier fully materialized, then opened eight entrances in all directions before their eyes.</p><p>'Whoosh! Whoosh!'</p><p>Instantly, the cultivators put aside their thoughts, their various escaping lights intertwining as they flew towards the nearest entrance.</p><p>Blood Bat and Daoist Xiao Yun were the first to enter the Soul-Trapping Cavern, disappearing into the dark mist.</p><p>Su Nu and the others were not far behind, entering together.</p><p>One entrance was close to Qin Sang.</p><p>Naturally, Qin Sang wasn't about to be left behind; he flashed to the entrance.</p><p>Just then, a cultivator in gray robes reached it simultaneously.</p><p>"Get lost!"</p><p>The gray-robed cultivator roared, unleashing a punch.</p><p>Qin Sang coldly snorted; a sword gleam flashed from his brow, instantly transforming into a spinning blade. Sword light, like a torrential downpour, pressed down on the gray-robed cultivator, who watched in shock.</p><p>Everyone here possessed considerable strength; this person was also quite influential, a direct disciple of a Yuan Ying cultivator, yet he was still somewhat inferior to Qin Sang.</p><p>He hadn't expected Qin Sang's seemingly weak aura to conceal such terrifying swordsmanship.  Startled, he retreated, his punch shifting to defend against the spinning blade.</p><p>Powerful punches, like thunder, filled the sky.</p><p>'Bang!'</p><p>The punch shadows vanished.</p><p>The gray-robed cultivator flew back, his right arm bleeding profusely; the sword wound was deep, almost severing his arm.</p><p>Qin Sang sheathed his sword, coldly glancing at the gray-robed cultivator. If not for the Soul-Washing Liquid, he wouldn't have let him off so easily.</p><p>Near the entrance.</p><p>Several other cultivators stopped, staring in shock at Qin Sang.</p><p>Someone recognized the gray-robed cultivator's identity, but no one knew Qin Sang's background.</p><p>The gray-robed cultivator was no match for him!</p><p>Qin Sang entered the Soul-Trapping Cavern, followed by a discreet Ming Wei.</p><p>Only then did the others dare move; the gray-robed cultivator regretted provoking such a formidable opponent, but understanding the importance of the task, hastily stemmed the bleeding and entered.</p><p>Entering the Soul-Trapping Cavern.</p><p>A chilling coldness washed over them, accompanied by faint, almost imperceptible sounds constantly assaulting their Purple Mansion, affecting their spirits.</p><p>Ming Wei walked alongside Qin Sang.</p><p>She produced a jade pendant and put it around her neck.</p><p>The pendant emitted a soft white glow.</p><p>Ming Wei breathed a sigh of relief, glancing at Qin Sang, who remained composed.  "Luckily, I have this pendant bestowed by the ancestor, which helps dispel distracting thoughts and calm the mind. It makes it much easier in the Soul-Trapping Cavern.  Daoist friend, have you cultivated any calming secret techniques that allow you to resist its effects without a treasure?"</p><p>Qin Sang smiled faintly, fabricating an excuse. "Qin cultivated a secret technique related to the spirit, providing some resistance to this kind of attack."</p><p>Whether due to the restrictions or the dark mist within the Soul-Trapping Cavern, it could disrupt the mind. However, with the jade Buddha protecting him, he felt no such effect.</p><p>Qin’s swordsmanship is truly exceptional! I’ve heard that top-tier swordsmen possess unwavering resolve and a clear, unwavering focus on their art, and you certainly prove that to be true!”  Ming Wei exclaimed repeatedly. “Before now, I’d never even heard of you, Qin.  How incredibly ignorant I’ve been!”</p><p>“My swordsmanship is still quite rudimentary; your praise is undeserved,” Qin Sang replied. This wasn’t false modesty. He hadn’t even mastered the fundamental sword stances, let alone achieved mastery.</p><p>“Let me lead the way down.  You focus on resisting the Soul Maze’s power. If I tire, we’ll switch,” Qin Sang suggested, glancing down.</p><p>They were falling rapidly, the Cleansing Soul Liquid hidden deep within the Soul Maze.  Unaffected by the maze itself, he could concentrate fully on other dangers, unlike Ming Wei, who needed to focus on maintaining her mental fortitude.</p><p>“Thank you!” Ming Wei readily agreed, relieved.</p><p>The Soul Maze was incredibly deep; their descent seemed endless.  Finally, Qin Sang felt his feet touch solid ground.</p><p>He surveyed the surroundings.  As far as he could see, it was a jagged, black wasteland of rock formations, eerily similar to the black mist above.</p><p>“Let’s find the entrance along the edge. Any of these caverns will lead to the final chamber,” Ming Wei said, her voice strained.</p><p>Sweat beaded on her nose; even with her jade pendant, the Maze’s effects were wearing on her.</p><p>They soon found a narrow passage, barely wide enough for two people to pass abreast. Qin Sang led the way.</p><p>Since entering the Soul Maze, the only danger had been the mind-altering effects. Yet, Qin Sang remained vigilant, his Ebony Sword held at the ready.  The moment he sensed something amiss, he instantly swung the Ebony Sword.</p><p>‘吱!’</p><p>A shrill, piercing scream echoed through the cavern. Qin Sang frowned slightly, dashed forward, and saw an earth elemental bisected by his sword, its body dissolving.  However, this elemental was much smaller than those encountered above, easily maneuvering within the narrow passage.</p><p>Suddenly, Qin Sang's expression changed. He yelled, "Go!" and gestured towards the Ebony Sword.</p><p>The sword hummed, unleashing a powerful wave of energy that ripped through the passage.  A swarm of earth elementals of various shapes and sizes erupted from the walls, their shrieks filling the air.</p><p>Qin Sang sprinted ahead, Ming Wei close behind, occasionally intervening to eliminate any stragglers and lighten his burden.</p>
