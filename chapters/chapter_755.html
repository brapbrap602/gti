<h1>Chapter 747: The Wood-Spirit Bees</h1><p>The Grand Shaman and the Demon Lord.</p><p>Two late-Yuan Ying cultivators, peak masters of the world, appeared together in the Seven Kills Hall, casting a pall over everyone. The good news was that the Demon Lord disappeared in a different direction from their destination.</p><p>Everyone's expressions varied, still affected by the Ta Yin Heavenly Ghost's divine light.</p><p>Only Qin Sang was unaffected by the divine light. “The jade Buddha seems to perfectly counter the Ta Yin Heavenly Ghost's divine light, so it had no effect on me.  However, being called the number one divine light of the Canglang Sea, it shouldn't be that simple. If I encounter the Demon Lord's disciples in the future, I should still be cautious.”</p><p>But his mood remained heavy, because the Ta Yin Heavenly Ghost's divine light vanished in the direction of the Heavenly Tower.</p><p>“I heard from Xiang Yi that the Demon Lord's appearance here was an accident, likely targeting the Witch Clan to restrain the Grand Shaman. With so many secret locations in the Seven Kills Hall, it's unlikely they'd coincidentally gather at the Heavenly Tower, right?”</p><p>Qin Sang mused, his gaze serious, but he could do nothing.</p><p>With so many top-tier experts entering the Heavenly Tower, even if he went there now, he couldn't change anything. It was better to wait for the Demon Lord and the Grand Shaman to leave before going in alone to investigate, avoiding being caught in the crossfire.</p><p>As for the ancient teleportation array, he wasn't too worried.</p><p>More than one Grand Cultivator had entered without discovering it.</p><p>Either its location is extremely hidden, or like the Purple Micro Palace's Sword Testing Hall, it has special restrictions outside, requiring specific conditions to be met; otherwise, even the most advanced cultivation would be useless.</p><p>Qin Sang suspected the latter was more likely.</p><p>In the Canglang Sea, only he and Qingzhu had cultivated the *Yuan Shen Yang Jian Zhang*.</p><p>With Qingzhu missing, only he could activate the ancient teleportation array.</p><p>…</p><p>The young man with the sword and Cui Ji, having recovered seven or eight tenths of their strength, were urged to get up.</p><p>Xiang Yi pointed towards the ancient forest at the edge of the wasteland and ordered them to set off.</p><p>The wasteland was very peaceful, without any danger.</p><p>After a burst of speed, they quickly arrived at the edge of the wasteland.</p><p>They hadn't noticed before, but upon approaching the forest, they realized the ancient trees here were excessively tall, even the smallest being over a dozen men wide.</p><p>The tree crowns blotted out the sun, the forest was dark, and strange sounds, emitting green light, could be heard intermittently—unclear whether they were from demonic beasts or something else.</p><p>Standing there, the ancient trees seemed to come alive, transforming into clawing giants, looking down on them and exerting immense pressure.</p><p>"After entering the forest, it's best not to fly."</p><p>Xiang Yi landed on the ground, his expression serious as he warned, "The forest not only has large areas of no-fly zones, some of these ancient trees are disguised living creatures. If you fly in the air and get entangled by vines, others may not be able to help in time, and you'll be instantly dragged into the depths of the forest."</p><p>"Living creatures?  Are they some kind of well-camouflaged demonic beast, or Wood Fiends? If they're Wood Fiends, Pan has a treasure that can perfectly counter this type of wood spirit."</p><p>The man wearing a half-mask said in a hoarse voice.</p><p>This man's surname was Pan.  Throughout their journey, he had been even more taciturn than Qin Sang, acting independently and barely interacting with others.</p><p>His proactive offer to deal with the Wood Fiends surprised everyone.</p><p>"I don't know."</p><p>Xiang Yi shook his head. "The living creatures here are incomparable to those outside; they cannot be measured as demonic beasts or wood spirits.  Even the spirit insects here are completely different from the outside world.  They've become like this due to some unknown influence; you'll see for yourselves soon enough. The Merchant Guild has prepared countermeasures for us; Daoist Pan's treasure can be used as a backup.  Just follow me, and you don't need to worry."</p><p>With that, Xiang Yi took out several pouch-like objects and tossed them to them.</p><p>Qin Sang took one, squeezed it, and found it seemed to contain some kind of medicinal powder. He put it to his nose, but couldn't smell anything.</p><p>"Wear these pouches. They contain powder made from a spirit flower. We can't smell it, but it's like a stench to the forest's ferocious insects, something they will avoid. It not only masks our scent, obscuring their perception, but will also make them stay away."</p><p>After Xiang Yi explained the pouches' use, everyone unhesitatingly hung them around their waists.</p><p>…</p><p>A quarter of an hour later.</p><p>Everyone hid under the sprawling root system of the ancient trees, not daring to breathe, only daring to peek out through the gaps in the roots.</p><p>Strangely, besides them and the ancient trees, there were no other living creatures.</p><p>They had now ventured deep into the forest; layers upon layers of branches and leaves in the high canopy blocked out the sunlight.</p><p>A buzzing sound approached.</p><p>“Woodlight Bees! Stay quiet, and don’t use your spiritual sense!” Xiang Yi warned through a mental message.</p><p>Everyone held their breath.  Soon, through a gap in the foliage, they saw a large mass of green light approaching.  Up close, it resolved into countless points of light, like a swarm of green fireflies.</p><p>A closer look revealed they were not fireflies at all, but vicious poison bees!</p><p>These bees had slender, translucent green bodies, even their wings.  They looked like jade, beautiful from afar, hence their name, Woodlight Bees.</p><p>But a closer look was less appealing.  Their appearance was terrifying, their stingers long and sharp, like demonic creatures, chilling the heart.</p><p>Woodlight Bees have incredibly sensitive senses. They can detect cultivators from afar through spiritual energy fluctuations, instantly becoming enraged.</p><p>Xiang Yi said that even a peak Golden Core cultivator was once surrounded by a swarm and perished without a trace. They are one of the most feared insects in the jungle.</p><p>Xiang Yi had somehow sensed their approach and they hastily hid under a tree root.  It wasn’t that they were truly afraid, but in this dangerous jungle, it was best to avoid trouble.</p><p>The Woodlight Bees drew nearer.</p><p>Qin Sang saw the bees clearly.</p><p>Even the Wu tribe cultivators couldn't explain the Woodlight Bees' origins.</p><p>Qin Sang, whose skill in insect control was at least equal to that of Wu tribe cultivators, frowned in thought, but couldn't find a single bee species that matched the Woodlight Bees.</p><p>The Seven Killers' Hall, isolated from the world, had seen unknown changes in its creatures; the Woodlight Bees being one example.</p><p>The buzzing continued as the Woodlight Bees flew past an ancient tree beside them.</p><p>Once they were gone, the group relaxed, silently leaving the tree root and quickly putting distance between themselves and that dangerous area.</p><p>Xiang Yi seemed very familiar with this area, heading in a clear direction. Except when forced to take evasive action, they moved almost directly forward.</p><p>The jungle was vast and varied. Despite their caution, they nearly stumbled into a field of carnivorous flowers.</p><p>They passed two small wooden houses, but the surrounding treasures had clearly been looted.</p>
