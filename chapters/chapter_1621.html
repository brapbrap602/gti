<h1></h1><p>As they spoke, the Sky-Shrouding Profound Formation enveloped Soaring Dragon Cliff, a black canopy expanding outwards.  Su Zinan and the others, sensing the shift, fell silent, their gazes lifting towards the heavens, intently observing the formation's transformation.</p><p>With their discerning eyes, they naturally recognized that the Sky-Shrouding Profound Formation was not simply meant to seal off the Taiyue Sect.  It was also capable of disrupting the Taiyue Sect's Protective Mountain Formation.</p><p>From the outside, the Sky-Shrouding Profound Formation seemed to permeate every space, embedding itself within the Taiyue Sect's Protective Mountain Formation. The two spirit formations practically overlapped, the black canopy clearly spreading within the Protective Mountain Formation.</p><p>Two distinctly different formations, which should have been mutually exclusive, were now perfectly fused, indistinguishable from each other.  Several key nodes of the Taiyue Sect's Protective Mountain Formation were either invaded, obscured, or outright destroyed by the Sky-Shrouding Profound Formation, its power greatly diminished.</p><p>This clearly demonstrated the profound ingenuity of the Sky-Shrouding Profound Formation. As a descendant of a Soul Transformation expert, Su Zinan's insight was second to none present.  Precisely because of this, he understood the immense difficulty of such a feat.  A strange glint flashed in his eyes as he secretly employed his divine abilities, attempting to deduce the formation's next change.  Despite the previous demonstrations, he found it surprisingly taxing.  Gazing at the white-haired elder with astonishment, Su Zinan's estimation of him rose another level.</p><p>The white-haired elder had clearly been plotting against the Taiyue Sect for an extended period, possessing intimate knowledge of their Protective Mountain Formation. Even for a grandmaster of formations, reaching this level of mastery would require immense dedication, bordering on impossible.</p><p>Moreover, sealing off the Taiyue Sect was merely the initial preparatory stage, not even the first step. They had yet to see any sign of the Formless Immortal Sect.</p><p>A single person, or even a large sect, could not accomplish this!  Unless the plot had been hatched long ago, meticulously cultivated over generations, gradually bringing the plan to fruition.</p><p>This was indeed something only a descendant of the Formless Immortal Sect would undertake.</p><p>"By my foster father's standards, Fellow Daoist has truly mastered the Dao of Formations.  I am in awe!"  Outside, Su Zinan always maintained a refined demeanor, never leveraging his status as a Soul Transformation descendant to bully others. He readily admitted his mistakes and offered genuine praise to those deserving.</p><p>No one could discern his cruel nature.</p><p>"I never imagined that besides Sect Master Yu and Elder Fan, the Heavenly Firmament Tower concealed another expert.  The Quyang Mountain branch of the Heavenly Firmament Tower holds little renown, and for Fellow Daoist to be hidden within it is a true waste of talent. In my opinion, Fellow Daoist's skill is enough to replace either of them.  If I hadn't accompanied my foster father in dealings with Sect Master Yu and Elder Fan, I would have thought one of them was masquerading, making sport of me."</p><p>The white-haired elder's subordinates all wore long robes to conceal their identities, but their origins were exposed the moment they clashed with the Taiyue Sect.  Su Zinan and the others, with their sharp eyes, finally recognized his background.</p><p>The Strange-Faced Man had clearly known the white-haired elder's identity all along, while the others were somewhat surprised, not expecting such a prominent figure from the foremost demonic sect.</p><p>The white-haired elder, skillfully manipulating the Sky-Shrouding Profound Formation, still had the composure to reply, "Fellow Daoist Su flatters me. Sect Master Yu and Elder Fan possess profound demonic arts, their Soul Transformation imminent. While I can only painstakingly excavate the ruins of the Formless Immortal Sect, seeking opportunities. The difference is clear."</p><p>His words also subtly hinted that he and Sect Master Yu and Elder Fan were not aligned.</p><p>The others understood.</p><p>The Heavenly Firmament Tower was not a monolithic entity. The hearts of demonic cultivators were unpredictable, and internal conflicts were more prevalent than in other sects.</p><p>If this person were in league with Yu and Fan, the Heavenly Firmament Tower could simply summon an ally and open the Formless Immortal Sect without such elaborate machinations.</p><p>Not only the righteous and Buddhist sects targeted the Formless Immortal Sect.  The demonic sects also reaped considerable benefits in the past, and the Heavenly Firmament Tower showed no mercy towards remnants of the Formless Immortal Sect.</p><p>Preventing the resurgence of the Formless Immortal Sect seemed to be the consensus among the major sects of the Central Plains, otherwise, traces of the Formless Immortal Sect wouldn't have been erased so thoroughly.</p><p>A remnant of the Formless Immortal Sect had actually infiltrated the Heavenly Firmament Tower, forming their own branch. The most dangerous place was indeed the safest.  The ancients were wise.</p><p>While the others conversed, the Sword-Bearer remained silent.  Clearing his throat, the Sword-Bearer said in a deep voice, "As far as I know, the sect master of the Quyang Mountain branch should only be at mid-Nascent Soul realm.  Judging by Fellow Daoist's divine abilities, your breakthrough was not recent.  Have you been hiding in the shadows all this time?"</p><p>"This old man is Zhu Wudao, the sect master of Quyang Mountain," the white-haired elder nodded.</p><p>The Sword-Bearer was surprised, "You've concealed yourself from Yu and Fan for so long?"</p><p>"My master passed down a few minor techniques, nothing worth mentioning," Zhu Wudao replied calmly, offering no further explanation.</p><p>A moment later, Zhu Wudao ceased his manipulations, allowing the spirit formation to evolve on its own.  Sensing the situation outside, he let out a long sigh, "With Fellow Daoist Mo personally taking action, there should be no worries!  The overall situation is settled. We should begin as well."</p><p>Pausing, Zhu Wudao recalled something and turned to the Strange-Faced Man, "Where is the Poison King now?"</p><p>The Strange-Faced Man calculated with his fingers, "The Cave Master and I laid a deceptive array outside.  If nothing goes wrong, he should be lured to the heart of the Savage Lands."</p><p>"Good. The Poison King alone can't cause much trouble!"</p><p>Zhu Wudao nodded. "As long as we divert the Poison King for a while, even if the emergence of the Formless Immortal Sect attracts him, it will be too late by the time news reaches Golden Jade Province. We have ample time."</p><p>...</p><p>As they conversed, the sounds of fierce battle already echoed from beyond Soaring Dragon Cliff.</p><p>'Dong!'</p><p>'Dong!'</p><p>'Dong!'</p><p>...</p><p>Suddenly, drumbeats resonated from within the Taiyue Sect.  The rhythm grew increasingly frantic.</p><p>This was no ordinary drum.  It seemed to emanate from the earth itself, commanding the mountains to tremble.  The drumbeats were deep and resonant, yet those who heard them clearly felt the urgent emotions they conveyed, their hearts shaken, a sense of suffocation gripping them.</p><p>With each resounding beat, panic spread throughout the Taiyue Sect.</p><p>This was the Taiyue Sacrificial Drum, situated atop the main peak.  It was personally constructed by the founding ancestor of the Taiyue Sect.  It was not a supreme treasure, but held immense significance for the sect.</p><p>The Taiyue Sacrificial Drum was only sounded during the most perilous moments for the Taiyue Sect.  Since the Taiyue Sect's rise to dominance in the Southern Province, the drum had not been heard for countless years.</p><p>Upon entering the Taiyue Sect, disciples were informed of the existence of the Taiyue Sacrificial Drum, but they had never heard its sound.</p><p>Once the Sacrificial Drum sounded, all members of the Taiyue Sect, regardless of cultivation level, immediately converged towards the main peak.</p><p>To worsen matters, night descended without warning.  The depths of the darkness seemed to harbor spectral processions, further amplifying the disciples' terror.</p><p>They all knew that something had befallen their sect, but they never imagined the calamity would originate from within.  Had their Protective Mountain Formation become mere decoration?</p><p>For a time, chaos reigned within the Taiyue Sect.  Streaks of escaping light flashed in all directions, converging on the main peak.</p><p>Unbeknownst to them, these individuals had become even more conspicuous targets.</p><p>The low-level disciples of the Taiyue Sect were utterly defenseless against the invaders.  Massacres unfolded, escaping lights extinguished in droves, punctuated by the occasional short, sharp cry.</p><p>Most, like the gate guards, died without a sound.</p><p>The invaders, not satisfied with slaughtering low-level disciples, unanimously shifted their attention to the Taiyue Sect's main peak.  The Taiyue Sect's experts reacted swiftly, the majority already gathered at the main peak, activating the formation.</p><p>At this moment, the Sky-Shrouding Profound Formation also covered the main peak, but the darkness couldn't completely submerge it.  Mysterious yellow light flickered there.</p><p>The Sky-Shrouding Profound Formation could only disrupt the Protective Mountain Formation; the main peak of the Taiyue Sect possessed its own independent formation.</p><p>However, the sealing power of the Sky-Shrouding Profound Formation was indiscriminate.</p><p>The main peak's formation was similarly enveloped in darkness, the yellow light appearing faint and dim. The anomalies here couldn't be seen from the outside, let alone transmit any messages.</p><p>"Where's that old ghost Chi?!"</p><p>Two streaks of light, one crimson, one white, abruptly appeared within the darkness.</p><p>The white light led, the crimson followed.</p><p>The crimson light belonged to the Wailing Spirit Cave Master.  His previous search had yielded little. He had assumed all the Taiyue Sect experts had fled into the main peak, but unexpectedly discovered a furtive figure.</p><p>Even better, this person had a grudge against him!</p><p>The white escaping light belonged to a burly man with a ruddy complexion.  Upon recognizing the Wailing Spirit Cave Master, his eyes widened in fury, "It's you!"</p><p>The Wailing Spirit Cave Master sneered, "When you clamor</p>
