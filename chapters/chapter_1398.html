<h1>Chapter 1390: The Missing Nascent Soul</h1><p>Chapter 1390: The Missing Nascent Soul</p><p>The energy of tribulation thunder is quite unique.</p><p>Once unleashed, it's difficult to conceal.</p><p>A spirit insect capable of manipulating tribulation thunder is incredibly attractive to any cultivator, even if the Sky-Eye Butterfly isn't much help in tribulation crossing right now.</p><p>If news of this gets out, it will inevitably lead to bigger trouble.</p><p>Qin Sang rarely lets the Sky-Eye Butterfly use its ability, partly for this reason.</p><p>The man in white naturally understood this as well.</p><p>Wielding tribulation thunder— unheard of.</p><p>The man in white was shocked and distraught, but more concerned about his own predicament.</p><p>If the other party hadn't revealed the tribulation thunder, there might have been a chance to negotiate; now, it's a fight to the death. The other party would never let someone who knows the secret of tribulation thunder live!</p><p>Just as the man in white expected.</p><p>After the Sky-Eye Butterfly's attack, the Nascent Soul puppet's offensive became even more ferocious, each strike deadly.</p><p>‘Boom! Boom!’</p><p>The Sky-Eye Butterfly was very excited, flitting around the battlefield, its movements graceful and elegant, but the tribulation thunder it unleashed was anything but gentle.</p><p>She'd been forbidden by Qin Sang from using the tribulation thunder for too long.</p><p>Finally, she could show off her skills!</p><p>With the Sky-Eye Butterfly targeting him, the man in white’s spirit body dared not show itself, and his controlled Rainbow Rat body was no match for the Nascent Soul puppet.  His body became tattered and torn.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>A piercing scream suddenly came from within the Rainbow Rat.</p><p>It seemed to be two voices.</p><p>Immediately afterwards, the Rainbow Rat's body convulsed, its expression contorted, its cries becoming increasingly shrill and sharp, clearly a sign of the Rainbow Rat's consciousness fighting back.</p><p>The Nascent Soul puppet remained unaffected.  The power of the puppet seal was pushed to its limit, like a black demonic shadow, extending a huge demonic hand to grab the Rainbow Rat.</p><p>‘Pfft!’</p><p>The Nascent Soul puppet's five fingers pierced through the Rainbow Rat's body, the puppet seal's power pouring in wildly, causing widespread destruction.</p><p>Blood sprayed out, instantly swept away by the violent winds around them, vanishing without a trace.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>Bones shattered.</p><p>The Rainbow Rat's eyes rolled back, the light in its eyes fading rapidly.</p><p>At that moment, a phantom figure suddenly floated from the top of the Rainbow Rat's head— the Rainbow Rat's spirit, ghost-like, shooting towards the heart of the storm.</p><p>The next moment, a bolt of lightning precisely struck the Rainbow Rat's spirit.</p><p>The spirit instantly dissipated.</p><p>The Rainbow Rat perished!</p><p>The Nascent Soul puppet, holding the Rainbow Rat with one hand, flew over to make sure no remnant soul escaped before carefully examining the corpse.</p><p>The Rainbow Rat's body was devoid of any life force.</p><p>In the fierce battle, the man in white's spirit body, besieged on all sides, had been destroyed.</p><p>But strangely, neither the Nascent Soul puppet nor the Sky-Eye Butterfly had found the man in white's Nascent Soul; it seemed to have vanished along with his spirit body.</p><p>The Nascent Soul puppet looked directly at the Rainbow Rat, its expression stiff, its eyes mechanically turning before retracting its hand, clutching an ice box.</p><p>The ice box was identical to those the man in white had thrown away on the deserted island.</p><p>However, the restrictions on this ice box were clearly extraordinary.</p><p>This was the only relic left behind after the man in white's spirit body dissipated.</p><p>Everything else, including his physical body, had been abandoned.</p><p>Only this was kept.</p><p>This suggests that the contents of the ice box were likely that Xuan Tian Palace treasure.</p><p>The Nascent Soul puppet, clutching the ice box, destroyed the Rainbow Rat's corpse, looked around. The traces of the battle had already been erased by the storm, leaving no hidden dangers.</p><p>The Sky-Eye Butterfly landed on the Nascent Soul puppet's shoulder.</p><p>One puppet and one butterfly quietly left.</p><p>No one knew that a great battle had taken place here, resulting in the deaths of a demon king and a Nascent Soul cultivator.</p><p>…</p><p>On the deserted island.</p><p>The two groups of experts were completely unaware of the deception.</p><p>Demonic flames spread across the air, causing the experts to stare.</p><p>Bi Fang, using its divine powers, its blood-flame feathers attached, displayed its determination to obtain the treasure, charging fiercely through the demonic fire.</p><p>Layers of demonic fire surged towards Bi Fang.</p><p>The blood-flame feathers withstood the demonic fire, appearing incredibly sturdy.</p><p>In a short time, the demonic fire couldn’t melt the blood-flame feathers.</p><p>Seeing this, Bi Fang's confidence increased, and it charged forward with all its might.</p><p>Unbeknownst to it, Qin Sang, distracted by sensing the Nascent Soul puppet, wasn't fully focused here.  He made a symbolic attempt to obstruct it a few times before giving up, merging his figure with the demonic flames, also charging towards the man in white.</p><p>Meanwhile.</p><p>Feng Shangshi and the Frog Fish, chasing each other, were now very close to the man in white.</p><p>In the pursuit...</p><p>The White-robed man, grievously wounded, presented a horrifying sight. His white robes were soaked in blood, his wounds shocking.  He stumbled, yet persisted.</p><p>The onlookers gasped at his tenacity.</p><p>But it was over.</p><p>Master Feng seized a momentary lapse by Wa Yu, forcing him back with a magically animated scroll.  He then redirected his magical weapon, unleashing a gust of wind that slammed into the White-robed man's back.</p><p>*Puff!*</p><p>The White-robed man, caught completely off guard, pitched forward, falling to the ground, motionless.</p><p>Master Feng's expression changed, a premonition of ill omen growing stronger.</p><p>Wa Yu dashed towards the fallen figure, vying for the body.</p><p>A fierce glint flashed in Master Feng's eyes as he delivered a powerful palm strike.</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>The green palm print struck the White-robed man.  His body shattered into pieces.</p><p>What followed caused both factions of experts to change color.</p><p>No nascent soul!</p><p>No spiritual essence!</p><p>Only scattered chunks of flesh.</p><p>Even the slowest minds grasped the anomaly.</p><p>*Puff!*</p><p>A shriveled pouch flew from the remains. In the ensuing scramble, it was forcibly opened, revealing worthless trinkets—no treasure!</p><p>"We've been tricked!"</p><p>The thought echoed simultaneously in everyone's minds, sparking furious anger.</p><p>So many demon kings and nascent soul cultivators gathered on this desolate island, only to be fooled by a severely injured man.  The news would bring ridicule upon the entire Northern Sea cultivation world.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Nascent Soul puppet was already intercepting the Rainbow Rat.</p><p>Qin Sang, through the puppet, learned the truth, expressing his amazement.</p><p>He initially suspected the Rainbow Rat of secretly stealing the treasure after leaving the island alone.  He never imagined it was the White-robed man who, even in desperate straits, could execute such a masterful deception.</p><p>Qin Sang hovered in mid-air, surrounded by demonic flames, observing the situation.</p><p>Both factions' experts ceased their fighting.</p><p>Master Feng and Bi Fang, without hesitation, turned and charged towards the deep valley, only to find the remnants of four jade pillars.</p><p>The incomprehensible question gnawed at both factions: How did the White-robed man manage to separate his nascent soul and vanish before their very eyes?</p><p>Bi Fang looked around, his eyes flashing menacingly.  A sudden realization dawned on him, and he coldly demanded, "Where is the Rainbow Rat?"</p><p>The demon kings exchanged uneasy glances.</p><p>They suddenly understood.</p><p>The Rainbow Rat had transmitted a message indicating the White-robed man's true location, then fell silent.</p><p>The Rainbow Rat possessed profound abilities; the mark left on the White-robed man couldn't be shed simply by separating the nascent soul.  As long as the Rainbow Rat remained, the White-robed man could easily be found.</p><p>But the Rainbow Rat had also vanished!</p><p>The demon kings exchanged another look, a ludicrous thought forming in their minds: Had they all unwittingly worked for the Rainbow Rat's benefit?</p><p>"Excellent work, everyone!  Feng admires your skill!"</p><p>Master Feng had reached the same conclusion, his laughter laced with mockery.</p>
