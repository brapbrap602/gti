<h1>Chapter 1644: The Illusory Fire Pool</h1><p>The avatar noted that this palace complex was at least as grand as the main Ice Palace, if not a more significant structure within the Fire Palace.  The Fire Rhinoceros Island's formations were unique, dividing the floating island into nine sections. Each fire dragon corresponded to a spiritual array hub, suggesting the Fire Palace layout mirrored the formations.  Beyond the undisputed central palace, the surrounding halls each served different purposes.</p><p>The avatar surveyed the area, finding no plaques or stone inscriptions. The ruins were extensive, making it impossible to determine the palace's original function.  </p><p>Looking ahead, the avatar hesitated only briefly before the Fire Jade Centipede darted far ahead. The avatar quickly followed, not lingering.</p><p>If the treasure was on Fire Rhinoceros Island, it was likely situated in the central palace of the Fire Palace, at the heart of the spiritual array, its energy replenished by a special formation – just like the ice disc. The treasure attracting the Fire Jade Centipede was also in the central palace.  The avatar decided to proceed to the central palace first, then consider searching elsewhere.</p><p>Passing through these palace ruins, the path opened into vast forests.  Not only were there Fire-蒲 trees, but also various similar spiritual plants, including many valuable and rare spiritual fire trees.  The Fire Jade Centipede wound its way, but consistently headed towards the central palace.</p><p>The avatar pressed on through the woods.</p><p>A river of lava blocked their path. The avatar estimated the distance; beyond the lava river should be the Fire Palace's central palace.  Indeed, the shadows of buildings began to reappear on the opposite bank, although scattered.</p><p>Reaching the other side and traveling further, the avatar discovered the buildings weren’t merely scattered, but reduced to ruins by a great battle.  The central palace was largely destroyed.  It was evident that the enemy's main force had attacked from the south, shattering that part of Fire Rhinoceros Island. The disciples of the Wuxiang Immortal Sect retreated repeatedly, the final battle occurring within the central palace.</p><p>'Rumble…'</p><p>A deafening roar echoed from ahead.</p><p>The sound originated from a lava waterfall, directly within the central palace area!  The avatar looked towards the source;  a chaotic swirl of blazing fire filled the area ahead of the ruins, pulsating with immense, turbulent energy.  This energy would indiscriminately attack any intruder. While not necessarily strong enough to kill the avatar, ascending the lava waterfall would create a considerable disturbance, revealing their presence. Thus, the avatar chose not to take this shortcut.</p><p>The view was filled with ruins.</p><p>The avatar’s expression grew more serious.</p><p>However, the Fire Jade Centipede's excitement mounted.  It wiggled its body, its speed increasing by a third, transforming into a golden streak as it darted through the rubble.</p><p>As expected, the central palace was the core of the Fire Palace. The original density of buildings rivaled that of the Ice Instrument Palace.</p><p>Moving swiftly among the ruins, the avatar looked around, searching for remnants of the Fire Palace's great formation.  Deduction of the formation's eye from these remnants would be the most efficient approach.  Unfortunately, the destruction was too severe; the avatar searched for a considerable time without finding a discernible pattern.</p><p>The sound of the lava waterfall intensified.</p><p>The avatar even saw splashes of fiery lava in the air.</p><p>At that moment, the constantly flitting Fire Jade Centipede paused.</p><p>A thought sparked in the avatar's mind; they darted to the centipede's side.  Before them stood a jade carving of a fire dragon, imposing in stature, soaring amidst flames, its scales shimmering with fiery red light, enhancing its majestic presence. Sadly, the dragon's head and tail were broken, leaving only a scarred torso.</p><p>Behind the sculpture was a nine-tiered jade staircase. Above the staircase lay a ruined palace, its roof damaged, the interior fully exposed, revealing hints of ornate carvings on the walls. The layout indicated the fire dragon sculpture was more akin to a guardian spirit beast before the entrance.</p><p>The Fire Jade Centipede fixated on the dragon.  To be precise, on one of its claws. Only two claws remained; one was raised in the air, the other rested on a carved flame base. The centipede was focused on the latter.</p><p>The avatar was still observing the palace behind the sculpture when, without any sign of aggression, the Fire Jade Centipede unexpectedly charged at the dragon's claw.</p><p>An unexpected scene unfolded.</p><p>The instant the centipede struck, the claw turned translucent.  A hole appeared on the flame base, emitting a red glow, resembling the entrance to a lava well.</p><p>Seeing the Fire Jade Centipede's reckless actions, the avatar was initially ready to counteract any sudden event with a spell, but upon witnessing the sight, they paused.  "This… Does the Fire Palace also have a hidden chamber?"</p><p>As thoughts raced through their mind, the Fire Jade Centipede vanished.</p><p>The avatar followed.</p><p>The ancient well was deep.  The deeper they went, the brighter it became.</p><p>The figure discovered an ancient well whose walls were covered in strange runes, clearly a place filled with restrictions, yet they did not attack him or the Fire Jade Centipede.</p><p>He memorized the restrictions, studying them until he gradually understood.  These restrictions had no offensive function.  </p><p>Combining this with the exterior fire dragon sculptures, the figure deduced that they were used to draw in the abundant geothermal energy from outside, channeling it to the bottom of the well.  There were certainly more than one of these fire dragon sculptures; the place where their energies converged must be extremely important.</p><p>This discovery filled the figure with quiet joy.  Gathering fiery energy – wasn’t that similar to the ice platform in the Ice Instrument Palace?</p><p>After descending an unknown depth, he finally reached the bottom, but it wasn't the end of the well.  Another passage led forward. After traveling a short distance, he reached the end, where a stone door blocked the way.</p><p>The door was ajar.  Through the door, the figure sensed an extraordinarily intense fiery energy within, and the Fire Jade Centipede became even more lively and excited.</p><p>The figure gestured slightly.  The Fire Jade Centipede was restrained, much to its annoyance. Ignoring its protests, the figure focused his mind, wielding the Snow-Treading Divine Blade to push open the stone door.</p><p>'Creak!'</p><p>The door opened. A wave of intense heat surged forth.  The figure narrowed his eyes, discovering a vast underground palace beyond, its interior ablaze with red light, with rows of railings carved from fire jade.</p><p>It was noteworthy that the ground was in disarray, littered with corpses.</p><p>"In a place like this… how could corpses be preserved until now?"</p><p>The figure was puzzled.  Upon closer inspection, he realized they were not the remains of cultivators, but the shattered remains of peculiar jade puppets.</p><p>Entering the palace, the figure immediately heard the sound of jade scraping and colliding. His gaze sharpened as he followed the sound, seeing a puppet rise not far away, its two fire-date-like eyes fixed on him.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>A blast of hot air hit him. The puppet vanished in place, leaving streaks of afterimages in the air; its speed was astonishing.</p><p>Unfazed, the figure swung his blade.  In an instant, several cold beams of light crisscrossed the air, chillingly sharp.  The puppet seemed to deliberately collide with the blade light, shattering into several pieces that scattered on the ground.</p><p>Unexpectedly, before the figure could sheathe his blade, a red shadow flew from the center of the palace, landing on the ground. The pieces instantly reassembled, and the puppet, fully restored, lunged again.</p><p>The figure's eyes darkened, his pupils turning abruptly white.  He raised his hand, unleashing a torrent of chilling glacial light that froze the puppet into an ice chunk.</p><p>Approaching the ice, after examining it, the figure said, "So that's it."</p><p>These puppets were a type of talisman puppet, different from those of the Shangyuan Qingjing Palace.  Inside each puppet was a core talisman seal; as long as the seal remained intact, the puppet could be reborn – quite ingenious.</p><p>The energy that revived the puppet was that red shadow.</p><p>The figure took a step forward, approaching the railing to survey the entire palace.  There were eight stone doors on all four sides, confirming his earlier guess – each corresponding to an outer sculpture. However, several of the stone doors were smashed, and the restrictions severely damaged.</p><p>Around the palace were concentric corridors that extended downwards, leading to a square spirit pool at the very bottom.  The spirit pool was less than half the size of the palace, and the fiery energy drawn into the palace was entirely concentrated within it, incredibly dense. The figure had to focus his true essence into his eyes to see through the solid-seeming light and discern the true scene within the pool.</p><p>The fiery energy had condensed into a pool of flowing fire. After ten thousand years, it had undergone an unknown transformation; the extraordinarily pure flowing fire had turned golden.</p><p>Beside the spirit pool stood a short stele inscribed with five large characters:  'Flowing Fire Illusionary Pool'.</p><p>"Flowing Fire Illusionary…"</p><p>The figure murmured the words, his gaze shifting upwards.  He saw shadowy figures within the golden firelight.</p><p>These figures were bound by an invisible restriction, crowded together, confined to the area corresponding to the Flowing Fire Illusionary Pool.  The figures closest to the pool were golden, gradually turning reddish and weakening in energy as they ascended, creating distinct layers.</p><p>These layers corresponded to the concentric corridors. Each corridor had extending platforms; though lacking cushions, they were clearly meant for cultivators to meditate and control the figures within.  The higher the cultivation level, the closer to the pool the platform.</p><p>"It seems to be a place for artificially cultivating spirit apparitions…"</p><p>The figure examined the figures, realizing they resembled fire spirits. But unlike naturally occurring fire spirits, their eyes were vacant.  They were passively bound by the restrictions above the Flowing Fire Illusionary Pool, behaving lifelessly, lacking any desire for freedom or escape from their confinement; they were virtually inanimate, even the golden figures closest to the pool.</p><p>Thinking back to Fu Kui's earlier performance, it was only when Chi Ying and Fu Kui merged that they were imbued with the will to fight.</p><p>This was highly unusual, a deliberate outcome engineered by the creator of the Spirit Pool.</p><p>The fire spirits, of course, had many uses beyond merging with Fu Kui.</p><p>These fire spirits were easier for disciples to subdue and cultivate their consciousness using secret techniques, significantly reducing the possibility of betrayal.  Furthermore, the Spirit Pool's restrictions were incredibly profound; its potential was arguably no less than naturally occurring fire spirits.  Remarkably, they could be mass-produced, one for each person.</p><p>Every detail showcased the astonishing foundation of the Wu Xiang Immortal Sect.</p><p>While Hua Shen marveled, he was also quite disappointed. This was far from what he had expected.  The Fire Jade Centipede wasn't attracted to treasure; it was attracted to the fire spirits.</p><p>Fire spirits are born from the purest essence of crimson flames.  Their most valuable trait was their nascent sentience, allowing them to be consumed directly without fear of backlash.  They were undoubtedly highly nutritious, explaining the Fire Jade Centipede's eagerness.</p><p>Hua Shen removed his restrictions.</p><p>The Fire Jade Centipede, already impatient, fearlessly charged into the swarm of fire spirits, ignoring the impact of the crimson flames in the pool.  Starting from the top layer, it burrowed into a crimson fire spirit.</p><p>The fire spirit quickly withered and vanished.</p><p>The Fire Jade Centipede reappeared, its aura noticeably enhanced.  Without hesitation, it lunged towards another.</p><p>The fire spirit swarm stirred; lacking intelligence, they didn't attack en masse. Only the attacked spirit instinctively fought back.</p><p>But the Fire Jade Centipede was already a fourth-stage spirit insect; this level of counterattack couldn't harm it.</p><p>Hua Shen watched the Fire Jade Centipede's rampant hunting, then shifted his gaze to the Flowing Fire Illusionary Pool.  "What a waste. The crimson flame essence here has accumulated for millennia; it's incomparable now.  If my main body were here, I could have gained significant benefits.  By the time I return from Di Shou Mountain, I wonder if it will still be here…"</p><p>He hadn't forgotten his mission.</p><p>However, despite several attempts, the Fire Jade Centipede was engrossed in its feast, refusing to stop until it was completely satiated, showing no interest in other treasures and no intention of continuing its search.</p><p>Hua Shen sighed inwardly, "Does this mean the fire-attribute treasure isn't here? Otherwise, the Fire Jade Centipede wouldn't behave like this."</p><p>Letting it eat its fill, Hua Shen began his own work.</p><p>Although he hadn't found the treasure, the underground palace's restrictions were largely intact. Hua Shen noticed some restrictions weren't native to the palace, likely part of the Fire Phase Hall's formation.  He planned to deduce the location of the formation's eye from this.</p><p>Even Qin Sang, despite his considerable skill in this area, expended immense effort to gradually discern the pattern and follow the flow of the formation.</p><p>…</p><p>While Hua Shen was busy,</p><p>in an unknown valley,</p><p>a mountain wind blew, shifting light and shadow, and three figures suddenly materialized – the Poison King and his two companions.</p><p>"This should be where the final confrontation took place…"</p><p>The Poison King surveyed the surroundings, his gaze fixed on the valley, his tone certain.</p><p>Drawn by the anomaly at Bing Yi Palace, they rushed here.  Along the way, they discovered traces of a battle, leading them to the valley.  Crucial information had been deliberately erased, but the remnants indicated both sides were powerful.  </p><p>In fact, there were no weaklings left in the遺府.</p><p>"Three people! One side had help, the other fought alone. The outcome doesn't seem good!" Fan Lao Mo concluded.</p><p>But Master Huai Yin had a different opinion.  He had kept his eyes closed, his aura steady, as if in meditation.  Suddenly, his nostrils twitched, and he opened his eyes, saying, "Something's amiss.  Both sides might have been a single person.  Those two auras are distinct yet seem connected."</p><p>Master Huai Yin's spiritual perception was extremely sharp; he detected subtle differences, approaching the truth.</p><p>This was the battlefield of Su Zi Nan and Yan Shan Lao Ren.</p><p>After Su Zi Nan succeeded, he attempted cleanup, but preoccupied with the opportunity at the Immortal Palace and distracted by the Bing Yi Palace anomaly, his efforts were incomplete.</p><p>He overlooked some clues, which Master Huai Yin noticed.</p><p>The Poison King trusted Master Huai Yin's abilities, "Master, do you mean spirit slaves, puppets, or a clone?"</p><p>Fan Lao Mo's eye twitched; he sneered, "Old monk, look closely.  That person's opponent wasn't weak. If he was truly alone, relying solely on himself… Humph…"</p><p>They couldn't reach a conclusion.</p><p>The Poison King shifted his gaze to the northeast, where the sky glowed crimson and the shadow of a floating island was faintly visible. He said softly, "They have a longstanding feud.  Are they vying for something?"</p><p>"The battle's over.  Any treasure won't be yours!"</p><p>Fan Lao Mo coldly snorted, pointing at Di Shou Mountain, impatiently saying, "There's movement in several places on the mountain; people are clearly ascending.  The pillar of light anomaly erupted nearby. If we delay any longer, only scraps will be left!"</p><p>The Poison King also saw the anomaly on Di Shou Mountain and hesitated, "That floating island's flames have blocked the sky for millennia.  Toxic fire essence must have accumulated, which would greatly benefit me.  Why don't you two go ahead? I'll gather the toxic fire and meet you on the mountain."</p>
