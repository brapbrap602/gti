Chapter 126 Trial of the Gourd of Fate

Since there were no distractions, double cultivation was a possibility.
As Zhuang Yan had said, cultivators fought for the slightest chance of transcendence, and having originally planned to offer the strange orchid in exchange for an opportunity to overcome the Core Formation period, he naturally couldn't miss this chance.
After asking Zhuang Yan, Qin Sang learned that the Gourd of Fate had been passed down by an ancestor of Mount Shao Hua, a Dharma treasure named 'Gourd of the Red World'.
Currently, it was controlled by a Golden Core cultivator named Che Yu Tao.
This Dharma treasure had an ability called the Trial of the Gourd of Fate, which could influence the soul and evoke the inner demons of the heart.
Since the Dharma treasure could be controlled, if the person entering the treasure had trouble extricating themselves and was about to go astray, all that was needed was to throw them out of the Gourd of the Red World, and they would likely wake up.
It was relatively safe, and could even be used to train a disciple's willpower.
If one could pass the Trial of the Gourd and experience the suffering of refining one's heart, it would greatly benefit their willpower.
Thus, even without the lure of dual cultivation, everyone was unlikely to pass up the chance of entering the Gourd of Fate.
The Trial of the Gourd of Fate only tested one's willpower. If one was below the Core Formation period, the influence of their cultivation level could be ignored.
The requirement for this test was to stay inside the Gourd of the Red World for three days, which showed how difficult it was. Only those with extremely strong willpower and unwavering determination could pass.
Qin Sang considered the fact that with the Jade Buddha's help, he had been undisturbed by the Three Disasters Heart Devouring Formation, so spending three days in the Gourd of the Red World shouldn't be too difficult.
However, the Trial of the Gourd of Fate was only the first layer, and the Jade Buddha could only protect his soul; it wouldn't necessarily be able to help him overcome the other trials.
It wouldn't hurt to try.
After Qin Sang continued to ask more questions, he left Dao Men Peak under Zhuang Yan's envious gaze. He boarded the Sky Shuttle and flew swiftly towards Mount Shao Hua in the depths of the sect.
The summit of Mount Shao Hua was where the Nascent Soul ancestor Dongyang Bo was in secluded training, and as such was a forbidden ground. Qin Sang had only seen it from afar, but now that he drew near, he was shocked by the grandeur of Mount Shao Hua.
The tall and majestic mountain towered over the clouds.
It seemed to pierce the heavens and hold the sun in its hands!
Qin Sang didn't dare to be careless here. Before reaching the mountain, he lowered the Sky Shuttle as low as it could go and flew almost along the surface of the water. He gazed at the holy land, then noticed that there was a seemingly endless stone staircase at the foot of the mountain ahead. Halfway up the mountainside, there was a dozen zhang high, white jade archway.
The archway had the words 'Mount Shao Hua' carved on it in silver strokes.
The iron strokes were like silver hooks, and the sword intent was profound.
This place was the true entrance to Mount Shao Hua.
Qin Sang retracted the Sky Shuttle and landed on the stone steps. He patted the non-existent dust off his body, and ascended the steps. Having climbed just a few steps, he suddenly heard a deep and powerful interrogation.
"Who goes there?"
Qin Sang looked around and saw no one, but his heart was secretly shaken. He hurriedly bowed towards the void and said, "Disciple Qin Sang has received the sect master's decree. My age, cultivation level, and purity all meet the requirements. I have come to experience the Trial of the Gourd of Fate. If I have offended you, please forgive me, senior."
There was silence.
"Come in."
Qin Sang felt his vision go blurry, and then discovered that the scenery before him had changed drastically. He found himself in a completely strange hall.
There was an elevated platform in front of him on which was placed a red gourd. The front of it faced the hall's entrance.
The red gourd was only the size of two fists, and its mouth was open. Seven-colored light burst out of the gourd and surged indecisively at the gourd's mouth.
Just when Qin Sang appeared, the red gourd suddenly flashed with light and the radiance grew stronger. Then, a person was spat out.
This person fell to the ground in embarrassment. His face was covered in sweat, and his cyan-colored Daoist robe was soaked through and clung tightly to his body. His expression was full of confusion, and his eyes were dull, but there was a deep anxiety in them. He still seemed to be muddled, and he looked very comical.
When he saw this person's cultivation level, Qin Sang didn't dare to even faintly smile. He hurriedly moved to one side and stood with his hands folded together, motionless.
This person was actually a cultivator from the Core Formation period.
"Junior Brother Feng, wake up!"
Someone yelled loudly in the cave.
The person on the ground suddenly trembled violently, as if he had just awoken from a dream. His eyes quickly regained their clarity, and he stood up from the ground. A slight light passed over his body, wiping away the sweat and dust, and he regained his Xian wind and Dao bone appearance.
"Thank you, Sect Master, for your timely warning." The man bowed to the three people standing next to him and said, "I don't know this, but how long was I in the Gourd of the Red World?"
One of the three was an old Daoist with a goatee. He had a lean face and his eyes were very bright. With a whisk under one arm, he exuded the air of one who was unworldly. This was the current sect master of Mount Shao Hua, Yu Xin.

When the monk surnamed Feng was questioned, Master Yu said: "Junior Brother Feng has been holding on for one whole day, which is extremely rare. Judging from Junior Brother Feng's expression, he must have gained a lot?"

The monk surnamed Feng bitterly smiled and said somewhat sadly: "An old dream is hard to wake from! Please escort me down the mountain, Senior Brother."

When the monk surnamed Feng had disappeared, Qin Sang hurriedly walked out, paid his respects, and said in salutation: "Disciple Qin Sang pays respects to the Master and two uncles."

Master Yu waved his whisk and dotted drops of spirit force like starlight onto Qin Sang's body.

"Hmm, your Yuan Yang hasn't leaked, it meets the requirement. Alright, walk in front of the Red Dust Gourd and it'll suck you into the rosy light."

Qin Sang walked up to the dais as instructed by Master Yu and a rosy light flashed abruptly before his eyes, then he fell into a seven-colored space. Qin Sang stole a glance and discovered that streaks of seven-colored rosy light, dazzling and radiant, were permeating the space above.

Beside him sat dozens of figures, some were Foundation Building uncles and others were Qi Refining senior brothers, each of them had a rosy light entwining them, silently sitting there, motionless. The surroundings were deathly quiet without a sound.

At that moment, Qin Sang only felt his body suddenly heavy. He was pressed onto the ground by an unknown colossal force, and then an unnatural movement occurred in the rosy light above. It darted toward Qin Sang "swoosh" like a spirit snake.

Qin Sang inwardly knew that the Heart Refining Tribulation was likely to begin, and hurriedly sat upright in meditation.

Qin Sang didn't have any feeling when he was entwined by the seven-colored rosy light. He introspected and discovered that the seven-colored rosy light had invaded his body. A strange fluctuation appeared in the space of his Primordial Spirit that was blocked firmly outside by the layer of faint yellow light formed by the Jade Buddha.

When he saw this, a thought suddenly appeared in Qin Sang's mind.

What induced their own Inner Demons was external forces, be it the Three Calamities Soul Devouring Formation or the Red Dust Gourd. But if he managed to break through to the Core Formation stage, would the Inner Demons also be induced by an external force when facing the real Heavenly Tribulation during Nascent Soul Formation?

If he let them in and he had already been affected, would the Jade Buddha still be able to help him overcome it when he was already trapped in the Inner Demons?

Unexpectedly, the light on the Jade Buddha suddenly wavered when his thought had just appeared. This was a sight Qin Sang had never seen before and he couldn't help but be greatly alarmed.

Immediately after, those fluctuations were actually released by the Jade Buddha into Qin Sang's Primordial Spirit where they began to invade.

The scene before Qin Sang's eyes suddenly changed.

High-rises, heavy traffic, and a dense sea of people.

His world from his previous life!

He saw the house which he bought for his parents in his previous life and couldn't help but take a deep breath and walked towards that direction.

He was filled with expectation but his mind was also extremely clear.

As though he was a spectator watching a movie, he could leave at any time.
