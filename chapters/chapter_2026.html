<h1>Chapter 2017: A Glimpse of Beauty</h1><p>“My senior’s sharp eyes have seen through me,” Qu Zhen replied respectfully. “It is indeed related to the Sword Pavilion. We were fortunate enough to discover a hidden place, very likely a fragment of the ancient Sword Pavilion, and it remains untouched. However, it’s extremely dangerous inside, so we haven’t dared to explore further.  I wonder if you, senior, would be interested?”</p><p>Qin Sang looked at Qu Zhen, his expression deep. “I don’t know you, and yet you dare to reveal these secrets and invite me to explore the ancient Sword Pavilion with you. Aren’t you afraid I’ll take all the treasures and leave you empty-handed?”</p><p>“There are three reasons for inviting you, senior,”</p><p>Qu Zhen remained calm, unfazed by Qin Sang’s near-threatening words.</p><p>“First, we have been exploring that place, trying to obtain the treasures without outside help.  Unfortunately, our strength is insufficient, and we’ve suffered repeated defeats, losing several companions.  More and more experts are being drawn to the Sword Pavilion fragment. If we delay any longer, the place will inevitably be discovered and taken by others. It’s better to offer it to someone we can trust than to let others seize it. After our last unsuccessful attempt, we decided to seek help from a powerful cultivator after returning to the Jade Gate Pass.  We happened to meet Elder Qin.”</p><p>“Second, we’ve accepted the truth – treasures belong to those worthy of them.  Elder Qin, even if you take the lion’s share, you surely won’t mind sharing some of the spoils. With the ancient Sword Pavilion's resources, even a small fraction would benefit us immensely.”</p><p>“Third, we are not entirely unprepared. The Five Elements Alliance has a good reputation throughout  Dezhou.  Senior, as an elder of the Alliance, you are surely a person who values your reputation and are more trustworthy than others. Furthermore, we can be of use to you, Elder Qin.”</p><p>This speech was polite and measured. However, Qin Sang didn’t believe that Hengsha could stay in the Jade Gate Pass for so many years without finding other cultivators at the Void Refinement stage. He said noncommittally, “Take me there.”</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>Qu Zhen led the way.</p><p>Qin Sang slowed his speed, following Qu Zhen and listening to his description of the Sword Pavilion fragment.</p><p>He had personally visited the Purple Micro Palace and the Seven Kills Hall among the five Sword Pavilions of the Storm World. He also had some understanding of the Heavenly Concord Palace and the Heavenly Aspect Palace in the Central Plains, through his interactions with the Ganlu Zen Monastery and the Eight Scenic Spots.</p><p>After Qu Zhen's detailed description, Qin Sang tried to find a match in his memory, but he still couldn’t determine which Sword Pavilion the fragment belonged to.</p><p>As they continued deeper, Qu Zhen’s pace slowed, his movements increasingly cautious. In this area, even Nascent Soul cultivators rarely traveled alone and usually went in groups.</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang cast a protective aura around Qu Zhen. Qu Zhen tensed momentarily, then bowed deeply. “Thank you, Elder Qin, for your protection.”</p><p>With Qin Sang’s protection, Qu Zhen’s speed immediately increased. After traveling a short distance, Qin Sang suddenly stopped him. “Wait.”</p><p>Then, Qin Sang gestured for Qu Zhen to stay put. He looked around, flying toward a certain illusory scene.</p><p>Qu Zhen didn’t know the reason, but he didn’t dare to ask, patiently waiting.</p><p>After entering the illusion, Qin Sang flicked his sleeve, and Zhuque  tumbled out, letting out an excited cry. It eagerly spread its wings, enjoying its freedom and glaring at Qin Sang with resentful eyes.</p><p>After arriving in Great Zhou, Qin Sang, fearing the bird might cause trouble, had kept it restricted, strictly forbidding it from going out. This had frustrated Zhuque immensely.</p><p>Ignoring Zhuque’s resentment, Qin Sang gave it a topographical map.</p><p>“You will take Luo Hou and the others and go to all these places, exploring as thoroughly as possible and recording the surrounding environment.”</p><p>Qin Sang had categorized the locations. The most crucial ones were naturally assigned to his most trusted subordinates. Zhuque and the two demon lords working together were more than capable of protecting themselves here.</p><p>The two demon lords had already started cultivating the *Heavenly Demon Transformation* technique.  This technique was undeniably attractive to any demon cultivator; it offered a glimmer of hope for reaching the Void Refinement stage. Unless presented with a greater temptation, Qin Sang wasn't worried about their betrayal.</p><p>However, he was still a little uneasy about Zhuque.</p><p>“You know the implications behind the Purple Micro Palace. There can be no mistakes. You had better behave.  In this vast world, humans and demons are mortal enemies, and even more so for your kind of divine beast. If a powerful cultivator captures you, no one can save you. The Qilin Primordial Essence is mine alone.”</p><p>Zhuque snorted. Qin Sang clearly underestimated it. It wasn’t stupid; its arrogance was situational and dependent on the target.</p><p>Qin Sang, seeing that she was preparing to flee again, Zhu Que grumbled, "Following you, I've never had a peaceful day!"</p><p>Qin Sang ignored her, opening a container and releasing the two demon lords and the Fire Jade Centipede, ordering them to work with Zhu Que.</p><p>"Take these two with you. If you sense danger, send them out to scout."</p><p>Qin Sang threw down the two captives and gave the demon lords a method to control them, ensuring the captives would obey.</p><p>"Attack!"</p><p>Zhu Que, perched on the centipede's back, pointed her wings forward and roared, majestic and imposing.  The two demon lords bowed to Qin Sang and followed with the captives.</p><p>Qin Sang returned to their original spot and, summoning Qu Zhen, continued towards the Sword Pavilion fragment.</p><p>After a detour, they finally reached their destination, encountering a field of multicolored light. The location was extremely well-hidden; it was unclear how Heng Sha discovered it, explaining why others hadn't found it.</p><p>Inside the light was the Sword Pavilion fragment. The light reminded Qin Sang of the celestial restrictions in the Seven Killing Hall's inner chamber, but according to Qu Zhen's description, there seemed to be no connection between them.</p><p>"Elder Qin, this is the safest path we've found after multiple explorations," Qu Zhen volunteered, leading the way into the side of the light.</p><p>Vibrant multicolored light filled the area.  Passing through it, they faced a mountain peak, with more mountains behind it, each taller than the last, like towering walls obscuring what lay beyond.</p><p>"The mountains are filled with ancient restrictions. We only reached the foot of the last mountain," Qu Zhen pointed, "We don't know what's beyond, but we encountered two anomalies—a light erupted from behind the mountains, like a gushing spring, resembling the radiance of some treasure."</p><p>Qin Sang observed carefully, noticing the mountains were barren, their ancient restrictions mostly shattered.</p><p>Broken ancient restrictions were not difficult to overcome, but they were far more dangerous and unpredictable.</p><p>Effortlessly, Qin Sang and Qu Zhen reached the foot of the last mountain.</p><p>Looking up at the summit, swirling chaotic energy floated in the void, the area where the ancient restriction fluctuations were most intense. The energy shifted unpredictably; even minor fluctuations could trigger a storm.  Without sufficient strength, attempting to force a passage meant certain death.</p><p>Qu Zhen looked at Qin Sang, who pondered for a moment before saying calmly, "Stay behind me."</p><p>With that, Qin Sang began climbing, noticing a stone staircase to his left leading directly to the summit. The dilapidated stairs exuded an ancient aura, having withstood countless years.</p><p>Qin Sang chose to walk, his steps leisurely, like an ordinary hiker. Qu Zhen, naturally, didn't dare to be so relaxed, carefully following close behind.</p><p>With Qin Sang in the lead, dangers that usually made them tremble with fear were easily overcome.  They reached the summit and saw the scene beyond the mountains.</p><p>Behind the mountains was a boundless expanse of mire.  Aside from mud, there was nothing else—the mud churned incessantly like a constantly agitated pool, its contents thoroughly mixed, repulsive and sickening.</p><p>The moment they reached the summit, Qin Sang's eyes narrowed sharply. He reached out to the void, only to grasp air.</p><p>"Elder Qin?"</p><p>Qu Zhen, seeing Qin Sang's action, was unsure what he was doing.</p><p>"There's poison here," Qin Sang said, his voice betraying no emotion, though his mind was already in turmoil.</p><p>A subtle poison permeated the void, so thin that ordinary people couldn't sense it, nor could it be seen with the naked eye.</p><p>Qin Sang had only encountered this poison in one place: the幽谷 , one of the Three Poisonous Lands of the Seven Killing Hall!  The area where the Demon Sealing War occurred, where Elder Qingzhu left his last will, was located within Yougu!</p><p>"Could it really be the Seven Killing Hall?"</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze swept across the mire.</p><p>This suggested that the Sword Pavilion fragments discovered in the Feng Ju Jade Gate were likely fragments of the Five Great Sword Pavilions that were torn apart and shed during their ascension, miraculously surviving and scattering in the Feng Ju Jade Gate.</p><p>It seemed he had to visit those Sword Pavilion fragments, as one of them might be a place he'd been to before.  Qin Sang pondered this, flying down the mountain with Qu Zhen.</p><p>The poison was incredibly dilute, greatly reducing its lethality, posing no threat to them. Qu Zhen simply thought Qin Sang was reminding him to pay attention to the poison's source and didn't think further.</p><p>Soon, Qin Sang crossed the mire, reaching its edge, but unfortunately, he found nothing else related to the Seven Killing Hall.</p><p>"Have we searched the nearby area?" Qin Sang asked.</p><p>Qu Zhen nodded.  "We've searched thoroughly.  Only this fragment remains. The other Sword Pavilion fragments are scattered far and wide.  They say many were destroyed by the impact of the divine manifestation."</p><p>Back at the center of the mire, Qin Sang reached down and scooped up some mud.  The muck churned, and a skeleton surfaced.</p><p>It was a beast's skeleton, roughly the size of a tiger or leopard, with a crack in its forehead.  A glowing light emanated from within the fissure.</p><p>With a *crack*, the skull split open, and a pearl flew out—a demon core.</p><p>"The radiance you saw earlier was this."</p><p>Qin Sang drew the core into his hand. Judging by the luster of the bone and the core, the beast had been a mid-to-late stage Nascent Soul cultivator. It had been dead for some time, but not too long.</p><p>More surprisingly, it was the skeleton of a ferocious beast! Qin Sang had hunted countless such beasts in the Talisman Realm; he recognized the aura instantly.</p><p>Did the beast wander in from the River of Woe when the Sword Pavilion ascended? Or had ferocious beasts always lived within the Seven Killing Hall? If it was kept by the Seven Killing Hall, it's fortunate it wasn't released. Otherwise, all of Canglang Sea would have suffered.</p><p>The Sword Pavilion holds many unsolved mysteries, and now there's another.</p><p>Qin Sang tossed the skeleton to Qu Zhen. "This skeleton is the only treasure here. I'll keep the demon core; this is yours."</p><p>The skeleton of a Nascent Soul-stage ferocious beast is a superior spiritual material, a considerable gain for the Hengsha Society.</p><p>"Thank you, Elder Qin!"</p><p>Qu Zhen accepted the skeleton, gazing thoughtfully at Qin Sang's back.  It seems this Elder Qin is indeed a man who cherishes his reputation.</p><p>Of course, they couldn't truly trust a stranger at the Void Refinement stage.  Although they couldn't cross the mountain peak, they had determined through other means that the radiance wasn't from an unparalleled treasure.</p><p>This trip was a test. The Hengsha Society has cultivated in Fengju Yumen for many years. They've found more than just this Sword Pavilion fragment; they've discovered another, far more significant one.  It clearly originated from an extraordinary place, possibly a key area of the ancient Sword Pavilion, containing untold treasures and legacies.</p><p>The Hengsha Society lacks the power to open it alone. Inviting a Void Refinement cultivator risked being completely exploited, so choosing allies required extreme caution. The Hengsha Society is using its long-accumulated connections to find suitable candidates, and Qin Sang is only one of them.</p><p>They haven't fully ascertained Qin Sang's character.  They'll continue observing him during this transaction.</p><p>"You must know more locations of Sword Pavilion fragments, right? This muddy swamp alone yielded a Nascent Soul-stage demonic bone.  Other places likely hold even greater treasures. No wonder so many experts are drawn here. Show me the way, and you won't be disappointed," Qin Sang seemed intrigued by the bone.</p><p>"Yes! I've spent many years in Fengju Yumen and have good information.  New Sword Pavilion fragments are discovered occasionally. Some discoveries haven't even spread widely; few people have been there…"</p><p>Qu Zhen described several locations, mapping out the fastest route.  The two continued on their way.</p><p>They subsequently passed three more Sword Pavilion fragments.</p><p>These fragments varied in size. The smallest might be a single mountain; the largest required extended exploration.  Due to their locations, cultivators were searching all three.</p><p>People came and went, searching repeatedly, turning the areas upside down. It's said that lucky individuals occasionally stumble upon overlooked opportunities, and such news emerges periodically.</p><p>"The fragment ahead is extremely dangerous. We only scouted the periphery; we didn't dare enter…"</p><p>Qu Zhen recounted their previous experiences, leading Qin Sang to the fourth fragment.</p><p>The moment Qin Sang saw it, he felt a strange sense of familiarity.</p><p>The Sword Pavilion fragments, ravaged during their ascent, were unrecognizable.  But the remaining layout gave Qin Sang a profound sense of déjà vu.</p><p>"It's… an area on the outskirts of the Purple Micro Palace!"</p><p>A faint mist shrouded the area, hinting at the shadows of celestial mountains and palaces within. The familiarity grew stronger.</p><p>Qin Sang was eighty percent certain this was a fragment of the Purple Micro Palace.</p><p>Not the original Purple Micro Palace, but the one revealed after the celestial array was activated.  Even though he'd only glimpsed it briefly, that image was deeply etched in his memory.</p><p>The layout seemed to correspond to a corner of the celestial palace. The Purple Micro Palace had been shattered!</p><p>Violent fluctuations periodically emanated from within the mist, evidently from experts exploring and assaulting the celestial prohibitions.</p><p>"Hm?"</p><p>Suddenly, Qin Sang glimpsed a fleeting figure near a palace.</p><p>The mist obscured the details, but the instant the figure passed, the same feeling of familiarity he experienced upon seeing the fragment surged back!</p>
