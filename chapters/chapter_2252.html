<h1>Chapter 2242:  A Clue</h1><p>“Young Master! Young Master!”</p><p>Two women, their faces etched with anxiety, landed before Chen Yuze, shouting from the crowd.</p><p>“Young Master, leave! This has nothing to do with us!  Father specifically instructed you not to interfere. If anything happens to you, how can we answer to him?”</p><p>The two women, beautiful and dressed in martial attire, looked more like skilled fighters than maidservants.</p><p>The onlookers could guess the situation.  The women were likely his personal bodyguards.  This Young Master Chen was probably a wealthy young man on his first journey, inexperienced in the ways of the world.  Seeing the Source Pure Mountain cultivators in trouble, he impulsively intervened.</p><p>“Silence!”</p><p>Chen Yuze declared righteously, “When faced with injustice, one must act! I cannot bear to watch these cultivators suffer!”</p><p>He turned to Qinghong and Shuangluo, hesitation evident on his face.  “That Yu fellow had a point; my intervention is inappropriate. However, I’m not a coward; I’m worried about facing my master. I’ve devised a plan, but it requires a sacrifice from you…”</p><p>At that moment, the Clear River Sect launched an attack, their magical treasures raining down like a storm of light.</p><p>Qinghong and Shuangluo urgently activated their protective formation, urging their disciples back inside the mountain gate. "Fellow cultivators, come inside!"</p><p>Since Chen Yuze was siding with Source Pure Mountain, and the enemy had attacked, it would be inhumane for Source Pure Mountain to turn them away.</p><p>However, Qinghong didn't immediately let Chen Yuze enter.  They took shelter behind the protective barrier, safe from the fierce onslaught, though the attack was intense and seemed capable of breaking through at any time.</p><p>Hearing Chen Yuze's words, Qinghong and Shuangluo exchanged a glance, their brows furrowed. “Young Master, please state your plan.”</p><p>Chen Yuze hesitated, finally mustering his courage.  “I am unmarried, and I dare to ask Lady Shuangluo if she is betrothed?”</p><p>Shuangluo stiffened.</p><p>“Young Master, you’re being foolish! Father will never agree!”  The two maidservants stamped their feet in anger. “Father has already found a suitable match for you. Is this wild woman worth it?”</p><p>“Silence!”</p><p>Chen Yuze rebuked them. “My marriage is my own decision!”</p><p>Then, he addressed Qinghong and Shuangluo earnestly. “The only way I can legitimately intervene is if our sects form a marriage alliance.  Rest assured, I won't take advantage of the situation. Once the matter is resolved, I will publicly announce the annulment of my marriage to Lady Shuangluo!”</p><p>Seeing their silence, Chen Yuze sighed wryly. “Very well!  I’ve been thoughtless.  I, a man, fear not gossip, but I would tarnish your reputation.”</p><p>His words, though seemingly considerate, implicitly put pressure on Shuangluo and Qinghong.  Faced with a crisis, could their reputation outweigh their sect's fate?</p><p>“Senior Sister…”</p><p>Shuangluo began, but Qinghong interrupted. “This mess was caused by Jingchuan. Even if it comes to this, it shouldn't fall on my junior sister. Before my senior brother arrived, he sent a message to Elder Zhou for help.  Let’s stall for a while; perhaps there's a chance.”</p><p>The two women exchanged glances, both aware that their hope was slim.  They had fled to the Immortal City with Elder Zhou and others years ago, and their connections remained strong. Source Pure Mountain's plight would not be ignored. The problem was, their senior brother was stationed nearby to protect the sect, while Elder Zhou and the others were far away in the Immortal City.  By the time reinforcements arrive, their master might already be awakened.</p><p>Time slipped away. The Clear River Sect’s assault continued, their hearts heavy with anxiety, each moment felt like an eternity.</p><p>“Thank you, Young Master. Please allow my sister and me to discuss this,” Qinghong said politely.</p><p>“Hmph! A bunch of ungrateful ingrates!”</p><p>One of the maidservants, indignant on behalf of their master, blurted out, “The Young Master risks his life to save you, and you still hesitate!”</p><p>Before she could finish, a voice echoed above them.</p><p>“Oh really? Is your Young Master truly so kind?  It seems to me they are putting on a show.”</p><p>The voice, initially distant and faint, grew stronger, sounding as if it were right beside them by the end.</p><p>“Who’s there!”</p><p>Chen Yuze and his maidservants felt a chill run down their spines.</p><p>At the same time, the Clear River Sect's Sect Master and Qi Bo, who were playing Go in the distance, felt a similar sensation and their expressions changed drastically.</p><p>The next moment, Chen Yuze and his two maidservants found themselves paralyzed, their eyes wide with terror as they looked to the sky.</p><p>A gigantic hand appeared above them, casting a terrifying shadow, and reaching down to seize them.</p><p>‘Snap!’</p><p>Chen Yuze's jade pendant, a self-protecting artifact, automatically flew up and shattered.</p><p>A beastly shadow erupted from a jade pendant fragment, but before anyone could see clearly, it exploded under immense pressure.  The roar cut short, unable to hinder the giant hand in the slightest.</p><p>“Stop!”</p><p>Another roar echoed from the heavens, shaking the very earth.</p><p>This was a new voice, followed by a white streak of light, faster than lightning, seemingly capable of shattering the void. It instantly arrived above Mount Yuanjing, transforming into a long sword that slashed down at the giant hand.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>A thunderous explosion rocked the ground.</p><p>The shockwave from the collision of the hand and the sword formed swirling grey storms that enveloped the sky, lingering for a long time. The light around Mount Yuanjing darkened.</p><p>The onlookers were terrified, faintly seeing two figures locked in a standoff high above, undoubtedly top-tier experts. The storm was the result of their clash.</p><p>“Who are you?”</p><p>Qi Bo asked, his expression doubtful.</p><p>He sensed that the opponent's cultivation was inferior to his, yet he felt an inexplicable threat emanating from them, a fact that both puzzled and intimidated him.</p><p>“Junior Brother!”</p><p>Qing Hong and Shuang Luo gasped upon recognizing the figure.</p><p>They never expected their savior to be their younger brother, and at such a high level of cultivation!</p><p>Shuang Luo gazed痴痴地 at the figure in the sky, then a shadow crossed her face. The gap between them had grown even wider.</p><p>Qing Hong felt both surprise and joy, noticing Shuang Luo's expression. She sighed softly, suppressing her turbulent emotions, and gently embraced her.</p><p>'Whoosh! Whoosh!'</p><p>The giant hand was blocked by Qi Bo, allowing Chen Yuze and the two others to escape death, scrambling behind Qi Bo, glaring resentfully at Qin Sang.</p><p>“Are you a disciple of Mount Yuanjing?”</p><p>Qi Bo looked surprised.</p><p>It was said that Tong Shen’s youngest disciple was young and wild, often away from the sect. To possess such cultivation… rumors were indeed unreliable!</p><p>A dangerous glint flashed in Qin Sang's eyes.  He immediately leveled an accusation, “You’re the mastermind behind this!”</p><p>“Friend, you misunderstand. I was merely ordered to protect the young master. I don't know what you're talking about,”</p><p>Qi Bo said calmly, turning to Chen Yuze. “Young Master, are you alright?”</p><p>Chen Yuze shook his head slightly, his face grim. He transmitted a message, “Qi Bo, can you kill him?!”</p><p>“This person is not simple! Killing him will make Tong Shen relentless in his pursuit. We'll be in grave danger,” Qi Bo replied.</p><p>Chen Yuze snorted. This unexpected arrival, with Mount Yuanjing’s protective array now reinforced, meant their plot was likely to fail.</p><p>Qin Sang's identity being revealed caused an uproar among the crowd.</p><p>The Qingjiang sect's offensive stalled.</p><p>Yu Chen had heard of Qin Sang before, but only by name.  Seeing a figure on par with his master, his mind reeled, leaving him confused and uncertain.</p><p>“Misunderstanding?”</p><p>Qin Sang scoffed, his gaze sweeping over Yu Chen before settling on the coffin. “The tricks played on the corpse may fool the world, but not my eyes!”</p><p>Yu Chen's heart skipped a beat, his arrogance waning. “What are you talking about? What tricks?”</p><p>Qin Sang raised his right hand, pointing at the corpse from a distance.</p><p>The corpse sat up automatically, causing a collective gasp.</p><p>“What are you doing?!”</p><p>Yu Chen roared.</p><p>Qin Sang sneered, “Small-minded individuals attempted to frame us, deliberately mimicking Mount Yuanjing’s techniques. They failed to realize the profound nature of our sect's teachings leaves no loopholes! Look at this!”</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>A burst of fire erupted from the corpse's left side, while icy mist rose from the right.</p><p>Initially clinging together, yet distinctly separate, the fire and ice intertwined, forming red and blue smoke that spread outwards.</p><p>Everyone saw the smoke emanated from the corpse's body, Qin Sang merely revealed it, not some illusion.</p><p>When the smoke appeared, Chen Yuze's face darkened further.</p><p>“What is this?”</p><p>A Qingjiang disciple beside the coffin grabbed a wisp of the smoke.</p><p>The disciple screamed. Three-foot-high flames erupted from his hand, while the lower half was frozen solid.  Water and fire rapidly spread along his arm, towards his body.</p><p>His fellow disciples reacted swiftly, severing his arm with a sword.</p><p>'Snap!'</p><p>The arm fell, half charred, half white, a gruesome sight, identical to the death of Xia Zhishi.</p><p>This is…”</p><p>Seeing this, everyone was terrified, avoiding the smoke.</p><p>“It’s poison!”</p><p>Qin Sang softly uttered a word, glancing unintentionally at a certain point in the void, and shouted, “Yu Chen, quickly bring the body back to the mountain gate.  Your master will understand the truth upon seeing this smoke! The real culprit is scheming, using this poison to frame our Yuanjing Mountain and destroy the relationship between Yuanjing Mountain and Qingjiang Sect. It’s laughable that you don't recognize the real culprit, yet you willingly serve them!”</p><p>After a pause, Qin Sang continued, “To perfectly control this poison and disguise it as Yuanjing Mountain’s ability is no easy feat. The poisoner's cultivation is probably no weaker than mine. In the Qingtuo River region, such experts are few and far between. Your master wouldn't lay a hand on his disciples, so who is the culprit?”</p><p>After saying this, Qin Sang stared intently at Qi Bo, and others followed Qin Sang's gaze to Qi Bo.</p><p>Guided by Qin Sang, everyone's thoughts dispersed, and they noticed various suspicious points.</p><p>“Hmph! I couldn't bear to see the two fairies being bullied, so I stepped forward.  The Daoist friend actually suspects me, it's truly chilling! Is this how Yuanjing Mountain treats benefactors? No wonder my father always said that people's hearts are treacherous and told me to go down the mountain to gain experience!  Consider me blind and mistaken, we're leaving!”</p><p>Chen Yuze, realizing he was digging himself deeper, immediately turned his sleeve and left.</p><p>“This only proves that Manager Xia was poisoned, and Lan Jingchuan injuring Manager Xia is also a fact. Moreover, the poisoner may well be from your Yuanjing Mountain.  Our Qingjiang Sect will eventually uncover the truth!”</p><p>Yu Chen also left a few harsh words, and the Qingjiang Sect cultivators carried the body down the mountain dejectedly.</p><p>The storm subsided, and after seeing the outsiders off the mountain, Qin Sang and others went to the headmaster's hall for a meeting.</p><p>“Thanks to Junior Brother for returning in time, otherwise the consequences would have been unimaginable,” Qing Hong said fearfully.</p><p>“Senior Brother, do you know the details of the Tianjing Sect? Do they have any grudges against our Yuanjing Mountain?”</p><p>Qin Sang looked at Qing Yan.</p><p>Qing Yan took some medicine, his complexion improved slightly, but he was still very weak.  He mustered his spirit and said, “I’ve heard of Tianjing Sect. Their mountain gate is in Qilin Country to the north, and we have little interaction. I don’t know if Master has any grievances with them. I heard that Tianjing Sect also has people serving as Celestial Guards in the Celestial City, and they might have had conflicts with Master.”</p><p>“That Master Chen seemed so refined, yet so insidious! Luckily, Junior Brother exposed his conspiracy, he almost tricked my junior sister!”</p><p>At this point, Qing Hong thought of something and exclaimed, “His true purpose… wasn't it to win Junior Sister's heart?  Is it really a case of a beautiful woman causing trouble?”</p><p>Shuang Luo's face turned red.</p><p>Qing Hong touched Shuang Luo's cheek and giggled, “Such a pitiable beauty.  So many people are eyeing my junior sister, Junior Brother, you have to keep a close eye on her, lest she be snatched away one day.”</p><p>“What are you saying, Senior Sister!” Shuang Luo said shyly and angrily.</p><p>“If it was truly for Shuang Junior Sister, he's quite the playboy! But it's more likely that he saw an opportunity and changed his plans, acting nice in front of Junior Sister.”</p><p>Qin Sang said calmly, “Once Senior Zhou arrives, ask him to oversee the mountain gate. I'll go out and investigate the Tianjing Sect.”</p><p>“Why didn’t Junior Brother keep that Chen fellow for interrogation?” Qing Hong asked.</p><p>At that time, Chen Yuze was hiding inside the formation with them.  If Qin Sang had been willing, cooperating with the protective mountain formation, he could have easily stopped the old man and detained Chen Yuze.</p><p>“Detaining this person would give Tianjing Sect a reason to attack, and disrupt Master's cultivation. Moreover, I suspect they have ulterior motives, and I don't want to startle them for now,” As Qin Sang grew stronger, Yuanjing Mountain could no longer help him much. However, if he needed to develop his own forces in the future, he could use Yuanjing Mountain as a base.</p><p>If the Transcendent Monk and Tianjing Sect had no grievances, then Tianjing Sect targeting Yuanjing Mountain is intriguing.  Either Tianjing Sect wants to expand, involving a conflict of interest, or…</p><p>Qin Sang looked at the distant mountains outside the hall, thinking of the poison on Manager Xia’s body. That poison combined water and fire poisons cleverly, not something easily refined.</p><p>Could it be that Yuanjing Mountain's unique heritage has attracted the attention of someone with ulterior motives?</p><p>Could it be related to the "Treatise on Yin and Yang Correspondences," the clues I've been searching for for years,  have finally appeared?</p>
