<h1>Chapter 1243: Standing Tall and Upright</h1><p>Back on Cangheng Island, Qingjun had brought Qin Sang along, and to his surprise, Qin Sang had managed to reach the late Golden Core stage. At that time, Dongyang Bo had considered eliminating Qin Sang to prevent future troubles. However, he had to consider two individuals.</p><p>The first was Qingjun. Dongyang Bo knew that Qingjun was the daughter of Qingzhu, and since Qin Sang cultivated the same techniques as Qingzhu, he suspected that Qingjun had been sheltering Qin Sang all these years out of affection for her father.</p><p>The second was Chenyan. Dongyang Bo couldn't fathom Chenyan's true feelings toward Qin Sang. Chenyan was desperate to save her master and would undoubtedly return in the future. If she learned of Qin Sang's reappearance, it would surely stir up trouble. Thus, any action against Qin Sang had to be done in secret, without leaking any information.</p><p>Unfortunately, the cunning little thief had vanished after that brief appearance, rendering all of Dongyang Bo's plans futile. Later, when the Sin Abyss launched a fierce assault, Dongyang Bo was too preoccupied to spare any attention to Qin Sang, and the matter was left unresolved.</p><p>Of course, the most important reason was that Dongyang Bo didn't believe Qin Sang could ever pose a real threat to him.</p><p>Qin Sang was born with a five-element spiritual root, and his foundation-building had only been possible through selling himself. He had even consumed the Snow Spirit Lotus and Iris Flower, yet still failed to form a Golden Core. Dongyang Bo wondered what method Qingjun had used to help Qin Sang achieve his Golden Coreâ€”perhaps it was also through selling himself.</p><p>Forming a Nascent Soul was no simple feat.</p><p>In truth, Dongyang Bo's assumptions weren't entirely wrong. Qin Sang had indeed relied on the Calamity-Dispelling Pill and Soul-Cleansing Liquid, as well as the Lifebound Insect Gu and the "Heavenly Demon Transformation" technique, to achieve his Nascent Soul. Dongyang Bo could never have imagined that the pawn he once regarded as an ant would not only form a Nascent Soul but also surpass all expectations, transforming into a Demon King and carving out a formidable reputation.</p><p>Now, Qin Sang stood before him, upright and unyielding, holding his ground!</p><p>Dongyang Bo couldn't hide his astonishment.</p><p>Qin Sang had no interest in exchanging words. The time for pretense was over, and there was nothing left to say to Dongyang Bo. Without a word, he silently activated his sword technique. The Blackwood Sword erupted with radiant light, shattering the shadowy projections before splitting into countless sword beams. In an instant, the Seven Souls Slaughter Array was fully deployed.</p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p>Seeing the array, which shared the same lineage as his own techniques, Dongyang Bo was momentarily stunned, his face filled with disbelief. "Could it be that I personally drove away two geniuses?"</p><p>Upon seeing the Seven Souls Slaughter Array, Dongyang Bo mistakenly assumed that Qin Sang had learned it from Qingjun, realizing that Qingzhu had successfully created the Nascent Soul portion of the technique. Though his assumption was incorrect, it wasn't far from the truth.</p><p>One had the ability to create his own techniques, while the other, despite his unique cultivation method, had managed to form a Nascent Soul with a five-element spiritual root, proving his exceptional talent.</p><p>Spiritual roots were merely one aspect of talent.</p><p>In an era where orthodox cultivation reigned supreme and unorthodox paths had declined, spiritual roots had become overly emphasized.</p><p>These two individuals were rare talents, each capable of founding their own sects and elevating Shaohua Mountain to new heights. If even one of them had remained, Dongyang Bo wouldn't have had to worry about finding a successor or scheming to obtain a Nascent Soul puppet.</p><p>Yet, it was he who had driven them both away.</p><p>"Hahaha..."</p><p>Dongyang Bo suddenly burst into laughter, his voice filled with complex emotions. Was it regret? Or was he mocking himself?</p><p>Nevertheless, as a Nascent Soul elder, though his mind was in turmoil, his movements remained swift.</p><p>Dongyang Bo knew that his past actions had made reconciliation with Qin Sang impossible. Qin Sang's decision to conceal his identity and assume the role of a Demon King was proof enough of his lingering resentment.</p><p>He didn't bother with empty words about inviting Qin Sang back to the mountain to turn hostility into friendship.</p><p>"Heh, I've long heard of the Demon King Mingyue's reputation, but I never expected it to be you," Dongyang Bo said with a strange tone, his expression filled with emotion. "Truly, each generation brings forth its own talents! Your achievements today are remarkable and well-deserved. You are indeed a worthy match for Fairy Chenyan. In the future, she might even find herself at your mercy. When I urged her to cultivate the 'Stone Bridge Zen,' I underestimated you."</p><p>Hearing Dongyang Bo suddenly mention Chenyan, Qin Sang remained unmoved, focusing solely on controlling his sword for a fierce assault. Even if he was acting hastily, he was determined to give it his all and engage Dongyang Bo in battle!</p><p>Seeing that even Chenyan couldn't shake Qin Sang's resolve, Dongyang Bo cut short his words, his thoughts racing.</p><p>He knew that Qin Sang not only possessed a top-grade spirit sword but also other formidable techniques. A quick victory was unlikely, and he had no intention of engaging in a prolonged battle with Qin Sang here.</p><p>His priority was to retrieve the puppet as quickly as possible to avoid further complications.</p><p>Then, he would need to carefully consider the future situation.</p><p>Qin Sang's formation of a Nascent Soul and his extraordinary strength had introduced too many variables, completely disrupting Dongyang Bo's previous plans.</p><p>With his mind made up, Dongyang Bo glanced around and found himself surrounded by darkness, having fallen into the sword array.</p><p>At that moment, countless sword threads within the array surged toward him, intent on shredding him to pieces.</p><p>Stimulated by the slaughter array, Dongyang Bo felt his primordial spirit tremble, his mind on the verge of losing control. He realized that this sword array not only possessed unfathomable power but could also attack the primordial spirit.</p><p>Not daring to let the sword array close in, Dongyang Bo immediately activated his Diamond Ring with full force.</p><p>The Diamond Ring hovered above his head, trembling slightly, ready to shift positions at any moment to avoid the Blood Filth Divine Light, but this did not diminish its power.</p><p>One after another, ring-shaped projections surged in all directions.</p><p>For a moment, Dongyang Bo's surroundings were as bright as daylight, and the sword threads were illuminated, scattered by the ring projections but still capable of transforming and attacking Dongyang Bo.</p><p>At the same time, a flash of treasure light appeared in Dongyang Bo's palm, and a small bronze lamp materialized.</p><p>The lamp was only three inches tall, exquisitely crafted, with its top carved into the shape of a lotus. Each petal was as green as jade, and though the lamp contained no oil, it had a wick of unknown material.</p><p>With a surge of Dongyang Bo's true essence, the wick ignited spontaneously.</p><p>The bronze lamp floated in front of Dongyang Bo's brow, its flame as small as a bean, emitting a dim, yellowish light.</p><p>However, once the flame appeared, the sword threads slowed, and Dongyang Bo's expression visibly relaxed.</p><p>Outside the sword array, Qin Sang saw everything clearly. He knew that this lamp could counter the Seven Souls Slaughter Array. Dongyang Bo was a seasoned Nascent Soul elder and the leader of a sect, possessing numerous treasures. His earlier display against Gongliang Yu had merely been a test.</p><p>Qin Sang reacted swiftly. The moment Dongyang Bo summoned the lamp, he willed the Blackwood Sword to break free from the array and unleash the Blood Filth Divine Light without hesitation!</p><p>Having suffered from the Blood Filth Divine Light before, Dongyang Bo wouldn't give Qin Sang another chance to taint his Diamond Ring. Qin Sang had to settle for the next best option: catching Dongyang Bo off guard and disabling one of his treasures.</p><p>Qin Sang's move proved effective.</p><p>Once tainted by the Blood Filth Divine Light, the bronze lamp's power diminished significantly. The flame flickered violently before extinguishing completely.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Dongyang Bo, now without the lamp, let out a loud laugh and suddenly spat out a beam of yellow light.</p><p>Within the light was a stone pillar.</p><p>The pillar was adorned with carvings of dragons and phoenixes, and it rapidly expanded, smashing toward the Blackwood Sword with the force of a thousand mountains.</p><p>This was a unique treasure, weighing as much as a mountain, its power unmatched.</p><p>Dongyang Bo's timing was impeccable, and the stone pillar, spat from his mouth, was nearly impossible to defend against. The Blackwood Sword's light was forced back, as if bearing the weight of a thousand mountains, and for a moment, it seemed to falter.</p><p>At the same time, the Diamond Ring finally found a flaw in the sword array. Like a bursting dam, it unleashed an endless stream of light and flames, surging toward a specific point in the array.</p><p>Qin Sang sighed inwardly, regretting that his cultivation time was still too short and he hadn't fully comprehended the Seven Souls Slaughter Array. Otherwise, Dongyang Bo would never have found a flaw so easily.</p><p>However, Dongyang Bo, thinking he had gained the upper hand, was unaware that this was part of Qin Sang's plan to distract him.</p><p>The Eighteen Demon Banners had already been secretly deployed!</p>
