<h1>Chapter 1720: A Fellow Daoist</h1><p>Fujiang Estuary.</p><p>Atop a reef, several figures stood with hands clasped, gazing eastward.</p><p>Suddenly, a dark shape appeared on the sea surface, a lone figure riding a lion, approaching.</p><p>“Greetings, Master.”</p><p>The Mingyue Guards bowed in respect, then abruptly sensed something amiss.  Looking again, they realized the black lion was a great sage of the demon race.</p><p>The black lion was their master's mount, and they hadn't yet been granted permission to join the Green Ram Temple. Their status was precarious, and their cultivation was far inferior to the black lion’s.</p><p>The Mingyue Guards dared not show any disrespect, bowing again to the black lion.</p><p>The black lion snorted, tossing its head with an air of arrogance.</p><p>“How goes your investigation?”</p><p>Qin Sang rode the black lion onto the reef, his voice echoing.</p><p>One of the Mingyue Guards immediately stepped forward, presenting a jade slip. “Reporting to Master, we have made thorough arrangements as you instructed.”</p><p>Qin Sang's true body had recently been stationed in the East Sea, issuing commands through his avatar.</p><p>At this moment, his avatar was occupied with other matters in the Central Continent and hadn't been able to arrive in time.</p><p>Qin Sang perused the jade slip, his gaze sweeping across the land of the Central Continent.</p><p>The downfall of the Holy King's Palace and the disappearance of the Azure Fox Holy King indirectly confirmed that the two Nascent Soul cultivators were deeply affected by the demonic whispers of the Heavenly Dao. Even if they hadn't ascended, they were unable to extricate themselves.</p><p>He had ignited the internal strife among the demon clans in the East Sea, and his avatar hadn't been idle either, secretly investigating the Three Sects Alliance, attempting to uncover some clues.</p><p>The only course of action now was to personally visit his two fellow Daoists.</p><p>“Go ahead and make the necessary preparations.”</p><p>Qin Sang waved his hand, dismissing the Mingyue Guards.</p><p>“As you command!”</p><p>The Mingyue Guards departed respectfully.</p><p>Qin Sang, riding the black lion, stepped onto land, his destination clear – the Sweet Dew Zen Monastery.</p><p>The journey was uneventful.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't directly visit the monastery. Instead, he appeared on a mountain peak behind it, overlooking the mist-shrouded peaks.</p><p>“What a magnificent Zen temple!”  Qin Sang exclaimed.</p><p>His avatar had entered the Sweet Dew Zen Monastery numerous times, but this was the first time Qin Sang's true body had witnessed its grandeur 'with his own eyes.'</p><p>The top sects of the Central Continent were truly blessed by heaven and earth.</p><p>Mount Nianshi was a notch below this place.</p><p>Back in the day, the Southern Barbarian Provinces, where the Formless Immortal Sect resided, should have surpassed the Central Continent, but they were tragically destroyed during the demonic tribulation.</p><p>“Does Master intend to claim this sacred ground?” the black lion rumbled beside him.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at the black lion.  Did this creature not know a Saint resided in the Sweet Dew Zen Monastery? It feigned ignorance, seeking to please its master.  No wonder it had cultivated to the late stage of Transformation and was a first-rate mount.</p><p>He focused his gaze, peering towards one specific peak.</p><p>The Buddhist Saint's sanctuary—Small Boundless Mountain.</p><p>These mountains were clearly real, yet they appeared indistinct, his vision obscured by an invisible force.</p><p>Here, Qin Sang couldn't sense any demonic aura or the presence of Nascent Soul cultivators. He employed the Heavenly Eye Butterfly divine ability to secretly observe for a while, then sat down in meditation.</p><p>One month later.</p><p>Dozens of golden streaks of light suddenly shot out from the Sweet Dew Zen Monastery. After hovering briefly at the front of the mountain, they sped southwestward.</p><p>The streaks of light were composed of monastery disciples, led by a portly monk with a bulging belly and a wine gourd hanging from his waist. He was constantly smiling, resembling the Maitreya Buddha enshrined in Buddhist temples.</p><p>The portly monk’s cultivation was unfathomable. He didn't seem to use any flying artifact, striding through the air.  Despite his leisurely pace, his speed was remarkable, and the novices behind him struggled to keep up.</p><p>Compared to the portly monk, the novices appeared frail, their faces flushed with exertion as they urged their various artifacts forward. Only a few maintained calm expressions.</p><p>Judging by their cultivation levels, apart from the portly monk, there were only two young monks at the Golden Core stage. The rest were merely at the Foundation Establishment stage.</p><p>The portly monk led the group, flying through the air. Along the way, they encountered other cultivators who stopped to bow respectfully. Those who were acquainted exchanged pleasantries. “For this disciple training, Venerable Jingding is personally acting as protector.”</p><p>The portly monk uncorked his gourd and took a swig, shaking his head with a sigh.  “This poor monk is destined for a life of toil.”</p><p>The other cultivator appraised the disciples behind him, nodding in approval. "They all possess excellent potential.”</p><p>To accommodate the disciples, the portly monk paused several times. They crossed countless mountains and rivers until they reached a mountain range, hundreds of miles from any signs of civilization.</p><p>Outsiders couldn't discern anything unusual about these mountains.</p><p>The portly monk tilted his wine gourd, pouring out a stream of clear water that transformed into a torrential downpour upon reaching the mountains, drumming against the earth for a while.</p><p>After the rain, the peaks appeared refreshed, the vegetation vibrant, and a faint fragrance of wine lingered in the air.</p><p>The central peak, however, had undergone a dramatic transformation. It seemed as though some kind of seal had been broken, revealing its true form. A fissure split the peak, emitting a dark red smoke that continuously billowed upwards, finally gathering at the summit, blocked by an unseen force. The resulting red cloud radiated a peculiar aura – a mixture of intense heat and chilling coldness.</p><p>Seeing the red cloud, the disciples behind him were filled with both anticipation and curiosity.</p><p>The portly monk shook his wine gourd, a hint of reluctance in his eyes. “You remember the rules of this trial better than this old monk.  To stand out from so many fellow disciples, you must cherish this hard-earned opportunity. Do not treat it lightly. Go!”</p><p>With that, the portly monk landed on a large boulder in the mountains with practiced ease.</p><p>The boulder was as flat as a stone bed. The portly monk lay down, propping his head up with one hand, while the other held the wine gourd to his lips for another swig before closing his eyes contentedly.</p><p>This training would last at least ten days.</p><p>The portly monk wasn't drinking ordinary wine. Squinting, he secretly circulated his cultivation, his breathing even, as if drifting off to sleep.</p><p>Suddenly, the stone bed beneath him shook violently.  The portly monk’s eyes snapped open. It wasn't the stone bed that was moving; the entire mountain was trembling!</p><p>“What’s happening?”</p><p>The portly monk was filled with apprehension. The Red Cloud Sanctuary had served as a training ground for over a thousand years, and nothing like this had ever happened before.</p><p>His mind raced.  He suddenly recalled that before being chosen as a training ground, the Red Cloud Sanctuary had been a forbidden zone of the sect. Deep within, there wasn’t just the strange red smoke, but also remnants of an ancient formation.</p><p>It had taken years of exploration by the sect’s experts to eliminate the danger.</p><p>“Could there still be something hidden beneath the remnants of the formation?”</p><p>The portly monk dared not delay. Summoning an iron staff, he leaped into the fissure, rapidly reaching the platform.  He couldn’t sense the disciples’ presence, his expression growing graver. He raised his staff and slammed it downwards.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The staff sliced through the air, unleashing a golden glow that transformed into an enormous golden staff, piercing the smoke and plummeting below.</p><p>The staff cleared the way.</p><p>The portly monk followed close behind.</p><p>However, he hadn’t descended far when a deafening roar echoed from below, like a landslide or a tsunami.</p><p>The portly monk's heart skipped a beat.  He saw billowing black smoke erupting, not the usual red, but pitch black as ink.  Deep within the black smoke, faint, silk-like fragments with flickering runes drifted, resembling pieces of some unknown material.</p><p>He was responsible for guarding this Red Cloud Sanctuary and naturally knew what this signified.</p><p>“Not good! The remnant formation has activated!”</p><p>The black smoke surged aggressively, the silk-like fragments coiling towards him like venomous snakes.</p><p>Alarmed, the portly monk immediately crushed the wooden token at his waist, slamming his staff downwards and summoning a jade mirror that radiated white light.</p><p>The black smoke, overwhelmingly powerful, instantly swept away the white light, engulfing both the monk and his staff.</p><p>The moment the wooden token shattered…</p><p>Thousands of miles away from the Red Cloud Sanctuary…</p><p>An old monk, leaning on a bamboo staff and wearing straw sandals, was seeking alms in the mortal world.  He suddenly looked westward, his figure vanishing in a blink.  The homeowner, who had just come out with a steamed bun, thought his eyes were playing tricks on him, rubbing them and exclaiming, “A Bodhisattva!”</p><p>Shortly after…</p><p>The old monk appeared above the Red Cloud Sanctuary, gazing down upon it.</p><p>Now, faint black tendrils could be seen churning within the red smoke.</p><p>The old monk scanned the scene, his brow furrowing slightly. He tightened his grip on the alms bowl. The wooden bowl radiated a vibrant purple light, transforming into a purple-gold alms bowl.  He inverted it, and a beam of purple light shot down like an arrow, piercing the red smoke.</p><p>Sensing the portly monk’s aura, his expression flickered. In a flash, he appeared within the mountain fissure.</p><p>The portly monk was wielding his staff, executing various hand seals as he struggled forward.  With this sudden change, the disciples were likely in grave danger. However, he was responsible for their safety and couldn’t abandon them.</p><p>He couldn’t see that at the source of the black smoke, within the ancient remnant formation, several figures were seated, performing a ritual, accompanied by a majestic black lion.</p><p>Suddenly, the black lion opened its eyes, its hooves pounding the ground as it charged outwards.</p><p>The old monk had also plunged into the black smoke, nearing the portly monk.</p><p>He was more perceptive than the portly monk, sensing something amiss. He abruptly roared, "What demonic fiend dares to wreak havoc in the Central Continent!"</p><p>He spun the alms bowl in his hand. Inside, it was now inexplicably filled with clear water. Even when tilted, not a single drop spilled, its surface smooth as a mirror, reflecting the image of a black lion.</p><p>Amidst the chaos, he didn't forget to use a secret technique to alert the monastery.</p><p>The instant the black lion was reflected, a gust of sinister wind assaulted him.</p><p>The black lion, fierce and menacing, raised a massive claw and slammed it towards the old monk. The claws’ tips gleamed with a chilling light, sharp as blades, tearing through the old monk's protective true essence. It was a killing blow.</p><p>The old monk snorted coldly. The string of prayer beads around his neck suddenly snapped, the individual wooden beads shooting towards the black lion.  These beads transformed, each carved with the image of a Buddha, each posture unique and lifelike.</p><p>Buddhist light exploded.</p><p>Before the black lion, images of Buddhas truly materialized, all glaring at it with wrathful expressions.</p><p>In that ethereal space, it seemed as if real Buddhas were chanting reprimands at the black lion. The illusory Buddha images solidified, radiating the power of thunder as they struck the black lion, their movements preternaturally swift.</p><p>The black lion roared, its neck shaking as a dozen more heads sprouted, each facing a Buddha.  Opening their maws, they spewed black beams of light, forcing the Buddhas back.  Simultaneously, its foreclaw lunged towards the old monk's chest with even greater speed.</p><p>A clang resonated.</p><p>The purple-gold alms bowl appeared before the old monk's chest, blocking the black lion’s claw.  The old monk staggered back, his expression filled with astonishment as he looked at the black lion. “Fellow Daoist Black Lion, is that you?”</p><p>"You humans, with your wolfish ambitions, dared to plot against the Holy King! Prepare to die!" The black lion offered a fabricated justification, scattering the wooden Buddhas and pressing the attack.</p><p>The old monk was bewildered. "How could you…"</p><p>He abruptly realized the truth. Given the Azure Fox's temperament, it was likely she hadn't informed her subordinates of the true circumstances.  Alas, this black lion was utterly loyal to her!</p><p>The black lion ignored his words, fighting with the ferocity of one facing death.</p><p>The old monk dodged and weaved, about to speak, when he felt a chill and saw another familiar figure, further increasing his bewilderment.  "Daoist Qingfeng?"</p><p>Now, Qin Sang's true body stood outside the fissure, sealing the battlefield, ensuring even with the old monk's vast divine abilities, escape was impossible.</p><p>He didn’t intervene in the battle, but instead looked towards the Sweet Dew Zen Monastery. The old monk's warning had already been transmitted.</p><p>Sweet Dew Zen Monastery.</p><p>Master Xingji was discussing matters with a senior monk.</p><p>A servant of the abbot rushed in.  "Senior Brother Jingding has sent a warning.  Something has happened at the Red Cloud Sanctuary."</p><p>"The Red Cloud Sanctuary?"</p><p>Master Xingji and the senior monk exchanged glances.</p><p>The senior monk said, "Today is the day for the monastery disciples’ training… The threat in that forbidden zone was eliminated long ago. How could something happen? Is Jingding unable to handle it?"</p><p>Master Xingji rose to his feet. "Junior Brother, come with me…"</p><p>He paused, a smile appearing on his face. "Senior Brother Xingren is travelling the mortal world, and he's near the Red Cloud Sanctuary. He has already gone over."</p><p>"With Senior Brother Xingren there, everything should be fine."</p><p>The senior monk nodded.</p><p>Master Xingji issued orders, then sat back down.</p><p>Senior Brother Xingren was at the late Nascent Soul stage, second only to himself. If not for his deep immersion in Buddhist Dharma, frequently travelling the mortal world – the longest trip lasting nearly a century – delaying his cultivation, he might have reached the Nascent Soul bottleneck even earlier.</p><p>Thinking of this, Master Xingji's mood suddenly darkened.  What was the point of discussing Nascent Soul now?</p><p>Dismissing these distractions, Master Xingji was about to speak when his expression drastically changed. He said gravely, "Senior Brother Xingren is in danger!"</p><p>As he spoke, the two of them appeared outside the mountain gate. A bell tolled within the monastery, followed by a series of whooshing sounds as streaks of light shot out.</p><p>Master Xingji and the others with the highest cultivation levels went ahead, followed by the rest.</p><p>In the past, Master Xingji would have considered all possibilities – whether it was an old enemy seeking revenge – but now, there was no need to worry about the threat of Nascent Soul cultivators.</p><p>The Red Cloud Sanctuary wasn't far from the Sweet Dew Zen Monastery.</p><p>Master Xingji and the others soon saw the smoke-billowing peaks, the black smoke replacing the usual red cloud. The chaotic spiritual energy within indicated a fierce battle.</p><p>Judging by the auras, Senior Brother Xingren was losing, his situation precarious!</p><p>The monks summoned their magical treasures and rushed into the sanctuary, but they hadn’t yet grasped the situation when…</p><p>A sigh echoed from behind them.</p><p>“Is Fellow Daoist Huiguang no longer in this realm?”</p><p>Master Xingji spun around in shock, seeing a Daoist standing behind them.</p><p>Qin Sang’s eyes held a hint of loneliness.</p><p>A great cultivator of their sect was in trouble, and had been unable to extricate themselves for so long.  It stood to reason a Nascent Soul cultivator should have appeared to assist.</p><p>(End of Chapter)</p>
