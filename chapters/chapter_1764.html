<h1>Chapter 1755: Eastern Journey</h1><p>The boat sailed down the river.</p><p>The boatman glanced ahead, quickly returned to the cabin, and knocked on a door.</p><p>“Sir, we’re approaching Mu Gui Pass.”</p><p>A moment later.</p><p>Qin Sang emerged from the cabin.</p><p>The boatman, with a flattering smile, chattered on: “The authorities have strict orders. Only official boats can pass Mu Gui Pass. If private boats dare to cross the line, the river god will warn us with storms. If we go further, the boat will be capsized as punishment.  Sir, you’ll have to switch to an official boat.”</p><p>Qin Sang went to the bow, looking left and right.  The riverbanks were out of sight. A dark silhouette appeared on the river ahead – a remarkably imposing gatehouse, like a huge bridge spanning the river.</p><p>A black and gold flag fluttered in the wind, bearing the characters ‘Mu Gui’.  It was connected to the riverbanks by pontoons, and figures could be seen walking on them.</p><p>Qin Sang recalled the information he’d gathered.  Beyond Mu Gui Pass lay Ju Shan Prefecture, which wasn't peaceful.  妖鬼  might attack from the river. This was a protective measure.</p><p>He had set out from Zhong Mao Prefecture in the far west.  Sometimes he traveled swiftly, sometimes he took it easy, staying in inns like an ordinary person. This allowed him to experience the local customs and traditions under the Daoist Court's rule and also to cultivate along the way.</p><p>He was now in Bai Shi Prefecture, under the jurisdiction of the Northern Pole Exorcism Academy, less than three years since his departure.</p><p>This wasn't because he traveled exceptionally fast, nor because the Daoist Court's territory was small.  Each prefecture within the Daoist Court had a large teleportation array. The intricate workings of these spiritual arrays surpassed even the ancient teleportation arrays of the Storm World.</p><p>The Daoist Court's territory was vast, making these arrays essential for Daoist cultivators.  People came and went constantly.</p><p>The teleportation arrays required only spirit stones and generally didn't rigorously check identities. As long as Qin Sang didn't activate his Tian Yao transformation, he could completely suppress his demonic aura, and getting past was not difficult with a little trickery.</p><p>Bai Shi Prefecture is located northeast of Zhong Mao Prefecture. Qin Sang only traveled along the edge of Bai Shi Prefecture; the two prefectures felt very similar.</p><p>The great river where Mu Gui Pass was located led directly to Ju Shan Prefecture, but it wasn't the best route.</p><p>Even official boats wouldn't go further than the border of Bai Shi Prefecture. To enter Ju Shan Prefecture, one had to proceed alone, facing various dangers.</p><p>The safest method was to seek out the Northern Pole Exorcism Academy. Any Daoist disciple who wanted to hunt妖鬼 could petition the academy's officials for protection.</p><p>Cultivators hunting妖鬼 in Ju Shan Prefecture absolutely couldn't operate outside the two academies of the Daoist Court.</p><p>Even though Daoist disciples were dedicated to eliminating demons and protecting the righteous path, they needed sufficient cultivation and resources.</p><p>After achieving merit in Ju Shan Prefecture, they could exchange it for rare treasures at the two academies to enhance their cultivation. This was why so many Daoist disciples were willing to risk their lives.</p><p>Upon learning this, Qin Sang knew he had come to the right place. Ju Shan Prefecture undoubtedly offered more opportunities.</p><p>The Daoist Court’s two academies were fighting Gui Fang Kingdom; the regulations wouldn't be as strict as in the heartland of the Daoist Court.</p><p>His opportunity might lie here.</p><p>His thoughts racing, Qin Sang withdrew his gaze, paid the boatman, and boarded the official boat at Mu Gui Pass, as prearranged. There was no need to haggle.</p><p>The boatman weighed the payment, happily returned to steer the boat, and soon reached the gatehouse.</p><p>Qin Sang disembarked and went to one of the official boats, guided by a guard.  As he was about to board, his figure paused slightly, then he stepped onto the boat as if nothing was amiss.</p><p>The guard noticed nothing; the slight shift in the man’s aura went undetected.</p><p>The official boat wasn't elaborately furnished. The cabins were opened up, and everyone sat in the main hall; mostly commoners.</p><p>“Brother, today's the last day. It's almost noon. Why isn't your friend Liu here yet?”</p><p>In a corner of the hall, a man and a woman in Daoist robes sat at a round table.</p><p>The round table had ten seats, but this couple sat there. Commoners were wary of disturbing the cultivators and kept a wide berth, leaving even the adjacent tables empty.</p><p>The other cultivators on board, sensing the couple’s far superior cultivation, dared not approach.</p><p>The woman, wearing a light yellow Daoist robe with a Qingxin pendant, spoke, her tone lazy and slightly resentful.  She rested her chin on her arms, her little feet swinging beneath the table.</p><p>The man beside her, handsome and wearing a plain white robe, gently reassured her:  “It’s still an hour until noon.  Don’t worry, Sister. Brother Liu always keeps his word. He’ll definitely…”</p><p>At that moment, the man seemed to sense something and looked back, his gaze falling on Qin Sang, who had just entered.</p><p>Their eyes met. Qin Sang bowed slightly.</p><p>A man quickly rose, bowed in return, and hesitated before approaching Qin Sang, who had walked past them to sit inside.  The woman merely glanced at Qin Sang with narrowed eyes before losing interest.</p><p>Suddenly, the sky darkened. A fierce wind tore through the clouds, creating waves on the river.  A giant golden eagle, its wings spanning several dozen feet, appeared amidst the gale.</p><p>A cry of "Monster!" rang out. A dark shadow rose from the river, its eyes gleaming before disappearing beneath the surface.</p><p>Panic threatened to erupt within the cabin, until a Daoist priest called out, "It's not a monster!  A fellow Daoist's spirit-beast has manifested.  Fear not!"</p><p>The golden eagle spotted the official ship and swooped down, prompting more screams. The man and woman appeared above the ship.</p><p>The man raised his hand, and as the eagle neared, it shrunk to the size of a paper kite, fluttering in his palm before transforming into a talisman that drifted down.  He sighed.</p><p>"Brother Liu's sect summoned him urgently; he can't come," he said.</p><p>"I told you he was slippery and untrustworthy!" the woman scoffed.</p><p>"Sister, be careful what you say!" the man's tone sharpened. "Brother Liu used his most prized eagle talisman to send the message. He must have encountered a true emergency; he's not breaking his promise."</p><p>The woman snorted. "We've accepted the Mandate, and we must complete it on time.  Shen is already waiting for us.  Suddenly we're short a person. Where will we find help in this remote area? What do we do now?"</p><p>Her concern was valid; the man frowned. "Should we ask Senior Sister Yi for help? I don't know if it's still possible…"</p><p>He then seemed to remember something, his expression shifting. He pulled his sister back into the cabin.</p><p>The ship's captain hurried over to ask if they should set sail. The man dismissed him casually.  Soon, the ship vibrated slightly and glided into the water.</p><p>After observing for a while, the man rose and approached Qin Sang.</p><p>"Here we go," he thought.</p><p>Qin Sang, whose back was turned, was perfectly aware of the man’s approach. Along the journey, Qin Sang would often emanate an aura to attract attention, avoiding the need to fabricate a backstory. This air of mystery proved remarkably effective.</p><p>"Greetings, fellow Daoist." The man bowed from the side, as Qin Sang sat alone at his table.</p><p>"Greetings, Daoist," Qin Sang replied, gesturing to a seat.</p><p>The man readily sat opposite him. "I am Shi Xuan of the Jiu Hua Cave Heavens.  May I ask your name, Daoist?"</p><p>Qin Sang's tone remained cool.  "Qing Feng."</p><p>Shi Xuan paused.  "Qing Feng" was a common Daoist name. He realized it was probably an alias. Considering the man’s reticence and their destination, Shi Xuan suspected Qin Sang was heading to Ju Shan to hunt demons, seeking glory without the constraints of a sect.  He'd had similar aspirations once, but ultimately chosen a more pragmatic path.</p><p>Shi Xuan offered a respectful comment. "Daoist, you dare to undertake what others would not. I admire your courage."</p><p>Qin Sang didn't comment on Shi Xuan’s assumption. Shi Xuan became even more certain, adding,  "But you must act within your means."</p><p>"Do you believe my abilities are insufficient, Daoist Shi?" Qin Sang frowned.</p><p>Shi Xuan shook his head quickly. "Your cultivation is comparable to ours.  Your strength is sufficient for Ju Shan. However, demons are unpredictable.  One person can't always handle every situation. It’s best to find like-minded companions for mutual support."  He assessed Qin Sang’s cultivation to be around mid-Golden Core.</p><p>A sarcastic smile touched Qin Sang’s lips. "I'm not being rude, but I overheard your conversation.  You're looking for help with a significant undertaking, aren't you?"</p><p>Shi Xuan felt a blush of embarrassment, but also a stronger desire to recruit him. "Since you've seen through it, Daoist, I'll be frank.  My sister and I accepted a Mandate from the Northern Pole Exorcism Academy, to be completed in Ju Shan.  We invited two others, but one had an urgent matter preventing his attendance.  Time is short, and seeing you travelling alone, seemingly without pressing business, I hoped you might join us."</p><p>Qin Sang’s interest piqued. He'd heard of these Mandates, issued by the Daoist courts, outlining tasks and rewards.  Those confident in their abilities could accept them—a common practice in Ju Shan, often promising substantial rewards.</p><p>Qin Sang seemed somewhat interested, so Shi Xuan continued, "As long as Daoist Brother agrees, once we arrive at Jushan, I will tell you the details of the summoning ritual. After the matter is completed, we will share half of the merit with you, but the two treasures among the rewards must go to my younger sister and me."</p><p>Merit is one of the rewards for hunting demons and completing the summoning ritual, and it is said to be very useful.</p><p>Qin Sang had already planned to investigate the situation in Jushan first; this seemed like a convenient opportunity. After a moment's hesitation, he nodded.</p><p>Easily persuading a helper, Shi Xuan was overjoyed. He immediately invited Qin Sang to join their table and introduced the woman, "This is my junior sister, Luo Yin."</p><p>Luo Yin had delicate features, with a touch of mischievousness in her brows. Looking at the helper her brother had picked up halfway, her eyes showed undisguised doubt. She wrinkled her pretty nose, about to speak, when a hearty laugh came from outside the cabin.</p><p>"Luo Yin, Shen Da-ge is here; aren't you going to greet him?"</p><p>Luo Yin wrinkled her nose even tighter, "That annoying person is here!"</p><p>Several splashes of water.</p><p>The cabin suddenly darkened. Everyone subconsciously looked towards the door. A burly man, like an iron tower, was blocking the entrance.</p><p>The man was broad-shouldered and powerfully built, nine feet tall, and wider than a door, completely blocking the entrance.  His Taoist robe looked like tight-fitting clothing on him, bulging in all directions, making one worry it might burst.</p><p>Seeing the three people in the corner, the strong man laughed again, stepping into the cabin. The boat swayed twice.</p><p>"Luo Yin, haven't seen you in a year.  Have you missed your Shen Da-ge?"</p><p>"Shen Xiong, don't tease my junior sister; haven't you learned your lesson last time?" Shi Xuan smiled, getting up to greet him, leading the strong man to Qin Sang. "Let me introduce you both. This is my friend, Shen Huo, from the Shen family manor, and this is Daoist Qingfeng."</p><p>Shen Huo sized Qin Sang up, looking puzzled. "Didn't your message say you were inviting someone surnamed Liu? Why is it this Daoist Qingfeng?"</p><p>"Things have changed…"</p><p>Shi Xuan pulled Shen Huo to sit down and explained the reason in detail.</p><p>Shen Huo scoffed, "Luo Yin was right, the one surnamed Liu must have deserted.  I'll settle the score with him when I get back!"</p><p>Saying this, Shen Huo stood up, turning to Qin Sang, "Daoist Qingfeng, I don't beat around the bush. This matter is of great importance, and no mistakes are allowed. If you want me to fight alongside you with peace of mind, I need to test your strength."</p><p>Shi Xuan and his sister didn't stop him, turning their eyes to Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't spoken a word.</p><p>He had heard of Jiuhua Cave Heaven; it was a well-known force under the Northern Pole Exorcism Academy.</p><p>However, he didn't know where the Shen family mountain was.</p><p>From his observation, Shen Huo was likely a physical cultivator, and he also wanted to test the other's abilities.</p><p>"How do you plan to test me, Daoist Shen?"</p><p>Qin Sang calmly stood up, his tone calm and even.</p><p>"Let's just try it!"</p><p>Shen Huo laughed loudly, holding out his arm. A heavy black iron sword appeared in his hand.</p><p>The sword was taller than him, like a swinging door, yet he held it with ease.</p><p>"Be careful!"</p><p>With a swift turn of the sword, Shen Huo's arm muscles bulged, a golden light flowing as he swung the sword at Qin Sang!</p><p>Shi Xuan acted quickly, sending out a green light that filled the cabin, protecting the others.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>A powerful gust of wind hit their faces.  The sword's momentum was incredibly fierce; it could easily split the boat in half.</p><p>Qin Sang remained unfazed, slightly raising his head to glance at the sword shadow engulfing him, remaining motionless until the black iron sword was about to strike his head. Then, his right shoulder twitched slightly.</p><p>'Dong!'</p><p>A sound like a golden drum echoed through the sky.</p><p>The oncoming heavy sword suddenly stopped in mid-air.  Qin Sang had somehow raised his right fist, striking the side of the heavy sword.</p><p>Neither moved an inch.</p><p>But the ship beneath them shook violently, and a hundred-foot-high wave suddenly surged outside the ship, obscuring the sky before crashing down.</p><p>Shen Huo's wrist trembled slightly as he slowly put away his heavy sword, his eyes showing a strange light. He suddenly laughed heartily, "Wonderful! I didn't expect Daoist Qingfeng, who looks like a frail scholar, also cultivates the Dragon Tiger Altar like me, instead of the Martial Arts Altar!"</p><p>Qin Sang smiled and lowered his fist.</p><p>He already knew that not all Daoist cultivators recruited soldiers; some, like demon cultivators, cultivated their Qi and blood, creating the Dragon Tiger Altar.</p><p></p>
