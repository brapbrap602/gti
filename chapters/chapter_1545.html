<h1></h1><p>"How long has the Fairy been at Nine Ga Mountain?"</p><p>Qinsang rose to greet her.</p><p>"Three months."</p><p>Liuli walked in and took off her cloak.</p><p>The cloak she wore was very large, not only concealing her face but also completely covering her graceful figure. In the realm of the Buddhist Sect, such attire was somewhat unusual, but on Nine Ga Mountain, where all sorts of people mixed, it didn't seem so special.</p><p>This was because she had encountered a few arrogant individuals while traversing the Northern Barren Lands.</p><p>In the cultivation world, not every cultivator possessed sufficient self-control, and peerless beauty could easily attract trouble.</p><p>As it happened, Liuli's temperament was similar to Qinsang's. When traveling, she always maintained a low profile and would not proactively reveal her true cultivation unless absolutely necessary.</p><p>The fame of Profound Heaven Palace and Listening Snow Tower did not extend to the Central Province and could not deter evildoers.</p><p>Liuli had killed these people with a single strike of sword energy, but to avoid trouble, she simply donned the cloak, and things quieted down considerably afterward.</p><p>"Three months, that's exactly the time I was delayed in the Heaven-Splitting Valley..."</p><p>Qinsang invited Liuli to sit and briefly recounted his previous experiences.</p><p>"The Heaven-Splitting Valley is not far from the Nineteen States of Misty Rain, making it an excellent choice, but unfortunately, the cave dwelling was destroyed. I saved a Golden Core cultivator on the way and have sent him to the Nineteen States of Misty Rain to gather information. Once I obtain the Buddha Bone Relic, I will go there myself. If Xiaoxiang Zi's records are accurate, with luck, I might have the chance to take over a top-tier cultivation ground..."</p><p>It was true that the Nineteen States of Misty Rain were a sacred land for cultivation, but as far as Qinsang understood, the immortal mountains and great rivers were mostly occupied.</p><p>This was not a time of chaos. The various powers were deeply entrenched, interconnected, and mutually supportive.</p><p>Forcibly occupying another's mountain gate was clearly unfeasible and would surely make one a target of public criticism.</p><p>Moreover, the Central Province had Soul Formation stage cultivators overseeing it, and their strength was far from being able to act recklessly.</p><p>If they wanted to establish a foothold in the Central Province, they would either have to rely on a certain sect or choose a place in the Northern Barren Lands, the Western Desert, or the overseas immortal mountains to open a cave dwelling.</p><p>In that case, the cave dwelling's location would be too remote, far from the center of the cultivation world. Information wouldn't reach them in a timely manner. If something major happened, by the time they received the news and rushed to the Central Province, it would already be over.</p><p>Qinsang's goal was not only his own cultivation but also to gather various information and search for opportunities for Soul Formation.</p><p>He mentioned the cave dwelling matter in front of Liuli, implying an invitation for her to join him. Liuli was not only a powerful helper, but most importantly, she was trustworthy.</p><p>She came for the Buddha Bone Relic and, unlike Qinsang, was not entangled in various karmic ties. Her main tasks afterward were cultivation and investigating the mystery of the ascension of the Purple Micro Palace. It was more or less the same wherever she was.</p><p>Liuli hesitated, neither agreeing nor disagreeing.</p><p>Qinsang was familiar with Liuli's temperament and didn't mind. Recalling his discovery when he ascended the mountain, he asked, "Did something happen on Nine Ga Mountain? Those Buddhist cultivators seem a bit strange?"</p><p>Liuli nodded and said, "Ten days ago, Moonlight Bodhisattva arrived here and set up a Dharma altar on Nine Ga Mountain, attracting many monks to debate Buddhist scriptures with him."</p><p>"Bodhisattva?"</p><p>Qinsang was taken aback.</p><p>The Buddhist Sect revered Buddhas and Bodhisattvas.</p><p>Could it be that someone was carrying the statue of Moonlight Bodhisattva from a temple on a pilgrimage?</p><p>Liuli shook her head. "Moonlight Bodhisattva is said to have come from the depths of the desert. He is well-versed in Buddhist scriptures and possesses profound cultivation. He calls himself 'Bodhisattva.' He claims that unless someone can defeat him in debate, he will not change his Dharma name, and that is why there was that debate ten days ago."</p><p>Qinsang clicked his tongue.</p><p>Even Soul Formation stage cultivators of the Buddhist Sect were only honored as Sages, such as the current Sage Huiguang of the Sweet Dew Chan Temple.</p><p>To dare to use 'Bodhisattva' as a title, wasn't that presumptuous?</p><p>A debate was the least of it.</p><p>If that person was besieged on Nine Ga Mountain, Qinsang wouldn't be surprised.</p><p>Deep in the Western Desert, where few people tread and information is scarce, it's fine to call oneself a Buddha or Patriarch in such a place. No one would care. But to dare to be so presumptuous on Nine Ga Mountain, wasn't he afraid of attracting the Buddhist Sages?</p><p>"What was the result of the debate?"</p><p>Qinsang asked curiously.</p><p>Liuli hesitated for a moment. "I am not proficient in Buddhist scriptures... The debate lasted for three days, after which the monks were speechless, and Moonlight Bodhisattva drifted down the mountain. No one dared to stop him."</p><p>"Since he had the courage to call himself 'Bodhisattva,' he must have some ability."</p><p>Qinsang nodded. Those monks should have rushed over to help after receiving the news, but Moonlight Bodhisattva was no longer on Nine Ga Mountain.</p><p>Snow Lotus Mountain was known as the source of the Buddhist Sect, but it served more as a spiritual sanctuary for Buddhist cultivators. The current super sects of the Buddhist Sect were not located there, but mostly in the Central Province.</p><p>After three days of debate, he left as soon as the news spread.</p><p>This person was definitely also wary.</p><p>"During this time, Buddhist disciples have gathered here from all directions, and I took the opportunity to learn a lot of information."</p><p>With that, Liuli took out a sheepskin map, spread it on the table, and pointed to a spot in the desert. "The Buddha Bone Relic is most likely hereâ€”the Seven Stars of the Vast Sea!"</p><p>Qinsang was overjoyed.</p><p>"Thank you, Fairy!"</p><p>He quickly looked down and saw that Liuli's finger was pointing to a large oasis.</p><p>This oasis was not a single entity, but seven oases of varying sizes, connected in a line in the desert, not far from each other.</p><p>On each oasis, a prominent lake pattern was drawn.</p><p>The map was very simple, with only this information.</p><p>Liuli explained in detail, "The Western Desert is not uniform. The situation is ever-changing, and there are many countries. The cultivators of the Western Desert divide the desert into several areas based on different characteristics, such as Snow Lotus Mountain and the Vast Sea... These seven lakes have never dried up, nourishing the oases, like seven stars in the desert. Later, Buddhist cultivators built temples by the lakes. The Seven Stars of the Vast Sea also refer to the seven Buddhist temples by the lakes now. They are connected and are the overlords of the Vast Sea. Their strength should not be underestimated. According to my investigation, this place originally had a continuous stretch of oases and hundreds of lakes of various sizes, which later gradually merged, leaving seven large lakes. The previous environment matches the records of Senior Xiaoxiang."</p><p>"Ci'an Temple, Zhulan Temple..."</p><p>Qinsang's gaze swept across the seven Buddhist temples, and he looked up in confusion. "There's no Hidden Zen Temple?"</p><p>Senior Xiaoxiang mentioned that the Buddha Bone Relic was formed after the nirvana of an enlightened monk from the Hidden Zen Temple.</p><p>Liuli explained her reason for believing that the Buddha Bone Relic was in the Seven Stars of the Vast Sea. "There were no Buddhist temples here originally. Legend has it that a great and virtuous monk traveled here alone and saw that the people were not following the teachings. Therefore, he built a temple nearby to spread the Dharma, and that temple was the Hidden Zen Temple. After that, there was a great chaos in the Vast Sea, and the Hidden Zen Temple disappeared for some reason, but the number of Buddhist temples increased instead. Presumably, the Buddhist Sect prevailed. If the Hidden Zen Temple lost its lineage, the treasures in the temple most likely fell into the hands of these seven Buddhist temples."</p><p>Qinsang pondered silently.</p><p>As the saying goes, the vicissitudes of time.</p><p>Things in the world can change drastically with the slightest difference.</p><p>Even if Liuli's guess was completely correct.</p><p>He was afraid that the Hidden Zen Temple still had descendants at that time, who were forced to flee, taking all the treasures in the temple with them and going into hiding. It would be as difficult as ascending to heaven to find their trace again.</p><p>Liuli said, "Whether this Hidden Zen Temple is the same as the other Hidden Zen Temple still needs to be verified in the Vast Sea."</p><p>Qinsang nodded and said in a deep voice, "We should set off as soon as possible!"</p><p>There was another hidden concern that neither of them mentioned.</p><p>If they stole the relic from the Hidden Zen Temple, they would face the experts of one Buddhist temple.</p><p>Now, they were likely to provoke seven major Buddhist temples at the same time!</p><p>It was still too early to worry about this. It would be better to think of a solution after confirming the whereabouts of the Buddha Bone Relic.</p><p>Liuli had been in Snow Lotus Mountain for three months and had basically investigated all the information she could find. There was no need to waste any more time. Early the next morning, they went down the mountain together.</p><p>On the way down, the number of Buddhist cultivators was visibly increasing.</p><p>The turmoil caused by Moonlight Bodhisattva was still brewing and had a wide impact.</p><p>Not long after leaving Nine Ga Mountain, they entered the endless yellow sand. The air was dry and hot, forming clearly visible rolling heat waves in the void.</p><p>Of course, no matter how dangerous the Western Desert was, it couldn't be compared to the Storm Belt. The Ten Directions Earth-Breaking Divine Shuttle could easily handle it.</p><p>Although the environment here seemed harsh, it was actually the most vibrant place in the Western Desert.</p><p>The melted snow water from Snow Lotus Mountain branched out into several main streams and underground rivers, flowing southward. Although the scale was not as large as the Sky Tuo River, it also injected vitality into the desert.</p><p>Mortals lived along these rivers, and there were countless countries, most of which revered the Buddhist Sect, known as the Three Thousand Buddhist Kingdoms.</p><p>The Vast Sea was still south of the Three Thousand Buddhist Kingdoms.</p><p>This was not the deepest part of the Western Desert. Continuing westward was the true Desert of Death, a forbidden zone for living beings.</p><p>Qinsang and Liuli traveled and stopped, gathering information along the way. They passed through countless Buddhist kingdoms and experienced exotic customs, which was not a wasted trip.</p><p>When they were about to leave the Three Thousand Buddhist Kingdoms.</p><p>They unexpectedly learned a piece of news related to Moonlight Bodhisattva.</p><p>After the three-day debate on Nine Ga Mountain, Moonlight Bodhisattva left Nine Ga Mountain and disappeared without a trace. The Buddhist cultivators of the Western Desert searched everywhere, but to no avail.</p><p>Unexpectedly, ten days ago, Moonlight Bodhisattva suddenly appeared in a Buddhist kingdom, also boasting and setting up a Dharma altar.</p><p>Unfortunately, the great and virtuous monks there were even less impressive than those on Nine Ga Mountain. In less than a day, they were left speechless by Moonlight Bodhisattva and left in shame.</p><p>The Buddhist Sect was furious after being provoked one after another, and even many mortal monks began to stir.</p><p>Regardless of how the Buddhist Sect responded, Qinsang and Liuli went straight through the Three Thousand Buddhist Kingdoms, crossed the desert, and entered the Vast Sea.</p><p>The Seven Stars of the Vast Sea were in the hinterland of the Vast Sea.</p><p>They did not directly contact the Seven Stars of the Vast Sea, but settled in a market on the edge of the oasis.</p><p>Only when they arrived here did they know that there were actually not only these seven Buddhist temples in the seven oases, but also hundreds of temples built by mortal monks.</p><p>The prosperity of the Buddhist Sect in the Western Desert was evident.</p><p>At this time, Liuli was still covered in a cloak, while Qinsang was wearing a sea-blue robe, disguised as a Buddhist layman, wearing a bamboo hat.</p><p>The Vast Sea was a place prone to sandstorms. The strong wind whipped up sand and gravel, hitting the face with the power of a knife. The locals were also dressed similarly.</p><p>'Creak.'</p><p>Qinsang pushed open the door of the inn room and saw that Liuli had already returned.</p><p>They had just split up to gather information.</p><p>"I got a list of many Buddhist temples in the Vast Sea."</p><p>Qinsang closed the door and said softly, "It includes mortal temples. I scanned it roughly, and there is no Hidden Zen Temple. We need to verify them separately. There are some large temples that are suspected of having cultivators. We can start with them and quietly contact the Seven Stars of the Vast Sea."</p><p>Liuli proposed a guess: "During the great chaos, the Hidden Zen Temple may have only lost its cultivation lineage. The mortal monks in the temple may have changed the temple's name to avoid disaster."</p><p>Qinsang heard this and pondered for a moment. "It's possible, but in this case, we have to visit all the temples one by one."</p><p>"I'll go," Liuli said.</p><p>Qinsang understood her meaning.</p><p>The Seven Stars of the Vast Sea had Nascent Soul stage cultivators overseeing them. There was no doubt about this. However, since the fame of the Seven Stars of the Vast Sea spread, few forces had dared to challenge the status of the seven temples for a long time.</p><p>How strong the seven temples were now was hard to guess.</p><p>However, there were most likely no Grand Cultivators.</p><p>The Soul Formation stage cultivators of the Central Province were elusive, and late Nascent Soul stage cultivators were still the top powerhouses in the world.</p><p>In the Buddhist Sect, once a senior monk broke through to the late Nascent Soul stage, a grand Water and Land Dharma Assembly would be held as a custom, inviting fellow Daoists to celebrate.</p><p>According to the information they had gathered, the Seven Stars of the Vast Sea had never held such a Dharma Assembly.</p><p>Qinsang's divine sense could take form. If he deliberately concealed it, cultivators below the late Nascent Soul stage would not be able to see through his cultivation unless they used a secret detection technique in person. It was safest for him to contact the cultivators.</p><p>Liuli was a bit inferior in this regard.</p><p>"Alright."</p><p>Qinsang immediately took out the list, and the two divided the Buddhist temples into two categories and acted separately.</p><p>...</p><p>After Qinsang and Liuli separated, he began to travel alone in the oasis, either openly contacting or secretly investigating the details of these Buddhist temples.</p><p>Being too hasty might arouse suspicion, so Qinsang disguised himself as a Buddhist layman, pretending to worship devoutly, and his speed was therefore not fast.</p><p>Bei Shan Temple.</p><p>One of the Seven Stars of the Vast Sea, ranked sixth.</p><p>During this period, Qinsang had already entered the lowest-ranked Dengci Temple, but unfortunately, he failed to meet the abbot and only contacted a few young novice monks with shallow cultivation. He didn't get any valuable information.</p><p>Both Bei Shan Temple and Dengci Temple had no Nascent Soul cultivators. It was said that the abbots were only at the late Golden Core stage.</p><p>However, the formations in the temple were not ordinary and were definitely created by Nascent Soul cultivators.</p><p>Qinsang observed for a long time and determined that it was difficult for him to sneak in without alerting anyone. Therefore, he suppressed his impulse and patiently searched.</p><p>Bei Shan Temple was built by the lake and did not refuse mortals.</p><p>There was a constant stream of people and vehicles in front of the temple.</p><p>Qinsang followed the rules and lined up with the other worshippers to enter the temple.</p><p>He did not reveal his cultivation, but the bearing he had developed over years of cultivation was evident in his every move, making him stand out among the mortals and attracting the attention of the temple's usher monk.</p><p>Offering incense, worshipping Buddha, listening to scriptures...</p><p>Qinsang was already very familiar with these processes.</p><p>After absentmindedly listening to the senior monk's lecture, Qinsang got up and walked out of the Buddhist hall with the other believers. He was about to call a novice monk and find an excuse to visit the Buddhist temple when he suddenly felt a movement in his heart.</p><p>A moment later.</p><p>A monk came from not far away.</p><p>This person came head-on, but those pilgrims were completely unaware.</p><p>"Amitabha, may I ask this layman?"</p><p>The monk walked straight up to Qinsang, put his palms together, and bowed.</p><p>"This humble one greets the Abbot."</p><p>Qinsang hurriedly returned the salute, recognizing that this person was a late Golden Core stage cultivator and should be the abbot of Bei Shan Temple. He thought to himself that it took no effort at all.</p><p>Both of them knew that the other was a cultivator, so they did not adhere to common etiquette and exchanged Dharma names.</p><p>The abbot's Dharma name was Seng Yan.</p><p>Qinsang still used the same excuse, claiming that he was adopted by a monk in his childhood and given the name Mingyue. He should have been tonsured, but unexpectedly, the temple encountered a mishap, and he was once again left to wander the world.</p><p>Although he was fortunate enough to come into contact with the path of cultivation, he also created boundless sins. Now, looking back, he repented and made a grand vow to travel the ten directions and worship the hundred thousand Buddhas to eliminate his sins.</p><p>While speaking, Qinsang was invited to follow the abbot to a quiet Buddhist hall.</p>
