<h1>Chapter 1468: Journey to the Demon Realm (4k)</h1><p>Chapter 1468: Journey to the Demon Realm (4k)</p><p>A physical manifestation stood before Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't altered its appearance; it was a larger version of the Evolution Tree, with regular features, bearing no resemblance to its original.</p><p>Previously, due to the soul imprint within the Nascent Soul puppet, Qin Sang felt a blood connection to it. Now, the connection felt closer, like a part of Qin Sang's body, inseparable.</p><p>He closed his eyes to experience it.</p><p>Qin Sang opened his eyes and examined the physical manifestation.</p><p>Newly formed, it was not yet suitable for combat and required further refinement.  Only after the manifestation fully integrates the Ice Soul Divine Might and establishes a solid foundation will it reach its peak.</p><p>This process could take several years, or even decades, depending on the origin and strength of the manifestation's physical body. The Evolution Tree was no ordinary spiritual body, so it might not take too long.</p><p>However, due to the existence of the soul shadow, Qin Sang also needed to help his second primordial spirit absorb the shadow, hindering its use until completion.</p><p>Qin Sang waited patiently for a month, but there was no noticeable progress.</p><p>One day, Qin Sang retracted the physical manifestation into the Corpse Puppet Bag and decided to leave. He calculated that he had unknowingly spent almost a year in the underground Yin vein.</p><p>During this time, he hadn't returned to Listening Snow Tower once.</p><p>Shi Xue hadn't contacted him either.</p><p>He wondered how they ultimately dealt with Liuli's failed breakthrough.</p><p>Looking around, Qin Sang carefully erased all traces of creating the physical manifestation. His figure flickered as he flew out of the cave, seeing the long-lost sunlight.</p><p>It was noon, a clear sky.</p><p>The sunlight brought a touch of warmth.</p><p>Qin Sang steered his escaping light and slowly proceeded back to his Listening Snow Tower cave abode.</p><p>Only Shi Xue and Liuli knew of his presence at Listening Snow Tower; he was generally undisturbed.</p><p>Qin Sang spent some time in quiet cultivation in his cave abode, completely recovering from the fatigue and injuries sustained during the creation of his physical manifestation.</p><p>He awoke from meditation, a thoughtful expression on his face.</p><p>His main goals for this trip to Listening Snow Tower were accomplished: he had gained the status of Guest Elder and successfully created the physical manifestation. The Sacred Ground opening was still nine years away.</p><p>He would definitely need to return early to cooperate with Tong Lingyu and Listening Snow Tower, to secure a place at the Sacred Ground ceremony.</p><p>In the intervening years, he didn't need to stay at Listening Snow Tower.</p><p>He'd rushed to travel across the storm belt to the North Sea after breaking through to the mid-Nascent Soul stage. His true purpose was to search for the Killing Sword fragments and the subsequent cultivation techniques.</p><p>Unexpectedly, he was pursued by a Demon King upon arrival and subsequently encountered a series of events that led him from the Crescent Moon Realm to the Hidden Sun Realm, becoming a Guest Elder of Listening Snow Tower.</p><p>Although it seemed he had crossed the entire North Sea, his journey was hurried, leaving no time for a thorough search.</p><p>Now that most matters were settled, he could concentrate on his travels.</p><p>Qin Sang tentatively planned to depart from Listening Snow Tower, heading north into the Demon Realm, traversing the Demon Realm and the Star Sand Islands, taking a large detour back to the Crescent Moon Realm, and visiting Valley Master Mu of Hundred Flowers Valley along the way.</p><p>Then, he would travel the length of the Crescent Moon Realm, entering the Boundless Sea from the southern end, before returning to the Hidden Sun Realm, roughly covering all regions of the North Sea.</p><p>His primary focus would be finding the Killing Sword fragments, while avoiding involvement in other conflicts.  He had enough time.</p><p>With this in mind, Qin Sang rested briefly, then activated the mark on his Elder's token to contact Shi Xue, informing her of his departure.</p><p>Soon after,</p><p>A beam of icy escaping light landed before the cave. Shi Xue, seeing the formation was closed, entered.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang again, her expression was strange. She didn’t know how to evaluate her junior sister and this man.</p><p>After that incident, her junior sister had remained in seclusion at the Floating Snow Tower, never emerging, and this man had also been absent for a long time.</p><p>Both acted as if nothing had happened, showing extraordinary composure. It seemed only she was worried.</p><p>“Is Fairy Liuli still in seclusion?”</p><p>Qin Sang bowed and asked.</p><p>Shi Xue nodded. “I wouldn’t dare disturb her without her permission.”</p><p>Qin Sang knew Liuli must be resisting the evil cultivation mark, but he didn't know her method or its effectiveness.</p><p>After some hesitation, he said, “Please tell Fairy Liuli on my behalf that if she needs any assistance, I will provide what little help I can.”</p><p>Though he’d sacrificed himself to build his foundation, he still admired those with unwavering determination.</p><p>This path was undoubtedly more difficult and thorny.</p><p>Yet, Liuli had resolutely chosen it.</p><p>Furthermore, he wanted to use his status as a Listening Snow Tower Guest Elder to gain access to the Sacred Ground ceremony, helping Liuli, strengthening Listening Snow Tower, and elevating its standing within the Profound Heaven Palace, thus benefiting himself.</p><p>Liuli's imprint was connected to him, but Qin Sang had no leads on this matter.</p><p>He believed that the immortal cultivation world had countless miraculous methods, and there was no need to rely solely on dual cultivation to solve his problems.</p><p>"You have a bit of a conscience!"</p><p>Shi Xue glanced at Qin Sang, her gaze softening slightly, and she thanked him.</p><p>Next, Qin Sang changed the subject and asked about the friction between the Xuan Tian Palace and the demon race.</p><p>After listening to Shi Xue's account, Qin Sang learned the details. The battlefield between the two races was in the sea area between the Demon Realm and the Yinri Realm, and it had not yet spread to the heartlands of either realm.</p><p>However, the war was becoming increasingly fierce. The Great Saint Tianpeng was ambitious, and seemed to have noticed the strange situation of the Xuan Tian Palace Master, pressing him step by step.</p><p>Another Great Saint of the demon race, the Nine-Headed Great Saint, had not appeared, but was certainly supporting them secretly.</p><p>Grand Elder Tong Lingyu was being held back by Great Saint Tianpeng, and cultivators from all branches of the Xuan Tian Palace had sent their Yuan Ying stage cultivators to the battlefield.</p><p>Of the four branches of the Xuan Tian Palace, the Palace Master came from Xuan Tian, and the Grand Elder from Zi Xia Xuan, but the strongest overall was the Tian Shan branch.  Tian Shan cultivators were eager for battle, constantly clamoring for a decisive battle with the demons, a fight to the death.</p><p>This was something the Tingxue Tower did not want to see.</p><p>Once the war spread to the Yinri Realm's heartland, the Tingxue Tower, located in the northern region of the Yinri Realm, would be the first to suffer.</p><p>The Tingxue Tower was the weakest of the four branches, with the least influence. Its disciples were squeezed out by the Tian Shan branch and repeatedly sent on the most dangerous missions. Shi Xue was extremely stressed, planning to go to the battlefield herself to stabilize the situation.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered for a moment and asked, "Does Xuan Tian Palace have any spies planted among the demons?"</p><p>Shi Xue looked at him cautiously, finding it impossible that Qin Sang would collude with the demons. "There are some, but not many. They can't access important secrets. Because this is a conflict between two races, it's very difficult to buy off transformed demon kings.  We can only send some spirit beasts that have been raised in Xuan Tian Palace since childhood to infiltrate the Demon Realm."</p><p>This was roughly what Qin Sang had guessed.</p><p>He immediately said, "I plan to travel to the Demon Realm. If I find out some information, I can send it back through your spies and gain some merit."</p><p>Shi Xue understood Qin Sang's intentions. "If you are willing to join the battlefield and help Xuan Tian Palace repel the demons, it might allow you to directly enter the Sacred Land."</p><p>"Judging by the Grand Elder's tone, the stronger I show myself to be, the more wary Xuan Tian Palace will become of me. There's another Great Saint among the demons observing. My intervention will only incite greater fury from the demon race and won't change anything.  The conflict between the two races will be difficult to resolve in a few years. By the time the demons retreat, the Sacred Land will have long been closed."</p><p>Qin Sang had a clear understanding of the situation and didn't want to rashly get involved in the conflict in this realm.</p><p>He planned to suppress his cultivation to the early stage. In this way, when encountering other demon kings, it would be easy to explain his origins, claiming that he was previously unintelligent and muddleheaded, having just transformed.</p><p>Mid-stage transformed demon kings were too conspicuous; it would be impossible to appear out of nowhere without a plausible explanation.</p><p>Qin Sang's divine sense had reached the transformation stage, far surpassing his abilities when he first arrived at the North Sea. As long as he didn't directly confront the two demon saints or demons with particularly unique innate abilities, even mid-stage transformed demon kings wouldn't be able to see through his true cultivation.</p><p>"The demons are on high alert now.  If they see humans, they will certainly attack in a swarm. How do you plan to operate in the Demon Realm?" Shi Xue became even more curious about Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang smiled without answering, then suddenly remembered something. "How much do you know about the Demon Realm? Has the demon race already obtained the legendary route to the Bei Chen Realm?"</p><p>Shi Xue clearly knew of the Bei Chen Realm's existence. "Are you worried that they will bring help from the Bei Chen Realm? Even if the demons don't know the route, the two demon Great Saints certainly have the ability to cross the storm belt."</p><p>Unbeknownst to her, Qin Sang wasn't worried about Xuan Tian Palace, but about the Bei Chen Realm.</p><p>Previously, he hadn't expected the Demon Realm to be so strong, with two Great Saints.</p><p>Qin Sang suspected that the Feather King of Tian Yao Qiu and the two Great Saints had been in contact for a long time. Perhaps one of the Great Saints had disguised themselves during one of his visits to Zi Wei Palace. Otherwise, when the Bei Chen Realm established the Bei Chen Alliance and the human race set aside their grievances to form an alliance, Tian Yao Qiu would have already been filled with demonic anxieties.</p><p>Fortunately, the Demon Realm was being contained by the Xuan Tian Palace and other major forces, and the human race held an absolute advantage in the Bei Chen Realm. The Feather King probably also feared the two Great Saints, otherwise the northern region would already be under demon control.</p><p>…</p><p>Ten days later.</p><p>Qin Sang left Tingxue Tower and traveled north alone.</p><p>Not long after leaving the Yinri Realm, Qin Sang activated the Tian Yao Transformation, revealing his phoenix wings.</p><p>The human and demon races were currently arrayed on the sea, with Great Saint Tianpeng personally overseeing. To avoid the Great Saint, Qin Sang decided to travel east first to bypass this area.</p><p>He bypassed the battlefield and continued to fly north.</p><p>After flying several hundred miles, he could hardly see any human cultivators.  The further north he went, the more the land belonged to the demons.</p><p>Many islands showed clear signs of human presence – some were cities built by ordinary people, others were the caves of human cultivators – but now they were all demon beast paradises.</p><p>These traces were not very old.</p><p>It is understood that before the emergence of the two Great Saints, the demon race faced hardship, forced to retreat into their territory or hide in the deep sea.  They rarely dared to roam the waters outside their territory, and even within their territory, they had to be wary of human cultivators sneaking in for hunts.</p><p>This is how the deep-seated hatred between the human and demon races of the North Sea accumulated.</p><p>Back then, human presence was everywhere except within the demon realm.</p><p>Only after the two Great Saints rose to prominence and the demon race united did the tide turn. The Nine-Headed Great Saint, being aloof and rarely appearing, left the largely pent-up demon race to rally under the banner of the Sky鹏 Great Saint. Their first attack targeted the Star Sand Islands.</p><p>Now, the human population on the Star Sand Islands is almost annihilated, and the Sky鹏 Great Saint has set his sights on the Hidden Sun Realm.</p><p>Fortunately, the Xuan Tian Palace anticipated the Sky鹏 Great Saint's ambition and evacuated the overseas human population to the mainland in advance.  The losses weren't severe, but some gaps in the evacuation inevitably led to tragedies.</p><p>Qin Sang passed by island after island.  The remains of humans were common in the ruined cities; almost no survivors remained. Those who failed to retreat in time were devoured by demonic beasts.</p><p>The situation here differed from the Demon Sea.  Those humans who entered the Demon Sea were cultivators or descendants of cultivators, possessing the ability to escape the beast tides.  Here, however, the dead were mostly ordinary people.</p><p>Qin Sang's speed increased, and the traces of humanity became sparser, easing his burdened heart.</p><p>Upon reaching the northeast of the demon territory, Qin Sang altered his course westward, approaching the demon realm from the north, travelling discreetly. This area of the sea was vast, sparsely dotted with islands, each densely forested and vibrant.</p><p>Previously, demonic beasts frequently clashed here, their bloodlust and demonic energy permeating the air.  Lately, however, an unusual quiet reigned.</p><p>Suddenly, a black shark sliced through the waves, emitting a strong demonic aura.  The minor demons it encountered scattered in terror.</p><p>A person was astride the black shark.</p><p>This person had a large face, wide mouth, and an ugly appearance, but was nine feet tall and extremely burly.  He sported two antlers larger than his head, making him appear top-heavy.</p><p>This individual was clearly a transformed deer demon.</p><p>The black shark beneath him was a powerful demon in the Core Formation stage, yet behaved submissively before the deer demon king.</p><p>The deer demon king's eyes were closed, seemingly fast asleep.</p><p>Just then, the deer demon king suddenly awoke, his eyes flashing.  He pressed his hand on the black shark's head, glaring at the distant sea, "Who's there! Show yourself!"</p><p>The black shark, forcibly restrained, whimpered, blood welling up in its eyes, its fear palpable.</p><p>Under the deer demon king's intense gaze, a plume of water rose from the sea, revealing a blurry figure. This individual had feathered wings on his back and exuded a pure demonic aura – another demon king.</p><p>The deer demon king's expression softened slightly, then frowned again. "Which fellow cultivator is this? Hiding in the shadows – what's the meaning of this?"</p><p>"My name is Yuan Zhu. I'm merely passing through and did not intend to be discovered."</p><p>The figure in the water vapor remained distant, seemingly wary of the deer demon king, ready to flee at any moment.</p><p>"Yuan Zhu?"</p><p>The deer demon king pondered for a moment.  He didn't recognize the name. "I've never heard of you.  Which clan are you from? Are you affiliated with the Nine-Headed Great Saint?"</p><p>After much hesitation, the other party replied, "I'm affiliated with no one. I've always cultivated alone. Who are you?"</p><p>This demon was Qin Sang in disguise.</p><p>Humans were unfamiliar with the demon territory, and even the Xuan Tian Palace couldn't provide Qin Sang with accurate information.</p><p>Qin Sang sought fragments of the Killing Sword.  The demon realms and the lairs of the demon kings, including the two Great Saints, were unmissable. Fortunately, the sword spirit's sensing range was vast, eliminating the need for risky infiltration.</p><p>Additionally, Qin Sang planned to visit some 'old friends' before leaving the demon territory.</p><p>Tong Lingyu, misled by rumors spread by Feng Shangshi, found Bi Fang's lair.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Bi Fang was extremely alert and had recovered seven or eight tenths of his strength.  Sensing danger, he escaped through a secret passage. Although Tong Lingyu noticed this in time, Bi Fang still managed to escape, leaving behind only a cunning fox, whose interrogation revealed that the sacred object wasn't in their possession.</p><p>As for the Frog-Fish, its lair was exceptionally hidden, and Tong Lingyu didn't even catch sight of it.</p><p>For these endeavors, Qin Sang needed a detailed map of the demon realm. Obtaining one directly from a demon king would be fastest.</p><p>Most of the demon forces had been subjugated by the Sky鹏 Great Saint, and he was unsure if the deer demon was a subordinate. The disappearance of a demon king would surely arouse the Sky鹏 Great Saint's suspicion.  Killing a demon king without any prior action would invite trouble, so Qin Sang chose to reveal himself and engage the deer demon king.</p>
