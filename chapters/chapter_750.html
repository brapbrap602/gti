<h1>Chapter 742: The Token</h1><p>"Daoist Qin, you're living the high life with your two beauties, making everyone else envious. Aren't you afraid of dying in the Seven Killing Palace, leaving those sisters to find new lovers and cuckold you?"</p><p>Cui Ji was publicly defeated by Qin Sang and unceremoniously kicked off the island, a humiliation he hadn't forgotten.</p><p>Given his temperament, he'd wanted revenge right then.</p><p>However, Elder Zou had warned him privately and pressured him through the Merchant Alliance's rules. Cui Ji knew he was in the wrong and had been outmatched, so he had to accept his loss.</p><p>He was unwilling to admit it, but he was somewhat afraid of Qin Sang.</p><p>The crippled man's magic weapon was too strange and powerful, capable of turning the tide of battle.  It took Cui Ji a long time to restore his own primary magic weapon's spirit.</p><p>Now, seeing Qin Sang, old and new grudges surfaced, and he couldn't help but taunt him.</p><p>The others immediately perked up, watching with interest as their gazes shifted between the two.  They hadn't expected to find a rivalry among just eight people.  This promised good entertainment.</p><p>Xiang Yi frowned deeply.</p><p>Qin Sang said indifferently, "Before I ascend, Daoist Cui will likely have already gone down below to scout the way for me. I just wonder if, in the Nine Serenities, you'll still be so sharp-tongued."</p><p>Xiang Yi stopped their quarrel, warning coldly, "Whatever grievances you two have, you best forget them once we enter the Seven Killing Palace. If our alliance's important mission is jeopardized because of infighting, I will hold you accountable! Believe me, no matter how powerful your backers are within the Merchant Alliance, they won't be able to protect you!"</p><p>Cui Ji had no choice but to give up, sitting on his stool silently, glaring at Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't care.  He hadn't needed the Twin-Headed Serpent back then, and he wouldn't need it to take down Cui Ji now.</p><p>If Cui Ji dared to cause trouble, the Seven Killing Palace would be his burial ground!</p><p>Once everyone had arrived, Xiang Yi took out a golden box from his storage pouch, opened it in front of everyone, and took out eight jade pendants. "These pendants are the tokens for this mission. One for each person. You'll need these to enter the Seven Killing Palace."</p><p>Xiang Yi paused, raising his hand. The pendants flew towards everyone.</p><p>Qin Sang caught his pendant and scanned it with his divine sense. He discovered that the jade was quite fragile, but it contained an incredibly intricate restriction, making it impossible to replicate.</p><p>Afterwards, everyone took turns asking about the Seven Killing Palace and exchanged information.</p><p>Of the eight people present, only Xiang Yi had been inside the Seven Killing Palace, during its previous emergence. The others were going for the first time.</p><p>Although Qin Sang had gathered much information beforehand, it couldn't compare to Xiang Yi's firsthand experience. Naturally, he seized this rare opportunity to ask Xiang Yi for guidance.</p><p>With the opening of the Seven Killing Palace imminent, the group wasted no time after assembling. They took a teleportation formation back to the Inner Sea.</p><p>…</p><p>Opposite Great Wilderness Island, the teleportation formation was located on the largest human island—Skyrise Island.</p><p>It was said that during the Demon Tribe's rise, when humanity was most vulnerable, they had relied on this island to gain a foothold. Therefore, Skyrise Island held a special status among humans.</p><p>Skyrise Island housed the largest human city. Qin Sang had long yearned to see it, but time was tight. He couldn't explore properly and had to leave the island with Xiang Yi.</p><p>The Inner Sea was noticeably safer than the Demon Sea. Although the deep sea also concealed monstrous beasts, they weren't as numerous as in the Demon Sea.</p><p>Traveling together, the eight experts didn't need to be overly cautious. They took turns piloting a flying shuttle, traveling day and night southeastward.</p><p>Their destination was East Gate Island. It was said that entering the storm from here was one of the safer routes to the Seven Killing Palace.</p><p>East Gate Island was actually a small island. It was said that it originally housed only a small, unknown sect, becoming lively only when the Seven Killing Palace was about to open.</p><p>When they arrived at East Gate Island, many experts had already gathered.</p><p>Descending from the sky, before even entering the city, Qin Sang sensed powerful and concealed auras within, some of which belonged to Nascent Soul Patriarchs!</p><p>Everyone subconsciously restrained themselves, keeping a low profile.</p><p>"Let's go. We'll rest in the city for a while before entering the storm."</p><p>Xiang Yi led the way into the city.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced back. To the east of East Gate Island, the seawater seemed darker than elsewhere. At the edge of his vision, a black line stretched across the vast sea surface, seemingly endless from south to north.</p><p>That was the infamous Storm Belt.</p><p>It wasn't the first time he'd heard of the storm's terrors.  Fortunately, the Seven Killing Palace wasn't located deep within the storm, and the storm's power increased the further in one went.</p><p>With their cultivation levels, they could still endure the journey to the Seven Killing Palace.</p><p>The group rented a courtyard in the city. Xiang Yi warned them not to cause trouble and avoid implicating others. The cultivators on the island were either powerful themselves or had strong backgrounds, and none were to be trifled with. There were also many unruly individuals, making it easy to invite trouble.</p><p>Qin Sang was curious. From Great Wilderness Island until now, Xiang Yi hadn't let them interact with other Eastern Apex Alliance teams.</p><p>Such a large alliance couldn't possibly have only eight spots.</p><p>It was strange that all the teams were isolated. It seemed the Eastern Apex Alliance had grand plans.  He wondered what treasure was worth such a large-scale operation.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't dwell on it, nor did he want to delve deeper.</p><p>He was here for the ancient teleportation formation and didn't want to be caught in a major storm.</p><p>He also knew that he had only agreed to assist Xiang Yi in exchange for a spot, not to risk his life.  If danger arose, he would prioritize his own escape.</p><p>The others likely shared the same thought.</p><p>Closing the door to his room, Qin Sang sat quietly for a moment, then took out a set of formation flags and arranged them, adding several layers of restrictive barriers.</p><p>Once he was sure there were no gaps, Qin Sang took out the jade box containing the Winter Nether Cold Flame.  He hesitated for a moment, but finally opened the box.</p><p>Over the years, he had been pondering how to deal with the Winter Nether Cold Flame.</p><p>Refining it into a fire pearl seemed too wasteful. Such a rare cold flame – not being able to claim it felt like a missed opportunity.</p><p>However, multiple attempts to tame it had failed. Winter Nether Patriarch's mark had fused with the flame, and the flame itself might have even been born from him.</p><p>His cultivation was still too low; he didn't stand a chance.</p><p>He was about to enter the Seven Killing Palace, a place that concerned his future. He couldn't hesitate any longer.</p><p>The Void Thunder was the signature treasure of the Void Spirit Sect. The notes left by the Golden Core cultivator naturally wouldn't contain the sect's refining method, but they did mention it briefly.</p><p>Qin Sang had once possessed a Void Thunder and had spent a long time studying it.</p><p>Most importantly, although the Winter Nether Cold Flame was violent, it was docile in the presence of the Nine Serenities Demonic Fire. This essentially solved the biggest difficulty, an advantage the Void Spirit Sect didn't possess.</p><p>As long as Qin Sang didn't make any mistakes, he didn't need to worry about backlash.</p><p>There was a high chance he could, drawing inspiration from the Void Thunder, refine the Winter Nether Cold Flame into a fire pearl.</p>
