<h1>Chapter 1115: Parting in Life and Death</h1><p>Before entering seclusion, Qin Sang left Peach Blossom Valley and visited several nearby large-scale markets. As a senior elder of the Illusory Mist Sect, he no longer needed to sneak around. He discreetly sold some demon cores and bones, acquiring several treasures he needed. For the rest, he entrusted the merchants to help him gather them, offering a generous price.</p><p>Afterward, Qin Sang hurried back to the Great Sui Dynasty to inform Li Yufu of the location of his cave abode. He stayed there for a while, guiding Li Yufu and his two companions in their cultivation and providing them with resources. Before forming his Nascent Soul, Qin Sang had no intention of diverting his attention to building a faction, so he let them cultivate on their own. This seclusion might last many years, and he felt it was his duty as their master to fulfill his responsibilities.</p><p>Li Yufu was only at the early Golden Core stage, so Qin Sang’s guidance was more than sufficient. As for Tan Yien and Bai Hanqiu, they were even less of a concern.</p><p>“If your grandmaster returns or you encounter any trouble, send me a message. The current situation is still unclear, and the cultivation world is filled with undercurrents, especially regarding the Pure Yang Sect. Many factions are eyeing the legacy left by the Crimson-Haired Ancestor. During this time, try to avoid venturing out too much to avoid getting caught up in the chaos…” Qin Sang instructed Li Yufu and the others before leaving.</p><p>“We will obey, Master,” the three replied, bowing respectfully as they saw Qin Sang off.</p><p>On his way back, Qin Sang detoured through the territory of Mount Shaohua. Disguised as an elder of the Illusory Mist Sect, he moved more freely and managed to gather some news about old acquaintances.</p><p>For example, Qi Yuanshou, the former Uncle Qi, had unfortunately died in battle against the Sin Abyss.</p><p>Qin Sang’s feelings toward Qi Yuanshou were complicated. Before learning the truth, Qin Sang had received guidance from Qi Yuanshou multiple times and held no ill will toward him. In fact, he had even relied on him as a pillar of support. It was true that Qi Yuanshou had aided the tyrant, constantly monitoring Qin Sang on behalf of Dongyang Bo, with ulterior motives. However, without Qi Yuanshou’s covert protection, Qin Sang’s time at Mount Shaohua would not have been so smooth. Whether it was the internal strife within the sect or external turmoil, none of it affected him, allowing him to focus solely on cultivation.</p><p>In their few interactions, Qin Sang could sense that Qi Yuanshou harbored a trace of goodwill toward him, perhaps out of guilt or for other reasons. Yet, Qi Yuanshou dared not defy Dongyang Bo’s orders. Qin Sang empathized with Qi Yuanshou’s helplessness, but that did not mean he could forgive and forget all grievances. There was a debt to be settled, and Qin Sang’s focus was on Dongyang Bo. Perhaps the best outcome was for him and Qi Yuanshou to part ways and never cross paths again.</p><p>Unexpectedly, upon his return, Qin Sang received the tragic news. Qi Yuanshou had not been buried at Mount Shaohua; his grave was in his hometown. A century had passed, and the solitary grave was nearly overgrown. In death, the path of cultivation vanished, leaving no trace—just like mortals. For reasons unknown, Qin Sang visited Qi Yuanshou’s grave, stood there for a moment, sighed, and then left on his sword.</p><p>Next, Qin Sang visited a mortal kingdom within Mount Shaohua’s territory. There, a cultivation family, the Wen family, resided. The Wen family was not particularly powerful, managing a nearby mortal nation on behalf of Mount Shaohua. Among them was an outsider elder, Zhuang Yan.</p><p>Zhuang Yan had married his betrothed, and together they pursued the path of dual cultivation, eventually reaching the Foundation Establishment stage. However, their progress stalled at the mid-Foundation Establishment level. Realizing that their path to immortality was hopeless, they lost their will to continue and eventually left the sect, returning to Zhuang Yan’s master’s family to start a new life.</p><p>This was the same Senior Brother Wen who had introduced Qin Sang to Mount Shaohua when he first joined. Senior Brother Wen had long since passed away and was buried in the Wen family’s back mountain.</p><p>At the foot of the mountain, by a picturesque lakeside, stood a bustling courtyard. An elderly man sat in a reclining chair, a few bamboo fishing rods before him, his eyes half-closed as if on the verge of sleep. This was Zhuang Yan.</p><p>Suddenly, a water dragon burst from the lake, its claws outstretched as it lunged toward the old man. However, it disintegrated into droplets before reaching him, startling the fish away.</p><p>“You little rascal! How dare you ambush your grandfather!” Zhuang Yan opened his eyes, a hint of amusement in his gaze as he watched a young girl skip toward him.</p><p>“Grandpa, I mastered the ‘Water Condensation Art’ in just a few days! Isn’t that enough to join Mount Shaohua?” The girl pouted, tugging at the old man’s arm.</p><p>“You’ve still got a long way to go! Train hard for a few more years, and then I’ll send you to Mount Shaohua. That way, no one will look down on our Zhuang family,” Zhuang Yan said, tapping the girl’s nose. A trace of worry flickered in his eyes. He was over two hundred years old, with one foot already in the grave. His lifespan was nearing its end, and he could no longer protect the younger generation.</p><p>The shadow of the Sin Abyss loomed over the Cold Domain. The cultivation world was in turmoil, and these younger generations were born into the most chaotic of times. Even if they joined Mount Shaohua, their fates were uncertain. Over the years, many Mount Shaohua disciples had died on the battlefield.</p><p>Zhuang Yan suddenly thought of an old friend.</p><p>“Ah, if only Junior Brother Qin were still alive. With his determination, he would surely have formed his Golden Core… Why did he leave before me?” Zhuang Yan often lamented this with deep regret.</p><p>As if sensing something, he suddenly looked up.</p><p>“Grandpa, what’s wrong?” The girl turned to look at the lake.</p><p>The lake was empty.</p><p>Zhuang Yan shook his head, suddenly feeling weary. He gathered his belongings and, with the girl’s support, walked unsteadily back to the courtyard.</p><p>…</p><p>Qin Sang passed by the Wen family, paying his respects to Senior Brother Wen and catching a distant glimpse of Zhuang Yan. This might be their final meeting, but Qin Sang could not reveal himself. Zhuang Yan had never formed his Golden Core. Yet, he had spent his life with the one he loved, raising children and grandchildren. Perhaps that was a kind of happiness in itself.</p><p>Qin Sang pushed aside his thoughts and returned directly to Peach Blossom Valley. Qing Jun was not in the valley. Qin Sang returned to his cave abode to prepare for seclusion.</p><p>Bai emerged from the Corpse Puppet Bag, choosing a room to enter seclusion with Qin Sang, vowing not to leave until he fully comprehended the Soul Pearl.</p><p>“This Peach Blossom Valley is truly remarkable, and its master is extraordinary. Even while in the Corpse Puppet Bag, I could sense a hint of her sharp aura. However, I was in a critical stage of comprehending the Soul Pearl at the time and couldn’t show myself. I felt a similar presence from Qing Zhu. Truly, like father, like daughter—both are extraordinary,” Bai spoke highly of Qing Jun. “It’s impolite to stay here without permission. When the opportunity arises, I must personally pay my respects to the master.”</p><p>“Be careful when comprehending the Soul Pearl. Do not damage the peach forest,” Qin Sang warned. He had no desire to incur Qing Jun’s wrath.</p><p>After a brief discussion, the two returned to their respective cave abodes. Qin Sang activated the protective formations and summoned the Heavenly Eye Butterfly. The butterfly’s cultivation could not fall behind, as it would be crucial for his Nascent Soul formation. Fortunately, he had acquired some spirit herbs to nurture the Heavenly Eye Butterfly, nearly completing the formula. The butterfly’s growth would now be faster than before.</p><p>After consuming the spirit herbs, the Heavenly Eye Butterfly perched on Qin Sang’s shoulder, nestling close as it fell into a deep sleep.</p><p>What Qin Sang needed to do next was to quickly restore his previous cultivation level. Reconstructing the Killing Talisman was much easier this time. Qin Sang immersed himself in meditation, connecting his mind to the Ebony Sword, comprehending the true essence of the Killing Talisman as his cultivation rapidly advanced.</p>
