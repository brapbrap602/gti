<h1>Chapter 2159: The Glow Reappears</h1><p>It came as a surprise to everyone that someone had beaten them to it.</p><p>“Did you encounter any other competitors before?” An Lingfei asked, her brows furrowed.</p><p>Si Huang frowned: “There should be more than one entrance to this place, but they are far apart, leading to different paths.  I sensed traces of other people's activities inside before, but their progress was far behind ours, and the location of this entrance has never been revealed.”</p><p>“I can’t detect any unusual activity nearby. How did you discover it, Your Majesty?”</p><p>Qin Sang asked, “Were the markers you left last time destroyed?”</p><p>“Precisely!” Si Huang nodded slightly, his expression shifting.</p><p>Qin Sang mused, “Therefore, we can deduce that the other party is not an insider within the royal family, but they are very familiar with this place. They certainly didn't stumble into it by accident and possess considerable strength. Otherwise, they would have left subtle traces.”</p><p>At this point, everyone else understood Qin Sang's meaning.</p><p>The Crown Prince said solemnly, “In other words, these people are probably the previous competitors. Last time, they might have discovered the whereabouts of the Emperor, or deduced the location of this entrance. This time, they rushed in ahead of us to reap the rewards!”</p><p>At least two trials of the Sacred Land ago, the Si You royal family began preparations, gradually overcoming internal difficulties. This time, they were exceptionally well-prepared and had high hopes of success.  The fact that someone else was trying to steal their success filled the Crown Prince and the others with indignation.</p><p>Si Huang remained silent, seemingly pondering his last experience, his expression darkening.</p><p>“The beasts outside were likely deliberately left there,” the Shao Shi suddenly said.</p><p>Everyone was startled.</p><p>Those people didn't kill the beasts, and weren't afraid of the beasts disrupting things at a critical moment. This suggested they knew someone would deal with them later.  The other party could simply perform some actions on the beasts to know if they had been killed!</p><p>In this way, both sides would be aware of each other's presence, and the covert struggle would escalate into an open conflict!</p><p>The only advantage for Si Huang and his party was that their opponents were unaware of their knowledge of the competition.</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't expected the situation to become so tense before they even entered. She frowned slightly, secretly thinking that this journey would likely be far from easy and wondered if obtaining a [illegible character] pearl was worth the trouble.</p><p>Knowing that the Si You royal family had been planning for this for a long time, and that they were determined to get their hands on it, the opponent still dared to snatch it away – they must have confidence in their own abilities.</p><p>“There's no point in overthinking it. Let's go in! I want to see who dares to be so reckless!”</p><p>Si Huang said coldly, taking the lead and stepping into the tomb passage.</p><p>Everyone followed in turn. The passage was rather narrow, so they changed their formation. Si Huang led the way, Qin Sang and Shao Shi followed on either side, slightly behind, and the others trailed behind silently.</p><p>Knowing that there was an opponent inside, they all used spells to conceal their auras and proceeded cautiously.</p><p>The passage was long but thankfully straight.</p><p>According to Si Huang, initially the passage was filled with powerful restrictions, making it extremely difficult to progress. The royal family had paid a considerable price to overcome all the restrictions and clear the passage.</p><p>The passage sloped downwards. After traveling for a while, nearing the end of the passage, they still found no trace of their opponent, demonstrating just how cautious they were.</p><p>A cold current of air blew towards them.</p><p>They reached the end of the passage, and a faint light appeared ahead—a stone door.</p><p>The restrictions on the stone door had already been broken by the Si You royal family; the opponent could also open it without any effort.</p><p>Si Huang stepped forward, placing his hand on the stone door. After sensing for a moment, he confirmed there was no ambush behind the door and infused it with his true energy. The stone door gradually became transparent, transforming into an invisible door, leading to an unknown location.</p><p>Shao Shi and Qin Sang stepped forward and followed Si Huang through the door.</p><p>‘Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!’</p><p>A violent wind howled in their ears.</p><p>After passing through the door, they didn't find themselves in another passage but in a void, surrounded by swirling black mist. The mist flowed extremely fast, like a massive black river, endlessly flowing towards an unknown region in the depths of the void.</p><p>Qin Sang turned around; her eyes met with the endless black mist, flowing continuously, washing over them.</p><p>They were in the center of the mist river and felt a powerful force pushing them downstream. To avoid being swept away, they had to circulate their true energy to resist the impact.</p><p>At the same time, Qin Sang sensed a pervasive, bone-chilling energy that could penetrate anything. Fortunately, she was also a body cultivator and could counteract this coldness by circulating her blood energy.</p><p>Shao Shi wasn't so lucky. He summoned a protective treasure, creating a layer of light around himself.</p><p>This mist seemed somewhat similar to the foul qi of the Nie River, but it wasn't as chaotic or violent.</p><p>‘Swish! Swish!’</p><p>The Crown Prince and others appeared, all employing their own protective measures.</p><p>Suspended in the heart of the Mist River, Qin Sang sensed something amiss.  To her surprise, the tomb passage they'd entered seemed to have vanished, leaving no trace.</p><p>"The entrance appears intermittently, but the fluctuations are extremely subtle and easily missed," explained Si Huang. "Over the years, we've only found this one. Fortunately, its location remains constant. Remember this spot; if you encounter any problems, you can return here to leave."</p><p>"Will the area around the entrance change?" Qin Sang asked.</p><p>Bound by the Tai Xu Golden Book, Si Huang couldn't lie.  "The entrance won't change, but the Mist River will. We need to go downstream; returning will require upstream travel. The current's speed and force will increase with time. However, being in the river, we can sense the changes and retreat accordingly."</p><p>Qin Sang understood. This acted as a time limit.  If the current became insurmountable, they'd be lost, with no knowing what lay ahead.  The presence of unknown rivals added to the difficulty.</p><p>"Still no sign of those others," Shao Shi remarked.</p><p>Surrounded by the Mist River, they couldn't see any boundaries. The black 'water' limited visibility and perception. The downstream view was pure darkness, their opponents' identities unknown.</p><p>Suddenly, everyone turned to see a red light point appear behind them in the river. It bobbed up and down, drifting towards them.  Up close, they saw a red crystal within the light.</p><p>"It's a Chong Gui crystal," Si Huang said. "Ge'er, retrieve it."</p><p>A flicker of joy crossed the Crown Prince's eyes. He needed several rare materials for a magical artifact he was crafting, and the Chong Gui crystal was one of them.  He summoned his companion beast, a fox-like creature, small as a mouse but with a tail many times its body length. The beast’s tail lashed out, striking the red light.</p><p>With a *whoosh*, the tail pierced the light and easily touched the crystal. But as the tail wrapped around and pulled, something unexpected happened.</p><p>The red light erupted, unleashing an incredibly sharp energy wave that sent a chill down the Crown Prince’s spine.  A direct hit would decapitate the beast!</p><p>Everyone, including Si Huang, watched without interfering, confident the Crown Prince could handle it.  He roared, summoning a treasure bell above the light. The bell descended, momentarily halting the red light’s advance.</p><p>Seizing the opportunity, the beast pulled the crystal free, clutching it tightly as it fled back to the Crown Prince.  With the crystal gone, the red light ceased its pursuit, flickered a few times, and dissipated.</p><p>Si Huang explained, "While traveling here, you may encounter similar light clusters, varying in color. Some contain treasures, others might be minor hidden realms, but many are traps. In my experience, black and white clusters are mostly traps – best avoided.  Others can be investigated, but with enemies nearby, I urge you to resist temptation until our task is complete."</p><p>Everyone agreed.</p><p>Chao Keqing gazed upstream, murmuring, "So many treasures scattered here, like fragments… is there a shattered secret realm upstream?"</p><p>Si Huang shook his head. "We tried, but the river's force became insurmountable before we reached the upstream." He then relinquished his control, allowing the current to carry them downstream.  With the river's push, they moved swiftly.</p><p>Soon, they encountered a second light cluster, this one black.  Remembering Si Huang’s warning, they kept their distance, fearing a trap. Qin Sang used his celestial vision, seeing only darkness, but a sense of being watched made him uneasy. The feeling vanished when he looked away.</p><p>This experience made Qin Sang realize these light clusters weren't all as easily handled as the Chong Gui crystal. They encountered more, but refrained from acting.</p><p>After a while, Si Huang stopped, announcing, "The first ancient array lies ahead."</p><p>Qin Sang immediately felt a change in the current; they plunged downwards, as if into a waterfall.  They stabilized themselves, seeing countless black stones floating before them.</p><p>The stones were identical in size and shape, differing only in the surface patterns—clearly special runes.  Arranged meticulously, they formed a magical array.  Si Huang's face darkened as he saw several stones in front of them were heavily cracked and damaged.</p><p>The royal family had thoroughly investigated this stone array. Before their last departure, they altered its formation, blocking the entrance.</p><p>The array showed clear signs of previous damage.  The perpetrators could have used gentler methods, but they clearly didn't want to hide anymore, likely because they were being pursued.</p><p>Si Huang coldly snorted, waved his hand, and nearby stones began to shift, ethereal light flowing between them.</p><p>'Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!'</p><p>Rocks flew through the air.</p><p>In an instant, the array transformed, revealing a passage.  Even the mist river couldn't stop them; they continued to endure its force as they passed through.</p><p>They quickly traversed the stone array, only to find another ancient array blocking their path.</p><p>To the naked eye, it was just a blinding curtain of light, but the reality was far more complex.</p><p>This array had also been breached by the Si You royal family. Unlike the stone array, it wasn't easily manipulated; a previous opening remained, allowing easy passage for their opponents.  The Si You royal family's efforts had ultimately benefited others.</p><p>The crown prince and others were furious, vowing revenge.</p><p>Passing through the opening, they arrived at a third ancient array, also damaged.</p><p>Just as they were about to enter, Qin Sang sensed something amiss.</p><p>He paused, noticing Si Huang and the Shao Shi's changed expressions.</p><p>He felt an unusual energy emanating from deep within the mist river, a sense of unease washing over him.</p><p>Everyone felt it; it wasn't an illusion.</p><p>"My lord, what is that?" An Lingfei whispered.</p><p>Si Huang shook his head slightly.</p><p>Even Si Huang was uncertain, filling everyone with apprehension. What had happened?</p><p>'Hum!'</p><p>A tremor, like a muffled thunderclap, shook the ground.</p><p>Caught between two arrays, they witnessed both begin to destabilize.</p><p>The crown prince's face fell. "Have they started breaking the arrays?"</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>A much stronger tremor erupted ahead.</p><p>Thunderous booms echoed around them, and to their astonishment, several cracks appeared in the array before them.</p><p>Through the fissures, they could glimpse the mist river's depths.</p><p>Shao Shi's face paled. He pointed at one crack, exclaiming, "Qin Zhenren, look!"</p><p>Qin Sang had already noticed.  Brilliant, vibrant light shone from within the mist river.</p><p>A foreboding feeling washed over him. "This light... could it be...?"</p><p>Shao Shi solemnly nodded.  Even in this fleeting glimpse, the light was almost identical to Ji Qiong's description.</p><p>Why was this light appearing here?</p><p>Was this another dangerous nest?</p><p>Qin Sang subtly retreated behind the others.  If not for the constraints of the Tai Xu Golden Book, which prevented him from sensing the oppressive aura of a great beast, he would have already escaped using his lightning escape technique.</p><p>"There are no sacred beast lairs here!"</p><p>Si Huang declared firmly, insisting the Si You royal family wouldn't intentionally seek death.</p><p>His words were barely out when—</p><p>The mist river violently convulsed.  They watched as the array before them tore apart, a massive crack splitting the entire structure.</p><p>The fissure revealed the depths of the mist river, where incredibly bright light gushed forth. This beautiful light carried an overwhelming power, instantly putting them on high alert.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>The mist river surged back.</p><p>Waves of mist, laced with light, crashed towards them, a force stronger than the river's natural current.</p><p>"Retreat!"</p><p>Si Huang commanded, and everyone fell back.  Caught between the incoming wave and the retreating force, their situation was precarious.  Fortunately, they were all highly skilled cultivators who remained calm under pressure, retreating while keeping a close eye on the light, and they made a new discovery.</p><p>At the edge of the light, several dark shapes appeared, retreating just like them, looking disheveled.  Clearly, they were the ones who had gotten there first.</p><p>Si Huang's eyes narrowed as he focused on the figures.  His voice was icy. "It's the Feather people!"</p><p>They saw that the figures had wings on their backs, frantically beating them to withstand the light's force.</p>
