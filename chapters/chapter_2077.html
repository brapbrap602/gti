<h1>Chapter 2068: Return!</h1><p>Ziwei Palace.</p><p>Ancient Sword Hall.</p><p>A teleportation array, silent for a hundred years, suddenly glowed faintly.</p><p>The light flickered.</p><p>Soon, a figure appeared out of thin air on the array, stumbling slightly before steadying themselves by grasping a stone pillar at the array's edge.</p><p>Qin Sang’s face was pale. He shook his head, and seeing the familiar surroundings, a look of emotion crossed his face.</p><p>The ancient hall.</p><p>The altar.</p><p>The spirit array.</p><p>After more than a hundred years, he had finally returned. This time, he experienced the teleportation while conscious, making it even more real. Even with his current cultivation, he felt dizzy and nauseous, with a sensation that his body was about to be torn apart. The spatial impact and compression during the teleportation were incomparable to that of the ancient teleportation array in the Shangyuan Qingjing Palace.</p><p>He silently circulated his cultivation technique, gradually recovering. His breathing evened out.</p><p>Qin Sang looked down and saw that the pillar he was holding was the very one left behind by Senior Qingzhu years ago.  Seeing the two incomplete killing talismans on it, Qin Sang was momentarily stunned.</p><p>Back then, Senior Qingzhu was still alive, yet by a twist of fate, they had missed each other. When they finally met, it was followed by a permanent farewell.</p><p>Qin Sang gently rubbed the Qianjun Ring on his finger.  Senior Qingzhu's remains were inside.</p><p>In Youming Valley, Qin Sang had discovered Senior Qingzhu’s passing beneath a peach tree. He followed Senior Qingzhu’s last wishes, crafting an ice coffin and bringing the body back to the place described in Senior Qingzhu’s death poem—Senior Qingzhu's hometown.</p><p>This place was not within a cultivation sect; like Xiaohua Mountain, it was on the edge of the Yun Cang Great Marsh.</p><p>After the burial, Qin Sang carefully set up protective restrictions in Youming Valley to protect the peach tree from the erosion of the Nether Qi. He only wished that the peach tree would never wither.</p><p>There was also Senior Qingzhu’s death poem left on the cliff face—a top-tier sword manual, embodying Senior Qingzhu’s lifelong understanding of the sword and the art of killing. For Qin Sang, who practiced the same cultivation technique as Qingzhu, it was invaluable!</p><p>Qin Sang, filled with gratitude, paid his respects to Qingzhu. Then he carefully memorized the sword manual, copied it onto a jade slip, and took the fragment of the killing sword, leaving the inscription on the cliff untouched.  This was Senior Qingzhu’s final mark on the world. But he would carry on Senior Qingzhu’s legacy.</p><p>Thinking of this, Qin Sang's heart stirred, and a fragment of the killing sword appeared in his palm. Because the fragment bore a complete "kill" character, Qin Sang called it the Killing Sword.</p><p>Looking down at the character “kill”, Qin Sang’s gaze sharpened. Although the sword was damaged, he could still sense a strange, compelling aura emanating from the character, affecting his mind.  The intact Killing Sword must have been an unimaginable treasure to the world's cultivators!</p><p>When Qin Sang obtained the fragment, the gray qi of the sword spirit had shot into the fragment.  Remembering Senior Qingzhu’s words, Qin Sang hadn't stopped it.</p><p>Of course, Qin Sang hadn’t forgotten Senior Qingzhu's warning. Before the sword spirit awakened, he didn't know if it was good or evil, so he had to be prepared to prevent it from devouring him.</p><p>Unfortunately, after the sword spirit entered the fragment, Qin Sang regretted his decision.</p><p>…</p><p>During his Core Formation stage, Senior Qingzhu could barely wield the Killing Sword fragment; it was this treasure that allowed him to severely injure Leng Yuntian after being discovered by Leng Qian.  But after the sword spirit merged, Qin Sang found a new layer of stagnation when attempting to activate the fragment. It was undoubtedly related to the dormant sword spirit.  He wasn't sure if the sword spirit was resisting subconsciously or if the power of the Killing Sword was being used to nourish the spirit.</p><p>Trying to force the sword spirit out became difficult. Weighing the pros and cons, Qin Sang ultimately decided to leave it be, since he wasn't lacking in trump cards.  The sword spirit would recover faster within the Killing Sword fragment than it would inside him; the sooner it awakened, the sooner it could help him find the other fragments and the complete cultivation technique.</p><p>Now, the Killing Sword fragment was being nurtured within his dantian.</p><p>Qin Sang was very curious about the origin of the Killing Sword. The sword had shattered, and the "Chapter on Cultivating the Sword Spirit" was also torn apart; its fragments were hidden in the same place. Only cultivators who had mastered the technique could wield the fragments, indicating a close relationship between the two.</p><p>What would it be like when he obtained the complete cultivation technique and restored the Killing Sword to its former glory?</p><p>"Ziwei Palace… Qisha Hall…"</p><p>These two hidden realms flashed through Qin Sang's mind.  Qin Sang suspected that if Qisha Hall was once a peerless immortal sect, the "Chapter on Cultivating the Sword Spirit" was likely the sect's most treasured cultivation technique.</p><p>The Heavenly Tower, Yitian Peak, and the lingering sword intent all served as undeniable proof.  Ziwei Palace is also inextricably linked to them.  He obtained his first cultivation technique and the sword spirit within Ziwei Palace.</p><p>Qin Sang suspects these two realms are not the only fragments; others might exist scattered across different cultivation worlds.  If these worlds are all surrounded by endless storms, finding them will be incredibly difficult.</p><p>The two locations are connected by a teleportation array. After he forms his Nascent Soul, he must thoroughly explore and search for clues.</p><p>Among them, the most captivating is undoubtedly the illusory palace within the Qisha Hall's celestial restriction. Unlike the chaotic and desolate Qisha Hall, the palace appears complete, ethereal, and breathtaking.  Senior Qingzhu, simply by searching along the jade corridor, found a top-tier, now-extinct small teleportation talisman.</p><p>One can only imagine the treasures hidden within those palaces!  He is the only cultivator who knows how to enter the celestial restriction, but the jade corridor doesn't directly lead to the palace; further exploration is needed.</p><p>After burying Senior Qingzhu’s remains, Qin Sang returned to the celestial restriction, found a hidden path left by the elder along the jade corridor, used talismans to clear the way, and discovered an ancient teleportation array within.</p><p>He had wanted to explore other paths within the restriction, but after the trials and the battles on Yitian Peak, time was of the essence.</p><p>The celestial restriction showed signs of instability.  Soon, Qisha Hall and Ziwei Palace will both close.  Leaving Ziwei Palace doesn't require the Beichen Star Yuan Array; during its closure, the outer celestial array will briefly pause, the vortex calming momentarily, providing the only chance for cultivators to escape.</p><p>Before leaving, he still has a few things to do.</p><p>"How are you doing?" Qin Sang used sound transmission to ask Bai.</p><p>He adjusted his state. He doesn't know what the situation in Xiaohan Domain has become, and extreme caution is necessary.  If the ancient demons summoned by the Zu Yuan are as terrifying as the Demon Lord suppressed beneath Yitian Peak, Xiaohan Domain and the Tianxing League might already be in ruins.</p><p>His only option is to obtain the Nine Illusory Sky Orchid, hide, cultivate, and escape back to the Canglang Sea when Ziwei Palace opens again. However, with the successive deaths of top experts from both the human and witch clans, the Canglang Sea is unlikely to remain peaceful.</p><p>Qin Sang took out the token given to him by the Four Saints Palace heir, lost in thought.  Nan Gui Xianzi mentioned that there were Nascent Soul cultivators among the Four Saints.  Since the Four Saints Palace is a Nascent Soul lineage, forging a connection with them isn't a bad thing.  When the opportunity arises, he will definitely pay them a visit; it might help him solve many of his questions. (Happy New Year everyone!)</p><p>(End of Chapter)</p><p>39314494...</p>
