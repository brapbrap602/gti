<h1>Chapter 646: Heaven's Eye Butterfly</h1><p>“Our next destination is Butterfly Valley,” Qin Sang said, consulting his map to confirm the direction.</p><p>Butterfly Valley wasn't too far from the poisonous swamp.  Traveling by sword, he could reach it in two days.</p><p>As its name suggested, Butterfly Valley was a beautiful valley teeming with butterflies.</p><p>Those who had visited Butterfly Valley described it with a single word: beautiful!</p><p>Thousands upon thousands of butterflies danced and swirled amidst the valley's vibrant flowers, a breathtaking spectacle that persisted through all four seasons.</p><p>These were ordinary butterflies, not spirit insects. The valley itself was also unremarkable, devoid of formations or spiritual herbs.</p><p>Initially, the cultivators who discovered Butterfly Valley suspected hidden treasures, believing they were the reason the butterflies congregated there and refused to leave.</p><p>They scoured the valley, turning it upside down, only to confirm its ordinariness.  The valley's unique topography did, however, result in slightly richer spiritual energy than surrounding areas, shielding it from cold winds and maintaining a perpetual spring-like climate.</p><p>It was said that a spirit insect called the Heaven's Eye Butterfly inhabited the valley.</p><p>Qin Sang's journey was driven by the prospect of finding this butterfly, but he remained uncertain about making it his symbiotic spirit insect.</p><p>The Wu Clan believed the Heaven's Eye Butterfly was the least suitable choice for a symbiotic spirit insect.  Information about the butterfly within the Spirit Controlling Sect was also incomplete, gleaned from a fragmented ancient scroll.</p><p>According to the Sect's records, the Heaven's Eye Butterfly was similar in size to an ordinary butterfly, with delicate wings and a graceful form. Its most striking feature was the exquisite pattern on its wings.</p><p>When illuminated, the wings shimmered with a faint sky-blue hue.  As the butterfly flitted about, the wings resembled waves cresting on an azure sea, occasionally flashing iridescent colors.</p><p>With wings spread, it appeared as if surrounded by a mesmerizing dance of waves and rainbows.</p><p>Additionally, eye-like patterns adorned its wings.</p><p>Hence the name, Heaven's Eye Butterfly.</p><p>These eye patterns weren't mere decorations.  After its third metamorphosis, they transformed into true "Heaven's Eyes," the source of the butterfly's unique abilities.</p><p>By its second metamorphosis, the Heaven's Eye Butterfly possessed the ability to camouflage and shapeshift.</p><p>If it disguised itself as an ordinary butterfly, it would be indistinguishable.  Once concealed, it was said to be able to evade even the spiritual sense of a Nascent Soul cultivator.</p><p>This potent survival ability, however, served only that purpose: survival.</p><p>Beyond this, the Heaven's Eye Butterfly possessed no other capabilities. It was as fragile as a common butterfly, vulnerable even to strong winds. Its lifespan was often short.</p><p>It relied on its acute sense of danger, along with its camouflage and shapeshifting abilities, to survive in the perilous wilderness.</p><p>If a cultivator chose the Heaven's Eye Butterfly as their symbiotic spirit insect, they would receive no assistance in combat until the butterfly underwent its third metamorphosis.</p><p>The butterfly's inherent fragility didn't drastically change even after the third metamorphosis, but the "Heaven's Eyes" on its wings would develop supernatural powers.</p><p>The nature of these powers remained vague in the Spirit Controlling Sect's records. One mentioned ability was the power to see through illusions and barriers.</p><p>The extent of this power was not specified.</p><p>It was certain that the Heaven's Eye Butterfly had the potential for at least a fourth metamorphosis. Records about this stage were even scarcer, containing only a single sentence: "Legend says the Heaven's Eye will continue to evolve."</p><p>This was the source of Qin Sang's hesitation.</p><p>He cultivated a symbiotic spirit insect for two reasons: to address the issue of the restrictive talisman fragments within his body, and to aid him in breaking through to the Nascent Soul realm.</p><p>Already possessing a spirit sword, he didn't prioritize the insect's combat prowess.</p><p>To do so would be putting the cart before the horse.</p><p>However, it couldn't be too weak.  If it offered no assistance, occupying the precious symbiotic spirit insect slot and requiring significant resources for cultivation, it would be a waste.</p><p>This was the dilemma with the Heaven's Eye Butterfly. It was physically fragile and couldn't assist in combat like the Twilight Cricket.  Qin Sang was also unsure of the potency of its powers, which wouldn't manifest until after its third metamorphosis.</p><p>If its abilities were comparable to ordinary eye-related spells, he would have no recourse but regret.</p><p>Like other insects on the Strange Insect List, the Heaven's Eye Butterfly was difficult to cultivate.  It required special feeding methods to accelerate its cultivation, demanding vast resources and considerable effort from Qin Sang.</p><p>After careful consideration, Qin Sang decided to include the Heaven's Eye Butterfly among his options.</p><p>Its presence on the Strange Insect List was a testament to its potential.</p><p>Those insects with detailed records possessed both high potential and challenging metamorphoses, resulting in powerful abilities. The Heaven's Eye Butterfly likely wouldn't be too different, making it a worthwhile gamble.</p><p>The ability to see through illusions was invaluable, especially in exploration.  Moreover, this might not be the extent of its powers.</p><p>If he found no better insect, Qin Sang would choose the Heaven's Eye Butterfly.</p><p>Provided he could catch one.</p><p>Two days later, Qin Sang arrived at the mountain range where Butterfly Valley was located.  Nearing the valley, he suddenly frowned, landing on a mountain peak and looking down at the insect basket at his waist.</p><p>A faint but sharp 'rustling' sound emanated from the basket.</p><p>The fat silkworm was gnawing at it again!</p><p>Qin Sang felt a headache coming on. For the past two days, the silkworm had alternated between eating and sleeping.  Whenever it awoke and found no food, it would gnaw at the basket, demanding sustenance.</p><p>The problem was it refused to eat anything but Redfire Gilded Gold!</p><p>Qin Sang had tried offering it spiritual pills, medicines, even poisons.  The silkworm remained indifferent, not even glancing at them, instead spitting at Qin Sang and rolling its eyes, as if insulted.</p><p>Had Qin Sang's eyesight not been so keen, he wouldn't have even noticed it had eyes.</p><p>He was even less inclined to make such a spirit insect his symbiotic companion.  It was impossible to cultivate.</p><p>The creature wasn't entirely stupid, however.  It knew that only Qin Sang possessed Redfire Gilded Gold.  It refused to leave, and even if Qin Sang threw it out, it would immediately crawl back.</p><p>After a single bite, it would contentedly go back to sleep.</p><p>But it hadn't acknowledged him as its master!</p><p>Besides the Spirit Controlling Sect's insect control techniques and the Wu Clan's symbiotic insect method, there existed a rare third way to control a spirit insect: voluntary submission.</p><p>It was said that when a spirit insect voluntarily submitted, not only would there be perfect harmony between the cultivator and the insect, but also unexpected benefits.</p><p>Such an opportunity was incredibly rare and unpredictable.</p><p>Spirit insects lacked complex intelligence, making their motives difficult for cultivators to discern.</p><p>Some had tried applying methods used to sway human hearts on spirit insects, staging fake assassination attempts and dramatically rescuing the insects to earn their gratitude.</p><p>These attempts proved futile.</p><p>Qin Sang patiently fed the silkworm for two days. Seeing that it only cared about eating and showed no gratitude, he decided he had had enough.  It was time for a lesson.</p><p>Although the creature's appetite wasn't large, it was relentless.</p><p>“Redfire Gilded Gold is precious. I only have one fruit left, which I need for my symbiotic spirit insect's metamorphosis. How can I let you, a gluttonous silkworm, devour it?”</p><p>Qin Sang snorted, retrieving his Ten Yama Banners.  He summoned a wisp of Netherworld Devil Fire, shaping it into a needle, and opened the insect basket.</p>
