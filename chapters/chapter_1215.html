<h1>Chapter 1207: Awakening</h1><p>He moved through the dark clouds.</p><p>He found that the clouds were all dangerous ancient prohibitions, possibly similar sealed places.</p><p>However, those seals and prohibitions were intact. If Qin Sang forcibly attacked, it would take a lot of time and energy, and might not be broken.  It would also risk triggering a counterattack and exposing himself.</p><p>Unless the spirit of the Killing Sword sensed a fragment, Qin Sang wouldn't act rashly.</p><p>Even so, traversing and searching in the boundless dark clouds was extremely difficult. He took many wrong turns, going back and forth, wandering around.</p><p>A whole day passed, and Qin Sang had only explored a nearby area.</p><p>The area wasn't large, but it consumed a lot of time. If it were just him, he would have been exhausted.</p><p>The Killing Sword's spirit showed no reaction.</p><p>Qin Sang took a short rest and continued.</p><p>Gradually, Qin Sang discerned some patterns.</p><p>The route he chose was roughly an arc, with the Sin God Palace at its center. He avoided getting close to the Palace, trying to explore as many places as possible. If he found nothing in the outer areas, he would then consider approaching the Palace.</p><p>Several days passed, and as time went on, Qin Sang and the Tianmu Butterfly became more skilled, and their exploration speed increased.</p><p>Qin Sang stopped, looking at the terrifying chaotic sea before him.</p><p>Ancient prohibitions intertwined with the dark clouds, leaving no gaps.</p><p>This kind of chaotic cloud sea wasn't unique in the Abyss of Sin.</p><p>It was certain that even Abyss cultivators would find it difficult to enter such a place. Standing there, he felt extremely dangerous. Qin Sang only dared to approach slightly, allowing the sword spirit to sense independently.</p><p>Reason told Qin Sang it was best not to go in, otherwise he wouldn't be safe, let alone retrieve any treasure. Thankfully, the Killing Sword's spirit didn't respond.</p><p>In these days, Qin Sang had explored most of the accessible areas, without finding any trace of others. After the Sin God Palace's tremors, only Yuan Ying masters dared to linger in the Abyss Ruins, and the Abyss of Sin was rife with war; no wonder it was so empty.</p><p>For several more days, there was no progress.</p><p>Qin Sang decided to thoroughly search the remaining areas, but he had a feeling, "The Abyss Ruins are unlikely to hold the Killing Sword fragment. I'll have to find a way to enter the Sin God Palace later…"</p><p>As this thought crossed his mind, his expression shifted, and he suddenly looked down at his waist, sensing something unusual in his spirit beast bag.</p><p>"The Fire Jade Centipede is hatching here, it's awakened…"</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>A crimson fire霞 flew out of the spirit beast bag.  Inside the red glow was a centipede that looked like it was carved from red jade—the Fire Jade Centipede, having broken free from its cocoon.</p><p>Each of its legs was surrounded by a ball of crimson flame, as if it were flying on fire. The surrounding fire霞 was formed by the dissipation of its flame power.</p><p>After its transformation, the Fire Jade Centipede was as long as Qin Sang's arm, clawing and snarling, a ferocious beast.</p><p>After a long sleep, it finally awakened, transforming and advancing. Qin Sang could feel the Fire Jade Centipede's intense excitement.</p><p>The Fire Jade Centipede danced around Qin Sang, seeming to take credit to its master. After the soul imprint had been planted, it fully accepted Qin Sang, and there was no barrier between them.</p><p>'Sizzle!'</p><p>Before Qin Sang could react, the Tianmu Butterfly perched on his shoulder became unhappy. Its wings flashed, and it shot out a bolt of lightning, easily breaking through the Fire Jade Centipede's fire霞, giving it a lesson.</p><p>Teaching it who was the number one spirit insect in its master's service!</p><p>With a whole level difference, the Fire Jade Centipede was no match for the Tianmu Butterfly.</p><p>Fortunately, the Tianmu Butterfly showed mercy.  The Fire Jade Centipede, in pain, was instantly reduced back to its original size, shrinking into a ball and trembling, its arrogance completely gone.</p><p>Sensing the Tianmu Butterfly's triumphant mood, Qin Sang chuckled helplessly; his butterfly had developed arrogance and a love of competition before even becoming fully sentient.</p><p>He couldn't bear to scold the Tianmu Butterfly, so he could only let the Fire Jade Centipede endure it.</p><p>Qin Sang sighed inwardly, looking at the Fire Jade Centipede with pity.</p><p>At this moment, he noticed that the Fire Jade Centipede's excitement was unnatural. "Huh? Did the Fire Jade Centipede sense something, being drawn to it and waking up? However, the Fire Jade Centipede had been sleeping for so long; it was about to wake up anyway. Since its transformation was successful, waking up early shouldn't have much of an impact…"</p><p>Qin Sang extended his hand, and the Fire Jade Centipede landed on his palm, only then daring to carefully unfold its body.  The emotions it transmitted were first grievance, then urgent urging of its master.</p><p>His gaze shifted, following the direction the Fire Jade Centipede was indicating.</p><p>He remembered the Fire Jade Centipede had helped him find the Crimson Fire Gold before, and had given great help later. Now, the Fire Jade Centipede was even more excited than then, which meant there really was some incredible treasure.</p><p>Qin Sang trusted Huo Yu Centipede's ability to find treasures, but the direction it indicated made him hesitate—it pointed towards the Sinful God Palace!</p><p>After a moment's hesitation, Qin Sang decided to take a look.</p><p>Waves of powerful fluctuations assaulted him, forcing Qin Sang to restrain his sword light and cautiously approach the Sinful God Palace.</p><p>The closer he got, the more impatient Huo Yu Centipede became. Suddenly, Qin Sang's expression changed, and he abruptly stopped. The Huo Yu Centipede raised its body, puzzled by its master's hesitation.</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze grew serious as he stared ahead.</p><p>The Sky Eye Butterfly could only see the storm caused by the Sinful God Palace's tremors, its vision obscured by chaos.  But Qin Sang keenly sensed unusual energy fluctuations within the turmoil.</p><p>"Someone's fighting ahead?"</p><p>Then, Qin Sang deployed his spiritual sense, carefully sensing and confirming his suspicion.</p><p>He glanced at the Huo Yu Centipede coiled in his hand. This treasure wasn't hidden in some secluded realm; it had been discovered, and the fight was likely caused by it.</p><p>This was deep within the Abyssal Ruins, undoubtedly a conflict between Yuan Ying cultivators of the Abyssal Abyss.</p><p>Qin Sang frowned, weighing the risks.</p><p>If he appeared to seize the treasure, he would become a target, attracting a combined attack. But as long as neither side consisted of mid-Yuan Ying cultivators, Qin Sang was confident he could shake them off and escape the Abyssal Ruins undetected via the Tian Shi Sect headquarters.</p><p>Even if the Abyssal Abyss sent people to block the entrance, it would be useless.</p><p>Having found the Bone Curse and searched most of the Abyssal Ruins, he was fairly certain the sword shard wasn't here. His purpose in coming to the Abyssal Abyss was almost fulfilled—it was time to leave.</p><p>Before leaving, however, there was an opportunity to cause havoc in the Abyssal Ruins and steal a treasure. Qin Sang decided to do it.</p><p>He was already an enemy to them, having killed one Abyssal Abyss Yuan Ying cultivator; he wasn't afraid of making a few more enemies.</p><p>Of course, this was contingent on the opponents' strength being within his capabilities.</p><p>Qin Sang became even more cautious.</p><p>He summoned the Twelve Demon Banners, concealing them within his sleeves, and slowly approached the source of the fluctuations.</p><p>After flying a distance, the Sky Eye Butterfly finally saw the battlefield in the distance.</p><p>But the sight before him was quite unexpected.</p><p>Qin Sang saw a familiar figure, half-human, half-snake—the Serpent King!</p><p>He knew the Serpent King and his associates would also come to the Abyssal Abyss seeking treasure, which is why he decided to leave early. But he never expected to encounter the Serpent King within the Abyssal Ruins. An ancient great demon's lair being inside the Abyssal Ruins—he couldn't fathom how they got in.</p><p>—</p><p>—</p><p>I can probably write a chapter by noon, but I won't have time for editing and proofreading. I'll post it later tonight after finishing these chapters.</p>
