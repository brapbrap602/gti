<h1>Chapter 1731: Past Events of Old Friends</h1><p>Qin Sang's divine sense perceived a cultivator flying towards him from afar. The aura was strong, belonging to a Nascent Soul Initial Stage expert. Judging by their trajectory, they were heading straight for him. Qin Sang glanced at the token in his hand, stood still, and gazed in the direction of the newcomer.  Soon, a blue rainbow pierced the sky, revealing a man in a long robe within the escaping light.</p><p>The man possessed a heroic appearance, looking to be around forty years old.  A pale blue sword light danced around him as he flew. The surrounding torrential rain was drawn towards the sword light, transforming into ripples of water that encircled him.  The man then employed some sort of divine ability to utilize these ripples, greatly increasing his speed. He was clearly a standout among his peers. In the perpetually raining Rain Desolate Lands, the man had mastered the use of his environment.</p><p>Qin Sang remained motionless, and the man was completely unaware of his presence until he was almost upon him.  Suddenly seeing a figure standing on the sea ahead, the man's heart skipped a beat, and a wary look flashed across his eyes. He stopped before reaching Qin Sang.</p><p>The man kept his spiritual sword unsheathed, yet his manners were impeccable. He cupped his hands and asked, "This humble one is Zhuo Yunshui, a Dharma Protector of the Four Saints Palace.  Was it fellow Daoist who activated the Saint Token?"</p><p>As he spoke, he noticed the token in Qin Sang's right hand and his expression softened. The Saint Token held extraordinary significance within the Four Saints Palace. Only the most honored guests, or those who had aided the Four Saints Palace in times of crisis, were bestowed with such a token.  Only a select few within the Palace had the authority to issue them.  Since the Four Saints established their lineage, only a few dozen Saint Tokens were estimated to have been given out. During the Four Saints Palace's decline, when they secluded themselves from the world, perhaps not a single one had been issued for centuries. The fact that this person held a Saint Token meant they were at least not an enemy.</p><p>Zhuo Yunshui's mind raced as he discreetly examined Qin Sang, becoming increasingly puzzled and astonished.  He was generally aware of the identities of those who had received Saint Tokens in recent years, but this person was entirely unfamiliar.  Despite standing right before him, this individual seemed nonexistent to his divine sense. Had he not seen him with his own eyes, he would have found it hard to believe another person was nearby.  Such a situation could only mean that the other party's cultivation far surpassed his own! Could this be a reclusive master from some hidden sect?</p><p>“Is Dharma Protector Zhuo referring to this token?” Qin Sang raised the token in his hand.  Judging by the man’s tone, the Saint Token seemed to be quite special within the Four Saints Palace. He recalled the circumstances surrounding its bestowal.  This token was likely not intended for him; the Four Saints Palace had truly sought to befriend Senior Qingzhu.  It was a pity they were unaware that Senior Qingzhu had succumbed to his injuries… Remembering his deceased friend, Qin Sang couldn’t help but sigh.  If given the opportunity, he longed to return to that valley and pay his respects to Senior Qingzhu.</p><p>“Qin Mou once fought alongside Fellow Daoist Bao Zhengnan at the Seven Kills Palace. This token was gifted to me by Fellow Daoist Bao. He mentioned that if I were to visit the Four Saints Palace, I could activate this token in the northernmost reaches of the Rain Desolate Lands." Qin Sang explained.</p><p>"So Fellow Daoist Qin is an old friend of the Palace Lord! My apologies! My deepest apologies!" Zhuo Yunshui bowed again, but his expression clearly showed that he had no recollection of Qin Sang.  Bao Zhengnan had become the Palace Lord of the Four Saints Palace! Qin Sang's expression shifted slightly, though he wasn't surprised. Zhuo Yunshui continued, "Fellow Daoist Qin's visit warrants a personal welcome from the Palace Lord.  Unfortunately, the Palace Lord is currently overseeing Heavenly Fortune Island and is not at the Palace. This humble one is responsible for guarding this area, and upon sensing the Saint Token's fluctuations, I took the liberty of coming to greet you. I hope Fellow Daoist Qin will forgive any impropriety."</p><p>With that, Zhuo Yunshui refrained from further questions.  He gestured to the side and personally escorted Qin Sang to the Four Saints Palace. Before departing, he had already informed the Palace.  Each Saint Token possessed a unique marker, and the Palace Lord, far away on Heavenly Fortune Island, was likely already aware of the visitor's identity. The Palace Elders would surely make arrangements.</p><p>Zhuo Yunshui observed Qin Sang, his bewilderment deepening.  It was no secret in the Boundless Sea that the Palace Lord had been stationed on Heavenly Fortune Island for many years.  If this person wished to visit the Palace Lord, why not go to Heavenly Fortune Island directly, instead of coming all the way here? Could this truly be a reclusive cultivator, detached from worldly affairs, dedicated solely to cultivation?</p><p>Qin Sang also gleaned some information from Zhuo Yunshui's words.  It seemed that Heavenly Fortune Island was back under the Four Saints Palace's control. The situation in the Boundless Sea was drastically different from before.  He wondered how the conflict between righteous and demonic cultivators had concluded. He nodded and followed behind Zhuo Yunshui.</p><p>Zhuo Yunshui, intending to probe Qin Sang's strength, held nothing back, fully utilizing his sword and pushing his escape technique to its limits.  His escaping light flashed like lightning. Even when he himself began to tire, he was astonished to discover that Qin Sang remained calmly behind him, maintaining a constant distance of three zhang – not an inch more, not an inch less.  Qin Sang's breathing was even, only his robes fluttering in the wind.</p><p>Zhuo Yunshui was utterly shocked and dared not entertain any further probing thoughts.  He led Qin Sang northeastward. As they neared the Four Saints Palace, two figures could be seen flying towards them from afar.</p><p>“Greetings, Elder Wu, Elder Xiao.”  Zhuo Yunshui stopped and bowed, explaining Qin Sang's arrival via divine sense transmission.</p><p>The two elders landed before Qin Sang and cupped their hands. “The Palace Lord is already aware of Fellow Daoist Qin’s arrival and is overjoyed. He will return to the Palace tomorrow and has instructed us to welcome Fellow Daoist Qin with the utmost respect, ensuring no breach of etiquette.”</p><p>Like Zhuo Yunshui, they were filled with questions.  They had not participated in the demon-slaying battle at Mount Yitian and did not recognize Qin Sang.</p><p>"It's kind of Fellow Daoist Bao to remember Qin Mou," Qin Sang said with a faint smile, waving his hand dismissively. "There's no need for such a grand welcome. Qin Mou is simply here to visit an old friend."</p><p>As they spoke, Qin Sang continued forward with the two elders. Soon, large shadows appeared behind the curtain of rain.  The shadows hovered above the sea surface, and through the rain, one could discern that they were clusters of magnificent palaces. This was undoubtedly the legendary Four Saints Palace.</p><p>The Four Saints Palace was a unique cultivation ground meticulously crafted by the Four Saints.  When sealed off from the world, activating the corresponding spirit formations would conceal it within the storm belt, shielding it from worldly disturbances. When it reemerged, it would manifest before the world as a sacred ground. Now, the Four Saints Palace openly revealed itself, making no attempt at concealment, demonstrating its absolute confidence that no other force could threaten its standing. The profound foundation of the Four Saints Palace was also evident in the cultivation of the two elders, both of whom were at the Nascent Soul Middle Stage.</p><p>Looking down from above, one could see exquisite and elegant palaces, with almost no vegetation between them.  Only at the edges were there a few patches of green, likely medicinal fields.  It was a stark contrast to other immortal abodes nestled amidst deep mountains and dense forests, hidden within clouds and mist. The Four Saints Palace resembled a city more than a secluded retreat, its palaces arranged in an orderly fashion, strictly adhering to the eight trigrams, layered around the central area where the Palace Lord and Elders resided. The further out one went, the lower the status of the residents, with different functional areas extending outwards.</p><p>Qin Sang landed with the two elders. Rich spiritual energy washed over him.  Though not as potent as Deer Wilderness, it was still considered a superior cultivation ground within the Middle Continent. Moreover, the Four Saints Palace was larger than Deer Wilderness and capable of accommodating an entire sect of cultivators. However, upon arrival, Qin Sang noticed that there weren't many cultivators present. Upon inquiring, he learned that most of the Four Saints Palace disciples had relocated their caves to Four Saints Mountain on Heavenly Fortune Island, leaving only a small number to guard the Palace.</p><p>The two elders settled Qin Sang in a quiet chamber and ordered exquisite nectar and immortal fruits to be served. Qin Sang had many questions, but it wasn't appropriate to inquire with strangers, so he patiently awaited Bao Zhengnan’s return.</p><p>The following evening, as Qin Sang was meditating, he sensed the restriction being triggered. He rose and went to the door, where he saw five people standing outside: the two elders, Wu and Xiao, accompanied by two men and a woman.</p><p>The man and woman possessed familiar features.  They were indeed Bao Zhengnan and Bao Xi. Upon receiving the news, they immediately departed from Heavenly Fortune Island, activating the ancient teleportation formation to the Rain Desolate Lands, returning to the Palace in a single day.</p><p>Bao Zhengnan had changed significantly. Once a youthful figure, he now appeared to be a middle-aged man in his forties, no longer bearing the traces of his former youth.  As the esteemed Palace Lord, he exuded an air of authority and charisma that commanded respect.</p><p>Bao Xi remained as beautiful as ever, though with a touch of mature grace.  The other person was an unfamiliar young man in white, standing beside Bao Xi, to the left of Bao Zhengnan.  Both Elders Wu and Xiao treated him with considerable respect.</p><p>Upon seeing each other, both sides were momentarily stunned. Qin Sang was surprised by the trio’s cultivation levels.  When they parted ways, Bao Zhengnan and Bao Xi were both at the late Gold Core stage. Now, Bao Zhengnan had reached the Nascent Soul Late Stage, and Bao Xi had also reached the Nascent Soul Middle Stage.  The young man’s aura was only slightly weaker than Bao Zhengnan's.  He was also a great cultivator!  Despite the death and injury of two of their strongest members, the Four Saints Palace had not continued to decline.  Instead, after several centuries, so many peak experts had emerged!</p><p>Bao Zhengnan, Bao Xi, and the young man were equally astonished by Qin Sang.  Before arriving, they had been informed by the elders that Qin Sang's cultivation was likely comparable to their own.  Considering the peerless swordsmanship of their former senior, it wasn’t surprising that he had trained such a disciple. However, upon seeing him in person, the three found Qin Sang's aura to be remarkably obscure, unable to discern his true level. They assumed that Qin Sang had achieved profound mastery within the Nascent Soul Late Stage, unable to imagine that he had already reached Deity Transformation.</p><p>Bao Zhengnan was the first to recover, cupping his hands and sighing, "Fellow Daoist Qin, it's been nearly six hundred years since we parted ways at Mount Yitian, hasn't it?"</p><p>"Indeed," Qin Sang replied, also feeling a surge of emotion.  "Though centuries have passed, the events of that day remain vivid in my memory. If not for the selfless sacrifice of those seniors in slaying the demons, we would have long been bones in our graves."</p><p>Recalling the past brought them closer.  Exchanging smiles, Bao Zhengnan introduced Qin Sang, "This is my younger sister, whom Fellow Daoist Qin should remember. My sister has mentioned you many times, and finally, you have graced us with your presence.  This is my junior brother, Zhuo Ming, the current Grand Elder of the Four Saints Palace."</p><p>"Even as Palace Lord, my elder brother cannot break his habit of speaking carelessly. Please forgive him, Fellow Daoist Qin," Bao Xi playfully chided, her beautiful eyes studying Qin Sang's face before she covered her mouth and smiled. "Fellow Daoist Qin's decisive strike against the Ancient Demon, turning the tide of the battle, remains fresh in my memory.  Seeing you again today, Fellow Daoist Qin’s demeanor remains as impressive as ever."</p><p>…</p><p>After exchanging pleasantries, everyone was seated in the quiet chamber.  Elders Wu and Xiao excused themselves, while Zhuo Ming remained, silently observing their reunion.</p><p>"After so many years, the Four Saints Palace is brimming with talent and extraordinary individuals," Qin Sang remarked, looking at the three, his thoughts drifting to Qingzhu.  It was a shame that if there had been so many experts back then, the situation wouldn’t have escalated to such a degree. Qingzhu wouldn’t have died, and Bao Zhengnan’s two grandmasters wouldn’t have perished so early.  During their earlier conversation, Qin Sang had learned that shortly after leaving the Four Saints Palace, the elder had perished during his Heavenly Tribulation, reuniting with Fairy Nangui in the afterlife. Not long after, Patriarch Lingzhuzi of the Heavenly Dao Sect followed the same path.  The Demon Lord vanished without a trace after leaving the Seven Kills Palace, seemingly seeking a place to heal his wounds. However, with no news for nearly six hundred years, his injuries were likely no less severe than Lingzhuzi's.  Having sacrificed the Divine Light of the Taiyin Celestial Ghost, his chances of survival were slim.  Adding to that were the three Alliance Leaders of the Great Business Alliances and Old Demon Mu, who died on Mount Yitian.</p><p>The battle at Mount Yitian had severely weakened both the righteous and demonic factions. The Great Business Alliances had dissolved, and not only the human race but also the Witch race lost their Great Witch Priest, and the Demon race lost their Jiao King.  The Boundless Sea was in turmoil. Before his demise, Patriarch Lingzhuzi, in his capacity as the Patriarch of the Heavenly Dao Sect, stabilized the situation. Otherwise, with so few human experts remaining, a great upheaval might have ensued.</p><p>There was no need to delve into the details of how things had unfolded; the Four Saints Palace had emerged as the ultimate victor.</p><p>Bao Zhengnan guessed what Qin Sang was pondering.  Remembering his two grandmasters, a look of sorrow crossed his face, but his resolute spirit quickly returned. He said, "Speaking of which, we owe our present state to Fellow Daoist Qin."</p><p>‘Oh?’  Qin Sang was surprised. “How so?”</p><p>Bao Zhengnan’s expression turned serious. “Do you still remember the young woman you entrusted to my care?”</p><p>“Su Nu,” Qin Sang nodded.  He could never forget Su Nu.  Not only was she exceptionally talented, but after becoming a pawn of the three Alliance Leaders, she never gave up, constantly resisting. Her unwavering determination and decisiveness were beyond ordinary.  Before coming here, as Qin Sang reminisced about the past, he felt that among those old acquaintances, excluding the demon race, the unbound Su Nu had the greatest potential to achieve extraordinary things.</p><p>“Precisely!” Bao Zhengnan nodded, pausing before continuing, “The story begins long ago. Since our Four Saints ancestors established our lineage, their descendants have been unworthy, leading to our gradual decline.  However, the ancestors’ legacy was profound, and if not for an unexpected incident, we could have sustained ourselves for much longer. Though we wouldn’t have regained our former glory, we wouldn’t have had to withdraw from the world either.  The reason for our decline was that several grandmasters discovered a secret realm within the inner hall of the Seven Kills Palace. After analyzing it, they believed it contained a great inheritance. They gathered the Palace's experts to explore the secret realm.  Unexpectedly, they triggered an ancient restriction inside.  Not only did they fail to obtain any treasures, but fewer than half escaped, and all of them were injured. From then on, the Four Saints Palace fell into decline.”</p><p>Bao Zhengnan looked up at Qin Sang. “After the battle at Mount Yitian, with human experts falling one after another, and the demon and witch races watching with predatory eyes, our situation became dire. We had no choice but to gamble and continue exploring that secret realm. During the next opening of the Seven Kills Palace, while exploring the secret realm, Su Nu stepped forward.  She claimed that after being possessed by the Ancient Demon and subsequently awakening, though the Ancient Demon’s soul was extinguished, some peculiar power remained within her, granting her extraordinary divine abilities that we couldn’t comprehend.  She played a crucial role in the secret realm, helping us unlock it and obtain the inheritance within. My sister, my junior brother Lu, and I all benefited from it.  If not for that opportunity, we wouldn’t be where we are today.”</p><p>Qin Sang was also surprised to learn of this fortunate turn of events after rescuing Su Nu.</p><p>"Where is Su Nu now?" Qin Sang asked.  If Bao Zhengnan and the others could break through to the Nascent Soul Late Stage, as the key figure, Su Nu’s cultivation shouldn’t be any weaker than theirs, right?</p><p>Bao Zhengnan and Bao Xi exchanged glances, their expressions turning strange. “During the opening of the Seven Kills Palace, Su Nu was acting alone within the inner hall. Unexpectedly, the Seven Kills Palace underwent a transformation.  We were forced to flee hastily. At the last moment, we discovered Su Nu, for reasons unknown, atop Mount Yitian.  She wasn’t able to escape in time and her whereabouts are currently unknown.”</p><p>(End of Chapter)</p>
