<h1>Chapter 499: The Assault on Golden Core Formation</h1><p>Chapter 499: The Assault on Golden Core Formation</p><p>He resealed the cave.</p><p>Qin Sang swept his hand across his pouch and took out a jade box.</p><p>Opening the box revealed the Kanli Golden Core, its entire body a dazzling gold, bathing Qin Sang and the cave in golden light.  A tiny vortex crowned the Kanli Golden Core, within which black and white Qi swirled distinctly, resembling a dragon and tiger.</p><p>The pill manifested dragon and tiger energies, vibrant and lifelike.</p><p>However, compared to the Nine Phantasmal Heavenly Orchid beside it, the Kanli Golden Core seemed somewhat lackluster.</p><p>As if stimulated by the Kanli Golden Core, the Nine Phantasmal Heavenly Orchid swayed gently.  Various illusions instantly materialized above the orchid, flashing repeatedly; each illusion seemed real.</p><p>The Nine Phantasmal Heavenly Orchid displayed its great power.</p><p>At that moment, the Kanli Golden Core was noticeably suppressed, its glow dimming, and the dragon and tiger Qi slightly dissipating.</p><p>Unexpectedly, even spiritual herbs could clash.</p><p>Qin Sang clicked his tongue in wonder, sealed the Kanli Golden Core's aura with a wave of his hand, and the Nine Phantasmal Heavenly Orchid finally calmed down.</p><p>Holding the Kanli Golden Core,</p><p>Qin Sang sat in meditation for several more days, adjusting his condition to its peak and calming his mind before finally opening his mouth and swallowing the Kanli Golden Core.</p><p>The pill entered his stomach.</p><p>Soon, it dissolved within Qin Sang's body.  The pill's power surprisingly transformed into two streams of energy, intertwining before entering his meridians, then abruptly separating into distinct streams, each flowing into a different meridian.</p><p>These two streams of energy were completely different.</p><p>One was intensely hot Yang Qi.  As the Yang Qi flowed, Qin Sang's meridians felt as if seared by flames, causing intense pain.</p><p>The other was extremely cold Yin Qi.  Where the Yin Qi touched, Qin Sang felt as if plunged into an icehouse.</p><p>At this point, one half of Qin Sang's body was burning hot, his skin flushed red, while the other half was nearly frozen solid, the emanating chill causing a thin layer of ice to form on his body.</p><p>While these two streams of energy raged within Qin Sang, he faintly heard the roars of dragons and tigers echoing continuously in his ears.</p><p>Qin Sang was already aware of the unusual phenomena accompanying the Kanli Golden Core's consumption, so he wasn't panicked.</p><p>He guarded his inner self, unaffected by the dragon and tiger roars, constantly monitoring the movement of the energy streams within his body, actively guiding them towards his Qi Sea.</p><p>The two streams of energy advanced side by side, about to enter the Qi Sea.</p><p>Suddenly, Qin Sang flipped his hand, revealing several pills he had prepared. Quickly, he popped two healing pills into his mouth, repairing the damage the energy streams had inflicted on his meridians, before focusing all his attention on his Qi Sea.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The Qi Sea shook violently.</p><p>The two streams of energy met again in the Qi Sea.</p><p>At this moment, the spiritual energy in his Qi Sea was like boiling water, violently churning.</p><p>Moreover, the Qi Sea began to replicate the earlier changes in his meridians.</p><p>Ice and fire clashed!</p><p>Alternately scorching and freezing...</p><p>The sudden shifts between hot and cold made Qin Sang's Qi Sea increasingly unstable, and these changes became increasingly violent, seemingly never ceasing.</p><p>The impact of the Kanli Golden Core's energy on the Qi Sea was terrifying.  Without preparation, consuming this pill would likely only result in the forceful expulsion of the energy.</p><p>Otherwise, not only would Golden Core formation fail, but it could even backfire.</p><p>Fortunately, not all auxiliary spiritual objects for Golden Core formation cause such destructive power.</p><p>Different pills have vastly different potencies.</p><p>The Snow Spirit Lotus and Iris flower have much milder effects; only some ordinary healing pills are needed.</p><p>Qin Sang persevered for a while, but could no longer continue; his Qi Sea began to show signs of losing control.  Without hesitation, he swallowed another pill.</p><p>The pill transformed into a gentle stream of energy, swiftly entering the Qi Sea through his meridians.</p><p>The storm in the Qi Sea raged even more fiercely.  With the addition of this energy, the violent conflict finally eased somewhat, but this respite was short-lived, and soon it resumed its previous state.</p><p>Another pill was swallowed.</p><p>…</p><p>After consuming three pills, Qin Sang finally survived the most dangerous period.  His Qi Sea, though still not calm, was now barely under control.</p><p>Countless predecessors on Mount Shao Hua had consumed the Kanli Golden Core; detailed records existed for key stages.  Qin Sang sensed this and knew the situation had stabilized.</p><p>Then, he immediately calmed his mind and fully focused on his cultivation technique.</p><p>The *Yuan Shen Yang Jian Chapter* rapidly circulated.</p><p>One cycle after another was completed.</p><p>Qin Sang's dantian remained turbulent, refusing to settle, but as time passed, the storm gradually subsided.  Simultaneously, the spiritual energy within him seemed to undergo a subtle transformation.</p><p>Qin Sang silently cultivated the *Yuanshen Yangjian Zhang*, intently searching for a breakthrough.</p><p>Time flowed slowly.</p><p>The spiritual energy in the cave, which had fluctuated after Qin Sang ingested the pill, returned to calm.</p><p>A day and a night passed quickly.</p><p>On the second evening, Qin Sang suddenly awoke. His gaze was initially hazy as he looked at the jade pool and orchids before him, then he abruptly lowered his head, staring intently at his dantian.  A tone of disbelief filled his murmured words.</p><p>“This…is it over?”</p><p>His dantian was now completely calm, without any sign of disturbance, seemingly unchanged from before he took the Kanli Golden Pill.</p><p>But this was definitely not good news!</p><p>He had failed.</p><p>If the Golden Core formation had succeeded, the process might have taken some time. Failure, however, would be quickly apparent.</p><p>After a long while, Qin Sang accepted reality, a bitter taste on his lips. The Kanli Golden Pill's potency had been exhausted so quickly.</p><p>During this period, Qin Sang had exerted himself to the utmost, without the slightest distraction, yet he hadn't felt even a single so-called breakthrough opportunity.</p><p>As before, let alone forming a Golden Core, he hadn't gained any experience.</p><p>Many senior cultivators' accounts described their experiences after taking the Kanli Golden Pill.  Even if they failed to form a Golden Core, they still felt some changes.</p><p>Some even showed signs of Golden Core formation, but because of unstable mental states, they failed at the last moment, filled with regret.</p><p>That kind senior cultivator eventually succeeded in forming his Golden Core.  He left a warning for future generations to cultivate their minds before attempting Golden Core formation, lest they regret it later.</p><p>Qin Sang had no doubts about his mental fortitude, yet he hadn't experienced what the seniors described.</p><p>What breakthrough?</p><p>What signs?</p><p>There were none!</p><p>The spiritual energy in his dantian remained the same, showing no signs of condensing.</p><p>Perhaps there were subtle changes, but they were incredibly slight and fleeting, disappearing before he could sense them.</p><p>Of course, senior cultivators who could reach the False Core stage all possessed far greater talent than Qin Sang. Among those who left their experiences, none had the same five-element root constitution as him.</p><p>Talent, then?</p><p>Qin Sang felt a pang of frustration.  After some contemplation, he entered meditation again, resuming his cultivation and trying once more.</p><p>A month later.</p><p>Qin Sang left the cave again, returning to the small island for a short time. Finding no message from Yun Youzi, he returned to the cave.</p><p>Throughout this month, he had diligently cultivated, hoping for a breakthrough, but his efforts were met with disappointment; his cultivation remained unchanged.</p>
