<h1>Chapter 1319: Spiritual Treasure</h1><p>Chapter 1319: Spiritual Treasure</p><p>“Anything I independently comprehend in the future shouldn't be restricted, right?” Qin Sang asked.</p><p>Bing Han nodded. “Of course. I can’t impose too many restrictions on you, Daoist friend.  I trust you’ll have a sense of proportion. Our sect's collection includes not only ancient texts on refining, but also the lifelong insights of our ancestors. Each piece is incredibly precious and impossible to find elsewhere.  It should be sufficient compensation for your assistance.”</p><p>This was true. This was precisely what Qin Sang valued most.</p><p>With access to the Xu Ling sect's collection, his refining skills would undoubtedly advance by leaps and bounds.</p><p>However, Qin Sang didn't immediately agree. Bing Han's eager attitude made him suspicious.</p><p>“Daoist friend Bing Han, please be frank. What kind of difficulty have you encountered? While I wish to learn refining techniques, if it involves risking my life, it might not be worth it.”</p><p>Hearing this, Bing Han smiled and calmly replied, “That’s a reasonable concern, but you’re overthinking. I can guarantee that neither of us will face life-threatening danger. The greatest risk would be similar to your own experience – fire poison entering your body, damaging your vital energy, requiring several years of recuperation to cleanse it. If you find this acceptable, let’s make a sworn oath first, and I will reveal everything.”</p><p>Bing Han was even more cautious than Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang knew this matter must be extremely important, possibly concerning the Xu Ling sect’s very fate.</p><p>The cost of fire poison and damaged vital energy was acceptable.</p><p>Trading a few years of quiet cultivation for a trove of knowledge was a worthwhile deal.</p><p>He believed Bing Han wouldn’t lie about this; otherwise, the heart demon oath would be meaningless.  Ensuring there were no traps, Qin Sang made the heart demon oath as Bing Han requested.</p><p>After Qin Sang completed the oath, Bing Han's expression softened, becoming noticeably more amicable.  Finally, she explained, “I wish to commission both Daoist friends to refine a magic treasure for me!”</p><p>“Refine a magic treasure?”</p><p>Qin Sang was taken aback.</p><p>He had assumed it was some kind of crisis related to the unrest of the underground fire veins in the forbidden area, not this request.</p><p>This was completely unexpected.</p><p>“You lead the Xu Ling sect and possess unparalleled mastery of the Dao of Refinement. Even a top-grade magic treasure, given enough precious spiritual materials, could be refined independently, right?”</p><p>Bing Han turned towards the mountain pass, her gaze seemingly piercing the rocks, and said in a low voice, “A magic treasure with the potential to become a spiritual treasure!”</p><p>“A spiritual treasure!”</p><p>Shock flashed across Qin Sang’s eyes.</p><p>He had sought instruction from Bing Han in refining partly to prepare for refining the charred wood, to prevent inadvertently harming Yun Youzi's spirit.</p><p>Afterward, the Ebony Sword would have the potential to become a spiritual treasure.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Bing Han was directly refining a spiritual treasure!</p><p>This was the first time he’d heard of someone refining a spiritual treasure.</p><p>The Three Realms War had lasted for many years, and all Yuan Ying cultivators were involved.  Yet, no spiritual treasure had appeared. Even Ye Lao Mo didn’t possess one; the Blood Moon Wheel was merely a top-grade magic treasure.</p><p>Qin Sang now understood how rare spiritual treasures were, and how precious Yun Youzi's legacy was.</p><p>Qin Sang’s mind stirred. Regardless of whether he could help Bing Han refine the spiritual treasure, this experience would be invaluable for future refining of the charred wood.</p><p>He had to agree!</p><p>Even if Bing Han offered no reward, he would participate.</p><p>Bing Han shook her head slightly. “Daoist friend Qin, you misunderstand. It’s not about refining a spiritual treasure, but about one with the potential to become one, and which could serve as the sect’s legacy treasure!”</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang’s puzzled expression, Bing Han asked, “Daoist friend, have you ever considered why spiritual treasures are so rare in the cultivation world? Throughout history, countless cultivators have been exceptionally talented.  There are also long-standing prominent sects like the Shangyuan Qingjing Palace.  Surely, some should have been able to refine spiritual treasures? During this war, not a single one has appeared!”</p><p>This was precisely what Qin Sang found most perplexing.</p><p>Unless those cultivators worried about attracting unwanted attention and dared not reveal their spiritual treasures.  But if one possessed a spiritual treasure for protection, they wouldn't need to worry about being robbed.</p><p>A magic treasure transforming into a spiritual treasure was a kind of metamorphosis.  A spiritual treasure’s power couldn't possibly be inferior to the Eighteen Demon Banners.</p><p>Qin Sang's great fame was largely due to the Eighteen Demon Banners.  An ordinary Yuan Ying cultivator wielding a spiritual treasure could instantly become a top expert.</p><p>“Please enlighten me,” Qin Sang said solemnly.</p><p>“In this impoverished world, it's incredibly difficult for cultivators to break through to the Transformation God realm, let alone achieve spiritual treasures.  The greatest hurdle in creating a spiritual treasure is imbuing it with a wisp of spirituality. The intricacies are difficult to explain,”</p><p>Bing Han sighed.  “I only know that the magic treasures most likely to develop spirituality are those meticulously cultivated by cultivators throughout their lives as their own life treasures.”</p><p>Late-stage Nascent Soul cultivators, after years of refinement, might be able to elevate their soul-bound treasures to spiritual treasures.  The success rate, however, is said to be low. If a cultivator dies, their soul-bound spiritual treasure doesn't just lose power; its spirit, born from its owner's essence, also perishes with them, reverting to its previous level and becoming uninheritable."</p><p>"I see!"</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly understood.</p><p>His previous cultivation experience allowed him to guess this much.</p><p>Soul-bound treasures are unique, essentially intertwined with the cultivator's life force.  Cultivators prioritize refining these treasures, as it is easier compared to ordinary treasures, unless dealing with something exceptional like the Eighteen Demon Banners.</p><p>This advantage is also reflected when upgrading to spiritual treasures.</p><p>The downside is that upon the cultivator's death, the soul-bound treasure suffers a significant loss of power.</p><p>Unexpectedly, for soul-bound spiritual treasures, the loss is even crueler – their spirit vanishes entirely.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered for a long time, then asked, "Is this true only for low-grade soul-bound spiritual treasures, or does it apply to all of them?  Do those with exceptionally high spiritual energy, those on the verge of, or already possessing, a spirit, also share their master's fate and perish with them?"</p><p>This question stumped Bing Han.</p><p>After a moment's thought, she shook her head with a wry smile.  "Daoist Qin, I can't answer that. As far as I know, at the level of spiritual treasures and above, it's difficult to make distinctions, unlike artifacts and treasures which have grades such as low, middle, high, and supreme.  The level of a spiritual treasure's spirit, the quality of the materials used, and the refinement techniques all greatly impact its power. The interplay between spiritual treasures is also far more complex than with artifacts or treasures. As for spirits, they are only in legends; I know nothing of them."</p><p>"So spiritual treasures don't have grades. I was blinded by my assumptions,"</p><p>Qin Sang said apologetically.</p><p>It made sense upon reflection; this was apparent even with treasures.</p><p>Each of the Eighteen Demon Banners is only a low-grade treasure, yet when arranged as a formation, their combined power surpasses that of supreme-grade treasures.  The power of spiritual treasures is difficult to fathom; similar phenomena are certainly more common.</p><p>Qin Sang then thought of the soul of the Killing Sword.</p><p>He wondered about its origins, how its physical form was shattered, yet its spirit survived to this day.</p><p>Bing Han took several pills, recovering her True Essence as her aura stabilized.</p><p>Qin Sang continued to question her about spiritual treasures as they walked towards the mountaintop. Soon they reached the mountain pass at the summit, where he sensed an intensely hot energy.</p>
