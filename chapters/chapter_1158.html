<h1>Chapter 1150: The Consciousness of the Azure Phoenix</h1><p>Put yourself in their shoes for a moment.</p><p>How would you feel if you discovered that your child had been forcibly subdued by someone?</p><p>Qin Sang had never intended to make an enemy of the Thunder-Swallowing Falcon...</p><p>Upon returning, Qin Sang began preparing for his Nascent Soul breakthrough. Now, he had to consider his situation after achieving it.</p><p>No matter what he did, he had to account for the threat posed by Dongyang Bo.</p><p>Compared to Dongyang Bo, who had been entrenched in the Cold Domain for many years, Qin Sang only had Senior Sister Qingjun as an ally. However, Qingjun had already made it clear that she would not help him against Dongyang Bo.</p><p>The more allies he could gather, the more options he would have.</p><p>Especially someone like the Thunder-Swallowing Falcon, who remained aloof from worldly conflicts and had no ties to any factions. Establishing a good relationship through Fat Chicken would undoubtedly be beneficial.</p><p>Although he and Fat Chicken had clashed before, for demonic beasts, the Azure Phoenix's thunder energy could enhance their innate potential, making it far rarer and more valuable than something like the Blood Mulberry of the Netherworld.</p><p>Even if the Thunder-Swallowing Falcon were to act irrationally, Qin Sang was not necessarily afraid of her.</p><p>"Before you achieve human form, stay by my side as a guardian spirit beast. After you transform, I won't restrain you anymore. All I ask is that you do one thing for me. I haven't decided what it is yet, but it certainly won't exceed your capabilities. If you agree to these terms, I can consider sharing some of the Azure Phoenix's thunder energy with you."</p><p>After some thought, Qin Sang made his offer.</p><p>Fat Chicken was overjoyed upon hearing this. Without a moment's hesitation, fearing Qin Sang might change his mind, it immediately swore an oath, "This humble one greets Master! Please consider my earlier words as nothing more than flatulence. My mother would surely be grateful to you for granting me such a great opportunity!"</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't help but laugh and cry at the same time. He truly couldn't understand how the majestic Thunder-Swallowing Falcon had raised such a descendant.</p><p>This kid agreed so readily—did it have confidence in achieving human form within a hundred years?</p><p>"Are you sure your mother would thank me?"</p><p>Qin Sang chuckled, removing the mask from his face, his expression teasing. "It's been years, but you're still as gluttonous as ever, even selling yourself out. The nickname 'Fat Chicken' really does suit you..."</p><p>Fat Chicken's eyes bulged as if it had seen a ghost.</p><p>It would never forget that face.</p><p>It wasn't about the Blood Mulberry of the Netherworld—its mother had left it plenty of treasures.</p><p>What it cared about was the emotional trauma!</p><p>Back then, just after hatching, it had been beaten up and made to cry, even given that humiliating nickname.</p><p>After breaking through to the demon core stage, Fat Chicken had sneaked into human territories multiple times, hoping to track down that guy. It had vowed to strike him with lightning every day and give him a thousand nicknames to vent its hatred.</p><p>Over the years, it had never found the culprit and had assumed he was dead, even feeling a bit regretful.</p><p>"It's you!"</p><p>Fat Chicken gnashed its teeth.</p><p>"What, still not convinced?"</p><p>Qin Sang's voice turned stern. "If you're still holding onto a grudge from over a hundred years ago, I won't force you. Consider your oath null and void. Without me, even if you had the stone slab, you wouldn't be able to absorb the Azure Phoenix's thunder energy. Back then, I took the Blood Mulberry of the Netherworld from your cave, but now I'm letting you go. We're even."</p><p>"Was that really just 'taking'?"</p><p>Fat Chicken felt like crying.</p><p>Now it knew that its enemy wasn't dead and was even stronger than itself. Not only could it not take revenge, but it had also fallen into its enemy's hands, forced to acknowledge him as its master.</p><p>In the end, Fat Chicken decided to swallow its pride and accept its fate.</p><p>Qin Sang began circulating his cultivation technique.</p><p>Fat Chicken stayed by Qin Sang's side, absorbing the faint traces of Azure Phoenix thunder energy that emanated from him.</p><p>By the next morning,</p><p>Qin Sang stopped his cultivation. The Azure Phoenix's essence blood within him had finally been fully integrated into his Phoenix Wings.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>With a thought, the Phoenix Wings fluttered.</p><p>He reached out to touch them.</p><p>These were real wings, reshaped by the Azure Phoenix's essence blood.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't quite say whether the Phoenix Wings were a treasure or a divine ability.</p><p>As a human, the Azure Phoenix's essence blood within the wings couldn't be fully refined into his body, so they likely didn't count as part of his physical form. In the future, they would only be useful for Thunder Evasion techniques.</p><p>Still, that was more than enough.</p><p>After his Nascent Soul breakthrough, combining Thunder Evasion with Sword Evasion, Qin Sang estimated that his evasion techniques would at least match those of a mid-stage Nascent Soul expert. Even facing Dongyang Bo, he wouldn't need to worry.</p><p>He glanced at Fat Chicken, who was still asleep, unsure of how much benefit it had gained.</p><p>Standing up,</p><p>Qin Sang felt the immense power of his physical body.</p><p>His heart beat strongly, and his entire body brimmed with explosive energy. If the Demon King Qianji appeared before him now, he wouldn't hesitate to throw a punch!</p><p>"You're awake?"</p><p>Bai, who had been on guard all night, walked in from outside.</p><p>"Thank you for your concern, Brother Bai."</p><p>Qin Sang clasped his hands in gratitude.</p><p>Bai waved it off, eager. "Quick, summon the Heavenly Eye Butterfly for me to see!"</p><p>Qin Sang complied, summoning the Heavenly Eye Butterfly.</p><p>The butterfly was also asleep, its size having returned to its original form.</p><p>Qin Sang carefully held the Heavenly Eye Butterfly. Last night, it had brought him countless surprises.</p><p>"Capturing heavenly tribulation lightning! In all my memories, I've never heard of such a thing. It's truly heaven-defying! You must nurture her well. If she gains the ability to truly devour tribulation lightning, the threat of heavenly tribulations to you will be greatly reduced. This means you'll have more time and opportunities, making your chances of reaching the Great Ascension far greater than others!"</p><p>Bai was filled with envy and jealousy.</p><p>This was the first time Qin Sang had seen Bai so excited. He hadn't even had time to think that far ahead.</p><p>"Her advancement to the fourth transformation was pure luck. I still don't know how to help her progress further, so it's too early to talk about the future. As for me, in this era where Divine Transformation experts are extinct, Great Ascension is nothing but a distant dream."</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't let joy cloud his judgment.</p><p>Bai shook his head, unable to tear his eyes away from the Heavenly Eye Butterfly. Suddenly, he remembered something and looked up. "I feel like there's more to the stone slab than just the Azure Phoenix's true blood..."</p><p>"What do you mean, Brother Bai?"</p><p>"The Azure Phoenix's true blood has been sealed in the stone slab for such a long time, yet its power hasn't completely dissipated. Could there be another reason?"</p><p>Bai hinted.</p><p>Qin Sang was startled.</p><p>"Are you suggesting that the essence blood might contain remnants of the Azure Phoenix's consciousness?"</p><p>Qin Sang asked solemnly.</p><p>Bai nodded. "When you mentioned that the Azure Phoenix's phantom actively entered your body, I became concerned. You cultivate demonic beast techniques and meditate on the Azure Phoenix. If the Azure Phoenix's consciousness mistook you for a descendant and tried to use your body to reincarnate, such things have happened before. Since neither you nor the Heavenly Eye Butterfly have noticed anything unusual, perhaps I'm overthinking it. Maybe the Azure Phoenix's residual consciousness has been eroded by time, or perhaps this is simply the opportunity it left for its descendants... You're quite lucky!"</p><p>Qin Sang fell into deep thought.</p><p>The idea that the Azure Phoenix's consciousness had been sealed in the stone slab since ancient times and could reincarnate through a host was indeed terrifying.</p><p>But considering that Bai himself had survived from ancient times to the present, Qin Sang thought it wasn't entirely impossible.</p><p>What he didn't tell Bai was,</p><p>earlier, when he inspected his dantian, he noticed that the Yin-Yang Armor on his soul had somehow shattered, and the shadow of the Jade Buddha had appeared, radiating golden light.</p><p>When the power of the Azure Phoenix's essence blood surged through him, Qin Sang had been in excruciating pain, nearly exploding. He had been so focused on circulating his cultivation technique that he hadn't noticed when the anomaly occurred.</p><p>Fortunately, after a thorough inspection, Qin Sang found no other abnormalities in himself or the Heavenly Eye Butterfly.</p>
