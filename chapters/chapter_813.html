<h1>Chapter 805: The Star Spirit Net</h1><p>“It’s done!”</p><p>Qin Sang’s heart stirred. Quickly suppressing distracting thoughts, he focused on completing the hand seals.</p><p>The Azure Bird entered his body and vanished.</p><p>This was merely Qin Sang’s visualization, using the Azure Bird to draw stellar energy into his body.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang couldn’t see it, but a faint light surrounded his body – the energy of the celestial stars. He had successfully taken the first step.</p><p>With the stellar energy entering his body, he skipped the refining stage. The incantations drove the stellar energy throughout his body, a cool sensation spreading through him, his flesh and blood seeming to rejoice.</p><p>Just as Qin Sang was immersed in this pleasant sensation, a sudden change occurred in his Purple Mansion. A sinister and terrifying force invaded, directly attacking his primordial spirit.</p><p>“The Star煞 is here!”</p><p>Qin Sang’s heart sank as he focused on his primordial spirit.</p><p>He had great confidence in the jade Buddha, but he also worried about unforeseen circumstances.</p><p>This power was unique and unprecedented.</p><p>In the cultivation world, there were legends of extraterrestrial demons, said to be incredibly terrifying, capable of killing even top-tier cultivators. He wasn't sure if this power was related to them.</p><p>The Star煞 was the name given by the great demon who created the cultivation technique.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The Purple Mansion was filled with shifting winds and clouds. Qin Sang felt waves of icy chill, the Star煞 bringing great terror.</p><p>The Star煞 surged wildly toward his primordial spirit.</p><p>At the moment of contact, the Buddha light emanating from the jade Buddha didn’t even ripple. The Star煞 was like it had struck a wall, completely blocked by the jade Buddha.</p><p>After a prolonged assault, the Star煞 slowly dissipated.</p><p>As long as it didn’t invade his primordial spirit, expelling it would be much easier. The primordial spirit was, after all, the most vulnerable part of every cultivator.</p><p>Qin Sang had just breathed a sigh of relief when a tearing pain suddenly surged through his body, causing him to frown.</p><p>He discovered that when the celestial stellar energy began to temper his body, it wasn't so comfortable anymore. His flesh and blood felt like they were being repeatedly torn apart and reconstructed, the pain and pleasure alternating during the refinement process.</p><p>Qin Sang focused all his attention on running the cultivation technique, feeling the changes in his body.</p><p>When he awoke from his meditative state, he felt a sticky sensation and discovered that he was covered in a thin layer of sweat.</p><p>The tempering of his body by the stellar energy, while strengthening his physique, also expelled impurities. However, although Qin Sang had not practiced any body-refining techniques, he had gained some benefits during his past breakthroughs, so the effects weren’t very noticeable.</p><p>The advantages of a higher cultivation level were obvious; the speed of cultivation at the beginning would be much faster.</p><p>A flash of spiritual light emanated from Qin Sang as he wiped away the sweat, feeling refreshed. Looking at the scattered starlight around him, he thought that the cultivation technique didn’t cause much disturbance, so he could practice it on Mount Bogu, eliminating the need to travel.</p><p>He performed internal observation to check the state of his body.</p><p>Cultivating a demon race technique, and visualizing the Azure Bird, while the process had been smooth, he couldn't help but feel some apprehension, worried that problems might arise.</p><p>Qin Sang carefully examined his body, thankfully finding nothing amiss.</p><p>He continued his meditative cultivation, drawing on the power of the stars until the early morning, when the rising sun brought a feeling of warmth, prompting him to stop.</p><p>The night's hard work had yielded rich rewards, and Qin Sang was very satisfied.</p><p>It truly was a top-tier cultivation technique. Qin Sang could clearly feel his body transforming through the refinement of the celestial stellar energy, making achieving the level of the hooked-nosed man no longer a fantasy.</p><p>“After years of traveling, and several battles in the Seven Kills Hall, including two life-or-death struggles against two late-stage peak enemies, my understanding of the Killing Talisman has deepened. I don’t need to deliberately seek out battles for now. Since I still haven’t found any news of the Ten Divine Trees, I'll likely face a bottleneck in my cultivation soon.  Perhaps I should cultivate both techniques simultaneously. I’ll cultivate the ‘Celestial Demon Transformation’ at night, aiming to break through to the third level before the next opening of the Seven Kills Hall. With dual cultivation of body and techniques, possessing combat power comparable to a late-stage peak cultivator, I can pass the Sword Path…”</p><p>Qin Sang decided to take this path; the ‘Celestial Demon Transformation’ gave him the capital to explore a different route.</p><p>“However, breaking through the bottleneck won’t be easy. Stellar Energy Infusion…”</p><p>Qin Sang recalled the description of the technique.  Stellar Energy Infusion required a place with extremely abundant celestial stellar energy and spiritual energy. The best place was Finger Heaven Peak.</p><p>Going to Finger Heaven Peak was clearly impossible for now. He could only find a similar special place in the Canglang Sea.</p><p>“The bottleneck for the second layer of the technique…isn’t too high… Right!”</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly remembered something. He quickly searched his storage ring, retrieving a ball of thread.</p><p>This ball of thread seemed chaotic, but Qin Sang lightly shook it, and it unfolded into a large net floating in the air – the Star Spirit Net given to him by Old Madam Jing.</p><p>That star-catching net had helped him win first place at the Finger Heaven Peak by quickly gathering star essence stones; now, it would prove useful again!</p><p>“I can’t fully utilize the circulating celestial star power I’ve drawn in.  The wasted starlight is a shame.  This net will trap and reuse it, far more efficiently than drawing in fresh power, accelerating my cultivation.  Moreover, with the net’s help, I can gather enough celestial star power to complete the first star essence infusion and break through to the second stage of the technique…”</p><p>Qin Sang’s eyes lit up with each thought.</p><p>He never imagined a magical tool that had lain dormant in his Qianjun Ring for decades could play such an amazing role in his cultivation.</p><p>Of course, without the jade Buddha, it would all have been a pipe dream.</p><p>Other beasts who cultivate this technique exhaust themselves refining stellar煞 energy; they wouldn't think to reuse it. Only he dares to be so audacious.</p><p>“The bottleneck at the third stage requires many times more celestial star power than the second, exceeding the net’s limits.  But the technique offers another method: consuming three specific spirit herbs to strengthen the body.  These herbs are unheard of. I’ll have to inquire about them upon my return.  The fourth stage is even more demanding, requiring mastery of the Celestial Demon Dharma before breakthrough. There’s no shortcut; it’s probably no easier than forming a Nascent Soul. My current level is too low; it’s too abstract and I'm clueless…”</p><p>All day, Qin Sang consolidated his cultivation and explored his potential, deepening his understanding of the technique.</p><p>Late at night, he summoned the star-catching net, enveloping himself in it, and began to cultivate.</p><p>During his cultivation, starlight surrounded him.  The starlight, which previously dissipated, was now captured by the net and reabsorbed into his body.</p><p>This cycle repeated, and his cultivation speed was indeed much faster than the previous night!</p><p>Qin Sang opened his eyes, full of surprise. This technique is perfect for him, yet a pity it was created by a demon cultivator; he can only reap the body-refining benefits – it’s an incomplete method.</p><p>Otherwise, once he exhausts the *Yuan Shen Yang Jian Zhang*, he could switch to the *Tian Yao Lian Xing*.</p><p>Initially, Qin Sang was captivated; he remained on the island.</p><p>For ten consecutive days, he cultivated at night and filled gaps in his understanding during the day, completely grasping the essence of the technique before leaving the deserted island and returning to Tianxing Island.</p><p>He wanted to break through to the second stage as soon as possible to cultivate the Celestial Demon Transformation.</p><p>The Celestial Demon Transformation is the most important ability in the first three stages of the technique, providing exceptional combat power.</p><p>Qin Sang was still unsure if he could cultivate it as a human, but he was full of anticipation.</p>
