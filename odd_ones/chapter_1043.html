   “I’ll god d*mn burn down all your dreams!”
   <p class="calibre5">
    In the great hall of Black Star Palace, an emotional roar sounded as
            a white beam of light shone up. It transformed into a revived army
            player with the ID of [Under the Soaring Clouds]. Naturally, he came
            from China.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    The great hall had quite a few players coming and going, and hearing
            this loud exclamation, everyone turned to look at Under the Soaring
            Clouds. All they saw was him heaving hard with a look of resentment.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    To the side, one of the veterans asked with a tone as though he
            expected it, “What’s wrong, brother with big lungs? Why the anger?
            Who f*cked you?”
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    “I got squatted[1] by a bunch of foreigners, and they even ridiculed
            me. This is already the third time!” Under the Soaring Clouds was
            exasperated.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    “Sigh, it’s now Version 4.0, the World Server. There are players
            from all sorts of factions outside now, and it can’t be compared to
            back then when we were in the Shattered Star Ring. You have to watch
            out for your safety,” the veteran advised before shaking his head
            and leaving.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    Under the Soaring Clouds’ face was nasty to behold.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    He was a new player that only joined in Version 3.0, and he was more
            of a casual player, not interested in PK at all.
   </p>
   <div class="chapter-c">
    <div class="chapter-c">
    </div>
   </div>
   <p class="calibre5">
    In the last version, the World Server had not been opened yet, so as
            an army player, he was basically only meeting his own people
            whenever he went out, so he was rarely attacked by others. However,
            there was no security in the current version. He had done a couple
            of missions but was maliciously interfered with by players from
            other organizations.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    He struggled to get used to the huge gap between the two versions,
            so he felt that his gaming experience had drastically fallen.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    Looking around, he saw that players with foreign IDs were scattered
            around, basically newcomers who had only joined the army recently.
            Among them, a small group of players constantly scanned the coming
            and going army players, looking at him from time to time as well.
            This sort of performance was most likely from a ‘spy’ sent by a
            foreign guild.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    “Recently, there have been many squatting incidents, and this is
            probably the work of those spies. My whereabouts were revealed by
            them, which caused me to be squatted as well.” Under the Soaring
            Clouds felt that this was likely, and he gritted his teeth in
            indignation.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    He disliked the foreign players who had recently joined, and he was
            not the only one—many of the Chinese players had the same idea as
            him, as the previous versions were so much more comfortable to play
            in. Everyone belonged to the same country, but now, since there were
            more foreigners, they had to be aware of the lurking dangers in
            their external and internal environments, making many people sick
            and tired of playing.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    Under the Soaring Clouds belonged to the category of a new player,
            and he was unlike the veterans who had invested a lot of time into
            the army. Right now, he could not help but think about changing
            factions.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    “I really don’t want to encounter the mess of being squatted
            anymore. It really affects my mood.”
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    Just as he was about to act on his words, the communicators of every
            player in the room rang. The moving players all gave each other a
            strange look, collectively stopping as they lowered the heads to
            read the news.
   </p>
   <div class="chapter-c">
    <div class="chapter-c">
    </div>
   </div>
   <p class="calibre5">
    Under the Soaring Clouds also retrieved his communicator, and when
            he scanned the notification, he realized it was an internal
            announcement from the army, and there were three messages.

    Army Announcement 1: Newcomer Preferential Treatment Policy
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    Addressed to all soldiers of the army: Now is the period of the
            development in the Flickering World. Recently, we have recruited new
            warriors from the other Star Fields. In order to quickly integrate
            the newcomers into the army, we’re re-enabling the policy of
            supporting the newcomers. Existing members can take the newcomers to
            perform missions, and both parties will obtain additional benefits.
            The army will give certain subsidies, which include but are not
            limited to Enas, Contribution Points, Ammo, and free repair
            opportunities. The full list can be seen in the Appendix
            (Expand/Collapse). I hope everyone will actively help newcomers, no
            matter which Star Field they arrived from. As long as one has joined
            the Black Star Army, I hope we can all entrust each other with our
            backs in battle—Army Commander, Black Star.

   <p class="calibre5">
    _____________________
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    “It turned out to be this policy.” Under the Soaring Clouds had a
            shift in heart.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    In the previous version, the army recruited a bunch of Russian and
            Australian players in the Constellation Corridor. During that time,
            they also announced a similar policy, which was implemented for a
            period of time. After results were achieved, this welfare plan was
            temporarily frozen.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    The effect of this policy had been proven in the previous version.
            It would mobilize the enthusiasm of older players to bring in
            newcomers, and it also quickly narrowed the distance between them,
            encouraging the making of friends. This allowed the Russian and
            Australian players in the previous version to quickly blend into the
            army.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    Right now, the Russian and Australian players in the army were
            different from those new players who had only joined the army
            recently. They had blended in with the Chinese players for a longer
            period of time and got along relatively well with them. Han Xiao had
            thus proposed this plan again in order to quickly integrate the new
            players from various countries and to allow them to feel the warmth
            of the old players, eliminating any barriers caused by
            unfamiliarity.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    Under the Soaring Clouds was not surprised by this announcement… but
            he was a little upset. Now that many of the old players were being
            squatted, the army actually wanted them to even lead the newcomers.
   </p>
   <div class="chapter-c">
    <div class="chapter-c">
    </div>
   </div>
   <p class="calibre5">
    While the spies only accounted for a small portion of the
            population, he could not help but blame the entire new player group.
            Thus, in his eyes, this plan sounded like the leader still choosing
            to help the bully even after he had shown signs of being bullied.
            The more he thought of it, the angrier he got.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    “This is too much!”
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    Under the Soaring Clouds knew that the NPC could not be blamed, but
            he could not help sulking.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    As he scrolled down to the next messages, he suddenly jerked, and
            his eyes widened like saucers.

   <p class="calibre5">
    Recently, a large number of immortals have reported to the upper
            echelons that while they were performing their missions, they were
            ambushed and killed by immortals from other organizations. After a
            detailed investigation, we have found this to be true. We have
            compiled a list of organizations that are deliberately targeting our
            members. For details, please refer to [Appendix – List of
            Organizations] (Expand/Collapse). Although immortals do not fear
            death, their actions are regarded as a provocation to the Black Star
            Army. Thus, I am issuing a public warning to these organizations to
            restrain your immortal subordinates before I declare war—Army
            Commander, Black Star.

    Until these organizations restrain their subordinates and put an end

            counterattacks. I hereby inform all immortals of the army that they
            can engage in retaliatory attacks against the above organizations,
            restricted only to their immortals. It is not our style to be beaten
            and not fight back. In order to encourage this behavior, the army
            will subsidize additional supplies, which can be found in [Appendix
            – Reward List] (Expand/Collapse). Repeated kills are allowed, and to
            receive rewards, you will need to use the Phillip mini program to

    _____________________
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    An uproar sounded as Under the Soaring Clouds finished reading the
            other two notifications, and many players got excited.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    “Damn, what is this? The army actually moved!”
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    “The PKs between players actually caused such a change in the
            faction‽”
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    “Haha, those dumb bitches. Squatting on us? Do you think our
            identity as army members is given for free‽”
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    “This is the feeling of having a backer. It’s really good.”
   </p>
   <div class="chapter-c">
    <div class="chapter-c">
    </div>
   </div>
   <p class="calibre5">
    “Our Army Commander is truly domineering, tsk, warning the other
            factions immediately.”
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    The recent squatting incidents had left the army players outraged,
            but it was because they did not have any teams, they could only
            count on themselves, praying that they would not meet any of those
            malicious players from the other factions.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    But right now, the Black Star Army had directly issued a faction
            announcement, with very domineering wording indicating that they
            could retaliate against their enemies. This attitude made many of
            the army players extremely comfortable.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    Especially since killing players from other factions would now give
            them reward, everyone was immediately motivated.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    Han Xiao released three announcements with the intention of a
            full-scale blow. He first used the Black Star Army to suppress
            people and skipped through the chain of command to warn the other
            factions that their people were causing trouble, making them pull
            those troublemakers back.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    The second was the permission to counterattack. All players in the
            army could thus be mobilized, and players in the other factions
            could be hunted down. Not only could they vent their frustrations
            and enhance their sense of identity, this would also allow the older
            players to fight together with the newbies to build friendships.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    In addition, he even dragged the players from other countries into
            the water, tying everyone to the same ship. In this manner, it would
            be much more difficult for any foreign clubs to incite
            discrimination between countries.
   </p>
   <div class="chapter-c">
   </div>
   <p class="calibre5">
    They wanted to divide based on nationalities? Even their own
            countrymen would end up attacking them, so there was nothing to fuss
            about!
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    The manpower used by the clubs to incite trouble was limited, which
            was only considered annoying to the army players, but if all the
            army players turned around to hunt down the hostile players, the
            foreign club players would be overwhelmed and choose to change
            factions, which would in turn weaken the scale of players in the
            faction and would help expand their own leek farms.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    The third announcement served to specifically fish out players that
            liked to cause chaos, killing the chicken to warn the monkeys. This
            would reduce the number of players who engaged in trouble together,
            thus reducing the manpower available for the clubs as much as
            possible.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    Under the Soaring Clouds was pleasantly surprised. He turned his
            head, seeing those people he suspected of being spies now standing
            still, as though frozen stiff.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    Under the Soaring Clouds felt as though all his grievances had been
            vented. He felt extremely good and comfortable, and if there was a
            faction identity score, one would see his score have continuously
            rising.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    “Haha, this is the judgement from heaven. Who will Black Star
            forgive!”
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    Under the Soaring Clouds laughed out loud, feeling extremely
            comfortable.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    A perfectly normal casual player was actually rubbing his knuckles,
            as though he could not wait to form a team and cut down people.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    From today onward, Black Star will be my big brother. Whoever tries
            to mess with the army, I’ll show them who they’re messing with!
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    …
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    Once the three announcements were issued, a storm was set off among
            the players.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    The players were no strangers to this sort of mission. Was this not
            a faction war?
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    The army players felt like they had been brought to a carnival,
            where many of them did not even bother with the normal missions any
            longer, calling for their friends and rushing for the clearing list,
            exiting the base like locusts leaving empty fields.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    The Black Star Army was the first organization to organize a faction
            war mission. In the memory of the army players, some people in the
            previous version had switched over to Bloodshed Land, causing the
            army to issue a similar killing list, but it paled in comparison to
            the current operation.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    This was a large group consisting of more than a million people!
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    The players were more prone to chaos than NPCs. Missions could be
            skipped, but how could such an interesting event be passed up?
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    Whether it was an old player or a new player, their enthusiasm was
            stimulated!
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    In particular, the new players from the various countries who had
            joined recently were even more enthusiastic than the Chinese
            players. Because many of them had jumped from such factions, they
            were familiar with the formations of these organizations, and they
            had naturally rushed faster than anyone to fight with their own
            people. The veterans naturally took on a few of such ‘pathfinders’
            in their parties.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    The hostile factions listed by Han Xiao were those organizations
            that the clubs worked for. They came from different Star Fields and
            did not have a particularly strong background, let alone being in
            the Flickering World where Black Star reigned supreme.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    Thus, facing the warning of the Black Star Army, most of them were
            bewildered.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    What are you warning us about? We didn’t provoke you guys at all!
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    But after a short check, they discovered the truth and almost had a
            stroke.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    They obviously had no intention of targeting the Black Star Army,
            but some of the immortals under them had acted spontaneously and
            caused trouble, resulting in them being wronged.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    It was literally the scenario of sitting at home, but a pot
            descended from the sky to strike at their head!
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    Most of the organizations immediately responded to Black Star Army’s
            warning and hurriedly stated to Han Xiao that those were not their
            intentions. It was only some crazy subordinates who had acted
            without permission. They had no intention of becoming an enemy of
            the army, and their weak hearts could not withstand such a
            ‘surprise’.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    Internally, these organizations started to strictly restrict the
            movement of their immortals, ensuring that without their orders,
            they were not allowed to provoke anyone, lest they suffered from
            dire consequences. They also punished those troublemakers and
            instigators… Reflected in the player interface, those players
            experienced a decrease in Contribution Points and Favorability.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    However, there were a small portion of organizations with a rather
            unique way of thinking. Considering the special reputation Black
            Star Army had among the immortals, they came to a startling
            conclusion.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    Spies!
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    This group of troublemaking subordinates must have been spies sent
            over by the Black Star Army!
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    The Black Star Army must have plans to swallow us, so they purposely
            got the spies to create trouble. That way, they will have a just
            cause to attack us!
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    These smart alecks began to brew their own conspiracy theories and
            decided not to fall for the evil plot.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    There were even a handful of organizations whose thought process was
            more refined, thinking that these Immortals that caused trouble were
            neither their people nor the people of Black Star, but rather a
            third party.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    Their goal was to cause a conflict between them and the Black Star
            Army, thus acting as the fisherman that benefited in the fight
            between the sandpiper and clam!
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    Anyway, regardless of whether this was a truth or not, the
            organizations already believed it to be so.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    And for the Limitless Financial Group, which was the keenest on
            recruiting the players, it had turned into an excellent target.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    Hearing this, Sorokin was in a mess.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    There was no problem. I really had such a plan…
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    But I haven’t even started implementing it!
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    Could this be retribution?
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    Han Xiao’s announcements stirred up the situation and directly
            caused the entire player population in the World Server to turn into
            chaos.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    And the foreign clubs were immediately forced into a corner by Han
            Xiao’s triple attack.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    This is not right. Us players originally liked to PK, so why is it
            you as the NPC that reacted most strongly‽
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    We only attacked your Immortals troops, and you already made such a
            big hoo-ha. Do you even feel embarrassed‽
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    Their plan was hit hard right after it started, and they almost got
            destroyed because of it. In this situation, even if the plan could
            continue, it would be far from achieving their desired results.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    The executives of the clubs were also unable to do anything.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    If they fought a faction war, they would not be the ones suffering.
            Including all the affected factions, even if they could not beat the
            Black Star Army players, they would not lose too badly. They could
            even rally the ordinary players in their respective factions through
            this faction war.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    However, the factions they belonged to directly complied. Not only
            did they not allow a counterattack, they even restrained the players
            under their command.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    Since their superiors did not allow them to retaliate, the faction
            war could not take place. All they could do was withstand the
            enemy’s attacks.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    The Black Star Army had encouraged their players and even released
            faction rewards. Not only did their organizations not have rewards,
            but they even held them back. The contrast was just too jarring.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    They all knew that if they were bullied like this, the casual
            players in their faction would be disappointed, maybe even jumping
            over to the Black Star Army since they could not beat them.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    The benefits of staying in a strong faction were just too much!
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    However, it was not these clubs that had the worst. It was the
            casuals.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    Faced with such a situation, many of them were caught totally
            unawares.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    I just got out of bed, without even brushing my teeth, and you’re
            telling me that I’ve been marked by hundreds of thousands of
            players‽
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    What are you trying to do‽
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    …
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    Just as these players were tearing up in confusion and desperation,
            Hila, who was situated in the Emerald Star Cluster, suddenly
            received a special communication request.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    It came from the Arcane Church, from the Pope himself!
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    [1] Squatted is gaming slang where the PKers spawn camp the corpse.
