Chapter 655: The Ancient Corpse from the Heavens


A slender figure suddenly appeared outside the mountain gate.


Immediately afterward, a terrifying aura swept across, descending in an instant.


‘Boom!’


The already precarious main hall collapsed with a loud crash.


Dust and smoke billowed.


“No! Run!”


Du Xian was terrified, summoning his magical tool and fleeing in another direction.


A winged, blood-red centipede flew out from Du Xian's dantian, letting out a mournful cry towards him before turning to face the newcomer. This man was ruthless; seeing the unfavorable situation, he abandoned his natal insect蛊 to buy time.


Unfortunately, the disparity in strength was too great, and everything he did was destined to be futile.


The Blood Centipede was ferocious in appearance and carried a deadly poison, a single touch of which meant instant death.


Ordinary cultivators feared this potent venom and would avoid it at all costs.


But the Blood Centipede hadn’t flown far when a ghostly claw reached out to grab it.


The Blood Centipede hurriedly dodged, but the ghost claw was faster, easily seizing the centipede. It seemed unfazed by the venom, its body surging with corpse Qi, enveloping the centipede before squeezing tightly.


The Blood Centipede was, after all, just a venomous insect, its physical body not particularly strong.  Struck by the corpse Qi, it perished instantly.


‘Pfft!’


Du Xian coughed up blood, his body faltering slightly. Suddenly, he felt constricted, a sense of dread rising in his heart. He wanted to counterattack, but it was too late.


A sword light shattered his protective magical tool. The next moment, Qin Sang appeared beside Du Xian, his hand gripping the back of Du Xian’s neck, easily subduing him.


On the other side, the Flying Night Devil had eliminated the Blood Centipede.  The cultivator named Jiu Shan had just risen from his seat, utterly defenseless, when he was captured alive by the Flying Night Devil.


Qin Sang flashed back to the main hall, tossing Du Xian and Jiu Shan together. He waved his hand, releasing a surge of spiritual energy that cleared away the debris, revealing Cui Xuanzi's corpse.


"You ran fast."


Qin Sang snorted coldly.


After searching the soul of the Li Wu Palace disciple, Qin Sang learned that the Five Venom Sect had hidden a Thousand-Hand Spider Fruit tree in Black Wind Valley.  He had thoroughly searched the valley, inch by inch, that day, but hadn't found it.


It was because of the unique ancient restriction within Black Wind Valley. Only when the Thousand-Hand Spider Fruit ripened would its unique fragrance emanate, merging with the poisonous spring and revealing its location.


Somehow, the existence of the Thousand-Hand Spider Fruit had become known to a Golden Core cultivator of the Li Wu Palace.  It just so happened that his chief disciple, Du Xian, possessed a venomous natal insect蛊, and consuming the Thousand-Hand Spider Fruit offered the hope of initiating its third metamorphosis.


Du Xian had brought his men here not only to search for the ancient corpse but also to seize the Thousand-Hand Spider Fruit to aid his natal insect蛊’s transformation.


The Li Wu Palace's pursuit of Ya Gu had nothing to do with their search for the ancient corpse. It wasn’t because Qin Sang's identity had been exposed. Rather, Cui Xuanzi, to protect himself, had shifted the blame, falsely accusing him of stealing the Thousand-Hand Spider Fruit, which led to Ya Gu being targeted by the Li Wu Palace.


Had he captured Cui Xuanzi alive, Qin Sang would have shown him no mercy.


Unexpectedly, Cui Xuanzi, knowing his fate, had chosen to end his own life, a decision worthy of a枭雄.


“Hmm?”


Just as Qin Sang was about to place Cui Xuanzi's corpse into his corpse puppet bag, he sensed something unusual in his abdomen.  Channeling his true essence, he extracted the object from Cui Xuanzi's qi sea, revealing two Phantom-Tailed Scorpions.


“Twin Gu?”


Qin Sang was astonished, examining the two scorpions, one large and one small, in his hands.


They were indeed both Cui Xuanzi's blood-refined natal insect蛊, linked to his life force.  When Cui Xuanzi died, they died with him.


There were many legends about Twin Gu within the Wu tribes, but very little confirmed information had ever surfaced. Perhaps the Western Frontier was simply too remote.


One of the Phantom-Tailed Scorpions was only at the peak of its first transformation.


The other scorpion's state was very strange.  Its body was tightly curled, its surface covered in a thin membrane.  Its entire form, much like its tail, seemed to be becoming illusory.


“It’s undergoing metamorphosis, and the scorpion’s head is already illusory, indicating it's near completion. In a few hours, it will be finished, transforming into a third-stage scorpion! Cui Xuanzi fed it the Thousand-Hand Spider Fruit, using the other scorpion to deceive the Li Wu Palace and frame me for stealing it.  He used Ya Gu to divert their attention and buy time. Once the Phantom-Tailed Scorpion completed its transformation and its power surged, killing them would be child's play.  What a cunning plan!"


Qin Sang seethed, instantly piecing together Cui Xuanzi’s scheme.


The metamorphosis process varied for each spirit insect.


Some, like the Celestial Eye Butterfly and the Dusk Cicada, required years of preparation.


Others might transform in just a few months, or even days.


The Phantom-Tailed Scorpion's third transformation, its cocoon stage, required only half a month. Once refined into a natal insect蛊, with its master's assistance, the transformation could be accelerated further.


Cui Xuanzi had truly exhausted every resource for the Thousand-Hand Spider Fruit.


For a century, he had schemed tirelessly, exploiting the remaining prestige of the sect's Golden Core cultivators to intimidate Thunderclap Village and Hundred Flowers Palace. After Qin Sang appeared, he feigned subservience, leveraging Qin Sang's influence to repel the two factions and finally secure Black Wind Valley.


Who would have thought that fate would be so unpredictable? Just as he was about to succeed, news of the Thousand-Hand Spider Fruit, for reasons unknown, had leaked to the Li Wu Palace, who then invaded the sect to seize it.


Faced with such a formidable foe, Cui Xuanzi remained remarkably composed, maneuvering within the tight confines of the situation, painstakingly buying time.


Once his natal insect蛊's transformation was complete, Cui Xuanzi's chances of forming his Golden Core would greatly increase.  Then, he could simply leave the Western Frontier, assume a new identity, and eventually rise again.


He very nearly succeeded.


Unfortunately, he hadn’t anticipated Qin Sang possessing the Redfire Gold-Melting Flame, which allowed for incredibly swift insect capture, and his premature return to the Bear Mountain region.


Cui Xuanzi, knowing that he had betrayed Qin Sang and implicated Ya Gu, his crimes unforgivable, had chosen a swift and decisive end, sparing himself the torment of punishment.


Qin Sang had to admit, he had truly underestimated this man.


Reflecting on himself, he realized his mindset had shifted somewhat since forming his Golden Core.


It proved that even in the cultivation world, power didn’t represent everything.


Underestimating anyone, even a lowly Foundation Establishment cultivator, could lead to a disastrous downfall.  Lord Dongyang had learned this lesson well.


Qin Sang had also paid the price.


Qin Sang's expression was complex, his gaze hardening, his demeanor subtly changing.


He walked towards the three Li Wu Palace disciples. Without a word, and in full view of Du Xian, he began searching the souls of the other two.


The soul-searching technique was starkly displayed before Du Xian.


After the soul search, Jiu Shan and the other disciple’s souls were scattered, leaving them no chance of reincarnation.


Hearing the heart-wrenching screams of his fellow disciples, Du Xian's face was filled with terror, his spirit utterly broken.


"I ask, you answer."


Qin Sang stared into Du Xian's eyes, his voice icy and devoid of any warmth.  "What is the Seven Slaughter Hall? Where is it located?"


After the soul search, Qin Sang had witnessed a vision.


A towering pagoda, exuding an ancient and desolate aura, like a relic of a bygone era, stood tall, piercing the clouds.


A severed, corpse Qi-laden arm of an ancient corpse plummeted from the sky, but just as it was about to emerge from the sea of clouds, it vanished into thin air.


This scene was referred to by their master as the Descent of the Ancient Corpse.


Their master had gone to a place called the Seven Slaughter Hall. Upon his return, he had tasked them with finding the severed arm of an ancient corpse!
