<h1>Chapter 1930: The Third Thunder Altar</h1><p>Somewhere in the forests of the Twilightfall Mountains.</p><p>Several streaks of escaping light arrived from the west, circling briefly above before descending to the ground, revealing several figures in red robes.</p><p>“Junior Brother Tu’s aura seems to have vanished around here,” a seductive female voice emanated from the person in the middle.</p><p>Her hand, as radiant as jade, didn’t resemble the flesh and blood of a normal human.  Within her grasp, she held a blood-red jade token.</p><p>Sealed within the token was a wisp of grayish-white aura, about the thickness of a pinky finger.</p><p>At this moment, the jade token was covered in cracks, and the grayish-white aura was dissipating.</p><p>The woman and a red-robed person beside her stood in place, using the jade token to sense something.</p><p>The others dispersed spontaneously, swiftly searching the surrounding thousand-mile radius, returning one after another to report, “No traces of pursuit or combat.”</p><p>The woman hummed in response, “So, Junior Brother Tu was captured alive and brought here to be silenced. Spirit Eater’s cave and his Corrosive Miasma Eight Formations are completely destroyed.  It's unclear whether Junior Brother Tu encountered trouble after subduing Spirit Eater, or if Spirit Eater had some hidden, formidable means.”</p><p>“To encounter trouble dealing with a mere old poison wretch like Spirit Eater… Junior Brother Tu would be quite useless indeed!”</p><p>The red-robed person at her side let out a disdainful snort. “No matter how lacking Junior Brother Tu’s abilities, he was still taught by Master. Spirit Eater, at most, only possesses the ability to preserve his own life; he could never capture Junior Brother Tu alive! That Spirit Eater is a solitary character, never deliberately associating with powerful individuals. Perhaps it was another faction that took advantage of the chaos. Perhaps it was our enemy, intentionally targeting our Soulfall Abyss.”</p><p>“Another faction?”</p><p>The woman furrowed her brows in contemplation.</p><p>Throughout the Twilightfall Mountains, those surpassing Tu Yuan in strength and daring to offend Soulfall Abyss were few and far between.</p><p>Just then, a piercing sound of something breaking through the air suddenly came from the distance, and a red-robed cultivator shouted urgently,</p><p>“It’s bad! Something happened at the Azure Sand mine! All the Azure Sand has been excavated!”</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>The woman’s jade hand clenched, crushing the soul token. She coldly stated, “Spirit Eater might still be alive!”</p><p>The person beside her was rather calm. “If I were Spirit Eater, I would have already fled far away; finding him would be no easy task. Right now, completing the mission Master assigned before entering seclusion is paramount. Fortunately, Junior Brother Tu didn't know many secrets, and wouldn't be able to divulge much. However, we must be more cautious in our subsequent actions, lest we repeat the same mistake.”</p><p>Unwilling to give up, the group searched meticulously for a while longer, but they truly couldn’t find any clues and had no choice but to leave.</p><p>…</p><p>At this very moment.</p><p>Qin Sang was already on his way back.</p><p>He had previously interrogated Tu Yuan and learned some information about Soulfall Abyss.</p><p>The ancestor of Soulfall Abyss, also Tu Yuan's master, was known as Patriarch Dark Falcon, the only Void Refinement cultivator in Soulfall Abyss.</p><p>Qin Sang was very curious about this Patriarch Dark Falcon's cultivation level, wondering if it had reached Mid Void Refinement or even higher.</p><p>Void Refinement experts were elusive, and only a few vague rumors circulated in the outside world.</p><p>Unfortunately, Tu Yuan's status wasn't high enough.  In his eyes, his master’s cultivation was unfathomable.  His master was in constant seclusion in the depths of Soulfall Abyss, and he had never seen his master fight at full strength.</p><p>From this point, one could also infer that Cloud Heaven was very wary of this Patriarch Dark Falcon, with both sides maintaining a non-interference policy.</p><p>Subduing Spirit Eater was indeed an order issued by Patriarch Dark Falcon, but it was relayed through other senior disciples. Tu Yuan was merely the executor and didn't know the purpose of subduing Spirit Eater.</p><p>Spirit Eater himself was equally clueless.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't intend to delve deeper.  This trip could be considered a complete success. Not only did he find the main target, but he also brought the person back.</p><p>Spirit Eater followed Qin Sang, arriving at the Daoist temple located in the Fire Domain, and couldn't help but marvel inwardly.</p><p>He really wanted to know what the Soulfall Abyss and Cloud Heaven cultivators would think when they learned that a mysterious expert was hidden here.</p><p>“Master, you've returned.”</p><p>Gui Hou respectfully greeted Qin Sang, then looked at Spirit Eater with wary eyes.</p><p>“This is Fellow Daoist Spirit Eater. Help him arrange a cave dwelling. He will cultivate in the Daoist temple from now on.”  Qin Sang said, turning to look at Spirit Eater, “How long will it take to refine the Azure Sand?”</p><p>Azure Sand itself was a special spiritual material. After being refined by Spirit Eater’s poison cultivation, it could produce a potent poison, and it could also enhance the toxicity of other spiritual materials.</p><p>He would first have Spirit Eater try refining it. If direct refining met the requirements, there would be no need for further trouble.</p><p>He had completely emptied a mineral vein; the Azure Sand would definitely be enough.</p><p>“This junior hasn't touched Azure Sand for many years. After a brief adjustment, I will immediately begin refining.”  Spirit Eater, having witnessed Qin Sang's formidable strength, was completely convinced and addressed him as a junior.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded and flew towards his cave dwelling.</p><p>“Fellow Daoist Spirit Eater, I am Gui Hou. There are many vacant spots in the mountain. Feel free to choose a comfortable location, but it's best not to be too close to the mountaintop, so as not to disturb Master's cultivation. Please follow me.” Gui Hou extended a hand in invitation, flying towards the foot of the mountain.</p><p>“Thank you, Fellow Daoist Gui.”  Spirit Eater cupped his hands and followed.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't care how Gui Hou settled Spirit Eater. He returned to his cave dwelling and continued his closed-door cultivation, following his established plan, comprehending the Sword Formation, Sword Domain, and Azure Phoenix Manifestation.</p><p>Creating his own Sword Formation and comprehending the Sword Domain were both immense tests for Qin Sang.</p><p>Especially the Sword Domain, which shouldn’t be a realm explored by Void Refinement cultivators. Qin Sang, with the help of the *Purple Star Sword Canon* and the Sky Crossing Sword Light, had the opportunity to glimpse a sliver of its landscape.</p><p>Comparatively, comprehending the Azure Phoenix Manifestation was much easier, and his progress was the most significant.</p><p>After settling down in the Daoist temple, Spirit Eater remained in secluded cultivation, refining medicine until three months later, when he emerged for the first time and cautiously activated the cave dwelling's restrictions.</p><p>“Enter.”</p><p>A gap opened in the stone door.</p><p>Spirit Eater straightened his robes and entered the cave dwelling, taking out a jade bottle and presenting it to Qin Sang, “This is the Azure Powder this junior refined. Please take a look, Daoist Master.”</p><p>Inside the jade bottle was half a bottle of azure powder.</p><p>Azure Sand was the main ingredient, hence the name still contained ‘Azure.’</p><p>“This junior has always longed for Azure Sand, and over the years, I have also accumulated some spiritual materials, adding a portion of them into the Azure Powder…”</p><p>Spirit Eater carefully explained the medicinal properties to Qin Sang. Then he saw Qin Sang open the seal, pour out half a bottle of Azure Powder, sniff it lightly, and without any protection, directly swallow it.</p><p>This scene left Spirit Eater somewhat stunned.</p><p>Even he, priding himself on his profound poison cultivation, wouldn’t dare swallow the Azure Powder like this.</p><p>Qin Sang swallowed the Azure Powder and sat motionless as the Qi and blood within his body began to churn violently.</p><p>Losing the Poison Pearl, suppressing toxins was indeed much more troublesome. However, Qin Sang's cultivation was not what it used to be. He could use his powerful True Essence to suppress the toxins within his body.</p><p>Firstly, the toxicity of the Azure Powder wasn't sufficient. Secondly, the *Poison God Canon* Qin Sang obtained only contained the part before Void Refinement, and its effect on enhancing True Essence was minimal. However, using it solely for body refinement was still much faster than normal cultivation.</p><p>Due to his understanding of the Azure Phoenix Manifestation surpassing the progress of the cultivation method, Qin Sang's cultivation went very smoothly, without bottlenecks.</p><p>After a while, Qin Sang lightly exhaled a turbid breath and praised, “Not bad!”</p><p>The toxicity of the Azure Powder was enough to support his cultivation for a period of time.</p><p>Qin Sang estimated that the Azure Powder alone wouldn't be enough to cultivate the *Celestial Demon Transformation* to the peak of the fifth level. He instructed Spirit Eater not to slack off, and he would collect other spiritual materials in the future to help Spirit Eater enhance the toxicity of the Azure Powder.</p><p>Spirit Eater naturally agreed wholeheartedly and immediately excused himself to continue refining the Azure Sand.</p><p>In the following days, Qin Sang occasionally received Azure Powder from Spirit Eater, while his main body entered a new round of cultivation.</p><p>…</p><p>Fire Domain.</p><p>A certain magma river.</p><p>Three people were walking along the riverbed.</p><p>They stepped on the riverbed, walking within the magma, but their pace was swift, surpassing galloping horses, no slower than flying in the sky.</p><p>These three people all wore red cloaks. They were the same people Qin Sang had sensed when he first activated the copper pillar.</p><p>The leader among them was called Master Fei Luo.</p><p>Two hundred years had passed, and they were still in the Fire Domain, persevering in their search.</p><p>For some unknown reason, there were originally four of them, now reduced to three: Master Fei Luo, the seductive woman, and the tall, imposing figure.</p><p>As always, they silently traversed the magma.</p><p>“Wait!”</p><p>The seductive woman suddenly spoke.</p><p>Master Fei Luo, at the forefront, stopped and looked back. “Master Fei Luo, six hundred miles further ahead is the Abandoned Smoke Lake.  There are some cultivation families at Abandoned Smoke Lake, said to have close ties with the Six Harmonies Sect, one of the three sects of the Fire Domain.”</p><p>“Meaning, just ahead is the territory of the Six Harmonies Sect?”  The tall figure interjected.</p><p>“Yes,” the seductive woman nodded.</p><p>Two hundred years had passed, and the tall figure had become much more composed.  He pondered, “In these two hundred years, we’ve found three ruins, but none of them triggered the same reaction from the Flame Heart Jade, indicating that there's at least a fourth ruin hidden that we haven’t discovered.  These years, we've avoided the forces of the three sects of the Fire Domain as much as possible, but as the search area gradually shrinks, we can’t avoid them forever. Even if it's a dragon’s den or a tiger’s lair, we must venture in!”</p><p>The seductive woman looked at Master Fei Luo and said, “I'm not saying we should give up, otherwise, wouldn't these past two hundred years have been wasted? I'm worried that the ruin is controlled by the three sects of the Fire Domain. The three of us, though not easily detected, are outnumbered.  If we have to confront the three sects… should we first send a message back to the sect for reinforcements?”</p><p>Master Fei Luo remained silent while the two spoke.  Upon hearing their words, he neither agreed nor disagreed, simply saying, “Let’s go!”</p><p>The two exchanged glances and had no choice but to follow.</p><p>…</p><p>While Qin Sang's main body was diligently cultivating, his avatar, following Taiyi's notes, had found the second Thunder Altar that could be restored.</p><p>This Thunder Altar was hidden deep at the bottom of a lake.</p><p>According to Taiyi's description, Thunder Altars were mostly built on mountains, at high altitudes. Thunder Altars built at the bottom of lakes were rare.</p><p>This place might have originally been a mountaintop, later transformed by the passage of time, with high shores and deep valleys, buried by lake water and mud.</p><p>Precisely because of this, this Thunder Altar was well-preserved, even better than the one at the Thunderclap Sect.</p><p>With the experience from last time, Qin Sang became increasingly proficient, taking only two months to restore the Thunder Altar.</p><p>He didn't wipe away the mud on the surface of the Thunder Altar, merely concealing it with restrictions.</p><p>Sitting cross-legged on the Thunder Altar, Qin Sang channeled his True Essence, attempting to sense other Thunder Altars.</p><p>To his delight, this time it wasn’t like a stone sinking into the sea; there was a response, originating from the Thunderclap Sect's Thunder Altar.</p><p>There truly was a connection between the Thunder Altars, even if they were thousands of miles apart.</p><p>From their initial construction, these Thunder Altars were intended for constructing an altar formation.</p><p>However, when Qin Sang attempted to draw upon the power of the two Thunder Altars for his own use, he ultimately failed.</p><p>He still couldn't determine the location of the main altar.</p><p>“It seems I still need to restore a third Thunder Altar,” Qin Sang murmured, Taiyi's notes flashing through his mind.</p><p>This was already the fifth Thunder Altar they had searched, finally finding a usable one.</p><p>He hoped that among the remaining Thunder Altars, there were still some that could be restored.</p><p>‘Splash!’</p><p>Qin Sang broke through the water's surface.</p><p>Xiao Wu and Vermilion Bird were playing by the lakeside, while Luo Hou lay prone on the grass, adapting to his new body.</p><p>Only Taiyi was diligently guarding him.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang emerge, Vermilion Bird chirped and turned to run, only to be captured by Qin Sang from afar, forced to serve as a mount.</p><p>Priorities first.  The most important thing now was to find the main altar.  They flew on Vermilion Bird, hardly stopping along the way, searching one location after another.</p><p>They first headed northwest, arriving at the junction of the Twilightfall Mountains and the Fire Domain. According to the information Taiyi had gathered, this place was likely the edge of the Thunder Altar network.</p><p>Thus, they continued south along the border of the Twilightfall Mountains, finally arriving at the water system where Lake Li was located, continuing further south where there were no more Thunder Altars.</p><p>From this, Qin Sang deduced that the area where the Thunder Altars were located likely roughly corresponded to the mortal realm. He didn’t know if it was a coincidence or if there was another hidden meaning.</p><p>Unable to restore these Thunder Altars for the time being, Qin Sang could only record their locations one by one, continuing to search eastward.</p><p>“Ahead is the sixteenth one. If Thunder Altars truly span the entire mortal realm, these probably don’t even account for a quarter of the total number. What a grand scale! Merely for performing techniques, such elaborate efforts wouldn't be necessary. It seems the owner of the Thunder Altars truly wanted to establish a roaming court here…”</p><p>Qin Sang sighed inwardly, gently patting Vermilion Bird, concealing their aura, and descending towards a mountain ahead.</p><p>This mountain was majestic, standing out among its surroundings.</p><p>From the middle of the mountain upwards, the mountain's sides were perfectly vertical, too steep for monkeys to climb or birds to fly over.</p><p>A few ancient pine and cypress trees stubbornly grew on the cliffs, adding a touch of greenery.</p><p>They landed on the summit. Qin Sang released Vermilion Bird from its restraints, and it immediately reverted to its true form, muttering something inaudibly.</p><p>“My Lord, no one has touched my restrictions.”</p><p>The Thunder Altar was built in a hidden crevice.  Taiyi, after inspecting it, reported respectfully.</p><p>Qin Sang approached, examining the Thunder Altar before him.  His eyes gradually brightened.</p><p>This Thunder Altar appeared to be severely damaged, more so than the previous ones, yet Qin Sang could see that the altar’s main framework was still intact, holding great promise for restoration.</p><p>“This is it!”</p><p>Qin Sang immediately made his decision. “Taiyi, go take a look around.  See if there are any sects or factions nearby.”</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>Taiyi took his leave.</p><p>Vermilion Bird, not having received permission, was even more disgruntled. Unfortunately, it was no match for Qin Sang, so it could only hop around Xiao Wu, venting its grievances with grumbles.</p><p>It was dawn.</p><p>The morning mist hadn't yet dispersed, and the rising sun painted the eastern sky with fiery red clouds.</p><p>Qin Sang was busy by the Thunder Altar.</p><p>Xiao Wu sat at the edge of the cliff, his small hands pressing on the edges of the rocks, gazing out at the sunrise and the vast world, his white, tender legs dangling over the precipice.</p><p>Vermilion Bird was also immersed in the beautiful scenery, leaning against Xiao Wu, unusually quiet, quietly appreciating the view.</p><p>The sun fully emerged.</p><p>Vermilion Bird yawned, its head turning, its gaze sweeping across the forest below, then suddenly stopping.</p><p>It seemed to be attracted by something, tilting its head and watching for a while before spreading its wings, nudging Xiao Wu, and pointing down the mountain. “Look! Look!”</p>
