<h1>Extra Chapter 1: Seizing Treasures Amidst the Chaos at the Wuxiang Immortal Sect (Author:  Remaining Torch)</h1><p>(This chapter is fan-created by reader "Remaining Torch" and is unrelated to the main storyline.)</p><p>When a suspected ancient demon appeared, the Wuxiang Immortal Sect was thrown into utter chaos.</p><p>Yet, faced with this incredible opportunity, many cultivators confident in their cultivation and abilities chose to remain, observing the situation or taking advantage of the turmoil.</p><p>Fortunately, Hui Guang Saint and Qinghu Saint King, two long-absent Nascent Soul cultivators, appeared and intervened.  They joined forces with several renowned—or infamous—top-tier cultivators to suppress the demon. Using the Suspended Lake technique to restrain the demon's body, the Imperial Grant Mountain shone with brilliant light, and the situation was brought under control for a time.</p><p>In a treasure hall far from the battlefield,</p><p>a hidden girl occasionally glanced at Imperial Grant Mountain, monitoring the battle, while stealthily approaching the Jinxiang Hall, a hall located on a peak shaped like a sword to the east.</p><p>“If I remember correctly, it should be almost time…”</p><p>As she muttered,</p><p>a terrifying power erupted from Imperial Grant Mountain.  Waves of five-colored radiant light burst forth from a violently shaking fissure, spewing relentless flames. Two figures could be vaguely seen within the fissure; one appeared to be holding a struggling infant.</p><p>The girl's precognitive ability stems from the fact that Bai Zhi is a time traveler.</p><p>Initially, Bai Zhi believed she had simply transmigrated to a cultivation world. But as her cultivation grew and she journeyed through Zhongzhou seeking opportunities, names like the Eight Scenic Spots, Ganlu Zen Temple, Tianhao Tower, Bunian Mountain, Wandu Mountain, and Liu Zhou Hall… awakened a long-dormant memory.</p><p>Could it be that I’ve traveled to the world of “叩问仙道”?</p><p>Driven by this suspicion, Bai Zhi infiltrated the Southern Barbarian provinces, and indeed discovered the Gu God Cult and their earthly teachings of a so-called "Void Immortal Paradise." This discovery confirmed her suspicions.</p><p>Now, witnessing a cultivator using a fire shield to defend against the Qinghu Saint King's incarnation, and subsequently using the Nanming Lihuo to annihilate the incarnation with devastating ease, Bai Zhi had no doubt about her location.</p><p>However, as a mere mid-stage Nascent Soul cultivator, she was completely incapable of directly competing with those top-tier cultivators and major sects for Imperial Grant Mountain and the Five Phases Hall.</p><p>Since entering the Wuxiang Immortal Sect, Bai Zhi had remained in the outer regions, operating on the principle of “every little helps” and avoiding the most intense conflicts.</p><p>Thanks to her knowledge of the plot, although she was slightly behind schedule, she arrived safely at Lang… (Location name unclear)</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang fled into Jinxiang Hall to escape the demonic horde.  He faced a relentless pursuit from a group of demon kings who bombarded the sword formation's restrictions to force him to appear.</p><p>An ancient bronze mirror appeared in Bai Zhi's hand; the only flaw was a crack running across its surface, a constant reminder that this artifact that had accompanied her through her time travel was merely a damaged treasure.</p><p>Activating the mirror, Bai Zhi touched the reflection of herself.</p><p>Immediately, a figure materialized from the reflection, identical in appearance, aura, and cultivation level to the girl.</p><p>Looking at the dimmer bronze mirror, Bai Zhi sighed, “Using this damaged treasure to reflect a Nascent Soul… I wonder how many years it will take to restore its power.”</p><p>She then put away the mirror.</p><p>“Then according to the plan, one of us will escape first, to avoid being intercepted by the arriving Buddhist cultivators and forced to surrender the treasure; the other will infiltrate Jinxiang Hall to obtain the opportunity.”</p><p>“Absolutely get the 'Taiyuan Golden Gang Sword Scripture' mentioned in the story!”</p><p>“Of course, why else would I use the damaged treasure to create a reflection?”</p><p>The ‘two’ figures' conversation resembled a soliloquy in front of a mirror. During this brief exchange, the Nanming Lihuo reappeared in Jinxiang Hall, followed by a lightning-fast escape, shooting towards the northeast and disappearing into the sky in the blink of an eye.</p><p>The demons pursued relentlessly.</p><p>Bai Zhi seized this opportunity, summoning an ancient bronze sword, cutting a white arc through a weak point in Jinxiang Hall's restrictions, and under the astonished gaze of the onlookers, swiftly slipped inside.</p><p>“That person's crazy!  Aren't they afraid of the demon kings' retaliation?”</p><p>After successive attacks from the demons and the destruction caused by the Nanming Lihuo, Jinxiang Hall's sword array restrictions were on the verge of collapse.</p><p>However, the sword array, possibly created by a celestial hall, was remarkably sturdy. Even in its weakened state, forcing an entry would require considerable effort.</p><p>The moment was fleeting.</p><p>Bai Zhi knew that once Qin Sang escaped through the back way, the demon kings would surely return.  A silent, stealthy infiltration was impossible.</p><p>Continuous sword energy rained down on the weak points of the sword formation.</p><p>Riding her escaping light, Bai Zhi felt the gaze of some demons turning towards her. In a flash, she burst through the opened restriction into the Jinxiang Hall, shielding herself with her bronze sword.  Unwavering in speed, she weaved through the hall, searching for the secret chamber.</p><p>“Oh?  The restriction here is open…”</p><p>Realizing that the Jinxiang lineage had already reached the secret chamber, only a final layer of sword energy sealing it remained.  Bai Zhi followed the trail and, sure enough, arrived beneath a towering, blade-like rock peak. The restriction below was already opened, and before an inconspicuous cave, lay a sword whose cold gleam hadn't dimmed through countless years.</p><p>Bai Zhi, though without a lineage, had never expected to survive. She ignited her own blood essence.</p><p>Since it's a sword energy seal, I'll cut it with a sword!</p><p>Such a reckless approach was normally unacceptable, but time was short, leaving Bai Zhi no choice but to use this desperate measure.</p><p>The clash of two sword energies created a shockwave that ripped apart pavilions, halls, and houses.  Bai Zhi, now pale-faced, struck the sealing sword with her bronze sword.  A clang of metal echoed, and dozens of deep wounds opened across her body, sending her sprawling.</p><p>But this was the final seal, already weakened by the cultivators of the Yanyue Monastery.  If it were intact, even if Bai Zhi disregarded the consequences and burned her blood essence, draining her life force, she might not have been able to break it.</p><p>Above, the sound of demons violently breaking through the formation grew louder.</p><p>Stabilizing herself, she darted into the secret chamber's treasure vault.</p><p>Stone swords stood densely within the cave. Bai Zhi flew through, using her spiritual sense to quickly scan the area.  Each sword was a rare and invaluable sword technique, manual, formation, or secret method for cultivating one's sword intent.</p><p>“This… this is…? The Seven Mansion Division Sword Formation!?”</p><p>A massive stone tablet, etched with the Western Seven Mansions using sword energy, stood out among the swords.  Even a glance conveyed the fierce power of the White Tiger.</p><p>Below the tablet was a stone platform holding a jade sword of transmission.</p><p>Touching the jade sword with her spiritual sense, the words "Grand Beginning Golden Gang Sword Scripture" appeared.</p><p>Seeing her pursuers approach, Bai Zhi immediately pried loose the stone tablet containing the "Seven Mansion Division Sword Formation," along with the jade sword, placing them in her bag. Then, she quickly gathered as many of the surrounding stone swords as she could, clearing the entire cave.</p><p>Having done this, Bai Zhi turned to the demon kings charging into the cave, a triumphant smile on her face.</p><p>Then, the life in her eyes faded, and she turned to dust.</p><p>The frustrated demon kings' rage is left untold.</p><p>Elsewhere, another Bai Zhi, already far from the Wuxiang Immortal Sect, felt the aftereffects and sighed, as if it were commonplace:  “I’m dead again.  Time to find a secluded corner to cultivate, wait for the world to merge into the Great Thousand, and then aim for Divine Transformation.”</p><p>—</p><p>—</p><p>Thank you to the reader for writing such a wonderful extra chapter, and thank you to the administrator and the management team for holding such a great event.</p><p>Seeing the readers’ dedication and love for this book fills me with honor.
