<h1>Chapter 567: A Rapidly Changing Situation</h1><p>Huang Tian succeeded, and the leader of the Wuji Sect fell.</p><p>The eruption of the bloody, foul light resulted in heavy losses for the Tianxing Alliance, even the True One Daoist’s whisk was damaged.</p><p>To explain it would be tedious.</p><p>All these changes occurred in the blink of an eye.</p><p>Almost simultaneously, the devils from the Abyss of Sin attacked, appearing very close, ghostly figures emerged from the rolling demonic energy.</p><p>Both sides acted decisively.</p><p>Even though the unexpected situation with the Wuji Sect leader meant the plan to disable the Xiaohan cultivators’ magical artifacts failed, it didn't deter the Abyss of Sin from attacking.</p><p>Elder Ye roared, "Kill the Tianxing Alliance!"</p><p>The Abyss of Sin cultivators, without hesitation, abandoned Xiaohan, and charged toward the Tianxing Alliance cultivators.</p><p>Clearly, they knew the Xiaohan cultivators were still at full strength and capable of fighting back.</p><p>If they got entangled in a chaotic battle, it would be difficult to achieve good results.</p><p>Their time was limited; they couldn't wipe out both domains.</p><p>But the Tianxing Alliance cultivators' most powerful artifacts were severely damaged, their strength greatly reduced, and their formations were completely disrupted by Huang Tian, leaving them vulnerable.</p><p>The Abyss of Sin considered both Xiaohan and the Tianxing Alliance their great enemies.  By crippling the Tianxing Alliance, even if the two domains joined forces in the future, they wouldn't pose a threat, making their elaborate scheme worthwhile.</p><p>At Elder Ye's command, numerous magical artifact apparitions suddenly floated up within the Abyss of Sin's ranks.</p><p>These artifacts were mostly demonic weapons, banners and talismans, dark and filled with demonic energy, countless lost souls and ghostly figures.  The fairy array seemed to transform into a hellish ghost realm.</p><p>The Abyss of Sin had been planning this for a long time; these artifacts were fully charged, and as soon as they appeared, they unleashed their most ferocious attacks on the Tianxing Alliance cultivators.</p><p>Countless artifacts attacked in a wave, overwhelming the senses. The attacks merged with the demonic energy into a demonic tide, surging forth with profound darkness and evil.</p><p>Simultaneously, a six-armed demonic shadow rose from behind the Abyss of Sin cultivators.  The shadow's body was enormous, a hundred meters tall, towering over all.</p><p>Its eyes were like bronze bells, captivating and soul-snatching, its gaze extremely fierce.</p><p>The shadow’s height allowed it to look down upon the Northern Dipper Star array.  The shadow waved its six arms, roaring to the heavens. The demonic sound pierced the minds, causing dizziness and a surge of blood.</p><p>Neither True One Daoist nor the Red-haired Ancestor had ever seen this demonic shadow, nor understood its origins.</p><p>However, it was speculated that the Abyss of Sin must have relied on the shadow to withstand the array’s ethereal winds, and perhaps even the opening of the array passage was the shadow’s doing.</p><p>"What ancient demon has the Abyss of Sin summoned?"</p><p>Everyone was shocked.</p><p>At that moment, the demonic shadow glared, its six arms striking the star chart above.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The Northern Dipper Star shone brightly, rivaling the demonic shadow.</p><p>Four people had originally maintained the Northern Dipper Star array.  With Huang Tian's escape, only three remained, and the array already showed signs of instability.</p><p>Though the shadow's arms were repelled, the array inevitably stalled.</p><p>The Abyss of Sin's assault followed immediately!</p><p>True One Daoist's face changed drastically.</p><p>Nearly all the Yuan Ying cultivators who entered the Purple Micro Palace were the Tianxing Alliance's elite; if they died here, the Tianxing Alliance would be effectively destroyed.</p><p>Moreover, True One Daoist was at the forefront, the first to bear the brunt of the attack!</p><p>"Elder Ye, I swear vengeance!"</p><p>True One Daoist, his eyes bloodshot, let out a desperate cry, raising his whisk.</p><p>His whisk had only been grazed by the edge of the bloody, foul light, and was only slightly damaged.  It could be repaired with a little refinement, but he had no time.</p><p>He raised the whisk, facing the combined attack of the Abyss of Sin, looking incredibly fragile, like an ant trying to stop a chariot.</p><p>The whisk’s bristles spread, forming a huge net like a celestial maiden scattering flowers, surging upward to meet the Abyss of Sin cultivators.</p><p>Each strand shone with a strange light, sharp as swords.</p><p>At the ends of the strands, a strange phenomenon appeared – countless Five Elements divine swords, unleashing countless sword qi, like dancing dragons, pervasive and everywhere, forming a small world of flying swords, attempting to engulf the Abyss of Sin's attack.</p><p>Meanwhile, the whisk's handle gradually crumbled, until the whisk completely vanished.</p><p>True One Daoist used the self-destruction of his life-bound artifact to block the Abyss of Sin's attack.</p><p>This whisk was his life-bound artifact, a companion since his formation of the Golden Core. Now a peak mid-Yuan Ying cultivator, he was only one step away from the late Yuan Ying stage.</p><p>For centuries, Zhen Yi Daoist had faced countless dangers, his life-bound treasure damaged many times, but never before had he been pushed to the brink of self-destructing it.  Yet here he was, a top-tier cultivator, facing utter ruin.  His life-bound treasure was destroyed.  A connection of blood and spirit severed.</p><p>Zhen Yi Daoist spat out a mouthful of blood, his face ashen.  His eyes blazed with intense, visceral hatred for the Zuoyan forces.</p><p>"Hahaha…"  Ye Laomo laughed maniacally, sneering, "Old goat, this is your day! But you thought you could stop me with a mere treasure?  You're dreaming!"</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>Before his words faded, a deafening explosion rocked the area. The flying sword illusion created by the self-destructing whisk lasted mere moments before being annihilated.</p><p>The collision was cataclysmic. Both sides unleashed devastating power, a terrifying and chaotic surge of energy that sent countless shattered swords flying.</p><p>Zhen Yi Daoist, powerful as he was, was only one man.  While the Zuoyan cultivator's treasure's attack was weakened, its remaining power was still horrific.</p><p>His eyes bloodshot, Zhen Yi Daoist was left with only despair. He could only dodge, for otherwise he too would perish. But his escape meant others would suffer.  How many Tianxing League cultivators would survive this?  What would become of the Tianxing League's future?</p><p>Then, a searing wave of heat washed over him.  It emanated from a colossal crimson fist, impossibly dense, burning with fierce flames, radiating supremely pure yang energy.  The fist image bypassed Zhen Yi Daoist, creating a second barrier in place of the destroyed whisk's illusion.</p><p>Zhen Yi Daoist's heart leaped. He whirled around.</p><p>There stood Chifa Laozou, his red hair ablaze, eyes wide with fury, a powerful punch poised.  His hands blazed with fire, though it wasn't true flame, but the manifestation of supremely refined yang energy.  He was like a fire god incarnate, his presence overwhelming.  The previous fist image had been his handiwork!</p><p>The fist image, too, was shattered by the Zuoyan cultivator's treasure, but it weakened the attack, buying more time for the Tianxing League.  Then Chifa Laozou roared to the heavens, "Save them!"</p><p>The battlefield shifted in an instant, each leader making critical decisions. Chifa Laozou, without hesitation, chose to save lives.</p>
