<h1>Chapter 1223:  The Request</h1><p>Chapter 1223:  The Request</p><p>Qin Sang stood with his hands behind his back before the inner gate of the Qingyang Demon Sect.</p><p>Tian Mudie's gaze pierced the barrier, towards the tallest peak – Shen Gang Peak.</p><p>Though distant, Tian Mudie's eyesight was exceptional.  On her last visit, Shen Gang Peak was wracked by swirling winds and incessant lightning. A ghostly green figure danced wildly atop the mountain, the Ancestral Saint Fire raging uncontrollably.  Even from afar, one could feel the terrifying power poised to erupt, inspiring deep unease.</p><p>Now, Shen Gang Peak was shrouded in jade-green mist; the wind and lightning had ceased, and even the green shadow of the Ancestral Saint Fire was suppressed by the formation, far calmer than before.</p><p>However, Tian Mudie's divine ability pierced the formation, revealing subtle, recurring disturbances.  The Qingyang Demon Sect had merely suppressed the Ancestral Saint Fire temporarily!</p><p>The scene largely confirmed her suspicions. Qin Sang nodded subtly, withdrawing his gaze and calmly turned to Xiang Qing, who was rapidly approaching.  He had only slightly concealed his presence, but it wasn't enough to hide from a fellow Yuan Ying cultivator; Xiang Qing had noticed his arrival immediately.  This was precisely Qin Sang's intention.</p><p>He dropped his concealing spell, no longer hiding his Yuan Ying master's aura.</p><p>Sect Master Dong's mind buzzed, his face a mask of bewilderment.  Only two words echoed in his head:</p><p>“Yuan Ying… Yuan Ying…”</p><p>It was like a curse, repeating endlessly.  Sect Master Dong froze, his body rigid, his back icy cold.  The Qingfeng Daoist was actually a Yuan Ying cultivator! He had been audacious enough to plot against a sect founded by a Yuan Ying cultivator, even leading a raid.  The fact he wasn't killed on the spot, and didn't share Lu Xing's fate, was down to incredible luck, using up all his good fortune in one go.  Even if the Qingfeng Daoist had annihilated the Yinquan Sect, could the Qingyang Demon Sect possibly allow him to go unpunished?</p><p>Xiang Qing emerged, saw Qin Sang – a stranger and a Yuan Ying cultivator – a flicker of surprise crossing his eyes before he bowed. "I am Xiang Qing.  May I ask the Daoist's name?"</p><p>"My name is Qingfeng."</p><p>Qin Sang returned the bow, replying calmly.</p><p>Sect Master Dong hadn't recovered yet.  The young man, though shocked by Qin Sang's appearance, hadn't suffered the same level of impact.  He was more alert, kneeling before Xiang Qing. "Reporting to the Grand Master, Senior Qingfeng is the founding ancestor of the Moyan Sect."</p><p>"The Moyan Sect?"</p><p>Xiang Qing paused, pondering for a moment before recalling the sect, then carefully scrutinizing Qin Sang.  He remembered the Moyan Sect's leader had barely reached the Golden Core stage; their founding ancestor had been unheard of, yet they had secretly attained Yuan Ying.  Why had this person come unannounced?</p><p>Xiang Qing recalled that the Moyan Sect had always been affiliated with the Qingyang Demon Sect.  Had the ancestor, upon reaching Yuan Ying, developed other ambitions and come to pay respects?</p><p>Regardless, this Yuan Ying cultivator hailed from the Xiao Han region, so there was no reason to expel him. If he was sensible, everything could be easily resolved. If he acted recklessly, Xiang Qing wouldn't mind giving him a lesson.</p><p>Suppressing his doubts, Xiang Qing gestured. "This isn't the place for a chat, Daoist.  Please come to my cave for a drink. I also happen to have another distinguished guest."</p><p>"Very well."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded and followed Xiang Qing. The young man received a telepathic message from Xiang Qing, instructing him to take Sect Master Dong to rest.</p><p>"Sect Master Dong…"</p><p>Awakening from his stupor at the young man's call, Sect Master Dong's thoughts raced. Would Senior Qingfeng hold a grudge? Should he apologize? He didn't think he’d done anything wrong recently…</p><p>By the time he recovered, Qin Sang was already gone, leaving Sect Master Dong feeling lost.  He then sought out the Han Shan Divine Sovereign, only to find him vanished without a trace.</p><p>…</p><p>Before Xiang Qing's cave, pines and cypresses stood tall, a stone platform jutting out, directly facing Shen Gang Peak. A table held a container of fine wine; a woman sat there, Bing Han, the Sect Master of the Xu Ling Sect. She wore a white gown and a pink shawl. While not as beautiful as her senior sister or Chen Yan, she was still a stunning woman with a spirited demeanor.</p><p>Another person stood beside the table.  Seeing him, Qin Sang chuckled inwardly; it was an old acquaintance, Wu Youdao.</p><p>Years ago, Qin Sang had infiltrated the Qingyang Demon Sect, forcibly refining the Qingyang Divine Gang.  His actions were discovered, leading to a battle with Wu Youdao.</p><p>Times had changed.  Back then, Qin Sang had just formed his Corpse Pill, his strength inferior to Wu Youdao's.  He had only managed to escape by using every trick in his arsenal.  Now, he was a Yuan Ying cultivator while Wu Youdao remained at the mid-Golden Core stage, only able to stand by during a gathering of Yuan Ying cultivators.</p><p>However, the fluctuations in Wu Youdao's aura indicated an imminent breakthrough.</p><p>Xiang Qing, still slightly confused, offered a brief introduction of Qin Sang to Bing Han.</p><p>After exchanging pleasantries, the three settled down.</p><p>Xiang Qingping put away a jade cup, took out a golden goblet, poured himself a drink, and then looked at Qin Sang.</p><p>"Forgive my intrusion, I hope I haven't disturbed your leisure," Qin Sang replied calmly, accepting the apology.</p><p>Bing Han, equally curious about Qin Sang, exclaimed in surprise, "Unexpected!  A hidden gem in Little Cold Region.  Your aura… you didn't recently achieve ascension, did you?"</p><p>The cultivation world has its share of hermits dedicated solely to their practice, untouched by worldly affairs.</p><p>However, with the years-long alliance between the two regions and the war against the Abyss, no one wants to see their home fall into enemy hands, to become refugees.  Almost everyone contributes in some way.</p><p>Even recluses are not entirely unknown.</p><p>She and Xiang Qing, one righteous, one demonic, didn't recognize him.  How credible could his claim of founding the Demonflame Sect be, based solely on his word?</p><p>His origins were unclear.  His sudden appearance made him suspect – possibly an Abyss spy.</p><p>They exchanged a glance, concealing their apprehension, waiting to hear his explanation.</p><p>"I indeed achieved Nascent Soul not long ago.  I've come to personally thank Daoist Xiang for your care of my rather inept disciples," Qin Sang raised his goblet, offering a toast to Xiang Qing.</p><p>Xiang Qing frowned slightly, raising his cup in return. "I wouldn't dare claim such credit. I treat all sects under my jurisdiction equally.  Daoist, you wouldn't visit without reason.  Speak frankly."</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang remain unmoved, he grew impatient, wanting to end this.</p><p>Qin Sang, however, had been subtly observing Shen Gang Peak, and close observation solidified his conviction.</p><p>He'd used the identity of the Demonflame Sect's ancestor for this very reason. If the reality differed from his expectations, he could simply deflect, returning to formulate a different plan.</p><p>His expression turned serious, putting aside the pretense. "My purpose is to propose a transaction, Daoist Xiang. I can help you resolve a critical threat!"</p><p>He gestured towards the summit of Shen Gang Peak.</p><p>Xiang Qing and Bing Han's faces changed.</p><p>Qin Sang, seeing their reaction, knew he was on the right track.</p><p>Xiang Qing's face darkened. "What threat, Daoist Qingfeng? Explain yourself."</p><p>Qin Sang looked deeply at Xiang Qing, getting straight to the point.</p><p>"You use a great formation to seal the Ancestral Sacred Fire, believing it concealed.  You may deceive others, but not me.  The fire is only temporarily suppressed; the danger remains.  The longer it's delayed, the harder it will be to resolve.  When it can no longer be contained, the Ancestral Sacred Fire will erupt, destroying far more than Shen Gang Peak…"</p>
