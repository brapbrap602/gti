<h1>Chapter 642: The Gloom Stinkbug</h1><p>Qin Sang was searching for a spirit insect called the Gloom Stinkbug. Resembling an ordinary stinkbug, it favored dark, damp environments and fed on Yin energy day and night, hence its name.</p><p>After leaving the Bear Mountain region, Qin Sang, under a disguised identity, visited several markets and contacted various factions to gather information, finally selecting nine spirit insects as targets.</p><p>Five of these were listed on the Rare Insect List. Qin Sang knew the cultivation methods for some, but not for others. However, with the Redfire Goldsap in his possession, he wasn't worried, at least not before the third transformation.  These rare insects possessed unique abilities, making them highly desirable.</p><p>The other four were common spirit insects with limited potential, but their innate powers were formidable, providing significant assistance during the Foundation Establishment stage. They were Qin Sang's fallback options, a contingency plan.</p><p>The rumors and records he gathered might not be reliable.  The spirit insects might have migrated, encountered predators, been captured, or even transformed and left their habitats.</p><p>Qin Sang believed that finding even one of the nine chosen spirit insects would be a success. He set high standards and was prepared to invest significant time and effort in his search.</p><p>The Gloom Stinkbug was one of the six rare insects. It was highly regarded on the Rare Insect List.</p><p>During its first two transformations, the Gloom Stinkbug's abilities were unremarkable.  This was true for most spirit insects; only in the third transformation, or even later, would they undergo dramatic changes.</p><p>After the third transformation, the Gloom Stinkbug could condense the Yin energy within its body into a black sword. This sword was incredibly fast and sharp, rivaling true magical swords, and emitted no detectable aura when inactive. </p><p>Motionless as a statue, yet as swift as lightning when it struck!</p><p>A spirit insect master with a third-transformation Gloom Stinkbug effectively gained an incredibly sharp hidden sword, which didn't consume the master's own spiritual sense, making it difficult to defend against.</p><p>Qin Sang was very interested. Therefore, the Gloom Stinkbug was his first target.</p><p>However, the Gloom Stinkbug ranked lower than the Ghost-Head Hornet on the Witch Insect List, at the very bottom. No one dared to choose it as their primary insect gu.</p><p>This was because the Gloom Stinkbug's transformation was extremely difficult. It had a long lifespan and grew slowly. Without the proper method, a Foundation Establishment cultivator might not live long enough to see their Gloom Stinkbug reach its third transformation.</p><p>Among the cultivation methods Qin Sang possessed for several rare insects, one was for the Gloom Stinkbug.  The Spirit Controlling Sect had found an incomplete cultivation method in ancient texts. It required several Yin-attribute spiritual pills used in combination, which would accelerate the Gloom Stinkbug's growth several times over.</p><p>A cultivator had once encountered a second-transformation Gloom Stinkbug in this wasteland, but before he could react, the insect escaped into a subterranean cave and vanished.</p><p>This was the only lead Qin Sang had. To capture the Gloom Stinkbug, he first needed to find the cave.</p><p>"I've searched over half of the wasteland. Why haven't I found the cave? Could an earthquake have changed the terrain?"</p><p>Qin Sang wondered, scanning the vast wasteland and deciding to change direction.</p><p>After taking only a few steps, Qin Sang let out a soft exclamation and stopped. Then, with a flash of sword light, he flew a thousand zhang to the left, hovered in the air, and looked down.</p><p>"Found it!"</p><p>Thick grass completely concealed the cave entrance. Qin Sang was about to clear it with his sword, but he paused, then sheathed his Ebony Sword and silently descended into the cave.</p><p>The cave was extremely deep. Qin Sang descended for the time it takes an incense stick to burn before reaching a subterranean rift. The underground space was incredibly cold and gloomy, the perfect environment for a Gloom Stinkbug.</p><p>However, upon seeing the subterranean rift, Qin Sang felt a headache coming on.</p><p>He hadn't expected it to be so vast, with countless branching passages, even more complex than the Earth Sinkhole in Shaohua Mountain. Searching for a tiny Gloom Stinkbug in such a place was like searching for a needle in a haystack.</p><p>It was a pity that the Flying Night Fiend couldn't stray too far from him. Otherwise, they could split up and search, greatly increasing their efficiency.</p><p>Gloom Stinkbugs favored cold environments, the stronger they were, the more so. Qin Sang decided to head directly to the deepest part of the cave.</p><p>He summoned the Flying Night Fiend and descended rapidly. The deeper they went, the more intensely cold and eerie it became. When he felt he'd reached a sufficient depth, Qin Sang retrieved several bottles and jars from his Qianjun Ring, filled with powders and liquids, and scattered them along the way.</p><p>These were insect-attracting concoctions, some purchased from witch cultivators and others refined by Qin Sang himself based on the Spirit Controlling Sect's formulas. He had prepared a large quantity.</p><p>This method worked on some spirit insects.</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't sure if it would attract the Gloom Stinkbug, but it was worth a try.</p><p>The icy chill grew increasingly intense, threatening to penetrate his bones. Qin Sang was forced to circulate his true essence for protection. After descending further, he heard the gurgling of water below.</p><p>Intrigued, Qin Sang went down to investigate and discovered an underground river. Yin energy had permeated the water, turning it gray, preventing it from freezing.</p><p>Standing by the riverbank, Qin Sang looked up. Along the way, he had scattered over a dozen bottles of insect-attracting concoctions, yet not a single spirit insect had been lured.</p><p>This was a good sign.</p><p>Except in special circumstances, each spirit insect had its own territory and didn't tolerate intrusion. The presence of other insects would indicate that the Gloom Stinkbug was gone.</p><p>Qin Sang observed the underground environment and began searching along the river, using his spiritual sense and insect-attracting concoctions, leaving no corner unchecked.</p><p>The cave was like a giant maze. Qin Sang searched for an entire day, but found nothing.</p><p>Finally, he gave up and returned to where he had first entered the rift.</p><p>Qin Sang approached a protruding rock by the riverbank. After carefully examining the surrounding terrain, he focused his mind, and the Flying Night Fiend leaped into the river and submerged itself at the bottom.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang retrieved a jade bottle from his Qianjun Ring.</p><p>The bottle contained a viscous, crimson liquid, resembling a ruby, shimmering with a captivating luster. Within the liquid, golden flashes flickered intermittently, a strange and wondrous sight.</p><p>This was the fruit of the Red Gold Vine, the Redfire Goldsap!</p><p>Spirit insects were rare in the Small Cold Realm, and Qin Sang hadn't had a chance to use the Redfire Goldsap since obtaining it. Now, it was finally time.</p><p>Qin Sang's confidence in venturing deep into the Western Frontier to search for insects based on flimsy rumors stemmed from this treasure.</p><p>The Redfire Goldsap could aid a spirit insect's transformation, making it incredibly alluring, far more effective than any insect-attracting concoction. This was an advantage others lacked.</p><p>Since the other concoctions had failed, Qin Sang had to resort to the Redfire Goldsap.</p><p>He didn't need much, only enough to release its aroma.</p><p>At the same time, Qin Sang opened the insect cage at his waist and retrieved several Ghost-Head Hornet larvae.</p><p>The larvae of other spirit insects were also excellent bait, especially those that had undergone bloodline mutations. Combining the two, Qin Sang didn't believe the Gloom Stinkbug could resist.</p><p>He no longer had any interest in cultivating Bloodwing Ghost-Head Hornets.</p><p>Without the potential for transformation, no matter how many Bloodwing Ghost-Head Hornets he had, they could only pose a threat to Foundation Establishment cultivators.</p><p>Qin Sang channeled his true essence, grabbed the Bloodwing Ghost-Head Hornet larvae, erased their consciousness, then carefully opened the jade bottle and extracted a trace of Redfire Goldsap, applying it to their bodies.</p><p>He flung a few of them into the distance, leaving one, coated with the most Redfire Goldsap, on the rock platform.</p><p>Chapter 642: The Gloom Stalker</p><p>The spirit insect Qin Sang was searching for was called the Gloom Stalker.  Resembling an earthly stink bug, it favored dark, damp environments, feeding on Yin energy day and night, hence its name.</p><p>After leaving the Bear Mountain region, Qin Sang disguised himself, visited several marketplaces, contacted various factions, and gathered information. He eventually narrowed his search to nine spirit insects.</p><p>Five of these were listed on the Exotic Insect List.  Qin Sang knew the cultivation methods for some, but not for others.</p><p>However, Qin Sang possessed Redfire Goldmetal, so he wasn't worried, at least not until the third metamorphosis. These exotic insects all possessed unique and tempting abilities.</p><p>The other four were ordinary spirit insects with limited potential, but their innate powers could greatly assist a cultivator at the Foundation Establishment stage.  These were Qin Sang's secondary choices, kept in reserve.</p><p>The rumors and records he'd collected might not be reliable.</p><p>The insects could have migrated, encountered predators, been captured, or even metamorphosed and left their habitat.</p><p>Qin Sang felt that if he could find even one of the nine insects he'd selected, it would be a success.  </p><p>He had high standards and was prepared to invest time and effort in his search.</p><p>The Gloom Stalker was one of the six exotic insects.</p><p>It was highly regarded on the Exotic Insect List.</p><p>Before its second metamorphosis, the Gloom Stalker's abilities were unremarkable, as was the case with most spirit insects. Only after the third, or even later, would earth-shattering changes occur.</p><p>After the third metamorphosis, the Gloom Stalker could transform its internal Yin energy into a black sword.  Incredibly swift and sharp, it rivaled a true magical flying sword, and when inactive, it emitted no detectable aura.</p><p>Still as a mountain, fast as lightning!</p><p>Possessing a third-metamorphosis Gloom Stalker was equivalent to having an incredibly sharp hidden sword, one that wouldn't consume the cultivator's own spiritual sense, making it extremely difficult to defend against.</p><p>Qin Sang was very interested.</p><p>So, his first target was the Gloom Stalker.</p><p>However, the Gloom Stalker ranked lower than the Ghost-Head Hornet on the Witch Insect List, near the bottom. No one dared to choose it as their primary symbiotic insect.</p><p>This was because the Gloom Stalker was extremely difficult to cultivate. It had a long lifespan and grew slowly. Without the proper method, a Foundation Establishment cultivator could spend their entire life without seeing their Gloom Stalker reach the third metamorphosis.</p><p>Among the cultivation methods Qin Sang knew for several exotic insects was one for the Gloom Stalker.</p><p>The Spirit Controlling Sect had found an incomplete method in ancient texts.  It required several Yin-type spiritual pills used in combination to accelerate the Gloom Stalker's growth rate several times over.</p><p>A cultivator had once encountered a second-metamorphosis Gloom Stalker in this wasteland, but before he could react, the insect had vanished into a subterranean cavern.</p><p>This was the only lead Qin Sang had. To capture the Gloom Stalker, he first had to find the cavern.</p><p>“I've searched half the wasteland. Why haven't I found it yet? Could there have been an earthquake that altered the terrain?”</p><p>Qin Sang wondered, scanning the vast wasteland. He decided to change direction.</p><p>After only a few steps, Qin Sang let out a soft exclamation and stopped. Then, with a flash of sword light, he soared a thousand zhang to the left, hovering in the air and looking down.</p><p>“Found it!”</p><p>Thick grass completely concealed the cavern's entrance. Qin Sang was about to cut it open with his sword but reconsidered. He sheathed his Ebony Sword and silently slipped into the cavern.</p><p>The cavern was extremely deep. Qin Sang descended for the time it takes an incense stick to burn before reaching a subterranean rift.  It was frigid down below, the perfect environment for a Gloom Stalker.</p><p>However, upon seeing the rift, Qin Sang's head began to ache.</p><p>He hadn't expected it to be so vast, with countless branching passages, even more complex than the Earth Sinkhole of Shaohua Mountain. Searching for a tiny Gloom Stalker in such a place was like searching for a needle in a haystack.</p><p>Unfortunately, his Sky-Soaring Yaksha couldn't stray too far from him; otherwise, splitting up the search would be much more efficient.</p><p>Gloom Stalkers favored cold, and the stronger they were, the more so. Qin Sang decided to go directly to the deepest part of the cavern.</p><p>He summoned the Sky-Soaring Yaksha and quickly descended. The deeper he went, the colder and more eerie it became. When he felt he'd reached a sufficient depth, Qin Sang retrieved bottles and jars from his Qianjun Ring. They contained powders and liquids, which he scattered along the way.</p><p>These were insect-attracting concoctions. Some were bought from witch cultivators, and others were refined by Qin Sang himself based on Spirit Controlling Sect formulas. He had prepared plenty.</p><p>This method worked on some spirit insects.</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't sure if it would work on the Gloom Stalker, but it was worth a try.</p><p>The chill grew more intense, threatening to seep into his bones.  Qin Sang was forced to circulate his True Essence for protection. After descending further, he heard the gurgling of water below.</p><p>Surprised, Qin Sang went down to investigate. It turned out to be Yin energy mixing with an underground river, creating grey water that wouldn't freeze.</p><p>Standing by the riverbank, Qin Sang looked up.</p><p>He had scattered over a dozen bottles of insect-attracting concoctions along the way, but not a single insect had been lured out.</p><p>This was a good sign.</p><p>Except in special circumstances, every spirit insect had its own territory and wouldn't tolerate intrusion. The presence of other insects would indicate that the Gloom Stalker was gone.</p><p>Qin Sang observed the surroundings and began searching along the river, using his spiritual sense and the concoctions, leaving no corner unchecked.</p><p>The cavern was like a giant maze.  After searching for an entire day, Qin Sang found nothing.</p><p>Finally, he gave up and returned to where he had first descended.</p><p>Qin Sang arrived at a protruding rock by the riverbank.  After carefully studying the terrain, he had an idea. The Sky-Soaring Yaksha leaped into the river and lurked at the bottom.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang retrieved a jade bottle from his Qianjun Ring.</p><p>The bottle contained a viscous, crimson liquid, like a ruby, shimmering with a captivating luster.  Golden light flickered within, a strange and wondrous sight.</p><p>This was the fruit of the Redgold Vine, Redfire Goldmetal!</p><p>Spirit insects were rare in the Small Cold Region, so Qin Sang hadn't had a chance to use the Redfire Goldmetal he'd obtained.  He'd kept it stored until now, and finally, it was time to put it to use.</p><p>Qin Sang's confidence in venturing alone into the Western Frontier based on a vague rumor stemmed from this substance.</p><p>Redfire Goldmetal could aid spirit insect metamorphosis and was extremely attractive to them, more so than any other concoction. This was an advantage no one else had.</p><p>Since the other concoctions were ineffective, Qin Sang had to resort to Redfire Goldmetal.</p><p>He didn't need much, just enough to release its scent.</p><p>At the same time, Qin Sang opened the insect basket at his waist and took out several Ghost-Head Hornet larvae.</p><p>The larvae of other spirit insects were also excellent lures, especially those with mutated bloodlines. Combining the two, Qin Sang didn't believe the Gloom Stalker could resist.</p><p>He no longer had any interest in cultivating Bloodwing Ghost-Head Hornets.</p><p>Without the potential for metamorphosis, no matter how many he had, they could only threaten Foundation Establishment cultivators.</p><p>Qin Sang channeled his True Essence, grasped the Bloodwing Ghost-Head Hornet larvae, erased their consciousness, and opened the jade bottle.  Carefully, he drew out a trace of Redfire Goldmetal and applied it to the larvae.</p><p>He flung a few of them into the distance, leaving one, coated with the most Redfire Goldmetal, on the rock platform.</p>
