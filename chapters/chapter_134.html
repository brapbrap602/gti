<h1>Chapter 127: The Furnace</h1><p>**Parents, siblings, family...**</p><p>Qin Sang valued his loved ones from his previous life the most.</p><p>It didn’t matter who his enemy was. He didn’t care at all. His only regret was that he could no longer see his family and would never be able to repay his parents for raising him, nor could he carry on the family line...</p><p>There was still so much he had yet to do.</p><p>Qin Sang knew that everything was an illusion, but he couldn’t bear to leave. He watched his parents and elder brother discuss family matters. He listened to his little sister, Qin Zi, act spoiled as he felt a pang of sadness in his heart. Finally, three days passed, and he was kicked out by the Crimson Gourd.</p><p>His body felt light, and then he landed heavily on the ground. Qin Sang opened his eyes and saw his loved ones had disappeared. He looked up at the Great Hall, and sadness flickered in his eyes. But he suppressed his emotions, stood up, and regained his resolve.</p><p>“Disciple Qin Sang pays respect to the Sect Master.”</p><p>Qin Sang bowed to Sect Master Yu. He glanced around and saw five others standing to the side of the Sect Master.</p><p>The first was a young boy who carried a sword on his back. His aura was as sharp as a drawn sword, and there was an undisguised arrogance in his eyes. He was only at the tenth layer of Qi Refining.</p><p>The second was a young man aged thirty or so. His face was resolute. He stood with his hands clasped behind him and his eyes slightly narrowed. There were no waves in his gaze; he stood there as still as an ancient tree.</p><p>Qin Sang knew both of them. The boy was Feng Wenjian, who was not only talented but also had unparalleled sword techniques among Qi Refining disciples. He was quite charming and a popular figure in Mount Shaohua.</p><p>The young man was much more low-key. His name was He Mu. Like Qin Sang, he kept to himself and cultivated diligently. He only appeared at Truth Path Peak when his Martial Uncle lectured. He was already at the thirteenth layer of Qi Refining, but he had yet to enter Foundation Establishment.</p><p>Then there were two middle-aged men and a white-haired elder, all of whom were Foundation Establishment cultivators.</p><p>Qin Sang recognized the elder, who managed techniques and incantations at Pagoda Peak. His surname was Gong.</p><p>“You were able to endure for three days in the Crimson Gourd Gourd. Your heart-nature is good,” Sect Master Yu nodded at Qin Sang in praise and told Qin Sang to wait to the side.</p><p>People were gradually ejected from the Crimson Gourd Gourd’s illusion, and only one Foundation Establishment elder had passed the test.</p><p>In the end, seven people passed the Crimson Gourd Gourd illusion.</p><p>Three Qi Refining disciples and four Foundation Establishment disciples.</p><p>Sect Master Yu took two steps forward and bowed deeply to the Crimson Gourd Gourd. “Many thanks to Elder Che; I have already selected the disciples. Please retrieve your magic weapon.”</p><p>The Crimson Gourd Gourd turned into a streak of light and shot through the air, disappearing into the horizon. However, the Golden Core Patriarch Che never showed himself.</p><p>Sect Master Yu watched the Crimson Gourd Gourd leave respectfully. Then, he flicked his horsehair whisk to close the hall doors and turned to face the others with a cold glare. He looked at each of them in turn, and then he said, one word at a time in a threatening tone: “Every word that is uttered in this hall shall not be spoken of outside. If you do, your body will perish, and your family will suffer. This is the decree of the Nascent Soul Master; do not say that you were not warned!”</p><p>The others paled and looked at each other in shock. This was an order from the Nascent Soul Master. What he said would come true. They dared not gamble or harbor any illusions.</p><p>Without hesitation, all seven of them swore to keep the matter secret and never reveal a word of it.</p><p>Sect Master Yu watched them swear with indifference. Then, he took out several jade slips from his mustard seed pouch and gave each person one.</p><p>“This is the technique that you will be cultivating.”</p><p>There was only one technique on the jade slip, called the “Profound Yin Jade Cauldron Scripture.”</p><p>After reading the introduction to the technique, Qin Sang frowned slightly, feeling somewhat puzzled.</p><p>This “Profound Yin Jade Cauldron Scripture” did not seem to match the rumored dual cultivation technique. It had three layers in total, and only male disciples could cultivate all of them.</p><p>There were no cultivation techniques for female disciples, nor was there any explanation of how to achieve the harmony of Yin and Yang or the connection between Heaven and Earth.</p><p>“How can we reach the great path together without a partner to cultivate this kind of dual cultivation technique?”</p><p>I only heard Sect Master Yu say: “When cultivating this technique through dual cultivation, your inner Qi energy will be somewhat depleted. However, you needn’t worry. The sect will bestow the Nine Yang Pill to help you recover your Qi energy……”</p><p>Before he finished speaking, the cultivator surnamed Gong suddenly raised his head, a face full of anger. He glared at Sect Master Yu and shouted: “Sect Master Senior Brother, why aren’t you being honest with us! What kind of dual cultivation technique is this? Isn’t it just a method of evil cultivation! We work ourselves to death. Are we competing to become the furnace? How absurd! How laughable!”</p><p>The words of the cultivator surnamed Gong were like a stone that breaks the sky.</p><p>Sect Master Yu’s expression changed slightly.</p><p>The others were as if they had been struck in the head with a heavy blow. They savored the words Sect Master Yu had just said. Wouldn’t that be considered as being a furnace? Otherwise, how could a righteous orthodox dual cultivation technique damage Qi energy?</p><p>In fact, some of the more perceptive ones had already realized that something was wrong, but they hadn’t expected the cultivator surnamed Gong to dare to embarrass the Sect Master like this, directly exposing the hidden implications.</p><p>When Jian Wen heard this, his brows suddenly furrowed. He asked repeatedly: “Martial Uncle Gong, can the Qi energy lost from being a furnace be reversed by the Nine Yang Pill? Other than this, are there any other detriments?”</p><p>The cultivator surnamed Gong sneered. He ignored the ugly expression on Sect Master Yu’s face and said loudly: “The Nine Yang Pill is indeed a rare spiritual medicine. Even if the other party shows mercy, it can at most only replenish up to ninety percent of the Qi energy. Unless your luck is good and you can find those few types of heavenly treasures and earthly herbs. As far as I know, Mount Shaohua does not have this kind of spiritual medicine in its collection. As for the consequences of being a furnace, if it were just a loss of Qi energy, how could this kind of evil cultivation technique be reviled by everyone as a demonic technique! After the so-called ‘dual cultivation’, the best result is that an implication is planted in your Primordial Spirit, making you believe that your karmic roots are deep and that you can’t bear to be apart from the other party. In more severe cases, you will completely become a slave. Your Primordial Spirit will be exhausted, turning you into a complete useless person! Nothing but useless meat!”</p><p>As soon as these words came out, everyone was shocked.</p><p>They were shocked by the viciousness of the Profound Yin Jade Cauldron True Scripture. They were even more horrified that the Daoist Wu Ren, who came from the prestigious orthodox sect Mount Shaohua, would actually cultivate this demonic cultivation technique!</p><p>Everyone cast an appreciative glance at the cultivator surnamed Gong. Then, they looked at Sect Master Yu with undivided attention, waiting for him to explain.</p><p>“Martial Brother Gong, I know that ever since Martial Sister Liu was murdered by a demon on the Ancient Immortal Battlefield, you have hated the art of replenishment techniques.”</p><p>Sect Master Yu suppressed his anger but still let the cultivator surnamed Gong finish speaking before opening his mouth to say: “But how could Martial Uncle Wu Ren collude with demons? In selecting disciples in the sect, it was precisely because he was unwilling to harm people. Without you saying anything, I will also clearly state the advantages and disadvantages to you. Everything depends on your own wishes. We will never force you. Although it’s true that the lost Qi energy cannot be reversed after supplementing with the Nine Yang Pill, it’s only that your Qi sea will be slightly smaller than cultivators of the same realm. You might suffer a bit during battles, but it won’t affect your own realm. Moreover, you can still make up for it in the future…”</p><p>The cultivator surnamed Gong looked disdainful. “What about the Primordial Spirit?”</p>
