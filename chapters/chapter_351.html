Chapter 344: The Choice


The Heavenly Corpse Talisman can harm, but it can also save.
However, that ‘save’ is a big question mark.
Based on my experience refining corpses a few days ago, the Heavenly Corpse Talisman can indeed seal Tan Jie's soul.  Since Tan Jie's cultivation is low and his soul is weak, with careful control, I'm confident there won't be any accidents.
However, once the talisman enters the body, it will completely merge with the soul, undergoing strange changes, becoming inseparable, perhaps it can no longer be called a soul.
Tan Jie doesn't have a jade Buddha to protect his soul; after the fusion, separation will be impossible.
This process is irreversible, unsolvable.
At least, the *Heavenly Yin Corpse Manual* doesn't offer a solution.
Even if Tan Hao finds a way to undo the talisman, whether Tan Jie will awaken, or if something worse than death might happen, all remain unknown.
He might be trapped for life, perhaps even affecting the legendary cycle of reincarnation.
It can only be said that the world is vast and full of wonders.
Perhaps, a miracle might happen in the future.
It's a slim chance.


Should Tan Jie be laid to rest?
Or should Tan Hao persist in his obsession, relentlessly clinging to an extremely slim hope?
The decision rests solely with Tan Hao.


I didn't say anything directly. I described the Heavenly Corpse Talisman as a peculiar technique, using the demonic sect's corpse refinement techniques as an analogy, explaining its advantages and disadvantages to Tan Hao, particularly its consequences.
I believe Tan Hao understood.


After listening, Tan Hao stood there, stunned, unable to utter a word.


"Think it over carefully before deciding. But don't take too long, otherwise, Tan Jie's soul might dissipate too much, affecting the outcome," I patted Tan Hao's shoulder and left the cave.


If it were me, what would I choose?


I shook my head, not wanting to think about it.


Back in my cave, while waiting for Tan Hao's reply, I organized my magical tools. Regardless of Tan Hao's decision, I must leave for the Ancient Immortal Battlefield in a few days to rescue Shi Hong.


I have my own matters to attend to and cannot stay in Yin Mountain Pass for too long.


Liang Yan is active near Yin Mountain Pass and Feng Cang Market, often using aliases, his movements are secretive and low-key. I need to secretly investigate further to ascertain his whereabouts.


Liang Yan's strength is unknown.
Out of caution, I'll treat him as a mid-Foundation Establishment cultivator for now.


With my top-grade magical tools, I'm not afraid of any opponent at the same level. However, how to eliminate Liang Yan without endangering Shi Hong requires careful planning.


If I can set a trap beforehand and wait for Liang Yan to walk into it, that would be ideal. I'm confident that Liang Yan won't escape my grasp.


Capturing him alive is not impossible either.


I was pondering how to catch Liang Yan without alarming him, when someone knocked on the cave.


I opened the cave's restriction and found Tan Hao standing outside. Seeing his expression, I knew his decision without him having to speak.


I didn't expect Tan Hao to make up his mind so quickly.


With a complex expression, I asked in a low voice, "Brother Tan, are you truly certain?"


Tan Hao's eyes were red, a hint of struggle flashed in his eyes, then he took a deep breath and said resolutely, "Brother Qin, since Tan Jie fell into a coma, I've given up on the hope of becoming an immortal!


"All my life, only one thought has sustained me: to cure Tan Jie! I'm willing to trade my life for his.


"If he dies, I don't know what meaning life would hold anymore.


"As long as there's a glimmer of hope, I will never give up!


"Brother Qin, what preparations are needed for this extraordinary technique? I'll go and get them now!"


I said nothing more, only shaking my head.  "I have everything here. If you agree, we can begin immediately. Wait outside, it won't take long…"


Closing the cave.
I went to the crystal coffin, opened the coffin, and exposed Tan Jie's body.


Regarding Tan Hao's choice, I don't want to comment further, nor can I determine whether it's good or bad.


After all, in this world, reincarnation exists only in legends; nobody knows if it truly exists, while death is something everyone can directly witness.


Although I've used the Heavenly Corpse Talisman once, I remained extremely cautious. After all, Tan Jie's cultivation is low, his soul is extremely fragile, and there's no room for error.


When I sensed the connection between the talisman and Tan Jie's soul, I struck the talisman into his forehead.


There was almost no resistance. The talisman easily sealed Tan Jie, merging with his soul.


Apart from the necessary restrictions, I didn't do anything extra, fearing unforeseen consequences, then carefully placed Tan Jie back into the crystal coffin.


Besides, Tan Hao couldn't possibly use Tan Jie as a corpse puppet.


After the fusion with the Heavenly Corpse Talisman, Tan Jie's soul indeed stopped dissipating.


The future of the Tan brothers' fate rests in the hands of heaven.


Qin Sang made a final check, then opened the cave's protective barrier. Tan Hao burst in, and seeing Tan Hao's condition, Qin Sang's face showed a mixture of sorrow and joy, his eyes unusually complex.

Yun Youzi appeared sometime during this, entering and nodding to Qin Sang.

Qin Sang's mind stirred.  He took a jade bottle from his pouch and handed it to Tan Hao. Inside was a Foundation Establishment Pill.

"Take this."

He had received three Foundation Establishment Pills in total: one as a reward from his sect, two among Sun De's belongings. He had taken one himself, and given one to Song Ying to fulfill a promise.

This last pill had been intended for bartering, but it had remained unused.  Foundation Establishment Pills are useless to Foundation Establishment cultivators, and Qin Sang had no intention of taking on disciples, so it wasn't particularly precious to him.  However, it's a treasure beyond measure for Qi Condensation cultivators.

Tan Hao's resolute decision moved Qin Sang to offer this final help.

Tan Hao had yet to achieve Foundation Establishment, not due to lack of talent, but because he had delayed his cultivation to care for Tan Jie.  His talent far surpasses Qin Sang's. Although he's over fifty, with the help of the Foundation Establishment Pill, there might still be a chance.

Looking at the bright blue pill in the jade bottle, Tan Hao was completely stunned.

Noticing Qin Sang's sideways glance, Yun Youzi chuckled wryly, a look of helpless amusement on his face.  "You… you even plotted against this old Daoist…"

Qin Sang smiled faintly. When it comes to achieving Foundation Establishment at the age of one hundred, with depleted vital energy, no one had more experience than Yun Youzi.  With his guidance, Tan Hao would surely benefit greatly.

Yun Youzi didn't get angry. After a moment's thought, he also produced a jade bottle containing a jade-green pill.

"This Biying Pill is something I refined during my Qi Condensation stage to replenish my dwindling vital energy and break through to Foundation Establishment. It's no longer useful to me now. Take it, Daoist Tan. Your condition is far better than mine was back then.  After consuming it, spend three days refining the medicinal power. Combined with Qin's Foundation Establishment Pill, your chances of success are considerable."
