<h1>Chapter 1776: Escape</h1><p>Chapter 1776: Escape</p><p>A consciousness swept over the lotus seed. It didn't seem to be a magical artifact; words appeared on it, resembling a cultivation technique.</p><p>Just as Qin Sang was about to investigate further, Bai's warning made him hastily withdraw his consciousness and put away the seed.</p><p>"Outside!"</p><p>Bai's tone was grave.</p><p>Qin Sang looked up; his entanglement with Old Devil Mu had brought them to the foot of Yitian Peak.  A thin mist drifted around, obscuring the view.</p><p>Stone forests stretched out, and mountains rose and fell.</p><p>There wasn't a single figure in sight.</p><p>But after Bai's warning, Qin Sang also felt a subtle sense of being watched. He immediately activated his celestial eye ability, his sight piercing through the Spirit-Subduing Domain, vaguely seeing countless mountain shadows beyond.</p><p>On one of the peaks, several figures were watching them.</p><p>"How are there so many people here? Is Old Devil Mu throwing himself into a net?"</p><p>Qin Sang was startled.</p><p>He thought that Old Devil Mu, gravely injured and dying, would be escaping alone, not seeking anyone's company.</p><p>This group had clearly been hidden nearby, directly in the path of Old Devil Mu's escape, alerted by the commotion of Qin Sang's killing.</p><p>The number of cultivators who entered the inner hall was limited; the inner hall was vast, with countless secret realms, and even fewer made it to the幽谷 (Yougu) and the Spirit-Subduing Domain. So many gathered together, guarding outside the Spirit-Subduing Domain – their intentions were unclear.</p><p>Were they underlings of the Demon Lord or some other force?</p><p>"No!"</p><p>Qin Sang noticed something unusual about these people; some had horns on their heads, others even had tails!</p><p>"Demons! Transformed Great Demons!"</p><p>Even in the inner hall of the Seven Kills Palace, only ferocious beasts existed.</p><p>Top-tier ferocious beasts were comparable to transformed great demons in strength, but for some unknown reason, their ferocity eroded their minds, and transformed ferocious beasts had never appeared before. These demons must have infiltrated from the outside.</p><p>Initially, the Nine-Phoenix King had shot a long feather into the celestial barrier, the purpose truly being to smuggle herself into the inner hall, and she wasn't alone; so many great demons came in together.</p><p>What was the purpose of these transformed great demons lurking at the edge of the Spirit-Subduing Domain?</p><p>Almost instinctively, Qin Sang activated the disguise technique given to him by Yuan Zhu.</p><p>The gathering of transformed great demons outside the Spirit-Subduing Domain was likely due to insufficient cultivation and the suppression of the Spirit-Subduing Domain, but it didn't mean that only these demons had entered the inner hall.</p><p>If there were late-stage transformed great demons, they could already be inside the Spirit-Subduing Domain, hidden somewhere.</p><p>Qin Sang's mind raced. Although the great demons couldn't enter easily for now, he didn't want to become their enemy or be targeted by them.</p><p>This technique allowed Qin Sang to carry a trace of the aura of a transformed great demon, confusing their judgment and muddying the waters.</p><p>But when Qin Sang saw a tense pretty face in the crowd, his heart sank, and he muttered, "Bad."</p><p>The Nine-Phoenix King was there!</p><p>Their last encounter was during the second time the Witch Clan opened the outer hall.</p><p>He had disguised himself as a demon and encountered the Nine-Phoenix King, feigning death and escaping into a hurricane. Judging by the Nine-Phoenix King's expression, she must have recognized him.</p><p>Outside the Spirit-Subduing Domain.</p><p>Various demon kings emerged, looking towards Yitian Peak, their expressions varied.</p><p>They had hidden here, waiting for the Jiao Dragon King and the Nine-Lives Xuan Turtle to steal the dragon corpse, but unexpectedly witnessed a good show – the hunting of a human Yuan Ying cultivator.</p><p>"How is it him?"</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang, the Nine-Phoenix King found him familiar. Finally recalling, it was a demon she believed to be a dead castaway.</p><p>Hearing the Nine-Phoenix King's description, the other demon kings were astonished.</p><p>"He was just a small demon at the Yao Dan stage when the Seven Kills Palace opened last time. It's impossible for him to surpass us in such a short time. How could he come and go freely within the Spirit-Subduing Domain? And hunt a Yuan Ying cultivator alone? Are you mistaken?"</p><p>The Spirit-Subduing Domain's restrictions were impartial and not specifically targeted at demons.</p><p>"The thunder's power just now was indeed weak."</p><p>"The power of the black fire is hard to determine, but I felt a palpitation."</p><p>"His aura is strange..."</p><p>…</p><p>The demon kings discussed animatedly.</p><p>"No mistake! It's him!"</p><p>The Nine-Phoenix King stared fixedly at Qin Sang.</p><p>If this person was also a demon castaway, having cultivated the *Burning Blood True Technique*, he would have lost the chance to transform. If he were human, he couldn't possibly have higher cultivation than her, otherwise, he could have captured her directly last time, seizing the Sky Phoenix Feather and True Feather.</p><p>To dare to appear under her nose, and she hadn't even noticed!</p><p>Unforgivable!</p><p>The Nine-Phoenix King became furious, decisively saying, "The Seven Kills Palace has always been occupied by humans… This person must have treasures that can withstand the suppression of the Spirit-Subduing Domain!"</p><p>Before her words finished,</p><p>A crimson light pierced through the mist.</p><p>The Nine-Phoenix King immediately and without hesitation summoned the Sky Phoenix True Feather.</p><p>The demon kings exchanged glances, but offered no resistance.  Nine-Phoenix King's judgment might be correct;  seizing this treasure would give them a chance to enter the Spirit-镇压 Realm and search for the corpse.</p><p>Unfortunately, lacking the True Feather of the Heavenly Phoenix, they could only watch.</p><p>Seeing the red light, Qin Sang instantly recalled the shocking scene from years ago—the feather's terrifying power, breaking the celestial barrier and causing it to tremble.</p><p>Could this treasure actually withstand the Spirit-镇压 Realm's restrictions?</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>Qin Sang cursed under his breath, instantly turning to flee.</p><p>But unexpectedly, the feather seemed to possess the same instantaneous movement ability as a Nascent Soul cultivator, appearing like a phantom. One moment it entered the Spirit-镇压 Realm, the next, Qin Sang's vision was filled with crimson.</p><p>Within the red light, a long feather shimmered, and a graceful figure gradually solidified—Nine-Phoenix King.</p><p>His path was blocked!</p><p>Qin Sang was startled, changing direction without a moment's hesitation.</p><p>The feather descended from the heavens, a wall of flame forming as Nine-Phoenix King's figure slowly emerged.  She had successfully entered the Spirit-镇压 Realm using the power of the True Feather of the Heavenly Phoenix.</p><p>'Whoosh whoosh!'</p><p>The flames danced wildly.  The power of the True Feather of the Heavenly Phoenix burned brightly.</p><p>Nine-Phoenix King exerted all her strength to maintain the feather's power; flames encircled her body, making her seem like a true Heavenly Phoenix emerging from the void, clad in brilliant霞衣.</p><p>She breathed heavily, her face flushed, visibly strained. She needed to stabilize herself before pursuing Qin Sang.</p><p>Seeing the three-colored escaping light around Qin Sang, a flicker of surprise crossed Nine-Phoenix King's eyes.</p><p>This person's escape technique far surpassed that of ordinary Core Formation cultivators.  Since she had to focus on controlling the True Feather, catching him would require some effort.</p><p>After a moment's thought, Nine-Phoenix King formulated a strategy, transforming into a red light and giving chase.</p><p>'Whoosh whoosh!'</p><p>The two chased and fled through the stone forest, their escaping lights tearing through the rocks, causing widespread collapse.</p><p>Several times Qin Sang attempted to flee towards Yitian Peak, but Nine-Phoenix King intercepted and prevented him each time.</p><p>Her intentions were clear: to force him out of the Spirit-镇压 Realm.</p><p>The Star Conch had already been used, and Nine-Phoenix King wouldn't give him a chance to use the Lightning Control technique.  Relying only on his nine demonic banners, Qin Sang dared not stop to fight her.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>Nine-Phoenix King attacked, a large expanse of shimmering light transforming into a phoenix that slammed into him.</p><p>The phoenix was composed of countless tiny feathers, each imbued with incredibly violent power. It easily plowed a path through the stone forest, pulverizing the stone trees into dust along the way.</p><p>Qin Sang felt a wave of intense heat, his whole body aching, as if he were about to be burned to ashes.</p><p>There was still a clear gap between him and a true transformed demon cultivator!</p>
