<h1>Chapter 510: Selling Corpses</h1><p>Several months had passed in Green Sun City.</p><p>During this time, Qin Sang was not idle. He frequented various auction houses, primarily focused on three things.</p><p>First, he organized the treasures in his Mustard Seed Bag, selling off unsuitable artifacts and replacing them with more practical ones, striving to enhance his strength.</p><p>Second, he gathered various medicinal pills to treat corpse transformation.</p><p>Wu Shang had once taken a desperate gamble, transforming himself into a living corpse without hesitation. He lacked the secret method to counteract the Heavenly Corpse Talisman and cared little about the changes to his physical body, only seeking Core Formation.</p><p>Qin Sang, with the Jade Buddha's protection, had resolved the greatest danger of this secret method. He now sought to mitigate the remaining risks, preventing himself from truly becoming a living corpse.</p><p>The foremost of these risks was the physical body's corpse transformation.</p><p>Before refining the Golden Elixir into his body, he first needed to transform himself into a living corpse.</p><p>According to Wu Shang's plan, with the protection of the Dry Heaven罡 Qi, this process would prevent corpse transformation.</p><p>However, before that, when transforming into a living corpse, he would need to introduce Earthly Yin Qi into his body. From this point onward, his physical body would be impacted by the Earthly Yin Qi, leading to severe corpse transformation.</p><p>This type of corpse transformation could be cured in a short period. If left untreated for too long, there would be no hope of recovery unless he abandoned his physical body.</p><p>Wu Shang had meticulously listed the medicinal pills with such curative effects. They were not particularly rare, and Qin Sang, now quite wealthy, spared no expense in acquiring a substantial supply.</p><p>Third, he searched for two spiritual objects: the Myriad Year Camphor and the Sky Capital Rock.</p><p>These were the two missing components needed to refine the Primordial Concentric Rings.</p><p>The Myriad Year Camphor, though sounding like a type of spiritual wood, was actually a jade treasure. It was said that a peculiar type of spiritual jade could grow like a living thing. After ten thousand years of gestation, it would grow into a small jade tree, resembling a camphor tree.</p><p>This fully formed jade camphor tree was called the Myriad Year Camphor.</p><p>The name "Myriad Year" might be an exaggeration, a common practice that also hinted at the Myriad Year Camphor's value.</p><p>The Sky Capital Rock was a rare spiritual rock, slightly less valuable than the Myriad Year Camphor but still difficult to find.</p><p>Elder Di Que had possessed the Primordial Concentric Rings for a long time but had been unable to refine them due to the lack of these two spiritual objects. He had already gathered all the other necessary materials.</p><p>Qin Sang was only one step away from Core Formation. Although this step was like a vast chasm, difficult to cross, it did not prevent him from gathering information about these two spiritual objects in advance.</p><p>If he could restore the Primordial Concentric Rings, after Core Formation, he would have three different magical treasures at his disposal, surpassing even some established Core Formation cultivators.</p><p>Unfortunately, the Myriad Year Camphor and Sky Capital Rock were truly rare and had never been seen.</p><p>In addition to these, Qin Sang did not forget to search for spiritual objects that aided Core Formation.</p><p>Although precious, these objects often appeared at major auctions, usually as the grand finale. However, the best quality among them was only slightly better than the Kan Li Golden Elixir, most being inferior.</p><p>They were useless to Qin Sang.</p><p>[Collect free good books] Follow v x [Book Friends Base Camp] Recommend your favorite novels and receive cash red envelopes!</p><p>The Snow Spirit Lotus, Iris Flower, and even the slightly lesser Xuanzhen Elixir had never appeared.</p><p>Thinking about it this way, Qin Sang was quite fortunate to have obtained a pair. He could only blame his insufficient talent.</p><p>…</p><p>Outside Green Sun City.</p><p>Wearing a wooden mask and a Daoist robe, Qin Sang abruptly left his cave dwelling and flew towards an unnamed desolate mountain.</p><p>Arriving at the foot of the mountain, he saw Yun Youzi standing at the summit.</p><p>“I have troubled Senior these past months, keeping you at Sky Seclusion Pass.”</p><p>Qin Sang landed, cupping his hands, his tone apologetic.</p><p>He hadn't expected the Green Sun Demonic Sect's leader to be so patient. So many treasures had appeared at auction, yet none had lured him away from the sect, even with the Violet Firmament Palace opening in just over two years.</p><p>If the Green Sun Demonic Sect's leader waited until the Violet Firmament Palace opened to depart, Qin Sang would be left with no choice but to make a risky attempt with less than a 10% chance of success.</p><p>“Mutual assistance is our duty.”</p><p>Yun Youzi shook his head. “Besides, this old man didn't come in vain. I've gathered almost everything I need for the Violet Firmament Palace at Sky Seclusion Pass. Now I just wait for it to open.”</p><p>Qin Sang's tone relaxed slightly. “That’s good! Senior called me here, did you receive some news?”</p><p>Yun Youzi nodded and waved his hand, casting a simple restriction. “My sect's Sky Seclusion Pass branch also operates a Taiyi Elixir Pavilion, connected to various demonic sects. While I was there, I heard that in three months, the demonic sect's Holy Monarch, Tong You, will personally host an auction at Sky Seclusion Pass. Not only Nascent Soul demonic cultivators but also the leaders of major demonic sects will attend. The Green Sun Demonic Sect's leader is a late Core Formation cultivator. Coupled with the sect's history, he is also invited. I have already arranged for someone to keep watch… Didn't Brother Qin say your plan needed some time to prepare? You can begin now!”</p><p>“Tong You, is that the demonic sect's Holy Monarch whose fame rivals Redhair Patriarch, the Pure Yang Sect's leader?”</p><p>Seeing Yun Youzi nod slightly, Qin Sang was overjoyed.</p><p>Tong You's demonic might was immense. Rumored to be the strongest demonic cultivator, second only to Redhair Patriarch, an auction personally hosted by him would surely be filled with countless treasures. Those invited would certainly not refuse.</p><p>Qin Sang then learned that not only the demonic sects, but the righteous path was also holding a similar auction in Pure罡 City, hosted by Redhair Patriarch.</p><p>These auctions were customary. All factions were preparing for the upcoming Violet Firmament Palace, exchanging goods and strengthening themselves, aiming to survive within the palace and obtain more treasures.</p><p>It was said that after these two auctions, there would even be a trading conference exclusively for Nascent Soul Grandmasters, with participants from beyond the Small Cold Region.</p><p>For Qin Sang, this was excellent news. Moreover, with the Small Cold Region's experts gathered at the two major passes, the Green Sun Demonic Sect wouldn't need to worry about attacks on their sect and wouldn't be so overly cautious.</p><p>Qin Sang made up his mind and, together with Yun Youzi, headed straight for Green Sun Market.</p><p>…</p><p>Arriving at Green Sun Market as quickly as possible.</p><p>Qin Sang calculated the time, changed his appearance, entered the market, and began his plan.</p><p>Having already familiarized himself with the various factions within Green Sun Market and their relationships, Qin Sang, after contacting each one, chose a merchant house named Treasure Pavilion. He took out two corpses and entrusted them with the auction.</p><p>Three days later.</p><p>The two corpses were successfully sold.</p><p>They were only two low-level corpses, quite common in demonic territories. Besides being noticed by a few discerning individuals, they didn't cause much of a stir.</p><p>But soon, two more corpses appeared in Green Sun Market.</p><p>This time, more people noticed, particularly Qi Refining cultivators, including disciples of the Green Sun Demonic Sect.</p><p>Furthermore, some Foundation Establishment cultivators also began to pay attention.</p><p>Clearly, a cultivator skilled in corpse refinement was selling corpses in the market. These corpses might be a lure; perhaps this person possessed a Fiend Corpse!</p>
