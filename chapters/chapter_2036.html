<h1>Chapter 2027:  A World Within a Seed</h1><p>Pei Gongfeng ultimately decided to go hunting for Yuling with Young Master Xin, but left behind a Nascent Soul-stage spirit beast and a Xin family cultivator, ostensibly to protect Qin Sang.</p><p>The spirit beast, a Huāli Leopard, was not some divine beast or rare species.  Logically, it should have already been able to transform into human form.  For some unknown reason, however, it either couldn't or refused, remaining in its beast form—a leopard several times larger than normal.</p><p>Qin Sang understood Pei Gongfeng’s true intentions in leaving the Huāli Leopard behind; he was curious how confident Pei Gongfeng was to think a Nascent Soul-stage spirit beast could monitor him.</p><p>After Pei Gongfeng and the others left, Qin Sang immediately ordered the Huāli Leopard and the Xin family cultivator to guard opposite ends of the canyon.</p><p>The Huāli Leopard leaped to the canyon entrance, patrolling like a beast surveying its territory, occasionally glancing into the canyon.  It saw Qin Sang strolling to the spring, circling the woods, carefully inspecting the spirit tree.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang suddenly waved his sleeve, sending several streams of light flying out, transforming into spirit flags planted around the trees, forming a flag array. Mist filled the array, obscuring the interior.</p><p>The Huāli Leopard's eyes widened. It quickly jumped to the edge of the woods and growled, "Elder Qin, what are you doing setting up this formation?"</p><p>"Hm?"</p><p>Qin Sang looked over, his gaze sharp and unforgiving.  He sharply rebuked, "I'm here at the invitation of the Xin family.  Do I need to report my actions to a beast like you?"</p><p>A flicker of anger crossed the Huāli Leopard's eyes, but it dared not show it, quickly bowing its head. "I wouldn't dare. My duty is to protect Elder Qin, to ensure you're not in danger and I can react in time."</p><p>"What danger could I possibly face refining artifacts in this valley?"</p><p>Qin Sang narrowed his eyes, a cold gleam flashing. "I'm using a unique secret technique to refine these spirit trees.  This process can't be disturbed.  Are you planning to steal my secret technique?"</p><p>The Huāli Leopard's fur stood on end.  Terrified, it repeatedly professed its innocence, hastily retreating to the canyon mouth.  Watching the canyon sealed by mist, it sighed helplessly.</p><p>Within the mist, Qin Sang stared at the spirit tree, lost in thought.</p><p>The spirit tree was indeed withering, but not as severely as Qin Sang had claimed.  He had deliberately exaggerated the situation to create an opportunity to be alone, unexpectedly succeeding in sending Young Master Xin and Pei Gongfeng away.</p><p>Qin Sang easily deceived the two Nascent Soul cultivators outside and slipped away unnoticed. Young Master Xin certainly wouldn't expect him to find another way, enabling travel through the formation without the need for the boat.</p><p>"Should I go now?"</p><p>Qin Sang focused his senses on the Qianjun Ring. The connection was becoming clearer, seemingly not far away.</p><p>He mentally calculated whether he could return to the canyon and refine the boat before Young Master Xin and the others returned.</p><p>He wasn't planning to leave completely. First, he had made a promise to the Xin family. Second, he didn't know what lay ahead; the Qianjun Ring might only be connected to part of the secret here. Young Master Xin surely held information he didn't know, and he might need the Xin family's help later.</p><p>An opportunity!</p><p>After careful calculation, Qin Sang deemed it feasible.  He certainly had time for a quick look, and could improvise from there.</p><p>Making his decision, Qin Sang used a Chongxuan Sect secret technique on the spirit tree, slowing its withering.  He then concealed his presence and silently moved towards the edge of the mist, passing the Xin family cultivator who remained oblivious.</p><p>Leaving the canyon, Qin Sang held the Qianjun Ring before him.  He saw a dark light fluctuating on its surface. The ring had followed him for over a thousand years, and he'd never seen this before.</p><p>The Qianjun Ring now looked unfamiliar, like an ancient artifact unearthed from the earth, emerging from years of dormancy to reveal its brilliance.</p><p>"Just how many treasures does the Ziwei Palace hold...?"</p><p>Qin Sang sighed, once again lamenting the sacrifice of the Ziwei Palace for the Dishasha Sword.</p><p>The unsealed Qianjun Ring guided Qin Sang with vibrations, along a winding path between numerous islands.  Mid-flight, Qin Sang paused, sensing a familiar aura.</p><p>Another Yuling!</p><p>Since he encountered it, he might as well take it. Qin Sang drew his sword and slashed at the void, forcing the Yuling out with a single strike.</p><p>Sword energy filled the air.  The Yuling had nowhere to escape and eventually dissipated, leaving behind a jade shard slightly larger than the previous one.</p><p>Qin Sang held the shard, examining it while continuing on his way.</p><p>Perhaps the ferry was incomplete, or perhaps he lacked sufficient jade fragments;  he found no guidance and put them away.  He drew closer to his target, still within the formation, but the surrounding scene subtly changed.  The islands thinned, the area grew increasingly empty, darkness enveloped him, and Qin Sang felt he was heading towards an abyss in the void.  He felt disoriented, as if up, down, left, and right no longer existed.</p><p>Passing another island, he found empty void ahead.  Not far after flying, a shadow appeared before him.  Qin Sang's heart stirred; the shadow wasn't an island, but resembled a fissure in the void, stretching across the sea above. The sight was familiar, reminding him of the fragments of small thousand worlds within the Fengju Jade Gate.</p><p>Approaching the "fissure," the Qianjun Ring vibrated violently. Qin Sang was certain: whatever was resonating with the ring was here!  Grey mist filled the fissure.  Qin Sang used his spiritual sight, gazing intently. His vision seemed to pierce the void fissure, vaguely revealing the scene within.</p><p>It was an island, a landmass floating in mid-air.  Unlike the outside, the island was lush with green trees and abundant flowers and plants; clear springs flowed.  Except for the absence of birds, beasts, and fish, it was vibrant and teeming with life.</p><p>The island was roughly tens of miles across, with several undulating peaks. The mountains weren't steep but possessed a delicate, spiritual beauty.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang's pupils constricted. He saw artificial structures on the highest mountain – a tall altar on the summit, with several closed pavilions and halls nearby.  The altar's design didn't seem human, nor was it entirely like the outside's Wu tribe altars; it was ancient and mystical.</p><p>The mountain was deserted; the entire island showed no signs of life, seemingly silent for countless years.</p><p>"Could the thing attracting the Qianjun Ring be on the altar, or in one of the halls?"</p><p>After a moment's thought, Qin Sang, confirming there was no immediate danger, tentatively entered the grey mist, passed through the fissure, and softly landed on the island.</p><p>The Huiying Sword hung above Qin Sang's head, its blade flickering, ready to strike should danger approach.  The surroundings were utterly quiet. Qin Sang took a deep breath. If this was another fragment of a small thousand world, the spiritual energy must be incredibly abundant.</p><p>Glancing around, just as Qin Sang was about to head towards the highest peak, the Qianjun Ring suddenly shuddered and slipped from his hand.</p><p>What followed completely exceeded Qin Sang's expectations.  Even his resolute mind felt immense shock and disbelief; he could only stare wide-eyed!</p><p>The Qianjun Ring slowly rose, transforming into a mass of dark light, soaring above the highest peak.  The dark light hung in the air, and Qin Sang immediately felt a violent surge in the soul imprint he'd left within the ring, as if it were about to be torn apart.</p><p>Then, an image projected from the dark light.</p><p>The image showed a small space, filled with various objects – the items Qin Sang had stored in the Qianjun Ring.</p><p>Most were spirit stones.</p><p>A pile of high-grade spirit stones lay haphazardly in a corner like ordinary rocks.  Qin Sang had already discarded the mid-grade and low-grade ones due to space constraints.</p><p>Spiritual herbs and treasures, jade slips and ancient books, treasure chests and pill bottles, magical artifacts and spiritual treasures…</p><p>Piece after piece of treasure, enough to make even a Nascent Soul cultivator gasp, were neatly arranged and categorized.</p><p>The void was like a mirror, reflecting these treasures.</p><p>No!</p><p>It wasn't just reflection!</p><p>That space seemed to be materializing from the Qianjun Ring.</p><p>Qin Sang's face changed drastically.  Without thinking, he rapidly flicked his fingers, hurriedly taking out the items.</p><p>The change was swift.  Just as Qin Sang finished retrieving the items, the space truly materialized.  Simultaneously, Qin Sang felt the ground beneath his feet and the entire void tremble.</p><p>As the space materialized, dark light filled the air, and the Qianjun Ring's form grew increasingly faint, appearing and disappearing.</p><p>An invisible wave emanated, spreading through the void, while the void responded with an identical wave.  They seemed to be of the same origin, as if originally one, now finally reunited, merging again.</p><p>Vaguely, Qin Sang seemed to understand something, yet he couldn't be sure. If his guess was correct, it was too shocking, exceeding his comprehension.</p><p>Qin Sang, his heart full of suspicion and uncertainty, felt the surrounding fluctuations growing more violent, the void threatening to tear apart.  Fearing danger, he took one last deep look at the Qianjun Ring and flew back the way he came.</p><p>Exiting the fissure, Qin Sang continued to stare intently into its depths.  Dark energy swirled, obscuring the peaks, altars, and palaces, ultimately sealing the fissure shut.  The Qianjun Ring was no longer visible.</p><p>As Qin Sang hesitated about what action to take, a violent tremor shook him.  His vision was instantly filled with the same dark energy.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The dark energy erupted from the fissure, incredibly dense.  Yet, through it, Qin Sang glimpsed an extraordinary, distorted scene: the same void-like landscape he had seen before, but now it appeared as if the land itself had melted into water.</p><p>Like water, it adapted to its surroundings, its form changing without being destroyed.  Perhaps the void wasn't actually distorted; the strange appearance was merely an effect of some unknown transformation. The rest was beyond his understanding; his vision was limited, so he 'couldn't see' it all.</p><p>He saw the dark energy, like water, surging outwards, expanding to its limit before encountering some powerful restraining force, causing it to abruptly recede.  The void-like land within expanded and contracted in rhythm with the energy's ebb and flow.</p><p>The changes were too fast, too intense for Qin Sang to fully grasp the details.</p><p>‘Hum…hum…’</p><p>The Qianjun Ring reappeared, its ring trembling slightly. The dark energy finally contracted to a thin stream before being absorbed into the ring.</p><p>The next moment, the fissure, the land within, and the ring's own space vanished from Qin Sang's sight.  The ocean surface was empty, save for a single obsidian ring.</p><p>The Qianjun Ring's appearance remained unchanged, but it possessed a different aura. It vibrated a few times before quieting down, its glow fading as it fell towards the sea.</p><p>Qin Sang quickly retrieved it, extending a thread of spiritual energy to tentatively envelop the ring. He discovered his soul imprint was almost completely erased, but thankfully still intact. He easily restored it.</p><p>Then, his spiritual sense penetrated the ring, revealing a space countless times larger than before.</p><p>Land, mountains, palaces, high platforms, plants, streams…</p><p>It was the very void-like landscape from within the fissure, now 'absorbed' into the Qianjun Ring.  The ring's original space was gone, merged with this vast expanse.</p><p>The interior of the Qianjun Ring was now a real world.</p><p>No, it *was* a real world!</p><p>With a thought, Qin Sang materialized within this space. Spiritual energy surrounded him, the fragrance of plants filling his nostrils – entirely real!</p><p>A Lesser World, or perhaps a fragment of one, refined into a container-type artifact. Or maybe a Lesser World's marker refined into an artifact!</p><p>For some reason, this Lesser World had fragmented and now reunited.</p><p>To contain a world within an artifact!</p><p>Even if only a fragment, it was a power Qin Sang couldn't fathom.</p><p>He'd thought the Dao Court's creation of a separate realm from the Greater World was astonishing. Now, it seemed even Mahayana cultivators could manipulate Lesser Worlds as playthings?</p><p>What kind of power was this?</p><p>Nascent Soul? Mahayana?</p><p>Nascent Soul cultivators control domains, but a domain and a world are likely entirely different concepts. The gap between him and the top cultivators was far greater than he imagined, a strength he couldn't comprehend, even having a rudimentary understanding of sword domains!</p><p>The Qianjun Ring containing a Lesser World accounted for its power unmatched by other container artifacts; it could hold the bone flute.</p><p>The Qianjun Ring was this Lesser World's marker, its gate. Possessing the ring meant carrying this gate, allowing entry and exit at will.  And now, as its master, he was the master of this Lesser World.</p><p>Though unsure of what this meant for him, it was certainly a momentous opportunity!</p><p>Qin Sang took a deep breath, calming himself, preparing to thoroughly explore this world when he felt his body tense and the void tremble abnormally.</p><p>‘Rumble… rumble!’</p><p>Heaven and earth were in chaos, a sign of destruction!</p><p>"Not good!"</p><p>Qin Sang recoiled in alarm, noticing the Qianjun Ring gradually stabilizing after he left. He finally exhaled, relieved.</p><p>"It must be unstable from being fragmented for so long, just now reuniting.  Even as the ring's master, I can't freely enter and exit; others certainly couldn't. I wonder what the Qianjun Ring's limits are, and if it's related to my cultivation. It seems using this world won't be easy…"</p><p>His attention captivated by the Qianjun Ring, Qin Sang pondered, then his expression shifted. He belatedly realized the tremors hadn’t stopped; they were transmitting to the outside world.</p>
