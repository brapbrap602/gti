<h1>Chapter 1747: The White Dragon Lord</h1><p>Waves crashed against the rocks, sending up white foam. A towering cliff stood like an unyielding wall, holding back the sea, defying even the fiercest storms.</p><p>"A perilous land of treacherous mountains and waters..."</p><p>Qin Sang muttered to himself as he reached the summit of the cliff, gazing ahead. He had crossed the sea with little effort, finding the land that the Heavenly Eye Butterfly had once glimpsed. The view from afar and up close was vastly different.</p><p>From this vantage point, he could see a vast expanse of towering peaks, stretching endlessly, their steep slopes shrouded in mist. The rugged terrain was no less formidable than the wilds of the Southern Barbarian Provinces in the Central Continent.</p><p>"This place is likely teeming with spirits and demons, unfit for mortal life. I wonder if the people here are as frail as those in the Storm Realm..."</p><p>Uncertain of what lay ahead, Qin Sang deliberately suppressed his aura, restraining his true essence and avoiding the use of his divine sense. He refrained from awakening the Heavenly Eye Butterfly to observe the mountain's energy.</p><p>Before gaining sentience, most spirits and demons relied on instinct, with only a few mastering the art of concealing their presence. Among demonic creatures, strength was revered, and the more powerful they were, the more they flaunted their energy. By observing the mist and clouds over the mountains, one could often gauge the presence of such beings.</p><p>However, what Qin Sang saw surprised him greatly. Despite the mist and clouds, the atmosphere was unusually clear, with no trace of demonic energy. This was starkly different from the demon-infested island he had lived on for over a decade, where even a small patch of forest housed hundreds of spirits. The contrast was striking.</p><p>This could mean one of two things: either a powerful demon lord ruled the area, forcing other demons to flee, or there were demon-slaying cultivators who had purified the land.</p><p>The Heavenly Eye Butterfly's vision was exceptional, allowing Qin Sang to see far into the distance. The mountains stretched endlessly, with no end in sight. After a brief pause, Qin Sang leaped down from the cliff, moving like a tiger as he silently navigated the dense forest below.</p><p>He moved swiftly, his figure ghostly and his aura even fainter than before, relying solely on his physical strength. The Heavenly Eye Butterfly perched on his left shoulder, vigilant for any signs of powerful demons.</p><p>After traversing dozens of mountains without encountering any demons or signs of human habitation, Qin Sang couldn't help but frown. The eerie silence of the mountains was unsettling. He paused atop a peak, sniffed the air, and suddenly focused on a spot to his left.</p><p>After a moment of contemplation, he changed direction, heading toward the area. As he approached, he slowed his pace and formed a hand seal. His blood and qi surged slightly, and a faint golden light shimmered across his skin.</p><p>This was the Sixth Seal of the Seven Masters' Buddha Seals—the Golden Armor Seal. Once activated, his skin became as tough as armor, a powerful defensive technique. Having reached the mid-stage of the fourth layer of the "Heavenly Demon Refinement," Qin Sang had gradually mastered this seal.</p><p>The Seventh Seal, the Diamond Freedom Seal, remained elusive, as Qin Sang had only recently broken through and had yet to fully comprehend its intricacies.</p><p>With the seal active, his presence became more imposing. He moved forward and soon saw two large rocks with a narrow gap between them, leading to a hidden valley.</p><p>The valley was nestled between three mountains, their curved walls forming a natural oval-shaped sinkhole. A river flowed into the valley, creating a pool at the bottom.</p><p>As Qin Sang peered into the sinkhole, his pupils contracted slightly. The bottom was littered with countless bones, the water tainted by the decaying remains. The bones were piled in layers, the lower ones submerged in foul, putrid water, while the upper ones were exposed to the sunlight, their white surfaces gleaming.</p><p>It was a grim altar of death.</p><p>Despite the blazing sun overhead, the sinkhole was eerily cold, a stark contrast to the yang energy of the day. Qin Sang summoned a bone fragment with a wave of his hand and examined it.</p><p>"Demonic bones," he murmured.</p><p>Not just this one—the entire sinkhole was filled with the remains of various demons. However, these bones were useless for crafting treasures, as their essence had been drained. Many of the corpses had been gutted, their organs missing.</p><p>Qin Sang now understood why there were no demons roaming the area—they had all been slaughtered.</p><p>Only the remains of demonic beasts were here, as plant spirits, once their spiritual essence was consumed, were indistinguishable from ordinary dead vegetation and didn't need to be discarded here.</p><p>This didn't seem like the work of demon-slaying cultivators but rather a case of demons preying on each other. The perpetrator was clearly intelligent.</p><p>Qin Sang tossed the bone aside and leaped out of the sinkhole, heading deeper into the mountains. He encountered no other demons along the way.</p><p>After traversing countless peaks, the terrain began to level out. Qin Sang ascended to a higher vantage point and scanned the horizon. His gaze settled on a cluster of buildings in the distance.</p><p>He changed direction and sped toward the structures, confirming that it was indeed a city.</p><p>On the way, Qin Sang encountered the first humans of this realm—an old man and a young boy walking along a mountain path. They were ordinary mortals, their appearance no different from the people of the Storm Realm.</p><p>The old man had a long beard and walked with a vigorous stride, exuding vitality. The boy, around twelve or thirteen, carried a book bag and recited some scripture, occasionally asking the old man questions.</p><p>Qin Sang listened for a while and then sent a wisp of his divine sense into the boy's book bag, scanning the contents of the books inside. A look of surprise crossed his face.</p><p>The written language of this realm was remarkably similar to that of the Storm Realm. He could understand the books without needing any special techniques!</p><p>This was unexpected. While it made sense for different regions within the Storm Realm to share a common script, it was unusual for entirely separate minor realms to have the same writing system. Could they share a common origin?</p><p>Qin Sang descended from the clouds, transforming into a wandering Taoist priest. He emerged from the forest, startling the old man and the boy.</p><p>The old man quickly shielded the boy, his expression wary.</p><p>"Greetings, elder," Qin Sang said with a bow, mimicking their speech.</p><p>Seeing that he was a Taoist priest, the old man's wariness faded, and he hurriedly returned the greeting.</p><p>Taoist priests seemed to hold a high status here, Qin Sang noted.</p><p>"I am a wandering priest who has lost my way in the mountains. I am relieved to encounter fellow travelers. May I ask where we are?" Qin Sang inquired.</p><p>The old man grew even more respectful upon hearing that Qin Sang was a wandering priest. "Honored priest, about ten miles ahead is a ferry crossing. From there, you can take a boat to White Dragon Crossing, and then follow the river downstream to Floating Dragon City..."</p><p>Qin Sang glanced back, thinking that while these mortals were more robust than those in the Storm Realm, they were no match for demons. Their survival here suggested that the city was protected by cultivators.</p><p>He considered for a moment and asked, "Where are you two headed? May I accompany you?"</p><p>"Honored priest, a relative of mine in White Dragon Crossing has passed away. We are on our way to attend the funeral..." the old man replied hesitantly, not daring to refuse Qin Sang's request.</p><p>The three of them walked along the dirt path together. The old man was reserved, while the boy was full of curiosity. The old man seemed anxious, fearing that the boy might say something inappropriate and offend the priest.</p><p>Qin Sang used a minor technique to put them at ease, and they soon shared everything they knew.</p><p>From their conversation, Qin Sang learned that this land was called the Nine Dragons Kingdom, with many places bearing the name "dragon." The city ahead was Floating Dragon City.</p><p>As he had suspected, Taoist priests held a revered status in the Nine Dragons Kingdom, supported by the royal family. Even wandering priests were treated with great respect.</p><p>According to the old man, this was the case in neighboring kingdoms as well. Taoist priests could travel freely without official permits, and local officials would personally greet them.</p><p>As they approached the ferry crossing, Qin Sang asked, "Elder, do you not fear the demons in the mountains, living outside the city?"</p><p>Before the old man could answer, the boy chimed in, "We are protected by the City God and the White Dragon Lord! The demons dare not cross the boundary!"</p><p>The boy spoke with reverence when mentioning the City God and the White Dragon Lord.</p><p>Qin Sang had already learned that the City God was a deity enshrined in a temple in Floating Dragon City, while the White Dragon Lord was the river god of the nearby river.</p><p>The Nine Dragons Kingdom revered Taoist priests and deities, with annual rituals honoring the City God and the river god. Even villagers outside the city were required to participate, and failure to do so was punishable by law.</p><p>This was not uncommon in the mortal world of the Storm Realm. However, most deities were fabrications, often used to extort wealth. Even if there were genuine deities protecting the land, they were likely cultivators posing as gods.</p><p>The Nine Dragons Kingdom's reverence for deities was somewhat unique in that the rituals were state-sponsored, and the people were not required to offer valuable tributes. Thus, their worship was sincere.</p><p>Qin Sang mused that while the deities might not be real, there were likely powerful beings who protected the land from demons and spirits. The worship was not entirely baseless.</p><p>Unfortunately, neither the old man nor the boy had personally witnessed any divine miracles, so Qin Sang couldn't determine the true nature of the City God and the White Dragon Lord.</p><p>The old man patted the boy's head and added, "As long as we don't venture deep into the mountains, there's nothing to fear. I've never seen demons enter our village, but those who go into the mountains often disappear without a trace. Our village is close to the mountains, and sometimes we hear strange noises at night. But lately, it's been quiet—perhaps the City God and the White Dragon Lord have sent their celestial soldiers to subdue the demons..."</p><p>If it were truly the work of celestial soldiers, would they so brutally consume the demons' organs and essence?</p><p>They soon reached the ferry crossing. A small boat with a black awning was moored at the wooden dock, already carrying a few villagers. The boatman was about to set off when he saw more passengers arriving and hurriedly called out to them.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang's Taoist attire, the villagers showed reverence, squeezing together to make room for him. The boatman, too, was deferential and refused to accept payment.</p><p>The boat sailed downstream. Qin Sang ignored the others' gazes, deep in thought about his next steps. He had anticipated various scenarios, even suspecting that this might be a demon realm devoid of humans. He had never expected to find a human settlement.</p><p>Where there were humans, there would be cultivators. There had to be a way forward.</p><p>"First, I'll visit the city and see who this White Dragon Lord and City God really are," Qin Sang thought.</p><p>As the boat rounded a bend in the river, the White Dragon Crossing came into view. Qin Sang was about to move to the bow for a closer look when the Heavenly Eye Butterfly on his shoulder fluttered its wings.</p><p>His eyes flickered, and he glanced at a solitary peak by the riverbank before turning his attention back to the White Dragon Crossing, remaining seated.</p><p>The river was calm, and the boat moved swiftly. They soon arrived at the crossing. Qin Sang disembarked with the old man and the boy, blending in with the crowd.</p><p>As they stepped onto the dock, the sound of gongs and drums echoed in the distance. A procession approached, led by a Taoist priest in light yellow robes, holding a demon-subduing staff in one hand and a golden bell in the other.</p><p>Behind the priest were two rows of attendants. The front row carried offerings of livestock and fruits, as well as spirit banners. The second row held official insignias, followed by pairs of large gongs and a group of musicians.</p><p>Behind the musicians, a black-canopied soul-summoning sedan chair was carried, accompanied by paper lanterns, incense burners, and flower stands, all adorned with elaborate embroidered umbrellas. The procession was a riot of color and splendor.</p><p>Further back was a coffin, carried by thirty-two pallbearers. A long line of mourners in white followed, wailing and weeping. Paper effigies of people and horses were also carried, outnumbering the mourners.</p><p>The Taoist priest chanted scriptures, his movements rhythmic and exaggerated, almost comical to an outsider.</p><p>The cacophony of drums, gongs, and bells filled the air as the procession made its way to the riverside.</p><p>Seeing the procession, the old man exclaimed, "Why is it so early today?" He grabbed the boy and hurried forward.</p><p>At that moment, Qin Sang glanced at the coffin and suddenly reached out to stop them. "I would like to treat you to a meal as thanks for guiding me. I hope you won't refuse."</p><p>The old man and the boy, who had been eager to attend the funeral, seemed to lose their urgency and followed Qin Sang into a nearby tavern, their expressions calm.</p><p>Qin Sang ordered some food. The old man and the boy ate heartily, seemingly forgetting their original purpose.</p><p>Qin Sang held a cup of wine, his gaze fixed on the window. From there, he could see the Taoist priest leading the procession along the riverside road until they stopped in front of a stone shrine.</p><p>The shrine was only half a person's height, with no statue inside—only a spirit tablet, presumably that of the White Dragon Lord.</p><p>The priest arranged the offerings and set up the spirit banners, then stood before the altar, performing a ritual dance and chanting scriptures.</p><p>The drums and gongs fell silent, and the mourners stopped wailing. Only the sound of the bell echoed across the river.</p><p>Qin Sang understood the priest's chant—he was performing a ritual to guide the deceased's soul, inviting the White Dragon Lord to witness the ceremony and absolve the dead of their sins.</p><p>The priest's performance was meticulous and fluid, enough to impress the mortals.</p><p>However, after a long while, Qin Sang sensed no unusual energy from the river or the shrine.</p><p>Suddenly, there was a commotion in the procession.</p><p>The priest turned, his expression displeased, but before he could reprimand anyone, a series of loud knocks came from the coffin.</p><p>*Crack!*</p><p>A nail securing the coffin lid flew off.</p><p>The priest's face turned pale. He grabbed his robes and fled, while the others screamed in terror, "It's risen! The corpse has risen!"</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The coffin exploded.</p><p>Wooden shards flew everywhere as a dark figure burst out, lunging at the nearest person. It resembled a human, but its face was covered in green fur.</p><p>Chaos erupted at White Dragon Crossing.</p><p>At that moment, Qin Sang's arm, holding the wine cup, paused. His gaze, which had been scanning the solitary peak and a grassy area beyond the crossing, suddenly focused on the shrine's spirit tablet.</p><p></p>
