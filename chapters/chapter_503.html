<h1>Chapter 496: Removing the Gu</h1><p>After eliminating the Daoist in the crow robe, Qin Sang immediately returned, as the condition of the Flying Night Rakshasa was worsening. The cracks in its Corpse Pill were not healing and were spreading.</p><p>The earth-slayer energy he'd collected in the Shao Yin magnetic bottle was a drop in the bucket; he had to return to the Earth-Sinking Cave as soon as possible.</p><p>With the Daoist in the crow robe and the Four Demon Flame Envoys dead, the Demon Flame Sect was effectively defunct, though some remnants of the Kui Yin Sect remained. Qin Sang had planned to raid the sect's mountain gate, but there wasn't time.</p><p>He returned to the Earth-Sinking Cave with utmost speed.</p><p>Qin Sang summoned the Flying Night Rakshasa.</p><p>Its breath was ragged. While its external wounds had healed, its body was shriveled, nearing desiccation.  The wound on its dantian hadn't fully closed; wisps of corpse energy constantly leaked, its energy sea was almost depleted, and its Corpse Pill was pale and severely cracked.</p><p>Considering the Daoist in the crow robe couldn't unleash his full power as a Nascent Soul cultivator, and the Flying Night Rakshasa wasn't a true one, the outcome was quite good. Qin Sang had prepared himself for the possibility of the Rakshasa being severely crippled.</p><p>"I made it back just in time."</p><p>Qin Sang carefully scanned the Rakshasa with his spiritual sense, confirming its injuries weren't irreversible, before finally letting out a sigh of relief.</p><p>After placing several restrictions on the Rakshasa to seal its energy, Qin Sang controlled it and plunged it into the earth-slayer energy.</p><p>Nascent Soul cultivators from Mount Shao Hua wouldn't usually visit such a barren place, but to prevent accidents, Qin Sang had the Rakshasa dive as deep as it could bear.  </p><p>Once it reached its limit, Qin Sang found a rocky protrusion and had the Rakshasa sit there, bathing in the earth-slayer energy to heal.</p><p>Recovery depended on the Rakshasa absorbing and nurturing itself with the earth-slayer energy.  There wasn't much Qin Sang could do.</p><p>This wouldn't be a short process, and Qin Sang couldn't stay there the entire time.  He wasn't entirely reassured, so he remained in the Earth-Sinking Cave for three days, observing whether the Rakshasa could withstand the earth-slayer energy.</p><p>During those three days, Qin Sang did something else: he removed the heart-eating insect gu from his soul.</p><p>He'd known the method for a long time, but while the Daoist in the crow robe and others were still alive, he'd kept the gu, thinking it might be useful.  Now, with only insignificant Kui Yin Sect remnants left, he didn't need such a powerful tool.</p><p>This heart-eating insect gu had been with Qin Sang for decades, ever since he left the Kui Yin Sect.  It had started as a poisonous needle, making him constantly anxious, and later became bait to lure and kill Kui Yin Sect remnants, witnessing his growth.</p><p>Even though he was no longer afraid of the gu, after its removal, Qin Sang felt an immense sense of relief. He'd gotten rid of not only the poisonous gu but also the dark memories of his time in the Kui Yin Sect.</p><p>The heart-eating insect, freed from Qin Sang's soul, flew out of his spiritual space, instantly losing its activity. Its worm-like body stiffened, floating before him.  Two fangs protruded from its mouthparts, gleaming coldly, appearing ferocious and eerie.</p><p>Then, the insect began to disintegrate from the head, finally turning into dust.  It was originally a corpse, manipulated by poisonous gu techniques, refined into a gu insect. Each heart-eating insect corpse could only withstand the poisonous gu technique once; once the technique was broken, it vanished completely.</p><p>Three days later.</p><p>The Flying Night Rakshasa was unharmed.</p><p>Qin Sang left the Earth-Sinking Cave alone, intending to find a place to prepare for his Nascent Soul cultivation.</p><p>He didn't return to his sect, nor did he go back to Dragon View Temple. The Snow Spirit Lotus and Iris Flower were too important, and he didn't trust his fellow disciples. He planned to reveal himself only after refining the spirit herbs.</p><p>The best place for secluded cultivation was the spirit spring cave where the Nine Illusion Sky Orchid was cultivated.</p><p>To maintain the cave's secrecy, Qin Sang hadn't opened it since returning from Yin Mountain Pass.</p><p>The sky was clear.</p><p>Qin Sang traveled through the clouds, but didn't go straight to the cave. Instead, he made a detour, landing on a deserted island – the one where they'd assembled before going to the Heavenly Corpse Cave.</p><p>The island remained unchanged.</p><p>The birds' nest was long abandoned.</p><p>Of the eight people, only Qin Sang was left.</p><p>When leaving the Chaotic Island waters, Qin Sang had left a message for Li Yu Fu, saying that if there was news of Yun Youzi, he should leave a message token on this island.</p><p>He still has the Ziwei secrets.  The opening of the Ziwei Palace is imminent; if Yunyouzi doesn't need them, it's best to sell them quickly.</p><p>For many years, Yunyouzi had been missing. Qin Sang had given up hope, but unexpectedly, upon landing on the island, she discovered a spirit array.</p><p>The spirit array was intricately designed, serving no other purpose than to seal a deliberately left blood essence. Qin Sang was certain it was left by Yunyouzi.</p><p>Yunyouzi is back?</p><p>Qin Sang's heart leaped with joy.  Touching the spirit array, she watched as the blood essence exploded with a loud "bang."</p><p>After waiting for a while, Qin Sang stealthily hid herself.</p><p>She trusted Yunyouzi implicitly, but she was wary of him encountering an accident or being exploited.</p><p>Soon, two familiar lights appeared in the sky.</p><p>One was Li Yu Fu.</p><p>The other was the unique radiance of the Immaculate Pearl!</p><p>"Greetings, Master Uncle!"</p><p>Li Yu Fu greeted Qin Sang. He was still at the early Foundation Establishment stage, but years of training alongside Qin Sang on the battlefield had changed his demeanor considerably.</p><p>"Qin!"</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang, Yunyouzi landed his flying craft and strode towards her, laughing heartily, "I saw your message with Yu Fu and brought him here. I've been waiting for you."</p><p>Qin Sang apologized, "I've been busy with a matter lately…"</p><p>"No worries, I knew you must have important business.  I haven't been idle either—I've been looking for an old friend and guiding Yu Fu in his cultivation…"</p><p>Yunyouzi waved his hand, signaling Li Yu Fu to stand guard outside.  He studied Qin Sang, and said gravely, "You're still at the False Core stage, haven't you tried to form your Core?"</p><p>Qin Sang shook her head, "Core formation is a difficult hurdle; I don't have the confidence."</p><p>"Unfortunately, I can't help with Core formation."</p><p>Yunyouzi sighed softly, encouraging Qin Sang, "You obtained the Snow Spirit Lotus and Iris Flower. These two are the most effective Core-formation aids currently found in Xiao Han region. You'll certainly succeed!"</p><p>Qin Sang knew that news of her obtaining the Snow Spirit Lotus and Iris Flower must have spread throughout Xiao Han region; it wasn't surprising that Yunyouzi knew.</p><p>Speaking of Core formation, Qin Sang hurriedly asked Yunyouzi, "Senior, you've spent these years searching for rare treasures. Has your soul injury healed?  I recently obtained two Ziwei secrets; does the Senior still need them?"</p><p>Saying this, Qin Sang took out the two Ziwei secrets to show Yunyouzi.</p><p>"Ziwei secrets? So many!"</p><p>Yunyouzi was astonished, then unceremoniously took one and put it away.</p><p>"Haha… Of course! Thank you for your trouble, Qin! If I hadn't brought you this good news, I wouldn't dare accept this with a clear conscience."</p>
