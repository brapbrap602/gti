<h1>Chapter 819 The Chase</h1><p>Luo Daotong was unaware of the larger plot at play.  The enemy had laid a trap, waiting for his master to walk right into it.  He was still waiting for his master's rescue.</p><p>……</p><p>Qin Sang sensed the presence of mysterious individuals lurking on Liangqiu Island. Not daring to linger for even a moment, he immediately decided to leave this place of turmoil. Compared to his own safety, Luo Daotong's fate had to take a backseat.</p><p>He was filled with uncertainty, wondering what other forces, besides himself, were targeting Luo Daotong and the Nascent Soul ancestor backing him, and for what reason.</p><p>The enemy's power was terrifying. He had planned to capture and kill Luo Daotong to ascertain the forces behind him, but the ambush they laid was clearly aimed directly at the Nascent Soul cultivator.</p><p>"If I had just half a month more, I could have found a way to break the formation and kill Luo Daotong. But someone had to interfere at this very moment.  Luo Daotong sure has a lot of enemies," Qin Sang thought, both exasperated and amused.</p><p>Two groups had coincidentally stumbled upon each other.</p><p>Under these circumstances, he even felt that Nandao Island was unsafe.  Moreover, there was no point in staying there any longer, so he decided against returning.</p><p>Luo Daotong was doomed.  Whether the Nascent Soul cultivator behind him lived or died, the impact on the current situation would be significant. Quheng Island would surely be thrown into chaos, and their identities would eventually be exposed.</p><p>He initially only wanted to know who was backing Luo Daotong, but now he could achieve his goal effortlessly.  There was no need to get involved in other conflicts.</p><p>He quickly fled.</p><p>But before long, he sensed something amiss. He abruptly turned around, only to see an empty sea, shimmering under the starlight, devoid of any presence.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes were sharp as a hawk.  For some reason, a sense of foreboding arose in his heart. He immediately released his Skyeye Butterfly.</p><p>With the Skyeye activated, everything became clear.</p><p>On the sea surface, a cloaked figure was swiftly approaching at an alarming speed.</p><p>The newcomer appeared to be a frail woman, her expression filled with an unnatural madness. The way she looked at Qin Sang was as if she were looking at a delicious piece of meat, sending chills down his spine.</p><p>"A Soul Body!"  Qin Sang's expression turned serious as he saw through the woman's true nature.</p><p>Ghost Dao arts included soul refinement techniques, capable of creating such Soul Bodies.  Unlike refined corpses, they lacked a powerful physical body, but their abilities were even more sinister, capable of killing without a trace.</p><p>In a sense, the Yama King within the Yama Banner was a type of Soul Body.</p><p>Qin Sang's heart tightened. He had been discovered.</p><p>From such a distance, he hadn't even seen her, yet she had detected his presence merely through the 'gaze' of the Skyeye Butterfly. This level of spiritual sense was extraordinary, even among Nascent Soul ancestors.</p><p>The woman was clearly the enemy's refined soul.</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't expected to be exposed so easily.  His hair stood on end.</p><p>The good news was that they had only sent a Soul Body, clearly prioritizing the ambush of the Nascent Soul cultivator.  They hadn't come personally; otherwise, his situation would be far more precarious.  He hadn't yet gotten far from Liangqiu Island. How could he dare to engage the woman?  He immediately used his escape technique, fleeing without looking back.</p><p>He not only used his secret talismans and Sword Qi Thunder Sound, but Qin Sang even activated his Demonic Transformation, wings sprouting from his back, focused solely on escape.</p><p>His mastery of the Demonic Transformation was limited, so the wings' enhancement was marginal, but better than nothing.</p><p>Even so, Qin Sang's instantaneous burst of speed would leave other Core Formation cultivators in the dust. The woman's face showed a flicker of surprise.</p><p>She stared intently at Qin Sang, opening her mouth wide in a silent scream, her long hair whipping wildly, her expression terrifying. Accompanying the scream, her body began to 'melt,' eventually transforming into a mass of pale white light, moving at a speed no slower than Qin Sang's.</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang's face darkened. He hadn't expected the woman to be so relentless. But there was nothing he could do but continue to flee.</p><p>One chased, the other fled. Qin Sang couldn't shake the woman, but she couldn't catch him either.</p><p>Liangqiu Island, within the mist.</p><p>Another small triangular flag materialized, sinking into the sand beneath them.</p><p>In an instant, the entire sandy area seemed to be plated with gold, then vanished just as quickly, returning to normal.</p><p>The two withdrew their hands as the formation disk gradually faded.</p><p>The black-robed figure looked around, filled with satisfaction. "With this formation, capturing Old Devil Yin alive shouldn't be difficult. Unfortunately, it can only be used once; the formation disk will self-destruct.  I heard the Sect Master paid a hefty price to refine this formation disk. I wonder what's so valuable about Old Devil Yin that it's worth such a significant effort."</p><p>"If the Sect Master is doing this, there must be a profound reason. We only need to follow orders. Once Old Devil Yin arrives, I'll hold him off, and you'll control the killing formation..."</p><p>Mid-sentence, the grey-robed figure seemed to sense something, his face revealing surprise. "The Soul Servant hasn't caught that junior yet."</p><p>"How is that possible?" The black-robed figure was incredibly surprised. "The Soul Servant excels in escape techniques and is undoubtedly among the top Core Formation juniors.  Even he can't catch someone?  Even the direct disciples of those old geezers from the nearby sects aren't that capable, are they?"</p><p>The grey-robed figure pondered for a moment. "You keep an eye on things here. I'll go take a look."</p><p>Before he finished speaking, as the grey-robed figure was about to leave, a meteor suddenly streaked across the northern night sky.</p><p>"He's here!"</p><p>Both sensed it and exchanged glances, their expressions becoming serious.</p><p>They no longer cared about Qin Sang. They split up. The black-robed figure silently sank into the depths of the sand, while the grey-robed figure also vanished in a flash, quietly leaving the island.</p><p>……</p><p>Elsewhere, Qin Sang had fled a great distance, Liangqiu Island no longer in sight, but the female Soul Body still pursued him relentlessly.</p><p>Hatred simmered within him, giving rise to murderous intent.</p><p>He had to find a way to eliminate this Soul Body. Otherwise, once they captured or killed the Nascent Soul cultivator backing Luo Daotong, they would be free to deal with him.</p><p>Just then, Qin Sang was startled by a thunderous sword cry.</p><p>He turned around in alarm, only to see a dazzling sword light erupt in the night sky, like an exploding comet, its brilliance even more intense than the strange light on Liangqiu Island.</p><p>Simultaneously, violent waves surged on the sea, and even here, he could faintly feel the intense tremors.</p><p>"The Nascent Soul cultivator has arrived!" Qin Sang's face brightened. They had engaged.</p><p>He wasn't sure of the situation on Liangqiu Island, but judging by the commotion, both sides must have clashed the moment they met. One side had rushed to the rescue, while the other was prepared. The battle likely wouldn't last long, leaving him with little time.</p><p>Thinking this, Qin Sang immediately halted his escape, his Ebony Sword hovering before him as he coldly watched the woman.</p><p>The woman let out an eerie laugh, her speed undiminished.  She disregarded the Ebony Sword and lunged straight for Qin Sang's face.</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>Qin Sang waved his hand, and the Ten Yama Banner flew out.</p><p>But at that moment, the woman suddenly opened her mouth wide, her jaws almost splitting apart, yet no sound emerged. It was incredibly strange.  Then, a peculiar white light rapidly formed in front of her, transforming into a spinning cone that shot towards Qin Sang's forehead with lightning speed.</p><p>"This is..."</p><p>Qin Sang's pupils contracted. He realized that this cone was extraordinary, a type of attack that could directly harm the primordial spirit.</p><p>The Soul Body's abilities were indeed strange, but they were ineffective against him.</p>
