<h1>Chapter 2109:  The Illusory Profound Light</h1><p>Qin Sang left the Western Lands and arrived at a deserted sea area.  He set up protective formations and sat cross-legged.</p><p>He and the Heaven-Eye Butterfly shared a mental link.  Sensing the butterfly’s urgent intention, Qin Sang immediately activated a secret technique to aid its breakthrough.</p><p>Stars shifted, time passed.</p><p>In the tranquil night, a lone figure sat, then a faint light flickered, revealing a phoenix butterfly, fluttering up and down.</p><p>The energy of Heaven and Earth was drawn by the butterfly, rising and falling with the beat of its wings.  More and more energy was attracted, forming a visible spiritual tide that roared above the sea.</p><p>Suddenly, Qin Sang felt something and immediately poured all his energy into the secret technique. The Heaven-Eye Butterfly soared into the immense spiritual tide.</p><p>The tide surged wildly, making the butterfly seem insignificant, yet it fearlessly cut through the waves, plunging into the depths.</p><p>Brilliant light bloomed from its wings as the butterfly spread its body in dazzling beauty.  A vortex of spiritual energy then formed around its wings, constantly absorbing the energy of Heaven and Earth.</p><p>Qin Sang maintained his connection with the butterfly while devoting part of his attention to protecting it.</p><p>In the heart of the tide, waves surged, the image of the phoenix butterfly appearing and disappearing.</p><p>At the height of the celestial changes, Qin Sang awoke, gazing at the sky. Simultaneously, the spiritual tide abruptly subsided.  Under the calm night sky, a beautiful phoenix butterfly circled and danced, conveying joy and a sense of accomplishment.</p><p>Breaking through to a minor realm didn't cause a qualitative change. Qin Sang focused on the changes in the butterfly’s abilities.</p><p>He raised his palm, and the butterfly landed on his fingertip, its wings ceasing to flutter, its eyes glowing strangely. Then, Qin Sang felt a gentle wave spreading from the butterfly.</p><p>The next moment, their figures flickered, reappearing a hundred meters away.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered, recalling his feelings. He was certain this wasn't teleportation; he clearly felt an intermediary process.</p><p>At the moment the butterfly activated its ability, they seemed to enter a strange state, existing in a way incomprehensible to ordinary people.</p><p>This feeling was difficult to describe.  It was as if the butterfly had taken them into nothingness, or into a strange space.  Of course, this description is an exaggeration; the butterfly wasn't that powerful yet.  Perhaps, as its cultivation increased, it might ultimately master this ability, but not now.</p><p>When the butterfly used its ability, Qin Sang vaguely sensed a strange, faint light, as if enveloped by a divine radiance. Their transformation was clearly related to this.</p><p>"Let's call this ability the Illusory Profound Light," Qin Sang mused.</p><p>Illusory Profound—evoking the meaning of illusory and mysterious.</p><p>Qin Sang still couldn't grasp the true mystery of the Illusory Profound Light, but the name seemed fitting.</p><p>Besides breaking and passing through formation seals, he hadn't yet discovered other uses for this ability.</p><p>This was the most mysterious ability the Heaven-Eye Butterfly had developed since he captured it. In the past, each ability the butterfly had gained possessed a mysterious power that transcended its own realm.  Could the Illusory Profound Light be the same, already touching upon the fringes of the Unity Stage, hence its incomprehensibility?</p><p>With ordinary spirit insects, Qin Sang wouldn't dare entertain such thoughts, but the Heaven-Eye Butterfly could devour tribulation thunder.</p><p>To a certain extent, tribulation thunder represented the will of Heaven!</p><p>Qin Sang had the butterfly demonstrate the ability several more times, but still remained clueless. He then departed for the Western Lands.</p><p>…</p><p>After the Heaven-Eye Butterfly's breakthrough, Qin Sang oversaw his branch temple while researching the Illusory Profound Light.</p><p>One day, the temple's restrictions were triggered, waking Qin Sang from meditation.  He scanned with his spiritual sense and found Bao Xi had sent a message—Yuan Miao was visiting.</p><p>"I wonder if it’s good news or bad…"</p><p>Qin Sang mused, then instantly appeared outside the temple.</p><p>Yuan Miao was at the Great Compassion Temple.  Qin Sang arrived by air, greeted by monks waiting at the gate, who led him to the main hall.</p><p>Upon seeing Qin Sang, Yuan Miao immediately asked, "Daoist Qin, has Clan Chief Min Zhuo made any recent unusual moves?"</p><p>"I've been in secluded cultivation recently and haven't received such information.  Your trip must have yielded considerable results, Daoist Yuan?"</p><p>Qin Sang looked at Yuan Miao, who appeared weary but relatively relaxed.</p><p>Yuan Miao grinned, "I asked Clan Chief Zai Zhen myself.  Last time he supported Clan Chief Min Zhuo, the duel with you had its reasons."</p><p>Long ago, the ancestors of the Yonghe and Changyou clans were close friends.  The Yonghe clan owed a debt of gratitude to the Changyou clan.  When the Minzhuo clan head recently requested a favor, Zai Zhen, the Yonghe clan head, felt obliged to comply.</p><p>“I see,” Qin Sang nodded, exclaiming, “I never imagined that such a small clan as the Changyou would have such deep roots.”</p><p>Yuan Miao smiled, “The origins between the various clans are often unclear, even to the clans themselves.  Perhaps a small clan might even have a Saint Realm strongman among their ancestors, quietly cultivating in the Sacred Land, unknown to the world.”</p><p>Qin Sang’s heart skipped a beat. “Isn’t the division into Upper Clans and Imperial Clans based on the will of the Ancestor Realm and Saint Realm strongmen?”</p><p>Yuan Miao shook his head. “Unless their clan is utterly destroyed, those strong individuals rarely interfere. Rise and fall are the laws of Heaven. As long as the bloodline continues, there will always be a day of resurgence. The difference between Upper and Imperial Clans depends solely on their power outside the Sacred Land. Take my Zhuyan clan, for example. If we were ever defeated, our clan’s strongmen would not intervene. We wouldn’t have the face to ask for help; we’d have to train ourselves harder and fight our way back!”</p><p>“I understand…” Qin Sang pondered.</p><p>Yuan Miao, thinking Qin Sang was still worried, added, “After questioning Clan Head Zai Zhen, I visited another clan head.  He agreed for similar reasons, feeling compelled to help Minzhuo.  They had no quarrel with you; after witnessing your strength, they didn't want to offend you, so they hid their involvement.  So Qin Dao you should have no more concerns.”</p><p>Qin Sang's expression changed. “Yuan Dao you means…?”</p><p>Indeed, from the moment Yuan Miao, representing the Zhuyan clan, acknowledged the Storm Realm, their situation improved drastically. With the Zhuyan clan's approval, other Imperial Clans couldn't attack them under the pretext of expelling outsiders. The Changyou clan alone wouldn't have the resources to hire such powerful figures.</p><p>Yuan Miao nodded. “The debt is repaid. They won't act against you again! The Changyou clan's foundation is ultimately too shallow. While Minzhuo might be able to hire experts to protect them, they wouldn’t willingly fight to the death against you.”</p><p>Yuan Miao's tone turned serious. “I tell you this to reassure you, not to encourage you to launch a full-scale attack on the Changyou clan!”</p><p>Qin Sang understood. “We only seek a foothold in the Mist Sea; we never intended to exterminate the Changyou clan.”  As long as the Sacred Lake array remained, the Changyou bloodline would not be broken.</p><p>“Good!” Yuan Miao relaxed. “I've been away for too long. It's time I returned to report! Qin Dao you, farewell! I'll visit again someday!”</p><p>Yuan Miao left promptly.</p><p>“Safe travels!” Qin Sang saw him off at the temple gate, then returned to the sub-temple to continue his cultivation.</p><p>For nearly a thousand years, the Western Lands finally enjoyed rare peace. Seeing Qin Sang’s confidence in the altar, after much deliberation, Master Huaiyin ordered the Western Lands’ monks to enter the mortal world, leading the common people back into the desert to create oases and restore the desert’s population.</p><p>Altar after altar appeared in the desert, forming a vast array, like a giant woven net.  The chosen oases were all within this net; as long as the array remained intact, they would be safe.</p><p>Groups of commoners, often entire families, migrated, led by one or more monks, enduring hardship and striving to find their new homes.</p><p>The desert stretched endlessly.  On a sand dune, a trail of footprints was clearly visible.  The other side of the dune offered shade, so the group paused there to escape the midday sun.  Camels formed a circle around the group, their coverings providing welcome coolness.</p><p>Several families migrated together. Three monks sat amidst the crowd, calmly chanting sutras even in the desert heat, their bodies free of sweat.</p><p>“There's someone!” A sharp-eyed boy pointed into the distance.  Everyone looked, and eventually saw a lone figure walking along a sand dune.</p><p>The people were amazed.  They had prepared ample water, food, and camels, and still found the journey arduous. This person, seemingly without any baggage, traveling alone in the desert – how did they survive?</p><p>Suddenly, someone gasped, suspecting they'd seen wrong, rubbing their eyes. “That person… is incredibly fast!”</p><p>In an instant, the figure leaped across a sand dune. The three monks ended their meditation, staring at the newcomer with grave expressions. They exchanged glances, about to summon their treasures, when a strange dizziness washed over them.  A bizarre scene unfolded: everyone in the crowd fell into a stupor, staring blankly at the approaching figure.  The stranger had somehow arrived before them.</p><p>A man in white, possessing a delicate aura, appeared.  His limbs and features were indistinguishable from a human's, except for his exceptionally handsome face and a strange pearl embedded in his forehead.</p><p>He looked at one of the monks, who involuntarily met his gaze, as if hypnotized.  Without prompting, the monk revealed everything he knew.</p><p>This happened to a second and third monk.  By the time the three had confessed, the man in white had already moved through the crowd and vanished beyond the dunes.</p><p>After he left, the crowd returned to normal. The three monks remained oblivious, continuing their chanting.</p><p>The desert stretched before him, countless dunes undulating like waves.  The man in white walked across the dunes, gazing east.  He murmured, "Everyone I've questioned has given the same answer. That Qin Da Zhenren is tight-lipped. It seems I must investigate the altar personally to learn its true nature."</p><p>He had never seen a Daoist altar, but knew such arrays had a main and subsidiary structures.  Going alone to the main altar was too risky.  He would start with a subsidiary one, proceeding gradually.</p><p>He also suspected many deceptive, false altars were used to mislead enemies.</p><p>After long contemplation, the man in white shifted his gaze and headed south.</p><p>He soon arrived at a southern dune, appearing atop it and looking down.</p><p>Below lay an oasis, containing a Buddhist temple heavily fortified with numerous protective barriers.  Within the temple was an unfinished altar.</p><p>The man in white reasoned that a completed altar would be intrinsically linked to the main one, making tampering too risky.  An unfinished altar would be far easier to investigate.</p><p>He approached the temple. The gate silently opened and closed behind him, the monks inside completely unaware.</p><p>He passed through the temple, unnoticed.  The temple's protective formations were as if nonexistent to him.</p><p>Finally, he reached the courtyard.  Most of the temple's monks were gathered there, seated around a deep well, chanting sutras.  Undulations emanated from the well, concealed by the temple's protective barriers.</p><p>The man in white observed from the doorway.</p><p>After a time, the monks ceased chanting to rest, and the undulations from the well stopped.  He produced a small, multicolored snake from his sleeve, which exhaled a colorless, odorless breath into the courtyard.  The monks instantly fell asleep.</p><p>The man in white entered, peered into the well, and saw an altar at the bottom. An old monk sat upon it, also asleep.</p><p>A gentle breeze descended into the well, lifting the old monk out. The man in white then materialized on the altar.</p><p>His eyes scanned the altar.  He mused, "Interesting..."</p><p>This altar's design was unlike any he had seen. He would have to ask the Grand Attendant about it.</p><p>"I wonder where that fiend found such assistance?"</p><p>He muttered, his gaze falling on an incomplete section of the altar's protective inscriptions.  He already knew the inscriptions' contents from the monk, but needed to understand their power in the context of the altar itself.</p><p>He hesitated.  A shadowy form appeared behind him, resembling a strange bird. The shadow clung to him, and his eyes transformed, resembling avian eyes.</p><p>Dark light emanated from them. He focused on the altar, unseen waves spreading out.  He was about to investigate further when his brow furrowed.</p><p>Simultaneously, Qin Sang, the one guarding the subsidiary altar, awoke.  A cold light flashed in his eyes, and he vanished.</p><p>The man in white's frown deepened. He'd felt a sudden, ominous premonition – a gut feeling that he'd been discovered.</p><p>He hadn't even acted yet.</p><p>Trusting his intuition, he concluded that Qin Da Zhenren's control over the altar far exceeded his expectations.  It also indicated the altar's power was exceptionally concentrated.</p><p>Though he didn't yet know the altar's abilities, this discovery spoke volumes: this array was exceptionally dangerous!</p><p>Thankfully, it was unfinished. Otherwise, he would have been in serious trouble!</p><p>He immediately left the temple, using a rapid escape technique to flee through the air.</p><p>Whether he'd been discovered or not, he couldn't stay.</p>
