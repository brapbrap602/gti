<h1>Chapter 1245: The Monster</h1><p>Chapter 1245: The Monster</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The bottom of the blood river became a sea of fire.</p><p>The hazy blood figures sensed danger from the raging demonic flames and dared not approach.</p><p>Qin Sang and Dongyang Bo unleashed their powers, battling for countless rounds.</p><p>Dongyang Bo was desperate to escape, and Qin Sang, though also struggling, used all his strength to trap Dongyang Bo with demonic fire.  This was extremely draining, both mentally and physically, as his true essence was rapidly consumed by the eighteen demonic banners.</p><p>Unfortunately, Dongyang Bo reacted too quickly, employing optimal countermeasures. Qin Sang couldn't close in with the demonic fire, which would have made things easier.</p><p>To the side of the battle, the Nascent Soul puppet was trapped deep within the blood mist, relentlessly bombarding the jade bottle, causing the spirit array to tremble violently.</p><p>Beneath the array, the blood mist churned silently, as if something was hidden beneath, awakened by the battle.</p><p>A small vortex then appeared in the blood mist, creating a sucking force that enveloped the array and the Nascent Soul puppet, pulling them down.</p><p>Initially, the suction was weak.</p><p>But the vortex grew larger, and both the Nascent Soul puppet and the jade bottle array began to descend uncontrollably.</p><p>Meanwhile, Qin Sang and Dongyang Bo were locked in fierce combat, oblivious to the unusual events unfolding around them.</p><p>The treasure lamp’s physical form had been destroyed, and its flame’s duration was limited.</p><p>Before the flame extinguished, Dongyang Bo had to escape; otherwise, the situation would worsen dramatically. Even if he escaped, retrieving the puppet would be impossible.</p><p>After a period of maneuvering, Dongyang Bo concluded that Qin Sang was stronger than Kui Yin Ancestor but had limitations in controlling the demonic fire.</p><p>Dongyang Bo gritted his teeth, letting out a muffled groan. His face flushed as he spat out a mouthful of refined blood onto the Vajra pestle, his complexion immediately weakening.</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang sensed trouble.</p><p>The Vajra pestle shot out countless beams of light, like a blazing sun.</p><p>In that instant, Dongyang Bo vanished, seeming to merge with the Vajra pestle. The surrounding demonic flames also appeared momentarily sluggish, as if trapped by the pestle, just as other magical artifacts would be.</p><p>Qin Sang was startled and relentlessly propelled the remaining demonic flames.</p><p>Then, eight identical orbs of light emerged from the sun, each containing a Dongyang Bo. Qin Sang quickly ordered his Sky Eye butterfly to examine them, but the butterfly felt a sharp sting.  Its vision was hampered by the bright flames, making it impossible to distinguish between the real and the illusory.</p><p>Dongyang Bo had heard rumors of Qin Sang seeing through Chan Ling's hidden movements and was prepared for this countermeasure.</p><p>Qin Sang realized these eight Dongyang Bos weren't illusions. The Vajra pestle's clamor indicated they possessed considerable power, leaving trails of light in the void.</p><p>Qin Sang was thrown into disarray, only managing to extinguish half with demonic fire.</p><p>A cold snort echoed as the other four figures successfully broke free!</p><p>Qin Sang's face turned ashen.  Dongyang Bo, at the cost of his refined blood, had activated his life treasure. Even the Sky Eye butterfly couldn't see through it.  With his sole focus on escape, Qin Sang couldn't hold him.</p><p>He decisively abandoned the demonic banners, secretly forming hand seals, as thunder rumbled within him.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Dongyang Bo burst from the flames. Ignoring Qin Sang, one of the figures lunged toward the Nascent Soul puppet.</p><p>Qin Sang was almost amused.</p><p>Even at this point, the old fellow hadn't forgotten to take the Nascent Soul puppet!</p><p>CRACK!</p><p>A sudden clap of thunder.</p><p>Dongyang Bo secretly felt alarm, knowing he couldn't withstand this thunder.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The summoned thunder struck.</p><p>The figure took the thunderbolt without resistance, instantly turning to dust – it was an illusion.</p><p>Simultaneously, a large hand shot out from another figure, grabbing for the Nascent Soul puppet.</p><p>To make matters worse, at the moment the thunder struck, the illusory hand was pierced by a thin, silver thread, dissolving instantly.  Then, the figure was pierced by a sword.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, six figures were destroyed.</p><p>Sword light cleaved through the air to kill the remaining two.</p><p>Dongyang Bo was stunned, realizing that Qin Sang had summoned the ebony sword again, making the retrieval of the puppet hopeless.</p><p>Only two illusory figures remained, and his refined blood was severely depleted. He feared he wouldn’t survive, sighing at his fading strength and powerlessness.</p><p>The two figures darted left and right, flashing through the blood river with incredible speed.</p><p>Qin Sang was too late to intercept them, his brows furrowed.</p><p>At that moment, he heard a strange cry from the Nascent Soul puppet, finally noticing the puppet’s predicament.</p><p>A vortex had appeared in the blood mist. The jade bottle array was tilting, and the Nascent Soul puppet, unable to resist the vortex's pull, was being sucked in.</p><p>Sensing a strange energy within the vortex, Qin Sang felt a surge of unease.  It seemed something had been awakened by their fight.  The feeling was unsettling, even frightening.</p><p>Qin Sang hesitated, glancing at the direction Dongyang Bo had fled.</p><p>He could pursue one of the figures with his escape techniques, but he wasn't certain which was the real Dongyang Bo.  The shifting between real and illusion was quite perplexing.</p><p>Even if he caught one, Dongyang Bo would be on guard, making it incredibly difficult to lure him into a trap again.</p><p>Furthermore, prolonging the engagement risked further complications. At the very least, the Yuan Ying puppet would likely be consumed by whatever lurked beneath.</p><p>The puppet possessed Yuan Ying-level strength, a rare find indeed.</p><p>Qin Sang lacked knowledge of puppetry, but he could entrust it to Qing Jun; perhaps it would become another powerful asset in the future.</p><p>The hasty attack, coupled with Bai's lack of advancement, meant failing to trap Dongyang Bo was expected.  As the leader of his sect, and so close to the ancient fairy battlefield, he was far more formidable than the average mid-Yuan Ying cultivator.</p><p>Forcing Dongyang Bo to spit blood, destroy a magic treasure, and surrendering the Yuan Ying puppet—it was a satisfying outcome.</p><p>From now on, he only needed to be wary of Dongyang Bo's revenge.  With Bai and the puppet's assistance, he wouldn't fear him.</p><p>With this in mind, Qin Sang decided against the pursuit.</p><p>He summoned his ebony sword, gathered his eighteen demonic banners, and rekindled the demonic fire before quickly moving to the Yuan Ying puppet.</p><p>The vortex's pull intensified, almost causing Qin Sang to lose his footing.</p><p>Without hesitation, he assessed the jade bottle formation.  Seeing it was only used to restrain the puppet, he ignored it.</p><p>"Go!"</p><p>Qin Sang pointed, sending the Nine Nether demonic fire towards the puppet.</p><p>The puppet sensed danger, but its movements were restricted by the jade bottle formation.</p><p>Unskilled in puppetry, Qin Sang didn't know how to subdue it. The creature below was awakening, leaving no time for experimentation. He could only use the demonic fire to engulf the formation and the puppet, then swiftly ascend above the blood river.</p><p>While ascending, Qin Sang remained vigilant.  He used a Wu tribe secret technique to enhance the Sky-Eye Butterfly's vision, while simultaneously performing hand seals.</p><p>Should Dongyang Bo dare to engage him again, Qin Sang would sacrifice the puppet to kill him.</p><p>However, by the time Qin Sang flew out of the blood river's range, Dongyang Bo was nowhere to be seen.</p><p>Looking down, Qin Sang saw the blood mist churning, disturbed by some unseen creature.  He was shocked and quickly fled the dangerous area.</p>
