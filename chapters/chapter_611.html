<h1>Chapter 604: The Small Lake Stone Formation</h1><p>Chapter 604: The Small Lake Stone Formation</p><p>Tian Shan is in sight.</p><p>Like a giant sword, it pierces the heavens, magnificent and imposing.</p><p>Immortal clouds swirl around the mountain, countless ancient temples, and countless shimmering fairy prohibitions shine with strange light.</p><p>Qin Sang saw a meteor-like escaping light fly into Tian Shan, breaking through a protective dome and rushing into an ancient temple. He knew it must be other Yuan Ying ancestors who had arrived.</p><p>Dongyang Bo, as if afraid of being discovered, prematurely descended from the escaping light, concealing his aura, and cautiously moved through the mountains, approaching Tian Shan.</p><p>Later, he went around to the back of the mountain, climbing it stealthily on foot, but his speed remained extremely fast.</p><p>Qin Sang, taken along by Dongyang Bo, involuntarily watched the scenery in Tian Shan, secretly speculating on the purpose of Dongyang Bo and Chen Yan's arrival.</p><p>He wondered why they were trying to avoid being seen.</p><p>Near the halfway point up the mountain, Dongyang Bo paused slightly, looked around for a moment, and turned left.</p><p>The left side was actually a sheer cliff, but upon closer inspection, a hidden path appeared, a narrow stone path that was clearly man-made, yet blended seamlessly with its surroundings.</p><p>At the other end of the path, there was a valley overflowing with flowers!</p><p>The valley had a gentle slope, filled with flowers and plants, forming a sea of colorful blossoms. The scenery was breathtaking, with a small lake in the center of the flower sea.</p><p>The small lake was like a pearl embedded in a cluster of flowers. The surface was unusually calm, clear and transparent, reflecting the sea of clouds and the outline of Tian Shan.</p><p>‘Snap!’</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly felt a tightening in his body, and was casually thrown onto a patch of flowers by Dongyang Bo.</p><p>Taken by surprise, Qin Sang stumbled, barely managing to steady himself. He was shocked to find several figures suddenly beside him. He realized it was Qiumu Bai, Mu Yifeng, and two others.</p><p>The four appeared suddenly.</p><p>They had been so close, yet Qin Sang hadn't sensed them at all. Only after being thrown here did he see them. Moreover, from this vantage point, the outside looked exactly as it had before.</p><p>The methods of Yuan Ying ancestors are truly amazing.</p><p>Qiumu Bai and the others looked at Qin Sang with surprised expressions.</p><p>Their linked marks meant that soon after entering the inner hall, they were found by Dongyang Bo and brought here. They had been waiting for a while, curious about Qin Sang's delay.</p><p>“Senior Brother Qiu, Senior Brother Mu…”</p><p>Qin Sang greeted them one by one.</p><p>Mu Yifeng punched Qin Sang on the arm, his expression somewhat worried, and excitedly asked, “Where the heck did you go, kid? Why are you only coming now? I thought you…”</p><p>Qin Sang glanced back.</p><p>Dongyang Bo stood by the lake, occasionally looking at the small lake, then looking up at the outside of the mountain.  Qiumu Bai and the others were present, but Chen Yan was missing, probably searching for him outside.</p><p>Qin Sang quietly explained, “As soon as I entered the inner hall, I fell into an illusionary array. The illusions were terrifyingly real. I initially thought it was real and couldn't see any flaws. Later, I realized it was an illusion array, but I was helpless. It was an ancient fairy array, not something I could overcome with my current cultivation. Luckily, the ancestor saved me, otherwise I would have been trapped to death inside…”</p><p>“You were incredibly unlucky!”</p><p>Mu Yifeng felt relieved for Qin Sang. The four of them had landed on outer fragments and hadn't encountered any danger. Only Qin Sang had experienced such a low-probability event.</p><p>“Fortunately, it was only an illusion array, a stroke of luck in misfortune!” Mu Yifeng exclaimed.</p><p>“What did the ancient fairy array look like? Can Junior Brother Qin tell us about it?” Ji Qing asked curiously.</p><p>Qiumu Bai and Yu Wansen were also very interested.</p><p>The legends of Ziwei Palace had long been their aspiration, each harboring the ambition of obtaining ancient cultivator treasures.</p><p>They had the good fortune to enter at the False Core stage, but saw nothing before being brought here. They dared not go anywhere and were extremely curious about the outside.</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head repeatedly and said solemnly, “The fairy array is terrifying. Don’t be curious! I only fell into a remnant of the array. In Ziwei Palace, there are countless places like that, easily capable of killing us. Don't wander around, stay…”</p><p>Before he could finish, Qin Sang suddenly felt a light breeze and quickly fell silent.</p><p>Turning around, he saw Chen Yan had appeared beside the lake at some point.</p><p>Dongyang Bo pointed at Qin Sang and said to Chen Yan, “This unruly disciple fell into the Sword Scar Mountain over there and was trapped in the illusion array. He stumbled upon a weak point, and only then did I sense the fluctuation of the mark.”</p><p>"Thank goodness we didn't miss the young lady's important matter; otherwise, I would have taken his life!"</p><p>Chen Yan glanced at Qin Sang and said calmly, "It's good that we found the person. Let's not create unnecessary trouble.  All five elemental beast seals are here.  Dongyang, should we go?"</p><p>Dongyang turned, looking up towards the summit of the Heavenly Mountain.</p><p>Qin Sang and the others followed Dongyang's gaze.  They saw only clouds.</p><p>Dongyang seemed to notice something and said in a low voice, "Not many people have arrived yet, especially since Zhenyi Daoist isn't here.  I guess that old geezer is worried about the battle and has no intention of searching for the treasure. We still have plenty of time. Follow me..."</p><p>With a flick of his sleeve, Dongyang parted the waters of the small lake.  A staircase of white jade was revealed beneath, leading to a circular stone altar at the bottom of the lake.</p><p>Dongyang led the way, and Qin Sang and the others involuntarily followed, with Miss Chen Yan in the rear.</p><p>Upon reaching the altar, Dongyang produced a square jade seal and pressed it onto the center of the altar.</p><p>Qin Sang and the others then noticed a perfectly fitting recess for the seal.</p><p>Instantly, the altar lit up, and a restriction appeared.</p><p>"Miss Chen Yan, please."</p><p>Dongyang retrieved the seal and gestured for them to proceed.</p><p>Chen Yan frowned at the altar. "Can we really reach the place where my master disappeared from here?"</p><p>Dongyang chuckled. "We've come this far; I wouldn't lie to you.  Have you forgotten, Miss Chen Yan, when I first met you? My cultivation was far inferior to your master's back then, yet my speed wasn't slower than yours. That's thanks to this shortcut."</p><p>Chen Yan nodded noncommittally and stepped onto the altar.  "Don't we need to set up a concealment formation here?"</p><p>"No."</p><p>Dongyang shook his head.  "I know you're anxious to save your master; it's good to be cautious.  Rest assured, this place can only be entered from the outside; to activate the restriction on the altar, you need this jade seal. Those old fellows are all cunning and sly; setting up a formation would only alert them."</p><p>The six stood at the center of the altar.</p><p>Dongyang raised the seal.  With the activation of his true energy, the seal activated the altar's restriction. White light surged from the ground like a funnel, pulling Qin Sang and the others underground.</p><p>The six disappeared, and the altar and lake returned to their original state.</p><p>Qin Sang's vision flickered, and when he regained his senses, he found himself in a dark underground passage.</p>
