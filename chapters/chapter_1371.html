<h1></h1><p>The grotto-heaven was tranquil.</p><p>The process of preaching at Qingyang Temple was Qin Sang's way of organizing his own path of cultivation, making ample preparations for this seclusion!</p><p>Qin Sang's mind was free from distractions, focused solely on cultivation.</p><p>When refining medicinal power, he would pause every so often to contemplate the Soul Shadow.</p><p>The Corpse Flower Blood Amber and Nascent Soul Talisman Puppet complemented each other.</p><p>Even when encountering bottlenecks, they didn't cause too much trouble.</p><p>Qin Sang's progress was rapid.</p><p>Thirty-five years passed in a flash.</p><p>The Beichen Realm had rarely been so stable for so long.</p><p>The Small Cold Domain, Heavenly Demon Hill, Sky Walking Alliance, Abyss of Sin, and the Desert all recognized the Beichen Alliance. Even if there were minor frictions between various forces, they could be properly resolved under the Beichen Alliance's mediation.</p><p>The most important reason was that all the Nascent Soul cultivators had personally witnessed the ascension phenomenon, and their sights were no longer limited to the one-acre three-point land of the Beichen Realm, but looked beyond the storm.</p><p>To a wider world!</p><p>Compared to that, the previous ambitions and entanglements of interests were utterly laughable.</p><p>The key to ascension lay in the Ascension Platform!</p><p>All the Nascent Soul Grandmasters were busy.</p><p>Some, like Qin Sang, were immersed in cultivation.</p><p>After all, without becoming a Grand Cultivator, finding the Ascension Platform would be in vain.</p><p>Some believed that things were unpredictable and couldn't be generalized. If they could find the Ascension Platform, there might be conditions more favorable than ascending through the Ziwei Palace, potentially lowering the requirements for the ascender's cultivation level.</p><p>They joined forces to explore the forbidden lands and secret realms within the realm, unearthed ancient books treasured in their sects, notes left by predecessors, and widely circulated legends.</p><p>Even if it was just hearsay, they tirelessly verified it.</p><p>In this process, hidden secret realms were indeed discovered, and the cultivators who entered the forbidden lands reaped abundant harvests, but none were related to the Ascension Platform.</p><p>The most eye-catching were the Ancient Immortal Battlefield and the Abyss Ruins.</p><p>Real Person Cang Hong led people to explore the Abyss Ruins for decades. Whether they concealed something or genuinely gained nothing, the news that came out was not good.</p><p>The Ancient Immortal Battlefield was the top priority.</p><p>Every Beichen Alliance meeting had discussions about it.</p><p>Every so often, some Nascent Souls would venture deep into the Ancient Immortal Battlefield together. Some invited Qin Sang, but were turned down by Jing Yu and Li Yufu.</p><p>The spiritual tide never ceased, and new secret realms emerged from time to time, but they were far inferior to the Ziwei Palace.</p><p>However, they could still gain some rewards, even if they didn't find the Ascension Platform, they wouldn't return empty-handed.</p><p>After the Grand Ceremony for establishing the Sect.</p><p>Although Qin Sang kept a low profile, his status and Qingyang Temple's status not only didn't decrease but increased instead.</p><p>Little Hua Mountain and Upper Origin Serenity Palace followed Qin Sang's lead, supporting Qingyang Temple. The entire northern bank of the Yun Cang Great Swamp had almost become Qingyang Temple's territory.</p><p>The one with the best relationship with Qingyang Temple was actually the Void Spirit Sect.</p><p>Jiang Xue repeatedly visited with the Han Family Head, showing their closeness. Grand Alchemist Taiyi Sect and Scarlet Tarmac harbored concerns and dared not press too hard, allowing Jiang Xue to gain a firm foothold.</p><p>Heavenly Demon Hill had Thousand Mountain Bamboo Sea, which shared the same spirit as Qingyang Temple.</p><p>In the Demonic Path, Xiang Qing actively sought to befriend him.</p><p>Among the rogue cultivators, because of Qing Jun, the Yinshan Pass City Lord personally attended the Grand Ceremony, expressing goodwill towards Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang's prestige in the Sky Walking Alliance went without saying. Yuan Mirage Sect was living very comfortably after moving to the Sky Walking Plateau. As a supporter, no one dared to touch their interests on the prairie.</p><p>In the Desert, Qin Sang had a life-saving grace for Lu Boyuan.</p><p>Except for the relationship with the Abyss of Sin being slightly worse.</p><p>Qin Sang and his Qingyang Temple were already a behemoth in the Beichen Realm, with a pivotal position!</p><p>Tan Yien was conferred the position of Grand Manager and devoted himself wholeheartedly to the sect. Shangguan Lifeng, Li Yufu, Aunt Mei, and other backbone disciples diligently cultivated and made progress in their own ways.</p><p>Qingyang Temple was thriving. In just a few decades, it already had the atmosphere of a famous and powerful sect.</p><p>But Qin Sang didn't care about any of this.</p><p>For thirty-five years, he had never left Peach Blossom Valley a single step. Even when Nascent Soul cultivators came to visit, he didn't show his face. Only Li Yufu and Jing Yu had entered once each.</p><p>This evening.</p><p>Peach Blossom Valley, unusually, opened its restrictions.</p><p>In front of Peach Blossom Valley.</p><p>Tan Yien seemed to have encountered something urgent.</p><p>As the renowned Grand Manager of Qingyang Temple in the cultivation world, Tan Yien had an elegant demeanor. Even when facing Nascent Soul Grandmasters, he could be neither humble nor arrogant. But at this time, he was restless, pacing back and forth outside.</p><p>He looked at Peach Blossom Valley from time to time, his expression anxious, but without Qin Sang's permission, he dared not intrude.</p><p>The white cat blocked Tan Yien's path, tilting its head slightly, its eyes wary.</p><p>It was afraid that this guy would get excited and rush in, disturbing its master.</p><p>"How long before Martial Uncle comes out of seclusion?"</p><p>Tan Yien had already asked several times.</p><p>The white cat still gave the same answer, hmphing daintily, "Half a year ago, Master ordered that nothing should disturb him. Even if the sky falls, you can't go in!"</p><p>Tan Yien's face turned bitter, "This matter was personally instructed by Master..."</p><p>But seeing the white cat's uncompromising attitude, Tan Yien had to give up, sighing and finding a rock to sit cross-legged.</p><p>The white cat didn't go back either, lying down at the entrance of the valley.</p><p>Two more months passed in the blink of an eye.</p><p>The mist in Peach Blossom Valley suddenly fluctuated slightly, and a person walked out from inside. It was Qin Sang!</p><p>Qin Sang was still wearing a Daoist robe, his expression natural, his aura ethereal.</p><p>"Master..."</p><p>The white cat was the first to see Qin Sang, jumping up at once, pointing at Tan Yien, "He..."</p><p>"I already know."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, looking at Tan Yien, who hastily got up to pay his respects, and said in a deep voice, "What happened outside that you are so flustered?"</p><p>Hearing Qin Sang's displeased tone.</p><p>Tan Yien was startled, secretly regretting where his years of self-cultivation had gone. He took a deep breath and said, "Martial Uncle, Senior Brother Li and the others were traveling in the desert, searching for many years, and finally found something! Not long ago, they sent a message back, and it's related to my father!"</p><p>"Oh?"</p><p>A faint smile appeared on the corner of Qin Sang's mouth, "I didn't expect it to be a double happiness, where is Li Yufu?"</p><p>He had asked Li Yufu and others to go to the desert more often to look for Vajra Essence, but he didn't expect to find Tan Hao first by mistake.</p><p>Qin Sang was indeed very curious about Tan Hao and the mysterious man's whereabouts.</p><p>He had asked Lu Boyuan to help him pay attention, but he had not found similar people.</p><p>Tan Yien hurriedly took out a communication talisman from his pocket, and said respectfully, "It is said that Aunt Mei was the first to discover the signs. Senior Brother Li was on the Sky Walking Plateau at the time. After receiving the news, he rushed over immediately."</p><p>Qin Sang took the talisman, and his divine sense swept across it, somewhat surprised.</p><p>The place where Aunt Mei discovered the traces was actually at the southernmost end of the Beichen Great Desert, which was also the southernmost end of the Beichen Realm, on an island in the sea!</p><p>She suspected that Tan Hao had been there before.</p><p>But Qin Sang had told her to be careful before, so Aunt Mei didn't dare to continue investigating. After discovering the traces, she immediately sent a message back, asking Qin Sang to decide.</p><p>"It's actually there!"</p><p>Qin Sang pondered for a while, "First follow me back to the sect to take a look."</p><p>After saying that, his figure flashed and he flew away first.</p><p>Tan Yien came back to his senses, and was about to chase after him, when he suddenly remembered what Qin Sang had just said, revealing a look of doubt, "Double happiness, what else is there?"</p><p>Before he could finish speaking.</p><p>Tan Yien's face froze, and he exchanged a look with the white cat, both of their faces filled with ecstasy, their eyes revealing fanaticism and reverence.</p>
