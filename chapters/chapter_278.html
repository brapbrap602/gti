**Chapter 271: Invitation**

Qin Sang did not know how to comfort him.

Yun Youzi did not need Qin Sang’s sympathy and quickly put away his sorrow, saying with a smile, “I was just overwhelmed with emotion for a moment. I apologize for making Brother Qin laugh at me.”

Qin Sang shook his head.

“Senior’s Taoist heart is firm. I admire you, Junior.”

Yun Youzi chuckled and suddenly said passionately, “The Great Way is heartless! We cultivators must have the ambition to never give up. Otherwise, there are so many talented and extraordinary people in the world. How many of them can achieve Golden Core? Why should it be us? Only thus can we look up to heaven without shame and not feel guilty when we look down. Even if our bodies perish and our Daos fade, we can still go to the Yellow Springs with a smile.”
(The original sentence comes from Mencius. Jin Xin Shang: Look up to heaven without shame and not feel guilty when you look down.)

He raised his head slightly, his eyes clear. Although he was deep underground, his gaze seemed to penetrate the ancient immortal’s mansion and look up at the clear sky.

Qin Sang sighed silently. Recalling the last forty years, how could he have come this far if it weren’t like Yun Youzi said, seizing every opportunity and never giving up easily?

Only four words could describe it.

Never forget one’s初心!

“Brother Qin, I’m not trying to alarm you. The two characters‘Golden Core’ are as follows: ‘Golden’ means something strong, permanent, and indestructible; ‘Core’ means something round, perfect, and flawless. Brother Qin’s Qi Sea has been damaged, and I’m afraid it will be difficult for you to achieve perfection. You should look for medicine to heal your injuries as soon as possible. Otherwise, once you reach Life-prolonging Realm, it will be too late to treat your injuries. You will regret it then.”

Yun Youzi retracted his gaze and advised.

Qin Sang asked in a solemn tone, “Senior, have there been any such examples in the past?”

He had searched the ancient records in Mount Shaohua and found that everyone cultivated differently. It was very difficult to determine how much damage to his foundation would affect his achievement of Core Formation.

Through twenty years of experience, the Sword Nurturing Scripture had proven to be feasible and was arguably the most suitable cultivation technique for him.

If nothing unexpected happened, he would definitely be able to reach Life-prolonging Realm and attempt Core Formation before his lifespan ran out. Even without Yun Youzi’s reminder, Qin Sang knew that he had to start thinking about Core Formation now.

Forewarned is forearmed.

Yun Youzi shook his head slowly and said, “It’s hard to say. Cultivation is like a bridge of ten thousand blades where hundreds of thousands of soldiers march forward. Everybody is fighting for a chance to live. Less than ten percent of Life-prolonging Realm cultivators can successfully form a Golden Core. Therefore, it is very common for people to fail in Core Formation. It is difficult to say how much influence your damaged Qi Sea will have. However, every cultivator will go to great lengths to search for Golden Cores. They will spare no expense to find ways to increase their chances, even if it is only by a fraction. What’s more, those of us with damaged foundations will naturally have to find ways to make up for it. It is best if we can achieve perfection.”

Qin Sang pondered for a moment and said, “I won’t hide it from you, Senior. I have also been searching for ways to heal my injuries. I have found three elixirs: the Harmony Elixir, the Five Essence Ointment, and the Ginseng Jade Rebirth Pill. These three elixirs may be useful for my injuries. They all happen to be items that your sect has auctioned at the Jade Sun Trading Firm. I wonder if you know anything about them?”

“These…”

Yun Youzi glanced at Qin Sang. “The three elixirs that Brother Qin has in mind all have the effect of nourishing one’s foundation. They are indeed top-grade elixirs of their kind. However, it will not be easy for Brother Qin to buy these elixirs at the Jade Sun Trading Firm. The main ingredients needed for these elixirs are said to have been found in an ancient herb garden. They are limited in number. My granduncle refined these elixirs to improve his alchemy skills, so the number is even smaller. Ever since our sect put the elixirs up for auction, there has been an endless stream of people coming to ask for medicine. Among them are major forces and even rogue Golden Core cultivators. It is almost impossible for any of these elixirs to remain outside. Brother Qin can go to the Jade Sun Trading Firm and ask. However, the elixir auctions all took place decades ago.”

Upon hearing this, Qin Sang’s heart sank. Twenty years ago, when he asked the manager of the Jade Sun Trading Firm, he had noticed that those auctions had all taken place a long time ago. He had already had a premonition, and now it had been confirmed by Yun Youzi.

Nowadays, spirit herbs were scarce in the cultivation world. Especially for spirit elixirs of the Harmony Elixir’s level, their main ingredients were nurtured by the spirit of heaven and earth and were almost impossible to find in the outside world. They could basically only be found on ancient immortal battlefields, which was why they were so rare.

If he asked for medicine…

Qin Sang could hear the unspoken words in Yun Youzi’s tone. The Jade Sun Trading Firm did not just consider the price when giving out medicine. They also wanted to make connections. As an early-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator, how could he possibly compete with those major forces and Golden Core cultivators?

Unless he was willing to pay a hefty price and let them slaughter him, he would need to offer something that could move the Jade Sun Trading Firm.

The spirit objects that Old Man Dique had collected to refine the Harmony Unity Ring were all very valuable. If he gave them some, he would definitely be able to persuade the Jade Sun Trading Firm.

However, Qin Sang did not want to offer those things unless he had to.
Di Que elderly spent a lot of efforts to find these a few. It was obvious what the scarcity of these spiritual plants was. Once offered, it would be uncertain to find them again.
Qin Sang had read the method of refining the Mixed Elements Harmony Ring and found there were only two spiritual plants needed. That was to say, after he formed the Golden Core, he could have one more magic weapon by only finding those two spiritual plants. The temptation was huge.
Of course, If he failed to form the Golden Core, all the things would be illusion. At the last moment, he would exchange them if he had to. But Qin Sang was in the early stage of Foundation Establishment, there was still a long time for him to make preparations.
"Thank you for the advice, senior. I understand."
Qin Sang thanked him. He planned the path he would take in the future secretly in his heart.
At this moment, Cloudy Traveler hesitated for a while, and said, "Junior Brother Qin, I have a place to go if you want to find this kind of elixir, but I don't know if you are willing to go or not?"
Qin Sang looked at Cloudy Traveler in astonishment.
"Please tell me, senior."
Cloudy Traveler nodded. "Junior Brother Qin, do you remember half a year ago when we met for the first time at Changyang Market? I was preparing to go to the west because I had found a dubious piece of news. It was said that someone found a secret passage in an ancient cultivator's cave, which might lead to that cultivator's herb garden. I spent half a year investigating the matter and found that there was a seventy to eighty percent chance that it was true. The herb garden had just been discovered, and the elixirs in it must not have been picked yet. Maybe there are the elixirs that you and I need. However, the old Taoist was weak. So I came back this time to invite some helpers. I wanted to talk about it when I met Junior Brother Qin in the Tianjing Mysterious Land, but it was delayed due to the mission. You can count yourself in if you are interested."
Qin Sang recalled when he met Cloudy Traveler for the first time in Changyang Market. Cloudy Traveler did say he had found a piece of news that could solve all the problems and he wanted to check it out.
However, Qin Sang felt embarrassed to agree or decline since Cloudy Traveler invited him all of a sudden.
He still wanted to return to the Taiyi Pill Pavilion and ask if there were really no sales of those three pills of Harmonious Rhyme.
Seeing Qin Sang hesitating, Cloudy Traveler did not urge him, and said, "Junior Brother Qin, you don't have to reply in a hurry. It is not easy to enter that cave. It will take another two to three years before it can be opened. We might as well wait until we get out of danger and then discuss it in more detail."
