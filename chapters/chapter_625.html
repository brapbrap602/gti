<h1>Chapter 617: The Life-Bound Insect Gu</h1><p>The Thousand Households Fort is surrounded by the river.</p><p>This is the largest river nearby, flowing from north to south, called the Green Robe River.</p><p>At night, a few boats drift on the Green Robe River, with guards keeping watch to prevent beasts or enemies from entering the fort.</p><p>The river Qin Sang drifted down was a tributary of the upper Green Robe River, originating from deep mountains and valleys, eventually merging into the Green Robe River; countless similar tributaries exist.</p><p>During the drift, Qin Sang was sometimes unconscious, sometimes awake, but he remembered the general direction.</p><p>The night was cold and damp, but Qin Sang's physical wounds had healed, so he could endure it, allowing Flying Night Rakshasa to increase its speed.</p><p>The place where he lost the spirit beast bag was farther from the Thousand Households Fort than he remembered.  Qin Sang and Flying Night Rakshasa proceeded slowly, searching for a suitable spiritual vein for seclusion.</p><p>Unexpectedly, this place was far more barren than Qin Sang imagined.  After traveling for a long time in the middle of the night, they only found a few insignificant small spiritual veins, unusable.</p><p>Leaving the Green Robe River, villages became increasingly rare, deep mountains and old forests, untouched by human presence.</p><p>Qin Sang carefully identified the small river he had drifted down, and flew along the river. By dawn, he finally arrived near where he had lost the spirit beast bag.</p><p>Upon reaching the water puddle, Qin Sang carefully examined it. The man in animal hide had been completely devoured by the Blood Winged Devil Bees, not a bone left.</p><p>He searched the surrounding area, but found no sign of the corpse puppet bag.</p><p>Qin Sang recalled that day's events.</p><p>He was only focused on escaping and didn't see where the man in animal hide threw the corpse puppet bag before he died. If it fell into the river, it must have been swept into the Green Robe River and was impossible to find.</p><p>Fortunately, besides the Blood Winged Devil Bees, there were no other strange insects in the spirit beast bag, otherwise Qin Sang would have been truly distressed.</p><p>Unlike the vibrant scene that day, the mountains on both sides of the river were now deathly silent; not a single bird call or animal roar could be heard, not even the sound of insects.</p><p>Such an unusual situation must have been caused by the Blood Winged Devil Bees; all the creatures on the mountain had been eaten.</p><p>Qin Sang jumped onto Flying Night Rakshasa, about to track the Blood Winged Devil Bees, when he suddenly saw a fleeting green light like a flame on a mountain to the west, followed by faint shouts.</p><p>"Someone?"</p><p>Qin Sang frowned and ordered Flying Night Rakshasa to take him into hiding and approach quietly.</p><p>"These strange bees fear my ghost fire! Two priests, you use insect gu to lure the bees down, and I will burn them with fire and take the beehive."</p><p>Three figures were gathered in a mountain hollow, concealing their presence and observing the cliff in the distance.</p><p>Two corpses of Blood Winged Devil Bees lay scattered around them; the marks on the corpses showed they had mostly been burned to death.</p><p>At that moment, a buzzing sound continued from the cliff, with a large swarm of Blood Winged Devil Bees still circling, forming a large cloud of blood; roughly two hundred remained.</p><p>They were circling the cliff, seeming to protect something.  A closer look revealed a black, ball-like beehive on the cliff.</p><p>These three didn't notice someone watching them from the nearby woods.</p><p>The speaker was a pale young man.</p><p>He wore a black robe, with a strange pattern on the back depicting a ‘worm’ character.</p><p>Behind him stood three skeletal figures. Green ghost fire flickered in their eye sockets, and transparent threads bound their joints, the other ends wrapped around the young man's fingers.</p><p>Qin Sang was extremely knowledgeable about necromancy and instantly understood that these three skeletons were bone puppets created using a necromantic technique. Unlike Flying Night Rakshasa with its powerful body, their core was the ghost fire in their eyes.</p><p>This method of creating corpses was crude and matched the young man's cultivation level of the twelfth layer of Qi Refinement.</p><p>The two elders beside him also had Qi Refinement cultivation.</p><p>One was at the tenth layer of Qi Refinement, the other only at the ninth.</p><p>They seemed to be from the same village; their patterns were similar, featuring strange decorations of animal hide and teeth, though different from the style of the man in animal hide who had died to the bees.</p><p>Their forehead ornaments depicted, respectively, a waxing and waning crescent moon.</p><p>Qin Sang wondered if they were the priests of the Moonlit Valley.  These village shamans had pathetically weak cultivation. He was curious about the young man's background.</p><p>The two priests seemed to dislike each other, ignoring each other as they chanted incantations.  A spirit insect flew from each of their dantians.</p><p>One was snake-like, with fiery red scales, wings, and two heads. It was surprisingly small, no bigger than a human finger, and looked very strange.</p><p>The other was beetle-shaped, slender with a thin, dragonfly-wing-like carapace that, when spread, resembled blades.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes lit up. He recognized the beetle; the Spirit Control Sect called it the Great Blade Ox. It wasn't a particularly rare insect, only capable of two transformations, but it was incredibly fast, its carapace as sharp as a magical weapon, making it a decent fighter.</p><p>He'd been curious ever since seeing the jade mantis emerge from the fur-clad man's energy sea.  The insect-controlling techniques here were completely different from the Spirit Control Sect's system.</p><p>These two insects, like the jade mantis, had a strange connection with their masters – a vital energy link forged through life-binding cultivation.</p><p>Were they refining the insects into their lifebound insects?</p><p>"Go!"</p><p>The two elders obeyed the young man's command, controlling their insects to charge the swarm.</p><p>The two-headed winged serpent opened its mouth in mid-air, spewing two jets of flame. The Great Blade Ox spread its wings, creating several wing shadows to draw the swarm's attention, then they fled in different directions.</p><p>'Buzz…buzz…'</p><p>The blood-winged skull bees were enraged, splitting into two groups to pursue. One group was led towards the young man by the serpent.</p><p>The young man beckoned three skeletons, confidently meeting the oncoming swarm. When the blood-winged skull bees arrived, he commanded the skeletons to unleash ghostfire.</p><p>He expected the bees to be instantly incinerated, but a cloud of blood mist suddenly enveloped the swarm, consuming the ghostfire. Only the outer ring of bees were burned, and the rest swarmed towards the three men, who were stunned.</p><p>"What an idiot."</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head silently.</p><p>The blood-winged skull bees underwent a transformation in the Blood Mist Valley. Alone, they were not fearsome, but in groups, they underwent a qualitative change.</p><p>The serpent was unable to escape, surrounded by the blood-winged skull bees. It frantically fought back with fire.</p><p>The young man hastily continued to unleash ghostfire, finally rescuing the serpent, but it was badly injured, almost incapacitated.</p><p>The elder with the crescent moon headdress let out a mournful cry, as if he himself was injured. His energy visibly weakened.</p><p>"Indeed, lifebound insects!"</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes narrowed.  When a cultivator's lifebound weapon or artifact is severely damaged, it would inflict backlash on its owner, just like what happened to the elder.</p><p>Seeing the three struggling, Qin Sang took out two large cloaks, placing one on the flying night fork, and ordered it to attack.</p>
