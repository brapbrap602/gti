<h1>Chapter 1252: Startling Feather</h1><p>"Is the Thunder-Swallowing Falcon King truly here?"  </p><p>Qin Sang revealed a look of surprise as he stared at the Thunder Thought Pearl, though he couldn't discern anything unusual. He patiently waited for Fat Chicken to complete the secret technique.  </p><p>Suddenly, he noticed two clear streams of tears flowing from Fat Chicken's eyes, its entire body trembling.  </p><p>Mother and child had been separated for two hundred years.  </p><p>Fat Chicken had finally found news of its closest kin and wept tears of joy.  </p><p>Unable to suppress its overwhelming emotions, Fat Chicken hurriedly opened its eyes after completing the secret technique and cried out to Qin Sang, "Master..."  </p><p>"Can you determine your mother's location?" Qin Sang asked gravely.  </p><p>Fat Chicken immediately nodded like a chick pecking at rice, repeatedly saying, "It's a bit vague, but I can confirm the general direction. The closer we get, the clearer the Thunder Thought Pearl's guidance becomes!"  </p><p>Qin Sang pondered for a moment, then put away his sword talisman and said, "Let's go! We'll rescue your mother first!"  </p><p>The Thunder-Swallowing Falcon King had once fought against two opponents single-handedly, yet she had been trapped here for two hundred years, unable to escape. It seemed there were dangers within the Black Tower Array that they were unaware of.  </p><p>She must have a deep understanding of the Black Tower Array. If they could rescue the Falcon King, she could also help them deal with Old Demon Ye.  </p><p>Most of the Nascent Soul cultivators from the Cold Domain had already gathered. It shouldn't be too difficult to help her escape.  </p><p>However, Qin Sang decided to assess the situation first before deciding whether to seek help from others.  </p><p>If he could rescue the Falcon King on his own, that would be ideal. After being trapped for so many years, he wasn't sure what condition she was in. If someone saw her weakened state and harbored ill intentions, it could lead to disaster.  </p><p>Qin Sang instructed Fat Chicken to focus on activating the Thunder Thought Pearl. He enveloped both of them in sword light and charged into the blood mist.  </p><p>---</p><p>At this moment.  </p><p>In an unknown space.  </p><p>The area was pitch black, unnaturally cold, and extremely cramped. It could barely accommodate one person; two would feel crowded.  </p><p>The space was surrounded by black walls.  </p><p>There was no stone slab above, but a blood-colored vortex appeared in the void, constantly churning.  </p><p>Not only did no blood mist flow in from the vortex, but wisps of spiritual energy seeped in instead.  </p><p>At this moment, a woman sat cross-legged within the space.  </p><p>She wore no makeup, her silver hair cascading naturally over her shoulders. Her nose was high and delicate, her features graceful.  </p><p>She wore a soft silver robe, upon closer inspection, one could see faint streaks of lightning coursing through it—it was woven from thunder threads.  </p><p>However, a pair of wings grew from her back, revealing her identity as a demon.  </p><p>This woman was none other than the Thunder-Swallowing Falcon King, her Dharma name: Startling Feather!  </p><p>She had been here for so long that she had grown accustomed to the cramped space, sitting calmly with her eyes closed, deep in meditation.  </p><p>Trapped in such a place, she didn't know what else to do besides cultivate.  </p><p>After so many years, she had no choice but to accept her fate.  </p><p>The only silver lining was that the restrictions here had been damaged. They could only trap her, not inflict additional punishments. Otherwise, she would have long since perished.  </p><p>Even so, this period had been incredibly difficult.  </p><p>What was even more terrifying was the uncertainty of whether she would ever escape.  </p><p>What kept her going was the greatest bond in her heart—her only family.  </p><p>But cultivation was an arduous path. With the passage of time and without her protection, could that fragile child, born not long ago, survive?  </p><p>The dark space was eerily silent, to the point where the passage of time was imperceptible.  </p><p>Suddenly, Startling Feather jolted awake, rising to her feet so abruptly that her hair nearly brushed against the blood-colored vortex.  </p><p>She seemed to sense something, her expression one of disbelief.  </p><p>The sensation was so faint that she even wondered if it was a hallucination born of her deep longing.  </p><p>Startling Feather froze for a moment before suddenly realizing it was real—not an illusion!  </p><p>Her body suddenly surged with lightning, bolts of electricity raining down and converging before her, eventually forming a thunderball the size of a longan fruit. She guided it into her brow.  </p><p>The sensation grew clearer.  </p><p>"Little Fat! It really is Little Fat!"  </p><p>Startling Feather's face lit up with joy.  </p><p>First, she finally knew her child was still alive. Second, she sensed the Thunder Thought Pearl drawing closer—clearly, someone was coming to rescue her.  </p><p>The Thunder Thought Pearl connected the bloodline between mother and child. Only a blood relative could activate it; even if another member of their race tried, it wouldn't evoke such a response.  </p><p>"How did he get in? Has he already taken human form? Or has something happened to the Blood Lake?"  </p><p>Trapped here, Startling Feather could only vaguely sense the Thunder Thought Pearl and had no idea of Little Fat's circumstances.  </p><p>She couldn't help but worry. What if the child was under threat? To take human form in two hundred years—even after being nurtured by her for so long and being born at the Demon Spirit stage—was a prodigious feat.  </p><p>Moreover, this was a place of great danger. If Little Fat, unaware of the risks, rushed in recklessly to save her, it would be extremely perilous!  </p><p>She herself had been forced to flee into this space to escape harm.  </p><p>Though she had survived, she soon discovered that once inside, there was no way out. No matter what methods she tried, she couldn't break through the vortex.  </p><p>"No!"  </p><p>Her thoughts in turmoil, Startling Feather could no longer sit still.  </p><p>Gritting her teeth, she looked up at the blood-colored vortex above her. Suddenly, she reverted to her demon form, her wings spreading wide as countless bolts of lightning silently surged forth.  </p><p>In the next moment, she transformed into a streak of lightning, charging fiercely toward the blood-colored vortex.  </p><p>*Boom!*  </p><p>The blood-colored vortex churned violently.  </p><p>The vortex spun wildly, countless streams of blood light surging toward its center.  </p><p>Within the vortex, blood light pulsed, occasionally flashing with thunder. The two forces clashed violently, but the space below remained unmoved.  </p><p>The outcome was soon decided.  </p><p>Startling Feather was no match. She fell heavily to the ground.  </p><p>Now, she was in a sorry state, her feathers tattered and damaged.  </p><p>This scene had repeated itself countless times.  </p><p>---</p><p>Within the Black Tower Array.  </p><p>Qin Sang and Fat Chicken moved through the array.  </p><p>The direction sensed by the Thunder Thought Pearl kept shifting as the array constantly rotated. The Black Towers were not static, though it was unclear by what rules they moved.  </p><p>However, as time passed, the Thunder Thought Pearl's sensing grew clearer, indicating they were getting closer to where the Thunder-Swallowing Falcon King was trapped.  </p><p>*Whoosh!*  </p><p>Just as they passed through a cloud of blood mist, Qin Sang suddenly halted, then slowly retreated with Fat Chicken.  </p><p>Ahead of them, a dozen giants, nearly two zhang tall, were wandering about.  </p><p>The giants were exceptionally burly, each wielding a massive axe in both hands, their appearances fierce and menacing. Their bodies and axes were entirely blood-red, as if formed from coagulated blood—like flesh puppets.  </p><p>Not long after entering, Qin Sang had discovered these flesh puppets roaming the array.  </p><p>Fortunately, his Heavenly Eye technique had spotted them in advance.  </p><p>These flesh puppets were highly perceptive. Qin Sang had nearly been discovered when he got too close.  </p><p>They seemed to lack intelligence, but Qin Sang could clearly sense danger emanating from them. The feeling was familiar, reminding him of the unknown creature he had disturbed at the bottom of the Blood River.  </p><p>He wasn't sure if there was a connection between the two—whether they were created by the builders of the Blood Lake or had naturally spawned.  </p><p>It seemed the Blood Lake held dangers beyond what met the eye.  </p><p>Qin Sang had no desire to experience the taste of their blood axes. Carefully avoiding them, he continued his search for the Thunder-Swallowing Falcon King with Fat Chicken.</p>
