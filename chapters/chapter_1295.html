<h1>Chapter 1287: Breaking Camp</h1><p>Chapter 1287: Breaking Camp</p><p>“We’re withdrawing from Double Mirror Mountain and retreating to Yu City?”</p><p>Autumn Fairy was surprised by the order, her brows furrowed.</p><p>Before this, Grandmaster Cang Hong had foreseen a shift in the situation.</p><p>According to Grandmaster Cang Hong’s plan, if the Two Realms Alliance proved too strong to oppose, the order would be to consolidate forces, and all of the Abyss Cultivators would retreat to the three main camps, holding them and waiting for an opportunity.</p><p>They hadn’t just arrived at the Skywalk Plateau; they had been here for many years, building a solid foundation.  They were prepared for a defensive battle, forcing the Two Realms Alliance to pay a price.</p><p>Even if retreat was ultimately inevitable, holding out for a day would still be beneficial.  </p><p>Not to mention the various spiritual mines and resources of the grasslands and the Skywalk Plateau.</p><p>They were now on the verge of advancing to the second tier of the Skywalk Plateau, with the sects in the southern foothills having largely abandoned their homes and fled in panic.</p><p>The spiritual veins of these sects were also a kind of resource.</p><p>Lower-level Abyss cultivators could gain better cave dwellings.</p><p>Some resource-depleting secret techniques required damaging spiritual veins, something they were reluctant to do to their own sects, but on the Skywalk Plateau they were less concerned.</p><p>Even if they retreated, it shouldn't be this far.</p><p>Wasn't this equivalent to handing over the fruits of two hundred years of conquest?</p><p>“Even with the loss of a fellow cultivator, with this top-tier formation and various arrangements, defending Double Mirror Mountain is not difficult! If the two fellow cultivators can help me break the Xun Wind Array, we can turn the tide!”</p><p>Autumn Fairy was unwilling to give up so easily. Double Mirror Mountain was essentially her creation.</p><p>“What? A fellow cultivator has already fallen?”</p><p>The two were shocked. They had only just arrived at Double Mirror Mountain, finding the battle already underway. They contacted the cultivator who was managing the array, found Qin Sang, and hid themselves, missing Qin Sang’s killing of Moon Scatterer.</p><p>The Song cultivator sighed, “Elder Ye sent us here, worried that you would underestimate them and be taken advantage of.  Especially Cold Cloud Heaven; Elder Ye seemed more wary of him than of Qin Sang. Unfortunately, we were too late.”</p><p>They learned that the deceased was Moon Scatterer.</p><p>The Shan cultivator, knowing Moon Scatterer's wicked deeds, calmed slightly, feeling Qin Sang had done a good deed, and said nothing more.</p><p>“Elder Ye and Senior Cang Hong are stationed in the other two camps, already preparing for the retreat. If the Fairy doesn't make a quick decision, we will be surrounded by the Three-way Alliance. We can't hesitate any longer! Yu City is a contingency plan prepared by Elder Ye.  He and Senior Cang Hong have selected several suitable strategic passes along the way for the army to defend, adapting as necessary. We may not retreat that far.”</p><p>The two urged her repeatedly.</p><p>“Fairy, don’t forget why Elder Ye and the others agreed to join forces in the first place. It wasn't to destroy the Two Realms Alliance and dominate the Northern Star Territory.  This outcome was expected.  No matter how strong the Two Realms Alliance is, they can't invade the Abyss; it would just be a stalemate.  To fall into danger because of a moment of anger is to lose the big picture.”</p><p>At these words, Autumn Fairy’s expression shifted slightly, and she became less insistent.</p><p>“What about the resources stored in the mountain if we evacuate hastily?”</p><p>Double Mirror Mountain was a resource warehouse for the Abyss, containing not only resources such as spirit stones and materials to support the war, but also numerous treasures plundered from the Skywalk Plateau, a vast amount.</p><p>Cultivators have limited space in their pouches and can only carry away a small fraction.</p><p>They hadn’t anticipated the rise of the Two Realms Alliance, or the sudden emergence of top-tier experts. They hadn’t considered transporting everything beforehand, and now it was too late.</p><p>“Let’s salvage as much as possible; take the most precious treasures.  We’ll have to destroy the rest.  Most of it was looted from the Two Realms Alliance anyway, so there is no need to feel sorry for abandoning it.”</p><p>The Shan cultivator said decisively.</p><p>Autumn Fairy hesitated for a moment, then finally accepted the proposal. “We need to carefully discuss the specific plan. The situation is urgent. Please, the two fellow cultivators, help repel the enemy.”</p><p>“Of course!”</p><p>The Shan cultivator nodded readily.  “I’ve been wanting to test his skills.  I haven't had the chance before. Song, follow me. If Qin doesn’t show himself, we’ll hunt down others.  Let’s see how long he can endure!”</p><p>The three immediately split into two groups.</p><p>Autumn Fairy returned to oversee the array.</p><p>…</p><p>News of Qin Sang's decisive victory over the Nascent Soul ancestor spread like wildfire across the battlefield, boosting the morale of the Two Realms Alliance.</p><p>The Abyss forces were terrified. They had heard countless legends about Qin Sang, and now another Nascent Soul ancestor had fallen at his hands. Their minds were greatly impacted.</p><p>Some even saw Qin Sang as a demonic figure, even more terrifying than True One.</p><p>Meanwhile, Autumn Fairy personally intercepted Qin Sang, leaving the array to other cultivators. That person's cultivation and skills were inferior to Qing Jun, who seized the opportunity to launch a fierce attack.</p><p>At this point, the situation was extremely advantageous for the Two Realms Alliance.</p><p>While Autumn Fairy and the others were discussing, Qin Sang had already retreated to his own lines and informed Qing Jun and the others to be vigilant.</p><p>After confirming the reinforcements' identities, Qing Jun, instead of rushing in, chose to consolidate his battle formation, proceeding steadily.  The efforts of Shan and Song yielded little advantage.</p><p>After a fierce battle, Qing Jun sounded the retreat, bringing the large-scale conflict to an abrupt end.</p><p>Afterwards, the allied forces from both realms established a camp on the mountain, their forces aimed directly at the Shuangjing Mountain encampment. The Celestial Lake atop Shuangjing Mountain gradually recovered, its breathtaking beauty masking the carnage of the recent battle.</p><p>Many Yuan Ying cultivators approached Qin Sang to offer congratulations on his latest victory.</p><p>Qin Sang humbly attributed it to luck.</p><p>At this time, everyone received a message from Qing Jun to discuss the next phase of the battle. Aware of Qin Sang's expertise in reconnaissance, Qing Jun instructed him to remain and monitor the activities of the Zuoyuan forces.</p><p>After seeing Jing Lin and others off, Qin Sang swiftly concealed himself, activating his celestial eye ability to observe the movements of the Zuoyuan cultivators, preventing a surprise attack.</p><p>While remaining vigilant, he reviewed the battle's successes and failures.</p><p>The elimination of Yue Sanren was straightforward and proceeded as planned.</p><p>However, the engagement with Qiu Zhi Xianzi exposed his insufficient cultivation. Against Yuan Ying experts, once they are prepared, many techniques prove ineffective.</p><p>He possesses numerous potent treasures, but the utilization of his fire essence, sword formations, and so forth, requires considerable time and effort to master, something he cannot afford to rush.</p><p>Rapid cultivation advancement hinges on the completion of the purification of the Corpse Flower Blood Jasper.</p><p>For now, he must rely on external assistance.</p><p>The timing of Bai He's breakthrough is beyond his control, making the Yuan Ying spirit puppets the best option. While not ideal, these puppets can serve as a crucial reserve.</p><p>Over the past few days, he has repeatedly consulted his senior sister, using the Yuan Ying puppets for practice.  Working together, combining his own insights with her expertise in puppetry, they've made some progress.</p><p>As Qin Sang pondered these matters, he noticed a commotion within the battle formation.  Surprised, he stood up to see Jing Lin approaching urgently, his face beaming with excitement.</p><p>"Daoist Qin, news just arrived from Shiqu Mountain! The Zhen Dao Sect has achieved a decisive victory, and Ye Laomo's main camp has fallen!"</p>
