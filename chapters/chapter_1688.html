<h1>Chapter 1679: Heart Image Yin Escape Talisman</h1><p>‘Thump!’</p><p>Several demons tumbled out of the Sword Formation, crashing to the ground and shaking the mountains below.  Without the Saint King's protection, they dared not constantly resist the Sword Formation.</p><p>The incident was sudden.  So many Demon Kings appearing at once caused demonic Qi to surge skyward. Nearby cultivators were startled, their gazes turning from Emperor Bestowment Mountain.  An uproar immediately ensued.</p><p>‘Swish! Swish! Swish!’</p><p>The cultivators reacted as if facing a formidable enemy, summoning a variety of magical treasures and pointing them towards the demons.</p><p>The demons were not to be outdone.  Their expressions were ferocious as they confronted the cultivators.  Those with volatile temperaments even revealed their true demonic forms, baring fangs and claws.</p><p>Those brought to the Central Plains by Bai Xiao were all Transformation Realm Demon Kings, possessing formidable strength.  However, exposed before so many cultivators, they were inwardly apprehensive, not as fierce as they appeared.</p><p>They sensed that the eyes of some cultivators had begun to gleam with greed.</p><p>Cultivators occupied the land, while the demon race resided in the Eastern Sea.  Over the years, they had coexisted peacefully, the blood feud between the two races gradually fading with time. But if given the chance to hunt each other, neither side would hesitate.</p><p>At this moment.</p><p>A white figure descended from the sky.</p><p>The aura of the Late Transformation Realm was fully revealed.</p><p>The cultivators with malicious intentions quickly restrained their gazes, feeling apprehensive. Even if they could besiege these Demon Kings, they had to consider how many could withstand the counterattack of a Great Saint of the demon race.</p><p>Bai Xiao snorted coldly, glancing around the mountains with a domineering posture.  Finally, he looked towards Emperor Bestowment Mountain, his brow furrowing.</p><p>He wasn’t worried about their situation.  The Saint King brought them here, certainly not to die.  It seemed the Saint King had arrived with the Buddhist Saint, and they likely had a prior agreement.</p><p>That Daoist Real Person had failed his tribulation.</p><p>But the Saint King had made a strange move. Had something else happened on the mountain?</p><p>"Follow me!"</p><p>The voice of the Azure Fox Saint King arrived, his tone unusually grave.</p><p>Bai Xiao's heart trembled. He didn't dare hesitate, beckoning his subordinates and flying away.</p><p>The cultivators, seeing Bai Xiao, had already lost interest.  Hearing the commanding shout directed at the Great Saint of the demon race, and simultaneously sensing a fleeting, powerful aura, they suddenly realized something.</p><p>High above, a cyan shadow seemed to flicker, treating the Sword Formation as nothing.</p><p>"It seems to be… a Demon Saint King!"</p><p>Exclamations arose.</p><p>Someone else pointed at Emperor Bestowment Mountain and shouted.</p><p>"Look there!"</p><p>At the summit of Emperor Bestowment Mountain, a figure had appeared at some point. Clad in kasaya robes, holding Buddhist beads, he was clearly a benevolent-looking old monk.</p><p>Those who recognized the old monk cried out in alarm.</p><p>"It's the Buddhist Saint Monk!"</p><p>"Saint Huiguang!"</p><p>"A Nascent Soul cultivator has appeared! He wasn't missing!"</p><p>"If that's so, why did Real Person Zilei hastily undergo his tribulation?"</p><p>"Saint Huiguang and the Demon Saint King have both appeared. Where is Grand Magus Danyu?"</p><p>…</p><p>Regardless of the reactions of the cultivators within the legacy realm.</p><p>The Devil Spirit, occupying the Demonic Body, had repelled Venerable Fan with a single strike, forcing the Poison King to use the divine power of a sacred artifact for self-preservation.  The surging demonic intent alerted Saint Huiguang.</p><p>Only then did Saint Huiguang realize that an ancient devil was sealed beneath Emperor Bestowment Mountain, surviving until now.  He finally understood why Real Person Zilei had undergone his heavenly tribulation prematurely at the Formless Immortal Sect.</p><p>At this moment, Saint Huiguang's plan to capture the remnants of the Formless Immortal Sect was impossible to complete.  There was no point in hiding any longer.</p><p>No matter what, the ancient devil had to be dealt with first.  Everything else had to be put aside.</p><p>Although Saint Huiguang hadn't experienced the Demonic Tribulation, he knew how terrifying it was. The declining Formless Immortal Sect and the Southern Barbarian states, still covered in miasma and unable to recover their former glory, were proof of that.</p><p>Once the ancient devil was released, the consequences would be unimaginable!</p><p>Saint Huiguang descended from the sky.</p><p>Venerable Fan, escaping, nearly collided with Saint Huiguang.  His eyes widened as he recognized the newcomer, his expression changing rapidly, a complex mixture of emotions swirling within him.</p><p>Comparatively, he felt more relieved.</p><p>He didn't know what had happened within the seal, but the ancient devil's power had suddenly surged, allowing it to control the Five Elements Crown. Although it was only a single strike, it truly frightened Venerable Fan.</p><p>The Illusion Devil he had painstakingly refined as a life-saving divine power was lost here.</p><p>Saint Huiguang's timely arrival meant that someone could deal with the ancient devil.</p><p>Venerable Fan worried about how Saint Huiguang would deal with him, as he was also one of the instigators.</p><p>"Greetings, Saint Monk!"</p><p>Venerable Fan calmed his breath, stepping aside and bowing respectfully.</p><p>Saint Huiguang stared into the depths of the mountain, ignoring him.</p><p>Venerable Fan didn't dare get angry. He looked up at the sky, seeing Real Person Hegao catching Real Person Zilei's remains beneath the dissipating tribulation clouds, covering the unsightly state caused by the Heart Devil Tribulation, preserving a final semblance of dignity.</p><p>Real Person Hegao looked at his senior brother, his expression stiff, showing no obvious grief.</p><p>However, Venerable Fan could guess Real Person Hegao's current mood.</p><p>No one expected that Real Person Zilei, after enduring three calamities, would fall to the Heart Devil Tribulation.</p><p>Venerable Fan sighed inwardly, wondering why Grand Magus Danyu hadn't appeared. Thinking that the Eight Sceneries Panorama was the source of this chaos, he felt somewhat reassured.</p><p>As the saying goes, the law doesn't blame the masses. Moreover, he had the Heavenly Hao Tower backing him. The old baldy would have to show some respect.</p><p>While Venerable Fan was lost in thought, Saint Huiguang's gaze pierced through the chaos, seeing the scene within the mountain.</p><p>The Demonic Body felt a presence, abruptly looking up.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>Their eyes met, and both their minds were shaken.</p><p>Saint Huiguang was startled by the madness in the Demonic Body's eyes. When discussing the Heavenly Dao Demonic Sound with the Azure Fox Saint King, he had deduced that if assimilated by it, they would also gradually descend into this madness.</p><p>However, the aura within the Demonic Body was too chaotic, making it difficult for him to see clearly.</p><p>The Devil Spirit was startled by the sudden appearance of the Nascent Soul cultivator, sensing a threat.</p><p>She had no interest in corrupting the world, only in shaping her own spirit. If there were no Nascent Soul cultivators, she could have wantonly slaughtered within the Formless Immortal Sect, devouring enough cultivators, finding a place to seclude herself, resisting the Heavenly Dao Demonic Sound and devouring the Devil Child to complete her True Nature.  Her future path would be promising.</p><p>But there was another unexpected turn!</p><p>The five-colored pillars of light chasing Venerable Fan were suddenly retracted by the Devil Spirit, shooting back like five ropes, wrapping around the giant cocoon and forcefully pulling the Poison King down.</p><p>"You dare!"</p><p>Saint Huiguang roared.</p><p>Venerable Fan transmitted a key message. Saint Huiguang, learning that the Poison King was within the cocoon, also saw the Demonic Body's intent. If the Demonic Body devoured the Poison King, not only would they lose a combatant, but the Demonic Body's power would inevitably increase.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>The Five Elements Crown restrained the cocoon, pulling it towards the Demonic Body.</p><p>While pulling, the five-colored spiritual light continuously bombarded the cocoon, its surface becoming pitted and deformed.</p><p>At the same time, the Demonic Body plummeted, attempting to retreat back into the seal.</p><p>Just then, a beam of Buddhist light detached from Saint Huiguang's palm. It was a Dharma inscription containing Buddhist mantras, floating down from the sky, seemingly slow but actually swift.</p><p>A five-colored pillar of light shot up, directly colliding with the Dharma inscription.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>The Dharma inscription shattered unexpectedly.</p><p>Before the Devil Spirit could rejoice, the fragments suddenly burst with immense Buddhist light, illuminating the entire mountain's interior.  By the time the Devil Spirit realized something was wrong, it was too late.</p><p>The Dharma inscription wasn't aimed at the Devil Spirit.  Its target was the seal!</p><p>Where the Buddhist light touched, the five-colored seal's light solidified, as if cast in iron.  A slightly illusory character ‘卍’ had been imprinted on the seal at some point.</p><p>In the nick of time, Saint Huiguang saw the crux of the matter. The Demonic Body's aura was somehow closely linked to the sealing power, allowing it to conceal itself within the seal and escape.</p><p>To suppress the Demonic Body, its escape route had to be cut off first, ideally severing the connection between the Demonic Body and the seal, trapping it.</p><p>The sealing power was suppressed by the Dharma inscription.</p><p>The Demonic Body froze, suddenly feeling a hard barrier beneath it. It shrieked, the Five Elements Crown radiating brilliantly, five-colored spiritual light piercing downwards.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The Dharma inscription shattered.</p><p>However, Saint Huiguang hadn't intended to resolve the problem with just one Dharma inscription. As it shattered, eight silver orbs of light lit up within the mountain's interior.</p><p>The silver orbs, like wheels, were incredibly profound. They were the Dharma Treasure, True Dharma Wheels.</p><p>‘Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!’</p><p>The True Dharma Wheels simultaneously locked onto the Demonic Body. Silver light appeared around it, forming silver rings that bound it tightly.</p><p>The Azure Fox Saint King finally arrived.</p><p>A beam of yellow light shot into the mountain's interior.  It was an ancient, unpolished jade, seemingly naturally formed.</p><p>The jade cooperated seamlessly with the True Dharma Wheels.  It wasn't attacking the Demonic Body either.  The sound of crashing waves echoed, and endless spiritual water gushed from the jade, seemingly real yet illusory.  Although the water flow appeared gentle, it was comparable to the sharpest blades, swiftly severing the connection between the Demonic Body and the seal.</p><p>But it was all temporary.</p><p>Two Nascent Soul cultivators!</p><p>The Demonic Body looked up, intense ripples and determination appearing in its demonic eyes.</p><p>Within the Demonic Body, the Devil Spirit disregarded the Heavenly Dao Demonic Sound and directly fused with the True Nature!</p><p>…</p><p>Along with the sound of waves came the Azure Fox Saint King's question.</p><p>"Old Monk, what's going on?!"</p><p>Saint Huiguang had no time to explain. As he appeared, his throat vibrated, a roar like a dragon's cry and a tiger's howl spreading throughout the legacy realm, filled with killing intent.</p><p>"Anyone approaching Emperor Bestowment Mountain will be killed without mercy!"</p><p>It was still unclear what the ancient devil had done before.  Any cultivator approaching it could be corrupted, and the demonic corruption couldn't be allowed to spread, restarting the Demonic Tribulation.</p><p>The roar was like thunder, terrifying everyone.</p><p>At this moment.</p><p>Qin Sang's avatar, focused on observing the heavenly tribulation, was standing on the mountain.</p><p>Yue Lingtian had arrived at the foot of Emperor Bestowment Mountain, shocked by Real Person Zilei's tribulation failure.</p><p>Su Zinan and Mo Xingdao were locked in combat. Mo Xingdao, fighting two against three, was no match for Su Zinan, falling into a disadvantage. He relied on his puppet's exceptional escape techniques to repeatedly turn the tide.</p><p>Mo Xingdao, having obtained the Spirit Rhinoceros Immortal Fruit, was already satisfied and wanted to leave the legacy realm.  But unless he abandoned his physical body and used his puppet's Yin Yang Escape Technique, escaping Su Zinan wouldn't be easy.</p><p>Suddenly seeing Saint Huiguang, everyone was shocked.</p><p>By now, they understood the situation.</p><p>The Eight Sceneries Panorama had indulged the remnants of the Formless Immortal Sect, using the legacy realm to enter the Immortal Palace.  Unexpectedly, the path to the Immortal Palace was broken, and with Real Person Zilei's hasty tribulation, their actions basically confirmed the previous rumors.</p><p>Something must have happened in the Immortal Palace, trapping the Nascent Soul cultivators of the Daoist and Buddhist sects!</p><p>Their attention had been focused on each other. They hadn't expected the Nascent Soul cultivators to return.</p><p>Qin Sang's avatar rushed into a nearby cave, using all his might to transmit his thoughts to his true body.</p><p>While Real Person Zilei was undergoing his tribulation, Qin Sang's true body was focused on breaking the restrictions on the stone house, encountering trouble with the last one.  Witch Clan restrictions were different from human ones, making the process much slower than anticipated.</p><p>Fortunately, he had the Celestial Eye Butterfly's assistance, and the tremors from the seal continuously impacted the restrictions, allowing Qin Sang to gradually grasp the patterns.</p><p>He raced against time to break the restrictions, but unexpectedly, Real Person Zilei's tribulation failed. The greatest threat vanished, and he felt a slight relief, but his joy was short-lived.</p><p>With the dominance of the Daoist and Buddhist sects, once trapped, the best outcome would be to surrender all their gains!</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>Demonic fire instantly covered the entire stone door.</p><p>The restrictions dimmed, and Qin Sang mustered his remaining strength, finally pushing the stone door open a crack, squeezing through.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>The stone door closed again.</p><p>His aura was completely isolated by the stone house's remaining restrictions and the seal, so it shouldn't leak out for now. But he couldn't remain trapped here forever. He could only take things one step at a time.</p><p>Qin Sang, however, didn't know that Saint Huiguang and the Azure Fox Saint King's actions had spared him. The Devil Spirit, sensing someone intruding into the seal, intended to take him along when escaping.</p><p>On the mountain.</p><p>The others reacted quickly as well.</p><p>Yue Lingtian turned and fled.</p><p>Mo Xingdao and Su Zinan ceased their fight.</p><p>Su Zinan coldly watched Mo Xingdao. Although unwilling, he understood that it was impossible to seize the Spirit Rhinoceros Immortal Fruit from him.</p><p>"Let's see if you can keep your treasure!"</p><p>Su Zinan sneered, a yellow talisman suddenly appearing in his palm.</p><p>Back then, when Old Devil Lu achieved Nascent Soul, he was invited to the Central State.</p><p>The Daoist and Buddhist sects, using Dao Markers, entry qualifications to the Immortal Palace, and other conditions, made a pact with Old Devil Lu that he wouldn't interfere or cause trouble in this world.</p><p>Old Devil Lu was fairly decent to Su Zinan, his adopted son, adding a clause to the pact that no matter what Su Zinan did, his life would be spared once.</p><p>Su Zinan knew that with the exposure of the soul-capturing incident with the demonic banner, due to his adoptive father's legacy, Saint Huiguang couldn't kill him. But that didn't mean there weren't other ways to deal with him.</p><p>At least, the Three Corpses Death God Banner couldn't be saved. All his efforts were wasted.</p><p>This talisman was left by his adoptive father, called the Heart Image Yin Escape Talisman. If used properly, it could conceal one's presence from Nascent Soul cultivators.  There was only one such talisman, and although Su Zinan felt the sting, he had to use it.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>The talisman shattered.</p><p>Su Zinan's figure blurred, vanishing into thin air, his aura disappearing completely.</p><p>Mo Xingdao naturally knew the gravity of the situation, recalling his puppet and preparing to flee.</p><p>Unexpectedly, an illusory figure of a monk appeared before him, palms pressed together.</p><p>"Benefactor, please stay."</p><p>At the same time.</p><p>Qin Sang's avatar, Yue Lingtian, and even Real Person Hegao were blocked by similar monk figures.</p><p>Their tone was calm, yet carried an undeniable authority.</p><p>Yue Lingtian inwardly cursed.</p><p>Qin Sang had been prepared for this, knowing his avatar couldn't escape safely. He didn't resist, nodding calmly and slowly exiting the cave.</p><p>Mo Xingdao reacted extremely quickly, but only managed to send his puppet away.  Fortunately, the Spirit Rhinoceros Immortal Fruit was with the puppet.  His main body, however, didn't have time to escape. Abandoning his physical body was a decision not easily made.</p><p>In reality, he had no chance to escape with his Nascent Soul.  The Azure Fox Saint King's intent had already locked onto him.</p><p>"Your puppet is quite intriguing, but you'd best behave yourself."</p><p>A charming laugh carried a chilling coldness that sent a shiver down Mo Xingdao's spine.</p><p>At the same time, Saint Huiguang's voice echoed in everyone's ears.</p><p>"Assist me in suppressing the ancient devil, and your past actions can be forgiven."</p>
