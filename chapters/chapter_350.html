<h1>Chapter 343: A Helpless Situation</h1><p>Qin Sang had already planned to inquire about the Violet Firmament Palace with his fellow disciples after returning to his sect. After hearing Wandering Cultivator's words, he became even more determined to investigate.</p><p>The two discussed the Violet Firmament Palace for a while longer. Qin Sang used his spiritual power to conjure an image of the Violet Firmament Codex and showed it to Wandering Cultivator.</p><p>"Senior, where do you plan to go next? Do you have any leads now?" Qin Sang asked.</p><p>Due to a hidden injury to his soul, Wandering Cultivator was stuck at the middle stage of Foundation Establishment and unable to break through. Cultivation was useless; he had to find a way to solve this immediate problem first.</p><p>Wandering Cultivator nodded. "I have two options now, but neither is easy. I haven't decided where to go yet. I came to the Yin Mountain Pass, firstly, to see the Violet Firmament Codex, and secondly, to gather some necessary materials. Brother Qin, you may not know, but due to its unique location, neither righteous nor demonic, the Yin Mountain Pass attracts all sorts of cultivators, and rare items often appear. If you have free time in the future, you might want to visit more often."</p><p>Wandering Cultivator had been roaming the ancient battlefield since the Qi Refining stage and was very knowledgeable.</p><p>Qin Sang thought of the Nether Cloud and nodded in agreement. This flying artifact was exceptionally useful. He wouldn't have been able to acquire it so easily elsewhere.</p><p>"Senior, if there's anything I can do to help, please don't hesitate to ask." Qin Sang said.</p><p>He and Wandering Cultivator were in similar predicaments. Seeing Wandering Cultivator toiling to heal his injuries, Qin Sang felt a sense of camaraderie. Given the friendship they forged at the Autumn Auction, Qin Sang certainly wouldn't hesitate to lend a hand.</p><p>Wandering Cultivator cupped his hands and smiled. "Then I thank you in advance, Brother Qin."</p><p>Qin Sang waved his hand. "Actually, I need to ask you for a favor first. I don't know if Steward Pu told you, but a close friend of mine is severely injured, and his primordial spirit is on the verge of dissipating…"</p><p>Qin Sang briefly explained Tan Jie's condition.</p><p>Unable to see Tan Jie himself, Wandering Cultivator couldn't make a judgment.  The two then left the city.</p><p>Tan Hao was anxiously waiting in the cave dwelling. Seeing Wandering Cultivator arrive, he rushed out and bowed. "Junior Tan Hao greets Senior. I'm troubling you, Senior."</p><p>For all these years, Tan Hao had been using a false name, only revealing his true name to Qin Sang.</p><p>"There's no need for formalities, Fellow Daoist Tan."  Wandering Cultivator helped Tan Hao up. "Although my medical skills are humble, at Brother Qin's request, and moved by your unwavering loyalty, Fellow Daoist Tan, I will do my best. Let's not delay. Let me see your brother."</p><p>"Senior, Brother Qin, please come in…"  Tan Hao hurriedly stepped aside, inviting them into the cave.</p><p>Inside the spacious tree hollow, a crystal coffin rested on a wooden bed. Tan Jie lay inside, still showing no signs of waking.</p><p>"Oh? This is a nice artifact." Wandering Cultivator's eyes lit up when he saw the crystal coffin. He casually praised it, then turned his attention to Tan Jie, carefully observing his complexion.</p><p>After a moment of observation, Wandering Cultivator gently opened the crystal coffin, closed his eyes, and extended his divine sense into Tan Jie's body, examining his physical body and, most importantly, his primordial spirit.</p><p>Silence fell over the cave.</p><p>Qin Sang and Tan Hao didn't dare disturb Wandering Cultivator, standing quietly by the side.</p><p>Tan Hao's hands were tightly clasped, his eyes fixed on Wandering Cultivator without blinking. The intensity of his gaze revealed his anxiety.</p><p>A while later, Wandering Cultivator opened his eyes, closed the crystal coffin, glanced at Tan Hao with a look of compassion, and subtly shook his head at Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang's heart sank.</p><p>Tan Hao gritted his teeth and said hoarsely, "Senior, please tell me the result directly!"</p><p>Qin Sang also nodded at Wandering Cultivator, signaling him to speak freely.</p><p>Tan Hao had cared for his brother like a living corpse, never abandoning him for forty years. Whatever the outcome, his resolve had surely been tempered, and he could bear any result.</p><p>Wandering Cultivator spoke frankly.</p><p>"My opinion may not be accurate; you can take it as a reference. Fellow Daoist Tan Jie's condition is not good, as I'm sure you've already noticed. His primordial spirit is extremely weak and could dissipate at any moment. Unless there's some legendary immortal pill, I can't think of any way to cure him. Even if you gather more Soul Soothing Pills, it won't delay the inevitable for long, perhaps a year or two at most… Fellow Daoist Tan, you must prepare yourself!"  Wandering Cultivator's tone was heavy.</p><p>Qin Sang sighed inwardly. His assessment was similar to Wandering Cultivator's.</p><p>Tan Jie's life force was nearly extinguished. Even if they could find a pill to treat his soul now, it would likely be ineffective.</p><p>Hearing Wandering Cultivator's words, the last glimmer of hope in Tan Hao's heart was shattered. His body trembled violently. He leaned against the crystal coffin, gazing at Tan Jie inside, his eyes bloodshot, but no tears flowed.</p><p>After a long while, suppressing the sorrow in his eyes, he spoke in a forcedly calm voice. "Thank you for your efforts, Brother Qin and Senior. I… I had a premonition, but I didn't want to believe it. It's all my fault. My cultivation is too low; I failed him…"</p><p>Tan Hao gripped the crystal coffin tightly, his veins bulging, his voice filled with self-blame and regret.</p><p>Wandering Cultivator stood up and communicated with Qin Sang through sound transmission, leaving behind two medicinal recipes, both for nourishing the primordial spirit. Fortunately, the required spiritual herbs were inexpensive. Their effects were minimal, but they might prolong Tan Jie's life by a few months.</p><p>But what meaning did a few more months hold?</p><p>Wandering Cultivator shook his head regretfully. "Brother Qin, I've also rented a cave dwelling nearby to wait for the auction. I won't disturb you any longer.  While I was examining him, I used a secret technique to regulate Fellow Daoist Tan Jie's condition.  A couple more treatments in the next few days might extend his time a little further…"</p><p>Seeing Wandering Cultivator's exhaustion, Qin Sang quickly escorted him back to his cave to rest.</p><p>After seeing Wandering Cultivator off, Qin Sang returned to Tan Hao's cave.  Looking at Tan Hao, lost in grief, he hesitated for a moment, then cautiously brought up an idea he had been pondering.</p><p>"Brother Tan, I know of a secret technique that might be able to prevent Brother Tan Jie's primordial spirit from dissipating, but it comes with a severe price.  This price might be unbearable… I don't know if you're willing…"</p><p>"What secret technique?"  Tan Hao abruptly raised his head, gripping Qin Sang's arm, his expression incredibly agitated, like he was grasping at straws, without hesitation. "Brother Qin, I'll pay any price! As long as it can help Tan Jie, I'm willing to die!"</p><p>"Brother Tan, calm down and listen carefully.  This price is not for you, but for Brother Tan Jie. If we use this secret technique, no one can predict what changes will happen to Brother Tan Jie. He might never have a chance to be free again. Moreover, this secret technique only seals Brother Tan Jie's primordial spirit, maintaining his current state and preventing it from dissipating. It can't cure him.  Brother Tan, you must think carefully before making a decision…"</p><p>What Qin Sang was referring to was using a Celestial Corpse Talisman to seal Tan Jie's primordial spirit.</p><p>Back then, Senior Sister Qing Ting's search for the Celestial Corpse Talisman was likely for this very purpose. So, after seeing Tan Jie's condition, Qin Sang thought of this method.</p>
