<h1>Chapter 1411: Divine Ability of the Tide-Leading Horseshoe Crab</h1><p>The Heaven's Eye Butterfly can assist in analyzing formations. Thus, Qin Sang walked in front, able to respond in time to the changes in the Thousand Buddha Wall and the power of Scarlet Flames.</p><p>He volunteered to take the lead.</p><p>Valley Master Mu and the others were happy to let him.</p><p>Before the Thousand Buddha Wall.</p><p>Qin Sang was the first to enter the crevice, his figure almost blending into the Buddhist light and the aura of Scarlet Flames.</p><p>Closely following Qin Sang was Valley Master Mu, who was a step behind, obeying Qin Sang's instructions and controlling the Serpent Spear to clear the way for him.</p><p>Qi and Wang guarded the rear, resisting the strange wind.</p><p>At this moment.</p><p>The Old Demon Hun and the Abstinence True Man, who had been plotting for a long time, finally made their move.</p><p>The atmosphere solidified at this moment.</p><p>Qin Sang was the first to be alerted, his thunderous roar causing Valley Master Mu and the others to tense up, their expressions changing drastically.</p><p>Immediately afterwards, Valley Master Mu's spiritual sense also detected something unusual.</p><p>But it was still a step slower than the Heaven's Eye Butterfly.</p><p>Qi and Wang, on the other hand, both looked blank.</p><p>Because they had long suspected the Nine Rings , they had never relaxed their vigilance since entering the formation, using various methods to investigate and prevent anyone from harboring ill intentions.</p><p>This spirit formation was very peculiar, most likely a secret passed down by the Buddhist Sect. Not only them, but perhaps even among the cultivators of the entire North Sea, very few had even heard of it.</p><p>In this kind of spirit formation, the possibility of someone tracking them was extremely slim.</p><p>Therefore, after confirming that there were no abnormalities, they focused most of their energy on breaking the spirit formation.</p><p>They never expected.</p><p>That someone could actually use the power of the spirit formation to deceive their senses!</p><p>At the same time, a soft exclamation was heard.</p><p>In the void.</p><p>With the help of the Nine Rings Finger Ring , the Old Demon Hun and the Abstinence True Man quietly approached using the power of the formation.</p><p>Hearing Qin Sang's shout, Old Demon Hun's turbid eyeballs slightly rotated, landing on Qin Sang, a flash of shrewdness  appearing in the depths of his eyes.</p><p>The Abstinence True Man was even more nervous.</p><p>The time they were exposed was actually faster than expected!</p><p>They had already taken precautions, but it seemed they had underestimated the other party's detection methods.</p><p>According to the original plan, they would take advantage of the moment when Qin Sang and the others passed through the crevice and were using their energy to deal with the impact of the Buddhist light and Scarlet Flames, quietly approaching and launching a sudden attack, easily eliminating their opponents.</p><p>Who would have thought that a dignified Grand Cultivator would also launch a sneak attack, being so unprincipled?</p><p>The plan had changed.</p><p>Old Demon Hun's expression remained unchanged, without the slightest hint of panic. He tapped the black bamboo staff forcefully.</p><p>There was no need to hide at this point.</p><p>'Pfft!'</p><p>The strange wind stirred.</p><p>A black light shot out like a sharp arrow, revealing the powerful aura of a Grand Cultivator.</p><p>"Late-stage Nascent Soul! Old Demon Hun!"</p><p>The name flashed quickly through Qin Sang's mind.</p><p>The most renowned Grand Cultivator of the Boundless Sea, Old Demon Hun!</p><p>Qin Sang had only recently learned about the famous Old Demon Hun at the Nine Stars Meet . He never expected to encounter him so soon.</p><p>Hun Demon Island  was very far from Empty Spirit Sea .</p><p>The phenomenon in the Empty Spirit Sea had alarmed Old Demon Hun. Qin Sang wasn't surprised. The reason they were so eager to break into the formation was that they were worried that experts like Old Demon Hun would appear and interfere.</p><p>He didn't expect him to arrive so quickly!</p><p>'Crack!'</p><p>A muffled sound.</p><p>Qi and Wang were horrified to discover that the tassel light shield transformed by the Thousand Pattern Armor  was easily penetrated by a strange black bamboo staff.</p><p>At this time, Qin Sang's roar was still echoing in their hearts.</p><p>They were controlling the Thousand Pattern Armor to resist the strange wind and didn't expect to be ambushed here.</p><p>Old Demon Hun's movements were too fast. Even with Qin Sang's warning, they didn't have time to turn the Thousand Pattern Armor's main body to block the black bamboo staff.</p><p>The body-protecting light shield transformed by the magical treasure seemed exceptionally thin at this time and was torn apart on the spot.</p><p>However, Qi and Wang were, after all, Nascent Soul cultivators.</p><p>The horror did not affect their judgment.</p><p>The Qi-surnamed cultivator hurriedly urged his spirit sword.</p><p>But the next scene caused his eyes to split open, instantly covered with blood red.</p><p>"Dodge!"</p><p>'Pfft!'</p><p>A roar and a muffled sound rang out at the same time.</p><p>At the same time that the black bamboo staff broke through the Thousand Pattern Armor, a ball of golden light suddenly erupted.</p><p>Upon closer inspection, it turned out to be a string of Buddhist beads , hidden behind the black bamboo staff, seizing the opportunity to launch an attack.</p><p>There were nine Buddhist beads. Their surfaces were rough and bumpy, as if they were refined from the fruit cores of some kind of spiritual fruit. They were truly ugly but were a Buddhist treasure.</p><p>They emitted a power that was extremely strong and fierce, unmatched!</p><p>The target was precisely the Wang-surnamed female cultivator's back!</p><p>The Buddhist beads were the Abstinence True Man's treasure.</p><p>His coordination with Old Demon Hun was extremely exquisite. The breakthrough point they chose was precisely the Wang-surnamed female cultivator, whose cultivation base was the lowest.</p><p>The Wang-surnamed female cultivator didn't have time to react at all. She was struck directly in the back by the Buddhist beads, her bones were completely shattered, she spat out blood, and her aura instantly withered. The light in her eyes disappeared visibly.</p><p>Just then.</p><p>A flash of light appeared on the Wang-surnamed female cultivator's crown, and the Nascent Soul jumped out, looking around blankly.</p><p>She didn't even know what kind of opponent she had encountered, watching helplessly as her broken body was smashed towards the Qi-surnamed cultivator by the string of Buddhist beads.</p><p>The Abstinence True Man completely ignored her Nascent Soul, directly targeting the Qi-surnamed cultivator.</p><p>And her situation was even more dangerous than her companion.</p><p>Obviously, Old Demon Hun had long foreseen this scene. After the black bamboo staff broke through the Thousand Pattern Armor, it went straight for her crown.</p><p>At this moment, the tip of the black bamboo staff carried a ball of condensed but not scattered black light, inches away from the Wang-surnamed female cultivator's Nascent Soul!</p><p>Seeing that the Wang-surnamed female cultivator's Nascent Soul was about to be shattered by the black bamboo staff, unable even to teleport.</p><p>However, Old Demon Hun's real target wasn't the Wang-surnamed female cultivator.</p><p>A mere early-stage Nascent Soul wasn't worth his attention.</p><p>What he had painstakingly planned for was Qin Sang and Valley Master Mu.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>The black bamboo staff tore through the air, as if inadvertently sweeping past here. Old Demon Hun didn't even look at Qi and Wang, rushing straight towards Qin Sang and Valley Master Mu!</p><p>At this moment.</p><p>Qin Sang had just entered the crevice, and the scarlet-gold light on both sides was pressing in. The Buddhist light and the aura of Scarlet Flames were just approaching. Qin Sang was in a dilemma, unable to advance or retreat.</p><p>The timing of Old Demon Hun's attack was too precise.</p><p>Fortunately.</p><p>Valley Master Mu was a step behind.</p><p>Moreover, Qin Sang had detected Old Demon Hun's presence in advance, buying valuable time.</p><p>Valley Master Mu had experienced many battles. Upon receiving Qin Sang's warning, he realized that the enemy could only launch a sneak attack from behind. The most dangerous were not him and Qin Sang, but Qi and Wang.</p><p>However, even if he made an accurate judgment, he still couldn't prevent the destruction of the Wang-surnamed female cultivator's body.</p><p>Valley Master Mu saw his companion's desperate situation, his face filled with shock and anger. A flash of blue light appeared at his dantian, and a Tide-Leading Horseshoe Crab  swam out.</p><p>Wherever the Tide-Leading Horseshoe Crab passed, the void seemed to give birth to a pool of water out of thin air.</p><p>Its body hovered in front of Valley Master Mu, its sword-like tail suddenly swung, and a rich blue light erupted, pointing remotely towards the Wang-surnamed female cultivator's Nascent Soul.</p><p>The next moment.</p><p>Blue light walls suddenly appeared around the Wang-surnamed female cultivator's Nascent Soul, like a bubble, covering her inside.</p><p>'Bang!'</p><p>In an instant, the black bamboo staff swept over.</p><p>The Tide-Leading Horseshoe Crab let out a mournful cry, and the bubble was shattered by the black bamboo staff, countless fragments flying everywhere, but buying the Wang-surnamed female cultivator a chance to escape.</p><p>The Wang-surnamed female cultivator's face was filled with horror. She subconsciously teleported tens of zhang away, finally avoiding the black bamboo staff's fluctuation and escaping death.</p>
