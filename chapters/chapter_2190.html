<h1>Chapter 2180: True Cooperation</h1><p>The mountaintop structures caught Qin Sang's attention.  The architectural style was familiar, reminding him of the island connected to the Lei Palace. The buildings there were strikingly similar.</p><p>Qin Sang had long suspected that the  zhu's owner was a human cultivator. The architectural styles of the two locations were clearly related. Could this mountain also be the cultivation site of some human ancestor?</p><p>These buildings didn't look like treasure vaults, but rather meditation chambers and residences. Qin Sang then looked towards the point of impact between the Bi Xie Ancient Palace and the mountain.</p><p>The collision was extremely violent. The Bi Xie Ancient Palace suffered severe damage, and the mountain was covered in cracks.  The fact that neither the palace nor the mountain disintegrated was due to protective formations. However, these formations also collided, creating a chaotic and extremely dangerous zone.</p><p>It was clear that a large part of the Bi Xie Ancient Palace had sunk into the Red Lake, though it hadn't been completely destroyed.  However, reaching the palace's central hall required navigating this perilous area.</p><p>Even if the Xie Gou clan chief could manipulate the ancient formations of the Bi Xie Ancient Palace, he would likely hesitate to approach.</p><p>Xie Tianjiao also noticed this, his eyes gleaming with excitement.  "Haha... This is a heaven-sent opportunity! The Xie Gou ancestor certainly never imagined that the Bi Xie Ancient Palace would collide with another hidden realm after falling, blocking even his own descendants.  Qingfeng Daoist, we don't know where the Xie Gou clan chief is hiding. Should we find him first, or head straight for the central hall?"</p><p>Qin Sang scanned the area where the Bi Xie Ancient Palace and the mountain had collided. The clashing formations created a chaotic scene, some areas even obscured to his celestial butterfly vision.</p><p>If the Xie Gou clan chief deliberately hid here, it would be difficult to find him. However, he would certainly act if he saw that his ancestor's treasures were about to be taken.</p><p>Qin Sang remained noncommittal, replying calmly,  "I can only say we'll proceed step by step.  Daoist friend seems confident. But how certain are you about opening that central hall?"</p><p>He pretended to discuss something with his Glassy avatar. Before Xie Tianjiao could reply, he and his avatar descended towards the Red Lake.</p><p>The Red Lake was underground, sheltered from wind and rain. But the combined energies of the two realms' formations broke the tranquility, creating constant waves.</p><p>They stopped three meters above the surface, waves lapping at their feet. Qin Sang used his true energy to gather a sample of lake water, testing its toxicity. The result was unexpected. The lake water's toxicity was not as strong as the poisonous mist.  In fact, when the Bi Xie Ancient Palace was intact, the poisonous mist, enhanced by the formations, was far more dangerous.</p><p>After a moment's thought, Qin Sang considered a possibility. The poisonous mist and the Red Lake were clearly connected. The Xie Gou ancestor had built the Bi Xie Ancient Palace here to use the lake's poison to condense the mist and create a poisonous array.</p><p>As long as the Red Lake remained, the poisonous mist would not run out!</p><p>But why was this mountain, which resembled the cultivation site of a human ancestor, hidden within the Red Lake, and what was its connection to the lake? Did the Xie Gou ancestor even know about this mountain?</p><p>Perhaps, they were completely unrelated!</p><p>Qin Sang dispersed the water before him and carefully examined the mountain.  The golden page mark in his palm pulsed stronger, clearly pointing towards the area beneath the mountain!</p><p>He suspected that the mountain wasn't originally at the lake bottom, or even in this space.  It might have existed in that silent space, and the霞光 had pierced the barrier between the two spaces, leading to the collision between the Bi Xie Ancient Palace and the mountain.</p><p>They could only see a corner of the mountain; most of it was still in the silent space.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't know how close his speculation was to the truth, but one thing was certain. If the Xie Gou ancestor left any instructions for his descendants within the Bi Xie Ancient Palace, he certainly didn't foresee this situation. Otherwise, he would have ensured his descendants could access them quickly. Creating such an obstacle was pointless, and would only give outsiders an opportunity.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>Another wave crashed over them.</p><p>Qin Sang and his Glassy avatar moved slightly to avoid it, their speed suddenly increasing as they charged towards the collision zone.</p><p>Xie Tianjiao frowned, following closely behind.</p><p>They soon reached the edge of the collision zone. Before them, shimmering lights of various colors created a beautiful but dangerous scene.</p><p>Qin Sang observed the streams of light, seemingly calculating their path.</p><p>The Glassy avatar finally acted, emitting a wave of cold energy from her palm that froze the lake surface, preventing it from interfering with Qin Sang.</p><p>In a moment, Qin Sang flashed forward tens of meters, the Glassy avatar close behind.</p><p>Xie Tianjiao's reaction was swift, catching up and saying with a smile, "It seems the Daoist is also skilled in formations. Then, I'll leave the pathfinding to you. I won't bother you."</p><p>"However, we must be wary. The Gou tribe chieftain is using the remnants of the ancient restrictions to set traps ahead,"</p><p>"The two formations are intertwined; even if he wants to do something, he's powerless."</p><p>Qin Sang said calmly, not denying it.</p><p>In fact, even cultivators who don't understand formations can claim expertise with the help of the Sky-Eye Butterfly.</p><p>Xie Tianjiao followed behind Qin Sang, with the Glassy Avatar flanking him on either side, clearing obstacles, allowing Qin Sang to concentrate on his deductions. But as they went deeper, Qin Sang became increasingly strained.</p><p>'Bang!'</p><p>'Bang!'</p><p>Xie Tianjiao and Glassy simultaneously struck, dispersing two turbulent flows, both looking towards Qin Sang.  Qin Sang's tightly furrowed brows slowly relaxed, seeming to find a new path.</p><p>Qin Sang opened his mouth to speak, his expression suddenly changing, he shouted: "Watch out!"</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>A sword light shot from his sleeve, aimed at the Glassy Avatar's feet, but it was too late.</p><p>'Splash!'</p><p>A fountain of water erupted from the lake's surface, a Crimson-scaled Serpent burst forth, opening its bloody maw, spewing poisonous mist. A vortex formed at the mist's center, rapidly spinning, with a suction force, almost at Glassy's feet.</p><p>The Glassy Avatar reacted swiftly, a burst of cold light erupting from beneath its feet, the chill causing the poisonous smoke to stagnate, but unable to freeze the serpent. It seemed about to be swallowed whole.</p><p>At the critical moment, the Grey Warbler Sword arrived to assist, but the Crimson-scaled Serpent's eyes widened, a seven-colored light appeared out of thin air in front of the sword's shadow, the remnants of the ancient temple's restriction.</p><p>The sword's progress was impeded, but it bought the Glassy Avatar a chance.  The cold light beneath its feet exploded, launching it upwards.</p><p>Unexpectedly, at that moment, Xie Tianjiao appeared behind it like a ghost, still with a playful smile, "My apologies, fellow cultivators! I believe cooperating with the master of this place is better!"</p><p>As he spoke, the round cauldron hovering above Xie Tianjiao inverted, its opening facing the Glassy Avatar, shooting out a cloud of red and white poisonous smoke. Before the Glassy Avatar could react, it was instantly enveloped.</p><p>Simultaneously, the serpent charged, swallowing the smoke and the Glassy Avatar.</p><p>The combined serpent and cauldron poisons were enough to kill even cultivators of comparable cultivation. Xie Tianjiao turned, about to focus on Qin Sang, his smile suddenly froze.</p><p>"Roar!"</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The serpent let out a mournful cry, its head exploded, countless icicles mixed with flesh flying everywhere.</p><p>The serpent's carcass crashed into the Red Lake, creating a larger splash.</p><p>Facing Qin Sang's cold gaze, Xie Tianjiao could still smile, but his smile was laced with bewilderment and self-deprecation.</p><p>Qin Sang said coldly, "When did you two collude?"</p><p>Qin Sang and Glassy suspected Xie Tianjiao's treachery, but they didn't expect him to team up with the Gou tribe chieftain. Both were enemies, Xie Tianjiao's earlier battle with the Gou cultivators seemed genuine; he couldn't have predicted their arrival and staged this play beforehand.</p><p>However, Xie Tianjiao's choice wasn't unexpected. Prioritizing the weaker Glassy, then focusing on Qin Sang.</p><p>"Just now! However, the Daoist is more skilled. I wonder when that fairy left?"</p><p>Xie Tianjiao realized it was only the Glassy Avatar that died.  He remained vigilant, but found no trace of Glassy nearby.</p><p>"The second time you saw her, it was already an avatar."</p><p>Qin Sang's tone was flat, his face devoid of anger.</p><p>His aura drastically shifted, a blue shadow appeared behind him, summoning the Azure Bird Dharma Image, merging it with himself.  The Bright Mountain Armor, the Great Vajra Wheel Seal, and the Sun Wheel Seal, along with other divine artifacts, were simultaneously deployed, instantly reaching the peak of physical cultivation strength.</p><p>Xie Tianjiao's smile became gloomy, "Daoist, do you intend to kill us both alone?"</p><p>He looked down at the lake.  A shadow floated on the surface, emitting a terrifying sword intent.</p><p>The Gou tribe chieftain's aura vanished within the sword intent, clearly trapped within the sword array.  The chieftain's attack exposed his location, giving Qin Sang the opportunity. Rescuing Glassy was a pretense; the sword array was the real goal.</p><p>Seeing the scene in the Red Lake, Xie Tianjiao changed his mind.</p><p>If only the Bi-Scorpion Ancient Temple existed here, as the master of the temple, the Gou tribe chieftain was undoubtedly the strongest. He had to join forces with Qin Sang to suppress him.</p><p>Xie Tianjiao knew the chieftain was injured during the previous confrontation and could no longer utilize the formations, leaving him weakened.</p><p>Thus, eliminating Qin Sang and Glassy first would be more beneficial.</p><p>Unexpectedly, pressured by external threats, the Gegou tribe chief agreed.  However, their planned attack only killed a phantom, and Qin Sang's stance seemed determined to eliminate them all!</p><p>"Let's try it then?"</p><p>Qin Sang laughed, a powerful aura filling the air, a golden sun rising behind her, its light shining everywhere.</p><p>"Power of a Dharma Image? Are you human or demon?!"</p><p>Xie Tianjiao coldly snorted. His round cauldron righted itself, spewing a plume of white smoke that condensed into clouds between him and Qin Sang, blocking the golden light.</p><p>Qin Sang's cultivation was only at the early stage of the Transcending Void realm, but the Sun Wheel Seal, a fusion of Dharma and physical body cultivation, was not to be underestimated. The golden sun erupted with brilliant light, instantly dissipating the white clouds.</p><p>The round cauldron clanged violently, nearly falling from Xie Tianjiao's head.</p><p>Xie Tianjiao's expression changed slightly.  Qin Sang was already of comparable cultivation, and he'd only felt confident in defeating her with the Gegou tribe chief's help.  Unexpectedly, Qin Sang practiced both Dharma and physical cultivation, and the Gegou tribe chief had been silently trapped in the sword array all this time, indicating a formidable swordsmanship.</p><p>Proficient in swordsmanship, skilled in poison manipulation, and possessing a Dharma Image like a demon cultivator – just who had he provoked?</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The round cauldron expanded rapidly, instantly transforming into a giant cauldron several tens of feet tall, spewing a crimson glow from its mouth.</p><p>The aura of the crimson glow was similar to the surrounding miasma; it was the result of the cauldron absorbing and refining the miasma, secretly prepared as a surprise attack. It was meant to be used after absorbing even more miasma, but now it was forced into action.</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>The crimson glow tore through the air, sweeping across the golden light. Xie Tianjiao felt the pressure on him greatly lessen and retreated.</p><p>Xie Tianjiao didn't try to rescue the Gegou tribe chief. Their cooperation was only temporary; he would abandon the chief without hesitation if he felt his own life was in danger.</p><p>At this moment, Xie Tianjiao sensed a growing unease, a greater danger approaching.</p><p>'Rumble…'</p><p>Thunder roared overhead.</p><p>Green light eclipsed the golden light, its power even more terrifying than the golden sun.  Xie Tianjiao's scalp tingled, his heart screaming, "Thunder! This person also knows thunder magic! And their skill is so high!"</p><p>The threat from this thunderbolt was comparable to that of a late-stage Transcending Void cultivator.</p><p>Terror etched itself on Xie Tianjiao's face. He truly regretted his actions, but the Five Thunder Celestial Heart Seal wouldn't grant him repentance. The green thunder descended!</p><p>'Buzz…'</p><p>The round cauldron spun rapidly.</p><p>Ignoring the pain, Xie Tianjiao steered the cauldron to meet the green thunder head-on, simultaneously releasing a dozen green specks from his sleeve.</p><p>Each speck was a tiny beetle, its carapace a vibrant green, like the purest jade.  They lacked the aura of living beings, yet were incredibly agile, instantly forming a ring and spinning above Xie Tianjiao's head.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The green thunder struck the cauldron directly, its light dimming instantly, swallowed by the thunder.</p><p>Xie Tianjiao's face paled; he spat out blood, which was absorbed by the beetles.  Their carapaces became even brighter, emitting a pure green light. They spread their wings and charged towards the thunder like moths to a flame.</p><p>The cauldron was thrown back by the green thunder, and then the beetles were also consumed by the light.</p><p>The thunder paused slightly before continuing downwards, piercing the green light.</p><p>Qin Sang uttered a soft exclamation; Xie Tianjiao had disappeared from the green light.  He must have used this technique to conceal the Gegou cultivator.</p><p>However, such secret techniques might not work on her.</p><p>Qin Sang activated her Celestial Eye ability, sweeping her gaze around.  Unexpectedly, Xie Tianjiao wasn't using escape techniques, nor had he gone far; he was at the edge of the thunder's range.</p><p>But his figure was rapidly fading, as if about to vanish.</p><p>Recalling the spirit herb earlier, Qin Sang didn't hesitate.  A five-colored light appeared on her chest; her Five Elements Crown spun, firing a beam of pure Five Elements divine light.</p><p>'Bang!'</p><p>Just as Xie Tianjiao was about to disappear, the Five Elements divine light struck him, solidifying his form. His face showed astonishment, frozen in that moment.</p><p>Qin Sang moved to Xie Tianjiao, grabbed his neck, sealed him, and then dragged him into the sword array.</p><p>Within the sword array, the Gegou tribe chief's tail transformed into a colossal serpent, thrashing in the star sea, desperately trying to break free. Seeing Xie Tianjiao in Qin Sang's grasp, he froze, his tail retracting as he sighed.</p><p>"Wait! I surrender." (End)</p>
