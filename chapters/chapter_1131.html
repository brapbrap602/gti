<h1>Chapter 1123: Beyond the Cycle of Reincarnation</h1><p>"From the moment I gained sentience, I was alone, trapped in the Hanging Garden Palace, enduring boundless solitude. Though I once roamed the Thousand Mountains and Bamboo Sea, occasionally encountering and caring for some demonic creatures, it was always done with detachment, as if from a lofty height.</p><p>"I had no understanding of the concept of 'emotion.'</p><p>"Even after obtaining a human form and being reborn, I still considered myself a spirit born of heaven and earth, discarding the mortal consciousness as if it were worthless. I didn’t know how to handle the karmic ties of the mortal world, hoping time would erase them.</p><p>"At the Yin Mountain Pass, thanks to your introduction, I witnessed the brotherly bond between the Tan brothers.</p><p>"One willingly risked his life, cultivating demonic arts to shield his elder brother from calamity. The other, despite his low cultivation, spent decades tirelessly sustaining the faint spark of his brother’s life.</p><p>"In that moment, I finally understood—what emotion is, what it means to be human.</p><p>"Our souls merged, and with that, I had to bear his karma, his emotions!</p><p>"He always carried a burden, deeply concerned for the Green Goat Temple and his disciples, who were like family to him. This became an obsession, buried deep within his heart, and I had failed to notice it.</p><p>"The wounds of the soul can be healed with spiritual medicine.</p><p>"But if I failed to recognize this, I would never break free from these shackles.</p><p>"You brought Yu Fu into my sect, and I took him as my disciple, aiding his cultivation with all my might. I tasked him with revitalizing the Green Goat Temple once he achieved success, and in doing so, I finally resolved that obsession.</p><p>"In the midst of demonic flames, we truly became one."</p><p>As he spoke these words, Yun Youzi's expression shifted multiple times.</p><p>From initial indifference and pride, to confusion in the middle, and finally to the deep affection he showed when mentioning the Green Goat Temple and Yu Fu.</p><p>Just as Yun Youzi himself had said.</p><p>He had come to understand 'emotion' and had become a true human!</p><p>Hearing this, Qin Sang finally understood.</p><p>Why, after joining the Taiyi Alchemy Sect and achieving success in his cultivation, Yun Youzi had not returned to the Great Sui Dynasty for many years, nor visited the Green Goat Temple on Cui Ming Mountain, nor seen Daoist Jixin.</p><p>At the time, Qin Sang had thought Yun Youzi was solely focused on the Dao, having severed his mortal ties.</p><p>But later, Yun Youzi treated Li Yu Fu, several generations removed, as his own, dedicating himself to reviving the Green Goat Temple and showing an extraordinary attachment to its legacy.</p><p>Now, the hidden truth was revealed.</p><p>In the world of cultivation, there is the concept of soul possession, but it cannot be done recklessly.</p><p>Each cultivator can only perform soul possession once in their lifetime. Of course, there may be Daoist arts or demonic techniques in the cultivation world that surpass soul possession, capable of breaking this ironclad rule.</p><p>Additionally, cultivators cannot possess mortals, as mortals would be unable to withstand it and would collapse.</p><p>Yun Youzi's situation was clearly different from soul possession.</p><p>Perhaps, as Yun Youzi had just said, it was an anomaly born under the tribulation of heaven.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't help but think of his own experience.</p><p>To this day, he still didn’t know whether he could be considered to have performed soul possession. When he arrived in this world, he was also a mortal, yet he had taken over Qin Sanwa's body.</p><p>Whether it counted as soul possession or not, Qin Sang dared not test the limits again.</p><p>Moreover, he and Yun Youzi were very different.</p><p>Yun Youzi was a fusion of residual souls, while Qin Sang was a complete soul.</p><p>He had only inherited Qin Sanwa's memories and body.</p><p>When his cultivation was low and his Dao heart unstable, Qin Sang had once been disoriented by the original owner's memories during his return to Wang Village, but he quickly regained clarity, and all influences were erased.</p><p>He could be certain, without a doubt, that he was Qin Sang.</p><p>His cultivation had not been hindered by this.</p><p>Yun Youzi, however, had a much harder time, searching everywhere for spiritual medicines, going through great hardships to obtain the Midnight Lily, which only provided slight relief. It wasn’t until he realized his inner obsession and threw himself into the demonic flames that he finally resolved the hidden danger.</p><p>"Earlier, when I presented you with the Soul-Nurturing Wood, you mentioned that your soul was intact and free of any hidden dangers. Why, then, did you face a dual tribulation during your Nascent Soul breakthrough?"</p><p>Qin Sang asked with suspicion.</p><p>"It was indeed a dual tribulation!"</p><p>Yun Youzi sighed deeply after carefully listening to Qin Sang's description of the tribulation.</p><p>"The Nascent Soul tribulation and the Transformation tribulation arrived together, and the combined power far exceeded my expectations.</p><p>"Though I was reborn through fire, I am ultimately an anomaly—a fusion of human and demon souls. Such anomalies are not tolerated by the Heavenly Dao, and the heavenly tribulation was bound to change.</p><p>"Before the tribulation, I had a vague premonition through my communion with heaven. In recent years, I have been traveling far and wide, settling various karmic ties, preparing for the inevitable.</p><p>"The Great Dao is merciless!</p><p>"If I could pass this tribulation, I would be acknowledged by the Heavenly Dao, and my path forward would be smooth.</p><p>"If I failed, I would perish, body and soul.</p><p>"Dust to dust, earth to earth."</p><p>Qin Sang was deeply shaken, truly feeling how insignificant he was, even as a cultivator.</p><p>The Great Dao is merciless!</p><p>The morning mushroom knows not the cycles of the moon, and the summer cicada knows not the passing of the seasons.</p><p>Cultivators pursue immortality and enlightenment, like moths to a flame, yet they continue to press forward, one after another.</p><p>"The karmic ties between Yu Fu and the Taiyi Alchemy Sect have been resolved. After my death, let Yu Fu follow you. There are also some minor demons in the Thousand Mountains and Bamboo Sea with whom I have some connections, and I have already made arrangements. The cultivation world is now in turmoil. Once you form your Nascent Soul, I hope you will visit the Thousand Mountains and Bamboo Sea. You have asked about the Demon King Qian Ji multiple times, so there must be something on your mind. Unfortunately, I cannot accompany you. Demon King Qian Ji achieved enlightenment relatively late, and I do not know much about him. However, as the master of the Thousand Mountains and Bamboo Sea, it should not be difficult for you to gather information..."</p><p>Yun Youzi softly spoke of his final arrangements.</p><p>His figure grew increasingly ethereal, his voice distant, as if he were about to dissipate from this world.</p><p>Qin Sang suppressed his grief, listening to Yun Youzi's final words, and solemnly promised, "Senior, rest assured. I will help Yu Fu revitalize the Green Goat Temple and protect the Thousand Mountains and Bamboo Sea!"</p><p>Yun Youzi nodded with a smile, then spoke gravely, "Finally, there is one more matter, and only you can accomplish it."</p><p>"Senior, please speak!"</p><p>Qin Sang straightened his expression.</p><p>"Having failed the tribulation, I should, by all rights, disperse my consciousness, choose to disintegrate, and return to the cycle of reincarnation.</p><p>"But this is not my wish. I do not seek the next life—I fight for this one!</p><p>"Of the fifty facets of the Great Dao, heaven derives forty-nine.</p><p>"I would rather this body not enter the cycle of reincarnation, and in this lifetime, contend with the Heavenly Dao once more!"</p><p>Yun Youzi's gaze was sharp, his words resolute.</p><p>Though his form was ethereal, his spirit was indomitable!</p><p>He looked at Qin Sang.</p><p>"That charred wood is the remains of my original bamboo body. Under the heavenly tribulation, my body turned to charcoal. The remaining fragment was also damaged by the tribulation lightning, becoming charred wood.</p><p>"However, this is still a part of my original body. Using a secret technique, I infused a trace of my primordial spirit into the charred wood.</p><p>"If you refine it into a supreme-grade treasure, it should preserve my primordial spirit, and the treasure may even develop spiritual nature, eventually giving birth to a weapon spirit!</p><p>"I only hope that one day, when you achieve immortality and enlightenment, I may be reborn through the body of the weapon spirit!"</p><p>...</p><p>*Crack!*</p><p>The jade slip shattered.</p><p>Qin Sang's consciousness withdrew from the jade slip, and he stood in silence.</p><p>He looked down at the charred wood in his hand, feeling its immense weight.</p><p>Yun Youzi remained, in his memory, the white-bearded old Daoist who was wholeheartedly devoted to the Dao.</p><p>Facing an unparalleled heavenly tribulation, he harbored no resentment, only an unyielding heart that never gave up on the pursuit of the Dao.</p><p>In the midst of despair, he fought for a sliver of hope.</p>
