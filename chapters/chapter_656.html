Chapter 648: Butterfly Hunt


Only the last Crimson Goldfire remained, placed by Qin Sang in a crevice by a small stream.


Dawn was approaching, the darkest hour before daybreak.


Butterfly Valley, bustling all night, seemed to have grown somewhat quiet.


A swarm of butterflies flew over the stream.


Suddenly, all the butterflies above this section of the stream froze, their wings mid-flight, motionless in the air.


Time seemed to stop.


The next moment, a figure appeared on the bank of the stream.


Qin Sang glanced at the butterflies, then turned his gaze to the stones on the riverbank. After a moment's hesitation, he reached out a hand, and a butterfly, resembling a cabbage white, flew out of the crevice.


It was small, with white wings speckled with black, the most common type of butterfly.


Startled, it flew in panic, but an invisible barrier seemed to surround it, blocking all directions of escape, leading it to Qin Sang.


Qin Sang stared at the butterfly. Even at such close range, he could not detect any flaws.


He was certain that this was the Thousand-Eyed Butterfly!


The moment he sensed the Crimson Goldfire disappear, he used his divine sense to seal off this space. There were no butterflies in the crevice originally. Only after the space was sealed did this butterfly suddenly appear.


Only the Thousand-Eyed Butterfly possessed such powerful concealment and camouflage abilities.


"Finally caught a spirit insect, not easy," Qin Sang thought to himself. He had traveled to six locations, and finally, his efforts had paid off. Otherwise, he would probably have to return with only a silly silkworm.


Having caught the Thousand-Eyed Butterfly, Qin Sang was not in a hurry to refine it into his lifebound insect gu. There were still two places he hadn't visited yet; perhaps there were better options.


Recalling the Spirit Controlling Sect's restrictions for confining spirit insects, Qin Sang chose one and cast a series of restrictions onto the butterfly.


The Thousand-Eyed Butterfly had not given up its struggle.


It seemed to sense the danger of the restrictions. After struggling for a while, seeing its efforts were futile, it grew increasingly anxious. It changed its form into a beautiful swallowtail butterfly, attempting to deceive him.


The transformation was extremely fast. The moment the cabbage white disappeared, the swallowtail appeared. If one wasn't paying attention, it would be hard to notice.


Qin Sang smiled slightly. It was still a spirit insect with undeveloped intelligence, too naive.


This confirmed his suspicion about the Thousand-Eyed Butterfly's identity.


After a while, the restrictions were complete, and the butterfly gave up its disguise, reverting to its original form.


"A second-stage Thousand-Eyed Butterfly... seems to be in the late second stage, no wonder its concealment ability is so strong."


Qin Sang controlled the butterfly to land on his fingertip.


Everything was as recorded in the ancient texts. The Thousand-Eyed Butterfly's true form was breathtaking. It seemed to be bathed in a sky-blue light. Any other butterfly in Butterfly Valley would pale in comparison beside it.


The butterfly's wings had concentric ring patterns, closely resembling the shape of eyes. Once it completed its third transformation, its Thousand Eyes would open.


Qin Sang fed the butterfly a few drops of spirit fruit nectar, released the other butterflies, looked back at the still beautiful Butterfly Valley, and left with satisfaction.


...


Centipede Village.


A strange name, yet quite famous in the Western Frontier.


The Bear Mountain region was remote, located in the northwesternmost corner of the Western Frontier, a barren land shunned by other cultivators. Centipede Village was located in the south of the Bear Mountain region, quite a distance away. It was the largest and most powerful village accessible in the Bear Mountain region.


Nearby witch cultivators would choose to trade and gather information in Centipede Village.


This place was equivalent to a market town for cultivators in the Small Cold Region.


Qin Sang, covered in dust, appeared at the foot of Centipede Village and looked up.


The scale of Centipede Village was comparable to a city. Numerous stilt houses, all with distinct witch architecture, stood close together, occupying the entire mountain range, countless times larger than the Winged Serpent Village.


The market was built on the highest peak of Centipede Village. Several factions and trading companies from the Western Frontier had established bases in Centipede Village, including the trading company that Cui Xuanzi interacted with most frequently.


By now, more than a month had passed since Qin Sang left Butterfly Valley.


As expected, the other two locations were empty, with no spirit insects. Qin Sang did not want to continue wandering in the wilderness, so he flew back directly on his sword.


This trip, including travel and capturing spirit insects, took Qin Sang nearly four months. He only brought back the silkworm and the Thousand-Eyed Butterfly, and this was with the help of Crimson Goldfire.


Of course, this was also related to his high standards.


After returning, Qin Sang did not rush back to the Bear Mountain region but came to Centipede Village first.


Before leaving, Qin Sang had visited Centipede Village once and met with some trading company managers. Most of the information about the nine spirit insects was purchased from them.


Before his departure, Qin Sang paid a large sum of spirit stones in advance, asking them to use their respective channels to inquire about certain matters.


Four months should be enough time for them to gather information.


Qin Sang put on a hooded cloak and activated the Spirit Concealment Technique, disguising himself as a Foundation Establishment cultivator.


He was a newcomer, with many secrets. As a human, he did not want to prematurely interact with witch cultivators of higher cultivation than himself, lest they have some means to see through his disguise, which would be extremely unfavorable.


"Those who are not of our kind have different hearts."


This saying was particularly true in the Vast Ocean Region.


Conflicts between witches and humans never ceased. Qin Sang only dared to move freely after leaving the Western Frontier and interacting with humans.  In witch territory, it was better to be discreet.


It was said that the village chief of Centipede Village was a Core Formation expert. However, this person's cave dwelling was not in the village. Qin Sang was not afraid of being seen through by others with his Spirit Concealment Technique.


With his disguise in place, Qin Sang walked up the mountain. Most of the cultivators he encountered on the road came and went in a hurry.


After entering Centipede Village, Qin Sang, familiar with the route, arrived in front of a magnificent wooden building.


The sign of the White Mountain Trading Company hung on the building.


Qin Sang paused slightly, then walked directly into the building.  The hall was filled with various magical artifacts and spirit pills, and a dozen witch attendants, full of exotic charm.


Displaying the cultivation level of Foundation Establishment, an attendant led him to meet Manager Bai of the White Mountain Trading Company.


"Fellow Daoist, seeking insects, you've returned so soon? Any gains?"


Manager Bai still remembered Qin Sang, as few had such peculiar requests.


"I waited for almost two months in the two locations you mentioned, Manager Bai, and didn't even see a shadow of a spirit insect. How many do you think I could catch?"


Qin Sang pretended to be angry, his tone unfriendly.


Manager Bai sipped his tea unhurriedly and smiled, "Fellow Daoist hasn't forgotten, have you? I said beforehand, the list of spirit insects you gave me was too strange, mostly spirit insects at the bottom of the Witch Insect List. These spirit insects are only used as lifebound insect gu by disciples of the top sects on Witch God Mountain. Very few people in the Western Frontier seek them, so the information cannot be guaranteed to be accurate. Fellow Daoist returning empty-handed is actually expected. Why be angry?"


Qin Sang snorted coldly and, without further argument, asked, "Do you have any results about the information I asked you to investigate?"
