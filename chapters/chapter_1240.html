<h1>Chapter 1232: Petty People</h1><p>Chapter 1232: Petty People</p><p>Yuanxu.</p><p>The Blood Lake appeared.</p><p>Huge waves surged.</p><p>Ye Laomo sat cross-legged above the Blood Lake, while Jiang Chenzi and two others stood around him, holding their enchanted flags.</p><p>Blood energy filled the air, creating shadowy figures.</p><p>Nearly half of the Yuan Ying cultivators from the Accursed Abyss had arrived to enter the Blood Lake, while the rest remained on the Skywalk Plateau as a precaution. The Yuan Ying cultivators stood scattered in the void, seemingly random, but actually forming a hidden formation to assist Ye Laomo in breaking the Blood Lake's seal.</p><p>Every time Ye Laomo changed his hand seals, Jiang Chenzi and the others adjusted their formation. The three enchanted flags swayed, shooting streaks of colorful light at the weak points of the seal.</p><p>Each strike caused the seal to tremble, more violently each time, shaking the entire space.</p><p>"Ye Lao has worked so hard to find the flaw in the seal. It's a pity that the Yuanxu seal is well-preserved.  If we had entered Blood Prison through the Wuyagu Valley, it would have been much easier."</p><p>Jiang Chenzi commented, taking a brief moment to rest.</p><p>A handsome young cultivator in white robes behind him smiled softly, "If we opened a passage to Blood Prison through Wuyagu Valley, and couldn't find a way out from this side, wouldn't Master Uncle be trapped inside by Zhenyi Laodao?"</p><p>This person was Jiang Chenzi's junior, from the same sect, also a Yuan Ying cultivator.</p><p>In recent centuries, it has become common for sects in the Accursed Abyss to have two or even three Yuan Ying cultivators.</p><p>This generation of cultivators in the Accursed Abyss was exceptionally talented, with a far greater number achieving Yuan Ying than in the past.  Therefore, the Accursed Abyss's strength has greatly increased, not only resisting the alliance of the two regions, but also having the strength to sweep across the desert.</p><p>Before the young man in white could finish, the Blood Lake suddenly shook violently.</p><p>At that moment, no light shot out from the enchanted flags.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>A giant wave soared into the sky, and the barrier formed by the seal bulged.</p><p>Ye Laomo suddenly opened his eyes, a sharp light flashing within them. He pressed his hand downwards, blocking the impact, and coldly snorted, "That Mingyue Demon King must have informed Blood Prison about our plans. Our scheme has been exposed.  It seems they intend to lend us a hand, opening the seal prematurely."</p><p>"Zhenyi Laodao can't even defend his own territory, how confident can he be in facing Ye Lao?"</p><p>Jiang Chenzi exclaimed in surprise.</p><p>"It might not be Zhenyi Laodao, most likely it’s Tongyou. Wuyagu Valley is nominally controlled by the Xiaohan Region. Zhenyi Laodao is not one for idleness; he's spent his life working for the Tianxing Alliance and certainly wouldn't dare to leave his post, lest we use it to lure him away and break through Tianxing City in one fell swoop. After the death of the Red-haired Ghost, the Xiaohan Region is not difficult to deal with.  The question is, will Yu Wang interfere?"</p><p>Another cultivator surnamed Ma spoke, his guess about the alliance's plan being almost spot-on.</p><p>His assessment of Zhenyi Laodao was also accurate.</p><p>After being appointed the leader of the Tianxing Alliance, Zhenyi Laodao had been fair and just in his rewards and punishments, and had promoted talented younger cultivators. He truly deserved to be described as devoted and selfless.</p><p>Such selfless individuals are not uncommon in the cultivation world, but most are devoted only to the sects that raised them.</p><p>"Hehehe, perhaps Zhenyi Laodao is using a feigned strategy, making us think they intend to seize Blood Prison from us, while secretly gathering their forces and attacking us once our front lines are weak. The fruits of our past victories may be lost in an instant."</p><p>A voice echoed through the blood mist, the speaker's figure obscured.</p><p>Despite mentioning such dire consequences, their tone remained calm and unconcerned.</p><p>Jiang Chenzi laughed heartily, "But they have to pass Cang Hong Daoyou, who guards the front lines... And even if Zhenyi Laodao breaks through, we'll let them experience the bitter taste of misfortune when we return!"</p><p>"Alright, let's get down to business. Since our friends from the two-region alliance are willing to lend a hand, we can't show weakness. Everyone, assist me! If all goes well, we'll break the seal today."</p><p>Ye Laomo shouted, suddenly speeding up his actions.</p><p>The others fell silent and concentrated on assisting Ye Laomo.</p><p>Wuyagu Valley.</p><p>The opposing sides, separated by tens of thousands of miles, were working together to break the seal.</p><p>After several hours of continuous attacks, they finally opened a crack in the seal.</p><p>*Splash!*</p><p>A surge of blood gushed out from the crack, the stench of blood filling the air.</p><p>Qin Sang and the others frowned, covering their noses and mouths, and looking towards Tongyou Mojun and Dongyang Bo.</p><p>"According to the records, each blood wave connects to a sealed space. If we jump in, we will surely be scattered. Then, everyone, according to that fragmented map, find the innermost location marked on the map and gather there as quickly as possible.</p><p>"As long as we thwart Ye Laomo's scheme, there will be plenty of treasure-hunting opportunities later. I urge everyone to prioritize the overall situation and avoid any delay."</p><p>After transmitting this message, Tongyou Mojun conferred briefly with Dongyang Bo before leaping into the blood lake.</p><p>There was no need to compete for precedence.</p><p>Qin Sang was the last to go, summoning a magic banner for protection as she stepped into the blood lake, confronting a wave of blood.</p><p>The Golden Core cultivators stirred restlessly.</p><p>Only after the Yuan Ying masters disappeared into the blood lake did they dare to act, vying with each other to summon their treasures and jump in.</p><p>Once those cultivators disappeared as well, the area outside the blood lake was deserted.</p><p>More than half an hour later, a ripple suddenly appeared in the void, and a figure materialized in the shadows. Someone had arrived at this late hour.</p><p>This person was extremely cautious, observing for a long time before emerging from the shadows, confirming that no one else was present.</p><p>Anyone nearby who caught sight of this person's face would have been greatly surprised.</p><p>The newcomer was a young man, handsome and refined, none other than Gongliang Yu, the current Palace Master of Shangyuan Quiet Palace!</p><p>Shangyuan Quiet Palace is among the prominent sects, yet Gongliang Yu, its Palace Master, was only at the peak of the Golden Core stage. He wasn't qualified to participate in the Yuan Ying's plans, but his status made it easy for him to investigate the situation.</p><p>Gongliang Yu arrived late deliberately, yet his expression was somewhat urgent.</p><p>He flew to the surface of the blood lake, about to enter, when he suddenly remembered something and took an item from his sleeve—a three-inch-tall figurine.</p><p>The figurine seemed to be carved from wood, but its surface shone like jade, yet it didn't quite look like a wood carving, its material hard to discern.</p><p>The strangest thing was the figurine's head—smooth as a mirror, lacking any facial features. Its orientation could only be determined by one thing on its face.</p><p>That was a tiny yellow talisman affixed to the figurine's brow. Thin as gauze, it clung lightly yet firmly. Written in cinnabar, the talisman's characters flowed freely in a single stroke, a complex incantation.</p><p>Apart from this, the figurine was an ordinary faceless statue, emitting no discernible energy fluctuations.</p><p>Holding the figurine, Gongliang Yu wore a grave expression, his eyes filled with a mixture of fear and expectation.</p><p>He gently held the figurine in his palm.</p><p>Worried about accidentally uncovering the yellow paper on the figurine's face, Gongliang Yu's movements were extremely gentle.</p><p>Then, he took a jade pendant, wrapped in red string and vibrant green, from his pouch.</p>
