<h1>Chapter 1125: Release</h1><p>In the desolate waters, two figures stood facing each other on the surface of the water.</p><p>Bai's appearance was that of a refined corpse, his face stiff and rigid. As a refined corpse, Bai was already a top-tier Flying Night Rakshasa, just one step away from becoming a Corpse King. He gazed at Qin Sang, his expression growing increasingly solemn. Then, his shoulders twitched slightly, and his arms trembled as if warming up for battle. The corpse energy around him surged in response.</p><p>"Whoosh!"</p><p>A cold wind howled, and the water's surface could no longer remain calm. Though it was midday, with the sun shining brightly, as Bai unleashed the aura of a Flying Night Rakshasa, the temperature in the surrounding void plummeted, bringing with it a chilling cold. It was as if even the sunlight had dimmed.</p><p>"Crash!"</p><p>Suddenly, the corpse energy retracted, flowing back into Bai's body. Bai's flesh, like that of other refined corpses, was withered and thin, his skin a bluish-black hue. Faint traces of corpse energy flickered across its surface, giving off a metallic sheen, as hard as steel. Though this body appeared stiff and lifeless, it was incredibly agile and possessed powerful movement techniques. An ordinary cultivator would find a Flying Night Rakshasa extremely troublesome to deal with, let alone Bai, who was no ordinary Flying Night Rakshasa.</p><p>On the other side, Qin Sang's back sprouted phoenix wings. He, too, stood empty-handed, his fists clenched tightly. Having cultivated the "Heavenly Demon Body Refinement" to the peak of the third layer, Qin Sang's physical body was no weaker than that of a Flying Night Rakshasa. However, from the outside, his skin appeared no different from that of an ordinary person—fair and rosy. Yet, within this seemingly ordinary body lay astonishing explosive power.</p><p>"Whoosh!"</p><p>A fierce wind erupted.</p><p>Qin Sang and Bai vanished simultaneously.</p><p>"Splash!"</p><p>A massive wave surged into the sky.</p><p>Two figures reappeared within the wave, their fists colliding. Both trembled and were sent flying back several feet. Before they could steady themselves, they twisted their bodies and lunged at each other once more.</p><p>"Boom!"</p><p>It was unimaginable that pure physical combat could stir the winds and clouds, creating such a spectacular display. By now, the two were entangled, their movements almost impossible to discern. Only the dull thuds of their fists colliding could be heard, each strike resonating like thunder.</p><p>At their current level of cultivation, they possessed more than just this one technique. Yet, both had chosen to engage in physical combat.</p><p>Water splashed everywhere.</p><p>The entire body of water was thrown into chaos.</p><p>Corpse energy and the azure light of the phoenix wings intertwined.</p><p>They had completely let loose, focusing solely on their opponent.</p><p>Initially, Qin Sang, having rarely delved into the techniques of physical combat, was at a slight disadvantage due to his lack of experience. However, Bai had no hope of defeating him so quickly. As time passed, Bai deliberately guided Qin Sang to unleash his true potential, and Qin Sang grew increasingly composed.</p><p>His heavy fists and phoenix wings worked in perfect harmony.</p><p>His movements were like lightning, his fists like thunder.</p><p>Gradually, the two were evenly matched in offense and defense.</p><p>This was a rare occasion for Qin Sang—fighting without restraint, purely with his physical body, and against an opponent like Bai, who was his equal. He couldn't help but feel a sense of exhilarating release.</p><p>"Boom!"</p><p>After a fierce exchange, the two figures collided and then separated.</p><p>The corpse energy rippled.</p><p>Bai's figure plummeted, only to bounce back up the moment he touched the water's surface.</p><p>Qin Sang, on the other hand, flapped his phoenix wings violently, transforming into a streak of azure light that soared high into the sky. After circling once, he descended from above, his chest rising and falling slightly.</p><p>"Impressive! That body refinement technique of yours is truly remarkable," Bai said, his crimson eyes growing even more intense after the fierce battle.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Qin Sang paid no heed to Bai's words. His eyes remained fixed on Bai, as if he were a sworn enemy that had to be eliminated. He charged forward once more.</p><p>The shadow of Qin Sang's fist rapidly expanded in Bai's vision.</p><p>Seeing this, Bai silently observed Qin Sang for a moment, a flicker of understanding passing through his mind. Without a word, he raised his fist to meet the attack.</p><p>"Bang!"</p><p>Bai forcefully repelled Qin Sang, his figure flickering as he retreated dozens of feet. He then took out a Corpse Soul Pearl and, to Qin Sang's surprise, swallowed it whole. Immediately, the corpse energy around him churned, and a beast-like roar erupted from his throat.</p><p>In the next moment, Bai's appearance underwent a bizarre transformation.</p><p>His flesh twisted, his withered muscles clinging tightly to his bones.</p><p>Corpse energy condensed around his hands, and the nails of his ghostly claws grew rapidly, turning as black as ink and exuding a terrifying corpse poison. His bones cracked loudly, and his body instantly grew several inches taller.</p><p>At the same time, fangs sprouted from his mouth, and his appearance became even more menacing.</p><p>At this moment, Bai's appearance was almost as terrifying as that of a Corpse King from the Immortal Tomb.</p><p>Noticing Bai's transformation, a flicker of surprise passed through Qin Sang's eyes, but he showed no hesitation or fear. He launched another fierce attack.</p><p>"Whoosh!"</p><p>A flash of black light.</p><p>Bai's arms crossed, and before Qin Sang could discern his movements, ghostly claw shadows materialized in the void before him, leaving him with no room to dodge.</p><p>"Boom!"</p><p>The ghostly claw shadows engulfed Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang was sent flying backward. Though unharmed, his posture was somewhat disheveled.</p><p>Bai pressed his advantage relentlessly, his corpse energy churning as he closed the distance in an instant, moving even faster than Qin Sang. His ghostly claws were exceptionally sharp, as hard as magical treasures, and laced with deadly poison, posing a significant threat to Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang had no doubt that if those claws pierced him, they would breach his defenses and inflict severe injuries.</p><p>In an instant, ghostly claws filled the sky.</p><p>Bai, now in complete control, grew increasingly aggressive, showing no mercy.</p><p>As the battle reached this point, the commotion on the battlefield was no longer as intense as before. Qin Sang was forced into a defensive stance, surrounded by swirling corpse energy, his space to maneuver growing narrower. The situation looked grim.</p><p>Just then.</p><p>A roar erupted from within the corpse energy!</p><p>This roar seemed to carry the weight of long-suppressed emotions.</p><p>Accompanying it was the clear, resonant sound of a sword, its chime echoing through the heavens!</p><p>In the next moment, the rolling corpse energy was abruptly split apart by a sword beam.</p><p>The sword beam was blinding, filled with an endless sharpness.</p><p>Qin Sang stood tall, bathed in the sword light, like a divine sword itself!</p><p>The Ebony Sword hung inverted, not yet slashing down, but the sword's intent alone was enough to obliterate the countless ghostly claw shadows.</p><p>This was the power of sword intent.</p><p>With a single sword strike, nothing could stand in its way.</p><p>It cleansed the heavens and earth, bringing clarity to the universe!</p><p>Seeing this, Bai was also astonished.</p><p>There was no need to continue the spar. He retracted his corpse energy, reverting to his previous form, and cupped his hands in a gesture of respect. "Congratulations, fellow Daoist, on comprehending sword intent!"</p><p>Qin Sang sheathed his spirit sword and exhaled slowly, his expression serious. "Thank you."</p><p>On the path of cultivation, one ultimately walks alone. Friends and family cannot keep pace, and after a single session of seclusion, they may already have turned to dust.</p><p>Senior Sister Qingjun's approach was remarkably carefree.</p><p>Apart from oneself, all others are but passing travelers.</p><p>Qin Sang had long understood this truth and had experienced much.</p><p>However, the passing of two mentors and friends before his eyes had inevitably left a mark.</p><p>Bai could naturally sense this, but as a fellow seeker of the Dao, he understood that Qin Sang did not need his guidance. By proposing a spar, he had given Qin Sang the opportunity to vent his emotions.</p><p>After the battle, the pent-up frustration in Qin Sang's heart had dissipated.</p><p>However, Bai had not expected that Qin Sang would be able to comprehend sword intent through this, advancing further in the path of the sword!</p><p>Qin Sang's aura calmed as he landed before Bai. Recalling Bai's earlier transformation, he asked curiously, "Fellow Daoist, have you fully comprehended the Corpse Soul Pearl?"</p><p>Bai shook his head. "I can only borrow some of the Corpse King's power from the Corpse Soul Pearl. I am still far from fully comprehending it."</p>
