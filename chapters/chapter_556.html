<h1>Chapter 549: Autumn Dusk White</h1><p>These weren't the most dangerous aspects.</p><p>What made Qin Sang most wary was the extremely volatile spiritual energy here, thrown into chaos by the surging spiritual tide.  The spiritual essence of heaven and earth was in utter disarray.</p><p>Just then, a loud "bang" came from behind, followed by cries of alarm.</p><p>Qin Sang turned to see a Foundation Establishment early-stage cultivator fall flat on their face, blushing crimson with shame.  This wasn't an isolated incident; several others stumbled and struggled to regain their footing.</p><p>Mostly independent cultivators.</p><p>At this point, Chen Kuiqing chuckled mischievously, warning, "Fellow Daoists, be advised! Under the influence of the spiritual tide, the spiritual energy here isn't as stable as it is in the Inner Lands. Don't absorb too much spiritual energy at once, or you won't be able to refine it fast enough.  This will lead to internal spiritual energy disorder and temporary loss of fighting ability. If you're engaged in combat on the Ancient Immortal battlefield, make sure you have plenty of spirit stones."</p><p>That scoundrel didn't say that sooner!</p><p>The uninformed independent cultivators glared at him. After enjoying the spectacle, Chen Kuiqing instructed a junior disciple to lead the way, then handed Qin Sang a jade slip.  "Brother Qin, this is a route map. The Xuanlu Guard should be arriving soon; you should encounter them along the way."</p><p>"Thank you, Brother Chen."</p><p>Qin Sang showed the contents of the jade slip to everyone, looked around, and suggested, "Fellow Daoists, if you don't have other destinations, let's form a battle formation and travel together.  If we encounter cloud beasts, we can assist each other."</p><p>After exchanging glances, everyone agreed.</p><p>Qin Sang, with his superior cultivation and experience fighting the Tianxing League, efficiently organized the group and set off towards Xuanlu Pass.</p><p>The spiritual tide raged directly overhead, forcing everyone to fly at low altitude.</p><p>Even in its waning stages, the spiritual tide still possessed the power to sweep across the land. From time to time, streams of spiritual energy would descend from the sky, easily gouging enormous craters into the ground.</p><p>The sheer power was terrifying.</p><p>Surrounded by the others, Qin Sang's role was to constantly monitor the sky for changes in the spiritual tide and surrounding movements, adjusting their course to avoid danger.  Their journey proved surprisingly smooth.</p><p>Most fortunately, they didn't encounter any cloud beast herds.</p><p>Proceeding relentlessly towards Xuanlu Pass, after a while, someone at the front called out, "Daoist Qin, there's a dark cloud ahead, heading this way."</p><p>Qin Sang had already seen it. After a careful observation, his expression relaxed. "No need to panic, it's the Xuanlu Guard."</p><p>A cheer erupted from the group. The appearance of the Xuanlu Guard signified that the cloud beasts ahead had been cleared.</p><p>Even in the wilderness, there was no cause for concern regarding the Xuanlu Guard's intentions. They arrived via the Upper Yuan Quiet Palace's teleportation array, under the Palace's guarantee.</p><p>Qin Sang signaled the group to continue onward. As they approached, they heard a voice from within the dark cloud: "The cloud beasts ahead have been cleared.  Fellow Daoists, proceed as you please."</p><p>Before the words were fully spoken, someone within the cloud exclaimed joyfully, "Is that Junior Brother Qin?"</p><p>The voice was familiar. Qin Sang immediately recognized it and stepped forward, surprised. "Senior Brother Mu, when did you return from the Turbulent Island Waters?"</p><p>It was Mu Yifeng.</p><p>A gap opened in the dark cloud, revealing two figures. One was Mu Yifeng, the other a graceful and refined young man.</p><p>"Junior Brother Qin, after you left, I took over your captaincy. Unfortunately, while entangled with the Tianxing League's villains, I suffered another serious injury and was sent back to the sect for treatment. After recovering, seeing that a truce had been reached in the Turbulent Island Waters, I didn't find it interesting.  Knowing the spiritual tide was nearing its end, I came straight to the Ancient Immortal battlefield."</p><p>Mu Yifeng scratched his head, his tone apologetic.</p><p>Qin Sang had led the group for years without major incidents.  Within days of entrusting command to Mu Yifeng, the Tianxing League ambushed them, nearly costing the lives of all his subordinates.</p><p>If it weren't for Mu Yifeng's desperate efforts to bring everyone back alive, he'd be utterly ashamed to face Qin Sang, his savior.</p><p>After hearing the whole story, Qin Sang understood it wasn't Mu Yifeng's fault.</p><p>That he risked his own life to bring everyone back safely was remarkable, a testament to his loyalty and courage.</p><p>Qin Sang was even more astonished by Mu Yifeng's cultivation – he was now at the Nascent Soul stage!</p><p>In just a few years?</p><p>Mu Yifeng's previous near-fatal injury had resulted in a significant increase in cultivation; this injury had directly led to a breakthrough to Nascent Soul.</p><p>"Senior Brother Mu, I've heard of breakthroughs achieved through killing, and breakthroughs achieved through combat, but I've never heard of breakthroughs achieved through serious injuries!  Is this some form of 'Injury Dao' you've discovered?"</p><p>Qin Sang teased.</p><p>Mu Yifeng laughed heartily, "I don't know why, but every time I'm in bed, I have a sudden flash of inspiration. I'm thinking about using a 'desperate gambit' to achieve alchemy.  Qin Shixiong, don't encourage me!  By the way…"</p><p>Mu Yifeng’s expression turned serious. He pointed to the young man beside him, "Qin Shixiong, this is Qiu Mu Bai, Qiu Shixiong. You haven't met before."</p><p>"While we haven't met, your reputation precedes you, Qin Shixiong," Qiu Mu Bai bowed politely, his tone amiable.  "Meeting you today, it's truly as the legends say!"</p><p>It's him!</p><p>A jolt of recognition shot through Qin Sang's mind. He remembered who this person was.</p><p>This was the kind of inner-circle disciple who rarely appeared in public, unknown to the outside world, yet surrounded by countless legends within their sect.</p><p>Qiu Mu Bai wasn't a disciple of a Nascent Soul cultivator, yet his status was even higher. He was permitted by the Nascent Soul cultivator Dongyang Bo to cultivate on the main peak of Shao Hua Mountain!</p><p>Qiu Mu Bai had entered the sect over a decade before Qin Sang, chosen by Dongyang Bo even as an infant.</p><p>It was said Qiu Mu Bai could have achieved alchemy long ago, but for some reason, he remained at the False Core stage, honing his skills, and delaying his breakthrough.</p><p>"Greetings, Qiu Shixiong!"</p><p>Dongyang Bo never formally accepted Qiu Mu Bai as a disciple, so they still addressed each other as equals, according to sect rules.</p><p>Even Foundation Establishment cultivators treated a Nascent Soul cultivator’s disciple with respect. Qin Sang, naturally, showed the appropriate courtesy.</p><p>At first glance, Qiu Mu Bai seemed like a refined gentleman, radiating a gentle aura. However, Qin Sang was unsure of his character and observed him cautiously.</p><p>After some conversation, it turned out Qiu Mu Bai, after a period of secluded cultivation, had come to the Ancient Immortal Battlefield as a Xuanlu Guard, and this was his team's mission to eliminate cloud beasts.</p><p>"We have duties to attend to and can't delay.  Qin Sang, perhaps you should go ahead. We can chat again when we return to Xuanlu Pass," Qiu Mu Bai said.</p><p>Qin Sang thought for a moment, then took out his Xuanlu Guard token.  "Qiu Shixiong, I'm on my way to report for duty at Xuanlu Guard. Since I've encountered a Xuanlu Guard patrol eliminating cloud beasts, I feel it's my duty to help. I'd like to join you two Shixiongs."</p><p>"Qin Shixiong's willingness to help is most welcome!"</p><p>Both Qiu Mu Bai and the other were overjoyed and immediately agreed.</p><p>Qin Sang had his own reasons.</p><p>Qiu Mu Bai was Dongyang Bo's most favored disciple and certainly knew him very well.</p><p>After returning from Ziwei Palace, Qin Sang would have to report to Dongyang Bo alone.</p><p>Getting closer to Qiu Mu Bai and learning about Dongyang Bo's temperament would allow him to be better prepared.</p><p>He was not only a future master but also a Nascent Soul cultivator who held life and death in his hands.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't dare hope for Dongyang Bo's favor, but he didn't want to be ignorant, commit a taboo, and anger this powerful cultivator.</p>
