<h1>Chapter 1645: The Lotus Seat</h1><p>The medicinal garden is a story for another time.</p><p>The deceased’s belongings are the real prize from this expedition.</p><p>With a cursory glance, Qin Sang discovered several items that greatly piqued his interest.</p><p>Qin Sang took out some spirit stones to restore his true energy, sharing them with his physical body. While recovering his energy, he took out the deceased's pouch and carefully examined its contents.</p><p>The number of treasures, elixirs, talismans, and otherworldly items inside was surprisingly small, even meager, inconsistent with his cultivation level.</p><p>For many years, the deceased had dedicated himself to cultivating the Gu King, refining his poisonous techniques, and managing the intense poison within his body.  Later, after achieving mastery over the Gu King and obtaining the Red Profound Ancient Tree, he focused on cultivating the Innate Wooden Man Stele and preparing to open the Unseen Immortal Sect's hidden legacy, leaving him little time for anything else.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>Qin Sang's consciousness activated the pouch, releasing several beams of light.</p><p>He reached out and grabbed a wooden box.</p><p>Opening the box revealed a mass of green light.  His consciousness swept over it, and the method for refining the Heavenly Linglong was imprinted onto Qin Sang's mind. This secret technique, jealously guarded by the Wood Aspect Hall, was finally his.</p><p>The refinement method was exceptionally complete, even including notes left by past masters of the Wood Aspect Hall.</p><p>Upon seeing it firsthand, he realized refining the Heavenly Linglong wasn't as easy as the deceased had made it sound.</p><p>The refiner must first possess profound expertise in the art of alchemy, and their own cultivation must be no lower than the late Nascent Soul stage.</p><p>This treasure aids in achieving the Transformation stage; its value is self-evident.</p><p>However, even if someone managed to refine a Heavenly Linglong and offered it for trade, they would still need to weigh the gains and losses carefully, highlighting the immense difficulty of its creation.</p><p>Refining the Heavenly Linglong is no overnight task, and the necessary materials are incredibly rare heavenly treasures. Even Qin Sang, a master alchemist, didn't recognize several of the ingredients.</p><p>The other beams of light contained jade slips, some detailing the Wood Aspect Hall's alchemic legacy.</p><p>During the Unseen Immortal Sect's heyday, the Wood Aspect Hall was renowned for its alchemy.  This legacy would undoubtedly be a tremendous boon to Qin Sang, allowing him to make significant strides in alchemy once he had the time to dedicate himself to it—a delightful surprise.</p><p>Unbeknownst to him, he now possessed the alchemic and artifact refinement legacies of the Unseen Immortal Sect.</p><p>Consulting the contents of the jade slips, Qin Sang found records of those unfamiliar materials.  He could locate some of them with diligent searching, while others would rely on pure luck.</p><p>One material in particular, a celestial object called Moon Laurel Celestial Dew, was exceptionally rare, originating from the Celestial Cinnamon Secret Realm of the Heaven Together Hall, accessible only once every few hundred years.</p><p>The deceased had failed to find the Moon Laurel Celestial Dew within the Wood Aspect Hall.</p><p>Now that the celestial hall had ascended, the secret realm was inaccessible; where could he possibly find it?</p><p>The Heavenly Linglong refinement method omitted this information, deliberately concealed by the deceased; otherwise, the Crying Spirit Cave Master would not have been so optimistic.</p><p>There were exceptions, however. An Unseen Immortal Sect Nascent Soul cultivator, while traveling in the outer reaches of the Storm Belt, unexpectedly discovered an ancient cultivator's hidden legacy and obtained a small vial of it.</p><p>Such a substance might still exist in this world, hidden within some unknown ancient cultivator's legacy.</p><p>Qin Sang possessed five elemental spiritual roots, rendering the Heavenly Linglong useless to him.  Still, seeing all this, he couldn't help but feel a pang of disappointment.  Without the complete materials, the value of this secret technique was greatly diminished.  He needed to carefully consider how to maximize his profits.</p><p>The deceased had not only concealed this information from the Crying Spirit Cave Master.</p><p>Qin Sang shifted his gaze to the last beam of light and gently beckoned it.</p><p>The light landed in his hand, revealing a crystal-clear jade orb. About the size of a baby's fist, it emitted a pure, vibrant green light, shimmering like a night pearl.</p><p>The orb was a Heavenly Linglong!</p><p>However, this Heavenly Linglong was an unfinished core.</p><p>Qin Sang examined it closely, his gaze penetrating the green light to reveal flaws within the jade.</p><p>The surface wasn't smooth; countless tiny voids dotted its surface. These were too small to detect without careful perception.</p><p>Each void was inscribed with countless intricate restrictions.  Their complexity was unparalleled in Qin Sang's experience; few treasures in this world could compare, and this was only the first layer.</p><p>The Heavenly Linglong could be considered as five nested jade orbs.</p><p>All five layers possessed comparable intricacy.</p><p>Upon completion, the five jade orbs must be fused into one, their energies perfectly balanced and without conflict.</p><p>Closer examination revealed that the Heavenly Linglong wasn't entirely solid, existing between reality and illusion. It could be merged with any type of natal treasure.</p><p>Years ago, the Wood Aspect Hall master refined this core and placed it in the treasure chamber, nurturing it with the Hall's unique alchemic formation.  Later, a great war erupted, the master perished, and the treasure was left behind in the Wood Aspect Hall, gathering dust and unknown to others.</p><p>Upon discovering it, the deceased was overjoyed.  While the core was far from complete, at least he no longer had to worry about the Moon Laurel Celestial Dew.</p><p>Even if he obtained more than one, he wouldn't easily give them away, not to the Cave Master of Weeping Spirits.</p><p>Just the wood-attribute hall's refining techniques and the Sky-Lingering Spirit Embryo were worth using a Boiling Snow Pill, let alone that Qin Sang had paid almost nothing.</p><p>Qin Sang repeatedly said he was lucky, carefully storing the treasures, activating his spatial pouch, and then three more beams of light flew out.</p><p>A token, a wooden armor, and a piece of dead wood.</p><p>The token was the Wood Attribute Token.</p><p>After soul-searching the Cave Master of Weeping Spirits, Qin Sang learned that the Five Attribute Tokens seemed to have a significant role on Emperor's Mandate Mountain.  Unsure of the details, he stored it away for later observation.</p><p>The wooden armor was frozen by the Ice Soul divine light. After the strange-faced man fell, it fell into Qin Sang's hands.</p><p>This treasure was undoubtedly a powerful defensive artifact, but it needed to have the strange-faced man's aura removed and be carefully refined before use.  He put it aside with the dead wood.</p><p>The dead wood was from the Crimson Profound Ancient Tree.</p><p>When the strange-faced man self-detonated his spirit wood body, the spirit tree shattered, but its essence remained, leaving behind a fragment. However, the spirit tree had been refined by the strange-faced man for many years, tainted with his aura, and could only be used for refining artifacts from now on.</p><p>Qin Sang was more interested in the strange-faced man's abilities, his spirit wood body and the poison needles.</p><p>Continuing the search, he finally found a piece of dead wood in the spatial pouch.</p><p>The dead wood was less than a foot long, about the thickness of a wrist, completely black, clearly a completely rotten piece of wood.  His divine sense detected nothing unusual.</p><p>Elsewhere, Qin Sang wouldn't have given it a second glance.</p><p>But upon carefully searching with his divine sense and touching a barely perceptible point of light at the wood's core, he discovered a hidden world!</p><p>The dead wood contained several sets of wood-attribute hall inheritance techniques, likely left behind by a descendant of the hall.</p><p>The inheritance included the strange-faced man's fundamental cultivation method, the "Wood Emperor Strategy," and the corresponding abilities, as well as the "Posterior Heaven Wooden Man Stele" that Qin Sang had been seeking!</p><p>To cultivate the abilities, one needs to find spirit wood and cultivate a spirit wood body, allowing one to be as strong as the strange-faced man, comparable to a physical cultivator.</p><p>In a forest rich in wood spirit energy, one's body becomes like a divine stele, rooted in place, their aura connected to all the trees, absorbing wood spirit energy, bringing about comprehensive improvement, greatly enhancing strength and recovery capabilities.</p><p>Qin Sang secretly marveled, "No wonder the strange-faced man was so difficult to deal with after his transformation."</p><p>However, the strange-faced man's ability was only minorly accomplished.  At the peak of mastery, there are many incredible abilities, but it is difficult to reach the peak level in the Nascent Soul stage.</p><p>Furthermore, the improvement from the Posterior Heaven Wooden Man Stele is also related to the quality of the spirit wood.</p><p>After reading this, Qin Sang subconsciously looked at his external avatar.</p><p>Back then, the Performance Dao Tree could make Bai lose control. What spirit tree has a higher rank than the Performance Dao Tree?</p><p>However, to refine the Performance Dao Tree into a spirit wood body and incorporate it into himself, he must restore the Performance Dao Tree to its original form and abandon his external avatar—a difficult choice.</p><p>The "Posterior Heaven Wooden Man Stele" has great potential, improving himself, but the external avatar has the ability to die and be reborn, and he has already spent a great deal of energy and resources on it.</p><p>Refining a spirit wood body is not a simple matter.</p><p>The external avatar is about to break through to the late Nascent Soul stage; its potential might not be inferior to the spirit wood body, and the ability to die and be reborn is a divine ability that cannot be abandoned.</p><p>Although Qin Sang has late Nascent Soul cultivation, he doesn't dare to claim invincibility.</p><p>Sighing softly, he decided to put off these troublesome matters for now, and stored away the dead wood.  He then took out a jade slip.</p><p>The jade slip contained the "Gu Scripture" from Wan Poison Mountain, a complete copy.</p><p>The latter half of the Gu Scripture doesn't record the method of cultivating Gu Kings, but based on the descriptions, it's clear that the Gu King and the Gu Scripture are of the same origin.</p><p>The Gu King must be the core secret of Wan Poison Mountain. It's unknown how the strange-faced man obtained it and even managed to steal a significant part of Wan Poison Mountain's inheritance.</p><p>No wonder Wan Poison Mountain hated him to the bone.</p><p>The latter part of the "Gu Scripture" records several poison path abilities, with the "Heavenly Annihilation Soul-Shattering Needles" being the strongest.</p><p>The name suggests that once the poison needle is released, it annihilates all living beings and ghosts between heaven and earth. The ambition is immense, and its power matches the name.</p><p>Cultivating this ability requires a powerful poison as a catalyst, but when refining the poison, one must not be hasty, otherwise, the poison will invade the inner organs, and before one achieves the ability, they will die first.</p><p>The strange-faced man undoubtedly used the Gu King to cultivate this ability.</p><p>Qin Sang moved his gaze from the Gu Scripture to the demonic fire floating in the cave, his expression thoughtful.</p><p>After the Gu King devoured its master, the blood-red color on its body gradually faded, almost returning to its original jade-white color, but its ferocious nature didn't lessen; instead, it intensified.</p><p>He didn't know how to subdue the Gu King and had been using the demonic fire as a cage to imprison it. Even after reading the "Gu Scripture" and the strange-faced man's collection, he couldn't find a way to subdue it.</p><p>After a moment's thought, Qin Sang understood.</p><p>Wandu Mountain dared to reveal this information to him, certain that even if he killed the grotesque-faced man, he wouldn't be able to subdue the Gu King, and would have to make a deal with Wandu Mountain.  The Gu King's poisonous light is extraordinary, and its inherent rank is extremely high, making it invaluable.</p><p>"What will Wandu Mountain offer in exchange?"</p><p>Qin Sang pondered, but didn't have high expectations.  If possible, he preferred to subdue the Gu King himself and control this powerful weapon.  At the very least, he wanted to consult Ghost Mother before considering a trade.</p><p>But he needed to enter Emperor's Gift Mountain, which wasn't a long-term solution.</p><p>Qin Sang stared at the Gu King for a while, his thoughts stirring. The fat silkworm's poison pearl could counteract the Heaven-Severing Soul-Shattering Divine Needle; could he use the poison pearl to suppress the Gu King's ferocity?  For the time he spent at Wuxiang Immortal Sect, making it obedient would suffice.</p><p>Thinking it through, he acted. Qin Sang immersed his mind into his dantian, activating the poison pearl.</p><p>Seven-colored霞光 burst forth from his dantian, and the poison pearl slowly flew out towards the Gu King.</p><p>Sensing the pearl's aura, the Gu King's fluttering wings suddenly stopped. It turned, its blood-red eyes fixated on the pearl, as if facing a formidable enemy, then emitted a more urgent and shrill buzzing sound.</p><p>"Good, it's reacting..."</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes lit up. After a moment's thought, he directly sent the poison pearl through the demonic fire, placing it before the Gu King.</p><p>'Swish!'  A stream of poisonous light immediately shot out.</p><p>Qin Sang, ultimately not daring to be too careless, controlled the poison pearl to evade, only allowing the edge of the poisonous light to touch it.</p><p>Suddenly, the poison pearl dissipated into a mist, the poisonous light passing directly through it.  Then, the poison pearl reformed, unharmed.</p><p>Qin Sang checked it thoroughly, relieved, and guided the poison pearl towards the Gu King.</p><p>The Gu King's wings vibrated wildly, spraying poisonous light, but it couldn't hit Qin Sang, nor destroy the poison pearl.  Instead, the demonic fire gradually compressed its movement, forcing the poison pearl closer.</p><p>Soon, the poison pearl floated above the Gu King's head.</p><p>'Whoosh!'  The poison pearl transformed into a stream of anti-poison light, poised to engulf the Gu King.</p><p>The next moment, the Gu King was surrounded by the light, its blurry shape still visible through the luminous mist.  However, once the light neared the Gu King, it could advance no further. The Gu King spread its wings, its body emitting a faint bloody light, forming a protective aura of poison, and it swiftly escaped the light.</p><p>The attempt failed, but Qin Sang's face wasn't dejected; instead, he was surprised, as if he had discovered something unexpected.  He continued to control the poison pearl, trying the same tactic again.</p><p>He tried dozens of times, all ending in failure.  Yet, the unusual glint in Qin Sang's eyes grew stronger, as he made a startling discovery.  Each time the poison pearl enveloped the Gu King, Qin Sang felt that the pearl's power seemed to intensely crave the Gu King, intending to devour it!</p><p>After so many attempts, Qin Sang was certain this feeling wasn't a delusion. He remembered that after the fat silkworm's fourth transformation, it could directly devour Gu insects. He had cultivated some, allowing it to feast. The Gu King's cultivation method was similar to those insects.  The poison pearl extracted from it had inherited that devouring ability!</p><p>"If the poison pearl devours the Gu King, could it continue to strengthen?"  Qin Sang considered this possibility, his eyes suddenly burning with eagerness.</p><p>The anti-poison ability was somewhat narrow in scope, but once used, it demonstrated remarkable effectiveness. Qin Sang always believed external objects were inferior to oneself. The poison pearl had a close connection to him, essentially a part of himself.  If the pearl continuously devoured poisons, what kind of transformation would occur in the future?</p><p>The Gu King's intelligence was low; in terms of potential, it was clearly inferior to the poison pearl.</p><p>The problem was that the poison pearl couldn't subdue the Gu King. How could he make the Gu King willingly submit to being devoured?</p><p>Qin Sang pondered for a long time, reviewing various classics and studying the "Gu Scripture" again, until his true energy was almost restored and it was time to leave, yet he still hadn't found a solution.</p><p>Suddenly, a flash of inspiration struck him; he slapped his hand.  Since the art of insect control wouldn't work, why not start with its master?</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't sure what methods the grotesque-faced man used to suppress the Gu King during its cultivation. But he knew the grotesque-faced man's fundamental skill was the "Wood Emperor Strategy," which harmonized with the Wood Dao.  The Gu King often stayed by the grotesque-faced man's side; perhaps it feared this aura.</p><p>Before letting his avatar try, Qin Sang withdrew his mind from his Purple Mansion, returning to his primordial spirit.  Since merging with Yunyouzi's scorched wood true spirit, the Yunyou Sword, never used before, made its first appearance!</p><p>A flash from his brow.  A cyan-blue sword light instantly illuminated the cave!</p><p>"Old friend, it's your turn..."  Qin Sang said with mixed feelings, a touch of sadness, and pointed at the Gu King.</p><p>The Yunyou Sword, imbued with the ten great sacred trees, was considered a treasure of the Wood Dao.  Qin Sang wasn't using the Yunyou Sword to kill the Gu King—he didn't want to damage the true spirit—but to activate its sword intent, using the supremely pure treasure of the Wood Dao, combined with the strongest sword intent, to overawe the Gu King.</p><p>If successful, he would retrieve the poison pearl, the Gu King, and the Yunyou Sword into his body. This state could be maintained until the poison pearl devoured the Gu King!</p>
