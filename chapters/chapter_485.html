<h1>Chapter 478: Ambush</h1><p>Although he failed to refine the corpse, the gains were substantial.  This experience gave Qin Sang a thorough understanding of the False Core Realm, ensuring he'd be more composed during his next attempt.</p><p>Once the Earthlyç…ž Qi dissipated, Qin Sang carefully erased any lingering traces of his presence, left the plaza, and stepped onto the stone path.</p><p>Unexpectedly, after so much had happened, there were less than two quarters of an hour left before he had to leave Skyreach Peak.</p><p>Time was too short. Qin Sang retraced his steps, deciding against searching for the Heavenly March Alliance cultivator. He planned to leave this restriction-laden area quickly, return to the outer canyon, and gather more Star Essence Stones.</p><p>The Snow Spirit Lotus and Iris were his top priority; they absolutely could not fall into someone else's hands.</p><p>The surrounding restrictions had been somewhat altered by the spatial storm unleashed by the Stargazer Elder. Fortunately, these changes weren't significant and remained within his grasp.</p><p>After walking some distance, Qin Sang found a sea of fire conjured by restrictions. He threw all of the elegant young man's belongings into it, watching as they were consumed by the flames.</p><p>Back on the path, Qin Sang finally had the leisure to check his own condition.</p><p>His fight with the elegant young man had been relatively effortless, and he hadn't sustained any injuries.</p><p>However, due to his reliance on the Cold Gold Sword, repeatedly clashing it against the elegant young man's magical tool, the sword's spirit had been damaged, its luster slightly dimmed.</p><p>The damage wasn't severe; a day of refinement would restore it.</p><p>After a moment of thought, Qin Sang put away the Cold Gold Sword and retrieved the long-unused Ten Yama Banners.</p><p>These ghostly banners had been gathering dust.  Since the start of the war in the Chaotic Isles, Qin Sang had shelved them, never using them again. Now, years later, upon taking them in hand, he sensed an eager and excited emotion emanating from the main spirits within the banners.</p><p>Qin Sang smiled faintly and channeled his spiritual power, raising the Ten Yama Banners.</p><p>His cultivation was far superior to what it had been, and using these tools was much easier.  They would be more than sufficient for protection until he left Skyreach Peak.</p><p>Ten small ghost banners revolved around Qin Sang, the surging Yin Qi suppressed around his body, forming a cloud of ghostly mist.</p><p>Before long, Qin Sang reached the end of the stone path. He glanced back with a touch of sentimentality, then continued without pause, his pace gradually increasing.</p><p>He traversed the densely restricted area without incident. Ahead, two enormous black stones appeared, resembling two black tigers lying in wait, imposing like gate guardians.</p><p>Qin Sang had a strong impression of these black stones.  Seeing them signified that the path ahead was less dangerous, and he could begin collecting Star Essence Stones.</p><p>Looking up at the pitch-black sky dotted with a few points of light, Qin Sang noted that most of the Star Essence Stones had already merged with the restrictions, leaving very few to collect.</p><p>'I'll go a bit further,' Qin Sang thought to himself, quickening his pace as he approached the black stones.</p><p>Just as he was about to pass between the two "Black Tiger Stones," a sudden jolt of alarm shot through his heart, followed by an unusually fierce gust of wind from above.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression changed drastically. He looked up sharply and saw a massive stone tablet plummeting from the top of the left black stone!</p><p>The tablet descended like a thunderbolt, heavy as a mountain, suppressing everything beneath it.</p><p>The square tablet, inscribed with the three characters "Mountain Shaker Tablet," radiated a heavy, ochre-yellow aura. Though seemingly cumbersome, it moved with surprising speed.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, Qin Sang's figure was engulfed by the ochre-yellow aura, his vision completely dominated by the giant tablet.</p><p>Even before the tablet arrived, the ochre-yellow aura exerted a terrifying pressure, firmly locking Qin Sang in place.</p><p>Overwhelmed by an immense force, Qin Sang was slammed to the ground, his feet creating two deep craters.</p><p>His eyes widened, bones creaking throughout his body as he trembled. He was completely immobilized, barely able to maintain an upright posture, nearly crushed flat beneath the descending tablet.</p><p>'A Talisman Treasure!' Qin Sang cried out inwardly. Only a Talisman Treasure possessed such overwhelming power.</p><p>The ochre-yellow aura of the Mountain Shaker Tablet obscured Qin Sang's view, preventing him from seeing the attacker's face. However, it was almost certainly the Heavenly March Alliance cultivator he had encountered earlier.</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't expected that, instead of him seeking trouble, the other party would come to him first. Moreover, the attacker seemed to have known his route and prepared the Talisman Treasure ambush in advance.</p><p>Elder Jing had masked his aura during their previous encounter, so he shouldn't have been discovered. Or should he?</p><p>Doubt flickered in Qin Sang's mind, but the situation didn't allow for much thought. Fortunately, he was always cautious and had already prepared the Ten Yama Banners for protection.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>The Mountain Shaker Tablet was inches away, close enough for Qin Sang to see the fine details of its inscriptions.</p><p>'Woosh!'</p><p>Yin Qi billowed.</p><p>The Yama Banners expanded in the wind, instantly growing into enormous flags nearly twice Qin Sang's height.</p><p>The ten banners were planted in the ground, forming a flag array.</p><p>In an instant, the space between the black stones transformed into a ghostly domain, filled with eerie gloom and the wails of phantoms.</p><p>Then, in the center of the array, Yin Qi churned, and black ghostfire erupted skyward. The intensely powerful ghostfire dispersed the overwhelming ochre-yellow aura, coalescing into a single force that firmly resisted the Mountain Shaker Tablet.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The Mountain Shaker Tablet collided with the ghostfire.</p><p>The Ten Yama Banners trembled slightly but remained firmly planted.</p><p>The Mountain Shaker Tablet stalled in mid-air, unable to descend further.</p><p>Qin Sang finally saw the attacker's face.</p><p>Standing on the edge of the black stone above, a man in ochre-yellow armor looked down.  He wore a large helmet of the same color, only his features visible.</p><p>The Mountain Shaker Tablet was blocked.</p><p>The armored cultivator's eyes widened in surprise. He clearly hadn't anticipated that his carefully planned ambush, employing even a Talisman Treasure, would be so easily countered.</p><p>"It's you!" Qin Sang snorted coldly, finally recognizing the man.</p><p>This was the expert the Heavenly March Alliance had dispatched to this area a year ago. Within a year, he had established a formidable reputation, several experts from the Minor Cold Region falling prey to him.</p><p>The armor he wore was not merely decorative; it was a complete set of magical tools. Each piece seemed to have a mystical connection to the others, their combined power far exceeding that of ordinary top-grade magical tools.</p><p>Unaware of the man's name, Qin Sang and the others referred to him as the Yellow-Armored Man.</p><p>Qin Sang had never fought the Yellow-Armored Man and thus hadn't recognized him earlier.  However, he had a strong impression of him, considering him one of the most formidable opponents he needed to avoid encountering outside.</p><p>"So it's the renowned Shadowless Sword. No wonder there's been such a commotion, and you're still alive to tell the tale," the Yellow-Armored Man said, a hint of mockery in his voice as he spoke of Qin Sang's moniker.</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly understood.  The effects of the spatial storm were greater than he'd imagined, likely causing disturbances in the entire canyon's restrictions and attracting the Yellow-Armored Man.</p><p>He wondered what reward the Heavenly March Alliance had promised, surmising it wouldn't be any less valuable than Stargazer Island.</p><p>Using the Spirit Locking Bracelet to collect Star Essence Stones one by one was inefficient, especially in such a dangerous place as the canyon, where it restricted movement.</p><p>Ambushing and robbing opponents of their Star Essence Stones was the fastest method. No wonder the Yellow-Armored Man was tempted.</p>
