<h1>Chapter 637: Black Wind Valley</h1><p>Cui Xuanzi glanced back into the main hall. Seeing Qin Sang seemingly unconcerned, his expression shifted several times before he finally refrained from saying anything, his gaze darkening as he looked towards the mountain gate.</p><p>The protective mountain formation appeared, causing the approaching figures to halt their advance and land on a tall peak outside the Five Insects Gate.  Men and women alike were revealed.</p><p>Some, like Cui Xuanzi, wore no extra adornments.</p><p>But most were similar to the priests of the Yi Hui Village, their faces and bodies adorned with spirit markings and various bone and tooth ornaments.</p><p>Cui Xuanzi's face grew darker with each figure he saw.</p><p>Finally, all the figures had landed, facing off against the Five Insects Gate from across the protective formation.</p><p>These individuals were clearly divided into two factions, standing behind a thin, elderly man and a seductive woman, but their goal was the same: to attack the Five Insects Gate.</p><p>Both the elderly man and the seductive woman were late-stage Foundation Establishment cultivators, their auras suggesting they were close to the False Core realm. Individually, they were no match for Cui Xuanzi, a False Core cultivator, but if they attacked together, Cui Xuanzi would be forced to retreat.</p><p>At this moment, a figure rushed towards the main hall, the junior disciple, Tong.</p><p>He stole a glance inside, then looked at Cui Xuanzi with a questioning expression.  Seeing Cui Xuanzi subtly shake his head, Tong's face fell. He urgently said, “Senior Brother, Lei Gui the Thunder Ghost from Jing Lei Village and the old hag from Bai Hua Palace have arrived. Several others are lurking behind them; I’ve never seen them before. They must be reinforcements. It seems they are determined to break the agreement left by our master and seize Black Wind Valley…”</p><p>“I already see them.”</p><p>Cui Xuanzi coldly snorted. “However, Junior Brother Tong, do you think those are all of them?”</p><p>Tong was startled.  Cui Xuanzi raised his wooden staff and pointed south towards the Five Insects Gate.</p><p>South of the Five Insects Gate lay the Qing Yi River, resembling a jade belt. The morning sun was rising, and the mist on the river had not yet dispersed.</p><p>Tong stared intently.  In the misty riverbank, he saw shadowy figures, almost invisible unless one looked closely.</p><p>Downstream from the Qing Yi River was the Bear Mountain region.</p><p>Upon seeing this, Tong immediately understood who was hiding there.</p><p>“Those ungrateful brutes!”</p><p>Tong gritted his teeth. “The peace of Bear Mountain region depends entirely on our Five Insects Gate.  We shared the spiritual stones from Black Wind Valley with them, but it was all for nothing! If the Five Insects Gate falls, won't they invite the wolves into the house?”</p><p>Cui Xuanzi sighed, “Greed knows no bounds. They received their share of spiritual stones, but Master forcefully allocated the Poison Spring to our Five Insects Gate, against the wishes of everyone else.  Back then, Master’s influence was still strong, and even if they were dissatisfied, they dared not do anything. Over the years, Master has been missing, and our Five Insects Gate has declined, with fewer successors. One by one, they started to have ulterior motives and have secretly collaborated with outside enemies. However, they certainly wouldn't dare to openly break ties; they're merely hoping to fish in troubled waters and force us to yield. Therefore, don't send any messages; this calamity, we, the Five Insects Gate, must face alone.”</p><p>As they were speaking, a series of shouts came from outside the mountain gate.</p><p>“Old Cui Xuan, hiding in your turtle shell, not even daring to show yourself. What, are all the disciples of the Five Insects Gate green-haired turtles?”</p><p>Lei Gui the Thunder Ghost used a spell to amplify his voice, his sarcastic laughter echoing through the mountains.</p><p>The Five Insects Gate disciples heard it clearly, grinding their teeth and wishing they could tear out his mouth.</p><p>“Hee hee…”</p><p>The seductive woman giggled, her laughter shaking her body, her beauty striking, yet her words were deeply malicious.  “The Five Insects Gate disciples are all green-haired turtles, so pitiful. Why not join our Bai Hua Palace?  Every single one of our disciples is a virtuous and loyal woman…”</p><p>The seductive woman's voice was seductive.  Some less resolute disciples blushed, revealing their weakness.</p><p>“Hold!”</p><p>Cui Xuanzi roared, startling the disciples. He leaped to the edge of the protective mountain formation and said in a deep voice, “You cultivators from the two regions have joined forces to attack my gate, and your words are disrespectful. What exactly do you want?”</p><p>Lei Gui the Thunder Ghost sneered, “Old Cui Xuan, you know full well why we are here! Black Wind Valley, your Five Insects Gate has occupied it for long enough.”</p><p>Cui Xuanzi raged, “You personally made the agreement, that Black Wind Valley would belong to my Five Insects Gate for a hundred years.  There are still eight years left, yet you dare to forcibly break the agreement!”</p><p>The seductive woman cried, “Oh, my dear Cui Xuan, your words are incorrect.  It was clearly your sect that, relying on the power of a Golden Core cultivator, forced the cultivators of our two regions to submit and hand over Black Wind Valley, which is full of treasures.”</p><p>“Back in my apprenticeship, I witnessed a Nascent Soul cultivator's power firsthand – truly awe-inspiring!” The alluring woman affected a delicate pose, every movement dripping with charm, causing her companions to glance at her.</p><p>The grizzled old man, Lei Gui, added, “Your sect produced a Golden Core cultivator back then. We were outmatched; nothing to say about it. But a century has passed, times change.  It's time to return what you shouldn't have taken.”</p><p>Cui Xuanzi, seeing their intentions, knew a peaceful resolution was unlikely.  “Aren’t you afraid my master will return and annihilate you all?”</p><p>Cui Xuanzi glared, sweeping her gaze across their faces, fiercely declaring, “Try it! Annihilate my sect today, but make sure not a single one escapes! Otherwise, I will remember all your faces, and when my master returns, he will avenge us!”</p><p>The crowd stiffened.  Meeting Cui Xuanzi's gaze, they hesitated, especially those who had been recruited for assistance.  They feared their own masters.</p><p>Cui Xuanzi secretly breathed a sigh of relief, softening her tone. “Leave now, and let's pretend this never happened. We have honored guests and cannot see you out.”</p><p>“Hold on!”</p><p>Lei Gui sneered, his resolve firm, unafraid.  “Honored guest?  That unnamed Golden Core cultivator?  Cui Xuan, don't resort to these tired tricks.</p><p>“Our Thunderclap Fortress and Hundred Flowers Palace are here for Black Wind Valley. We didn’t want a confrontation.  But if you persist, we’ll be forced to do what we must.</p><p>“As for your revenge, that will depend on your master’s return. For all we know, he might be nothing but bones, buried on some island.</p><p>“Otherwise, why hasn’t he returned?”</p><p>Lei Gui turned to the others, his voice laced with subtle persuasion.  “Five Insects Sect has controlled Black Wind Valley for a century, accumulating countless spirit stones.  We from Thunderclap Fortress and Hundred Flowers Palace will forgo our share; it’s all yours, as payment for your services. Even if the Five Insects Sect's Golden Core cultivator is still alive, you are all wanderers; you'll find places to hide, won't you?”</p>
