<h1>Chapter 1927: Spirit Erosion</h1><p>“Esteemed Daoist, please come in.”</p><p>The City Lord of Cloud Cauldron City, clad in splendid brocade robes, exuded a refined and dignified aura, his entire being radiating nobility.</p><p>This noble air, supported by his powerful cultivation, was something that mortal kings and nobles could not compare to.</p><p>Although Qin Sang hadn't visited many times, the two were already quite familiar with each other.</p><p>They took their respective seats as host and guest.</p><p>Before Qin Sang could speak, the City Lord of Cloud Cauldron City waved his sleeve, and several jade bottles materialized on the table.</p><p>“This bottle contains Scattered Flower Divine Liquid, and this one contains Marrow-Soaking Pills…”</p><p>The City Lord introduced them one by one.</p><p>Inside the jade bottles were some spirit pills and some spirit liquids, all sharing a common trait: they contained potent poisons, virulent enough to make even Spirit Transformation cultivators blanch.</p><p>“The Marrow-Soaking Pills were personally refined by this humble one, while the others were collected from elsewhere.  Unfortunately, Daoist Qin's requirements are quite high, and despite my best efforts, I've only managed to gather these for the time being…”</p><p>After explaining the properties of each poison, the City Lord pushed them toward Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang expressed his gratitude, opened the restrictions on the jade bottles, and sensed the potency of the medicines within.</p><p>Seeing that he didn't take any protective measures, the City Lord’s eyes narrowed slightly.</p><p>Little did he know, even without his poison pills, Qin Sang's accumulated knowledge of the Poison Dao was considerably profound.</p><p>Qin Sang examined each one, nodding slightly. These poisons all met the requirements for cultivating the *Poison God Classic*.</p><p>The problem was that the quantity wasn't enough, and it was still a long way from meeting his needs!</p><p>The City Lord of Cloud Cauldron City was a grandmaster of the Alchemy Dao, but even so, such potent poisons weren't something that could be refined on a whim, not to mention the fact that the City Lord couldn't possibly dedicate all his time to serving just him.</p><p>Qin Sang sighed inwardly, recalling the days in the flower fields, how blissful it was when the flower dew flowed endlessly.</p><p>“With your status and position, is this all you could acquire?”</p><p>Qin Sang frowned. “Besides these, have you gathered any other clues? Are there any forbidden zones in this world, born from the convergence of the heavens and earth's Yin and evil Qi?”</p><p>Such places were the most likely to breed extremely poisonous substances.</p><p>The City Lord shook his head slightly.  “Cloud Capital Mountain is a place of pure and refined spiritual energy, impervious to evil influences. Even if there were any, they would have long been suppressed by the experts of Cloud Capital Heaven. The most Yin and evil place is the Soulfall Abyss. However, heh heh… even the most ferocious demons of Twilightfall Mountain wouldn't dare trespass on the territory of the Soulfall Abyss. As for within Twilightfall Mountain itself, this humble one governs a city, with countless eyes watching my every move, so I must avoid any contact with that side.”</p><p>Qin Sang's expression shifted slightly, detecting the subtle implication in these words. "Cloud Cauldron City's reputation is widespread, a sacred ground of alchemy in both Cloud Capital Mountain and Twilightfall Mountain.  Surely many Twilightfall Mountain cultivators, disguised in various ways, come here seeking pills. Some rumors must have reached your ears. Could you perhaps share a few?"</p><p>The City Lord feigned hesitation, then said, "Indeed, there are some rumors, the truth of which is uncertain…  Daoist Qin, have you heard of Spirit Erosion?"</p><p>“Spirit Erosion? This humble Daoist is ignorant and has never heard of such a person.”</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head.</p><p>“Spirit Erosion is known as the number one poison master in Twilightfall Mountain. His poison skills are uncanny, capable of killing without a trace.  Other demons, upon encountering him, retreat a hundred miles, fleeing in terror. This person is proficient in poison techniques and must possess vast knowledge of the world's poisonous substances.  I have here a stone pearl, said to be from Spirit Erosion's hand. By presenting this pearl, one can request his assistance."</p><p>As he spoke, the City Lord retrieved a milky white stone pearl, far less translucent than a jade pearl, appearing quite ordinary.</p><p>Even cultivators as profound as Qin Sang and the City Lord could sense a unique fluctuation concealed within the stone pearl, like a distinctive marker.</p><p>Qin Sang picked it up and examined it carefully. "Where did this pearl come from?"</p><p>"The biggest problem lies there, its origin is difficult to trace," the City Lord sighed. "It's said that only those who have once shown kindness to Spirit Erosion, or have by chance gained his recognition, would be bestowed with such a pearl. I had heard of these pearls before, and since Daoist Qin has such a request, I kept this one."</p><p>The implication was that directly presenting the pearl carried inherent risks.  What if Spirit Erosion saw that it wasn't the original owner and retaliated with a poisonous palm strike?</p><p>He then added, “Spirit Erosion's whereabouts are erratic. No one knows the location of his cave dwelling. I've tried many methods, but all have been fruitless. Only with this pearl is there hope of finding him.”</p><p>"If fellow Daoist is willing to part with it, this humble Daoist will accept this stone pearl."</p><p>Qin Sang put away the stone pearl and, after calculating the value of the pearl and the poisons with the City Lord, took out three jade bottles of his own.</p><p>Inside the bottles were three vials of the purest essence blood from Spirit Transformation stage demonic beasts.</p><p>Qin Sang had almost exhausted his own stockpile, the spoils of war from slaying Demon Marquises and ferocious beasts.</p><p>These were obtained from the legacies of two Demon Kings; the immense gains were enough for him to spend lavishly for a while.</p><p>In addition, Qin Sang also possessed the corpses of Void Refinement stage demonic beasts, but they weren't suitable for trading here.</p><p>What Demon Kings valued were invariably the most essential parts of demonic beasts and ferocious beasts.</p><p>The City Lord's dedication stemmed from the immense allure of these items.</p><p>Seeing the jade bottles, the City Lord’s eyes lit up. He picked up one and opened the restriction.</p><p>"Indeed, this is the purest essence blood! With this essence blood, this humble one's confidence in a certain matter increases by at least twenty percent!"</p><p>The City Lord's face was filled with delight. Seeing Qin Sang's intention to depart, he quickly called out, “Daoist Qin, please wait, this humble one has another matter to discuss."</p><p>"What important matter is it, City Lord, please speak."</p><p>The City Lord quickly put away the three bottles of essence blood and said seriously, "This humble one is actually acting on behalf of another. A fellow Daoist has discovered an ancient restriction, possibly concealing an ancient secret realm within, but it also harbors danger. He seeks assistance in breaking the restriction. If Daoist Qin is interested, this humble one will invite that fellow Daoist for a meeting.”</p><p>Qin Sang’s ability to produce so much demon bone and demon blood indicated formidable strength, and he seemed like a solitary cultivator, perfectly matching his client’s requirements.</p><p>"An ancient restriction? Can you determine its age and location?"</p><p>Qin Sang's heart stirred, wondering if it could be related to the Thunder Altar.</p><p>“It's estimated to be over ten thousand years old, the exact time is difficult to determine.  At present, I can only tell Daoist Qin that it lies east of Cloud Capital Heaven, perhaps the remnants of a sect that has long since vanished," the City Lord said cautiously.</p><p>It seemed unrelated to the Thunder Altar.</p><p>Qin Sang judged that the Thunder Altar's range extended at most to the western edge of Cloud Capital Mountain, and its age couldn't be so recent.</p><p>"Daoist Qin could request that fellow Daoist to accompany you to Twilightfall Mountain. With two Daoists visiting together, surely Spirit Erosion wouldn't dare act recklessly," the City Lord added.</p><p>Qin Sang, however, showed little interest. He rose and cupped his hands. "Thank you for your kind offer, but this humble Daoist's cultivation is incomplete and I dare not be distracted."</p><p>…</p><p>Leaving Cloud Cauldron City, Qin Sang continued westward without pause.</p><p>The journey was smooth.</p><p>Qin Sang crossed the fire domain and entered the Twilightfall Mountain Range.</p><p>Upon entering Twilightfall Mountain, he immediately felt a stark contrast to Cloud Capital Mountain.</p><p>Perhaps it was due to preconceived notions.</p><p>Cloud Capital Mountain gave off a sense of righteousness and tranquility, while Twilightfall Mountain, even at midday under the blazing sun, exuded a lingering sense of gloom.</p><p>Qin Sang flew high in the sky, heading deeper into Twilightfall Mountain.  He hadn't traveled far before witnessing several battles, all life-or-death struggles.</p><p>Although not every place was so chaotic, the cultivators and demon cultivators Qin Sang encountered all possessed a certain ruthless aura.</p><p>His swift journey continued.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>A white cloud flew past a mountain peak, and suddenly a streak of azure light shot out from below.</p><p>Within the azure light was a long arrow inscribed with runes, its tip gleaming coldly, incredibly sharp.</p><p>The arrow pierced the air with astonishing speed, reaching beneath the white cloud in the blink of an eye, aiming to pierce through it.</p><p>If the person on the white cloud were weak and caught off guard, they could easily be severely injured or even killed by this single arrow.</p><p>This was Twilightfall Mountain, where attacks could come at any time, without reason or warning. One could only rely on their own caution and vigilance.</p><p>Just as the arrow was about to pierce the white cloud, it abruptly froze, bound by an invisible force.</p><p>Below the mountain, outside a cave, stood a man in black robes, a Nascent Soul cultivator, holding a longbow.</p><p>This arrow was shot by him.</p><p>Seeing his spirit arrow effortlessly restrained, the man’s expression changed drastically.  Realizing he had provoked a formidable opponent, he plunged into the cave without hesitation, activating all its restrictions.</p><p>He frantically attempted to escape using the formations within his cave dwelling.</p><p>However, the earth rumbled, and a giant hand manifested from the void, easily piercing through the mountain and snatching him out.</p><p>The man looked at the Daoist before him with terror.</p><p>“Do you have any recent news of Realman Spirit Erosion?”</p><p>The Daoist asked in a calm tone.</p><p>“This junior… this junior hasn't seen Realman Spirit Erosion, Senior, please forgive me! Spare my life!”</p><p>The man pleaded repeatedly.</p><p>The giant hand pressed down, driving the man into the ground, silencing him completely.</p><p>The Daoist was Qin Sang.  He frowned, gazing ahead. This place wasn't far from the location marked on the stone pearl. Could it be that Spirit Erosion's cave dwelling wasn't here?</p><p>In that case, he could only wait for the other party to come to him, hoping Spirit Erosion hadn't left his cave.</p><p>Qin Sang continued onward, flying over dozens of mountain ranges before descending into a flat valley and retrieving the stone pearl.</p><p>He brought the pearl here, but he couldn't sense any change from it, unable to deduce the other party's location.</p><p>Qin Sang released his divine sense, sweeping over the area, but found nothing unusual. He chose a rock, sat down cross-legged, and waited patiently.</p><p>…</p><p>At a distant lake.</p><p>Beneath the lakebed's mud and sand lay a solid black stone, its interior hollowed out and carved into a cave dwelling.</p><p>Several figures were searching for something within the cave.</p><p>These people were strangely dressed in crimson robes, their entire bodies covered from head to toe.  Twisted patterns of unknown meaning were etched on the backs of their robes.</p><p>The patterns on their backs differed, with two clearly more complex, indicating a higher status.</p><p>Both of these individuals seemed to have depleted their True Essence. They sat facing each other, meditating and conversing.</p><p>"That old poison wretch Spirit Erosion is truly cunning. To think he didn't place the formation's core within his cave dwelling. It's a pity that despite Lord Tu Yuan's brilliant strategy and breaching the cave, we failed to capture him," the taller one lamented.</p><p>His companion was short and stout, his protruding belly stretching the red robe into a bulge. He let out a cold chuckle.</p><p>"We merely failed to capture him on the spot. He's already tightly trapped by Lord Tu Yuan, unable to escape. His surrender is only a matter of time!  The person our Ancestor specifically named, even if he flees to the ends of the earth, what can he do? If that old poison wretch continues to be obstinate, once our Ancestor personally intervenes, I fear it won't be as simple as capture!"</p><p>“Having our Ancestor come out signifies Lord Tu Yuan's failure, and we will be punished along with him. I hope that day never comes.”</p><p>The tall cultivator seemed to recall something terrifying and shuddered. "Although the old poison wretch escaped, he didn't have time to destroy the things in his cave. I only hope there's some secret within that can help Lord Tu Yuan capture him, so we can report back to him!"</p><p>Just then, a ghostly light erupted within the cave dwelling, followed by a cracking sound.</p><p>The two rejoiced. "Another chamber has been opened! To think the remaining restrictions are still so strong. It took a full half-month to break into this single chamber!"</p><p>Their subordinates filed out, carrying various items from the cave, some treasures, others seemingly just miscellaneous objects.</p><p>They brought each item before them and examined it carefully.</p><p>Fearing they might miss any detail, they were extremely thorough.</p><p>Suddenly, the stout cultivator seemed to sense something and glanced sideways, his gaze falling upon a stone mirror.</p><p>The circular stone mirror, nearly ten feet tall, stood upright on a stone base of the same material.</p><p>The mirror’s surface was polished to an exceptional smoothness, reflecting light like a flawless mirror.</p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p>The stout cultivator looked surprised.</p><p>The stone mirror had been placed in the main hall, and they had examined it countless times before, finding nothing special about it.</p><p>Now, a faint point of light appeared on the mirror's surface. In the instant the light appeared, several lines emerged.</p><p>Having planned this for a long time, lurking nearby for days, they immediately recognized these lines as a map of the surrounding terrain.</p><p>“What is this?”</p><p>The two exchanged glances.</p><p>The tall cultivator’s eyes brightened. “This mirror is certainly not a treasure for scouting, otherwise, the old poison wretch would have detected us long ago!”</p><p>"You mean, could it be…" The stout cultivator pondered.</p><p>"If this point of light represents a person, it must be someone deeply connected to the old poison wretch!  Most likely someone close to him. Capture him, and we might be able to force the old poison wretch to submit!"</p><p>The tall cultivator declared decisively.</p><p>"I've never heard of the old poison wretch having any relatives or disciples," the stout cultivator hesitated.</p><p>"We'll find out when we meet him, won’t we? You, come here!"</p><p>The tall cultivator summoned his subordinates, and they left the cave dwelling, flying towards the location of the light point.</p><p>However, they didn't all reveal themselves.</p><p>After the two had fully recovered their strength, they cautiously approached, observing from a distance, and ordered two subordinates to investigate.</p><p>Unbeknownst to them, Qin Sang had detected them the moment they flew towards this location.</p><p>Qin Sang remained seated on the rock, unmoving, observing their actions with growing curiosity.</p><p>Could these people be Spirit Erosion's subordinates?</p><p>Why were their actions so strange?</p><p>Their auras were also peculiar, not like cultivators of poison techniques, but rather filled with the Qi of corpses, like a group of corpse refiners.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>A gust of Yin wind swept from outside the valley, and two figures in red robes descended from the sky, landing on the ground before Qin Sang.</p><p>*Thud! Thud!*</p><p>Their bodies seemed remarkably heavy.</p><p>Qin Sang rose from the rock.</p><p>Looking at the two figures, a flicker of recognition crossed Qin Sang's eyes, stirring distant memories of the Flying Sky Night Fiends.</p><p>Qin Sang could almost guess their origins.</p><p>From beneath the red robes, four cold gazes scrutinized Qin Sang without restraint. One of them spoke in a raspy voice, demanding, "Who are you? State your name!  And hand over any tokens you possess!"</p>
