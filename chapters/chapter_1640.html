<h1></h1><p>Initially, Qin Sang had cultivated a Yuanmo Embryo to form an avatar, dispatching it to the Lan Dou Sect to gather intelligence. By a twist of fate, his avatar was recognized by the Yin-Yang lineage of the Lan Dou Sect and was granted the "Yin-Yang Heaven Duel Secret Art."</p><p>The Lan Dou Sect's inheritance of this art only contained the first layer.  Later, an exceptionally brilliant predecessor, a Yin-Yang Daoist, completed the cultivation method and passed down the lineage.</p><p>This cultivation method, from the very beginning of cultivation, condenses Yin-Yang Armor and cultivates Yin-Yang Qi, truly marvelous.</p><p>Qin Sang had been quite tempted, even considering it as a backup cultivation method for the "Primordial Spirit Sword Nurturing Chapters." Later, he discovered that the cultivation method was incomplete and the true lineage transmission was difficult to obtain, so he abandoned the idea.</p><p>However, he had already cultivated the first layer of the "Yin-Yang Heaven Duel Secret Art" and condensed a set of Yin-Yang Armor, used to conceal the Buddha's light emanating from the Jade Buddha within his Primordial Spirit.</p><p>For many years, the Yin-Yang Armor hadn't served any purpose.</p><p>Qin Sang also didn't have the energy to comprehend this cultivation method, so he shelved it, almost forgetting about it.</p><p>Unexpectedly, now a tremor arose. The treasure within the jade cage seemed to have some connection with this cultivation method!</p><p>Qin Sang was secretly astonished, his gaze fixed on that orb of light.</p><p>The jade cage was carved from spiritual jade; the Heavenly Eye couldn't see the treasure inside.</p><p>If his divine sense probed into the Cloud Pool, it would be met with a forceful counterattack.  To know what treasure was sealed within, he could only devise a way to fish out the jade cage.</p><p>He didn't waste too much time on the lower level of the Jade Pavilion.</p><p>Time wasn't pressing.</p><p>He was also very curious about what treasure was connected to the "Yin-Yang Heaven Duel Secret Art."  Although he had only cultivated the first layer, Qin Sang believed that this cultivation method definitely had a profound origin, a grand heritage!</p><p>He turned, staring at the drifting jade cage, his body moving along the surrounding corridors, maintaining the closest possible distance to the cage.</p><p>Simultaneously, guided by Qin Sang, the Heavenly Eye Butterfly urged its Heavenly Eye power to its utmost limit, carefully investigating and pondering the most reliable method to retrieve the treasure.</p><p>Back then, when the Formless Immortal Sect faced its destruction, the Immortal Pavilion remained undamaged.  Even if he used the Sun God Tree, he couldn't possibly destroy the Cloud Pool.  Forcibly taking it was clearly not feasible.</p><p>One wrong move, causing a mutation in the Cloud Pool, would be even more troublesome.</p><p>“The Qi of every treasure within the pool is connected to the Cloud Pool, forming a seamless whole.  To retrieve a treasure from the pool, one can only use ingenuity. Human strength is finite.  It's very difficult for one person. If I summoned my avatar, or had a few more helpers, it would be much easier…”</p><p>The enemies of the Formless Immortal Sect, their mastery of formations and restrictions, were likely not his equal.  They probably collaborated to fish for treasures, but they hadn't been able to empty the Cloud Pool.</p><p>Qin Sang stopped staring intently at the jade cage and looked down at the entire Cloud Pool, silently calculating.</p><p>After a short while, a streak of light flew out from his dantian.</p><p>The Heavenly Eye Butterfly flew outside, gently flapping its wings, circling the Cloud Pool.  Qin Sang stood still, a strange light flickering in his eyes.  Silence returned to the Immortal Pavilion.</p><p>An unknown amount of time passed.</p><p>Qin Sang exhaled softly, pondered for a moment, and a fire lotus appeared on his forehead.</p><p>Then, he summoned the demonic fire from the Demonic Banner, guided by the fire lotus, forming a sea of fire above his head.</p><p>With a thought, the sea of fire split into four.  Flames converged towards the center of the four fire masses, gradually transforming into four fire figures. The fire figures had no facial features, no sentience, just simple imitations, but each contained a trace of Qin Sang's aura. He then sealed his own aura.</p><p>‘Swish! Swish! Swish!’</p><p>The four fire figures flew towards the four corners of the Cloud Pool.</p><p>Qin Sang stood in the middle of a corridor, overseeing the entire situation.</p><p>Once again, silence fell upon the Immortal Pavilion.</p><p>Qin Sang quietly watched the jade cage darting about within the Cloud Pool.</p><p>Finally, when the jade cage drifted close to the center of the Cloud Pool, Qin Sang's expression shifted. He pressed a single hand towards the pool, and a prepared hand seal flew out.</p><p>Simultaneously, as if receiving a command, the four fire figures raised their arms, pointing at the jade cage. Eight fire serpents, one after another, shot out from within them.</p><p>‘Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh…’</p><p>The fire serpents shot into the Cloud Pool, immediately triggering a fierce counterattack.</p><p>The sound of thunder erupted.  Cloud thunder burst forth from the four corners of the Cloud Pool. The fire serpents didn't dodge or evade, colliding directly with the cloud thunder.</p><p>With a booming sound, the fire serpents were unable to withstand the cloud thunder and were routed.</p><p>However, the fire serpents moved in pairs. While the leading fire serpents resisted the cloud thunder, the second serpents, close behind, seized the opportunity amidst the chaos to penetrate the cloud thunder blockade and reach the cloud mist within the Cloud Pool.</p><p>The cloud mist wasn't truly there; it was formed by the Cloud Pool's restrictions.</p><p>The power of demonic fire clashed with the Cloud Pool's restrictions.</p><p>Now was the most crucial moment. As the restrictions counterattacked, the treasures within the pool gradually became illusory, about to vanish like before.</p><p>He had to fish out the jade cage before the treasures disappeared!</p><p>The Heavenly Eye Butterfly hovered in mid-air, capturing the scene within the Cloud Pool and transmitting it to Qin Sang's mind.  He had to divide his mind into four, controlling the four fire figures and responding to the changes in all four directions.</p><p>Qin Sang devoted all his effort to deducing the changes in the restrictions. Even with his cultivation, he felt immense pressure, his brows furrowed, holding his breath, not daring to be distracted in the slightest.</p><p>The fire figures misled the Cloud Pool's restrictions.</p><p>Mistaking the fire figures for enemies, the Cloud Pool's restrictions unleashed furious cloud thunder towards the four corners.  Unafraid of destruction, the fire figures not only didn't retreat, but they also launched a fierce counterattack.</p><p>Within the Cloud Pool, the confrontation with the restrictions was also making progress.</p><p>Amidst the cloud mist, the four fire serpents divided into countless smaller ones, and at some point, they connected, forming a hollow fire net, rapidly closing in.</p><p>This couldn't prevent the treasures within the Cloud Pool from disappearing, but it could restrain the Cloud Pool's restrictions, slowing down the disappearance of the jade cage.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang was no longer dividing his mind into four, but further split off another part to lock onto the jade cage, racing against time to analyze the changes in the restrictions around it!</p><p>At this very moment, he finally made his move!</p><p>A clear sword cry rang out as the spiritual sword appeared once more!</p><p>Sword light, like a rainbow, pierced the Cloud Pool.</p><p>Simultaneously, Qin Sang's spirit returned to his Purple Mansion.  His body swayed, and the surrounding light suddenly flickered.  He summoned the Yin-Yang Armor from his Purple Mansion.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>The Yin-Yang Armor reverted to its essence of Yin-Yang Qi and then transformed into a giant Yin-Yang hand, following the trail left by the sword light, grabbing towards the jade cage.</p><p>All obstacles were shattered by the Golden Sinking Sword, but this also caused the jade cage to rapidly fade.</p><p>Suddenly.</p><p>The jade cage trembled. An inexplicable resistance arose within, preventing the jade cage from disappearing in time. Delayed for a mere instant, it was seized by the Yin-Yang hand!</p><p>A look of joy appeared on Qin Sang's face. The Yin-Yang Armor had indeed triggered a reaction from the treasure within the cage.</p><p>The Cloud Pool's restrictions furiously counterattacked, but it was too late.</p><p>The Yin-Yang hand immediately retreated.</p><p>The Golden Sinking Sword and demonic fire provided cover, throwing the Cloud Pool into turmoil, successfully retrieving the jade cage!</p><p>Having obtained the treasure, Qin Sang immediately retreated to the lower level, waiting for the Cloud Pool's restrictions to calm down before ascending the Immortal Pavilion again.</p><p>Now, the jade cage was in his hand.</p><p>As expected, the jade cage's function was simple: to isolate and seal the fluctuations of the treasure within. Other broken swords and blades had lost their power and didn't require a jade cage.</p><p>After some investigation, Qin Sang figured out how to open it. His divine sense entered the jade cage, and with a 'crack,' the cage split open, a ball of grayish-white light tumbling out.</p><p>Within the grayish-white light was a crude jade stone!</p><p>The crude jade was elliptical, its surface rough and mottled, like a layer of unscraped stone skin, lacking any sense of smoothness.</p><p>From within the crude jade, layers of grayish-white rings of light constantly rippled outwards.</p><p>The light rings expanded, gradually fading and disappearing.</p><p>Bathed in the light rings, Qin Sang felt no discomfort but sensed a familiar fluctuation, emanating from the same source as the Yin-Yang Armor. It was definitely related.</p><p>He condensed Yin-Yang Qi again, activating the "Yin-Yang Heaven Duel Secret Art." Once he approached, the crude jade's light would brighten significantly, and the fluctuations became more intense, but that was all.</p><p>When he withdrew the Yin-Yang Qi, the crude jade returned to normal.</p><p>After several attempts, the result was the same.</p><p>Even when Qin Sang used the "Yin-Yang Heaven Duel Secret Art" to stimulate the crude jade, he couldn't activate any new power.</p><p>“This… could it be because my realm in this cultivation method is too low?”</p><p>Knowing the cultivation method was incomplete, Qin Sang had abandoned it.  He hadn't tried to steal the Yin-Yang Daoist's comprehended cultivation method later either.</p><p>“This object resonates with the Dao of Yin-Yang, but it has no other mystical properties.  The Formless Immortal Sect placing it within the Cloud Pool suggests it has an extraordinary origin, likely from the Immortal Palace.”</p><p>Qin Sang thought of the Lan Dou Sect.</p><p>The fragmented cultivation method ended up in the Canglang Sea, while the treasure related to it appeared in Zhongzhou. The connection was likely due to the Immortal Palaces in both locations.</p><p>Unfortunately, he didn't know where the Canglang Sea was. Otherwise, he could visit and inquire. The Lan Dou Sect might be able to discern something.</p><p>Unable to understand it for the time being, Qin Sang stored the crude jade in his Thousand Jun Ring.</p><p>“Canglang Sea… Tian Tong and Tian Xiang should have ascended with the Ziwei Palace. The Seven Kill Palace is gone too, right?”</p><p>This thought popped into Qin Sang’s mind out of nowhere.</p><p>The Ziwei Palace's ascension actually concealed another path to ascension.</p><p>The power of the ancient teleportation formation within the Immortal Palace was beyond ordinary comprehension. It might be able to break through the boundary wall.</p><p>If the Seven Kill Palace remained, he could use the ancient teleportation formation within its Immortal Palace to teleport to the Ziwei Palace, thereby achieving the goal of leaving this world!</p><p>However, Qin Sang felt that the hope was slim, not as feasible as the Ascension Platform or the East Sea's Return to Ruin.</p><p>With the ascension of the Tian Tong Palace and Tian Xiang Palace, the hope for this path was almost non-existent.</p><p>Shaking his head slightly, Qin Sang dismissed these distracting thoughts and stepped onto the jade stairs, ascending to the summit of the Lang Huan Bell!</p><p>This place was even simpler than the lower level.</p><p>Four pillars supported the roof of the Jade Pavilion.  Besides these, there were no other furnishings.  A single meditation cushion rested on the smooth floor.</p><p>The cushion wasn't woven from any rare spiritual materials either.</p><p>The only noteworthy feature was the dome of the Jade Pavilion.  The passage below resembled the starry sky, but here, a true starry sky was depicted, stars twinkling brilliantly.</p><p>Qin Sang paused briefly, then walked towards the meditation cushion, examined it for a moment, and sat down cross-legged.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>The moment he sat down, the starlight on the dome brightened, converging into a beam of light that poured onto Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang sensed no threat and remained seated.</p><p>The Heavenly Eye Butterfly on his shoulder took flight, circling him, remaining vigilant, preventing anyone from approaching the Jade Pavilion.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang felt as if he had fallen into a sea of stars.</p><p>In reality, a wisp of his consciousness had been pulled into an unknown space.  Here, orbs of light floated, some bright and dazzling, most dim.</p><p>There weren't actually that many orbs, but they all revolved around his consciousness, creating an illusion.</p><p>Subconsciously, Qin Sang approached one of the shining orbs.</p><p>The moment his consciousness made contact, a stream of information flowed into his mind.</p><p>"Unnamed Pill Formula Fragment!"</p><p>It was actually a fragment of an alchemy technique.</p><p>The Water Phase Palace's inheritance had left his avatar confused and overwhelmed, but this fragment was truly a heavenly scripture. He could understand the ancient characters, but when combined, Qin Sang couldn't comprehend the meaning.</p><p>Moreover, the content of the fragment wasn't continuous.  Even forcibly memorizing it would require considerable mental effort.</p><p>“The bright orbs contain fragments of various scriptures!”</p><p>Instead of worry, Qin Sang felt joy.  He had finally found the right place.</p><p>The Lang Huan Bell was indeed a treasure vault. The lower level stored ancient treasures of unknown origin, while the upper level stored scriptures.</p><p>This was the place where high-level cultivators of the Formless Immortal Sect cultivated and gained enlightenment.  Although they were fragments, they all had profound origins. If one could comprehend even a little, they would benefit for life.</p><p>“Is the Primordial Spirit Sword Nurturing Chapters here?”</p><p>Qin Sang rarely felt nervous, but now he couldn't help it. The Lang Huan Bell was his only hope outside. Whether he could obtain the cultivation method would affect his future path of cultivation.</p><p>Immediately, Qin Sang withdrew his consciousness from the pill formula and touched other orbs, tirelessly searching.</p><p>"Lingxu Heaven Attraction Fragment."</p><p>"Unnamed Cultivation Method."</p><p>"Spirit Treasure Heaven Imprisoning Seal Refinement Method (Incomplete)."</p><p>…</p><p>One orb after another passed by, a cursory glance. Most were various 'Unnamed' and 'Fragments,' confirming Qin Sang's guess.</p><p>In fact, not many of these incomplete scriptures were worthy of being placed within the Lang Huan Bell. Most orbs contained nothing.</p><p>Qin Sang quickly scanned through most of them, but didn't see what he desired.  His mind inevitably tightened with tension.</p><p>He scanned another orb.</p><p>"A fragmented divine ability, not a cultivation method!"</p><p>Disappointment flashed across Qin Sang's face. Skipping the content, his consciousness touched the next orb.  When he saw the name within, he subconsciously held his breath.</p><p>"Unnamed Sword Nurturing Art!"</p><p>Sword Nurturing Art! Primordial Spirit Sword Nurturing Chapters!</p><p>Qin Sang's heart stirred. He hurriedly probed into the orb, seeing the content within. With just one glance, his tense mind immediately relaxed.</p><p>It was the "Primordial Spirit Sword Nurturing Chapters"!</p><p>Having searched painstakingly for so many years, he finally obtained it, and so easily.  Qin Sang felt it was somewhat unreal. He only hoped it was the part for the Nascent Soul realm and beyond.</p><p>Composing himself, Qin Sang continued to browse the contents of the cultivation method.</p><p>A quick scan.</p><p>"Eleventh Layer! Good!"</p><p>"Twelfth Layer…"</p><p>"That's it?"</p><p>Qin Sang was stunned. He quickly examined the content carefully, only to realize he had overthought it.</p><p>The Primordial Spirit Sword Nurturing Chapters had ten layers before this. The first layer served as the foundation of the entire cultivation method, starting from the Foundation Establishment realm. Each minor realm corresponded to a layer of the cultivation method.</p><p>The cultivation method was split into two parts before, each with five layers.</p><p>After reaching Nascent Soul, it no longer followed this pattern. The eleventh layer actually corresponded to the entire Nascent Soul realm, and the twelfth layer astonishingly corresponded to the Soul Formation realm!</p><p>At the very least, this was a cultivation method leading directly to the Soul Formation Grand Path!</p><p>Back then, the Formless Immortal Sect had obtained the cultivation method without the parts before Nascent Soul, making comprehension extremely difficult. Moreover, the cultivation method was clearly unorthodox, actually nurturing a sword with one's Primordial Spirit. No one dared to attempt it.</p><p>However, because these two parts involved such high realms, they were placed within the Lang Huan Bell, and moreover, in the latter, most important positions.</p><p>Having obtained the cultivation method, Qin Sang didn't rush to comprehend it. Moreover, his realm wasn't sufficient yet. He continued to browse the other orbs, wanting to see if there were higher levels of the "Yin-Yang Heaven Duel Secret Art" here.</p><p>Unfortunately, until the very end, Qin Sang found another fragment of a cultivation method leading to the Soul Formation realm, but not this particular cultivation method.</p>
