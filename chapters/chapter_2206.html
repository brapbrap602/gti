<h1>Chapter 2196: The Netherworld Dragonfly</h1><p>A myriad of stars shone together.  </p><p>Layers upon layers of starlight cascaded down like liquid mercury.  The triple sword formation launched a simultaneous attack, the Star煞 merging into a single entity, radiating an aura of slaughter.</p><p>Even the powerful robed cultivator had to evade the sharpness of this overwhelming sword intent when locked in by the combined formation.</p><p>At that moment, both he and the man in green were astounded by Qin Sang's strength. The descriptions given by the Immortal Child were not exaggerated in the least; it was a case of "hearing about it is not as good as seeing it for oneself."</p><p>A cultivator at the mid-stage of the Void Refinement realm, cultivating both thunder and sword techniques, simultaneously confronting two late-stage cultivators while also being restrained by the Nine-Turn Annihilation Wind – fighting to this point was something no one would believe if they heard about it.</p><p>Of course, the contribution of  Liuli couldn't be ignored.</p><p>Under the enhancement of the Imperial Heavenly Emperor Talisman, she used her ice-type divine abilities to defend Qin Sang against the Nine-Turn Annihilation Wind as much as possible, while simultaneously using the Emperor's divine might to influence the man in green's insect swarm.</p><p>This was also the reason for the man in green's growing anxiety. He had never encountered such a strange talisman before, one that seemed intent on forcibly seizing his insect swarm. Fortunately, he was unlike ordinary insect cultivators; he didn't simply control his insects with soul imprints. Each insect, after being subdued, would integrate into his bloodline, constantly feeding on his flesh and blood.</p><p>In a sense, he was the insects, and the insects were him.</p><p>This swarm of insects was his body, the vessel of his primordial spirit.</p><p>However, these insects were different from avatars; they couldn't exist independently. They had to be together to support his primordial spirit and unleash their full power.</p><p>Countless insects, a formless swarm, changeable and unpredictable, defying gods and ghosts – but in the face of the Imperial Heavenly Emperor Talisman, their usual fluidity disappeared.</p><p>Although the talisman couldn't completely suppress his abilities, faced with such a nemesis, the man in green couldn't help but feel the urge to destroy it.</p><p>He sent a voice transmission to the robed cultivator, while his insect swarm rapidly changed. Most of the insects crowded to the front, resembling tadpoles – their slender bodies continued to contract, while their heads stretched to the sides, quickly forming a clear outline, transforming into a giant insect resembling a dragonfly.</p><p>The giant insect's wingspan exceeded a thousand zhang. A single flap of its wings could generate a hurricane.  Its long body shone with a bluish-green light, its wings were a pale yellow, and it had two large, bulging eyes on its head, vividly lifelike, glittering with blood-red light and radiating fierce aggression!</p><p>No matter how the insect swarm changed, a vibrant spirit flower remained in its center. Clearly, he also had a protective talisman; the Sky-Binding Golden Lock was useless against him.</p><p>As the giant insect took shape, the robed cultivator, locked in by the triple sword formation, felt his heart tighten. He abruptly stopped, furiously flapping his wings.</p><p>Then, shadows began to writhe on the surface of his wings, like black silk fluttering in the wind.  These shadows gradually swelled, erupting into black flames, and a black phoenix was born in the flames.</p><p>The black phoenix spread its wings, raised its proud head, and faced the sword light from the three Star煞 without fear, charging forward.</p><p>Starlight and black fire collided violently.</p><p>The shockwave swept in all directions, suppressing even the momentum of the Nine-Turn Annihilation Wind. A wave of light and darkness suddenly spread out. A rumbling sound echoed from the ground, dust and smoke rising as countless mountains were destroyed.</p><p>Their pursuit and escape had led them into the borders of the previous country, leaving a trail of destruction in their wake.  Countless ordinary people were affected and perished.</p><p>Fortunately, these ordinary people were illusions; no major slaughter occurred.</p><p>This was merely the power of the shockwave; the true collision was yet to end. The robed cultivator felt an impact force strike him, letting out a muffled groan. His body trembled, his aura fluctuating violently.  Not only was his forward momentum halted, but he was also pushed back thousands of zhang – clearly, he had taken a considerable blow.</p><p>However, the robed cultivator was ultimately powerful, his divine abilities formidable. He quickly regrouped and pressed forward.</p><p>The man in green's voice transmission reached his ears; the robed cultivator glanced at Liuli beside Qin Sang.</p><p>During this time, Liuli hadn't caused him much trouble. However, he could sense the strange talisman power around Liuli. It was a talisman he had never seen before, but with his discernment, he could tell that it was extremely profound.</p><p>The man in green's performance confirmed this – the talisman was restricting his abilities. Otherwise, even with Qin Sang's formidable strength, they would have already teamed up to subdue Qin Sang.</p><p>Since the man in green decided to kill Liuli first, the robed cultivator had no objections.</p><p>Unaware of their exchange, Qin Sang and Liuli continued their escape towards Panlong Cave.</p><p>They had crossed the border and entered a thick fog, drawing closer to the Panlong Cave.</p><p>"What kind of spirit insect is this?"</p><p>Qin Sang saw the giant dragonfly formed by the insect cloud, and several spirit insect names immediately flashed through her mind.  Earlier, this person had transformed into several spirit insects, their appearances only about 80% similar to real ones.  Accurate identification was impossible before they displayed their abilities.</p><p>Indeed, the insect cloud could not only change the appearance of spirit insects but also mimic their abilities.  It was unknown how many spirit insects this person had subdued, or if there was a limit to this transformation!</p><p>This person's abilities were incredibly versatile. Anyone facing such an opponent would find it extremely difficult.</p><p>Seeing the giant dragonfly, Qin Sang immediately countered with a Five Thunder Heavenly Heart Seal.</p><p>The thunderous seal descended.</p><p>The giant dragonfly flapped its wings once, its body gradually turning translucent before dissolving into a tri-colored light—red, yellow, and green. The light flickered, instantly teleporting it tens of thousands of feet away.</p><p>The thunder only pierced an afterimage.</p><p>Reappearing tens of thousands of feet away, the giant dragonfly glared fiercely at Qin Sang and Liuli, its eyes glowing even brighter red, emanating an eerie, invisible aura.</p><p>"No good! It's a Netherworld Dragonfly!"</p><p>Qin Sang finally recognized the giant dragonfly's origin and immediately felt a sense of foreboding.</p><p>The Netherworld Dragonfly was also recorded in the Witch Insect List.  It had another name, the Soul-Locking Ghost Dragonfly, derived from two of its abilities.  One was soul-locking, targeting the spirit and soul of living beings. The other was an ability to hide and teleport, making it so that its victims often didn't know who or what killed them until it was too late—a ghost-like predator.</p><p>She carried a jade Buddha, making her immune to the Netherworld Dragonfly's soul-locking ability, but Liuli was in danger.  Each spirit insect the insect cloud transformed into possessed the power of a late Nascent Soul cultivator.</p><p>The moment Qin Sang saw the bloodshot glow in the Netherworld Dragonfly's eyes, she sensed something was wrong.</p><p>At the same time, the black-robed cultivator who had previously communicated with the man in green robes had been waiting for this moment.  Two silver lights shot from his waist.</p><p>The silver lights crisscrossed, faster than lightning, forming a pair of silver fish in mid-air—two crescent-shaped spirit treasures.</p><p>The twin blades shot towards a seemingly empty area of space. A spatial distortion appeared, and a sword shadow flickered into view.</p><p>'Bang!'</p><p>Two devastating waves of blade energy erupted, tearing the sky apart with two silver lights.  The Grey Warbler Sword was caught directly between them.</p><p>Even with Qin Sang's exceptional swordsmanship, she couldn't instantly deflect the entangled blade energies.</p><p>And the black-robed cultivator's attack was only just beginning. Black fire danced on his body, but this time, no black phoenix was reborn from the flames; he himself transformed into a black phoenix.</p><p>'Liiit!'</p><p>The fog dispersed, and the void was ripped open.</p><p>The black phoenix was gone, replaced by a black claw seemingly piercing through space, radiating murderous intent.</p><p>The claw targeted Liuli!</p><p>The Netherworld Dragonfly's soul-locking ability activated almost simultaneously.  If Qin Sang and Liuli couldn't immediately escape the Netherworld Dragonfly—even a moment's hesitation—it could lead to devastating consequences.</p><p>Two peak late Nascent Soul cultivators finally revealed their fangs!</p><p>Qin Sang felt an unprecedented level of pressure.  Each late Nascent Soul cultivator possessed formidable abilities. Facing two or even three simultaneously wasn't a simple matter of addition. If it weren't for her thunder beast guard, she wouldn't even consider fighting back.</p><p>In this critical moment, Qin Sang's eyes remained calm and clear. She moved swiftly, shielding Liuli.</p><p>Her blood surged, her bones cracked, and golden light instantly illuminated the heavens as a golden sun rose majestically.</p><p>Sun Wheel Seal!</p><p>Her physical form channeled her true essence, the golden sun crashing into the phoenix claw.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The golden sun seemed to be torn apart by the claw.</p><p>A brilliant golden explosion occurred, but a dark patch within the golden light remained unconsumed, unable to advance.</p><p>Unfortunately, Qin Sang's physical strength had not broken through the mid-Nascent Soul stage. She felt a surge of blood, and her Mingshan Armor clattered, its surface patterns flickering erratically.</p><p>Though the claw lacked the power of the Void Domain, it was still incredibly powerful. This person was probably the strongest of the three.</p><p>Qin Sang had a fleeting thought, unaware that his opponents were even more surprised.  The scholar in green robes, in particular, hadn't anticipated Qin Sang's exceptional spirit defense. The Netherworld Dragonfly's power was completely ineffective against Qin Sang; it couldn't even restrain him for a moment.  Their carefully planned ambush had failed completely.</p><p>At that moment, Qin Sang saw Liuli’s eyes tightly closed, her expression pained, and he felt a surge of worry.</p><p>After a moment, Liuli exhaled softly and shook her head slightly, signaling that she was alright.</p><p>Thanks to the Emperor’s Command Talisman, Liuli’s spirit had been strengthened by the talisman’s power, making a world of difference. While it couldn't immediately free her from the Netherworld Dragonfly's power, it prevented her spirit from being easily locked down.</p><p>Having broken free from the soul-binding spell, Liuli quickly recovered.</p><p>Qin Sang, relieved, flew swiftly with Liuli, significantly increasing the distance between them and the Panlong Cave.</p><p>In contrast, the black-robed cultivator and the man in green robes found their plan thwarted.  They failed to stop Qin Sang and were further distanced, forced to continue the pursuit.</p><p>The chase continued, Panlong Cave now within sight.</p><p>The black-robed cultivator and the man in green robes sensed unusual energy fluctuations ahead.</p><p>The black-robed cultivator slowed his flight.  Beneath his robe, a silver glint appeared, like a silver eye opening.</p><p>His vision pierced the fog, revealing a scene in the distance.</p><p>Amidst the mountains, a red glow filled the sky, staining the surrounding mist crimson, like an erupting volcano. The source of the red light was a massive cave opening.</p><p>“Not good! They intend to escape using this secret realm!”</p><p>Seeing Panlong Cave, the black-robed cultivator immediately understood Qin Sang and Liuli's intention and quickly transmitted a message.</p><p>The man in green robes snorted. The insect cloud transformed again, this time into a gigantic beetle.</p><p>The massive beetle was entirely black, with a heavy luster. Its pincers were enormous. It raised its head and smashed it down with immense force.</p><p>*BOOM!*</p><p>The earth cracked.  Visible waves of earth surged forward, shattering mountains in their path, engulfing them and spreading with overwhelming force.</p><p>The earth waves contained unimaginable power, exploding at the entrance of Panlong Cave.</p><p>Just as Qin Sang and Liuli were about to escape into the cave, the ground split open, revealing two immense yellowish-brown hands, fingers like mountains, blocking the entrance and seizing towards them.</p><p>Simultaneously, a boy's shout echoed from behind. He had finally caught up.  "Fellow Daoists, quickly stop them!"</p><p>His strategy proved effective. Qin Sang's lightning escape technique was hampered. If not for the sudden appearance of Panlong Cave, Qin Sang and Liuli would have been trapped by the three.</p><p>Having almost glimpsed victory, a new obstacle emerged, filling the boy with anger and surprise.</p><p>Accompanying his shout were three white shadows, his three spirit beasts.</p><p>The black-robed cultivator naturally wouldn’t show mercy.</p><p>Two silver blades appeared, circling in the air, harassing Qin Sang relentlessly.  The black-robed cultivator then managed to entangle the Grey Warbler Sword, and a small drum emerged from his waist.</p><p>*Dong!*</p><p>The drum beat resonated, and the two silver blades underwent a dramatic change.  Their blade light transformed into two silver mountains, crashing down on Qin Sang’s back.</p><p>With giant hands blocking their path, Qin Sang remained calm, anticipating this. He unleashed his lightning techniques in advance.</p><p>As the yellowish-brown hands emerged from the earth, thunderbolts struck from the sky.</p><p>*Crack!*</p><p>Several fingers were instantly blown away, the palm itself riddled with cracks.</p><p>As Qin Sang and Liuli were about to slip through the crack, sensing the danger behind, they called upon Xiao Wu, using five-element divine light to repel the boy’s spirit beasts, and once again unleashed the Sun Seal.</p><p>However, as the drum sounded, the golden sun faltered, becoming unsteady.</p><p>Qin Sang’s expression darkened. He forced the golden sun forward.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The silver mountains fell. Liuli sensed danger and immediately acted. A layer of frost covered Qin Sang, his body convulsed, his face turning pale, and a crack appeared in his Mingshan Armor.</p><p>Noticing the change in Qin Sang’s aura, Liuli’s eyes flashed with worry, but she understood his intentions.</p><p>The opponents clearly targeted that secret realm.  Unless they were willing to abandon the opportunity, even if they escaped this time, they might be pursued again.</p><p>Only a decisive solution would suffice – eliminate the boy.  The other two would probably not fight them to the death.</p><p>They had been revealing their trump cards, testing their opponents’ strength.</p><p>If the environment within Panlong Cave remained unchanged, they might have a chance to counterattack using the terrain. Qin Sang clearly was unwilling to give up, taking the blow head-on rather than revealing his Thunder Beast Guard.</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>The red light violently pulsed. A bolt of azure lightning descended, followed by the Nine Turns Annihilation Wind.</p><p>In an instant, the insect cloud and the black-robed cultivator arrived first.</p><p>“He’s injured!”</p><p>The black-robed cultivator declared confidently.</p><p>Qin Sang and Liuli had not yet vanished from their perception.  Without hesitation, both plunged into the cave.</p>
