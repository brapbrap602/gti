<h1>Chapter 810: Timeline</h1><p>Wu, the sect master, owes his current standing to the guidance of the Linggui Island Master.  He feels immense gratitude and considers the Island Master his mentor. Recalling the Island Master's fate fills him with sorrow and rage.</p><p>This outcome surprised Qin Sang.  Elder Qingzhu, living incognito in such a remote area, was he hiding from an enemy?</p><p>And that enemy found him, reducing his cave abode to ruins.</p><p>He remembers Elder Qingzhu's note left at the Qisha Hall.</p><p>Three large characters—sighs—filled with boundless sorrow.</p><p>Did Elder Qingzhu already foresee his end, leaving a final message?</p><p>"When did this happen?  What was the Island Master's enemy's identity?" Qin Sang didn't want to have made this trip in vain, and pressed for details.</p><p>"Two years ago!"</p><p>Wu, the sect master, gave a date that astonished Qin Sang. So recent!  Shortly after the last Qisha Hall opening.</p><p>So, until the incident, Elder Qingzhu was still in the Canglang Sea!</p><p>"No one knows who the elder's enemy was. The elder never mentioned it. We were only permitted to listen to his lectures on the island; he never formally accepted any disciples.</p><p>"That day, I was cultivating in the mountains.  Later, I heard from rumors that the battle was terrifying, capable of world-shattering destruction. Linggui Island was completely destroyed. Some said only a Yuan Ying master could cause such devastation.</p><p>"After the elder's death, everyone was filled with fear.  We were grateful for his kindness, but our cultivation was too low. We could do nothing, and dared not reveal any thoughts…"</p><p>Wu, the sect master, seemed to have been holding back for a long time. Meeting Qin Sang, a listener, he couldn't contain himself, his emotions overflowing, his voice choked with emotion.</p><p>"Did anyone witness the battle, see the outcome?"</p><p>Qin Sang didn't believe Elder Qingzhu would be killed so easily.</p><p>Elder Qingzhu's arrival in the Canglang Sea was almost three hundred years ago.  Even then, he was nearing the peak of the Foundation Establishment stage, and he had been cultivating while simultaneously creating his own techniques.</p><p>Given Elder Qingzhu's talent, it's hard to imagine what he might have achieved by now.</p><p>Even if someone told him Elder Qingzhu had become a late-stage Yuan Ying cultivator, Qin Sang wouldn't be surprised.  Even if he couldn't win, couldn't he have escaped?</p><p>Wu, the sect master sighed, "Bamen Island and Linggui Island are not far apart. The battle alarmed the cultivators on the island. Many witnessed it. Some, too close, were caught in the blast and perished.  It's said that at the battle's end, a demon laughed maniacally, and no one escaped the island…"</p><p>Qin Sang's heart sank.</p><p>Wu, the sect master continued, "The elder seemed to have foreseen this calamity.  Years ago, after a lecture, he said he would leave and would no longer give lectures, sealing the island. For years, Linggui Island was sealed by a formation. We thought he was gone; some had even forgotten him. Only after the incident two years ago did we know he hadn't left, but was hiding from his enemy, and still couldn't escape."</p><p>Qin Sang pressed, "So, even if the elder hadn't perished, my trip was for naught?  Do you remember when the island was sealed?"</p><p>Wu, the sect master thought, "Over fifty years ago.  I was still at the Qi Condensation stage then, knew nothing of cultivation, and relied on self-study, taking many detours. It was only after hearing the elder's lectures that I could achieve Foundation Establishment."</p><p>Fifty years!</p><p>The cultivator surnamed Wang was traveling at the time and didn't know about the island's sealing.</p><p>This information was crucial.</p><p>Qin Sang was surprised. This was the time the Qisha Hall last appeared, and also when the Ziwei Palace opened.</p><p>It couldn't be a coincidence!</p><p>Qin Sang realized that Elder Qingzhu's words were not idle. He likely found a teleportation array, allowing him to leave the Liefeng Islands and the Canglang Sea, returning to his homeland.</p><p>But for some reason, Elder Qingzhu didn't leave, returning to Linggui Island, where his enemy found him.</p><p>Qin Sang lowered his head, his mind in chaos, piecing together the timeline based on the information he had.</p><p>The previous Ziwei Palace opening was about three hundred years ago.  Qingzhu provoked a powerful enemy in the Ziwei Palace, facing life or death, and was forced to flee to the Canglang Sea.</p><p>Then, over two hundred years ago, Qingzhu hid his identity, arriving at the remote Linggui Island, where he remained.</p><p>Now it seems he was hiding from an enemy. That explains why Qin Sang had been unable to find Qingzhu for so long.</p><p>For years, Qingzhu had frequently lectured and guided independent cultivators, but never took on disciples. Qin Sang was certain that Qingzhu had been present every time the Qisha Palace opened.  Fifty years ago, when the Qisha Palace spontaneously appeared and the Ziwei Palace reopened, Qingzhu secluded himself on his island.</p><p>Two years ago, Linggui Island was attacked, and Qingzhu disappeared.  It remains unknown when he left the sword marks, jade slip, and sorrowful letter in the Qisha Palace.</p><p>The timeline fits; it's almost certain that the master of Linggui Island was the senior cultivator Qingzhu.</p><p>While his whereabouts are now clearer, many questions remain.</p><p>Who was Qingzhu's enemy, and why did he fear them so much? Why didn't he leave? Was there a problem with the teleportation array?</p><p>“Countless people visited the senior cultivator after he secluded himself, but all were turned away. Even if Daoist Qin had arrived two years earlier, you wouldn't have seen him… Daoist Qin… Daoist Qin…”</p><p>Master Wu noticed Qin Sang’s silence.  “What is it?” he asked, surprised.</p><p>“Oh,” Qin Sang shook her head, her voice dejected. “Nothing.  It’s difficult for us independent cultivators to seek the Dao. I thought I'd finally found a master, but I was disappointed again.”</p><p>Master Wu empathized. “Though the senior cultivator is gone, his legacy remains. I have several friends who studied under him. They often gather to discuss the Dao and share their knowledge freely. Daoist Qin saved my entire sect; if you don’t mind, I can introduce you to them.”</p><p>“Thank you, Daoist Master. However, I admire the senior cultivator's achievements and wish to visit Bamen Island and Linggui Island first to pay my respects. I will visit you at another time.”</p><p>Qin Sang bowed and continued to question Master Wu about the past. Master Wu, suspecting nothing and seeing Qin Sang's great curiosity about the master of Linggui Island, recounted his experiences in detail.</p><p>As they talked, the rocking of the boat lessened. A disciple came down, excitedly shouting that the storm had stopped.</p><p>Master Wu's injuries had improved, and the two went on deck. The sea was calm, but shrouded in fog. Their boat drifted alone, surrounded by water; the storm had blown them to an unknown location.</p><p>Master Wu and his disciples took some time to determine their position.</p><p>“Daoist Qin, head southeast to reach Bamen Island. The sea fog is heavy—a time when sea monsters are active—so be careful.  Fortunately, this isn't the southern part of the archipelago; the fog should lift soon.”</p><p>Master Wu wanted to escort Qin Sang but she declined, accepting his directions.</p>
