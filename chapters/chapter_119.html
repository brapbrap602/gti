Chapter 112: Fortune and Misfortune


Mount Shaohua's scenery remained as beautiful as ever.

Qin Sang piloted his Flying Shuttle through Sword Gate Pass, heading towards Daomen Peak.  A figure flew towards him, and it was none other than Senior Brother Zhuang Yan. Zhuang Yan had been preparing for secluded cultivation to attempt Foundation Establishment, but for some unknown reason, he had given up.

“Greetings, Senior Brother Zhuang.”

Qin Sang stopped his flying light and bowed from afar.

Zhuang Yan landed his sword beside Qin Sang. Seeing Qin Sang's expression, he asked with concern, "Junior Brother Qin, your complexion doesn't look good.  Is something troubling you?"

Qin Sang shook his head, forcing a smile.  "No, I just noticed that the colorful clouds above Pure Moon Peak have completely dissipated, so I’m a little puzzled. Has something happened recently in the sect?"

Pure Moon Peak was not only exceptionally beautiful, but also had lingering clouds above it that never dispersed, making it very conspicuous. Zhuang Yan had said that it was a formation set up by the sect to prevent others from disturbing Immortal Chenyan's closed-door cultivation.

Qin Sang had still seen them the last time he returned, but this time, as soon as he entered Sword Gate Pass, he discovered that the clouds above Pure Moon Peak had vanished.

Zhuang Yan gave a soft "Oh" and glanced towards Pure Moon Peak in the distance. "Junior Brother Qin has been in the Earth Sink Cave and probably hasn't heard. Immortal Chenyan emerged from seclusion a few days ago."

"Immortal Chenyan has emerged?"

Qin Sang quickly asked, "Did she break through to Nascent Soul?"

If Immortal Chenyan had achieved Nascent Soul, Mount Shaohua would have two Nascent Soul ancestors, instantly elevating it to a top-tier power within the Small Cold Region.  The disciples of the sect would also benefit greatly.

Zhuang Yan's expression darkened slightly, and he shook his head without speaking.

Qin Sang sighed softly. Every step forward on the path of cultivation was more difficult than ascending to heaven.  It was said that Immortal Chenyan was a prodigy with a Heaven Spiritual Root. After so many years in seclusion, she still failed.  Qin Sang couldn't help but think of himself, his mood becoming even more downcast.

“Senior Brother Zhuang, is Uncle Wen at Daomen Peak?”

“What does Junior Brother need from Uncle Wen?”

Zhuang Yan paused, looked Qin Sang over, and suddenly realized something. He quickly congratulated him, “Congratulations, Junior Brother Qin, on breaking through to the tenth level of Qi Refining! You’re here to retrieve your Foundation Establishment Pill, right? Uncle Wen happens to be at Daomen Peak.”

After seeing Zhuang Yan off, the smile on Qin Sang's face quickly faded, replaced by a faint worry.

After erasing Sun De's traces, Qin Sang hadn't rushed back to Mount Shaohua to retrieve the Foundation Establishment Pill. Instead, he decided to stay in his cave for a while and observe how Mount Shaohua would handle Sun De's disappearance.

In the end, Mount Shaohua didn't suspect him. Only one senior brother came to the Earth Sink Cave afterward, asked him a few questions, and then left in a hurry. The matter seemed to have been dropped.

Successfully clearing himself of suspicion, coupled with the three Foundation Establishment Pills he was about to receive, should have been cause for joy, even ecstasy.

But then, devastating news struck Qin Sang like a bolt from the blue, plunging him into despair.

Before this, he had been consolidating his realm, so he hadn't noticed the abnormality of the Yama Banner.  It was only when he resumed his cultivation that he discovered that although Yama hadn't become the main soul of the Ten Yama Banner and could still provide Soul Pills, the pills no longer had any effect on him!

He tried everything, even switching to a different Yama Banner, but the result was the same.

This change was like a thunderbolt to Qin Sang.

His talent was so poor, yet his cultivation speed could rival many True Spiritual Root or even Dual Spiritual Root cultivators, all thanks to the Yama Banner and Soul Pills. Without the support of the Soul Pills, Qin Sang's cultivation speed was truly despairing.

Even with three Foundation Establishment Pills, if he couldn't break through to the thirteenth level of Qi Refining and reach the peak of Qi Refining before the age of fifty, his hope of Foundation Establishment was extremely slim.

Qin Sang racked his brains. Unless he could gather enough Foundation Strengthening Pills, or find another artifact or cultivation method similar to the Yama Banner, one with great hidden dangers to the soul but capable of rapidly increasing cultivation, these were obviously not easy to find.

Lost in his thoughts, he unknowingly arrived in front of the wooden hall on Daomen Peak.  Qin Sang composed himself, put on a respectful expression, and knocked on the hall door.

Uncle Wen happened to be inside the hall handling some minor matters. Hearing that Qin Sang had come to retrieve his Foundation Establishment Pill, he looked somewhat surprised and smiled. "You've broken through to the tenth level in such a short time after joining the sect. It seems that the spiritual fruit you consumed was quite extraordinary. Follow me."

Qin Sang followed behind Uncle Wen. The two left Daomen Peak and flew towards the depths of Mount Shaohua, eventually arriving at Pagoda Peak.

"Wait here for a moment."

Uncle Wen led Qin Sang to the entrance of the second floor of Pagoda Peak, took his identity token, and instructed him to wait outside before entering alone.


Not long after, Qin Sang heard Elder Wen call him in. He adjusted his clothes, lowered his head, and respectfully entered. Inside the hall, he found only Elder Wen and another elderly man.

"This is Elder Ye," Elder Wen said, gesturing towards the older man.

Qin Sang respectfully bowed. "Disciple Qin Sang greets Elder Ye."

Elder Ye wore a blue-white robe. His small eyes were slightly narrowed, carrying a hint of a smile as he looked Qin Sang over. If not for the occasional glint in his eyes, Qin Sang would have thought he was facing a kind old man.

"So this is Disciple Qin. Truly a fine young man!" Elder Ye said with surprising warmth. "Indeed, you have broken through to the tenth level of Qi Refining, meeting the sect's requirements. Please wait a moment, I'll fetch a Foundation Establishment Pill."

Hearing footsteps approaching the hall, Qin Sang secretly breathed a sigh of relief, glad there were no complications.

Unexpectedly, before he could fully relax, Elder Wen suddenly raised his hand, casting a soundproof barrier. He coughed lightly, a slightly embarrassed expression appearing on his face. "Disciple Qin," he began, "Elder Ye asked me to inquire if you'd be willing to sell this Foundation Establishment Pill."

Qin Sang was taken aback. His expression shifted slightly. The Foundation Establishment Pill was crucial for a cultivator's path.  Unless someone had completely given up on establishing their foundation, who would sell theirs?

"Disciple Qin, don't be nervous," Elder Wen said softly, trying to reassure him. He was also in a difficult position.  Elder Ye, upon learning that Qin Sang had five spiritual roots, immediately had this idea and asked for his help to broker the deal. If Elder Ye hadn't helped him with a small favor in the past, he would never have done such a thing.  "If you're unwilling to sell, it's fine. Elder Ye is just asking. He isn't forcing you. If you are willing, spirit stones, talismans, artifacts, or elixirs, these are all negotiable. Elder Ye is quite well-off and won't let you suffer a loss."

Qin Sang lowered his head in thought. What he wanted most were foundation-strengthening elixirs. Although rare, they could be bought. The Foundation Establishment Pill, however, was truly priceless. Disciples of cultivation sects usually received only one, and rogue cultivators could only dream of obtaining one.  This was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity he wasn't about to let pass by.  He was certain he wouldn't trade it. However, the other party was a Foundation Establishment cultivator, so even a refusal couldn't be too blunt.

After a moment of consideration, Qin Sang said with a troubled expression, "Elder Wen, this disciple has always been devoted to the path of immortality, never wavering.  I am not willing to give up without trying..."
