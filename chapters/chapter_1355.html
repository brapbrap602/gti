<h1>Chapter 1347:  A Plea for Reconsideration</h1><p>Chapter 1347:  A Plea for Reconsideration</p><p>“You dare!”</p><p>Yu Gu returned to the blood-red altar, the scene before him igniting his fury.</p><p>Above the blood-red altar, the sky was overcast.  The void seemed torn apart by a tremendous force, filled with visible spatial turbulence. A mysterious array, glowing green, slowly rotated. The blood-red altar was also affected; chaotic forces formed a storm, with the array at its center.</p><p>Ye Laomo hovered beneath the array.  Even with his powerful cultivation, he was struggling against the storm's onslaught, his body shimmering with strange light as he activated protective techniques to maintain his footing.</p><p>Opposite Ye Laomo, a figure appeared—precisely where Yu Gu had been moments before.  It was Bai! This time, he was not lurking in the shadows but openly revealed.</p><p>Bai floated in the air, his gaze seemingly unfocused on Ye Laomo, intent on his own actions. His fingers moved with the speed of butterflies, weaving incredibly complex and unprecedented hand seals that flew from his hands, flowing into the blood-red altar like water.</p><p>As he moved, strange phenomena appeared on the altar. The most striking was the array. Its green glow intensified, illuminating the surroundings with breathtaking clarity.  The ghostly mist and specters were tinged with green, and the array spun faster, its runes becoming clearer and more complete.</p><p>Grand and mysterious! A vast, ancient aura emanated from the array, reaching for the heavens.</p><p>Bai tilted his head slightly, gazing at the array, his eyes filled with growing excitement.</p><p>Ye Laomo stood motionless, making no move, silently observing Bai's actions.  He watched the array's transformation, a flicker of surprise crossing his face as he scrutinized the suddenly appeared mysterious person.  He never imagined that, in this era, besides that barely surviving demon, anyone else knew how to activate the altar's prohibitions.</p><p>Bai did not conceal his aura. Ye Laomo easily sensed Bai's corpse king body.  Bai's cultivation seemed inferior, yet Ye Laomo felt a subtle threat emanating from him, inspiring a degree of apprehension. He racked his brain, unable to recall when such a person appeared in Beichen.  There were many corpse cultivators in Beichen, but few had reached the Yuan Ying stage, as the major domains had been dominated by righteous cultivators. Ye Laomo had interacted with most of them, but couldn't connect this person to any of them.</p><p>“How did a corpse king appear out of nowhere? Is it another ancient being? How many such beings are hidden in the cultivation world, biding their time?”</p><p>For the first time, Ye Laomo felt that Beichen held many secrets unknown even to him.  Yu Gu was using this to force his compliance. If Bai could activate the altar, it might not be a bad thing.  Ye Laomo, after some thought, did nothing, allowing Bai to proceed, watching developments.</p><p>However, Ye Laomo's peripheral vision remained fixed on the direction Yu Gu had left.</p><p>Sure enough, Bai's actions were immediately sensed by Yu Gu.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>Yu Gu exploded with rage, charging towards the altar.</p><p>Bai calmly withdrew his gaze from the array, glancing at Yu Gu before turning to Ye Laomo with a meaningful expression.  "I urge you to reconsider, friend!"</p><p>The words were clearly a warning to Ye Laomo, urging him to assess the situation.</p><p>Ye Laomo sneered. But to his surprise, Ye Laomo didn’t intervene, clasping his hands in a gesture of non-interference.</p><p>After issuing his warning, Bai turned his icy gaze to Yu Gu.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>Yu Gu was enveloped in purple light, like a cocoon.  His true form was obscured, but his rising power and formidable aura were palpable.</p><p>In an instant, Yu Gu closed in, a massive purple palm smashing towards Bai.</p><p>Bai seemed stunned, standing motionless, making no attempt to defend himself.</p><p>Ye Laomo frowned slightly, questioning his judgment.  Even if Bai was concealing his strength, he shouldn't be so reckless against Yu Gu. Otherwise, why would Ye Laomo fear Yu Gu so much?</p><p>In a flash, Yu Gu was within striking distance.</p><p>Suddenly, a faint ethereal starlight erupted below the altar.  Initially dim, it rapidly expanded into a colossal beam of light that shot skyward, engulfing Yu Gu who had flown into its path.</p><p>Within the pillar of light, starlight shimmered, like a miniature cosmos.  These specks of light were star essence stones.</p><p>At the base of the pillar, amidst the starstones, a slender figure solidified from nothingness, revealing herself to be Qing Jun, long thought vanished!</p><p>Qing Jun's eyelids drooped as her jade fingers manipulated threads of light, arranging the stars.</p><p>The starstones became pieces in her hands, moving like real stars, seemingly chaotic yet following a unique pattern.  These were the very starstones Qin Sang had retrieved from the Heavenly Finger Peak.</p><p>The Yuan Shen Gate possessed numerous ancient formations, some requiring starstones for activation; this spirit formation was one of them.  Qing Zhu's tragedy, it could be said, stemmed from these starstones.</p><p>Qing Jun, having seized the Yuan Shen Gate, studied ancient texts and deciphered this spirit formation.  When Bai flew to the altar and activated the formation, she was hidden here, secretly deploying the spirit array, awaiting Yu Gu's return.  Provoked by Bai, Yu Gu, without noticing, fell right into the trap!</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The starlight shook.</p><p>Inside the pillar, streaks of starlight crisscrossed, forming a cage that imprisoned Yu Gu. This formation had a binding effect!</p><p>Unfortunately, Qing Jun's opponent was too powerful.</p><p>Trapped by the spirit array, Yu Gu fought back fiercely. The intense purple light threatened to overwhelm the starlight, causing it to dissipate; the cage was on the verge of collapsing.</p><p>*Bang! Bang! Bang!*</p><p>The starstones shattered under the assault.  Yu Gu's demonic flames blazed.</p><p>A flicker of surprise crossed Qing Jun's calm gaze.  She hadn't anticipated Yu Gu's strength, nor his experience; he repeatedly targeted the formation's weaknesses, leaving her no time to repair them.  At this rate, Yu Gu would break free within moments.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>A swathe of starlight extinguished.  The purple energy intensified.</p><p>Qing Jun, needing to personally control the array, couldn't escape.</p><p>At this critical moment, a chain pierced the air, vanishing into the spirit formation, slithering through the purple light like a serpent.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>Qin Sang followed closely, arriving just in time, his breath ragged.  He had almost missed the opportunity, exerting every ounce of strength, but thankfully, he made it. Without hesitation, he formed a hand seal, and a magic binding rope array appeared above his head. With a flick of his finger, it floated towards Yu Gu.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>The purple light scattered.  Yu Gu's true form was revealed.  Around him, coiled numerous chains—the binding ropes!</p><p>The ropes contracted, tiny black lightning bolts shooting from the iron chains, needle-like, piercing Yu Gu. (To be continued)</p>
