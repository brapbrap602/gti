<h1>Chapter 1374: Escape</h1><p>Two cultivators pursued for a while, only to watch the green light fade into the distance, leaving them far behind.</p><p>"Enough! Let's not chase. It might lead to misunderstandings."</p><p>The elder in green robes halted his pursuit, calling out to his companion.</p><p>Continuing the chase would only arouse suspicion and invite unwanted trouble.</p><p>...</p><p>Bi Fang escaped.</p><p>The two Yuan Ying cultivators stopped.</p><p>Qin Sang observed everything, remaining vigilant and maintaining his escape technique.  After his Sky-Eye Butterfly confirmed that their pursuers had vanished, Qin Sang finally relaxed, deactivated his escape technique, and descended to the sea.  The chase had nearly depleted his already low spiritual energy reserves.</p><p>Qin Sang sighed softly, glancing behind him.  The sheer number of demon kings and Yuan Ying cultivators gathered here filled him with unease. He feared he had inadvertently stumbled into a dangerous situation. In his current weakened state, any disturbance could prove fatal.  A newcomer, Qin Sang had no desire to be embroiled in conflict.  He needed to understand the identities and origins of the parties involved, and the cause of the turmoil, before making any decisions.</p><p>"Best to leave this place, the further the better…" Qin Sang muttered, producing a nautical chart. He estimated his location.  He noticed several scattered islands between his current position and Xuan Yue Island.  The chart indicated that these islands were under human control, some even ruled by human cultivators, including several human sects.  However, their current safety was uncertain.</p><p>After a brief rest, Qin Sang selected a relatively remote island to investigate. This island, named Xian Cui Island, was inhabited by cultivators; the chart indicated that the strongest cultivator on the island was only at the late Foundation Establishment stage.</p><p>Qin Sang suppressed his aura, flying low to the water, significantly slowing his speed, maintaining a low profile, and instructing his Sky-Eye Butterfly to remain vigilant.  Fortunately, he encountered no other cultivators or demonic beasts along the way.</p><p>He reached Xian Cui Island at midnight.  From a distance, Qin Sang observed the quiet island, cautiously approaching. A thriving human city occupied the island, resembling a small independent kingdom. Without asking any humans, Qin Sang could see that a mountain range shrouded in ethereal clouds was at the island's center – a manifestation of a powerful spirit formation. This was certainly a cultivator's abode.</p><p>Secretly entering a human city, Qin Sang sensed cultivator auras within the governor's mansion, but only at the Qi Condensation stage. Inside the governor's mansion, several cultivators gathered in a hall, whispering amongst themselves. Some appeared excited, while others looked bewildered and hesitant. A common thread among them was the worry etched in their eyes.  These cultivators were richly dressed, exuding an air of affluence that suggested a pampered lifestyle.</p><p>"Has anyone seen the island master lately?" A corpulent middle-aged man in a dragon robe, clearly exasperated by the others, abruptly interrupted, his voice low.</p><p>The others looked at each other, startled.</p><p>"The island master summoned us two months ago…"</p><p>The man in the dragon robe coldly interrupted, "Spare me the obvious! I know he summoned us two months ago. I'm asking if anyone has seen the island master, or the Wang siblings, since then!"</p><p>"Shh! Your Highness, keep your voice down!"  The others' expressions changed, instinctively glancing toward the sacred mountain.</p><p>The man in the dragon robe, also wary, calmed himself, whispering, "For the past month, I've used various excuses to visit the sacred mountain, but that old guard always turns me away. The Wang siblings, still young and impetuous, usually come down the mountain every month or so, lingering outside. Yet, they've been in seclusion for so long.  Coupled with the rumors from outside the island, it’s hard not to be suspicious!"</p><p>"You mean…" A younger man beside him, seemingly a prince, looked panicked, "The island master received advance warning and left Xian Cui Island?  Why didn't he tell us?"</p><p>The man in the dragon robe sneered, "What are we?  Just tools used by the island master to control the mortals, given a few small favors. We don't even possess complete Qi Condensation cultivation techniques. Only the Wang siblings are the island master’s direct disciples!"</p><p>An older prince, who had remained silent, twirled prayer beads in his hand, and said gravely, "Rumor has it that the island master is very influential.  A Golden Core cultivator once visited and was remarkably courteous…"</p><p>The old prince sighed, "It seems… things are about to change!"</p><p>The man in the dragon robe clenched his fists. "If it's an internal conflict among cultivators, they probably won't notice us. We can always find a new master later. But if the rumors about the frequent demonic beast appearances outside the island are true, and it’s a demon invasion…"</p><p>A collective shudder ran through the group. The brutality of demonic beasts was far more terrifying than death at the hands of cultivators.  If that happened, Xian Cui Island would be devastated, its inhabitants slaughtered.</p><p>"What do we do?" Panic gripped them.  If their suspicions were wrong, and they left the island without the island master's orders, their punishment would be severe.</p><p>At that moment, everyone froze, their voices abruptly ceasing. Some even had their mouths open, as if time itself had solidified.</p><p>The night pearls illuminating the area dimmed, and a figure emerged—Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang looked at the immobilized people, extending a finger to touch the center of one person's forehead.</p><p>After a short while, Qin Sang left the governor's mansion.</p><p>Uncertain about the identities of the two Yuan Ying cultivators encountered earlier.</p><p>Qin Sang, unwilling to reveal her presence, chose the more troublesome approach of questioning each person individually and then erasing their memories.</p><p>Back in the room, the restraints on everyone were lifted, and they resumed their heated discussion, completely unaware of the small slice of time missing from their lives.</p><p>Qin Sang then entered the Immortal Mountain.</p><p>The protective spirit array was quite powerful, but to the Tianmu butterfly's eyes, it was riddled with flaws. Qin Sang easily infiltrated the mountain.</p><p>The Immortal Mountain was deserted, only a so-called "gatekeeper" remained. This old man, indebted to the island master, was tasked with guarding the cave.</p><p>"The island master left two months ago. Recently, more than one dragon ship has been attacked, and demonic beasts have frequently appeared..."</p><p>Qin Sang gathered considerable information, suspecting something was amiss.</p><p>This place wasn't safe either.</p><p>"I must leave this dangerous place as soon as possible. Only upon reaching Crescent Island can I safely recover."</p><p>Qin Sang occupied the island master's cave.</p><p>The spiritual veins here were unsatisfactory, so Qin Sang didn't dare stay long. After recovering 30% of her true essence, she swiftly departed.</p><p>Qin Sang's visit went unnoticed.  No one on the Verdant Emerald Island knew they had been visited by a Yuan Ying cultivator.</p><p>Vast ocean.</p><p>A streak of light sped towards them, circling briefly in the air.</p><p>Ripples formed on the water's surface, followed by a distortion in the void, revealing the faint outline of a small island. The light flashed, entered the island, and vanished.</p><p>The island was small.</p><p>A palace, nearly occupying half the island's space, stood on it.</p><p>The palace was resplendent. The green-robed elder who had startled away the Bi Fang sat in the great hall. The scholar in white wasn't there, but two other Yuan Ying cultivators were.</p><p>These two sat below, patiently listening to the green-robed elder.</p><p>The moment the streak of light entered, they had already noticed.</p><p>The green-robed elder fell silent, looking towards the outside of the palace.</p>
