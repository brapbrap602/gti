<h1>Chapter 1133: The Seven-Killing Sword Formation</h1><p>Chapter 1133: The Seven-Killing Sword Formation</p><p>Having broken through to the fourth level of *Heavenly Demon Refining*, and with the Sky-Eyed Butterfly advancing to its fourth transformation, both significantly aid in the formation of a Nascent Soul.  However, Qin Sang remains clueless about advancing his spirit insects, forcing him to seek other solutions.  Having uncovered clues related to the stone tablet and the Qingluan phantom, he can't afford to ignore them.  Why not try?</p><p>Having made his decision, Qin Sang didn't rush into action.  He used the Sword Wheel as a base, integrating elements from the Puppet Sword Formation, the *Chapter on Cultivating Swords Through the Soul*, and the *Green Bamboo Sword Scripture*.  He finally created his own sword formation.  To call it original is perhaps a little immodest.</p><p>The formation is rooted in the Seven Souls Killing Formation from the *Chapter on Cultivating Swords Through the Soul*, but his cultivation is insufficient to fully grasp its essence.  He could only incorporate the various changes of the Puppet Sword Formation.  Even more crucial is the *Green Bamboo Sword Scripture*.</p><p>Senior Green Bamboo was an undeniable sword dao genius, capable of creating killing talismans and extending his cultivation techniques even at the Core Formation stage.  Though he’d only grasped a portion of the scripture's true meaning, Qin Sang benefited immensely, making significant strides in his sword dao.  After careful refinement, the sword formation took shape.</p><p>Outside the cave dwelling…</p><p>Qin Sang, using his flying technique, found a clear space.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>A green figure, swift as lightning, shot towards him.  It came to an abrupt halt in mid-air, the green light fading to reveal a figure with phoenix wings.</p><p>Qin Sang activated his Heavenly Demon Transformation, sensing the improvements from years of arduous cultivation.  His physical body and cultivation base had both broken through, leading to a substantial increase in his strength.  His improved flight technique serves as a clear example.</p><p>With the Heavenly Demon Transformation active, he could fully utilize the strength of his dual cultivation of body and spirit, surpassing even his previous speed when using three different magical techniques simultaneously.  Coupled with his ability to freely control the Nine Dragon Heavenly Chariot Talisman and unleash the full power of his secret talismans, along with his enhanced sword dao cultivation, the combination of these various techniques allows Qin Sang to estimate his speed to be comparable to an early Nascent Soul cultivator.</p><p>Three-colored遁光 flickered. Qin Sang instantly vanished into the depths of the mountains, quickly reappearing. His improved flight ability is evident.  A satisfied smile touched Qin Sang's lips; this will be his ultimate life-saving technique.</p><p>"Rise!"</p><p>Qin Sang's mind moved slightly.</p><p>The ebony sword trembled, emitting brilliant sword light, shimmering like moonlight.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>The sword light hovered above Qin Sang for a moment.  Following his sword incantations, the ebony sword branched out into new sword beams.  Seven of them formed first.</p><p>These seven beams are the manifestations of his cultivation of the *Chapter on Cultivating Swords Through the Soul*. Senior Green Bamboo called them sword souls.  Qin Sang's cultivation now allows him to fully manifest all seven.  Unlike ordinary sword beams, these contain a hint of his soul essence. However, due to his limited cultivation, he doesn't know how to fully utilize them yet, using them only as the foundation of his sword array.</p><p>More sword beams continuously split off from the spiritual sword, emitting a bright radiance.  The sword beams converged into a river, illuminating Qin Sang's surroundings.</p><p>"Form the array!"</p><p>Qin Sang shouted, changing his incantations.</p><p>A buzzing sound filled the air.  The seven sword souls scattered, surrounding Qin Sang, forming the rudimentary shape of the array.  Other sword beams swiftly appeared, eventually forming a complete sword formation!</p><p>At a glance, the formation is circular, slowly rotating in mid-air, resembling a dazzling sword lotus!  The lotus is sharply defined, incorporating Qin Sang's understanding of the sword dao, along with the knowledge he gained from Senior Green Bamboo.  Even before activation, its sharp edge is apparent!</p><p>Qin Sang stared intently at the formation.  As the incantations changed, so did the formation's shape.  Sometimes it condensed into a towering giant sword; other times it dispersed without any apparent pattern.  He incorporated the changes of the Puppet Sword Formation he had recorded; the effect is quite good.</p><p>Suddenly, all the sword beams frantically retracted, converging into a thick column of light, which shot skyward. This light column was impressive, instantly dispersing the clouds in the sky. Qin Sang looked up, gazing at the light column until the glow disappeared.  Sensing its power, he nodded slightly.</p><p>"Not as powerful as the Twelve Demon Banners Formation, but it's under my complete control. Also, the Mist Encompassing Pill I bought on Cang Heng Island has a similar effect to Soul-Washing Liquid, instantly enhancing spiritual sense. Unfortunately, it's extremely expensive and rare; I only managed to buy one."</p><p>Although my supply of San Guang Jade Liquid is depleted, my cultivation has greatly improved.  After using the Twelve Demon Banners, my true essence doesn't deplete directly as before; I now have a chance to escape...With these supernatural powers and escape techniques, even facing a Demon King or a Yuan Ying cultivator, I might still have a chance to maneuver…"</p><p>Moreover, his goal was to get close to the stone tablet, not to fight the Demon King to the death.</p><p>Qin Sang dismissed the sword formation, recalled the ebony sword, pondered for a moment, and softly said, "This formation is derived from the Seven Souls Killing Formation. Let's call it the Seven Killing Sword Formation."</p><p>Afterwards, Qin Sang returned to his cave dwelling and spent some time in seclusion, reviewing all his supernatural powers.</p><p>Before leaving, Qin Sang woke Bai.</p><p>To his surprise, Bai agreed to go to Tian Yao Hill with him.</p><p>With Bai's assistance, his chances would increase significantly.</p><p>Leaving the cave dwelling, Qin Sang first went to a familiar market town to inquire about the recent trends in the cultivation world. Then he headed northwest, preparing to enter the Demon Realm via Xian Yao City.</p><p>Xian Yao City is a large city controlled by the Yu Ling Sect, bordering the Demon Realm of Tian Yao Hill. It is said to be supported by Tian Yao Hill and serves as a gateway between Tian Yao Hill and the Xiaohan Region's cultivation world.</p><p>Years ago, Yun Youzi said he had been undercover in Xian Yao City for many years, investigating the whereabouts of the Crimson Cloud Purple Fruit.</p><p>Now Qin Sang knew this was just an excuse Yun Youzi used to avoid revealing his identity.</p><p>He must have known about the Crimson Cloud Purple Fruit long ago.</p><p>In fact, when Yun Youzi manipulated the Demon King's blood prohibition to suppress the Shadow-Devouring Panther during the struggle for the Crimson Cloud Purple Fruit in Ziwei Palace, it already hinted at something.</p><p>However, Qin Sang hadn't considered the possibility of such an extraordinary event as human-demon soul fusion and hadn't thought deeply about it.</p><p>The further west he traveled, the harsher the environment became, and the population thinned out.</p><p>Tian Yao Hill was even more rugged, filled with treacherous mountains and dangerous waters.</p><p>Tian Yao Hill has always had human inhabitants. After cultivators ceded Tian Yao Hill to the demon race, only some of the humans were relocated to this side of the mountain range.</p><p>Xian Yao City, as the borderland between humans and demons, boasts a unique sight of human and demon coexistence, making it arguably the largest demon city in Tian Yao Hill.</p><p>After a long journey, Qin Sang arrived at Xian Yao City, joining a merchant caravan along the way to blend in.</p><p>Entering Xian Yao City, Qin Sang saw a unique sight that even Canglang Sea didn't have.</p><p>Not only were humans walking the streets, but he occasionally saw packs of wolves, tigers, and leopards walking in groups.</p><p>Among them, the leading beasts, although demonic in form, were clearly different. They lacked wildness, spoke human language, were polite, and were indistinguishable from humans; clearly they had been transformed by Di Liu Jiang.</p><p>Under their control, the less intelligent subordinates were well-behaved, and rarely caused harm.</p><p>The city's human inhabitants seemed used to those ferocious beasts, showing no fear.</p><p>Qin Sang wandered through the streets and alleys, arriving at an unassuming shop.</p><p>To his surprise, there was no shopkeeper; a white cat was lazily sprawled on the counter.</p><p>—</p><p>—</p><p>I'm late getting back, only wrote one chapter today, will make up for it later.</p>
