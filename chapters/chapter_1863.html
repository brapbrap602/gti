Chapter 1854: The Baku


‘Clang!’

The instant the sword light touched the white net, the net stretched taut, emitting a resonant clang.  At the same time, the edges of the net began to constrict, attempting to trap the Cloud Wanderer Sword within. Billowing white smoke surged forth, engulfing the sword light, almost obscuring the Cloud Wanderer Sword from view.

The next moment, a ripping sound pierced the air.

The smoke instantly dissipated.  The white net, torn in two, spiraled away. The Cloud Wanderer Sword, having cleaved through the obstruction, shone with a chilling radiance.

Accompanied by a whistling sword cry, the Cloud Wanderer Sword transformed into a rainbow arc of sword energy, its momentum earth-shattering, slashing fiercely towards Marquis Dingxiang!

This strike did not utilize the Seven Souls Killing Formation. Relying solely on Qin Sang's comprehension of the Dao of Slaughter and the Dao of the Sword, its power was already beyond the imagination of ordinary cultivators.

Marquis Dingxiang's expression darkened. He hadn't expected the white net to block this attack. Having tested the might of the Cloud Wanderer Sword, the wariness in his heart intensified. Without hesitation, he opened his mouth and spewed forth a ball of white light.

Within the white light was nestled a jade壶.

The jade pot was quite small, no larger than a hand's grasp. Its shape was no different from an ordinary tea壶, crafted entirely of white jade, pure and flawless, without a trace of blemish or pattern.

The jade pot tilted slightly forward, and white light flickered at its spout. Wisps of smoke began to pour out.

“Shhh…”

The smoke seemed remarkably heavy, emitting a whispering sound as it poured forth.

The white smoke, resembling tea mist, instantly transformed into dozens of wondrous scenes, dazzling the eye.

In the empty air, the smoke suddenly condensed, forming perfect circular rings that floated erratically towards the Cloud Wanderer Sword.

This was, in fact, an illusion. The smoke rings moved with incredible speed, no slower than the sword light, and were far more resilient than their appearance suggested.

“Spiritual Treasure!”

Qin Sang's gaze was drawn to the jade pot. He recognized it as a Spiritual Treasure without a doubt.

He wasn't surprised by this. Marquis Dingxiang was a confidant of King Lingyou. It was said that he had earned the king's favor shortly after becoming a Demon Marquis and had served him for many years.  It would have been strange if he *didn't* possess a Spiritual Treasure.

However, facing such a powerful opponent armed with a Spiritual Treasure, Qin Sang's chances of obtaining the Spirit Tree grew slimmer.

Spiritual Treasures weren't categorized into high, mid, or low grades. Before a true clash, it was impossible to tell which treasure was superior.

‘Whoosh!’

A smoke ring, unerringly accurate, ensnared the sword light, instantly tightening into a binding箍 around the blade.

The sword light dimmed momentarily, but in the next instant, it erupted with a blinding radiance, suppressing the smoke ring's momentum and transforming it into a fragile white hoop.

A tearing sound echoed as the white hoop cracked where it touched the sword's edge. The sword light resembled a coiled dragon about to break free from its restraints.

This collision between Spiritual Treasures was devoid of any embellishment, and the Cloud Wanderer Sword seemed to have gained a slight advantage.

Marquis Dingxiang's face shifted.  He urgently urged the jade pot, and its spout poured forth another wave of thick white smoke that drifted towards the sword light with alarming speed.

‘Swoosh!’

The Cloud Wanderer Sword, having shattered the white hoop, was immediately obstructed by the dense fog.

The jade pot tilted, continuously pouring out white smoke, as if its reserves were inexhaustible.

The roiling smoke could no longer be called mere smoke.  It had formed a river of mist in the air, vast and boundless, surging forward.  Waves of fog rose high, crashing around the sword light.

The Cloud Wanderer Sword was like a boat sailing against the current.

Qin Sang, connected in mind and spirit with his sword, felt the blade grow incredibly heavy. The white fog pressed down like a crushing weight, like a collapsing mountain, its full force bearing down on the spirit sword.

Even with the Cloud Wanderer Sword's sharpness, cleaving through these waves was no easy feat!

‘Hum!’

This sword cry sounded somewhat muffled.

However, the surge of awe-inspiring sword intent that erupted in that moment made Marquis Dingxiang's pupils contract sharply.

In an instant, the sword light soared skyward, imbued with both boundless sword intent and an overwhelming killing intent.

The Seven Souls Killing Formation, the sole sword formation within the "Scripture of Nurturing the Sword with Yuan Shen"!

The Cloud Wanderer Sword, his Natal Spirit Sword!

Although wielded by a mere sword image, the power unleashed in that single moment still made Marquis Dingxiang take notice.

‘Swish!’

The sword's momentum was like a dragon's.

Visible to the naked eye, a dazzling sword light surged upstream within the river of white fog. Wherever it passed, the fog parted, unable to close for a long time.

While the two Spiritual Treasures clashed, Marquis Dingxiang continued to retreat.

He had no desire for a head-on confrontation with Qin Sang.

Such an opponent was indeed rare, and a fierce battle with him, a test of their respective powers, would have been exhilarating.  But this was a life-or-death struggle, not a game.

As long as King Lingyou arrived, victory would be assured.  Therefore, Marquis Dingxiang had decided from the beginning to adopt a defensive strategy.

Marquis Dingxiang retreated, Qin Sang advanced.  The battlefield between man and demon shifted rapidly within the sea of light.

He moved with lightning speed, but his attempts to distance himself from Qin Sang were futile.  Instead, Qin Sang closed in rapidly.  A fierce glint flashed in his eyes as his aura began to subtly shift.

Qin Sang keenly sensed the change in Marquis Dingxiang's aura. It was an aura he recognized.

“Dharmic Form?”

He hadn’t expected Marquis Dingxiang to have comprehended a Dharmic Form. It seemed a fierce battle was inevitable.

Qin Sang sighed inwardly.  The phoenix wings on his back beat rapidly, his speed abruptly increasing.  Streaks of azure lightning tore through the waves of light.

Marquis Dingxiang fixed his gaze on Qin Sang. The shifting aura around him intensified, and a faint white light manifested behind him.

Within the white light, the illusory image of a peculiar demonic beast slowly coalesced.  The beast’s shadow was dozens of times taller than Marquis Dingxiang's human form.

With an elephant's trunk, rhinoceros eyes, a bear's body, and an ox's tail, it was a bizarre-looking beast.

The Dharmic Form was a manifestation of Marquis Dingxiang’s demonic true form.  Qin Sang, seeing this type of demonic beast for the first time, was filled with curiosity.  He rapidly scanned the countless ancient texts and records he had read, searching for a match.

“Baku… Could it be a Baku Demon?”

Qin Sang recalled seeing a record of this demonic beast in an ancient text, along with some descriptions.

Baku Demons were rare, and their tribes were further divided, each possessing unique powers.

Just by looking at the Baku Demon's Dharmic Form, it was impossible to determine which type it belonged to.

As the Baku Demon's Dharmic Form materialized, Qin Sang felt an oppressive aura emanating from it.

To Qin Sang, this pressure wasn't particularly strong. The Baku Demon's Dharmic Form was merely an illusory image, incomparable to his Azure Phoenix Dharmic Form.

Marquis Dingxiang's comprehension of the Dharmic Form was still at a rudimentary stage.

However, it was remarkable that this demon, without cultivating the “Celestial Demon Body Refining Art," had managed to comprehend the Dharmic Form at the Nascent Soul stage.  Xiahou was no match for him in this regard.

‘Swoosh!’

The materialized Dharmic Form immediately transformed into white light and merged into Marquis Dingxiang’s body.

It was evident that, like Qin Sang, he had only grasped the basics of utilizing the Dharmic Form, merging it with his physical body.

In the next instant, Marquis Dingxiang’s aura dramatically changed.  His eyes were veiled by a layer of white mist, obscuring his pupils. His gaze was utterly still as he coldly regarded Qin Sang.

The oppressive aura enveloped the battlefield, causing Qin Sang to momentarily falter, his own aura subtly weakened.

This was the suppression of Heavenly Might!

Having comprehended the Dharmic Form, Marquis Dingxiang held a distinct advantage over most opponents, leaving them hampered and restricted.

A cruel smile appeared on Marquis Dingxiang’s lips, but it quickly froze, replaced by an expression of disbelief.

He saw a flash of azure light around Qin Sang, who quickly returned to normal.  Then, an aura erupted from Qin Sang, an aura Marquis Dingxiang was familiar with—the aura of a Dharmic Form.

He had known that Qin Sang also possessed a Dharmic Form, but King Lingyou's words had proven prophetic. Not only was Qin Sang's Dharmic Form stronger than his Baku Demon Dharmic Form, the disparity was even greater than he had imagined!

‘Rumble…’

A muffled rumbling sound echoed continuously.

The void itself trembled, and the surrounding waves of light seemed to stagnate.

‘Swish!’

Phoenix wings unfurled, each feather extending fully, radiating a dazzling azure light.  Arcs of lightning danced between the feathers, imbued with a profound mystical grace.

Qin Sang’s hair and beard whipped wildly as he was enveloped in azure light, resembling a true Azure Phoenix divine beast.  His azure eyes, equally devoid of emotion, fixed upon Marquis Dingxiang.

Marquis Dingxiang’s face paled completely.  The sense of control he had felt from his Baku Demon Dharmic Form vanished.  The surrounding space seemed to have been usurped by his opponent, leaving him suppressed.

Although their gazes met on equal footing, Marquis Dingxiang felt as though he was being looked down upon.

His opponent hadn’t spoken a word, yet a sense of insignificance took root within him.  Those with weaker wills would already have their spirits shaken, their fighting spirit extinguished.

A crumbling will was a prelude to defeat!

Marquis Dingxiang couldn't hide his shock. After King Lingyou had severed his cultivation, the might of his Dharmic Form had been no greater than this.

In all his years of cultivation, he had never encountered a Demon Marquis who had comprehended the Dharmic Form to such an extent!

Facing this formidable opponent, Qin Sang unleashed the full power of his Azure Phoenix Dharmic Form without reservation.

Beneath the intense azure light, the pure light of the Lapis Lazuli Radiance also emanated from his body.

‘Whoosh!’

Marquis Dingxiang only saw a blur of azure before a gigantic azure divine bird rapidly expanded before his eyes.

The suppression of Heavenly Might became even more pronounced.

Marquis Dingxiang felt incredibly uneasy.  He had almost forgotten this sensation.  The suppression of Heavenly Might meant that he would be restricted in every aspect, giving his opponent a complete advantage.

Faced with imminent danger, Marquis Dingxiang abruptly threw a punch, leaving trails of white smoke in its wake.

A sharp roar emanated from the smoke, and a white Baku Demon materialized on Marquis Dingxiang’s fist.

This Baku Demon resembled the Dharmic Form, only smaller, condensed from the Baku Demon's vital essence and blood.

The fist, transformed into a Baku Demon with blood-red eyes and a ferocious expression, lunged towards its foe with a savage roar.

Qin Sang's eyes flashed. Unfazed, he struck out with a palm, seemingly slow but incredibly fast, striking the Baku Demon squarely between the eyes.

‘Bang!’

Buddha’s light erupted from the point of impact.

The Baku Demon’s body stiffened, its advance halted by a single palm strike.

Qin Sang grunted and pressed forward with his palm, the Lapis Lazuli Radiance within intensifying. The power of the Buddhist Seal enveloped the Baku Demon.

In an instant, the Baku Demon’s body crumbled and dissipated into nothingness.

Witnessing this, Marquis Dingxiang was even more astonished.  If he had previously believed that holding his own against Qin Sang wouldn't be difficult, now his thoughts turned to preserving his treasures and his life.

He didn't dare hesitate.  With a flick of his trunk, he spewed forth two more streams of white gas.

Unlike before, these two streams intertwined and transformed into two white gas flying knives, one on either side, slashing towards Qin Sang's face.

While Qin Sang defended against the flying knives, Marquis Dingxiang's figure flickered, and a series of cracking sounds emanated from his body.

First, his trunk rapidly elongated, his face protruded, his body swelled, and his hands and feet transformed into hooves. He revealed his true demonic form!

A Baku Demon, identical to his Dharmic Form, appeared before Qin Sang.

The Baku Demon’s fur was pure white, and though its eyes were small, they shone with an intense brightness.

After revealing his true form, the Baku Demon’s aura intensified, but it still couldn't withstand Qin Sang's suppression of Heavenly Might.

‘Bang! Bang!’

The two white gas flying knives were deflected by Qin Sang.

Amidst the crackling of thunder, Qin Sang lunged straight at Marquis Dingxiang, only to witness an unexpected scene.

“Moo!”

Marquis Dingxiang let out a bellow, seemingly oblivious to Qin Sang. He then proceeded to lie down in the void.

He tucked his hooves beneath him, curled his body into a ball, his head and tail touching, and closed his eyes, assuming a peaceful sleeping posture.

In a matter of moments, Marquis Dingxiang’s breathing evened out, as if he had truly fallen into a deep slumber on the battlefield.

This scene stunned Qin Sang. He couldn't understand what Marquis Dingxiang was up to. It couldn't be that he had given up the fight.

“Could it be…”

Qin Sang suddenly recalled a type of Baku Demon mentioned in legends—the Dream Baku!

Baku Demons were rare, and Dream Bakus were even rarer.  It was said that this type of demonic beast specialized in a rare form of Dream Dao magic, hence its name.

Could Marquis Dingxiang, sleeping soundly on the battlefield, be about to unleash his Dream Dao magic?

This type of magic was truly bizarre.

Qin Sang shook his head inwardly.  The vast world was full of wonders.

He wondered what kind of Dream Dao magic it was. If it involved dragging someone into a dream, its fundamental principle likely involved manipulating the mind.

Qin Sang believed that, protected by the Jade Buddha, he shouldn't be affected.

However, having never encountered Dream Dao magic before, Qin Sang didn't dare to lower his guard.

As he pondered, Qin Sang showed no signs of retreating.  Blood light surged in his palm as his Palm-Heart Sword left his hand, transforming into a streak of blood-red light and shooting towards Marquis Dingxiang.

He would see if Marquis Dingxiang could continue sleeping after being struck by the Palm-Heart Sword.

The instant the spirit sword left his hand, Qin Sang suddenly realized that the surrounding scenery had changed.

At some point, the surrounding area had become enveloped in white smoke, creating a hazy, dreamlike atmosphere.

Qin Sang quickly glanced around, his gaze fixed on Marquis Dingxiang, only to discover that the marquis had vanished.  In his place was a mountain.

His Qi sense indicated that Marquis Dingxiang's true body was within the mountain's belly.

But the scene before his eyes was completely different.

Halfway up the mountain was a cave.  Inside the cave, a young, white Baku Demon peeked its head out cautiously, its eyes filled with curiosity.

In the blink of an eye, the Baku Demon grew larger, dragging other wild beasts back into its cave and devouring them.

Later, the Baku Demon learned to absorb the essence of moonlight and embarked on the path of cultivation.

…

Until it cultivated into a human form, donned a jeweled crown, achieved the status of Demon Marquis, and earned the favor of the Demon King, becoming his trusted right hand.

Scene after scene flashed before Qin Sang's eyes, like a whirlwind tour, each representing a significant moment in the Baku Demon's growth.

The scenes flashed by rapidly, leaving behind an image of the Baku Demon at each stage, standing upon the mountain.

In an instant, seven Baku Demons emerged from the mountain, all staring intently at Qin Sang.

These Baku Demons, young and old, in demonic and human forms, were essentially one, their Qi connected, inseparable.

“So this is the Dream Dao…”

Qin Sang understood.

These dream phantoms, projected from the dream into reality, were similar to avatars or clones.

Even if the phantoms were destroyed, the true body would remain unharmed. It was an effective method of stalling for time.

The question was, how powerful were they?

Just as Qin Sang had suspected, Marquis Dingxiang, cultivating the Dream Dao, had also researched Dream Induction techniques, aiming to drag enemies into dreams and silently eliminate them.

Later, he discovered that this path was exceedingly difficult. After much study, he found it only effective against opponents weaker than himself or those with unstable minds. He then decided to abandon it and instead cultivated the Dream Manifestation technique.

It was fortunate that he hadn't attempted Dream Induction on Qin Sang, or he might have encountered his nemesis.
