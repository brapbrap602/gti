<h1>Chapter 1604 Impossible!</h1><p>A Jade Pendant!</p><p>“Are you the Ghost Mother?”</p><p>Qin Sang froze, the power of the Demon Fire Dragon plummeting.</p><p>This jade pendant was given to him by Tan Hao.</p><p>The Ghost Mother had given it to Tan Hao as a warning token, imbued with a sliver of her divine sense. It would react in her presence.</p><p>He had worn it constantly, both in his true form and his transformations.</p><p>Having arrived in Central State nearly two hundred years ago, there had been no sign of the Ghost Mother.</p><p>Even Su Zinan's reactivation of the Wuwang Palace, which shook the entire cultivation world, failed to draw her out.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't help but wonder if the Ghost Mother had encountered a beast in the Storm Belt and met with an accident.  Or perhaps she had found a way to the Canglang Sea and left Central State.</p><p>Fortunately, he hadn't given up.</p><p>At the Ullambana Assembly, with cultivators from across the land gathered, the Ghost Mother finally appeared.</p><p>Besides her, no one else could possibly recognize the pendant!</p><p>Then, the pursuers arrived belatedly.</p><p>“Elder Qin, be careful! We're here to help!”</p><p>Jiang You shouted, having joined forces with the Jin Yu Sect's cultivators. Several streaks of light tore through the air, gradually forming a siege, aiming to encircle the Ghost Mother.</p><p>The white figure didn't deny it, nodding slightly to Qin Sang before fleeing, flashing through the darkness and vanishing into the depths of the mountains in a few quick bursts.</p><p>Qin Sang quickly urged his Phoenix Wings to follow, channeling his true energy, and transmitted a message to those behind him:  “Sect Leader Jiang, this is a misunderstanding! I will give you an explanation!”</p><p>‘Swish! Swish! Swish!’</p><p>Jiang You and the others descended from the sky, looking at the chaotic battlefield, exchanging bewildered glances.</p><p>“Both of you are Grand Cultivators?”</p><p>A Jin Yu Sect elder, after examining the scene, looked grave.</p><p>Jiang You hesitated before nodding slightly.</p><p>…</p><p>The Ghost Mother and Qin Sang flew through the mountains, one behind the other.</p><p>After shaking off their pursuers, the Ghost Mother stopped on a rock; Qin Sang landed nearby.</p><p>“Senior, you sensed the pendant earlier today?”</p><p>While framed as a question, Qin Sang was almost certain that the observing gaze earlier belonged to the Ghost Mother.</p><p>The seven-note gong earlier must have been a deliberate act by the Ghost Mother, her goal not being treasure theft, but to lure him out. The Ghost Mother, daring enough to infiltrate the Xuan Tian Palace treasury, surely wouldn't be stopped by a three-sided gong?</p><p>The Ghost Mother said calmly, “Back then, Grand Cultivators in the North Sea were few. I wouldn't know where you sprang from without testing you. If you were a descendant of Xuan Tian Palace, you'd likely be engaged in murder and plunder!  Tan Hao, after all, saved my life, so I must have a reckoning with you!”</p><p>Qin Sang remembered Tan Hao, not a cruel or ungrateful man.</p><p>Relaxing his focus on the Fire Lotus, Qin Sang said, “Senior, you now know my identity?”</p><p>“Nine Nether Demon Fire!”</p><p>The Ghost Mother glanced at Qin Sang's sleeve. “I recall Tan Hao mentioning that the ancestor of the demonic sect he joined was famous for the Nine Nether Demon Fire. However, that sect was destroyed long ago.  Since Tan Hao was able to reveal the secret of the pendant to you, are you the benefactor who gave him the Heavenly Corpse Talisman?”</p><p>“Senior's insight is unparalleled; I admire you!”</p><p>Qin Sang bowed. “I am Qin Sang. I greet you, Senior!”</p><p>He sighed, “Decades after Senior's departure, I obtained the sea chart in the Xuan Tian Palace's sacred grounds and pursued it to Central State.  To think it took nearly two hundred years to finally meet you.”</p><p>“Two hundred years?” The Ghost Mother's brow furrowed slightly, as if recalling something. “Black spiritual fire… did you go to the Western Desert Sea?”</p><p>Qin Sang was stunned, immediately realizing the implication in the Ghost Mother's words. He exclaimed in surprise, “Could the Moonlight Bodhisattva be…?”</p><p>Suddenly, a mysterious individual proficient in Buddhist scriptures appeared in the world, silencing countless Buddhist masters with their arguments, leaving the Central State Buddhist sect humiliated.</p><p>Only an ancient cultivator like the Ghost Mother could achieve such a feat, right?</p><p>The ancient cultivation world must have been vibrant and full of extraordinary people, unlike the nearly apocalyptic ruins of today's world.  The knowledge and experiences of ancient cultivators were unimaginable to modern cultivators; the Ghost Mother's broad knowledge was undeniable, even if she hadn't studied Buddhist scriptures.</p><p>As the saying goes, all paths lead to the same truth. The Ghost Mother could easily use her words, fitting them into Buddhist scriptures, to awe contemporary Buddhist cultivators.</p><p>The Ghost Mother snorted, “I wonder who dared to use this palace! My transformation into the Moonlight Bodhisattva had a twofold purpose: to gather ancient Buddhist texts and to attract Buddhist Metamorphosis cultivators from the west, in order to obtain something from the Ganlu Zen Temple.  You almost ruined my plan!”</p><p>Qin Sang sighed repeatedly.</p><p>He had had two chances to meet the Ghost Mother.</p><p>She had once set up an altar on Ji Jia Mountain, and Liuli had even personally attended the ceremony.</p><p>Qin Sang had been delayed in the Sky Rift Valley, missing the Ghost Mother.</p><p>In the Great Sea, they had used the Moonlight Bodhisattva to plot against the Buddha Bone Relic, missing each other again.</p><p>Fate is a cruel mistress!</p><p>“A predecessor infiltrated the Ganlu Temple?” Qin Sang reflected on past events, piecing together the facts. He hadn't been wrong; only the Ghost Mother could move freely in and out of Xiaofangcun Mountain.</p><p>“It was I,”</p><p>The Ghost Mother nodded. “Unable to lure out the Holy One Huiguang, I attempted to approach the Ganlu Temple. Finding that the Nascent Soul cultivator wasn't in the mountains, I infiltrated the temple and obtained a way to travel to the Western Lands, leaving the Central Plains. I only recently returned; naturally, you couldn't find me.”</p><p>Qin Sang’s inquiries about the Canglang Sea in the Central Plains yielded nothing.</p><p>The most frequently discussed foreign land in the Central Plains was the Western Lands.</p><p>He had heard of the Western Lands; rumors suggested a close connection between Buddhism and the Western Lands, a connection now confirmed by the Ghost Mother.</p><p>Beyond the Western Desert, within the storm belt, the land is torn apart, with magma everywhere. The environment is harsher than the sea.  For those below Nascent Soul to cross the continent is extremely dangerous; even with a map, it’s nearly impossible.  While the Ghost Mother is powerful, she should not yet have broken through to the Nascent Soul stage.</p><p>This shows that the Ganlu Temple is more than just the foremost Buddhist sect in the Central Plains; it has close ties to the Western Lands.</p><p>Furthermore,</p><p>the disappearance of the Nascent Soul cultivator is confirmed.</p><p>Qin Sang knew the Ghost Mother had gone to the Western Lands to search for the Witch Clan.  “Tan Hao said that you faced countless hardships searching for your kin. Did you find them in the Western Lands?”</p><p>The Ghost Mother remained noncommittal, countering with a question, “You traveled thousands of miles to the Central Plains. What is it you want?”</p><p>Qin Sang’s expression turned serious. Bowing deeply, he said solemnly, “I wish to implore you to save someone! I will repay your kindness a hundredfold!”</p><p>The Ghost Mother had already guessed, showing no surprise.  She chuckled, “No wonder you and Tan Hao became friends!  Who is it? Someone else whose life is sustained by a Corpse Talisman, and the seal cannot be broken?”</p><p>“Yes,”</p><p>Qin Sang sighed. “She is a friend, who first saved my life and later suffered because of me.  As her soul was about to dissipate, I was forced to use a Corpse Talisman to stabilize her spirit, putting her into a deep sleep.  Unfortunately, even now, having reached late Yuan Ying stage, I am still powerless…”</p><p>Learning that it was a female cultivator, the Ghost Mother looked intently at Qin Sang. “What friend? Your beloved, perhaps?  It’s rare to find a romantic among powerful cultivators!”</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head and chuckled wryly.</p><p>Stopping her teasing, the Ghost Mother explained, “The Corpse Talisman is a simplified version of a higher-level enslavement talisman, a creation of mine combining corpse arts and divine script techniques.  Although its rank isn't high, its complexity is beyond the imagination of ordinary people.  Unless you are proficient in enslavement techniques and divine script, it won’t be easy to break.”</p><p>Qin Sang said, ‘No wonder,’ “I’ve spent five hundred years exploring various methods, all to no avail. I hadn’t found the right approach.”</p><p>“What did you say? How long has she been asleep?” The Ghost Mother was startled. “To prevent the Tian Shi Sect from outwardly complying while secretly disobeying, betraying me, I initially only gave them incomplete Corpse Talismans. The ones you used on Tan Hao were the same; they can only enslave spirits below the Golden Core stage… What was her cultivation level before she fell asleep?”</p><p>“Qi Refinement stage. I can feel her soul becoming increasingly stable, but I cannot communicate with her,” Qin Sang said.</p><p>If Ya Gu hadn't been by his side, he wouldn't have believed it himself.</p><p>Ya Gu's existence defied the laws of heaven, breaking the shackles of lifespan.</p><p>Unless… the perceptions were illusions; Ya Gu's soul was already gone, and what remained within her body wasn't her.</p><p>“Impossible!”</p><p>The Ghost Mother stated emphatically, “Do you think my Corpse Talisman is a divine talisman that can defy fate and change life?  Soon after the Corpse Talisman is implanted, corpse poison will attack the heart, and consciousness will be extinguished. No matter how well it's protected, it absolutely cannot exceed its original lifespan. I knew it was impossible to save Tan Jie, but to comfort Tan Hao, I tried a few times.  Her stable soul is certainly your delusion.  I think you're love-sick and worn out from worry; be careful not to go into demonic obsession!”</p><p>Having said that, the Ghost Mother didn’t want to talk to Qin Sang anymore and turned to leave.</p><p>Qin Sang quickly stopped her. “Senior, please wait. Whether it's a delusion or not, you can tell at a glance. She is also a member of the Witch Clan, your kin.”</p><p>At the mention of the Witch Clan, the Ghost Mother’s expression changed slightly.  She abruptly stopped, her gaze sharp as a knife, fixing on Qin Sang’s eyes. “There is no Witch Clan in the four regions of the North Sea!”</p><p>Qin Sang calmly replied, “I dare not lie. During the years I was missing, I accidentally ended up in the realm where the Witch Clan resides. If you are interested, I will tell you everything.”</p><p>The Ghost Mother coldly said, “If you dare to deceive me, don’t think I can’t kill you.”</p><p>Qin Sang looked around, flashed to a sheltered cliff face, carved out a cave with his sword, invited the Ghost Mother inside, then took out his corpse puppet bag, summoned Ya Gu, and gently laid her on a stone platform.</p><p>Ya Gu's eyes were closed, her complexion rosy, her breath long and even.  She didn't look like a reanimated corpse, but a girl soundly asleep.</p><p>Gui Mu immediately noticed the wooden tag on Ya Gu's chest.</p><p>"Soul-Nurturing Wood?"</p><p>She looked at Qin Sang with surprise, her icy expression softening slightly.  She walked to the stone platform and looked at Ya Gu.</p><p>The evidence was undeniable; Gui Mu had to believe it.</p><p>"Truly… of our bloodline…"</p><p>Gui Mu couldn't hide her astonishment.  She activated some secret technique, her pupils gleaming brighter and brighter, her gaze seeming to penetrate Ya Gu's body as she carefully examined her.</p><p>Qin Sang took a half-step back, holding her breath, not daring to disturb Gui Mu.</p><p>"Her body… the Shadow Bone Mark!  The bones I discarded in the Abyssal Ruins… you obtained them.  The modifications were cleverly done, even some things I hadn't anticipated… quite ingenious… eh?  What a peculiar energy!" Gui Mu discovered the remnants of the Three Lights Jade Liquid within Ya Gu. After all these years, it was almost completely depleted.</p><p>Bai had altered the bone curse.</p><p>As Ya Gu's condition improved, thanks to the bone curse, and the other herbs Qin Sang found to suppress the corpse qi and protect her body, the Three Lights Jade Liquid was no longer necessary.</p><p>Gui Mu could still sense the faint traces of the Three Lights Jade Liquid, demonstrating her acute perception.</p><p>"You've used some extraordinary things on her! Tan Hao wasn't as lucky. I'm starting to believe you, but remaining conscious for five hundred years is highly unusual…"</p><p>Gui Mu's brow furrowed deeper in puzzlement.</p><p>After a moment, the light in Gui Mu's eyes subsided. She raised her right hand, performing a series of incredibly complex hand seals, and touched Ya Gu's forehead with her index finger.</p><p>Gui Mu immediately detected something amiss, withdrawing her finger.  She said sharply, "She has a life-bound insect. How did it come to recognize her? Did the insect willingly submit to her?"</p><p>Qin Sang nodded. "What's the difference between a willingly submitted insect and otherwise?"</p><p>Gui Mu frowned, then said, "Her life-bound insect is very wary, hiding within her soul. I can't force it out; it would harm her spirit. You must be very familiar with her life-bound insect…"</p><p>Fei Can was sometimes incredibly bold, and other times cowardly.</p><p>Qin Sang used her spiritual sense to probe Ya Gu's spirit sea, calling for Fei Can.</p><p>Unexpectedly, this time Fei Can absolutely refused to come out, trembling in fear within Ya Gu's soul, terrified of Gui Mu.</p><p>Qin Sang was speechless, looking at Gui Mu, unsure of the reason.</p><p>Gui Mu smiled. "It probably sensed my insect's aura."</p><p>It was unclear how powerful Gui Mu's insect was; she hadn't used any spirit insects during their previous encounter.</p><p>After patiently soothing it for a while, Qin Sang finally summoned Fei Can.</p><p>Fei Can crawled onto Qin Sang's palm, immediately spewing a poisonous mist to envelop itself.</p><p>As soon as Fei Can appeared, Gui Mu's expression changed drastically, her eyes fixed on Fei Can, her surprise growing.</p><p>Having awakened in a ruined world, few things surprised Gui Mu anymore. Yet, she'd encountered several surprising things related to Qin Sang today.</p><p>Qin Sang noticed Gui Mu's unusual expression and looked at Fei Can in astonishment.</p><p>Could this creature be of significant origin?</p><p>"A descendant of the Divine Silkworm!"</p><p>Gui Mu blurted out, incredulous.</p><p>Qin Sang was momentarily stunned, recalling a legend she'd heard among the Wu tribe.</p><p>The ancient Divine Silkworm, nine transformations to become a celestial being.</p><p>The Divine Silkworm was revered as the Wu tribe's sacred insect, the Wu God's insect—the only spirit insect in Wu tribe legends to achieve celestial status!</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't believe that this creature, with its despicable nature and mastery of only poisonous arts, was a descendant of the Divine Silkworm.</p><p>"No! It's not!"</p><p>Gui Mu abruptly rejected her own judgment. Ignoring Fei Can's reaction, she used a secret technique to sense it, then breathed a sigh of relief.  "It's not a descendant of the Divine Silkworm, but it possesses Divine Silkworm bloodline, albeit very diluted. It's her good fortune!"</p><p>Gui Mu looked at Ya Gu, a hint of envy in her eyes.</p><p>"The Divine Silkworm is proud; even a trace of its bloodline! Except under exceptional circumstances, it wouldn't willingly submit. How did she manage it?"</p><p>Qin Sang felt slightly embarrassed. "I scared it. Does that count as exceptional?"</p><p>Fei Can had nothing remotely proud about it; gluttonous, cowardly, and a bully…</p><p>Years ago, Qin Sang had intimidated Fei Can into submitting to Ya Gu, Fei Can smugly unaware it had completely fallen into his hands.</p><p>Gui Mu was speechless.</p><p>"Ya Gu being alive until now is due to it?" Qin Sang examined Fei Can.</p><p>"It all contributed; the Soul-Nurturing Wood and that strange energy played significant roles," Gui Mu acknowledged Qin Sang's efforts, then added, "After willingly submitting, the spirit insect and its master become one. And the Divine Silkworm bloodline undoubtedly possesses special abilities…"</p><p>Saying this, Gui Mu grabbed Fei Can, forcing it to display its abilities.</p><p>Fei Can only sputtered poison beads and purifying auras, until it was so exhausted its tongue hung out.</p><p>Gui Mu was stunned, glaring at Qin Sang.</p><p>"Who raised the Divine Silkworm like this!"</p><p>—</p><p>—</p><p>Thank you to the generous patron Qi Zhi You Zou for the盟主 donation, I just saw it now, having missed checking my messages for the past two days.</p>
