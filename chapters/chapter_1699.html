<h1>Chapter 1690: United Hearts</h1><p>The avatar, carrying its master, escaped Di Shou Mountain and just entered the sword array when a sudden feeling of impending doom washed over them.  Looking up, they saw a surging wave of demonic energy in the distance—the demons had arrived!</p><p>Leading the charge was a white figure, its appearance horrifying: humanoid but with slender limbs and delicate fingers, resembling a mountain goblin or a vengeful ghost.  A swirling, ghostly white smoke enveloped it, amplifying the chilling terror. Its presence seemed to darken the very sunlight.</p><p>This white figure was the true form of Bai Xiao, the Great Saint.  He’d obeyed the Saint King’s orders and revealed his demonic form.  Flanking him were two demon kings skilled in escape techniques, with the rest of their retinue close behind.  One was a fleshless bone bird, a few withered yellow feathers stuck in its skeletal frame; the other, a four-winged blood serpent with scarlet scales.  All were bizarre and grotesque creatures.</p><p>The avatar felt Bai Xiao’s gaze locked onto them.  Bai Xiao, having witnessed Qin Sang and the avatar fleeing into the sword array, would not let them escape so easily.</p><p>Bai Xiao let out a chilling, cruel laugh.  He forcefully whirled his arms, and the white smoke around him, drawn by some force, rapidly converged, forming a slender bone sword before him.</p><p>The four-winged blood serpent and the bone bird, having served Bai Xiao for many years, understood their master's intentions.  The serpent spat out a blood bead, while the bird vibrated its wings, shooting out three demonic feathers.</p><p>“Swish! Swish! Swish!”</p><p>Three attacks shot out, three streaks of light—white, yellow, and red—appearing above the sword peak, swift as thunder.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>A brilliant green light erupted into the sky above the sword peak.  The array, which Qin Sang had just breached, was thrown into violent turmoil. The blood bead and demonic feathers struck the array before the bone sword, blood-red and murky yellow light exploding alongside the green, causing the earth to tremble.</p><p>The bone sword followed, its timing impeccable, striking a weak point.  Trailing a long plume of white smoke, it pierced down like a comet.</p><p>The avatar felt a searing pain throughout its body, as if locked in the sights of a true blade.  Its expression tightened, and it swept its arm back, releasing a wave of icy white energy that spread behind it like a river.</p><p>“Pfft!”</p><p>The bone sword pierced the river of icy energy.</p><p>There was no discernible impact.</p><p>The next moment, a flicker of surprise crossed Bai Xiao’s face.  The bone sword had inexplicably vanished, and he hadn’t felt any impact.  The strangeness of it filled him with both shock and rage.</p><p>Unbeknownst to others, at the moment the Ice Soul Divine Light was unleashed, the Tianmu butterfly perched on the avatar's shoulder spread its wings, releasing a Tianmu divine ray.  The bone sword, being a manifestation of magical power, dissolved upon contact with the divine ray.</p><p>At this point, Qin Sang was desperate to find a place to heal, not wanting to engage with Bai Xiao. The Ice Soul Divine Light not only concealed the Tianmu divine ray but also provided cover for his escape.</p><p>Using the icy energy as cover, the avatar scanned its surroundings and plunged underground.  Its figure flashed, rapidly weaving between the sword peaks.</p><p>“Whoosh!”</p><p>An unnamed sword peak.</p><p>The avatar, carrying its master, crashed into a valley.</p><p>A fierce wind swept through, bending and breaking plants, leaving a scene of utter devastation.</p><p>A clear stream flowed through the valley, beside which stood a humble wooden hut—likely the dwelling of a sword cultivator, now undoubtedly deserted.</p><p>The avatar hastily laid down its master, whose injuries continued to worsen, the effects of two consecutive Boiling Snow Pills becoming apparent.  Normally, a Grand Cultivator would need to heal immediately after taking a single Boiling Snow Pill, as the damage to their meridians and energy sea is only one aspect.  The infusion of immense Yuan Qi not naturally theirs, without any buffer, shocks their very foundation; any hesitation risks destabilizing it.</p><p>The master was only able to maintain their physical form and foundation thanks to their robust physique and exceptionally powerful divine sense, far surpassing those of their rank.</p><p>The Yuan Qi within the master’s body hadn’t been depleted, and the pill’s effects hadn’t fully manifested, resulting in some residual effects from the two pills.</p><p>But this Yuan Qi was worse than useless. The master was unable to control it, focusing all their energy on preventing their injuries from worsening, leaving no room for anything else.</p><p>To make matters worse, the poison within their body stirred, seizing the opportunity to invade. While the antidotal glow from the poison pill offered some resistance, it required Qin Sang’s ability to suppress it.</p><p>The master’s face was deathly pale, their brows furrowed, their breath weak and erratic.</p><p>The Tianmu butterfly took flight from Qin Sang's avatar, its wings a blur.  Only through its unique ability could the complex layout of the Jinxiang Temple formation be quickly deciphered.  Landing softly on Qin Sang's shoulder, its delicate wings brushed against her cheek, seemingly sensing her pain; the butterfly’s wings trembled, a pale blue mist emanating from the Tianmu patterns.</p><p>The avatar flashed behind Qin Sang, placing a hand on her back.  Being one entity, Qin Sang readily allowed the avatar's energy to flow into her body, helping to restore her vitality.</p><p>With the avatar's assistance, Qin Sang's condition improved slightly. The pain on her face lessened, but her injuries remained severe.  The avatar hurriedly fetched several healing pills and fed them to Qin Sang.</p><p>Suddenly, the earth shook violently.</p><p>Above, shadowy figures appeared in the air.</p><p>Three powerful demons—Bai Xiao and others—hung suspended, their eyes like lightning. Quickly spotting Qin Sang, the four-winged blood serpent let out a piercing shriek.  A flash of crimson light appeared above the sword peak, and its long, bloody tail lashed out.</p><p>With a deafening *boom*, a violent shockwave, even through the protective formation, created a powerful gust of energy that swept across the valley, leaving a trail of destruction.</p><p>Wooden huts collapsed, exposing bare earth.  Qin Sang had vanished.</p><p>Anticipating the danger, Qin Sang had fled the valley, suppressing her aura as she moved erratically.  However, she relied on her understanding of the formation and the Tianmu butterfly's vision, skillfully navigating the chaotic energy flows.</p><p>*Boom!*  *Boom!*  *Boom!*</p><p>Explosions continued to rock the area.</p><p>The demons, unable to easily pursue Qin Sang through the protective formation, bombarded the area, Bai Xiao, the four-winged serpent, and the bone bird taking turns, forcing Qin Sang to keep moving.</p><p>Finally, Qin Sang discerned the nearby formation's shifts and unexpectedly sensed a hidden passage, quickly making her escape.</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>A long-forgotten ray of light pierced the gloom of the underground chamber.</p><p>It seemed the original creator had been careless; the chamber's seals relied on the mountain's protective formation, their energies intertwined. This interconnectedness allowed Qin Sang to enter so easily.</p><p>The chamber was sparsely furnished, seemingly unimportant.</p><p>Seizing this rare moment of respite, the avatar continued to restore Qin Sang's vitality, but their growing anxiety intensified as they realized the extent of her injuries, far worse than anticipated.</p><p>This trip to the Wuxiang Immortal Gate yielded unexpected riches, far exceeding Qin Sang's expectations—provided she lived to enjoy them.  The depletion of her true energy wasn't a major concern; she had high-grade spirit stones to supplement her dwindling supply of Feixue Pills.</p><p>Against the Saint King, the avatar hadn’t had a chance to intervene, using other pills to slowly restore her true energy.  She reserved the high-grade spirit stones for Qin Sang, hoping their absorption would aid her recovery.</p><p>But the problem wasn't a lack of true energy; Qin Sang couldn't move without first stabilizing her internal injuries.  Even if the avatar used the Sun God Tree to drive back the demon Saint, how could they withstand a siege of demon kings? And the demons could simply wear them down, waiting for the Qinghu Saint King’s return.</p><p>Their only option was to use the formation to buy time, hoping to hold out until Qin Sang recovered.</p><p>"Will it come down to sacrificing either the main body or the avatar?" Qin Sang thought bitterly.</p><p>When forced to choose, if possible, she would prioritize saving her main body.</p><p>…</p><p>At the edge of the Jinxiang Temple.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang flee towards them, the old nun felt a growing sense of unease.  She was unsure of the impact of the Three Illusions' demise on the Qinghu Saint King, but she wanted no part in their conflict, especially the risk of incurring the wrath of a powerful demon.  With the sect's top experts present, being caught in the crossfire would have catastrophic consequences for the Yan Yue Monastery.</p><p>Indeed, other cultivators who had intended to explore the Jinxiang Temple were hastily retreating.</p><p>The old nun immediately crushed a jade talisman, ordering a retreat.</p><p>Fortunately, word came from her junior sisters that they had broken most of the inner temple's seals and obtained numerous treasures.</p><p>Warned of the danger, they retreated swiftly.</p><p>After she had escorted her junior sisters to safety, the old nun looked west, but琉璃was gone.</p><p>"Did she see the battle at Di Shou Mountain and take a different route?"</p><p>The thought had barely crossed her mind when a cold voice echoed from the shadows of nearby rocks:  "Abbot."</p><p>琉璃, having arrived unnoticed, emerged from the darkness, suppressing her aura and avoiding conspicuous movement.  Upon seeing Qin Sang and the demon Saint battling, she had retreated to the shadows.</p><p>Qin Sang used a secret technique from Listening Snow Tower to create her clone, and the clone cultivated the Ice Soul Divine Light.  They share a common origin, and their auras are similar.  If not concealed, a demon cultivator of the Divine Transformation stage would detect it, implicating her.</p><p>“It’s good to have you back!”</p><p>The old nun's expression softened.  She said in a low voice, “We can’t stay here long! Although the gains this time are less than expected, it was a rare opportunity.  Go back and cultivate diligently. You will surely make great progress.  Be decisive, and don’t let greed cloud your judgment.”</p><p>These words weren't just for Liuli; they were also a warning to her other sisters who were feeling dissatisfied.</p><p>Once the old monk suppressed the demon and had free hands, he would surely target the remaining disciples of the Wuxiang Immortal Sect.  Lingering this long was already quite risky.</p><p>“Such a pity! If we had a little more time, we could have broken the last sword qi seal of the secret chamber! Based on our previous findings, there’s definitely a highly valuable treasure inside, possibly the *Taiyuan Golden Gang Sword Scripture*!”  a young nun said, full of regret.</p><p>“Sister Ying, you all mapped the protective formation of Jinxiang Hall, right? Give me the map, and I’ll retrieve the treasure from the secret chamber,” Liuli offered, extending her hand.</p><p>Her words surprised everyone.</p><p>The old nun waved her whisk to stop Liuli: “Sister, don’t be reckless…”</p><p>Liuli interrupted her, insisting, “Since joining the temple, I’ve received much care, yet I’ve done nothing in return. The cultivation techniques and spells I practice aren't from the Wuxiang Immortal Sect, and others don't know I've joined Yan Yue Temple. They won't suspect me.”</p><p>Others were tempted, the young nun particularly eager. She’d already taken out a jade slip, her face full of anticipation.</p><p>The old nun said nothing, her gaze fixed on Liuli.</p><p>After a long moment, she looked back towards Jinxiang Hall – not towards the secret chamber – then at the lake hanging in the sky, its surface suddenly churning. She said to a female lay disciple beside her, “This place is fraught with danger. We cannot let Sister Liuli go alone. I’ll stay behind to provide support. Sister, take them ahead.”</p><p>The lay disciple was startled.</p><p>Before she could respond, the old nun had already taken the jade slip from the young nun, leaving no room for argument, urging them to leave.</p><p>“The Legacy Mansion is crowded and full of eyes. Don't go to the teleportation array. Exit the mansion directly through the main passage. Other factions are either occupied with the ancient demon or searching for treasures. They won't have the attention to spare to stop you.  Remember not to linger.”</p><p>Everyone understood that the teleportation array would be saved for the Abbess and Liuli.  The nuns had no objections.</p><p>The young nun, filled with both hope and worry, said, “We found several secret passages in Jinxiang Hall… Abbess, Senior Sister Liuli, please be careful.”</p><p>The old nun, speaking with the authority of the Abbess, gave the lay disciple an order she couldn’t refuse.  Immediately, the lay disciple summoned her sisters, bade farewell to the two, concealed their auras, and flew towards the entrance of the Wuxiang Immortal Sect.</p><p>Watching the nuns depart,</p><p>the old nun turned her attention back and gave the jade slip to Liuli. “Sister, have you considered the dangers involved?”</p><p>“Thank you, Abbess.”</p><p>Liuli accepted the jade slip, knowing the Abbess might have sensed something.</p><p>Joining Yan Yue Temple had been a coincidence, a chance to forge a relationship with the Abbess.  Aside from the rule against leaving without permission, the temple’s rules were lax, and the Abbess could help her understand Buddhist principles—all things she needed.  So, she had accepted the invitation.</p><p>She didn’t have deep feelings for Yan Yue Temple.</p><p>Nor did she hold high expectations of it.</p><p>With a demon Saint King looming above, what right did she have to make the old nun risk the sect's survival?</p><p>Regardless of the Abbess’ intentions, her presence now was a godsend. So, Liuli thanked her sincerely.</p><p>Liuli immersed her mind in the jade slip.</p><p>They had spent some time exploring Jinxiang Hall, and combined with the sect's existing texts, they had a fairly good grasp of the protective formation's layout and flow. Many details were incredibly thorough and exploitable.</p><p>At that moment, Jinxiang Hall was thick with demonic energy.</p><p>Bai Xiao, unable to find Qin Sang, found searching through the protective formation extremely difficult.  He simply led his demonic forces to surround a large area of sword peaks, trapping Qin Sang inside.</p><p>The demons formed an array, each occupying a sword peak, watching vigilantly.</p><p>Four-winged blood snakes and bone birds launched constant attacks, while Bai Xiao refrained from fighting. White smoke constantly emanated from his body, rising to form a white sphere the size of a head above him. It eventually transformed into an eye-like shape.</p><p>The eye hung in the air, rotating freely in any direction, an eerie sight, scanning below to prevent Qin Sang from escaping.</p><p>The next moment, the demons attacked the formation simultaneously.</p><p>The peaks shook, the formation roiling.</p><p>By this time, Liuli and the old nun had infiltrated Jinxiang Hall.  To the old nun's surprise, Liuli moved with clear purpose, quickly approaching the demon array but keeping a safe distance due to the hovering demonic eye.</p><p>Then, Liuli stopped at a certain point and silently unleashed the Ice Soul Divine Light.</p><p>Her Ice Soul Divine Light was inherently silent, and the disturbance caused by the attack on the formation provided cover.  No one noticed as the light infiltrated the formation, targeting Qin Sang's hiding place.</p><p>In the North Sea, she had discovered that due to the side effects of the evil skill, within a certain distance, she could sense Qin Sang through an imprint.  Before, Qin Sang had been in the Emperor's Mandate Mountain, concealed by the Five Elements Divine Prohibition, and her evil skill imprint had not reacted.</p><p>In a hidden chamber.</p><p>Qin Sang's main body's aura was stabilizing, showing signs of improvement.  Just as she was about to plan her escape, she opened her eyes in surprise.</p>
