<h1>Chapter 1177: The Triple Pass</h1><p>Elder Ji nodded. "The Triple Pass is of critical importance. Currently, two fellow Daoists are stationed there, but we are still uneasy. We hope you can go and reinforce them, assisting in the operation of the grand formation. Of course, if Fellow Daoist Mingyue has any difficulties, feel free to bring them up, and we can discuss them."</p><p>"Do you have a rough defensive map of the frontlines? I'd like to take a look at the situation first," Qin Sang requested without directly agreeing or refusing.</p><p>"Of course," Elder Ji readily agreed, taking out a jade slip and handing it to Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang focused his divine sense into the jade slip and examined it carefully. The contents were simple, and the so-called defensive map was rather rudimentary, but it contained all the information Qin Sang needed.</p><p>Currently, the two most critical strongholds on the frontlines were located to the east and west: Wangdong City and Shiqu Mountain. The top experts of the Two Domains Alliance, including Elder Zhenyi, Lord Tongyou, and even Senior Sister Qingjun, were divided into two groups, stationed at these two strongholds and establishing their main camps. Senior Sister Qingjun was currently at Shiqu Mountain.</p><p>Other key passes and cities were also guarded by Nascent Soul cultivators, each under the jurisdiction of these two main camps. Due to the Sin Abyss stretching their battle lines too thin, employing both real and feigned tactics, the Two Domains Alliance had no choice but to adopt this strategy.</p><p>Coincidentally, the Triple Pass fell under the jurisdiction of Shiqu Mountain. There were a few other passes similar to the Triple Pass, their importance second only to the two main camps. The human race had invited demon kings to assist precisely to stabilize these critical locations. As long as these key points held firm, even if other areas fell, they could still withstand the Sin Abyss's offensive and even launch a counterattack.</p><p>In addition, there was the Hukou Pass at the far western edge, the most remote location, situated at the tail of the highlands. It served as the gateway to the Heavenly Demon Highlands and was currently guarded by demon forces. The Sin Abyss had come prepared, having already swept through the desert forces adjacent to the Skywalk Highlands. The Hukou Pass was also under threat from the Sin Abyss. The demon race had no intention of allowing the Sin Abyss to break through from here, and Demon King Yu had been on guard against this possibility.</p><p>After assessing the situation, Qin Sang felt that choosing the Triple Pass was not a bad idea and did not request a change of location.</p><p>Seeing this, Elder Ji was pleased and immediately took out a storage pouch. "This contains Golden Sinking Wood and a sum of spirit stones. Please verify the contents."</p><p>Qin Sang took it and checked. To his surprise, the piece of Golden Sinking Wood was as thick as an arm. Golden Sinking Wood was extracted from the heartwood of a spiritual tree, and even mature spiritual trees rarely yielded pieces thicker than this. The Two Domains Alliance had invested heavily.</p><p>"I won't refuse such generosity," Qin Sang said without hesitation, stashing it away. Previously, in order to exchange for cultivation resources, he had sold off most of the treasures he had brought back from the Canglang Sea, except for the Demon Core Pills and the highest-grade demon cores and bones. Although Nascent Soul Patriarchs were not short on spirit stones, it was always good to have extra in such times.</p><p>"Fellow Daoists have been engaging with the Sin Abyss for so long. You must have a deep understanding of them. Do you have detailed records? It would help me prepare," Qin Sang asked. His knowledge of the Sin Abyss was limited to what he had heard from Senior Sister Qingjun.</p><p>"Of course. Even if you hadn't asked, I would have given it to you. Also, here is a token to verify your identity," Elder Ji said, handing him a jade slip and a token.</p><p>Qin Sang also requested that the old macaque and other demon beasts from the Thousand Bamboo Sea be transferred to the Triple Pass. Elder Ji agreed to all his requests, though the Two Domains Alliance would need to coordinate the deployment, so it would take a few days. As for the disciples of the Blazing Demon Sect, they were currently stationed at Shiqu Mountain, where Senior Sister Qingjun was. Mei Gu had likely already made contact with the Qingyang Demon Sect.</p><p>After discussing a few more matters, both sides reached an agreement. Without delay, Qin Sang stood up and bid farewell to Elder Ji.</p><p>Heading south from this location, the path descended, and the view ahead was unobstructed. In the distance, the peaks grew shorter and shorter. When they reached the second tier, Tan Yien couldn't help but gasp in awe.</p><p>A sheer cliff, ten thousand feet high, smooth as a mirror, with howling winds and snow. Unless one attacked from a few specific passes, attempting to feign an assault from such a cliff would be no easy feat, even for cultivators.</p><p>The Triple Pass was still some distance from Shiqu Mountain. Since Elder Ji was in a hurry, Qin Sang decided to go to the Triple Pass first and then contact Senior Sister Qingjun. After descending the second tier and flying for an unknown distance, they finally arrived at the place he was to guard.</p><p>Along the way, they encountered patrols, but with the token, they passed through without hindrance.</p><p>...</p><p>The Triple Pass.</p><p>Here, several peaks overlapped, creating a strategically vital location, a place of military contention. There was no city here. Instead, the Two Domains Alliance had set up a grand formation, shrouding dozens of miles in thick fog, making it impossible for the Sin Abyss to discern the true situation.</p><p>Inside, there was no trace of the fog. At the center stood a tall tower, surrounded by rows of neatly arranged stone houses. With no immediate battles, the cultivators were resting inside.</p><p>The core of the grand formation was located within this tower.</p><p>Two Nascent Soul Patriarchs were currently chatting inside the tower. One was from the Skywalk Alliance, with the Daoist name Jinglin. The other was from the Taiyi Alchemy Sect, a direct disciple of Elder Chongyi, named Si Di, who had advanced to Nascent Soul a hundred years ago. Both were at the early Nascent Soul stage.</p><p>"Elder Ji sent word earlier. We're getting a reinforcement. I wonder which demon king it will be?" Jinglin said with anticipation.</p><p>Their expressions showed no urgency, indicating that the battle situation was not critical, but having reinforcements was always a good thing.</p><p>"Please don't let it be that black bear!" Si Di snorted, seemingly having had a conflict with the black bear demon. "Otherwise, my Golden Mirror might end up pointing in the wrong direction!"</p><p>Jinglin chuckled. "Would Elder Ji send someone who doesn't get along with us? Even if it is that black bear, it would only be responsible for operating the Frost Bell Formation. You wouldn't have to deal with it directly..."</p><p>Before he could finish, a streak of light flew into the tower. Jinglin caught it. "They're here!"</p><p>The two flew out of the tower, and with a flash of light, they arrived at the edge of the formation. There, they saw two figures standing outside the formation. One wore a mask and exuded pure demonic energy, clearly a demon king.</p><p>"Huh?" The two exchanged glances.</p><p>They were familiar with the demon kings of the Heavenly Demon Highlands, but this one was completely unfamiliar.</p><p>"I am the Moonlight Demon King of the Thousand Bamboo Sea. You must be Fellow Daoists Jinglin and Si Di, correct?" Qin Sang introduced himself, flicking his sleeve to send the token inside.</p><p>After verifying it, they allowed Qin Sang and Tan Yien to enter.</p><p>"No wonder we didn't recognize you, Fellow Daoist Mingyue. You must have just broken through. We heard there was a mysterious Senior Bamboo in the Thousand Bamboo Sea, but we didn't expect another demon king to emerge," Jinglin and Si Di said with surface-level enthusiasm.</p><p>Qin Sang keenly noticed the flicker of disappointment in their eyes but paid it no mind.</p><p>After some pleasantries, the two invited Qin Sang into the tower for further discussion, while Tan Yien was led away by a Golden Core cultivator to settle elsewhere.</p><p>Before Tan Yien left, Qin Sang handed him the token. If Tan Hao's old acquaintances were not at the Triple Pass, Tan Yien would need to search other camps. With Qin Sang's token, he could move freely here.</p><p>******</p>
