<h1>Chapter 1865: The Unchanging Way of Heaven</h1><p>Divine Court, Divine Thunder, Talisman Gods…</p><p>Qin Sang was amazed by the profound depth of the Daoist tradition.</p><p>Although Left Realperson’s words were vague in many places, through these snippets, Qin Sang could still grasp a glimpse of the Daoist style of the ancient times.</p><p>Qin Sang’s first thought was his earlier speculation about this world: Could such a powerful force truly be nurtured in a small thousand world?</p><p>But Left Realperson clearly said ‘this world’.</p><p>After listening to Left Realperson’s explanation of the Divine Court, Qin Sang fell into contemplation, sorting through these astonishing secrets.</p><p>According to Left Realperson, the Gui Fang kingdom’s demonic cultivators created demonic techniques based on Daoist techniques.  Both techniques and demonic techniques were rooted in talismanic arts. The Divine Court and the Talisman Gods were manifestations of the true meaning of talismanic arts, the foundation of a cultivator’s cultivation base.</p><p>In the present age, the Six Heavenly Ancestral Qi is rampant, yet the Divine Court is missing. The connection between techniques and the Divine Court/Talisman Gods has weakened, leading to shaky cultivation bases for practitioners.  At the Great Realperson and Demon King realms, relying solely on techniques is insufficient.</p><p>The Divine Court’s power is transmitted through various regional altars and the Imperial Seal.</p><p>This leads to two consequences.</p><p>First, before a cultivator breaks through to the Five Talisman rank, they must first visit a True Monarch to receive the empowerment of the Imperial Seal's power, gaining stronger protection—essentially having their name inscribed on the Imperial Seal. The Daoist court calls this "Ascension to Truth."</p><p>Only after Ascension to Truth can one enter the Five Talisman rank and achieve Great Realperson status.</p><p>Therefore, the number of Great Realpersons in the Daoist sect is fixed, determined by the level of refinement of the Imperial Seal.  Not everyone who wants to break through can do so.</p><p>The size of a region can be used as a judgment: The territory of a region is the boundary of the Imperial Seal's power.  The broader the territory, the closer the Imperial Seal is to its full potential.</p><p>Second, Great Realpersons must cultivate within the range of the Imperial Seal's power. Cultivating far from the altars will impact their cultivation base.  The celestial phenomena triggered by a Great Realperson traveling are not auspicious, and the further from the altars, the more violent the phenomena.</p><p>By this point, Qin Sang had guessed Left Realperson’s intentions.</p><p>Left Realperson explained all this, willingly revealing the secrets of this world to an outsider, likely hoping to enlist Qin Sang’s help in the Daoist sect’s struggle to reclaim the Divine Court.</p><p>Qin Sang’s performance in the duel with the Ling You King was clearly noticed by Left Realperson. At his full strength, Qin Sang could at least hold off a Demon King.</p><p>Furthermore, with sufficient wood spirit energy, Qin Sang dared to charge recklessly, making him a hard-to-find, brave general.</p><p>It was no surprise that Left Realperson was trying to recruit him.</p><p>“Are my contributions insufficient to qualify for Ascension to Truth?” Qin Sang asked, frowning.</p><p>“Slaying a Demon King is certainly enough, but you are not of our Daoist sect…And whether or not you can ascend to Truth depends on first receiving a summons from a True Monarch,” Left Realperson paused, then spoke frankly, “If you can help the Daoist sect regain the Divine Court, your merit will be unparalleled, and Ascension to Truth will be a mere formality.”</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze pierced through the golden-armored generals, looking at Left Realperson, who sat with closed eyes, and hesitated, “I believe my abilities are not hidden from your eyes, senior. I rely on a certain Daoist technique, which requires specific conditions. Otherwise…”</p><p>A golden-armored general chuckled and interrupted Qin Sang, “Among our many colleagues, there are numerous Realpersons skilled in Five Element talismanic techniques, and our army also has wood element spirits. Creating a wood spirit domain for you is easily accomplished, providing you with abundant wood spirit energy!”</p><p>Qin Sang uttered a sound of surprise. He was accustomed to fighting alone, ignoring the difference between large-scale battles and ordinary duels.</p><p>Daoist talismanic techniques were best suited for large-scale battles, and with the army's cooperation, Left Realperson's words were not false.</p><p>It seemed that Left Realperson was determined to recruit him.</p><p>Qin Sang fell silent again, pondering Left Realperson’s words. Based on his own experience, the so-called Six Heavenly Ancestral Qi mainly affected true energy and primordial spirit.</p><p>He didn't cultivate talismanic arts, only using techniques to stabilize his true energy. His cultivation base and the Divine Court were not connected.  After breaking through to the Void Refinement stage, would the impact on his cultivation base still be that great?</p><p>Techniques could naturally communicate with the Divine Court, drawing its protection. And at the Void Refinement stage, control over true energy and heavenly energy far exceeded that of the Divine Transformation stage.  As long as he didn't stray far from Daoist territory, perhaps he wouldn't need "Ascension to Truth" to cultivate normally.</p><p>Left Realperson also mentioned that the threat of restless gods was greater than the disorder of true energy, and Qin Sang had the Jade Buddha, so he didn’t need to worry.</p><p>If Qin Sang’s deduction proved true, he might not need to seek the Daoist court, and he wouldn’t have to risk being drawn into the vortex of conflict between the two major powers.</p><p>In the presence of a Great Realperson, Qin Sang felt an invisible pressure, making him cautious and careful.</p><p>Facing a True Monarch directly would likely result in being seen through at a glance, with nowhere to hide.</p><p>Of course, all this was predicated on him breaking through to the Void Refinement stage in this world. If he could find a path to ascension beforehand, he wouldn’t need to worry.</p><p>Left Master seemed to understand Qin Sang's thoughts and cautioned, "Friend Daoist, don't assume that those outside our Daoist sect, lacking proper cultivation, are exempt. For many years,  outstanding individuals within the Mount Ju sect have eventually sought the Daoist Court…"</p><p>Left Master paused, seemingly hesitant, as if what he was about to say was of great importance.</p><p>Finally, he made up his mind.  "The so-called 'Six Celestial Ancient Qi' refers to the Heavenly Dao. The explanations regarding True Essence and Primordial Spirit are meant to enlighten later generations while preventing the truth of this world from shaking their Daoist hearts. It's a commonly accepted, relatively reasonable explanation... Friend Daoist, please swear an oath."</p><p>The armored general remained silent, his gaze fixed intensely on Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang's heart skipped a beat.  Understanding that he was about to learn a true secret, he immediately swore by his heart demon to never reveal what he was about to hear.</p><p>With the oath sworn, Left Master hesitated no longer. "Having reached the Xuan level of cultivation, Friend Daoist should understand the importance of 'Dao'.  Cultivation, the pursuit of Dao, is no empty phrase. As the saying goes, 'Heaven and Earth are filled with vital energy, all things transform and mature.'  When the Heavenly Dao is in order, it manifests all things. But when the Heavenly Dao is disordered, what then?"</p><p>Qin Sang’s face showed sudden shock. He stared towards the exit of the altar, his voice grave, "Like those ferocious beasts?"</p><p>"Precisely like those ferocious beasts! With the Heavenly Dao in disarray, how can we, the cultivators, pursue the Dao?" The armored general nodded emphatically, posing the question back.</p><p>"The Divine Court can pacify the Six Celestial Ancient Qi and stabilize the eight directions. It establishes and upholds the Heavenly Dao, the Great Dao!"</p><p>"Our master, in his teachings, once said: Without accumulating merit and deeds, one cannot reach the profound realms. Without alleviating suffering, Daoist fruits are hard to achieve! The Divine Court, initially called Thunder City, revered the Thunder Method…"</p><p>The armored general's voice rose suddenly.</p><p>"What is the Thunder Method? It's to wield thunder in one's hands, summon wind and rain at will, act as Heaven's messenger, benefit and save all beings, and make it an eternal treasure for oneself!"</p><p>His words resounded powerfully, deeply impacting Qin Sang.</p><p>Left Master remained seated, the armored general expressionless. Yet, as these words were spoken, Qin Sang sensed an extraordinary radiance and exceptional bearing from them.</p><p>"The Daoist sect created the Divine Court, established this altar, refined the Du Gong seals, and transmitted the Daoist methods. One of its aims was to pacify the Evil Origin, to restore a peaceful world without ghosts or ferocious beasts. Only then could it be called a great transformation. It is said that once a Du Gong seal is perfected, this governed territory will have a stable Heavenly Dao, impervious to the Six Celestial Ancient Qi. Unfortunately…"</p><p>Left Master sighed, falling silent before adding with a hint of hope, "With the Divine Court's return, we, the inheritors of the Daoist lineage, may one day achieve the aspirations of our ancestors."</p><p>Qin Sang felt like scratching his head. Left Master had revealed much, yet concealed even more, and clearly wasn't inclined to offer detailed explanations.</p><p>What kind of immense power did the Divine Court possess to stabilize the Heavenly Dao?</p><p>Such a grand vision and high realm—Qin Sang wouldn't be surprised if the Daoist sect had produced Celestial Masters in the past.</p><p>Why had such a powerful ancient Daoist sect fallen to this state? Why had the Divine Court collapsed?</p><p>Was there a more terrifying enemy within the Evil Origin, leading to the defeat and decline of the Daoist Court?</p><p>Qin Sang recalled the legends of the Evil Origin's demonic creatures. He had entered the Evil Origin many times to hunt demons, carefully following warnings, and hadn't ventured too deep, never having witnessed those strange and unpredictable creatures firsthand.</p><p>‘Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!’</p><p>Despite the absence of wind, the treetops behind Qin Sang violently shook, leaves falling like rain.</p><p>The floating island beneath them, indeed the entire space and the altar itself, trembled.</p><p>A leaf landed on Qin Sang's shoulder, startling him. He glanced beyond the illusion.</p><p>Unlike the previous golden light burst, apart from the tremors, there were no other signs, making it impossible to pinpoint the source.  The tremors seemed to originate from deep within the altar.</p><p>Even Left Master couldn't say for sure if the shaking was caused by a conflict between two sides or the emergence of the Divine Court.</p><p>"We've wasted so much time, I'm afraid we'll be too late now. Also, Master, do you know where the Divine Court is located?"</p><p>Qin Sang didn't directly accept or refuse.</p><p>He had been in the deep valley beneath the blue sea when the South Heavenly Gate appeared and knew nothing about it.</p><p>"We'll do what we can, and leave the rest to fate," Left Master sighed. "Those demons are clearly prepared. Let's hope other Daoist friends haven't fallen too early and can hold them off.  Even a stalemate would be acceptable. If so, a battle will inevitably ensue at the Divine Court. Let's quickly recover our energy; we might still make it."</p><p>Moments later, Qin Sang learned the Divine Court's location from the armored general, and was startled.</p><p>The Divine Court was in the direction of the Vermilion Gold Spiritual Needle!</p><p>"Is this a coincidence, or…"</p><p>Qin Sang had a bad feeling, but knowing too little, he was overwhelmed with confusion.</p><p>He couldn't help but worry. The Divine Court could affect the path to ascension. If the interdimensional passage were destroyed, he would only have one choice—to rely on the Daoist sect.</p><p>Even without Left Master’s invitation, Qin Sang would go and see it.</p><p>Moreover, even though he hadn’t fully believed Left Master's discourse on the Heavenly Dao, he dared not take it lightly.</p><p>Unless he could ascend, staying in this world meant enduring the consequences of a disordered Heavenly Dao, being led astray, how could he pursue the Great Dao?</p><p>Preparation for the unforeseen was essential.</p><p>We'll improvise when the time comes.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang agree,  Zu Zhenren was overjoyed, his tone light as he said,  "Friend Qingfeng, do you still wish to exchange these merits for insights into cultivation?"</p><p>Qin Sang said gravely, "The essentials of cultivation and the path to ascension are both indispensable!"</p><p>One must first have the ability to break through bottlenecks before being eligible for ascension. Qin Sang believed the former to be more important. If Zu Zhenren was exaggerating, he would find out upon breaking through to the Refining Emptiness stage.</p><p>The golden-armored general nodded. "Since that's the case, I also have some insights into the Five Talismans. If you trust me, I can guide you now."</p><p>As the saying goes, the Dao cannot be lightly imparted. Zu Zhenren wouldn't offer guidance for free; Qin Sang would still need to exchange merits, but the teaching could come first, with the compensation discussed later at the Dao Court.</p><p>This was a clever move, seemingly reassuring Qin Sang while not worrying about him being unable to repay.</p><p>Qin Sang's heart stirred.  Zu Zhenren and he were to be allies against a common enemy; Zu Zhenren must have some understanding of him.  Guidance from Zu Zhenren would be perfect.</p><p>Regardless, he should secure the benefit first.</p><p>"Please, senior, enlighten me," Qin Sang said respectfully, bowing deeply and attentively listening.</p><p>Before he finished speaking, Zu Zhenren's eyelids flickered slightly. He abruptly opened his eyes, his gaze radiating light as he looked at Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang felt as if his mind had been struck by a heavy hammer. His expression remained unchanged, but he was inwardly tense.</p><p>Under Zu Zhenren's gaze, Qin Sang felt as if his defenses were stripped bare, laid open.</p><p>Zu Zhenren slowly said, "Regardless of the method you cultivate, if you desire the Dao, you must emulate Heaven and Earth, achieving unity between man and Heaven.  The Five Talismans are key to this.  Over the years, Daoist sages have summarized some crucial points—shortcuts, if you will. Their effectiveness, however, varies from person to person…"</p><p>Qin Sang's expression grew even more respectful as he listened to Zu Zhenren's pronouncements. "If you cultivate through the Five Elements, two are paramount. Choose one to refine and perfect, or possess all five, maintaining balance and avoiding bias."</p><p>With each word Zu Zhenren spoke, he transmitted profound Daoist principles through his divine sense, subtle and indescribable.  </p><p>Thus, even though it was a simple sentence, the subtleties were beyond ordinary comprehension.</p><p>Qin Sang was stunned for a long time, struggling to digest the information. Having experience breaking through to the Transformation God stage, he had previously made some guesses, but they lacked systematization. Zu Zhenren's guidance directly addressed the crucial points.</p><p>Undoubtedly, Qin Sang would take the second path. He possessed five elemental spiritual roots, making him well-equipped, but balancing the Five Elements couldn't be achieved simply by having them.</p><p>How to harmonize the Five Elements couldn't be explained in a few words, nor could it be done overnight.</p><p>For the time being, Qin Sang couldn't fully grasp it. He committed it to memory to contemplate later.</p><p>Before Qin Sang could fully understand these pronouncements, Zu Zhenren carefully examined him again and continued, "You must know that there's a difference between cultivators of the Dao and those who cultivate physical strength."</p><p>Qin Sang quickly recovered and listened carefully.</p><p>Zu Zhenren clearly saw that he cultivated both Dao and physical strength. Qin Sang hadn't expected Zu Zhenren to be so generous and also offer guidance in the path of physical strength.</p><p>Though Qin Sang's foundation wasn't in physical strength, knowing this would still benefit him greatly.</p><p>"Physical strength cultivators, at the Cave Profound stage, will use their innate essence as a foundation to evolve an inner world. I've seen references to inner and outer landscapes in scriptures, corresponding to the Cave Profound and Five Talismans stages…"</p><p>Zu Zhenren paused, seeming to recall and ponder.  "Similarly, it's about emulating Heaven and Earth, pursuing unity between man and Heaven. We manipulate vital energy and control Heaven and Earth, while those focused on physical strength aim for 'I am Heaven and Earth'.  The so-called 'outer landscape' is continuously absorbing the power of Heaven and Earth into the body, expanding the inner world until it reflects outwards, influencing Heaven and Earth itself. The demonic cultivator's Dharma form is a manifestation of 'outer landscape'…"</p><p>Zu Zhenren spoke more about the cultivation of physical strength.</p><p>It seemed more detailed, but actually less refined than before, though sufficient for Qin Sang.</p><p>As the saying goes, a single word of true teaching is worth ten thousand scrolls.</p><p>Perhaps Zu Zhenren was concealing something, but there was no falsehood in what he had said.  With Qin Sang's current cultivation, he could judge for himself.</p><p>His previous doubts were resolved, and Qin Sang felt a sense of clarity, finding a direction for his future cultivation, though it wasn't yet entirely clear.</p><p>"I owe him a huge favor!"</p><p>Besides his surprise, Qin Sang sighed inwardly.</p><p>Zu Zhenren was so forthright; even if he had ulterior motives, Qin Sang had to reciprocate, it wasn't simply a fair exchange.</p><p>At the very least, in this Heavenly Court conflict, he couldn't simply be a bystander. He would act when necessary.</p>
