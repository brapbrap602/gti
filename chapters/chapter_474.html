<h1>Chapter 467: The True Purpose</h1><p>Chapter 467: The True Purpose</p><p>This was clearly a deserted place.  Like the stone pavilion by the pool he'd seen upon entering, it showed the wear of countless years, left to ruin and untouched.  But after noticing the strange anomaly of the restriction fragments, Qin Sang dared not underestimate this place.  Could some peculiar force remaining in the plaza be repelling the fragments?</p><p>Qin Sang glanced sideways. He saw Granny Jing also lift off from his shoulder, looking around. He knew this must be Granny Jing's destination. She had gone to great lengths to get here; there must be some treasure hidden here.</p><p>Qin Sang lowered his head and looked at the center of the plaza. That was the most conspicuous spot, but it was completely buried under a pile of broken pillars. He knew his limits, suppressing his curiosity and any greedy thoughts.  His only wish was to finish his agreement with Granny Jing and leave immediately.</p><p>Thinking this, Qin Sang transmitted his voice, "Senior, are you...?"</p><p>However, before he could finish, a muffled sound interrupted him.  It came from the center of the plaza.  The sound was abrupt. Granny Jing didn't react; it seemed to originate from beneath the rubble in the center.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression changed drastically. His gaze shifted, and he saw the piled-up pillar fragments suddenly heave, as if something was about to break free.  With this movement, the bottom of the fragments suddenly lit up.  Light poured out of the cracks, instantly dispelling the darkness of the entire plaza, illuminating everything brightly.</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang felt a surge of alarm. His first thought was to leave; he didn't want to get involved in this.  With this in mind, Qin Sang immediately decided to turn and leave without waiting for Granny Jing's response.</p><p>Unfortunately, things didn't go as planned.  Just as Qin Sang was about to move, a powerful surge of spiritual energy erupted from deep within the plaza, shattering the pile of pillar fragments.  For a moment, rocks flew, and dust filled the air.</p><p>Amidst the chaos, an unexpected scene unfolded: three figures shot into the air.</p><p>People!</p><p>Qin Sang was astonished. He never expected anyone else to be here.  Deputy Island Master Xiao couldn't have lied to them; the Finger Heaven Peak only contained countless restriction fragments, no living beings, and certainly no people.  These three people suddenly bursting from the rubble were clearly not among the sixty-five who had entered with him.  Could there be another entrance to Finger Heaven Peak?</p><p>Who were they?  Was Granny Jing not here for treasure, but for them?</p><p>As the pillar fragments exploded, a calm voice came from among the three, "We report to the Grand Elder; this is not a celestial mansion, but another hidden realm!"</p><p>A more excited voice followed, "Master Uncle, look at these! They're Star Yuan Stones! The Sect Master's insight is extraordinary; the celestial mansion is indeed related to Finger Heaven Peak!"</p><p>"Wait!"</p><p>"Someone!"</p><p>…</p><p>They appeared too quickly; Qin Sang had no time to hide and was easily spotted.  The three voices abruptly stopped. They clearly hadn't expected to encounter anyone so soon, and six eyes fixed on Qin Sang, who was trying to escape.</p><p>The dust settled. Qin Sang saw their faces.</p><p>Three people: an old man and two young men. The old man was in the middle, with the young men on either side. The old man wore a strange silver robe, adorned with a meticulously detailed star chart. The starlight on the robe shone brilliantly, like a real starry sea, attracting attention.</p><p>The young man on the old man's left, the one who spoke first, wore ordinary clothes, stood with his hands behind his back, and had a calm demeanor and tone, unlike ordinary people. However, he showed deference to the old man. This, along with the young man addressing him as Grand Elder, showed the old man's high status.</p><p>The other young man, with a feather fan and a scholar's cap, was quite handsome and had an extraordinary bearing; he was the most frivolous of the three. He was excitedly pointing at the luminous orb outside the plaza when he suddenly noticed Qin Sang, his smile freezing into a strange expression.</p><p>Their outwardly displayed aura wasn't strong, all at the Foundation Establishment stage, but this didn't necessarily reflect their true cultivation.</p><p>Grand Elder, Master Uncle...  These titles weren't for ordinary people. The old man and the young man in ordinary clothes likely suppressed their cultivation, just like Granny Jing.</p><p>Qin Sang's mind raced. He found no identifying marks on them and couldn't guess their origins.  He quickly looked towards Granny Jing for help, but found that she had vanished.  The surroundings were empty, and Qin Sang's heart sank.</p><p>A young man shouted, pointing at Qin Sang, speaking rapidly, “Grand Elder, I recognize this person!  He’s Wuying Jian from Xiaohua Mountain, quite famous in Yun Cang Marsh. My senior brother sent a message earlier – he was chosen by the Snake Woman and this person was with him when they entered the Zhiti Peak.”</p><p>Qin Sang carefully examined the young man; he was certain he’d never seen him before, and he didn’t know who his senior brother was.</p><p>Hearing this, Qin Sang could only be sure they were from either the Xiao Han Domain or the Tian Xing Alliance, not outsiders.</p><p>Qin Sang managed a strained smile, but before he could speak, the elder’s eyes flashed, revealing a glint of killing intent. He coldly uttered two words.</p><p>“Kill him!”</p><p>Qin Sang’s eyes narrowed.  From the moment he was discovered, he knew there would be no peaceful resolution. He wasn't naive enough to think that being caught would earn him leniency.</p><p>He had hoped that if they were fellow cultivators from Xiao Han Domain, he might buy some time with words.</p><p>Instead, they were even more ruthless, resorting to immediate violence without a word.</p><p>Before the elder’s words had even finished, the young man eagerly summoned a flying sword, looking down at Qin Sang with disdain. “Uncle-Master, wait! Let me deal with him first. Let’s see what this so-called Wuying Jian is capable of.  He isn't even at the False Core stage, yet his reputation somehow surpasses my senior brother’s.”</p><p>The young man in ordinary clothes frowned, glared at the impetuous youth, and scolded him, “This mission concerns a vital matter for our sect.  There’s no room for your recklessness. Kill him first, then…”</p><p>At that moment, unnoticed by anyone, a figure in flowing white robes appeared silently in the center of the square. Their eyes were cold and distant as they looked at the three, speaking in a chilly voice, “Only the Grand Elder has come? Is Leng Yuntian hiding in the sect like a coward?”</p><p>The three were shocked.</p><p>“Who?!”</p><p>“What?!”</p><p>…</p><p>Leng Yuntian!</p><p>Hearing that name, Qin Sang felt a thunderbolt strike his mind, instantly realizing their true identities.</p><p>Leng Yuntian, the Sect Master of the Yuan Shen Sect!</p><p>Rumor had it he was a Yuan Ying stage cultivator!</p><p>The elder was called Grand Elder by the two young men, leading to only one conclusion: the Yuan Shen Sect’s Grand Elder, a late Gold Core cultivator whose reputation rivaled the Snake Woman’s – Zhangxing Old Man!</p><p>Jing Granny’s target was actually the Yuan Shen Sect’s Sect Master!</p>
