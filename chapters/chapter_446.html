<h1>Chapter 439: Ribbon of Light</h1><p>Vice Island Master Xiao's figure flickered, and he soared away.  At this moment, streaks of light flew over their heads, following Vice Island Master Xiao south. Qin Sang keenly sensed that some people's gazes held a shared sense of misfortune, indicating that many had been forcibly conscripted by Vice Island Master Xiao.</p><p>"Greetings, Senior Brother Mu!"</p><p>Someone flew out of the group on a sword, landing in front of them.</p><p>"Junior Brother Zhan!"</p><p>Mu Yifeng recognized this person and introduced both sides.  It turned out they were fellow disciples.</p><p>"Junior Brother Qin, this is Junior Brother Zhan Yi, a direct disciple of Martial Uncle Che. He is highly valued by Martial Uncle Che and works on Stargazing Island. This is Junior Brother Qin Sang, Junior Brother Xie, and Junior Brother Mao... Junior Brother Zhan, isn't Martial Uncle Che here?"</p><p>Zhan Yi shook his head and said, "Master is in the east. Like Senior Xiao, he's gathering people. This happened suddenly, and the island is short-handed, so we can only conscript disciples from various sects who are traveling."</p><p>Qin Sang sighed inwardly. It seemed there was no escape; no matter which direction he went, he couldn't avoid it.</p><p>Mu Yifeng hesitated. "Junior Brother Qin is under orders from Martial Uncle Qi Yuanshou to watch over the sect's medicinal garden. He has a mission and urgently needs to return to the sect to report.  I wonder if there's any way around this?"</p><p>Zhan Yi looked at Qin Sang apologetically and sighed, "I'm afraid not.  This is a conscription order issued personally by the Island Master, and no one can disobey it. Even if Martial Uncle Qi came personally, he probably wouldn't be able to get away if intercepted. Senior Brother Mu has just returned from the battlefield, seriously injured and not yet recovered.  We can make an exception for you to return to Stargazing Island to heal, but Senior Brother Qin and the others must go..."</p><p>"This..."</p><p>"Forget it!"</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head, stopping Mu Yifeng from pleading further. "Don't make things difficult for Junior Brother Zhan. We'll go. Please take care of the other junior brothers, Senior Brother Mu."</p><p>Mu Yifeng, having exhausted all options, could only say, "The battlefield is chaotic; it's not an ordinary duel. Junior Brother Qin, please be careful. Consult with Junior Brother Zhan if anything happens."</p><p>Zhan Yi cupped his hands. "Rest assured, senior brothers.  As long as it's within my power, I certainly won't hesitate to help.  Moreover, the main purpose of this trip is to rescue Senior Fang and the others, not necessarily to engage in a major battle. The Island Master has already rushed over personally, and Master and the others are just taking precautions. There's no need to worry too much."</p><p>Mu Yifeng took the Qi Refining stage disciples back to Stargazing Island, while Qin Sang and the other two had to obey the order and follow Vice Island Master Xiao south.</p><p>On the way, Qin Sang inquired about Vice Island Master Xiao's identity from Zhan Yi.</p><p>This person wasn't from any of the major sects but was a disciple of the Yin Mountain Pass City Lord.  His cultivation was surprisingly at the late Gold Core stage, and his status on Stargazing Island was very high, second only to the Island Master!</p><p>Qin Sang thought to himself, *No wonder.* Facing Vice Island Master Xiao, he didn't have a single thought of resistance. The pressure emanating from this person was more terrifying than any other Core Formation cultivator he had ever met.</p><p>Just now, Vice Island Master Xiao casually formed a water dragon, easily breaking the Nether Cloud and imprisoning everyone.</p><p>Utterly powerless!</p><p>If every Core Formation cultivator was this terrifying, Qin Sang wouldn't dare to have any more ideas about that Ghost Yin Sect Gold Core cultivator.</p><p>So, it was a late Gold Core expert.</p><p>*Fortunately! Fortunately!*</p><p>Qin Sang felt relieved.  He then turned to Zhan Yi to inquire about the changing situation.</p><p>Unfortunately, Zhan Yi knew very little.</p><p>They traveled swiftly, and more and more people were conscripted. As long as they were Foundation Establishment cultivators, no one was spared.</p><p>The队伍 gradually grew, and they encountered two more fellow disciples from Mount Shaohua.</p><p>Under these circumstances, the bonds of fellowship came into play. They gathered together and joined forces with fellow cultivators from the Taiyi Pill Sect and the Shangyuan Pure Tranquility Palace.</p><p>Others did the same as Qin Sang and his group, seeking support and looking out for each other.</p><p>After a long detour, they returned to the Chaotic Islands waters.</p><p>Qin Sang smiled wryly.</p><p>At this point, the Chaotic Islands waters were no longer desolate.  Over a hundred Foundation Establishment cultivators had gathered, grouped in twos and threes, each occupying a small island, none able to settle down and cultivate.</p><p>As they arrived, dozens of streaks of light flew in from the east.</p><p>When the two sides met, Qin Sang saw the leader with a Red Dust Gourd hanging from his waist. It was Martial Uncle Che Yutao, whom he hadn't seen in a long time.</p><p>After many years, Che Yutao still gave Qin Sang the same profound feeling.</p><p>With a difference of one level in cultivation, such a large gap meant that unless Che Yutao actively revealed it, Qin Sang couldn't possibly discern his true cultivation level.</p><p>"Wait here for orders!"</p><p>Vice Island Master Cai's voice rang in his ears.  Qin Sang found that Vice Island Master Cai had disappeared.  He turned to look at Che Yutao, who had also vanished at some point.</p><p>Knowing that they had rushed to the front lines, Qin Sang prayed in his heart that the Heavenly Mandate Alliance would be sensible and stop at the right time.</p><p>He gathered with his fellow disciples on a small island.</p><p>Qin Sang rarely stayed at the sect and basically didn't know any of them.  After introductions by Zhan Yi, they got acquainted and began discussing how to form formations and eliminate enemies after the incident.</p><p>There were more than ten Mount Shaohua disciples affected this time, including a False Core expert named Teng Zhaogang.</p><p>With Teng Zhaogang present, Xie Ying and the others, who had been anxious, finally found their backbone.</p><p>Qin Sang was happy to have someone take the lead and immediately decided to follow Teng Zhaogang's lead, obeying all his commands.</p><p>Secretly, however, he was pondering survival strategies.</p><p>Once the battle began, if the Heavenly Mandate Alliance was weak, he could rely on his elusive Ebony Sword to ambush enemies and seize a decent share of the credit.</p><p>As long as he chose the right moment, he could strike and retrieve the Ebony Sword immediately.</p><p>If their side was at a disadvantage, he would keep a low profile and look for an opportunity to escape.</p><p>He had been training outside and had rich combat experience.  He was quite confident in his ability to judge the situation.  As long as he remembered not to be greedy for merit or linger in battle, he presumably wouldn't be in mortal danger.</p><p>His biggest fear was a chaotic battle, being caught in the crossfire of the Core Formation cultivators' fight.</p><p>If such a situation really occurred, he wouldn't need to think twice; he would just run for his life.</p><p>Being in the Chaotic Islands waters, they couldn't see the battlefield and didn't know when the battle between the Gold Core experts would be decided or what the final outcome would be.  Everyone could only wait anxiously.</p><p>Under these circumstances, Qin Sang sat down on the ground, entered meditative cultivation, adjusted his state, and prepared for any changes.</p><p>Time passed bit by bit, and night fell.</p><p>The crescent moon hung high, and the stars were brilliant.</p><p>The surroundings remained peaceful, only the undulating waves under the starry sky, sparkling with starlight, revealing everyone's unease.</p><p>Suddenly, a sharp whistling sound ripped through the night, coming from far ahead.</p><p>In an instant, the Chaotic Islands waters were in an uproar.</p><p>"They're here!"</p><p>"Form the array!"</p><p>Someone shouted.</p><p>On one island after another, streaks of light lit up one after another. Qin Sang suddenly opened his eyes, gripping the Cold Gold Sword and Yin-Yang Compass in his hands.</p><p>According to the agreed-upon formation, he flew to Teng Zhaogang's side, flanking him with Zhan Yi as his left and right wings.</p><p>At the same time, fellow cultivators from the Taiyi Pill Sect and Shangyuan Pure Tranquility Palace also moved closer.</p><p>Everyone's nerves were taut.</p><p>Above this expanse of desolate islands, a ribbon of light, no less brilliant than the Milky Way, appeared.</p>
