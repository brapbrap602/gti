<h1>Chapter 1839: What is a God?</h1><p>A sword's cry seemed to rise from within his heart. Qin Sang's spirit trembled, and he immediately retreated to a safe place, calming his mind and entering a state of tranquility.</p><p>Within his Purple Mansion.</p><p>His Nascent Soul was clad in Yin-Yang Armor, concealing the Buddha's light.</p><p>With a slight thought, Qin Sang withdrew the Yin-Yang Armor. The Buddha's light diffused, and simultaneously, sword light also appeared!</p><p>Then, a small, crystal-clear sword emerged from his Nascent Soul. It circled briefly within the Purple Mansion before flying out from between his eyebrows!</p><p>Qin Sang opened his eyes and gazed at the spirit sword, his heart filled with emotion.</p><p>“Old friend, it’s been a long time!”</p><p>The Cloud Wanderer Sword seemed to sense Qin Sang's thoughts. It hovered before him, its blade trembling slightly, emitting a humming sword cry, full of spiritual vitality!</p><p>His mind connected with the spirit sword. Qin Sang carefully sensed it and murmured, "So this is a Spirit Embryo…"</p><p>The Cloud Wanderer Sword had clearly stepped into the realm of Spirit Treasures, directly bypassing the Pseudo-Spirit Treasure stage and birthing a Spirit Embryo.</p><p>From the Spirit Embryo, Qin Sang sensed a familiar aura.</p><p>The Jiao Wood True Spirit, the remnants of Yun Youzi's True Spirit, had gestated this Spirit Embryo.</p><p>Only with a Spirit Embryo can a true Spirit Treasure be achieved.</p><p>Although the Cloud Wanderer Sword had been dormant for hundreds of years, for a Spirit Treasure, this wasn't a long time. If not for that trace of True Spirit, it would have taken even longer. After all, his previous cultivation was low, and his knowledge was insufficient, offering little help beyond allowing it to gestate naturally.</p><p>Among the treasures in Qin Sang's hands, the Palm-Heart Sword, forged by fusing the gauntlets with the deer antlers, and the Bright Mountain Armor, fused with True Treasure fragments, might surpass some Spirit Treasures in certain aspects, but neither had formed a Spirit Embryo.</p><p>The Palm-Heart Sword was merely a Pseudo-Spirit Treasure.</p><p>The Bright Mountain Armor didn't even possess spirituality.  Due to its special materials and forging process, its essence could only be considered a Dharma Treasure.</p><p>Their power wasn't weak, but their potential couldn't be compared to true Spirit Treasures.</p><p>Nurturing spirituality was a closely guarded secret of the path of Artifact Refinement.</p><p>Qin Sang had learned some true teachings from Master Gu, but he still didn't know how to quickly nurture spirituality.</p><p>Possessing a Spirit Embryo meant the Cloud Wanderer Sword had the potential for further transformation, giving birth to a Tool Spirit and becoming a Postnatal Spirit Treasure!</p><p>"A Tool Spirit…"</p><p>Qin Sang understood this step was still far off, but he couldn't help but anticipate it. After the Cloud Wanderer Sword gave birth to a Tool Spirit, would Yun Youzi awaken?</p><p>For hundreds of years, he hadn't used his natal spirit sword, solely to protect Yun Youzi's True Spirit, hoping for the day of their reunion.</p><p>The cold sword light illuminated Qin Sang's face. He seemed to be reminiscing, his expression tinged with melancholy.</p><p>'Hum… Hum...'</p><p>Qin Sang's thoughts were interrupted by the spirit sword.</p><p>“From now on, fight alongside me once more!” Qin Sang whispered.</p><p>In an instant, the sword light intensified.  Soaring sword intent accompanied by a clear sword cry erupted. The sword leaped into the air, its tip turning to face the illusion that had just forced Qin Sang back. It slashed through the air.</p><p>Sword energy arced like a rainbow, blasting open a doorway!</p><p>Qin Sang's robes fluttered as he strode through.</p><p>…</p><p>Two years later.</p><p>Jushan Prefecture, Star Island Immortal Lake, a desolate island in the north.</p><p>Qin Sang sat cross-legged on a reef, surrounded by a formation, summoning his cauldron.</p><p>The Fire Jade Centipede flew out from the cauldron and landed in Qin Sang's palm, swallowing the last Greenfrost Pill.</p><p>"Success or failure hinges on this!"</p><p>Qin Sang lightly tapped the center of his brow. His lifeblood transformed into a blood seal, flying into the flames on the Fire Jade Centipede's body and then melting away.</p><p>In the next moment, the blood seal spread beneath the Fire Jade Centipede, forming a complex diagram out of thin air. Each line on the diagram was formed from Qin Sang's lifeblood.</p><p>Blood Qi pervaded the air. The flames on the Fire Jade Centipede, even its body, gradually turned blood-red, becoming a Blood Centipede.</p><p>At this time, the Fire Jade Centipede curled into a ball, enduring the pain brought on by the impact of the pill's power.</p><p>Qin Sang left it alone for the moment, concentrating on perfecting the blood seal formation. This was a secret technique recorded in the "Panhu True Scripture." It couldn't directly increase the Fire Jade Centipede's chances of breakthrough, but it could stimulate the power of the lifeblood it had consumed during this period, paving the way for it.</p><p>Combined with the previous two Greenfrost Pills as a foundation, this was already Qin Sang's greatest support for it.</p><p>The formation was complete!</p><p>Blinding blood light was contained within the outer formation.</p><p>Within the blood light, the Fire Jade Centipede shrieked, rising into the air like a blood dragon coiling and weaving.</p><p>Qin Sang exhaled softly, stopped his actions, and gazed at the Fire Jade Centipede, waiting for the moment of its breakthrough.</p><p>'Whoosh… Whoosh…'</p><p>Blood and fire filled the air, whistling incessantly.</p><p>The Fire Jade Centipede's aura fluctuated violently, then transformed into a momentum, impacting against the bottleneck to the higher realm.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression was serious. He could feel the Fire Jade Centipede's yearning and the difficulty of its tribulation.</p><p>After all, the Fire Jade Centipede's potential wasn't as great as the Sky-Eyed Butterfly, and it hadn't undergone any mutations. This type of spirit insect, with extremely good luck, could forcefully initiate a fifth transformation, but only a very small number succeeded, and after breaking through, unless they encountered other opportunities, their future path would be difficult.</p><p>The shrieks grew sharper. The Fire Jade Centipede's body tensed, like an arrow loosed from a bow, soaring into the sky. Its aura surged dramatically at this moment.</p><p>Qin Sang subconsciously stood up, then his pupils constricted slightly, and he sighed softly.</p><p>That surging aura, at the moment it reached its peak, suddenly plummeted. The Fire Jade Centipede's figure froze in mid-air, unable to continue its ascent.</p><p>Those mournful shrieks echoed through the sky. The Fire Jade Centipede circled continuously, filled with endless unwillingness.</p><p>Qin Sang empathized with this unwillingness. He had experienced the same. Sighing, he gently beckoned.</p><p>The Fire Jade Centipede slowly landed in his palm, lying prostrate and motionless, like a child who had made a mistake.</p><p>"You still have a long time ahead…"</p><p>Qin Sang murmured. Spirit insects didn't have Four Nine Heavenly Tribulations; they had opportunities before their lifespans were exhausted.</p><p>However, he couldn't expend more energy on the Fire Jade Centipede in the near future.</p><p>The three Greenfrost Pills were gone, the effect of accumulated pill power had vanished.  More Greenfrost Pills wouldn't be as effective as this attempt. He could only wait for the Fire Jade Centipede's own opportunity.</p><p>He was advancing rapidly, but the Fire Jade Centipede was stagnating, no longer able to keep pace with him.</p><p>Qin Sang felt a sense of loss, but he was somewhat prepared. As he continued forward, there would always be old companions left behind.</p><p>Like Princess Dongyang to him, and like him to Senior Sister Qingjun.</p><p>If they couldn't catch up, there might be a chance for reunion in the future, or they might be separated by life and death.</p><p>The Fire Jade Centipede had merely followed him for a longer time.</p><p>Putting the Fire Jade Centipede back into the cauldron, Qin Sang removed the formations on the reef and flew towards Sword Heart Island.</p><p>He visited True Person Zhijian on Sword Heart Island, discussing swordsmanship and inquiring about the recent situation. Then he left Star Island Immortal Lake to meet Mo Xingdao.</p><p>When he saw Mo Xingdao again, there was a noticeable change. His features were lively, his eyes bright, no different from an ordinary person. It was almost impossible to tell with the naked eye that he had a puppet body.</p><p>"Thanks to the spirit items Fellow Daoist sent, I have hope of restoring my cultivation with this puppet body," Mo Xingdao's gratitude towards Qin Sang was sincere.</p><p>If not for Qin Sang's unwavering assistance, his fate would have been uncertain.</p><p>"I also want Fellow Daoist to recover soon and explore the Healing Altar with me," Qin Sang nodded with satisfaction.</p><p>Hearing the implication in Qin Sang's words, Mo Xingdao's eyes lit up. "Fellow Daoist has entered the Healing Altar again?  Any gains?"</p><p>"I've been there many times, but I haven't pinpointed the location of the Red Gold Spirit Needle yet, but I have some clues."  Pausing, Qin Sang waved his hand, displaying scenes one after another. "Fellow Daoist, take a look. Do any of these seem familiar?"</p><p>He displayed the various illusions he had experienced in the Healing Altar.</p><p>Mo Xingdao watched attentively, marveling at the strangeness of the illusions and also shocked by Qin Sang's strength. Although he hadn't seen Qin Sang enter the illusions, he could sense the danger contained within them through these images.</p><p>After their exchange, Qin Sang left Mo Manor and embarked on his return journey.</p><p>He had previously learned that the situation hadn't changed significantly. The Ghostfang Kingdom and the Dao Court were still at a stalemate. But with the previous lesson learned, Qin Sang preferred to take a more circuitous route.</p><p>He returned to his cave dwelling safely.</p><p>As always, Qin Sang entered meditative cultivation.</p><p>But not long after, he woke up, retrieving an item - the Thunder Turtle's demon core.  Its luster was now dim.</p><p>After entering the Nascent Soul stage, Qin Sang had primarily relied on the power of the Thunder Turtle's demon core to forge his cauldron.</p><p>The Thunder Turtle had possessed mid-Nascent Soul cultivation before its death, but with continued use, a single demon core wasn't enough to support his cultivation to the peak of mid-Nascent Soul.</p><p>"What a pity. I haven't found any Nascent Soul stage ferocious beasts in the Wicked Lands..."</p><p>Qin Sang frowned. With his current strength, he dared to fight even late-Nascent Soul ferocious beasts and had a chance of killing them.</p><p>However, the Wicked Lands weren't safe now. Unless absolutely necessary, Qin Sang didn't want to stay there too long.</p><p>Later, he might have to try the Qingluan's Origin Thunder Power.</p><p>After pondering for a moment, Qin Sang summoned his cauldron, continuing to extract thunder power and inscribe runes.</p><p>During this time, Qin Sang's activities were very regular. He perfected his cauldron and cultivated simultaneously, venturing into the illusions every so often, returning to contemplate countermeasures when he encountered resistance.</p><p>In the third year of his cultivation, Qin Sang left his cave dwelling once more. Before his departure, he had made up his mind, preparing to find the Red Gold Spirit Needle in one fell swoop.</p><p>Passing through the illusions one by one, Qin Sang smoothly reached the place where he had stopped last time.</p><p>Ahead was a vast expanse of white mist.</p><p>The mist was like a great river within the Healing Altar, its ends unseen, stretching across his path.  The mist flowed from right to left.</p><p>The seemingly gently flowing mist actually contained a force more terrifying than a raging torrent.</p><p>Qin Sang recalled his previous experience.  He had only reached the halfway point with all his might because the Cloud Wanderer Sword was useless here, leaving him to cross with only his physical body.</p><p>However, after returning and contemplating, inspiration struck Qin Sang. He realized he might have overlooked something, and he had come here to verify this conjecture.</p><p>The Cloud Wanderer Sword hovered above his head. Qin Sang only activated the Great Vajra Wheel Seal and stepped into the mist.</p><p>The moment he entered the mist river, a torrent rushed towards him. Qin Sang's figure swayed, only seeking self-preservation, not retaliating, like a small boat drifting with the current.</p><p>Drifting like this, he was swept downstream by the mist current.  Qin Sang, seemingly having given up resistance, suddenly had a flash of light in his eyes.  An overwhelmingly powerful sword intent erupted.</p><p>The Cloud Wanderer Sword flashed and disappeared, replaced by hanging sword stars.</p><p>The same Seven Lunar Mansions Sword Formation, when used with the Cloud Wanderer Sword and the Grey Warbler Sword, had a noticeable difference in power.</p><p>The Cloud Wanderer Sword was his natal spirit sword; their minds were connected, and its own rank also surpassed the Grey Warbler Sword.  Such a difference wasn't surprising.</p><p>The sword stars appeared.</p><p>Only the rolling mist was sealed within the sword formation.</p><p>Qin Sang stared at the center of the sword formation, a smile gradually appearing on his face. "As expected, there's something behind this, not like a living creature. Come to think of it, I haven't seen any true living creatures in the Healing Altar…"</p><p>The disordered mist was trapped, unable to escape.  A silhouette resembling a tiger or leopard gradually condensed in the center of the mist, roaring at the sword stars.</p><p>…</p><p>While Qin Sang was immersed in cultivation and exploration, he was completely unaware of the dramatic changes occurring in the outside world.</p><p>Northern Baishi Prefecture, a certain prefecture, dark clouds gathered, heavy snow fell, and winter arrived overnight.</p><p>A Daoist priest arrived, braving the wind and snow, his expression grave, his steps hurried, and he rushed into the Prefecture Altar.</p><p>"This subordinate greets Lord Inspector!"</p><p>Those he encountered along the way saluted and paid their respects.</p><p>This person was True Person Wan, whom Qin Sang had met once at the Jushan Prefecture Altar.</p><p>He seemed to have urgent matters, only having time to nod briefly to his fellow Daoists before hurrying past, causing everyone to wonder what major event had occurred.</p><p>True Person Wan went straight to a secluded hall deep within the Prefecture Altar. He slowed his pace outside the door, straightened his Daoist robes, and bowed respectfully, requesting an audience.</p><p>"Enter," a vigorous voice came from within the hall.</p><p>True Person Wan gently pushed the door open and entered. Seeing an old Daoist priest sitting upright behind the desk, he showed respect and addressed him as Martial Uncle.</p><p>The old Daoist priest was unexpectedly a Grand True Person of the Northern Polar Exorcism Court.</p><p>His official rank was Third Grade, Nine Heavens Golden Palace Upper Minister, Nine Heavens Censor, and Co-judge of the Exorcism Court Affairs!</p><p>True Monarchs held a transcendental status. The Dao Court was generally managed by Grand True Persons. This old Daoist priest's position in the Northern Polar Exorcism Court was second only to the Third Grade Nine Heavens Inspector, making him extremely influential.</p><p>True Person Wan called him Martial Uncle to show their close relationship.</p><p>"What's the rush?" The old Daoist priest shifted his gaze, his expression indifferent.</p><p>True Person Wan said solemnly, "The Ghostfang Kingdom has begun to move."</p><p>"Oh?" The old Daoist priest's eyes flashed. "Are you certain?"</p><p>True Person Wan nodded. "The experts from the two Courts have been entangled with the demons in the Wicked Sea for many years, attacking and defending each other, reaching a stalemate. However, the Healing Altar just issued a decree. It has been confirmed that the treasure that was contested with the demons last time did not fall into the Jushan Prefecture Healing Altar afterward, but flowed out from within the Healing Altar!"</p><p>The old Daoist priest pondered, nodding. "Since this matter is confirmed, with the temperament of those demons, they won't wait a moment longer. They should have already begun gathering their forces, preparing to enter the Healing Altar in a large-scale invasion."</p><p>"This disciple requests a decree!  I will immediately assemble manpower and enter the Healing Altar to slay demons and subdue evil, never allowing the demons to succeed." True Person Wan bowed, volunteering for the mission.</p><p>The old Daoist priest stood up, walked out of the hall, looked at the gloomy sky of the snowy night, his expression unreadable, and sighed softly: "A storm is brewing! The demons' plot has been exposed, this time they will surely be frenzied.  There will be a fierce battle.  This poor Daoist will go with you."</p><p>True Person Wan was overjoyed. "With Martial Uncle overseeing the situation outside the Healing Altar, we will surely ward off all evil!"</p><p>"Not so," the old Daoist priest shook his head slightly. "This poor Daoist will enter the Jushan Prefecture Healing Altar with you."</p><p>"This…"</p><p>True Person Wan was stunned.</p><p>As far as he knew, the Jushan Prefecture Healing Altar was one of the most special places in the world.  A Grand True Person entering would trigger a violent eruption of the Healing Altar's divine power illusions, inviting mortal danger. This had been proven time and time again throughout history and was unavoidable.</p><p>Meeting the old Daoist priest's profound gaze, True Person Wan suddenly understood, and his face paled. "Martial Uncle, you intend to…"</p><p>It wasn't entirely impossible for a Grand True Person to enter the Healing Altar.</p><p>For example, by severing their own cultivation!</p><p>"Please reconsider, Martial Uncle!"</p><p>True Person Wan was horrified, kneeling and pleading urgently.</p><p>Severing one's cultivation meant falling back to the Hollow Profound realm.  Even if they could recover in the future, it would be no easy feat.</p><p>A Grand True Person, a revered being, personally venturing into danger. Any accident could lead to irreversible consequences and be a great loss to the Dao Court.</p><p>True Person Wan couldn't imagine how important this matter was to the Dao Court for his Martial Uncle to make such a decision!</p><p>What exactly were the Dao Court and the demons fighting over?</p><p>The old Daoist priest slowly returned to his seat behind the desk and gently stroked the jade surface.</p><p>"With your current cultivation, there are some secrets you are now qualified to know…"</p><p>The old Daoist priest's eyes were deep, as if reminiscing about something. He suddenly asked a question.</p><p>"What is a God?"</p><p>(End of Chapter)</p>
