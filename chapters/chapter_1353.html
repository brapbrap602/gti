<h1>Chapter 1345: Bai's Entrustment</h1><p>The phantom gazed down at the battlefield.</p><p>Its eyes, condensed from white light, shifted slightly, landing on the bone claw.</p><p>It raised its right hand, extended a finger, and gently pointed toward the bone claw.</p><p>At the same time.</p><p>Elder Zhenyi emerged from a shower of light.</p><p>A gentle breeze carried a fine drizzle, shrouding the scene in mist.</p><p>His figure appeared somewhat ethereal, his movements no slower than Elder Canghong's. Swiftly, he formed a hand seal, then crossed his hands, and a phantom array diagram shot out from his palms.</p><p>Elder Canghong's target was the bone claw itself.</p><p>The moment the phantom pointed, the void trembled, and a speck of white light struck the bone claw without a moment's delay.</p><p>'Crack, crack, crack...'</p><p>The white light seemed to contain countless blades, madly slicing through the ghostly claw.</p><p>Meanwhile, Elder Zhenyi chose to shield Qin Sang from disaster.</p><p>The array diagram flashed, appearing between Qin Sang and the bone claw. It unfolded and stood upright, its center facing the bone claw, spinning rapidly.</p><p>The array diagram stirred the winds and clouds, its runes flickering.</p><p>Two top-tier experts had simultaneously unleashed extraordinary secret techniques to jointly stop the bone claw!</p><p>In the next moment, a look of shock appeared in the eyes of all three!</p><p>'Poof!'</p><p>The white light dimmed, countless strands of light scattering.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>A palm-shaped hole tore through the center of the array diagram.</p><p>The bone claw forcefully broke through both obstacles, its momentum slightly diminished, but its demonic aura still surged like a tidal wave!</p><p>At this critical moment.</p><p>A black shadow rushed forward, barely inserting itself between Qin Sang and the bone claw—it was the Nascent Soul Talisman Puppet, appearing to save its master.</p><p>The Nascent Soul Talisman Puppet knew no fear. Facing the bone claw, its expression remained stiff and unchanging as it lunged forward to attack.</p><p>'Bang!'</p><p>The Nascent Soul Talisman Puppet collided with the bone claw.</p><p>In an instant, the black shadow was sent flying back, crashing heavily to the ground.</p><p>To everyone's astonishment, a claw mark now marred the puppet's chest, deeply embedded in its torso. If it were a human, they would have been eviscerated.</p><p>The Nascent Soul Talisman Puppet flipped back onto its feet. The claw mark on its chest smoothed over at a visible rate, leaving no visible damage. Only the shattered talisman seal inside revealed that it had been injured.</p><p>The Jade Bone was somewhat surprised.</p><p>Though it knew this was a puppet body and that such an attack couldn't be fatal, the puppet's swift recovery still caught it off guard. Clearly, it had been crafted from exceptional spiritual materials.</p><p>However, its target wasn't the puppet. Its soul flame remained fixed on Qin Sang.</p><p>With Elder Canghong, Elder Zhenyi, and the Nascent Soul Talisman Puppet joining forces to block it, the bone claw finally came to a halt.</p><p>Qin Sang continued to retreat rapidly, his vigilance undiminished. He knew full well that the Jade Bone had set its sights on him and would not rest until it achieved its goal!</p><p>"Begone!"</p><p>The Jade Bone's true form appeared. Its skull turned, sweeping its gaze over Elder Canghong and Elder Zhenyi. The soul flames in its eye sockets suddenly erupted.</p><p>Elder Zhenyi's heart surged with warning. His figure instantly shifted dozens of feet, but he still felt a sharp pain. To his horror, his Thousand Jade Horsetail Whisk had reverted to its original form, engulfed in a ball of soul flame. He hurriedly withdrew it.</p><p>Elder Canghong let out a muffled groan, a trickle of blood seeping from the corner of his mouth. The phantom behind him shattered with a resounding crack!</p><p>'Whoosh, whoosh...'</p><p>Streaks of treasure light shot out from the blood clouds, converging on the Jade Bone.</p><p>During this time, the other Nascent Soul cultivators had finally steadied themselves from the earlier shock. Seeing the situation outside, they each summoned their treasures to lend support.</p><p>Elder Zhenyi and Elder Canghong suppressed their injuries and attacked once more.</p><p>The Jade Bone snorted coldly, its face filled with disdain, before its figure vanished on the spot.</p><p>The Nascent Soul cultivators were all seasoned veterans. Though they couldn't see through the Jade Bone's movements, they could infer its intentions based on its relentless pursuit of Qin Sang. Without hesitation, they redirected their magical treasures.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>Streams of light scattered in all directions.</p><p>Their attacks struck as one, but alas, all they destroyed was the Jade Bone's afterimage.</p><p>A surge of purple light erupted from the Jade Bone, rushing toward Qin Sang like a tidal wave.</p><p>'Bang!'</p><p>As expected, the Nascent Soul Talisman Puppet was sent flying once more.</p><p>Qin Sang, caught in the aftermath, shuddered violently.</p><p>The Demon-Binding Rope remained clenched in his hand, yet he had not yet unleashed it.</p><p>Bai had secretly passed the Demon-Binding Rope to him, instructing him to use it against the Jade Bone if he ever felt his life was in danger. However, unless absolutely necessary, he was to avoid using it, buying as much time as possible.</p><p>"The Jade Bone's power is terrifying. I wonder how it compares to the Demon Lord's soul fragment on Yitian Peak?" Qin Sang had been incapable of facing the Demon Lord's soul fragment back then, so he had no basis for comparison.</p><p>But one thing was certain—the Demon Lord of Canglang Sea and Lingzhu Zi were no match for it!</p><p>"This thing has set its sights on me..."</p><p>Qin Sang's thoughts raced as he once again summoned the Ebony Sword.</p><p>'Bang!'</p><p>This time, the sword formation held out even less.</p><p>Elder Zhenyi and the others dared not delay, each unleashing their trump cards to rescue him.</p><p>None of those present harbored any particular fondness for Qin Sang, but they certainly didn't want to see him die at the hands of the Jade Bone. Otherwise, their own situations would become perilous.</p><p>Qin Sang seemed to have reached the end of his rope, making one final gamble. With a forceful flick of his sleeve, eighteen demon banners flew out, swirling around him. The demonic fire was unsealed, transforming into a fiery dragon poised to strike.</p><p>"Hahaha..."</p><p>The Jade Bone laughed maniacally. This was the moment it had been waiting for. Killing Qin Sang would solve everything, but even if it couldn't, forcing him to use the demonic fire would still achieve its goal.</p><p>Seeing the demonic fire, the Jade Bone immediately intensified its pursuit of Qin Sang.</p><p>A strange suction force appeared in the void, its source emanating a dense soul aura. A pitch-black funnel materialized before everyone's eyes.</p><p>The funnel was no larger than a palm, yet the power it exuded was astonishing. Even the surrounding blood clouds were affected, curling and twisting.</p><p>The funnel inverted, aiming directly at Qin Sang.</p><p>More precisely, at the eighteen demon banners surrounding him.</p><p>Under Qin Sang's control, the formation activated, but the banners didn't grow to several feet tall. Each remained less than the height of a person, spinning rapidly around him.</p><p>The suction force descended.</p><p>The banners swayed, immediately showing signs of instability.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression shifted slightly. He poured his true essence into the banners with all his might, yet he still couldn't stabilize them.</p><p>'Rustle, rustle...'</p><p>The banners shook even more violently.</p><p>The demonic fire, which had transformed into a fiery dragon, now had flames peeling off its body, drifting toward the funnel.</p><p>Seeing this, everyone was stunned.</p><p>They finally understood why the Jade Bone had been so relentless in its pursuit of Qin Sang. It had set its sights on the demonic fire in his possession and could forcibly seize it—an act of sheer dominance!</p><p>Even more shocking was that Qin Sang could clearly feel the remaining demonic fire sealed within the banners becoming restless at this moment. The demonic flames danced, attempting to break free from the banners' seals.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>The banner surfaces, woven from soul threads, fluttered violently, as if they might tear apart at any moment.</p><p>No matter how Qin Sang tried to control the banners, he couldn't restrain the demonic fire or block the funnel's pull on it.</p><p>The Jade Bone formed a seal with one hand and pressed it forcefully toward the funnel.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The demonic fire, now a fiery dragon, suddenly erupted, breaking free from Qin Sang's control and drifting upward of its own accord.</p><p>Qin Sang abruptly raised his head, his cold gaze fixed on the Jade Bone, his expression showing not a trace of anxiety. </p>
