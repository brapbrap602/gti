<h1>Chapter 1538: Pawns (4k)</h1><p>“How long has the fairy been at Jiuga Mountain?”</p><p>Qin Sang rose to greet her.</p><p>“Three months.”</p><p>Liuli walked in, removing her cloak.</p><p>Her cloak was very large, concealing not only her face but also her graceful figure.  This attire was somewhat unusual in Buddhist territory, but Jiuga Mountain was a mixed bag of people, so it didn't seem that out of place.</p><p>This was because she encountered some unruly individuals while traveling through the Northern Wastelands.</p><p>In the cultivation world, not every cultivator possesses sufficient self-control, and exceptional beauty can easily attract trouble.</p><p>Liuli, like Qin Sang, always favored a low-key approach, never revealing her true cultivation unless absolutely necessary.</p><p>The reputations of Xuantian Palace and Listening Snow Tower, however great, didn't reach the Central Plains, and couldn't deter petty villains.</p><p>Liuli killed them all with a single sword, but to avoid further trouble, she simply put on the cloak, and things were indeed much quieter afterward.</p><p>“Three months, exactly the time I spent at the Sky Crack Valley…”</p><p>Qin Sang invited Liuli to sit down and briefly recounted her experiences.</p><p>“Sky Crack Valley isn't far from the Nineteen States of Smoke and Rain, making it an ideal location, but unfortunately, the cave dwelling was destroyed. I rescued a Golden Core cultivator on the way and have sent him to the Nineteen States of Smoke and Rain to investigate. Once I obtain the Buddha Bone Relic, I will go there myself. If Xiaoxiangzi’s records are accurate, I might have a chance to take over a top-tier Daoist sect…”</p><p>The Nineteen States of Smoke and Rain are indeed a sacred place for cultivation, but as far as Qin Sang knew, the major mountains and rivers were already occupied.</p><p>This wasn't a time of chaos; various forces were deeply intertwined, with complex relationships and mutual support.</p><p>Seizing someone else's mountain gate was clearly impossible and would make one a target for everyone.</p><p>Moreover, there were Nascent Soul cultivators stationed in the Central Plains, and their strength was far from sufficient to act recklessly.</p><p>To establish a foothold in the Central Plains, one either had to rely on a certain sect or choose a place in the Northern Wastelands, Western Desert, or overseas immortal mountains to establish a cave dwelling.</p><p>However, if the cave dwelling was too remote, far from the center of the cultivation world, timely communication would be impossible. If something major happened, by the time they received the news and rushed to the Central Plains, it would already be over.</p><p>Qin Sang's goal was not only to cultivate himself but also to gather information and search for opportunities for Nascent Soul ascension.</p><p>He directly mentioned the matter of the cave dwelling to Liuli, implicitly inviting her to join him. Liuli was not only a powerful cultivator but also someone worthy of trust.</p><p>She came for the Buddha Bone Relic, unlike Qin Sang who was entangled in various karmic relationships. Her main tasks were cultivation and investigating the mystery of the Purple Micro Palace's ascension; it didn't matter much where she was.</p><p>Liuli hesitated, giving no clear answer.</p><p>Qin Sang was familiar with Liuli's temperament and didn't mind.  He recalled his discovery while climbing the mountain, "Has something unusual happened on Jiuga Mountain? Those Buddhist cultivators seem… odd.”</p><p>Liuli hummed, “A month ago, the Moonlight Bodhisattva arrived and set up an altar on Jiuga Mountain, attracting many monks to debate with her.”</p><p>“Bodhisattva?”</p><p>Qin Sang was taken aback.</p><p>Buddhism venerated Buddhas and Bodhisattvas.</p><p>Did someone bring the temple's statue of the Moonlight Bodhisattva out for a journey?</p><p>Liuli shook her head. “The Moonlight Bodhisattva is said to be from the deep desert, well-versed in Buddhist scriptures, and highly cultivated. She calls herself ‘Bodhisattva,’ claiming that unless someone can defeat her in debate, she will not change her title. That's why there was a debate a month ago.”</p><p>Qin Sang clicked his tongue.</p><p>Even Nascent Soul cultivators in Buddhism only held the title of Saint, such as Huiguang Saint from the present-day Ganlu Zen Monastery.</p><p>To dare use the title ‘Bodhisattva’ was presumptuous!</p><p>A debate was the least of it.</p><p>Qin Sang wouldn't be surprised if that person was attacked on Jiuga Mountain.</p><p>The deep Western Desert was sparsely populated and isolated. Calling oneself a Buddha or ancestor there was fine; no one would care.  But to dare act so brazenly on Jiuga Mountain… didn't she fear attracting Buddhist saints?</p><p>“What was the result of the debate?”</p><p>Qin Sang asked curiously.</p><p>Liuli hesitated. “I'm not well-versed in Buddhist scriptures… The debate lasted three days, after which the monks were speechless, and the Moonlight Bodhisattva left the mountain without anyone daring to stop her.”</p><p>“Since she has the courage to call herself a ‘Bodhisattva,’ she must have the ability.”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded. Those monks must have rushed to help after receiving news, but the Moonlight Bodhisattva was no longer on Jiuga Mountain.</p><p>Xuelian Mountain was known as the origin of Buddhism, mainly serving as a spiritual holy land for Buddhist cultivators. The top Buddhist sects weren't located there but mostly in the Central Plains.</p><p>Three days of debate, and once the news spread, she left.</p><p>This person must also be cautious.</p><p>During this period, Buddhist disciples have gathered from all directions. I managed to gather a lot of information.  </p><p>Saying this, Liuli took out a sheepskin map, spread it on the table, and pointed to a spot in the desert, "The Buddha bone relic is likely here—the Seven Lakes of the瀚海!"</p><p>Qin Sang was delighted at the news.</p><p>"Thank you, fairy!"</p><p>He quickly looked down, noticing that Liuli's finger was pointing at a large oasis.</p><p>This oasis was not a single entity but seven oases of varying sizes, forming a line in the desert, not far from each other.</p><p>Each oasis had a prominent lake depicted on it.</p><p>The map was very simple, containing only this information.</p><p>Liuli explained in detail:  "The Western Desert is not monotonous; the situation is ever-changing, with numerous countries.  Western Desert cultivators divide the desert into several regions based on different characteristics, such as the Xuelian Mountains, the瀚海… These seven lakes have never dried up, nourishing the oases, like seven stars in the desert. Later, Buddhist practitioners built temples by the lakes; the Seven Lakes of the瀚海 also refers to the seven temples by the lakes today.  They are closely connected and are the dominant force of the瀚海, possessing considerable power. My investigation shows that there were originally many oases and hundreds of lakes of various sizes here, which gradually merged, leaving only seven large lakes.  The previous environment matches the records of Senior Xiao Xiangzi."</p><p>"Deng Ci Temple, Zhu Lan Temple…"</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze swept across the seven temples, and he raised his head in confusion, "There's no Yin Chan Temple?"</p><p>Senior Xiao Xiangzi mentioned that the Buddha bone relic was formed from the remains of an enlightened monk from Yin Chan Temple.</p><p>Liuli explained her reasoning for believing the relic was in the Seven Lakes of the瀚海: "There were originally no temples here. Legend says that a great virtuous monk travelled here alone and, seeing the people uncivilized, built temples nearby to spread Buddhism. That temple was Yin Chan Temple. Afterward, a great upheaval occurred in the瀚海, and Yin Chan Temple disappeared for unknown reasons, but more temples were built, suggesting Buddhism prevailed. If Yin Chan Temple lost its succession, the temple's treasures would most likely end up in the hands of these seven temples."</p><p>Qin Sang remained silent.</p><p>As the saying goes, times change.</p><p>In this world, even a slight difference can lead to a huge discrepancy.</p><p>Even if Liuli's guess is entirely correct,</p><p>we are afraid that there were still successors in Yin Chan Temple at that time who were forced to leave, taking the temple treasures with them, concealing their identities. Finding them again would be extremely difficult.</p><p>Liuli said, "Whether this Yin Chan Temple is that Yin Chan Temple still needs verification in the瀚海."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded and said solemnly, "Time is of the essence. Let's set off as soon as possible!"</p><p>There was another hidden worry that neither of them mentioned.</p><p>If they stole the relic from Yin Chan Temple, they would face the temple's experts.</p><p>Now, they might provoke seven major temples simultaneously!</p><p>It’s too early to worry about these things now; it's better to wait until we determine the whereabouts of the Buddha bone relic before devising a plan.</p><p>Liuli spent three months in the Xuelian Mountains, essentially investigating all the information she could find, so there was no need to waste any more time. The next morning, they set off down the mountain together.</p><p>On their way down the mountain, the number of Buddhist practitioners visibly increased.</p><p>The turmoil caused by Moonlight Bodhisattva was still brewing, affecting a wide area.</p><p>After leaving Jiu Jia Mountain, they didn't travel far before they encountered endless yellow sand, the air dry and hot, forming clearly visible, rolling heat waves in the sky.</p><p>Of course, even the harshest conditions of the Western Desert could not compare to the storm belt; the Ten Directions Earth-Opening Shuttle could easily handle it.</p><p>Although the environment here seems harsh, it is actually the most vibrant place in the Western Desert.</p><p>The snowmelt from the Xuelian Mountains forms several streams and underground rivers flowing south. Although not as large as the Tian Tuo River, they still infuse the desert with life.</p><p>People live along these rivers, forming countless countries, most of which revere Buddhism, known as the Three Thousand Buddhist Kingdoms.</p><p>The瀚海 lies south of the Three Thousand Buddhist Kingdoms.</p><p>This is not yet the deepest part of the Western Desert. Further west lies the true death desert, a land devoid of life.</p><p>Qin Sang and Liuli traveled slowly, gathering information along the way, passing through countless Buddhist kingdoms and experiencing exotic customs, which was a worthwhile journey.</p><p>As they were about to leave the Three Thousand Buddhist Kingdoms,</p><p>they unexpectedly learned some news related to Moonlight Bodhisattva.</p><p>After the three-day Buddhist debate at Jiu Jia Mountain, Moonlight Bodhisattva left Jiu Jia Mountain and disappeared without a trace. Western Desert Buddhist practitioners searched everywhere but found nothing.</p><p>Unexpectedly, ten days ago, Moonlight Bodhisattva suddenly appeared in a Buddhist kingdom, once again boasting and setting up an altar.</p><p>Unfortunately, the virtuous monks there were even less capable than those at Jiu Jia Mountain. In less than a day, they were defeated by Moonlight Bodhisattva’s arguments, leaving in shame.</p><p>Facing these repeated provocations, the Buddhist community was enraged, and even many secular monks began to stir.</p><p>Regardless of the Buddhist sect's response, Qin Sang and Liuli directly passed through the Three Thousand Buddhist Kingdoms, crossed the desert, and entered the vast瀚海.</p><p>The Seven Stars of the瀚海 are located deep within the瀚海.</p><p>They didn't directly approach the Seven Stars, instead settling in a market town on the edge of an oasis.</p><p>Only then did they learn that the seven oases contained not only seven temples, but hundreds more, excluding those built by ordinary monks and civilians.</p><p>This clearly shows the flourishing state of Buddhism in the Western Desert.</p><p>Liuli remained cloaked, while Qin Sang dressed as a lay Buddhist, wearing a robe and a hat.</p><p>The瀚海 is prone to sandstorms.  The fierce winds whipped up sand, stinging the face like knives; the locals wore similar attire.</p><p>“Creak.”</p><p>Qin Sang opened the inn door to find Liuli already back.  They had gone out separately to gather information.</p><p>“I’ve obtained a list of the many Buddhist temples in the瀚海,”</p><p>Qin Sang closed the door and whispered, “including secular temples. I skimmed it; there’s no Yin Chan Temple. We need to verify separately. Several large temples seem to have cultivators; we can start with them and discreetly approach the Seven Stars.”</p><p>Liuli offered a theory: “During the great upheaval, Yin Chan Temple might have simply ceased cultivation, with the ordinary monks changing the temple's name to avoid disaster.”</p><p>Qin Sang pondered this for a moment, “Possible. But that means we’ll have to visit every single temple.”</p><p>“I’ll go.”</p><p>said Liuli.</p><p>Qin Sang understood.</p><p>Undeniably, the Seven Stars of the瀚海 have Yuan Ying stage cultivators. However, since their reputation spread, no force has dared to challenge the seven temples' status.</p><p>Their current strength is difficult to assess.</p><p>It's unlikely they have Grand Cultivators.</p><p>In the Central Plains, Nascent Soul cultivators are elusive, and late-stage Yuan Ying cultivators remain the world's top powerhouses.</p><p>In the Buddhist world, when a high monk breaks through to the late Yuan Ying stage, a grand water and land ceremony is traditionally held to celebrate.</p><p>According to their intelligence, the Seven Stars have never held such a ceremony.</p><p>Qin Sang materialized his spiritual sense, deliberately concealing his cultivation.  Unless a cultivator below the late Yuan Ying stage used a detection technique directly, they wouldn't be able to see through his cultivation. Therefore, it was safest for him to contact the cultivators.</p><p>Liuli was less capable in this regard.</p><p>“Good.”</p><p>Qin Sang immediately produced the list. They divided the temples into two categories and set out separately.</p><p>…</p><p>After separating, Qin Sang began his solitary journey through the oasis, openly and secretly investigating the temples’ backgrounds.</p><p>Acting too hastily might arouse suspicion, so Qin Sang played the part of a devout lay Buddhist, which slowed his progress.</p><p>Bei Shan Temple.</p><p>One of the Seven Stars of the瀚海, ranked sixth.</p><p>During this time, Qin Sang had already visited the lowest-ranked Deng Ci Nunnery, but failed to meet the abbess, only speaking with a few low-cultivation young novices and gaining no valuable information.</p><p>Neither Bei Shan Temple nor Deng Ci Nunnery had Yuan Ying cultivators.  The abbess was reportedly only at the late Golden Core stage.</p><p>However, the temple's formations were no ordinary ones; clearly, they were crafted by a Yuan Ying cultivator.</p><p>After much observation, Qin Sang determined that he couldn't infiltrate without being noticed, so he restrained himself and patiently searched for an opportunity.</p><p>Bei Shan Temple was built by a lake and didn’t refuse commoners.  </p><p>The temple was bustling with people.</p><p>Qin Sang behaved honestly, queuing up with other devotees to enter.</p><p>He didn’t display his cultivation, but years of cultivation manifested in his bearing, making him stand out among the commoners, causing the receiving monk to look at him a few more times.</p><p>Incense burning, bowing, listening to scriptures…</p><p>Qin Sang was extremely familiar with these procedures.</p><p>After listlessly listening to the high monk's sermon, Qin Sang rose and left the hall with the other believers. He was about to call for a novice to find a pretext to tour the temple when he felt a sudden intuition.</p><p>A moment later.</p><p>A monk approached from a distance. The other devotees were oblivious to his approach.</p><p>“Amitabha Buddha, please excuse me, sir.”</p><p>The monk walked directly to Qin Sang, clasped his hands, and bowed.</p><p>“This disciple greets the Abbot.”</p><p>Qin Sang hurriedly returned the bow, recognizing the late Golden Core cultivator as the Abbot of Bei Shan Temple and thinking, "This was effortless."</p><p>Both knew the other was a cultivator, so they dispensed with formalities and exchanged Dharma names.</p><p>The Abbot's Dharma name was Seng Yan.</p><p>Qin Sang used the same story:  he had been raised by monks since childhood, given the name Mingyue, and should have been ordained, but a temple calamity had left him wandering the world.</p><p>Although he had been fortunate enough to have contact with the path of cultivation, he had also committed boundless sins, and now, in repentance, he had made a vow to travel the ten directions and worship ten thousand Buddhas to atone for his sins.</p><p>During this conversation, Qin Sang was invited by the Abbot to a quiet hall.</p>
