<h1>305. Lost and Found</h1><p>The Serpent King understood how powerful the talisman was, and with its obvious speed advantage, it wisely avoided a direct confrontation with Qin Sang.</p><p>As potent as the talisman was, it was no longer possible to find an opening for a fatal hit like before. Qin Sang did not dare recall the talisman and risk leaving himself vulnerable. As such, he could only persevere, pushing his spiritual power to the limits, yet without much success.</p><p>Fortunately, his purpose was not to injure the Serpent King, but to stall for Yun Youzi.</p><p>He could not give up now.</p><p>Wincing with abdominal pain from the spiritual pills he had consumed, Qin Sang continued to drain his spiritual sea, harnessing every ounce of power to energize the Ebony Wood Sword.</p><p>At that moment, Yun Youzi finally prepared the Flawless Orb.</p><p>"Go!"</p><p>With Yun Youzi's spoken command, the Flawless Orb spun rapidly, its rays of light pulsating dramatically. It transformed into a spear and shot out with blinding speed.</p><p>The beam of light was stunning.</p><p>The Serpent King sensed the danger and let out a piercing cry. Abandoning its attack, it turned and fled.</p><p>Its speed was remarkable, like a thin black thread darting toward its lair. But the spear was even faster, pursuing the Serpent King like a meteor, catching up in an instant.</p><p>'Bang!'</p><p>The spear pierced the Serpent King's body.</p><p>A chilling cry filled the air.</p><p>Blood scattered through the sky.</p><p>However, a great demon of the late Nascent Soul stage was not to be trifled with.</p><p>At the last possible moment, the Serpent King's wings surged with black energy, and its silhouette distorted ominously. It somehow managed to escape the Flawless Orb's trajectory, preventing a fatal blow.</p><p>The Serpent King survived the attack, but its wound was severe.</p><p>Silenced by its own desperate cry, the Serpent King dragged its broken body behind the barrier, its arrogance shattered.</p><p>Just then, an idea occurred to Qin Sang, and he urgently told Yun Youzi, "Master! We must save someone!"</p><p>Yun Youzi immediately understood Qin Sang's intent and mustered the Flawless Orb's remaining power. With a flick of his wrist, the Flawless Orb paused briefly to readjust the spear's trajectory, aiming it towards the red mist.</p><p>Their target was not Ge Yuan.</p><p>Shangguan Lifeng could be saved!</p><p>Luo Xingnan was still at large, and he could not be trusted.</p><p>Yun Youzi had depleted all his energy to control the Flawless Orb, rendering him powerless. The Jade Ruyi talisman was on the verge of shattering. Only Qin Sang and the White Robed Scholar remained.</p><p>Despite surviving the Serpent King and the Horned Serpents, they were far from safe.</p><p>The enemy of their enemy is their friend.</p><p>Luo Xingnan was their enemy, so they would save their friend!</p><p>The Horned Serpent King had witnessed the Flawless Orb's destructive power firsthand and knew the potency of its spear attack. As the spear approached, they let out fearful cries and scattered in panic.</p><p>The red mist shimmered, providing Shangguan Lifeng a chance to escape. However, Ge Yuan remained unaccounted for.</p><p>The time since Luo Xingnan had used them as shields had been relatively short, but the Horned Serpents were several times stronger than them. Ge Yuan had likely been devoured, while Shangguan Lifeng himself was in dire straits.</p><p>His left arm had been torn off at the shoulder, not bitten off, but violently ripped away. There were clear lacerations from a tail hook on the stump, and the blood flowing from the wound was pitch-black. Fortunately, Shangguan Lifeng was aware of the Horned Serpents' deadly venom, and he had acted quickly to seal off his meridians, preventing the poison from reaching his internal organs. Otherwise, even a deity would have been powerless to save him.</p><p>He was covered in wounds. His spiritual sea was exhausted. He had only managed to survive this long thanks to his indomitable spirit and a trusty saber.</p><p>Having severely wounded the Serpent King and deterred the Horned Serpents, the Flawless Orb's power was nearing its end.</p><p>Yun Youzi recalled the Flawless Orb, his body suddenly swaying and starting to fall.</p><p>With lightning-fast reflexes, Qin Sang caught Yun Youzi, noticing his exceptionally feeble breath, as if he lacked the strength to even speak. Not daring to scrutinize Yun Youzi's condition further, Qin Sang swiftly hoisted him onto his back and shot towards the exit like a bolt of light.</p><p>Before becoming incapacitated, Yun Youzi had entrusted the Spirit Bamboo Skiff to Qin Sang. However, Qin Sang had made an attempt to use it earlier and discovered that without Yun Youzi's guidance, his use of the Spirit Bamboo Skiff significantly drained his spiritual power—an expenditure comparable to that of the Nine Dragons Thunderbolt Talisman.</p><p>It seemed that he was not the master of the Spirit Bamboo Skiff, hence the unusual toll it exacted.</p><p>Regardless, Yun Youzi's achievements had been remarkable. He had gained them ample time and space, and they could escape without resorting to the Spirit Bamboo Skiff.</p><p>As they flew past Shangguan Lifeng, Qin Sang grabbed him, catching a glimpse of Ge Yuan's storage bag and pocketing it on the fly.</p><p>"Thank you, Daoist…"</p><p>Shangguan Lifeng's voice was faint, his gratitude strained.</p><p>Luo Xingnan had been observing the entire scene from the cave entrance. He did not leave immediately but stared at Qin Sang's group with an unreadable expression, as if contemplating something.</p><p>Qin Sang looked coldly at Luo Xingnan as he flew his sword along with the two wounded, his expression grave and unchanging.</p><p>Their gazes met in midair.</p><p>By this time, the hook snakes had regained their senses and were once again in pursuit, their voices filled with shame and anger.</p><p>Luo Xingnan hesitated for a moment, took a deep look at Qin Sang, turned, and entered the cave, leaving.</p><p>Flickering, Qin Sang charged into the cave. Having researched the restrictions as they entered, they knew the method to open it.</p><p>Whoosh…</p><p>Outside the main hall, the rain poured down heavily.</p><p>Inside the main hall, nothing had changed since they first arrived.</p><p>At that time, there were seven of them, just from Yu Kong's side. Later, they were joined by Luo Xingnan and Sheng Yuanzi, increasing their numbers.</p><p>Now, only five of them had made it out alive, and two of them were severely wounded, almost unable to fight.</p><p>Less than an hour had passed, but it felt like a lifetime.</p><p>In the ruined main hall, the two sides faced each other.</p><p>Luo Xingnan blocked the main entrance of the ancient hall, half of his body hidden in the shadows.</p><p>Shangguan Lifeng fell to the ground, covered in blood. He did not bother to clean himself up, choosing instead to recover from his injuries. Yun Youzi lay on Qin Sang's back, seemingly asleep. It was unclear how he might recover, but it seemed that it would not be possible for the time being.</p><p>Qin Sang and the White Clothed Scholar stood side by side.</p><p>“Magical treasures and mysterious Spirit Pearls, this old man has truly broadened his horizons today. I suppose your identities are not so simple?” Luo Xingnan's eyes gleamed with amusement as he sized up Qin Sang.</p><p>“What are you trying to do by blocking the entrance?”</p><p>Qin Sang spoke coldly, a hint of sarcasm in his voice. “If I recall correctly, there was also a Nascent Soul realm senior who entered this place. You've already obtained a treasure, yet you still refuse to leave. Do you perhaps think you have too much of the 1000-year Spirit Medicine on you, and want to share it with that senior?”</p><p>Luo Xingnan snorted coldly, his eyes flashing with a cold light, but he did not dare to make any further moves.</p><p>The 1000-year Spirit Medicine would even tempt a Nascent Soul realm cultivator.</p><p>He did not have confidence in his ability to defeat Qin Sang instantly. If the commotion of battle were to alert the others, revealing their secret, neither side would end well.</p><p>The rain continued to pour down even harder.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced outside the main hall.</p><p>He detected that the spiritual energy in the air was far more disordered than when they had first arrived, indicating that the low point of the protective array's cycle was almost over.</p><p>Luo Xingnan opened his mouth, just as he was about to speak.</p><p>Suddenly, a loud thud echoed through the empty main hall.</p><p>Everyone was startled, and they all looked towards the position of the mud sculpture's hand. Rainbow colors flickered there, and waves of energy emanated from it.</p>
