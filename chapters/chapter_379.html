<h1>Chapter 372: Ghost Head Wasps</h1><p>“How many people?” Wandering Scholar asked.</p><p>Qin Sang replied, “Only one so far.”</p><p>Wandering Scholar pondered, “We’ve been careful in the market and haven't provoked any enemies. This shouldn't be directed at us. Could it be someone else's enemy?”</p><p>“Could Kong Xin have inadvertently leaked the news about the Cold Gold Ore Heart?” Qin Sang glanced at Kong Xin’s back. He was diligently leading the way, now remarkably obedient.</p><p>As for the woman in red and the others, their behavior hadn’t been unusual. Neither Qin Sang nor Wandering Scholar had noticed anyone leaving marks or sending messages.</p><p>“Hard to say!” Wandering Scholar mused. “I'll watch the rear, Qin Sang, you keep an eye on Kong Xin and the others. If it has nothing to do with us, it's best if we remain undisturbed. If things change, we'll either capture their leader first or escape with the Spirit Bamboo Flying Boat. Ideally, we'll take Kong Xin with us. The Boundless Valley is complex and ever-changing, far too intricate to explain in a few words. We still need Kong Xin to guide us...”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, “Senior, please buy me some time. As long as I can deploy my Talisman Treasure, I won't fear any demons or monsters.”</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>……</p><p>The tunnel twisted and turned, gradually ascending after some distance. Qin Sang left several warning wards along the way, none of which were triggered.</p><p>After a full hour, the tunnel exit finally appeared ahead.</p><p>Having confirmed the safety outside, the group filed out, finally emerging from the oppressive tunnel.</p><p>The cave exit was halfway up the mountain. The Ghost Nest was directly above. Holding their breath, they followed Kong Xin as they walked through the mountains.</p><p>Before they reached the foot of the mountain, Kong Xin suddenly stopped, turned to the old man and his apprentice, pointed to the left, and whispered, “The spirit herbs you need grow on the cliff over there. I’ll take you there now. The rest of you can stay here and recover. I'll be back soon.”</p><p>Looking in the direction Kong Xin pointed, they could only see a bloody haze.</p><p>It was right beneath the Ghost Nest, where the blood miasma churned and ghostly wails echoed. It was clearly not a hospitable place.</p><p>Neither the woman in red nor the others had any intention of risking themselves for others. Just as they were about to agree, Qin Sang suddenly spoke, “This place is right on the edge of the Ghost Nest. If Daoist Kong Xin encounters danger on his way back alone, I'm afraid we won't be able to rescue him in time. It’s better if we go together so we can look out for each other. What do you two think?”</p><p>Qin Sang's suggestion wasn’t out of concern for the old man and his apprentice. He wanted to use this as an excuse to verify something.  If Kong Xin was lying, and there were no spirit herbs, then something was definitely wrong with Kong Xin.</p><p>Wandering Scholar immediately guessed Qin Sang’s intention.</p><p>The woman in red and the cultivator surnamed Bao exchanged glances. After a moment of thought, they agreed.</p><p>Cultivator Bao waved his fan and said to the master and apprentice, seemingly jokingly, “You’re not afraid we’ll steal the spirit herbs, are you?”</p><p>The old man and his apprentice looked at each other. The old man chuckled, “The spirit herb I need is the Blood Poison Flower. It’s not of high quality, just unique in its properties.  It can cure my apprentice's illness, but has no other use. I doubt it would catch your eye. I’d be grateful for your escort.”</p><p>Having reached a consensus, they changed direction and traversed the entire mountain without incident. Soon, they reached a dead end, facing a bottomless abyss.</p><p>From the abyss, in addition to the howls of ghosts, came a strange buzzing sound.</p><p>Kong Xin raised his hand and pointed to the cliff on the opposite side of the abyss, “Look, the Blood Poison Flower is right there.”</p><p>They strained their eyes and saw a crevice in the cliff on the other side.  Indeed, a blood-red flower the size of a silver platter grew within – the Blood Poison Flower the master and apprentice sought.</p><p>Strangely, on the cliff face below the Blood Poison Flower, hung a dozen enormous black spheres.</p><p>When they saw what the spheres were, everyone gasped.</p><p>They were wasp nests!</p><p>The nests were jet black. Even more terrifying were the black wasps that occasionally flew out – each one the size of a human fist!</p><p>The buzzing sound they heard earlier was the sound of these wasps in flight.</p><p>The wasps were ferocious, with three pairs of blood-red wings.  Their stingers, barbed and gleaming with a dark green sheen, were undoubtedly venomous.</p><p>If there were only one, it would be manageable. But within these nests were thousands, if not tens of thousands, of wasps.</p><p>Moreover, judging by the spiritual energy fluctuations from their wings, these were no ordinary wasps. They had likely mutated after living in the blood miasma for countless years.</p><p>Even Foundation Establishment cultivators would likely meet a grim end if surrounded by these wasps.</p><p>“Are you planning to harvest the Blood Poison Flower while facing these wasps?” Cultivator Bao’s scalp tingled as he looked at the swarming wasps.  A look of terror flickered in his eyes as he instinctively took a few steps back, afraid of being noticed by the wasps.</p><p>The master and apprentice hadn't expected so many strange wasps. Their faces darkened.</p><p>The old man resolutely stated, "I've searched far and wide for years to find this Blood Poison Flower.  I must try, no matter the cost."</p><p>Kong Xin said gravely, “As agreed, my task is complete once I bring you here. Harvesting the Blood Poison Flower is your own responsibility.  As for the other half of the payment…”</p><p>The old man tossed Kong Xin a storage pouch and bowed, “Thank you, Daoist friend.”</p><p>Kong Xin checked the pouch and a satisfied smile spread across his face. “These wasps are not to be trifled with. Be extremely careful.  We must continue deeper into the Boundless Valley, so we won’t accompany you.”</p><p>Just then, Qin Sang, who had remained silent, suddenly flashed to the edge of the abyss. After a moment of contemplation, he took out his Binding Cord.</p><p>He brushed his hand over the cord, concealing its glow, then flicked it. The Binding Cord silently drifted towards the wasp nests.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang’s actions, the others backed away, fearing they’d be caught in the crossfire.</p><p>Only Wandering Scholar stood behind Qin Sang, his magical tool at the ready for a rescue.</p><p>Everyone was curious about the wasps, but none wanted to test their might. Since Qin Sang was willing to be the guinea pig, including the old man, no one stopped him.</p><p>Qin Sang paid no mind to their thoughts. His goal was simply to capture a few wasps.</p><p>If he wasn't mistaken, these wasps were a rare insect known as Ghost Head Wasps.</p><p>Old Man Di Que's belongings included a jade slip left behind by a Core Formation cultivator of the Spirit Controlling Sect. This jade slip contained records of Ghost Head Wasps, described as a rare and unique insect.</p><p>However, these wasps had some differences from the ones described in the jade slip. The most obvious difference was the three pairs of blood-red wings. True Ghost Head Wasps had transparent wings.</p><p>The wasps’ size was also larger than the Ghost Head Wasps.</p><p>Since obtaining the jade slip, this was the first time Qin Sang had encountered this type of insect.</p><p>He didn't have the time or resources like Old Man Di Que to scour the cultivation world for rare insects, but now that he'd encountered them, he naturally wouldn't miss this opportunity.</p>
