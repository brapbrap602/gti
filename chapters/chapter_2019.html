<h1>Chapter 2010: Jade Gate Pass</h1><p>‘Pitter-patter! Pitter-patter!’</p><p>Walking on the lotus leaves without using magical power felt like strolling across a floating bridge.</p><p>The lotus leaves swayed gently, fish swam in the water below, and the surrounding mist hung heavy, as if in a dream.</p><p>Many cultivators, just like mortals, held oiled paper umbrellas, ambling between the lotus leaves and arched bridges, their expressions relaxed, reveling in the unique charm of Lotus City.</p><p>‘Rumble…’</p><p>Thunder occasionally rumbled from the dark clouds, the sound muffled, as if from a great distance. It was said that the rain clouds above Lotus City lingered year-round, yet lightning was rare.</p><p>Qin Sang and Jian Nu, after some inquiries, gained a general understanding of the city’s layout.</p><p>Since Lotus City’s buildings were all built on lotus leaves, often a single leaf housed a shop, its sign carved on the lotus flower beside it.</p><p>No Immortal City lacked places to rent cave dwellings. The area with the richest spiritual energy in Lotus City was in the East District, where many reclusive experts supposedly resided, truly embodying the principle of “great hermits dwelling in the marketplace.”</p><p>After discussing, Qin Sang and Jian Nu decided to find an inconspicuous, remote location and purchase a courtyard.</p><p>Soon, they arrived at the western side of Lotus City, almost at the edge, and bought a courtyard through a real estate agency, paying with spirit stones.</p><p>The courtyard was built on a gigantic lotus leaf tens of thousands of zhang across. Small courtyards were crammed together, and the spiritual energy here was the thinnest in Lotus City. However, Qin Sang intended to use this as a future contact point, not a permanent residence, so the density of spiritual energy didn't matter much.</p><p>“Fellow Daoist, after contacting Senior Tian Yue, you can wait for me here. If all goes well, I will come to meet you.  Should any unforeseen circumstances arise, forcing me to flee beyond the Great Zhou, I might also send news here, seeking your assistance,” Qin Sang said.</p><p>Jian Nu knew his cultivation level couldn't fend off powerful enemies for Qin Sang; he could at most help gather necessary items.  He nodded gravely, “Take care, True Man!”</p><p>“Take care! Until we meet again!”</p><p>Qin Sang set up a spirit array, handed Jian Nu a jade talisman, and personally escorted him out of the city.</p><p>Jian Nu bowed slightly to Qin Sang, concealed his aura, and silently vanished into the depths of the rainy curtain.</p><p>After Jian Nu left, Qin Sang began his preparations in earnest. He stayed in Lotus City for a while longer, gathering information about the terrain and situation in Dui State, and combined this with the purchased cartographic maps to form a general impression of Dui State.</p><p>Unlike Gen State, Lotus City, the capital of Dui State, wasn't located in the center.</p><p>Dui State occupied only a part of the Great Swamp.  North of Dui State, beyond the borders of the Great Zhou, lay a region even more chaotic and dangerous than the South Sea.  Situated between the Savage Wilds and the Great Zhou, it was a mixed settlement of humans and other races, where demons, ghosts, and monsters ran rampant.  Order was absent, and powerful clans and factions were scattered throughout.</p><p>Further north lay the Savage Wilds. Legend had it that after the collapse of the Demon Court, the demon race, weakened, was driven into the Savage Wilds by the Jade Emperor.</p><p>However, present-day humans knew very little about the Savage Wilds, and it was said to be even vaster than the eight Celestial States. Beyond the Prosperous Jade Gate, the northern part of the Witch Clan’s territory was also part of the Savage Wilds, extending even further west.</p><p>The Savage Wilds was a broad term.  In the eyes of humans, any land not conquered by them was considered uncivilized wilderness and could be deemed part of the Savage Wilds. The vast world was immense, and even the eight Celestial States weren't truly connected.</p><p>What had become of the demon race? Had they rebuilt the Demon Court? Was the bulk of the demon race in the north of the Great Zhou, poised to launch a southern counterattack?</p><p>Qin Sang attempted to gather information about these matters, planning his escape route, but only obtained some dubious rumors, none credible.  However, the location of Lotus City, Dui State’s capital, near the northern border of Dui State, clearly indicated a defensive posture against the north.</p><p>To reach the Prosperous Jade Gate from Lotus City, one had to travel northwest, eventually arriving at a place called 'Jade Gate Pass,' while the Prosperous Jade Gate itself lay outside of Dui State.</p><p>As its name suggested, Jade Gate Pass was the last fortress city leading to the Prosperous Jade Gate.  A long distance still separated Jade Gate Pass and the Prosperous Jade Gate, but there were no Immortal Cities in between, only settlements and towns spontaneously formed by cultivators traveling between the two, often existing for a few decades or centuries before being buried by the wind and sand. Jade Gate Pass, however, had existed since ancient times.</p><p>It was said that the Great Swamp of Dui State extended all the way to the Witch Clan’s territory, encompassing the Prosperous Jade Gate within it. Only the terrain near the Prosperous Jade Gate was different. Perhaps influenced by the ancient battlefield, this area was covered in wind and sand, a desolate sight.</p><p>Qin Sang organized the information he had gathered, confirmed his route, and left Lotus City via a Grand Teleportation Formation.</p><p>…</p><p>‘Crack! Sizzle!’</p><p>Dark clouds hung low.</p><p>Wind and rain raged.</p><p>A fierce wind whipped the torrential rain, relentlessly battering the swamp below. Amidst the thunder and lightning, a red bolt of lightning pierced through the clouds and wind.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>A thunderclap illuminated the surroundings, revealing the red lightning to be a spirit hawk with crimson plumage.</p><p>The spirit hawk’s gaze was sharp, its appearance noble, its wingspan exceeding a hundred zhang. Yet, it was as fast as a thunderbolt, the wind and rain unable to hinder its forward momentum.</p><p>A figure could be faintly seen seated on the spirit hawk's back.</p><p>This person was Qin Sang.  After leaving Lotus City and transferring several times, he was now on the final leg of his journey to Jade Gate Pass.  For reasons unknown to Qin Sang, Jade Gate Pass had no Grand Teleportation Formation connecting it to the outside world.</p><p>In Dui State, the dominant force in the transportation business wasn't Radiant Gold City, but a faction called the Beast Taming Hall. Qin Sang hired a spirit hawk from the Beast Taming Hall to travel to Jade Gate Pass.</p><p>“Once we’re past Jade Gate Pass, can I continue to hire your services?”</p><p>Qin Sang asked, communicating directly with the spirit hawk.</p><p>“I must disappoint you, honored guest.  Our Beast Taming Hall doesn't conduct business beyond Jade Gate Pass,” the spirit hawk replied in a crisp voice, sounding like an eight or nine-year-old child.</p><p>“Oh?” Qin Sang questioned. “Why is that?  There must be quite a few cultivators passing through the gate, right?”</p><p>“In response to honored guest, we also don't wish to forgo business beyond the gate. However, the factions within Dui State all give us some face, and we have quite a few allies even in the north of Dui State.  But beyond the gate, it’s different…”</p><p>The spirit hawk sighed.  “Many of those who dare venture into the Prosperous Jade Gate to seek treasures are desperate individuals, acting without restraint.  Moreover, the area beyond the gate is desolate.  If they commit evil deeds, they can simply hide within the Prosperous Jade Gate, making it impossible to track them down.  It’s said that attempts were made in the past, resulting in the loss of many seniors… Honored guest, if you venture beyond the gate, please be careful.”</p><p>Qin Sang grunted in acknowledgement, studying the back of the spirit hawk’s head.  Suddenly, he said, “You’re not a true demon, are you?”</p><p>This spirit hawk he hired from the Beast Taming Hall had no master accompanying it. Qin Sang had felt something odd about its aura from the moment he saw it, unlike that of a transformed demon beast.  As they traveled, he grew more certain of his suspicion.</p><p>“Honored guest is truly perceptive!”</p><p>The spirit hawk replied frankly.  “You can also consider this one a spirit hawk.  This is the unique beast control method of our Beast Taming Hall. Master and spirit beast cultivate the Great Dao together.  This spirit hawk is this one’s natal spirit beast, and this one’s nascent soul is currently merging with the spirit hawk’s spirit essence.  Traveling back and forth like this further strengthens the bond between us.”</p><p>How could the cultivation methods of these transportation businesses be so strange? The Beast Taming Hall was like this, and so was Radiant Gold City.</p><p>Qin Sang mused inwardly.</p><p>Under the dark clouds, the light was dim.  After traveling through the thunder and lightning all night, at dawn the next day, Qin Sang suddenly saw brilliant morning glow appear on the horizon.</p><p>Yet, this 'morning glow' appeared in the west.</p><p>At the edge of the dark clouds, the radiant light suddenly burst forth, multicolored and dazzling, instantly illuminating heaven and earth.</p><p>Upon closer inspection, it became clear that this wasn't morning glow, but fierce wind and sand.  The wind and sand roared, blocking the dark clouds, and sunlight refracted through them, creating a spectrum of colors.</p><p>Between the wind and sand and the dark clouds, the outline of a city emerged.</p><p>Along the way, the Immortal Cities Qin Sang had seen in Dui State were all similar to Lotus City, quite elegant.</p><p>The Immortal City before him, however, was of a completely different style, resembling a majestic pass in a vast desert, grand and rugged!</p><p>“Honored guest, we've arrived at Jade Gate Pass!”</p><p>The spirit hawk opened its beak and spat out a red beam of light towards Jade Gate Pass.  Immediately, faint ripples appeared in the void, as if a gateway had opened.  The spirit hawk flew directly into the city, unhindered, and no guards came to question them.</p><p>As if reaching the edge of the swamp, inside and outside Jade Gate Pass were two different worlds. Inside the pass was a humid swamp; outside, the wind and sand were boundless.</p><p>The buildings of Jade Gate Pass resembled those of the mortal world, mostly constructed of earth and stone.  The city walls facing outwards were extremely thick, and guards filled with a chilling aura patrolled the battlements.  The power of the city's protective formation fluctuated subtly, seemingly constantly vigilant against something.</p><p>Qin Sang noticed that many people on the streets were hurrying, likely adventurers drawn to the Prosperous Jade Gate, not original residents.</p><p>The western city gate was wide open, and a stream of people flowed continuously.</p><p>The Five Elements Alliance also had a branch here. Qin Sang inquired about its location and went directly there, presenting his token.</p><p>Upon seeing the Elder’s token, a Deacon surnamed Ruan immediately led Qin Sang to the back hall and bowed respectfully. “Greetings, Elder Qin!”</p><p>Deacon Ruan appeared at ease in Qin Sang's presence, evidently not his first time receiving an Alliance Elder.</p><p>“Which Elder is stationed here?”</p><p>Qin Sang asked, glancing around.</p><p>The Five Elements Alliance wouldn't dispatch an Elder to every branch, but a location as important as Jade Gate Pass certainly had one stationed here.</p><p>“In reply to Elder Qin, Elder Hong is in charge of this branch.  However, Elder Hong is currently away on business and not in the city.”</p><p>Deacon Ruan didn't explain the nature of the business, and Qin Sang didn't press further.  He said, “You should have a catalog of the spiritual materials produced in the Prosperous Jade Gate, correct?  Bring it for Qin to peruse.”</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>Deacon Ruan wasn't surprised by this request.  Most people who came to Jade Gate Pass were interested in the Prosperous Jade Gate.</p><p>Several jade slips were quickly brought forth, containing the accumulated knowledge of the Five Elements Alliance over many years. Even within the Alliance, only Elders and above were qualified to access them.</p><p>The Prosperous Jade Gate was an ancient battlefield that had existed since time immemorial.  Within it were divine abilities left behind by powerful figures, shattered Small Thousand Worlds, and countless wondrous locations that produced numerous rare and unique heavenly and earthly treasures.</p><p>Legends of cultivators obtaining some supreme treasure or ancient inheritance within the Prosperous Jade Gate, rising to prominence in a single bound, were often circulated here.  Therefore, despite knowing the dangers, countless people continued to flock to it.</p><p>The Five Elements Alliance had been collecting information for a long time, recording any treasure originating from the Prosperous Jade Gate. Some entries were just rumors, while others detailed the circumstances, even specifying the possible locations where such spiritual materials could be found.</p><p>Qin Sang knew that a Guest Elder couldn't possibly see all the information, but even this much was invaluable.</p><p>“Earth Essence Jade Rose Vine, only this much information?”</p><p>Qin Sang activated the contents of a jade slip, pointing to several records, frowning.</p><p>The Earth Essence Jade Rose Vine was a rare heavenly and earthly treasure.  It appeared five times in the records, the earliest dating back seven thousand years, the most recent only thirty years ago.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't actually need the Earth Essence Jade Rose Vine. He was looking for a pretext to enter the Prosperous Jade Gate, a cover for his true purpose.</p><p>Deacon Ruan thought to himself that this Elder Qin had come for the Earth Essence Jade Rose Vine.  “Reporting to Elder Qin, this record was written by this junior.  Thirty years ago, rumors spread within the city that someone brought out a section of the vine, but they quickly vanished without a trace. This junior couldn't obtain any concrete information. Because there were four previous records of the vine's appearance, which were relatively credible, this junior recorded this instance.”</p><p>“So, no one currently knows the most likely location of the Earth Essence Jade Rose Vine within the Prosperous Jade Gate?” Qin Sang asked.</p><p>Deacon Ruan nodded in agreement. “This junior isn't boasting, but he's considered relatively well-informed within the city.  Others likely wouldn't be able to find out anything either.  If Elder Qin requires this item, this junior will immediately issue a reward.  A generous reward will surely attract brave individuals…”</p><p>“Hmph! What do you know! The Earth Essence Jade Rose Vine that this old man needs must be harvested using this old man's special gathering technique.  Otherwise, its potency will be diminished, rendering it useless,” Qin Sang rebuked coldly.</p><p>“This… This junior's limited knowledge almost caused Elder Qin great trouble.  Please punish this junior,” Deacon Ruan said, filled with fear and respect.</p><p>“It’s fine, you meant well. You can issue the reward.  This old man needs information on the location where the Earth Essence Jade Rose Vine grows. In addition to that, I’ll also purchase these few spiritual materials at a premium, the more the better.  As long as the treasures are of sufficient quality, this old man can even personally refine a spirit treasure tailored to their needs!” Qin Sang waved his hand dismissively.</p><p>Hearing this, Deacon Ruan knew that this matter would definitely cause quite a stir in Jade Gate Pass.</p><p>A Guest Elder of the Five Elements Alliance personally refining a custom-made spirit treasure? Even Void Refinement cultivators would be tempted.</p><p>Qin Sang called out to Deacon Ruan, who was about to take his leave. “Also, find some people for this old man, preferably those capable of escorting this old man to the Prosperous Jade Gate and familiar with its interior, to assist this old man in searching for spiritual materials.”</p><p>Unexpectedly, Deacon Ruan’s expression turned troubled.  “This…”</p><p>“What? Are there no factions in the city that specialize in this kind of work?” Qin Sang frowned.</p><p>“There are! There are! It’s just that the situation is unique at the moment.  Those truly familiar with the Prosperous Jade Gate are highly sought after and have mostly been hired at a high price. I wonder if Elder Qin has heard…”</p><p>Deacon Ruan glanced westward.  “News of ancient sword cultivators' Sword Pavilions appearing within the Prosperous Jade Gate has been circulating for many years.  Sword Pavilions are special training grounds built by ancient sword cultivators to hone their sword intent and sword heart, and they may contain inheritances left by them.  As fragments have been discovered, confirming the existence of genuine ancient Sword Pavilions, the commotion has intensified.  Over time, rumors have even spread that a special Sword Pavilion is hidden within the Prosperous Jade Gate, the dojo of the foremost ancient sword cultivator, the king of sword cultivators, the supreme Sword Sovereign, the Purple Star Sword Sovereign’s Purple Star Palace.  While its authenticity is uncertain, the number of people drawn to Jade Gate Pass has increased drastically…”</p><p>Qin Sang pondered.  Fragments of some Sword Pavilions had emerged.</p><p>Five were known to exist within the Storm Realm: Purple Star, Heavenly Fellow, Heavenly Minister, Seven Kills, and the unnamed Sword Pavilion in the Western Lands. He wondered if any of them had already been unearthed.</p>
