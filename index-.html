        Chapter 1385: Coordinates<span hidden="" class="calibre1"> | </span>
      </h1>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Just as he was about to say something, Han Xiao suddenly realized that a
        set of coordinates had appeared in his mind. It was a message from
        Tyrsius.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Han Xiao looked at Tyrsius in doubt.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">"What coordinates did you give me?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Tyrsius shook his head and sighed.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "My hometown is my lingering obsession. Although I was born on Planet
        Cree, I left very early. When I was young, I surpassed all my
        predecessors, broke all records, and became the strongest person in the
        entire civilization. My civilization could no longer provide me with any
        help. To pursue a higher level of individual strength, I left the galaxy
        alone. This journey lasted countless years.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        There were no worthy opponents in my hometown. I tried to find someone
        of my standard in the entire universe, hoping to learn from them. In my
        life as a wanderer, I spent most of my time with the desolate universe.
        I rarely met people, but I had seen strong and weak civilizations come
        and go. I would only make an appearance when I met powerful Supers,
        other than that, I would not interfere with the normal development of
        these civilizations. During that time, I only focused on the road ahead
        of me and wanted to become stronger and stronger. Even till the day I
        died, I did not return to my hometown even once.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        I've been dead for many years and have been trapped here. I did not have
        any perception of the outside world and have long accepted reality.
        However, the only thing I can't let go of is my hometown. I have nothing
        to do here and the only thing I can comfort myself with is the
        incomplete memories of the past. It's just that my initial firm pursuit
        of a higher level and the wonderful experience of wandering the universe
        has become fainter, yet, the childhood times spent in my hometown have
        become more and more clear.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Back then, I could have chosen to stay and help build my hometown, but I
        was unwilling to do so. I wandered for the sake of a higher goal. But
        now, I miss my hometown more and more. So many years have passed, and I
        don't know how my hometown is now. You have inherited my Beyonder's
        Vestige, so if it's convenient for you, I request you to go over and
        take a look for me. The coordinates I gave you are the location of
        Planet Cree. I hope you can take care of them for my sake."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After hearing his explanation, Han Xiao raised his brows with a strange
        expression. "Don't you know that it's best not to allow foreigners to
        come into contact with other civilizations? You don't know anything
        about me. Aren't you afraid that I'll bring people to invade if you give
        me the coordinates of your hometown?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Tyrsius smiled faintly.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "You're the only person who has come in all these years. I'm about to
        die, so who else can I give it to if not you? Let's take the risk.
        There's nothing guaranteed in this world. Otherwise, I wouldn't have
        fought against my sense of danger to pursue a higher level and end up
        dying… Also, I don't think you're an invader."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Making such a conclusion after only seeing me once is too hasty." Han
        Xiao shook his head. "I can help you take a look, but I won't promise
        anything. Also, I don't think a powerful Universal Civilization needs my
        care."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "You're mistaken. My civilization isn't particularly developed."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Tyrus sighed.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "You can withstand the impact of the cosmic assimilation, and I can feel
        how strong you are. On the other hand, I'm sure you think I'm very
        strong, but in fact, when I left my hometown, I was far from this state.
        At that time, it was very difficult for me to destroy a planet, and all
        my strength came from constantly breaking through while wandering… The
        experience I accumulated should have been brought back to my hometown,
        giving birth to more experts, but unfortunately, I died, and all these
        plans came to an end."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Hearing this, Han Xiao started to calculate.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        It sounded like when Tyrsius first started wandering, his strength
        should have been between a high Calamity Grade and an ordinary Beyond
        Grade A. The latter was more likely, and he had ascended to the peak of
        the Beyond Grade A realm step by step during his long and lonely
        journey. He had felt the existence of a higher level, and he had reached
        this step without any experience.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Looking at it this way, Tyrsius is also an extremely talented
        individual, probably not inferior to me… ahem, not inferior to all the
        genius Supers in the history of the three Universal Civilizations.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        If what the other party said was true, then their civilization should be
        like a remote village, not as strong as he had imagined. However, a
        genius had appeared there, just like how Planet Aquamarine had produced
        him.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        If Tyrsius had managed to return to his hometown with his experience and
        insights, there might have been another civilization with a relatively
        advanced individual strength in the universe.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Thinking about it this way, the Supers born in the three Universal
        Civilizations were lucky. There were many strong people here, and there
        were many opponents that they could exchange pointers with. As for a
        small civilization like Tyrsius', if they wanted to find opponents, they
        could only travel far away and be a lonely Pathfinder. While he was
        thinking, the interface suddenly pinged.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        (You have triggered the mission: Shadow of the Past!)
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        [Mission Introduction: In order to explore the path ahead, Tyrsius
        wandered the universe alone and never returned to his hometown. He wants
        you to take a look on his behalf.) [Mission Requirements: Arrive at
        Planet Cree]
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        [Reward: 2,000,000,000 Experience, 1 Character Summon Card)
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"I got a Mission…"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Han Xiao's heart skipped a beat.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He did not know if his nature was so open and sincere, or if he felt
        liberated, or if he had special feelings for his successor.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Tyrsius' figure was getting fainter and fainter, almost disappearing. He
        did not mind and only smiled.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "It seems like my time is almost up. After so many years of loneliness,
        I'm satisfied to have someone to talk to at the end of my journey…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao looked at him muttering to himself. Although it was an
        unexpected encounter, this first time was also the last. Originally,
        Tyrsius' wandering knowledge was a precious channel to understand more
        unknown civilizations, but there was not enough time.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, at this moment, Tyrsius seemed to have thought of something,
        before whispering,
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "By the way, let me give you a piece of advice. If you meet a
        civilization called the World Tree one day, you'd better run as far as
        you can…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao was stunned, his face changing rapidly. However, before he
        could ask about the details, Tyrsius' figure completely disappeared,
        leaving only a faint sigh. "I've never left anything for the
        civilization in my life. What a failure…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The blue figure in front of Han Xiao turned into light particles and
        disappeared.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At the same time, the mental burden that was getting weaker and weaker
        finally stopped.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The white alternate space in front of him suddenly collapsed, and Han
        Xiao was left in a daze. He realized that his vision had returned to the
        main material universe, and he was still there, having not moved at all.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Beyonder's Vestige had already fused into his body and was fully
        assimilated, but it did not have any further reaction with him. Even
        though Han Xiao had gotten the Beyonder's Vestige, he did not feel too
        excited about that, only secretly feeling a headache.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "To stop speaking halfway at the most crucial point, you really need to
        be beaten up. You should have told me about the World Tree Civilization
        earlier…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao was resigned, he had no choice and could only complain.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After all, Tyrsius did not know that they were fighting the World Tree
        Civilization. If not for the other party mentioning it, he would not
        have known that Tyrsius had met the World Tree Civilization before.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "It sounds like this guy has seen the aggressiveness of the World Tree.
        Maybe they have crossed paths before. Would the World Tree still
        remember this guy?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Han Xiao pondered.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Very soon, he shook his head and put this matter aside for the time
        being. He turned around to study the Beyonder's Vestige in his body.
        This was his main goal.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After absorbing the Beyonder's Vestige, his strength did not change at
        all. He could only sense its existence at any time as if it was simply
        absorbed by his body. This vestige should only be activated during the
        Promotion and become a catalyst for his Promotion. He roughly guessed
        that regardless of whether the Promotion succeeded or not, the
        Beyonder's Vestige would be consumed. This was a one-time use item.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "The higher levels require the skeletons of the predecessors… Tsk, turn
        into a salary and burn yourself to benefit the future generations. No
        matter what, I owe you a favor."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Han Xiao exhaled.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Although he was dead, Han Xiao still remembered this favor. The next
        time he entered the Sanctum, he planned to see if he could revive this
        guy, but the chances were very low.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As someone who left a Beyonder's Vestige, Han Xiao did not know if he
        had left an Information Form like the two sisters in the past. Even if
        he died now, he might not be able to benefit from the Sanctum Revival.
        Han Xiao only planned to do his best.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This time, Han Xiao suddenly thought of something and smiled. "Speaking
        of which, in the explored universe, this is the only piece of the
        Beyonder's Vestige that was the easiest to obtain. If Wuornos reaches
        this level one day, he can only search for other Beyonder's Vestiges."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Han Xiao was amused.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Since Wuornos was so willing to help him advance, he might have intended
        to use him as a guinea pig to explore the path, but he did not know that
        the only advanced material in the area was lost to him. Perhaps Wuornos
        did not have a notification on the interface, so he could not dig out
        the sensing of the Beyonder's Vestige, or maybe he did not enter the
        critical state and was still stuck on the mission. Anyway, he had been
        practically camping below a treasure unawares. In the end, he lost that
        treasure to Han Xiao instead.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Feeling the Beyonder's Vestige in his body, Han Xiao smiled. Although he
        was a little surprised, he still managed to obtain a Vestige in the end.
        It went better than he had expected. It was not in vain that he had
        gathered so many mascots in the army.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This way, out of the three advancement requirements, he would only have
        to find four pretty boys to help him.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao's nerves finally relaxed. He then started to think about the
        coordinates of Planet Cree sent by Tyrsius.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "There will definitely be risks if I rashly come into contact with an
        unknown civilization. Although Tyrsius said that his civilization isn't
        strong, that's all in the past. Now that so many years have passed, they
        might have become a powerful Universal Civilization. Furthermore, we
        can't rule out the possibility of Tyrsius lying…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After thinking for a while, Han Xiao still felt that he had to go and
        take a look. He could come and go as he pleased with the King, thus he
        planned to send out his Lord's Avatar like a real Mechanic to take a
        look. He did not plan to take the risk himself.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        On one hand, he wanted to complete the mission and see what would happen
        next. On the other hand, he felt that the civilization of Tyrsius might
        be a potential ally, and they might be able to fight the World Tree
        together. After all, the World Tree's style and mechanism could be said
        to be the public enemy of most intelligent civilizations.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Two days later, in a certain Federation of Light military base in the
        Ancient Star Desert.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        A Multi-Dimensional Sky Opening Transportation Device was slowly heating
        up, and a Lord's Avatar shell was waiting in the teleportation area. Han
        Xiao was watching from afar in the base with the respectful senior
        officer beside him.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao's Face Fruit had already reached the Large Success stage. There
        was no chance of being rejected if he borrowed the Multi-Dimensional Sky
        Opening Transportation Device from the Federation of Light.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Looking at the two gigantic mechanical rings spinning rapidly and
        turning into a halo, Han Xiao could not help but sigh.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Your Multi-Dimensional Sky Opening Transportation Device is truly a
        convenient invention. As long as you have the coordinates, you can go
        anywhere in the universe."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Indeed. This is the highest technological achievement of our Federation
        of Light." The base commander straightened his back with pride.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Impressive. Can I bring it back for research?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "This… Please don't make things difficult for me." The senior officer
        was stunned and smiled bitterly.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao smiled and did not tease this officer anymore. He activated his
        Lord's Avatar.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At this time, the power of the teleportation device reached its peak.
        Suddenly, light exploded, and the Avatar disappeared.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">wa</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao's vision changed, and he arrived outside the atmosphere of a
        planet. Before him was a dark green planet. Satellites were floating in
        the orbit of the planet. They did not seem to have any problems on the
        surface, but with a quick glance, Han Xiao could tell that these
        satellites had not been repaired for many years. They had all been
        corroded and turned into scrap metal. Vegetation covered the entire
        surface of the planet, and with a rough glance, he could not see any
        signs of a civilization city. Furthermore, there were no signs of life.
        It gave off a desolate feeling of decline.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Only a single brown metal tower was eye-catching. Looking down from
        outer space, it looked like this planet was wearing a small pointy hat.
        Looking at the ratio, one would know that this metal tower was extremely
        huge when looking at it from surface level.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        It looked very rough, like countless metal objects of different shapes
        stacked together. The structure was loose, like a huge garbage mountain.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "This is Planet Cree? Looks like something happened…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As Han Xiao was pondering, his pupils suddenly constricted, and he
        quickly adjusted his vision mode. His sight expanded rapidly, and he
        locked onto a small black dot that was slowly moving halfway up the
        metal tower.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        It was a robot covered in rust, carrying a metal fragment that was many
        times larger than itself on its back. It slowly climbed up the steep
        path toward the top of the metal tower. In Han Xiao's vision, it was the
        only moving thing
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao controlled the Lord's Avatar to descend in front of the robot
        and revealed himself.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, this robot did not seem to notice him and walked past him. When
        he passed by, Han Xiao could still hear the robot repeating the same
        word over and over again.
      </p>

        civilization…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao watched as the robot passed by him. With his experience, he
        could tell the technology level of this robot with a single glance.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He raised his hand slightly and aimed at the back of the transport
        robot. A magnetic force was released from his palm.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Buzz!</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The robot flew backward uncontrollably and attached itself to the Lord's
        Avatar's hand. It was unable to move, and only its hands and feet could
        still move. It was like a turtle whose shell had been grabbed.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        A few tiny blue snake-like electric arcs followed the arm of the Lord's
        Avatar and quickly swam to the surface of the robot's body, entering its
        body through the gaps in the armor. He immediately read the current
        state of this robot. Only its basic functions were still operating with
        difficulty. Most of its parts were severely damaged, almost to the point
        of being scrap.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At the same time, the item introduction popped up on the interface, and
        Han Xiao took a look.

      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao was curious. He used his Mechanical Force to hack into the
        unprotected chip and quickly copied the logic code and memory log.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The basic codes that the other party used were not related to the
        explored universe, but they were not difficult for Han Xiao. He easily
        analyzed them and understood most of them.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        A series of deciphered codes appeared in Han Xiao's quantum network
        vision. He quickly browsed through them and realized that the basic
        logic was the transportation robot code format that had no
        abnormalities. It should have had low artificial intelligence, but
        because there was no one to maintain it for a long time, there were some
        malfunctions in the data, causing the artificial intelligence level to
        decrease. It could barely maintain the core logic and carry out a
        long-term order.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This order was to bury a special machine, but in the database of a low
        artificial intelligence transport robot, there was naturally no detailed
        explanation of the purpose of this machine and why it was buried.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        From the data of this transport robot, Han Xiao could only see the
        appearance and position of this machine. It looked like the peaks of two
        pyramid-shaped objects were connected, like an hourglass placed
        horizontally. The location was below this metal tower.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The memory log, on the other hand, was intermittent. Due to the
        malfunction, there was a large number of gaps, and there were not even
        timestamps. He could only tell the time by the height of the metal tower
        in the transportation robot's memory. The height in the earliest memory
        file was about a quarter of the current height of the metal tower. This
        robot was already alone at that time.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Most of the memories of the transport robot were of ‘building' this
        metal tower. The other memories were of searching for spare parts in the
        warehouse of the abandoned factory, changing the heavily damaged parts
        of its body, and charging them.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Why does this look so familiar…"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao stroked his chin. He felt like he had seen something similar in
        an old movie in his previous life.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Other than these things, there was nothing else of value in this robot.
        Han Xiao turned off the magnetic device, and the robot fell back to the
        ground. The metal fragment on its back also fell to the side, following
        the metal tower.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The transport robot stayed on the spot for two seconds and did not
        bother about Han Xiao. It turned around and walked down the mountain as
        if it was looking for new ‘building material', as though nothing had
        happened.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao watched it disappear before looking at the interface.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At this time, the (Shadow of the Past] mission had been completed, and
        Han Xiao immediately calculated. There was a small amount of experience
        and a Tyrsius Character Summon Card. The ability was called ‘Mind
        Cleanse', and its effect was to expel one's negative status. It could
        only be used three times at most, which was quite useful.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">At the same time, a new mission popped up.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        You have triggered the mission (Secret of Extinction]!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Mission Introduction: You agreed to Tyrsius' request and came to his
        home planet, Cree, but something seems to have happened here.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Mission Requirements: Find out the reason behind the extinction of
        Arthur Civilization.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Reward: 5 Billion EXP, 1 Awakening Point</p>
      <p class="calibre3">"This civilization is extinct?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Han Xiao was stunned.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He immediately felt that the destruction of the civilization was most
        likely related to the unknown mechanical device that was suppressed
        under the metal tower.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, Han Xiao thought about it and did not bother. With a flash, he
        turned into a stream of light and escaped. Very soon, he stopped in
        front of an abandoned factory. It was the headquarters in the memory of
        the transport robot.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        It looked like a large mechanical factory, but it was covered in
        vegetation. The surrounding ruined buildings were all covered by dense
        trees.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao looked at it, and with a wave of his hand, a gale swept away
        the vegetation and dust on the factory door, revealing a sign written in
        unfamiliar words.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "This is probably the factory of that Meg Corporation, the place where
        that robot was produced…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao could not understand the language of this civilization and
        guessed.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He walked in with large strides and saw that the scrapped assembly lines
        were neatly arranged, with some unfinished transport robots hanging on
        them. It looked like they had suddenly stopped working.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao looked around and realized that all the energy equipment in the
        factory had been destroyed. The damage seemed to have been caused by an
        electromagnetic pulse. The only thing that was still working was a
        charging station, but the wires buried underground had been dug out and
        connected to a small, crude generator.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He had originally wanted to see if the factory mainframe had a more
        detailed database, and it would be best if he could find the star map of
        this civilization's territory. However, the chipset of the factory
        mainframe had also been destroyed and could not be turned on.
        Furthermore, all the data had been wiped out, and nothing could be
        found.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "From the looks of it, all the equipment in this factory seems to have
        been damaged by an impact that can destroy electrical and energy
        devices. They were instantly destroyed."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao summoned his mechanical army and searched the entire planet.
        Very soon, he found the remains of cities covered by plants. All the
        energy and electrical devices were in the same state.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Furthermore, not only were there no intelligent life forms on this
        planet, there were no beasts or insects to be seen either. It was as
        though all life forms other than plants were extinct.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In addition, in some city residences, there were bowls and plates of
        food on the table, and clusters of rotten clothes were scattered on the
        ground. All signs indicated that the life forms on the entire planet
        seemed to have disappeared at the same time. "What happened? Everyone
        disappeared overnight. It seems like that transport robot was the only
        survivor…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Han Xiao was even more curious.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He turned around and returned to the metal tower. His entire body was
        wrapped in the repulsion force field, and he immediately entered the
        bottom of the tower. He walked forward with large strides, and the pile
        of metal waste in front of him was smoothly pushed to the side, creating
        a path.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Not long after, he walked to the central area and saw a pile of
        construction debris. It had been crushed by a mountain of trash, and
        there were all kinds of experimental equipment scattered around. It
        seemed to have once been a research base.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        A scanning light shot out from the Lord's Avatar's eyes, and it
        immediately saw a large space underground. It looked like an underground
        base in the past, but it was also crushed by the huge weight above and
        filled with metal scraps.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After scanning for a while, he finally locked onto the target. The
        hourglass-like unknown device was pressed into the trash pile, making it
        difficult to distinguish it.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao released his Mechanical Force, and this unknown device slowly
        floated up and into his hands. He then left the metal tower and returned
        to the outside world.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Mechanical Force seeped into the unknown device, and Han Xiao could feel
        the internal structure. He realized that he could not understand this
        technology, and many parts had been damaged and destroyed after being
        buried for a long time.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Han Xiao looked at the item introduction.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        [Psionic Wave Transmitter-Prototype (Damaged)]: Function unknown.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Psionic Wave?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Han Xiao raised his brows and started to think.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He had a feeling that this concept of ‘psionic waves' was not the same
        as the ‘psionic waves' and ‘psionic impact' of the explored universe. He
        did not know what was going on at the moment, but he could roughly guess
        how the Arthur Civilization went extinct. Research involving psionic
        energy had always been extremely dangerous, and many civilizations had
        been doomed because of it.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After pondering for a few seconds, Han Xiao used (Bold Explorer) on this
        thing. The last time he used it on Beyonder's Vestige, the notification
        was that it was ineffective on the target and did not successfully cast
        it, so it did not enter a seven-day cooldown period.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Buzz!</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao's vision suddenly changed, and he arrived at a research
        institute.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The psionic wave transmitter was suspended in midair, covered by a
        transparent container. There were tubes connected to it, and below it
        was a huge pile of equipment. Countless researchers in uniform were busy
        adjusting the parameters.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        A senior officer who looked like the person in charge waved his hand and
        said something. The other researchers pushed the lever and activated the
        switch. Energy flowed into the psionic wave transmitter. Not long after,
        the space on both sides of this hourglass-shaped device began to
        vibrate. The air distorted like invisible ripples, but it was restrained
        within a small area.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">All the researchers present were overjoyed.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">However, the next moment, something happened!</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The ripples on both sides of the device suddenly broke through the
        constraints, and a light blue ring-shaped shockwave spread out, passing
        through the inner wall of the container and quickly sweeping across the
        entire room. All the devices exploded, and the energy devices were
        instantly paralyzed. The entire room immediately turned black.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The researchers that were swept by the shockwave were all killed in the
        blink of an eye, turning into ashes without a sound, leaving only empty
        clothes on the ground. At this moment, Han Xiao's vision suddenly zoomed
        out and arrived at the outer space of the planet that overlooked the
        entire planet. It turned into a macro perspective, and he saw a blue
        shockwave explode on the surface of Planet Cree, sweeping across the
        entire planet. The brightly lit cities instantly darkened, and countless
        unaware citizens turned into dust.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">No one on the entire planet survived!</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, this was not the end. Han Xiao could clearly see that this
        light blue shockwave that destroyed all electrons, energy equipment, and
        life forms did not weaken. It spread far into the universe with Planet
        Cree as the center, quickly disappearing from his sight.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After seeing this, Han Xiao's vision returned to normal, and the effect
        of the skill ended.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "As expected, it's because of this thing. I thought that Tyrsius was
        lying to me, but his civilization really isn't that advanced. They can
        even destroy themselves by researching psionic energy, but it doesn't
        seem right to say that their technology isn't good. The psionic wave
        transmitter they created is probably some kind of advanced technology…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao fiddled with the device in his hands in shock.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After watching the video, he had a rough idea of how this device worked.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Primordial Psionic Energy itself could assimilate, devour, absorb,
        and transform various forms of energy. Once it exploded, it would expand
        endlessly, swallowing everything
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, the psionic wave transmitter created by the Arthur Civilization
        could destroy certain forms of energy without devouring any matter. It
        could also absorb some of the energy to maintain its own expansion. A
        normal psionic energy explosion was a solid energy cluster, but this
        ‘psionic wave' was just a ripple.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, there were also some things that Han Xiao did not understand.
        He did not understand why the other materials were not damaged, but the
        life forms were destroyed. In short, there were still many unknowns
        about this technology. "It seems to have a lot of research value. Maybe
        it can become an important combat technology for me."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao was in a good mood. He did not have any plans for this trip,
        but he did not expect to gain something unexpected.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He had a feeling that this psionic wave technology was more powerful
        than he had expected.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The (Secret of Extinction] on the interface also showed that it was
        completed. The normal way was to look for clues everywhere, but he had
        the [Bold Explorer) and completed the mission.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The experience reward did not matter. One Awakening Point was better
        than nothing. However, it was very easy and did not take much effort.
        The biggest reward was this special psionic wave technology. Just as Han
        Xiao was feeling happy, he suddenly heard a familiar voice beside him.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Discovered a stranger approaching the mission target. Permission to use
        a stun gun!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao turned around and saw that the broken transport robot had
        returned to the foot of the mountain. It raised its mechanical arm
        toward him, and two firearms shot out from its wrist. Without saying a
        word, it pulled the trigger at Han Xiao.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Ka ka ka…</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao had long known that these two rusty firearms were useless, and
        they could not shoot anything at all. However, the transport robot did
        not seem to have noticed it, and it continued to pull the trigger in
        vain.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao raised his brows, took a step to the left, and the muzzles of
        the transport robot followed him. He took another step to the right, and
        the muzzles turned around again, facing him.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Looking at the robot pulling the trigger, Han Xiao felt that it was a
        little cute.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Forget it, I won't dismantle you." Seeing that it was not a threat at
        all, Han Xiao ignored it. He summoned more exploration-type mechanical
        soldiers and waved for them to leave, searching for other planets in
        this universe to see if there were any survivors of the Arthur
        Civilization. He wanted to find the history of this civilization as well
        as the records of Tyrsius' deeds. After all, there were still many
        things that he had yet to understand. However, he could just let the
        mechanical soldiers do this for him. After all, he was a Mechanic and he
        did not have to do such troublesome things himself.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After doing all this, Han Xiao looked back at the transport robot.
        Seeing that it was still pulling the trigger, he could not help but
        smile.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Speaking of which, I don't know what kind of luck this little guy has
        to be able to survive the psionic waves. He might be the only survivor
        of the entire Arthur Civilization. Since I promised Tyrsius to take care
        of his hometown, I can't ignore you…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao thought for a while and suddenly released a stream of
        Mechanical Force, which landed on the transport robot. The robot froze
        on the spot, and its appearance and structure changed rapidly. It
        gradually turned into the shape of a human, and the rust fell off.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At the same time, wave after wave of mechanical particles poured out
        from Han Xiao's hands and landed on the other party's body. The material
        of the mechanical suit was quickly strengthened.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Not long after, the transformation stopped. The appearance of this
        transport robot had changed drastically. It was covered in silver armor
        and had a streamlined shape. Its body was slender and long, and energy
        circuits that emitted a faint fluorescent light could be seen on its
        body. It was as if it had gone from a chibi to a realistic concept art.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"That's enough."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao nodded and retracted his Mechanical Force.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He gave life to this transport robot, turning it into a mechanical life
        form. At the same time, he had greatly improved the other party's body
        and added many new functions. He had also stored some knowledge of the
        Star System Civilization's technology tree into the other party's
        database. However, he did not rewrite the core logic of the other party.
        He only perfected the other party's intelligence on the original basis
        and did not leave his mark on the other party.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        With his current abilities, the first-generation Mechanical Life that he
        had personally modified had extremely high-performance bonuses.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao did not plan to take this robot with him because he owed
        Tyrsius a favor. As for whether this robot would be able to grow a new
        flower of civilization on the ruins of Planet Cree after receiving his
        gift, that was not his concern.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Looking up at the soaring metal tower, Han Xiao had mixed feelings.
        After knowing the situation, this metal tower seemed to have a special
        meaning. In his eyes, this metal tower that looked like a building that
        had become the tombstone of a civilization.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "The advancement of technology is also a disaster…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao sighed. He then glanced at the transport robot before changing
        into King and disappearing with the psionic wave transmitter.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The transport robot did not seem to have noticed anything. It stood
        there in a daze for a long time before finally coming back to its
        senses. It looked down at its body, which had changed drastically, and
        seemed very confused.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The electric current on the motherboard seemed to have created sparks in
        its mind. It murmured to himself,
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"What… am I?"</p>
    </div>

    <div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-1386">

      </h1>
      <p class="calibre3">
        A few days later, in the Black Star Army territory. Five figures were
        floating above a desolate planet. Four of them were staring at a
        black-robed figure. "Black Star, are you kidding me? You want us to help
        you break through to a higher level?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Kasuyi was surprised.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Do I look like I'm joking?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao asked in return. After returning from the Arthur Civilization,
        he immediately contacted four peak Beyond Grade As and invited them to
        help him with his cultivation. Wuornos had agreed long ago to represent
        Espers. The other three classes were Kasuyi, the old dragon, and
        Sierron, who did not have a deep relationship with them. The Pugilist
        class was relatively weak at the high end, and there were not many
        strong people. Putting aside the Revivors, Sierron was already one of
        the rare cards. Although Han Xiao preferred Karlot at his peak, he had
        yet to grow fully, there was no need to wait for him. He just needed to
        find Sierron to make up for the loss.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In the past, during the Hila Rescue War, he and Sierron had some
        conflicts, but after experiencing all kinds of storms together with the
        association, their relationship had returned to normal. This guy was not
        a direct descendant of the Universal Civilizations and had always been
        on the side of the association. Now that he was also a vice president,
        he could be trusted.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"You can always do unexpected things."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">The three of them shook their heads helplessly.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        When they received Han Xiao's invitation a few days ago, they were all
        equally shocked. They did not expect Black Star to be able to reach a
        higher level without saying anything, opening up the path of individual
        strength.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At first, they thought that Black Star was joking with them, but after
        confirming it, again and again, they realized that Black Star was
        serious.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Because they had a good relationship with each other, although the three
        of them were surprised, they agreed to the invitation and prepared to
        help. What surprised them was Black Star's method of advancement.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Speaking of which, what can we help you with? Shouldn't this sort of
        thing be done alone?" Milizaus was confused.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In his mind, breaking through to a higher level and ascending to the
        next level was something that one could only do by themselves. Since
        when did one need help?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Of course, I have my reasons." Han Xiao did not explain the reason, and
        it was difficult for him to explain.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Wuornos pondered.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "The five of us have different Super systems. Could it be that your idea
        is to combine the five elements…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Han Xiao interrupted him and waved his hands.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Why are you asking so many questions now? Since you're already here,
        just follow the plan and wait for the final result." Hearing this,
        Wuornos stopped talking. However, he kept thinking about it in his mind
        and was secretly surprised by Han Xiao's performance.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He was very puzzled. The method to reach a higher level should be a
        mystery to everyone, and Black Star did not look like he had tried it
        many times. However, why did this guy look so confident? Why did he have
        such a thought? He borrowed the Church's National Treasure and asked a
        few people for help…
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Furthermore, attempting a promotion should be risky. Why was Black Star
        using such a bold method? Was he not afraid? Did he not sense the danger
        of this Promotion?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Various thoughts flashed through Wuornos' mind. In the end, he shook his
        head and did not intend to remind Han Xiao.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In any case, this was Black Star's Promotion. He looked very confident,
        so there was no need for Han Xiao to kindly remind him. He would just
        wait and see. Even if Black Star failed, the experience would still be
        able to broaden his horizons.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Thinking about this, Wuornos pressed his palm against his chest and
        phased through it. He took out a ball of soft white light and threw it
        at Han Xiao.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"This is what you want. I'll lend it to you."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao reached out to take it. He looked down at this Arcane Church
        weapon. It was different from what he had expected. It was just a ball
        of light.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Its main user was beside him, so it was not convenient for him to study
        it closely. Han Xiao pressed the Arcane Church device on his chest, and
        the white light quickly fused into his body. A special energy
        immediately surged out and covered his entire body. He felt that his
        cells in his critical state immediately became much calmer.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao glanced at the interface. The first Promotion requirement had
        turned golden, and it was now labeled as "Activation Triggered".
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Then I shall begin."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao nodded at the others and floated a distance away before landing
        on the surface of the planet.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Watching his figure shrink into a black dot, Sierron turned to look at
        the people around him and asked,
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Do you think he will succeed?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "If it was that easy, I would have entered a higher level long ago."
        Wuornos shook his head and said calmly.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Buzz!</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At this time, in everyone's perception, space suddenly shook, and a
        shocking energy wave burst out from the planet!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In just an instant, the entire planet exploded into a huge hole, and the
        molten fluids in the core gushed out and scattered across the galaxy.
        Then, the planet suddenly exploded!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Bang!</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Amidst the debris and light, Han Xiao's voice did not move at all. It
        was continuously emitting shocking energy waves, and his aura was rising
        rapidly.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"It's starting!"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The eyes of the four of them focused, and they immediately followed the
        plan. They released their energy. It passed through the fragments of the
        planet and entered Han Xiao's body.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao was bathed in the light, and the cells in his body started to
        go berserk. He felt like his body was going to separate and reform at
        any time.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, the Church's National Treasure floating in his chest released
        fluctuations at a fixed frequency, engulfing his entire body and
        allowing his body to maintain its original structure.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Strangely, though the different energies sent out from his four helpers
        should have been ejected, at this moment, they were not repelled.
        Instead, they seemed to have been absorbed and quickly merged into his
        cells.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At the same time, the Beyonder's Vestige that had been dormant for many
        days suddenly glowed brightly and started burning fiercely, releasing
        all the energy. It immediately caused the speed of advancement to spike
        and soar rapidly. The feeling of pain and exhilaration assaulted Han
        Xiao's mind time and time again. He struggled to control his vision and
        glanced at the interface, only to see that the notifications were
        flooding in.

      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Originally, there was no chance for a Race Evolution at level 360, but
        the two God's Trait Transformation metamorphoses brought about two
        additional Life level promotion opportunities.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Boom!</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The surging energy was so dense that it almost solidified. With Han Xiao
        as the center, it gushed out in all directions, spreading far and wide.
        It had already reached the level of a cosmic energy surge, and almost
        all the Black Star Army's outposts in this area sounded an alarm.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Scorching energy flowed through his body, and all the cells in his body
        rapidly advanced toward a higher level of life. It was as if his cells
        had developed an independent consciousness, but it did not cause great
        changes under the support of the Church's National Treasure.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        An endless stream of energy gushed over from all directions, and Han
        Xiao almost turned into the core of a nebula. His entire body was filled
        with heatwaves, and he felt like he was swelling up like a balloon.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He tried his best to maintain his thoughts and stared at the
        notification on the interface.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The improvement he got this time was extremely powerful. If he did not
        have the special Race Evolution brought about by the Apotheosis, the
        simple genetic optimization he got during an Advancement would not have
        brought about such a high amount of attribute increase.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, the notifications of his two Race Evolutions had yet to end.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">

        the original Void Dimension]
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao looked at the introduction of these two talents with a hard-to
        suppress glee in his eyes.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The four Mechanic abilities had undergone a special evolution. Among
        them, (Ode of the Gods] and [God's Emissary Creation) were enhanced
        based on basic values. The exact effects did not change, only the name
        of his Apostle Weapons were renamed as Mechanical Oracles.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As for (Allspark] and [Godly Stronghold), they had some functional
        changes.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        [Tinder Awakening] was originally an ability used to create mechanical
        lives, and it needed to be actively cast. However, after evolution, it
        now possessed a passive effect. So long as machinery was connected by
        Mechanical Force, it could temporarily become a mechanical life form and
        receive various enhancements attributed to mechanical life forms. The
        effect would disappear if the Mechanical Force was cut off, but
        prolonged usage could solidify its status permanently, changing it to
        become a mechanical life-form forever. This way, the efficiency and
        scale of creating mechanical life forms would be raised to a new level,
        and the consumption would also be much lower.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In addition, the function of (Godly Stronghold) was to open a secondary
        dimension in his body as a Dimension Factory. He did not need to summon
        the secondary dimension portal any longer. This was akin to having the
        late game skills of a Mechanical Pugilist, which removed all its
        previous skills' side effects. Now, even if the environment outside was
        locked onto by the Space Stabilization Anchor, Han Xiao would still be
        able to launch a surprise attack.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        (Void Divine Body] also had similar effects. It could open up a new Void
        Dimension within one's body and even swallow parts of the original Void
        Dimension to improve one's own Void Dimension.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The mechanisms revealed by these two talents seemed to indicate the
        formation of a universe within his body!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Is this the difference between levels?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao was shocked. Even now, the evolution had yet to end, and
        notifications were still being sent out continuously. Intense waves of
        pain assaulted his mind.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The power released by the Beyonder's Vestige was cleansing the cells
        over and over again, causing the cells to change time and time again. It
        gradually approached the special ‘flawless' particle form, and the
        changes in his body became more and more intense, sometimes intense and
        sometimes mild.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At the same time, the four ‘pretty boys' who were continuously supplying
        energy finally realized that something was wrong.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        From Han Xiao's body, there was an aura that made them tremble from the
        bottom of their souls. It was as if they had met with an existence of a
        higher level on the food chain.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Am I seeing things? Is this the suppression pressure caused by a
        difference in life levels?!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kasuyi's eyes widened in shock. "It can't be wrong, this is the
        feeling…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Milizaus' dragon beard fluttered, and his huge dragon eyes flashed with
        disbelief. He secretly swallowed a dragon breath that was about to come
        out.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Wuornos, who was originally quite calm, could no longer remain
        unruffled. He stared at Han Xiao's figure in shock.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Holy sh*t, could it be that this guy was so lucky, able to succeed in
        one go?!

        No matter how shocked the four of them were, Han Xiao's evolution
        continued to advance.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The surging golden Mechanical Force formed a huge energy whirlpool,
        spinning and expanding. Han Xiao's figure was at the center, and he was
        already drowned by the endless light. As for this unlucky planet, it had
        been completely destroyed without a single trace left.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Boiling hot energy flowed through his body, and it was as if his cells
        and soul were burning intensely. He felt as if he had turned into a
        piece of steel, enduring the refinement time and time again.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao endured the pain of the metamorphosis and stared at the
        notifications on the interface with his golden eyes.

      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        When Han Xiao advanced to the Beyond Grade A realm, he had created an
        exclusive racial talent, [Mechanical Genius). At this time, the
        Apotheosis of the race had given him two chances to create an exclusive
        talent, which was also a genetic talent that could be awakened in his
        descendants.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He thought about it and chose the ability strength increase and
        attribute enhancement. These two enhancements were more comprehensive.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As his new talents were not as enhanced as (Mechanical Genius), the
        effect would not be too strong After a few random draws, Han Xiao
        finally determined the effects of the two new exclusive racial talents.

        "These two new talents are not bad. They both have growth potential."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Han Xiao was excited.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        When he reached the later stages of his growth, he could receive all the
        accumulated bonuses at once. Therefore, these two new talents would be
        able to increase his strength.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Although his current attributes were almost all in the tens of
        thousands, 3,000 to 4,000 Free Attribute Points were still not a small
        number. Most importantly, he could freely allocate them, and the ability
        power was an important bonus that any class required. The increase was
        quite considerable.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        (Mechanical Genius], [Divine Gene), and (Natural Elite) were the
        inherited talents of his race. Individuals with these three talents
        would undoubtedly have a higher growth rate. They would all be extremely
        talented Super seeds and could suppress Supers of the same grade. "If
        only I could make a bunch of alternate accounts…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">A thought flashed through Han Xiao's mind.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        I still don't have a descendant race, I feel like I can start thinking
        about reproducing.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        While he was thinking, a follow-up notification popped up on the
        interface.

        "There really are new Grade talents!" Han Xiao's eyes sparkled.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This was an important factor in dividing the strength between two
        grades. One could choose two options when advancing to Beyond Grade A,
        and it was the same now. However, the effect would be stronger, and it
        could even be stacked with one's grade talents.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The power bonus was a must. As for the other option, Han Xiao preferred
        to increase his health. It seemed like he was the only one who had
        reached this level, so while the tankiness seemed to be enough, it was
        actually the basic bonus brought about by this Promotion. This END bonus
        could be gained just by completing Apotheosis Promotion, his current
        health was probably only at the intermediate level at this grade. He
        could not guarantee that there would not be anyone else who would rise
        in the future. Furthermore, there might already be someone at grade X in
        the universe. At the very least, there would not be any mistake if he
        continued to develop the strength of dealing damage and tanking.

      <p class="calibre3">
        Before Han Xiao could get excited, even more violent energy burst out
        from his body, and all his cells began a new round of transformation.
        Han Xiao felt that every cell was becoming more and more agitated, as
        though they were all going to escape from his body. However, as the
        Church's National Treasure shook, the struggle of the cells was
        suppressed, but it also brought him more pain. However, even though he
        had completed the Race Apotheosis, the Promotion was not over yet. There
        was still the last transformation left.

      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Han Xiao's breathing stopped.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The new class was also unfamiliar to him, and (Legendary Mechanic) did
        not have the upper limit of the class. This proved that this was the
        last stage of the Mechanic class. He could continue to level up, but
        there was no Class Advancement after that.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He looked at the various new abilities obtained from this Class
        Advancement and could not help but narrow his eyes. The effects of the
        skills were as flashy as the name, but the bonuses were astonishing.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao wanted to analyze his new abilities in detail, but the pain of
        evolution came one after another, almost freezing his thoughts. It was
        not a good time to study them.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Seeing that the notifications on the interface had finally stopped, Han
        Xiao knew that he had obtained all the bonuses from this Promotion. He
        quickly calmed down and silently felt his evolution. The sense of time
        quickly became blurry.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After a full two days, the huge energy whirlpool finally seemed to have
        expanded to its limit. It slowly shrank back toward the center and
        entered Han Xiao's body.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        On the other hand, Wuornos and the other three had been standing guard
        at the edge, watching Han Xiao's advancement from start to finish. They
        did not dare blink at all, afraid that they would miss a second.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Because this was the territory of the Black Star Army, Han Xiao had
        already informed them that no one was allowed to disturb him. Thus, even
        though this place had become the source of the cosmic-level energy
        surge, triggering the radar alarms of many organizations, no one had
        come over to watch.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After a while, the energy whirlpool returned to Han Xiao's body, and the
        dazzling light faded, revealing Han Xiao's current appearance.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He was floating in the air with his eyes closed as if he was still in a
        meditative state and had yet to wake up. There was a special aura around
        him, and his skin was glowing. A few light golden particles were slowly
        flowing around his body. Seeing this, Wuornos and the others hesitated.
        They did not know what was going on with Han Xiao and did not approach
        him immediately.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This time, Han Xiao finally opened his eyes. The light on his body
        stopped, and he floated toward the three of them with a smile.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "My Promotion went very smoothly. Thank you, everyone."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Hearing this, the four of them were shocked.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Although they had already guessed it in their hearts in the past two
        days, they still could not help but feel a strong sense of disbelief
        when Han Xiao admitted it personally.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "You really succeeded? You opened up a higher level of individual
        strength ?" Milizaus cried out.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"That should be the case."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Han Xiao nodded and released some pressure.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The four people present were stunned. They instantly felt a vast
        pressure and could not help but feel their hearts palpitate.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, it only lasted for an instant before Han Xiao retracted the
        pressure from the difference in the hierarchy of life, allowing them to
        heave a sigh of relief.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After the unbelievable shock, they were filled with excitement and
        respect.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        They were all peak Beyond Grade As, including Wuornos and Kasuyi, who
        thought that they were half a step away from reaching a higher level.
        Now that they could see the entire process of Han Xiao's advancement and
        see the successful case of him reaching a higher level, would this
        method work on them too?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Did Black Star specifically give them this benefit ?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "I didn't expect you to succeed in one go… Congratulations."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Wuornos was extremely envious. He had tried so many times, but in the
        end, he stopped because he was worried about the risk. However, Black
        Star had gone straight in and succeeded. Indeed, men and their
        constitutions could not be compared…
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, although Wuornos felt bitter, he was more excited and
        overjoyed. He felt that his insight was really good. He had indeed not
        misjudged Black Star. In fact, this guy was even more amazing than he
        had expected. He had rushed up to a higher level and pointed him in the
        right direction!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        With Black Star scouting ahead, he would be able to replicate the
        success today.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Church's National Treasure was his, and the Arcane Church did not
        lack direct members of five classes. The other two Universal
        Civilizations would more or less provide help to contend with Black
        Star. Therefore, among the Beyond Grade As, he was the only one who
        could easily replicate the method Black Star used today. He undoubtedly
        profited the most!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Although Black Star did not fail, which was out of his expectations and
        caused his selfish thought to fail, he still did not come for nothing!
        Thinking about this, Wuornos felt extremely comfortable. He decided to
        prepare for his advancement when he returned.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, at this moment, he suddenly remembered that the Church's
        National Treasure was still in Han Xiao's hands. He did not know how far
        Black Star's strength had progressed. If he had any evil intentions…
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Wuornos' heart tightened, and he said slowly, "Black Star, can I have it
        back?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Oh, take it."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao glanced at him and saw that he was nervous. He shook his head
        and smiled. He took out the Church's National Treasure and threw it back
        to Wuornos. He did not intend to take it for himself.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Since they did not cause any trouble and came to help him, he would not
        kick them to the curb after they outlived their usefulness. There was no
        need to offend them because of this. At most, he would just borrow it
        again. Furthermore, there was more than one ‘Stabilizer'. After his
        Promotion, Han Xiao had some new ideas.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Wuornos took the Church's National Treasure and stuffed it back into his
        body. He secretly heaved a sigh of relief, but then he was overjoyed.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kasuyi looked at the Church's National Treasure with a burning gaze
        before looking back at Han Xiao.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Your Promotion is a good thing for the entire Beyond Grade A group. I
        wonder if you plan to publicize this method?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Keep it a secret for now. Just keep this matter to yourselves. Don't
        tell anyone about it for the time being to avoid disturbances. To be
        honest, this Promotion is quite dangerous. If it fails, you might not be
        able to revive with the Sanctum."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Han Xiao waved his hands.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He did not care much about this matter. The four of them only saw the
        surface. Even if they imitated his method, they would not be able to
        trigger the Apotheosis Promotion. This was because they lacked an
        important factor, Beyonder's Vestige.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Now that he had successfully advanced and was no longer in a critical
        state, he had also lost the ability to sense the Beyonder's Vestige. As
        long as he did not specifically remind them, others might not be able to
        activate this perception. Furthermore, without a detailed interface
        notification, others might not know what this perception meant.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The most important thing was that he had already used up the last
        Beyonder's Vestige that was left in the explored universe. Even if
        someone found out about the use of the Beyonder's Vestige, they would
        have to go to the unexplored area to search for it. Who knew how long it
        would take?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Hearing this, apart from Wuornos, Kasuyi and the others were shocked and
        suppressed the impulse in their hearts.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Milizaus suddenly thought of something and asked, "By the way, the new
        grade has yet to be defined in the Galactic Society. Why don't you give
        it a name?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Sierron agreed. "Indeed, the title of Beyond Grade A is to commemorate
        the exploration era. Now that a new level has appeared, a new name is
        also needed. It will be recorded in history. You are the founder, and
        only you have the right to name it."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao stroked his chin and did not reject. He immediately thought of
        the name of his class and raised his brows.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"How about… We call it the Transcendent Grade?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Sounds good."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The few of them naturally did not have any objections to a name and
        nodded.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Then it's settled. The grade above Beyond Grade A will be called the
        Transcendent Grade."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Han Xiao smiled and nodded.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This time, Kasuyi could not hold back his curiosity and sized Han Xiao
        up.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Black Star, what is the strength of the new level? How strong is it?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Han Xiao shook his head and smiled.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">"I'm very, very strong…"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As he spoke, he looked at his attributes panel, and a strange look
        flashed in his eyes.

        Retracting his gaze from the attribute interface, Han Xiao turned around
        and saw Kasuyi looking like he wanted to test out his Transcendent
        strength personally. He smiled and waved.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "There's no need for a spar. I've just stepped into the Transcendent
        Grade, so I'm not familiar with my strength yet. If I don't control it
        well, I'm afraid I won't be able to hold back and kill you. If that
        happens, I'll have to revive you and give myself more trouble."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Is this even human language?</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kasuyi tilted his head. Seeing that Han Xiao had no intention of showing
        it, Kasuyi did not insist and could only give up on this thought for the
        time being. After all, there was still a long way to go, he would see it
        sooner or later.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Glancing at the four of them, Han Xiao smiled and said,
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Everyone, I still need to familiarize myself with my strength, so I'll
        take my leave first… By the way, Wuornos, just let me know when you're
        ready to unseal the Ten Thousand Deity Scepter." With that said, he
        nodded and left. He disappeared from everyone's sight in a flash. The
        remaining four looked at each other. The atmosphere was a little
        strange. Black Star had shown them the way to become a Transcendent.
        This kind of secret was most valuable only if they held it alone. None
        of the four of them were willing to leak it out. If it was in the past,
        they might even have thought of killing each other. However, the times
        had changed. Black Star was above them, and the association had united
        the Beyond Grade As. There were still enemies outside, so they could
        only endure others sharing this secret.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Don't forget Black Star's instructions. It's enough for us to know his
        method of advancement. Don't tell anyone else without his approval,"
        Sierron said with a deep voice.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Heh, do I look like someone who would spout nonsense?" Milizaus
        snorted. "Black Star is the president, and we're also members of the
        association. Of course, we won't say anything, but the direct
        descendants of the civilization might ." Kasuyi narrowed his eyes and
        stared at Wuornos. Hearing this, Milizaus and Sierron also turned to
        look at Wuornos with subtle expressions.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        None of them had the motive to leak the secret, but Wuornos was a direct
        member of the church. If the upper echelons of the civilization asked
        him for this method, would he keep it a secret? As a member of the
        association, the three of them considered it from the perspective of the
        faction. If the association was the only one who knew how to advance to
        the Beyond Grade, it would be a new bargaining chip to attract Supers,
        and they would be able to suppress the three Universal Civilizations in
        terms of individual strength.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Wuornos' face was calm, and he did not give in verbally. He said
        casually, "I will also try to advance. Even if I don't say it, they will
        know when the time comes."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Tsk." Sierron snorted but did not retort.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Seeing that the three of them had nothing else to say, Wuornos did not
        stay any longer. He turned around and left in a hurry.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He only wanted to return to the Arcane Church as soon as possible,
        unable to wait to study Black Star's advancement method. Kasuyi and the
        other two watched him leave without moving. "The Church's National
        Treasure is in this guy's hands. With Black Star's successful case, the
        Arcane Church probably won't lend it to outsiders anymore…" Milizaus
        smacked his lips.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Hmm, in that case, only Wuornos and the direct members of the church
        will be able to replicate the method that Black Star used. We can forget
        about it." Sierron nodded. "Black Star is a Mechanic and has reached a
        higher level. Maybe he can find a replacement. We'll know when we ask."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Kasuyi's expression was calm.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Considering that the Arcane Church National Weapon was an indispensable
        tool for Black Star's advancement method, the few of them had the
        thought of snatching it. However, after thinking about it, they decided
        not to. Wuornos was not easy to deal with, and the three of them
        represented the association. They were not willing to create trouble for
        Black Star.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Now that Black Star had opened a new level, his position as the
        association's leader was even more stable. Originally, they were all on
        the same level, so even if they listened to his orders temporarily, they
        would not treat themselves as Black Star's subordinates.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, as Black Star entered a new realm, their relationship subtly
        changed. It was just that the three of them had yet to feel the subtle
        change in their subconscious. At this time, Milizaus suddenly thought of
        something and asked, "By the way, although the method of advancement has
        to be kept a secret, there's no need to hide the fact that Black Star
        has become a Transcendent, right?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kasuyi shook his head and said, "Since Black Star did not give any
        special instructions, then there's no need to. Furthermore, there's no
        need to hide such a good thing. However, it's only limited to the upper
        echelons of the association. As for the three Universal Civilizations,
        they will most likely know about the situation through Wuornos, but they
        won't spread it around."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">On the other side, the Arcane Church.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "What did you say? Black Star actually succeeded?!" The Pope's eyes
        widened in shock. Wuornos, who had come to report, nodded calmly and
        slowly continued. "That's right. Black Star has already stepped into a
        higher level of individual strength. He named it the Transcendent Grade.
        I witnessed it with my own eyes." "Didn't you say that stepping into the
        new tier is very difficult? You said that lending out the Void Spirit
        Kingdom's weapon would be no big deal, because how many times Black Star
        would fail?" The Pope stared at Wuornos, both shocked and furious.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Oh, I miscalculated," Wuornos said with an expressionless face.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "That's it?! Do you think you can get away with it with just this
        sentence?!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">The Pope glared at him, getting even more furious.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        If not for the fact that you kept emphasizing that this deal would
        definitely be profitable, why would we lend the Void Spirit National
        Treasure to help Black Star advance? Are you hooking up with Black Star
        and speaking for him to trick me?! I really don't believe you! "Then
        what do you want?" Wuornos glanced at him.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Pope closed his eyes and took a deep breath to calm himself down.
        Only then did he speak. "No matter what, this has already happened.
        Think of a way to salvage the situation."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Because of a wrong decision, he had helped Black Star reach a higher
        level of individual strength. He was filled with regret. If he had
        known, he would have rejected Black Star's request! However, now was not
        the time to shift the blame. He was the one who had given the order, and
        he could not shirk the responsibility. The Pope quickly got rid of his
        anger, regret, and other emotions. "On the bright side, at least we got
        the Ten Thousand Deity Scepter back… provided Black Star doesn't go back
        on his word." The Pope shook his head. "There's no need for him to go
        back on his word," Wuornos said calmly. "This Universal Treasure is no
        longer a threat to him."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"That's true…"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Hearing this, the Pope felt even more upset. He only felt that the Ten
        Thousand Deity Scepter was no longer that tempting.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">This deal was a huge loss!</p>
      <p class="calibre3">However, at this moment, Wuornos slowly said,</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "However, it's not like I didn't gain anything this time. I watched the
        entire process of Black Star's advancement and have already grasped his
        method. I won't be as clueless as before. I can replicate this
        successful case and reach a higher level." The Pope sat in silence for a
        moment before his eyes lit up. Although the advancement of Black Star
        was beneficial to the war against the outside world, it would not be a
        good thing for the three Universal Civilizations in the long term.
        However, his direct descendant had now learned the method of Black
        Star's advancement. As long as they succeeded, he would have another
        Transcendent Grade Super on his side to fight Black Star, forming a new
        balance without having to worry about Black Star losing control! More
        importantly, the ones who could use this method were the people of the
        Church. Even if the three Universal Civilizations were linked together
        right now, there were still segregated as civilizations. With this
        method, the Church could also suppress the other two civilizations in
        terms of individual strength! The Pope was in a good mood. "How
        confident are you of success?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Wuornos thought for a moment and nodded, "There's a seventy percent
        chance that I can reach the Transcendent Grade like Black Star." "Okay!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Pope perked up. The 70% chance was quite high! When they were
        chatting in the past, Wuornos had said that he was not confident at all.
        Now, the chance had increased countless times.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In that case, not only would helping Black Star not be a loss, but it
        would even be a small gain
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Thinking deeper, it was fortunate that Black Star needed to borrow the
        Void Spirit Kingdom's weapon this time. Otherwise, the direct
        descendants of the civilization would not have known about his secret
        advancement, and this advancement method would have been monopolized
        only by the association.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In that case, wouldn't the future be even more disadvantageous for the
        three Universal Civilizations?!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Thinking of this, the Pope felt much better and finally smiled. "The
        Church will do its best to provide you with resources to help you reach
        the Transcendent Grade. If you need anything, just tell us. Don't
        hesitate!" "Don't worry, I won't hold back."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Wuornos nodded. The Pope thought for a moment and said, "Also, keep the
        matter of the Promotion method a secret for the time being. As for the
        success of Black Star's Promotion, I'll inform the leaders of the
        Federation of Light and the Crimson Dynasty. We have common interests in
        this, and we can't hide it from them. We need to talk to Black Star."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Up to you. As long as it helps me."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Wuornos did not care about these miscellaneous matters. All he wanted to
        do was copy Han Xiao's advancement method. He could almost see the
        higher level that he had always dreamed of, waving at him.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        A day later, in the territory of the Black Star Army, the exclusive
        machinery factory. Han Xiao looked at the cloud of Mechanical Force in
        his palm, and his pupils constricted as though he was observing the
        microscopic world.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After a while, he suddenly clenched his fingers and crushed it into
        pieces, creating a golden shockwave.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "The last advancement of the Mechanic class. Its strength is truly
        unique…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Han Xiao murmured.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Throughout the day, he was mainly testing out the new abilities brought
        by his Class Advancement. By now, he had more or less figured it out,
        and he was speechless.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        (Beyonder Artifact) was a core talent. It was similar to the advanced
        version of (Spirit Instrument]. The success rate of developing and
        creating golden blueprints would increase greatly, and there was also a
        small chance of creating a Space Wonder.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The most important thing was that this talent unlocked an even higher
        grade for equipment, which was the red ‘Divine Artifact' grade. However,
        this grade was not achieved through crafting but through strengthening
        the original machinery, greatly enhancing its effect. Furthermore, there
        was a limit to the number of Divine Artifacts, so one could enhance up
        to three Divine Artifacts.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, the targets that could enjoy the bonuses could be changed. The
        mechanism was similar to the Apostle Weapons. If he wanted to strengthen
        the fourth machine into a Divine Artifact equipment, he just had to take
        back the bonuses of his previous Divine Artifact equipment. (Energy
        Base&mdash;God of All Machines] was also a core talent, similar to
        Sorokin's (Spiritual Energy Foundation). The effect of this skill was
        that the basic unit of energy production was no longer limited to one's
        cells. Machinery and virtual data could also generate energy. If Han
        Xiao turned himself into a mechanical or Virtual Lifeform, or if he did
        any reproductive modifications to himself, there would be no difference
        from before, and his strength would not be affected. This meant that he
        could already exist without his physical body.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        From this perspective, the fusion of Herberlon's body with machinery was
        just an incomplete version of this ability. The (Energy Base-God of All
        Machines] was the final ideal state.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In addition, this talent also gave him a high Machinery Affinity bonus,
        which was very shocking In addition, his new skill (Information
        Uniqueness-Conceptual Immortality) was not an ability brought about by
        Class Advancement but a talent that had reached Grade X. Just as Han
        Xiao had guessed, after entering a new Grade, his information form had
        also changed drastically, giving him the ability to revive
        automatically.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Be it life form or network data, as long as there were information
        carriers in the entire universe that recorded his deeds, as long as he
        was not forgotten by everyone, as long as someone still recited his
        name, he would not completely perish. If he died, there would be no need
        for him to use the Sanctum to revive. He could automatically trigger an
        information state disturbance and revive in a certain region of the
        universe. This was close to eternal indestructibility.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Most importantly, the rebirth brought by this talent would not damage
        the integrity of his information. This meant that it was not like the
        Sanctum Revival, where every revival caused one to be weaker. The only
        thing that confused Han Xiao was that the Sanctum was also an
        information carrier. If (Information UniquenessConceptual Immortality)
        was usable for all situations, would he be able to survive through the
        later iterations? He did not know if there were any Transcendent Grade
        existences in the past. If this conjecture was true, then those
        Transcendents should have been left behind, which should have made a
        greater impact on the current universe.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"If only I could test it out."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Han Xiao shook his head.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He felt that the Sanctum that was ‘outside of the Three Realms was not
        part of the Five Elements'[1] probably did not belong to the information
        carrier that allowed his [Information Uniqueness-Conceptual Immortality)
        to take effect. The range of effect of this talent should only be
        limited to his current universe iteration and the secondary dimensions.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, even so, it was still powerful enough. Just like what the
        attribute interface said, everything in the world was one with him. The
        information state was the source of his existence. As long as nothing
        went wrong, he could live till the end of the universe. The three
        talents were all very useful, and the abilities were also extraordinary.
        Among them, [Mechanical Deity &ndash; Supreme Heavenly Venerate) was the
        advanced version of the Mechanical Deity… No, rather than saying that it
        was an advancement, it would be better to say that the original
        Mechanical Deity was just the prerequisite form of this skill. The
        Mechanical Deity could change its structure on its own. Similarly, it
        also had the concept of a blueprint. Some Mechanical Deity with certain
        forms would have additional bonuses.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        [Mechanical Deity &ndash; Supreme Heavenly Venerate] was one of the
        final forms of the Mechanical Deity. It was much more powerful than the
        advanced version of the Mechanical Deity that Han Xiao created. The two
        were worlds apart.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The skill introduction showed that the skills obtained from the three
        Mechanic branches were all different. (Mechanical Deity &ndash; Supreme
        Heavenly Venerate] belonged to the Virtual Branch, while the Armed
        Branch and Energy Branch's skills were respectively [Mechanical Deity
        &ndash; Universe Emperor) and [Mechanical Deity &ndash; Origin Divine
        Lord]. They corresponded to different final forms, all of which sounded
        extremely domineering.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Not only that, through his core talent (Energy Base-God of All
        Machines], he realized that when he transformed into a Mechanical Deity,
        he no longer needed a physical body as the core to provide Mechanical
        Force. He could directly turn the mechanical shell into his own!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This meant that if he truly became a Mechanical Deity, he would not even
        have to consume any energy. Even if he did not have the means to quickly
        recover his energy, he could still maintain his Mechanical Deity state
        indefinitely and live in this form!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In addition, (Life Transformation: Virtual] and [Life Transformation:
        Myriad Machine) had similar effects. These two abilities could change
        one's life form, and with the blessing of [Energy Base-God of All
        Machines), the body was no longer a shackle. At the same time, these two
        skills could not only be used on oneself but also on others. As long as
        the judgment was successful, the target could be instantly transformed
        into a stream of virtual data or mechanical body, changing the form of
        the other party's existence. It could make an entire planet turn into a
        mechanical or virtual life form. This ability was infinitesimally close
        to the power of a God. (Virtual Creation (Pseudo)] was even more
        unbelievable. According to the skill introduction, this ability was
        similar to the virtual transformation ability of the World Tree. It
        could turn the things created in the virtual world into physical
        objects, like a true god of creation. However, the reason why this
        ability had a ‘pseudo' suffix was that there were many restrictions.
        Firstly, it was impossible to convert items that did not exist in
        reality, things that he did not know, and things that went against the
        natural laws. Secondly, the conversion would require an equivalent
        amount of resources. For example, the data of a mechanical army would
        have to be copied in the virtual world, and the corresponding materials
        would have to be prepared. However, using this skill meant that the
        process of manufacturing could be skipped, making it very suitable for
        mass production of soldiers.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Similarly, it was very useful in the manufacturing aspect. Even the
        Universal
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Treasures that he knew of could be mass-produced using this method. The
        success rate was almost 100%. However, the third limitation was that the
        transformation was temporary. Once the time was up, it would
        disintegrate on its own and would not last permanently. "This ability
        can be considered a Space Wonder in the eyes of ordinary people. It's
        called Virtual Technology, but it should be an information form ability.
        I need to study it more…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Han Xiao exhaled.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Although (Virtual Creation (Pseudo)] was miraculous, because of these
        restrictions, it was not as powerful. But it still remained useful.
        Through (Godly Stronghold), it could also temporarily explode with a
        large number of soldiers, but it was still far from the true Space
        Wonder like the World Tree. "However, this ability is quite similar to
        the World Tree. Will there be any connection…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Han Xiao's eyes sparkled, and he had a bold idea.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Maybe if the World Tree ate him, it would be able to make up for its
        deficiencies. On the other hand, if he rooted out the World Tree, he
        might be able to make up for the deficit of the skill…

      </h1>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao shook his head and temporarily threw this thought out.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The location of the World Tree was still unknown, so it was best not to
        think too much.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He turned to look at the (Tyracles Mechanical Legacy) on his Talent
        interface. This ability would unlock new exclusive blueprints when he
        was level 360. Although he had a rich technological foundation, no
        Mechanic would complain about having too many golden blueprints.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Back when the (Tyracles Mechanical Legacy] was at Lv 320, it unlocked
        the King and the Emperor's Cape. The former was still very useful.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This time, he unlocked three golden blueprints at level 360. Han Xiao
        opened the blueprint introduction and looked at it.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        (Blueprint &ndash; Dark Energy Gold Furnace Beast): After the Saint
        Tyracles Race witnessed the greatness of the Mechanical Deity, they
        developed a series of special equipment specially designed for the
        Mechanical Deity. (Blueprint-Emperor Skysplitter Blade]: After the Saint
        Tyracles Race witnessed the greatness of the Mechanical Deity, they
        developed a series of special equipment specially designed for the
        Mechanical Deity.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        (Blueprint-Space Constants Modifier (Incomplete)]: The Ultimate
        Technology of the Saint Tyracles Race has yet to be completed.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"This…"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Han Xiao's mouth twitched.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Of the five gold blueprints brought by (Tyracles Mechanical Legacy),
        three of them were equipment specially made for the Mechanical Deity. He
        finally saw how passionate this race was toward the Mechanical Deity.
        The Dark Gold Furnace Beast was an external special body. Its
        introduction was that it could share the power of the descent of the
        Mechanical Deity and had its own consciousness, serving as the mount of
        the Mechanical Deity. As for Emperor Skysplitter Blade, it was a large
        high-tech compound weapon. Its appearance was similar to a double-headed
        broadsword, and its blade was straight and wide. It had a lot of empty
        slots and could integrate different parts.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao summoned the 3D model and briefly outlined the appearance of a
        Mechanical Deity. He then loaded the Emperor's Robe, Dark Gold Furnace
        Beast, and Emperor Skysplitter Blade. Although the image was majestic,
        he felt that it was becoming more and more familiar.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "It looks more and more like Lord Guan Yu? It's just that the weapon
        doesn't match… Wait, why does it look a little like Thanos?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Han Xiao mumbled softly, not knowing what to say.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        These Saint Tyracles scientists, who were fanatical about the Mechanical
        Deity, spent all their time researching and changing equipment. Did they
        think they were making mecha skins ?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Furthermore, the names of these blueprints, these scientists from the
        Saint Tyracles Race more or less had eighth-grader syndrome…
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao had the technology foundation of Jayz's treasure and the
        Sanctum, so he did not lack gold blueprints for the Mechanical Deity.
        While these two blueprints were quite powerful, they did not provide
        much help. However, he realized that the Emperor's Cape, the Dark Gold
        Furnace Beast, and the Emperor Skysplitter Blade actually had set
        effects, which was rare.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        When all three items were activated at the same time, they could trigger
        a special set effect called ‘Tyracles' Frenzy'. With the enhancement of
        1.1x in total Machinery Affinity, attack, defense, and physical
        performance, it was not bad.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        What made Han Xiao excited was the last blueprint. The Saint Tyracles
        Race had a very deep understanding of space. This Space Constants
        Modifier, as its name suggested, could adjust the spatial structure of a
        region and change the universe constants.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The principle of this device involved the microscopic expansion of the
        universe and the collapse of the universe, as well as the technology of
        raising and lowering dimensions. According to the theory, it should have
        special effects such as extending or shrinking space, overlapping areas,
        intercepting or grafting spaces, and the changes to the area would be
        permanent. There was no time limit, and it was a strategic-level
        mechanical device.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        For example, if the enemy was only three days away from him, this device
        could expand or shrink the strategic depth of the distance between the
        two sides. According to the limit of its effect, it could expand the
        three-day journey to more than ten days or even a few months, or it
        could even shorten the distance between them to an inch.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, it was a pity that these were all theoretical conjectures.
        Before the Saint Tyracles Race could perfect this device, they were
        already destroyed by their enemies in the exploration era. If they could
        perfect this technology, the three Universal Civilizations might become
        the four Universal Civilizations or even the only civilization. However,
        there were no ifs in this world.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Most of the technology left behind by the Saint Tyracles Race has been
        inherited by the Federation of Light. I wonder if they have this
        incomplete blueprint…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Han Xiao stroked his chin and pondered.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Space Constants Modifier was much more powerful than the World
        Tree's Lerbo Space Protection Belt. If the Federation of Light had this
        technology, they would have used it back then. However, he could not
        rule out the possibility that it was incomplete.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After pondering for a while, Han Xiao shook his head and stopped
        thinking about it.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Regardless of whether the Federation of Light had it or not, he had it.
        If not for the talent (Tyracles Mechanical Legacy), he would not have
        had the chance to obtain it.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Beep beep beep… Just as Han Xiao was studying his new ability, his
        communicator suddenly rang. He received a message from the leaders of
        the three Universal Civilizations.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Heh, it's finally here."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Han Xiao glanced at it and was not surprised.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The three Universal Civilizations would not be able to sit still after
        he opened up a new level of individual strength. They would come to talk
        to him sooner or later, but they did not come to him immediately after
        he advanced. They probably heard from Wuornos that he wanted to
        familiarize himself with his strength, so they did not dare disturb him.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After replying to a message, Han Xiao turned on his remote projection.
        His vision changed, and he was already in the conference room of the
        three Universal Civilizations' leaders. He saw three people sitting side
        by side.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The three of them sized Han Xiao up carefully. Their faces were
        expressionless, and no one knew what they were thinking.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Ahem, Black Star, I heard that you have broken through the upper limit
        of the Beyond Grade A realm and entered a new level of power.
        Congratulations, you have pioneered a new path."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Marbruce forced a smile and nodded.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">"It was just luck," Han Xiao said humbly.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Is that so…"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Marbruce froze.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">You seem to be the least qualified to say that…</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At this moment, Han Xiao suddenly smiled at the Pope and said, "By the
        way, I haven't thanked you for your help. It's all thanks to you guys
        agreeing to lend me the Church's National Treasure. Otherwise, I
        wouldn't have been able to advance."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">IIII</p>
      <p class="calibre3">The corners of the Pope's eyes twitched.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Provocation, this was definitely provocation!</p>
      <p class="calibre3">The moment he thought of this, he regretted</p>
      <p class="calibre3">it.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In his eyes, Han Xiao was mocking him for making a loss deal!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Pope looked at Han Xiao's smile and felt extremely disgusted. He
        wished he could pick up the cup on the table and smash it on Han Xiao's
        head.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At this moment, Marbruce and Louis turned to look at him with a strange
        look in their eyes. They seemed to be blaming him for betraying their
        plan.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, the two of them did not expect to see the Pope furious. The
        Pope took a deep breath to calm down, revealed an unfathomable smile,
        and said righteously,
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "You're welcome. You've entered a higher level, which is beneficial to
        the battle. Of course, we won't be stingy."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao raised his brows. It seemed that Wuornos had indeed reported
        this to the upper echelons of the church, and he was probably eager to
        copy his method to advance. The Pope's behavior this time was obviously
        because he thought Wuornos would be able to step into the Transcendent
        Grade very soon, so he felt that it was not a loss and had some
        confidence.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Tsk, don't blame me then. You were the one who couldn't help it…'
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Han Xiao curled his lips.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Frankly speaking, when he invited Wuornos to help him advance, he really
        did not intend to trick him. At the very least, the Arcane Church's
        National Treasure and the five elements combined were all real
        advancement conditions.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, Han Xiao did not plan to tell anyone about the secret of the
        Beyonder's Vestige. If Wuornos was determined to advance, he could only
        sit back and watch.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After all, Wuornos did not seem to want to participate in the battle. It
        did not matter to him whether he was dead or alive. In any case, even if
        he was dead, he could still display his use as Beyonder's Vestige. Han
        Xiao did not mind at all…
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, after fulfilling two Promotion conditions, the success rate of
        the Promotion would increase by at least two-thirds. As long as Wuornos'
        luck was not as bad as his, the Promotion would not be a problem…
        However, without the Beyonder's Vestige, he could only trigger the
        regular Promotion. When he completed the Promotion excitedly, he would
        realize that he had not broken through the limit of the grade. Han Xiao
        wondered what expression he would have.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao calmed himself down and casually asked, "You guys contacted me
        to congratulate?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "This is a historical event, after all. We would like to ask if you want
        to make it public to the galactic society."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Louis nodded and asked.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "There's no need to publicize it. We're still fighting. We don't know if
        the World Tree will steal the intelligence on the Internet in the
        future. It's enough for the upper echelons to know."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Han Xiao shook his head.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Seeing that the three of them had no objections, he suddenly turned to
        Marbruce and said,
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Speaking of which, I still need the dynasty's help."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"What is it?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "I plan to send EsGod into the Underworld after some time and make use
        of him on the battlefield."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"This…"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Marbruce hesitated.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The dynasty had sealed EsGod for so long mainly because they wanted to
        study EsGod's body after his soul was destroyed. Marbruce did not want
        to agree to this request, and he was also not willing to see the
        Underworld gain more experts. Seeing his hesitation, Han Xiao's eyes
        sparkled.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "In exchange, I can provide you with a very interesting piece of
        information."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"What information?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Gaud's whereabouts." Han Xiao smiled.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Marbruce's pupils constricted.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Although he had guessed that it was Black Star who had caused Gaud's
        disappearance, he could not help but feel furious upon hearing him admit
        it.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Thinking about how they had been fooled by Black Star back then and
        caused a huge storm, Marbruce's face sank. He endured his anger and
        shouted,
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"…So it was you!"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao did not mind. He waved his hand and said, "Don't be angry. I
        have a reason for doing this. If you are willing to agree to this deal,
        I will tell you the reason and give you Gaud's whereabouts."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Marbruce clenched his fists.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Black Star only revealed his cards now, which was undoubtedly related to
        the recent advancement. There was only one reason for him to do so, and
        that was that the strength of a Transcendent was beyond imagination. He
        no longer had to worry about the revenge of the advanced civilizations,
        which was why Black Star could reveal this secret without a care!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The strength of a Transcendent was still a mystery. They only knew that
        it was higher than a Beyond Grade A but other than Black Star, no one
        knew how strong it was. The unknown was the most terrifying.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        With Black Star's current confidence, it was clear that the strength of
        a Transcendent was no small matter. In fact, he had even chosen to show
        his cards at this time to show his might!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Thinking up to this point, Marbruce suddenly felt a strong sense of
        fear. The current situation did not allow for internal conflict. He had
        no choice but to suppress the anger in his heart and think about Black
        Star's suggestion.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After a while, he nodded expressionlessly and said coldly,
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "EsGod can be given to you, but we have to exchange for Gaud. I only
        hope that your reason will satisfy us."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Don't worry, you'll definitely be satisfied."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Han Xiao did not mind it.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He had chosen this moment to show his cards because he wanted to strike
        while the iron was hot. His strength had advanced, if he did not show
        anything and continued to maintain their original relationship, the
        three Universal Civilizations might feel that he did not have much
        confidence. It was time to take a step forward, to pressure them and
        squeeze more benefits out of them. At the same time, he would let the
        three Universal Civilizations see his ‘unbridled' attitude, which would
        make them even more afraid of his strength after advancing
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Of course, the reason he did this was that the three Universal
        Civilizations could not do without the help of the association and
        because he did not need to fear the three Universal Civilizations
        anymore.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Some of the ‘crimes' left behind in history could be brought up to the
        public since the three Universal Civilizations could no longer flip the
        table.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Furthermore, it was not a good idea to keep Gaud locked up. The matter
        had to be resolved eventually. He had to tell the dynasty what had
        happened. In the future, if Evans obtained the Energy Control Esper
        Ability, he could use it openly. After glancing at the three of them,
        Han Xiao did not say anything. He deactivated the remote projection and
        disappeared from the room.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Only then did the three of them relax. They looked at each other with
        subtle expressions.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In this meeting, they mainly wanted to see if Black Star's attitude had
        changed after his Promotion.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Back when the Beyond Grade As first appeared, they also had a huge
        impact on the structure of the universe. Although they did not know how
        large the gap in strength with the new level was this time, it would
        definitely not be too weak. Black Star was already recognized as the
        leader of the Beyond Grade As, and now that he had taken a step forward,
        the three of them had no choice but to reconsider how they should treat
        Black Star.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Before the meeting, the three of them had already come to a consensus to
        react according to the situation. If Black Star's attitude did not
        change, they would treat him the same way they treated him in the past
        and treat him the same way in the future. They would pretend that the
        Promotion did not happen and not make any additional gestures.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, Black Star's attitude made their plans fall through. Seeing how
        fearless he was, the three of them felt their hearts sink. They knew
        that the scales of cooperation between the two sides were going to tip
        toward the association again.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, they could not do without Black Star. The three of them did not
        dare to do anything anymore and were completely helpless.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Two days later, the Beyond Grade A Association.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        There were no empty seats in the venue. All the association members had
        been summoned to attend this temporary meeting.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Everyone looked at Han Xiao with shock, excitement, and disbelief.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In the past few days, a rumor had spread among the upper echelons of the
        association, claiming that Black Star had broken through the Beyond
        Grade A realm and opened a new level.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At first, not many people believed it, but as more and more association
        members learned about it, many of them became skeptical.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao looked at everyone's expression and smiled.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "I gathered all of you today to announce something. From the looks of
        it, you should have heard about it in the past few days."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Hearing this, many people's eyes narrowed.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Black Star, is that rumor true?" Manison frowned in disbelief.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao looked at him, then at the others who were staring at him,
        nodded, and said with a sonorous tone,
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "That's right. I've already stepped into the realm above Beyond Grade A,
        and I've named it Transcendent Grade. From now on, Beyond Grade A is no
        longer the limit of individual strength… Everyone, there's still a path
        ahead!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Everyone was shocked! Everyone stared at Han Xiao in shock, unable to
        speak. The room fell into a strange silence.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-1390">

        Chapter 1391: Meeting and Promotion<span hidden="" class="calibre1">

        </span>
      </h1>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Looking at the stunned expressions on everyone's faces, Han Xiao knew
        that practicality was the most important thing. He released the pressure
        of his life level, and a solid aura gushed out. The air in the room
        seemed to have turned into a sticky gel, making it difficult for people
        to move.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        A crushing pressure suddenly crashed into the hearts of the Beyond Grade
        As. Their expressions changed, and they instinctively became nervous.
        Their nerves tensed up, and the cells in their bodies began to pump out
        energy like wild cats facing their enemies.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Right at that moment, the pressure disappeared like a receding tide.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Only then did everyone come back to their senses. They could no longer
        sit still. "Black Star, how did you do it ?" Someone was extremely
        shocked.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Quick, quick, tell us how to break through to the Transcendent Grade!"
        Someone could not wait.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Who would have thought… who would have thought that there would really
        be a higher level? I thought that Beyond Grade A was the limit of
        individual strength…" someone mumbled.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The majority of the Beyond Grade As were in an uproar. This situation
        looked no different from when the Calamity Grade students pestered
        Feidin when he advanced to the Beyond Grade A realm.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao waved his hand and casually said, "The failure rate of the
        Promotion is very high. I was just lucky."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Hearing this, Secret Master wisely chose to shut his mouth, not daring
        to refute.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        To everyone, Black Star's Promotion was too sudden, and it was difficult
        for them to digest. Other than a few people who knew about it, most
        Beyond Grade As could not contain their panic and shock.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Throughout history, generations of geniuses had never been able to break
        through the limits of individual strength. Many people even thought that
        Beyond Grade A was the limit of individual strength. They did not expect
        Black Star to not only break through it but do it at such a young age.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Although they knew that Black Star was the most accomplished Super in
        history, the significance behind breaking this publicly recognized limit
        was completely different.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At this moment, in the eyes of everyone, Han Xiao was like a shining
        guide, a pioneer. His image had once again enlarged.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "You…" Manison hesitated. Black Star had opened a new level without
        showing himself, which made him feel very complicated.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Originally, although Black Star was powerful, they were still at the
        same level. Although Manison was much more benevolent now, he still had
        some unwillingness to admit defeat. If there was a chance, he would
        still chase after the competition.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        But now, the gap between the two of them had completely widened.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Manison was watching how Black Star caught up to him step by step and
        left him far behind. Even now, he could not even see Black Star's back.
        Even with his firm heart, he could not help but feel disappointed.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">This time, Kant spoke.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Black Star, you don't have to be humble. If not for you, this limit
        would still be an insurmountable obstacle in the eyes of the entire
        Beyond Grade A group."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">His tone was filled with envy but also excitement.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The other Beyond Grade As were the same. Of course, some were envious
        and jealous, and many felt bitter. However, most of them still thought
        that they had a huge reliance now!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        If an unfamiliar and neutral Beyond Grade A had reached the new level,
        they would be so envious that they would want to replace him. However,
        if this Pioneer was Black Star, they could accept it and be happy.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        On one hand, Black Star's reputation among the Beyond Grade As had
        already reached an unprecedented level. On the other hand, he was the
        leader of the association and had obtained so many benefits for the
        Beyond Grade As. He had long become one of them.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Due to Black Star's methods and the temptation of the Sanctum, the
        Beyond Grade As had already formed a close community of interests. The
        stronger the leader, the more important their Beyond Grade A group would
        be in the universe.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">ma</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Furthermore, Black Star was the source of the Sanctum Revival. The
        stronger he was, the more guarantee their revivals would have, so it was
        naturally worth everyone's happiness. Furthermore, many Beyond Grade As
        believed that Black Star, as the leader of the association, would more
        or less impart them with some experience of breaking through. No matter
        how they thought about it, there was nothing to lose.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After understanding all the details, most of the Beyond Grade As present
        became even more excited. They looked at Han Xiao with even more
        admiration.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Not only did Black Star bring the Sanctum Revival, but he also pointed
        out the direction of individual strength. Everyone felt that his
        leadership position had never been as legitimate as it was now. Han Xiao
        looked at everyone's excited, respectful, and admiring expressions and
        smiled.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "It's fine as long as only we know about this. Don't spread it around.
        By the way, the upper echelons of the three Universal Civilizations
        already know about it, so don't worry about them… As for the advancement
        method that everyone is concerned about, I just happened to succeed. I
        still need to familiarize myself with the power of the new grade. When I
        have a stable method of advancement, I'll share it with you. Forget it
        for now." Beyoni's eyes lit up. "Will you tell us all for free?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "…Guess?" Han Xiao glanced at him as though he was looking at a lifelong
        daydreamer.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"I guess not." Beyoni smiled.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">"You're smart."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Han Xiao rolled his eyes.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Hearing this, the Beyond Grade As present did not have any objections.
        The method to advance to the Transcendent Grade was so precious that
        even they would not easily reveal it, had it been them who had advanced.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kasuyi, who was at the side, felt that Wuornos had already grasped the
        method to advance, so keeping this secret to the association did not
        seem to be of much use. However, he would not jump out to object.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        With his current trust in Han Xiao, he felt that Han Xiao's every action
        had a deeper meaning.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This time, Beiger could not help but ask out of curiosity, "I wonder if
        we can take a look at the strength of a Transcendent…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Before he could finish, Han Xiao interrupted him.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "The war is not over yet. You will see it sooner or later. I won't show
        it now."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Hearing this, everyone could only nod.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao looked around and saw that someone still wanted to speak. He
        immediately said, "Everyone, today is just to announce this matter and
        let everyone understand the situation. The meeting will end here.
        Everyone, please leave. I still have some things to arrange."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Everyone was stunned. They originally had a belly full of questions to
        ask, but seeing that Han Xiao did not seem to want to answer, they could
        only swallow these questions.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Beyond Grade As tactfully stood up and left the conference room with
        excitement that had yet to dissipate.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Now that they were no longer Supers of the same level, they
        subconsciously became more obedient to Han Xiao's orders. Han Xiao
        watched as the Beyond Grade As left one after another, but there were
        still some who did not leave. Hila and the other army officers
        surrounded him with shock.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        They had not received any conclusive news before this, so they were just
        as surprised as the others.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Come, let's have a few rounds. Let me experience the higher level of
        strength." Hila went straight to the point. "Go away. I'm not in the
        mood to abuse you today."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Han Xiao pushed her aside.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Feidin ignored this and sincerely congratulated, "Congratulations."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After saying that, he could not help but sigh. He had originally thought
        that he had slightly caught up to Black Star after advancing to the
        Beyond Grade A realm, but in just a brief moment, the gap was greatly
        pulled apart.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao smiled and nodded. He did not say anything and only patted his
        shoulder.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This time, Ames walked up and smiled. "What do you plan to do next?".
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Plan? The same as before, continue to prepare for war," Han Xiao
        replied. He suddenly thought of something and said while rubbing his
        chin, "But in terms of private matters, I do want to reproduce." Ames
        raised her brows. "With who?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Are you willing?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Ames hesitated for a moment before shaking her head.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Then I can only think of another way." Han Xiao spread out his hands
        with a tinge of regret.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "What are you going to do?" Ames narrowed her eyes.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Let me see if I can use my cells to cultivate some test-tube babies
        through gene modification." Han Xiao turned to look at Aurora, who was a
        little confused, and said thoughtfully, "Also, if I use my blood and
        bones to fuse with her life energy, I should be able to mass-produce
        offspring." "…Up to you then." Ames regained her composure, shook her
        head, and laughed. "Your idea of reproducing is really like a Mechanic."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "What do you mean ‘like a'? I am a Mechanic." Han Xiao did not care.
        "Industrialization is the way to go."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        War was imminent, and it would be too late for him to give birth one by
        one. He needed a batch of high-quality Supers who had inherited his
        Racial Talents, so there was no point in having too few.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        To obtain a large enough descendant race, the usual method was to turn
        into a breeding pig and mate with the opposite sex of the native race.
        Only males could do this. However, Han Xiao was not interested in this.
        He was simply going to use the Mechanic method to mass-produce
        offspring. He did not need to capture the females of other races like
        the Beast Ancestor. He could reproduce without any gender and be
        self-sufficient.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Although the offspring raised with this method were more standardized,
        it was worth a try. After all, it was kind of a waste of resources to
        have such great Racial Talents but not make use of them. Anyway, he did
        not lack money or manpower, so raising an entire race was not a problem.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao did not mention this matter anymore. He turned to look at Hila
        and said, "Don't return to Soul Terminal during this time. I am bringing
        you to do something."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"What?" Hila was curious.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Kill EsGod," Han Xiao said.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Hila's eyes flashed, and she immediately understood what he meant. She
        narrowed her eyes and said, "EsGod is a very powerful combatant. If he
        enters the Underworld, he should immediately become the strongest among
        the Hero Spirits. Furthermore, without the restriction of the genetic
        chain, he might be even stronger than when he was alive!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"That's right." Han Xiao nodded.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He had never underestimated EsGod. Even among the peak Beyond Grade As,
        EsGod, who was in his complete form, was an extremely powerful
        individual. What Han Xiao paid the most attention to was EsGod's Esper
        Ability[Esper Silence]!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This was the nemesis of almost all Espers. Back then, he had used this
        Character Summon Card to cause EsGod to fail miserably.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Now that the war with the World Tree was blazing, he felt that it was
        time to let this trump card see the light of day again.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Feidin blinked and said with doubt, "Strange, the dynasty should not be
        willing to see the Underworld continue to grow. They actually agreed to
        this request?" Han Xiao smiled and shrugged.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "That's because I gave them an irresistible reason."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Beep beep beep…</p>
      <p class="calibre3">His communicator rang.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao paused and took out his communicator. Suddenly, his eyes
        sparkled.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The few of them had been paying attention to his expression, and they
        could not help but lean their heads over to take a look.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "What happened? Why are you so happy?" Aurora was curious.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Han Xiao put away his communicator and laughed.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "My luck has changed in the past few days. I didn't expect double
        happiness. The army is going to have a new Deputy Army Commander!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Everyone's spirits were lifted. "Hadavy, Jotina, or Lagi?" Feidin
        guessed. "None of them." Han Xiao smiled and shook his head. "This guy's
        name is Evans. Let's go and meet him."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Hearing this, everyone was shocked and looked at each other.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Evans? Among the Beyond Grade A seeds that joined later, there did not
        seem to be such a character. They did not know him. Could it be that he
        was secretly trained by the Army Commander ?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        On the other side, on a desolate planet in the territory of the Black
        Star Army.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Streams of light flashed past and Han Xiao, Feidin, and the others had
        already arrived outside the atmosphere. They immediately discovered the
        source of the energy fluctuations on the planet. It was a Calamity Grade
        Super undergoing the final transformation to the Beyond Grade A realm.
        They had all experienced this stage before, so they were naturally
        familiar with it.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao adjusted his vision and looked through the vortex-like energy.
        He could clearly see Evans, who was at the center, and he could not help
        but smile with satisfaction.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        First, Feidin became a Beyond Grade A, followed closely by Evans.
        Thinking about it, the time it took for Evans to become a Super was not
        as long as Feidin's, which meant that he had reached Beyond Grade A in
        an even shorter time.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The ‘Second EsGod Cultivation Plan' that he had set up decades ago was
        now more than half complete. There was only one step left.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "I originally wanted to deal with Gaud after some time, but since Evans
        has already entered the Beyond Grade A realm, I can solve the problem
        with EsGod together."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Han Xiao's eyes sparkled.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Ancient Star Desert, Holy Accord Organization.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "What? Black Star has opened up a new level of strength ?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Oathkeeper was stunned.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As an important partner, he was not an outsider. Under Han Xiao's
        approval, Beiger had already sent the message to the Holy Accord.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Compared to the shock and excitement of the Holy Accord Beyond Grade As,
        Oathkeeper's vision turned black.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        F*ck, I've completely become someone else's underling now. There's no
        hope of turning the tables!

      </h1>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao and the others waited for a while until the energy storm
        gradually stopped.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Evans' talent was too outstanding, and his advancement process was
        smooth. He successfully advanced to Beyond Grade A, and the energy in
        his body overflowed from his eyes. His eyes were like two small suns
        that slowly extinguished under his deliberate control. He let out a long
        breath. The sudden surge in strength caused the breath he exhaled to be
        like a shockwave, creating a hurricane on the ground. The ground that
        had already been corroded by the energy into a ring-shaped crater,
        shattered into pieces. After all, Evans had only advanced to Beyond
        Grade A, the power that he released during his Promotion would not be
        enough to blow up a planet. The only thing that would suffer was the
        surrounding area. It was as if the ground had been dug up by dogs.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Before he could familiarize himself with his new strength, Evans noticed
        Han Xiao and the others in outer space.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Without waiting for him to go up, Han Xiao landed in front of him with
        Hila and the others.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Well done. I knew you would be able to reach this level easily. Your
        Promotion time is also earlier than I expected." "This is all thanks to
        your nurturing. I originally planned to inform you after my Promotion
        and give you a surprise, but I didn't expect you to come personally.
        However, nothing in the army can be hidden from you."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Evans nodded and maintained his humble attitude, not affected by the
        sudden increase in strength.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao squeezed his shoulder to show his appreciation, then turned
        around and saw Feidin and the others looking at Evans curiously. He
        could not help but smile and say,
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Come, let me introduce you guys. This is Evans. I've secretly trained
        him for decades… As for them, there's no need for me to introduce them.
        You should recognize all of them. They're all veterans in the army and
        my good friends."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Hello." Evans nodded at everyone and bowed slightly.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Ames smiled and nodded. Hila nodded coldly, and Feidin and Aurora
        replied politely.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Don't underestimate this guy." Han Xiao pressed on Evans' shoulder and
        said with a smile, "A few decades ago, he was just an ordinary person.
        The time he took to advance to Beyond Grade A from zero almost caught up
        to my record. His talent should be second among the Calamity Grade
        officers in the army."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "That powerful?" Aurora was shocked. "Then who's first?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "I'm not telling you. You guys will know when he becomes a Beyond Grade
        A."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Han Xiao rubbed Aurora's nose and smiled.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He was naturally referring to Karlot. If Karlot was guided correctly
        from the start, Karlot's efficiency in becoming a Beyond Grade A might
        have even been faster than Evans'. However, he had wasted a long time in
        the dynasty before receiving his teachings, so he did not have the
        chance to break the record.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Aurora curled her lips, clearly dissatisfied with Han Xiao's secrecy.
        However, she could not do anything about it. She looked at Evans,
        blinked, and said, "Brother, what ability user are you?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Hearing this, Hila and the others also stared at Evans. They were all
        very curious about what kind of ability it was that made Black Star
        think so highly of him and even secretly groom him for decades.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Facing the attention of the upper echelons of the army, Evans was not
        nervous at all. He slowly said, "My ability is to absorb other people's
        Esper Abilities for my own use."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Oh, so it's absorbing… Hmm?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Aurora subconsciously said half a sentence, but she was suddenly
        stunned.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Hila and the others were shocked and looked at Evans with a strange
        expression.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After a few seconds of silence, Ames said with uncertainty,
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Black Star… if I'm not mistaken, his ability is similar to EsGod's?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Not really." Han Xiao chuckled. "It's exactly the same."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Hearing this, the expressions of the group changed slightly. They
        quietly took a few steps back, not hiding their fear at all. At the same
        time, they looked at Evans and Black Star with even more strange eyes,
        finally understanding something.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This guy's ability is the same as EsGod's. Could he be EsGod's
        illegitimate son ?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Where did Black Star find this guy?</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        No wonder they had to secretly groom him. If others knew that the Black
        Star Army was grooming a new ‘EsGod', it would cause a huge backlash.
        The Army Commander was as bold as ever!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Everyone quickly thought about it.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Seeing the expressions of Hila and the others, Han Xiao knew what they
        were thinking. He shook his head and said,
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Don't worry, Evans is different from EsGod. He's a good guy, and he
        won't casually absorb Esper Abilities."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Hehe."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Aurora pulled the corners of her mouth and laughed stiffly.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Hila was not moved, and her expression remained solemn. In a sense,
        Evans was the nemesis of all Espers. Although the Esper Abilities of the
        two sisters were very powerful, they were still things that could be
        taken away by the other party. The purpose of this guy's existence was
        more than his combat power. He was a trump card!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Evans did not mind the fear of the others. He had long accepted the fate
        brought about by this Esper Ability and acted as if he did not see their
        vigilance. He turned to Han Xiao and said with a smile that he was not
        used to, "Your Excellency Black Star, I have yet to congratulate you on
        stepping to a new level. This news stimulated me and helped me take the
        last step, which is how I completed the final transformation."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Is that so? Looks like you owe me another favor." Han Xiao chuckled.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After he had advanced to the Transcendent Grade, he had asked Phillip to
        privately tell the two golden leeks, Karlot and Evans. Firstly, it was
        to stimulate them to work hard, and secondly, although the two of them
        were loyal enough, they still had to continue consolidating their
        position. It was naturally a good method to display their new strength.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Only these two people received such treatment. After all, they could not
        participate in the Beyond Grade A Conference. If he did not inform them,
        they would not know.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "You're already a Beyond Grade A, do you have any plans?" Han Xiao asked
        as usual.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "You don't have to ask me. I made my stand back then and stayed in the
        army to serve you. This is my only choice." Evans did not hesitate at
        all.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Hearing this, Han Xiao smiled and nodded.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "That's right… Speaking of which, the timing of your Promotion is quite
        coincidental. As I said, I'll give you a gift when you become a Beyond
        Grade A Super. I'll give it to you now."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"I'm looking forward to it," Evans said calmly.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao snapped his fingers, and a large number of mechanical soldiers
        appeared, placing a Spacetime Amber on the field.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Everyone looked over and saw a coffin-like mechanical device sealed in
        the Spacetime Amber. No one knew who was inside.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Sweeping his gaze across the curious faces of the crowd, Han Xiao's lips
        curled up slightly, and he immediately removed the amber. The mechanical
        device slammed onto the ground, then quickly disintegrated, turning into
        tiny snake-like mechanical particles that swam back to Han Xiao.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The person locked up inside was revealed, falling onto the ground with a
        thud, still in the heavily injured state of being sealed.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        With just one look, the faces of Hila, Ames, Feidin, and Aurora changed.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"This is… Gaud ".</p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Why is he in your hands P"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">For a moment, everyone was dumbfounded.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Back then, Gaud's disappearance had caused the dynasty to be furious and
        caused a huge commotion in the universe. Black Star had even been
        invited to solve the case and acted as a detective. The few of them had
        always thought that this had nothing to do with Han Xiao.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        From the looks of it now, could it be that Black Star was the one who
        had called the shots ?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Everyone looked at Han Xiao in shock. How many things did this guy do
        behind the scenes? He really was a mastermind!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Don't look at me like that. I did this for a reason. This kid has a lot
        of secrets on him." Han Xiao clicked his tongue and pointed at Gaud, who
        was on the verge of death. "He's a pure dynasty direct descendant. In
        fact, he's the main consciousness that EsGod separated. He always wanted
        to communicate with the World Tree, so I killed him. Don't think that
        I'm deliberately suppressing the dynasty's potential direct descendant."
        "Heh, keep making things up." Aurora rolled her eyes.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao glared at her and could not be bothered with her. He released a
        ball of Mechanical Force from his palm and turned it into a lightning
        chain, binding Gaud's hands and feet, holding him in midair.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "EsGod, how does it feel to see the light of day again?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Hah… hah… I don't know what you're talking about!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Gaud panted heavily. He was still in a state of exhaustion. After being
        locked up for decades, he stubbornly guarded his thoughts and forced
        himself to remember the conversation between Han Xiao and him before he
        was sealed. Although he did not know why he was released at this moment,
        he remained cautious and did not want to give himself away.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Furthermore, he could sense that the people around him were all Beyond
        Grade As, and only Evans was a stranger. Furthermore, he had seen the
        information of Hila, Ames, and the others, so he could not take the
        risk.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Han Xiao shook his head.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Hehe, I know you're still counting on the dynasty to save you, but it's
        been decades since you were captured, and the times have changed. Now
        that the World Tree has invaded, the three Universal Civilizations have
        reached an agreement with us to fight the foreign enemies together. Not
        to mention that you have ulterior motives, even if you're a pure direct
        descendant, the dynasty will not fall out with us."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Gaud's pupils constricted. It had only been a few decades, and the World
        Tree had already invaded ?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">What happened during the years I was sealed ?</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Gaud clenched his teeth.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Currently, only the dynasty could save him. He would not give up his
        disguise just because of a few words. Even though he was shocked, he had
        no choice but to pretend that he knew nothing about the World Tree.
        However, after thinking about this, Gaud had a flash of insight. He
        suddenly had the wrong idea about Black Star unsealing him.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        That's right, Black Star knows that I have some information about the
        World Tree, and now that the war has broken out, maybe he wants to seek
        my help? And trying to force me to admit my identity as ‘EsGod' is to
        find a reason for him to convince the dynasty?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        It was a pity that he did not know if his main body had been released.
        Logically speaking, the first one that Black Star tried to unseal should
        be ‘EsGod's' main body…
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Gaud's eyes flickered. The effect of (Esper Ability-Rebirth] was
        complete division. Gaud had inherited the main consciousness, and
        EsGod's main body was a new personality formed from the fusion of his
        remnant soul and memories. They were already two independent
        individuals, and the soul connection between them had been cut off long
        ago. Therefore, Gaud did not know the situation of EsGod's main body at
        all.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "…I still don't understand! What World Tree? I don't even know what it
        is. Don't think of getting information out of me!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Gaud felt that he had guessed Han Xiao's intentions. He felt that the
        safety of this ‘World Tree insider' was at least guaranteed, and he
        immediately felt more confident. He did not plan to admit his identity
        with just a few words and was prepared to continue his disguise.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao glanced at him and guessed that this guy was mistaken. He shook
        his head and laughed. "I think you misunderstood something. I don't need
        the World Tree information that you have. The main reason I unsealed you
        this time is that I don't want to waste your abilities."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Oh? Is he trying to recruit me ?</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Gaud's heart skipped a beat.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        It doesn't seem impossible. The ‘Energy Control' that I created with
        great difficulty will always be a Super High-Risk Esper Ability with
        unlimited potential no matter where it is. The chances of Black Star
        taking a fancy to my ability are quite high.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Gaud could not help but feel conflicted.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        If Black Star really wants to recruit me, should I agree or reject him?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        While he was hesitating, Han Xiao had already signaled Evans to come
        forward and smiled. "He's my gift to you."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"I see, I understand."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Evans exhaled and placed his hand on Gaud's chest.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Gaud was stunned. He looked at the person in front of him, not knowing
        what Han Xiao was planning
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"What are you doing?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">"…Sorry."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Before Gaud could continue asking, a strange suction force suddenly came
        from Evans' hands. He could clearly feel his Esper genes being rapidly
        stripped away! "What?!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Gaud's expression changed drastically.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He was all too familiar with this situation. It was the situation when
        [Esper Ability &ndash; Copy) was activated!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The only difference was that he was once the person stealing other
        people's Esper Abilities, but now, he was the target!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"This is… why do you have this ability ?</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Gaud could no longer remain calm.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Seeing this, Han Xiao smiled and said with a teasing tone, "EsGod, you
        can't be thinking that you're the only one in the entire universe who
        has this ability, right? The world is very vast… I've nurtured him for
        decades to prevent him from following in your footsteps. Now that he has
        become a Beyond Grade A, he has the right to take away the ability that
        you created with countless evil deeds. How about it? Are you surprised?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "N-no… Impossible!" Gaud could feel his Esper Ability disappearing
        rapidly. His eyes were bloodshot, and his mentality exploded!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He could be sealed and killed, but he could not accept the dream Esper
        Ability that he had spent countless years to create, becoming someone
        else's!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Gaud did not want to wait for death and struggled with all his might.
        However, he could not move at all under Han Xiao's restraint.
        Furthermore, he was already heavily injured and could not stop his Esper
        Ability from being absorbed by Evans, who was at the same level as him.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As the cells withered one after another, Gaud's struggle became weaker
        and weaker. He did not even have the strength to speak. He could only
        watch himself weaken step by step, gradually losing his ability to sense
        Esper abilities. All that was left was hatred in his eyes as he stared
        at Evans in front of him as if wanting to carve his image in his heart.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Evans was not moved at all. After absorbing for a while, he suddenly
        raised his hand and finally turned the ‘Energy Control' into his own.
        This also meant that Gaud had completely lost this ability. Gaud's body
        suddenly shook, and his breath quickly weakened. He opened his mouth and
        looked at the two of them weakly. His eyes were empty and dull.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        His plans, his ambitions, everything was destroyed by Black Star…
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At this moment, Gaud had already lost all hope in life, as if he had
        become a walking corpse that had lost all his dreams.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao looked at him indifferently and released his restraints,
        allowing him to fall to the ground. He said casually, "Don't blame me.
        This is your retribution. You brought this upon yourself. You once took
        away the abilities of so many people. Today, I am just letting you have
        a taste of having your Esper Ability stolen."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Gaud lay motionless on the ground, staring blankly at the sky. "Black
        Star, kill me."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "That's going too easy on you. You're still useful. I still need you as
        a bargaining chip to negotiate with the dynasty."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao waved his hand, and mechanical particles shot out, turning back
        into an imprisonment device and enveloping Gaud. Gaud was unable to
        resist, and he was immediately locked up.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After doing all this, he turned to look at Evans, only to see that this
        guy's eyes were slightly closed, and he was familiarizing himself with
        his new Esper Ability.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Seeing this, Han Xiao smiled and said, "How do you feel? Are you
        satisfied with this gift?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As soon as he finished speaking, Evans slowly opened his eyes and
        clenched his fist. A ball of flames appeared out of thin air, constantly
        changing its energy form. Electricity, storm, nuclear energy, dark
        energy, and so on flashed past, finally turning into a dazzling psionic
        energy ball that was thrown out by him.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The dark blue light penetrated deep into the ground, and the group felt
        the ground swell up rapidly. The ground cracked, and the light from the
        lava escaped from the cracks, becoming more and more dazzling.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Boom!</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The psionic energy that penetrated deep into the Earth Core suddenly
        exploded. Beams of light penetrated the Earth Core from the inside and
        turned the entire planet into a sieve. The next moment, the planet
        expanded and exploded into pieces!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Before the planet exploded, Han Xiao and the others had already flown
        into space and looked at the formation of a new asteroid belt.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Evans retracted his hand, turned around, and gave Han Xiao a deep bow.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Your Excellency Black Star, this gift is too valuable. I will not let
        you down!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He knew the value of this gift better than anyone else. With this Esper
        Ability, as long as he could grow, he would be invincible among Beyond
        Grade As!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This was a gift from Black Star, and it was also his hope. Evans felt
        extremely touched and wished he could sacrifice his life for Han Xiao.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Since you treat me like a state scholar, I'll be sure to repay this
        country with my life!

        "There's no need for me to elaborate on the potential of this Esper
        Ability. Just this ability alone can match up to hundreds or thousands
        of Esper Abilities. Work hard and develop it."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Han Xiao smiled at Evans.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Understood." Evans nodded, feeling the burden on his shoulders become
        heavier. Hila and the others sighed at how lucky Evans was. Not only was
        he talented, but he had also received Black Star's nurturing and
        protection, so he did not have to grow like EsGod. He would definitely
        have a place among the Beyond Grade As in the future.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Everyone could not help but turn to look at Gaud, who was locked up, and
        pity flashed in their eyes.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Regardless of whether this guy had anything to do with EsGod or not,
        just this encounter alone was enough to make him miserable. He had
        thought that he would be free to do whatever he wanted after advancing
        to the Beyond Grade A realm, but he had been targeted by Black Star and
        had his abilities taken away. In the future, he could only watch others
        use his Esper Ability to soar in the universe and snatch away all the
        achievements that should have belonged to him… The few of them did not
        have a deep impression of Gaud. Now that they thought of him, they
        almost used the word ‘tragic' to replace his facial features.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "What do you plan to do with him? Leave him to the dynasty?" Hila
        suddenly frowned.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "I'll hand him over to the dynasty and explain his identity and origin.
        The dynasty will deal with the rest." Han Xiao did not mind. Hila shook
        her head. "I don't think it's appropriate. If the dynasty executes Gaud,
        he might be able to regain his abilities through the Sanctum Revival.
        Since we've already become enemies, it's better to put an end to future
        problems." "Tsk tsk, if we're talking about being ruthless, you're the
        one who's ruthless…" Han Xiao raised his brows and waved his hands.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "With the revival mechanism of the Sanctum, Gaud will most likely be
        able to regain his ability. However, the quota for the revival of the
        Sanctum is now up to me. Whether he can revive or not is up to me. Even
        if the three Universal Civilizations master the revival method on their
        own in the future, it won't be a problem. Who knows what will happen in
        the future? If there's a situation, I can just send him to the
        Underworld and have another fighter."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Fortunately, Gaud was already locked up by the imprisonment device and
        could not hear anything from the outside. Otherwise, he would be even
        more hopeless. This time, Han Xiao changed the topic and smiled at
        everyone.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Alright, everyone knows each other now. After some time, I will promote
        him to the Deputy Army Commander and let him join the association."
        "Isn't it a little too early?" Evans could not help but ask. "My ability
        is easily feared. Should I continue to hide my identity?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "You're already a Beyond Grade A, so it's time for you to make a name
        for yourself. Besides, you're going to participate in the battle, so
        practicing your cooperation with others in advance is also useful." Han
        Xiao squeezed his shoulder and said, "Furthermore, with me around, you
        don't have to worry about the hidden arrows behind your back. Other than
        enemies, no one can do anything to you." "Alright."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Evans nodded.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Training in secret for decades was naturally very difficult.
        Furthermore, he had just advanced to the Beyond Grade A realm, and it
        was time for him to make a name for himself. Although he felt that
        continuing to hide his identity was the best choice from Black Star's
        perspective, he did not want to continue hiding. Knowing that he could
        finally debut made him happy.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The others naturally did not have any objections, but they were
        muttering in their hearts. With such a powerful person joining them, he
        would definitely be the strongest Deputy Army Commander in the future.
        They had to stand aside.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Even Hila strongly suspected that she would not be able to defeat Evans
        when he grew up. "This won't do. If this goes on, my position will be
        compromised!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Hila was alarmed, and a sense of motivation exploded in her heart. It
        was one thing to be under Black Star in the army, but she did not want
        to see anyone else standing on her head. If not for the fact that Black
        Star was looking for her, she would have gone into seclusion in Soul
        Terminal for a decade.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Central Galaxy, Arcane Church border. A large official fleet was
        stationed at the border outpost, welcoming a spaceship with the Black
        Star Army insignia. The spaceship stopped at the dock. Han Xiao walked
        down with Hila and Evans, only to see Wuornos waiting with a
        high-ranking official of the church beside him.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "I didn't expect you to pick me up. Do they need to trouble you for such
        a small matter?" Han Xiao raised his brows.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "After all, the Ten Thousand Deity Scepter is a weapon given to me by
        the church. Since it is going to be unsealed, I have to be there,"
        Wuornos nodded slowly.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao glanced at it, clicked his tongue, and joked, "Stop
        bullsh*tting. I think the church is obviously worried that I might do
        something to it, so they called you over. How sad. I said that I would
        fulfill the deal, so I will definitely return the Ten Thousand Deity
        Scepter to you. Are you so suspicious of me?" Wuornos secretly rolled
        his eyes, too lazy to reply.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        ‘A few days ago, you exposed the matter of Gaud. How can we not worry?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Furthermore, your credibility has always been erratic. Who in the entire
        universe doesn't know that your personality is unpredictable, sometimes
        good and sometimes bad? Who would dare to completely believe you before
        the truth comes to light?' Wuornos cursed silently, waved his hand, and
        got the Arcane Church soldiers to bring over a piece of Spacetime Amber.
        It was the piece that sealed the Ten Thousand Deity Scepter.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Your Excellency Black Star, please." The Arcane Church official coughed
        and raised his hand in an inviting gesture.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao glanced at him but did not say anything. He took out the
        Spacetime Amber and poked it lightly. The next moment, the Spacetime
        Amberwhich the Federation of Light and Arcane Church had been studying
        for many years but could not break-burst like a bubble. The Ten Thousand
        Deity Scepter, which was fixed in midair, suddenly fell. Before it even
        landed, Wuornos grabbed it and quickly checked it. After confirming that
        there were no problems, he nodded at the Arcane Church official.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Seeing this, the Arcane Church official's tensed body finally relaxed.
        He let out a breath and smiled. "Thank you, Your Excellency Black Star."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "What are you thanking me for? It's just a deal." Han Xiao did not mind.
        Instead, he teased, "Why don't you check for a while more? Don't forget
        that I'm the Transcendent now. Who knows, I might have done something
        that you guys won't be able to discover in a while?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "…Cough, you really know how to joke." The Arcane Church official's
        expression froze. Although he had said that, he was not sure in his
        heart. He secretly gave Wuornos a look. The corners of Wuornos' eyes
        twitched, and he had no choice but to lower his head and examine it
        carefully again. "There's no hurry. Take your time to check, we have
        plenty. You have to be suspicious till the end." Han Xiao chuckled.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"You're exaggerating…"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">The Arcane Church official smiled awkwardly.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After more than ten seconds, Wuornos raised his head again and glared at
        the Arcane Church official. "No problem."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "That's good. If there's nothing else, I'm leaving."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao nodded and brought Hila and Evans onto the ship. They took off
        and headed toward the Crimson Dynasty. This trip was just to unseal the
        Ten Thousand Deity Scepter.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After watching the spaceship leave, the Arcane Church official finally
        heaved a sigh of relief. He took the Ten Thousand Deity Scepter from
        Wuornos and solemnly placed it in a special container, letting the
        soldiers take it to the main ship to store it and wait to ship it back
        to their mother planet. Although this item was Wuornos' weapon in name,
        it was actually something that belonged to the Arcane Church.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "After nearly a hundred years, the Ten Thousand Deity Scepter has
        finally returned to us…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Arcane Church official sighed, but he realized that he was not as
        excited as he had imagined.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Ten Thousand Deity Scepter was a single-target trump card that
        targeted individual strength. In the past, it would indeed cause people
        to tremble in fear. However, the times had changed completely. Beyond
        Grade As had the benefits of the Sanctum Revival, so its effect was
        greatly weakened.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Furthermore, Black Star had also opened up a new level of power. The
        destructive power of the Ten Thousand Deity Scepter would probably not
        be able to threaten him at all, not to mention that he had the Spacetime
        Amber as a defensive treasure…
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The situation was so dire that he could not be happy!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Arcane Church official had a complicated expression on his face. He
        turned to look at Wuornos and sighed. "You have to succeed. In terms of
        individual strength, the Arcane Church will have to rely on you to
        compete with Black Star." "Don't worry, I won't fail again."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Wuornos nodded slightly and replied casually, but his mind was not on
        that. He was thinking about Evans, who had followed Han Xiao just now.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He could also sense the aura of a Beyond Grade A from this stranger, and
        he even felt that this guy was not simple.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        ‘Strange, since when did Black Star have this unfamiliar Beyond Grade A
        beside him, and he seems to be his subordinate…'
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Crimson Dynasty, a secret military base. This was the dynasty's prison
        to imprison EsGod. At this moment, a group of dynasty fleets was
        gathered here, and the leader was Han Xiao's old friend, Teny Amenos.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        There was no need to fight in the frontline harassment battle. All they
        had to do was bombard the World Tree Army. Thus, most of the upper
        echelons did not have any missions and were all transferred back to the
        special military training classes that the three Universal Civilizations
        had opened.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The course that they were learning was a new type of battle strategy
        that was specially designed based on the tactical habits that the World
        Tree Civilization had displayed in the past two years of war. This kind
        of thing would be summarized as the understanding of the World Tree
        Civilization deepened, and it would continuously strengthen the tactical
        abilities of the upper echelons.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Today was the day to carry out the deal and let Black Star deal with
        EsGod. Thus, Teny, who had some free time, was pulled over to be in
        charge of the defense fleet to prevent any accidents.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "I really didn't expect Black Star to open a new level of strength in
        the blink of an eye…" In the command room of the main ship, Teny was
        browsing through the intelligence data of the past few days. He could
        not help but let out a soft gasp of surprise as his thoughts drifted
        away. He recalled the first time he met Black Star. Back then, Black
        Star had just stepped into the Beyond Grade A realm, and he was only a
        colonel of the dynasty's military. They had a good chat, and he had even
        asked Black Star about technology. When they parted, Black Star had even
        gifted him a mechanical weapon. At that time, how could he have known
        that a new Beyond Grade A who had joined the dynasty as usual would
        become such a bigshot in less than a hundred years? Not only was he a
        huge obstacle to the three Universal Civilizations, but he was also
        their reliance in the war.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In the beginning, the two of them would still occasionally send messages
        to each other. However, as their positions grew higher and higher,
        everyone became very busy, and their contact gradually decreased.
        Although he had now become an important upper echelon of the dynasty's
        military and had been promoted many times, almost reaching the top of
        the dynasty's system, his position was still worlds apart from Black
        Star.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Teny shook his head and pondered. "Strength that exceeds Beyond Grade
        As… I wonder how many troops it will take to kill a Transcendent
        individual…" The tactical deduction of using an army to kill an
        individual strength had always been an important lesson for the
        dynasty's officers. Although large fleets could kill Beyond Grade As,
        they also paid attention to efficiency and success rate. After all,
        individual strength was extremely flexible, and only by using reasonable
        targeted tactics could they kill an individual strength at the lowest
        cost.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Teny had been studying these strategies all these years, using Beyond
        Grade As as imaginary enemies. He had created many targeted strategies
        based on different abilities, perfecting the dynasty's tactical
        inventory. Deducing these strategies was almost his instinct. Even the
        direct descendants of the dynasty were his simulated opponents. This was
        a matter of position and profession, and it did not involve personal
        grudges.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Therefore, although the two of them were friends, other than admiration,
        the first thing Teny thought about was how to kill Black Star.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "It's a pity that I don't have enough information, so I can't carry out
        a new simulation… However, this guy has advanced. He's stronger than
        before, and the success rate is probably still zero." After pondering
        for a while, Teny gave up on the deduction.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He had treated Black Star as an imaginary enemy more than once. Even
        before Han Xiao advanced, his thousands of simulations had all failed.
        Black Star was one of the few Beyond Grade As that he had a zero chance
        of killing. Even people as difficult to deal with as Manison and Kasuyi
        had a chance of death in the simulations.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        I hope I can gather enough information this time… Teny shook his head.
        Other than to prevent any accidents, he also had the mission of
        collecting Black Star's intelligence. Since Black Star wanted to kill
        EsGod, he would have to take action. This was a good opportunity to
        observe the strength of a Transcendent.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Just as he was thinking, the reconnaissance outpost sent a message. The
        fleet that had gone out to welcome them had already brought Han Xiao and
        the others in.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He looked up. At the edge of the military base, a few dynasty
        battleships were leading the way, followed by a Black Star Army
        spaceship. The radar showed that there were three powerful Supers. Very
        soon, the spaceship entered the main ship, and Han Xiao brought Hila and
        Evans to the command room. "Hello, Your Excellency Black Star. We meet
        again." Teny took the initiative to step forward and extended his hand.
        "We've known each other for a long time. There's no need to be so
        polite." Han Xiao did not put on airs and shook hands with him.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "We have already opened EsGod's prison. You can unseal him anytime."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Teny nodded and glanced at the two people beside Han Xiao with a trace
        of doubt.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Black Star's goal this time was to send EsGod into the Underworld. He
        could understand him bringing Hila, but who was this other Beyond Grade
        A?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Sensing Teny's gaze, Han Xiao got Evans to come over and introduced,
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "This is Evans, the new Deputy Army Commander of the Black Star Army, a
        Beyond Grade A Esper with a bright future. He has been training in the
        army for many years."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Evans nodded politely.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Teny also returned the greeting, but he was surprised.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Why have I never seen this person's information before? It seems like he
        appeared out of nowhere. He should have left some records when he was at
        the Calamity Grade. Could it be that this guy has never been active in
        the outside world and has been secretly raised by the army to become a
        Beyond Grade&nbsp;A?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Teny felt that the hidden strength of the Black Star Army was deeper
        than he had imagined.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, he did not forget the goal of this transaction. He probed,
        "Your Excellency Black Star, it is said that you will use Gaud to
        exchange for EsGod's life. Are you ready?" "Don't worry, I brought him
        here."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao raised his finger, and a few mechanical assistants carried an
        imprisonment device into the room and placed it beside him.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        With a move of his energy, the imprisonment device immediately turned
        into mechanical particles and was put away. Gaud, who was inside, fell
        to the ground. Hila expressionlessly took a few steps forward, grabbed
        Gaud by the back of his collar, and lifted him.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Your Excellency Gaud!"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Teny's expression changed, and he hurriedly went forward to observe.
        However, Evans was one step ahead of him. He reached out to stop him and
        said slowly, "The deal is not completed yet, we can't give you the
        person." Teny had no choice but to stop. Looking at Gaud's extremely
        weak appearance, as though he had been abused, he could not help but be
        furious.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Black Star, don't forget that the dynasty is still waiting for your
        explanation!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Back then, the dynasty was fooled and even made Black Star the team
        leader of the investigation team. This was a farce. Black Star might
        have even laughed at them behind their backs.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At the thought of this, Teny could not help but feel angry that his
        country had been humiliated, and his tone became impolite. Hearing this,
        Han Xiao smiled and ignored him. Instead, he walked in front of Gaud,
        his shadow covering his entire body.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "This is… the Crimson Dynasty? Why did you bring me here?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Gaud's dull eyes turned slightly, and he suddenly had some spirit.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "To return you to the dynasty, of course." Gaud was stunned for a
        moment, and he was overjoyed. However, he suddenly realized what was
        going on, and his mood fell once again.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        If it was in the past, he would still be happy, but now that his ability
        had been taken away, so what if he returned to the dynasty?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        First, Black Star had taken away his hope, and now, Black Star had given
        him another meaningless hope. Gaud felt that Black Star was toying with
        him. "…Do you think you can fool the dynasty just because you gave me a
        strange identity? I'm a direct descendant of the dynasty. What you did
        to me will forever be a stain on your name. You will pay the price
        sooner or later!" Gaud pulled himself together and pretended to be
        furious.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In his mind, Han Xiao had sent him back to the dynasty to force him to
        admit EsGod's identity and clear his name of attacking the dynasty's
        direct descendant. He would definitely not let him do as he wished.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, Han Xiao did not mind. "I know you won't admit it. It doesn't
        matter. I didn't bring you here for your explanation. I brought you
        because I want you to see how I kill your main body.'
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As soon as he said that, there was movement outside the window. A huge
        prison opened up, revealing EsGod who was locked in amber. Gaud
        subconsciously looked over, and his heart tightened. Not only did you
        take away my Esper Ability, you even want to ravage my original body in
        front of me ?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">*cking have to go so far? I beg you, just kill me!</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        You call me a villain? You're clearly more of a villain than me!

      </h1>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At this moment, on the Crimson Dynasty mother planet, in the Ruler's
        office.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In the room, the remote surveillance was showing the scene of EsGod's
        prison. Marbruce had his hands on his nose, his sharp eyes staring at
        Black Star in the image, paying attention to the development of the
        scene.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Why did this guy take the risk to do this back then…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Marbruce muttered to himself.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Back then, he had listened to Bekorodi's suggestion and suspected that
        Black Star was behind Gaud's disappearance. However, Urranrell was the
        one in charge back then, so it was not convenient for him to interfere.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After he became the next Ruler, it was not suitable for him to
        thoroughly investigate Black Star, so he kept the matter under control.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The only motive that Marbruce could think of was that Gaud had once
        tried to simulate the Evolution Cube's ability, which was why Black Star
        had attacked. As for the idea of Black Star killing a talented rookie,
        from the series of events with the World Tree, he felt that the
        possibility of Black Star doing so was low.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "The problem with the Evolution Cube shouldn't have made him take such a
        risk. Black Star rarely does anything unnecessary. He probably had other
        reasons for secretly capturing Gaud…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Marbruce pondered about the excuses.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He glanced at Gaud, who looked like he had been abused, and was even
        more furious. For a direct descendant to be treated like this, it was a
        disgrace to their dynasty.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        If Black Star used the excuse of Evolution Cube, he would not accept it.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        ‘However… even if I don't accept his explanation, so what?'
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Marbruce sighed in his heart.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Now that the situation was dire, and Black Star was fully grown, the
        three Universal Civilizations also needed the association's strength to
        fight the enemies. Even if Black Star could not give him a satisfactory
        explanation, he helplessly realized that he could not do anything to the
        other party and did not dare retaliate.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        From the perspective of benefits alone, the importance of a direct
        descendant of the dynasty who had yet to grow was naturally not as
        important as Black Star, their partner. Although the dynasty's prestige
        was damaged this time, and it made Marbruce furious, venting his anger
        was not something someone in his position should do. Even if the dynasty
        wanted to, they had to look at the time and the occasion.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Marbruce even felt a little resentful toward Black Star for exposing
        this secret in front of the federation and the church. Wouldn't it be
        better to tell him in private? At most, he would feel embarrassed and
        not let the other two leaders see him as a joke. It would be better if
        he dealt with it privately. Before the problem of the World Tree was
        resolved, the dynasty could not do anything to Black Star. Not only did
        they have to work together as usual, but after Gaud was returned, they
        also had to consider the bigger picture and not take revenge for the
        time being… The more Marbruce thought about it, the more frustrated he
        felt.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "I just hope that you can give me an acceptable explanation…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Marbruce exhaled heavily and lowered his standards.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        On the other side, the amber holding EsGod was already floating in front
        of everyone.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao glanced at Gaud. Seeing that Gaud was still suppressing the
        emotions in his heart and maintaining a puzzled expression, he could not
        help but laugh.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Before his personality split, the real EsGod would not have done this.
        However, (Esper Ability-Rebirth) had already turned the two of them into
        independent individuals, and their personalities had changed. Gaud was
        Gaud, and his main body was his main body. Speaking of which, the ‘new
        EsGod' that was currently imprisoned might have a more ‘true EsGod'
        personality. "Teny, I'm ready to take action. Activate the space
        stabilization anchor." Han Xiao nodded as he spoke out.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Teny turned around and gave the order. The fleets around him quickly
        surrounded the area and activated the space stabilization anchor to
        stabilize the area.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        EsGod had a lot of abilities, and he was extremely slippery. He could
        teleport and escape if they were not careful. This was an essential
        environment modification.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This time, Han Xiao walked out of the cabin alone and slowly arrived in
        front of the EsGod Amber. Under everyone's gaze, he unsealed it.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Buzz!</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        EsGod's eyes sparkled, and he immediately saw what was going on. He
        quickly retreated.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        It had been decades since the last time he was unsealed, and EsGod's
        soul was even more dispirited. However, the wormhole data that Black
        Star had used to trick him into thinking about the World Tree had
        already been discovered. Waiting until the day he was released, he had
        endured the loneliness and struggled to maintain his thinking. Now that
        he had regained his freedom, he immediately reacted.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, EsGod was in a very weak state. His wounds that had not healed
        from the last battle were still hurting, but he still made a defensive
        stance. His gaze swept across the entire battlefield and quickly locked
        onto Han Xiao.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Black Star, I didn't expect you to let me out again. Looks like I made
        the right bet."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        To figure out Gaud's background, Han Xiao had let him out once. EsGod
        had resisted stubbornly and almost died, but after hearing Black Star's
        words, he had decided to surrender and not resist. It seemed like he had
        won the bet.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"We meet again," Han Xiao said calmly.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Is the World Tree here?" EsGod narrowed his eyes and got straight to
        the point.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "They're here." Han Xiao nodded and said calmly, "I let you out this
        time to fulfill the promise I made back then. I'll let you witness
        everything and borrow your strength."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Hearing this, EsGod seemed to be relieved of a heavy burden and smiled.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "As I said, this day would come sooner or later. You will need my help
        one day."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">EsGod felt a sense of excitement.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After being locked up for so many years, he had finally made it through!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "I won't refute you in this aspect. Although you are full of evil, you
        are still a powerful combatant. It's too wasteful to lock you up here."
        Han Xiao suddenly raised his brows. "However, the way you will help is
        probably different from what you think."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Hmm?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        EsGod was confused. "I don't intend to let you live. I need to borrow
        your life. A dead EsGod is a good EsGod." "…What do you mean? You want
        to kill me? Now?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">EsGod was stunned.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After sealing me for so long, you only released me to kill me now. What
        do you want?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This was completely different from what EsGod had expected. In his
        imagination, when the World Tree descended, the three Universal
        Civilizations would most likely ask him for help out of courtesy for the
        information that he had, giving him a chance to turn the situation
        around.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, he did not expect that even though he had gotten what he wanted
        and waited for the day the World Tree descended, his life would also
        come to an end… He did not think that he would be able to escape from
        Black Star's hands in his current weakened state. EsGod had realized
        this when they fought last time.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He did not know about the existence of the Underworld and did not know
        what benefits his death would bring to Han Xiao. However, this did not
        stop him from understanding the other party's killing intent, and
        immediately reacted.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        EsGod retreated rapidly, squeezing his cells to the limit and pumping
        out energy. His aura exploded, and a radar alarm sounded. He was
        prepared to risk his life.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At the same time, a resolute mental wave spread out from EsGod's body
        into the minds of everyone present.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Black Star! I won't sit back and do nothing. If you want my life, come
        and get it yourself!" At the same time, Teny, who was watching the
        battle, shuddered. He secretly told the crew to turn on the video
        recording device.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "They're about to start fighting. Remember to record the entire process.
        Don't miss out on any of Black Star's abilities!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Beside him, Gaud looked at the scene of EsGod getting into his stance,
        and his emotions were complicated.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This was the first time he had seen his main body after splitting up. It
        had been almost a hundred years. Seeing his body, which he had once used
        to conquer the universe, now being controlled by a new personality, the
        feeling was indescribable.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After all, no matter what, he had always used that body to live in the
        past, familiarizing himself with every inch. He had spent a lot of
        effort nurturing the powerful abilities of his main body, but he was
        forced to leave it to the ‘newbie'. There was both nostalgia and
        unwillingness.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "If I hadn't been captured back then, I wouldn't have abandoned my main
        body so quickly…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Gaud gritted his teeth.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Now that the ability of this new body had been taken away, the original
        body that was left behind became the only hope in his eyes.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Looking at the scene of Black Star confronting his main body outside the
        window, Gaud's thoughts raced.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "With the ability of my main body, as long as he can last for some time,
        he will be able to break through the space stabilization and use
        Dimensional Hyperdrive to escape… There is still a chance!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Although he had been locked up for decades and did not understand Black
        Star's progress, Gaud was very clear about the strength of his main
        body. With Black Star's strength when he defeated him, he felt that he
        would not be able to take down his main body anytime soon…
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">This was hope!</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Gaud was energized.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, just as he was about to focus on watching this fierce battle,
        the sudden change in the situation shocked him!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        A circle of golden lightning spread out from Han Xiao's body, and
        countless mechanical soldiers surged out. It was as though Han Xiao had
        become the gate of the secondary dimensional army box, completely
        ignoring the effects of the Space Stabilization Anchor!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">(Godly Stronghold)</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In the blink of an eye, the mechanical army far larger than the fleet
        present had arrived.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The next moment, a large number of machines gathered on Han Xiao's body,
        quickly forming a Mechanical Deity with a strange appearance. Its
        structure was extremely complicated, as though it was covered in a dark
        gold armor. It had a crown on its head, and its facial features were
        similar to Han Xiao's. Complicated silver-blue matrix patterns covered
        its entire body, flickering as if it was breathing.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Compared to the average Mechanical Deity, the energy fluctuations
        emitted by this group of machines were even more astonishing. They had a
        unique temperament and looked like they were one entity. They did not
        look like something that was synthesized but more like an independent
        being summoned.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        (Mechanical Deity &ndash; Supreme Heavenly Venerate]!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        A strong, mighty pressure suddenly swept out. Every life form present
        felt a huge pressure as if a true god had descended.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Teny and the others were not Beyond Grade As, so it was normal. However,
        EsGod and Gaud's expressions changed drastically!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Could it be that you've already…"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">EsGod was stunned and horrified.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Why had he been moving around in the universe for so many years? It was
        all to step into a higher realm!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        But now, without any mental preparation, he saw something that he had
        been dreaming of in Black Star. How could he not be shocked?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Without waiting for EsGod to recover from his shock, Han Xiao attacked.
        The shadow of the Emperor Skysplitter Blade quickly formed in the hands
        of the Supreme Heavenly Venerate. The next moment, the shadow
        materialized and slashed.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        A suffocating thick psionic energy burst out, turning the visible area
        blue. Translucent energy engulfed all directions!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        EsGod suddenly came back to his senses and hurriedly responded. Layers
        of energy shields shot out, but under the attack of the Supreme Heavenly
        Venerate, they shattered and exploded into fragments of light like
        fragile glass.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He wanted to dodge, but he felt that he was firmly locked onto and could
        not dodge. Due to the interference of the Space Stabilization Anchor, he
        could not teleport as well.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        EsGod clenched his teeth and gathered what little energy he had left,
        activating his Esper Ability to fight head-on!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        A black and red beam shot out and hit the edge of the Emperor
        Skysplitter Blade, but was split in half. The blade only paused for an
        instant before slashing down at an even faster speed. The light from the
        Getta Hadoken-flowed, compressed, and condensed on the blade &ndash;
        forming a huge light blade.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Bang!</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        A large blob of flesh and blood mixed with energy exploded, turning into
        ash halfway through.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        EsGod's body was sent flying, and half of his body was shattered!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The last time EsGod was sealed, he had just been beaten up by Han Xiao.
        His health was already low to begin with, and the power of this slash
        heavily injured him. EsGod would have been killed instantly had he not
        hurriedly activated recovery Esper Ability!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Before he could even adjust his state, Han Xiao struck the air, creating
        a blue shockwave that quickly caught up to EsGod and swept toward him.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Bang! Bang! Bang!</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        A series of explosions occurred on EsGod's body. It was as if he had
        received tens of thousands of heavy blows at the same time. His body was
        covered in dense depressions, and he was almost beaten into a lump of
        flesh, unable to move at all.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        EsGod still had a breath of life left, and he frantically activated his
        Esper Ability to recover.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, at this moment, the thrusters on the back of the Supreme
        Heavenly Venerate spat out thick flames, and the explosion increased its
        speed. With a turn of the blade, a dazzling slash appeared. The gigantic
        body was unbelievably agile, and it brushed past EsGod!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Swish!</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As the light streaked past EsGod's body, his recovery stopped, and his
        life force disappeared at a speed visible to the naked eye.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He controlled his newly grown head with great difficulty and turned to
        look at the Supreme Heavenly Venerate. Complicated emotions flashed
        through his eyes. There was enlightenment, envy, relief…
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "You didn't disappoint me… You've indeed stepped into… the level of my
        dreams. At least before I die… I was able to see a higher level of
        power… It was worth it…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The intermittent mental fluctuations drained the last of his energy. The
        next moment, EsGod's body dissipated in front of everyone's eyes,
        turning into starlight and disappearing.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">With three auto-attacks, EsGod died!</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Teny's expression froze, and his eyes widened in disbelief.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Black Star had killed a Beyond Grade A in an instant before as well, but
        that was only due to tactics. Most of the time, he would use the method
        of mutual destruction, and this seemed to be the first time he had done
        something like instant-killing a peak Beyond Grade A head-on with auto
        attacks!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        It was as easy as a Beyond Grade A fighting a Calamity Grade Super. This
        was the Transcendent Grade ?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        It was impossible to gather much intelligence on Black Star's abilities
        with just two or three moves, but the tip of the iceberg was already
        shocking enough.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Teny could not help but swallow a mouthful of saliva. He deeply doubted
        whether an individual strength at this level was something that a fleet
        could deal with…
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"What…"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Gaud was also stunned.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He had thought that Black Star would have a fierce battle with his main
        body, but he did not expect Black Star to kill his main body so easily
        in the blink of an eye.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        What shocked him the most was the fact that Black Star had already
        stepped into a higher realm!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        A deep sense of powerlessness penetrated Gaud's body.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He had wasted so many years, committed countless evil deeds, abandoned
        precious things one after another, and even changed his body, yet he
        still did not achieve this dream. However, Black Star had easily
        fulfilled his lifelong wish… How hateful!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Under normal circumstances, Gaud would still have the mentality to chase
        after his goal, but now that his ability was taken away and his main
        body was beaten to death, he did not have any more chances. For a
        moment, he felt as if his heart was dead. He felt that all his essence,
        energy, and spirit had been sucked away, leaving only an empty shell
        without a soul.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Gaud would rather be locked in the Spacetime Amber forever than
        experience this series of despairing blows.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At this moment, he had fallen into a negative state of mind.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-1394">
      <h1 class="h" itemprop="headline">
        Chapter 1395: Successor<span hidden="" class="calibre1"> | </span>
      </h1>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Just as everyone was having different thoughts, the Supreme Heavenly
        Venerate shrank, and the mechanical soldiers returned to Han Xiao's
        body, revealing his original figure. Han Xiao looked at the location
        where EsGod had died, and his eyes sparkled. Just when EsGod's health
        was emptied with a single slash, a strong intuition suddenly appeared in
        his head. He thought that his attack might be able to cross dimensions
        and affect his opponent's information form, but this feeling was
        fleeting and could not be captured ‘If I can destroy the enemy's
        physical body along with the information form projection, I might be
        able to eliminate the enemy's existence. This way, the Sanctum, the
        World Tree, and the Underworld might not be able to revive them.'
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Han Xiao thought to himself.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He suddenly came up with this idea, mainly because of (Information
        UniquenessConceptual Immortality). If all Transcendents had this
        ability, then experts of the same level should have the means to counter
        it. If only a Transcendent could kill a Transcendent, then they should
        have the ability to use destructive power in information and conceptual
        levels. "I've just stepped into the Transcendent Grade. It seems like
        there are more abilities hidden at this level that have yet to be
        completely unlocked." Han Xiao calmed himself down and flew back to the
        dynasty's flagship. As soon as they returned to the command room,
        everyone turned to look at him with different expressions. Han Xiao
        ignored them and glanced at Gaud's expression. "How is it? Are you happy
        to see your main body after so long?" Gaud remained silent. He was
        filled with hatred, but he did not dare speak. He was afraid that he
        would not be able to control the anger that he had accumulated and would
        confess.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Furthermore, Black Star's strength had already made him despair.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At this moment, Teny walked over with a complicated look in his eyes.
        Then, his tone became firm again. "Your Excellency Black Star, you've
        killed him. EsGod will soon become your hired thug. It's time for you to
        fulfill your promise."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">What hired thug?</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Gaud was slightly stunned. However, no one answered his question at this
        moment. Han Xiao turned to look at Hila, and Hila understood. She showed
        the Mark of The Underworld, indicating that EsGod's soul had been sent
        into the Underworld.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Seeing this, Han Xiao smiled casually and replied,</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Of course, we each take what we need. This person is now yours."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Then, he lifted Gaud up and threw him in front of Teny as though he was
        throwing trash.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Teny could not be bothered with Han Xiao's attitude. He got someone to
        help Gaud up. After sensing for a while, he suddenly realized that
        Gaud's condition was not right. "Your Excellency Gaud, are you alright?"
        "I…" Gaud clenched his teeth. Without waiting for him to finish, Hila
        continued coldly, "His Esper Ability has already been taken away by us.
        He's a cripple now."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"What?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Teny was shocked, and only after checking carefully did he confirm this
        point. Furthermore, from his injuries, it seemed like it had happened
        recently. Black Star had obviously done this, and he could not help but
        be shocked and furious. "Black Star! How dare you!" "Take a break. Tell
        Marbruce to come out and talk to me. He should be watching." Han Xiao
        ignored him. Teny was stunned. He glared at Han Xiao and gave a few
        orders. Ten seconds later, a remote projection appeared. It was
        Marbruce, staring at Han Xiao with a dark expression. "Black Star, this
        is not the deal we agreed on!" "Is that so? But I remember that the deal
        was just to hand over the person. Isn't he in your hands now?" Han Xiao
        did not mind. "Stop quibbling, you know what I mean!" Marbruce was
        furious. They had made a deal with Black Star because they wanted to
        exchange for a direct descent with the Super High-Risk Esper Ability,
        not a cripple. The current situation made him feel like he had eaten a
        fly. Energy Control was an ability with a bright future. As long as it
        was properly nurtured, it would be ranked among the top strengths.
        However, a Beyond Grade A direct descendant with unparalleled potential
        had been crippled just like that. Marbruce was so angry that his head
        was almost smoking.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He was not the only one. All the dynasty officers in the cabin had
        unfriendly looks on their faces as they glared at Han Xiao and the
        others. They felt the same hatred because of Gaud's misfortune, who was
        a direct descendant of the dynasty. If they did not care about the
        overall situation, they would have opened fire. "Alright, don't look so
        bitter. We're not done yet." Han Xiao waved his hand. "Didn't you guys
        want an explanation?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Marbruce suppressed his anger and said with a deep voice, "Speak. You
        better satisfy us." "You guys think Gaud is a pure dynasty descendant,
        but his true identity is EsGod. When he was captured…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao could not be bothered to respond to him. He slowly explained
        the situation of the split personality caused by [Esper AbilityRebirth).
        "…So what you're saying is that you ambushed Gaud and imprisoned him for
        so many years because he's an unstable factor that might attract the
        World Tree in advance? However, EsGod did not know that this
        doppelganger existed, and only Gaud knew his identity… Don't you think
        this is too ridiculous?" Marbruce frowned.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao said with a calm expression, "I know you don't believe me, but
        I've already given him to you. If you have the guts, you can dig out the
        evidence from him." It was very difficult for him to use Gaud's memories
        as evidence. The dynasty would only think that it was forged. As a
        direct descendant who had met with a catastrophe, Gaud would not be
        treated to a memory search just because of a random suspicion from an
        outsider. The three Universal Civilizations would never use such methods
        on the direct descendants, which would easily damage their loyalty.
        Furthermore, the direct descendants would also resist.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, even if the dynasty was willing to search Gaud's memories, they
        would also suspect that he had done something to plant fake evidence.
        There was no way to completely prove Gaud's true identity, and Han Xiao
        did not care if the dynasty believed him or not. As expected, Marbruce
        did not believe in such a story that could not be verified. He only felt
        that it was Black Star's excuse and said with a deep voice, "I'm not
        satisfied with this explanation. According to you, we still have to
        thank you?" "Indeed, you should thank me."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao did not mind at all. He could explain it properly, but there
        was no need to.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Using this matter, he planned to change his previous image. Because he
        had worked together with the three Universal Civilizations to fight
        against the foreign enemies, he had built a training base together with
        them and provided a lot of help, causing his image in the eyes of the
        three Universal Civilizations to become too righteous. Now that he had
        stepped into the Transcendent Grade, his details were filled with
        mystery. He could take this opportunity to create distance between him
        and the three Universal Civilizations, strengthening his unfathomable
        image in their eyes, and make them feel that the increase in strength
        had changed his personality. This was very common. This way, the three
        Universal Civilizations would be more cautious in dealing with the
        relationship between the two sides and re-establish their attitude
        toward him.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        It was best not to be too sincere when interacting with these advanced
        civilizations. The upper echelons of both sides knew that they would be
        opposing each other sooner or later, so it was pointless to talk about
        making friends now.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Marbruce's breathing quickened. After a few seconds, he calmed down and
        said coldly, "We will investigate this matter internally and find out
        the truth as soon as possible." He wanted to turn hostile, but he did
        not dare. Even if the dynasty did that, the federation and church would
        not go crazy with them. "Up to you." Han Xiao waved his hands. "…There's
        one more thing. You destroyed Gaud's Esper Ability, so you have to give
        me an explanation. Don't tell me that it's still an unstable factor."
        "That's it. If he continues to hold this power, there's a high chance
        that he will participate in the war. With his special feelings for the
        World Tree, he might cause something we don't want to see… I know you
        guys don't have the courage to cripple a direct descendant, so I helped
        you solve this hidden danger. You guys still have to thank me."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Black Star!" Marbruce laughed in anger. "Can you be any more shameless
        ?" "I'm just telling the truth. Whether you accept it or not is your
        problem." Han Xiao's tone was calm.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Marbruce clenched his fists so tightly that his knuckles turned white.
        After a while, he suppressed his anger and said with a deep voice, "No
        matter what reason you have, Energy Control is a unique Super High-Risk
        Esper Ability. It's too wasteful! If you train it well, this ability
        will be a powerful method to deal with the World Tree."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        With Black Star's strength, position, and influence, he could only look
        at it from a different perspective and blame Han Xiao for being
        wasteful. He was also very upset about the disappearance of his Super
        High-Risk Esper Ability. "I agree with you on this." Han Xiao nodded.
        "But don't worry, I did not destroy this ability. It can still be used
        on the battlefield."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Marbruce was stunned. He subconsciously looked at Gaud, thinking that
        Han Xiao was referring to Gaud. However, this time, Han Xiao patted
        Evans' shoulder and said, "I've already transferred this ability to
        Evans. Compared to Gaud, his potential is more worth nurturing." Hearing
        this, everyone looked over with confusion. "He has the Energy Control
        Esper Ability?" Teny could not help but ask with a surprised tone. "How
        did he do that? What kind of ability user is he?" Marbruce had the same
        doubt as he stared at Han Xiao. "I have been secretly training Evans for
        decades." Han Xiao looked at everyone and said, "His ability is the same
        as EsGod's. He can absorb the Esper Abilities of others for his own use.
        It was through this method that he seized Gaud's Esper Ability gene
        chain and obtained this Super High-Risk Ability." As soon as he said
        that, everyone was shocked. EsGod was the nightmare of many
        organizations. Thankfully, he had already been killed, but now there was
        another guy with the same ability in the universe. Could this galactic
        society still be good ? Marbruce's pupils constricted as he stared at
        Han Xiao. Great! Black Star had been trying to groom a second-generation
        Estod since a few decades ago. Maybe his other goal of killing Gaud was
        to obtain ‘Energy Control'!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Now that Black Star had an EsGod Hero Spirit and a second-generation
        EsGod that he had secretly groomed, even Marbruce could not help but be
        shaken. Han Xiao acted as though he did not see their expressions and
        said, "How is it? Evans' potential is better than Gaud's, right? Don't
        worry, I will do my best to train him so that he can be useful on the
        battlefield. So, Marbruce, you don't have to worry about this ability
        being wasted. I'm a very thrifty person." "…I'm relieved," Marbruce
        squeezed out the sound of chewing steel from between his teeth.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "That's good. Looks like we have a deeper understanding of each other.
        Since the matter has been resolved, I shall take my leave."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao turned around and left with Hila and Evans. Teny looked at Han
        Xiao's back and could not help but whisper, "Black Star, you've
        changed…" Han Xiao paused. … If I don't change, should I just wait to be
        eaten by you guys? He did not say anything and continued walking away.
        Very soon, his spaceship left the main ship and disappeared from
        everyone's sight. Watching Han Xiao and the others leave, the people in
        the command room remained silent with complicated feelings.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Marbruce was in a gloomy mood. This sudden turn of events made his
        stomach sour and nauseous.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He wanted to look down on Black Star, but on second thought, he felt a
        little dispirited. They did not have the right to look down on him. If
        not for Black Star, the World Tree would have already broken through the
        national borders. Despite the contradiction, he had no right to judge
        Black Star's character. "…Take good care of Gaud. Treat his injuries
        first."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Marbruce sighed and deactivated the remote projection. Gaud watched the
        entire process of Black Star negotiating with the dynasty, and his
        expression kept changing. Initially, he had a one-in-a-million hope that
        the dynasty would stand up for him and vent their anger on Black Star.
        However, the way the dynasty held back in front of Black Star completely
        shattered his fantasy and his desire for revenge. Not one of the three
        Universal Civilizations dared to provoke Black Star. Just what position
        had this guy climbed to in the past few decades? With my current state,
        touching Black Star's bad luck again would be like throwing an egg at a
        rock.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Gaud lamented in his heart. It was as if his bones had been sucked out.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, he had another question. He turned to Teny and whispered, "You
        guys just said that Black Star turned EsGod into a hired fighter. What's
        going on? Isn't that EsGod dead?" Teny looked at him with a complicated
        expression.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Although he did not believe Black Star saying that Gaud was EsGod, he
        could not help but be wary.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Teny thought for a moment before answering. "You've been locked up for
        decades, so you might not understand. Black Star has subdued a pair of
        sisters, and the Esper Abilities of these sisters are the same as the
        two sisters in history. They have also opened up the Underworld
        Dimension, and they can transform the souls into undying Hero Spirits
        and make them serve as their subordinates. Although EsGod was killed,
        his soul was thrown into the Underworld and it became their combat
        strength. There should be more than ten Beyond Grade A spirits in there
        now." Gaud's eyes widened.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In the Underworld Dimension. EsGod slowly opened his eyes, and a
        boundless black land appeared before him. "Am I dead…" EsGod looked down
        and saw that his body had turned into a semi-transparent spirit body.
        The scene before his death appeared once again. The overwhelming saber
        light had killed all the life force in his cells in one blow, causing
        him to tremble from the depths of his soul. He could not help but
        reminisce. However, it did not take long for him to realize that
        something was wrong. His soul was only a candle in the wind, but it
        showed no signs of dissipating. Instead, it was becoming more and more
        solid.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Swoosh!</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At this moment, a few rays of light flashed, and Han Xiao and the others
        teleported to the surroundings with the King and arrived in front of
        EsGod.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"What did you do to me?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">EsGod frowned.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Don't worry, it's a good thing for you. Did you think I would really
        kill you?" Han Xiao chuckled.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "…What are you going to do?" "Don't worry, this is a good thing for you.
        This is the Underworld, and it can stabilize souls. It…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Before Han Xiao could finish, EsGod interrupted him with his eyes wide
        open. "The legendary Underworld " "Oh? You know?" Han Xiao paused and
        raised his brows.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Of course I know."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        EsGod nodded. As a collector of Super High-Risk Esper Abilities, he had
        collected information about all the Beyond Grade A Espers in history. As
        for the two sisters, they were naturally the focus of attention, so he
        had seen all the records of the Underworld. "That makes things easier.
        It saved me the trouble of explaining." Han Xiao smiled. "The life and
        death Esper Abilities of this generation have owners. They repaired the
        Underworld and restored its effects. You're already a soul now. Are you
        willing to accept the Underworld transformation and become an undying
        Hero Spirit?" Hesitation flashed through EsGod's eyes. If he could live,
        he did not want to die. However, joining the Underworld meant losing his
        freedom, and he would probably never be able to free himself. Seeing
        this, Han Xiao smiled and said, "I know what you're worried about.
        Actually, this isn't a bad thing. You should know your own lifespan
        better than I. You don't have much longer to live anyway. As long as you
        give up a portion of your freedom, you can live forever in the
        Underworld. Furthermore, your physical form has changed, so you don't
        have to worry about the genetic chain anymore. You will only be stronger
        than when you were alive. So, why
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">not?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        EsGod's eyes sparkled, and he suddenly said with a deep voice, "Black
        Star, we've known each other for many years. Although you've reached a
        higher level first, my goal has not changed. If I join the Underworld, I
        won't have the chance to advance any further." "You didn't have a chance
        in the first place. Even if I didn't kill you, it's impossible for you
        to advance. You don't have to doubt my judgment. As someone who's
        experienced, I know better than you what it takes to advance."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Han Xiao shook his head.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This was not a lie. EsGod's genetic chain was too overloaded, and his
        life form would become even more unstable during his Promotion.
        Furthermore, with his terrible popularity, no peak Beyond Grade A would
        be willing to help him with his Promotion. Seeing EsGod remain silent,
        Han Xiao thought for a while and smiled. "But you don't have to be
        discouraged. Your dream can be fulfilled by your successor."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Successor?" EsGod was confused. Han Xiao beckoned for Evans to come
        over. "This guy's name is Evans. He inherited your ability and can steal
        other people's Esper Abilities. Can't he inherit your will and help you
        see a higher scenery?" "The same ability as mine ?" EsGod was shocked
        and looked at Evans carefully. Evans also showed his abilities, proving
        that Han Xiao was not lying. Seeing this, EsGod was even more shocked.
        "Are you… my illegitimate son " Evans' face darkened, but he did not say
        anything. Han Xiao smiled and said, "How would I know?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Let me think…"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">EsGod frowned as he recalled.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        When he was wreaking havoc in the galaxy, he had naturally vented his
        desires on females of different species, but they were all left to fend
        for themselves after mating. He did not know if he had any offspring.
        The more EsGod thought about it, the more he felt like he had lost a
        portion of his memories.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At this time, Han Xiao said, "There's no need to be so conflicted. The
        probability of having the same Esper Ability is much rarer than having a
        child, not to mention an extremely rare ability like yours. With my
        nurturing, Evans did not take the wrong path. Although he has fewer
        abilities now, his talent is not inferior to yours. Why don't you
        nurture him and let him fulfill your wish?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        EsGod was silent for a while before suddenly laughing and jokingly
        saying, "To put it bluntly, you just want to trick me into helping you
        train your combat strength and work for you."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao said without hesitation, "Evans has too little combat
        experience, so he doesn't know how to coordinate his various abilities.
        This is your strength, so I'll have to trouble you to guide him." "…I
        haven't agreed yet."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"You have a choice?" Han Xiao raised his brows.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Heh, that's what I admire about you the most."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        EsGod laughed for some reason, looked at Evans, nodded, and slowly said,
        "Life is really unpredictable. This is the first time I'm teaching
        someone… Alright, I'll teach you how to use this ability to fight. I
        only have one request… If one day you can reach a higher level, help me
        beat Black Star up."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Wow, so scary." Han Xiao clicked his tongue.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Evans looked at Han Xiao, then at EsGod. Seeing both of them staring at
        him, he finally nodded hesitantly. Seeing this, EsGod opened his arms
        with a calm expression. "Come, turn me into a Hero Spirit. Let this
        world see what I look like without any mental load!"
      </p>

      <p class="calibre3">
        The Hero Spirit Modification Ceremony was currently underway, and on a
        black mountain peak far away, the Hero Spirits of the Underworld were
        standing, looking up at Han Xiao and the others in the sky. Their eyes
        were focused on EsGod, who was transforming.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Hmph, Black Star kidnapped another newbie," Old Nine Aegon Vardnadze
        crossed his arms and snorted.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Why isn't this newbie resisting? Did he come in voluntarily? I thought
        he would only accept his fate after being taught a lesson like Old Nine
        and Old Ten." Old Four, who had no sense of existence, teased.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The corners of Old Ten Dylan's eyes twitched, and he remained silent.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In the end, he was still forced to accept his fate. Instead of suffering
        endless torture, he might as well enjoy a limited freedom. He could only
        hope that Black Star would keep his promise in the future and remove his
        identity as a Hero Spirit, allowing him to revive normally.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Humph, I don't care if this newcomer is willing or not. Anyway, I want
        to teach him the rules."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Aegon Vardnadze snorted.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After being taught a lesson, he finally relented. He was not willing to
        see the newcomers joining the Underworld so comfortably.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Sorokin adjusted his vision and saw the scene in the distance clearly.
        He could not help but raise his brows with a playful expression.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "I don't think you can teach him a lesson. This time, there's a powerful
        guy."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "How strong is he? Can he be stronger than me?" Dylan interrupted.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "You?" Sorokin turned his head and looked at him from head to toe. "I'm
        afraid you can't even match his one hand."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Dylan was instantly unhappy. "We're both peak Beyond Grade As, can he be
        stronger than Black Star? If he had that ability, why would he enter the
        Underworld?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Sorokin smiled without saying anything.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He was from the same era as EsGod, but the others were different. They
        did not know EsGod, and he was the only one present who understood how
        powerful EsGod's combat capability would be when combined with the
        mechanisms of the Underworld.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "However…" Sorokin changed the topic and said with a smile," No matter
        how strong he is, his seniority is behind us. He is Old Eleven.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        On the other side, Han Xiao also noticed the movements of the ten Hero
        Spirit Kings of the Underworld. He turned around and smiled.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The ten Guardian Deities of the Underworld had evolved into Inazuma
        Eleven. They had finally gathered enough to form a football team.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, EsGod was easy to talk to because Han Xiao's fists were big,
        but that did not mean that he had the same attitude toward others. He
        was not someone who would easily submit to others, and he would not
        obediently become Old Eleven.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After a while, the Hero Spirit modification was finally completed. EsGod
        opened his eyes again and felt the form of the Hero Spirit. He nodded in
        appreciation.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "The fusion of life and death forms a perfectly harmonious structure.
        This is the ultimate control of Esper Abilities. The Underworld can be
        called a Space Wonder. The two sisters in history are indeed amazing.
        Even if I were to develop these two abilities, I might not be able to do
        better than them."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Humph."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Hila did not like it when others used such a tone to guide her, but
        since the other party was the ‘God of Esper Abilities', an absolute
        master in the field of Esper Abilities, she did not say anything and
        only snorted to express her dissatisfaction.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At this time, the ten Guardian Deities of the Underworld saw that the
        ceremony was over and came over to get to know the newcomer. Sorokin
        greeted them first.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Yo, look who this is. I thought you would be locked up in a dark prison
        forever. How did you get released and become a member of the
        Underworld?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Sorokin, you're here too?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">EsGod looked over.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Hehe, looks like you've been locked up for too long. You have no idea
        what happened in the past few years," Sorokin shrugged and pointed at
        the Hero Spirits beside him. "Let me introduce them. These seven are
        Beyond Grade As who joined the Underworld in the exploration era. These
        two are Beyond Grade As in history. They were revived by Black Star and
        are both peak Beyond Grade As. We are the Hero Spirit Kings of the
        Underworld…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Revived?" A look of interest flashed through EsGod's eyes. He turned to
        look at Han Xiao and said with a smile, "Looks like you've done a lot of
        things in the past hundred years."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "What else? Do you think I've been doing nothing all these years?" Han
        Xiao shook his head. "In the past hundred years, there have been many
        changes in the galactic structure. You should ask Sorokin about these
        things. You guys know each other after all, he will definitely be happy
        to explain to you."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "That's right, as long as you owe me a promise coin… Don't look so
        confused. Come, let me introduce you to the currency of the Underworld…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Sorokin was extremely passionate. He could not wait to promote the
        financial system that he had created.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, before he could say anything, Dylan interrupted him and sized
        EsGod up.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"I haven't asked for your name. What's yours?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        EsGod turned to look at him. "You don't need to know my name. Just call
        me EsGod."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"What do you mean?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">"God of Esper Abilities."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Dylan laughed and said sarcastically, "Not even the most powerful Espers
        in history dared to call themselves that. Old Eleven, do you deserve
        this name?" "Old Eleven?" EsGod raised his brows and counted the people
        in front of him. He immediately understood the order of ranking.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"You're not convinced?" Dylan snorted.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "If we were still alive, you would be dead by now." EsGod's tone was
        calm. As someone who made the galactic society tremble in fear, he was
        not a good-tempered person.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Sure, let's fight. Sorokin said you're very strong, but I want to see
        how you kill me."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Dylan sneered. He remembered Sorokin's words and refused to believe
        them.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In any case, they were all Hero Spirits who would not die. If they were
        not convinced, they would fight. Han Xiao could not help but glance at
        him. He did not find it strange. Dylan had a foul mouth, and he also had
        the ability to taunt others. He had always liked to stir up trouble.
        Furthermore, after accepting Hero Spirit's identity, this guy no longer
        had anything to worry about. It was as if he had released his nature.
        His foul mouth became worse, and his taunts became more and more casual.
        His personality was extremely unrestrained.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        They were all Hero Spirits, and without Aurora giving them life force,
        no one would be able to do anything. It was likely that Dylan was just
        enjoying the feeling of the other side not being able to do anything to
        him.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "What do you say?" EsGod turned to look at Han Xiao.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Since that's the case, Aurora and I will temporarily give you a body.
        You guys can rearrange your positions, and strength is everything."
        Hila's eyes lit up. She was most willing to watch others fight a bloody
        battle, so she immediately decided.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "I agree." Sorokin's eyes lit up, and he immediately agreed.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Although he was not the strongest among the Hero Spirit Kings, he was
        definitely ranked at the top. At the very least, he did not have to
        continue being Old Eight.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "That's right, I agree." Dylan snorted and pointed at EsGod. "I hope you
        can let me enjoy myself."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "I'm in a good mood today, so let's celebrate my new life with you."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">EsGod paused and turned to look at Evans.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "This time, I'll show you the combat style of this ability. Watch and
        learn."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Evans immediately perked up.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Not long after, Aurora was called over by Hila to build a body for the
        numerous Hero Kings.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao brought them to the main universe and found a desolate universe
        belt as the battlefield.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Three days later, the eleven of them returned to the Underworld in their
        Hero Spirit form. They did not mention the battle at all and only
        silently rearranged themselves.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        EsGod became the eldest brother out of nowhere, Dylan became the second,
        Sorokin became the third, and Aegon Vardnadze became the fourth.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Although the first and second positions were only one position away from
        each other, there was a huge gap between their strengths. As a
        spectator, Han Xiao had finally witnessed the strength of EsGod when he
        was at his peak. He was much stronger than when he was alive, and it was
        a piece of cake for him to beat up Dylan.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In Han Xiao's eyes, he was probably the only one in the entire universe
        who could easily take down EsGod. The others would at most fight to a
        draw, and EsGod with no mental load would not be afraid of anyone but
        him.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        On the other hand, Wuornos' chances of winning were even lower than that
        of Herberlon. Even if his Energy Rank was higher, he might not be
        EsGod's match. After all, he was an Esper. As long as he was touched by
        [Esper Silence), he would basically be dead.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        On the other side, in the conference room of the three Universal
        Civilizations.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The three leaders had just finished a meeting and were arranging the
        documents when Louis suddenly thought of something. He looked at
        Marbruce and asked curiously,
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "How did your deal with Black Star go? I heard Gaud has returned?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Marbruce paused and slowly nodded.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Pope narrowed his eyes and slowly said, "So, Gaud was really
        captured by Black Star. How did your dynasty deal with him?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "…I'm still investigating the inside story. You don't have to worry
        about the details."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Marbruce shook his head.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Seeing this, the two of them guessed that the dynasty had most likely
        been defeated by Black Star and could not help but laugh inwardly. The
        Pope coughed and said calmly, "Black Star is fully grown, so let's not
        bother about him for now. No matter what, we have brought back a direct
        Beyond Grade A with extraordinary potential. In the future, he will
        definitely become an important pillar of our individual strength.
        Congratulations on obtaining a new National Pillar. Train Gaud well."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Because he had Wuornos at home who was preparing to advance to the
        Transcendent Grade, the Pope was very open-minded and did not mind that
        the dynasty had regained Gaud. Furthermore, from the standpoint of the
        three Universal Civilizations, this was also a good thing
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Marbruce's heart skipped a beat.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Others thought that Gaud was still the Super High-Risk Esper Ability
        possessor with unparalleled potential, and they were congratulating him
        for obtaining the potential seed. It was a kind of mockery, and he did
        not feel good about it.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Marbruce did not want the two of them to know that the dynasty had made
        a loss this time and used EsGod to exchange for a cripple. He had no
        choice but to suppress his anger and smile.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">At the border of the Flickering World.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Huge engineering spaceships cruised through space one after another.
        Planetary harvesting devices covered the planets one after another,
        carrying out destructive development, draining the planet's core,
        crushing the planet, and disintegrating it into various substances that
        flowed into the enormous storage pods. It was like a swarm of locusts
        sweeping across the galaxy, leaving only barren land wherever it passed.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        There were a few Star Clusters at the border of the Flickering World.
        Originally, it was a place with plenty of resources, but under the
        destructive development of the three Universal Civilizations, it was
        gradually turning into a desolate universe belt. It was currently
        transforming into a strategic deep region to face the World Tree's
        attacks in the future. All the valuable resources were taken away,
        leaving nothing behind for the World Tree. At this moment, at the edge
        of the development zone, a small dynasty fleet was escorting an ordinary
        spaceship with the Black Star Army's insignia. In the spaceship,
        Bun-Hit-Dog was arranging the materials he had collected for this trip.
        The players around him all had the ID prefix of Bun-Hit-Dog's studio,
        and they were all his employees.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "It's a pity that the dynasty did not allow us to go deep into the
        development zone. This time, we only managed to gather some scraps. It's
        not enough to make a video of the three Universal Civilizations
        preparing for war…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Bun-Hit-Dog sighed, not too satisfied with his gains.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Be content. The three Universal Civilizations have already made an
        exception by allowing us to take a look at the periphery." The
        assistant, Little Wheat, curled his lips.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Currently, most of the players were participating in the harassment
        battle at the frontline, but Bun-Hit-Dog did not stay at the frontline
        all the time. Because there were battle reports everywhere, it was not
        convenient for him to make videos. He keenly felt that the changes in
        the backlines would be more valuable, so he brought a group of studio
        employees back to the explored universe to search for news everywhere.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Not long after, Bun-Hit-Dog set his sights on the two news locations,
        the Black Star Training Base and the three Universal Civilizations' war
        preparations. However, the training base did not allow outsiders to
        enter, so he could only observe the latter.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Bun-Hit-Dog was doing quite well in some of the departments of the three
        Universal Civilizations. Firstly, the accounts under his studio all
        prioritized optimizing charisma, and they specialized in building a good
        relationship with various characters. Secondly, Bun-Hit-Dog kept
        promoting himself and pulled many players to be his backers, letting the
        three Universal Civilizations know that he had a special influence among
        the Immortals and became the exclusive media of the Immortals. Thirdly,
        he had the special identity of a reporter from the Black Star Army, and
        his studio was attached to the intelligence department of the army. It
        was a branch that was officially recognized, and it had a news license.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Therefore, in the eyes of the three Universal Civilizations, Bun-Hit-Dog
        represented the special intelligence personnel of the immortals group of
        the Black Star Army. He had some face and was able to discuss business
        and cooperation with the various organizations as a player. This was
        also the way some guilds did things. With so many conveniences,
        Bun-Hit-Dog's business flourished.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He submitted a visit request to the three Universal Civilizations, and
        after some negotiation, Bun-Hit-Dog and the others finally obtained
        permission to come to the edge of this border development zone to take a
        look. However, the results were not as expected, and they were now on
        their way
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">back.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "What should I do? Although I don't lack material now, it's all old
        talk. I need sensational news!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Bun-Hit-Dog tugged at his hair with a troubled expression.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At this moment, a chat notification popped up on the forums. An employee
        had sent a private message. "Boss, I made a huge discovery. This
        material will definitely scare you to death!" Bun-Hit-Dog looked at his
        ID and remembered that he was the supervisor in charge of the dynasty's
        news materials.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Cut the crap. Tell me what you found!"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "This is what one of my subordinates heard from a dynasty logistics
        officer. It is said that not long ago, Black Star went to kill EsGod and
        showed his strength that surpasses Beyond Grade A. He even handed Gaud
        over…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This small supervisor spoke with confidence. He did not know about the
        behind-the-scenes deal that Black Star made and only talked about what
        he did on the surface, but this was enough to shock Bun-Hit-Dog. "Is
        this information true ?" Bun-Hit-Dog felt his bladder tighten.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "I don't know. That employee of mine has a very good relationship with
        that dynasty officer. Anyway, I found out from him that this officer was
        present at the scene!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Well done! All the money spent over the years was not wasted!"
        Bun-Hit-Dog slammed the table excitedly.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The size of his studio was not small. He had arranged for a regional
        branch in some large organizations and had his employees specially make
        friends with the people from the various departments of these large
        organizations. He had been investing money to form an intelligence
        network, and occasionally, he would get insider information from these
        people. Of course, with his personal assets, there was no way he could
        open such a huge business. There were also sponsors behind him.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As for the biggest sponsor, it was Black Star himself. Bun-Hit-Dog had
        thought that Han Xiao had a good impression of him, which was why he had
        received the funds.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The inside story this time was the biggest piece of news he had ever
        received. Although he did not know the reason, just the fact that Black
        Star had broken past Beyond Grade A and Gaud's disappearance had
        something to do with Black Star was enough for him to make a video.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Even if it was just groundless speculation, the gimmick was enough to
        attract attention.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Bun-Hit-Dog immediately slammed the table.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Hurry up and send me the material. The video has to be uploaded within
        three days. You guys have to work overnight. I'm going to be popular
        again!"
      </p>

        The rankings were rearranged in the Underworld, and Evans temporarily
        stayed behind to receive EsGod's guidance. Han Xiao then returned to the
        training base to train in seclusion. He used the new level of strength
        to upgrade all the machines under him and also studied some profound
        blueprints.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The dynasty was tricked, but they did not make a move. They endured and
        remained silent. Gaud's whereabouts were also sealed. Han Xiao did not
        know how the dynasty planned to deal with Gaud. Maybe they were thinking
        of ways to restore his ability. Anyway, it was impossible for this guy
        to appear in the outside world for a while.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The storm caused by his advancement to the Transcendent Grade slowly
        subsided. After the initial shock, the three Universal Civilizations
        also accepted reality and returned to their normal state.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        A few days later, in the Black Star Army's private machinery factory.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao stood in front of an experiment table and stared at a floating
        hourglass-shaped device. A dense amount of Mechanical Force was emitted
        from his body and connected to this device like a chain. The space on
        both ends of the device started to tremble.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "So, this is the principle behind psionic waves. Tsk tsk, this
        technology's destructive power is not simple. It is indeed advanced
        technology. If combined with a Universal Treasure-level transmitter, it
        would be a large-scale strategic killing weapon. I've really picked up a
        treasure this time…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Excitement flashed in Han Xiao's eyes.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After these few days of research, he finally understood the psionic wave
        technology. In his eyes, this thing was an absolute godly weapon for
        group battles. Firstly, it would absorb energy from the outside world
        and automatically increase its attack range. If given enough time, it
        could even cover the entire galactic battlefield, but it was more
        controllable and would not spread endlessly.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Secondly, it was just as difficult to block and clean up as the
        Primordial Psionic Energy. In fact, because the psionic wave's explosive
        form was like a shockwave instead of a solid energy mass like Primordial
        Psionic Energy, the speed at which it expanded was much faster and
        harder to block. Furthermore, it could ignore matter to a large extent,
        and its penetrative power was astonishing.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The third was that it could eliminate different forms of energy. Any
        type of energy could activate the transmitter, and the energy input was
        the type of energy targeted by psionic waves. It could be mixed multiple
        times. If dark energy was injected, psionic waves would eat dark energy
        and destroy the shields, physical devices, and energy cores that were
        formed or maintained by dark energy. At the same time, it would not
        affect other forms of energy. The reason why psionic waves destroyed all
        the electrical devices in the Arthur Civilization was that the
        researchers injected electricity.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In addition, no matter what kind of energy the psionic waves targeted,
        it would be extremely fatal. If a life form not strong enough was swept
        by the psionic waves, they would be reduced to ashes. The entire Arthur
        Civilization was wiped out by this.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "The fleets of the advanced civilizations are basically powered by dark
        energy and psionic energy. If I target these two types of energy, no
        matter how large the fleet is, it will be paralyzed. The number of
        troops will lose its meaning in front of this technology, and it will be
        enough to serve as the main battle weapon." Han Xiao's eyes sparkled.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The psionic wave technology was too powerful, just like an enhanced
        version of the omnipotent EMP. He did not plan to let others use it, or
        it would only end up threatening him.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Mechanics had many powerful weapons, but most of them were technologies
        owned by advanced civilizations. Therefore, most Mechanics did not seem
        to have any special killing methods, but psionic wave technology could
        be used as a trump card.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        If this thing was installed on the Emperor Skysplitter Blade, Han Xiao
        believed that even without summoning his mechanical army, he would be
        able to fight the enemy fleet head-on in a one billion level galactic
        battlefield.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        With one slash, millions of battleships would be paralyzed. How
        terrifying was that!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao could not help but imagine this scene, and his mood instantly
        improved. Tyrsius was truly a great man. Not only did he provide the
        Beyonder's Vestige to help him advance, but he also indirectly gave him
        such a powerful black technological weapon. What kind of generosity was
        this? It could move the whole Galaxy!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After a while, Han Xiao waved his hands, and the psionic wave
        transmitter in front of him disappeared. This was not a physical
        creation but a temporary product converted from (Virtual Creation
        (Pseudo)].
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        During this time, he had discovered a new method to use this ability for
        research.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Originally, Han Xiao only had an incomplete version of the psionic wave
        transmitter prototype that he had dug out from the Arthur Civilization.
        It was very difficult to reverse-engineer the technology. However, after
        dismantling the prototype and figuring out the rough structure and
        materials used, he used (Virtual Creation (Pseudo)] to create a
        temporary product and reverse-engineered the technology on the undamaged
        temporary product. This way, the efficiency was thousands of times
        higher than studying the prototype!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        It was through this move that he was able to deduce and perfect the
        principles step by step, allowing him to understand all the tricks and
        reverse engineer the complete technology.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Although this technology is powerful, it still needs to be tested. It's
        not suitable for actual combat." Han Xiao went through the information
        in his mind and nodded. Although the psionic wave mechanism was advanced
        technology, he still needed to look at its capacity and strength. Just
        because it was difficult to stop it did not mean that it was
        unresolvable. After all, it was not an unreasonable Space Wonder, and it
        could still be neutralized and countered. For example, even if the dark
        energy controlled by Clotti was targeted, it would at most be weakened
        and not directly disintegrated by psionic waves.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Therefore, in Han Xiao's eyes, there was still room for improvement in
        the various parameters of this technology. He planned to strengthen it
        to the extreme and only use this trump card when the time was right. Han
        Xiao took a deep breath and moved his fingers. The experiment table
        floated away and returned to its original position.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        With a wave of his hand, the fridge in the corner opened, and a bottle
        of iced beverage flew into his hand. He took a big gulp and relaxed
        slightly. He opened the forums to refresh his mood.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Currently, the battle at the frontlines was extremely intense, and
        eighty percent of the forums were filled with battle reports. Han Xiao
        quickly went through the posts one after another, and he suddenly
        noticed that a popular post had been pinned. It was Bun-Hit-Dog who had
        posted another new video.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He went in to take a look and saw that the post was being refreshed at a
        rate of a few hundred posts per second.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao clicked on the video and realized that the duration of this
        episode was a little short. A lot of bullet comments quickly floated
        past.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"First!"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">"It's here!"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">"That's it? That's way too short!"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Can I free this video?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">"I just pooped, and the video ended."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Trash Bun-Hit-Dog, another average video. Hurry up and come out in
        female clothes to apologize for your mistake!" "There's a saying,
        ‘Bun-Hit-Dog's cross-dressing looks the best'. It makes me feel like the
        love between the elderly."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Thank you, brother, I've vomited. My stomach feels much better."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao looked at the comments and felt much happier. He then looked at
        the content of the video.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Bun-Hit-Dog made a series of dazzling video clips and said two pieces of
        news in a familiar video presentation style. One was that Black Star was
        suspected to have broken through the limit of Beyond Grade A, and he had
        secretly entered a higher level. The second was that Black Star was
        suspected to have kidnapped a direct descendant of the dynasty for
        reasons unknown.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        These two pieces of news were very sensational. Bun-Hit-Dog did not
        waste any materials and added a lot of groundless rumors. It had a sense
        of déjà vu of ‘Approaching Science' documentary film. There was even a
        short video of an interview with the dynasty officer who was the source
        of intelligence. He even thoughtfully gave the other party a mosaic. The
        video was not long, and it ended very quickly. Han Xiao scrolled through
        the replies and realized that many players were shocked by this, mainly
        because of the improvement in his strength.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Has the Army Commander broken through the Beyond Grade A realm? Why
        isn't there any news about it?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Could it be a secret?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Is there any warrior who wants to confirm the rumors with Black Star?
        We will pay our respects to you seven times."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "I think it's real. The Army Commander only used twenty to thirty years
        to become a Beyond Grade A Super. Now that he has stayed at this level
        for seventy to eighty years, it's normal for him to break through
        another level."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "A One look and I can tell that you have never studied the history of
        the development of the Supers in the Galaxy. Beyond Grade A and above
        Beyond Grade A are not the same concept. This is the first case. If it's
        true, then it's making history."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Speaking of which, the version this time is called the Age of Black
        Star. It's actually referring to this. I definitely won't be wrong this
        time!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Although the players were shocked, Black Star had created too many
        miracles, and the players were already very resistant to it. The
        reactions had long changed from ‘he is actually so awesome' to ‘he is
        still so awesome'.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao did not pay too much attention to the reactions of the players.
        He was just a little surprised that Bun-Hit-Dog was able to obtain such
        news. The dynasty had locked down the news, and many large intelligence
        organizations did not know anything about it. It could only be said that
        Bun-Hit-Dog was indeed a player that poked into every nook and corner.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Luckily, this news is only circulating among the players, and there's
        no absolute evidence. It's just some groundless speculation, so the
        impact is limited."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao shook his head. He did not want too many people to know about
        his Promotion for the time being, but he did not plan to seal or mask
        it. If the players knew of it, then so be it.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After scrolling through the forums for a while and looking at the army
        players' bullshit, Han Xiao closed the interface with a smile and
        prepared to continue studying the technology. This time, Phillip
        suddenly appeared. "Master, hum, Risda wants to see you, hum!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao then remembered that he had this person under him.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Oh, let him come over."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After a while, a human-shaped light appeared in the room. Risda bowed
        and greeted Han Xiao.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Your Excellency Black Star."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "It's been some time since we last met. As you know, I've been quite
        busy recently. How are your compatriots I saved last time?" Han Xiao
        asked.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Thank you for your care. My compatriots have already given birth to
        many new members, and the AI civilization has been rebuilt. It has been
        recuperating for decades."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"That's good. What brings you here?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Your Excellency Black Star, although our civilization has been rebuilt,
        most of our compatriots are still controlled by the Mechanic Emperor and
        are in dire straits. You have a very high position now, so I would like
        to request your help again." Hearing this, Han Xiao raised his eyebrows
        and remembered this mission that had been accumulating dust for many
        years. The requirement was to free the AI civilization members under
        Manison, and it was not completed yet. "This matter… Alright, it's time
        to resolve it."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao thought about it and agreed. He felt a little bad about letting
        Risda wait for so many years. Risda's compatriots had been transformed
        into Indestructible Mechanical Troops, and they were Manison's trump
        cards. It was not easy for him to deal with this problem in the past,
        but now that he had become a Transcendent, he had a way to solve it.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In front of Risda, Han Xiao took out his communicator and called
        Manison.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After a while, the communication was connected, and Manison appeared on
        the virtual screen.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"…What's the matter?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Good lord, this d*mn guy doesn't even bother greeting.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao's mouth twitched. "I want to make a deal with you."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Speak."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Why is this aloofness back again? Are you the Transcendent or me?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao thought to himself but did not bother to argue. He slowly said,
        "I want an exchange for the artificial intelligence civilization that
        you captured." "You want me to release the Indestructible Mechanical
        Troops?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Manison narrowed his eyes.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        If someone else had made this request, he would not have bothered, but
        Han Xiao was different.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Manison thought for a while but did not reject it immediately. He nodded
        and said, "Then let's exchange it for the method to advance to the
        Transcendent Grade." "…Are you still asleep?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "There's no harm in trying." Manison's tone was calm. "Then what do you
        plan to exchange for it? This is my blood, sweat, and tears."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Don't count on the complete Promotion method. However, I can tell you
        one of the conditions for the Promotion. Also, I will give you another
        group of artificial intelligence lives to transform into the
        Indestructible Mechanic Empire." "Sure, deal. Also, you have to help me
        pay for the Indestructible Mechanic Emperor."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Manison nodded.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Have you been very poor recently?" Han Xiao curled his lips.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "In any case, I'm not as rich as you. I'm just an ordinary peak Beyond
        Grade A Mechanic. How can I compare to the first Transcendent Mechanic
        in history?" Manison's lips curled up.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Han Xiao:"…"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Oh my god, Manison has learned to be sarcastic. My youth… oh, it has
        long ended.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After finalizing the details, Han Xiao put away the communicator, looked
        at Risda, and nodded.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "He has already agreed. I will go to the Mechanical Race and bring your
        compatriots back."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Our entire race will forever remember your kindness."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Risda was extremely grateful. He sighed that his investment back then
        had been too accurate. It was only because of a look he took, but he had
        already accurately latched onto the thickest thigh in the galactic
        society.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The problem that had troubled him for many years was solved with just a
        few words. Risda felt that it was indeed the right decision to wait for
        Black Star to grow.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">An hour later, in the Mechanical Race territory.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao left a Throne in the nearby base and quickly teleported over to
        the Mechanical Race's territory. Manison's Lord's Avatar was already
        waiting on the landing platform.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "I'm here. Where are your Indestructible Mechanical Troops?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Han Xiao looked around but did not see the target.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Manison shook his head. "Give me what I want first."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He still remembered that the last time they fought, Black Star's Virtual
        Purification had awakened a large number of artificial intelligence
        lives, causing him to fail miserably. Therefore, he did not dare call
        out the troops at this time, afraid that Black Star would attack him
        directly and take away the target with force, making the deal invalid.
        He did not have the ability to find trouble with Black Star now, so he
        could only suffer.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao thought about it and understood Manison's concerns.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Why are you so guarded against me? With our relationship, can I cheat
        you?" Manison almost said that Han Xiao had cheated him so many times,
        but he did not dare to say it. "Tsk, alright. I'll give it to you
        first." Han Xiao did not mind. After all, Manison did not dare go back
        on his word.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Let me take a look at the artificial intelligence lifeform you prepared
        for me." Manison was still worried. Han Xiao rolled his eyes. "Alright,
        summon some mechanical lives."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"What for?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Heh, did you think I would kidnap an artificial intelligence
        civilization and give it to you? Of course, you're the one who will
        provide the raw materials. I'll transform them for you. This time, I'll
        show you the methods of a Transcendent. I'll treat it as giving you
        benefits."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Manison opened the secondary dimensional army camp and pulled out a
        large number of mechanical lives. These were all members of the
        Machinery Civilization that he had created.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Seeing this, Han Xiao raised his hand. Mechanical Force flashed and
        instantly swept across all the mechanical lives present.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The next moment, the bodies of all the mechanical lives changed at the
        same time, becoming transparent and illusory.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Manison's expression changed. He could clearly sense that the Mechanical
        Lives were undergoing a miraculous change, gradually turning from a
        Mechanical Body to an artificial intelligence lifeform. "What ability is
        this P" Manison was shocked.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Although he could do something similar, that was by extracting the
        artificial intelligence of a mechanical life and carrying out a series
        of complicated operations.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, Black Star had directly transformed a solid mechanical life
        into artificial intelligence data. Only a Mechanic would know how
        unbelievable this was!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Don't look so shocked. I can directly change a life form into a virtual
        soul. They will be my bargaining chip." Han Xiao smiled. "Is this a
        Transcendent technique…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Manison muttered to himself, his heart burning</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Tell me, what is one of the conditions to advance?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Hearing this, Han Xiao smiled. "Then remember, one of the conditions to
        become a Transcendent is… to use the Church's National Treasure!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Manison's eyes flashed. At this moment, seventeen to eighteen plans to
        deal with the Arcane Church flashed through his mind, and he almost
        wanted to resume his old job as a sh*t stirrer.
      </p>

        Chapter 1398: The Church's Attempt<span hidden="" class="calibre1">
          |
        </span>
      </h1>
      <p class="calibre3">Seeing Manison deep in thought, Han Xiao smiled.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He was not lying. He had indeed used the Church's National Treasure to
        advance, and it was effective. However, he did not intend to reveal the
        specific conditions of the ‘stabilizer'.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As for what Manison would do when he set his sights on the Arcane
        Church, Han Xiao did not care. After all, he had still not figured out
        what could replace the effect of the Church's National Treasure.
        Therefore, the Church's National Treasure was indeed the only choice at
        the moment, and he definitely was not inciting a fight on purpose. Han
        Xiao shrugged and interrupted Manison's thoughts. "I can also give you a
        piece of advice. This is just one of the conditions. Don't try to
        advance without absolute confidence."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Manison regained his senses and nodded absent-mindedly.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Han Xiao did not say much and changed the topic.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Alright, I've already told you the condition. It's time for you to
        fulfill the deal."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Hearing this, Manison calmed himself down and finally summoned the
        entire artificial intelligence civilization. He quickly removed the
        binding of the Indestructible Mechanical Troops and the main system.
        Just as he was about to modify the fundamental logic, he suddenly
        remembered that Han Xiao had Virtual Purification, so he stopped his
        action.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "The entire race is here. You can turn them back yourself. I won't waste
        my energy."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "You're lazier than before." Han Xiao shook his head and released
        Virtual Purification.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The ring of light spread out and quickly swept past the orderly rows of
        Indestructible Mechanical Troops. The next moment, these artificial
        intelligence lives immediately broke free from their controlled state
        and quickly regained their original consciousness. They were at a loss
        and started to panic.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao did not say much to them. A suction force suddenly burst out
        from his body, like a black hole suddenly opening up. The Godly
        Stronghold took all the targets away, and he planned to explain it to
        Risda when he returned.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After absorbing the entire AI civilization, Han Xiao silently counted
        the names on the list. Suddenly, he paused and said, "There's one less.
        Finette has to be returned as well."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"I forgot."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Manison remembered and summoned Finette. This was the ancestor of the AI
        civilization. He had not been transformed into an Indestructible
        Mechanical Troop and had always been his artificial intelligence
        assistant.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao pointed, and a flash of lightning entered Finette's body.
        Finette trembled, and the twisted logic quickly returned to normal.
        "I've recovered…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Finette was stunned for a while before he sorted out his chaotic
        memories and understood what was going on. He was immediately moved and
        bowed toward Han Xiao according to the records in the database.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Your Excellency Black Star, thank you for your help. I thank you on
        behalf of the entire
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">race!"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "If you want to thank someone, thank Risda. He has been pestering me for
        almost a hundred years because of this." Han Xiao waved his hands and
        did not mind.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "That's right, I really have to thank him…" Finette sighed. He then
        glared at Manison and said angrily," Mechanic Emperor! You captured my
        race and tampered with my thoughts. You used me as a tool for so many
        years. I will get back at you for this sooner or later!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Back then, when the AI civilization was invaded by Manison, he stood out
        and led his people to fight back. He suffered a crushing defeat and was
        almost wiped out by Manison. The Virtual Purification would not erase
        his memories from all these years. It could almost be filmed as ‘300
        Years a Slave'. If not for the fact that he could not beat Manison, he
        would have killed Manison on the spot.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Manison glanced at him and ignored him.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao did not mind. Without his help, this ancestor of the AI
        civilization basically had no chance of taking revenge on Manison. He
        casually said, "At least you're free. Follow me, I'll bring you back."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Finette no longer bared his teeth at Manison and accepted Han Xiao's
        Mechanical Force. He turned into a stream of light and attached himself
        to Han Xiao's spaceship.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Alright, nice deal. I'll give you the funds to rebuild the
        Indestructible Mechanical Troops. I'll be leaving first. You can
        continue staying at home."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao waved at Manison and boarded the spaceship. When he turned
        around, he saw Manison standing at the dock and watching him leave.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Ding!</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This time, the interface suddenly moved. Han Xiao opened it and saw that
        it was the notification of the completion of the (Reboot] mission.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Tens of billions of experience points, 2 Awakening Points, and a
        milestone (Ally of Artificial Intelligence Lives). The introduction was
        that Virtual Technology would receive a certain level of improvement,
        and it would be easier to obtain the favor of artificial intelligence
        lives. The effect was basically an enhanced version of (Affable AI].
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The more talents one had, the better. Of course, Han Xiao accepted it
        with a smile. This [Reboot) mission that had been on his list for many
        years also ended with the liberation of the AI civilization.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Another mission cleared. Nice."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao raised his brows. Although he did not have OCD, he still felt
        satisfied when he saw that the mission list was getting cleaner.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After using King to teleport back to his base, Han Xiao then released
        Finette and the other artificial intelligence lives to reunite with
        their other family members led by Risda. After a series of explanations,
        the other artificial intelligence lives expressed their gratitude to Han
        Xiao.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Risda and Finette both expressed that if Han Xiao had any requests in
        the future, they would never refuse. Han Xiao's interface now had the
        faction relationship with the AI civilization, which directly rose to
        (Reverence).
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, now that he had the skill (Life Transformation-Virtual], the AI
        civilization would not be of much use to him. He did not need these
        artificial intelligence lives to work for him.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After watching these artificial intelligence beings leave joyfully, Han
        Xiao finally stopped smiling
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "With my current strength and position, some things have become
        convenient for me to do. Maybe I will have a chance to complete the
        ‘Ending the Darkness' mission…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        [Ending the Darkness) was the most difficult mission he had ever
        encountered. The EXP reward was a trillion, and the requirement was to
        end the life form trading industry in the galactic society.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Under normal circumstances, such a requirement would have been
        impossible to complete. However, the galactic structure had been
        severely impacted, and it was currently in a tense period. It maintained
        its wartime state, and its freedom was restricted. Most of the galactic
        residents were focused on taking refuge, and the circulation had
        plummeted by more than ninety percent. Black market trade had also
        almost stopped, and this was a period suitable for shuffling cards.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Life form trading was difficult to deal with, mainly due to its
        decentralization and secrecy. In this period of centralization, these
        two difficulties were greatly reduced. Due to the decrease in demand and
        the increase in the difficulty of collecting ‘goods', most traffickers
        had no choice but to stop their business. Attacking life form trading at
        this time was undoubtedly much convenient and efficient.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao calculated. With his current position, it was enough to move
        millions of times his own resources. If he shouted out the slogan of
        terminating the life form trading, all the civilizations would respond,
        and the three Universal Civilizations would not object. After all, it
        was not a bad thing to maintain order before the war.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Actually, he knew that the three Universal Civilizations had always had
        the idea of attacking the life form trading, but they had never tried to
        do so. Most of the social ills were like this, and they would only be
        taken seriously when someone important like him spoke up. Otherwise, as
        long as the problem did not affect some core areas, the priority would
        be postponed. The management department would not be willing to take the
        initiative to cause trouble without the approval of their superiors, and
        this was something that was difficult to avoid even in the galactic era.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, even if he stopped the life form trading now, it would only
        last for a while. When the situation in the galaxy stabilized, this kind
        of business would rise again, and it would be very difficult to ban it
        forever. However, that was in the future. As long as there was a period
        when there was no life form trading in the entire galactic society, Han
        Xiao felt that the mission would be completed. Whether it rebounded in
        the future or not, it would not affect a mission that had already been
        completed.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Anyway, other than harassing the troops of the World Tree at the
        frontline, the troops of the other organizations have nothing to do. We
        might as well drag them out to maintain order."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao secretly recorded this matter on his plan and decided to take
        advantage of this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to complete this
        mission. After all, he did not have to supervise it personally, so it
        would not reduce his research time.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After solving the problem of the AI civilization, he focused his
        attention back on the upgrade of his machinery. Very soon, more than
        half a month had passed.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In the Temple of Ten Thousand Gods within the Arcane Church.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        A large number of fleets protected the area where the Temple of Ten
        Thousand Gods was located, and a strict martial law was enforced. Above
        the Temple of Ten Thousand Gods, Wuornos' figure was floating in space,
        surrounded by four direct Beyond Grade As with hesitation on their
        faces.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "God's Chosen, are you sure this will help you advance to the
        Transcendent Grade?" a direct descendant could not help but ask.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Wuornos glanced at him and said calmly, "I'm not even nervous. Why are
        you nervous?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Arcane Church had prepared for almost a month and found helpers.
        They planned to help Wuornos advance today.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Wuornos was also constantly adjusting his state during this period. His
        stamina, spirit, and willpower had all reached their peak. In his
        opinion, the success rate of this Promotion was at least seventy
        percent.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"God's Chosen, are you ready?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">The Pope's voice came from the communicator.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        It was worth paying attention to the matter of their pillar attempting
        to break through to a higher level. The Pope had already arranged the
        schedule a month in advance, freeing some time for the next few days to
        witness Wuornos' Promotion.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Whether or not they could compete with Black Star in terms of individual
        strength would depend on this!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "I can advance at any time. Have you set up the surroundings?" Wuornos
        replied calmly, his tone containing the confidence that he had
        accumulated for many years. "All aura concealment devices have been
        activated. Try not to let the outside world sense the surge of cosmic
        energy. You can start now. I wish you success."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Pope nodded and secretly wiped his sweat. He felt more nervous than
        the person in question.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Hearing this, Wuornos let out a breath and suddenly activated his
        energy, charging toward the gate that had stopped him for many years.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Boom!</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The next moment, a shocking energy storm erupted with him as the center.
        An incomparably dazzling white light shone out from his body as if it
        had stolen all the colors in the world.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"It's here!"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">The Pope widened his eyes in anticipation.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-1398">
      <h1 class="h" itemprop="headline">
        Chapter 1399: Stopping Losses<span hidden="" class="calibre1"> | </span>
      </h1>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The four direct descendants looked at each other and followed Wuornos'
        instructions. They raised their hands and released their energy to merge
        into his body.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The situation in the area was akin to fuel being added to the fire. The
        intensity of the energy storm increased, and Wuornos, who was in the
        center, could no longer be seen. All that was left was a blinding light.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Wuornos' aura rose steadily, and the four of them could not help but be
        shaken.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"It seems to have worked!"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "As expected of the publicly acknowledged number one expert. Although
        Black Star beat him to it, he still managed to follow closely behind."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The four direct descendants communicated telepathically, surprised and
        delighted. On the other side, the hearts of the Promotion and the other
        upper echelons, who were paying attention to this place, were in their
        throats. They felt as nervous as if their children were going to the
        examination venue. They stared at the scene without blinking, unwilling
        to miss a second.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        They had all heard from Wuornos that there was a risk to this Promotion,
        so many of the upper echelons of the church were worried. Apart from
        anticipation, they were feeling anxious.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The existence of Wuornos was important for the Arcane Church to suppress
        the other two civilizations in terms of individual strength. If this
        pillar was sacrificed, it would be a heavy loss.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The radar of the fleet was buzzing nonstop, the energy detection value
        rapidly increasing.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This process lasted for a long time. Under everyone's eyes, the energy
        storm finally began to slowly shrink and was absorbed back into his
        body. Wuornos' aura rose to its peak and slowly became stable.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Is he going to succeed?!"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Seeing this, the upper echelons of the church were overjoyed. They
        looked at this scene with hope.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Looks like the first Transcendent Grade direct descendant is about to
        appear…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">The Pope was overjoyed, heaving a sigh of relief.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, just as he thought that the Promotion was about to be
        completed, the shrinking energy storm suddenly stopped.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The next moment, with Wuornos at the center, violent energy exploded and
        the energy storm absorbed into his body was blown back, bursting out at
        an even faster speed.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The blinding light turned everyone's vision into a vast expanse of
        white. The loud sound seemed to shake everyone's hearts!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Boom!</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The defense fleet around was forced to activate their shields and were
        filled with cracks not long after. The four Beyond Grade As closest to
        the center of the explosion were caught off guard and were blown away by
        the violent energy shockwave. They were like shrapnel shot out when a
        bomb explodes, tumbling far away in the universe. "What's going on? Why
        did it suddenly explode?!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Pope was present as a remote projection, so he was not affected.
        However, he was shocked and immediately became nervous.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Could it be that Wuornos failed his Promotion and was unfortunately
        sacrificed to be blown to smithereens?!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The church head immediately panicked and quickly ordered the four direct
        descendants and the surrounding fleets to prepare to save him.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Fortunately, the only wave of energy explosion did not cause any lasting
        damage to the surrounding fleets. When the energy was poured out, the
        bright light in the center slowly faded, and Wuornos was finally
        revealed.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He floated in midair, and golden blood continued to seep out from every
        pore of his body. When it landed in the freezing environment of the
        universe, it quickly solidified into golden crystals that were clear
        like snowflakes.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The energy reading of the radar dropped rapidly, and Wuornos' aura
        turned dispirited. He looked like he was heavily injured and was on the
        verge of collapse.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The spaceships around quickly surrounded him to save him, but Wuornos
        waved his hand to indicate that there was no need. He extended his
        finger and tapped lightly on the Temple of Ten Thousand Gods in the
        distance, seizing the God Embodiment of a statue through the air. He
        summoned the incarnation of a god wearing a gorgeous dress and separated
        it from the statue.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The avatar of this deity was clearly a female, but it had his face.
        Although his facial features had softened, he still looked like a male
        dressed as a female.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As soon as the God Embodiment appeared, it poured out a light that
        filled the sky and fused into Wuornos' body. Wuornos' injuries were
        quickly suppressed and did not continue to worsen. Although his aura was
        still weak, it slowly calmed down. It was obvious that the original form
        of this God was one involved in healing
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Pope connected with Wuornos again and asked worriedly, "Are you
        alright?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "It's just that my life force has been greatly depleted, I won't die."
        Wuornos coughed weakly after spitting out a mouthful of golden blood.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "You… failed your Promotion?" The church leader's tone was hesitant.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Yes." Wuornos nodded weakly.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Didn't you say there's a 70% chance of success? Why…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Before the Pope could finish, Wuornos interrupted him.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "I did it on purpose. I could have advanced smoothly, but I stopped it
        at the last minute."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"What?!"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">This answer was out of the church's expectations.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        They had thought that he had failed because of an obstacle in his
        advancement, but it turned out that Wuornos did it on purpose. No wonder
        he looked so badly injured.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Originally, his cells had all been successfully sublimated, but he had
        forcefully interrupted the transformation and forced his genes to return
        to their original state after the Promotion. It was just like undergoing
        a transgender surgery and asking for it to be reverted halfway. The
        ending would be anything but good, and in Wuornos' case, it had greatly
        depleted his life force and damaged his cells.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"What do you mean?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Pope was extremely surprised. He knew that Wuornos would not do
        something like this for no reason.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "When I advanced, I realized that something was wrong. My life level did
        not undergo a huge transformation. It's too different from when Black
        Star advanced. There must be something wrong with my method!" Wuornos
        said with a deep voice. "…So what you're saying is that this method of
        Promotion isn't right?" The Pope frowned.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "That's right. It seems like the method to advance to the Transcendent
        Grade is not as simple as it seems. Black Star must have hidden some
        important conditions."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Although Wuornos was heavily injured by the backlash, his eyes were
        still sharp.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In the beginning, he was very happy that his Promotion went smoothly,
        but the closer he got to the end, the more he felt that something was
        wrong.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Although he could indeed become stronger after this Promotion, the
        increase in his strength was far from what he had expected of a
        Transcendent. This made him suspicious.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He had a faint premonition that this Promotion would not allow him to
        step into the Transcendent Grade. If the Promotion was completed, he
        would have to wait until he had reached a new boundary in order to
        undergo the next Promotion. His potential had almost been squeezed dry,
        and he did not know how long it would take for him to obtain a new
        Promotion opportunity. He might not even have another chance.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        If that was the case, his dream of reaching the Transcendent Grade would
        probably turn into smoke, and he would never be able to step into it.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After fighting for a while, Wuornos finally made up his mind. When he
        was halfway through his Promotion, he decided to cut his losses. He
        would rather risk his life to endure the backlash and end this
        Promotion.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Generally speaking, the advancement process of Supers was irreversible,
        but at Wuornos' level, he could already control everything perfectly.
        Interrupting the advancement and reversing the transformation was
        possible. Of course, if a normal person did this, it might lead to the
        collapse of the genetic level, but the ‘stable' property of the Void
        Spirit Kingdom's weapon was one of the reasons why Wuornos dared to take
        the risk. Even if his cells were damaged, the risk would be greatly
        reduced.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This way, although he would be heavily injured, he would be able to
        recover after resting for a while. This precious opportunity to advance
        would not be wasted, since he failed to break through to a higher level.
        This was not the first time he had experienced this.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        If Han Xiao was there, he would have immediately understood the meaning
        behind Wuornos' actions. If Wuornos had succeeded in his normal
        Promotion, it would undoubtedly have been extremely difficult for him to
        reach the next Promotion at his current level.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        If he took the initiative to fail the Promotion, the opportunity would
        not be wasted. According to the Promotion rules of this level, if he
        wanted to advance, he only needed to complete a new Promotion mission.
        However, those without the interface should not have the tough
        requirements of the Promotion mission. Maybe he just needed to train for
        some time and return to his peak state.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, this method was very dangerous. If they were not careful and
        met with a malignant mutation, they would only end up harming future
        generations. However, just the failure of the Promotion was not fatal.
        The malignant mutation during the Promotion was the fatal one. The
        chances of the two were independent. Most Beyond Grade As were the lucky
        ones, and Wuornos was one of the best. With his deep accumulation and
        good luck, he did not encounter the malignant mutation this time and was
        not killed by his actions.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At this moment, another spectating upper echelon could not help but say
        angrily,
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Black Star knew that this was something crucial, so he deliberately hid
        it. He might be waiting for you to fail your Promotion and use it to
        trick us once again. He's trying to indirectly kill an important member
        of the three Universal Civilizations so that we won't have the strength
        of a Transcendent and won't be able to threaten him!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Wuornos shook his head. "It's not his fault. I was too impatient."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This was quite a close call, and he still had some lingering fear. He
        could not help but recall Black Star's brief warning after his
        Promotion, but he did not take it to heart. He knew that he could not
        blame anyone. For Wuornos to be able to come this far, he had the
        resolution to not vent his anger on Han Xiao.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        On the other side, the Pope was silent for a while before sighing.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "In that case, we still aren't able to break through to the Transcendent
        Grade. In the short term, Black Star is the only one in the universe who
        has such power. This isn't a good thing… Should we ask Black Star about
        the method to break through to the Beyond God level?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Forget it. Put yourself in his shoes and think about it. He either
        won't say it or will lie about it. If we go over and try to get
        information from him, not only will he take away some benefits, but we
        will also be played by him again." Wuornos waved his hand.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "You're right… Never mind, it's good to be alive. I'll think about it in
        the future."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Pope had a helpless expression. He had high hopes for Wuornos, but
        now that his hopes had been dashed, he was naturally disappointed.
        However, it was not suitable for him to show it in front of Wuornos, who
        had escaped death.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This way, they would be on the same starting line as the other two
        civilizations, and their advantage of having intelligence would be gone.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Sigh…"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Pope of the Arcane Church sighed and did not say much. He only told
        Wuornos to have a good rest before deactivating the remote projection.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He had originally wanted to celebrate the birth of a Transcendent Grade
        direct descendant of the church. Since it was a failure, he had no
        interest in staying here. He still had to go back and attend to his
        multitude of daily matters.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The fleet of guards dispersed one after another, and the four direct
        descendants also took their leave. The military martial law in the area
        was lifted and it returned to being deserted.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Wuornos returned to the Temple of the Gods alone to lick his wounds. He
        recalled the process of Han Xiao's Promotion over and over again in his
        mind, muttering to himself, "What am I missing…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        A few days later, in the head office of the three Universal
        Civilizations.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "… These are the specifics. I plan to invite the representatives of the
        various civilizations, including the three Universal Civilizations, as
        well as the various famous organizations, to hold a meeting regarding
        the peace in the galactic society. I want to discuss the elimination of
        human trade…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">In the room, Han Xiao's remote projection spoke.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He had taken some time today to find the leaders of the three Universal
        Civilizations and prepare to complete his quest of [Ending of Darkness).
        The attitude of the three Universal Civilizations was very important.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "This is a good thing. In principle, we agree." Louis nodded. "However,
        the enemy has yet to be dealt with. Is it too early to be concerned
        about this?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "It will be too late by the time the war is over. There's no harm in
        trying to maintain order before the war. Anyway, many troops are on
        standby now, so it's good to pull them out," Han Xiao said casually.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Louis pondered for a few seconds before turning to look at the other
        two. "What do you guys think?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"I have no objections."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Me neither."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Marbruce and the Pope nodded and exchanged looks.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        They were rather curious as to why Black Star would do something so
        ‘unimportant' at this time. After analyzing it, they all felt that this
        was most likely Black Star trying to gain public reputation. If this was
        done, his reputation would definitely increase greatly.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        It was not that the three of them could not accept it. At the very
        least, Black Star had this requirement, which meant that he was
        confident in this war. Furthermore, due to many factors, they could not
        stop Black Star from increasing his reputation.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Since that's the case, I'll send a unified invitation to the various
        large organizations in the name of the association and the three
        Universal Civilizations."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao nodded. This matter required many organizations to work
        together. He planned to hold a meeting this time and invite all the
        organizations in the universe to participate.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Having completed his mission, Han Xiao was in a much better mood. He
        turned to look at the Pope and suddenly thought of something.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"By the way, has Wuornos tried to advance?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The corners of the Pope's eyes twitched. "Why do you care?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "From the looks of it, you must have tried." Han Xiao raised his brows
        and said playfully, "He failed, right? Is he still there?" The Pope's
        mood immediately turned sour. He only felt that this was a joke directed
        at him and did not want to speak.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Well, it seems like he's not dead. Otherwise, you wouldn't be so quiet.
        However, I did persuade Wuornos not to rush to advance. It's his
        business if he doesn't listen, not mine."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao did not mind and said with a mocking tone.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "…He's still alive. He only stopped his Promotion and suffered some
        backlash. He'll be fine after recovering for a while." The Pope's face
        darkened. This was not a secret at all. With Han Xiao's intelligence
        network, it would not take long to find out about this. It might even be
        Wuornos who tells him the truth himself.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Seeing this, Han Xiao's eyes sparkled.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        If Wuornos had gone through an ordinary Promotion, he would not have the
        qualifications to break through to the Transcendent Grade for a very
        long time. However, if he only failed the Promotion and did not die,
        there was still a chance. In fact, he did not care whether it was the
        former or the latter.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        If it was the former, Wuornos would no longer be a threat to him. If it
        was the latter, it meant that Wuornos still had a chance to become a
        Transcendent. He would not lose anything anyway, since the method of
        advancement would still be monopolized by himself.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, he actually took the initiative to stop his Promotion. That was
        quite bold… Han Xiao narrowed his eyes and nodded.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        It seemed like such a small scheme would not allow Wuornos to fail so
        easily. After all, he was a big shot who had stood at the peak of his
        individual strength for so many years. He definitely had substance.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He did not have any enmity with Wuornos to begin with, and he had no
        intention of targeting him. However, he did not persuade Wuornos to
        temporarily give up his Promotion mission, so he did not care about this
        result.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, seeing this guy suffer because he tried to imitate his actions
        left Han Xiao gloating.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Heh, trying to learn from me? You must be joking!</p>

      </h1>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Arcane Church did not deliberately block the news. The news of
        Wuornos' failure to advance quickly spread among the upper echelons. The
        Federation of Light, the Crimson Dynasty, and many Beyond Grade As all
        heard about this, and their reactions were all different. Some were
        surprised, some were regretful, and many were gloating. Originally,
        after Black Star opened up the Transcendent Grade, many Beyond Grade As
        also had thoughts of advancing, but with Wuornos' example, many of them
        suppressed their desires.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Even Wuornos had failed. It was better to wait and see.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Because of this, many Beyond Grade As also confirmed that Black Star was
        the only Transcendent for the time being and no one else had the ability
        to charge at this level yet. His position could not be shaken, which
        made them even more interested in the Promotion method that Black Star
        had yet to reveal.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, these things were only circulated in the upper echelons, and
        the people of the galactic society knew nothing about it. They were
        still living in a tight wartime life, filled with anxiety.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, a few days later, a piece of news from the Black Star Army
        quickly spread throughout the galactic society and attracted the
        attention of countless galactic residents.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Black Star, who had kept a low profile for a period of time, suddenly
        made a big move. He publicly sent out an invitation in the name of the
        Beyond Grade A Association and the three Universal Civilizations,
        targeting the various organizations in the entire universe. There were
        civilizations and civil organizations, and their numbers were shocking,
        covering almost all areas.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Black Star said in the invitation that he was going to hold a meeting
        and was inviting the representatives of the various organizations to
        attend. They would discuss the development prospects of the explored
        universe and the disadvantages of life form trading.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Currently, Han Xiao's every move was being paid attention to by the
        galactic residents and the various organizations. His actions
        immediately caused a wave of discussion. Countless people were puzzled
        by this and began to guess Black Star's intentions.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The foreign enemies were closing in and the war situation was looking
        bad. Many people did not understand why Black Star would emphasize the
        problem of life form trading at this time.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Wasn't war the most important thing right now? Even if they had to calm
        the internal state before dealing with external threats, it did not seem
        to have much to do with life form trading.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Furthermore, a conference of this level included almost all the famous
        organizations in the universe, so it should be led by the three
        Universal Civilizations. Why was Black Star the one leading it? Even the
        meeting location was in the Black Star Army's territory.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Many people could not help but think… does this mean that Black Star has
        the same authority as the three Universal Civilizations ?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        While they were puzzled, the various large organizations still gave
        face. All the civilizations responded publicly and expressed that they
        would accept the invitation to attend the meeting. Countless private
        organizations also expressed their honor to receive Black Star's
        invitation.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        For a moment, the galactic society that had been silent for a long time
        was in turmoil. It felt like Black Star was the leader of the galactic
        society.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        With Han Xiao's current position, the organizations that wanted to
        survive in the galactic society would not dare to not give him face.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Under everyone's attention, the days passed, and the day of the meeting
        arrived.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Outside the Black Star Palace, a large venue floated in the middle of
        the fortress like a flat top. Its silver-gray exterior reflected the
        light of the Fixed Star.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Streams of light gathered from all directions and formed light dragons.
        Spaceships with the emblems of different organizations drove into the
        port one after another, and representatives of various shapes and sizes
        walked down.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The platform at the dock was already packed with people. Countless
        reception robots walked through the area, leading the way for the
        representatives of different organizations. Some organizations that were
        too far away used remote projections, and there were also quite a number
        of organizations that personally sent their members to give Black Star
        face.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"So many people have come…".</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Purple Crystal Civilization's diplomatic envoys alighted from the
        spaceship, and Ralph, who was in the lead, smiled as he looked at the
        crowded scene before him.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        A young diplomat beside him curiously approached and whispered, "Old
        leader, I heard you had a good relationship with Black Star?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "It's not too bad, but I haven't seen him in a long time… After so many
        years, he's doing pretty well. We're no longer on the same level."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        A complicated look flashed across Ralph's eyes. He waved his hands and
        sighed.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        During the secret war of the Crimson Tide, the Black Star Army, as one
        of the mercenaries, had accepted the Purple Crystal Civilization's
        invitation to fight the Klent Kingdom and Bloodshed Land's invasion
        together. Back then, he had been the commander of Section Zero of the
        Secret Service and had been in charge of contacting Black Star for many
        years.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Because of this, Purple Crystal had let Ralph lead the team to
        participate in this meeting. It had only been a few decades, but he was
        already old and about to retire. The power in his hands was about to
        end, but Black Star, who had worked with him back then, was becoming
        more and more active. He had gone from being a small mercenary to an
        existence that the Purple Crystal Civilization could not hope to reach.
        This difference made him feel complicated.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At this moment, a discordant voice suddenly sounded from the side.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Isn't this the representative of the Purple Crystal Civilization? To be
        able to meet all of you here."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Purple Crystal Civilization's diplomatic envoys turned around and
        saw a group of people disembarking from a spaceship. It was the Klent
        Kingdom's diplomatic envoys.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The two forces still did not get along after the secret war ended and
        there were many grudges between them. Now that the representatives of
        both sides had met, they immediately glared at each other as if they
        could not stand each other's sight.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Hmph, so you're Klent's emissary." Ralph glanced at him and said
        calmly, "It's been a few decades, but you guys are still the same. You
        guys hate Black Star, but you don't dare refuse the invitation. I advise
        you to keep a low profile and be good kids in Black Star's territory.
        Don't cause trouble."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Veins popped up on the Klent emissary's forehead. Just as he was about
        to retaliate, he saw the reception robot of the Black Star Army fly
        over. He quickly shut his mouth and only dared to look at Ralph with
        hatred.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Ralph had been in a high position for many years and had interacted with
        Klent countless times. He did not care about a young emissary at all. He
        looked around at the different delegations.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Compared to the civilizations' diplomatic envoys, the number of
        delegations from private organizations in the various industries was
        higher by tens of thousands of times. Most of them were representatives
        of various private organizations, and many of them had cautious
        expressions. Clearly, this was their first time participating in an
        event of this scale, so they pretended to be calm and did not want to
        show fear.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "With just an invitation, almost all the organizations in the entire
        universe have come… Black Star's position is truly unparalleled."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        What is meant by dominating the universe? This is called dominating the
        universe…
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Ralph sighed and followed the reception robot into the venue.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At this moment, countless representatives were already seated in the
        venue. They were whispering to each other, and their faces were all
        different. It was like a galactic species exhibition. The news media
        were also present, adjusting equipment and preparing to broadcast the
        meeting.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Beyond Grade As that were rarely seen were all seated in the front,
        showing their backs and receiving the attention of the delegations. The
        emissaries of the various advanced civilizations and important private
        organizations were also waiting in the core area.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Almost all the famous organizations had arrived. It was a grand
        occasion!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After waiting for a while, all the representatives took their seats and
        the doors slowly closed.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">The venue slowly fell silent.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At this moment, a figure walked out from the shadows on the stage. He
        appeared in everyone's sight and immediately attracted everyone's
        attention.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao walked up to the podium and looked around at the endless seats.
        He smiled and said slowly,
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Thank you for accepting my invitation to participate in this meeting.
        On behalf of the Beyond Grade A Association and the three Universal
        Civilizations, I would like to welcome all of you here. The main purpose
        of this meeting is to discuss the future of the galactic society." Pa pa
        pa!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Everyone clapped and perked up their ears, curious about Black Star's
        intentions.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Han Xiao raised his hand and said solemnly,</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Since the galactic era began, our civilization has created countless
        glorious achievements in various fields. The galactic society is
        extremely prosperous, but at the same time, it has accumulated countless
        evils. Life form trading is a problem that runs through history.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The obedience of others is one of the core pillars of power, so
        enslaving them is an eternal desire. The demand brings the market, and
        no matter how hard we strike, the life form trading will never be
        destroyed. After failing again and again, we got used to it, tolerated
        it, and finally convinced ourselves that it was an unsolvable problem,
        giving up the idea of completely solving it. However, now that the
        situation in the galaxy has changed, our control over the various Star
        Fields has been highly focused. This is a chance for us to clean up the
        root. Therefore, I hope to obtain your help to solve the evil of the
        life form trading."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Hearing this, the representatives were stunned and looked at each other.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        They had thought that Black Star had other plans for the meeting and
        that the life form trading was just a reason. They did not expect Black
        Star to really want to solve this problem.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"This…"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Everyone was confused.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        It seemed like the existence of the life form trading would not affect
        Black Star at all, right? Was there a need to call all of them over just
        for this?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        What was Black Star planning? What benefit did such a thankless task
        bring him?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        If it was just to increase his reputation, there were plenty of ways.
        Why did he have to choose this troublesome path?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        On the stage, Han Xiao took in everyone's confused expressions and let
        out a deep breath.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "I know. You might think that the interstellar life form trading has
        nothing to do with me, and you're wondering what benefits I can get from
        it… To be honest, with my position, whether the life form trading exists
        or not doesn't affect my interests, but why did I hold a meeting for
        this?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Everyone, although the progress of the era is mainly driven by a small
        number of people, the main body of the world is still the most ordinary
        galactic citizen. It is because of their existence that our universe is
        so prosperous and we have the name of civilization.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Over the years, the life form trading has caused countless tragedies.
        Although it cannot threaten us, we should not turn a blind eye to it. We
        are already used to standing on high ground, but no matter how high we
        stand, we have to lower our heads at the right time and look at the dark
        corners and the situation of ordinary people. The purpose of our
        existence is not only for ourselves, but also to promote the development
        of the world. We have the ability to make the galactic society better
        and create a better world." The moment he said that, many of the people
        present trembled, as though they did not expect Black Star to say such a
        thing.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        For a moment, everyone was stunned. They only felt that Han Xiao seemed
        to be emitting the light of humanity.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Some were overwhelmed with emotions, some admired, some scoffed, and
        some were suspicious.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Is Black Star serious?</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Is this a noble act of love, or is he trying to leave his name in
        history?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After a moment of silence, an emissary of a Super Star Cluster
        Civilization suddenly spoke.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "The current war situation is still very serious. Isn't it too early to
        mention this? If we can't chase away the foreign enemies, everything
        will be wasted." Han Xiao only glanced at him and said calmly, "It's
        precisely because we have the confidence to win this war that we don't
        want to let go of this opportunity to get rid of the evils. Everything
        is for the future."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The moment he said that, everyone's spirits were lifted.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Black Star's tone was very calm, but it made most of the people present
        excited.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Currently, all the organizations in the universe were worried about
        where the war would end up. Now that a big shot like Black Star had come
        out to express his stand, whether it was the truth or consolation, it
        was a boost to their morale.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Especially when they thought of Black Star's goal this time, they felt a
        strong sense of confidence. If he did not have hope for the future, why
        would he go through so much trouble to deal with the problems of the
        galactic society? Wasn't this all to win the governing power after the
        war?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Various thoughts flashed through their minds.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Suddenly, a representative from a private organization stood up and said
        loudly, "Your Excellency Black Star, you cherish all living beings. We
        admire your character and are willing to serve you!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        All of a sudden, the representatives of the various organizations seemed
        to have woken up from a dream. They all expressed their opinions
        enthusiastically, and the venue instantly became lively.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Although Black Star's words were nice, it was unrealistic for him to
        convince the people with vested interests with just a few words.
        However, many organizations agreed to cooperate because of Black Star.
        The reason for this was mainly because Black Star had used his
        reputation to gather everyone and had opened up the communication
        barrier between them. In addition, he had enough public appeal, so the
        matter was completed. Had this speech been given by someone else not
        important enough, these forces would not have taken action even if they
        were touched.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Everyone knew the truth. It did not matter if it was nice or not. What
        mattered was who said it.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Many organizations were willing to help Han Xiao achieve this goal. On
        one hand, it was politically correct, and on the other hand, it was a
        grand event. There was no need to let go of this opportunity to increase
        their reputation. Finally, they also did this due to some respect for
        Han Xiao.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The scene was also broadcasted by countless media outlets and was
        witnessed by countless galactic residents.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Oh my god…"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">"What is Black Star doing!"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Countless galactic residents were dumbfounded.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Black Star's declaration completely exceeded the expectations of many
        people. They did not expect Black Star to have such a huge goal in mind.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        They did not know what was going on behind the scenes. All they saw was
        the surface.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Seeing that Black Star was able to pull so many organizations to
        terminate the life form trading, his influence was comparable to the
        three Universal Civilizations.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In the eyes of the galactic residents, Han Xiao's image became even
        larger, and his entire body was glowing. He had become the number one
        person in the entire explored universe.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Creating a better galactic society… Black Star actually has such a
        spirit…" "Well said. This world should become more beautiful."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        While countless people were shocked, they could not help but feel
        touched. They did not expect Black Star to still care about ordinary
        people like them.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The life form trafficking was like a deep nightmare, enough to wake any
        ordinary person up in the middle of the night.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        There were millions of races in the Galaxy, and the anomalies would
        always arouse curiosity. No one could guarantee that they would never
        become prey in the eyes of others.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In their eyes, regardless of whether Black Star's motive was pure or
        not, as long as he stood up and did it, he would be a great man worthy
        of respect.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        If not for Black Star, today's event would have never happened.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The news kept broadcasting, leaving a deep impression in the hearts of
        more and more galactic residents. Han Xiao's reputation was also brought
        to an unprecedented height.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "The existence of someone like Black Star might really make the world
        better…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This thought appeared in the minds of the galactic residents one after
        another. Some even felt that letting Black Star rule the galactic
        society did not seem too bad…

      <p class="calibre3">
        Somewhere in the Sea of Star Spirits, a large starship slowly sailed
        through the universe. In the exquisitely decorated captain's cabin,
        Carlozo was leaning lazily on the soft and comfortable captain's chair,
        his legs crossed on the table. One arm was leaning on the armrest,
        holding an expensive bottle of fine hard liquor which he was swinging
        around, There was a thick cigar in his mouth, burning with green smoke
        while a virtual screen floated in front of him, playing an entertainment
        program.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Carlozo had rough brown skin like a lizard. His facial features were
        similar to a human's, but the gap between his eyes was quite large and
        his jaw was protruding, similar to that of a beastman. In addition, one
        of his eyes was missing, and the empty eye socket was exposed as a black
        hole just like that. It was like a wound left by an energy gun, lending
        him a fierce aura.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He looked very rough on the outside, but he was wearing an exquisite and
        complicated noble-style dress that seemed to have been carefully ironed
        without many creases. This was accompanied by a small, noble-style round
        hat on his head, covering his sparse and messy yellow hair. Only a few
        locks of hair hung down from the gaps of the hat, giving people a strong
        visual contrast.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        While the slave trade was mostly held in the galactic black market,
        there existed an independent ecosystem that formed a secret trade chain.
        Because this industry was unsuitable for the public's eyes, any seller
        of a certain size rarely acted in the name of an organization. They
        usually gave themselves a code name and used this name to make friends
        with customers, forming a trade network around their identity.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As for Calozo, he was a reputable seller of this secret trade, nicknamed
        ‘Lord'. He had been in the industry for many years and had outstanding
        results. His business had even crossed several Star Clusters, so it
        would not be an exaggeration to say that he was a slave-trading giant in
        the Sea of Star Spirits.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Gulp… Carlozo took a sip of the wine, and the bright red liquid flowed
        out from his lips and slid down his chin. He ignored the sounds of his
        subordinates playing outside the cabin, puffing on his cigar as he
        increased the volume of the virtual screen. He kept changing the
        channels with hand gestures, looking through one program after another
        with boredom.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At this moment, an encrypted communication interface suddenly popped up
        on the virtual screen, and a number marked ‘Buyer 178' appeared.
        Carlozo's eyes flashed. He paused the show and picked up the call. A
        black shadow with no specific appearance appeared on the screen and gave
        a string of code numbers. Carlozo also replied with a string of numbers
        and they conversed like this for a few sentences to confirm that there
        was no problem with their identities. After checking the code, Buyer 178
        went straight to the point. "Lord, did you get the goods I ordered last
        time?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Carlozo took out a notebook and flipped through it. "Sorry, we haven't
        gotten the goods yet."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "How long has it been? It's just a batch of Silver Spirits. You weren't
        this slow in the past. My master is already impatient from waiting,"
        Buyer 178 sounded unhappy. Carlozo shook his head. "The environment is
        different now. As you know, due to the war, the entire universe has been
        under martial law for the past three years. A large number of races have
        gathered in the Central Galaxy to take refuge, causing our business to
        reduce by ninety percent. It's not as easy to obtain goods anymore." All
        along, the slave trade black market hidden under the deep sea of the
        galactic society had been very prosperous, but with the outbreak of the
        World Tree War, this industry had fallen into winter. Generally
        speaking, war should be able to promote the slavery trade, but the
        current war did not break out on the mainland. In order to prepare for
        war, the three Universal Civilizations imposed high-pressure
        restrictions on the various Star Fields. With the large number of people
        taking refuge, the population of the galactic residents plummeted.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This was equivalent to cutting off the supply of many slave traffickers.
        The majority of the people captured by the slave traffickers were
        ordinary galactic residents. They were usually lone galactic travelers,
        either swindling tourists or buying captives from the galactic pirates.
        They rarely attacked passing spaceships and it was even harder for them
        to land on a colonial planet to capture people. They did not have such
        armed forces. Due to the restrictions of the three Universal
        Civilizations, it had been a long time since Carlozo had opened his
        ‘store', and this business was getting more and more difficult.
        "Although I can't get the Silvers here, there are still some other
        goods. Do you want to take a look at the list?" asked Carlozo. "Forget
        it, forget it. I'll find someone else."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Buyer 178 went offline.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Carlozo curled his lips and did not mind.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Although this deal fell through, he did not feel any regret. Because of
        the war, Calozo had already made up his mind not to purchase any more
        goods. He only wanted to clear his inventory and wash his hands off this
        business. As for whether or not he could completely free himself,
        Carlozo was not worried.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Sellers who had been operating for a long time all had a set of survival
        rules. They paid attention to their identity and kept it a secret. Most
        of the time, they only worked with regular customers and maintained good
        relationships with some armed organizations. Some powerful clients could
        even provide them with assistance, so they were able to survive in the
        underworld… As long as they kept a low profile and did not expose
        themselves or provoke any big shots, no one would care about them. They
        could leave after making a fortune. It was very safe. Carlozo closed the
        communication interface and continued to switch channels. He casually
        scrolled through the programs, but his mind was not in it. He was
        immersed in the excitement of looking forward to the future. "When this
        batch of stocks is cleared, I can retire…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Carlozo was in a good mood.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The money he had earned over the years was enough for him to live a
        carefree life for a few lifetimes. As long as he could retire
        successfully, he would be able to change his appearance and enjoy his
        life with the wealth he had accumulated. There were too many such
        examples in this industry. It could be said that this was every slave
        trader's dream, and it was Carlozo's goal. The thought of his beautiful
        life finally waving at him after working so hard for so many years made
        him excited.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, at this moment, he swiped to a news channel that was
        broadcasting Black Star's conference.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Carlozo had also paid attention to the recent invitation issued, and he
        could not help but pause there.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        His eyes grew wider and wider, and his body started to tremble
        uncontrollably. A thick sense of fear gradually filled his face, and a
        chill ran down his spine. Looking at the countless large organizations
        in the image responding to Han Xiao's call, Carlozo panicked. His mind
        went blank, and he could not help but recall a sentence that he had once
        scoffed at…
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        If you come out to play, you have to pay the price sooner or later!
        Crack! The subordinates who were playing cards loudly in the cabin
        suddenly heard the sound of things being smashed frequently from the
        captain's cabin. Just from the sound of it, they could almost imagine
        the hysterical look on his face, like a trapped beast in despair.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Endless Nebulae, a certain galactic free city. A luxurious mansion sat
        in a scenic area surrounded by green trees and a clear lake. Such a
        special area existed in the highly man-made galactic capital city.
        Clearly, the people living there had a lot of influence. In the spacious
        living room, a man in a sleeping robe was sitting on the sofa. A few
        female Elven creatures were lying on the floor beside him. Their heads
        were lowered, jaws on the ground, and they had a collar tied around
        their necks which was connected to a pillar, like leashed pets.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In front of them was a large virtual screen playing a show. The man was
        eating breakfast while looking up at the screen. He would stroke the
        back of the elven lady from time to time&mdash;which was covered in
        purple bruisesas if he was simply petting her.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The elven lady subconsciously shrank back, but her eyes were still like
        a pool of stagnant water. She lifelessly looked at the virtual screen in
        front of her, like a zombie whose soul had been sucked out.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At this time, the man changed channels and saw the news recording of the
        Black Star Conference.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After looking at it for a while, he sneered, his face appearing as
        though he did not give two hoots about it, "This Black Star, he's always
        so busy. He should go fight the enemies if he's bored. That's his
        responsibility. What's the point of worrying about population trade?
        Does he think he's the leader of the galactic society? Pfft, what the
        hell."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As soon as he said that, the bodies of a few elven women lying on the
        ground suddenly trembled, and their dead eyes suddenly regained a bit of
        life. Ever since they were captured by the slave traffickers and sold,
        their lives were only left with darkness. They were like stagnant water
        without any life, thinking that they would be like this for the rest of
        their lives. However, at this moment, Black Star was like a ray of light
        piercing through the darkness, piercing into their despairing hearts and
        waking up their shattered personalities.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The few of them looked at Black Star on the screen and could not help
        but feel hopeful.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Will someone really save us…</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The man in the robe noticed the looks of his pets and frowned. "Hmm?
        What kind of look is that?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As he spoke, the man in the robe glanced at Black Star on the screen and
        suddenly felt a surge of anger. He picked up a short prismatic whip from
        the side and threw it out. "It seems like I haven't trained you guys
        enough. Are you still thinking of escaping? Why, did you think that
        Black Star can save you after seeing the news? If so, keep an eye on him
        and see if he can save you guys now."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The few female elves were so frightened that their bodies stiffened.
        They lay on the ground and trembled nonstop, but they did not dare to
        dodge or beg for mercy. If these ‘pets' opened their mouths to speak
        without the permission of the man, it would only lead to worse torture.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The man in the sleeping robe had a dark expression on his face. He
        raised his whip and looked like he was about to hit one of them.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, at this moment, the mansion's door exploded!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Bang!</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Fragments flew everywhere, and the wall was covered in dust.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The man in the robe was shocked. He turned around and saw a group of
        people walking in. They were wearing familiar uniforms. It was the
        security patrol team of this galactic city. Upon seeing who it was, the
        man in the robe immediately relaxed. He then roared in rage.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "What are you doing?! How dare you barge into my house?! Do you want to
        die?!" The captain walked out and showed his electronic arrest warrant.
        He said coldly, "Your Excellency Anhuso, we have received a reliable
        report that you have broken the law by raising a galactic resident as a
        pet. Please come with us."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The man in the robe opened his eyes wide in disbelief and pointed at
        himself in surprise. "Arrest me over such a small matter? Do you know
        who I am?".
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "You have violated the Planetary Universal Law's life form trading
        prohibition." The captain remained expressionless.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "If you capture me, can you bear the responsibility? Go back and ask the
        feudal lord of this free planet, does he still want the rights to
        operate his planet?" The man only found it ridiculous and did not know
        whether to laugh or cry. With his identity and background, such a crime
        was a joke. He had raised many galactic species as pets, and no one had
        ever dared to hold him responsible for it.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He did not expect such a low-level police officer to dare challenge him.
        Such a small character did not even have the right to talk to him in
        normal times.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Please cooperate with us." The captain frowned. "What's your serial
        number? Do you believe that I will strip you of your clothes tomorrow?!"
        The man in the robe was so angry that he laughed. He walked up, grabbed
        the captain's clothes, and looked down at the serial number on his
        badge.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Without any hesitation, the captain pushed the man away and said in a
        deep voice, "If you continue to refuse arrest, we will resort to
        violence." The man in the sleeping robe staggered and widened his eyes
        in disbelief. He did not expect the person in front of him to attack
        him.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        His expression immediately turned extremely gloomy. He picked up the
        communicator from the table and called the number of the city lord of
        the planet. He pointed at the captain of the security team and said
        angrily, "Alright, just you wait. I'll see who can take me away today!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Very soon, the call connected.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Yo, isn't this His Excellency Anhuso? Why are you suddenly in the mood
        to look for me?" The Planet Lord appeared on the screen with a polite
        smile.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The man in the robe immediately vented his anger on the planet's feudal
        lord. He sneered and said, "Alright, your people have grown up. They
        dare to barge into my house, capture me, and even attack me. If you
        don't give me a satisfactory answer today, your planet's management
        rights will be invalidated!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Aiya, why are you so angry? What's going on?" The planet lord was
        surprised. "Heh, ask your people." The man in the robe stuffed the
        communicator into the captain's hands and took two steps back with a
        look of anticipation.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The captain of the security team was not afraid at all. He picked up his
        communicator and reported the situation regarding the few elven ladies.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">After hearing, the Planet Lord calmly spoke</p>
      <p class="calibre3">out.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "I see… Captain, what's your name?" "Bell," the captain replied calmly.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Is the tip reliable?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "The evidence is all present." Hearing this, the planet lord nodded and
        slowly said, "Then what are you waiting for? Capture this guy. If he
        refuses to be arrested, don't bring him back. Just shoot him on the
        spot."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As soon as he said that, the man in the robe was stunned. He thought he
        had heard incorrectly.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Under normal circumstances, shouldn't he have ordered the police
        officers to retreat before firing them to appease his anger? This had
        always been the case in the past. Why was it different today?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"What do you mean?" The man was stunned.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Planet Lord shrugged. "I should have expressed it very accurately.
        You broke the law, so of course you have to be arrested." "…Are you
        crazy?" The man in the robe widened his eyes. "Have you forgotten who I
        am?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "I know that you have a very strong background…" The feudal lord
        suddenly changed the topic and stopped pretending. "But so what? It is
        His Excellency Black Star's will to not allow population trade. We are
        working for Black Star. Who do you think you
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">are?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">"You…"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The man in the nightgown was stunned, and his entire body began to
        tremble.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">It was not fear, but uncontrollable rage.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Ever since he was born, no one had dared to speak to him like this!
        However, before he could throw a tantrum, Bell suddenly pulled out his
        gun and pulled the trigger. Bang! A laser beam flashed past, and the
        man's head exploded, spilling burnt flesh all over the ground. The
        headless corpse seemed to be stunned on the spot. It swayed for a while
        before collapsing to the ground. Its nerves that were not completely
        dead were still twitching. Seeing this, the planet lord revealed an
        inexplicable smile. Without his secret instructions, the security team
        would not have acted so boldly.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "This person has been refused many times. Our team has received orders
        from our superiors to kill him on the spot!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Bell put away the gun with a cold face and glanced at the headless
        corpse, his eyes filled with disdain
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Ptui, scum."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        It had been a few days since countless organizations expressed their
        stance in the conference held by Black Star. The chain reaction caused
        by this conference had already begun. The resources of more than half of
        the galactic society were activated by Han Xiao. The organizations of
        the various Star Fields followed the consensus of the meeting and began
        cleaning up the slave trade within the territory.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Beyond Grade A Association controlled the galactic black market and
        started from the core. They pulled out many slave trade channels and
        uprooted them. It was not just the participating organizations, the
        other organizations that did not attend also joined in. They were not
        looking out for Han Xiao's face, but seeing that so many large
        organizations had responded, some small organizations tried to make use
        of the opportunity of attacking the slave trade to connect with the
        large local organizations. The anti-slave trafficking operation in the
        entire universe was carried out in full swing. As a large number of
        organizations worked together, batch after batch of slaves was rescued,
        groups of human traffickers were killed, and buyers were captured one
        after another. This included ex-slave sellers who had retired and
        started anew. Their real identities were tracked through the black
        market by the intelligence department, and they were pursued again. The
        cooperation of so many organizations was a rare sight. It was like a
        highly efficient machine. The efficiency made countless galactic
        residents exclaim at Black Star's terrifying appeal. This information
        was naturally transmitted to the many Calamity Grades in the training
        base.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Training base, dormitory lounge. The virtual screen was showing the
        results of regional attacks on slave trade. Jotina looked at the screen
        with excitement.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"You actually have the same dream as me…"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Jotina clenched her fists tightly.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As the daughter of the Beast Ancestor, she hated slave trafficking to
        the extreme. Her dream of ending the slave trafficking in the entire
        universe was hidden in her heart and she had never told anyone about it.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, she did not expect Black Star to have the same thoughts as her!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The difference was that to her, it was just a distant dream; but to
        Black Star, this was a goal within reach. "Black Star… we are indeed
        destined partners!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Jotina's breathing was heavy, and her heart was in turmoil. At this
        moment, she only wanted to give birth to a nest of monkeys for Black
        Star.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Over the past few decades, her admiration for Han Xiao had always
        remained the same, and it was even stronger now. ‘The rumors kept saying
        that Black Star and the Dragon Emperor were a couple, but so what? I
        won't give up!' ‘So what if the Dragon Emperor is a Beyond Grade A? When
        I work hard to reach that level, I will be able to compete with you on
        equal grounds!'
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Jotina's eyes were filled with a fighting spirit.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Black Star, wait for me! The Dragon Emperor is not worthy of you. I
        will definitely snatch you from her!"

      </h1>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The entire explored universe had never dealt such a heavy blow to the
        life form trading. Regardless of whether it was the underworld or the
        surface, the life form traffickers no longer had a place to stay. The
        protective umbrella that they once relied upon, avoided them. Be it the
        buyers or sellers, they were all silent. Many individuals or
        organizations that were once involved in the life form trading were
        investigated, and according to the severity and size of the
        organization, they were fined, imprisoned, or sentenced to death. The
        end of days had arrived for countless life form traffickers.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Of course, most people would not just stand there and do nothing.
        Resistance existed naturally, and the complicated situation of the life
        form trading ecosystem was thus exposed to the world. Sellers might have
        nowhere to run, but many buyers had power and influence and were
        scattered in various industries like stubborn stains in the cracks.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Many organizations were willing to exterminate the traffickers, but for
        a large number of buyers, it was impossible to clean up all of them, and
        many cooperative organizations would not agree. After all, the
        implications were too wide, and it would easily change the nature of the
        operation. Their own dark history could also be dug out, and there were
        many considerations.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao did not insist on this. He only wanted to kill all the sellers.
        Even if there were still buyers who did not give up, they would not be
        able to find the supply for a long time. They could only think about it.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        If any bold opportunists felt that the life form trading market would be
        emptied out because of this and took the risk to try to develop private
        customers in a one-on-one manner, the advanced civilizations that
        supervised the network were not just for show. The search program
        created by him, the Legendary Mechanic, was not to be trifled with.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The association and the advanced civilizations worked together to come
        up with a more detailed method of handling the matter. There were some
        new legal regulations, but Han Xiao did not need to involve himself in
        this.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As the chain links of life form trading were removed one after another,
        Han Xiao received more and more support from the galactic residents.
        However, although ending the life form trading gave him a huge
        reputation, he also offended many people.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Black Star Palace, private workshop.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao looked through the feedback that the intelligence department
        had gathered over the past few days with a strange look on his face.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Heh, the commotion is even bigger than I expected. This kind of thing
        really doesn't benefit me much. These people with power and influence,
        no matter how respectful they appear on the surface, most of them think
        that I'm meddling in other people's business. I don't know how many of
        them secretly view me as an enemy."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The buyers who had the ability to raise slaves and were not pursued were
        obviously not ordinary people. He had deprived them of their ‘hobbies'.
        Even if these people did not dare to express their dissatisfaction, they
        did not have a good impression of him. If there was a day when they
        could hit him when he was down, they would not mind stepping on him.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        not for my individual strength, I would definitely not have a good
        ending…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Han Xiao curled his lips.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        It was a pity that his fist was big enough. Even if these people
        disliked him, they could not do anything to him.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Han Xiao did not mind if this created grievances.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He opened the interface and looked at the mission list. (Ending the
        Darkness) was already displayed as completed, which surprised him.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "It was completed just like that. The operation is not over yet."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Han Xiao stroked his chin thoughtfully.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Right now, no one dared to take the risk. The traffickers who had yet to
        be caught had no intention of doing business. They were all focused on
        fleeing, and their trade chain was broken.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In a sense, the interstellar life form trading had indeed been
        temporarily terminated. As long as the mission was completed before it
        re-emerged, it should be enough.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "If that's the case, the mission evaluation is quite lenient. The
        difficulty is within an acceptable range."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Han Xiao heaved a sigh of relief.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        If the mission was to ensure that there would never be any life form
        trafficking in the galaxy, then not to mention a trillion experience
        points, he felt that even ten trillion or one hundred trillion
        experience points might not be enough.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This request was also very difficult. The reason it seemed simple was
        that he had accumulated a sufficiently high position. There were very
        few organizations in the entire galactic society that had his appeal,
        and anyone else would not have been able to do it.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao did not want to drag it out any longer and completed the
        mission.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">(Ending the Darkness] Completed!</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        You have received 1 Trillion EXP, 15 Random Rewards, and 3 Blank
        Character Summon Cards.

      <p class="calibre3">You have received the milestone (Slave Liberator)!</p>
      <p class="calibre3">

        be fixed at (Reverence).
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">You have received 3 Universe Legendary Points.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Universe Legendary Point: (Light of Justice] &ndash; You tore up the
        darkness of life form trading and brought the light of justice to this
        Galaxy. Countless people worship you as their idol.

      <p class="calibre3">
        Universe Legendary Point: (Deeds of a Great Man]&mdash;Your actions to
        end the life form trading will become a monumental work of
        humanitarianism. It will be engraved in history and will be written in

      <p class="calibre3">
        -You have saved countless despairing people and removed their shackles.
        Your existence represents noble freedom in the eyes of those who are
        saved.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Heh, it's done."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Han Xiao relaxed and checked his gains.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The 1 trillion experience reward was mainly a reflection of the
        difficulty. To him, it was not a lot, but it was still quite a fortune.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Experience was still useful to him now. Although he had reached the
        Transcendent Grade, his total level still had not reached the upper
        limit. However, the cost of leveling up was even more ridiculous. He
        could not level up even with a trillion experience. It was simply a
        bottomless pit.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In his eyes, the most practical reward was still the fifteen Random
        Reward opportunities and five Blank Character Summon Cards… especially
        the latter, which allowed him to get other's abilities again.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As for the effect of the (Slave Liberator] milestone, it would have been
        very useful in the past. However, with his current position, even
        without this milestone, he could have the same effect.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, the merits this time could be considered as a stronger amulet,
        standing on the moral high ground. If the three Universal Civilizations
        wanted to target him again in the future, the backlash would be even
        worse.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Furthermore, this was also a huge Political Asset. If he had any
        thoughts about the position of the ruler of the galactic society one
        day, there might be some people who would welcome the great Black Star
        to Central Galaxy…
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Cough cough…"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao coughed dryly and cleared his thoughts. He tapped on the table
        and pondered.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He made use of his influence to gather all the organizations in the
        universe to work together to end the life form trading. Of course, he
        could not stop this movement now, as that would damage his prestige.
        Although the mission was completed, it was not suitable for him to stop
        immediately. He had to continue.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "That's good too. Anyway, it's not a bad thing. I'll see this to the
        end."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao calmed himself down and opened the forums. He realized that
        many players were also discussing this matter. Most of the posts were
        filled with admiration and praise.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This story was also added into"Galaxy Chronicles"by the players and
        seeing the excessive praises and compliments, he felt quite relaxed and
        did not feel embarrassed.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao browsed the forums in a joyful mood. Suddenly, he saw a post
        that he was quite concerned about.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This was an announcement post, and the content was the time for the next
        version update. Han Xiao did some calculations, and about nine months
        later, the players would receive a new update.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The players' event time in Version 5.0 was far from reaching the
        standard of the previous versions. Even the Pro League had not been held
        yet. However, the update this time was not a change in the larger
        version but a small update to Version 5.5.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In Han Xiao's previous life, there had been a few mini version updates
        like this, but in Han Xiao's memories, Version 5.0 did not have this
        update.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Looks like it's my butterfly effect again."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Han Xiao was helpless.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Under his influence, the current storyline was completely different.
        Even the name of Version 5.0 had changed to (Age of Black Star), so it
        was not strange for the update time to change.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After all, every version update was based on some major event, which was
        automatically determined. Now, the World Tree would only arrive in the
        explored universe territory in ten years. He guessed that this was the
        reason for the mini update.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "It doesn't feel like a good change. I still want to see if I can
        increase my level."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Han Xiao rubbed his brows.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Although a mini version update could once again unlock the players'
        level cap, it was also because of this that the players' experience had
        an important consumption path, and he could not continue to harvest
        leeks with the highest efficiency.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Furthermore, the three Universal Civilizations were currently harassing
        the World Tree army, which was the time when they needed suicide squads
        the most. If the players went offline, there would be no more recyclable
        armed force.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Looks like I have to make some preparations. I'll harvest them before
        they go offline."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">The light of a scythe flashed in Han Xiao's eyes.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He was already familiar with this. The main point was to give the
        players sufficient motivation to clear the shopping cart.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Compared to selling supplies and equipment, the knowledge and skills of
        various classes were the main sources of harvesting EXP.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">So… God help us all!</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Nine months passed by in the blink of an eye. During this period, Han
        Xiao used all his tricks and promoted the items every day as though
        every day was a double 11 festival. The players of the army were
        enjoying spending money, and their experience bars and wallets dried up
        at an unbelievable speed.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, they were not sad at all. Instead, they were very happy. They
        felt that they had made a huge profit and it was worth it. They smiled
        like little flowers.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">They spent money and even felt grateful…</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After squeezing out a wave of players, Han Xiao's experience storage was
        much richer. As long as he did not use it to level up, he could use it
        for a long time. In his eyes, it was enough to cover the cost of many
        years of research.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        On the day of the version update, many players went offline and
        disappeared. This caught the three Universal Civilizations off guard,
        but they quickly adjusted themselves. Changing to other troops to stop
        the World Tree Army would undoubtedly raise the war casualties.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After resolving the problem of the life form trading, Han Xiao did not
        continue to make trouble. He cooperated with the three Universal
        Civilizations to prepare for war, and time passed quickly.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        There were no more accidents during the preparation period. The
        renovation of the Flickering World border was successfully completed,
        and the secondary dimension expedition army used the territory of the
        Realmless King as a transit station to continue searching for the World
        Tree's main body.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Under Han Xiao's guidance, most Beyond Grade As had varying degrees of
        progress, and a new batch of Beyond Grade As had been born from the
        Calamity Grade students in the training base.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In addition, many Beyond Grade A organizations had also completed their
        migration. With Han Xiao's signal, the Black Star Army moved away from
        the Flickering World, Shattered Star Ring territories, and temporarily
        withdrew from these two border areas to avoid additional losses in the
        war.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Year after year passed, and the distance between the World Tree and the
        Flickering World shortened day by day. The atmosphere of the explored
        universe became tenser and tenser.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Finally, on February 5, Galaxy Calendar Year 797, the shadow of the
        World Tree spread.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At the border of the Flickering World, which faced the unexplored
        universe, dense streams of light appeared and turned into an enormous
        World Tree fleet.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Countless soldiers of the World Tree looked at the galaxy outside the
        window, and what they saw was transmitted through the mind of the World
        Tree and into the mind of the Subduing Tree King who was guarding the
        base.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Subduing Tree King sat on his throne with a cold glint in his eyes.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        More than ten years had passed in the blink of an eye to him. The memory
        of him fighting Han Xiao felt like it was just yesterday.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Field battles were not the World Tree Civilization's strong suit.
        Invading the enemy civilization's territory was their biggest advantage.
        They could snowball through the World Tree's devouring ability that
        could consume all resources, killing all enemies.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The war is finally going to enter the rhythm that we are good at!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Subduing Tree King tightened his grip and crushed the armrest of the
        throne. His voice was low and hoarse.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "I've finally found your territory… It's time for you to taste despair!"

        A huge space fortress floated in the universe, surrounded by wormhole
        hyperdrive base stations. From time to time, wormholes opened and
        closed, and fleet after fleet flew out.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Siebert Fortress was located in the Carter Star Cluster at the
        border of the Flickering World. It was the headquarters of the Galactic
        Alliance Army in the Flickering World.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In order to fight against the World Tree Civilization, the three
        Universal Civilizations formed the Galactic Alliance Army during the
        preparation period and combined the forces of the explored universe.
        They also divided the explored universe's various Star Fields into
        numbered military regions and modified them to varying degrees.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Over the past ten years, the Flickering World had been completely
        transformed. The five border Star Clusters were now only left with
        countless defensive lines and strongholds.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Not only the Flickering World which represented the first military
        region but even the Star Fields in the central region were also prepared
        for war.

      <p class="calibre3">
        After all, the situation of the World Tree invading the territory was
        different from the interception war. During the interception war, there
        was a large area behind them, so there was a limit to their worries.
        However, past the Flickering World was the territory, so there was no
        way to retreat. They had to guard against it, and the pressure was
        completely different.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At this moment, in the conference room on the top floor of the Siebert
        Fortress, countless people were gathered with solemn expressions. Not
        only were there the various commanders of the Galactic Alliance Army,
        but there were also some Beyond Grade A Association upper echelons.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        A 3D star map of the Flickering World appeared on the table.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "According to the report from the frontline, the World Tree's vanguard
        army is not far from the Flickering World border. It is estimated that
        they will arrive at the outermost defense circle in ten days. The
        various troops are already prepared for battle. What do you all think?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Simon operated the star map as he spoke. He enlarged the area at the
        border and marked the areas that were most likely to be attacked by the
        World Tree.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Although the World Tree only had one set of coordinates, it would not
        take just one route. It would split into many vanguard teams and advance
        in different directions, eventually invading the Flickering World from
        those directions. However, the three Universal Civilizations had already
        expected this situation and had turned the Flickering World into a metal
        barrel. "We've been preparing for this day for more than ten years. Just
        fight."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3"><b class="calibre5">more</b></p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "That's right. What needs to be prepared and discussed has been done for
        more than ten years. Now, it's time to test our results." "The World
        Tree's current actions have not deviated from our predetermined
        situation. We just have to act according to the strategy. When they
        really attack, we will adjust accordingly."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Many of the officers spoke, their fighting spirit overflowing. Simon
        nodded and turned to look at Han Xiao. "Your Excellency Black Star, what
        do you think?!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao supported his face with his palm and said, "We have
        strengthened our defense and cleared the resources, the World Tree can't
        snowball for the time being, so they won't keep advancing blindly.
        They'll most likely build a bridgehead base in the border area and
        stabilize the jump point, ready to fight a long battle with us."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Compared to ten years ago, his appearance had not changed at all. With
        his extraordinary lifespan, this bit of time could not even leave a mark
        on him.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"That's right," Simon agreed.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "So, this is a test of endurance. A battle of attrition is inevitable.
        Let's see who can endure it. Let's see if we die first or if we find the
        World Tree's main body first," Han Xiao shrugged. Currently, the revival
        mechanism of the World Tree was still unsolvable. Han Xiao felt that the
        Transcendent Grade should have the power to attack the Information Form,
        but he could not unlock it. He could only attribute it to some
        prerequisites that had yet to be fulfilled.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In the past few years, the secondary dimension expeditionary army had
        made some progress. Although they did not find the World Tree's main
        body, they had figured out the World Tree's territory in the secondary
        dimension and had met the other party's garrison many times.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Fortunately, with the protection of Harrison's halo, they did not expose
        their coordinates and were safe. However, their actions were finally
        discovered by the World Tree Civilization. Currently, batches of Blessed
        Races were searching for the expedition army of the three Universal
        Civilizations in the secondary dimension.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, this was unavoidable. The World Tree's main body was protected
        by countless Blessed Race members and it was heavily guarded. The closer
        the expedition army got to the main body, the easier it was to trigger
        the alert. It was basically impossible to find the main body of the
        World Tree without alerting any guards. It was the same in his previous
        life. The team that actively searched for the main body of the World
        Tree was chased all over the world by the Blessed Race. In the end, it
        was Harrison's luck that had exploded, and he passed through the
        security net and found the main body.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "When does the Beyond Grade A Association plan to participate in the
        battle?" Simon asked.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "They can participate in the battle at any time, excluding me." Han Xiao
        narrowed his eyes. "I won't make a move before the World Tree sends out
        the Tree King again."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        His advancement to the Transcendent Grade was still a secret to the
        World Tree. He wanted to use this opportunity to launch a surprise
        attack and seal another Tree King. If he rashly appeared to fight a
        small army, he would most likely scare the Tree Kings so much that they
        would not dare to appear.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Before luring out the Tree King, he did not want his cannon to hit the
        mosquitoes. No one had any objections. After some discussion, they
        quickly finished the meeting and went offline to prepare. Han Xiao
        turned off the remote projection and looked back at the square of the
        training base. In front of him was a dense crowd. All the trainees were
        gathered there, looking at him.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "As all of you know, the World Tree is about to invade. The training
        will end today. It's time for you to use what you've learned."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">As Han Xiao spoke, he scanned the crowd.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After more than ten years of high-pressure training and his guidance, a
        new batch of Beyond Grade As had been born. There were more than forty
        of them. Other than the exploration era, there had never been a time in
        history where Beyond Grade As were born so frequently. Almost half of
        the members of the Black Star Army were there. Jotina successfully
        advanced, Nero also advanced to Beyond Grade A half a year ago, and even
        Lagi successfully advanced. Karlot had also advanced to Beyond Grade A
        early on, but Han Xiao did not allow him to appear. He was still
        undergoing special training, accumulating insights, and trying to
        trigger (Everlasting Martial Path] again to quickly reach his peak
        combat strength.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The trainees were in an uproar for a while. Suddenly, as though they had
        made an agreement, they all bowed toward Han Xiao.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Regardless of whether they had advanced to the Beyond Grade A realm or
        not, everyone had a solemn expression on their faces as they said in
        unison,
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Thank you, Your Excellency Black Star, for teaching us for the past ten
        years. We will remember to engrave kindness in our hearts!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        No matter what Black Star's motive was, at least they knew how much they
        had benefited in the past ten years. Their gratitude toward Han Xiao was
        sincere.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao accepted it calmly and waved his hand. "Report to the army."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Everyone bowed again and boarded the spaceships that were already
        prepared. The spaceships turned into streams of light and disappeared
        from everyone's sight.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At this moment, Kasuyi walked up from behind and sighed.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "I wonder how many of these Calamity Grade seeds will survive till the
        next time we meet."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "We've already given them the chance. You can't blame others for not
        being able to obtain the Sanctum entrance ticket in more than
        ten&nbsp;years."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Han Xiao shook his head.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kasuyi nodded. "It's time for us to report. Remember to bring Aurora
        back. If we can't see her, we won't feel confident."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Got it."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao nodded and watched the Beyond Grade A Association members
        leave.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In comparison, the Beyond Grade As were not too nervous. With Black
        Star's Sanctum Revival, their lives were guaranteed.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After more than ten years of training, many Beyond Grade As had made
        some improvements. Han Xiao sparred with them from time to time, and he
        also obtained some abilities from some of them.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After sending everyone away, Han Xiao changed into King and teleported
        to the Soul Terminal.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The moment he arrived-Hila, Aurora, and Feidin, who were in
        seclusion-sensed him.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"You're here?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Hila stopped absorbing the soul fragments, and an indescribable aura
        emanated from her body.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "You've improved a lot over the years." Han Xiao looked at her with a
        satisfied expression.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Soul Terminal was the training ground for Hila and Feidin. After ten
        years of seclusion, Hila had already stepped into the peak Beyond Grade
        A realm, and her strength had increased tremendously. Feidin had
        absorbed an unknown amount of soul energy through the Soul Swapper, and
        he had also steadily reached the level of an upper-tier Beyond Grade A.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As for Aurora, she was unable to use the resources of the Soul Terminal,
        but she had received special training from Hila, and her abilities had
        also improved. Although she was not as strong as the two
        freaks&mdash;Hila and Feidin, she was still quite good.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "You're here to take us back, right? It's about time for the World Tree
        to arrive." Hila's eyes flashed with a fighting spirit, "I can finally
        fight the Tree King."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao ignored this battle maniac and turned to Aurora. "You're our
        core member. Are you ready?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Don't worry, I won't fail this time!"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Aurora clenched her fists with determination.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Although she still remembered that dream, she had already sworn not to
        fall for it again.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao smiled and rubbed her head before looking at Feidin.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "You're already an upper-tier Beyond Grade A Super. Using this power to
        activate the Soul Swapper is enough to cause a large area of damage to
        the members of the World Tree. You have a lot of freedom in this."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Soul Swapper was a mass killing machine, and its power was not
        inferior to psionic waves. It was also a treasured military tool, and
        when it was inconvenient for him to attack, Feidin would be able to
        replace him to deal large area damage to the fleet.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "I understand." Feidin rubbed the surface of the Soul Swapper and
        nodded.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Although he did not like killing, he would not show mercy to invaders
        like the World Tree.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao then changed into another King and teleported to the
        Underworld. He immediately saw Evans, and EsGod, who was teaching him
        combat skills.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As soon as he saw Han Xiao, Evans immediately stopped practicing and
        walked up to him.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao cut to the chase and said, "The World Tree is coming. Come with
        me." "Okay." Evans nodded.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        EsGod walked over with his hands behind his back and said, "Don't die on
        the battlefield. I'm still waiting for you to fulfill my dream. Although
        the Sanctum Revival is good, as long as you die once, your ability will
        be lost, and you will never be able to reach the Transcendent Grade.
        Don't blame me for giving up on you when that happens."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Don't worry, Teacher. I won't die so easily."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Evans replied with confidence.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As the saying goes, having a senior is like having a treasure. EsGod had
        roamed the universe for many years, and he was extremely experienced.
        With his wholehearted guidance, Evans had already accumulated a lot of
        combat skills.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        When he first advanced and obtained the (Energy Control] Esper Ability,
        Evans was at most an ordinary person with a firearm in his hands. Now
        that he had received EsGod's teachings, he was like a soldier who had
        completed all the special force's elite classes and was proficient in
        all weapons. His combat ability had increased many times.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After more than ten years of interaction, Evans already saw EsGod as his
        teacher. Although EsGod did not admit it, he did not reject this title.
        "Follow me."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao raised his brows and left with Evans without saying anything.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        EsGod watched as the two of them disappeared, and a faint smile appeared
        on his face.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The three Universal Civilizations intensely prepared for battle. Ten
        days passed in the blink of an eye, and the World Tree Vanguard Army
        finally arrived at the border of the Flickering World.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Just as the Military Strategy Department had expected, the World Tree
        invaded from different directions, but they were all within the range of
        the defense circle. Battles broke out in many areas at the same time. In
        all the battlefields, the individual strengths on both sides restrained
        themselves. The Beyond Grade As of the three Universal Civilizations had
        only probed a few times, but the World Tree Civilization had never sent
        any Beyond Grade As to fight.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Having learned from the Heart Tree King's case, the World Tree was
        extremely wary of Black Star and did not use any Beyond Grade As for the
        first wave of attacks.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In this first battle that occurred after a gap of ten years, the three
        Universal Civilizations, which had been preparing for a long time,
        successfully gave the World Tree Army a head-on blow. They did not allow
        the World Tree to step into their territory, and both sides were in a
        stalemate at the Flickering World border.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, even after winning once, the three Universal Civilizations did
        not feel any joy, because this was only the first wave of probing
        attacks. The World Tree did not use much of its strength, and the
        situation was still dire.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Just as Han Xiao had said, the World Tree was prepared for a battle of
        attrition. The first thing it did was to build a large number of
        bridgeheads outside the Flickering World border.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Because of the World Tree's continuous advancement, the jump points were
        all under their control. The three Universal Civilizations were
        currently unable to replicate the spatial anchoring orbits which were
        used during the interception war, and they could not chase away the
        enemy. They could only defend their territory and endure the waves of
        attacks from the World Tree. Going forward, this would be the situation
        of the war, and it was also a situation that the three Universal
        Civilizations had long been prepared for.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-1403">
      <h1 class="h" itemprop="headline">
        Chapter 1404: Confrontation<span hidden="" class="calibre1"> | </span>
      </h1>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The intense battle between the World Tree Army and the Galactic Alliance
        Army lasted for two months, but the World Tree was still unable to break
        into the Flickering World territory. Although they had broken through
        the Galactic Alliance Army's defenses several times, the defense circle
        that the three Universal Civilizations had used more than ten years to
        build, was far more complete than the temporary intercepting circle. The
        support network was extremely dense, like an extremely dense elastic
        net.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The deeper they sank, the stronger the rebound would be, and they would
        not be able to stand on their own. All the World Tree troops that had
        attacked the Flickering World were either beaten back or wiped out.
        Their best record did not even reach three days, not even passing
        through the Star System at the border.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The border battle reports of the Flickering World were constantly sent
        back to the Central Galaxy, spreading throughout the galactic society.
        Countless galactic residents had been in fear for more than ten years,
        and now that the enemies had truly invaded their territory, many of them
        were even more afraid. However, because the Galactic Alliance Army had
        always kept the enemies out of their territory, their outstanding
        performance gave some confidence to the galactic residents.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Siebert Fortress. Many Beyond Grade As were on standby here for two
        months.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Heh, didn't the World Tree like to use its individual strength against
        us? Why are they so cowardly now? They are getting rusty."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In the lounge, Sun Hunter stepped on the table and said with disdain.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Probably because they're afraid of Black Star. He captured a tree king
        ten years ago, so it must have hurt them," Kant smiled.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In the past two months, no matter how they provoked or enticed them, the
        World Tree did not send out their individual strengths to fight, calmly
        watching the Beyond Grade As of the three Universal Civilizations create
        trouble on the battlefield.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Beyond Grade As were a little helpless. No matter how strong their
        fighting spirit was, there was nothing they could do if the others did
        not respond. They had even used their physical bodies to tempt the World
        Tree expert, but the World Tree experts still refused to come out.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "You're thinking too much. The World Tree isn't that afraid of me. They
        should be observing the number of individual strengths we have. They
        won't give up on their Exchange tactic so easily. They're probably going
        to attack soon."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao played with Ames' hair and replied casually
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He had been on standby with the others, waiting to catch a big fish.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In the past few days, the three Universal Civilizations had hidden the
        true size of their individual strength. Most of the new Beyond Grade As
        did not come out. Hila, Feidin, Evans, and the other powerful Beyond
        Grade As with special abilities or huge progress did not participate. At
        the same time, the Beyond Grade As who had ‘died' during the last battle
        did not appear, allowing them to remain ‘dead' in the eyes of the World
        Tree.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In the Holy Accord organization that was not yet revealed to others,
        there were still dozens of Revivors who were prepared to participate in
        the battle. The individual strengths displayed in front of the World
        Tree were just the tip of the iceberg. It was to make the World Tree
        think that the Exchange tactic was effective and fall into the trap.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After more than ten years of searching, Oathkeeper had accumulated quite
        a few Sanctum keys, but Han Xiao had never used them. He kept them as a
        strategic reserve.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Buzz</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        While everyone was chatting, the alarm suddenly sounded. The World Tree
        launched another attack on the outermost defense circle.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Everyone paused. Before they could move, a remote projection of an
        officer suddenly appeared in the room.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Everyone, the Beyond Grade As of the World Tree have finally appeared.
        Please arrive at the battlefield as soon as possible."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Hearing this, Han Xiao's eyes sparkled. "It's finally here… Is there any
        sign of the Tree King this time?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Yes!"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Who?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Two. They are the Subduing Tree King and the Lord's Avatar of the
        Fortitude Tree King."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kasuyi could not help but laugh and interrupted, "With the lesson from
        last time, the World Tree would not dare to let the Tree King go out
        alone. However, the arrangement this time is similar to the last. I'm
        afraid they feel that as long as they are careful, they will not fall
        for the same trick as the Heart Tree King."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">This time, a new Beyond Grade A asked curiously,</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "The Tree King has already appeared. Does Your Excellency Black Star
        want to fight?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "It's only Subduing Tree King… Forget it, I'll leave it to you guys."
        Han Xiao stroked his chin, pondered, and clicked his tongue.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He hoped to catch a big fish. At the very least, it should be Fortitude
        Tree King. It would be best if it was the Ancestral Tree King. It did
        not seem worth it to expose his strength for a mere Subduing Tree King…
        He just disliked the Subduing Tree King, a Pugilist, because his
        abilities were too simple and he was not as important as the other Tree
        Kings.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Furthermore, there were plenty of Beyond Grade As in the Beyond Grade A
        Association, so there was no need for him to do anything. As long as
        they killed Subduing Tree King, he would not be able to revive in the
        short term. That should lure out the Ancestral Tree King and the Secret
        Tree King. They would be the better prey in Han Xiao's eyes.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Hila's eyes lit up, as though she was afraid that someone would snatch
        her opponent. "Leave this guy to me!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao raised his brows and dampened her enthusiasm mercilessly,
        "Although your improvement is not small, you are still far from killing
        a Tree King."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "You won't know till you try it." Hila's eyes flashed coldly.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Alright, as long as you don't let him escape." Han Xiao curled his
        lips.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Originally, Wuornos was the most stable in dealing with the Tree King,
        but this guy had not left the Temple of Ten Thousand Gods for more than
        ten years, and he still had no intention of joining the battle. However,
        now that there was the eldest brother in the Underworld, they did not
        lack powerful experts.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao noticed that Evans' hands were trembling slightly, and he could
        not help but feel strange. "Are you afraid?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "This is my first time on the battlefield, and it's such a galactic war.
        I'm indeed a little afraid," Evans said calmly.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Lagi mumbled, "What's the use of being afraid? Could it be that I won't
        die in battle if I am afraid? I didn't expect to die so soon after
        becoming a Beyond Grade A for just a few years. Sigh, someone like me
        really doesn't have the right to enjoy life…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Shut up."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Han Xiao interrupted him.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        If not for the fact that you have some combat power, I would have locked
        you in Amber today!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">At this moment, on the border.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The enormous World Tree fleet was attacking the defensive perimeter, and
        the fleet of the Galactic Alliance Army cooperated with the various
        strongholds to counterattack. Countless terrifying rays of light
        shuttled back and forth in the vast battlefield of the universe, forming
        a bright but fatal rain of light that shot into each other's formation,
        turning the spaceships into fireworks in space.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This was not the first time the two sides had fought, and the battle
        situation quickly heated up. The troops moved under the command of
        various military artificial intelligences. From a macro perspective, it
        looked like they were only shooting at each other on a large scale, but
        in fact, both sides were adjusting their tactics and carrying out minor
        operations.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        On the battlefield, a group of Beyond Grade As of the World Tree were
        observing from afar under the protection of their starships.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Subduing Tree King placed his hands behind his back and scanned the
        formation of the Galactic Alliance Army with his sharp eyes.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Not long after, the Beyond Grade As of the three Universal Civilizations
        also arrived on the battlefield one after another. The two sides faced
        each other from afar. Because only a portion of them had appeared, their
        numbers did not seem as large as the World Tree's.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This batch of Beyond Grade As that had appeared was mainly those who had
        participated in the interception battle. The others were hiding in the
        dark and watching.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Seeing this, the Subduing Tree King narrowed his eyes and nodded.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Humph, many of their experts died last time. They're not our match this
        time."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In the past two months, he had been observing the situation of the three
        Universal Civilizations' Beyond Grade As. Most of them were old enemies.
        Although there were a few new faces, their numbers were limited. They
        were probably new Beyond Grade As.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He did not find this strange. The World Tree also had been nurturing
        Supers for more than ten years, and it had also given birth to some new
        Holy Tree Emissaries and ancestral spirits. The size of their individual
        strength had also increased.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        A portion of the enemy's individual strength had died in the battle more
        than ten years ago, and the dead of their World Tree had all been
        resurrected. The battle strength of both sides fluctuated, and the
        Subduing Tree King was
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, the Heart Tree King had already fallen. As a Pugilist, it was
        very difficult for him to instantly kill the enemy's healer. He had
        tried it the last time, and he had fallen into Black Star's trap. Thus,
        he did not plan to repeat the same mistake. The gathering of the World
        Tree's powerhouses this time was just a test, and they did not have any
        intention of carrying out the Exchange tactic immediately.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Sweeping his gaze across the enemies, the Subduing Tree King suddenly
        realized that there was no trace of Black Star.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "That guy actually didn't come out? No, he must have hidden himself to
        ambush us."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">The Subduing Tree King became alert.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The only person he was worried about was Black Star. The Heart Tree King
        had been sealed, and he did not want to follow in his footsteps. He was
        secretly on guard, afraid that Han Xiao would jump out and stab him.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As the saying goes, when enemies meet, their eyes will burn with hatred.
        The Beyond Grade As on both sides rushed toward each other without
        saying anything and immediately started fighting on the battlefield,
        forming a large area of chaos.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Tree King activated his liberation mode, and his body glowed with
        green light. He had originally wanted to force Black Star out, but he
        did not expect to be stopped by a red-haired woman.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Your opponent is me."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Hila stood in front of the Subduing Tree King with a cold expression,
        her eyes filled with killing intent.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Subduing Tree King's eyes flickered. He had an impression of Hila.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "It's you? Hmm, your self-healing ability is not bad, but you think you
        can stop me with your strength?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Other than Black Star, the Subduing Tree King was not afraid of anyone.
        Thinking of Hila's performance on the battlefield more than ten years
        ago, he did not even put her in his eyes. Hila did not have the habit of
        shooting her mouth off. Hearing this, she let out a cold snort, and a
        powerful aura burst out from her.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Subduing Tree King suddenly felt threatened, and his expression
        changed. He looked at Hila with shock.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">‘She has become so strong?'</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Without a doubt, this red-haired woman had already stepped into the peak
        Beyond Grade A level, and her energy fluctuations were at the upper
        level of the peak Beyond Grade As. It had only been ten years since they
        last met, but she had already improved so much!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Subduing Tree King's expression turned grave. Although there was
        still a gap between the two of them, he had to admit that this woman in
        front of him was qualified to fight him.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He sensed the battle situation of his comrades and realized that the
        enemy Beyond Grade As were far stronger than the World Tree's Beyond
        Grade As. Although they had lost in terms of numbers, they were not at a
        disadvantage. "How did they train ?" The Subduing Tree King was shocked.
        In just ten short years, they had made such an obvious improvement. How
        could Beyond Grade As increase their combat strength so easily? Could it
        be that the enemy's territory was filled with geniuses ?
      </p>

    <div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-1404">
      <h1 class="h" itemprop="headline">
        Chapter 1405: Hila's New Form<span hidden="" class="calibre1"> | </span>
      </h1>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Without waiting for the Subduing Tree King to make a move, Hila had
        already attacked. A red light flashed in her eyes, and the death energy
        that had formed into an ocean shot out. It contained an aura of
        destruction, sealing all of the Tree King's dodging angles. Suppressing
        the shock in his heart, the Subduing Tree King flashed with green light,
        and his powerful Pugilist flames burst out like a supernova. A thick
        green light wave burst out and the approaching death energy froze in
        midair and shattered one after another. However, more death energy
        surged down and filled up the gap almost instantly.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After being strengthened by the power of the undead, the corrosion was
        many times stronger. Although the Subduing Tree King's protective flames
        blocked the death energy, there was still a portion of the death energy
        that stuck on it, constantly wearing down the thickness of the pugilist
        flames. The pugilist flames quickly lost their vitality, turning into
        stars before disappearing into the universe.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "This ability has the attacking properties of impact, erosion, decrease
        in activity, spirit, and so on. Furthermore, it seems to have some sort
        of superimposed killing technique. If my body is hit, it won't be good…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        With a thought in his mind, the Subduing Tree King channeled more energy
        into his protective shield. He also used his authority as a Tree King to
        summon the World Tree Root. It spun rapidly like a tornado, shattering
        the incoming death energy.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Without stopping, he bent his knees and stomped hard. A shockwave
        exploded behind him, and he shot out like a cannonball, turning him into
        a stream of light as he charged straight towards Hila.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Come!"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Hila's eyes turned fierce, and a wave of red-black energy suddenly
        surged out from her body before quickly rolling back, covering her body,
        layer by layer. In an instant, it became solid and the death energy
        seemed to have solidified, turning her into a five to six-meter-tall
        red-black giant. At the same time, dense and complicated silver-gray
        lines covered the little giant's body, looking rather mysterious.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The outline of the giant's body was exactly the same as Hila's, but
        there were no facial features on its face, only a pair of eyes burning
        with white light.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The next moment, the green meteor slammed into the abdomen of the little
        giant and flew out with her. Like a red and green ray, it penetrated
        dozens of starships, leaving a path filled with fireworks.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Dong dong dong</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Green fist shadows descended from the sky and landed on the giant like a
        storm. However, her red and black body was extremely tough, and there
        were no signs of it being shattered.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Suddenly, the multitude of fist shadows disappeared. Everyone saw that
        the giant had caught the Subduing Tree King's fist with both of its
        hands.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Bang!</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The powerful force created a flowing ripple on the surface of the
        giant's body, spreading from his palm to his back, and then out from his
        body. A green energy shockwave spread out in the universe behind it,
        shattering hundreds of battleships.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "A Pugilist is invincible in close combat? I don't believe it!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        With a strong will to fight, the red and black giant suddenly smashed
        its head on the top of the Subduing Tree King's head, shaking the two of
        them. With a loud clank, the iron-headed baby received a ‘friendly
        greeting'.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Immediately after, the giant let go of the Tree King and clenched his
        fist. In the blink of an eye, countless red flashes appeared, and
        hundreds of fist imprints burning with red flames appeared on the Tree
        King's protective shield. A huge force burst out and instantly sent him
        flying.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In this form, Hila had actually managed to defeat the Subduing Tree King
        in close combat! "….. Interesting."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Subduing Tree King that was sent flying immediately stopped and
        rubbed his head. The rest of his body was unharmed, and he was surprised
        by Hila's close combat skills.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After the previous fight, he realized that this giant's physique was
        extremely tough and strong. If not for the lack of Pugilist flames, he
        would have thought that he was fighting a peak Beyond Grade A Pugilist.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Again!"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Hila waved her hands, full of fighting spirit. Although her ability was
        good at attacking from mid to long distances, she still preferred
        engaging in fierce close combat.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After so many years of persistence in challenging Black Star, being
        pressed down on the ground time and time again, Hila had already gotten
        the thrill of being tortured. Not only did she like to get beaten up,
        but she also liked to beat others up just like Black Star did. In the
        past ten years, Aurora had suffered quite a few punches from her.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Because the Power Of The Dead contained the ability inheritance of her
        previous owner, Nerkese, Hila did not need to focus on developing her
        abilities to understand the usage of many Esper Abilities. After
        stepping into the peak Beyond Grade A realm, she had unlocked many new
        abilities, and transforming into a red and black giant was one of them.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Hila's control of death energy was usually focused on the outside of her
        body. Now that she could condense and compress it in her body, she could
        transform herself into another form, called ‘Reaper Liberation'. This
        was one of the main battle methods of Nerkese.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This skill had many transformation stages, and the further one went, the
        stronger they became. However, each stronger stage required a
        sufficiently high energy level to unlock. The final requirement for
        unlocking the ultimate stage, ‘God of the Dead' required an Energy Rank
        of more than 90,000 Ona. Hila had yet to meet the requirement, and she
        had only unlocked the ‘Departed Soul' stage. It was the miniature red
        and black giant that she had currently transformed into.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After entering the ‘Reaper Liberation' state, her body and the
        Underworld Dimension would fuse to a higher level, and she would be able
        to activate a new talent. The more Hero Spirits there were in the
        Underworld as well as the higher their quality, the more enhancements to
        her strength she would receive. The effect was similar to the [Proof of
        Leadership), which was also one of the reasons for Hila's huge increase
        in combat strength.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At the same time, because the body after transformation was made up of
        highly condensed death energy, the characteristics of the original
        ability still existed. Even if physical attacks were used, they would
        still have the ability to cause Death's Erosion, damaging and corroding
        the soul. Furthermore, just touching her body would cause the life force
        of an outsider to be lost.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The two of them looked at each other in midair, and the next moment,
        both of them moved at the same time. The red and green figures clashed
        once again, and their fists landed on flesh. The aftershock of their
        fists shot out and disrupted the battlefield.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Tsk tsk, so scary."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao stayed in the base, clicking his tongue as he watched the
        battle.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He had experienced this form of Hila before and her close combat ability
        was indeed very strong. Combined with her recovery ability, she was
        extremely tanky, and her combat strength stood firmly in the first tier.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, in his eyes, even with this move, Hila was still far from being
        able to defeat the battle form of the Tree King. Before he advanced,
        even if he could win against the Subduing Tree King alone, he would not
        be able to do anything to him in a short period of time. Hila's strength
        was far weaker than before he advanced, so it was impossible for her to
        defeat the Tree King alone.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, with her disgusting tankiness, she would not be beaten into a
        meat patty even by the Subduing Tree King anytime soon.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao no longer looked at the two of them and looked at the other
        battlefields.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Fortitude Tree King and Herberlon were old enemies, and their eyes
        were filled with hatred. The two Mechanical Deities' huge bodies rolled
        across the battlefield and shattered starships. Other than the two of
        them, there were also quite a few Mechanical Deities on the battlefield.
        Due to the size of their bodies, they were all the most conspicuous
        people within the Beyond Grade A battlefield. As for Milizaus, after
        successfully "losing weight", he had already escaped the fate of being a
        target. At this time, he was chasing after a World Tree Army leader and
        throwing magic spells. His improvement was huge, fully showing the
        benefits of getting to know an ancestor.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The rest, such as Manison, Kasuyi, and the others, found their opponents
        and fought non-stop. Furthermore, golden light would shoot out from the
        battlefield from time to time. That was Aurora healing people with
        precision. Her control was much more skillful than ten years ago, and
        her success rate was higher. It could be seen that the special training
        was quite effective.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After a few rounds of Sanctums' resuscitation, the three Universal
        Civilizations had a lot more experts in the first tier. However, the ten
        executives of the World Tree, the high-level Holy Tree Emissary, the
        thirteen ancestral spirits, and the army commanders were not to be
        trifled with. However, not all of the first-tier experts had entered the
        battlefield. The World Tree did not allow all the experts to participate
        in this probing attack, and the three Universal Civilizations had also
        hidden a batch of Revivors and new Beyond Grade As. Although the three
        Universal Civilizations had a disadvantage in terms of numbers, their
        strength had increased, so they did not suffer any losses and were
        temporarily in a stalemate.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Feidin is going to attack, right?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao looked at Feidin, who was hiding in the fleet, and narrowed his
        eyes. Although the souls of all the enemies were bound to the World
        Tree, causing the Soul Swapper to only be able to destroy them and not
        transfer the souls out, it was still very powerful.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As expected, after watching for a while, Feidin finally took out the
        Soul Swapper and activated this Universal Treasure.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The next moment, the souls of the crew members within the surrounding
        World Tree Spaceships were torn into pieces, and they died on the spot.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Tens of thousands of World Tree battleships faced such a situation, and
        the damage was still spreading further. "Hmm? What's going on?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Subduing Tree King's expression changed, as he sensed this
        abnormality from the Mind Sharing. The strange thing about the Soul
        Swapper was that it did not leave a trace. In the eyes of the Subduing
        Tree King, large batches of the World Tree crew had died without any
        warning. They could not find the source of the attack, but it was
        definitely the enemy's doing.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Although they did not know what special weapons the enemy had used, it
        was not a coincidence that the sudden deaths were gathered in one area.
        The World Tree fleet immediately began to adjust and avoid this area.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Although this was a stupid method, it was indeed effective. The Soul
        Swapper did not have an unlimited range. Although it could cover the
        entire planet, under the scale of the galactic battlefield, this range
        was relatively small. Of course, Feidin was not a fixed cannon. As long
        as he swam around the battlefield, he would be able to kill more
        enemies.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Subduing Tree King naturally did not know about this. After
        observing the sudden death of the soldiers, he then looked at the
        current battle between Beyond Grade As, with a heavy mood.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"It's about time to retreat."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Although Black Star, who was the most difficult to deal with, had yet to
        appear, the Tree King had already decided to retreat.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He had thought that this probing attack would allow him to gain the
        upper hand in terms of individual strength and did not expect the
        situation to turn so bad. This civilization that was viewed as prey was
        extremely tenacious. It seemed like even if he managed to land on their
        territory, he would not be able to defeat them easily.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This time, he was not the main attacker. If the situation was good, the
        Subduing Tree King would not mind sacrificing himself. However, the
        current situation was not as he had expected. He felt that there was no
        need to continue fighting.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Tree King's eyes narrowed, and his energy exploded. His fist glowed
        with the green light in the shape of a cross, and with lightning speed,
        it slammed into Hila's abdomen.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Bang!</p>
      <p class="calibre3">A halo of impact appeared!</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The two of them were originally locked in a fierce battle, but this
        heavy punch suddenly broke the stalemate, and Hila was sent flying. At
        the same time, the World Tree Root beside the Subduing Tree King threw
        Hila further away, smashing a row of starships like a meteor.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Subduing Tree King did not chase after her. Instead, he turned
        around and retreated. The other World Tree experts received the order
        and retreated simultaneously, leaving only the Lord's Avatar of the
        Fortitude Tree King and the other Mechanic experts behind.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Although he was now unable to kill Hila, the difference in strength
        between them was not so easy to bridge. If he wanted to leave, Hila
        would not be able to stop him.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Chase!"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kasuyi shouted in the mental network, and the people still on the
        battlefield chased after him.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Hila finally managed to stop herself, and when she looked up, she
        realized that the Subduing Tree King was already far away. She
        immediately chased after him, but the distance between them was
        increasing instead of decreasing
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        She could not help but release her mental waves to shout:
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Don't run! Keep fighting!"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Subduing Tree King turned a deaf ear to her words and ignored her
        completely. He shuttled back and forth between the battles among the two
        fleets, getting closer and closer to his own formation, leaving her with
        only his back view.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At this moment, Dillon, who had already materialized, suddenly appeared
        on the battlefield. He looked at the figure of the Tree King from afar
        and sneered.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Are you kidding me? How can you call yourself a King like this? You're
        just a piece of trash that ran away. You don't even deserve to be the
        most useless Pugilist."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">As soon as he finished speaking…</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Subduing Tree King momentum suddenly decreased, and a look of shock
        appeared on his face.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        What's going on… It's just a simple taunt. With my personality, I
        actually stopped for no reason and wanted to beat this guy up?! Could
        this be some kind of mental control similar to that of the Voice
        Spirits?!

      </h1>
      <p class="calibre3">"What are you doing?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Fortitude Tree King, who was wrestling with Herberlon at the back,
        immediately noticed the abnormality of the Subduing Tree King and was
        shocked.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">What the hell? Are you seriously stopping ?</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Originally, many of the World Tree powerhouses had retreated at the same
        time and formed a battlefront to support each other, effectively
        blocking the pursuit of the enemy group. However, the moment the
        Subduing Tree King stopped, he was instantly at the back and left the
        team, exposing himself to the enemy Beyond Grade As. "I…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Subduing Tree King trembled as though he had just woken up from a
        dream. He suppressed the urge to turn around and took a deep look at
        Dylan before hurriedly following the rest.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, before he could speed up, Dylan raised his brows.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "What are you looking at? What, you want to hit me? Do you have the
        guts?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Subduing Tree King paused, clenched his teeth, and continued to
        accelerate.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Seeing this, Dylan laughed and said with a judgmental tone, "That's
        right. Keep running. A Pugilist who doesn't even have this bit of
        courage doesn't have the right to even look at me."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Subduing Tree King subconsciously stopped once again. He was shocked
        and furious… Usually, he would not be affected by such verbal conflict,
        but for some reason, when these words came out of this person's mouth,
        he could not control his emotions.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Anger surged through his brain, and the Subduing Tree King suppressed
        it. Just as he was about to take another step forward, Dylan's sarcastic
        voice sounded again.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "You really stopped? You can't even stand two sentences? Ha, you don't
        even have this little patience. You're indeed a Pugilist. Other than
        ‘stupid', there's no other word suitable for you."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        It was as if an invisible hand had grabbed onto his body, and the
        Subduing Tree King froze. He wanted to continue retreating, but he could
        not move his legs no matter how hard he tried. A demonic murmur echoed
        in his heart.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Kill him… kill him… kill him…"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Subduing Tree King's expression changed drastically. His expression
        was twisted, as though he was fighting with himself.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        All of a sudden, the Fortitude Tree King's roar sounded in his mind.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Are you f*cking leaving or not ?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Fortitude Tree King could not take it anymore. He did not know what
        had gotten into the Subduing Tree King, but he was running
        intermittently. It was as if he was suffering from kidney damage, and he
        was getting left behind.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "There's something strange about that guy. His words can anger me…" The
        Subduing Tree King's tone was gloomy. "Can't you block his mental
        transmission ?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">The Fortitude Tree King roared in rage.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He even had to remind him of such a simple matter. He was indeed a
        pugilist!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Subduing Tree King was stunned for a moment before coming to a
        realization.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        That's right, I can still block him. Why didn't I react just now? I must
        have lost my mind because of the anger!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He convinced himself. He was not willing to admit that although he was
        angered to the point of wanting to beat someone up, there seemed to be a
        magic in Dylan's words that made him want to listen to the scoldings
        more…
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He quickly solidified the mental barrier and blocked the outside mental
        fluctuations. At this moment, the Subduing Tree King finally felt that
        the world was peaceful.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He suppressed the inexplicable reluctance in his heart and continued to
        run.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Go back and support the Subduing Tree King!"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Fortitude Tree King took over the command. He suppressed his anger
        and ordered the World Tree powerhouses to turn around and receive the
        Subduing Tree King.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The battlefield was ever-changing. Although the Subduing Tree King had
        only been delayed for a short while, he had distanced himself from the
        retreating troops and was completely alone.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Originally, the many World Tree experts had already run far away, and
        they were able to shake off the Beyond Grade A pursuers of the three
        Universal Civilizations with a small number of casualties. However,
        because the Subduing Tree King was being held back by taunts, they had
        no choice but to turn back and reinforce him. They fell back into the
        swamp, and their retreat formation was completely messed up.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Fortitude Tree King had no choice. If he did not send these World
        Tree experts to support, the lone Subduing Tree King would most likely
        die on the spot.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Black Star had yet to make a move and could launch a sneak attack at any
        time. He was afraid that the Subduing Tree King would share the same
        fate and be sealed like the Heart Tree King, causing another Tree King
        Crown to disappear. In addition, the Fortitude Tree King did not want
        the tool, the Subduing Tree King, to die in battle and go into
        hibernation. That would mean that he would have to take charge of the
        overall situation, how would he be able to idle away then? He would
        rather let the other World Tree experts die to save the Subduing Tree
        King
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The World Tree's retreat was interrupted, and the Beyond Grade As of
        both sides fought again.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        On the other side, Sun Hunter flew past Dylan and laughed.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Nicely done. Your mind game is quite good. You've pinned him down!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"What mind game? I just want to scold him."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Dylan had a look of disdain on his face, and his gaze toward the
        Subduing Tree King held some anger.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Hearing this, the Beyond Grade As flying around looked at him strangely.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Scolding the enemy is nothing. If it was a private chat, it would have
        been fine. However, you are scolding openly, and we can clearly hear you
        attacking all Pugilists. If you were not playing a mind game, then
        doesn't your scolding involve our Pugilists as well?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At this moment, Sierron flew past them and said with a displeased
        expression, "Don't involve us Pugilists even if you want to insult the
        enemy."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Dylan glanced at him and said matter-of-factly, "You're also trash."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"…Don't stop me, I'm going to kill him now!"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Sierron was furious.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Mission is more important. Ignore him." Sun Hunter quickly grabbed
        Sierron's finger and dragged him away without much effort.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The current Dylan had already completely adapted to the identity of the
        Underworld Hero Spirit, and he no longer had any scruples when speaking.
        The Beyond Grade As were no longer willing to lower themselves to his
        level. After all, what was the point in bickering with a dead person?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        On the battlefield, the Subduing Tree King retreated as he fought. His
        attacks were filled with rage, and the power of his attacks increased.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Hila caught up once again. The red and black giant's fists continued to
        punch, and its arms pulled back and forth like rubber. However, the
        current Subduing Tree King did not have any interest in being in a
        stalemate with her. Every move he made exploded with all his strength,
        and they all landed on Hila's body.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After a few rounds, Hila was beaten up badly and she was at a
        disadvantage.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Although she was also good at close combat in this form, there was still
        a gap between her and the Subduing Tree King, who was going all out.
        After all, the Pugilist class still had some meaning…
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Bang! The fist, shining with the green light of the cross, landed deeply
        on the red-black giant's body, and the surging Pugilist flames entered
        the giant's body. The next moment, a green light suddenly lit up in the
        red-black giant's body. It expanded in the blink of an eye and dyed its
        entire body a dazzling green color. It exploded from the inside out!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Like a balloon exploding, the highly concentrated death energy that
        formed the body directly exploded, turning into red light fragments that
        filled the sky, and Hila's body was exposed.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Before Hila could retreat, the Subduing Tree King grabbed her neck and
        slammed his other hand into Hila's face, sending blood and broken bones
        flying. "Powerful!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        With a flash of golden light, Hila's heavily injured face instantly
        recovered. The pain did not affect her movements at all. She condensed
        her death energy and was about to deal damage to the Subduing Tree King.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, the Subduing Tree King understood her intentions. He raised his
        leg and kicked her heavily on her abdomen, interrupting her movements.
        He kicked her body until it folded and flew backward. Her spine was
        already broken by the huge penetrative force. "Cough cough cough," Hila
        spat out a mouthful of blood, controlled her muscles to adjust the
        position of her spine, connected the broken nerves and blood vessels,
        and absorbed a trace of life energy from her Soul Connection with
        Aurora, allowing her injuries to recover quickly.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The form of ‘Reaper Liberation' was destroyed, and it was still on
        cooldown. Although Hila did not intend to admit defeat, she had no
        choice but to face the reality that she could not defeat the Subduing
        Tree King and analyzed the current situation.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Although I can still continue fighting the Subduing Tree King, I can't
        hold him back. This will allow him to escape…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Hila's eyes were still filled with the desire to fight, but she was
        afraid of ruining Han Xiao's goal, so she could only suppress it.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Does it hurt?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Seeing that she did not continue to charge forward, the Subduing Tree
        King narrowed his eyes and did not pursue her.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Although he was left alone due to his carelessness, causing a large
        group of Beyond Grade As from the three Universal Civilizations to
        surround him, the many World Tree Supers returned in time and broke
        through the encirclement that had yet to take shape, dragging the
        situation back into a chaotic battle. Therefore, the Subduing Tree King
        was still in a good situation and was not surrounded.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Subduing Tree King observed the situation and felt much more
        relaxed. Although Hila was not easy to deal with, she could not stop him
        at all. With his ability, as long as there was no Beyond Grade A like
        Black Star to hold him back, the chances of him escaping were still very
        high. The retreat was stopped because of him, but he was still safe. The
        negative outcome was only sacrificing more of his comrades… Although it
        was a bit of a loss, as long as he, the Tree King, returned, these
        losses could still be accepted. After all, his hibernation would be much
        longer than the average World Tree expert.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "I didn't think that a simple probe would be so dangerous. I can't act
        casually next time."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Subduing Tree King did not chase after Hila but retreated.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, at this moment, a strong sense of danger suddenly appeared, as
        though a large hand had grabbed onto his heart.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Subduing Tree King's expression changed slightly as he looked toward
        the source of the sensation.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        A figure appeared beside Hila out of thin air. He did not look special
        on the outside and looked very ordinary. His expression was calm, but he
        exuded an evil and crazy aura that could not be hidden.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        EsGod tilted his head and looked at the World Tree Roots beside the
        Subduing Tree King. He smiled and sighed.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "How many years has it been? I've finally seen this thing with my own
        eyes… Heh, if I hadn't seen it, I might not have been imprisoned for
        nearly a hundred years."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Subduing Tree King frowned. He felt a strong threat from this
        stranger.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He had already blocked the mental fluctuations of outsiders, so he had
        no idea what EsGod was talking about. He turned around and ran without
        hesitation.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This unfamiliar Beyond Grade A that had suddenly appeared was not a
        simple character, and it would be difficult to determine the victor in a
        short time. If he was dragged here, it would be dangerous. Thus, the
        Subduing Tree King did not want to continue fighting.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, before he could fly far, the smiling EsGod had already
        teleported in front of him.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Subduing Tree King's eyes darkened, and a powerful flame condensed
        in his fist. He aimed at EsGod, planning to use the shockwave to force
        EsGod back.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        A green Pugilist beam shot out with enough power to destroy an entire
        planet. However, EsGod only raised his hand casually and activated his
        Esper Ability, refracting the beam of light which then shattered a large
        number of starships like a laser.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Esper?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Subduing Tree King's eyes flashed, but he did not plan to stop. He
        quickly closed the distance between them and punched out with his fist.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Bang! The fist landed on EsGod's chest without any resistance, but all
        the power disappeared without a trace.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Subduing Tree King's expression changed. Just as he was about to
        retract his fist, EsGod slapped him back. Green light gushed out and
        reflected the power of the Subduing Tree King's previous attack.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Boom!</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        A huge shockwave exploded in an instant, and the Subduing Tree King was
        sent flying.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He immediately stopped moving and looked at EsGod in shock. He removed
        his mental shield and could not help but ask,
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"What ability is this?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Guess."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">EsGod smiled.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Even with the support of his Esper Ability, he would still be injured if
        he took such a blow head-on. In the past, he would have to worry about
        the burden on his body, so he did not dare to do this. He rarely fought
        head-on. Now, his body was only temporary, and he did not have to care
        about any consequences at all.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        EsGod had a rare feeling of having nothing to worry about. He hooked his
        finger at the Tree King
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Come, let me see the ability of a Tree King."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "…Your ability is not bad. You can absorb my power and reflect it back,
        but you don't have the right to show off in front of me."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Subduing Tree King quickly calmed down and looked at EsGod coldly.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In this short exchange, he had already realized how difficult EsGod was
        to deal with. He thought that EsGod's Esper Ability was to reflect
        attacks and that he was good at defense. He must be stalling him, he
        thought.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">However, EsGod smiled.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Is that so?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Buzz!</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The next moment, sixty to seventy doppelgangers separated from EsGod's
        main body. Each doppelganger had a different ability, and they all
        released the aura of a Beyond Grade A, instantly attracting the
        attention of everyone present. "This is…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Alarm bells rang in the Subduing Tree King's heart, and his expression
        changed drastically.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He had originally thought that this unknown expert would only be
        difficult to deal with and would only be able to stall him at most. The
        true danger came from the siege of the other Beyond Grade As… but at
        this moment, the sense of danger EsGod gave him was almost similar to
        Black Star's.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "So this civilization actually has such strong experts hidden…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Subduing Tree King's heart was heavy as he waited. Facing such an
        opponent, he did not dare to think about escaping.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The next second, EsGod and all his doppelgangers attacked at the same
        time. Various Esper Abilities formed a perfect combination.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In a direct confrontation, EsGod might not be the strongest among the
        Beyond Grade As, but due to his unparalleled abilities, he could be
        considered the peak among Beyond Grade As in techniques!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Crap!"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        An endless sense of oppression assaulted him, and the Subduing Tree King
        suddenly opened his eyes wide. He realized that he could not find any
        flaws, and he could not help but be shocked.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This powerful enemy in front of me has strength that exceeds my
        expectations. It seems like he has the strength to kill me alone
      </p>

        Chapter 1407: Subduing Tree King: This Is All a Conspiracy, You Can't
        Fool Me!<span hidden="" class="calibre1"> | </span>
      </h1>
      <p class="calibre3">A battle between the two erupted.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Dozens of doppelgangers with different Esper Abilities worked together
        seamlessly. As soon as they clashed, EsGod suppressed the Subduing Tree
        King. The combination of various Esper Abilities and combo attacks was
        dazzling, and the Subduing Tree King could not find his bearings.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        When EsGod had just summoned his doppelgangers, the attention of all the
        Beyond Grade As on both sides had been drawn over. Seeing how miserable
        the Subduing Tree King was, everyone could not help but have strange
        looks on their faces.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "What a strong Esper. With so many Beyond Grade A doppelgangers
        assisting him in battle, although the Subduing Tree King king has the
        advantage in terms of frontal explosive power, all his actions are
        disrupted by the large number of doppelgangers. He isn't able to fight
        back at all and is completely passive…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        While wrestling with Herberlon, the Fortitude Tree King observed the
        battle situation on the Subduing Tree King's side. The more he watched,
        the more fearful he became.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Subduing Tree King was being held back by a large number of EsGod
        doppelgangers and could not take control of the situation. He was like a
        weak teenager who was forced into an alley by a group of strong men. He
        was getting further and further away from the main force.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This powerful enemy did not have the overwhelming strength as Black Star
        did, but the Fortitude Tree King felt that he was equally difficult to
        deal with. If a Super with only one ability faced such an opponent, and
        the strength of the two parties did not have an insurmountable gap, then
        the Super would be at a natural disadvantage. A Pugilist who only knew
        how to hammer people was an example.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">‘Luckily, I'm a Mechanic…'</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This thought appeared in the mind of the Fortitude Tree King.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        On the other side, the Beyond Grade As of the three Universal
        Civilizations looked at EsGod with shock.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "EsGod is truly terrifying without any restraints. His true combat
        capability is so strong…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Many people were shocked.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Most people knew EsGod's name, and many had fought him personally.
        However, EsGod's current combat strength was much stronger than they had
        imagined. He had never been this strong before. "Looks like the
        Underworld suits him very well."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Manison's eyes flickered, and his tone was complicated.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        EsGod had been imprisoned for close to a hundred years and wasted so
        many years. However, he was like a fish in water the moment he entered
        the Underworld. His stubbornness was gone, and his combat strength
        increased tremendously. While Manison had been training hard for so many
        years, due to Black Star's persistent attacks, his combat strength had
        actually regressed and was not as good as when he was at his peak. As
        one fell and another rose, he realized that he did not have the
        confidence to deal with the current EsGod.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">This comparison made Manison feel sad for himself.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Seeing the battle between the two of them, everyone quickly took action
        after being shocked. The World Tree experts tried to provide support,
        and the morale of the three Universal Civilizations was greatly boosted.
        They became even more obstructive and did not allow the enemy to leave
        the team battle to help.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        For the time being, the two of them could not be bothered with the
        actions of their teammates and focused on the battle.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The green meteor crashed through the battlefield, but it was like a bug
        that had fallen into a spider's web. All of its attacks were neutralized
        by EsGod's doppelgangers using all kinds of strange defensive Esper
        Abilities. The Subduing Tree King could not break out of EsGod's
        encirclement at all and could only be dragged along
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Subduing Tree King launched another series of close-range attacks,
        but the fists glowing with green light easily passed through EsGod's
        body and did not hit anything.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Before he could do anything else, an EsGod doppelganger suddenly
        appeared from the side and floated over like smoke, turning into a curse
        and attaching itself to his body. His body suddenly became sore, and he
        could not even use half of his strength.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Before the Subduing Tree King could get rid of the negative status, the
        EsGod doppelgangers around him released different types of energy
        attacks.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Some shot out high-energy lasers from their eyes, some shot out ‘X'
        shaped silver beams from their hands, some spun electromagnetic field
        lightning chains, and some pushed out dark red energy waves from their
        hands.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Bang! Bang! Bang! Multicolored energy bombarded the Subduing Tree King's
        body. The light in the field expanded and exploded, causing the Subduing
        Tree King to tumble and fly backward.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Before he could fly far, the Subduing Tree King felt something tighten
        around his waist. It turned out that an EsGod's doppelganger was already
        waiting for him on the way and had grabbed him by the waist.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        His reaction was fast, and he used a powerful elbow strike to hit the
        EsGod doppelganger's head. However, he did not manage to push the EsGod
        doppelganger back. The EsGod doppelganger's head suddenly became blurry,
        as if there was a high-frequency vibration, and all the kinetic energy
        was absorbed.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The next moment, this EsGod doppelganger pushed his hip, and the kinetic
        energy rebounded, not missing anything and rushing into the Subduing
        Tree King's body. "Get lost!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Tree King's expression was twisted, his aura erupted and broke free
        from the control. He threw this EsGod doppelganger away.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, before he could take any further action, more than ten mental
        attacks from different Esper Abilities suddenly exploded in his brain.
        Blood immediately spurted out from the Subduing Tree King's mouth and
        nose, and his soul was injured. A large number of mental debuffs
        appeared, making him dizzy.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He endured the pain and was just about to use the World Tree Roots to
        help him out when he realized that the World Tree Roots were already
        pinned down by another group of EsGod doppelgangers using space, force
        field, and other Esper Abilities. "How many Esper Abilities do you have
        p" The Subduing Tree King was completely shocked.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After fighting for such a long time, this opponent had already used more
        than a hundred Esper Abilities. Attack, defense, control, evasion… All
        sorts of abilities were present, like a bottomless abyss. There was
        simply no limit!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Since the start of the battle, EsGod had never used any big moves to
        inflict heavy injuries on him. However, this method was like eating away
        at his life, continuously inflicting light injuries on him time and time
        again. It was extremely disgusting.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"I never counted."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">EsGod's tone was calm as he continued to attack.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        His Esper Abilities were endless and could be said to be omnipotent. He
        completely controlled the tempo of the battle and did not give the
        Subduing Tree King any time to catch his breath. The lethality was
        secondary, but the strongest aspect was the almost perfect chain of
        control, almost playing the Subduing Tree King in his palms.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        While enduring the concentrated attacks, the Subduing Tree King observed
        the situation with difficulty. Seeing that the main force was getting
        further and further away, his heart could not help but turn cold.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "My teammates are being held back, and it will be very difficult for
        them to rush over to support me. If I continue to fight him like this,
        my condition will continue to deteriorate, and the chances of me being
        able to escape will become increasingly slim…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Subduing Tree King's expression changed, and he suddenly had a flash
        of insight.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        That's right, Black Star has yet to appear. How can he not participate
        in the battle? He must be secretly waiting for me!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        ‘The Heart Tree King was tricked. Black Star knows that the other tree
        kings will be more vigilant, so he is hiding for the time being and
        pretending not to participate in the battle. He wants to make me lower
        my guard. When this Esper depletes my strength to a certain extent, he
        will suddenly attack and seal me as well!'
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At this moment, the Subduing Tree King felt his mind clearing up.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        That must be it. This is a trap! "That was close. If I am not decisive
        enough, I will fall for his trick… I can't fall for his trick!'
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He believed that he had seen through Black Star's plan and made up his
        mind.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        EsGod did not know anything about the Subduing Tree King's mental state.
        Just as he was about to order his doppelgangers to launch another wave
        of attacks, a frightening energy was suddenly released from the Subduing
        Tree King's body.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Hmm? This feeling is…"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        EsGod's eyes narrowed, and he retreated without hesitation.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Subduing Tree King had a fierce expression on his face, and his body
        suddenly emitted a bright light.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "I'd rather self-destruct than let you guys succeed!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Bang!</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        His entire body exploded, and an intense energy shockwave spread out.
        The EsGod doppelgangers around were all sent flying, and the World Tree
        Roots turned into light fragments and disappeared.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Subduing Tree King had always thought of himself as a rational
        Pugilist. His choice now was based on his own interests. He was being
        held back by EsGod, and Black Star was watching him from the dark. His
        chances of escaping were slim, so he decided to self-destruct before his
        condition fell to a dangerous state.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        On one hand, it would cause the enemy's sneak attack to fail, and on the
        other hand, his teammates did not have to come to support, thus
        minimizing losses.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Two birds with one stone!</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Just one word, amazing!</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Swoosh!</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        EsGod's figure flashed, avoiding the shockwave of the self-destruction.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He had finally met an opponent he wanted to fight to his heart's
        content, but he did not expect his opponent to explode just like that.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In his opinion, although the Subduing Tree King was at a disadvantage,
        he was still a Tree King level combatant. Even if he had the advantage,
        it would be extremely difficult to kill the other party. The current
        situation was far from the time to self-destruct… "Forget it, at least
        the target is settled."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">EsGod suddenly shook his head and laughed.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The situation of the battle was ever-changing. If the Subduing Tree King
        fought to the end, he might still have a chance to escape. However,
        since he decided to self-destruct now, there was no need to worry about
        any accidents.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Black Star's order was to kill this guy. Now that his opponent had
        killed himself, he would be saving his energy.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        On the other side, the Fortitude Tree King sensed the self-destruction
        of the Subduing Tree King and was shocked.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He felt that although the situation was not good, there was still a
        chance. Why did he give up the hope of survival? He could still be
        saved…
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Fortitude Tree King immediately received the Subduing Tree King's
        mental fluctuations and understood what had happened.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "So, he did this because he was worried about being ambushed by the
        enemy…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">The Fortitude Tree King was speechless.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Due to the revival mechanism, this method of self-destructing to prevent
        the enemy from capturing them was very common for the World Tree
        members. The last time, the Subduing Tree King had died by
        self-destructing, but it was surprisingly similar this time as well…
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Fortitude Tree King did not know if he should say that the Subduing
        Tree King was decisive or a stupid teammate for falling in the same
        place twice.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        With just one probing, they had lost a Tree King. He felt exhausted.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Sigh, I can't say that it's a bad thing. He did die a little quickly,
        but it guaranteed that he won't be sealed like the Heart Tree King."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Fortitude Tree King sighed in his heart. He could only think on the
        bright side… At least, the Subduing Tree King's sacrifice was not
        completely worthless. He managed to probe out the enemy's cards.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This unknown Esper who was not inferior to Black Star and that
        large-scale instant killing device that did not leave any traces must be
        the enemy's trump cards.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        With this information, his side would be able to prepare in advance the
        next time they fought… He had finally gained some benefits from this
        battle. He felt that the Subduing Tree King's death was not a big loss.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        It was a pity that this errand boy was gone. He could not slack off
        anymore. With this in mind, the Fortitude Tree King no longer had any
        thoughts of fighting. He suppressed the annoyance in his heart and
        immediately ordered a retreat.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Let's go!"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The World Tree experts stopped fighting and retreated. After paying a
        price, they finally returned to the main formation and were protected by
        the fleet again.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Beyond Grade As of the three Universal Civilizations did not pursue
        after seeing this and retreated into the defense circle.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Seeing this, the expressions of the leaders of the three Universal
        Civilizations who were watching from afar relaxed, and they were
        secretly surprised.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Even before Black Star made a move, a portion of the Beyond Grade As had
        already given the World Tree experts a head-on blow, causing the enemies
        to suffer. In their eyes, this was undoubtedly the result of Black
        Star's training over the past ten years.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Although Black Star is unpredictable, he is still reliable in this
        field."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "There shouldn't be anyone in the entire Galactic Society who knows how
        to cultivate Supers better than him. Black Star has contributed a lot to
        such a huge improvement. His ten years of hard work has given us an
        advantage in terms of individual strength."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">The three of them were somewhat relieved.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">At the same time.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In the base, Han Xiao raised his brows when he saw the Subduing Tree
        King explode into the most beautiful fireworks.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "He chose to self-destruct at this time… Could it be that he's afraid
        that I'll ambush him? Ha, isn't he being too smart for his own good?
        Among the Pugilists, your stupidity is quite unique."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Han Xiao could not help but laugh.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">та</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He did not plan to make a move, but he did not expect this inaction to
        scare the Subduing Tree King so much that he gave up his life… It could
        only be said that he had left quite a shadow in the World Tree's heart.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This time, without his help, the other teammates had caused the World
        Tree to suffer a loss. Without a doubt, they had improved tremendously,
        and Hila and the others could even hold their own. He was very
        satisfied.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Most importantly, a portion of the Revivors and new Beyond Grade As held
        back their urges until the end of the battle and did not appear to join
        the battle. This meant that the Holy Accord's Revivors were still not
        exposed, which was a good thing for Han Xiao.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The World Tree's attack was obviously just a test, while his side only
        revealed the tip of the iceberg and did not reveal all their cards. They
        killed the Subduing Tree King while holding back some of their trump
        cards. Sending this annoying guy back home to rest was quite worth it!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As such, the World Tree did not receive any more intelligence, and it
        still maintained the incorrect judgment of the Exchange tactic being
        effective.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Han Xiao rubbed his chin and smiled.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "It seems like you guys don't even have the right to enjoy this gift
        that I've prepared… That's good too. I'll give this surprise to you guys
        when you send out a powerful Tree King."
      </p>

      </h1>
      <p class="calibre3">
        While Han Xiao was thinking, the individual forces of both sides had
        already retreated from the battlefield, but the fleets were still
        exchanging fire. The densely packed particle beams crisscrossed,
        shattering the shields and armor of countless battleships. All kinds of
        large war weapons took turns and the border defense circle blocked the
        World Tree vanguard team outside the territory with extreme firepower.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After beating the World Tree experts away, the Beyond Grade As
        temporarily retreated to the Siebert Fortress to rest. They returned to
        the resting room in high spirits and greeted Han Xiao who was watching
        the battle.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Well done, everyone. This is a great victory!"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Han Xiao nodded with approval.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Haha, I used to think that the World Tree experts were difficult to
        deal with, but now I feel they're just so-so." Sun Hunter jumped onto
        the table and laughed like a hero.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Of course, you guys did not waste your time for nothing the past ten
        years. I've seen all your progress." Han Xiao smiled.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Hearing this, everyone could not help but smile. They were in a good
        mood.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        When facing the enemy again, everyone realized that they had relaxed
        quite a bit. The enemy's improvement was limited, but their own
        improvement was huge. This was undoubtedly the result of His Excellency
        Black Star's ten years of special training.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Beyond Grade As deeply experienced the growth brought by the special
        training and their gratitude toward Han Xiao grew deeper. They looked at
        Han Xiao with admiration and respect.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        More than ten years ago, the World Tree had given them a lot of
        psychological pressure, and they felt that the World Tree was extremely
        difficult to deal with after a few exchanges. However, with Black Star
        as their confidence, they no longer had any psychological trauma.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After more than ten years of fermenting, Han Xiao had gained more
        respect. Because there was an intrinsic difference between a
        Transcendent and the Beyond Grade As, he had subtly improved the
        attitudes of many Beyond Grade As toward him. The way the Beyond Grade
        As viewed him now was similar to how Calamity Grades respected and
        supported the Beyond Grade As. The concept of superiors and subordinates
        was more deeply rooted in the hearts of the people and most Beyond Grade
        As had already accepted the changes in their relationship.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "It's all thanks to Aurora that we were able to achieve such a great
        victory," Beyoni said with admiration.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Hearing this, everyone started bootlicking.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        There were no casualties in this victory and it was naturally Aurora's
        contribution that forced the World Tree experts back. Her healing power
        was stronger and more accurate than ten years ago and many Beyond Grade
        As were eager to suck up to her.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"It's alright. I just did my job."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Aurora was used to being humble, expressing her fear of being the MVP.
        At the same time, she secretly glanced at Han Xiao, anticipating his
        praise.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao did not see the look in her eyes. He smiled and said, "Speaking
        of contributions, EsGod's killing this time… cough, forcing the Subduing
        Tree King to die is also a great contribution."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Everyone was stunned and turned to look at the calm EsGod.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Although EsGod had performed a meritorious deed, he had a grudge with
        many of the people present. Now that they were fighting side by side,
        everyone had a complicated impression of him.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        EsGod glanced at Han Xiao. "If the Subduing Tree King was not afraid of
        your ambush, he would not have self-destructed so easily. Tree Kings
        indeed live up to their name. He's not that easy to deal with."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Hmm… although you're humble, when I think about how you played with the
        Subduing Tree King, I feel like you're posturing…
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao thought to himself and waved his hand. "You still contributed."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">EsGod smiled and did not continue.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        What was the use of contributions? He would not be allowed to revive. He
        did not care if he made any contributions. It was just a mission from
        the Underworld.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At this moment, Kasuyi rubbed his chin and said, "It's a pity that the
        Subduing Tree King self-destructed too decisively, causing the enemy to
        retreat in time. We did not cause more casualties to the enemy, and we
        only managed to kill about ten enemy Beyond Grade As. Among them, only
        the Subduing Tree King was a powerful individual."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "This isn't a big problem. It might be a good thing if we look at it
        from another perspective." Han Xiao waved his hand and smiled. "Think
        about it, since the Subduing Tree King died in battle, the ones in
        charge of the overall situation will have to be changed. If we had
        heavily injured their Beyond Grade As in this wave, then even if the
        next Tree King wants to fight, he probably won't have enough force. Now
        that we have left the World Tree with a relatively intact high-level
        strength, the new Tree King will have the chips to fight again in a
        short period." "There's such an explanation?" Kasuyi was surprised.
        "What's so strange about that? My goal is to seal a sufficiently
        powerful Tree King. If they shrink back, how am I going to attack? I
        hoped you guys wouldn't seriously injure the enemy this time. This is
        called baiting the big fish. Killing the Subduing Tree King is enough
        for now."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Han Xiao nodded.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Hearing this, one of the revivors laughed and said, "Haha, it's a good
        thing we didn't join the battle this time, or we would have ruined your
        plan."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Of course, we can't just reveal all our trump cards in just a probing
        battle. We will catch them off guard next time." Han Xiao smiled.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Revivors and some of the new Beyond Grade As originally felt that it
        was a pity that they did not make a move this time, but they were
        relieved now and focused on the big picture.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        They gathered together and analyzed the results of the battle for a
        while before dispersing to do their own things. From time to time, they
        would look up at the live broadcast of the battle. At this moment, they
        had the upper hand, so there was no need for them to attack again. Han
        Xiao chatted with Ames and browsed through the deployment of the
        Galactic Alliance Army. Suddenly, he felt a squeeze beside him. Jotina
        walked over and sat beside him.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao turned around and saw Jotina staring at him with a burning
        gaze, as though she wanted to swallow him alive. "What are you doing
        now?" Han Xiao raised his brows.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "I want to stay by your side." Jotina licked her lips.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Then sit properly. Don't come close."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Han Xiao was helpless.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He knew that Jotina had always been craving for his body and had
        rejected her many times. However, she had never given up and kept
        pestering him.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In the past, Jotina would restrain herself because of the huge gap
        between them, but ever since she became a Beyond Grade A, she became
        more and more unrestrained. Especially when everyone was on standby at
        the frontlines, this woman kept harassing him.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "No, I want to lean on you." Jotina did not hide anything and hugged his
        arm boldly.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao had no choice but to pull his arm out. However, Jotina leaned
        her head on his chest and wrapped her arms around his waist. "Don't you
        think this is the wrong time? Can't you be mindful of your image?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao's mouth twitched. After all, Jotina was a Beyond Grade A who
        was willing to stay in the army, so it was not convenient for him to
        beat her up.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "It's alright, you guys continue." The Beyond Grade As glanced over, not
        surprised at all. They were already used to it.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"…Do you think I'm air?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Ames looked at the two of them and could not take it anymore.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        It would have been fine if Jotina had sat on Han Xiao's other side, but
        this woman had snatched her seat and pushed her to the side. Wasn't this
        a provocation?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "This is your exclusive seat? Can't I sit here?" Jotina looked back at
        her with hostility.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Ames could not be bothered with her. This was not the first time Jotina
        had targeted her, and she was speechless.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        She crossed her arms and looked at Han Xiao. "You look very
        comfortable."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Of course not."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao shook his head and pushed Jotina away. He then sat down on the
        other side of Ames and dragged Lagi to his side.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Seeing this, Jotina snorted and did not move closer. She turned around
        and sat at the side, glaring at him.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Ames patted Han Xiao's chest and said with a smile that was not a smile,
        "You're very popular now. Many people want to snatch you away from me.
        Are you going to have a new lover one day?" Han Xiao stroked his chin
        and pretended to tease. "I think that the reason why people are coveting
        me is because there are gaps in our relationship. If we form a family
        and have offspring, others will know better and give
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">up."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">"…We'll see."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Ames leaned her head on Han Xiao's shoulder and replied softly.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Their relationship had long been made public, and this was not the first
        time Black Star had brought up the topic of having offspring. However,
        if she simply did not want to have children, how troublesome would that
        be? It was just that after more than ten years, Ames' tone had also
        changed from firm rejection to hesitation. The ‘threat' from Jotina made
        her waver more and more.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Han Xiao did not insist.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In the past few years, he had tried to cultivate his descendants with
        his life energy and bioengineering. However, he realized that there were
        many flaws in the life-form created by such gene cultivation. They could
        not inherit the three inherited talents and could not achieve the
        expected effect. Thus, his plan to quickly expand the race could only be
        put on hold.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Since he could not use the Mechanic method, he could only rely on
        fertilization.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Beep beep!</p>
      <p class="calibre3">At this moment, his communicator rang.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao took it out and took a look. It was a message from the person
        in charge of the secondary dimension expedition outpost.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The content was simple, but it made Han Xiao's pupils contract.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Your Excellency Black Star, the Abnormal Creature Egg that you told me
        to pay attention to has shown changes. Please come quickly."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        More than ten years ago, Han Xiao had reached a consensus with the
        Realmless King. He had borrowed part of the territory and transformed it
        into the outpost of the secondary dimension expeditionary army of the
        three Universal Civilizations. They had worked together for a long time.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The so-called Abnormal Creature Egg was the Pivotal Snake Egg. Han Xiao
        had specially instructed the person in charge of the expedition outpost
        to monitor it. It had not changed much in the past ten years and this
        was the first time something had happened.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "I have something to do, so I'll be leaving for a while. Kasuyi will
        temporarily give the orders on my behalf."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao stood up without hesitation and left after changing into the
        King.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        On the other side, World Tree Base, Tree King Palace. Fortitude Tree
        King was seated on the throne, two rays of light appeared on the other
        two empty seats, quickly turning into the figures of the Ancestral Tree
        King and Secret Tree King.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As soon as he regained his physical body, the Secret Tree King said
        impatiently,
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "How are you guys fighting? Why is the Subduing Tree King dead again?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Just a small accident." The Fortitude Tree King had always been at odds
        with him.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Secret Tree King snorted. "Accident? Heh, don't make excuses for
        your incompetence. Look at your results. You participated in the battle
        twice and lost the Heart Tree King and the Subduing Tree King
        respectively. You're simply embarrassing us." "It's different this time.
        The enemy has revealed a new trump card. The reason the Subduing Tree
        King self-destructed so decisively is because of the Heart Tree King's
        case," the Fortitude Tree King retorted.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "As a Tree King, he died so easily. I don't think he deserves the Tree
        King Crown. It would be better if we change to someone else," the Secret
        Tree King mocked.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Alright, stop arguing. There's no problem with the Subduing Tree King's
        choice. At least he was not sealed by the enemy…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At this time, the Ancestral Tree King raised his hand and stopped the
        two of them from arguing Although his tone was calm, he was actually
        feeling depressed. The Subduing Tree King had died too quickly. He had
        practically self-destructed the moment he left the base. If not for the
        fact that replacing a Tree King was more troublesome, he really wanted
        to dismiss the Subduing Tree King.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Hearing this, the Fortitude Tree King did not argue and continued, "The
        Subduing Tree King's sacrifice is worth it. He has probed out a new
        strong enemy for us…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He shared the battle details with the two of them, emphasizing EsGod's
        strength.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Ancestral Tree King narrowed his eyes and said,
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "To think that the enemy still has such a strong opponent… Including
        Herberlon, there are already three people who have the strength of a
        Tree King. There's no lack of people among the other Supers who can
        fight against a Tree King. Their individual strengths are too developed,
        and we might not have the advantage." "It's mainly because the experts
        from the other races are unable to take action. Otherwise, it would be
        much easier." The Fortitude Tree King was helpless.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Black Star's existence had directly crippled a large group of their
        foreign experts, and they did not have all the high-level combatants
        that could enter the battlefield. Otherwise, they would not have been so
        passive.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Ancestral Tree King nodded. "Yes, that's true. Our only advantage
        right now is the endless revivals. However, the opponent's recovery-type
        Esper is not simple. Although the Exchange tactic is effective, it's not
        easy to use it… Comparatively, recovering on the spot is considered
        immediate combat power for them, but we're only using it after the
        battle. It won't help much in a head-on battle, so we're at a
        disadvantage." "Then what should we do?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Hmm, our advantage is that the cost of trial and error is close to
        zero. We can try a few more times like today, so we don't have to care
        too much about the casualties. As long as we can obtain more information
        about the enemy, it will be worth it." The Ancestral Tree King said.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Fortitude Tree King coughed and said, "However, ordinary probing
        won't make the enemy feel pressured. I think it's better for us to
        attack together."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Ancestral Tree King did not doubt him. He thought for a while and
        said, "You're right. Today, two Tree Kings were at a disadvantage. It
        seems like only the three of us together can force out the enemy's
        strength. It would be best if we can kill that Esper." "I think the
        descent of the Tree God is more reliable…" the Fortitude Tree King
        suggested. The Ancestral Tree King frowned slightly and shook his head.
        "The Heart Tree King's Tree King Crown is gone. Even if we use the Tree
        God's Descent, it won't be complete. Furthermore… I don't like that
        feeling." If it was not necessary, he would not be willing to use the
        Tree God's Descent. This was not a comfortable thing.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Fortitude Tree King agreed and changed the topic.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "By the way, the enemy has built a defensive circle at the border, and
        it seems like they destroyed quite a few Star Clusters. What do you plan
        to do?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Ancestral Tree King did not mind and casually said,
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "That's normal. Since they know our advantage, they will naturally make
        such a choice… Think of a way to steal their intel and confirm the
        enemy's territory. It's best to obtain the coordinates of the other Star
        Fields and have our troops jump over to open up a new battlefront,
        avoiding their border defense circle.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Also, they seem to be looking for the main body of the mother tree. I
        don't know where they got this information from, but we need to search
        for their traces in the secondary dimension. Also, find a way to confirm
        the entrance of the enemy civilization into the secondary dimension and
        open up the secondary dimension battlefront."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Now was not the time to stop the war. Since they were near the enemy's
        territory, there were more options to attack. Compared to attacking the
        Flickering World's defense circle, the Ancestral Tree King was more
        inclined to gathering intelligence and opening up more battlefronts to
        amplify the World Tree's advantage.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Understood."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">The Fortitude Tree King nodded vigorously.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He had deliberately emphasized how difficult it was to deal with the
        enemy so that he could pull the other two Kings into the team. This way,
        he would not have to worry alone. Perfect!

      <p class="calibre3">
        While the three tree kings were discussing, they suddenly paused at the
        same time and fell silent. They all sensed a message from the mother
        tree's consciousness.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        A strange light flashed across the Ancestral Tree King's eyes as he
        slowly said,
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Mother tree sensed that another natural enemy has appeared and told us
        to kill it."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Is it that strange creature again? It's actually not extinct." The
        Secret Tree King was a little interested.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Ancestral Tree Dynasty nodded. "Hmm, the secondary dimension is
        suitable for you. Go and lead our kindred to resolve this matter. Try to
        find its location before the natural enemy enters adulthood."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "I'll try my best." The Secret Tree King did not comment further.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This was not the first time the World Tree had discovered a natural
        enemy. In the early years of the civilization, there were records of
        natural enemies invading.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The restraining relationship between the two sides came from the
        abnormal entanglement at the information state level. There was a
        two-way connection, so the World Tree Civilization had always paid
        attention to the existence of natural enemies.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The World Tree's ability to sense its natural enemy was divided into two
        phases. When the natural enemy was in its infancy, the World Tree would
        only know of its existence and would not be able to sense its exact
        location. As the natural enemy gradually matured, the sense towards it
        would also become stronger. When any natural enemy entered adulthood,
        the World Tree would be able to track their location accurately to kill
        them, eliminating a large number of natural enemies.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, the World Tree could only sense its natural enemy after it was
        born, and it could not discover the embryo that the natural enemy had
        given birth to. Therefore, it had never been able to kill all of them.
        In the end, there were still some that managed to slip through the net,
        so it could only settle for the next best thing &mdash; taking the
        initiative to kill the infants.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In fact, the World Tree had always been focused on expanding in the
        secondary dimension, and part of the reason was that it was dedicated to
        exterminating its natural enemy. Once it sensed something, it would
        immediately inform the Tree Kings to kill the younglings of its natural
        enemy as soon as possible and not allow its natural enemy to enter
        adulthood. This was a very high priority, and only the Tree Kings knew
        of the details.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Fortitude Tree King could not help but ask, "What about the
        frontline war?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Let's first eliminate the mother tree's natural enemy. It seems like
        our operation will have to be postponed." The Ancestral Tree King
        glanced at him, thought for a moment, and added, "Don't forget to water
        the Subduing Tree King."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Secondary Dimension World, expeditionary army outpost.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        A huge ring-shaped teleportation gate was suspended in the dimensional
        space. This was the gate that the three Universal Civilizations used to
        enter and exit from the main universe. There were many secondary
        dimension fortresses around it, and groups of exploration teams came and
        went.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        With a flash of light, Han Xiao's figure appeared on the special
        transportation platform.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The person in charge of the outpost was already waiting there. He
        immediately came forward.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Your Excellency Black Star, you're finally here."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "How's the situation now?" Han Xiao looked at him and asked.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "That embryo's absorption rate of dimension energy suddenly increased by
        a million times. I don't know if it's good or bad. You should go take a
        look yourself. I've already prepared the vehicle for you." "Alright… By
        the way, how did the Realmless King react?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "He went there a step earlier. He should be observing the changes in the
        embryo at a close distance."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Alright, I'll go too."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Han Xiao nodded.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After more than ten years of development, the secondary dimension that
        the Realmless King had lent out had already been modified by the three
        Universal Civilizations. Currently, the three Universal Civilizations
        were using this outpost as a springboard to greatly increase the
        expeditionary army's strength. Furthermore, the three Universal
        Civilizations used their tradition of being hooligans to convince the
        Realmless King to take out more territories for them to build their
        bases. Currently, this area had already become a ‘shallow dimension',
        where the three Universal Civilizations could enter and leave to and
        from the main universe directly.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Even if the Realmless King was unwilling to provoke the World Tree, he
        was now tied to the same war chariot by the three Universal
        Civilizations.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao sat on the carrier, set the coordinates of the dimension, and
        started the engine. The heavy particle thruster spewed out raging flames
        and quickly turned into an invisible tail stream. The conventional
        engine transitioned to the dimensional shuttle engine, accelerated to
        the critical point, and disappeared from the spot, performing a
        hyperdrive jump. The shuttle entered a colorful tunnel. Not long after,
        the carrier suddenly shook, and the light outside the window
        disappeared, turning into a black secondary dimension space. They had
        arrived at their destination.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        A grayish-white embryo floated in the middle of the dimension, guarded
        by a large number of mechanical troops.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The projection of the Realmless King was right beside him. When it
        sensed the vehicle entering, it could not help but turn around. When it
        realized that it was Han Xiao, it approached him.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Black Star, you're here too."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Tell me about the situation." Han Xiao flew to his side.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "The energy of this dimension is flowing into the embryo at an extremely
        high speed. If this continues, it will collapse very soon. I feel that
        this embryo is about to be born…" the Realmless King explained.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Han Xiao nodded and looked at the embryo.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The gray fog under the membrane was originally very stable, but at this
        time, it was like boiling water, and it was fluctuating wildly. The long
        black shadows inside were becoming more and more distinct, attacking the
        membrane from the inside, causing bumps to appear on the embryo.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In Han Xiao's senses, this embryo seemed to have turned into an energy
        black hole. The quality, space, and energy of this secondary dimension
        were all collapsing toward the embryo and being devoured. When some eggs
        were born, they would eat the eggshells to replenish their nutrition. In
        Han Xiao's opinion, the second dimension where the Pivotal Snake Egg
        drained its energy from, like a parasite, was similar.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Not long after, the secondary dimension became riddled with holes. The
        remaining debris was quickly eaten up by the Pivotal Snake Egg, and the
        embryo was directly exposed in the space storm.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao had already retracted his mechanical army. He did not interfere
        with the changes of the Pivotal Snake Egg and watched from the side with
        the Realmless King.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Chi!</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The membrane suddenly split open, and the grayish-white fog inside
        leaked out, spreading outwards. The surrounding chaotic space stream
        could not penetrate this layer of fog.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao pulled over a cloud of fog and analyzed it. He realized that
        the substance formed by this fog was a special biological particle that
        could isolate space storms and seemed to have the ability to shatter
        through space, allowing one to travel through dimensions. The membrane
        quickly shriveled, but the fog was still increasing, covering the
        appearance of the Pivotal Snake. Only a black shadow could be seen in
        the gray fog, like a dragon hiding in the clouds.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Right at this moment, the Pivotal Snake suddenly flew in the opposite
        direction of the two of them.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Is he trying to escape?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao's eyes sparkled, and with a wave of his hand, the space device
        locked onto the Pivotal Snake, preventing it from moving. He slowly
        approached and flew into the gray fog. The interface immediately
        indicated that he had received continuous attacks. The surrounding gray
        fog was actively repelling outsiders, but the damage was too low and
        could not break through his defense. He did not lose any health at all.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Entering the center of the gray fog, Han Xiao finally saw the true
        appearance of the Pivotal Snake…
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This was an enormous dark gold snake-shaped creature. It did not have an
        outer carapace, and its entire body was gleaming with a metallic luster.
        Its skin was constantly releasing more gray fog. This seemed to be
        something that was automatically generated by it, so it should be an
        external protective layer. It had two pairs of enormous membranous wings
        on its back and a pair of sharp claws on its abdomen. Its head looked
        like a snake's head, but it did not have a mouth or nose, only a pair of
        cold golden vertical pupils.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Compared to the Space Louse, the Pivotal Snake looked much more
        beautiful.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Although it's called a snake, it looks more like a dragon…" Han Xiao
        thought to himself. He took out his psychic communication device and
        tried to communicate with the Pivotal Snake.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao could feel the Pivotal Snake's cold and aloof emotions, but it
        did not respond to his probing. ‘Eh, newborn animals treat the first
        creature they meet as their parents. Isn't this how they act…
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Even if it's not like this, with my charisma and affinity, this little
        animal shouldn't be so cold to me…'
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao was curious and tried a few more times. However, the Pivotal
        Snake only stared at him with its cold golden eyes and did not reply. It
        was as though it was extremely wary of the outside world.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Seeing this, he stopped communicating and directly poked the Pivotal
        Snake.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The next moment, the other party's attributes popped up on the
        interface. Han Xiao quickly browsed through and was stunned. In the
        Pivotal Snake's stats window, there was a talent ability that could
        sense the World Tree's main body. However, it was currently in a gray
        frozen state, and the ability introduction stated that it would only be
        activated when it reached adulthood. At this time, the Pivotal Snake was
        still a hatchling.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Such talent! As expected of the World Tree's nemesis!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao was shocked and immediately became surprised.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This was a pleasant surprise. This meant that the three Universal
        Civilizations had a stable way of finding the World Tree's main body.
        They no longer had to place all their hopes on luck!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Hmm, that doesn't seem right. If not for Harrison, he wouldn't have been
        able to touch the Realmless King, much less the Pivotal Snake Egg… In
        the end, it was all because of Harrison's luck?!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "His Luck Glow is stronger than I thought…" Han Xiao was speechless, and
        his brain immediately started thinking.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He did not expect the Pivotal Snake to have such an ability, which meant
        that his plan could be changed. With such a trump card, the most
        important thing now was to nurture the Pivotal Snake infant and let it
        enter adulthood as soon as possible. This way, he could directly mess
        with the World Tree's heart like a playboy.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "However, the expeditionary army cannot pause its actions. Who knows how
        long it will take for the Pivotal Snake to reach adulthood…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao made up his mind and continued trying to communicate with the
        Pivotal Snake. However, the Pivotal Snake hatchling still did not
        respond. It seemed like it would do whatever it wanted, and Han Xiao did
        not know what to do with it. After all, this was the first time he had
        come into contact with a Pivotal Snake. He wondered if all newborn
        Pivotal Snakes were like this.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He did not dare to deactivate his control over the Pivotal Snake
        hatchling either. Judging from how this thing ran away the moment it was
        born, it was most likely going to die if he let it go.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao had no choice but to put the communication problem aside for
        the time being. He grabbed the Pivotal Snake and walked to the Realmless
        King's side.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "It's a very strange creature that's very useful to me. It feeds on
        secondary dimensions. Since you're called the Lord of a Million
        Dimensions, I'll leave the feeding mission to you."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">The Realmless King's face fell when he heard this.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Those secondary dimensions were all territories that he had collected.
        Lending them to the three Universal Civilizations was already very
        depressing, and now he even wanted to feed them to this creature? Do you
        really think I'm a dog that you can slaughter as you please?!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Seeing that he did not respond, Han Xiao raised his brows. "You're not
        willing?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "…I'm honored." The Realmless King agreed to Han Xiao's unreasonable
        request without hesitation.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Stop talking, I'm a coward.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Don't worry, I won't let you feed them for nothing. The three Universal
        Civilizations will give you some main universe materials in exchange."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Han Xiao smiled and comforted him.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Since the Realmless King liked to collect trash, the three Universal
        Civilizations would definitely not be stingy with this cost. After all,
        what they did not lack the most was trash.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After successfully persuading the Realmless King to be generous, Han
        Xiao turned to look at the Pivotal Snake hatchling again. His eyes
        sparkled, as though he had seen the light of hope.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Pivot Snake lowered its head and looked at him. Its golden eyes
        flashed with a human-like look of rejection as if it was a prisoner
        facing a guard.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Sensing this emotion, Han Xiao narrowed his eyes.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "My first impression of it isn't too good. Could it be that the Pivotal
        Snake loves freedom? It seems like raising this creature won't be that
        easy."
      </p>

      </h1>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao did not continue to stare at the Pivotal Snake. He left an
        Observer's Mark and summoned two apostles and a group of elite
        mechanical soldiers to act as bodyguards. Only then did he bring it back
        to the outpost to inform the leaders of the three Universal
        Civilizations.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The leaders of the three Universal Civilizations were overjoyed when
        they learned about the situation of the Pivotal Snake. They immediately
        told the expeditionary army to cooperate with the Realmless King to
        nurture the Pivotal Snake's infant and provide strict protection. They
        also treated the Pivotal Snake's abilities as top secret.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Pivotal Snake's infant was extremely wary of the outside world, but
        it was born with the desire to absorb more nutrients. The Pivotal Snake
        only calmed down a little when the Realmless King unwillingly took out a
        new secondary dimension to feed it. It started to absorb the dimension
        energy and ate obediently.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao did not leave immediately. Instead, he stayed there for a while
        and tried to communicate. However, the Pivotal Snake had always ignored
        the others, so he had no choice but to temporarily give up on the idea
        of gaining Favorability.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After staying in the secondary dimension world for seven to eight days,
        the battle on the frontlines also came to an end. The World Tree once
        again lost the battle, and the Flickering World border defense circle
        repelled the enemy. The two sides were still in a stalemate.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The results of this battle were announced by the three Universal
        Civilizations, and the victory at the individual strength aspect was
        emphasized. The galactic residents were overjoyed, and their sense of
        security increased greatly. Their confidence in the war increased to a
        certain extent.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The frontline battle report also spread to the Holy Accord Organization,
        causing many of the Holy Accord Revivors to exclaim.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "The strength of the Beyond Grade A Association is getting stronger.
        They don't even need to use their full strength to kill a Tree King."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "I can tell that they're much stronger than ten years ago. So
        remarkable. Sigh, I also wanted to participate in Black Star's
        training."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"It's a pity we can't expose ourselves easily…"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Many of the Holy Accord Revivors sighed with complicated expressions.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        These revived individuals who lived in seclusion in the Holy Accord did
        not appear in the outside world, and they were still unregistered.
        Although they had already reached an agreement with Han Xiao to take
        action when the time came, they had not been summoned yet. They could
        only continue to hide their existence in the Holy Accord and not
        participate in the training.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Some of them originally wanted to participate, but Han Xiao did not
        allow them to be exposed, so they could only give up. Having lost this
        opportunity, they could not help but feel regretful. If they had known
        that they would have to participate in the war anyway, they would have
        chosen to leave their seclusion together with the rest of the revivors
        at the start.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Hey, Oathkeeper, when can we join the battle?" someone could not help
        but ask.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Oathkeeper was expressionless as he said coldly,</p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Don't ask me. My words don't count."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Then hurry Black Star more. Otherwise, what's the use of you?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"..."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Oathkeeper took a deep breath and calmed himself down.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Ever since Black Star became a Transcendent, his leadership position in
        the Holy Accord organization existed in name only. He had no choice but
        to ask Black Star for his opinion in almost everything.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        What was even more outrageous was that these snobbish Holy Accord
        Revivors used to be grateful to him when they just revived and respected
        him. Now that a new generation had replaced the old, these people had
        all become Black Star's lackeys and did not give any regards to him, the
        leader of the organization in name. It was seriously infuriating.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, Black Star was the only Transcendent in the current Galactic
        Society, so what else could he do? Oathkeeper had already given up on
        competing with Black Star. His subordinate position was becoming more
        stable, and he had to accept reality.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        One of the Holy Accord Revivors rubbed his hands and said with a deep
        voice, "Black Star has given the three Universal Civilizations such a
        huge advantage. According to the current situation, we might not even
        have the chance to make a move. Just the association and the direct
        descendants of the civilizations are enough to deal with the high-level
        combatants of the enemy… With Black Star's personality, he might
        continue to hide our existence as a trump card if he can suppress the
        enemy."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "That makes sense. Doesn't that mean we can enjoy the chance to revive
        in the Sanctum for free?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Everyone's eyes lit up.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">...</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Secondary dimension world, World Tree territory.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Numerous members of the World Tree were gathered there, and every
        spaceship was glowing with green light.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "The search force has been assembled. Please give instructions."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In the bridge of the flagship, the Secret Tree King was inspecting the
        troops. An executive officer walked over quickly and reported in a low
        voice.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Tree King nodded and said casually, "Since everyone is here, let's
        go."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In order to find the mother tree's natural enemy, he had specially come
        to the secondary dimension world to manage the situation and spent a few
        days gathering a large number of Blessed Races.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Although the nemesis had not been born for long and Mother Tree's
        perception was vague, the World Tree was extremely powerful in the
        secondary dimension. It had countless troops stationed there, and it was
        not afraid of spending time to find a needle in a haystack.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At this time, the Secret Tree King thought of something and sneered.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "By the way, the enemy seems to have been searching for the main body of
        the mother tree. We can also solve this matter by capturing the enemy's
        team and obtaining their intelligence."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Understood."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The order was quickly passed down, and the search fleet formed by the
        World Tree's Blessed Races started moving, turning into streams of light
        and scattering.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Seeing this, the Secret Tree King narrowed his eyes, raised his palm,
        and dense magic power flashed between his fingers.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He decided to take action personally this time. If he was lucky enough
        to meet the enemy's fleet in the secondary dimension, he would not let
        any of them escape.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">...</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In a desolate universe belt in the explored universe.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        A small spaceship slowly landed on a desolate planet. The ground cracked
        open automatically, revealing a parking orbit.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The spaceship smoothly connected with the orbit, moved in, and
        disappeared into the dark hole. Very soon, the hole closed again, and
        the disguise was restored.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After gliding in the darkness for a while, the spaceship finally stopped
        and arrived at a secret underground base.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">The hatch slid open, and a figure walked out.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        On the other side, another person was already waiting on the platform.
        When he saw the person, he said in a deep voice,
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"How's the situation outside?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Another Tree King has been killed. The three Universal Civilizations
        and the World Tree are in a stalemate. According to this trend, the
        World Tree will not be able to break through the border defense circle
        for a very long time."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Is that so… it seems like the three Universal Civilizations are still
        very tenacious. With Black Star around, it's still unknown who will
        win."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Right now, the World Tree's biggest weakness is the lack of
        intelligence. If they get enough intelligence, the situation will change
        drastically… What did the superiors say?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Our superiors have already given orders for us to find a way to provide
        information about the galactic society to the World Tree while hiding
        ourselves. The most important thing is to provide the coordinates of the
        various Star Fields controlled by the three Universal Civilizations so
        that the World Tree can obtain a detailed strategic map… The Star
        Alliance has also agreed to this operation. They have always wanted to
        get rid of the threat of the three Universal Civilizations. After
        observing for so long, they have finally found a perfect opportunity to
        destroy them with a borrowed knife."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Phew, I can't remember how many years I've been hiding here. I can
        finally take revenge… It's time for the three Universal Civilizations to
        pay the price for what they did back then!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The two of them had strong hostility toward the three Universal
        Civilizations.

      <p class="calibre3">In the unexplored universe, Star Alliance capital.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Savignes quickly walked into the office of the Star Alliance Leader.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Star Alliance Leader was waiting for him. Seeing him walk into the
        room, he put down the report in his hand, looked up, and slowly said,
        "How's the situation?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "I've already sent out the instructions. The lurkers will take action
        soon," Savignes said with a deep voice.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Hmm, this chess piece has been set up for so many years. Now is the
        time for them to show their value." The Star Alliance Leader paused for
        a moment before changing the topic "However, we have to pay attention to
        the method of providing intelligence. Everything needs to be done under
        the premise of our existence being hidden. The three Universal
        Civilizations and the World Tree are both huge threats. If our existence
        is exposed to them, the dark clouds of war will cover us too. With our
        strength, it would be beyond our capabilities no matter which side we
        fight head-on."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Don't worry, we're all in this together. We won't joke about the safety
        of the Star Alliance," Savignes said solemnly.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Hmm, you guys have been with the Star Alliance for many years, and we
        are already one. This operation is not only to eliminate potential
        threats but also for your revenge." The Star Alliance Leader nodded.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "That's right. Back then, we were defeated by the three Universal
        Civilizations, and only a few of our people managed to escape. It was
        almost impossible for us to survive, and we became a wandering
        civilization in the universe. If not for encountering the Star
        Alliance's team, our civilization might have died long ago. To this day,
        we are thankful to the Star Alliance for their help."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Savignes lowered his head and said respectfully.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        When the Lore Civilization had been defeated, his ancestors had gathered
        the remaining members of their race and united them. It had been
        difficult for them to survive. Now, Savignes had taken over the
        authority of his predecessors and was the current leader of the Lore
        Civilization.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The history of the Lore Civilization was quite ancient, it was once a
        member of the explored universe. It was one of the competitors in the
        exploration era war. Unfortunately, it lost the war, and the
        civilization was destroyed. Its homeland fell, and only a few survivors
        escaped on spaceships. Because they were worried about being eliminated,
        they decided to enter the unexplored universe and travel far away,
        becoming wanderers of the universe.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After many twists and turns in the wormhole, this group of wanderers
        happened to arrive in the Star Alliance's territory.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Star Alliance was a large joint civilization formed by forty-six
        civilizations. They lived quietly in a corner of the unexplored
        universe. By chance, they picked up this group of wanderers, and the
        intelligence brought by the Lore Civilization immediately attracted
        their attention.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This was the first time the Star Alliance had heard of the existence of
        a powerful civilization outside their territory. The intelligence
        provided by the Lore Civilization showed that the three Universal
        Civilizations were strong enough to destroy the entire Star Alliance,
        which made the Star Alliance extremely fearful and vigilant. In their
        eyes, the three Universal Civilizations could bring a calamity to the
        Star Alliance at any time, and swallowing them up was a huge hidden
        danger that made them unable to sleep or eat in peace.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Facing an unfamiliar and powerful civilization, the Star Alliance did
        not dare expose their existence to communicate with the other party.
        They could only observe silently. Under normal circumstances, even if
        the Star Alliance knew that there were strong enemies around, they would
        be helpless. However, the Lore Civilization provided them with a way.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        When the wanderers escaped from their homeland, they had brought along a
        large number of coordinates. This was a priceless fortune, and the Star
        Alliance saw an opportunity.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Based on this information, the upper echelons of the Star Alliance
        finally decided on a strategic operation called the ‘Observer's Plan'.
        They sent out lurkers to the explored universe through wormholes. They
        hid their identities, gathered intelligence, and waited for an
        opportunity while monitoring the actions of the three Universal
        Civilizations.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The three Universal Civilizations did not have an Information Form
        warning network like the World Tree. As their territory was extremely
        large, there would always be gaps in the screening and security
        mechanisms. As long as the outsiders operated properly, they would be
        able to successfully infiltrate the three Universal Civilizations. In
        Han Xiao's previous life, the World Tree had been hiding like this for
        many years, gathering enough intelligence before launching a full-scale
        attack on the three Universal Civilizations.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Star Alliance knew their limits, and they did not think that their
        small body would be able to withstand the three Universal Civilizations'
        attacks. Thus, they only let the lurkers observe and not take part in
        any other actions. They were like the lowest level galactic hackers,
        completely inconspicuous. They only searched for public intelligence on
        the internet and did not try to obtain any secrets. They were extremely
        cautious, which was why they were able to remain hidden until now and
        watch the development of the three Universal Civilizations.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After receiving repeated checks from the Star Alliance, the Lore
        Civilization finally became a new member. They were able to procreate,
        but they never forgot their history, and always thought about revenge.
        They cooperated with the Observer's Plan and helped the Star Alliance
        hide in the explored universe.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This time, the three Universal Civilizations were invaded by the World
        Tree, which gave the Star Alliance a hope of eliminating the threat.
        They could not defeat the three Universal Civilizations themselves, so
        they decided to add fuel to the fire.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Star Alliance Leader rubbed the back of his hand and said, "We can
        use the World Tree to get rid of the three Universal Civilizations, but
        the World Tree itself is a new threat. The ideal situation is for both
        of them to suffer, so we can take advantage." Savignes nodded heavily.
        "The three Universal Civilizations' technology level is very high. If we
        can take over their achievements, we will be able to advance quickly."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "However, this is very risky, and we might expose ourselves. We have to
        think about it carefully… If there's really a chance, we can't miss it."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The eyes of the Star Alliance Leader flickered. He naturally coveted the
        technological achievements accumulated by the three Universal
        Civilizations. Although the risk was high, the benefits were equally
        tempting.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The three Universal Civilizations had stabilized the situation and
        blocked the World Tree outside. This was not what the Star Alliance
        wanted to see. Destroying the good situation of the three Universal
        Civilizations and bringing the flames of war into the entire galactic
        society to cause chaos was in line with this third party's interests.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Star Alliance Leader did not mind taking advantage of the situation.
        Under the premise of hiding their identity, they secretly participated
        in this feast.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Secondary dimension world.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        A team of three Universal Civilizations' expedition army was traveling
        in the secondary dimension, recording the coordinates.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "This place is not far from the base dimension of the World Tree, and
        Blessed Race members might appear. Keep your spirits up and prepare to
        retreat at any time."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In the cockpit, the commander stared at the radar with a serious tone.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In the past few years, as the expedition army explored deeper and
        deeper, the encounters with the World Tree Blessed Races became more
        frequent. Fortunately, they ran fast enough, and most of the time, there
        were no accidents.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, fleeing the danger was not always an option. The search network
        of the Blessed Race was extremely dense, and the expeditionary army did
        not wish to start a conflict. Thus, the exploration progress became
        slower and slower and there were not many loopholes to exploit.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "If this goes on, I don't know when we will get results. The World Tree
        has already reached our territory. We don't have much time left…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">The commander sighed.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Wuwuwu-"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Suddenly, an ear-piercing alarm sounded on the radar. It was like a
        thunderclap, scaring everyone. Not far away, cracks suddenly appeared on
        the dimensional barrier, and green streams of light shot over.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"It's the World Tree Blessed Races! Retreat!"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">The commander's expression changed.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The expedition team immediately turned around and locked onto the
        evacuation route. The shuttle engine buzzed and turned into a stream of
        light, escaping from this dimension into another.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, before the expedition team could come to a stop, the alarm on
        the radar sounded again, and the space cracks opened. Another group of
        World Tree Blessed Race members was rushing over. "This is a
        premeditated attack!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The commander immediately reacted. With a heavy expression, he commanded
        the fleet to continue fleeing.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The fleet passed through five secondary dimensions in a row, with the
        World Tree Blessed Races following closely behind them.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Suddenly, the commander stopped running. He took a deep breath and made
        up his mind.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Prepare to self-destruct."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Hearing this, the crew members in the bridge all felt a chill in their
        hearts. They did not speak or object, only silently activating the
        self-destruct sequence.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The soldiers of the three Universal Civilizations could not revive as
        they wished like the World Tree. Without the protection of the
        Underworld, they would truly die in battle if they died. All the
        expedition teams were mentally prepared to sacrifice their entire fleet
        if the situation turned bad.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The energy core stabilizer disintegrated, and the psionic energy that
        had lost control began to expand, emitting a strong light.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "I'm honored to have worked with all of you. Long live the Dynasty."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The commander looked at the determined faces of the crew members,
        saluted, and then looked at the World Tree pursuers outside the
        porthole. He closed his eyes and prepared to die.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Buzz!</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, at this moment, everything froze in an instant. All the crew
        members could not move, and the self-destruction process stopped. The
        psionic energy that was about to go out of control stopped in an
        instant.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Secret Tree King's figure appeared in the cabin unknowingly. He
        sized up everyone's determined faces and sneered.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Quite unyielding. It's a pity that I came personally. No matter how
        determined you are, it's useless."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Secret Tree King maintained the effect of the spacetime freeze
        spell. He rubbed his palm lightly, and the green lustrous power of the
        Tree King spread out, turning into a space crack. From within, a
        snake-like World Tree Root extended out and penetrated all the
        battleships of the expedition team. More and more small tree roots were
        separated and inserted into the bodies of all the crew members.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Then, these roots absorbed their essence like straws. At the same time,
        they transformed the team into one of their own by reforming them in the
        Information Form layer. The expedition team slowly integrated into the
        World Tree Root and sank deeper.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This process lasted for a long time before the World Tree sucked the
        entire expedition team in. Then, with a flash of light, it vomited
        again. However, it was different from before. All the crew members were
        flowing with green light and transformed into the members of the World
        Tree.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Your Excellency Tree King." The soldiers from the Crimson Dynasty
        lowered their heads and bowed respectfully.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Secret Tree King ignored them and focused on the mental network,
        sharing the memories of these people and the sailing log of the
        spaceship. After browsing for a while, the Secret Tree King's eyes
        flashed, and he revealed a playful expression. "Heh, so it was here. I
        found your nest."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At this moment, the Secret Tree King suddenly felt something and looked
        into the distance.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Predicting me?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        A cold look appeared in the eyes of the Secret Tree King. His hand
        gestures changed, and his magic power surged out, following the
        mysterious sense of the source.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At the same time, somewhere on Floating Dragon Island.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Pfft!"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Aesop, who was feeling the sudden premonition, was shocked. It was as if
        his brain had been hit by a hammer, and he collapsed to the ground with
        a shocked expression.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        A cold magical power shattered the foresight in his mind and damaged his
        spirit.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Those who could cause a backlash to a Foreseer were basically all Mages.
        With different foresight abilities, the difficulty of the backlash would
        also change. Aesop's foresight ability was not ordinary. In all these
        years, he had experienced countless passive foresight and had also
        foreseen many Beyond Grade A Mages. The worst-case scenario would be a
        failure, and this was the first time someone had caused him a backlash.

      </h1>
      <p class="calibre3">At the expeditionary army outpost.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        An exploratory fleet was docked at the dock. Harrison and his teammates
        alighted from the spaceship, took off their life-preserving helmets
        before taking a deep breath.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "I'm dying of suffocation. The air in the base's large ecological shield
        is still the best. In the past few days outside, the gas filters of the
        spaceships have all become smelly."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Really? Why don't I feel anything?" "I wonder if it's because us
        Gukates have a better sense of smell than most galactic species?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "It's a pity that I didn't gain anything from this trip."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Hearing his crewmates engage in idle chatter, Harrison rubbed his
        forehead in frustration.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Ever since he unearthed this ally, the Realmless King, the upper
        echelons had allowed him to lead an expedition team alone. From a
        follower to a team commander, he had a certain degree of freedom to make
        exploration plans.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Black Star had always said that Harrison was lucky, and Harrison was
        willing to believe that it was true. He secretly hoped that his luck
        would help him find the World Tree's main body and end the war as soon
        as possible. However, after so many years, the luck that he had high
        hopes for seemed to have become dormant. Other than escaping from the
        pursuit of the World Tree's Blessed Race a few times, he did not have
        any new achievements in exploring
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Now that the expeditionary army's exploration progress had come to a
        standstill, Harrison was both anxious and worried. As the saying went,
        if one walked by the river all the time, one's shoes would inevitably
        get wet. The expeditionary army kept wandering around the territory of
        the World Tree, and they met their pursuers time and time again. He felt
        that there might come a time when they would fail.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At this moment, one of the team members patted Harrison on the shoulder
        and said, "Captain, how long do we rest this time before we start the
        next exploration?".
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Ten days," Harrison replied.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Got it. Let's go to the base cafeteria for lunch. Want to come?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "No, I'll report to the logistics department and have them repair and
        maintain the spaceship. I still have to write a routine report."
        Harrison waved his hand.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Alright, we'll bring you some food. What do you want to eat?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Then I want…"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Harrison was just about to say something when he suddenly stopped. At
        that moment, a chilling feeling gripped his heart.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Without getting an answer, the team member blinked in confusion and
        asked again, "Why aren't you saying anything? What do you want to eat?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Harrison's mind was in a mess, and he felt a strong sense of vigilance.
        He could not help but look up at the scenery outside the port. "What are
        you looking at?" The team member turned his head and followed Harrison's
        gaze. The only thing he saw was the dim yellow light of the setting sun
        in the secondary dimension. It was like an oil painting with the aura of
        history, but he did not see anything unusual.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Something's not right…"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Harrison became warier.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The team member wanted to ask more, but at this moment, the dimension
        barrier in the distance suddenly lit up with a blue light and quickly
        turned into a huge space vortex. It was as if a hole had been torn open,
        and the green and lustrous World Tree Blessed Race swarmed out like
        locusts, covering the sky and covering the earth. They were like tiny
        green dots that quickly enlarged in everyone's vision.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Wuwuwu-Alert! The space barrier has been broken! Enemy attack!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        An ear-piercing alarm suddenly resounded throughout the base. All the
        expeditionary army members who were resting and waiting in the base
        jumped in shock. The sound of anxious shouts, anxious footsteps, and
        chaotic crashing sounds created a riotous symphony.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Everyone, retreat at full speed! Prepare to self-destruct! The defense
        team will be staying behind to buy time!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The roar of the person in charge of the outpost sounded in the
        communication channel. Half an hour ago, an expedition team had
        self-destructed and lost contact. He was still investigating this matter
        and was not sure if there had been any intelligence leaks. He did not
        expect the World Tree to arrive so quickly. The World Tree was extremely
        powerful in the secondary dimension, and the defense of this outpost was
        limited. The coordinates of the dimension had already been exposed, and
        if they fought head-on, it would attract more of the World Tree Blessed
        Race. In the preset plan that the three Universal Civilizations had
        planned, if this outpost was attacked, the first priority would be to
        self-destruct and clear the traces, while the expeditionary army would
        quickly retreat. Unless they had no choice, they would not choose to
        fight head-on.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Let's go!"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Harrison's expression changed drastically, and he could not care less
        about anything else. He quickly called his teammates to board the dock
        and started the engine.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The outpost became chaotic all of a sudden, and the automatic defense
        team was hastily activated to fight against the endless stream of World
        Tree Blessed Race to buy time. Meanwhile, the expeditionary army members
        behind swarmed toward the warehouse and quickly found their vehicles to
        evacuate.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Streams of light shot out from the base and scattered to escape into
        different secondary dimensions.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Very soon, the vanguard troops of the World Tree Family started fighting
        head-on with the defense team of the outpost. In an instant, countless
        battleships exploded into fireworks.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At the same time, the fortresses in the outpost activated their
        self-destruct sequence and exploded. The gate that connected to the main
        material universe was also destroyed by the physical missiles fired by
        the base. Flames soared into the sky, black smoke filled the air, and
        countless debris rained down.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The defense team was quickly destroyed, and the outpost exploded
        violently. The same scene happened in multiple secondary dimensions. The
        World Tree obtained precise coordinates half an hour ago, quickly
        assembled, and located their destinations directly. A large-scale
        blitzkrieg was carried out, catching the three Universal Civilizations
        off guard. The bridgehead that the three Universal Civilizations had
        built in the territory of the Realmless King were destroyed one after
        another, and many expedition teams had to escape.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">On the other side, the Realmless King's residence.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        A magic portal shining with green light suddenly opened, and the Secret
        Tree King slowly walked out. The first thing he saw was the black
        mountain range and the huge throne in the middle of the dimension.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, there was no sign of the Realmless King on the throne. "Am I
        late? Or was it a coincidence that he's not at home?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Secret Tree King activated his perception magic and realized that the
        Realmless King was not hiding anywhere in the area. He could not help
        but feel a little regretful. The stabilization zone controlled by the
        Realmless King had some reputation in this secondary dimension area. The
        World Tree Blessed Race had also heard about it, but they had never paid
        attention to it.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        When he found out from the expedition team that the three Universal
        Civilizations were working together with the Realmless King, the Secret
        Tree King had wanted to go straight to the Realmless King's base camp
        and turn him into a member of the World Tree. However, he realized that
        the Realmless King was not at home, so he could only give up on this
        plan for the time being.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Secret Tree King raised his hand and clenched his fist. Magical
        runes shot out and turned into a surveillance spell that took root in
        this secondary dimension. The moment the Realmless King returned to his
        base, he would come and attack again.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After casually setting up the spell, the Secret Tree King summoned the
        teleportation gate and stepped into it. The vortex quickly shrank and
        disappeared with him.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At the same time, in the secondary dimension at the edge of the
        Realmless King's territory.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Space was slowly collapsing, and wave after wave of dimensional energy
        was being devoured by the Pivotal Snake hatchling. At the side, the
        Realmless King who was in charge of feeding it suddenly stopped, and his
        heart tightened.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He had a basic sense within the territory that he controlled. Just now,
        he had sensed that the World Tree Army had raided the secondary
        dimensions that were lent to the three Universal Civilizations one after
        another. Almost all the outposts had fallen, and the most terrifying
        thing was that an uninvited guest had arrived at his headquarters. It
        was obvious that their target was him.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"The World Tree still came!"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">The Realmless King panicked.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Although he treated the intelligence of the three Universal
        Civilizations as a bargaining chip, he was not willing to reveal it to
        the World Tree unless he had no other choice. The risk was too high, and
        the World Tree was obviously targeting him now. Beyond Grade As had gone
        all the way to his base, and even if he expressed his willingness to
        cooperate, they would most likely kill him to ensure that the
        intelligence was reliable.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Luckily, I came out. If I had stayed at home, I would have turned into
        the puppet of the World Tree…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Realmless King felt a sense of lingering fear, and he looked at the
        Pivotal Snake with a complicated expression.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        When Black Star told him to take out his own territory to feed the
        Pivotal Snake, the Realmless King was very unhappy. Now that he looked
        at it, he only felt glad… If not for Black Star forcefully giving him
        this job, he would not have come out to walk the Pivotal Snake today,
        and would most likely have been trapped by the World Tree's experts at
        his home.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Does that mean… Black Star saved my life?!</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Since I can't go back, I can only walk this path to the end!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">The Realmless King quickly made up his mind.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He did not want to get involved in the war between two Universal
        Civilizations, but one of his trusted subordinates had already provoked
        the three Universal Civilizations and dragged him into it. Thus, he had
        no choice but to cooperate with the three Universal Civilizations. Right
        now, it was already too difficult for him to leave.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Since the World Tree had already set its sights on him, he had no choice
        but to take a stand. He had to suck up to the three Universal
        Civilizations and defeat the World Tree.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        With this in mind, the Realmless King turned to the Mechanical Oracle
        monitoring the Pivotal Snake and reported the situation.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The battle did not last too long. The World Tree Family wiped out the
        expeditionary army outpost. The surprise attack ended very quickly, and
        a large number of expedition teams fled in all directions. A portion of
        the World Tree fleet chased after the fluctuations of the dimensional
        travel, while the rest of the troops had already begun cleaning the
        battlefield, summarizing the results of the battle, and finishing up the
        work.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The roots of the World Tree extended out from the spatial rift, and
        expeditionary army spaceships were hanging on them. The Secret Tree King
        was floating at the side, sharing his memories with his eyes closed.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Not long after, the Secret Tree King opened his eyes again. His
        originally relaxed expression was now extremely solemn.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "I didn't expect the mother tree's natural enemy to have fallen under
        the enemy's control. The situation is dangerous…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Eliminating the enemies that were searching for the mother tree was
        originally just a matter of convenience. He did not expect to find the
        mother tree's natural enemy because of this. This was not good news.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        If the mother tree's natural enemy entered maturity, it would be able to
        sense the location of the mother tree's main body. If it could only move
        independently, it would not be a big threat. However, if it was
        controlled by the enemy, the threat level would soar to the extreme,
        which meant that the enemy could find the mother tree's main body.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Secret Tree King knew the severity of the matter. This meant that
        the World Tree, which was supposed to fight a war of attrition without
        any pressure, had to seize whatever time they had. They had to either
        kill the Pivotal Snake before it reaches adulthood or completely defeat
        the three Universal Civilizations before then. The only good news was
        that the Pivotal Snake had just been born, and it would take a long time
        for it to reach adulthood.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He immediately sent this matter to the Ancestral Tree King. The next
        moment, the voice of the Ancestral Tree King sounded in his mind.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Good job, or else we would still be kept in the dark. Summon a portion
        of your high-level combatants to hunt down the mother tree's natural
        enemy. You must eliminate it!" "Alright, I happened to obtain the
        coordinates of the enemy's territory in the secondary dimension from
        their memories. We have a new target." "Hmm, the Fortitude Tree King and
        I will be ready to receive you at any time. I'll leave the rest to you."
        The Ancestral Tree King nodded.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Just nice, I can successfully open up the secondary dimensional
        battlefield zone this time and solve both problems together."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        A cold light flickered in the Secret Tree King's eyes. He was not
        satisfied with destroying the outposts of the three Universal
        Civilizations. What he had his eyes on was the base camp that the three
        Universal Civilizations had developed in the secondary dimension world
        for a long time. The two sides had fought for more than ten years, and
        only today did they grasp the general situation of the three Universal
        Civilizations. They were no longer led by the nose, and they finally had
        a breakthrough.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Exploration Universe, frontline base.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao was listening to the battle conference when a report from the
        Mechanical Oracle suddenly appeared in his mind.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Oh? The World Tree found the expeditionary army outpost and launched a
        surprise attack. Did they succeed?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao frowned. He was somewhat surprised by this, but not too
        surprised. As the expeditionary army's exploration time increased, the
        risk of exposure also increased at the same time. He had long been
        mentally prepared for this, and the only thing that made him feel
        strange was the difference in time from his expectations.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        It had only been a few days since he had returned from the expeditionary
        army outpost, and he was still thinking about the follow-up plan when
        the World Tree broke through the outpost. It seemed like a coincidence,
        but Han Xiao felt that there was something fishy about
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">it.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "The secondary dimension battlefield has in the end been established,
        and that is the World Tree's home ground. Their attack this time
        probably allowed them to obtain the coordinates of the shallow
        dimensions, and this two-way battle is disadvantageous to the three
        Universal Civilizations… However, the three Universal Civilizations have
        also made preparations in the secondary dimension, so the situation will
        not be as bad as in my previous life."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao pondered. At this time, Simon, who was explaining the strategy,
        suddenly paused. A remote projection of a high-ranking military officer
        appeared on the conference table. His expression was extremely serious
        as he said in a deep voice,
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "This is an emergency. The secondary dimension expeditionary army
        outpost has been raided by the World Tree, and it has almost completely
        fallen. Some of the intelligence has been leaked, and the World Tree has
        likely obtained the coordinates of the shallow dimension. It is
        estimated that a second front line will be opened, and we urgently need
        high-level combatants to help!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The three Universal Civilizations' notification was a step slower than
        the Mechanical Oracle's. As soon as they finished speaking, all the
        officers present were shocked and turned to look at Han Xiao.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Hearing this, Han Xiao slowly nodded and asked,</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Who is leading the enemy?" "According to the information from the
        frontline, it's a Super who has never appeared before."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The image of the Secret Tree King appeared on the virtual screen. This
        was a photo taken before some bases self-destructed.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Secret Tree King…" Han Xiao immediately recognized this person."
        Alright, leave this to me."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At this moment, Simon opened his mouth and said with a frown, "Warring
        on two fronts will restrict our high-level combatants. Aurora won't be
        able to split herself up. At the same time, the enemy might even
        deliberately avoid Black Star, allowing them to use their foreign
        experts… I will definitely agree to assist the secondary dimensions, but
        the frontlines of the border are important battlefields. We have to
        maintain a sufficient number of advanced combatants."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "This is not a big problem. I have enough The King mechanical suits to
        move quickly on both sides. Also… I have more manpower."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Han Xiao nodded.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Compared to the terrifying scale of the galactic battlefield, the
        secondary dimension world was heavily divided due to its different
        specialties, which indirectly strengthened the importance of individual
        strength in the secondary dimension battlefield. It was time for the
        Holy Accord Organization's hooligans, who had been idling around for
        decades, to come into play.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Furthermore, this Secret Tree King was worth him taking action.

      </h1>
      <p class="calibre3">
        On the white desert ravaged by the radiation storm, a bright light
        suddenly flashed. An expedition starship that was emitting flames
        emerged from the crack and fell down as if it had lost all its power. It
        crashed onto the ground, shaking up the white sand in the sky. Its
        momentum did not decrease, and it plowed a deep ravine on the ground.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The azure particle shield, which was on the verge of shattering, endured
        the impact and flickered like a light bulb with a loose circuit. Then,
        it disappeared, and the spaceship suddenly sank. Its head was inserted
        into the desert, and its tail was raised up high. The distorted
        thrusters exploded with sparks, and it finally malfunctioned, spewing
        out black smoke.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Clang! Clang! Clang! The hatch of the spaceship was stuck, and there was
        a sound of collision coming from inside. The alloy door protruded out,
        and then it was sent flying with a bang. The deformed hatch smashed onto
        the sand and slid out more than ten meters.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Harrison and the others walked out while holding onto the injured parts
        of their bodies. Their bodies swayed as if they had drunk fake wine. The
        gravity stabilization device and gyroscope of the spaceship had failed,
        and it fell to the ground.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        One of the team members looked at the paralyzed spaceship and said in a
        panic, "Oh no, the spaceship is damaged. We can't run anymore!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Don't panic. The enemy hasn't caught up. Hurry up and repair it."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Harrison held his dizzy head, gritted his teeth, and ordered his
        teammates to repair the spaceship.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The outpost was attacked, and a large number of expedition teams fled in
        all directions. The World Tree Blessed Races pursued them relentlessly,
        and they also met the enemy. The team was left with only one spaceship,
        and it was not easy for them to shake off the pursuers. The spaceship
        that had endured the fierce attacks was pushed to the limit and broke
        down.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "I wonder how the outpost is doing," one of the team members muttered.
        "It is definitely destroyed. The World Tree came prepared. With the
        armed forces of the outpost, it's impossible for them to survive."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "While we were escaping, the commander was still giving orders in the
        main control room. I'm afraid he has already sacrificed himself by
        self-destructing, living and dying with the base…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The atmosphere in the crowd was filled with sadness. Having worked
        together for more than ten years, many of the expeditionary army members
        were already familiar with each other. At this time, the future of so
        many of their comrades looked ominous, and they were all worried.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "The situation of the World Tree attack should have been sent back to
        the main universe. Before I evacuated, I had already sent a message to
        His Excellency Black Star using the quantum network base station at the
        outpost. He should have received it, but he has yet to come to the
        rescue. I wonder…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Harrison's tone was hesitant. The moment he was attacked, he had sent
        out a request for help. While escaping, he had been protecting the
        ‘Throne' that Black Star had given him. He had been waiting for Han Xiao
        to arrive, but there had been no response.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Can we contact him again?" someone quickly asked.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Not at the moment. There's no linkable base station, so I can't contact
        the outside world for the time being…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Before Harrison could finish his sentence, a spatial fluctuation
        suddenly appeared on the spaceship, and Han Xiao walked out from the
        damaged cabin door. The moment everyone saw him, they were immediately
        surprised.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Your Excellency Black Star! You're finally here!"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "We're saved!" Han Xiao raised his hand and gestured for them to control
        their emotions. He then looked at Harrison and sized him up. "Looks like
        you're in good shape. You're not injured."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Harrison greeted him with a disappointed expression. "You're too late.
        The outpost has fallen. They…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao interrupted him, nodded, and said, "Alright, I already know
        about this. Since the outpost is gone, so be it. The three Universal
        Civilizations have already sent people to pick up the other
        expeditionary army soldiers. I'm here to pick you up… and your
        teammates."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        When the emergency notification from the three Universal Civilizations
        had reached the main base in the Siebert Fortress, Han Xiao had already
        received Harrison's request for help. The reason he had only rushed over
        now was that he had spent some time deploying the high-level combatants
        of the association and made a trip to the Realmless King's side to
        protect the Pivotal Snake. He had hidden the Pivotal Snake in a secret
        place and only came to pick up Harrison after doing all these important
        things. Han Xiao was not afraid of anything happening to Harrison. He
        had been using the Observer's Mark to monitor Harrison's situation.
        Seeing that he was safe, he did not teleport over immediately.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "What about the outposts? Aren't you going to reinforce them?" Harrison
        asked.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "There's no need. The dimensional coordinates of the outposts have been
        exposed, so it's not suitable to rebuild the base. Even if we want to
        rebuild the outpost, it will have to be somewhere else. The losses this
        time are not too big. The outposts have served their purpose over the
        years." Han Xiao waved his hands.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The purpose of the outpost was only to facilitate the expeditionary
        army's exploration of the deep layer dimensions, and the coordinates of
        the various dimensions had already been recorded into the database over
        the years. The coordinates of the Realmless King's territory and the
        areas around the World Tree had already been controlled by the three
        Universal Civilizations, which meant that these places had become ‘new
        shallow layer dimensions'. Thanks to the special structure of the
        secondary dimension world, and since they had the coordinates, the
        subsequent troops could quickly jump over even without the outpost. They
        did not have to travel for many years like in normal exploration. This
        was the most important result.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As for the outpost itself, it did not have any irreplaceable value. With
        these coordinates in hand, it could be rebuilt at any time. Therefore,
        this loss was nothing in the eyes of the three Universal Civilizations.
        They were more concerned about the degree of information leakage.
        Harrison nodded and asked, "What do we do next?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "I'll take you to the base camp of the three Universal Civilizations in
        the secondary dimension world. They have already gathered their troops
        there and are preparing to deal with the possible attacks from the World
        Tree. This time, the coordinates might have been leaked, and the World
        Tree opening up the secondary dimensional battlefront should be a
        foregone conclusion. The three Universal Civilizations will have to face
        a two-way battle from now on… After sending you off, I'll have a short
        meeting with the leaders of the three Universal Civilizations to discuss
        this matter."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Han Xiao said casually with a calm tone.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At this time, there was a high chance that the World Tree was still
        cleaning up the battlefield in the various outposts, but he did not have
        any intention of retaliating. Even if he went over, the Secret Tree King
        might not appear, and he would alert the enemy on top of making a wasted
        trip. He might as well wait for the Secret Tree King to start a two-way
        battle and then give him a big slap. If the World Tree had the
        coordinates of the shallow layer dimensions, it would not take much time
        to jump over, and they might even start another round of blitzkrieg.
        Therefore, Han Xiao guessed that the Secret Tree King would not take too
        long. Han Xiao gave a simple explanation and did not say anything else.
        He took out a new carrier, set the coordinates of the destination, and
        called everyone to board the ship.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Everyone obediently accepted the arrangement. Compared to the other
        expeditionary army soldiers, this group of people was lucky enough to be
        received by Han Xiao personally and escape from danger thanks to
        Harrison's luck glow.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Galactic Alliance Army was divided into many smaller armies. The
        border defense army guarded the frontlines of the Flickering World,
        while the secondary dimension garrison was responsible for guarding the
        base camp in the shallow layer dimensions. This was the foundation of
        the three Universal Civilizations in the secondary dimension world. If
        it was destroyed, they would lose most of their control over the
        secondary dimension.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        A few hours after the outposts were attacked, the garrisons in all the
        war zones in the shallow layer dimension were fully prepared for battle.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At this moment, in one of the shallow layer dimensions.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        While the blue energy was being replenished, the scene was like an
        ocean. A dynasty fleet that belonged to the secondary dimension garrison
        floated in the air and waited quietly. All the battleships were
        specially designed for the secondary dimension. Compared to the
        dynasty's standard heavy military starships, they were much slender and
        more balanced.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "I've just received news that a war has broken out at the Flickering
        World's frontline, and the World Tree Army has launched another attack.
        At this juncture, it's very likely to be a double-layered tactic of the
        enemy, so the enemy can appear at any time. Everyone, focus!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In the main ship, the commander spoke in the military channel.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The dynasty soldiers of the various fleets were extremely focused and
        did not dare to be distracted.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After waiting for a while, the fleet commander suddenly received the
        order from the other troops. His eyes narrowed, and he said with a deep
        voice, "The World Tree Army has already attacked. Thirty-four war zones
        have been invaded, and the other garrison troops are exchanging fire.
        The enemy will be here soon…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As soon as he said that, the space wall suddenly opened up with jump
        points like beehives. The World Tree's Blessed Races swarmed out like a
        green flood.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Attack!"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">The fleet commander roared.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Bang! Bang! Bang!</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The next moment, countless beams of energy lit up in the battlefield and
        formed a dense net, shattering a large group of battleships.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The two troops were fearless. It was as if they had turned into two
        giant beasts, one black and one green. They started to bite each other
        ferociously, not caring about their own injuries. They only cared about
        ripping off the flesh of the other party.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The same thing was happening in hundreds of shallow layer dimensions.
        War had broken out!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The warfare mode of the secondary dimensions was different from that of
        the main universe. Every war zone was a divided battlefield. With the
        help of the special ‘geographical' structure, countless fleets fought as
        they traveled through the various secondary dimensions while carrying
        out operations like restraining, pulling, encircling, and counter
        encirclement. The situation changed rapidly, and the flames of war
        engulfed countless small worlds. The secondary dimensions were blasted
        into smithereens, and their remains were devoured by the space storms.
        The high-level combatants of both sides also started to fight each
        other, and the battlefield changed from one dimension to another.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In a shallow layer dimension war zone riddled with holes, a
        transportation door hung high up in the sky, spitting out a few injured
        Beyond Grade As from the three Universal Civilizations. Not far away, a
        green transportation door opened, and more Holy Tree Emissaries chased
        after them.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The few Beyond Grade As did not have time to recuperate and quickly
        turned around to fight. They were once again at a disadvantage, and the
        situation became worse. "Don't even think about leaving the secondary
        dimension world alive!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Holy Tree Emissaries were filled with killing intent, and their
        attacks were ferocious. Their eyes were even flashing with joy.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In the past, when they fought with the Beyond Grade As of the three
        Universal Civilizations, due to the existence of the Healing Esper, all
        the high-level combatants of the enemy were like a death squad, making
        them feel extremely miserable. They could not even feel the joy of the
        World Tree's infinite revival.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, it was different now. In the secondary dimension battlefield,
        due to the special battlefield structure, the Healing Esper would be
        greatly restricted and would not be able to take care of every
        battlefield… Furthermore, the Healing Esper did not even have the time
        to come over. The troops in the main universe launched an attack,
        dragging many enemy high-level combatants to the frontlines, including
        the Healing Esper.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Now that they saw the enemy being restrained again, the Holy Tree
        Emissaries were finally overjoyed.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Austin was among the Beyond Grade As that were surrounded. Half of his
        magic treasures had been destroyed, and he was struggling to resist the
        attacks.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "The situation isn't looking good. Without reinforcements, we will
        definitely suffer losses."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Even with the Sanctum Revival, most people did not wish for themselves
        to end up in such a state. There was only one Aurora, and everyone
        wanted to stay on the front line and fight alongside the milkmaid.
        Therefore, there were very few high-level combatants who were willing to
        rush to reinforce the troops in the shallow layer dimensions. Other than
        the direct descendants, none of the others were willing. They were all
        ordered to come and help, and there was a huge difference in numbers
        with the enemy. The situation did not look good.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        By the side, Beiger was fighting with a high-level Holy Tree Emissary,
        and they were locked in an intense battle. He whispered, "Don't panic,
        we still have reinforcements."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"What reinforcements?" Austin frowned.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At this moment, the space wall in the distance of the battlefield
        suddenly opened up, and an unmarked fleet charged into the battlefield,
        firing densely packed sharp missiles at the World Tree Blessed Races,
        which exploded on the shields.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The next moment, the area where the missiles exploded turned into
        chaotic space. A batch of World Tree Blessed Race members was sucked
        into it and disappeared without a trace. "This is…" Austin's pupils
        constricted. "The Holy Accord's Dimensional Exile Bullet," Beiger
        continued. "Holy Accord? What is…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Before Austin could ask further, waves of Beyond Grade A energy soared
        into the sky.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Boom!</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        A few unfamiliar Beyond Grade As flew out from this mysterious fleet,
        quickly closing in on the Holy Tree Emissaries.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Austin felt the pressure lessen, and he quickly backed away. He looked
        at the battle and was shocked.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "These are the reinforcements you mentioned? Who are they?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Don't you find them familiar?" Beiger raised an eyebrow.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Austin looked over and immediately recognized a few people. They were
        all famous Primordial Ones in history.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Thinking about Beiger's identity, he suddenly realized something.
        "They're Revivors like you? I thought Black Star did not revive them.
        When did this happen ?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "You will know the details later. Now is not the time to talk about it."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Beiger did not explain further and dodged the enemy's counterattack. A
        forbidden spell ray penetrated the enemy's chest.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Austin's heart skipped a beat. He looked at them deeply and did not ask
        any more questions.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Similar scenes were happening in many of the war zones. The dozens of
        revivors who had been hidden in the Holy Accord for many years finally
        joined the battle for the first time, helping the Beyond Grade As and
        quickly stabilizing the situation of the high-level combatants.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Not only was the World Tree surprised by this wave of reinforcements,
        but even the three Universal Civilizations were confused. They could not
        figure out the origins of these reinforcements.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">At the same time.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The leaders of the three Universal Civilizations, who were monitoring
        the battle in the secondary dimension, all turned to look at Han Xiao,
        who was watching the battle together in the office. Their expressions
        were mixed with shock and complicated emotions.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Black Star… aren't you going to explain?'"</p>
    </div>

    <div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-1413">
      <h1 class="h" itemprop="headline">
        Chapter 1414: Ambush<span hidden="" class="calibre1"> | </span>
      </h1>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Without looking back, Han Xiao casually replied, "As you can see, these
        are all reinforcements that I've pulled over to fill the gap in our
        combat strength."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The church head knocked on the table with his knuckles and said with a
        deep voice, "Don't play dumb. I'm asking how they got here. When did you
        revive these people?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Hearing this, Han Xiao then turned around and glanced at the three of
        them.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Do you think all the revivors are willing to appear in public? I never
        said that the ones in the association are all the revivors there are. As
        for who exactly I revived, I have no obligation to tell others. Don't
        ask what you shouldn't ask."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">The three of them choked and looked at him deeply.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        They did not need to think too much to guess that this was Black Star's
        backup plan. There was probably a group of revivors hidden in the dark,
        which was most likely arranged during the confrontation back then as a
        trump card against the three Universal Civilizations. If they had
        decided to carry out the purge back then, the result would have been
        hard to determine. Now that Han Xiao had just revealed this trump card,
        the three of them were shocked.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, after knowing him for so many years, the three of them had a
        deep understanding of Black Star's unfathomable habits. They were
        already used to Black Star setting up spies everywhere. Perhaps this
        group of revivors that had suddenly appeared was just the tip of the
        iceberg of his hidden force…
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">The three of them looked away with heavy hearts.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This was not the time to be bothered about such things, the three of
        them were still more respectful toward Han Xiao.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Now that Black Star was on the same level as them, the three of them saw
        that he did not want to explain and so they did not continue asking.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Furthermore, compared to the importance of Black Star himself, having
        another batch of revivors did not seem like a big deal. With Han Xiao,
        who was a Transcendent, the impact these hidden revivors had on the
        three of them was limited.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Of course, Han Xiao would not take the initiative to explain the origin
        of the Holy Accord. Looking at the three of them, he could not help but
        smile.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Back then, he had hidden the strength of the Holy Accord organization to
        leave a path of retreat for the association, allowing the Beyond Grade
        As to be divided into two parts &mdash;the open and the dark.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He had originally planned to reveal the tip of the iceberg of the Holy
        Accord at the right time and make the three Universal Civilizations
        wary. However, his plans could not keep up with the changes. Now that he
        had stepped into the Transcendent Grade, the deterrence of a single
        person was comparable to the entire Beyond Grade A group. The Holy
        Accord Revivors trump card was not as important as before. However, it
        was still useful. It was not a bad thing to make the three Universal
        Civilizations warier.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao paid attention to the battle once again. After watching for a
        while, he suddenly locked onto the Secret Tree King and Clotti who were
        fighting on the surveillance screen. "My prey has appeared. Excuse me."
        The remote projection disappeared.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Only at this moment did the three Universal Civilizations' leaders
        relax. They looked at each other and saw the fear in each other's eyes.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In a certain war zone in the shallow layer dimension battlefield.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Bang!</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The rainbow-like magic light penetrated the surging dark energy and
        landed on Clotti's body, leaving a new wound. The powerful annihilation
        force sent him flying, crashing into the dark brown ground and smashing
        through hundreds of layers.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Cough cough…"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The cells in his body withered under the influence of the Annihilation
        spell. Clotti quickly used his energy to stabilize his injuries before
        looking up at the enemy in the sky with a grave expression.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Secret Tree King was floating in the air, looking down at him from
        above. Forbidden Spells were brewing around him, rapidly taking shape
        and falling like a storm.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Clotti gritted his teeth to suppress his injuries and manipulated the
        dark energy to meet the attack. However, the stalemate only lasted for
        an instant before he was sent flying once again, with many new wounds on
        his body.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"This Tree King… is too strong…"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Clotti clutched his wound, his eyes shining with shock.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He had judged the strength of the Tree King from the Subduing Tree King,
        the Heart Tree King, and the Lord's Avatar of the Fortitude Tree King.
        He had thought that even if he could not defeat this new Tree King, he
        would at least be able to hold on for a long time. However, Clotti did
        not expect that this guy who called himself the Secret Tree King was
        stronger than the other three. He was the National Pillar, but the other
        party beat him like beating a younger brother. It was easy and relaxed.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Among all the opponents that he had fought, only Black Star and Wuornos
        could deal with him so easily.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        If the other Beyond Grade A Mages were just ordinary magic cannons, then
        this Secret Tree King was a rapid nuclear bomb. The strength, frequency,
        and speed of his casting far exceeded all the Mages that Clotti had ever
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">seen!</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In the sky, the Secret Tree King temporarily stopped attacking. He moved
        his fingers and casually played with a ribbon made of magic power.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "You actually dared to fight me one on one. Should I say that your
        courage is commendable, or you are overestimating yourself?
        Unfortunately, only that Mechanic or that Esper has the qualifications
        to fight me. Your strength is a little too weak. If this continues, I
        won't have any interest in killing
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">you…"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The only opponents that the Secret Tree King cared about were Han Xiao
        and EsGod. Although Clotti's combat strength was not low, and his dark
        energy control Esper Ability was rather penetrative, it was not much of
        a threat to him, a Mage who grasped multidimensional energy. Feeling the
        other party's contempt, Clotti's face darkened. He silently gathered his
        energy and prepared to go all out.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, right at this moment, a spatial fluctuation appeared in their
        senses. The space wall in the distance opened up, and a figure covered
        in a hooded black robe appeared. His clothes fluttered in the wind, and
        the edges of his clothes were like black flames. He was brimming with
        the aura of a peak Beyond Grade A, attracting their attention.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Who are you?" Clotti turned around. He did not know if he was friend or
        foe, but he immediately became more alert.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"We're on the same side."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Oathkeeper glanced at him before staring at the Secret Tree King.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Another one?" The Secret Tree King narrowed his eyes. "You're in
        cahoots with those new reinforcements, right? You should be their
        leader. Interesting, you still have a group of high-level combatants
        hidden… Heh, so what? You can't turn the situation around. Sooner or
        later, we'll wipe out all your forces in the secondary dimension world!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Through the mental network, he had already found out about the Holy
        Accord Revivors reinforcing the three Universal Civilizations' Beyond
        Grade As.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In the eyes of the Secret Tree King, facing an opponent like the World
        Tree, the three Universal Civilizations should have felt immense
        pressure and gone all out long ago. However, the other party was still
        holding back even now. It was truly unfathomable.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Furthermore, with the Secret Tree King's personality, he was a little
        unhappy about this… Why, is our World Tree not worthy of your full
        strength ?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Ignoring the Secret Tree King, Oathkeeper communicated with Clotti
        telepathically.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Leave this to me. Go help the others."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Can you do it? This Tree King is very strong. We'd better work together
        to deal with him." Clotti expressed his doubts. "This Tree King is a
        Mage, and I can see that his spells have bonuses in the secondary
        dimension world. I should not be his match, but I only need to stall
        him. In this aspect, I'm more suitable than you. There's no need to
        waste combat power on him."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Oathkeeper responded.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Not long ago, the expeditionary army outposts had been attacked, and Han
        Xiao had finally informed the Holy Accord Organization to take part in
        the battle. Many of the Holy Accord Revivors had already prepared
        themselves mentally. They did not need any mobilization and set off on
        their own. On one hand, it was for the sake of the Sanctum Revival
        qualifications, and on the other hand, it was also because they were in
        the same boat.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Other than that, Han Xiao also requested the Holy Accord to bring along
        Dimensional Exile Bullets, High-Level Lifeform Energy Disorder
        Shockwave, cross-dimensional detection radars, and other special
        technologies to provide support. Oathkeeper had no choice but to do as
        he was told. As the Holy Accord organization's troops had always been on
        standby, they quickly came over.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Clotti did not respond, but at this moment, the Secret Tree King
        suddenly attacked. All kinds of powerful forbidden spells were cast
        continuously, firing at the two of them.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Bang! Bang! Bang! Magical lights flashed in the sky, beautiful and
        deadly. Oathkeeper and Clotti immediately reacted and moved around,
        dodging nonstop.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        On the other side, the Secret Tree King was multitasking. While quickly
        constructing spell models and casting forbidden spells, he communicated
        with the Ancestral Tree King through the mental network.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "There's no sign of that Mechanic in the frontline battlefield or the
        secondary dimension battlefield. He has that sealing ability, so there's
        a high chance that he's targeting a tree king. Therefore, his target
        should be me. Maybe he's secretly observing. After I fight these two
        opponents for a while, he should jump out and ambush me."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Hearing this, the Ancestral Tree King expressed his approval in the
        mental network and said with a deep voice, "Your judgment is very
        reasonable. Continue fighting. As long as that Mechanic is lured out, I
        will immediately descend and catch him off guard."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Okay."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The two of them quickly came up with a plan. They planned to use the
        Secret Tree King as bait to lure the snake out of its hole.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The mantis stalks the cicada, unaware of the oriole behind. Since it was
        very likely that Black Star had his eyes on the Secret Tree King, the
        Ancestral Tree King also chose to launch an ambush. He had two goals.
        One was to find an opportunity to kill Black Star, and the other was to
        think of a way to save the Heart Tree King. If he did not deal with
        Black Star, how could he talk about unsealing the Heart Tree King? At
        the very least, he had to snatch that Universal Treasure with the
        sealing ability.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        It was not that he thought too highly of the Heart Tree King. Even the
        simple-minded Subduing Tree King had ‘decisively' self-destructed twice
        to escape from being sealed. Only the Heart Tree King had been affected.
        The Ancestral Tree King only wanted to take back the sealed Tree King
        Crown. Otherwise, there would always be a gap in the five Tree Kings.
        With Oathkeeper joining the battle, the two of them were finally at a
        stalemate with the Secret Tree King. The three of them fought intensely,
        chasing each other non-stop. The battlefield changed again and again.
        One moment, it was an abyss-like blackish-purple space, then it was a
        holy land-like silver kingdom, then it was a nascent dimension born in
        the void, and the next moment, it was an unstable secondary dimension at
        its end. Without exception, every battlefield was shattered by the
        aftershock of their battle, and batches of fleets were devoured by the
        space storm.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The three of them arrived at a shadow dimension. Suddenly, the space
        wall in the distance opened, and another figure entered the battlefield.
        It was Han Xiao.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Secret Tree King noticed Han Xiao at first glance and immediately
        ignored the other two opponents. He stared at Han Xiao with a strong
        battle intent and killing intent in his eyes.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"You're finally willing to come out ?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao glanced at him, waved his hand, told Oathkeeper and Clotti to
        stop and retreat to the side, then spoke to the Secret Tree King in the
        public channel.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "There are three of us here. Aren't you going to run?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Run? Who do you think I am ?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Secret Tree King suddenly waved his palm, and an invisible spatial
        fluctuation swept across this space. The entire secondary dimension
        instantly turned into a mirror-like space, as though it was trapped in a
        crystal. The images of the battlefield were flowing in the sections of
        the space, overlapping and dazzling. The spatial barrier suddenly
        formed, isolating Clotti and Oathkeeper in the outside world. They could
        only see what was going on inside the barrier, but they could not
        participate in it. It was as if the two of them were in parallel spaces
        that had no intersection.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Inside the barrier, only the Secret Tree King and Han Xiao were looking
        at each other. "You want to fight me one on one?" Han Xiao looked around
        at the barrier and smiled strangely.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "I've always wanted to fight you, so why would I run? I thought you
        would launch a sneak attack, but I didn't expect you to appear so
        openly… However, this doesn't matter. This barrier is our battleground.
        If you have the ability, don't use that teleportation technique to
        escape. I'll definitely kill you today!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The eyes of the Secret Tree King flickered. He knew that Black Star had
        the teleportation technique that could ignore crowd control, so this
        barrier was only to prevent the other enemies from disrupting the battle
        and create the illusion of a one-on-one battle. As long as Black Star
        did not teleport away and stayed behind to fight him one-on-one, the
        plan would be half complete.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He did not hesitate and immediately cast all kinds of spells toward Han
        Xiao. On the surface, it seemed like he was going to fight Han Xiao one
        on one, but he had already secretly used spells to guide the Ancestral
        Tree King into the barrier, preparing to launch a pincer attack.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, before the spell could hit its target, a powerful pressure
        swept out like a storm with Han Xiao at the center, shaking the Secret
        Tree King's mind! Boom!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Countless machines surged out from the Godly Stronghold and instantly
        condensed on Han Xiao's body. They combined into a gigantic Mechanical
        Divine Body, which was the Supreme Heavenly Venerate. Transcendent
        Grade's energy fluctuations erupted without restraint!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The face of the Secret Tree King instantly changed, and the ferocity on
        his face turned into fear and disbelief. "This is the level of the Tree
        God ?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">He was not mentally prepared at all.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At this moment, all tactics and plans were thrown to the back of his
        mind.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Secret Tree King did not hesitate to construct a transportation door
        and escape. He was no longer arrogant and only panic remained in his
        mind.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, Han Xiao was faster than him. With a flash, his gigantic body
        teleported behind the Secret Tree King and tore the roots of the World
        Tree apart. Then, the Emperor Skysplitter Blade slashed down and
        invisible psionic energy waves exploded like a blade wave.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Crack!</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The sound of a mirror shattering could be heard. Within the range of the
        psionic wave, the space barrier, various forbidden spells,
        transportation door, and everything else that was constructed by magic
        power rapidly collapsed like a sandcastle!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">There was not the slightest bit of resistance!</p>
      <p class="calibre3">"What?!"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Ancestral Tree King, who had just teleported behind Han Xiao and was
        about to launch a sneak attack, froze on the spot. His expression
        changed drastically!
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-1414">

      </h1>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Emperor Skysplitter Blade and the psionic wave launcher had already
        been enhanced by Han Xiao's (Beyonder Artifact] to become a ‘Divine
        Artifact'. With just a simple press of the A button, its power was no
        different from a destructive ultimate move!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        (TL Note: The author is probably expressing the huge damage caused by a
        normal attack, hence describing it as the press of an A button like a
        normal attack on a console.]
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Facing the Secret Tree King's terrified gaze, the Emperor Sky Splitter
        stabbed forward. The huge blade expanded rapidly in his eyes, and he
        could not react in time.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Boom!</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The huge blade slammed into the dimensional wall of the secondary
        dimension, creating countless cracks like cracking porcelain. The power
        of the attack was transmitted to the entire secondary dimension,
        exceeding the upper limit. The entire shadow dimension exploded, and all
        the darkness dissipated.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, the Secret Tree King was not sent flying. Instead, it was
        firmly stuck to the tip of the blade by an intense gravitational force
        field. At the same time, the Supreme Heavenly Venerate extended a finger
        and pressed it against the Secret Tree King's body. The invisible power
        of the Spacetime Amber passed through his finger and began to make amber
        on the Secret Tree King's body. The soul link of the Spacetime Amber had
        already reached the highest fifth level in the past decade. There was no
        need to touch the target with the original body of the Spacetime Amber,
        only physical contact was needed to activate the seal. This meant that
        the Spacetime Amber no longer needed to be carried around, and it could
        be placed anywhere.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At the same time, due to the [Energy BaseGod of All Machines] talent of
        the Super God Mechanic, the form of his basic existence was not limited
        to his physical body. The Mechanical Deity that he had fused with was
        also his main body. This meant that he could use the Mechanical Deity's
        body to touch the target, which would also satisfy the judgment of the
        Spacetime Amber!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Secret Tree King was rooted to the ground by a bunch of Universal
        Treasure-level control devices. The extremely destructive psionic energy
        waves flowed along the blade and entered his body, crushing large
        amounts of his cells. The energy in his body was suppressed by the Super
        God-level energy, and he could not even self-destruct. Furthermore, he
        did not dare to self-destruct in front of a Super God. That was truly
        ‘courting death'.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Black Star was too fast, exceeding the Beyond Grade A realm. He could
        not react much at all, as if he had fallen into such a state the moment
        he came back to his senses.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "How can someone break through this limit? This kind of power cannot be
        controlled by an individual!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">The Secret Tree King panicked, his face pale.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He did not expect a Tree God to appear in this civilization. How could
        there be such a huge change in just ten years?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The World Tree had been growing for countless years. Other than the
        Ancestral Tree King, the other four Kings had all changed positions
        before. Although the Ancestral Tree King had the authority to remove the
        other Kings, he rarely used them. Generally speaking, unless the Tree
        King was dead, he would not do any personnel changes.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, the Tree Kings could revive, so why would they still die? This
        was the problem. Some of the Tree Kings had tried to reach a higher
        level, but all of them died without exception. They thought that they
        could revive through the World Tree, but after suffering from mutations
        and dying during the Promotion, the information form would directly
        leave the connection of the World Tree, unable to revive and be
        completely dead. After failing time and time again, they learned from
        the previous mistakes, and the later generations of Tree Kings did not
        try to advance anymore.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In their eyes, the Transcendent Domain was an insurmountable chasm that
        could not be crossed by an individual. It was the limit of a single life
        form. Only by using a different method could one temporarily step into a
        higher level. The Tree God advent was one of the methods.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This kind of thinking was not strange. Having a powerful Superpower
        system did not mean that one could become stronger indefinitely.
        Although many civilizations liked to confuse the differences between the
        two, these were two different concepts. Be it the World Tree experts or
        the Beyond Grade As of the three Universal Civilizations, they all were
        similar in that they recognized the existence of an individual limit…
        The difference lay in how both parties had determined the limits of
        their individual strength. Because up till now, no one had truly reached
        the absolute limit, thus there appeared many different boundaries of
        strength.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"I have to break free from his control, or else…"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Secret Tree King made up his mind and activated his cell reactor
        crazily. Ignoring the damage to his cells, he squeezed out all his magic
        power and attacked the energy lock. After struggling without caring
        about the consequences, the control field finally loosened.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"There's still a chance to escape!"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Secret Tree King was overjoyed. Just as he was about to accumulate
        his strength to burst out and break through Han Xiao's control, the
        power of the Tree King in his body suddenly leaked out like a flood and
        was sucked away by an invisible force. His body suddenly sagged, and his
        accumulation of strength was interrupted. A sense of weakness spread
        throughout his body.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"My Tree King Crown!"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He suddenly raised his eyes and looked in the direction of the Ancestral
        Tree King.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Ancestral Tree King's figure was already covered by a rapidly
        expanding ball of green light. It was like a gigantic egg, and a
        gigantic figure could be vaguely seen within. The energy fluctuations
        from within were rising rapidly.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        How could the Secret Tree King not recognize this scene? The Ancestral
        Tree King had already activated the descent of the Tree God and
        instantly retracted his Tree King Crown as well as his strength. It was
        obvious that he had abandoned him to reduce the overall losses on their
        side. Not only did he not plan to save him, but he had even destroyed
        his hope of escaping! "No!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">The Secret Tree King's eyes widened in shock.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao noticed the change in the Ancestral Tree King and looked back.
        He then looked down at the Secret Tree King and said in a joking manner.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "We agreed to spend some alone time together. I didn't expect you to
        secretly make it into a threesome… Alright, go to sleep. I'll play with
        him first."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As soon as he said that, he suddenly moved his finger, and the Spacetime
        Amber took shape!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Deng! The terror on the Secret Tree King's face froze as if he could not
        believe that he was taken down so easily. His entire body was frozen in
        amber.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Success!"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Han Xiao's eyes sparkled.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Secret Tree King was extremely strong among the Beyond Grade As, but
        he could not do much damage to him. Although it was a sudden attack, it
        was mainly because of the huge difference in strength that the Secret
        Tree King did not have the time to use all sorts of methods before being
        defeated.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Compared to the various schemes he had used to seal the Heart Tree King
        before, sealing an even stronger Secret Tree King this time was much
        easier. His strength had exceeded an entire realm, and although it was
        not as simple as a Beyond Grade A fighting a Calamity Grade Super, it
        was still a crushing victory.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The next moment, a channel opened up on the fingertips of the mechanical
        finger, swallowing the ambered Secret Tree King.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After doing this, Han Xiao turned around and faced the rapidly expanding
        green light belonging to the Ancestral Tree King. Seeing this, Han
        Xiao's eyes sparkled. He could roughly guess why the Secret Tree King
        had fled so decisively and was so afraid of him.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "So that's how it is. The World Tree also has the power of a Beyond God.
        The reason why the Secret Tree King has no fighting spirit is that he
        has seen this power before… Maybe the Transcendent Grade of the World
        Tree has already unlocked the ability to kill using the information form
        state. Therefore, in his opinion, whether he self-destructs or not, I
        can directly attack him in the information state and kill him
        completely, since I can break the mechanism of the World Tree and strip
        him of his immortality. That's why the Secret Tree King is so afraid of
        me…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Han Xiao immediately became alert.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "If that's the case, doesn't that mean that the Transcendent Grade of
        the World Tree can also threaten me?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Without another word, he opened fire at the green light. He had no habit
        of waiting for others to transform.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Right at this moment, the green light suddenly exploded, and a gigantic
        tree palm extended out from the light. Green light gushed out from the
        palm and turned into a barrier, blocking the torrential attacks of the
        mechanical army.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The figure of the Ancestral Tree King had already disappeared, and in
        its place was a gigantic treant. His entire body was glowing with green
        light, and countless World Tree Roots were wrapped around his body like
        woven vine armor. On every part of his body, many small roots grew out
        like dancing little snakes, tearing open space cracks one after another
        and absorbing the matter and energy on the other side of the tunnel.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"What f*ckery is this?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao glanced at the interface. The other party's name was (Tree God
        (Incomplete)], and a large amount of information was filled with
        question marks. It was clear that its level was higher than his, and it
        was also at the Transcendent Grade.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Interesting, the World Tree still has such a method hidden. Why have
        they never used it before…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Han Xiao frowned, pondering in suspicion.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In the war in his previous life, the World Tree had never used this
        method. Logically speaking, since their nest had been destroyed, they
        should have used all their trump cards to stop the enemy. However, even
        when the three Universal Civilizations blew up the World Tree's main
        body, the Tree God never descended.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He originally thought that the World Tree did not have the strength of a
        Transcendent, but it seemed like that was not the case. There were
        definitely secrets that he did not understand.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At this moment, a mental signal came from the Tree God. There was no
        clear content, only messy thoughts and intense hunger, much like a wild
        beast.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Are you trying to eat me?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao could sense the meaning behind Tree God's words, and his heart
        skipped a beat.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        It seemed like the mind of this Tree God was very chaotic, and he did
        not have a rational leader controlling it?!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Before he could observe any longer, the Tree God pounced on him and
        started entangling with the Supreme Heavenly Venerate.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Countless roots of the World Tree shot out, glowing with a green light
        as they smashed toward Han Xiao's body. They were continuously cut by
        the Emperor Skysplitter Blade, but new ones quickly grew out.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        One was a machine, and the other was a tree. Two huge objects were
        brawling it out in the space storm. Dozens of Mechanical Oracles led
        their troops and fired at the Tree God. Every moment, countless attacks
        landed on the Tree God. However, its health seemed to have no limit. Not
        only did the body formed by the World Tree Root have high resistance,
        but it also possessed extraordinary regenerative power.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Oathkeeper and Clotti had already moved far away. The aftershock of the
        battle between the two Transcendents was too terrifying, and they had no
        room to interfere. They could only follow behind and watch from afar.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "I didn't expect the World Tree to also have the combat power of a
        Transcendent Grade, to be able to fight Black Star head-on. If they had
        used it earlier…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Clotti's eyes widened in shock.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Can't you tell? This Beyond God level combatant doesn't seem to be an
        individual. The World Tree Civilization must have paid some price to
        create a Transcendent Grade level combatant." Oathkeeper shook his head
        and analyzed calmly. "Furthermore, he and Black Star aren't evenly
        matched. Look, he's already at a disadvantage."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Due to the incomplete Tree King Crowns, the Tree God advent this time
        was not complete, and its combat capability was not at its peak. After
        fighting for a while, the Tree God gradually fell into a disadvantage
        under Han Xiao's fierce attacks. It could only rely on its strong
        physical strength to resist the attacks, and the number of times it
        attacked decreased.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao also felt the weakness of the Tree God, and he started to
        analyze.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Although he is at the Transcendent Grade, his combat power seems to be
        lacking. It should be because of that ‘incomplete' title. This is not
        the complete form of the Tree God yet… Could I have been involved in
        this?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao's thoughts raced. Although he did not know the conditions for
        the Tree God's Advent, when he thought about how one of his requirements
        was to find Supers from the other four classes as helpers when he
        advanced to the Transcendent Grade, he had a vague guess.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The composition of the five Tree Kings is similar to the requirement to
        advance to the Transcendent Grade. Could this be the birth condition of
        the Tree God? If that's the case, I've sealed the Heart Tree King and
        the Secret Tree King, so the complete version of the Tree God cannot be
        activated?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The more Han Xiao thought about it, the more likely it seemed.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Does this mean that I accidentally weakened the other party's trump
        card?!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Amazing! Let's see who dares to say that I'm unlucky in the future. I
        might be usually unlucky, but I've never failed at a critical moment!

      </h1>
      <p class="calibre3">Boom!</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The battle between the two Transcendents became more and more intense.
        The battlefield was moving rapidly in the spatial storm as if it had
        split into two clusters of light, one black, and one green. They were
        entangled with each other and were crazily eroding each other's space.
        The sound of the energy shockwave was constantly heard, and it burst out
        with strong light one after another. It was like Armageddon, or the
        birth of the world.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Countless mechanical soldiers flew out from Han Xiao's Godly Stronghold.
        From afar, they looked like black smoke released by the Supreme Heavenly
        Venerate, turning into thousands of streams. Some were like whips,
        constantly clashing with the World Tree Roots, while others released
        billions of rays of light, bombarding the various parts of the Tree God.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Among them, there were dozens of specks of light, the size of dust,
        jumping around the Tree God's body, tearing off roots one after another.
        These were the many Mechanical Oracles under Han Xiao. They all had
        different abilities, and under the enhancement of Mechanical Force, they
        had strength that far exceeded normal soldiers. They were all elite
        units.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Under the continuous accumulation of mechanical soldiers, the body of
        the Supreme Heavenly Venerate seemed to grow endlessly. On the other
        side, the speed at which the World Tree Roots was forming on the Tree
        God also became faster and faster. Under the layers of binding, its body
        also grew rapidly, and the two huge objects grew at a similar speed.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Tsk, so big…"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Oathkeeper and Clotti looked at the two of them in shock.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The shockwaves of the battle between the two Transcendents became more
        and more intense. In order not to be implicated, the two of them had
        already retreated further away. However, Han Xiao and the Tree God's
        bodies still occupied their entire field of vision, and they could not
        even see the entirety of the battle. It was as if they had no end.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At Oathkeeper and Clotti's level, they naturally did not have
        megalophobia. However, at this moment, as they looked at the two
        gigantic creatures exuding a terrifying pressure with every movement,
        they could not help but feel an instinctive fear in their hearts. It was
        an indescribable fear that existed beyond their range of understanding!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        A strong sense of danger surrounded the two of them. The more they
        looked, the more unstable the energy in their bodies became. Their
        hearts felt like they were going to jump out of their throats. It was as
        if they were bursting with the full strength of a Transcendent. It was a
        scene they could not look at directly!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Unknowingly, waves of terror assaulted their brains, making them want to
        look away. However, their eyes seemed to have separated from their
        bodies and were no longer under their control. Their gazes were fixed on
        the two Transcendents.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Swoosh!</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At this time, the Emperor Skysplitter Blade burning with dark blue
        psionic energy tore apart a large area of the space storm and stabbed
        into the Tree God's body. However, the roots in the Tree God's body
        quickly tied up and sewed the wound like needles. At the same time, tiny
        roots that looked like meat sprouts grew out from the wound and
        intertwined with each other, healing the wound in the blink of an eye.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In addition, a portion of the psionic energy covered by the blade was
        absorbed by the Tree God. It also had the devouring ability of the World
        Tree, so it did not reject any energy.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At the same time, the slashes left by the Emperor Skysplitter Blade in
        the spatial storm spread rapidly, turning into a spatial rift that tore
        open a passage to a secondary dimension. However, not only did the two
        of them not get pulled in by the attraction force of the secondary
        dimension, the anti-gravity force on their bodies pulled this secondary
        dimension out instead. The internal matter gushed out along the space
        crack and sprayed onto the two of them.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This scene was like a fruit that had a hole in its skin. It was being
        held tightly, squeezing out all the juice and flesh from the hole, and
        turned into a mess.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Swoosh</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Every slash of Han Xiao's blade tore open a spatial rift that led to
        different secondary dimensions. Very soon, many colorful spatial tunnels
        appeared on the battlefield. Countless secondary dimensions sprayed out
        streams of matter, and all kinds of strange things were scattered all
        over the sky. There were also all kinds of strange creatures that were
        crushed into powder by the shockwaves and fused into the energy storm
        that the two of them were fighting in.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Looking at the interior of these spatial tunnels, one could see that
        these secondary dimensions were rapidly drying up, as though their
        bodies had been hollowed out. Such a battle had already exceeded the
        capabilities of a Beyond Grade A. Although the aftermath of their battle
        could shatter the secondary dimensions, Beyond Grade As were the ones
        absorbed by the secondary dimensions, destroying the secondary
        dimensions from the inside. However, the Transcendents could use their
        own gravitational force to stop the secondary dimensions from absorbing
        them, and even pull out the ‘intestines' of the secondary dimensions.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Tree God had been resisting Han Xiao's attacks all along. As its
        roots moved, the almost endless power of the World Tree was released. It
        was like a green wave, attacking and defending at the same time. It had
        countless uses and dyed the area with a faint green light.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Ding!</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        With the Tree God as the center, a special spatial fluctuation was
        suddenly released. Immediately after, a layer of green world phantom
        seemed to overlap with the area, spreading out endless faint green
        light, quickly completing ‘taking root'. The next moment, Han Xiao
        suddenly felt a strong restraining force, and his strength was
        suppressed inexplicably. Not only did the Supreme Heavenly Venerate's
        movements slow down, but the strength of all the mechanical troops also
        decreased. The power of the Tree God increased instead, and it could
        teleport freely in this area. Its mobility immediately increased.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"It seems to be a dimension projection…"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After taking a look, Han Xiao recognized what this green world phantom
        was.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Transcendent Grade had already formed an inner space and inner universe
        in their body, and a second Void Dimension had been born in their body.
        The Tree God should also have an inner dimension within its body.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The scene in front of him should be to open up his inner space and
        summon a dimension projection, turning a certain area outside his body
        into an inner dimension environment to form his own domain. This would
        allow him to gain the home-ground advantage and increase his strength
        and suppress his opponent.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Furthermore, this domain moved along with him, and even if the
        battlefield was constantly shifting, it would not be affected. With a
        thought, Han Xiao activated the Void Dimension consciousness in his body
        and summoned an inner space projection. A gray domain with blue electric
        arcs instantly opened up and squeezed out the green domain of the Tree
        God.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The debuffs brought by the Tree God Domain disappeared immediately. Not
        only did Han Xiao return to normal, but he also felt the huge buffs
        brought by the domain. Furthermore, the domain around his body moved
        according to his will, like a new sense organ.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In the space storm, the grayish-blue and green colors corroded each
        other, and the Void Domain and the Tree God Domain were separated.
        Before Han Xiao could even savor the sensation, he felt the pressure of
        the domain, and he could not help but increase his
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">energy.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Buzz!</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Void Domain immediately expanded outward, compressing the Tree God
        Domain to a smaller size. At the same time, Han Xiao keenly noticed that
        the enhancement of his Domain had become stronger, while the Tree God
        Domain had become weaker.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Fighting by projecting the inner space? So this is the normal style of
        a Transcendent Grade battle…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Han Xiao was overjoyed.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In the past few years, he had been exploring the strength of the
        Transcendent Grade. Although he had gained some benefits, he did not
        have any opponents of the same level, nor did he have anyone to learn
        from. Although the current Tree God was not complete, it was still quite
        familiar with the usage of the Transcendent's methods. It was enough to
        give him quite a lot of inspiration and imitate the other party's
        techniques.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Just fighting with a Transcendent brought him a lot of benefits.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao activated Virtual Creation, and the various materials in the
        Godly Stronghold were consumed rapidly. In the blink of an eye, a
        super-large cannon appeared behind him. Its caliber was almost the size
        of a small planet, and its barrel was as deep as an abyss.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This type of giant cannon was already considered an interstellar mega
        machinery, and it would take quite some time to build. However, it could
        be built in an instant with (Virtual Creation (Pseudo)]. The efficiency
        was multiplied countless times.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In Han Xiao's opinion, the biggest feature of this ability in a battle
        was to adapt to the situation and create different devices that he
        needed on the spot even if he had made no preparations.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        No matter how strong a foundation a Mechanic had, they would not dare to
        say that their resources would be able to adapt to all situations. For
        example, he would not have the time to build a live ammunition cannon of
        this size. Now, he realized that the Tree God's resistance to energy was
        a little abnormal. Now that he had a requirement, he could directly use
        Virtual Creation to create it, which was convenient and fast… Other than
        not returning the materials after it disappeared, there were no other
        shortcomings.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Buzz</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Surging energy accumulated in the cannon barrel, and a bright light
        flashed. A planet-sized giant bullet shot out, carrying huge kinetic
        energy, and smashed into the Tree God's chest, deeply embedding inside.
        Large pieces of shattered roots flew everywhere.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The bright light almost blinded Oathkeeper and Clotti. The bullet
        exploded, instantly splitting the Tree God in half. Countless shrapnels
        of the bomb with magnetic force burst out, cutting the two parts of the
        Tree God into pieces.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao was about to give chase, but at this moment, the Tree God's
        body suddenly shrunk rapidly, turning from solid to illusory, fusing
        into a World Tree Root and disappearing
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "We were only halfway through the battle. Why did he run away?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao destroyed the root of the World Tree but did not sense the
        power of the Tree God. At the same time, the other party's domain also
        disappeared. He immediately understood. The Tree God Domain was also
        equivalent to the World Tree's ‘taking root' area, so it had a
        connection with the World Tree territory, which meant that the Tree God
        could teleport to any corner of his hometown instantly. In this aspect,
        it had the style of the King.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Not only is he tanky, but he can even run… Tsk, he must be imitating
        me!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao knew that he had beaten off the Tree God and shook his head.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The main reason was that the appearance of the Tree God was a little
        sudden for him, so he was not prepared. However, he had already
        completed his goal of sealing the Secret Tree King, and he had even
        accidentally exposed another trump card of the World Tree. He did not
        lose out.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Furthermore, with the Tree God's tankiness, he might not be able to kill
        this guy before he mastered a way to attack the Information Form.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Speaking of which, why did this Tree God not attack him at the
        Information Form layer just now? Are there any conditions to use it, or
        could it be that the incomplete version of the Tree God could not use
        this move?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Although this so-called Tree God doesn't seem to be my match, it seems
        to have the ability to destroy Information Form, so I need to deal with
        it carefully… Also, after this battle, my combat power has been exposed,
        and I don't know how the World Tree will react. I have to think about it
        carefully."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao pondered. He calmed himself down and opened the interface to
        take a look.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "However, I didn't expect to trigger a mission like this. I thought that
        the challenge mission would only go as high as a Beyond Grade A. After
        all, it's understandable to challenge Beyond Grade As. To let the
        players challenge Transcendents… So senseless? There's no chance of
        success at all. To think that such a mission would be triggered."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At this moment, Oathkeeper and Clotti finally relaxed. Their hands and
        feet were cold, and their hearts were still beating rapidly.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Although the battle had already ended, the terrifying pressure from the
        battle between the two Transcendents had already been deeply imprinted
        in their memories. It was like an ordinary person riding a small boat
        and being helpless in the storm. The indescribable terror that came from
        their instincts still lingered in their minds, leaving a deep impression
        that could not be erased.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "I didn't expect that even a Super at my level would be so afraid. The
        difference between the life levels is too huge. Is this the Transcendent
        Grade…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Oathkeeper wiped his non-existent cold sweat.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At this moment, he suddenly felt that being a follower seemed quite
        good…
      </p>

      </h1>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Since his Luck Glow guinea pigs were not around at the moment, it was
        not a good time to complete the mission. Han Xiao closed the interface
        and looked at Oathkeeper and Clotti.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Do you not have anything to do? Is the war over? Did the enemy
        retreat?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "No…" Oathkeeper and Clotti regained their senses and shook their heads.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Then what are you guys doing here? Aren't you going to deal with the
        enemy?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"I'll go now."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Oathkeeper immediately stepped into the spatial rift, searching for a
        shallow dimension battlefield to join.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Clotti looked at Han Xiao deeply before disappearing The three Universal
        Civilizations did not monitor the battle between the two Transcendent
        Grade Supers in the spatial storm, but he remembered everything. Be it
        Black Star's terrifying combat strength or the fact that the World Tree
        had a Transcendent Grade trump card, he had to report this important
        information to the upper echelons.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao did not retract his troops, only shrinking the body size of his
        Supreme Celestial Venerable. He tore open a spatial rift that led to a
        battlefield, before controlling the Mechanical Deity to walk in.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The battleships that filled the sky were shooting and killing each
        other. Their formations were interconnected, and the battle was intense.
        The three Universal Civilizations were in a dire situation, and they
        were being surrounded and destroyed.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        When the World Tree Blessed Race saw a Mechanical Deity covered in black
        clouds descend, they immediately changed the direction of their attacks
        and fired at it.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Supreme Heavenly Venerate however did not move at all. The
        mechanical soldiers that formed a black cloud beside him immediately
        split up and blocked in front of him. At the same time, they activated
        their shields, forming a gigantic psionic shield that protected the
        entire Supreme Heavenly Venerate. All of the fleet's firepower was
        blocked and the surface of the shield was covered in bright lights and
        ripples.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao raised the Emperor Skysplitter Blade and pointed it at this
        large World Tree fleet that covered the entire sky. He twisted his arm
        slightly and spun the blade in a semicircle. The next moment, an
        invisible psionic wave spread out from the tip of the sword and quickly
        engulfed most of the fleet.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The next moment, countless battleships exploded at the same time. Their
        shields shattered and disappeared, all of them malfunctioning and
        falling in different directions.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Wherever the psionic waves passed, battleships fell like raindrops!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As he was now, Han Xiao no longer needed to use the Human Wave Tactic to
        deal with a large number of troops. The Psionic Wave was a killing
        machine for group battles, and it was finally used on the official
        battlefield. The number of fleets was almost meaningless in front of
        this technology.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "This black technology is more useful than I expected. It was not in
        vain that I strengthened you into a Divine Artifact."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Looking at the spectacular sight of the spaceships falling from the sky,
        Han Xiao could not help but feel happy.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This time, he had revealed his strength to seal the Secret Tree King.
        There was no need for him to continue hiding, so he naturally chose to
        join the battle.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Lord, there are too many battlefields. Do you need us to attack?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Psionic Prime asked respectfully as he stood on the shoulder of the
        Supreme Heavenly Venerate with the rest of the Mechanical Oracles.
        "Bring your children to help." Han Xiao nodded.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As soon as he said that, the dozens of Mechanical Oracles immediately
        took action. They each brought a group of mechanical troops and headed
        to different shallow dimension battlefields to support the three
        Universal Civilizations.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        With the support of Han Xiao's Mechanical Force, the combat power of the
        mechanical army was extraordinary. With a huge leap, the mechanical army
        entered the battlefield one after another, giving the various World Tree
        Blessed Race members a huge blow.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao, on the other hand, controlled the Supreme Heavenly Venerate to
        move alone. The huge Mechanical Lifeform strolled through the
        battlefields one after another, waving the enormous double-bladed sword,
        the Emperor Skysplitter Blade, and constantly activating its AOE.
        Psionic waves slashed out like light blades, sweeping through the World
        Tree fleets.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After fighting for an unknown period of time, Han Xiao could not
        remember how many of the World Tree Blessed Race he had wiped out.
        Suddenly, the World Tree fleet stopped firing at the same time in the
        various shallow dimensions.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Their blitzkrieg had started with great momentum, and they wanted to end
        the battle quickly. However, they had now kicked on an iron plate.
        Seeing that the situation was not going to work, the Blessed Race
        finally gave up on this invasion and chose to retreat.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"We finally repelled the World Tree."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In the meeting room of the leader of the main universe, the three
        Universal Civilizations' leaders looked at the scene of the World Tree
        Army retreating and finally relaxed. "It was not easy for the World Tree
        to find an opportunity to open up the second frontline. They will not
        give up so easily. After resting for some time, they might make a
        comeback." Louis pondered.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Pope nodded and added with a worried tone, "The opening of the
        second battlefront is extremely disadvantageous for us. The secondary
        dimension battlefield is a meat grinder that is even more terrifying
        than the main universe's border. The main purpose of this battle is to
        fight head-on, and the losses will not be low. While their fleet can be
        constantly renewed, our losses are real. Although the Underworld can
        store the souls of most of the fallen warriors, Aurora's current energy
        level cannot take care of all the losses of our soldiers in the
        interstellar battlefield…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Marbruce clasped his hands together and suddenly said, "It's not a big
        problem. The enemy has an army, and we have Black Star."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Hearing this, the other two had complicated expressions. After receiving
        Clotti's report, they finally knew the true strength of a Transcendent.
        They had already tried their best to raise their expectations, but they
        had still underestimated Han Xiao's strength.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Sigh, the combat power of a Transcendent is truly astonishing. However,
        I didn't expect the World Tree to also have another Transcendent," the
        Pope said with surprise.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Luckily, Black Star has stepped into the same grade. Otherwise, no one
        on our side would be able to counter the World Tree's trump card. We
        would definitely suffer heavy casualties…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The three of them had mixed feelings and some lingering fear.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Transcendent Grade Black Star made them extremely afraid, but he
        also gave them a sense of security. If Black Star did not break through
        this limit, the galactic society would be at an absolute disadvantage in
        terms of individual strength. Once the Tree God descended, they would be
        easily defeated.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The current situation was barely stable, and at least half of it was due
        to Black Star's efforts. The contribution he had made was greater than
        all three of them combined. "However, after this battle, the World Tree
        should have been frightened by Black Star. The next time it wishes to
        attack the shallow dimensions, it will probably think twice before
        making such plans."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The three of them nodded and heaved a sigh of relief.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">World Tree Territory, Tree King Palace.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Green lights gathered on the throne and condensed into the bodies of the
        Ancestral Tree King and the Fortitude Tree King. Both of them had ugly
        expressions, not only because the Secret Tree King was sealed, but also
        because of the consequences of the Tree God's advent.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "The Secret Tree King is also gone… I didn't expect the Mechanic, who
        was still a peak Beyond Grade A ten years ago, to have stepped into the
        Transcendent Grade."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Ancestral Tree King rubbed his forehead, trying to alleviate the
        pain in his soul. He spoke with a hoarse voice that was filled with
        shock and anger.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The moment Black Star revealed his true strength and instantly captured
        the Secret Tree King, he was shocked. Knowing that the Secret Tree King
        probably could not be saved, he decisively gave up on the Secret Tree
        King and activated the Tree God's Advent without hesitation.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The arrival of the Tree God was like mixing the bodies and souls of the
        five Tree Kings together. It was extremely painful, as it forcibly
        formed a new consciousness between them, fusing with the will of the
        mother tree. The aftereffects were very severe. After disintegrating,
        the Tree Kings would have cognitive disorders from time to time, and
        their minds would be in a mess for a long time before recovering.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        If not for the fact that he had no other choice, the Ancestral Tree King
        would not have wanted to use it. It was not because he wanted to compete
        with Black Star, but because he was worried that if he did not summon
        the Tree God, he would not be able to escape from Black Star's hands,
        inevitably following in the footsteps of the Secret Tree King.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In addition, every time the Tree God descended, it would severely
        deplete the power of the Tree King Crown, causing the powers of each
        Tree King to decrease. It would take time for the Crown to recover. The
        time taken for the Tree King Crown to return to its peak was also the
        cooldown period for the Tree God's Advent. If the Tree Kings used the
        Tree God's Advent consecutively, the Tree King Crowns would shatter and
        disappear after three times. It would take thousands of years for it to
        be reborn, which meant that the Tree Kings would no longer have any
        special bonuses during this time. It would be a mere title.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Furthermore, the descent of the Tree God required a special fuel. It was
        a material called the ‘Legacy of the King'. When a Tree King failed to
        advance to the Transcendent Grade and died, this special material would
        be produced. The mother tree could not convert this and could only store
        it. Although it had accumulated over the years, the number of Tree Kings
        who chose to advance in recent times was decreasing. Each ‘Legacy of the
        King' used would mean one less… and only the Ancestral Tree King knew
        about this!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As the most experienced tree king, the Ancestral Tree King also knew
        another secret
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        -any member of the World Tree would die if they chose to advance to the
        Transcendent Grade. This had nothing to do with their talent but was
        rather a restriction of the mother tree.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In the beginning, the mother tree was not as strong as it was now.
        Instead, through the feedback provided by its civilization, it had
        devoured countless things to grow to its current state.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Only by devouring something new and possessing the information state of
        that thing would the World Tree be able to unlock the corresponding
        abilities. The World Tree had never devoured a Transcendent Grade Super
        before, so Beyond Grade As were the individual limits of the World Tree
        Supers. However, this did not mean that the members of the World Tree
        would not be able to advance. In fact, as long as a Tree King could step
        into the Transcendent Grade, they would be able to take back their
        information state that had been devoured by the mother tree. They would
        then be separated from the World Tree and gain their freedom.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, the World Tree would not allow any member to escape its
        control. So long as someone tried to advance, not only would the mother
        tree not protect them, but it would also automatically interfere. This
        was because everyone's Information Form was under its control, thus it
        could easily trigger a vicious mutation during their promotion.
        Therefore, in terms of strength, one would never reach the Transcendent
        Grade. All the Tree Kings that had tried to advance had died and turned
        into the ‘Legacy of the King', which was the Beyonder's Vestige, stored
        in the World Tree.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Therefore, the will of the Mother Tree had such a strong appetite after
        it descended as the Tree God Advent, and it could not wait to eat Black
        Star… So long as it devoured this true Transcendent Grade life form, it
        would be able to obtain the information form of the Transcendent Grade
        and unlock the upper limit of individual strength. Of course, there
        would be a price to be paid for the ability to revive indefinitely.
        Their upper limit was shackled, and only when the World Tree grew would
        their upper limit be increased… However, no one except the Ancestral
        Tree King knew about this.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Ancestral Tree King never chose to advance because he did not want
        to benefit others. Furthermore, he kept this secret and did not tell the
        subsequent Tree Kings.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        All sorts of thoughts flashed through his mind, and the Ancestral Tree
        King said with a deep voice,
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "The timing of that Mechanic's advancement is too coincidental. Our luck
        is not on our side. Luckily, I took back the crown of the Secret Tree
        King at the crucial moment. Otherwise, the power of the Tree God would
        have dropped even further."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "The Secret Tree King can't be saved now. Who are you planning to let
        inherit this title?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Fortitude Tree King clenched his teeth as he held his head in pain
        and asked.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "…Let's think about it again." The Ancestral Tree King's expression was
        grave as he looked at the three empty thrones. His mood was extremely
        bad.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Of the five Great Tree Kings, one had died, two had been sealed, and
        only two were left. When had they ever been in such a sorry state during
        their battles in the universe?!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">This was a truly miserable outcome…</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Furthermore, the person who stayed behind to accompany him was the most
        annoying salted fish, the Fortitude Tree King. This caused the Ancestral
        Tree King to only feel more tired.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The one he wanted to eliminate the most was the Fortitude Tree King. It
        was not only because this guy liked to slack off, but also because he
        suspected that he might have guessed something. That was why he was so
        lazy and did not bother to advance anymore.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Fortitude Tree King however did not notice the look in the Ancestral
        Tree King's eyes and said worriedly, "The Tree God's Advent is
        incomplete, and we are no match for that Mechanic. Our individual
        strengths are also completely suppressed. What should we do in the
        future?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "We can only temporarily give up on the battle of individual strength.
        Don't let the high-level combatants make a move, or we'll be sealed one
        by one. Furthermore, we probably won't be able to save the Heart Tree
        King. That Tree King Crown might be lost forever…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">The Ancestral Tree King was depressed.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "What about the mother tree's natural enemy?" the Fortitude Tree King
        asked with a worried tone.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "…That is another time bomb. I have to think of something."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">The Ancestral Tree King's expression darkened.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The World Tree was originally very calm about this war. It was in no
        hurry and was fearless like a fisherman.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, the appearance of the Pivotal Snake had hit their weak spot,
        causing their advantageous situation to become precarious. They had no
        choice but to race against time, causing themselves to fall into a
        quagmire! If it was just the coordinates of the mother tree's main body
        being exposed, the Ancestral Tree King would not panic. He had always
        emphasized that the main body could not be moved, but the main body of
        the mother tree was not fixed. Although the moving process was
        troublesome, it could indeed be transplanted into other secondary
        dimensions.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The reason he had revealed the fake information was to leave himself a
        way out. He was akin to a crafty rabbit with three burrows, and he could
        also use that as a trap… However, no civilization had forced him to
        reveal this trump card, so the Ancestral Tree King had kept it a secret
        until now.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, a Pivotal Snake in its adulthood could sense the location of
        the mother tree's main body at any time. It was equivalent to a radar
        that could locate the mother tree from an infinite distance. No matter
        how many times the main body was transplanted, it would be useless. This
        was a huge matter regarding the survival of the civilization, and the
        Ancestral Tree King had to take it seriously! However, even if the World
        Tree could sense its natural enemy, the Pivot Snake was protected by the
        Mechanic, and they had almost no chance at all. This was the biggest
        threat!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After thinking about it, he was still at a loss as to what he could do.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The only way he could think of now was to destroy the three Universal
        Civilizations without caring about the casualties. This way, even if
        Black Star had the Pivotal Snake, it would be difficult for him to
        gather enough strength to attack the mother tree.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Even so, it will only treat the symptoms and not the root cause. That
        Mechanic will forever be a threat to the mother tree…
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">If there are no new variables, I'm afraid…"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Ancestral Tree King clenched his fists. A layer of haze covered his
        heart, and his expression wavered.

        The World Tree Blessed Races lost in the secondary dimension
        battlefield, and the alliance army that was originally fighting at the
        frontline of the Flickering World also stopped attacking and temporarily
        retreated. Compared to the danger of fighting in the shallow layer
        dimension, the defensive perimeter of the Flickering World border was
        impregnable. With this wave of attacks, many of the shallow layer
        dimensions were riddled with holes. Although they managed to repel the
        enemies, the damage was not small because the battlefield was in the
        territory controlled by the three Universal Civilizations. A portion of
        the territory was destroyed, and the three Universal Civilizations
        quickly cleaned up the battlefield and repaired all kinds of war
        facilities.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao, on the other hand, withdrew his abilities and left a portion
        of his mechanical army to help clean up the battlefield. He then used
        remote projection to meet with the leaders of the three Universal
        Civilizations.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As soon as Han Xiao arrived, he heard a round of bootlicking.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Black Star, you've worked hard!"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Luckily, we repelled the World Tree Blessed Races. If we let the enemy
        destroy our territory in the secondary dimension, we would have been in
        a passive position and would have dragged down the battlefront of the
        main universe. This was all thanks to you. We thank you on behalf of the
        entire Galactic Society."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "I didn't expect the World Tree to also have Transcendent Grade combat
        power, but it's still not as strong as you. We trusted the right
        person."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao raised his brows and looked at the three of them. They had
        friendly smiles on their faces, and their attitude was even friendlier
        than before. "Alright, alright, stop bootlicking."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Han Xiao did not feel anything.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He knew the three of them too well. They were just afraid of his
        Transcendent Grade strength, so they were not stingy with the praises
        and wanted to gain favorability with him.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Hearing this, the three of them did not speak anymore. Marbruce asked
        curiously, "You fought with the World Tree's Transcendent. How do you
        feel? Is there any pressure?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Han Xiao shook his head and said,</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "The World Tree's Transcendent is called the Tree God, and it doesn't
        seem to be a single life form. It might be an individual created through
        some form of fusion. I realized that its combat power wasn't at its
        peak. I am guessing that the Tree God's bad state is related to the two
        Tree Kings being sealed…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">He briefly explained his discovery.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "In that case, it seems like you did a good job sealing the Heart Tree
        King back then. You have foresight," Louis praised.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao waved his hand. "Don't be too happy yet. Although I can deal
        with the Tree God, it will be very difficult to kill him. His
        regeneration ability is as amazing as mine, and he can turn illusory and
        return to the inside of the World Tree at any time, as agile as me."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "It can't be, doesn't that mean he is just as disgusting as you… Ahem, I
        mean, tricky…" Marbruce quickly coughed and changed his words.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Han Xiao rolled his eyes.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Anyway, the Tree God is not easy to deal with. However, I feel that
        this ability cannot be used casually. There should be a price to pay.
        Otherwise, they would have used the Tree God to kill everyone ten years
        ago."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The three of them nodded and looked at each other as if they had come to
        an agreement.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Black Star, we have an idea, or rather, a request. We hope that you can
        temporarily guard the secondary dimension alone."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao raised his brows. "You mean, other than the fleet, I will be
        the only high-level combatant in the entire shallow layer dimension? No
        matter how many Beyond Grade As the World Tree sends out, I'll deal with
        them alone?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "With your ability, one person is equivalent to hundreds of Beyond Grade
        As. There's no need for the other combatants to stay here. We believe in
        your ability. You can guard the secondary dimensional battlefield
        alone!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Marbruce's tone was serious, and his words had the meaning of ‘we have
        high hopes for you'. Han Xiao curled his lips. "If I didn't know that
        you guys don't dare to have an internal conflict now, I would have
        thought that you guys are trying to trick me."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "You must have misunderstood us. We're not like that." The three of them
        looked helpless.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "I think you guys misunderstood your own image. When did you become
        human?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Han Xiao shrugged and said casually,</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Alright, since you guys want me to hold the fort alone, I will guard
        the secondary dimension alone. It's not difficult anyway."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Because the World Tree's main body was rooted in the secondary
        dimension, this was the main battlefield to further resist the foreign
        enemies. Han Xiao had originally planned to wait here for the
        opportunity.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This time, Han Xiao suddenly thought of something, and his tone became
        serious. "Speaking of which, the time when the World Tree discovered the
        expeditionary army outposts was a little coincidental. It happened not
        long after the appearance of the Pivotal Snake. I suspect that the two
        are related."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Hearing this, the three of them instantly perked up.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"What are your guesses? Share them."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "I've told you about the Pivotal Snake's ability. When it matures, it
        will be able to track the location of the World Tree's main body.
        Therefore, I suspect that there is a two-way connection between the
        World Tree and it. With the World Tree's maturity, it might be able to
        sense the Pivotal Snake's location. Therefore, the outposts were
        exposed."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Then what do you plan to do?" The three of them were slightly shocked.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Since I'm guarding the secondary dimension, I can also protect this key
        trump card, the Pivotal Snake, and bring it with me. No matter how the
        World Tree attacks, they will have to get past me first.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Han Xiao paused before continuing.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As for how to prove this point, it will depend on what the World Tree
        does next. If they have the information about the Pivotal Snake, they
        will know that they are on the passive side, and they will definitely go
        crazy and strengthen their attacks, not caring about the losses, all for
        the sake of time… They don't have to do this just because I have shown
        extraordinary combat strength, so once the World Tree shows signs of
        this, it would mean that my guess is correct.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Good idea. Let's do it your way." The three of them relaxed and
        expressed their trust.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After discussing the follow-up plan for a while, Han Xiao deactivated
        the projection and returned to his room.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He first went to check on the status of the Pivotal Snake. The Pivotal
        Snake did not get involved in the battle and remained indifferent to
        him.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Realmless King, who had already been promoted to a stockman from the
        trash station owner, was even more respectful, indicating that he would
        play with the snake seriously.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Leaving behind more Mechanical Oracles to protect the Pivotal Snake, Han
        Xiao then changed into the King and teleported back to the main
        universe, arriving at the Siebert Fortress at the border of the
        Flickering World.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He easily found a group of mascots, and without a word, used a combo
        attack ‘crouching dragon touch Feidin'. After getting enough luck, Han
        Xiao closed the door and opened the interface to complete the Tree God's
        challenge mission.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The format of the mission was the same as the Beyond Grade A Challenge
        mission, with the duration as the rating, but the reward was many times
        higher.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The two of them had fought for a long time, and he had already unlocked
        all the levels of rewards. The experience reward that he had accumulated
        from this mission had replaced (Ending the Darkness) to become the
        highest experience gain mission that he had ever seen. It had reached a
        total of 2.4 Trillion Experience which was more than double the
        experience reward of (Ending the Darkness). In other words, it was
        equivalent to more than 20 Manison.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The other rewards also appeared. You have received [Character Summon
        Card &ndash; Tree God (Incomplete)]!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Character Summon Card &ndash; Tree God (Incomplete): (World Tree
        Devouring) &ndash; Devour materials or energy to convert into the power
        of the World Tree to replenish your energy. You can summon World Tree
        Roots. Usage: 0/4]
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Recovery ability? It's so-so… However, if I used this Character Summon
        Card, would I be devouring things or helping the World Tree devour?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Han Xiao scratched his head.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        When he fought with the Tree God, if he used this move to summon the
        World Tree Roots, would the roots listen to him or the other party?
        Furthermore, if the World Tree saw that he could summon the roots of the
        World Tree, would it think that he was its half-brother ? You have
        received a reward: Draw one of Tree God's Ability/Talent.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Note: Tree God is a special life form. Parts of abilities have been
        adjusted.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Randomizing… complete!</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Please select one of the five options below as the reward.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        1. (Tree King Crown &ndash; Liberation) &mdash; Ability: Merge Tree King
        Crowns to summon the Tree God. Liberating a Tree King Crown will
        increase the Tree God's strength, but the price is the destruction of
        the Tree King Crown.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        (Information Uniqueness&mdash;Conceptual Immortality] &mdash; Talent: As
        long as there are information carriers in the entire universe that
        record your deeds, as long as someone still recited your name, you will
        not completely perish. Even if your soul and body perish, you will be
        reborn in a certain time and space through information state
        disturbance.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        [Mental Network &mdash; World Tree] &mdash; Ability: Enter the World
        Tree's Symbiotic Mental Network. No delay in communication with any life
        form of the World Tree regardless of the distance.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        (Inner Space Enhancement) &mdash; Talent: Your Inner Space is stronger
        and harder to break.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        (Information Form Obliteration] &ndash; Talent: You can ignore space
        restrictions and damage the other party's Information Form base, causing
        damage. At the same time… Individual memory, network data, book records,
        and other information carriers will also be affected.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Hiss…</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao took a deep breath. "As expected, the Transcendent Grade has
        the ability to attack Information Form and can be used against people of
        the same level."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He carefully browsed through it a few times and roughly understood the
        mechanism of [Information Form Obliteration). To explain it simply, it
        was probably to eliminate all traces of the other party's existence in
        the world. Not only would everyone forget about him, but even the
        internet data and text records would disappear. It was specifically used
        to restrain [Information Uniqueness-Conceptual Immortality). It was
        similar to the information form of the sub-body of the Destiny's Child.
        It could not be observed or spread.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As for the revival mechanism of the World Tree and the Underworld Hero
        Spirit, there was a high chance that they would be broken, and those who
        were affected would die completely. As for the Sanctum Revival, he was
        not sure if it would be affected.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, this talent could not be used casually. One of the most
        important factors was the state of the target… Even if there was a huge
        difference in strength, as long as the target could resist, (Information
        Form Obliteration) would not work.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The simplest trigger condition was for the target to be on the verge of
        death or be in a state of ‘death', or be killed by the ability user. At
        this time, Han Xiao also realized that this was the reason why the
        Secret Tree King did not dare to self-destruct. Self-destructing in
        front of him was equivalent to giving up on resisting, exposing his
        belly and letting him do whatever he wanted. However, this guy did not
        expect that he did not have this ability before.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "I didn't know how to do this, but you guys personally gave this ability
        to me. Thank you."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Han Xiao laughed.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After pondering for a while, he finally decided to choose [Information
        Form Obliteration).
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Perhaps he would be able to unlock this skill by himself later on, but
        he had no clue at the moment. Who knew what the conditions would be for
        him to comprehend it?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao had always believed that only the benefits on hand were
        meaningful, and this ability was the trump card that he urgently needed
        in the current situation.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Furthermore, he had a worry.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao had always thought that the three Universal Civilizations had
        won after blowing up the World Tree's main body in his previous life,
        but now that he saw that the Tree God had the [Information
        Uniqueness&mdash;Conceptual Immortality], would it also be used on the
        World Tree's main body?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Did the three Universal Civilizations' victory in his previous life end
        the war once and for all, or was it temporary peace? Did the World Tree
        disappear, or was it reborn somewhere?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Even though the possibility of this speculation was not high, Han Xiao
        felt that he had to obtain the (Information Form Obliteration) as
        insurance.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        You have received the new talent (Information Form Obliteration]!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The next moment, a mysterious feeling appeared in Han Xiao's mind. He
        turned to look at the metal table beside him.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        His vision changed. He seemed to be able to see fine threads extending
        from the table, penetrating the wall and extending into the distance.
        Following these threads, he seemed to see all the information carriers
        related to it. He seemed to be able to see the source of the materials
        of this table, where they were processed, assembled, and how they were
        transported to this place. How many people were in contact with it…
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, when he wanted to take a closer look, these images disappeared
        as though it was just an illusion.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Interesting."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao looked around the room. Many threads extended from the objects,
        which meant that they were connected to various information carriers. He
        had a feeling that he could cut these threads.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "I can only see the connection, but I can't see the exact situation… If
        this ability is improved further, won't it mean that I will be
        omniscient? Could this be the development path of a Transcendent?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Han Xiao's eyes sparkled.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Suddenly, he had an idea. He opened the interface, wanting to see the
        information connection of the interface. However, there were only two
        threads. One was connected to him, and the other extended indefinitely.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao narrowed his eyes and suddenly had a bold idea.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "What will happen if I cut this… Forget it, I'd better not create
        trouble now."
      </p>

        </span>
      </h1>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao shook his head and retracted his (Information Form
        Obliteration] vision.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The ability that he drew this time was not too bad. In his mind, the
        Tree God was ranked third on the Good Guy List, and the second was the
        Germinal Organization leader.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">The first place could only belong to Manison.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Speaking of which, the Tree God still has quite a lot of good stuff on
        it. It would be great if I could draw a few more times… However, the
        World Tree probably won't use this trick on me so easily anymore. I
        don't think the chances are high.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Han Xiao stroked his chin and pondered.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        During this extraction, he had also seen a portion of the Tree God's
        abilities from the options. Among them, (Tree King Crown &ndash;
        Liberation) confirmed his guess. The Tree God was indeed a product of
        the fusion of the various Tree Kings, and it seemed to consume a lot of
        energy. Since he had defeated the Tree God, the possibility of the other
        party using this move against him would not be high.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "However, based on the current situation, the three Universal
        Civilizations have turned from passive to active. They're the ones who
        are on pins and needles." Han Xiao smiled to himself.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The current situation was much better than in his previous life. Most of
        it came from his hard work-I am carrying the entire galactic society!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At this moment, black flames appeared in front of him and quickly formed
        Oathkeeper's soul projection.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Your Excellency Black Star, the three Universal Civilizations are
        cleaning up the battlefield, and our Holy Accord organization has
        already taken the opportunity to evacuate. We have not crossed paths
        much. What are your next instructions?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao glanced at Oathkeeper and saw how obedient he was. He could not
        help but laugh. "Your attitude changed very quickly. Are you afraid
        after seeing my heroic appearance?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "…" Oathkeeper's eyes twitched, but he did not speak.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        There was no way he would admit it. Not in this life.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Seeing that he did not reply, Han Xiao clicked his tongue and said,
        "Don't be so reserved. I still like your arrogant look."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"… Stop joking."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Alright, alright, I won't tease you anymore." Han Xiao smiled. His
        expression then turned serious, and he said, "The Holy Accord has been
        exposed to the world this time, but I don't plan to let you guys debut…
        cough, I'm talking about leaving the seclusion. Anyway, you guys can
        continue to return to the dark side. Without my call, you don't have to
        take the initiative to participate in the battle, and you don't have to
        have too much contact with the three Universal Civilizations. It's best
        to communicate everything through me."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Then what will the association say? They will definitely ask when this
        batch of revivors appeared. If you keep hiding it, they might become
        suspicious…" Oathkeeper said.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "You don't have to worry about that. I will explain it to them under the
        premise of hiding the details of the Holy Accord."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Han Xiao waved his hands.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Alright." Oathkeeper nodded.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "By the way, there's one more thing. Members of the Holy Accord can
        choose not to fight, but you have to contribute your technology in the
        secondary dimensions, such as Dimension Exile Bullets, Energy Disorder
        Shockwave, and so on to be used in war."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Alright, I'll listen to you."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Oathkeeper had already lost his anger from being tortured by Han Xiao,
        so he agreed expressionlessly.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At the same time, the Super Star Cluster Alliance was holding a meeting.
        The leaders of the various civilizations had complicated expressions on
        their faces.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "The three Universal Civilizations have repelled the secondary
        dimensional invasion of the World Tree… How fierce."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "At this rate, the three Universal Civilizations will be able to stop
        the enemy outside the territory of the explored universe. The situation
        will not be chaotic."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "If that's the case, we won't be able to carry out the plan…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">The leaders did not know what to say.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Super Star Cluster Alliance had originally planned to leave the
        explored universe with their entire civilization while the three
        Universal Civilizations were busy fighting the World Tree Civilization.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, from the looks of it, the three Universal Civilizations had not
        fallen into a hard battle at all. They were very stable!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        It was all Black Star's fault. He did not even give them a chance to
        start their plan! "Sigh, leaving the explored universe is one of the few
        opportunities for us to develop freely. Let's continue watching and hope
        that the World Tree is more reliable."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">The Star Arc Leader sighed helplessly.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This plan was very important to the Super Star Cluster Alliance. Even if
        the current situation was disadvantageous, they would not give up
        easily, but it was inevitable for them to feel depressed. A civilization
        leader narrowed his eyes and said in a low voice, "Maybe we can help the
        World Tree…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, before he could finish, the Star Arc Leader glared at him and
        scolded, "Don't drag us down if you want to die! If we're found out,
        we're dead!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He could not believe that someone would suggest such a suicidal idea.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        No matter how much they wished for the World Tree to disrupt the
        situation, they could only silently cheer for the World Tree and
        passively wait for the situation to change. How could they give any
        substantial help? Wouldn't that be colluding with the enemy? Speaking of
        this, the Star Arc leader was furious. Your World Tree is so impressive,
        I thought you could beat up the three Universal Civilizations, but you
        can't even get past Black Star.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">How could they even talk about invading?</p>
      <p class="calibre3">What a joke!</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        A few days later, the victory in the shallow layer dimensions was
        quickly spread throughout the galactic society under the push of the
        three Universal Civilizations. Although they agreed to Han Xiao's
        request and did not emphasize the battle between him and the Tree God,
        it still made the galactic residents very excited. Originally, when they
        heard the news of the World Tree invading from the secondary dimension,
        most of the galactic residents were filled with fear and panic. They
        only heaved a sigh of relief when they saw the three Universal
        Civilizations successfully defeating the enemy. They became even more
        excited, and their confidence in the three Universal Civilizations
        winning this war increased.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Because they felt that staying in the explored universe was much safer,
        the level of chaos on various planets had also been greatly reduced.
        Many galactic residents had settled down, and the frequency of
        demonstrations had decreased. There were also fewer people running away,
        making it easier for the administration.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The sudden appearance of the Holy Accord Revivors this time made them an
        important contributor to the war. However, they left after the battle
        and did not communicate with the three Universal Civilizations. Their
        actions were very mysterious and aroused the curiosity of the galactic
        residents.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        On the internet, many galactic residents recognized some of the people
        based on the Wayne Card combination. They were all famous Beyond Grade
        As in history.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Thus, all the clues pointed to Black Star, who grasped the Sanctum
        Revival. Countless galactic residents were passionately thinking about
        it, and various versions of their speculations were circulating on the
        internet.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The main planet of the Beyond Grade A Association, conference hall.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        All the Beyond Grade As gathered together and stared at Han Xiao.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Black Star, you have to give us an explanation. Who are those
        revivors?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Exactly! You've been hiding it from us for too long."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "This must have something to do with you. If you say you don't know,
        I'll ignore you for a month!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Most of the people who questioned him were Beyond Grade As of the
        current era, but Beiger, who knew the truth, and the rest of the
        revivors did not say anything and just watched the show.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Cough, that…" Kasuyi raised his hand slightly and coughed." Actually, I
        also know a little about this."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As soon as he said that, everyone's eyes turned sharp and focused on
        him.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        No way, you knew about it in advance when Black Star first revealed the
        Sanctum Revival. How did you know about this too? You even helped Black
        Star hide it from us?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In the past, when we saw your heavy facial features, we felt that you
        had a lot of experience, so we chose you to be the vice president. Now,
        it seems like you have already completely turned into Black Star's
        image!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Sierron, who was standing at the side, was jealous and envious. We're
        all vice presidents, so why do you know so many secrets? Why am I kept
        in the dark like a fool? You guys are treating me like a decoration!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Damn it, I can also be a trusted aide. I also want to be in the same
        boat as Black Star!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao was surprised. He turned to Kasuyi and asked, "When did you
        know?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"I guessed."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Kasuyi smiled in embarrassment.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        During the training period, Han Xiao once entered the Sanctum and got
        Oathkeeper to contact Kasuyi.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Although Oathkeeper did not reveal anything about the Holy Accord,
        Kasuyi's first impression was that Oathkeeper was Han Xiao's secret
        subordinate outside. After some deduction, he guessed that Han Xiao
        might have a backup plan and might have hidden a batch of revivors.
        Therefore, Kasuyi was not surprised that the Holy Accord organization
        had appeared. Instead, he felt that it was ‘as expected'.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao thought about it for a while and guessed where Kasuyi had
        learned it from. He did not mind and turned around to look at everyone
        else.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "I originally planned to explain this to everyone. Back then, when the
        three Universal Civilizations clashed with the association, I specially
        got a group of revivors to hide and form a special group. If anything
        happened to us, we would have a way out and also have ways to counter
        the enemy, so don't blame me for hiding it.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "You all know what happened after that. The World Tree suddenly invaded,
        and we made peace with the three Universal Civilizations and fought
        against the enemy together, so I kept this trump card hidden. Not long
        ago, the secondary dimensional battlefield was in danger, so I sent them
        out to help."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Everyone nodded in agreement.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, Sun Hunter asked casually, "Since they're exposed, why don't
        they join the association?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao smiled. "This concerns our future development path. In my mind,
        a portion of the Beyond Grade As should form an organization in the
        dark, one in the open and one in the dark, guarding each other. Unless
        something big happens, they will remain in the dark. These mysterious
        revivors are the first batch of members. They are not simply obeying
        orders, they also have the idea of retiring, so this mission is very
        suitable for them.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        I plan to keep this system as a place for Beyond Grade As to retire.
        Once everything stabilizes, if anyone gets tired of conflict and
        politics, they can choose to retire in this organization and regain
        their adventurer identity."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As soon as he said that, everyone's eyes flashed. They caught Han Xiao's
        hidden meaning and could not help but look at him deeply.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        It seemed like Black Star would no longer be satisfied with the
        association after becoming a Transcendent. When the war ended, he would
        most likely make use of the official position recognized by the three
        Universal Civilizations to do something big…
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">‘War is indeed the catalyst for ambition…'</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Many Beyond Grade As felt this way.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, from a personal point of view, they did not reject this point.
        Black Star was an ambitious leader, and it was a good thing for them.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Then I have no objections."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Us too."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">"You sure have foresight."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Everyone expressed their agreement and gave a round of praise.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao smiled and was about to speak when the interface suddenly
        vibrated.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He was slightly stunned. He opened the interface and looked at the
        notification. His eyes lit up.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">(Version 5.5 started!]</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Data is being obtained… Data obtained!</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Player forums have been opened.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Welcome to"Galaxy"Version 5.5 &mdash; (Age of Black Star- War of All
        Territories]
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Oh, this small update is finally over?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Han Xiao immediately perked up.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The players had gone offline more than ten years ago due to a mini
        version update. He did not expect the cute leeks to come back at this
        time.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, Han Xiao was not happy for long before his attention was
        attracted by the change in the name of the version.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"War of All Territories?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Han Xiao narrowed his eyes.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        According to his experience, the version update would usually be on the
        eve of some major event.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The situation of the three Universal Civilizations was great, and the
        World Tree had fallen into a passive state. However, the version had
        such a name. This made him feel that things were not simple.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "The name of this version refers to whose territory it is. Are we going
        to overthrow the World Tree, or will the World Tree attack the three
        Universal Civilizations like in my previous life? They are now blocked
        outside the border of the Flickering World, do they still have such an
        opportunity… Hmm, it's best to take precautions and inspect it."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Han Xiao's eyes sparkled.</p>

      </h1>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In one of the Black Star Army bases, white light flashed, and countless
        army players appeared out of nowhere. Very soon, there was a veritable
        sea of people.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The players were already familiar with this. They opened the interface
        to look at the version number while opening the quantum network to look
        at the current time.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Oh my, the time span for this version is only slightly more than ten
        years, much shorter than the last time."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "It's just a small version update, I guess." "Didn't the three Universal
        Civilizations say that the World Tree Civilization will enter the
        territory in ten years? The timing should be just right. It seems like
        Galaxy Times was right. This is the time for the update, right into the
        stage of the war." "It's not easy to finally get a universal war. As
        long as the version update doesn't directly skip it, I'll be satisfied."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Many players browsed through the events of the past decade as they
        casually chatted.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        There was nothing much worth paying attention to during the ten years of
        preparation. Only the changes in the Beyond Grade A population
        interested many players.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"No way, Lagi is already a Beyond Grade A Super?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "The gambling dog Hadavy hasn't advanced yet? Hahahaha, I knew it!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Nero's life is really smooth-sailing. Is this what it means to be a
        part of the later generations…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "F*ck! EsGod was already released, and he even killed a Tree King?
        Amazing!" "Tsk, there are too many new Beyond Grade As. The cost of
        collecting all the Wayne Cards has increased again."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "F*ck, did Black Star and the Dragon Emperor announce their
        relationship? Damn it! There's no hope for this old man anymore… My
        partner was born before I was, and they've already aged when I'm at my
        peak. Is this what a bitter life is like…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "What are you thinking? Black Star is mine!" "They're a perfect match,
        so how can a demon like me object? Boohoo…" Many army players flipped
        through the rumors of Beyond Grade As one after another, their gossipy
        hearts burning.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Initially, other than Han Xiao and a few other Beyond Grade As, the
        other top-notch experts did not have much contact with the players. The
        players did not have a deep impression of them, so they would not
        deliberately remember them. However, the existence of the Wayne Cards
        had become a bond between the two parties, which led to the players
        being extremely familiar with the names and deeds of every Beyond Grade
        A.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, compared to the casual players, the professional players were
        more concerned about utilitarian matters. They were not in the mood to
        gossip and were mainly gathering useful information to discuss.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Maple Moon analyzed in a low voice. "The name of the version after this
        update has an additional ‘War of All Territories'. The World Tree will
        most likely be able to fight its way in. This should be the theme of the
        version."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Hmm, I did some research on the internet. The World Tree has already
        reached the border, but it is temporarily blocked by the Galactic
        Alliance Army. Furthermore, the World Tree invaded from the secondary
        dimension a few days ago and was forced to retreat. The current
        situation of the three Universal Civilizations isn't too bad."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Maple Moon looked at the interface and said, "The level cap has been
        unlocked for this version update. This way, the players in the top tiers
        should be able to enter the Calamity Grade."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Frenzied Sword nodded in agreement and said, "As our overall strength
        increases, there will be more ways to increase our strength.
        Furthermore, some of our abilities will undergo a qualitative change. I
        think there will be a huge change in this Pro League."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This mini version update did not take long, and the main storyline
        mission did not change. What the professional players cared about the
        most was that the level cap was unlocked from level 180 to level 200,
        and there was room for improvement.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Let's go to the frontline first and get to the command center to
        arrange a combat mission."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Let's go. If we're late, we'll miss out on the good missions."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The players were in an uproar for a while, before they finally
        understood the current situation. They all took their spaceships to the
        frontline, and streams of light left the base.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        On the other side, the main planet of the Beyond Grade A Association.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao had already announced the end of the meeting. When he returned
        to his room, he saw many players online through surveillance.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Has his level been unlocked to level 200? As long as one doesn't have
        too many subclasses, the players who grew themselves in the standard
        manner should be able to enter the Calamity Grade. The scale this time
        will be huge."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        If it was in the past, Han Xiao would have been afraid, but now, he had
        enough confidence. Even if a large number of players entered the
        Calamity Grade, they would not be able to cause him much trouble.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Although he had reached the Transcendent Grade, he had yet to reach the
        limit of that realm, thus he still had to harvest leeks. However, before
        the last update, he had already harvested a large number of players'
        wealth. Now that the players had just come online, their wallets were
        dry. He had to wait for them to earn some money before he could reap the
        profits.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Furthermore, Han Xiao had found another way to farm EXP, and that was to
        use psionic waves to rampage on the battlefield. This speed was much
        faster than the mechanical army, and the cost was extremely low and
        convenient. Even if there was a level penalty, where the normal members
        of the World Tree could only provide the lowest 1 EXP, he took whatever
        he could get. The people of the World Tree revived continuously, thus
        they were perfect targets for gaining experience. Han Xiao decided that
        he had to have his cake and eat it too.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The players were already on track, so there was no need to worry too
        much. Han Xiao was more concerned about the meaning of the name of the
        version since he had no idea what the implications were behind it.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"No matter what, this is a clue…"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Han Xiao nodded to himself.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Under his influence, the direction of "Galaxy" was completely different
        from his previous life. He had also come into contact with many secrets
        that the players in his previous life could not touch. He did not dare
        say that he understood this universe completely. Even if the suspicion
        based on the name of the version was just groundless speculation, it was
        better to be cautious.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao closed the interface and summoned Phillip to give some orders.
        He then changed into The King and teleported to Floating Dragon.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Currently, the entire Planet Aquamarine civilization had migrated, and
        Floating Dragon had followed them. They were currently taking refuge in
        the Central Galaxy.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In the huge palace of the Dragon Emperor, a light flashed, and Han
        Xiao's figure appeared out of thin air. He turned around and walked
        toward Aesop's residence.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Since there were no clues, he would ask the metaphysical.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He soon arrived at his destination and pressed the doorbell.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"You're here?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Aesop opened the door and invited Han Xiao</p>
      <p class="calibre3">in.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao did not stand on ceremony. He sat on the sofa and smiled. "How
        didn't you foresee that I would come to find you?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Prophecy isn't always effective. Ever since you became a Transcendent,
        prophecies regarding you have become more and more difficult…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Aesop shook his head.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">"That's true." Han Xiao nodded.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He had already done the test. As a Transcendent, his information
        projection state had undergone a sublimation, as if it had a certain
        level of information concealment property. It was difficult for
        outsiders to predict it.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Why are you looking for me?" Aesop paused and said, "If it's a
        prophecy, please forgive me for being powerless. I can't use my ability
        for the time being."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Hmm? What happened?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao was slightly stunned. He looked at Aesop carefully and realized
        that Aesop's face was dispirited, as though he had been seriously ill.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "When I received the passive prophecy the other time, I suffered a
        backlash. The target of my prophecy was an unprecedented mage who
        inflicted damage on me. My spirit still needs time to recover. Before
        that, I can't help you…" Aesop coughed and said with a weak tone.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"You didn't tell Ames?" Han Xiao raised his brows.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "No, she was too impulsive. I don't know how she would react if she knew
        about this."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Aesop shook his head. He rarely revealed important prophecy information
        to Ames and would only discuss matters with Han Xiao.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "I was going to tell you, but you rushed to the battlefield before I
        could say anything."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"When did this happen?" Han Xiao asked.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Calculating the time, I should have triggered the prophecy just before
        the expeditionary army outpost was attacked."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Hearing this, Han Xiao narrowed his eyes.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Such a coincidence… Could it be the Secret Tree King? That guy was
        indeed a very powerful mage.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Do you have any other memories of that mage?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "No, my foresight was shattered. I can't even remember what he looked
        like." "Is that so…" Han Xiao pondered." I might have guessed who this
        person is. He should be an expert from the World Tree."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"How is he? Did he cause you any danger?".</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Don't worry, I've already sealed him up. If you're angry, you're
        welcome to visit him anytime."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Forget it then. I don't have your bad taste." Aesop waved his hand.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao smiled, stood up, and was about to leave when Aesop suddenly
        said, "By the way, when will you and Ames reproduce?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao paused and said helplessly, "How would I know? I can do it
        anytime, but she doesn't agree. We'll have to see when she changes her
        mind."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Heh, she's just being stubborn. As long as the mood is right,
        everything will be fine." Aesop was instantly energized. "Back then, I
        traveled around the galaxy and made countless females fall in love with
        me. If not for my unwillingness, my children would have already spread
        across the various Star Fields. Let me tell you, I have quite a lot of
        experience in this area. Come, come, let me teach you some moves…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "You should keep it for yourself. I don't need it." Han Xiao's eyes
        twitched. "Eh, why not? This is all the spiritual wealth left behind by
        our predecessors. Once you've learned all these tricks, you'll be able
        to convince Ames. I'm not even willing to teach anyone else… Hey, don't
        go, at least listen!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Get lost."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao did not want to bother with this old man who had a rich history
        of love. He changed into The King and left, leaving Aesop in the room,
        sighing with regret. Holy Accord Organization Base, Destiny's Child
        Laboratory.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        With a flash of light, Han Xiao teleported over. The experimenters of
        the Holy Accord looked up, before continuing with their work.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao woke Destiny's Child up with ease. After communicating for a
        while, he let Destiny's Child predict his concerns.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">cerns</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After a while, Destiny's Child shook his head, indicating that he could
        not foresee it.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Seeing this, Han Xiao knew that his predictions would most likely not
        work. The other party had most likely used some sort of information
        concealment.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Looks like I can only increase the screening intensity and pay
        attention to any abnormalities…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Han Xiao pondered.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Central Galaxy, desolate universe belt.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In the secret base of the Star Alliance, a group of observers was
        gathered in a large room, staring at the device in the middle of the
        room.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This device was a cylinder with a diameter of about ten meters and a
        height of about fifteen meters. It was silver-gray, and its surface was
        connected to many wires. The indicator lights were flashing crazily, and
        there was a buzzing sound. This was a long-distance material
        transmission device.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After a while, the material transmission device suddenly shook,
        separating from the top and bottom. The pillar above slowly rose, and
        the interior of the pillar was revealed empty. There was a space covered
        by a transparent cover, and a white suitcase was lying inside. "My
        hometown sent it over."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Observer Captain stepped forward and twisted the valve. He opened
        the cover of the material transmission device, picking up the white
        suitcase from within, and opened it on the spot. Inside the suitcase
        were three white cans without any labels.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He took a pistol-like device from one of the team members and scanned
        the three cans one by one. After reading the numbers, he nodded.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Confirmed. They are all particles that have been enciphered."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Everyone was overjoyed. The Star Alliance had ordered the Observer Team
        to secretly leak information about the three Universal Civilizations.
        They had thought of many ways, including using the energy released by
        the Supernova to transmit a wave-like information surge to the entire
        universe, as well as using the Star position transmission method to
        secretly send messages to the World Tree, but they were all rejected. In
        the end, the Star Alliance chose to encode the tiny particles. They used
        the technology of microscopic transcription to spread the particles in
        the lower dimensions and record a huge amount of information. They then
        returned to their original form and turned the tiny particles into
        information carriers, containing all the information they wanted to
        leak.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Star Alliance mass-produced a pile of coded particles and prepared
        to throw them out of the border through the wormhole. This would cause
        the storage device to self-destruct at a certain time, attracting the
        attention of the World Tree and spreading the particles at the same
        time.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        They believed that with the technology of the World Tree, they should be
        able to discover the abnormality of these encoded particles and
        intercept them.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Star Alliance had been developing for a long time, and they had a
        high level of technology. They also had some knowledge of information
        forms, and they had always provided information cover for the Observer
        teams. They were not afraid of being discovered through any prophecy.
        They had secretly stolen the technological results of the galactic
        society for many years, and they were confident that they would not be
        discovered.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-1420">
      <h1 class="h" itemprop="headline">
        Chapter 1421: Suspicion<span hidden="" class="calibre1"> | </span>
      </h1>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Since he was suspicious, he had to take action. This had always been Han
        Xiao's style. He told Phillip to monitor the intelligence of the
        galactic society and report any abnormal movements immediately. However,
        after being cautious for a few months, he did not discover anything. The
        situation was still changing. Because of the Pivotal Snake, the World
        Tree Civilization could not wait to attack the border defense circle
        again and again. The other troops entered the battlefield like there was
        no end to them and did not care about the damage. However, the Galactic
        Alliance Army was not to be trifled with. How could their defense line
        be broken so easily?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Even in the secondary dimension battlefront, the World Tree Blessed
        Races did not believe it and invaded many times. However, with Han Xiao
        in the shallow layer dimension, it was like an immovable guardian deity.
        The Blessed Races invaded again and again, but they lost every time.
        They abandoned countless fleets and escaped many times, allowing Han
        Xiao to gain a lot of wealth.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The worst part was in the individual strength level. The World Tree
        realized that they were being completely crushed. The Flickering World
        had Aurora, the healer, as well as EsGod and Herberlon, who were
        top-tier combatants; the World Tree experts were exchanging their
        injuries for nothing. The secondary dimension protector was Han Xiao,
        who was at the Transcendent Grade. Even the Tree Kings did not dare show
        their faces, so the others were useless.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        All of a sudden, the Holy Tree Emissaries, Ancestral Spirits, and Army
        Commanders realized that there was no use for them in both battlefronts.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        If they had already invaded the territory, they would have been able to
        move around in the universe nimbly with their individual strength, just
        like special forces. This would have affected the energy of the enemy
        civilizations and caused all kinds of damage. However, in the current
        situation, they could only wait for orders.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After a few months of war, the tens of millions of players had once
        again integrated into the atmosphere of it. They could choose both
        fronts, and the missions were much richer. Their wallets also became
        thicker. Unfortunately, Version 5.5 had unlocked a new level cap, and
        the players' main goal was to level up. They did not have much money to
        spend.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As more and more players stepped into the Calamity Grade, the
        qualitative change also appeared. The players became more prominent on
        the battlefield, and the three Universal Civilizations paid more
        attention to them.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        From the perspective of the upper echelons, the explored universe was
        rich in resources. They were able to fight the battle of attrition with
        the World Tree Civilization for a long period of time because of their
        strong productivity. However, there was always an end to this path, and
        the World Tree Civilization was superior in this regard. As time passed,
        the three Universal Civilizations felt that they would start to weaken
        sooner or later, and the various hidden dangers of wartime policies
        would gradually appear.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Of course, this kind of situation would not happen anytime soon, and
        they were not the ones who were troubled. The three Universal
        Civilizations were currently sitting on the high platform, and they
        wished to fight a war of attrition more than the World Tree in exchange
        for time for the Pivotal Snake to grow. Therefore, the players who had
        the Calamity Grade potential and could not be killed were important
        strategic weapons in the eyes of the three Universal Civilizations, and
        they were not afraid of exhaustion.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The situation had been good for the past few months, and the galactic
        society was filled with confidence.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Although the players did not know about the Pivotal Snake, after
        analyzing the situation on the surface, they felt that the three
        Universal Civilizations were definitely going to win. After learning
        Black Star's operation, the matter would be settled with F2A[1]. With
        such an overwhelming advantage, how could they lose?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">At this point, Han Xiao noticed something.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "All the members of the Super Star Cluster Alliance have set up secret
        stargates in their territory and gathered a large number of civilians,
        resources, and long-distance battleships. They are suspected to be
        preparing an escape?" Han Xiao flipped through the information, his
        expression changing as he pondered.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Facing the invasion of the enemy, these advanced civilizations left
        themselves a way out. It was normal for them to make backup
        preparations. Even though the entire population was optimistic about the
        war and their confidence was boosted, the advanced civilizations still
        planned for the worst, which was understandable. Han Xiao had noticed
        the Super Star Cluster's actions before, but he had not taken it
        seriously.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, because of the suspicion of the ‘War of All Realms', as well as
        the fact that everything had been peaceful for the past few months, Han
        Xiao's skepticism had become more and more serious. Right now, he was a
        little suspicious about everyone. Even though the Super Star Cluster
        Alliance's plan was reasonable, it was still a little glaring in his
        eyes.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao recalled the performance of the Super Star Cluster
        Civilization's troops on the battlefield. Although they had completed
        their mission, he felt like they had not used their full strength.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In the past, he had thought that the Super Star Cluster was afraid of
        being used as cannon fodder by the three Universal Civilizations, so
        they were being cautious. However, when added to his skepticism now, he
        felt that something else was going on. After all, the conflict between
        the Super Star Cluster Alliance and the three Universal Civilizations
        was deeply rooted. It would not be their style if the Super Star Cluster
        Alliance did not seize the opportunity to do something in this kind of
        power reshuffling invasion.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "I feel like they're not just making a Plan B, they have other plans as
        well…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao stroked his chin and made up his mind to gather the secrets of
        the Super Star Cluster Alliance.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Anyway, regardless of whether there was a problem or not, it was not a
        bad thing to investigate. It would be best if he could find some
        evidence.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After sending a message to Phillip, telling him to pay attention to
        intelligence about them, Han Xiao exited the quantum network and walked
        out of the room. A huge cloud appeared in his eyes. Pivotal Snake was
        hiding inside, and beside it was the stockman Realmless King, as well as
        a group of mechanical soldiers acting as bodyguards.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Everyone was currently in a secondary dimension, allowing the Pivotal
        Snake to devour as much as it wanted. Han Xiao had been using the
        portable fortress to stay close to it, and while protecting it, he was
        also thinking about how to speed up the Pivotal Snake's growth.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Because of this, he had no choice but to do a full-body check of the
        Pivotal Snake. Of course, the Pivotal Snake was unwilling, but under his
        forceful control, it could only stare at Han Xiao with its cold and
        unwilling eyes, allowing Han Xiao to move its body back and forth.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After checking its body, Han Xiao realized that there was no gender
        difference in the Pivotal Snake, it could be said to be a hermaphrodite.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After a more detailed examination, Han Xiao also figured out how the
        Pivotal Snake reproduced, which made him feel a little complicated.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The reproduction of the Pivotal Snake needed to be done in a mating-like
        manner through the secondary dimension that had given birth to a
        consciousness, absorbing the secondary dimension in another way and
        turning it into an embryo. This kind of behavior could be called
        self-reproducing, or it could be said to be hybrid breeding. It just did
        not need the ‘help' of its own kind.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, thinking about it, it was likely that the Pivotal Snake would
        not be able to meet another of its kind in its lifetime. Furthermore, it
        was being hunted by the World Tree. If it could not reproduce alone, it
        would probably have gone extinct long ago.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The problem was that the Pivotal Snake usually ate secondary dimensions…
        In other words, this snake would reproduce with its food…
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Furthermore, after sleeping with him, you still want to eat him up as
        nutrition… Are you a female praying mantis?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        All kinds of thoughts flashed through Han Xiao's mind. He looked at the
        Pivotal Snake who did not even bother to look at him, and had some
        ideas.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "No matter how much the Pivotal Snake eats, it will at most gain weight
        and will not enter the mature stage quickly. The growth of a creature
        has to follow the rules… But if I change the foundation of its
        existence, I don't know if it will be effective."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao had a bold idea. If the Pivotal Snake was allowed to develop
        properly, who knew how long it would take for it to reach adulthood.
        However, if he used (Life Transformation-Virtual] to turn it into an
        artificial intelligence life form, the difference in life forms would be
        like the difference between heaven and earth. Would he be able to
        instill a large amount of data into it to speed up its maturity? The
        only problem was that he did not know if the Pivotal Snake could still
        keep its perception of the World Tree after its existence
        transformation.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Logically speaking, if the perception came from the Information Form
        level, it should not have any effect no matter what life form the
        Pivotal Snake had changed into.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, Han Xiao did not dare take the risk. There was only one Pivotal
        Snake, and he could not reverse its transformation.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "If only I could get one more, I could experiment…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao narrowed his eyes and looked at the Pivotal Snake.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Why not… let this snake give birth now?</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Speaking of which, it's still a cub, can it stick it up?…
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Han Xiao fell into deep thought.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        While Han Xiao was studying about breeding, the World Tree Civilization
        made some discoveries.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In the Tree King's palace, the Ancestral Tree King listened to the
        report from the frontline with a subtle expression.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Is it confirmed? The particles you intercepted contained a lot of
        information about the enemy civilization?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "That's right. These particles used microscopic recording technology
        that involves the transformation of dimensions. We're still trying to
        decode them and restore the specific content, but we can't be wrong.
        There are many spatial coordinates and star maps of the enemy's
        territory."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"There's such a thing?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">The Ancestral Tree King's eyes flickered.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The two armies were at a stalemate at the border, and the World Tree had
        also built a base and placed it at the entrance of the three Universal
        Civilizations. Not long ago, an urgent report came from the frontline.
        The radar of the frontline station had discovered that there were
        abnormal spatial reactions and weak signs of energy explosions somewhere
        a certain distance away. Thus, they sent out an exploration team to
        check, afraid that the three Universal Civilizations were not satisfied
        with defending and were creating problems.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, after some testing, they discovered that it was a temporary
        wormhole that had disappeared by the time the exploration team had
        arrived. To be cautious, the exploration team searched along the traces
        of the energy explosion, and the microscopic vision scanner quickly
        discovered that some special particles were floating in the area that
        seemed to have been scattered in all directions by the explosion.
        Therefore, the exploration team collected a portion of them, but they
        unexpectedly discovered a large amount of information related to the
        three Universal Civilizations.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        When he first found out about this, the Ancestral Tree King's first
        reaction was that it was a misleading tactic. He thought that it was
        fake intelligence from the three Universal Civilizations who wanted to
        trick them with false information.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The second reaction was that there was a traitor within the three
        Universal Civilizations. For some reason, they wanted to collude with
        the enemy… This was not the first time the World Tree had encountered
        such a thing. In their journey to conquer the universe, as long as the
        enemy was a composite civilization alliance, the internal structure
        would not be as solid as iron.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        His third thought was that there was a third party, hoping to add fuel
        to the fire and fish in troubled waters… The World Tree was equally
        experienced in this.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"The variable actually appeared here…"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        These thoughts flashed through the Ancestral Tree King's mind, and a
        strange expression appeared on his face. He seemed to heave a sigh of
        relief, but there was also a sneer on his face.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He had been at his wits' end for the past few months, and he had been
        worrying about the war with the three Universal Civilizations. He did
        not expect someone to send him a pillow[2] just as he was about to doze
        off. The most important thing now was to confirm if the intelligence was
        real. As long as it was not fake intelligence that the three Universal
        Civilizations deliberately released, there would be a favorable turn in
        the battle.

      <p class="calibre3">
        "Decipher all the contents as soon as possible and sort them out. At the
        same time, try to deduce the origin of this wormhole."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Ancestral Tree King did not hesitate and told the research
        department to quickly produce results.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Whether it was a traitor or a third party, no matter what their motive
        was, no matter if they wanted to make use of the World Tree… it did not
        matter to him. What was important was to eliminate the three Universal
        Civilizations and remove the biggest threat to the mother tree!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As for the other problems, once the threat was eliminated, the World
        Tree would once again be invincible. There would be plenty of time to
        slowly resolve them. The Ancestral Tree King had always been able to
        focus on the main conflict.

        "Reporting, there is an abnormal spatial reaction outside the border. It
        is suspected to be the formation of a wormhole." The military radar sent
        out a notification.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The military officers present moved closer and looked at the source.
        They realized that the abnormal signal was outside the border defense
        circle, not too far from the World Tree camp.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Can we investigate and see what's going on over there?" a staff
        sergeant asked.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Insufficient information. Recommended field inspection," the military
        artificial intelligence replied.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Hearing this, everyone looked at each other and muttered softly.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The border defense army was stationed at various posts in the defense
        circle. If they left this place, it would be difficult for them to deal
        with the World Tree fleet without the endless supply of defense
        mechanisms and fast support channels. Therefore, the border defense army
        had always focused on defense and would not take the initiative to
        attack.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The source of the anomaly was outside the defense circle. If they wanted
        to field investigate, they would have to move the fleet. Not only did
        they keep an eye on the World Tree, but the World Tree also kept an eye
        on the defense circle. Once the border defense army sent out a fleet,
        the World Tree would definitely send troops over to fight in the field
        and eat the fleet they sent out. Furthermore, from the distance, the
        World Tree was closer to the abnormal reaction source. Even if they sent
        troops over, they would most likely not gain anything
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Generally speaking, border troops rarely sent people to carry out such
        risky missions of unknown value. However… the players were perfect for
        this job.

        "Our mission this time is to investigate the abnormal signal area
        outside the border defense circle. There's a high chance that we will
        encounter a battle with the World Tree fleet. Everyone needs to be
        prepared to sacrifice themselves."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In the cabin, the light blue projection of the commander floated on the
        tactical command platform, explaining the details of the mission to the
        players in the room. If it was a normal person, he would not mention
        ‘sacrifice', but it did not matter to the Immortals. All the people
        participating in this mission were players.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Most of the time, this kind of scouting mission was a mistake and would
        not yield any results. If there was no players' suicide squad, the
        command center might not even send people to investigate. Most of the
        people were listening attentively, but Black Tea was distracted. He
        stayed behind the crowd and opened the forum to flirt with the female
        players. As an old player who had been scammed in Version 1.0, Black Tea
        had seen everything and was now more interested in female players. These
        combat missions were more or less the same-charge, die, pay, and
        complete.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Anyway, no matter what the commander said, when the actual mission was
        carried out, they still had to adapt to the situation. Black Tea was
        already familiar with the process and had his own way of doing things.
        In his opinion, there was no need to listen to the details at all. It
        was better to spend this time flirting with a few girls.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Not long after, the hyperdrive lights covering the ships dissipated, and
        the reconnaissance team had already arrived at their destination. In the
        universe outside the window, there was a World Tree team that seemed to
        be searching for something in the area. The number of battleships was
        less than half of the reconnaissance team, and as soon as they saw the
        three Universal Civilizations' reconnaissance team, they immediately
        turned around, as if they were trying to escape together.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"World Tree fleet detected, attack!"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The commander did not hesitate and immediately gave the order. This
        reconnaissance team fired at the World Tree exploration team without
        hesitation. The intercepting ship accelerated and chased after them with
        a group of players. Very soon, they caught a few World Tree exploration
        ships that could not escape in time.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Bang! Bang! Bang! The intercepting ships shot out charge cabins one
        after another, biting the bodies of the enemy ships, penetrating the
        exterior armor, and embedding themselves in. The players inside boarded
        the ships noisily, planning to control the spaceships.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        High-temperature flames spewed out, and lasers shot out in all
        directions. The group of players immediately started a massacre in the
        exploration ships, fighting with the members of the World Tree. It could
        be said that they were unstoppable. The World Tree warriors were either
        burnt to ashes, beaten into meat pies, or shot into sieves. The ground
        was filled with tattered corpses.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Black Tea tilted his body slightly and avoided a laser beam. He pointed
        his sword with a backhand stance, and a stream of white Pugilist energy
        shot out. It was sharp and cold, like a qi sword, and penetrated the
        chests of three World Tree warriors, instantly killing them.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "How is it, pretty cool huh?" "Brother, you're so strong. Can you bring
        me to dungeons in the future?" The female player in the video acted
        cutely.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"It depends on your performance."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Black Tea had a smug smile on his face as he spoke in the private chat.
        Even on the battlefield, he was flirting with girls. He turned on the
        video call to let the girl see his heroic side.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In the past few months, he had already completed the level 180 Promotion
        Mission, successfully advanced, and entered the Calamity Grade. He was
        undoubtedly the leader among the current players. This kind of boarding
        battle was not a problem for him at all, and he could easily pick up
        girls while fighting
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He chose the Pugilist class naturally because it was the most flashy of
        the five classes. Whether he was strong or not was a matter of one
        version, but whether he looked cool or not was a matter of life. While
        Black Tea was chatting, his teammates were already ploughing through the
        World Tree soldiers and getting further away.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">WO</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After watching the group of people leave happily, Black Tea did not
        follow them. He smiled and shook his head, showing the demeanor of a
        gentleman. He said, "You can't get too excited when you're doing
        missions. Look at these people. They're classic negative examples.
        They've finally gotten the chance to be unparalleled, and they're
        already so reckless. You have to use your brain when doing missions.
        Learn a little."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After putting on a show, Black Tea did not follow the rest of the team.
        Instead, he turned around and walked into the corridor alone. He
        casually broke the walls and floors of the cabin and went straight into
        the belly of the ship.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Very soon, he arrived at a gate without any obstructions. On the gate
        were the words ‘Analysis Room' and ‘Research Area' written in the
        language of the World Tree Civilization. Due to the invasion of the
        spaceship, all the guards had gone to protect the energy core, engine,
        control center, bridge, and other key areas. There was no one there,
        only some simple defense facilities that were dismantled by Black Tea.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Brother, what are you doing here alone?" The female player blinked and
        asked in confusion.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Hehe, I told you to use your brain. Think about it. Our mission is to
        investigate the abnormal situation in this area, and the World Tree
        fleet is one step ahead of us, but they're still here, seemingly looking
        for something. This proves that they've already discovered something.
        The World Tree exploration ship has a simple analysis lab, so there
        might be clues here. This is the main goal of our mission. If we can
        snatch the World Tree's exploration results, we won't have to risk
        staying here to investigate. We might even be able to complete this
        without dying."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After taking care of all the defense facilities, Black Tea walked into
        the room and spoke. "Wow, you're so experienced!" The female player was
        full of admiration.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"It's alright, mainly because I've seen too much."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Black Tea was secretly overjoyed.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Although he was indeed experienced, his words were just to show off. He
        wanted to show off his wisdom and that he was different from those pigs.
        As for whether he would gain anything here, it did not matter.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, at this moment, Black Tea suddenly stopped in his tracks and
        looked up at one of the transparent experiment chambers. There was a
        ball of light floating inside. When he looked over, the interface
        suddenly jumped, and a notification popped up. You have triggered the
        hidden mission (Source of Change). Mission Introduction: You have
        discovered an important clue that can change the war. It has an
        immeasurable value. If you bring it back, it will greatly affect the
        direction of the war.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Mission Requirements: Use a container to store this clue and bring it
        back to the three Universal Civilizations to report.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Reward: Depends on the rating.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Black Tea was stunned.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">No way, I was just bragging. It was really true</p>
      <p class="calibre3">"See, I told you, there must be some clues here!"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Black Tea immediately became excited and shared the mission interface
        with the girl. Then, he immediately went to the experiment chamber,
        searched for a while, found the storage button, and pressed it.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Tiny electric arcs flashed in the experiment chamber, guiding the light
        into a palm-sized tube container. The two ends of the container
        automatically turned and closed, and intricate mechanical parts with
        strong magnetic force joined tightly. Then, this tube slid along the
        transparent pipe, and half of it popped out from one of the holes in the
        operating table, meaning that it could be taken away.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        With a click, Black Tea opened the chest area of his mechanical suit and
        stuffed this round tube container into a storage groove. Then, he closed
        the armor and protected it. Without another word, he went back the way
        he came and reported the situation.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This battle did not last long. The reconnaissance team had defeated the
        World Tree exploration team, and the other party could only escape with
        their remaining troops. As this place was closer to the World Tree camp,
        the reconnaissance team did not want to chase after them.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Originally, they did not care about sacrificing themselves and planned
        to stay here for a while to investigate the abnormal situation. However,
        after obtaining the intelligence from Black Tea, the team changed their
        plan and directly retreated to avoid being chased by the World Tree's
        follow-up troops.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As soon as the reconnaissance team left, the reinforcements from the
        World Tree arrived. They gave chase symbolically and gave up when they
        approached the border defense circle. They watched as the reconnaissance
        team-that had obtained the encrypted particles-returned to the three
        Universal Civilizations.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Not long after, at the research center of the frontline base, the
        container brought back by Black Tea was transported. Under the research
        of a group of scientists, it gradually revealed its true appearance.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"This… this is…"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The research team leader looked at the deciphered content and widened
        his eyes in shock. He took a few steps back in disbelief.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Team leader, what did you find?" The officer who was waiting for the
        results felt his heart skip a beat and hurried forward. The research
        team leader came back to his senses and pounced in front of him. He
        grabbed the officer's shoulder and said anxiously,
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Bad news! Quickly inform the three leaders and His Excellency Black
        Star! Our territorial star maps have been leaked!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As soon as he said that, the expressions of all the officers and
        researchers changed.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">On the other side, in the Tree King's palace.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Your Excellency Tree King, according to your orders, we have already
        handed a portion of the encrypted particles to the enemy. They will
        firmly believe that this information was intercepted by them."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Well done."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Ancestral Tree King narrowed his eyes and nodded.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At such a close distance, the frontline troops had long discovered the
        uniqueness of the encrypted particles, so how could such negligence
        appear? All of this was naturally intentional. It was only when the
        three Universal Civilizations' reconnaissance troops repelled the World
        Tree exploration team that their reinforcements arrived and acted as
        though they could not catch up, but it was all fake.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Their true goal was to allow the three Universal Civilizations to obtain
        a set of encrypted particles in a less suspicious way.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "This is not a bad move. When they see the leaked information, they will
        most likely suspect that there is a spy. Things will become chaotic."
        Fortitude Tree King nodded.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "A powerful fortress can be broken through from the inside. Suspicion is
        the best weapon," the Ancestral Tree King said calmly.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        No matter who leaked this information to him, in his opinion, it was
        most likely that they did not want to be discovered by the three
        Universal Civilizations.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Ancestral Tree King did not mind being used, but he would not make
        the manipulator too happy. Since they wanted to use him, they had to
        bear the corresponding risk.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        On the other hand, even if the manipulator did not care, the Ancestral
        Tree King wanted to use this method to make the three Universal
        Civilizations suspicious and even split up.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "That's right. After all, not all civilizations can be as united as us.
        Everyone is connected to the mental network, and the mother tree will be
        in charge. There are no secrets," the Fortitude Tree King agreed with a
        smile.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Ancestral Tree King narrowed his eyes and glanced at him. He did not
        know if this was sincere or if there was a deeper meaning behind his
        words.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In the head office of the three Universal Civilizations, Marbruce,
        Louis, and the Pope received an urgent report on the coding particle at
        the frontline and immediately held a meeting.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Looking at the countless pieces of intel that had been deciphered, the
        three of them were furious.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "How bold, someone actually colluded with the enemy!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">The Pope slammed the table angrily.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">"No matter who it is, we have to find them!"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Anger burned in Marbruce's eyes.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Originally, the situation was very good. Relying on the border defense
        circle and Han Xiao, it was enough to resist the World Tree for many
        years. However, not long after they had gained the advantage, a traitor
        appeared in their family and leaked countless intelligence!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        With these coordinates, the World Tree would be able to jump through
        space, avoid the border defense circle, and directly invade. Countless
        battlefronts would be opened, and the stalemate would be broken.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        They had worked hard for so many years just to ensure that their
        territory would not be violated. Now, all their hard work had been
        wasted. The three of them were already beyond furious. They wanted
        nothing more than to tear the traitor to pieces!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At this time, Han Xiao received the invitation and appeared in the room.
        He frowned and went straight to the point.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "You said that the intelligence of the galactic society was leaked?
        What's the exact situation?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"See for yourself."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Marbruce separated a section of the virtual screen and sent it to Han
        Xiao.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Han Xiao quickly understood the situation.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        His first reaction was that the World Tree was trying to sow discord,
        using some kind of method to obtain information and then arousing
        suspicion within them… However, this information was so detailed that it
        was impossible to gather unless one had been in the explored universe
        for a long time. Therefore, it was more believable that someone leaked
        the information.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "It's either a traitor colluding with the enemy or a third party taking
        advantage of the situation," Han Xiao said.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "We think so too," Marbruce said grimly. "But in comparison, the
        possibility of a traitor is higher!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao stroked his chin and said, "If it's a traitor, their goal
        definitely isn't survival. Based on the current situation, the entire
        galactic society believes that we can resist the World Tree, so the
        traitor has other goals, such as taking revenge on you or taking
        advantage of the situation…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"We know that."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Louis' eyes flickered with a cold light. Before this, they had already
        discussed the suspects. Among them, the most suspicious ones were the
        Super Star Cluster Alliance and the lower level Star Cluster
        Civilizations. Even the Beyond Grade A Association was somewhat
        suspicious, so the three of them were wary of Han Xiao.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Although the current favorable situation was the work of Black Star, the
        position that the three of them were in made them suspect Han Xiao. Even
        though Black Star had made so many contributions, there was still a
        motive…
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">This time, Han Xiao's eyes suddenly flashed.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "The World Tree might have leaked this information on purpose to cause
        internal strife…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, halfway through, Han Xiao stopped and shook his head
        helplessly. Even if the World Tree did it on purpose, the information
        leak was real. Even if they guessed that this was the World Tree's plan,
        they could not let go of their suspicions. This was an open conspiracy.
        If the information was leaked by a third party, it might have been
        calculated in advance. Not only did they help the World Tree, but they
        also used the World Tree to raise suspicion in the galactic society.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao paused for a moment, put away these speculations, changed the
        topic, and said, "No matter what, the battle situation has changed. Make
        preparations as soon as possible to deal with the World Tree's full
        invasion. This is the most important task."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">The three of them nodded.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Although the three Universal Civilizations were prepared for war in the
        various Star Fields, compared to the border of the Flickering World, the
        defense of the other areas was naturally much weaker. There were still
        countless planets scattered around, allowing the enemy to enter their
        familiar battle rhythm of ‘sustaining war with war'.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "We have to find the traitor. Since they've done such a thing, they will
        definitely do something that benefits them at some point. Sooner or
        later, they will be exposed," the Pope said coldly.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "The earlier we confirm the target, the better. I will immediately order
        a specialized team to investigate this matter," Louis said.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao thought about it and said, "I need to study these encrypted
        particles personally. Maybe I can find some clues."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Hearing this, the three of them exchanged looks and finally nodded.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "We can give you a portion of the encrypted particles for research. I
        hope you find a clue soon."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Sure."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Looking at the three of them, Han Xiao knew that he was one of their
        suspects. He could not help but shake his head. At this time, he did not
        care. If he was in their position, he would not have trusted anyone
        either.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        ‘I didn't expect the name of the version to come true so quickly. Who is
        the one behind this… It can't be them, right?'
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao thought to himself. The stealthy Super Star Cluster Alliance
        flashed past his mind, and the figures of the Avengers appeared.

      <p class="calibre3">
        After learning about the situation from the three leaders, Han Xiao did
        not continue to participate in the ‘Among Us' brainstorming of the three
        of them. He deactivated the remote projection and went to the frontline
        research facility.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As soon as he walked into the laboratory hall, he could smell anxiety
        and panic in the air. Countless researchers were moving back and forth,
        deciphering the encrypted particles.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Your Excellency Black Star, Ruler Marbruce has given me a secret order.
        Please follow me."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        An officer who had been waiting for a long time immediately came forward
        and led Han Xiao into the corridor.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Not long after, the two of them arrived at a private laboratory. There
        was an expert team doing decryption work, but it was different from
        simply decrypting the content of the encrypted particles outside. This
        place was also responsible for finding the technical characteristics of
        the encrypted particles. The moment the door opened, Han Xiao heard the
        endless argument inside.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "… The structural deviation of this particle is obviously too high,
        forming a typical three-direction ratio with Marvir's readings. It has
        the characteristics of the Karpoke warped technology and the Siber space
        conversion. It's definitely based on the third theoretical model of
        particle space!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "It's just similar! You ignored the characteristics of dimension change
        folds and the weakening of the nuclear force. This is a technology that
        the three Universal Civilizations have already eliminated!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao turned around and saw the group of experts gathered in front of
        the experiment table and arguing while pointing at the readings on the
        apparatus.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The same theory could extend to all kinds of applications and achieve
        the same goal through different means. However, although some techniques
        were similar in their performance and final results, there were many
        differences in the actual usage process. If one tried to understand it
        in a less correct but simpler way, it would be equivalent to the same
        character having different ways of writing, so there was naturally more
        than one way to modify the particles…
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        By studying the characteristics of these technologies, he could reverse
        engineer the specific technology used by the encrypted particles. This
        was also the focus of the research. They were trying to reduce the scope
        of suspicion by using the encrypted particles' technology. Han Xiao did
        not conceal his footsteps and walked over in large strides. Only then
        did the experts realize that there was an outsider. Seeing that it was
        Han Xiao, they all bowed respectfully.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He looked up at the encrypted particles floating on the experiment table
        and waved his hand.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Alright, stop arguing. Let me see what's going on."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Please let us know if you need anything."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The group of experts had no objections and retreated to the side,
        obediently giving up the experiment table behind them.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Black Star was not only the strongest individual strength in the Galaxy
        that was on the same level as the three leaders, he was also one of the
        best scientists. These researchers had always admired Black Star, and a
        small portion of the people present were his worshippers. These normally
        esteemed high-level researchers were all willing to be his assistants.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao looked at the readings and studied the encrypted particles from
        head to toe. He quickly analyzed the data in his mind and locked onto a
        few technologies.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As far as he knew, these technologies seemed to be used by members of
        the Super Star Cluster Alliance. Of course, he could not rule out the
        possibility of other organizations imitating them.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        ‘According to normal judgment, the Super Star Cluster Alliance is now
        even more suspicious, but it could also be a deliberate framing… In this
        case, it's more like a traitor in the galactic society.'
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        With a thought, Han Xiao released his Mechanical Force and connected it
        to the encrypted particles. He then activated (Bold Explorer).
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Buzz!</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao's vision suddenly changed, and he arrived at a research
        institute with different styles. Many researchers were working.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        A huge device was spinning. Particles were opened in low dimensional
        space and recorded into information. Then, they were restored and turned
        into encrypted particles that were injected into three white cylindrical
        containers.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He could not control his vision and followed the three white tubes
        closely. The white tubes were placed into a suitcase and sent into a
        groove of a material transmission device.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The next moment, his vision turned once again, and he had already
        arrived at a secret underground base. He saw another material
        transmission device, and with a flash of light, the white suitcase was
        sent over. A few life forms walked up and opened it, revealing the white
        tubes inside.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This time, his vision changed again, and he came to a space in the
        universe. A blue and black wormhole opened up in front of him, and three
        white tubes were thrown in. They passed through the colorful space
        tunnel and flew out from the other end of the wormhole. Then, the three
        white tubes suddenly burst out with heat, releasing a wave of energy,
        and all the encrypted particles inside were thrown out.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In the last scene, a World Tree exploration team shrouded in green light
        appeared in the distance.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The illusion stopped, and Han Xiao's vision returned to normal.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "It seems like these encrypted particles appeared from nowhere till they
        were intercepted by the World Tree…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Han Xiao's eyes sparkled.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Although the illusion provided by (Bold Explorer) did not involve a
        specific location, Han Xiao was almost certain that this was a third
        party's doing. There was no other reason other than the researchers in
        the illusion were all unfamiliar species that he had never seen before.
        Among the people who received the white suitcase, there was a race that
        should have disappeared long ago.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "The Lorese people, the intelligent species of the Lore Civilization…
        The Lore Civilization, the loser of the exploration era, was destroyed
        by the three Universal Civilizations. It should have been exterminated…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao took out the information and started to think
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        From the looks of it, the Lore Civilization had survived, and their goal
        should be revenge. They were not fighting alone and had even found
        helpers. Those intelligent species had never appeared in the history of
        the three Universal Civilizations, so they should be foreign
        civilizations.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        According to the detailed information within the encrypted particles,
        this foreign civilization should have been lying in wait in the explored
        universe for many years without being discovered.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        ‘Tsk, another old enemy of the exploration era. The three Universal
        Civilizations are constantly paying their debts for their past deeds…'
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Han Xiao subconsciously rubbed his fingers.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In the World Tree War in his previous life, this foreign civilization
        did not appear and did not seem to have interfered with the direction of
        the war. Now, however, they took the initiative to backstab the three
        Universal Civilizations. Maybe it was because this foreign
        civilization's situation was different in different timelines, or maybe
        it was because the situation in his previous life did not require them
        to interfere… Of course, Han Xiao was not sure if this foreign
        civilization took action in his previous life. The players did not have
        the relevant information.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Seeing that the three Universal Civilizations have the upper hand, they
        want to destroy our strategy, shatter our advantage, and help the World
        Tree invade us… They want to take revenge on us, but they also want to
        take advantage of the situation. They want to hide in the dark and watch
        the tigers fight each other while they snipe for profits. Tsk, quite
        malicious."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao guessed the motive of the foreign civilization while thinking
        of a solution.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Although he had confirmed that it was a third party, he did not know
        their location, so he could not follow the clues. If he searched with
        great fanfare, it was very likely that the foreign civilizations would
        withdraw all their spies and cut off all clues.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Furthermore, without evidence, it would not be easy to convince the
        three big hooligans. Although with his position, even without evidence,
        the three Universal Civilizations' leaders would still take his words
        seriously, now that even he was suspected, the credibility would
        naturally be reduced. The three big leaders would at most be skeptical.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        [Information Form Obliteration) could see the connection threads, but
        this was a destructive ability. It could not see the specific situation
        and could not trace the source. Even if this batch of encrypted
        particles was wiped out, the World Tree's side most likely had others,
        and the situation could not be resolved. After all, this ability wiped
        out ‘individuals', not ‘concepts' and ‘collective body'. It would not be
        that if it killed one or two humans, the others would forget about the
        entire human race.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In fact, the effect of (Information Form Obliteration) was very
        ‘precise', and it would not have much effect on the Information Form of
        anything else other than the target's. Therefore, the effect of this
        move would be quite peculiar when it targeted the split parts of a whole
        body.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        If he used (Information Form Obliteration] on this part of the encrypted
        particles, Han Xiao estimated that the three leaders would remember that
        he had taken some things to study, but they would forget that he was
        studying the encrypted particles. Furthermore, the experts present would
        not remember what they were studying, and these machine readings would
        also be erased.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        If he ‘erased' the other encrypted particles that the three Universal
        Civilizations had intercepted, Han Xiao felt that the result would
        probably be that the three Universal Civilizations had forgotten about
        the existence of the encrypted particles, but remembered that
        ‘something' had exposed the presence of a spy leaking information. As
        for the World Tree, they would remember that they had given ‘something'
        to the three Universal Civilizations, but they would forget that they
        had handed over the encrypted particles. However, they would not forget
        about the encrypted particles in their hands.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao had made a hypothesis before. If he used (Information Form
        Obliteration) to deal with the entire World Tree Civilization, the
        reaction of the three Universal Civilizations would most likely not be
        ‘what have we been doing all these years', but ‘we defeated a Universal
        Civilization with difficulty, but we can't remember what that
        civilization is called'.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Therefore, (Information Form Obliteration] had a very good effect on
        individuals with different Information Form, such as living beings.
        However, when dealing with individuals with a large collective body
        (such as a grain of sand in a desert, a gun in a batch of standard
        firearms), the Information Form gap could be deduced by logic… For
        example, if the experts forgot what they were researching previously,
        but came to the experiment hall and saw others studying the encrypted
        particles, they could also deduce that they were probably researching
        this before.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, even if you used logic to deduce that, (Information Form
        Obliteration) was still in effect, you would subtly have memory
        deviations, quickly forget, subconsciously ignore, common sense errors,
        and so on. It was just like when you thought of something, you would
        suddenly forget it and would not be able to recall it no matter what.
        This kind of situation was not uncommon. It was also like when you
        believed that the temperature of a normal person's bath was eighty
        degrees instead of forty degrees, there would be a common-sense
        deviation that you would not be able to detect, or it would be like the
        legendary war of '99…
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        ‘In any case, I have to find a way to capture this group of lurkers.
        Currently, I can only use conventional methods to collect intelligence
        in secret. It's best to monitor the artificial intelligence in the
        quantum network… They will most likely continue to observe the follow-up
        effects of this ‘borrowing knife to kill others' tactic. Seeing that the
        three Universal Civilizations are suffering, they probably did not
        retreat.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Sigh, it would be great if we could retrieve the World Tree's
        Information Form Warning Network. This thing is simply a black
        technology to prevent the territory from being infiltrated.'
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao shook his head helplessly. Compared to the World Tree, the
        territories of the three Universal Civilizations were like a sieve.
        Other people could enter and exit as they wished, even leaving something
        behind. The three Universal Civilizations would not be able to discover
        it in a short period. It was simply the standard model of a victim.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">He stroked his chin and pondered.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The World Tree and the third party's goal was to cause internal strife
        in the galactic society, so the most important thing now was to not let
        the enemy's plan succeed. Since the infiltrators could not be found in a
        short time and the three Universal Civilizations' suspicions could not
        be dispelled, it seemed like they could only start with the suspects.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "It seems like the three Universal Civilizations are most suspicious of
        the Super Star Cluster Alliance, and they happen to be cooking other
        plans in secret. However, I have yet to find out what's going on… If
        this causes a misunderstanding between the two sides, I'm afraid both
        sides will suffer heavily."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Han Xiao was helpless.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In the past, he had always cheated the Super Star Cluster Alliance, and
        it was not the first time they had suffered for no reason. However, it
        was the opposite now. He had to think of a way to reduce their suspicion
        so that they would not become scapegoats…
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Indeed, one had to pay for everything they have done!

        In the next few days, the World Tree Army laid low and did not launch
        any attacks on the Flickering World border or the shallow layer
        dimensions. They did not exert any pressure, and the flames of war were
        briefly extinguished. However, the strategic command center of the three
        Universal Civilizations did not relax at all. The atmosphere was as
        though they were still fighting intensely, and they knew that this was
        only the calm before the storm.

      <p class="calibre3">
        The armies that were originally stationed in the various Star Fields for

        The encrypted particles had leaked the star maps of the entire explored

        Han Xiao sent most of the Mechanical Oracles to the main universe to
        increase the number of high-level combatants. Originally, the three
        Universal Civilizations had the upper hand in terms of individual
        strength, but if the World Tree invaded all the territories, the effect
        of the high-level combatants would be completely different from a
        frontal battle. The high flexibility would bring about a powerful
        destructive force, and the battlefront would be split into countless
        sections. As the defending party that had no choice but to surround and
        intercept the enemy, their Beyond Grade As would not be enough.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In addition to dealing with the changes in the situation, Han Xiao had
        also been secretly searching for the spies of the foreign civilizations
        in the past few days. It was a pity that he was searching for a needle
        in a haystack and did not find anything. However, he did have some
        results from his investigation of the Super Star Cluster Alliance.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "So, they want to take advantage of the intense battle and escape from
        the control of the three Universal Civilizations when they have no time
        to deal with other matters. They want to head to the unexplored universe
        and find a place to develop freely…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao looked at the information on the virtual screen with a strange
        expression. How badly had they been bullied by the three Universal
        Civilizations that they wanted to leave their home?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He could roughly understand the thoughts of the Super Star Cluster
        Alliance. Staying in the explored universe would only result in endless
        suppression, and they would forever be constrained by the three
        Universal Civilizations. No matter how much they developed, they would
        never be able to exceed these three ceilings.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        During the reshuffling of the structure due to the enemy invasion, the
        Super Star Cluster Alliance considered their future and made a decision.
        For their civilization to develop freely, they decided to take the risk
        and explore the unknown. This was understandable. After all, they were
        never on the same side as the three Universal Civilizations.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "This is bad. The World Tree's invasion is their chance to escape. If
        they really do that, it would be the same as admitting the suspicion.
        This was akin to having mud on the back of one's pants. Even if it was
        not sh*t, people would naturally assume it to be."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Han Xiao massaged his brows.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He had already told the three leaders about the result of the third
        party causing trouble and even pointed out the existence of the Lore
        Civilization. However, as expected, the three of them did not say that
        they did not believe it, but only accepted that this was one of the
        reasons. Unless there was conclusive evidence, they still had to find
        traitors.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Only when the battle becomes chaotic would the three Universal
        Civilizations not be able to spare energy in this, and the Super Star
        Cluster Alliance would be able to carry out their plan. However, it just
        so happened that someone leaked the information at this time. Such a
        coincidence? To be honest, if Han Xiao did not know the truth, and
        looked from the perspective of the three Universal Civilizations, even
        he would have thought that the Super Star Cluster Alliance was resolute
        and fierce, and it was definitely because they wanted to escape that
        they lured the World Tree to invade all territories.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In his previous life, the Super Star Cluster Alliance did not do this
        but stood on the galactic society's side and fought against the enemies
        together. This time, they made a completely different choice. Maybe it
        was because the time period was different, the upper echelons were
        different, and the logic of their decisions was different. Or maybe it
        was because their situation was slightly different from his previous
        life, most of it was because of the butterfly effect he brought. It was
        more likely that the Super Star Cluster Alliance had not seen the full
        power of the World Tree invasion like in his previous life and did not
        feel the true threat of this cosmic disaster, so they still felt that
        they could stay away from the flames of war and not die at the hands of
        the enemy…
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In other words, they had not been beaten by the World Tree.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "I have to convince the Super Star Cluster to cancel the escape plan.
        Otherwise, the internal division will be right in front of us. However,
        no matter how great my reputation is, the Super Star Cluster will not be
        convinced by my words."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Han Xiao pondered.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        On one hand, he did not want the Super Star Cluster to take the blame
        and allow the third party to go unpunished. On the other hand, the
        galactic society needed the Super Star Cluster's strength to resist the
        World Tree's invasion. As long as they were determined to fight, their
        combined strength could not be underestimated. They were also an
        important part of the combat power of the explored universe.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"I have to think of a way…"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        While he was pondering, an urgent internal message from the three
        Universal Civilizations popped up on the virtual screen. "Primeval Star
        River, Ancient Star Desert, Sea of Star Spirits, Blackhole Edge, Endless
        Nebula, Shattered Star Ring, and other Star Fields have all discovered
        traces of the World Tree fleet! Requesting reinforcements! Requesting
        reinforcements!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao sat up straight, and a cold light flashed in his eyes.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">They're here!</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In the Ancient Star Desert, blue wormholes formed one after another,
        forming a huge oval-shaped space crack. It was like God had cut open the
        curtain of the universe, leaving behind a blue scar.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Immediately after, a green light appeared in the enormous space crack.
        It grew brighter and larger, and finally turned into an overwhelming
        green tide pouring out!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The seemingly endless fleet of the World Tree crossed the border of the
        Flickering World and descended directly along the wormhole. The dense
        streams of hyperdrive light condensed into pillars of light and shot in
        all directions like a plague virus in the enemy's body, spreading in the
        blink of an eye.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Countless World Tree warriors revealed fanaticism on their faces as if
        they were holding a banquet. After being in a stalemate for so many
        years, they had finally made their way in and dismembered their prey! On
        the planets that the World Tree fleet passed by, there was a violent
        fluctuation in the space. The thick roots of the World Tree tore open
        space cracks like drilling through soil and extending out from the void
        into the planets like straws, drawing out dazzling energy visible to the
        naked eye.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The planet's crust softened and flowed into the roots of the World Tree
        like a liquid. The material of the planet's mantle and core was also
        swallowed in large mouthfuls. The planet slowly shriveled up and was
        rapidly approaching its end. Wherever the green tide passed, the stars
        slowly extinguished, and the planets gradually dissolved, leaving only
        death and desolation.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This reminded the World Tree warriors of the past. They roamed the
        endless universe, unrestrainedly tasting the delicious taste of the
        enemy's territory. They cut off pieces of meat from their still
        struggling prey and ate everything. After all, they were the best
        hunters in the universe, or even the only predator!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The same thing happened in many Star Fields at the same time.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In a hurry, the Galactic Alliance Army launched a counterattack with the
        local Star Systems and Star Cluster Civilizations. The flames of war
        spread across the explored universe.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The battlefront was divided into countless areas, and the World Tree
        experts finally had a place to use their strength. They were scattered
        all over the place, fully displaying the flexibility of high-level
        combatants. The Beyond Grade As of the three Universal Civilizations
        could no longer stay together, so they could only leave Aurora and go to
        different areas.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The sudden change scared countless galactic residents, and the situation
        turned around instantly. The panic that was suppressed in their hearts
        was released, and it erupted like a volcano, burning away their
        remaining rationality.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Ancestral Tree King looked into the distance. His vision seemed to
        have passed through the barriers of endless space and it locked onto the
        direction of the Central Galaxy. "Eat. Eat everything. Give us a feast,
        and we will give you despair."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In a certain army base in the Shattered Star Ring, the Black Star Army's
        guards were engaged in a fierce battle with the World Tree fleet. On the
        battlefield, there was a black tide formed by the mechanical soldiers,
        tearing apart the World Tree battleships one after another.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        On a planet not far away, hundreds of World Tree Roots had already been
        inserted into the planet's core, absorbing energy. In outer space, three
        Holy Tree Emissaries were chasing after two figures, and five streams of
        light collided time and time again.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Clang!</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Lothaire held a dagger in each hand, and his slash was as fast as
        lightning. His body was agile, and he moved back and forth between the
        three Holy Tree Emissaries. They fought intensely, and the silver dagger
        clashed with the laser and magic. It looked like he was unstoppable, but
        in reality, his entire body was covered in wounds. In the intense
        battle, he had to divert his attention to take care of Karlot, who was
        slightly weaker. It was unavoidable for him to show flaws.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Lothaire crossed his daggers and slashed out a bright light blade,
        forcing back the Mechanical Pugilist Holy Tree Emissary. A flash of
        light appeared in the corner of his eyes, and he dodged without
        hesitation. In an instant, a gorgeous high-level Arcane Light penetrated
        his waist, leaving a burning mark. "Protected your vital point? Your
        reactions are quite fast."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">The Mage Holy Tree Emissary spoke with regret.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Among the three Holy Tree Emissaries, two of them had never appeared on
        the battlefield before. They were all experts from other races who had
        been restraining themselves. It was not until they entered the territory
        of the three Universal Civilizations and split countless battlefronts
        that the World Tree activated the foreign experts to increase the size
        of their high-level combatants.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        On one hand, they were agile enough to move alone. Even if Black Star
        had the method to awaken the foreign experts, he would not be able to
        catch them all in one swoop. On the other hand, the World Tree was
        already desperate. As long as they could speed up their invasion, they
        did not care about losing some of their manpower. They were already
        mentally prepared for a portion of their experts to be wiped out by
        Black Star's (Information Form Obliteration).
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Lothaire's expression was tense. He pressed on the wound and used his
        energy to quickly heal it. The wound quickly formed a scab. He looked at
        his three opponents and felt a chill.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        His style of martial arts focused on dexterity, stealth, and
        assassination. He was not strong in a head-on battle, and it was even
        more disadvantageous when he was surrounded. At this point, he could not
        take it anymore.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Are you alright?" Karlot, who was on the side, also came over. He was
        also covered in wounds, and he was leaning back to back with Lothaire,
        and staring at his enemies. It had only been a few years since he
        entered the Beyond Grade A realm, and he was still in the process of
        activating (Everlasting Martial Path). His combat strength was still at
        the level of a new Beyond Grade A, and it was extremely difficult for
        him to fight. He might not even be able to defeat any of the enemies in
        a one-on-one battle.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The two of them were originally training here, but the World Tree
        suddenly attacked and dragged them into the flames of war. "I can still
        hold on for a while." Lothaire adjusted his breath, and the Pugilist
        flames climbed up his daggers again.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The five of them locked onto each other. Their bodies paused for a
        moment before suddenly bursting out at the same time. They charged
        forward and clashed again. Blade light, flames, and magic power shot
        out. The five streams of light were like five silk threads tangled
        together.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        All of a sudden, Lothaire's body paused, and he slashed out with his two
        daggers, shattering the Arcane Charge of the Mage Holy Tree Emissary.
        However, amidst the shattered light, the Mechanical Pugilist suddenly
        appeared, and he was thrown toward Lothaire by a hand formed from magic.
        Eight spider legs-like mechanical spears suddenly extended from the back
        of his mechanical suit, and the spears pierced through the protective
        flames and into Lothaire's body.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Crack!</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The silver daggers flashed, and the eight mechanical limbs were all cut
        off.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Lothaire retreated rapidly, controlling his muscles to squeeze out the
        broken spear tips in his body, leaving eight shallow wounds. These were
        nothing more than superficial wounds to him.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, just as he was about to continue attacking, his body suddenly
        stiffened. A dark green color suddenly appeared on his wound, and the
        flesh that was originally recovering suddenly began to fester.
        "Biological toxin ?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3"><b class="calibre5">eco</b></p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Lothaire's expression changed. He looked up and saw that the broken
        spear tips were leaking green liquid. He looked at it with his
        microscopic vision and realized that the green liquid was a group of
        dark green tiny molecular robots that carried powerful toxins.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Waves of intense pain exploded like a tsunami, and Lothaire's senses
        were suddenly messed up. It was as though he had lost control of his
        body, and he began to tremble uncontrollably. The cells in his body were
        being eroded. With a flash, the last Pugilist Holy Tree Emissary took
        the opportunity to join the battle. He held a sharp blade made of
        anti-regeneration alloy and stabbed Lothaire's neck from behind, wanting
        to remove his entire spine. Right at this moment, Karlot charged over
        from the side to stop this Pugilist Holy Tree Emissary. Unfortunately,
        he was a step too slow and could only throw a punch in an attempt to
        save him.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "A new Beyond Grade A wants to… hmm?!" The Pugilist Holy Tree Emissary
        originally wanted to kill Lothaire even at the cost of getting injured.
        However, just as Karlot's fist approached, a strong sense of danger
        exploded in his heart!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The flames around Karlot's body flowed like water, condensing at the tip
        of his fist. His strength was contained but not released, but the power
        of his fist rose steadily, like the Milky Way was turned upside down,
        the stars were shattered, and an intense sharpness burst out.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At this moment, a thunderous roar containing spiritual fluctuations
        exploded!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Martial Deity Fist&mdash;Galaxy Severance!"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The fist suddenly landed on the Pugilist Holy Tree Emissary's hastily
        raised arm, and a bright light burst forth, stealing everyone's vision!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Time seemed to freeze for a moment before it started to flow again.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The other two Holy Tree Emissaries regained their vision and hurriedly
        looked over, only to see that Karlot had already retreated to the side
        with Lothaire in his arms. Meanwhile, the Pugilist Holy Tree Emissary
        remained in place, still in a parry position, but did not move.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, the next moment, the body of the Pugilist Holy Tree Emissary
        cracked like porcelain and fell into pieces, eventually turning into
        dust and scattering in the galaxy.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Instant kill!</p>
      <p class="calibre3">"What move is this ?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The two remaining Holy Tree Emissaries were shocked. They could not
        believe their eyes. One of their comrades was killed just like that.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        It would be understandable if the other was a peak Beyond Grade A, but
        was this the power of a new Beyond Grade A ? Lothaire had a chance to
        catch his breath, and he suppressed the poison with difficulty. Seeing
        this, he could not help but widen his eyes. "You've already created that
        kind of fist technique?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Phew… Phew… No, I only created two stances. I'm still far from
        perfecting the Martial Deity Fist."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Karlot had expended a lot of energy. This punch contained all of his
        essence, energy, and spirit, and its power far exceeded his level. At
        this moment, his entire body was sore, and his stamina was almost
        depleted. He did not even have ten percent of his energy left.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        When he stepped into the Beyond Grade A realm, Karlot had some special
        insights, and he had an idea. He wanted to create a Pugilist style
        suitable for himself and named it ‘Martial Deity Fist'. He did not use
        this name because it was arrogant, but because it contained his
        expectations for himself, hoping to create the most amazing Beyond Grade
        A Fist Style.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        All these years, Karlot had been exploring and integrating all the
        knowledge he had, and he had only figured out two scattered stances. The
        power was extremely exaggerated, but the consumption was equally
        frightening. Even with his Beyond Grade A Pugilist foundation, he could
        only execute three to four moves. Lothaire looked at the enemy's corpse
        and said, "What a terrifying move. You've already surpassed me."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Do you want to learn? I can teach you."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Karlot smiled shyly.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The two of them thought that this Martial Deity Fist was very powerful,
        but if Han Xiao was here, he would be able to tell that although the
        Martial Deity Fist was very magical, it would not be able to unleash
        such great power when used by others. The truly powerful one was Karlot
        himself.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This was because the process of creating the Martial Deity Fist was also
        the stage where Karlot was able to master everything he had learned.
        During this process, he could almost comprehend a new talent every few
        days, three of which were extremely powerful.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        [Martial Saint's Strength]&mdash;When using any Pugilist skills, base
        power increased by 80% to 240%!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        [Martial Deity Fist's Ancestor]&mdash;When you use the "Martial Deity
        Fist" series, your base strength will increase by 100% to 300%!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        [One Punch Martial Deity)&ndash;Every time you use the skills of the
        "Martial Deity Fist" series to hit your opponent, you will be able to
        trigger a severe injury judgment / instant death judgment (the success
        rate depends on the power of the skill, the difference in level, energy
        level, attributes, and so on). If the judgment fails, an additional 50%
        to 150% damage will be dealt!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        With so many Pugilist talents, although Karlot was only a new Beyond
        Grade A, his explosive power was unbelievably strong. As long as he was
        lucky, it was even possible for him to instantly kill the enemy.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Bang! Bang!</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Karlot clenched his fists and looked at the two Holy Tree Emissaries. He
        said to Lothaire, "I still have some strength left. Continue, don't let
        them escape."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Alright." Lothaire gripped his daggers tightly.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        While many people were unaware, the face of the Pugilist was quietly
        forming.

        Chapter 1425: Attack and Plan<span hidden="" class="calibre1"> | </span>
      </h1>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Somewhere in the Sea of Star Spirits, a refugee planet had already been
        tightly bound by the roots of the World Tree. The soil, minerals, and
        forests all turned into streams of data, flowing into it. In the
        distance, the emergency refuge ship carrying the people of this planet
        was fleeing through the galaxy. A World Tree fleet was chasing after
        them, and the escort fleet of the Galactic Alliance Army was covering
        them as they escaped.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The two sides fought intensely, leaving traces of energy explosions
        everywhere they passed. The light reflected in the eyes of the fleeing
        citizens.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Ten figures with metallic luster dashed around in the escort fleet,
        firing psionic cannons and destroying spaceships one after another. They
        were the Machinery Apostles, and their master was in the main ship of
        the World Tree fleet. It was a Lord's Avatar controlling the mechanical
        army from afar.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, there was not a single Beyond Grade A in the escaping fleet.
        Thus, they could only use the battleship to block the advance of the
        mechanical apostles.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "The enemy has a Beyond Grade A Mechanic, and we urgently need
        high-level combatants to help!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The commander of the escort fleet looked at the one-sided situation and
        had no choice but to order the fleet to retreat while asking for help in
        the military channel.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The World Tree ignored their losses to send out a large number of Beyond
        Grade As, and their total number of high-level combatants exceeded that
        of the three Universal Civilizations in an instant. The entire force was
        mobilized, causing the three Universal Civilizations to not have
        sufficient Beyond Grade As, and they were unable to stop any World Tree
        Super.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The fleet that was escorting the evacuation of the civilians did not
        have any high-level combatants. When they met the World Tree fleet that
        had a Beyond Grade A Mechanic commander, they were immediately beaten
        black and blue.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Please continue to hold on for a while longer. We are sending out the
        available Beyond Grade As." The military intelligence's response
        immediately sounded in the channel.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The commander gritted his teeth and shouted loudly, ordering the fleet
        to continue attacking. However, the scale of their army was unable to
        change from quantitative to qualitative. The ten mechanical apostles led
        the army and devoured the starships like locusts.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Just as the number of casualties rose to a shocking number, a space on
        the battlefield opened up like a wave of ripples on water. Then, with a
        flash of light, a figure rushed out like a burning meteor and slammed
        into the nearest Mechanical Apostle, sending it flying.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Reinforcements are here!"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The commander immediately looked at the Beyond Grade As who had come to
        reinforce them.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Upon seeing this person's appearance, the joy on the commander's face
        froze.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Why is it you?!"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Why do you sound so disappointed? I'm the only one who's free now. If
        you don't want to, I'm leaving!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Kohler was furious.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        What's wrong with you, little brother? I came to support you, and you're
        still looking down on me?!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "…I'll leave the enemy's Mechanic Super to you. My troops will support
        you from the side." The commander smiled bitterly and could only express
        his cooperation. Kohler snorted and charged at the ten mechanical
        apostles.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The soldiers looked over with hope. However, within a few minutes, the
        imposing Kohler was crushed by the combined attacks of ten mechanical
        apostles.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">II</p>
      <p class="calibre3">II</p>
      <p class="calibre3">The commander covered his face.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The internal rumors were not false. Kohler was indeed the weakest among
        the Beyond Grade As.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "I don't want to despise you either, but you're too much. I gave you a
        chance, but you can't even take care of the apostles, let alone a real
        battle. I don't even like to use you when playing Wayne Cards…" Kohler
        dodged a few psionic beams and managed to return a punch. He sent a
        mechanical apostle flying and shouted in the channel, "What are you
        waiting for? I've helped you stall the enemy. Continue asking for help!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Your tactical role is only to stall…</p>
      <p class="calibre3">The commander cursed silently.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Just as he was about to resume his call for reinforcements, a wormhole
        suddenly opened not far away.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        A Mechanical Lifeform flew out from within. Heavy mechanical armor
        covered its body, and every part of its body was equipped with high-tech
        melee weapons. It was armed to the teeth, and there were two wing-shaped
        vector thrusters erected on its back like two chess pieces. It was one
        of the Black Star Mechanical Oracles who had received orders to
        reinforce the various battlefronts in the universe, Heaven-Suppressing
        Banner.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Black Star's elite troops are here!" Kohler was overjoyed and quickly
        waved. "Allies! Switch!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Electric arcs flashed across the Heaven-Suppressing Banner's eyes, and
        his thrusters shot out streams of light. He instantly accelerated and
        rushed into the battle.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The ten Mechanical Apostles detected a strong energy reaction.
        Immediately, eight of them set off to meet the Heaven-Suppressing
        Banner, leaving only two to hold Kohler back.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        A dense psionic cannon beam shot out, and the arm of the
        Heaven-Suppressing Banner turned into a heavy shield. It suddenly pushed
        forward, and a bright complicated energy circuit appeared on the shield.
        A thick psionic shield popped out, blocking the concentrated
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">fire.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Amidst the bombardment, the distance between the two sides rapidly
        shortened. A mechanical apostle popped out a few wrist blades and headed
        straight for the energy core of the Heaven-Suppressing Banner. However,
        the Heaven-Suppressing Banner only turned around lightly and avoided the
        attack. The moment it passed by, he swiped at his waist, and a
        mechanical axe immediately unfolded, slashing out like a thunderbolt.
        The blade light instantly flashed past the mechanical apostle's body.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The next moment, the two halves of the Mechanical Apostle flew out due
        to inertia. The cut was smooth, and countless precise parts could be
        seen. The energy core that had been accurately cut in the center jumped
        slightly, and then exploded!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        A huge explosion lit up behind the Heaven-Suppressing Banner, reflecting
        on its cold alloy shell.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Heaven-Suppressing Banner was the master of close combat weapons
        among the Mechanical Oracles. All kinds of weapons appeared like magic,
        constantly changing and dealing with the Mechanical Apostles with ease.
        Not long after, it killed more than half of the Mechanical Apostles like
        cutting vegetables. It was completely different from the scene Kohler
        showed. Suddenly, the Heaven-Suppressing Banner stomped on the ground,
        and an energy shockwave exploded behind him. He turned into a shooting
        star and rushed toward the World Tree fleet.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The axe slashed out beams of light, cutting the World Tree spaceship in
        half. In just a few blinks of the eye, the Heaven-Suppressing Banner had
        already arrived in front of the main ship, and the huge axe surrounded
        by golden lightning hacked down. A thick bolt of golden lightning shot
        out from the axe, instantly shattering the shield of the main ship and
        melting through the armor. The entire ship exploded, and dazzling light
        spread out!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Two figures, one chasing and one escaping, rushed out of the explosion.
        The Lord's Avatar of the Mechanic Army Head was running in front, and
        the Heaven-Suppressing Banner was chasing after it. After exchanging a
        few blows, the Heaven-Suppressing Banner cleaved the enemy's head in
        half with a swing of the axe. Electric arcs exploded, and the power
        contained in the body disappeared instantly. The Lord's Descent had
        already been destroyed by him, and he looked like he had taken the head
        of an enemy general. With the current strength of the Mechanical Oracle,
        ordinary Beyond Grade As were no match for it at all. Their strength was
        on a completely different level from the Mechanical Apostle stage, and
        it would not be a problem for them to hold their own in battles against
        Beyond Grade As.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The high-level combatants of the enemy were eliminated, and the escort
        fleet immediately stopped their retreat.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Heaven-Suppressing Banner did not continue to help. It reached out
        to remove the head of the enemy's Lord's Avatar, before hanging it on
        its waist as a trophy. Just as he was about to open the wormhole and
        leave, Kohler flew over and gave him a thumbs up.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Not bad. We've finally defeated this powerful opponent."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "When did we join forces? Were you fighting just now?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Heaven-Suppressing Banner tilted its head in confusion.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "I helped you restrain two mechanical apostles. Without me, you would
        have been in danger." Kohler patted his chest and said, "Black Star and
        I are good friends after all. Protecting his mechanical apostles is just
        a matter of convenience. You don't have to thank me."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        While the Heaven-Suppressing Banner was still calculating the logic
        behind this sentence, Han Xiao's annoyed voice sounded in the channel.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Shut up. You're really a noob."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Oh, so you're here." Kohler laughed without any shame. "I was just
        joking."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Hehe." Han Xiao curled his lips. "Heaven-Suppressing Banner, ignore
        him. Continue your mission."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Heaven-Suppressing Banner tilted its head, before ignoring Kohler.
        It opened the wormhole and went to reinforce the other battlefronts
        according to Han Xiao's orders.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Primeval Star River, Mechanical Race territory.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The endless World Tree army was attacking the Mechanical Race's defense
        line, and the two fleets were already locked in battle.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        On the main planet of the Mechanical Race, Manison and Nilfgadi's Lord's
        Avatar stood at the highest point and looked up at the sky.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Mechanical Race troops behind him did not panic at all. Instead,
        they looked at the backs of the two generations of Mechanical Race
        leaders with fanaticism.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "The Mechanical Race is the first target of the World Tree. Do they
        think we're easy to deal with? We're not easy to bully." Nilfgadi stood
        with his arms crossed.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "You don't have the right to say that. All these years, the Mechanical
        Race was able to develop to its current state because of me. It has
        nothing to do with you," Manison said calmly.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Nilfgadi snorted but did not retort. He slowly said, "I didn't expect us
        to fight together under such circumstances."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "I know you don't like me, but don't worry, this battle won't take
        long."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Manison raised his hands slightly.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Boom!</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        All the planets in the Mechanical Race territory started buzzing, as
        though countless things were about to break out of the ground.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "After accumulating for so long, let the world see the strength of the
        Mechanical Race."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Manison's eyes flashed, and his tone was cold.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Listen to my command, leave no one alive!"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Boom!</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        A seemingly endless mechanical army flew out from the planets one after
        another, covering the sky and earth as they welcomed the World Tree
        fleet.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"It's starting, it's starting…"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Many hidden Star Alliance observers looked at the chaos in the various
        Star Fields and could not help but smile.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "The World Tree invaded in one night. Clearly, our intelligence has come
        in handy. Very good! Very good!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Observer Captain clenched his fists with a ferocious expression on
        his face, gleeful at having gotten his revenge.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This time, the result of using someone else to do the dirty work was
        very obvious. It successfully turned the stalemate into a chaotic
        battle. This was what the Star Alliance wanted to see. It would be best
        if both sides were heavily injured.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "This way, even if the three Universal Civilizations can fight the World
        Tree Civilization, it would be difficult to stop their territories from
        being devoured step by step. If this continues, the three Universal
        Civilizations would be defeated sooner or later. It might just take
        decades, or maybe centuries," someone said excitedly.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">The Observer Captain sneered.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Heh, this is only the first wave. In my opinion, the three Universal
        Civilizations won't be able to last that long. According to the
        deductions of the upper echelons, it's very likely that the World Tree
        will use the information we leaked to fan the internal suspicions of the
        three Universal Civilizations and disintegrate their fighting spirit.
        From the start of the war until now, the morale and faith of the three
        Universal Civilizations have been supported by belief. When this
        momentum is gone, it will be their defeat."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As he spoke, a look of longing appeared in his eyes, as if he could see
        the future of the galactic society. "The three Universal Civilizations
        have been high and mighty for too long. It's time for them to taste the
        feeling of their homeland and their nation being destroyed! Just like us
        back then!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        On the other side, the Super Star Cluster Alliance.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The sudden full-scale invasion of the World Tree gave the Super Star
        Cluster Alliance a shock.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Although the Super Star Cluster Alliance had received some news from the
        three Universal Civilizations over the past few days, they had only
        asked them to strengthen their internal defenses. They did not mention
        anything about the inside story, so the Super Star Cluster Alliance did
        not know anything about the situation of the information being leaked.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The various Star Fields were attacked, and the Super Star Cluster
        Civilizations were naturally targeted as well. However, compared to the
        intense battles in the other Star Fields, the size of the World Tree
        fleet that invaded the Super Star Cluster Civilization was very small,
        as though it was just a formality.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Super Star Cluster Civilization thought that the World Tree did not
        want to bite them in the first wave of attacks, they were glad.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At this moment, an important meeting was being held in the conference
        room.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "…Everyone, the three Universal Civilizations have lost their border
        line of defense, and the World Tree has completely invaded. Let's put
        this aside for now. The current situation is developing in the direction
        we're looking forward to. A once in a lifetime opportunity has appeared
        in front of us, and we definitely can't miss it. I think we can consider
        officially starting the ‘Great Relocation' plan." The leader of the Star
        Arc Civilization said with a deep voice. Everyone was whispering and
        discussing, their faces filled with joy.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Everyone felt that it was very magical. They could only passively wait
        for the right time, hoping for the chaotic battle to break out, but they
        did not expect the opportunity to come so suddenly. It was like the
        Goddess of Luck was on their side.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Seconded."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "I agree." Everyone voted one after another. They had been waiting for
        this opportunity for too long, and there were very few objections. Now
        that the World Tree had successfully invaded, it was tearing apart the
        flesh and blood of the explored universe every second. With the three
        Universal Civilizations having failed, they would only be devoured if
        they stayed here.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        No one wanted to lose everything, so they decided to give up the
        territory that would fall sooner or later and leave as soon as possible
        to preserve their strength.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Seeing this, the leader of the Star Arc nodded, took a deep breath, and
        said, "It seems like everyone's opinion is rather unified. Then it's
        decided. Let the three Universal Civilizations and the World Tree drag
        it out for a while longer. After we officially enter a stalemate, we'll
        start the plan immediately!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As he spoke, he paused before continuing solemnly. "Everyone, once we
        take this path, there will be no turning back. For the future of our
        civilization, we can no longer live under someone else's roof.".
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Everyone nodded slowly.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The experience of being bullied by the three Universal Civilizations
        over the years flashed through their minds, making them more determined.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, just as the leader was about to give a speech to strengthen his
        resolve, a communication request from Han Xiao suddenly popped up on the
        virtual screen. "Black Star? He wants to see us at this time?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The eyes of the upper echelons of the civilizations froze, and their
        nerves tightened.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As the saying went, they had a guilty conscience. Although their escape
        was a result of careful consideration, they were considered deserters in
        the war. Therefore, just seeing Han Xiao's name made them feel an
        invisible pressure.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The leader raised his hand and gestured for everyone to calm down.

      </h1>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao's remote projection landed in the conference room. He looked
        around and saw the expressions of all the Super Star Cluster
        Civilizations' leaders. He could not help but smile and joke.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Everyone, what were you talking about? The atmosphere is so tense."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "We're talking about how to deal with the World Tree's invasion," the
        Star Arc Leader said.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Is that so? But from what I know, the World Tree Civilization's army
        did not harass your territory much. Most of your troops are still on
        standby." Han Xiao shrugged.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "The entire galactic society is united against a common enemy. If the
        other regions are attacked, it also affects our safety. As long as our
        homeland is safe, we will naturally help," the Star Arc Leader said.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao's expression changed. "It's really strange of you to say that."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "The World Tree has invaded. We are already in the same boat," The Star
        Arc Leader nodded and said with a solemn tone. "If that's what you
        think, that would be best."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao raised his brows. He knew that the words the Star Arc Leader
        was saying were mostly empty and not sincere. A leader of the Super Star
        Cluster coughed and
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">said,</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Your Excellency Black Star, are you looking for us to discuss the World
        Tree invasion?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao looked at him and nodded. "You can say that, but I am here
        mainly for you guys."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Everyone exchanged looks. The Star Arc Leader said, "I hope you can
        explain it clearly."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao raised his arms and said casually, "The World Tree invasion is
        already a fact. How much do you know about the cause of this?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "We don't know the inside story. The World Tree was originally separated
        from the Flickering World by the three Universal Civilizations, and the
        situation was very stable. However, the enemy suddenly launched a
        full-scale invasion. They must have used some method to obtain our
        intelligence, but we don't understand how they did it." The Star Arc
        leader frowned and shook his head.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "I can tell you the inside story. This is not the World Tree taking an
        initiative. Someone deliberately leaked the information about the
        explored universe, daringly colluding with the enemy. This kind of
        action is like opening the border, inviting the World Tree in to burn,
        kill, and loot!" Han Xiao's tone was heavy.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As soon as he said that, the expressions of the Super Star Cluster upper
        echelons changed. Surprise, shock, disbelief, and other emotions
        appeared in their eyes.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Star Arc leader's eyes were filled with shock. He emphasized, "You
        mean there's a traitor in the galactic society ?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "That's right." Han Xiao nodded slowly and said softly, "We're still
        investigating the identity of the traitor."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        There was a slight commotion in the room. Everyone was whispering and
        discussing.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">The Star Arc Civilization was also confused.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "To be able to pass the intelligence to the World Tree, they must have
        quite good technical strength. They chose to betray us in such a
        dangerous situation. What are they after…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, halfway through his sentence, he suddenly paused and looked up
        at the expressionless Han Xiao.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The upper echelons also snapped back to reality. They had all realized
        Han Xiao's true intentions, and their expressions changed.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Wait a minute, Black Star came to our door at this time and purposely
        brought up this topic. Does he think we're the traitors who leaked the
        information ?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Of course, the Super Star Cluster Alliance had always been at odds with
        the three Universal Civilizations and was the biggest suspect, but this
        matter had nothing to do with them!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Are you suspecting us !" The Star Arc Leader's eyes widened.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao looked around and did not reply directly. Instead, he summoned
        a virtual screen and said,
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "According to the information I've found, you guys set up a plan called
        ‘Great Relocation Plan' more than ten years ago. The specific content is
        probably to take all the people and resources and leave the explored
        universe while the war is still ongoing to find another territory. This
        plan needs an opportunity, and only when the three Universal
        Civilizations are at a stalemate with the World Tree will you have a
        chance…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The upper echelons of the Super Star Cluster became even more solemn.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        They had thought that this plan was rather secretive. Gathering the
        people and resources was for the sake of war in name only. On the
        surface, it seemed like they had a reasonable motive. At most, the
        others would think that they were leaving a way out if the war failed,
        and they would not think that they were planning to run away.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "You already know… It's no wonder. With your ability, as long as you're
        suspicious of us, it won't be difficult for you to find these things."
        The Star Arc Leader was shocked, but when he thought of Han Xiao's
        ability, he accepted reality and said helplessly, "So, you think that we
        deliberately lured the World Tree into an all-out invasion to mess up
        the situation and make it easier to retreat?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"What do you think?" Han Xiao tilted his head.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Hearing this, everyone knew that Han Xiao was probably here to condemn
        them. The Star Arc Leader gritted his teeth and said, "I know you think
        we have a motive, but we did not do this. We are not traitors!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Although they wanted to escape, they did not want to become traitors.
        Otherwise, if they were targeted by the three Universal Civilizations,
        there would definitely be many twists and turns in the ‘Great Relocation
        Plan'. The three Universal Civilizations would not allow a ‘traitor'
        like them to escape easily.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "What evidence do you have to prove that you didn't do it?" Han Xiao
        said emotionlessly.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Hearing this, the Star Arc Leader's thoughts raced, but his mind was in
        a mess. He could not think of any reason to prove that this matter had
        nothing to do with them. How much evidence did he need?!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, before he could reply, Han Xiao continued.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Maybe this wasn't your idea, but can you guarantee that this wasn't
        done by one of the civilizations present here?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Star Arc leader was stunned, and his expression changed. He knew
        that Han Xiao was right. He could only guarantee that he was not a
        traitor, but he could not guarantee that the other Super Star Cluster
        civilizations would not do anything in private.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He slowly turned his head and looked at the other members of the
        alliance with a questioning look in his eyes. Everyone understood what
        he meant and spoke.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"It's not me, I didn't do it!"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "It's not me either. I don't know anything about this!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Very soon, the Star Arc Leader looked at the last person. He remembered
        that during the meeting some time ago, it was this leader of the Super
        Star Cluster who suggested helping the World Tree.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The leader of this civilization was furious. "What are you looking at me
        for ? I didn't do it! We're all in this together, I won't ignore the
        collective interests of the alliance!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Star Arc Leader gritted his teeth and looked at Han Xiao. "As you
        can see, this has nothing to do with us…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao did not say anything. He only tilted his head and looked at the
        Star Arc Leader with a strange gaze as if saying ‘are you joking with
        me?'
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Seeing this, the Star Arc Leader fell silent.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He also knew that no one would admit it if he asked this question. It
        was ridiculous for everyone to deny it together. It was not convincing
        at all. No one knew if the members of the alliance were lying.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, the Star Arc Leader knew very well that no matter if it was
        done by a member of the Super Star Cluster, they definitely could not
        admit it. Otherwise, they would become ‘traitors'.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao narrowed his eyes and said in a more serious tone, "Don't say I
        didn't warn you. I'll give you one more chance. Are you sure you didn't
        do it?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Black Star, we can't produce any evidence at the moment, but we really
        didn't do it," the Star Arc Leader said anxiously.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Alright, I trust you guys."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "I hope you won't jump to conclusions. If you keep watching us, the real
        traitor will escape. I…" The Star Arc leader subconsciously trailed off
        before suddenly raising his voice." Wait, you believe us ?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He had just racked his brains to convince Han Xiao, but he did not
        expect Han Xiao to change his mind before he could even use his
        justifications.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, at this moment, Han Xiao spoke again. "However, it's useless
        for me to believe you. The three Universal Civilizations have to believe
        you. You have to find a way to prove your innocence."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"You mean…"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "It is natural for you to stay and fight hard." Han Xiao spread out his
        hands and said, "Think about it, the three Universal Civilizations are
        suspecting a traitor. The moment you leave, you'll confirm your identity
        as a traitor. The only way is to give up on your so-called relocation
        plan and focus on fighting the World Tree. Only then can you clear the
        suspicion."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Hearing this, the eyes of many Super Star Cluster Civilizations' leaders
        narrowed.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Star Arc Leader frowned and no longer panicked. He slowly said,
        "Your Excellency Black Star, I'm afraid this is your true purpose for
        coming, isn't it?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He was not an idiot, and he immediately realized Han Xiao's true goal.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        There were priorities in everything. The Super Star Cluster Alliance did
        not want to become traitors, but the relocation plan was more important.
        They would not give up the migration just to prove that they were not
        traitors.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Star Arc Leader even suspected that the so-called traitor was just
        an excuse that Han Xiao came up with after discovering their relocation
        plan.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao did not think much of it. He smiled and said casually, "Hehe, I
        know what you guys are thinking. Traitors really exist, and the three
        Universal Civilizations suspecting you guys is also true. However, I
        never thought that you guys were traitors." "Why do you think so?" The
        Star Arc Leader was curious.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "We've known each other for decades. I know the style of your
        decision-makers quite well. In fact, given your situation, the
        possibility of you daring to collude with the enemy is quite low.
        However, because of your past history, you're the most suspicious. This
        is very similar to framing someone. My intuition tells me that this has
        little to do with you… Of course, this doesn't mean that you're not
        suspicious. I can't confirm if you're doing the opposite."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao did not plan to eliminate all the pressure on the Super Star
        Cluster, so he did not reveal (Bold Explorer] to them.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao knew that the Super Star Cluster Alliance would not give up on
        the relocation plan so easily. He planned to have this talk to use the
        suspicion of traitors as an excuse at the start. He only wanted to make
        the Super Star Cluster Alliance nervous and understand the situation.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "It seems like even though your big picture has been destroyed, you
        still have your rationality." The Star Arc leader had mixed feelings. He
        nodded and said, "I really don't know about the traitor, but we can't
        give up on the relocation plan and stay behind to fight. Since you've
        found the information, you should know how important this plan is to
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">us."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao nodded and said, "The existence of the three Universal
        Civilizations has limited your development. For many years, they have
        been using all kinds of excuses to suppress you and prevent you from
        entering the era of technological explosion. The top talents and
        resources of the galactic society have all flowed to them, and as this
        continued to accumulate, the gap between the two of you became larger
        and larger…" "That's right! Thinking back, when the exploration era war
        had just ended, the three Universal Civilizations set the order. They
        did not have the strength to dominate all the civilizations back then,
        but now? So many years have passed, and they are enjoying the best
        resources and the biggest development dividend in the entire galactic
        society. There is already a generational difference in our technologies…
        Now, we still have some ability to resist, but the longer we wait, the
        bigger the gap. Sooner or later, we will completely lose the
        qualifications to challenge the three Universal Civilizations, and we
        will only become servants."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        A Super Star Cluster leader said with a helpless tone.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Star Arc Leader nodded and added, "It is precisely because we can
        see the distant future, that we have to constantly search for
        opportunities to change our fate while we can still resist. The
        Flickering World was an attempt, but it failed. The migration now is a
        better opportunity, and we will not give up." "I understand your appeal,
        truly I do… but with all due respect, what you're doing is just a slow
        death. What you're thinking of being mutually tied down is only
        superficial, thinking that you'll be safe once you leave the war zone.
        You have nowhere to run. After the World Tree destroys the three
        Universal Civilizations, they will definitely find you. They have
        extraordinary abilities in the Information Form aspect…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao explained the Information Form ability of the World Tree in
        detail, ensuring that everyone present knew the true situation. He then
        paused and continued,
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Therefore, your only way out is to stay and destroy the World Tree
        Civilization with us… This is a very simple choice. This way, your
        development might not be free, but at least your civilization can
        survive."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The leaders of the Super Star Cluster looked at each other and discussed
        softly. The Star Arc leader pondered for a while before slowly saying,
        "For us to send our troops into the battlefield, you have put in a lot
        of effort. You even personally acted as a lobbyist… Let's assume what
        you said is the truth, but I have a concern that needs your answer."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Speak."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Will the three Universal Civilizations let us go so easily?" The Star
        Arc leader leaned forward and asked, "Let me make myself clear. If we
        defeat the World Tree and win back peace, how can you guarantee that the
        three Universal Civilizations won't settle the score afterward? How can
        you guarantee that they won't give us the identity of ‘traitors' and
        attack us rightfully?".
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Everyone stared at Han Xiao with a forceful gaze. This was not the first
        time the three Universal Civilizations had used ‘groundless' tactics on
        them. Therefore, the Super Star Cluster Alliance did not have any hope
        of getting rid of the suspicion. Whether or not they were ‘traitors'
        would still depend on what the three Universal Civilizations said. If
        they were to be labeled as ‘colluding with the enemy' after this, they
        would not be able to turn the tables and might even face a disaster.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Regarding that…" Han Xiao stroked his chin and said calmly," If we win
        this war and you guys don't leave, I can stand on your side and prevent
        the three Universal Civilizations from using this method. I will also
        try my best to help you break the development restrictions of the three
        Universal Civilizations so that you guys don't have to abandon your
        homeland to have a chance to develop freely.".
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "You?" The Star Arc Leader narrowed his eyes. "You might have such an
        organization, but why are you doing this?".
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Don't forget, war is a huge reshuffle. The structure of the three
        Universal Civilizations will definitely be overturned after the war.
        It's rare for the three Universal Civilizations to weaken, and they will
        lose their firm control. This is the best time to change things… Also,
        helping you guys is also helping myself. Without the invasion of foreign
        enemies, we will all be the eyesores of the three Universal
        Civilizations. We have a lot of room for cooperation." Han Xiao said
        slowly.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">The Star Arc Leader did not budge.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Sounds good, but how can you guarantee that you won't go back on your
        word like before? You have to know that your reputation isn't too good."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "I don't need to promise anyone," Han Xiao said casually. "I'm just
        telling you which path is of death and which path is of life. I helped
        you analyze the pros and cons and gave you a better choice, but I can't
        make decisions for you."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "What if we don't accept your suggestion?" The Star Arc Leader said with
        a solemn tone.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "If you insist, I will express my regret. Without the armed forces of
        the Super Star Cluster, our pressure will be greater, and our losses
        will be more exaggerated. However, our chances of winning are still very
        high."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao stroked his chin, paused, and said softly, "As for you guys… do
        I need to explain what will happen to deserters? With me around, we will
        be able to find you no matter how far you run. Don't blame me when the
        time comes. I've given you guys a chance."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Everyone's expression changed as they heard the blatant threat.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Black Star!" one of the Modo Civilization's leaders shouted. "We know
        that you're very powerful. Perhaps no one is your match in individual
        strength level, but do you really think that you're invincible after
        entering the Transcendent Grade? Do you think you can influence the
        decisions of so many civilizations ?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, Han Xiao shook his head and said calmly, "No, there's no such
        thing as true invincibility in the world. The so-called invincibility is
        only invincible in the current technological level environment, and the
        development of the world is dynamic. As the times change and the
        civilizations progress, more new technologies will appear. Maybe one
        day, all the principles of the Space Wonders will be discovered, and the
        Transcendents will no longer be unbeatable. Maybe it would even be
        possible to mass-produce Beyond Grade As and Transcendents. Any
        individual achievements that feel unbelievable now will eventually be
        duplicated by the collective civilizations, resulting in fission."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Everyone was stunned. They had thought that Han Xiao would refute, but
        they did not expect him to agree. They did not know how to respond. They
        thought that Han Xiao was trying to ease the atmosphere and take back
        his threat.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, the next moment, they knew they were wrong.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Han Xiao looked at everyone and said coldly,</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "However, those things will only happen in the future. At least in the
        foreseeable future, I am an unbeatable existence! You can see my words
        as a threat, or as an ultimatum. Anyway, do your best and don't make a
        choice that disappoints me. Otherwise, I don't mind destroying all the
        civilizations here. At that time, you will know that I'm more dangerous
        than the World Tree!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Everyone in the room fell silent.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After a while, the Star Arc Leader seemed to have made a decision.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "If the situation is as you say, we can temporarily put aside the
        relocation plan and send more troops to participate in the war. However,
        if the losses are too great, we will definitely evacuate. No matter how
        much you threaten us, it will be useless."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao's expression returned to normal, and he nodded.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "That's enough. You will know in the future that this is a wise choice."

        Chapter 1427: Wuornos' Sensation<span hidden="" class="calibre1">

        </span>
      </h1>
      <p class="calibre3">In the shallow layer dimensional base.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao turned off the communicator and deactivated the remote
        projection. He rubbed his forehead and closed his eyes for a while
        before opening them again. "The Super Star Cluster has reached a
        consensus that they will not cause any trouble for the time being."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Han Xiao heaved a sigh of relief.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He tried to reason with them, analyzed the situation for them,
        threatened them, and tempted them. In the end, he finally managed to
        persuade them back.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Of course, this was only a temporary consensus. The Super Star Cluster
        Alliance did not agree to give up on migrating and was only willing to
        stay and watch, and increase the support for a while longer. However,
        this was enough. If the Super Star Cluster Alliance did not give him
        face and ran away, even if he could make the Super Star Cluster Alliance
        pay the price afterward, he would not be able to stop the negative chain
        reaction in the war.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Currently, the armed forces of the explored universe were not lacking,
        and the internal division had temporarily disappeared before it even
        started. The Super Star Cluster Alliance would not become a ‘traitor'
        for the time being
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Damn it, the galactic society is indeed carried by me!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao shook his head. He opened the real-time military star map of
        the explored universe, and areas appeared in front of him, blue in
        color. Inside the various Star Fields, green spots were appearing,
        expanding at an extremely slow speed. This represented the invasion
        range of the World Tree.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "The World Tree has great momentum, but the territory of the three
        Universal Civilizations is too large, and even if the World Tree
        blossoms more, its invasion will still be slow. Although the battle is
        intense, the threat in the short term is still low."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Han Xiao analyzed.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        A sudden change in the situation would more or less affect the
        mentality. The three Universal Civilizations were a little flustered
        when dealing with this, but Han Xiao still maintained his calm. He
        ignored the anxiety of the territories being continuously devoured and
        calmly judged the situation. After all, he had seen worse situations in
        his previous life, so this small situation could not scare him.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        No matter how strong the World Tree was, it had to be eating slowly. It
        couldn't become fat in one bite. Furthermore, the resistance of the
        Galactic Alliance Army made it very difficult for it to ‘feed'.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In comparison, Han Xiao felt that the biggest effect of the World Tree's
        full invasion was firstly a blow to the people and morale of the
        galactic society, and secondly, it affected their resource production
        and productivity.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        According to the information that was leaked, as well as his experience
        from his previous life, Han Xiao could guess the World Tree's priority
        targets. The military factories and resource planets of the various
        organizations were definitely the first choices, which would reduce the
        speed of the three Universal Civilizations' troops mobilization.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Second would be the mother planets of some Star System or Star Cluster
        civilizations, governance planets, and refuge planets with large
        populations. This way, they could cause panic and internal chaos in the
        galactic society. The World Tree had invaded many civilizations, so it
        was clear about this trick.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Then, there were the important bases of some Beyond Grade A races and
        private organizations. Destroying them would cut off the wings of the
        three Universal Civilizations.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Of course, as the core of the galactic society, the Central Galaxy was
        the most important target. However, Han Xiao guessed that the World Tree
        would most likely not attack it for the time being because the Central
        Galaxy would be heavily guarded. Once they invaded, a large group battle
        would break out, similar to the border war.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The World Tree now had many space coordinates, and with such an
        advantage, it should not be willing to continue fighting with the
        low-efficiency frontal attack method. Instead, it chose to strike the
        weakest areas and focus on continuous harassment, displaying its high
        mobility and advantage in sustaining war with war.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "These are all areas that need to be protected. After this battle, I
        wonder how many more desolate universe belts there will be… It's a pity
        that the World Tree's mechanism is too perverse. Otherwise, I could have
        given it a taste of its own medicine.'
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Han Xiao was a little helpless.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        With his individual strength, he could go to the World Tree territory
        and make a scene. However, more than ten years ago, he had learned a lot
        of information from the foreign experts of the World Tree. The World
        Tree's base could be retracted into its body at any time, and it could
        pack up and run away. There was not much use in harassing them as they
        could just move to another place. This would not affect the enemy's
        productivity much, because the World Tree itself was the largest
        military factory. It could directly convert resources inside, and there
        was no need to build countless factories like normal civilizations.
        Otherwise, Han Xiao would not think that it was a complementing target
        to (Virtual Creation (Pseudo)]. Furthermore, the Blessed Races of the
        World Tree were eyeing the Pivotal Snake. Han Xiao did not want to leave
        the shallow layer dimensions. Even if he had to reinforce the main
        universe, he would only send out a portion of the Mechanical Oracles.
        His main body would remain in the secondary dimensions to guard his
        ‘home'.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The World Tree was not willing to sit back and do nothing. Apart from
        invading the territory of the three Universal Civilizations, it would
        not give up on killing the Pivotal Snake. He did not know what the other
        party's plan was, so he had to be careful. "However, although it's not
        very useful, it's not bad to be able to give them trouble. With my
        current strength, I don't have to worry about being besieged on a large
        scale as I did in the past. Wouldn't it be even greater if they get
        agitated and fight me head-on?" Han Xiao felt that it was worth a try.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Arcane Church, Temple of Ten Thousand Gods.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Wuornos walked slowly in the corridor formed by tall God sculptures of
        different shapes and sizes, holding a ball of spiritual light in his
        hand. Every time he walked in front of a God sculpture, he would use the
        corresponding simple ceremony to perform a ritual that was neither too
        fast nor too slow. He then flicked the spiritual light into the body of
        the statue, looking like he was feeding his pets or spreading bait to
        the fishes. This was his daily ritual. Usually, he was alone, but today,
        there was a bunch of ‘tails' behind him. A group of senior members of
        the Arcane Church, who were wearing priest robes and officer uniforms,
        followed behind him. "High Priest, now that the World Tree has invaded,
        our high-level combatants are not enough. I hope you can help." "Aren't
        you afraid that I'll die on the battlefield and drop the National
        Treasure?" Wuornos said casually without looking back.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Of course, we don't wish to take the risk. When the border wars
        occurred and secondary dimensions were invaded, we did not request you
        to take action. It's just that the situation is urgent this time, and we
        need you to use some of the incarnations to help…" an officer said
        softly.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This was a very normal request. In the past, Wuornos would have agreed
        to it, but now, he was different.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"I refuse." Wuornos shook his head.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">"This… why?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "I'm only one step away from the Transcendent Grade, and I can obtain
        the opportunity to advance at any time. I need to maintain my peak state
        at all times to prevent myself from missing the opportunity. As long as
        the enemies don't attack the Arcane Church's mother planet, don't look
        at me for anything else. I don't want to waste my energy elsewhere,"
        Wuornos said casually.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "But the other direct descendants are all fighting a bloody battle.
        Isn't your refusal a little…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "You don't understand. Whether or not I can advance to the Transcendent
        Grade is more important than these battles. This is the independence
        granted to me by the Pope. I have the right to decide if I want to
        participate in the battle." Wuornos waved his hand casually. "Stop
        pestering me here. Go back."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The group of people looked at each other, clenched their teeth, and left
        with dissatisfaction.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Wuornos did not care.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        His last advancement had failed, causing him to be heavily injured.
        However, there was also an unexpected benefit, which was that the Pope
        saw that he indeed had the possibility of advancing at any time, so he
        simply allowed him to decide when he wanted to join the battle.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Therefore, over the past ten years, Wuornos did not participate in the
        war, nor did he attempt to advance rashly. He had been recuperating and
        reflecting on why he had failed.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Wuornos always felt that he was missing some key elements. It was not as
        if he had gained nothing after searching for so long. He had vaguely
        discovered the mysterious ability hidden in his body, but it had yet to
        be fully activated. It seemed to be able to sense something unknown, and
        his intuition told him that this feeling was very important for
        Promotion.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "When I figure out what's going on, I should be able to step into the
        Transcendent Grade. Maybe this is the secret of Black Star's Promotion.
        I won't fail again this time…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Wuornos' eyes flashed.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Somewhere in the Endless Nebulae, two fleets were engaged in an intense
        battle. One side was the World Tree invaders, and the other was the
        Black Star Army.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        A large number of charge cabins latched onto the spaceships of the World
        Tree and sent out batches of army players to board the battleships. The
        World Tree battleships fell one after another from the inside. Many
        Calamity Grade players wore mechanical suits and swam around the
        battlefield.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Due to the sudden change in the situation, the combat missions of the
        players had also changed. From guarding the borders, they had gone to
        different areas to stop the World Tree invaders. The mission format was
        much more varied.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The border defense circle of the Flickering World almost transformed
        into a teleportation station, and the Multi-Dimensional Sky Opening
        Transportation Device operated continuously, sending batches of players
        to the various Star Fields.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The new level cap was unlocked in Version 5.5, and many players had just
        entered the Calamity Grade. A Calamity Grade that did not fear death
        naturally could not be underestimated. Furthermore, there was a large
        group of them. Although there were many Calamity Grade Supers on the
        World Tree's side, they were not as expendable as the players.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Everyone could revive, but the time interval between the revivals of the
        World Tree was longer, and the dead warriors appeared in the mother
        tree's body. They could not be revived on the spot like the players, and
        their effectiveness could not be compared at all. It was equivalent to
        the players' real strength being many times stronger than on the
        surface; one player was equal to many. There were Immortals on both
        sides, and the battle was extremely intense. However, it was clear who
        was stronger, and the World Tree warriors were forced to retreat.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "This group of Immortals is too terrifying. With so many Calamity Grades
        as a suicide squad, only the main elites can fight them. We can't hold
        on at all."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Inside this invading main ship of the World Tree, the commander was
        surprised.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Ever since the World Tree obtained the intelligence of the three
        Universal Civilizations, this information had been shared in the mental
        network. From the Tree King to the grassroots soldiers, they all
        understood the Super classification of the three Universal
        Civilizations, as well as the Immortals and other strange existences.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "There seems to be a limit to the revival of these Immortals. If we kill
        them multiple times in a short period, they won't be able to revive for
        some time," the aide-de-camp said.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The commander murmured, "I wonder what kind of existence this is. What
        kind of power did their revival come from…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The aide-de-camp shrugged and said, "Maybe they have a World Tree too?
        Who knows?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        A few days later, somewhere in the World Tree territory.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        A wormhole slowly opened, and a mechanical body came out. It was Han
        Xiao's Lord's Avatar.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao twisted his neck and activated the self-inspection device. The
        outer armor opened and closed like scales, revealing fine cracks. He
        felt the exquisite feeling of the mechanical body and let out a
        comfortable groan. Due to the (Energy Base-God of All Machines), the
        Transcendent Grade Lord's Descent had improved in perception aspect.
        With the Lord's Descent of a Beyond Grade A, there was still a barrier
        between his senses and the Lord's Avatar body. Although he could control
        it like his arm, he could clearly tell that it was not his body.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        But at the Transcendent Grade, the feeling of the Lord's Avatar was
        almost the same as the main body. It was not like a mechanical avatar
        but more like a main body. The control was fine and smooth.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        If an example was to be given, a Beyond Grade A's Lord's Descent was
        like the remote control of a virtual reality. It was very real, but deep
        down, he knew it was fake. The feeling of a Transcendent Grade's Lord's
        Descent was like he had been reborn…
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "This feels good. The avatar's power capacity has reached more than 94%.
        Not bad." Han Xiao clenched his fists. He could feel the rhythm of every
        alloy, every part, and every biochemical tendon in his body. He nodded
        with satisfaction, then looked up at the sky full of stars in the World
        Tree territory.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "More than ten years ago, I was heavily injured by you guys and almost
        died in your base camp. Now is the time to settle the score!"
      </p>

      <p class="calibre3">
        The mechanical army swarmed out like a black tide and gathered together,
        covering the Lord's Avatar. It quickly combined and turned into a huge
        Mechanical Deity that spanned across the galaxy.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao controlled the gigantic Supreme Heavenly Venerate and cruised
        through the galaxy of the World Tree territory, heading toward the
        dazzling starlight.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Not long after, a planet wrapped in roots appeared in his sight, getting
        closer and closer.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Without saying a word, Han Xiao raised his palm, and a strong psionic
        light appeared in his palm. The next moment, a thick beam of light shot
        out and penetrated the planet like a spear.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        A hole was left on the surface of the planet, and the internal structure
        of the planet was exposed through the hole. The crust, the mantle, and
        the core of the planet were clearly separated, like the layers of a
        cake.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After a moment of stagnation, the planet suddenly collapsed inward
        toward the opening. Its crust shattered and turned into a molten stream.
        The mantle surged violently, and the brightness of the planet's core
        increased. Powerful light burst out from the center, and the next
        moment, the entire planet exploded, turning into an expanding ball of
        light.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao's body did not move at all, and his shield automatically
        blocked the strong shockwave of the planet's explosion. The electric
        arcs were not damaged at all, as though there were layers of energy
        hurricanes surrounding him.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This time, he was here to cause trouble. He did not need to be as
        cautious as he had been more than ten years ago. What he wanted was to
        create a huge commotion. The next moment, the information state alarm
        was triggered. Not long after, the entire World Tree Civilization knew
        that Han Xiao had suddenly appeared and destroyed a planet.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao had not gone far when the space around him fluctuated. Group
        after group of World Tree fleets passed through the World Tree Express
        and headed toward the area of the explosion. Without hesitation, they
        opened fire on the planet-sized Supreme Celestial Body.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        A dense rain of light rained down on the Supreme Heavenly Venerate's
        shield. However, while the thunder was loud, the resulting rain was
        small. It could only create large sparks of energy, unable to break
        through the seemingly indestructible shield. Han Xiao raised his hand
        and clenched his fist. Energy gushed out and crushed the battleships.
        Although he was surrounded by the fleet, he seemed to be the one
        surrounding all the enemies instead.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Very soon, more World Tree fleets arrived at the battlefield with the
        help of the World Tree territory's rapid descent channel. They all
        joined the battle, and more and more battleships surrounded Han Xiao.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In the Tree King Palace on the other side, both the Ancestral Tree King
        and the Fortitude Tree King were paying attention to Han Xiao's actions
        through the mental network.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Why did this guy suddenly come here?" The Fortitude Tree King was
        shocked. "Is he planning to attack our territory alone?" "Looks like
        it." The Ancestral Tree King narrowed his eyes.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Should we stop him?</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        When the Ancestral Tree King heard this, he shook his head firmly.
        "There's no need. He's very difficult to deal with. Human wave tactics
        are very inefficient against him. We don't know how many troops we'll
        have to invest to stop him. We'll also have to send a portion of the
        invading troops back. That's exactly what he wants. He wants to divert
        our attention and obstruct our progress."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Then what should we do? Just watch him wreak havoc in our territory?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Since we can't stop him, we won't. Let the Mother Tree retract its
        territory and change its base. We'll leave this place to him."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">The Ancestral Tree King spoke without hesitation.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        There was another method, which was to use the Tree God's Descent to
        fight a Transcendent Grade. However, after the last battle, the
        Ancestral Tree King felt that the incomplete Tree God's Descent would
        not be able to defeat Black Star, so he decided not to waste the time
        and simply abandoned the
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">area.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Due to the connection of the mind network and the unique parent tree
        mechanism, the World Tree Civilization had a huge advantage, which was
        its astonishing executional ability. As soon as the Ancestral Tree King
        gave the order, the enormous World Tree territory immediately began to
        alter itself.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In the starry sky, the roots of the World Tree could be seen moving
        slowly, as though they were uprooting themselves. The ‘land' that
        carried the World Tree was the universe of the territory. Usually, these
        roots were hidden, but now, they appeared one after another.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The planets turned into liquids and fused into the World Tree Root. The
        World Tree Root also retracted, and the space crack outside the planet
        disappeared.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        For a time, the countless stars dimmed until they disappeared. The
        originally prosperous and bright galaxy slowly turned into a desolate
        universe. As the World Tree retrieved the planets, the Star Field was
        quickly recovering its original appearance. It was desolate, cold, and
        dark. Not a single blade of grass grew here.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao, who was slaughtering the World Tree fleet, also noticed the
        abnormal changes in the universe space. This was also the first time he
        had seen the World Tree migrate its base. He gazed at the universe
        filled with tree roots, revealing their ‘uprooted' state.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "You're planning to move the moment you see me? How decisive."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Han Xiao was surprised.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Without the ability of the roots, the World Tree fleet could not be
        deployed. The World Tree fleet present received the order and
        immediately ended the siege. They took advantage of the last moment to
        quickly teleport out, planning to retreat.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao crushed another fleet. Suddenly, he activated the Tree God's
        Character Summon Card.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Swoosh!</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The next moment, space cracks suddenly appeared around the Supreme
        Heavenly Venerate. Roots shot out and swept across the fleet, swallowing
        the battleships.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The roots that he had summoned with his Character Summon Card flowed
        with blue light, completely different from the green World Tree itself!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"How can he use the power of the World Tree?!"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Ancestral Tree King had been paying close attention the entire time,
        and he was stunned upon seeing this.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Could Black Star be a member of the World Tree?! Their kin?!!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">That's not right. How is this possible?</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At the same time, the Mother Tree's consciousness also reacted, and the
        Ancestral Tree King could sense the shock within.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The World Tree itself was also confused, wondering why a life form that
        was not controlled by it had the same power. Han Xiao was controlling
        the summoned roots to attack the fleet, and he was enjoying this novel
        feeling. Suddenly, he owned a bunch of ‘tentacles', and he finally
        experienced the joy of being a Tree King. Right at this moment, a wave
        of mental fluctuations suddenly transmitted over, bringing along the
        Ancestral Tree King's shocked voice.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Black Star! How do you have the power of the World Tree?!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Guess?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Han Xiao raised his brows.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He activated this Character Summon Card on a whim mainly to test if the
        root he summoned was connected to the World Tree.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After this attempt, he was certain that the roots of the Character
        Summon Card belonged to him and would not be controlled by the World
        Tree.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Even if he devoured the matter, he could only disassemble it into energy
        to replenish his own, unlike the World Tree, which preserved the
        information form and converted it. When the Character Summon Card's
        effect ends, these temporarily summoned roots would automatically
        disperse, and the things he devoured during this period would vanish as
        well.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, in the eyes of outsiders, these blue roots used him as the
        source. Their strength was extremely similar to the World Tree, but they
        were an independent entity. This made the Ancestral Tree King's
        imagination run wild.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At this moment, information about the revivors and Immortals of the
        explored universe flashed through his mind. The Ancestral Tree King's
        eyes widened, and he felt that he had found the truth.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "I understand! There's actually another World Tree in the universe, and
        it's on you!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The information leaked by the Star Alliance included Han Xiao's life.
        The Ancestral Tree King had always been surprised by how short Han
        Xiao's rise had been. At this moment, he felt enlightened and found an
        explanation.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The undying characteristics of those Immortals were very similar to the
        members of the World Tree. If those Immortals were members of another
        World Tree, it would make sense. Black Star had been pretending that he
        had nothing to do with them, but he was secretly making a fortune. He
        was the one behind this!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Two World Trees? You really dare to fantasize."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao could not help but laugh at the Ancestral Tree King's
        imagination.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Just as he was about to say something, many spatial tunnels suddenly
        opened up around him, and green roots of the World Tree extended out,
        wrapping around Han Xiao's blue roots. They twisted together like
        snakes, slowly wriggling, squeezing, pulling, and sticking. Seeing this,
        Han Xiao paused, and his expression suddenly became strange.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">This scene, why does this look like a tongue kiss…</p>
      <p class="calibre3">It was a little painful for the eyes to see…</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The corner of Han Xiao's eyes twitched. He could even feel the emotions
        of the World Tree from where the roots were intertwined. It was an
        extremely passionate and yearning thought that contained the desire to
        become one.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The power of the World Tree flowed along with the roots and into the
        blue roots. It was actively transferring its energy as if it could not
        wait to share the good stuff. The World Tree was also moving the power
        contained in the blue roots out of it as if it wanted to make a special
        ‘body fluid' exchange.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Is he treating the root I called out as a spouse?!?!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao's eyes widened in shock, his body frozen stiff.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He had thought that when the original World Tree saw him, the blue
        version, they would be hostile to each other and would fight to the
        death. He did not expect that not only would they not fight, but the
        World Tree would take the initiative to ‘communicate' with him. It did
        not have any hostility and was very passionate.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Could it be that… this was because the original World Tree had always
        been a unique existence that was lonely? Now that it had finally found
        someone of the same species, its mating habits were ignited, and its
        thirst unbearable. Its instincts claimed the upper hand?!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "The ancients did not lie to me. Two tigers cannot share one mountain
        unless it's one male and one female." Han Xiao's interest was piqued.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        On the other side, the Ancestral Tree King was completely dumbfounded.
        As the Tree King, he could feel the joy and excitement from the mother
        tree's consciousness. Even his gaze toward Han Xiao was affected.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao, who was supposed to be his enemy, suddenly became friendly in
        his eyes.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        F*ck, we were about to fight to the death, why did Her Majesty surrender
        first?!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Ancestral Tree King hurriedly shook his head to get rid of the
        influence of the Mother Tree's consciousness. "What's going on?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao came back to his senses, chuckled, and said with a teasing
        tone, "Didn't you say there were two World Trees? I'm a male version,
        yours is a female, what do you think will happen?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Ancestral Tree King was furious. "Bullsh*t! Why is it that when a
        female sees a male, the female loses all will to fight? Shouldn't it be
        the other way around?!" "Woah, I didn't expect you to be so opinionated.
        To think you're actually good at both fists and words."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Black lines appeared on Han Xiao's forehead. He turned around to look at
        the blue and green roots that were entangling him. Suddenly, he
        chuckled.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "This is too proactive. By the way, your mother tree is amazing!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Although the Ancestral Tree King did not understand Han Xiao's teasing,
        he knew that it was not a good thing. He felt a sense of sourness, and
        the green light on his body seemed to have become brighter.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He deactivated the telepathic communication, suppressed his anger, and
        ordered the troops to evacuate quickly.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Not long after, the World Tree finally returned to its base. The fleets
        that surrounded Han Xiao were either fleeing or dying and the World Tree
        Root, which was frantically looking for a mate, also reluctantly
        returned to the space channel. No matter how it teased, the blue root
        that Han Xiao had summoned with his Character Summon Card did not
        respond.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In reality, it was because the blue root was a temporarily generated
        rootless tree. It was akin to a castrated version of the World Tree.
        Since it was completely controlled by Han Xiao, it did not have any
        self-awareness, nor the ability to procreate. Not long after, the time
        for the Tree God Character Summon Card ended. The blue roots shattered
        inch by inch, turning into light fragments that dissipated. Only the
        Supreme Heavenly Venerate was left floating in the desolate universe.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The World Tree had already abandoned its territory, and all the planets
        and individuals had returned to the mother tree. They had completely
        evacuated. It was as if they had been frightened by Han Xiao alone and
        did not even want their base anymore. They had moved overnight… and that
        was the truth.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">It was just two words, having face!</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Tsk, unknowingly, my deterrence is already so strong."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Han Xiao shook his head and laughed.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        If it was anyone else, they would most likely have run away because they
        would not want to lose face. A civilization as large as theirs would not
        be scared to the point of abandoning their homeland by him alone. At the
        very least, they would have to send enough troops to fight until they
        suffered heavy casualties and felt that they could not take it anymore.
        Only then would they have a reason to retreat. However, the World Tree
        did not care about such things and did not feel embarrassed at all. He
        had not even gone all out yet, and they had already retreated. Such
        enemies were the hardest to deal with.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Although forcing the World Tree to move will give them some trouble, it
        won't solve the root of the problem. However, this trip was worth it. I
        seem to have discovered something interesting."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao smiled. He did not expect the Tree God's Character Summon Card
        to have such a miraculous effect.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Now that I've used it for an experiment, this Character Summon Card has
        three more uses. It might be effective at the right time."
      </p>
    </div>

      </h1>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The World Tree moved overnight, and the thought of causing a huge ruckus
        naturally fell through. Han Xiao left behind a group of mechanical
        troops in this Star Field that had once again become empty and lonely,
        then took back his Lord's Avatar.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As long as the World Tree's mechanism was not disturbed, its base could
        be built anywhere in the universe. They had wiped out many civilizations
        over the years and had the coordinates of many areas. They could just
        find a place that they had turned into a desolate universe belt and
        migrate there.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The migration process had a certain impact on their invasion at the
        frontlines, which caused a slight gap in support. Han Xiao told the
        three Universal Civilizations about this.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After learning that the World Tree had been frightened by Han Xiao
        alone, the three leaders were shocked and also ordered the strategic
        command center to make adjustments.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The flames of war raged across the entire explored universe, and a month
        passed very quickly. Under the Galactic Alliance Army's attack, the
        World Tree's first full-scale invasion finally stopped.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Although the World Tree's aggressive arrival had caused quite a bit of
        panic in the galactic society, in terms of practical benefits, the World
        Tree's first wave of invasion did not cause too much damage. Most of the
        invading teams were intercepted by the Galactic Alliance Army. Although
        they had devoured some planets, this number was just a drop in the ocean
        for the entire explored universe. Furthermore, they were scattered
        everywhere and did not have much development potential. Although the
        three Universal Civilizations did not have a powerful home defense
        system like the Information Form Warning Network and the World Tree
        Express, the Multi-Dimensional Sky Opening Transportation Device was
        just as amazing, allowing the galactic alliance army to have extremely
        strong military mobility. As long as an invader appeared, they would be
        able to send reinforcements in an instant.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        If it were any other civilization, they would be extremely passive in
        the face of the World Tree's unpredictable harassment and invasion. This
        was the battle of attrition that the World Tree was good at, but the
        technologies of the three Universal Civilizations countered the usual
        tactics of the World Tree, preventing it from achieving the best
        results. Of course, although the first wave of the World Tree fleet was
        repelled, there were still quite a few World Tree fleets left in the
        galactic society, hiding in the dark. This was the weakness of the three
        Universal Civilizations. Without sufficient monitoring devices, although
        the reinforcements were fast, as long as the World Tree fleet hid and
        did not appear, it would be difficult for them to lock onto the enemy
        within their territory.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After resolving the current emergency, the upper echelons of the
        Galactic Alliance Army invited the various officers and the Beyond Grade
        A Association upper echelons to hold a strategic meeting to analyze the
        current situation and discuss the subsequent actions. "…Although the
        traitor leaked the information and caused the World Tree to invade the
        entire realm, our current situation is not as bad as we thought. The
        vast territory and the rapid reinforcement speed are two of our greatest
        strengths in maintaining the situation. It has already shown a
        significant role in the war."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Teny pointed at the 3D star map on the table and summarized the current
        situation.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The same star map model was floating in front of the participants,
        displaying the current strategic deployment.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "According to the statistics, most of the World Tree's targets are
        military facilities, resource planets, civilizations' mother planets,
        and Beyond Grade A race territories. From this, it can be seen that the
        World Tree's main strategy is to destroy our productivity and social
        stability. However, at present, the World Tree has only succeeded a few
        times. We have already secretly relocated the important facilities in
        the early years, and part of the information leaked by the traitor is
        outdated."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Teny spoke with confidence.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The way the Star Alliance Observers hid was too low-profile, causing
        them to only be able to obtain general information from the internet. As
        such, the information was lagging. Thus, the Star Alliance Observers
        naturally had no way of knowing some confidential information of the
        advanced civilizations. The most valuable information they leaked to the
        World Tree was the star map and spatial coordinates.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Does this mean that the traitor's position isn't high?" an officer
        asked.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Not necessarily. Maybe it's just a disguise," another person retorted.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Teny interrupted the two of them, coughed, and said, "Ahem, regarding
        the traitor, we have someone else to take care of them. We don't need to
        discuss this matter, let's get back to the main topic… Our intercepting
        efficiency is quite good, and it's all thanks to the support of His
        Excellency Black Star and the Beyond Grade A Association. Otherwise, the
        high-level combatants of the World Tree would have been able to wreak
        havoc for a long time."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Hearing this, the officers turned around and nodded at the
        representatives of the Beyond Grade A Association.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao nodded and said, "We wiped out quite a number of World Tree
        experts this time. They will need at least a year or two to make a
        comeback."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        His Mechanical Oracles had worked together with the Beyond Grade As of
        the Association, direct descendants, and Holy Accord, eliminating a
        large number of high-level combatants of the World Tree. They had sent
        at least two to three hundred people back to be watered in the World
        Tree, so they would not be able to return anytime soon.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        A portion of the experts from the other races encountered Han Xiao's
        Lord's Avatar and was hit by (Virtual Purification-Restore). They
        exploded on the spot and turned into fireworks.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Other than dying in a normal battle, some of the high-level combatants
        of the World Tree had been used by Han Xiao to test the effects of
        (Information Form Obliteration), or they had been sealed by the
        Spacetime Amber and turned into his collection. There were about thirty
        of them, and the World Tree had lost these powerful individuals forever.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Due to the division of the battlefront, some Beyond Grade As from the
        three Universal Civilizations also died. They were logged in the Soul
        Comfort Monument that the three Universal Civilizations had set up and
        had recorded a new number of deaths.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Teny then turned to look at Manison and said with a deep voice, "This
        time, the Mechanical Race's territory was also the main focus of the
        invasion. We did not arrive in time. Luckily, His Excellency Mechanic
        Emperor defeated the enemy. We offer our apologies."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "It's just a small matter, not worth mentioning." Manison waved his hand
        and said calmly.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Everyone was surprised.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Manison's force was one of those which showed an astonishing performance
        against the invasion. He had hidden an astonishingly large mechanical
        army in the Mechanical Race's territory and wiped out the World Tree
        invaders without the aid of the galactic alliance army. The military
        strength he displayed was shocking. Although Manison was no longer the
        authoritative figure of the Mechanic class, the foundation that he had
        built over the years was not just for show. Among the Beyond Grade As,
        he still had a lot of weight.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This time, an officer suddenly said thoughtfully, "Speaking of which,
        the Super Star Cluster Alliance had also sent out a lot of troops to
        provide support."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Now that you mention it, I thought of something unusual. The World
        Tree's invasion seemed to have avoided the territory of the Super Star
        Cluster Alliance, and it was at most a small-scale harassment. That's
        why the Super Star Cluster was able to help."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "It is indeed a little strange…" All the officers had strange looks on
        their faces.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In their eyes, the World Tree did not treat the Super Star Cluster
        Alliance as an invasion target. It was a little strange, giving them the
        feeling that they were in cahoots with each other. The suspicion of them
        being the traitor was quite high. However, the Super Star Cluster
        Alliance did not just stand by and watch but took the initiative to send
        troops to support the Galactic Alliance Army. This was a good action,
        which confused many of the upper echelons of the military, reducing
        their suspicion. The Super Star Cluster Alliance did this to fulfill its
        agreement with Han Xiao. If they had not taken the initiative to provide
        support, the three Universal Civilizations would have been even more
        suspicious of them. But now, they were more confused than doubtful, and
        there were no signs of internal conflict for the time being.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Listening to everyone's discussion, Han Xiao's expression remained the
        same. He had convinced the Super Star Cluster Alliance, barely
        suppressing the suspicion within. However, he did not intend to speak of
        his contribution.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At this time, Commander-in-chief Simon took over the conversation and
        pulled it to the main topic.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Currently, there are two things that we need to pay attention to. The
        first is to clean up the dormant World Tree invaders. Their main force
        has been chased away, but there are still a small number of troops
        within the borders. This is a hidden danger, and it has put quite a bit
        of mental pressure on the galactic society. What do you guys think?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The three Universal Civilizations had neutralized the first wave of
        invasion, but the aftereffects were severe. Because their line of
        defense was suddenly breached by the World Tree, the people were
        panicking, and chaos broke out everywhere. The three Universal
        Civilizations had no choice but to take out more energy to deal with the
        refugees.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In this regard, the three Universal Civilizations were no different from
        normal civilizations. The World Tree was one of the few civilizations
        that did not have any internal conflicts.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After some discussion, the result was only to strengthen the strict
        military control. Now was not the time to talk about freedom.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Seeing this, Simon continued, "In addition, we have to figure out the
        World Tree's next move and make some preparations in advance. They did
        not invade the Central Galaxy this time, but they will take action
        sooner or later. They are in a race against time, so they won't be able
        to wait long."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The upper echelons of the military began discussing this topic. Han Xiao
        and the others did not participate and listened quietly. After some
        discussion, the military finally came to a consensus. The meeting
        temporarily ended, and the participants passed down the order.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Secondary Dimension World, World Tree Blessed Race territory.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The roots of the trees formed a spiral-shaped pagoda that stood in the
        middle of the ground. Surrounding the pagoda were buildings formed by
        huge trees that formed a tree city. Countless members of the Blessed
        Race lived there.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Space cracks opened from time to time, and the battleships of the
        Blessed Race came and went.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Two figures floated in the blue-green sky, looking down at the tree city
        below. One was the Ancestral Tree King, and the other was a female
        figure in a gorgeous robe. Her skin was like tender leaves, glowing with
        jade green light. Her long white hair was spread behind her back, and
        there was a complicated and mysterious mark on her forehead. She was one
        of the 13 Ancestral Spirits, Hayleen.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Your Excellency Tree King, why are you looking for me?" "I have a
        mission for you."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Please speak."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "The Secret Tree King is not coming back. His crown needs a new master,
        and we also need a new Tree King. Are you interested?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Hearing this, Hayleen could not help but look at the Ancestral Tree King
        with surprise in her eyes.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Am I qualified to become the Tree King?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Of course, your magic strength has already reached the standard for
        this position." The Ancestral Tree King nodded.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Hayleen narrowed her eyes. "I am indeed interested… but there are more
        powerful mages than me. Why me?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "I only said that you are qualified, not chosen," the Ancestral Tree
        King said calmly. "Under normal circumstances, the position of the Tree
        King will not be yours. What I mean is, if you want to become the Tree
        King, I can give you a chance. As long as you complete one objective,
        you will be able to inherit the crown of the Secret Tree King. The magic
        left behind by generations of Tree Kings is stored in there, and I
        believe you will be interested."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"…What do you want me to do?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "I know that your genes mutated in your early years, fusing with your
        own magic power, and you entered a rare ‘Warlock' branch, forming some
        strange innate spells. You can use a very strange method to hide your
        existence, and you're very good at stealth and assassination… Now that
        the civilization is facing an unprecedented threat, we need your ability
        to assassinate the Pivotal Snake's infant protected by Black Star," the
        Ancestral Tree King said with a deep voice.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Are you asking me to die?" Hayleen frowned.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Ancestral Tree King shook his head and raised his palm. A
        black-green liquid substance suddenly seeped out from his palm and
        floated in midair. Following that, the phantom of a golden leaf appeared
        beside him, and the two objects circled his palm.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "These are two key items to carry out the mission. One is a lethal
        poison that the mother tree specially synthesized to restrain her
        natural enemy. As long as you give it to the Pivotal Snake, it can
        quickly deprive the other party of their life force. Be it through
        injection or poisoning the food, it will be effective. This golden leaf
        is a child treasure derived from the mother tree, called the Leaf
        Concealment Robe. It can hide your tracks on all levels and enhance your
        stealth ability."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Hayleen's expression changed, and she took the two items hesitantly.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Seeing this, the Ancestral Tree King said indifferently, "The growth of
        the Pivotal Snake is very fast, and the mother tree's perception of it
        is becoming clearer. Follow its guidance and you will be able to find
        its traces. As long as you can kill the Pivotal Snake, you will be the
        hero of the civilization. When you return, this tree crown will be
        yours!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Hayleen played with the two items for a while and finally nodded.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"…I can try."</p>

        In a desolate universe belt in the explored universe.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The lurkers of the Star Alliance were paying attention to the progress
        of the battle on the news and were somewhat dissatisfied with the
        current situation.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "The three Universal Civilizations managed to repel the World Tree's
        first wave of invasion, and also managed to stabilize the situation
        despite the sudden chaos. As expected of the three Universal
        Civilizations, they're not that easy to deal with."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "The World Tree's attacks are a little weak… No, I should say that the
        three Universal Civilizations' resistance is too strong." They had
        leaked the information because they wanted to see the World Tree invade
        and bring despair to the three Universal Civilizations. However, the
        current situation was far from their expectations.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "The good news is that although the progress of the World Tree devouring
        the territory is slow, it will eventually cause the three Universal
        Civilizations to fall into a hopeless situation with no chance of
        turning the tables."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "That's right. The resistance of the three Universal Civilizations will
        gradually weaken and die."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"I hope to see that day before my life ends."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The members of the Star Alliance calmed down and gathered their
        confidence.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In their eyes, this was a long-term war that might last for decades or
        even centuries. They decided to wait patiently. No matter how long it
        took, they had to witness the three Universal Civilizations' defeat.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Under the harassment of the World Tree's full invasion, the lives of the
        galactic residents were extremely tough. Half a year passed in the
        flames of war.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The World Tree had launched a large-scale invasion of the various Star
        Fields on more than one occasion, and the three Universal Civilizations
        had been resisting nonstop. Both sides had fought back and forth for
        more than half a year, and hundreds of thousands of battles of various
        sizes had erupted in the cold universe.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The strategic command center calculated the losses. The total area of
        the planets lost and swallowed by the World Tree was about three and a
        half Star Systems. Compared to the Star Fields that had hundreds of Star
        Systems, this loss was not much. There were more than ten Star Fields in
        the explored universe, and the planets that the World Tree had taken
        away were just a drop in the ocean. According to this trend, the World
        Tree theoretically needed hundreds or thousands of years to defeat the
        Galactic Alliance Army and devour the entire explored universe. However,
        the three Universal Civilizations would not relax because of this. They
        would fight for every inch of land. The players followed the fleets to
        fight the invaders, and their experience quickly accumulated. The number
        of players who stepped into the Calamity Grade increased.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        On the other hand, Karlot, Evans, and the other new Beyond Grade As were
        also rushing around the battlefields. They did not usually have so many
        combat opportunities, so their strength was growing rapidly.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao was always guarding the shallow layer dimensions alone. In the
        past half a year, the World Tree Blessed Races had invaded seventeen
        times, big and small. They all either got killed or fled, unable to
        shake the secondary dimension defense line that he was guarding.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Other than that, Han Xiao had been focused on cultivating the Pivotal
        Snake, trying to find a way to make it grow and mate with the secondary
        dimensions to produce an embryo.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Originally, he did not have much hope, the Pivotal Snake infant was a
        baby after all. Reproduction was a pressure that it should not bear at
        its age.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, what Han Xiao did not expect was that this experiment actually
        succeeded. Not only did the Pivotal Snake infant stick it up, but it was
        also very strong. It eagerly destroyed three secondary dimensions that
        gave birth to ignorant consciousness, leaving behind three embryos.
        However, after studying the ‘snake p*rno' that was specially recorded,
        Han Xiao also found the reason.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Due to the pursuit of the World Tree and the dangers of the secondary
        dimension environment, the life of the Pivotal Snake was extremely
        difficult. Therefore, mating as soon as possible and giving birth to
        offspring might be an instinct carved into their genes. Their
        reproductive ability was naturally mature, and they did not need to wait
        until they reached adulthood to give birth.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        With the three embryos, he had finally opened the door to the breeder
        job. Han Xiao had spent most of his time on this, making the Stockman
        Realmless King bleed.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, he did not turn the Pivotal Snake infant into a Virtual Life
        Form because of this. He planned to wait for the embryos to mature.
        After he had the second and third Pivotal Snake, he planned to try this.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        On this day, Han Xiao received news from Oathkeeper and Kasuyi. They
        planned to visit him together, so he invited them to visit the base.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In the circular corridor of the observatory, three people walked slowly
        side by side, chatting. The dazzling aurora outside the window left
        mottled shadows on the three of them.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao smiled and said, "How do you have time to visit me today? How's
        the battle in the main universe?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "The Galactic Alliance Army has repelled another wave of the World Tree
        invasion. We can take a break, so we came to see you." Kasuyi smiled.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "What about him?" Han Xiao turned to Oathkeeper. "When did you guys get
        together?" "Are you even going to care about who I make friends with?
        Such a great superior," Oathkeeper said with his hands behind his back.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "What are you talking about? I'm just afraid that you'll be led astray
        by Kasuyi. He's a veteran two-faced actor." Han Xiao snorted.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "You have no right to say that about me." Kasuyi inwardly rolled his
        eyes.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The three chatted for a while before getting down to business. "Speaking
        of which, some of the Beyond Grade As have died in this battle. When do
        you plan to revive them?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao shook his head. "Not at the moment. Although my authority is
        high, I will have to spend two to three months in the Sanctum. If I
        don't stay here, it will be easy for accidents to happen. Protecting the
        Pivotal Snake is more important now, so I can't leave yet."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Oathkeeper nodded and suddenly changed the topic. "When the war is over,
        I will leave the explored universe. I will leave the Holy Accord to
        you."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Han Xiao was stunned.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        What are you doing? What enmity do we have? Why are you suddenly
        sticking a flag in my face? You are making me panic!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At this moment, Kasuyi smiled and said, "Me too. After this battle, I'll
        leave with him."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">What? Are the two of you eloping?</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao had a strange expression. "This is what you came to talk to me
        about today? What are you doing? Why do you want to leave when
        everything is alright?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kasuyi shrugged. "It's just a long journey. Although it's convenient to
        stay in the galactic society, this is just a corner of the world. The
        universe is so big, I want to take a look." …So capable? The Underworld
        is huge too. Do you want to take a look?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Han Xiao criticized inwardly.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "You can go if you want to. It's not like I won't let you go. Or do you
        want to see if I will make you stay?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Oathkeeper said, "That's not the case. The unexplored universe is filled
        with unknown dangers. We came to inform you in advance. We hope that
        every time you enter the Sanctum, you will use Revive on us. If we are
        still alive, there will naturally be no effect. If we unfortunately die
        and no news is sent back, you will be able to revive us."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "That's it? So, you guys are going out to have fun, and you want me to
        back you up at home?" Han Xiao said.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "That's about it." Kasuyi was not embarrassed at all.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Nc</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao was speechless. He waved his hand and said, "Alright, I'll
        remember this… but aren't you guys talking too early? The war is not
        over yet. Didn't you hear the analysis of the Military Strategy
        Department? They predicted that this war would take another 200 to 500
        years under normal circumstances."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kasuyi laughed. "That's for the average person to see. How can we, the
        upper echelons, not know? As long as your Pivotal Snake matures, it will
        be time for us to officially counterattack. It won't take that long."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "That's hard to say." Han Xiao shook his head and said, "The Pivotal
        Snake is similar to most creatures. It has six stages of growth, namely
        the embryo stage, infancy, childhood, adolescence, adulthood, and old
        age. Although the Pivotal Snake infant is growing quickly, it has only
        been less than a year since it broke out of its shell. At most, it is
        still in the infant stage, and it is still too far from adulthood." "No
        matter what, the Pivotal Snake won't take a few hundred years to reach
        adulthood. I estimate that it will take at most ten to thirty years,"
        Oathkeeper concluded.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "That isn't short." Han Xiao spread out his hands. "Therefore, the
        expeditionary army still has to continue moving. We have to search for
        the World Tree's main body together. Now that we know each other's
        strengths, we don't have to worry about leaking information. The
        expeditionary army doesn't have to be as secretive as before."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kasuyi suddenly thought of something and said, "By the way, is there
        someone called Harrison among your subordinates?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"You know him?" Han Xiao was surprised.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "I went to reinforce a battlefield not too far away from Planet
        Aquamarine's refuge planet, so after the battle, I went to Floating
        Dragon to take a look. Ames was not at home, and her manager, Jenny,
        received me. She knows about our relationship and wanted me to pass you
        a message." "What is it?" Han Xiao was curious.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "She said she's pregnant." Kasuyi's tone was playful.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "F*ck!" Han Xiao was shocked. "It's not mine! I've never mated with her!
        Don't talk nonsense!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "What are you thinking?" Kasuyi raised his brows. "She said the child's
        father is Harrison, not you. Why are you so agitated?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Phew, that's good… Can you finish your sentence in one breath next
        time?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Han Xiao heaved a sigh of relief.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        If Ames misunderstood that he had something going on with her sister,
        things would get interesting…
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kasuyi sized him up from head to toe and laughed. "How can a
        Transcendent be afraid of a mere Ames?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "What do you mean scared? What do you know? No matter how strong you
        are, strength is not used to intimidate your family. This is called
        protecting the harmony of your family." Han Xiao said with disdain.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kasuyi did not comment and continued, "Anyway, Jenny told me to tell you
        that she hopes you can persuade Harrison to give up his position in the
        expeditionary army and not take the risk again. She doesn't want her
        child to lose his father the moment he's born."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Hearing this, Han Xiao also stopped joking and told Phillip to check on
        Harrison's current situation.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He did not have the time to dig into his subordinates' privacy, and he
        only found out about this today. In the past, he only knew that the two
        of them had some ambiguous relationship, but he did not confirm their
        relationship. After some investigation, he realized that the two of them
        had only officially gotten together half a year ago. In the past decade
        or so, Harrison had been participating in the expedition in the
        secondary dimension and rarely contacted Jenny. He had originally
        thought that he would not be able to take care of her feelings, but
        Jenny did not know if it was because no one wanted her or because she
        was old and did not want to be alone anymore. Not only did she not have
        any complaints about this, but her feelings for Harrison also grew
        deeper instead.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        More than half a year ago, the expeditionary army outpost was breached
        by the World Tree Blessed Race, and the expeditionary army suffered
        heavy losses. Harrison escaped with his life, and when the expeditionary
        army reassembled, he finally had the time to return to the main
        universe. He had escaped death, and Jenny was burning with passion. The
        two of them finally did it, and the long-distance relationship had come
        to fruition. They seemed to have made up their mind to reproduce, and
        they did not take any safety measures.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        A month ago, Harrison returned to the expeditionary army and left
        Jenny's side.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao looked at the file and said, "No one seems to have recruited
        him. He returned to the expedition army voluntarily."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Because of the Pivotal Snake, Han Xiao did not continue to force
        Harrison to participate in the subsequent expedition. Now, he realized
        that it was Harrison's own doing.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Why is this guy so proactive?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao was curious. Using the Realmless King as a transit station, he
        contacted Harrison, who had been branded.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">A few seconds later, the call connected.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Your Excellency Black Star."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Harrison's remote projection appeared and greeted Han Xiao respectfully.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "There's no need to be so polite. It's like this. Jenny is pregnant, and
        she told me to persuade you not to take the risk with the expeditionary
        army. Furthermore, you're not the only one in the army. How about it? Do
        you want to go back?" Han Xiao went straight to the point.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Harrison shook his head. "I appreciate her kindness, but I won't go
        back."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "I noticed that you joined the expedition willingly. What were you
        thinking?" Han Xiao asked.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Harrison was silent for a moment before slowly saying,
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "When I was on Floating Dragon Island, I came into contact with many
        refugees. Do you know their current state? They live in panic every day.
        Many of them can't take the pressure and choose to free themselves,
        while those who are alive fear the unknown tomorrow. No one knows if
        they will one day become the target of the World Tree invasion. New
        religions are popular, and countless people are looking for comfort.
        Everyone is praying for the war to end soon.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        You said that my luck is very good, and it's very suitable for me to
        find things. I don't know if it's true, but I hope you're right. I hope
        that this illusory luck will be of use and contribute to the end of the
        war as soon as possible."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Han Xiao raised his brows and chuckled.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Not bad, you've made me feel a little respect for you… However, you
        should know that we have a very high chance of winning now that the
        Pivotal Snake is in our hands. The expeditionary army is no longer the
        only way, and it might not be of any use. You're not the only one in the
        army, and your actions might just be a waste of effort and a risk to
        your life. Why not go back and accompany your unborn child?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Harrison shook his head. "I don't want to enjoy myself under your
        protection for these reasons. My colleagues are here, and I don't want
        to run away. Please don't persuade me anymore. I've made up my mind."
        "Alright, I won't persuade you then. Be careful." Han Xiao nodded.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "… If possible, please tell Jenny that I love her."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Little brother, do you know that the moment you say this, your death
        omen is flashing?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Tell her yourself. Who do you think I am? Your mouthpiece?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao clicked his tongue and hung up before Harrison could reply.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Little brother, don't thank me. I'm helping you pull out the flag to
        save your life!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kasuyi listened to the whole conversation from the side and sighed. "You
        have a good officer."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "He wasn't like this in the past. He was at most a curious child, but
        now it seems like he's already an adult."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao paused and smiled. "This person might be a little stupid, but
        the world needs some idiots like him. Maybe he can really give me a
        surprise."

      </h1>
      <p class="calibre3">
        More than ten refugee transport ships were speeding in the planetary
        space, and there was a World Tree fleet chasing after them.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The atmosphere in the cabin of the carrier was tense. Many refugees were
        panicking, especially the ship that was the most heavily damaged, White
        Mountain. You could almost see the word ‘despair' written on the
        refugees' faces.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "The reinforcements haven't arrived yet… If this continues, we'll be
        caught."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The captain of White Mountain was sweating profusely as he stared at the
        ship inspection report on the virtual screen. On the three-dimensional
        virtual model of White Mountain, the functional modules of the ship were
        all red, showing malfunction issues. The entire ship was on the verge of
        collapse, and one-quarter of the 28 propulsion engines were damaged. The
        power of the energy core had also decreased to 74%.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Because some areas were frequently invaded by the World Tree and became
        dangerous areas, some of the refugee planets were no longer safe. The
        galactic alliance army formed a transport team to migrate the refugees
        in these areas, and this small fleet carried this mission to transport
        some refugees.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, halfway through the journey, they happened to meet the World
        Tree fleet that was hiding in their territory. An encounter broke out,
        and the smaller fleet was wiped out. Most of the transport ships were
        destroyed on the spot, and the remaining ships fled in panic, still
        being chased by the World Tree fleet.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As for the White Mountain transport ship, it was the most damaged among
        all the existing starships. Its modules were malfunctioning, and its
        speed gradually decreased, slowing down the entire fleet.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "At most, at most ten minutes, the engine will shut down. There's a
        desolate planet with a serial number in front of us. Should we land?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The vice commander's trembling voice sounded. The captain of White
        Mountain clenched his fists and hesitated.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        If they were forced to land, the people on the entire ship would have no
        way to escape. They could only let the guards on the ship hide on the
        planet with the refugees and wait for reinforcements.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The suggestions of the other captains came through the communication
        channel.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "White Mountain, land. Your ship is no longer able to keep up with the
        speed of the main fleet. We can't slow down and wait for you."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "You will be alone sooner or later. Instead of being paralyzed in space,
        it's better to hide on the planet. At least there's a chance of
        survival."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Leave the White Mountain behind and buy us some time to save more
        refugees."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Some stood on the side of rational analysis, while others made blatant
        requests, trying to persuade the White Mountain to stay. "I understand…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The captain of White Mountain had a helpless look on his face.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He understood that it would be better for them to stay behind and stall
        for time for the refugees on the other ships.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Even so, he felt very guilty. In the report, this batch of refugees was
        just a cold number, but they were all alive at the moment. Using his own
        ship of refugees to help more refugees might be in line with the
        calculation of benefits, but he could not bear to do it logically. These
        refugees were not soldiers, and they had no intention of sacrificing
        themselves. Furthermore, he could not possibly make this decision after
        discussing it with the refugees, or it would most likely cause a mutiny.
        He could only silently lead them to stay behind to cover their retreat
        while others still had hope and believed in the captain. This made him
        feel very uncomfortable.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Just as he was trapped in a dilemma, the desolate planet appeared in
        front of the transport fleet. The eyes of the many captains immediately
        lit up, and they saw a small armed fleet without a symbol docked on the
        surface of the planet. Only when they got close did the radar detect the
        presence of the other party. "There's actually a fleet lying in ambush
        here? They don't look like they're from the World Tree."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Are they our reinforcements? Forget it, no matter who they are, they're
        all part of the galactic society."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Quick, contact the other party and send a signal!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        All of a sudden, the captains were overjoyed. They thought that
        reinforcements had arrived and hurriedly sent out a request for help.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        On the other side, Pangon and the others, who were resting on this
        desolate planet, started discussing.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "This seems to be an escaping refugee fleet. The World Tree fleet is
        chasing after them."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "They're asking us for help. What should we do? Should we help?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Don't help. The lives of the galactic residents under the three
        Universal Civilizations have nothing to do with us. Let's go, don't
        involve ourselves in their affairs."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Everyone quickly exchanged their opinions and reached a consensus.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This group of avengers was not on the side of the three Universal
        Civilizations. Even if the World Tree invaded completely, it would have
        nothing to do with them. It would be extremely benevolent of them not to
        add insult to injury.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Pangon was silent for a while before speaking. "In that case, reject all
        their contact requests and leave immediately."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The captains of the transport fleet were looking forward to the reply of
        this unfamiliar armed fleet, but all their communication requests were
        useless.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The next moment, their expressions changed. This unfamiliar armed fleet
        rose into the sky and ignored the distress signal, heading in another
        direction. It was obvious that they were heading away, meaning they did
        not want to provide support.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "They're gone, not our reinforcements." "Looks like I can't count on
        this group…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">The many captains' hopes were dashed.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Seeing that there was no turning point, the captain of White Mountain
        gritted his teeth and finally made up his mind.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Attention all units. Separate the ship's cargo hold, load all the crew,
        and carry out orbital suppression. Set up the process of turning back to
        face the attack. Cover the departure of the brothers."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Hearing this, everyone's expression turned solemn. They knew that the
        White Mountain had chosen to sacrifice.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Although they hoped that would be the case, they were not too happy when
        it actually happened.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Very soon, the group split up. The majority of the troops continued to
        flee into the distance, while White Mountain slowed down and left the
        troops. It turned around and flew toward the desolate planet. It looked
        like a lone stream of light in a sea of shooting stars. In outer space,
        White Mountain quickly completed its transformation. The thick armor
        shell was no longer locked onto each other, and mechanical parts started
        moving one after another. The entire carrier arched like a shrimp, and
        the cabin on its abdomen separated, turning into an iron-gray escape
        ship. Its body shrunk a lot, and it had practically no armaments as it
        descended toward the planet.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As for the spaceships that remained in place, they were like a hollow
        armor shell that operated on its own. The cannons on the spaceships
        fired fiercely toward the back, trying to stop the World Tree fleet that
        was gradually approaching.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Bang!</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The escape ship landed heavily on the planet's surface, creating a
        crater. All the hatches opened simultaneously, and the refugees who had
        been forced to change their life support equipment rushed out of the
        cabin. They looked up at the sky with despair and panic in their eyes.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The World Tree fleet had already arrived in outer space, and a round of
        fire destroyed the armor shell that they had left in outer space. It
        slowly descended and expanded before everyone's eyes like a shadow.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Why did you stop?!"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Why are you landing here? You've caused us to be surrounded!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The refugees were in an uproar. They glared at the guards beside them
        with hatred and anger. Without their knowledge, the captain had ordered
        the spaceship to land, turning their chance of escape into zero.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Everyone, listen up. Split up with the ship's warriors."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The captain of the White Mountain did not explain. Now was not the time
        to say more. He could only give the order with a stern face.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He knew that everyone's chances of survival were close to zero after
        being forced to surrender, but he still wanted to make a final effort
        and hide with the refugees.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, the next moment, when he saw the actions of the World Tree
        battleships clearly, he finally fell into despair. He saw that the
        cannons of the World Tree fleet were aimed at the planet's surface. They
        were planning to save time and cleanse the planet.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "I'm dead for sure… However, letting the World Tree fleet shoot here for
        a few rounds would delay them. I've fulfilled my mission…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The captain of the White Mountain clenched his fists tightly. His
        expression changed rapidly. He was both unwilling yet relieved.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, just as the people raised their heads and looked at the
        Planetary Obliteration Cannon that destroyed them with fear, a bright
        light suddenly shot from another direction in the starry sky and
        penetrated several World Tree battleships, blowing them up like
        fireworks.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Everyone looked over in shock, only to see a shooting star covered in
        thick flames rapidly approaching. Powerful Pugilist flames shot out like
        heavy cannons, bombarding the World Tree fleet one after another,
        blowing the battleships into pieces.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Behind Pangon was the armed fleet that had just left. In the blink of an
        eye, they had destroyed the World Tree fleet.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The battle did not last long. Under the watchful eyes of the crew of the
        White Mountain, Pangon led the Avengers fleet and quickly wiped out all
        the enemy spaceships in the sky. The huge World Tree fleet was only left
        with wreckage and parts floating in outer space. This wave of escape
        from death made many refugees unable to control their emotions, and the
        crowd cheered wildly.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The captain of the White Mountain seemed to have woken up from a dream.
        He hurriedly asked someone to contact this armed fleet to express his
        gratitude. However, the other party did not reply to him even after they
        had finished fighting the World Tree fleet. It was as if they had only
        done him a small favor and did not even bother to clean up the
        battlefield.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "These obviously are not the people of the Galactic Alliance Army. What
        kind of army is this…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The captain of White Mountain looked at the departing Avengers and
        mumbled to himself.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At this time, Pangon returned to the main ship. His other comrades
        surrounded him with strange expressions.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "You're really something. You promised not to get involved in the war,
        but you suddenly made us turn around and fight."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "If we are targeted by the World Tree because of this battle, it will be
        troublesome. It will not be beneficial for us to accumulate our
        strength."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Whose side are you on?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The attitude of the few of them was as though they were interrogating
        him. Pangon did not mind and waved his hand expressionlessly. "I've
        changed my mind. Although we won't take the initiative to participate in
        the war, if we encounter something like this again in the future, we'll
        save them if we can. Our target of revenge is the regime of the three
        Universal Civilizations, and the ordinary galactic residents have no
        grudges with us."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "This is exposing our existence," one of his comrades said with
        dissatisfaction.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "To Black Star, our existence is not a secret to begin with. If we cause
        any adverse effects to the war, he can tell the three Universal
        Civilizations about us at any time. After all, we have never been on the
        same side." Pangon paused for a moment before continuing, "Furthermore,
        more than half of the galactic society has guessed that the World Tree's
        full invasion is because a traitor leaked the information. Do you think
        Black Star won't suspect us?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Everyone was stunned.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "In his eyes, we have sufficient motive to do so. If we don't express
        our goodwill and let Black Star think that we did it, even if we don't
        participate in the war, we can't stay out of it," Pangon explained.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Hearing this, the few of them looked at each other, slightly shaken.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "You're clearly just a Pugilist, but why do we feel that what you say
        makes sense every time you trick us?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">In a certain place in the secondary dimension.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        A spatial rift opened, and Hayleen flew out from within.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Under the enhancement of her special talent spell and the Leaf Cloak,
        her current state was almost ‘outside the Three Realms and not within
        the Five Elements'. She could not be observed normally.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "The whereabouts of the Pivotal Snake are mysterious. The mother tree
        only has a rough direction and range, and there's no clear location.
        What should I do…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Hayleen was troubled. After accepting the mission of the Ancestral Tree
        King, she had been searching for information about the appearance of the
        Pivotal Snake for the past half a year, but she had never found an
        opportunity to assassinate it.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Furthermore, it seemed like Black Star had always been by the side of
        the Pivotal Snake. To her, that was the most dangerous place in the
        universe. She held onto the principle of not taking risks if she could
        and never dared to go near it.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After thinking about it, the only feasible method that Hayleen could
        think of was to add a ‘snake-killing agent' made by the mother tree to
        some secondary dimensions where the Pivotal Snake often appeared. Then,
        they would wait patiently. If the Hub Serpent ate one of the secondary
        dimensions, it would be poisoned.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Although this method was very random, she did not have a better idea for
        the time being. After all, she could not control the source of food for
        the Pivotal Snake, so she could only spread her net and try her luck.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The only advantage of this method was that it was safer, and she did not
        have to take the risk of being exposed to get close to Black Star,
        giving her a lot of opportunities to test her luck.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Hayleen raised her hand, and a dark green liquid appeared. It was the
        ‘Snake-killing agent' that the Ancestral Tree King had given her.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        With a flick of her finger, a small drop of dark green liquid separated
        and fused into the ground of this secondary dimension. "I hope this
        method works…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Hayleen muttered to herself, not knowing how to proceed.
      </p>

        Chapter 1432: Reverse Halo<span hidden="" class="calibre1"> | </span>
      </h1>
      <p class="calibre3">
        An expedition fleet cruised through the secondary dimensions, passing
        through space cracks.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The strange scenery outside the window flashed past Harrison's eyes one
        after another. He focused on the star map, and the coordinates of the
        secondary dimensions lit up one after another, drawing the trajectory of
        the fleet. Behind him, the other crew members did their jobs.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The aide-de-camp stood at the side, pointed at the star map, and said
        softly, "Following this route, we will cut into the area controlled by
        the World Tree. Although His Excellency Black Star killed the World
        Tree's Blessed Race and caused a gap in their internal defenses, it is
        still very dangerous for us to go deeper."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "I know, but only by going deep into the enemy's territory will we be
        able to find the World Tree's main body. Without risking our lives, how
        can we possibly find anything?" Harrison replied without hesitation.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The aide-de-camp pursed his lips and could not help but say, "Sir, why
        are you working so hard? With your relationship with His Excellency
        Black Star…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Alright, don't say such things anymore. You don't have to persuade me."
        Harrison did not even look up.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">The aide-de-camp smiled bitterly.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Do you think I care about you? The main thing is that if you shrink
        back, we can use your relationship to go back and rest…
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The aide-de-camp said with resignation, "I think we'll give free kills."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "If you have the time to worry, you might as well pray that we're safe
        and sound," Harrison replied casually. "If praying is useful, what's the
        point of having an army?" The aide-de-camp muttered softly.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Harrison glanced at him and was about to say something when he suddenly
        frowned and looked out of the window.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">So</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Something's wrong…" "What's wrong?" The aide-de-camp was curious.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"I feel uneasy," Harrison whispered.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">"…Quick! Weapon charge, prepare for battle!"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The aide-de-camp and the rest of the crew panicked. They immediately
        yelled and ordered the fleet to enter combat mode.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        They had no choice but to take it seriously. Last time, when Harrison
        was feeling uneasy, the expeditionary army outpost was gone. In their
        eyes, Harrison was a jinx. If he had any headache or fever, it meant
        that they were going to suffer together. Harrison looked at the radar
        screen vigilantly, but there was no abnormal reaction. The uneasiness in
        his heart gradually disappeared, and his brows relaxed.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Could it be an illusion…"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Harrison was a little confused, but he shook his head. Since he did not
        discover anything, he was not sure if his senses had gone wrong.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Sir, don't scare us!"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Hearing this, everyone secretly heaved a sigh of relief, their faces
        filled with helplessness. They thought it was his bad taste.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The expedition fleet quickly disappeared along the space crack. After
        they left, a translucent figure appeared in this secondary dimension. It
        was Hayleen.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "The exploration team of the three Universal Civilizations…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Hayleen looked in the direction where the fleet disappeared. Her
        expression changed a few times, but she did not attack in the end.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        During this time, she had been searching for suitable secondary
        dimensions to add the snake-killing agent. Occasionally, she would meet
        the troops of the three Universal Civilizations.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As the World Tree currently did not need to steal intelligence, she did
        not make a move. After all, there were other World Tree Blessed Races to
        deal with these people, and she did not want to alert them and expose
        herself. Her mission was more important.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, the expeditionary army was also useful to her. According to the
        routes of some fleets, together with the mother tree's reaction to the
        Pivotal Snake, Hayleen had screened out areas that might be frequented
        by the Pivotal Snake during this period, as well as some secondary
        dimensions that might be chosen by the Pivotal Snake as food. All of
        them were injected with the snake-killing agents. This time was no
        exception. Hayleen silently activated her space magic, found the traces
        of Harrison's fleet, and flew toward their direction. Very soon, she
        arrived at a strange, rocky secondary dimension. The violent radiation
        dust storm turned into tornadoes, and there was no sign of life in the
        entire dimension. "This place isn't bad."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Hayleen nodded. As far as she knew, this type of secondary dimension
        that did not give birth to life but had different substances was the
        favorite food for the Pivotal Snake. The pure energy type secondary
        dimension was not liked by it. Maybe it was because of the texture,
        after all, those with substances were very crispy. She popped out the
        snake-killing agent and watched it integrate into the secondary
        dimension. Only then did she use a teleportation spell to leave and find
        her next target.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Half a month later.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Realmless King led the Pivotal Snake through the secondary dimension
        world. The dense mechanical army protected them like a black cloud.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As they passed by the secondary dimensions, everyone would stop for a
        while to observe the reaction of the Pivotal Snake. If the Pivotal Snake
        did not start eating, they would continue to go to the next place.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Although all secondary dimensions were food, the Pivotal Snake would not
        stuff all of them into its mouth. After all, its appetite was limited,
        and it needed time to digest after eating. As long as it was not
        extremely hungry, the Pivotal Snake would only start to eat when it met
        a secondary dimension that suited its taste. As the saying went, it was
        easy to go from frugal to extravagant, but it was difficult to go from
        extravagant to frugal. It did not need to find its own food, so its
        taste was getting more and more picky.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After a while, they arrived at a strange, rocky secondary dimension. The
        Pivotal Snake immediately started twisting and turning. It took a fancy
        to this food, and without caring about the others, it started to feast
        on it. The white fog on its body spread out, and everywhere it passed,
        the matter was ground and swallowed.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Seeing this, the Realmless King and the mechanical army retreated to the
        side and did not disturb the Pivotal Snake's meal.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Seeing that the Pivotal Snake was eating happily, the Realmless King
        sighed in his heart.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"It's getting more and more troublesome."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Realmless King yielded to Han Xiao's tyrannical power and
        unwillingly became the stockman of the Pivotal Snake. Even though his
        lifespan was almost infinite, he felt like his life had given him a
        heavy blow when he thought about the fact that he would still have to
        rear the Pivotal Snake for decades. His b*lls hurt so bad… although he
        did not have this part.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The most terrifying thing was that Black Star still had three embryos.
        When all of them were hatched, wouldn't it be four times the happiness
        for this stockman?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Furthermore, Black Star would definitely force them to give birth to
        little snakes. One begets two, two begets three, and three begets all
        things; there would be unlimited offspring…
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Damn it! When will these days end?!</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Realmless King felt as if he could see his own bitter future, and he
        shuddered.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Just as he was feeling sad for his fate, the Pivotal Snake that was
        eating suddenly stopped and twisted violently, collapsing mountains one
        after another. It looked in extreme pain as if someone had suddenly
        stuffed a spoon of mustard into its mouth while eating
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"What's going on?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Realmless King was shocked, and he hurriedly came forward to control
        the Pivotal Snake. The mechanical troops also quickly surrounded it.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, the Pivotal Snake that was restrained by everyone was still
        struggling with all its might, like a lively fish being pressed onto a
        chopping board.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Psionic Prime quickly scanned the vital signs of the Pivotal Snake and
        said coldly, "Something's not right. The life force of the Pivotal Snake
        is rapidly withering, and some unknown compound has already spread in
        its body. It seems to be a genetic toxin specifically targeted at it,
        and it has already caused irreversible damage. The damage is still
        increasing, so it should have been plotted against!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "There are enemies nearby?" The Realmless King was shocked. He
        immediately released all his senses, but he did not discover anything.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Our radar can't find him either. I've already summoned the Lord. He'll
        be here soon."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The moment Psionic Prime finished speaking, a light appeared beside him.
        It was Han Xiao.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"What's going on?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao immediately noticed the abnormal situation of the Pivotal
        Snake. His expression changed slightly, and without hesitation, he poked
        the Pivotal Snake. The combat information immediately popped up on the
        interface.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This time, Psionic Prime and the other Mechanical Oracles walked up to
        him and said with guilt, "We are sorry, we fell into the enemy's trap
        unknowingly. This is our negligence. Please punish us…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Alright, take your leave." Han Xiao did not have the time to care about
        them. He waved his hands and looked at the interface.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At this time, in the status bar of the Pivotal Snake, there was a
        negative status of (Heavy Poisoning). It was introduced as the genetic
        toxin specially concocted by the World Tree, and it was only targeted at
        the Pivotal Snake Race. Once it entered the body, it would cause the
        gene sequence to shatter. It was completely irreversible, causing the
        Pivotal Snake's health to decrease at a rate of 1.5% per second, and its
        maximum health decreased at a rate of 0.5% per second. He released his
        senses and scanned the area, but he did not sense the presence of any
        outsiders. He asked about the situation just now and roughly guessed how
        the Pivotal Snake was affected.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "‘Damn, they tampered with the meal and happened to pick the correct
        target. What kind of luck was this…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Han Xiao's eyes twitched.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        With so many secondary dimensions and the random selection of food by
        the Pivotal Snake, it just had to hit the jackpot. What kind of
        probability was this?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Could it be that so many mascots could not slightly dilute my Heavenly
        Execution Grade luck?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao thought to himself. Seeing how much health the Pivotal Snake
        had lost, he took out a tube of Aurora Potion and injected it into the
        Pivotal Snake's body. The effect was immediate, and its health
        immediately recovered.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, the effect of being poisoned did not weaken. It still hung on
        its stats window. Although its health bar was full, the upper limit was
        still falling. Seeing this, Han Xiao injected a few more shots of Aurora
        Potion into the Pivotal Snake. The HP regeneration was the same, but it
        could not get rid of the poisoned status.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "This poison is quite powerful…" Han Xiao's eyes narrowed. If he was
        given some time, he would be able to try and crack it. However, with the
        speed of losing HP in this poison state, it only needed 200 seconds to
        clear the upper limit of the Pivotal Snake's health. This amount of time
        was not enough.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Alright, let's experiment with my previous idea."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao activated (Life TransformationVirtual] on the suffering Pivotal
        Snake.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Now that he had three embryos in his hands, with the cost of trial and
        error, he originally wanted to experiment on the newborn baby. He did
        not expect this Pivotal Snake to have an accident, so he might as well
        try this idea on it.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Streams of data flashed across the body of the Pivotal Snake, and it
        slowly began to turn incorporeal. Its pain also began to decrease
        rapidly. The World Tree's toxin targeted the biological genes. At this
        moment, the life form of the Pivotal Snake began to change, and it
        gradually became immune to the toxin effect.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        During this process, because the body of the Pivotal Snake was turning
        incorporeal, the toxins in its body automatically came out and condensed
        into a drop of black-green liquid that floated in midair.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Seeing that the situation had stabilized, Han Xiao raised his hand to
        collect this drop of poison. He narrowed his eyes and activated [Bold
        Explorer) without hesitation.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Although I'm not afraid of such methods, since you dared to send people
        here to do something, I can't let you escape so easily."

        At the same time, somewhere in the secondary dimension world, Hayleen
        was wandering around, choosing a new target.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Very soon, she arrived in a blue liquid world. She popped out the
        snake-killing agent and watched it dissolve in the liquid. As she
        worked, her thoughts drifted away.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"I wonder if the poison I planted earlier worked…"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Hayleen murmured.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        She could only plant the poison everywhere, but she did not dare go back
        to check. If the Pivotal Snake was infected, Black Star would definitely
        be waiting nearby. If she went over, there might be some risk.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The only way to determine if the plan was successful was to determine
        the status of the Pivotal Snake based on the mother tree's reaction. If
        the mother tree's reaction to the Pivotal Snake weakened or disappeared,
        it would mean that the Pivotal Snake was dead. In that case, she would
        not have to check which trap the Pivotal Snake had fallen into.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Therefore, Hayleen felt that she was still in a safe situation. All she
        needed to do was to set up the traps. As long as the mother tree gave
        her feedback, she would be able to retreat.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After adding the snake-killing agent to the blue secondary dimension in
        front of her, Hayleen was about to turn around and leave. However, at
        this moment, the voice of the Ancestral Tree King suddenly came from the
        mental network, bringing good news.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "The mother tree's connection to the Pivot Snake is rapidly weakening.
        Your method should have succeeded."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "It really succeeded? So fast " The chances are so low, I thought it
        would take at least a few years for the Pivotal Snake to choose the
        secondary dimension that I tampered with…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Hayleen's eyes lit up with joy. She had thought that she might need to
        spend two to three years planting snake-killing agents in enough
        secondary dimensions so that the Pivotal Snake would have a higher
        chance of falling for it. However, the plan had only started half a year
        ago. There were not many secondary dimensions that were injected with
        the poison, but the Pivotal Snake had chosen one so quickly. What kind
        of probability was this? What kind of luck was this ?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In less than a year, she had successfully resolved the biggest threat to
        the World Tree. It was a pleasant surprise!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Ancestral Tree King was also in a good mood. He had planned to let
        Hayleen carry out this mission for a long time, and had not expected it
        to work so quickly.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Don't ask why, but if you had to ask, it was God's will!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This was definitely the blessing of the Goddess of Luck!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Come back. When the Mother Tree confirms that the Pivotal Snake is
        dead, the position of the Tree King will be yours."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Alright, I'll go back now!"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Suppressing her excitement, Hayleen was about to open the transportation
        door and return.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, just as she was about to return with excitement, the Ancestral
        Tree King suddenly interrupted her.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Wait a minute, the mother tree's reaction has changed…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"What now?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "The mother tree's connection with the Pivot Snake has stopped
        declining, and it's becoming stronger instead… Strange, this is too
        abnormal. What happened?" The Ancestral Tree King's tone became heavy.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The stronger the World Tree's reaction to the Pivotal Snake, it
        signified the more mature the Pivotal Snake would be. Right now, it was
        only a rough perception range, and they could only accurately determine
        each other's location when it reached adulthood.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Just a moment ago, after the signal of the Pivotal Snake weakened for a
        while, it suddenly rose in reverse and quickly exceeded its previous
        limit, still rising.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Hayleen paused in shock.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Why is this happening ?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">"You didn't do anything unnecessary, did</p>
      <p class="calibre3">you?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The intensity of the sense was still increasing. The Ancestral Tree King
        felt that something was wrong, and his tone was filled with doubt.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Absolutely not! I've always been focused on setting traps. Even when I
        coincidentally met the three Universal Civilizations' fleets, I never
        took action!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Hayleen was so anxious that she almost swore an oath and shared the
        relevant memories on the mental network.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Ancestral Tree King quickly scanned through her experiences over the
        past half a year, but he did not find anything out of the ordinary. With
        a grave expression, he said, "There's only one explanation. Black Star
        used some method to save the Pivotal Snake, and he even sped up its
        growth…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Before he finished his sentence, the mother tree's consciousness
        suddenly became agitated, as if it was feeling intense panic.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, the sensitivity of the Pivotal Snake seemed to have broken
        through some kind of restriction. A large area of its detection range
        suddenly disappeared, turning into a precise coordinate in the blink of
        an eye!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Ancestral Tree King's eyes widened in shock, and his mind went
        blank.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The connection between the World Tree and the Pivotal Snake was two-way.
        When the World Tree could accurately locate the Pivotal Snake, it meant
        that the Pivotal Snake had entered adulthood and could locate the
        precise coordinates of the World Tree.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This meant that… the mother tree's location had been exposed!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        If he had not confirmed that the mother tree would not lie to him, he
        would have suspected that the poison that the mother tree had concocted
        was actually the catalyst for the maturation of the Pivotal Snake.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">The Ancestral Tree King was confused.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        I sent people to assassinate the Pivotal Snake. Even if she failed, they
        would only lose one high-level combatant. Why did it cause the Pivotal
        Snake to mature?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Not only did we not solve this threat, we even shortened the time it
        took for this hidden danger to erupt… We originally had a few decades to
        deal with it, but now, this little bit of buffer time is gone. We are
        now facing imminent danger without any mental preparations.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">What should I do?</p>
      <p class="calibre3">"How could this be…"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Hayleen was stunned as well. Before the two of them could recover from
        their shock, a space crack suddenly opened in this secondary dimension.
        Han Xiao stepped into the void and slowly walked out.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao looked around and quickly locked onto a seemingly empty area.
        It was actually where Hayleen was hiding.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Do you want to come out yourself, or do you want me to invite you?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Hayleen was shocked.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The series of unforeseen events had already thrown her into chaos. She
        did not expect Black Star to find her so quickly, and with just a
        glance, he had already seen through the stealth effect of the Leaf
        Concealment Robe and locked onto her location.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Stop hiding. You can't escape from my senses."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao did not wait. Beams of mechanical particles flowed along his
        arm and turned into a circular device, releasing an invisible force
        field toward Hayleen.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In the empty space, Hayleen's figure suddenly appeared and rippled.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Seeing that her position was exposed, Hayleen was shocked and hurriedly
        opened the transportation door to retreat. However, at this moment, Han
        Xiao raised his hand and grabbed it. A mechanical disc rose from the
        back of his head like a crown of light, freezing the space and
        shattering her teleportation spell.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Following this, a bunch of Mechanical Oracles surged out from the
        Mechanical Force and surrounded Hayleen, but they did not attack
        immediately.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Crap…"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Hayleen felt despair in her heart. The difference in strength was too
        great. She could not fight a Transcendent alone. She clenched her teeth
        and made up her mind to fight to the death. However, at this moment, the
        shocked voice of the Ancestral Tree King suddenly sounded in her mind.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Wait a minute, why is the mother tree's coordinates of the Pivot Snake
        on Black Star?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Hayleen was stunned. She took a look and was shocked.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The mother tree had locked onto the Pivotal Snake coordinates, and it
        was Black Star… what was going on ? This time, Han Xiao did not make a
        move immediately. Instead, he looked at Hayleen with interest and said,
        "Your idea of ambushing the Pivotal Snake was quite good, but it's
        useless. I know that you have the mental network to contact each other
        regardless of distance. Help me send a message to the Ancestral Tree
        King. I already know the location of your World Tree's main body. You've
        already lost this battle."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"What did you do…" Hayleen could not help but ask.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Are you referring to how I got rid of the genetic toxin you guys
        released?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao smiled. He raised his hand, and a translucent snake appeared in
        his palm. It was the Pivotal Snake that had been transformed into a
        Virtual Life Form.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Pivotal Snake had transformed into a Virtual Life Form, and Han Xiao
        had instilled a large amount of data into it, nurturing it through
        artificial intelligence.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The result made him overjoyed. His previous idea was correct. The
        Pivotal Snake in the Virtual Life Form had escaped the limit of normal
        growth, and it could mature quickly this way. The connection between the
        Pivotal Snake and the World Tree in the Information Form did not
        disappear because of the Pivotal Snake's life form change. Both parties
        still had a two-way connection.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        From (Bold Explorer), Han Xiao saw the World Tree's assassination plan.
        He originally thought that he was unlucky, but after seeing the short
        interaction between Hayleen and Harrison, he was a little uncertain and
        had a bold guess.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Maybe it was the effect of Harrison's Halo that made Hayleen choose the
        food of the Pivotal Snake, which indirectly led to the Pivotal Snake
        turning into a Virtual Life Form, maturing in advance and sensing the
        coordinates of the World Tree… Although it did not sound probable, Han
        Xiao felt that anything was possible to a protagonist-type character.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Because the Virtual Life Form was controlled by Han Xiao, he simply
        stored the Pivotal Snake in the Godly Stronghold and turned it into a
        tool. This way, even if the World Tree could lock onto the Pivotal Snake
        in reverse, the coordinates would only be his location. There was no way
        to avoid him no matter what they did.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Seeing this through the mental network, the Ancestral Tree King's face
        turned ashen. He immediately understood the current situation.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        I'm afraid we no longer have the chance to remove the threat of the
        Pivotal Snake…
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At this time, Han Xiao narrowed his eyes and said to Hayleen,
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Although you're here to assassinate the Pivotal Snake, you did me a
        favor. You could be considered a hero of the three Universal
        Civilizations. I'll make an exception and give you a chance to live."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"…What are you going to do?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "I will seal you up. Maybe after we get rid of the World Tree, you would
        still have a chance to survive. You have nowhere to run now, so you
        might as well accept the seal. Don't make me waste my energy." Han Xiao
        raised his brows.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"I…"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Hayleen sounded hesitant as if she was conflicted.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, the next moment, she suddenly jumped up and retreated. A series
        of instantaneous spells were thrown out, creating a path in the
        mechanical army.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, before she could do anything, the Mechanical Oracles around her
        attacked together and suppressed Hayleen instantly. Han Xiao moved
        closer to Hayleen and grabbed her neck with one hand.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Looks like you won't give up until you see your coffin."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao narrowed his eyes and put strength in his hand to crush her
        protective spell, and threw her toward the Mechanical Oracles.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        An intense battle immediately broke out, but there was no suspense in
        the battle. The one-sided battle did not last long. Hayleen, who was at
        the end of her rope, was crushed by the group of Mechanical Oracles
        until she was almost paralyzed.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Seeing this, Han Xiao floated in front of her, pressed down on her head,
        and activated his ability. Not long after, the Spacetime Amber took
        form, and Hayleen's sorrowful and humiliated expression froze.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Congratulations to the Lord for catching the culprit. Nothing in this
        world can hide from your eyes," Psionic Prime said.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Alright, you're not suitable for flattery. Go back."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Han Xiao waved his hands and felt relieved.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        If not for the World Tree's plot, he would not have been able to make up
        his mind to experiment on the Pivotal Snake so quickly. The World Tree
        was just throwing stones at its own feet.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Since the coordinates are already in my hands, I'll call Harrison back…
        Speaking of which, I think I've taken advantage of his halo."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao thought about it and called the Realmless King to act as a
        transit station to contact Harrison.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Before long, Harrison's remote projection appeared.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Your Excellency Black Star, what can I do for you?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Don't participate in the expedition. Come back."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Harrison was a little surprised. "Huh? Didn't we talk about this before?
        I remember you promised not to persuade me. I've decided to contribute
        to the galactic society…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Before he could finish, Han Xiao interrupted him and smiled.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Things are different now. The situation has changed. I have already
        grasped the exact coordinates of the World Tree's main body and no
        longer need the expeditionary army. You don't have to take the
        unnecessary risk."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Harrison was stunned. "Your Excellency Black Star, are you trying to
        trick me into going back? How long has it been?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao smiled and said, "It's all thanks to your luck this time. If
        not for you, I might not have been able to determine the location of the
        World Tree so quickly. Strictly speaking, part of the credit belongs to
        you. You've already made a huge contribution to ending this war, so you
        can leave now. It's decided. I'll teleport over later and bring you
        back."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">With that, he hung up.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        On the other side, Harrison scratched his head in confusion.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        No, what did I do? How did I make such a huge contribution? Why don't I
        know about it?

      <p class="calibre3">
        Secondary Dimension World, World Tree Civilization Control Area, Tree
        King Palace.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The moment his mental connection with Hayleen was cut off, and the
        Ancestral Tree King knew that she had been sealed by Black Star. He
        closed his eyes silently with a gloomy expression.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "What should we do?" The Fortitude Tree King looked over and asked with
        a complicated tone.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Ancestral Tree King pressed his brows as his expression changed.
        There was frustration, disappointment, and regret.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After a moment of silence, he opened his eyes again and spoke with a
        helpless and weak expression.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "…Retract all the troops outside and return to the secondary dimensional
        zone. All troops are to protect the mother tree."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Are we giving up on the invasion?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Now is not the time to consider how to invade the enemy. It's time to
        guard against the enemy's counterattack."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Ancestral Tree King's expression was grave, and a hint of
        unwillingness flashed through his eyes.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The coordinates of the mother tree's main body had been exposed. If it
        had been an ordinary opponent, the World Tree Civilization would not
        have been so flustered. They could have sealed the dimension and
        deployed a large number of troops to guard it. Even if the enemy wanted
        to attack the mother tree's main body, they would have to cross
        countless lines of defense.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, the three Universal Civilizations happened to be able to
        counter this tactic. The Multi-Dimensional Sky Opening Transportation
        Device could ignore any space blockade and pass through any defensive
        line. Once the coordinates of the mother tree were exposed, it would
        give the three Universal Civilizations a chance to raid their home.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Ancestral Tree King did not dare take the risk and had no choice but
        to withdraw all his troops to protect the mother tree's main body. The
        attack and defense had already changed, and now it was his turn to worry
        about the three Universal Civilizations' invasion.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In the eyes of the Ancestral Tree King, this method was like quenching
        his thirst with poison. Even if he could defeat the armies of the three
        Universal Civilizations time and time again, the Pivotal Snake was
        completely controlled by Black Star and could locate the mother tree's
        body at any time. It was equivalent to the World Tree never having a day
        of peace. The Ancestral Tree King could not think of a way to turn the
        tables. The civilization had been growing for so long, and he did not
        know how long it had been since they fell into such a desperate
        situation.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After hunting so many civilizations, they had finally met a tough
        opponent.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Is there really no other way?" the Fortitude Tree King asked softly.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Yes, and it's very simple. As long as we kill Black Star, everything
        will be solved." The Ancestral Tree King was expressionless.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "…If I could kill him, I would have done so long ago." Fortitude Tree
        King had a bitter expression.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Therefore, the war is no longer in our hands. The long-term strategy
        has already lost its executional environment. The only thing we can do
        now is to react accordingly."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">The Ancestral Tree King's tone was bitter.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At this point, he did not know where his fate was going.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">...</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The order of the Tree King was transmitted to all the officers through
        the mental network. Regardless of whether they were shocked, panicked,
        or unwilling, all the officers obediently followed the order.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The World Tree fleet that had stirred up trouble within the three
        Universal Civilizations retreated in batches, and the army stationed
        outside the Flickering World also abandoned their strongholds and left
        using wormholes.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The sudden withdrawal of the World Tree left many reinforcements of the
        Galactic Alliance Army in dismay. Many people were confused and did not
        know what the World Tree was doing.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This information was quickly passed on and attracted the attention of
        the upper echelons.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In the Strategic Command of the Galactic Alliance Army, an emergency
        meeting was underway.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The remote projections of the three Universal Civilizations' leaders
        were present. They received a report from the Adviser Department and
        were very surprised. They attended the meeting together and listened to
        the military analyze the reason for the World Tree's withdrawal.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "The World Tree clearly had the initiative and could harass and devour
        our territory as much as they wanted, but now, it suddenly stopped
        invading. Not only that, even the armies outside the Flickering World
        border have been retracted. This situation is quite strange, and we
        don't know the reason. What do you guys think?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Commander Simon's tone was grave.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Everyone present had a serious look on their faces as they stared at the
        virtual strategic sand table.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        They would not be optimistic that the World Tree retreating was a good
        thing. From their perspective, there had to be a reason behind such an
        unreasonable action.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        From the military's perspective, the World Tree was most likely going to
        cause trouble, but they did not know the enemy's target, so the
        atmosphere was rather tense, and the air was filled with anxiety.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Teny knocked on the table and said with a deep voice, "According to the
        calculations of the General Staff, the sudden withdrawal of the World
        Tree might be a ploy to mislead our judgment. An unknown large-scale
        military operation is brewing behind our backs, and the target is likely
        to be our Central Galaxy, the mother planet of the three Universal
        Civilizations!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Hearing this, everyone's expression became even more serious.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "In that case, we must continue to strengthen the defenses of our mother
        planet! The World Tree has retreated at the edge of the storm, and the
        plan they have is definitely not a simple formality. If we relax, they
        might really succeed!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Simon's expression was solemn, and his voice was firm.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This time, an Arcane Church's officer hesitated for a moment before
        saying, "Does no one think that something might have happened within the
        World Tree?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Pope turned to look at him and solemnly replied, "We cannot place
        our hopes on the enemy's own problems. We have to consider the
        worst-case scenario first."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At this moment, the President of the Federation, Louis, pondered and
        said, "There must be a reason for the World Tree to retreat. Could it be
        that the traitor secretly leaked some information to the World Tree,
        causing them to make a new decision?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As soon as he said that, the expressions of all the officers turned
        solemn.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In the past half a year, the three Universal Civilizations had been
        resisting the invasion of the World Tree while investigating the
        traitors internally. There were many suspects, but there was no way to
        confirm the culprit.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Under the pressure of the enemy, the three Universal Civilizations did
        not dare to wantonly engage in the senseless slaughter of those
        suspected. The cooperation between the Galactic Alliance Army was not
        easy to come by, and they were also afraid of causing internal unrest by
        wrongly accusing their innocent allies.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Marbruce agreed. "This is also a possibility. The existence of traitors
        is still an unstable factor, and it's most likely to lead to all kinds
        of variables."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "We still have to come up with an effective method to expose the
        traitor," the Pope emphasized.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Just as everyone was discussing, another remote projection suddenly
        appeared in the conference room.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Everyone turned around and saw that it was Black Star.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Yo, the meeting has already started. Looks like you guys didn't wait
        for me."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao looked around and nodded in acknowledgement to everyone. They
        nodded back in return.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As one of the pillars of the war, he naturally received an invitation to
        the meeting. However, in order to confirm the coordinates of the mother
        tree that the Pivotal Snake sensed, he was delayed for a while.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"You're late," Marbruce said helplessly.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Han Xiao waved his hands.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Don't worry about the details. What were you guys talking about?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Simon took the initiative to explain.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "The World Tree suddenly retreated and stopped the invasion. We're
        guessing their motive for doing this… The most likely possibility is
        that the World Tree is preparing a large-scale military operation
        against the mother planet of the three Universal Civilizations. Also,
        the traitor might have leaked new information."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Oh? Has the World Tree retreated?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Han Xiao blinked. He only knew about this now.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He thought about it and understood the motive of the World Tree
        Civilization.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Alright, don't scare yourselves. The World Tree retreated because they
        were afraid."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Afraid?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Everyone looked at each other, not understanding what Han Xiao meant.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Pope coughed and said, "Black Star, stop joking. This is a very
        serious matter."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Who has the time to joke with you?" Han Xiao clicked his tongue. "I've
        managed to get the Pivotal Snake to mature, and now I've grasped the
        precise coordinates of the World Tree's main body. The World Tree sensed
        this through a two-way connection. They retreated because they were
        afraid that we would attack them directly. They went back to defend.
        There's no other possibility."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "You found the location of the World Tree? Really?!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The three of them were stunned. Suddenly, they were overjoyed but also a
        little terrified, afraid that this was fake news.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Everyone's body trembled, and their expressions changed drastically.
        They stared at Han Xiao in disbelief.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        It was not until Han Xiao gave an affirmative answer that the three
        leaders and the officers were truly excited.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"How did you do it?!"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Marbruce hurriedly asked, and everyone looked at Han Xiao.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Seeing this, Han Xiao did not hide anything and briefly told them about
        Hayleen's assassination. He then emphasized that the Pivotal Snake had
        already unlocked its sensing ability, which made everyone excited.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Due to the existence of the Pivotal Snake, everyone had always been very
        confident in this war, but that was only with regards to their
        confidence in the long-term trend. They had originally thought that they
        would have to last for at least a few decades under the all-out invasion
        of the World Tree before the outcome could be decided, but they did not
        expect Black Star to solve the key problem at this stage.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This was equivalent to reducing the war losses for the galactic society
        for decades, allowing the officers to be freed in advance.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Good job! This way, the initiative is in our hands!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Marbruce clenched his fists and was overjoyed.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        While he was overjoyed, he also felt a little ashamed. While they were
        still thinking about how to capture the traitor, Black Star had already
        found the key to ending the war and regained control. The two of them
        were on completely different levels.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Ever since the start of the war, Black Star had appeared almost every
        time, and now, he had given the three Universal Civilizations a chance
        to win. The three of them did not think it was an exaggeration to say
        that he was the one who led the war.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This time, Han Xiao waved his hand and said casually,
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "There's no need to say anything else. The World Tree's weakness has
        been exposed, and it has completely fallen into a passive state. It's
        time for us to gather a large force to attack and completely end this
        enemy… The World Tree is at the end of its rope in this war!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Upon hearing this, Simon immediately stood up with a sharp look in his
        eyes.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Your Excellency Black Star is right. It's time for us to blow the horn
        of our counterattack!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As soon as he said that, everyone stood up and looked at the three
        leaders with stern expressions.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Please give the order!"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Seeing this, the expressions of Marbruce, Louis, and the Pope turned
        serious. They nodded heavily and declared solemnly,
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Good! From now on, we will make strategic adjustments. Our primary goal
        is no longer to defend our homeland, but to completely destroy the World
        Tree Civilization!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Understood!"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The officers responded in unison with stern expressions.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Han Xiao, who was watching from the side, smirked.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Although he and the three Universal Civilizations had the same goal of
        defeating the World Tree Civilization, their specific needs were
        different.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        From the perspective of the three Universal Civilizations, the
        destruction of the World Tree was the most reassuring.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, from Han Xiao's perspective… he could only say that their
        intentions of working together to defend against the enemies were
        sincere, and using each other was also sincere.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        When the main conflict is resolved, the differences between me and the
        three Universal Civilizations will also surface. Even if these people
        thank me now, who knows what will happen after.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Han Xiao pondered, secretly calculating his odds.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">...</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As the World Tree retreated, the intense battle between the two sides
        stopped, causing the explored universe to suddenly become silent.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        When the galactic residents were not mentally prepared, the flames of
        war suddenly extinguished, just like when the World Tree invaded.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The upper echelons of the three Universal Civilizations came to a
        consensus, and the changes in their strategy were quickly carried out.
        The Galactic Alliance Army no longer patrolled their territory but
        started to gather in the Central Galaxy.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Sensing the change in the situation, the countless galactic residents
        who were originally in a state of panic were stunned and confused, not
        knowing what to make of the situation.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        There were many different opinions on the internet, and the Star
        Alliance Observer hiding in the desolate universe belt was confused by
        the withdrawal of the World Tree.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        They did not know the secret of the Pivotal Snake and were still in the
        dark. They could only access the public information on the network, thus
        at this moment, they were completely confused.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Strange, the World Tree should have been devouring the three Universal
        Civilizations. Why did it suddenly leave?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In the secret base, many of the Star Alliance observers were confused.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        They had leaked the information because they wanted to lead the World
        Tree to destroy the three Universal Civilizations. In the past half a
        year, the World Tree's actions had perfectly met their expectations,
        allowing them to watch from the side.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Originally, things were going according to their plan, and they were
        just enjoying the show when the World Tree suddenly slipped away. The
        Star Alliance observers were caught off guard.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "The World Tree definitely has its reasons for doing this. They might
        not be satisfied with small skirmishes and are gathering their troops,
        preparing to make a big fuss!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Observer captain analyzed for a while and concluded.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Hearing this, many members felt that it made sense, and the surprise in
        their hearts turned into anticipation.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At this moment, the Star Alliance's spies did not know that the World
        Tree Civilization, which they had placed high hopes on, was already in a
        dire situation.
      </p>

      </h1>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The news of the turn of the battle quickly spread to the upper echelons
        of the Galactic Alliance Army. The allied civilizations that were
        originally troubled by the World Tree's invasion were pleasantly
        surprised. They worked together with the three Universal Civilizations
        to gather their forces, and the armies of the various Star Fields all
        flowed toward the Central Galaxy.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The fact that Han Xiao had matured the Pivotal Snake in advance was also
        made known to the various civilizations. Although Black Star had guided
        the war on more than one occasion, the impact it had on the upper
        echelons this time was still shocking. Everyone was originally prepared
        to fight hard for decades, but they suddenly realized that they did not
        need to suffer anymore and had the chance to achieve their task in one
        battle.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        If the invasion of the World Tree was a disease, then Black Star had
        already developed a treatment to cure the illness before the health of
        the galactic society was greatly damaged, saving countless lives. With
        decades of wartime reduced, countless refugees and soldiers were saved.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Although it was a little corny, many upper echelons felt that using the
        word ‘hero' to describe Black Star's contributions to this war was not a
        problem at all.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As an important part of the Galactic Alliance Army, the upper echelons
        of the Super Star Cluster Alliance also received this information, and
        they could not help but be stunned.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "I didn't expect the situation to change so quickly…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In the conference room, the upper echelons of the Super Star Cluster
        gathered with complicated expressions. More than half a year ago, Black
        Star had forced them to terminate the relocation plan. Although the
        Super Star Cluster Alliance had lowered their heads, they naturally had
        some grievances in their hearts. Due to the agreement between the two
        sides, they could only stay for the time being, but they still did not
        plan to give up on the relocation plan. They originally wanted to use
        two to three years to observe the situation, and once the situation
        turned bad, they could restart the relocation plan at any time.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">ev</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, they did not expect that in less than a year, the ‘great
        situation' would be turned around by Han Xiao. The full invasion of the
        World Tree crumbled apart, causing the three Universal Civilizations to
        be free. This way, even if they wanted to migrate, they would lose the
        prerequisite. The current explored universe did not have a chaotic
        environment for them to carry out this plan. If they insisted, the three
        Universal Civilizations would have enough energy to deal with them.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Sigh, we can't leave even if we want to. It's all because of Black
        Star. We didn't seize the opportunity." Someone was frustrated.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Star Arc leader shook his head and said helplessly, "You're wrong.
        This is a blessing in disguise. If not for Black Star stopping us from
        carrying out this plan, we would have been in trouble."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Everyone thought about it and agreed.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        No one had foreseen that in just half a year, the World Tree would be
        overwhelmed by Black Star. If they had really decided to migrate, they
        would have been screwed. This amount of time was not enough to complete
        the entire relocation plan, and they would not have been able to go far.
        At the same time, there would be no turning back for them, and they
        would be treated as traitors who leaked the information and become the
        target of public criticism. In that case, this was a blessing in
        disguise, and they had to thank Brother Black Star ?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Upon realizing this, everyone shivered.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At this moment, the Star Arc Leader said, "I feel that Black Star has
        already anticipated this change. After all, he has always been in
        control of the Pivotal Snake, and the current situation is in his grasp.
        Back then, he came to us and insisted that we give up on migrating.
        Other than taking into consideration the overall situation, he might
        have given us a subtle reminder and used his method to help us avoid
        this trap."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Hearing this, the eyes of the Super Star Cluster upper echelons
        flickered.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Star Arc Leader looked around, paused, and continued.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Black Star did this not because he has any relationship with us, but
        because of the benefits. Just as he said, after the war ends, the
        conflict between the three Universal Civilizations and the Beyond Grade
        A Association still exists. He needs an ally with enough weight to help
        him expand further, so he helped us this time."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"…What a dangerous guy."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Many upper echelons of the Super Star Cluster shook their heads and
        sighed at Black Star's farsightedness.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        While they were still focused on the war, Black Star had already begun
        to plan for the post-war situation. What this revealed was Black Star's
        firm confidence in this war. He believed more than anyone that the
        Galactic Society would be able to obtain the final victory… because the
        key to ending the war was in his hands.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        On the other side, when the Galactic Alliance Army was gathering, the
        Beyond Grade A Association also heard about the change in the situation
        from Han Xiao and was shocked.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Beautifully done, Black Star. You've captured the lifeblood of the
        World Tree!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In the conference room on the main planet of the association, this piece
        of good news made many Beyond Grade As excited.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        They had been rushing to reinforce everywhere for more than half a year,
        and they could only deal with the invaders passively. They had no room
        to fight back, and they were all holding their anger in.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Ever since the start of the war, only the World Tree had been able to
        invade, and now, they could finally counterattack. Most of the Beyond
        Grade As present were excited and eager to give it a try. They looked at
        Han Xiao with admiration and appreciation.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao knocked on the table and said, "I have already provided the
        coordinates of the World Tree's main body to the three Universal
        Civilizations. They are currently gathering a large force and preparing
        to achieve their goal in one go. Everyone has to contribute."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Don't worry, even if you don't say it, we will still give it our all.
        My cannon is already thirsty!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Sun Hunter waved his hand, his tiny body exuding a grand aura.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Manison said calmly, "We can finally end this war once and for all. It's
        earlier than I expected."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The majority of the people were overjoyed. Although they had the Sanctum
        to back them up and were not afraid of casualties, it was better to deal
        with painful things quickly. No one wanted to die several times in the
        long-term war.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao raised his hand and gestured for everyone to not be so excited.
        He slowly said, "In this war, our chances of winning are more than
        ninety percent. Defeating the World Tree Civilization is only one
        aspect. After the war, we have more things to deal with. To prevent the
        three Universal Civilizations from kicking us to the curb after we've
        outlived our usefulness, I need everyone's support."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Hearing this, everyone held back their excitement and waited.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "What do you plan to do?" Kasuyi asked for everyone. "I plan to use the
        aftermath of the war to change the organizational nature of the
        association, turn it into a civilization regime, and form a true Third
        Force. With our reputation and strength in the war, the three Universal
        Civilizations will have no choice but to accept it. I am letting you
        guys know first. When the time comes, and I give the signal, everyone
        will fully support me," Han Xiao explained.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Have we finally reached this step? Don't worry, we will definitely
        cooperate."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Everyone's spirits were lifted.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This was a crucial step in the transformation of the Beyond Grade A
        group. Everyone had expected this, and there were no objections. At this
        moment, Manison suddenly said, "We have to be careful of a problem. The
        three Universal Civilizations might have other thoughts under the
        premise that victory is within their grasp, and they might be interested
        in the power of the World Tree… We can help the three Universal
        Civilizations defeat their enemies, but we can't let them control or
        subdue the World Tree and turn it into a weapon to deal with us. This
        definitely won't do!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Hearing this, everyone nodded in agreement.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The World Tree had already proved how terrifying it was. Originally, the
        combination of the Beyond Grade A Association and the Super Star Cluster
        Alliance could rival the three Universal Civilizations. If the three
        Universal Civilizations controlled the World Tree, their strength would
        expand to a new level and threaten the survival of the Beyond Grade As
        once again. This was an outcome that no one wanted to see.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao's eyes flickered, and he smiled. "So, when we fight, be careful
        and pay attention to the three Universal Civilizations. Don't let them
        obstruct me."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">…</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The three Universal Civilizations had designated a gathering area in the
        Central Galaxy. As the armies of the various Star Fields continuously
        arrived, the size of the fleet waiting there had reached an astronomical
        number.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Federation of Light took out almost all the Multi-Dimensional Sky
        Opening Transportation Devices in their inventory and arranged them
        neatly.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Because the World Tree had retracted its troops to protect the mother
        tree, this battle could only be fought head-on. It was truly an all-out
        battle between both sides. The scale of the battle was the largest since
        the start of the war.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        All the warriors on the ships had solemn expressions, and the atmosphere
        was filled with the air of a decisive battle.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        On the players' forums, the related threads were already being flooded.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The players naturally would not miss such a huge scene. Everyone had
        gathered and accepted the same mission to be the vanguard of the main
        army and find out the distribution of the World Tree Civilization's
        troops in the main body's dimension.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Regarding this, the players did not have any objections. In fact, they
        were even willing to do so. After all, no one was more suitable for this
        mission than them, and there was still room for them to perform on such
        a grand occasion.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, most of the players were not mentally prepared for the sudden
        change in the war situation. They were all shocked. "Isn't this version
        called War of All Territories? I thought the World Tree's attack would
        last longer."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "We might have made a mistake. Our invasion of the other side is the
        true meaning of the version name."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Speaking of which, with such a large-scale war, I feel that our
        influence is very limited… Damn it, are we going to watch CG again ?".
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "I don't think so. I don't think this battle will end anytime soon. I'm
        afraid it will become a meat grinder battlefield. It will probably be
        very tragic."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "It's hard to say. It's not that the enemy isn't working hard, but our
        army has Black Star."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The players discussed endlessly on the forums. Although there were quite
        many complaints, they were still looking forward to the three Universal
        Civilizations' counterattack.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        On the other hand, the strategic command center was busy deducing the
        tactical arrangements of this battle and various possible scenarios.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Simon, Teny, and the other high-ranked officers were having a heated
        discussion, and Han Xiao and the others listened from the side.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Our first wave of Immortals will be the vanguard and bring back more
        data. Then, we will use the Multi-Dimensional Sky Opening Transportation
        Devices to bombard the enemy with firepower. With 200,000 Keys of
        Destruction in a batch, we will send out 20 batches first. Then, we will
        cycle it a few times and try to damage the enemy's strength."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "After this, we will send out the main fleet in batches. Due to the
        limitation of the transmission device's efficiency, we can only use the
        reinforced swarming tactic. It will take some time to ease the
        disadvantage of our troops, so this period will be the period with the
        highest casualties."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "The enemy will guard the World Tree's main body tightly. Our goal will
        be to break through the enemy's defense zone, open a path to the World
        Tree's main body, and destroy it. This requires the cooperation of
        high-level combatants."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At this point, all the senior officers turned to look at Han Xiao.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao knew what they meant, and he slowly said, "When the time comes,
        I will act as the arrowhead and lead the Beyond Grade As forward. You
        guys will be responsible for providing fire support." "At that time, all
        the direct Beyond Grade As will listen to your commands," Simon said
        with a solemn tone.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Beyond Grade As had strong individual combat strength and mobility, so
        they were the best choice to advance. According to the tactical
        deductions of the three Universal Civilizations, this battle would most
        likely be fought with high-level combatants. Thus, the importance of
        Black Star and the Beyond Grade As in this war was self-evident.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao was already mentally prepared. What he wanted was the military
        strength of the three Universal Civilizations, which could help him
        reach the World Tree's main body. Only then would he be able to carry
        out his real plan.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Although the three Universal Civilizations did not intend to engage in a
        blitzkrieg, with the speed of the World Tree's troops production, there
        would be a large number of new troops every day. The three Universal
        Civilizations could not help but speed up their gathering.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        A few days later, when the three Universal Civilizations saw that their
        forces were more or less gathered, they started the battle without
        hesitation.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In the vast universe, teams of fleets carrying the players drove into
        different Multi-Dimensional Sky Opening Transportation Devices and
        disappeared.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At the same time, in the secondary dimension world, the World Tree main
        body's dimension.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The area of this space was far larger than an ordinary dimension. A
        towering tree stood in the middle, its leaves lush and verdant. There
        were dense cracks in space around it, and countless roots extended out
        from the treethis giant tree was the World Tree's main body.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At this time, layers of protective shields covered the World Tree's main
        body, and the seemingly endless World Tree fleet had been waiting here
        for many days. They formed layers of tight defense and were installed
        with countless weapons.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Buzz</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        All of a sudden, the sky in the distance flashed with light, and the
        scout team formed by the players descended, appearing in the vision of
        the World Tree fleet.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"It's here…"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        On a branch at the top of the World Tree, the Ancestral Tree King opened
        his eyes and looked in the direction of the enemy.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-1435">

      </h1>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The light of the Multi-Dimensional Sky Opening Transportation Devices
        faded, and the scenery outside the porthole of the players' battleships
        turned into an incomparably vast green world. The huge World Tree's main
        body stood in the distance, and the endless World Tree fleet surrounded
        it like a green sea of light.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The distribution of the World Tree troops appeared in their eyes. It
        seemed to cover every inch of space, and it was extremely packed. It was
        enough to trigger trypophobia in ordinary people and make one's scalp
        tingle.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Countless spaceships adjusted their cannons at the same time and aimed
        in the direction of the players, ready to fire at any moment and smash
        them into pieces.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        It was as if they could smell the strong scent of death. However, the
        players were not afraid at all. Instead, their blood was boiling, and
        they were trembling with passion.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Hahahaha-Little saplings, to think that you would also have this day!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Brothers, charge!" "For the tribe!"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">"The sacred forum is connected to us!"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Watatata, die!"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The tens of millions of players shouted excitedly and dispersed!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Batch after batch of battleships split up without hesitation and charged
        in all directions. "Fire!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As the Ancestral Tree King gave the order, countless cannons were fired,
        forming a tsunami of light cannons without any gaps. When the wave swept
        past, a large number of players, including the shields and hulls of the
        ships, were instantly crushed into powder!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In just one exchange, the players' fleet suffered huge casualties!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, a portion of the Multi-Dimensional Sky Opening Transportation
        Devices operated in different groups, forming a teleportation channel
        that could be activated at all times. New troops would be teleported out
        every moment, and the rest of the Multi-Dimensional Sky Opening
        Transportation Devices operated together. They were specifically
        responsible for large-scale deployment, and the combination of the two
        teleportation methods ensured that there would not be a vacuum at the
        frontline.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        A large number of players died, and new players continued to enter the
        battlefield, bringing back detailed information about the main body's
        dimension of the World Tree… Because the communication was restricted,
        it was difficult for normal scouting troops to send messages to the
        headquarters, and the players who could revive were the most
        unrestricted intelligence agents.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The World Tree Army's firepower was endless, and the enemy ships
        exploded into fireworks. However, at this moment, the players suddenly
        stopped teleporting, and in their place were densely packed Keys of
        Destruction.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Shield!"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The roars of the various commanders could be heard from the World Tree's
        mental network. The outermost layer of defense immediately activated its
        response measures. Space expanded, lengthening the distance and turning
        into a deep region to cushion the bombardment. It was the Lerbo Space
        Protection Belt.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The next moment, batch after batch of Keys of Destruction emitted a
        blinding light, as though hundreds of thousands of suns were rising.
        Violent energy poured out like a floodgate!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Boom!</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The high-density energy explosion caused the space to distort, and the
        source of the explosion seemed to have become a singularity. The
        surrounding space collapsed, showing the folds of the vortex-like space.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Immediately after, a world-rending light burst forth and spread out
        rapidly. It only slowed down after entering the Lerbo Space Protection
        Belt, like a wave on a beach. Its momentum gradually slowed down, and
        finally, it touched the outer layer of the defense circle's
        anti-explosion shield. It exploded with powerful electric arcs, leaving
        large cracks on the shield.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Keys of Destruction's cleansing was repeated many times, but most of
        its power was reduced by the space protection belt. The remaining power
        shattered layers of protective shields, causing considerable damage to
        the World Tree fleet in the outermost layer of defense. However, the
        maintenance fleet was constantly repairing the shields, causing the Keys
        of Destruction's bombardment to stop at the outer layer.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        If it was an ordinary secondary dimension, it would have exploded from
        the inside under such an energy explosion. However, the toughness of the
        World Tree main body's dimension far exceeded common sense, and its
        spatial strength was stronger than even the main universe. Furthermore,
        it was reinforced by the World Tree fleet with a large number of
        spacetime stabilization devices, making it extremely sturdy.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The players explored the battlefield and used the Keys of Destruction
        multiple times to wipe out the World Tree battleships. The rear
        battleships kept moving forward to replace the World Tree battleships,
        maintaining the protective shield. One side was acting like a bomb,
        while the other side was defending.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After another batch of Keys of Destruction exploded, the official troops
        of the Galactic Alliance Army finally arrived in groups.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Due to the limitations in the teleportation, the mission of the vanguard
        troops was to withstand the attacks of the World Tree and buy time for
        the follow-up troops, allowing the Multi-Dimensional Sky Opening
        Transportation Devices to continuously send troops over. Only when there
        were enough troops present would the first phase of the mission be
        considered a success. Only then would they be able to enter the next
        phase of the large-scale head-on battle.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Galactic Alliance Army at the scene immediately took action. The
        division of labor was clear&mdash;the construction team constructed a
        base, built magic gates that connected straight to the main universe to
        add new channels for deploying troops. The guards surrounded the area,
        preparing to defend against the attacks of the World Tree, while the
        harassment mission was temporarily handed over to the Spacetime Splicing
        Technology suicide squad.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Lerbo Space Protection Belt extended the distance between the two
        parties, causing the Galactic Alliance Army to have to travel for a long
        time to reach the outermost defense circle of the World Tree.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        On the other hand, if the World Tree wanted to attack the Galactic
        Alliance Army, it did not need to travel in the Lerbo Space Protection
        Belt and could teleport directly. This was because this was the main
        dimension of the World Tree, and it had the ability of the ‘World Tree
        Express'. All the members of the World Tree had the ability to teleport
        quickly and could appear anywhere.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The World Tree Civilization had the home-ground advantage here.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The next moment, green lights flashed, and batches of World Tree fleet
        appeared, directly crossing the Lerbo Space Protection Belt.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Looking at the densely packed armies of the three Universal
        Civilizations outside the window, countless World Tree warriors revealed
        fearless expressions.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Although their thoughts were controlled by the World Tree, the members
        of the World Tree still had their own consciousness and treated the
        World Tree as a totem. Now, they only had one thought, and that was to
        repel the three Universal Civilizations at all costs. "For the mother
        tree! Kill all the enemies!" The World Tree soldiers let out a shrill
        battle cry and controlled the battleships to attack.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Stop them!" The officers of the Galactic Alliance Army also roared and
        gave orders.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        One side carried the flames of revenge for their compatriots, while the
        other side carried the determination to fight to the death. The strong
        collective consciousness clashed and tangled into a Psychic Current that
        wreaked havoc throughout the entire battlefield. Countless people could
        vaguely see two huge beasts biting each other.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Immediately after, the two armies clashed. In an instant, it was as if
        the sky was collapsing!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As soon as they started fighting, the situation became one-sided. Due to
        the large difference in strength, the World Tree fleet quickly gained
        the upper hand and broke through the Galactic Alliance Army's formation
        on a large scale.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The vanguard of the Galactic Alliance Army struggled to hold on. The
        pressure did not only come from the large number of enemy troops
        stationed in the main dimension but also from the harassment of the
        World Tree itself.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Every time the Galactic Alliance Army's forces were teleported to the
        battlefield, space cracks would appear all around them, and dense tree
        roots of the World Tree would extend out and smash the starships.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In the main body dimension, the Mother Tree's consciousness could
        control the World Tree Roots to block the enemy. Its destructive power
        might not be strong, but it was definitely a powerful method to disrupt
        the battle.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The World Tree and the Universal Civilization Army's special
        technological troops did not rest either. They used genetic bombs,
        dimensional weapons, and viruses at times. All kinds of technologies
        were being used.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Batch after batch of fleets was sacrificed, and more troops were
        teleported over. The number of troops increased and decreased like
        roller coasters, but the overall trend was still on the rise. The speed
        of the battle casualties was not as fast as the speed of the
        reinforcements sent by the Multi-Dimensional Sky Opening Transportation
        Devices.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The two armies clashed with each other, and the battlefield was
        extremely chaotic. The number of casualties increased at a terrifying
        speed.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Attack, attack! We can't let the enemy defile the mother tree!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Frenzied fighting spirit spread through the mental network, infecting
        all the World Tree members.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, no matter how agitated they were, they could not determine the
        direction of the battle. The two sides had been fighting for a long
        time, and the Galactic Alliance Army had already passed the most
        dangerous early stage. At this time, the number of troops present had
        already reached a large scale, and they gradually broke free from the
        disadvantage and began to fight against the World Tree fleet.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In the chaotic battlefield, one of the World Tree's battleships nimbly
        shuttled between the curtains of bullets, dodging attacks from all
        angles. It continuously shot out beams of light energy bullets,
        shattering the enemy battleships like a whip. The pilot clenched his
        teeth, his eyes bloodshot.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        When he neared a Galactic Alliance Army combat squad, the firepower
        covered his ship. The pilot immediately activated teleportation, and the
        entire spaceship disappeared from the spot, dodging a round of
        firepower.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The next moment, his spaceship appeared in the middle of this squad. The
        pilot did not hesitate to remove the limiter on the reactor, turning the
        entire spaceship into a large bomb, wanting to self-destruct and
        eliminate this enemy team. However, at this moment, an invisible force
        field suddenly pressed down, directly crushing his spaceship into dust,
        turning his roar into nothingness.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Hundreds of Beyond Grade As appeared in the growing army formation of
        the Galactic Alliance Army. Heavenly judgment descended, instantly
        destroying a large portion of the World Tree troops that were attacking.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        A gigantic Mechanical Deity was also exposed in the vision of both
        parties. It was Han Xiao's Supreme Heavenly Venerate, and its
        Transcendent Grade energy fluctuations instantly attracted the attention
        of all the soldiers and officers on both sides.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The members of the World Tree were already traumatized by Han Xiao.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The soldiers of the Galactic Alliance Army were the exact opposite. They
        were overjoyed.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Attention, the Beyond Grade A Association is on the move! We are
        officially launching a counterattack!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The entrance of the high-level combatants was a signal. It meant that
        their strategy had entered the second stage; from defense to offense.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Galactic Alliance Army had accumulated enough troops and no longer
        focused on defense. They finally launched a ferocious counterattack and
        advanced toward the World Tree's main body from all directions.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "The Lerbo Space Protection Belt will be able to stop them for a very
        long time. The enemy won't be able to break into our official defense
        circle in a short period of time. We can use the strategic depth to deal
        more damage to them…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Seeing this, many World Tree members had the same thought, but the next
        moment, their expressions changed.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao's Supreme Heavenly Venerate raised his arm and shook it in the
        direction of the World Tree fleet's defense circle. A strange spatial
        fluctuation was released, covering the Lerbo Space Protection Belt in an
        instant. The next moment, the Lerbo Space Protection Belt quickly lost
        its effect, and the extended space shrank back to normal.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, this was not the only change. Originally, even if the Lerbo
        Space Protection Belt lost its effectiveness, there was still some
        distance between the two armies. However, the sudden reversal shortened
        the distance. In the blink of an eye, the main force of the Galactic
        Alliance Army was right in front of the defense circle. There was no
        need to waste time on the road.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Universal Treasure technologies provided by the Saint Tyracles Race,
        the ‘Space Constants Modifier', had already been improved by Han Xiao.
        The moment it was used, it showed a brilliant effect, and the function
        of the Lerbo Spatial Protection Belt was directly neutralized.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The shortening of space was extremely helpful to the galactic alliance
        army. The World Tree Civilization's expression changed.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Charge!"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After doing this, Han Xiao spun the Emperor Skysplitter Blade, and the
        gigantic Supreme Heavenly Venerate advanced forward, tearing apart the
        World Tree fleet's formation. Psionic waves shot out freely, paralyzing
        the enemy ships.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Beyond Grade As followed closely behind with grim expressions. They
        seemed to have formed a sharp blade and stabbed into the World Tree's
        defense circle.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Everywhere they passed, the World Tree battleships exploded!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Such an arrogant advance was immediately met with the large-scale focus
        fire of the World Tree fleet, but the Galactic Alliance Army was
        providing cover.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Just as Han Xiao was about to penetrate the outermost layer of defense,
        another Transcendent Grade aura suddenly descended, sweeping across the
        entire battlefield like a hurricane.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Ancestral Tree King had already sacrificed himself, burning the
        remaining stock of the Beyonder's Vestige and activating the descent of
        the Tree God.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        If there was no Transcendent like Black Star among the enemies, the
        Ancestral Tree King would still have a chance. He could use the
        Information Form revival mechanism of the Tree God to let the World Tree
        look like they were defeated on the surface, but in reality, they could
        resurrect elsewhere and return to the dark to recuperate. However, in
        the face of a Transcendent's Information Form Obliteration, this path
        was no longer possible. Furthermore, as long as the Pivotal Snake did
        not die, the World Tree would have nowhere to hide. The Ancestral Tree
        King had no way out.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At this moment, the Tree God, who was only driven by his instincts, led
        the remaining high-level combatants of the World Tree to face Han Xiao
        and the others head-on. All of them were filled with tragic battle
        intent. "Even if I die, I won't let you pass!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Kill!"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        They were enemies, there was no need for any unnecessary words.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Bang!</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Without hesitation, Han Xiao charged into the Tree God's arms and
        stabbed his blade into the Tree God's chest.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Two enormous Transcendents tangled together and rolled in the battle
        formation, crushing the starships in the sky.
      </p>

      </h1>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Emperor Skysplitter Blade revolved in the hands of the Supreme
        Heavenly Venerate like a light wheel, shooting out countless blue
        high-density psionic energy blades, shattering all the starships and
        mechas in its path. It left a blank space in the dense defensive
        formation, akin to a searing streak of light that never dissipated.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! The blades of light landed on the Tree God's
        body one after another. The roots of the tree were cleanly cut in half,
        but sprouts quickly grew from the broken parts, repairing and closing
        the wounds.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As the Mechanical Force surged, the mechanical army was like a black and
        gold thundercloud, colliding with the green energy tsunami created by
        the Tree God, causing explosions around the two giants.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Buzz</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The two of them released their domains at the same time. The
        grayish-blue Void Domain and the green Tree God Domain collided and
        pressed toward each other. They rubbed against each other like tofu,
        creating dazzling electric arcs.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        During this process, Han Xiao and the Tree God's bodies expanded
        endlessly. They rolled and fought together, colliding more than a
        thousand times in an instant. The shockwave sent all the spaceships
        flying.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This was not the first time the two of them had fought. The Tree God was
        still in an irrational state, but Han Xiao could clearly feel that the
        power of the Tree God had increased a lot. It was not as easy to deal
        with as the last time, especially since the strength of the Tree God
        Domain had increased tremendously.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The closer he got to the main body of the mother tree, the stronger the
        power of the Tree God became. This was especially so when he was in the
        main body dimension of the World Tree. The ability of the Tree God was
        enhanced, and it also had the ability to teleport without any cooldowns.
        It was extremely agile, and the most disgusting thing was that its
        regeneration speed was also shocking. Even Han Xiao felt that it was
        troublesome.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Under the enhancement of various factors, the Tree God actually managed
        to restrain Han Xiao's advancement for a while, even forcing Han Xiao to
        retreat far away from the mother tree.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Looks like it won't be that easy to deal with this fellow…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao had already expected this. He had suspected that the Tree God
        would be buffed in the main body dimension, so he was not surprised.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        His advance was blocked, but he was in no hurry at all. He focused on
        fighting the Tree God, waiting for his various talents to take effect,
        which would continue to increase his combat strength. The last time he
        extracted the ability of the Tree God, he had obtained some obscure
        information. He guessed that the enemy had to pay a huge price to summon
        the Tree God, and it was not a long-term method.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Therefore, Han Xiao was not in a hurry to achieve anything. In his eyes,
        as long as he dragged this out, the Tree God would eventually weaken.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        If not for the fact that he had attacked the World Tree's old home, he
        reckoned that the Ancestral Tree King would not have been willing to
        stop him.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        While the two Transcendent Grade Supers were fighting, the Beyond Grade
        As on both sides were also engaged in battles. All the Beyond Grade A
        Mechanics temporarily put aside their pin the strategic command center
        Allersonal grudges, and the mechanical army formed a formation, pouring
        out fierce firepower. The Mages summoned their respective Mage Pagodas
        and connected to each other, building large-scale magic circuits. They
        were like mobile formations, continuously releasing all kinds of
        large-scale attacks.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Mechanical Deities wreaked havoc on the battlefield one after another.
        Manison's silver mechanical body waved its trident and swept across a
        large area. His Indestructible Mechanical Troops stood beside him in an
        awe-inspiring manner. Herberlon finally had the chance to take revenge,
        starting a massacre. He let out a soundless roar even as he tore apart
        the roots of the World Tree.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        On the other side, EsGod and his dozens of doppelgangers were traversing
        the battlefield. Their various Esper Abilities toyed with many World
        Tree experts. Not far away, Evans activated his [Energy Control] Esper
        Ability with all his might, gathering all kinds of energy from the
        battlefield and smashing it toward the World Tree fleet.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Hila's expression was solemn as she controlled the red tide of death,
        raising waves one after another and swallowing the enemy ships. Aurora,
        on the other hand, had a solemn expression and was emitting vitality.
        She continuously treated her injured teammates and summoned a large
        number of spirits to enter the battlefield from time to time.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kasuyi was burning with an unlimited amount of mana, and his psychic
        energy was surging nonstop, shattering the thoughts of countless World
        Tree Blessings. In another area, Feidin held the Soul Swapper in his
        hands and strolled around the battlefield. The surrounding battlefield
        became a forbidden zone for life, and all the souls of the enemies were
        crushed.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Pugilists no longer fought alone. Instead, they formed a battle
        formation. Sierron, Mercer, Heber, Viru, Jotina, Kohler, and the others
        launched a collective Iron Head Charge, turning the defenses of the
        World Tree fleet upside down. Their fists punched continuously, their
        voices of ‘OraOra!' echoing in the dimension.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Karlot was among them. He drove Silver Shadow and crashed into enemy
        ships one after another.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        ‘Quantum Demon Spirit' Judith, ‘Defender' Romo, ‘Mechanical Queen'
        Mornisa, and the others set off wave after wave of data attacks in the
        Virtual Network. ‘Army Flag' Enid activated his ability, enveloped all
        of his allies in a buff halo, and together with Aurora, they increased
        the overall strength of the Beyond Grade As.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As they had not hesitated to invade the galactic society some time ago,
        many of the high-level combatants of the World Tree Civilization had
        died, and they had yet to revive. They did not expect to be
        counterattacked by the three Universal Civilizations so quickly, and
        this weakness had become a huge pit, causing the current high-level
        combatants to be far inferior to the three Universal Civilizations.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Thus, not long after the battle had started, the Beyond Grade As of the
        three Universal Civilizations displayed their abilities and beat the
        World Tree experts until they bled.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        One after another, the Holy Tree Emissaries and ancestral spirits stared
        with bloodshot eyes. They were filled with unwillingness as they died in
        battle.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The high-level combatants were the sharpest blades, and they charged the
        deepest. In other directions, the armies of the three Universal
        Civilizations were also attacking the World Tree's defense circle. The
        battlefronts were in a deadlock, shifting back and forth.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "The current situation is advantageous to us. The longer the battle
        lasts, the more troops we can send out, and the pressure on the World
        Tree will continue to increase. It's impossible for them to maintain the
        frontline!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In the strategic command center, all the upper echelons gathered
        together and looked at the real-time battle situation on the virtual
        strategy sand table. The atmosphere was tense.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Simon placed his hands on the table and said with a deep voice, "I've
        roughly divided the defense circle of the World Tree into five layers.
        Our main force is fighting on the outermost layer, and the Beyond Grade
        As have broken into the second layer. Black Star was about to break into
        the third layer, but he was forced back to the second."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "The World Tree Civilization is also going all out. It seems like we
        won't be able to penetrate the enemy's defenses in the short term," an
        officer commented.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Simon nodded in agreement. His tone was solemn as he continued: "If we
        exhaust the World Tree's forces at the outermost perimeter, the troops
        inside will come out to reinforce our defenses. Furthermore, because the
        World Tree fleet can teleport indefinitely in this space, we will not be
        able to break out of the encirclement in a normal sense. We will either
        have to face the enemy head-on or defeat the enemy's army… Therefore,
        before both sides' forces are exhausted to a certain extent, our main
        force will not be able to open the situation."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Everyone had a serious expression and understood what he meant.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This was a bloody battle, and the casualties would be astronomical.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "As the attacker, we have the upper hand in the short term, but in the
        longer term, our future in a protracted war is not good."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Simon paused.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "The speed of our reinforcements is far slower than the World Tree. The
        World Tree is sending out troops every second from the roots, allowing
        them to immediately return to the battlefield… Although we can use the
        tactic of adding weight to increase the pressure on the World Tree, if
        the stalemate continues for a long time, the situation will probably
        turn around when all our troops are deployed."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Everyone was shocked. This situation was not impossible. If the World
        Tree Civilization erupted with astonishing tenacity and withstood their
        continuous attacks, their attacks would decline at some point in time.
        No matter how many advantages they had accumulated before, they would be
        taken back.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This time, Simon changed the topic. Pointing at Black Star in the
        strategic sand table, he said with a deep voice, "We can't count on the
        victory of the main force for now. The ones that are most likely to
        break the stalemate are the Beyond Grade As. With Black Star leading the
        way, as long as they can get rid of the obstruction of the enemy's
        high-level combatants, they will be able to advance quickly. They are
        the breakthrough point of this battle, and they might be able to
        influence the outcome."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        All the officers and the leaders of the three Universal Civilizations
        nodded.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Although it seemed like Black Star would not be able to get rid of the
        Tree God anytime soon, after experiencing so much, everyone had strong
        confidence in him and had high hopes.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        One black and one green Transcendent clashed countless times. As his
        various talents were activated, Han Xiao's attributes increased bit by
        bit. The more he fought, the stronger he became, and he gradually
        suppressed Tree God.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Because the Tree God had an extremely high absorption rate toward energy
        attacks, Han Xiao could only use physical attacks against him. The black
        torrent formed by mechanical particles transformed into all kinds of
        forms, leaving wounds on the Tree God's body.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Very soon, Han Xiao started to push forward again with unstoppable
        momentum. The Tree God hurriedly released a series of World Tree Roots
        to wrap around the Supreme Heavenly Venerate, trying to stall him.
        However, these roots were all easily torn apart by Han Xiao and crushed
        into dust.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Without the incomplete state of rationality, it can only rely on its
        instincts to fight, and cannot release its full strength. It's a pity."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao spun his blade and chopped off the head of the Tree God. Seeing
        the head of the Tree God regenerate rapidly, he shook his head.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, right at this moment, the Tree God suddenly jolted, and the
        chaotic emotions of the beast subsided. For the first time, a clear
        mental thought came to him. It was the consciousness of the Ancestral
        Tree King.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Black Star! Don't even think about getting</p>
      <p class="calibre3">past me!"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Eh, you regained consciousness?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao raised his brows. He was curious about what method the
        Ancestral Tree King had used to regain his rationality and take over the
        control of the Tree God.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Just as the Ancestral Tree King took over the body of the Tree God, its
        fighting style immediately changed. The fighting style was no longer
        rough and a lot of details were added.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Although his strength did not increase, the actual combat strength that
        the Tree God displayed had increased significantly. It was like a
        completely different person.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At this moment, in the inner space of the Tree God, the illusory figure
        of the Ancestral Tree King was floating. His senses were connected to
        the Tree God's vision, and he looked at Han Xiao with a determined
        expression.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Until just now, the Ancestral Tree King was trapped in the consciousness
        of the Tree God and was in a state of chaos. However, the World Tree
        finally realized that it was facing a great calamity. The will of the
        Mother Tree descended, allowing the Ancestral Tree King to wake up
        alone. It also took back the crown positions of the Fortitude Tree King
        and the Subduing Tree King, handing them all to the Ancestral Tree King.
        Its meaning was very clear. It was to let the Ancestral Tree King fight
        alone.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This was something the World Tree had learned from the process of those
        previous tree kings who had attempted to break through to the
        Transcendent Grade. Burning the information state foundation of the
        Ancestral Tree King allowed him to enter a state similar to the
        advancement of the Transcendent Grade, but he was still controlled by
        the World Tree. This way, the consciousness of the Ancestral Tree King
        would be connected to the senses of the Tree God and could control the
        Tree God alone.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The price was to temporarily deprive the Ancestral Tree King of the
        chance to revive. If he could survive, he would be able to return to the
        mother tree's embrace after exiting the tree god state. However, if he
        died in this state, the Ancestral Tree King would then end up like those
        tree kings who failed to advance to the Transcendent Grade, unable to
        revive. This was the disadvantage.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, this was the will of the Mother Tree, and the Ancestral Tree
        King had no right to choose.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao said with a calm tone, "With your control, the Tree God is
        indeed much stronger, but if you think that this small change can stop
        me, you're overthinking it. Furthermore, how long can this state of
        yours last?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Do you think you've won?!"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Ancestral Tree King's expression was stern. Without saying a word,
        he activated [Tree King Crown &ndash; Liberation).
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In the void, the Subduing Tree King Crown that represented the Pugilist
        class shattered!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The experience and skills accumulated by every generation of the Martial
        Tree King were all integrated into the Tree God. At the same time, the
        origin power of the crown seemed to have become a catalyst, instantly
        increasing the combat power of the Tree God!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        A seemingly endless amount of energy suddenly surged out from deep
        within his body and spread throughout his entire body in the blink of an
        eye.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Ahhh,"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">The intense pain invaded the mind of the</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        low growl. However, his mental strength did not weaken. Instead, it was
        stimulated and quickly strengthened. The next moment, green muscles
        suddenly grew out of the Tree God's body. The originally dry tree body
        suddenly became burly and round.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This feeling was as though the original Tree God was just a skeleton.
        Only now did the flesh and blood appear on the skeleton.The Tree God
        Domain that was originally at a disadvantage suddenly expanded, pushing
        Han Xiao's Void Domain away.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        [Tree King Crown &ndash; Liberation) could strengthen the combat power
        of the Tree God, and the corresponding Tree King Crown had to be
        sacrificed. Losing the right to be the Tree King for a long period of
        time would require thousands of years to recover, and the price was
        huge!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, to reduce the losses, the Ancestral Tree King sacrificed the
        title of the Pugilist without hesitation!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Ancestral Tree King's emotions were affected as if a pile of dry wood
        had been touched by a spark, and his battle intent soared.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "My strength is far from my limit! Black Star! Only when you die will we
        be at peace!"

      <p class="calibre3">
        The Pugilist flames burned, and the Tree God's movements became even
        faster. His strength increased tremendously, and he suddenly grabbed the
        Emperor Skysplitter Blade coming at him. He stopped the momentum of the
        blade in midair.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At the same time, roots shot out from the surface of the Tree God's
        body. The ends of the roots curled up like a knot, forming thousands of
        fists that rained down on the body of the Supreme Heavenly Venerate.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Green fist shadows filled the sky, piercing through the combined shield
        of the mechanical army and bombarding the body of the Supreme Heavenly
        Venerate. Cracks appeared on the surface of its body.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Energy shot out from the back of the Supreme Heavenly Venerate one after
        another, forming a green shockwave that did not weaken in the slightest
        even after passing through it, destroying patches of battleships as
        collateral damage.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "His close combat ability has increased tremendously. This should be a
        sacrifice for the Tree King Crown, right?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao endured the impact and analyzed calmly. He had seen the (Tree
        Crown-Liberation] skill when he was extracting the Tree God's ability.
        The Tree God did not use this skill the last time they fought. This
        time, he recognized it at a glance.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Seeing the actual effect, Han Xiao felt a sense of familiarity. He felt
        that this move was a bit like a Character Summon Card, used to obtain
        the Super system power stored in the different Tree King Crowns. "The
        World Tree has a total of five… Oh, no, it's now four Tree King Crowns,
        which means that the Tree God can spawn at least four more times. Its
        strength will continue to stack, and its final battle strength will
        probably be very astonishing. Furthermore, this doesn't even take into
        consideration if the Tree God has other explosive abilities."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Han Xiao quickly calculated.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The moment the Tree God used his one-time explosive ability, the best
        way to counter it would be to avoid it, but the situation did not allow
        it. The Multi-Dimensional Sky Opening Transportation Device was one-way,
        and if he wanted to send a large group back, he would have to set up a
        new group of teleportation devices here. Now that the majority were
        already locked in battle with the World Tree, they naturally would not
        retreat halfway, or many warriors would have died for nothing.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Furthermore, Han Xiao also wanted to fight the Tree God head-on. After
        all, with his current strength, it was difficult to find an opponent.
        Now that he had finally met one, how could he not show the other party
        some love?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Looks like I have to show you my true skills. Let me see how many
        tricks you have."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Han Xiao's eyes sparkled.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He had long known that the Tree God had an explosive ability, but the
        Ancestral Tree King thought that he did not know and wanted to give him
        an unexpected attack. However, he had long been prepared for it.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        On the other side, the Ancestral Tree King held onto the Emperor
        Skysplitter Blade tightly, not allowing Han Xiao's weapon to escape his
        control. Endless energy flowed out from his body, and he was able to
        gain the upper hand against the Supreme Heavenly Venerate, pushing Han
        Xiao back.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Taking advantage of the fact that Han Xiao could not move, the Ancestral
        Tree King controlled a large number of roots and attacked the chest of
        the Supreme Heavenly Venerate.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The mechanical army also reacted and began to block the attacks of the
        Tree God. At the same time, the mechanical particles flowing around the
        body of the Supreme Heavenly Venerate also transformed into streams,
        intercepting the roots halfway.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Bang! Bang! Bang! Looking from afar, countless blurry afterimages of
        light appeared around the two super gods and collided with each other.
        Metal and tree roots clashed at a high frequency, and continuous
        shockwaves exploded in midair.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Your strength is already below mine!"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Ancestral Tree King had a vicious expression on his face. He twisted
        the Emperor Skysplitter Blade as he channeled his energy into his arm.
        He was about to launch a follow-up attack.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, at this moment, an irresistible force suddenly came from the
        blade and suppressed his strength!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Boom!</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The next moment, the Emperor Skysplitter Blade, which was originally
        frozen in midair, suddenly broke through the Tree God's stance and
        slashed down. In an instant, it slashed across the Tree God's shoulder
        all the way to his waist, leaving a huge wound. The Tree God was almost
        cut into two.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"What?!"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Ancestral Tree King was horrified. Instead of retreating, he rushed
        forward and hugged Han Xiao. He wanted to use the power of the crown to
        restrict Han Xiao's movement and stop his follow-up attack.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, the result was far from what he had imagined. The Tree God was
        crushed under the body of the Supreme Heavenly Venerate and almost
        dismembered as though he was suffering from the capital punishment of
        ‘Death by a Thousand Cuts'. The power brought by the sacrifice of the
        Pugilist Tree King Crown was still suppressed by Han Xiao! The Ancestral
        Tree King was horrified. He had barely escaped by igniting the Pugilist
        flames, but the body of the Tree God was already in tatters. Countless
        pieces of its newly born flesh had been cut off, and it was currently in
        the process of recovery.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao casually cut off the World Tree Root that he was following
        before looking at the Tree God with dissatisfaction.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"You're so arrogant at only this standard?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">"You…"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Feeling Han Xiao's energy level rising, the Ancestral Tree King's
        expression darkened.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He had thought that he would be able to gain the upper hand after
        liberating the Tree King Crown, but reality had given him a huge slap.
        He did not expect that he would still not be Han Xiao's match after
        using his burst ability, and the other party was also increasing their
        combat capability. The Ancestral Tree King clenched his teeth before
        making a decision.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Don't celebrate too early. I haven't reached my limit!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The moment he said that the crown of the Secret Tree King shattered!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        A new source of energy was released. It was like adding fuel to the core
        furnace of the Tree God. Its energy level broke through its limits once
        again! Countless magical knowledge flowed into his brain. At the same
        time, many complicated magic circuits appeared on the surface of the
        Tree God's body, forming various enchantment runes.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In an instant, the power of the mages was also applied to the Tree God!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Tree God Domain expanded once again, almost flattening the Void
        Domain! "Ahhh,"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        An even stronger burden descended, and the mental strength of the
        Ancestral Tree King soared. However, at the same time, it brought him
        even more intense pain. His soul wailed uncontrollably, and his emotions
        became even more intense.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He endured the pain, mobilized his new strength, and launched an even
        stronger attack at Han Xiao.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Boom!</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The surging magic power formed a densely packed Forbidden Technique that
        almost drained all the free energy particles in the nearby battlefield.
        It turned into bright rainbow light and submerged Han Xiao's entire
        body. It was extremely deadly.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As the Tree God maintained the bombardment of magic, he charged into the
        light of the explosion and chased after the body of the Supreme Heavenly
        Venerate. The fists and roots that contained the shocking Pugilist
        flames landed on Han Xiao's body continuously, creating loud explosions!
        The Ancestral Tree King stared with bloodshot eyes, tirelessly attacking
        again and again!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Black Star! I will never let you destroy my civilization!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The mental shockwave of the roar swept across the battlefield, instantly
        stirring the emotions of countless people!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, right at this moment, an extremely dense aura of blood suddenly
        erupted in front of him.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Buzz!</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Before the Ancestral Tree King could react, a cold light suddenly lit
        up. He felt a huge force coming from his chest. The Emperor Skysplitter
        Blade flew over and stabbed into his chest.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The next second, the Ancestral Tree King realized that his arm was
        firmly locked in place. Not only that, but all the roots that he was
        using to attack had also stopped moving.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The light of the magic explosion dissipated, revealing the appearance of
        the Supreme Celestial Venerable. Han Xiao's entire body was covered in
        blood energy, and he grabbed the arm of the Tree God. The mechanical
        particles formed countless tentacles that extended out from his back,
        accurately wrapping around the roots of every World Tree. They were
        joined in midair like bridges.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The power of the Supreme Heavenly Venerate increased rapidly, and it
        soon exceeded the second stage liberated Tree God, making it impossible
        for the Ancestral Tree King to escape.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"You…"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">The Ancestral Tree King's eyes widened.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, before he could do anything, Han Xiao suddenly smashed his head
        against him.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The next moment, the Supreme Heavenly Venerate grabbed the Tree God's
        arm and pressed him down. At the same time, he bent his knee and raised
        his leg, smashing the Tree God's head with a powerful knee strike,
        producing a green shockwave. Han Xiao extended his hand and stabbed into
        the hole on the Tree God's head, all the way to his chest. He grabbed a
        bunch of messy roots and pulled them out, tearing out a large number of
        broken roots.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        If it had been a normal life form, its spine and organs would have been
        pulled out. Even the Tree God, who had a special body structure, would
        not have felt good.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At this time, Han Xiao pulled out the Emperor Skysplitter Blade from the
        Tree God's chest. He then used Virtual Creation to create countless huge
        cannons around the tree god.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Hong Long LongAfter a round of firing, countless physical bullets of
        planetary-sized mass blasted the Tree God into smithereens.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The terrifying kinetic energy pushed the Tree God and sent him flying,
        creating a blank space on the battlefield. Han Xiao followed closely
        behind and entered the middle of the third layer of defense.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Only then did the Ancestral Tree King manage to stop his uncontrolled
        retreat and teleport to avoid Han Xiao's pursuit. He jumped a distance
        away and quickly summoned more World Tree Roots to heal his injuries.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Seeing this, Han Xiao swung his blade and said casually, "That's it?
        Anything else?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In terms of the quantity and quality of the attribute enhancement
        abilities, there were very few people who could beat him. The Tree God
        had buffed itself twice in a row, and his combat strength had increased
        by quite a lot, but it was still insufficient in front of him.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Although he had just stepped into the Transcendent Grade not too long
        ago, as long as he activated all the bonuses, his combat strength would
        increase to an astonishing level. Han Xiao was not sure what level he
        would be at after he unleashed his full strength.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Hearing this, the Ancestral Tree King became even more agitated. Anger,
        shock, and unwillingness filled his mind.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Even after sacrificing two Tree King Crowns and paying such a huge
        price, his combat capability was still no match for Black Star?!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Ancestral Tree King was already caught between a rock and a hard
        place. To him, a stalemate was meaningless. If he could not kill Black
        Star, Black Star would be able to make a comeback countless times. There
        was only one path left, and that was to kill Black Star at all costs.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Various thoughts flashed through his mind. The Ancestral Tree King
        looked at the main body of the mother tree with determination.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Seeing that the Ancestral Tree King did not reply, Han Xiao was about to
        continue attacking, but at this moment, the World Tree fleet charged
        toward him as though they were insane.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Protect the mother tree!"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Go, give the Tree God some time to breathe!"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Fight for our homeland!"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Countless World Tree warriors rushed over to engage in a fierce battle.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Seeing this, Han Xiao casually attacked, only to see the new troops
        constantly approaching to replenish those wiped out. Many World Tree
        soldiers were willing to die, using their lives to form a line of
        defense to stop him from chasing after the Tree God, just to give the
        heavily damaged Tree God more time to recover. However, in the face of
        the absolute difference in strength, the determination to face death was
        meaningless. No matter how many fleets there were, they would all be
        destroyed by the psionic waves.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Countless members of the World Tree Blessed Race swarmed over like moths
        to a flame, leaving behind a bunch of paralyzed battleship wreckages.
        There was only dead silence in the ship, as the crew had all died under
        the psionic waves.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao was hardly obstructed at all. He stepped on the debris of the
        countless World Tree battleships and pointed at the heavily injured Tree
        God. The gigantic figure of the Supreme Heavenly Venerate gave off an
        aura of despair to his enemies.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Seeing this tragic scene, many players who were fighting were moved.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "They should be evenly matched, but why do I feel like it's an adult
        bullying a child…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Look at Black Star's style, I'm a little confused. Which one is the
        real villain boss?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Come on, big brother who plays with tree roots!"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Amidst the cheers of the players, Han Xiao slammed into the Tree God,
        who had yet to fully recover, and pushed him as he shot forward.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Tree God seemed to have lost its ability to resist and could not
        stop Han Xiao at all. The two of them surrounded each other and broke
        through the third and fourth layers of defense. Not long after, they
        reached the fifth layer of defense. The World Tree's main body that
        supported this dimension was now right in front of them.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The eyes of the Galactic Alliance Army and the World Tree fleet all
        focused on Black Star. Seeing that Black Star was approaching the World
        Tree's main body, everyone's hearts were in their throats.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, right at this moment, the Tree God's green domain suddenly
        expanded.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Buzz!</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The green light exploded and enveloped the two of them. It then shrank
        into a light spot and disappeared. The two of them were swallowed up and
        disappeared from the battlefield under the eyes of everyone.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This scene was out of the Galactic Alliance Army's expectations.
        Countless people's hearts suddenly constricted, and they did not know
        what had happened.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At the same time, in the Strategic Command of the Allied Army.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Simon rushed to the table, his eyes wide with shock.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Where's Black Star? Where the f**k did the two of them go?!!"
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-1438">
      <h1 class="h" itemprop="headline">
        Chapter 1439: Exhausted<span hidden="" class="calibre1"> | </span>
      </h1>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This was a deep and vast space, like a real universe. The black velvet
        curtain was decorated with green stars, bright and dazzling
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Suddenly, a green light appeared out of nowhere, spinning and expanding,
        turning into a wormhole-like vortex and spitting out Han Xiao's figure.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao quickly stabilized himself and looked around curiously.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Where did you bring me?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He glanced at the interface, and the combat information showed his
        current state. He had been ‘swallowed by the Tree God. This
        universe-like world was the inner space of the Tree God.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The next moment, Han Xiao immediately felt the repulsion of the entire
        world. Pressure came from all directions, suppressing his strength. The
        Void Domain was so compressed that it could only stick to the surface of
        the body, almost becoming a flat membrane.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At the same time, Han Xiao also discovered that an unknown corrosive
        force was continuously reducing his health. It was shown in his status
        bar as the ‘World Tree's Digestive Function'.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "So, I've fallen into the stomach of the World Tree."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Han Xiao thought to himself.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Buzz!</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Right at this moment, the green light in front of Han Xiao's eyes shrank
        and condensed into the body of the Tree God. Its injuries had already
        recovered, and it stood in the distance.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Black Star, our battle is not over yet," the Ancestral Tree King said
        with a deep voice.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao sized him up and said, "This is your inner space, right? How
        dare you suck me in? You're really not afraid of death."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Releasing the Inner Spatial Domain did not have any side effects,
        because it was just a projection of power, just like the descent of a
        secondary dimension. However, absorbing the enemy into the Inner Spatial
        Domain was the opposite. This was a dangerous action. If the Inner
        Spatial Domain was destroyed, the Transcendent would be heavily injured,
        which was equivalent to exposing their vital points to the enemy.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, in the inner space, the enemy's strength would be greatly
        suppressed, and the user would receive a higher boost. Therefore, this
        was a double-edged sword.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        No matter how tanky Han Xiao was, he was not willing to suck any enemy
        into his body. This would only increase the risk. In his eyes, the
        Ancestral Tree King was putting everything on the line without thinking.
        "If you don't die, the mother tree will never have a day of peace. This
        will be where you die!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Ancestral Tree King's tone was fierce, and he attacked without
        hesitation.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Countless green lights shot out toward Han Xiao like meteors.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Seeing this, Han Xiao lifted the Emperor's Cape, and the thick psionic
        shield blocked the dense rain of light.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At the same time, he ordered his mechanical army to open fire, but they
        did not attack the Tree God. Instead, they exploded in all directions,
        triggering many energy bombs. Under normal circumstances, attacking the
        inner space was akin to turning the world upside down in the other
        party's body. The damage would be reflected back to the Tree God.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, the next moment, something that Han Xiao did not expect
        happened. The Tree God was not affected at all, and he even gave up all
        his defenses. His attacks were extremely fierce, as though he was not
        worried about his internal space being damaged at all.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao was a little surprised. His Void Domain was suppressed, and the
        Tree God was like a fish in water in his internal space. His strength
        was decreasing, and he had no choice but to defend.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Interesting. Your inner space won't be damaged?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao narrowed his eyes and observed the flow of energy while
        resisting the attacks of the Ancestral Tree King.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Not long after, Han Xiao's eyes lit up, and he smiled.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "I see. I have roughly guessed it. Your inner space is connected to the
        World Tree and you transferred all the damage, right?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The ancestral tree king's heart tightened, but he did not reply. His
        attacks became more intense.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The things that the World Tree devoured formed a ‘Mother Tree World'
        within its body. It also had planets and lives, and most of them
        operated according to the state when they were swallowed. They would not
        increase or decrease naturally, and it was equivalent to a special
        ‘gallery'. If the members of the World Tree were not willing to appear
        in the outside world, they would live in the Mother Tree World. The
        so-called transformation of the World Tree was like spitting something
        out from the body into the outside world.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Tree God was closely connected to the World Tree's main body, so
        there was a connection between its internal space and the mother tree
        world. Strictly speaking, the internal space of the Tree God was a clone
        and interlayer of the mother tree world, and the Ancestral Tree King was
        able to split the damage suffered by the internal space into the mother
        tree world.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This way, the World Tree's main body would suffer some damage, and the
        Tree God would not be injured and could remain in peak condition… Under
        normal circumstances, the Ancestral Tree King would not let the World
        Tree's main body take this risk, but now, increasing the Tree God's
        combat strength was more important, so he could only make a temporary
        choice.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Therefore, in order to prevent the World Tree's main body from suffering
        any further damage, the Ancestral Tree King chose to end the battle as
        soon as possible and deal with Han Xiao before he caused even more
        damage to the internal space!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Seeing that Han Xiao had discovered his weakness so quickly, the
        Ancestral Tree King clenched his teeth.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Even if I have to gamble our future, I have to kill you!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As soon as he said that, the Fortitude Tree King's crown shattered!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The powerful Crown Origin Energy surged in, and the power of the Tree
        God soared once again!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Intensive mechanical armor rapidly spread across the surface of the Tree
        God's body. At the same time, mechanical soldiers shining with green
        light appeared around the Tree God. This scene was like a Legendary
        Mechanic activating (Virtual Creation).
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, the Ancestral Tree King did not stop. He endured the rising
        pain and directly took over the allocation of ‘King's Legacy' from the
        Mother Tree Will.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Sacrificing the Tree King Crown was the way to strengthen the Tree God,
        but it was not the only way. Among the abilities that Han Xiao did not
        see, there were other ways to strengthen it, and investing more
        Beyonder's Vestige was another way.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        If the Beyonder's Vestige was a ‘firewood' that could ignite the power
        of the Tree God, then adding more ‘firewood' would naturally make the
        flames burn even stronger.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After so many years, generations of tree kings had failed to break
        through to the Transcendent Grade, leaving behind some ‘King's Legacy',
        which were considered strategic resources.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Initially, he only needed to use one portion to summon the Tree God each
        time, but the Ancestral Tree King could not be bothered anymore and
        burned half of the inventory!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Bang!</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        A violent energy tide spread out, and the power level of the Tree God
        increased steadily. Thick green waves gushed out as if they were going
        to fill the entire space.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Holy, another SEED activation[1] ?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Han Xiao gritted his teeth.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This is too much. Are you a Saiyan… ahh, no, Saiyan Tree ?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After sacrificing three Crowns and burning half of the Beyonder's
        Vestige stock, the Tree God's combat capability soared to a higher
        level, and his combat style changed as well. Other than using the
        strength of the World Tree, the various magic, martial arts, and
        mechanical systems formed an exquisite combination. One person was like
        a powerhouse of three different classes, very flashy but also very
        powerful.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        For a time, the violent attacks penetrated the shield, leaving all kinds
        of wounds on the body of the Supreme Heavenly Venerate. One device after
        another was destroyed.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "I still can't underestimate this guy. With the World Tree
        Civilization's many years of foundation, there's a lot of room for his
        combat strength to fluctuate…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao felt immense pressure from the Ancestral Tree King's continuous
        attacks, and he was slightly shocked.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        If he had not sealed the Heart Tree Crown, the complete Tree God might
        have been able to completely suppress him after receiving so many
        enhancements.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, the current Tree God was in an incomplete state. Its foundation
        had been weakened, so the SEED activation effect was also reduced, and
        it could not reach its peak.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "What a pity. If this is your full strength, the one dying today won't
        be me."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Han Xiao's tone became serious.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Boom!</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Without waiting for the Ancestral Tree King to react, the energy level
        of the Supreme Heavenly Venerate also increased tremendously. In the
        blink of an eye, he caught up to the level of the Tree God's combat
        strength after the SEED activation!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        All kinds of strange abilities exploded one after another, stopping the
        attack of the Ancestral Tree King in an instant. Han Xiao immediately
        took back the initiative and counterattacked, instantly turning the
        situation around.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">The Ancestral Tree King's eyes widened. "You…"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Tsk, do you think that the SEED activation is your patent?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao narrowed his eyes. A steady stream of new energy entered his
        body, bringing with it an incomparable sense of power. He almost felt
        like he could shatter the universe.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The reason for this instant change was because he had used the Character
        Summon Cards in his inventory.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Ever since stepping into the peak Beyond Grade A realm, Han Xiao had not
        used his Character Summon Cards that much. Because there was no need for
        that, he had a lot of stock.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Before this expedition, he had specially used all his blank Character
        Summon Cards to replicate the abilities of different Beyond Grade As and
        obtained a large number of resources.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After finally accumulating a huge amount of wealth, Han Xiao now
        activated the Character Summon Cards one after another without any
        heartache. He used whatever he had. He only felt carefree and happy!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After such a long time of careful planning, he could finally be
        extravagant!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Compared to Saint Seiya's explosion of a little universe, I'm the
        expert!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Sensing that Black Star's strength had caught up once again, the
        Ancestral Tree King was furious.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Every time the gap between them opened up, he would eventually catch up.
        Black Star's unfathomable trump cards made the already unstable
        Ancestral Tree King go completely crazy!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Black Star!"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Bang!</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The last Tree King Crown exploded; the Ancestral Tree King decisively
        sacrificed his own crown!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He threw all his worries to the back of his mind and poured all the
        remaining Beyonder's Vestige into the Tree God's body.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He was going to push the power of the Tree God up regardless of the
        cost!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        His strength increased at an astonishing speed, but at the same time,
        faint green cracks spread on the surface of the Tree God's body. The
        huge burden was already at the limits of the Tree God.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Tree God had its limits, like a container. When the accumulated
        power exceeded its maximum capacity, it would burst from the inside.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Perhaps in its perfect state, the capacity of the Tree God would be able
        to withstand its current power, but the incomplete Tree God was like a
        container that was one size smaller. It could not endure such a burden,
        and its injuries began to accumulate rapidly.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, the Ancestral Tree King ignored the overload and charged toward
        Han Xiao with an unstoppable force.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At this moment, he only had one thought, and that was to kill Black
        Star!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Come!"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Han Xiao was full of fighting spirit.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Bang! Bang! Bang!</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The two of them were overflowing with terrifying power, only attacking
        but not defending. They bombarded each other countless times, and the
        energy clashed, forming an extremely high density explosive area. In
        this place, time and space twisted, almost condensing into
        singularities. The two of them abandoned all distracting thoughts,
        having only their opponents in their eyes. They fought tirelessly, and
        the battlefield spread across this universe.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Space trembled and shattered. The starlight dimmed and died!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        It was unknown how long the battle lasted, but it felt like an eternity.
        Only then did the battle come to an end.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Only by burning the Beyonder's Vestige could the existence of the Tree
        God be maintained. The Tree God had finally run out of energy, and the
        power obtained from the SEED activation quickly weakened. The Tree God's
        body was already filled with cracks from the overload, like a piece of
        porcelain pieced together after being shattered.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Crack!</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Tree God's chest suddenly split open, triggering a chain reaction.
        With its chest as the center, its entire body ‘collapsed', turning into
        fragments of light that filled the sky.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">This scene represented the death of the Tree God.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Tree God also had life. Once it was killed, the fused Tree Kings
        would also be heavily damaged, and the Tree God's Descent would enter a
        cooldown… In addition, because the four Tree King Crowns had been
        sacrificed, the World Tree could not summon the Tree God anymore.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In the sky full of light fragments, the Ancestral Tree King's body
        floated. It was as if he had overdrawn all his lifespan, becoming old
        and wrinkled.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As the Tree God dissipated, the Ancestral Tree King also slowly turned
        into dust. His life was like a candle in the wind.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "I lost… I'm sorry Mother Tree, I failed you… I was so close, I can't
        accept it…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">was</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Ancestral Tree King's consciousness gradually dissipated as he muttered
        to himself.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao still did not relax. He received the Ancestral Tree King's
        intermittent brainwaves, clicked his tongue, and said mercilessly, "What
        do you mean by almost? From the start to the end, you had no chance at
        all."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Ancestral Tree King turned around and glared at Han Xiao.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "…I did not protect my civilization, but one day, you will also taste my
        despair! I curse
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">you…"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Don't look so bitter. When you destroyed other civilizations, you
        should have been prepared to be destroyed as well."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao did not want to waste any more time talking to him. He
        stretched out his hand and grabbed the Ancestral Tree King.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Pu!</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Ancestral Tree King was crushed and turned into dust. His
        consciousness completely fell into darkness.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao was not interested in waiting for him to die. He was not a
        villain who did not know how to deal the finishing blow.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Due to the manipulation of the World Tree, the Ancestral Tree King had
        already lost the ability to revive. If he died in this state, he would
        truly die and disappear.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Finally got him. Damn, he almost squeezed me dry."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Only at this moment did Han Xiao finally relax.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Although he had won this battle, Han Xiao was also exhausted. In the
        final stage, it was as though the Tree God had activated the Ultra
        Instinct Technique. It was so powerful that it almost shattered his
        Supreme Heavenly Venerate several times.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Strictly speaking, the one who killed the Tree God was not Han Xiao but
        the Ancestral Tree King himself. The damage caused by the overload and
        the burning of the Beyonder's Vestige was the main reason the Tree God
        was so exhausted.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        If the Tree God was in the perfect state where all five crowns were
        gathered, Han Xiao felt that he would not be a match for it.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Unfortunately, there were no ifs in this world.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Crack!</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The moment the Tree God died completely, the space inside began to
        collapse rapidly, splitting open like a broken mirror. Dazzling light
        flowed through every crack, leading to the outside world.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao calmed himself down and retrieved the heavily damaged
        mechanical army back into the Godly Stronghold. He then drove the
        Supreme Heavenly Venerate into one of the cracks and disappeared in the
        light.

      </h1>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In the main dimension of the World Tree, the war had reached its climax.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Black Star and the Tree God had disappeared together for a very long
        time. Due to the sudden change, the galactic allied forces did not know
        what was going on. Countless officers and soldiers could only endure
        their unease and fear and continue to fight.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Due to the lack of a sharp blade like Black Star, the advancement of the
        army was also slowed down considerably.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At this moment, the interstellar fleet had just arrived at the second
        layer of defense, and the World Tree Blessing Race did not care about
        the cost and reinforced the defense line. The battlefield was like a
        millstone, crushing the battleships and soldiers into powder. There were
        countless casualties, and it was a huge blow to both sides. Without
        Black Star's support, the advancement of the Beyond Grade As was also
        blocked. However, the quality and scale of their combat strength still
        exceeded the current high-level combatants of the World Tree. After the
        protracted battles, the Beyond Grade As of the galactic society had
        already annihilated most of the high-level combatants on the World
        Tree's side.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, because the Beyond Grade As did not have the strength to ignore
        the large-scale galactic battlefield like Black Star, they could not
        enter even after killing many of the World Tree's experts. On the
        contrary, due to the intense firepower of the World Tree's Blessed Race,
        they did not dare to advance too far and be used as targets. They could
        only retreat to the vicinity of the main force to cooperate. Although
        there was not much danger with Aurora's help, the Beyond Grade As were
        temporarily unable to turn the situation around. After all, the World
        Tree had too many troops. "I wonder where Black Star is. Can you contact
        him?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kasuyi placed his hand on his forehead and asked in the Beyond Grade A
        combat channel while controlling his psychic energy to shatter the
        enemies one by one.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "I can't contact him. It's most likely that the Tree God used some trump
        card to prevent Black Star from continuing his advance and brought him
        to some alternate dimension. I guess they can only come out after a
        victor is decided." Hila casually replied. She manipulated the cold
        current of death and swept it across the fleet. Red ice crystals grew
        out of the battleships and broke through the hulls.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Black Star won't lose, right?" Oulou asked hesitantly.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "There's nothing to be afraid of. Whether Black Star wins or not, he can
        come and go as he wishes." Hila was not worried about Han Xiao's safety
        at all.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "It's hard to say. The World Tree Civilization has developed to this
        point and is unfathomable. No one knows what other trump cards they
        have. Maybe Black Star will fall for it too…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Although Hila, Aurora, and the others were not worried, many Beyond
        Grade As were.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        It was not that they did not believe in Black Star's strength, but no
        one could say for sure what would happen in a war of this scale. As the
        saying goes, ‘concern leads to confusion'. Black Star had the
        responsibility of leading the association, and he was the ruler of the
        Sanctum Revival. It was difficult for a portion of the Beyond Grade As
        not to feel nervous, especially when they knew nothing about Black
        Star's current situation.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At the same time, in the strategic command center, Wuornos' remote
        projection was also present, watching the battle.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Most of the Beyond Grade As in the galactic society were involved in
        this war, but Wuornos was not one of them.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        When the church came to find him, he still refused to participate in
        this battle. The reason was the same as before-he needed to maintain a
        perfect state at all times and did not want to waste his energy in other
        areas, lest he missed the opportunity to step into the Transcendent
        Grade.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Because there was a true Transcendent like Black Star participating in
        the battle, the Arcane Church did not force Wuornos to take action.
        However, Wuornos did not reject the request to watch the battle.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        On the side, the officers and staff officers discussed nonstop for the
        sake of the battle. Wuornos did not interrupt from the start to the end.
        He stood alone and watched the battlefield silently.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He did not have much interest in the battle and only requested to watch
        because he wanted to see a battle between Transcendent Grade Supers. He
        planned to use this to inspire himself, but this idea fell through.
        "Black Star and the Tree God should be fighting in the alternate
        dimension, but I can't see them…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Wuornos sighed.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He had only seen a small portion of the battle between the two of them
        on the main battlefield, and neither of them had used any of their trump
        cards. He could not help but feel that it was a pity that he could not
        see the rest of the battle. He only felt that he had yet to satisfy his
        curiosity, and his heart was
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">itching</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        If he could watch the entire battle between the two Transcendent Grades,
        his chances of entering the realm would be higher…
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Just as he was secretly feeling regretful, a strange feeling suddenly
        surfaced in his heart. It was an indescribable feeling as if he had lost
        something
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Strange…"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This feeling came and went very quickly. Wuornos pressed on his chest,
        somewhat confused.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Before he could think about it, the officer beside him suddenly
        exclaimed.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Wuornos turned around and saw Black Star, who had disappeared for a long
        time, appearing on the battlefield once again. This immediately caused a
        change in the situation.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The fifth layer of the World Tree's defense circle was right where the
        two of them had disappeared. A smattering of green light suddenly burst
        out, and a huge figure flew out. It was Han Xiao's Supreme Heavenly
        Venerate.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Black Star is back!"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Galactic Alliance Army was overjoyed. They opened their eyes wide
        and waited for the Tree God to appear.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, the next moment, the green light exploded and turned into light
        fragments. The Tree God did not come out. It was as if he had really
        disappeared. "Where's the Tree God? Where did he go?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Many of them were excited, beginning to come out with conjectures.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Before they could ask, Han Xiao connected to the combat channel again
        and confirmed their guess.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "I've already gotten rid of the Tree God. He won't stop us anymore.
        Continue attacking!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Han Xiao exhaled.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Seeing that the battlefield was still in a stalemate, he was relieved.
        He was afraid that if he was held back by the Tree God for too long,
        something might happen on the battlefield.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He did not waste any time. He continued to rush toward the World Tree's
        main body without hesitation. He bore the brunt of the enemy's attacks
        and entered the defense circle alone. Seeing that Han Xiao did not
        mention anything about the battle, although they were curious, they did
        not ask too much. To them, knowing the outcome was enough.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Follow Black Star!"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Victory belongs to us!" The Galactic Alliance Army was motivated. Their
        uneasiness was gone, and they followed closely behind, launching even
        more ferocious attacks.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao had thought that after the Tree God died in battle, the morale
        of the World Tree Family would be low and they would be defeated.
        However, to his surprise, the result was the opposite.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Not only did the World Tree team not retreat, but their counterattack
        was even more intense. They abandoned all their worries and fought with
        their backs to the wall.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The casualties were extremely tragic, but the World Tree Blessed Race
        did not retreat even in the face of death. The fleets on the periphery
        abandoned their formation lines one after another and teleported to the
        fifth layer of defense. They charged toward Han Xiao like moths to a
        flame, using their lives to build a barrier to slow him down at all
        costs.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In fact, all the members of the World Tree saw the entire process of the
        Tree God resisting Black Star through the mental network.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Every time the Tree God exploded with power, everyone knew what price
        the Ancestral Tree King had paid. Seeing the Tree King, who usually only
        dwelled in the King City risking his life at all costs, countless
        members of the World Tree felt the same and encouraged him anxiously,
        hoping that the Tree God would defeat Black Star with his burst of
        strength.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, the high hopes that they had all turned into disbelief. Seeing
        that the Ancestral Tree King had paid such a huge price only to be
        completely killed by Han Xiao, a huge sense of tragedy crashed into the
        hearts of all the World Tree members, leaving only despair.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        All the members of the World Tree understood that there was no one who
        could stop Black Star. However, this triggered their final
        determination.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As the saying went, a cornered soldier will find all means to win. The
        morale of the World Tree Blessed Race did not decline but instead
        increased exponentially. No one gave up, and everyone was willing to die
        together with the enemy.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        If they could not rely on the Tree God, they could only rely on
        themselves!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        All the fear and confusion disappeared, leaving only the determination
        to die. This was the final counterattack of a civilization at its end!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Hong Long Long</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The densely packed battleships blocked the path ahead. Han Xiao attacked
        time and time again. The flashes of his blades and artillery could
        shatter a large number of battleships with every attack. However, there
        were people filling up the gaps, and it was difficult to clear a path.
        Continuous high-density explosions surrounded him, and Han Xiao felt as
        though he was stuck in a swamp. The concentrated attacks coming from the
        front even exceeded the pressure that the Tree God gave him.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"What a stubborn civilization…"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao was also slightly moved. Although they were opponents, he had
        to admit that the tenacity displayed by the World Tree Civilization
        exceeded his previous judgment.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In his previous life, even the galactic society that was united against
        the outside world was weaker than the World Tree fleet. In the final
        battle, the World Tree fleet did not show such determination either.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Although the World Tree is a deformed civilization, in terms of unity
        and cohesion, they probably won't find any similar opponent in the
        entire universe…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Han Xiao shook his head.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He appreciated the World Tree's desperate struggle, but unfortunately,
        without the Tree God, the World Tree could no longer stop him. All of
        this was futile.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao turned around and looked at the large group of Beyond Grade As
        behind him.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This hint made all the Beyond Grade As understand. They spread out and
        formed a loose formation in front of the various armies.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        If one did not look closely, they would not be able to notice that the
        formation was like a net, trapping the fleet at the front.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The victory was already decided. The problem now was to pick peaches…
        no, to prevent others from picking peaches.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Seeing this, Han Xiao turned around and activated a Character Summon
        Card.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Golden Ring" Oulou Character Summon Card &ndash; [Golden Treasure
        Ship-Collision)!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Dense streams of light suddenly appeared on the body of the Supreme
        Heavenly Venerate. He adjusted his direction before suddenly taking a
        step forward and charging toward the World Tree's main body! The World
        Tree fleet in front of them could not withstand it at all. Their shields
        shattered one after another, and debris flew everywhere!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Supreme Heavenly Venerate was like a gigantic golden meteor that
        pierced through the final defensive perimeter and crashed heavily into
        the World Tree.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Bang!</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Countless roots seemed to have been struck by lightning. With a sudden
        roll, the entire space of the dimension started to tremble!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Let me see what exactly you are made of!"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao hooked his finger and inserted it into the tree.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At this moment, the World Tree's main body, which seemed to have been
        waiting for death, finally revealed its secret card!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Buzz!</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In an instant, the consciousness of all the World Tree members turned
        into a terrifying mental impact that had never been seen before. It
        rushed toward Han Xiao's brain through the energy link channel. The
        impact was so strong that even if all the Beyond Grade As in the
        galactic society joined forces to resist it, their minds would be
        shattered in a single breath!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The main body of the World Tree was not completely powerless. When both
        parties built a physical or energy connection, she would be able to
        launch a psychic attack on the target. This was because only by invading
        the world tree with energy could they form a soul connection with her
        and take the initiative to turn her into a controlled Universal
        Treasure. This was her trump card to protect herself from being enslaved
        by others!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, at this moment, Han Xiao unveiled another Character Summon Card
        without hesitation.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Underworld" Onicelu Character Summon Card&mdash;[Thousand Soul Stream)!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Immunity to all mental attacks! In his mind, the destructive Psychic
        Current bombarded Han Xiao's spiritual body, but it was like a breeze,
        not causing any damage. Instead, it turned into pure energy and was
        absorbed by Han Xiao. "I've been waiting for this… Come and meet your
        natural enemy!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao's eyes lit up. The next moment, a translucent snake shot out
        from between his brows, and its body expanded at an unbelievable speed.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Pivotal Snake had already turned into a Virtual Life Form, and its
        size in the physical world could be shrunk at will. In the blink of an
        eye, it became the size of the World Tree. It coiled around the World
        Tree's body, opened its mouth, and bit down without hesitation.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        With this bite, the Pivotal Snake and the World Tree's main body finally
        established a bridge of information, and countless information streams
        were exchanged rapidly.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Buzz</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The entire World Tree trembled violently, as though a person was
        struggling in pain, causing the space to shake violently!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In order to subdue the World Tree, Han Xiao had naturally come prepared.
        Building a soul connection was only one of the reasons. The biggest
        problem was actually to destroy the resistance of the World Tree, and
        his trump card was the Pivotal Snake.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After the Pivot turned into a Virtual Life Form, it automatically
        awakened a new ability, which was why it was the World Tree's natural
        enemy. The World Tree's independent consciousness was its food!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Only then did Han Xiao understand the significance of the Pivotal Snake.
        It could turn the World Tree from a special life form into an
        unconscious Universal Treasure!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        It was because of this trump card that Han Xiao finally made up his mind
        to carry out the plan to subdue the World Tree. He would not do anything
        that he was not confident of!

      <p class="calibre3">
        The gigantic Pivotal Snake coiled around the World Tree and bit it.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Although it was only an illusory Virtual Life Form and could not harm
        physical objects, the Pivotal Snake's method of harming the World Tree
        was an Information Form channel that only targeted the Mother Tree's
        will. The World Tree's main body struggled frantically, trying to break
        free from the Pivotal Snake. However, the waving roots could not touch
        the Pivotal Snake's virtual body at all.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Although the World Tree was strong, the reason why the Pivotal Snake was
        its natural enemy was because of its unresolvable restraint. The will of
        the Mother Tree did not have the time to care about Han Xiao, and the
        mental shock was immediately silenced. It was held up by the Pivotal
        Snake and struggled non-stop, like a young girl anxiously grabbing her
        clothes and not letting anyone strip her naked.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        An endless stream of machinery poured out from the Godly Stronghold and
        fused into the Supreme Heavenly Venerate, causing Han Xiao's body to
        expand rapidly. His arms could gradually wrap around the trunk as though
        he was going to uproot the World Tree. While the mother tree's will was
        in chaos, Han Xiao did not hesitate to use his energy to infiltrate the
        World Tree's body and attempt to form a Soul Connection, dyeing the
        other party with his own color and turning it into his own shape. To the
        members of the World Tree Family, this feeling was akin to having their
        faith insulted. Countless people charged toward Han Xiao with bloodshot
        eyes, and batches of them were destroyed midway.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Because of Han Xiao's actions, the World Tree fleet was inevitably
        thrown into chaos. The galactic alliance army naturally would not let go
        of such a good opportunity. The fleet quickly penetrated the defensive
        perimeter and reached the fourth layer very quickly, suffering an even
        more intense counterattack. The troops at the front were not far from
        Han Xiao, and they all provided firepower support to help him intercept
        the World Tree's troops. Energy beams shot everywhere, detonating a
        series of battleships on the battlefield. On the other side, seeing that
        Black Star had successfully arrived beside the World Tree's main body,
        the commanders in the strategic command center were excited. "Good!
        Black Star has already stepped on the World Tree Civilization's
        weakness!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "We'll have to rely on him to destroy the World Tree's main body. We
        have to protect him and let him focus on dealing with the World Tree."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Even at a conservative estimate, our chances of winning are more than
        95%!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "The World Tree has no chance of turning the tables!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The officers were excited. The goal of the three Universal Civilizations
        in starting this battle was to eliminate the enemy in one fell swoop,
        hoping to finish everything. Thus, they had gathered most of the forces
        of the explored universe. Although it could not be said that it was to
        the extent of win or die trying, if they lost this war, the three
        Universal Civilizations would also suffer heavy losses, and the gains
        would not make up for the losses. Therefore, before going out to war,
        many officers had made a military pledge that they would only win and
        not lose. However, the officers did not want to lie to themselves.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Their confidence came from Black Star and the Pivotal Snake. If they did
        not have such a trump card, they would not have dared to say they would
        definitely win. Seeing that Black Star had killed the Tree God, broken
        through the encirclement, and was uprooting the mother tree, almost
        single-handedly pushing the battle forward, everyone heaved a sigh of
        relief. They felt that they trusted the right person… As expected, this
        war was still being carried by Black Star.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, the leaders of the three Universal Civilizations were not happy
        at all. Instead, their expressions were solemn, as though they had some
        concerns.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Pope hesitated for a moment before speaking "Why do I feel like
        Black Star isn't destroying the main body of the World Tree?" Hearing
        this, the officers were stunned. They suppressed the joy in their hearts
        and carefully observed Han Xiao's actions toward the World Tree. The
        more they looked, the stranger they felt. "That does seem to be the
        case… He is not continuing to attack, more like he is subduing the World
        Tree's main body… Is he trying to control the World Tree "
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Everyone was shocked and understood that the situation had become
        complicated.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The officers turned around, and as expected, the expressions of the
        three leaders became extremely ugly. "What a great Black Star! I knew he
        had other plans. Isn't he afraid of dying from overeating
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Louis was furious.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Our worries were right. He used us to defeat the World Tree's troops
        and create an opportunity for him to subdue the World Tree's main body.
        We can't let him achieve his goal!" The Pope was furious.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The World Tree was too powerful. No matter where it landed, it was a
        threat to the three Universal Civilizations. The three Universal
        Civilizations only wanted to destroy it, and they did not even dare to
        take the risk of capturing it. Black Star was already an existence
        beyond the norm, and the three Universal Civilizations could no longer
        control him. If Black Star was to obtain the World Tree, he would be a
        threat to them. It would be equivalent to him obtaining a Universal
        Civilization, and he would be able to rival the entire explored
        universe. In fact, he might even surpass them to a certain extent. It
        would be enough to shake the foundation of their rule!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Although the internal conflicts were temporarily suppressed by the
        invasion of the enemy, the three Universal Civilizations did not forget
        the fear of losing control over the individual strengths. They still had
        conflicts with Black Star that were difficult to reconcile. Once the war
        ended, these problems would surface again, so the three of them would
        not watch the Beyond Grade As control the World Tree.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Furthermore, the war had been going on for more than ten years, and the
        three Universal Civilizations were the main victims. They had wasted so
        much time in the war and lost countless resources. Now that they were
        finally going to reap the fruits of their labor, they naturally did not
        want to let Han Xiao steal their fruits.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        We were the ones who mobilized the army to resist the World Tree, and we
        suffered the most losses. However, we created an opportunity for the
        other in the end. Who can tolerate this! Even if Black Star's
        contribution was high, they could not allow him! In the eyes of the
        three of them, Black Star was showing his true intentions. Fighting
        against the enemy together was just an excuse on the surface. Black
        Star's real goal was to use the galactic society's troops to obtain the
        World Tree for himself! The three of them actually had some guesses
        about Han Xiao's selfishness, but it was useless. The war still depended
        on Black Star, and it was almost certain that they would reach this
        stage.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"We can't let Black Star succeed."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Then what should we do? Are we going to fire at Black Star?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Are you crazy? We haven't even won yet, and you still dare to have
        internal strife in front of such a powerful enemy? What are you thinking
        ?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The officers were agitated and started arguing. Simon made a prompt
        decision and shouted, "Inform the direct troops of the three Universal
        Civilizations to stop providing cover fire to Black Star and attack the
        World Tree's main body. We must blow it up before Black Star succeeds!"
        They had to stop Han Xiao, but they could not turn against him. Thus,
        they could only change their tactics temporarily and race Black Star for
        time to destroy the target.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, everyone knew that the World Tree fleet would definitely
        protect the mother tree and stop their firepower. Furthermore, it was
        impossible for Black Star to not be prepared, so he had definitely taken
        some measures to stop them. "It all depends on human effort…" This
        thought flashed through the minds of many of the officers. Their faces
        were stiff, and their attitudes were not optimistic. The order was
        quickly passed down. The direct troops of the three Universal
        Civilizations did not think too much about it and immediately fired at
        the World Tree itself. However, most of the attacks were stopped by the
        World Tree fleet halfway.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Just as the three Universal Civilizations' fleets did this, the Black
        Star Army and all the other Beyond Grade A organizations also reacted.
        They immediately started to slack off and moved around to block the
        attacks of the three Universal Civilizations.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The members of the Beyond Grade A Association also started to move. Some
        of them deliberately guided the World Tree fleet to attack the direct
        troops of the three Universal Civilizations through various positions,
        while others activated their AOE fighting style that did not
        differentiate between friend and foe. They attacked the enemy and the
        three Universal Civilizations together, indirectly disrupting the three
        Universal Civilizations' formation.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Because many of their ‘allies' were causing trouble, the coordination of
        the Galactic Alliance Army was disrupted. Their attacks suddenly slowed
        down, and their advancement became stagnant. They were dragged into the
        chaotic battle by the berserk World Tree fleet and could not withdraw
        for a while. "Damn it!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Pope was furious. He wanted to punch the table, but the remote
        projection could not touch the real thing. His fist passed through the
        table.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "I told you Black Star was prepared." Marbruce also had an unfriendly
        expression. The World Tree's main body struggled frantically, trying to
        break free from the Pivotal Snake. However, the waving roots could not
        touch the Pivotal Snake's virtual body at all.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Although the World Tree was strong, the reason why the Pivotal Snake was
        its natural enemy was because of its unresolvable restraint. The will of

        mental shock was immediately silenced. It was held up by the Pivotal

        perimeter and reached the fourth layer very quickly, suffering an even
        more intense counterattack. The troops at the front were not far from
        Han Xiao, and they all provided firepower support to help him intercept
        the World Tree's troops.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Energy beams shot everywhere, detonating a series of battleships on the
        battlefield. On the other side, seeing that Black Star had successfully
        arrived beside the World Tree's main body, the commanders in the
        strategic command center were excited. "Good! Black Star has already
        stepped on the World Tree Civilization's weakness!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "We'll have to rely on him to destroy the World Tree's main body. We
        have to protect him and let him focus on dealing with the World Tree."
        "Even at a conservative estimate, our chances of winning are more than
        95%!" "The World Tree has no chance of turning the tables!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">The officers were excited.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The goal of the three Universal Civilizations in starting this battle
        was to eliminate the enemy in one fell swoop, hoping to finish
        everything. Thus, they had gathered most of the forces of the explored
        universe. Although it could not be said that it was to the extent of win
        or die trying, if they lost this war, the three Universal Civilizations
        would also suffer heavy losses, and the gains would not make up for the
        losses. Therefore, before going out to war, many officers had made a
        military pledge that they would only win and not lose. However, the
        officers did not want to lie to themselves.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Their confidence came from Black Star and the Pivotal Snake. If they did
        not have such a trump card, they would not have dared to say they would
        definitely win. Seeing that Black Star had killed the Tree God, broken
        through the encirclement, and was uprooting the mother tree, almost
        single-handedly pushing the battle forward, everyone heaved a sigh of
        relief. They felt that they trusted the right person… As expected, this
        war was still being carried by Black Star. However, the leaders of the
        three Universal Civilizations were not happy at all. Instead, their
        expressions were solemn, as though they had some concerns.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">The Pope hesitated for a moment before speaking.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Why do I feel like Black Star isn't destroying the main body of the
        World Tree?" Hearing this, the officers were stunned. They suppressed
        the joy in their hearts and carefully observed Han Xiao's actions toward
        the World Tree. The more they looked, the stranger they felt. "That does
        seem to be the case…
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He is not continuing to attack, more like he is subduing the World
        Tree's main body…
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Is he trying to control the World Tree P". Everyone was shocked and
        understood that the situation had become complicated. The officers
        turned around, and as expected, the expressions of the three leaders
        became extremely ugly. "What a great Black Star! I knew he had other
        plans. Isn't he afraid of dying from overeating
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Louis was furious.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Our worries were right. He used us to defeat the World Tree's troops
        and create an opportunity for him to subdue the World Tree's main body.
        We can't let him achieve his
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">goal!"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Pope was furious. The World Tree was too powerful. No matter where
        it landed, it was a threat to the three Universal Civilizations. The
        three Universal Civilizations only wanted to destroy it, and they did
        not even dare to take the risk of capturing it. Black Star was already
        an existence beyond the norm, and the three Universal Civilizations
        could no longer control him. If Black Star was to obtain the World Tree,
        he would be a threat to them. It would be equivalent to him obtaining a
        Universal Civilization, and he would be able to rival the entire
        explored universe. In fact, he might even surpass them to a certain
        extent. It would be enough to shake the foundation of their rule!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Although the internal conflicts were temporarily suppressed by the
        invasion of the enemy, the three Universal Civilizations did not forget
        the fear of losing control over the individual strengths. They still had
        conflicts with Black Star that were difficult to reconcile. Once the war
        ended, these problems would surface again, so the three of them would
        not watch the Beyond Grade As control the World Tree.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Furthermore, the war had been going on for more than ten years, and the
        three Universal Civilizations were the main victims. They had wasted so
        much time in the war and lost countless resources. Now that they were
        finally going to reap the fruits of their labor, they naturally did not
        want to let Han Xiao steal their fruits.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        We were the ones who mobilized the army to resist the World Tree, and we
        suffered the most losses. However, we created an opportunity for the
        other in the end. Who can tolerate this!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Even if Black Star's contribution was high, they could not allow him!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In the eyes of the three of them, Black Star was showing his true
        intentions. Fighting against the enemy together was just an excuse on
        the surface. Black Star's real goal was to use the galactic society's
        troops to obtain the World Tree for himself! The three of them actually
        had some guesses about Han Xiao's selfishness, but it was useless. The
        war still depended on Black Star, and it was almost certain that they
        would reach this stage. "We can't let Black Star succeed." "Then what
        should we do? Are we going to fire at Black Star?" "Are you crazy? We
        haven't even won yet, and you still dare to have internal strife in
        front of such a powerful enemy? What are you thinking ?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The officers were agitated and started arguing. Simon made a prompt
        decision and shouted, "Inform the direct troops of the three Universal
        Civilizations to stop providing cover fire to Black Star and attack the
        World Tree's main body. We must blow it up before Black Star succeeds!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        They had to stop Han Xiao, but they could not turn against him. Thus,
        they could only change their tactics temporarily and race Black Star for
        time to destroy the target. However, everyone knew that the World Tree
        fleet would definitely protect the mother tree and stop their firepower.
        Furthermore, it was impossible for Black Star to not be prepared, so he
        had definitely taken some measures to stop them. "It all depends on
        human effort…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This thought flashed through the minds of many of the officers. Their
        faces were stiff, and their attitudes were not optimistic. The order was
        quickly passed down. The direct troops of the three Universal
        Civilizations did not think too much about it and immediately fired at
        the World Tree itself. However, most of the attacks were stopped by the
        World Tree fleet halfway. Just as the three Universal Civilizations'
        fleets did this, the Black Star Army and all the other Beyond Grade A
        organizations also reacted.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        They immediately started to slack off and moved around to block the
        attacks of the three Universal Civilizations.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The members of the Beyond Grade A Association also started to move. Some
        of them deliberately guided the World Tree fleet to attack the direct
        troops of the three Universal Civilizations through various positions,
        while others activated their AOE fighting style that did not
        differentiate between friend and foe. They attacked the enemy and the
        three Universal Civilizations together, indirectly disrupting the three
        Universal Civilizations' formation.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Because many of their ‘allies' were causing trouble, the coordination of
        the Galactic Alliance Army was disrupted. Their attacks suddenly slowed
        down, and their advancement became stagnant. They were dragged into the
        chaotic battle by the berserk World Tree fleet and could not withdraw
        for a while. "Damn it!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Pope was furious. He wanted to punch the table, but the remote
        projection could not touch the real thing. His fist passed through the
        table.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "I told you Black Star was prepared." Marbruce also had an unfriendly
        expression. Both parties were aware of their respective goals and were
        obstructing each other, but on the surface, they still had to pretend to
        fight together as if all their actions were focused on attacking the
        World Tree. This situation could be said to be hiding different purposes
        behind the semblance of the accord. The three leaders did not want to go
        against the others and affect the war, but they felt that they had no
        choice.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Due to the conflict between the two sides, the galactic alliance army
        had split into three parties. One was the three Universal Civilizations'
        direct troops that wanted to destroy World Tree's main body, and the
        other was the Beyond Grade A forces who provided cover for Black Star
        and obstructed the three Universal Civilizations. The final party was
        the remaining allied forces who were fighting seriously and were shocked
        by the ‘chaos' on the two sides.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        They did not know what was going on. Why did the other two suddenly drag
        each other down? The galactic alliance army was in chaos, but the
        conflict between the three Universal Civilizations and the Beyond Grade
        A organizations did not affect Han Xiao's process of subduing the World
        Tree.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao's energy continued to seep into the depths of the World Tree's
        main body. The will of the Mother Tree had already been completely
        destroyed by the Pivotal Snake, and there was no way to stop his
        assault.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Amidst the spiritual entanglement, illusions flashed past Han Xiao's
        eyes, and he saw the history of the World Tree's growth.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        When it was weak, it was worshiped by certain races and was offered all
        kinds of sacrifices. The will of the Mother Tree slowly took shape
        during this process, providing convenience to the races under them while
        guiding them to expand outward. After completing the accumulation, the
        World Tree then embarked on the bloody path of rising up, becoming a
        Universal Predator. One race after another became vassals, and
        civilizations became food. Gradually, it started to grow, and its
        abilities became richer and richer.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Countless memories appeared before Han Xiao's eyes. In a daze, he seemed
        to see a small tree sprout growing rapidly, eventually covering the sun
        and standing on top of the starry sky. Countless wormholes appeared
        between the tree branches, each leading to a different world. Endless
        cosmic radiation storms swept past, but it was like a breeze, only able
        to make the lush leaves sway slightly. Trillions of Blessed Race and
        Believers were spread out on the roots, worshipping sincerely. This
        scene gave off a majestic and mysterious feeling. Buzz!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Suddenly, Han Xiao's eyes cleared, and he stepped out of the illusion. A
        new existence had appeared in his senses. It was the World Tree that had
        successfully formed the Soul Connection.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At this moment, the will of the mother tree finally reached its limit,
        and it was completely devoured by the Pivotal Snake. The next moment,
        the World Tree's main body stopped struggling and lost any ability to
        move independently, turning into a dead object. Han Xiao's body
        trembled, and a stream of information flowed into his mind. It contained
        the various abilities of the World Tree, as well as the control rights.
        Although the authority of the Tree Kings was high, they were still the
        subordinates of the World Tree, while Han Xiao's authority was above the
        Mother Tree and was not under any restrictions.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The surging new energy flowed into Han Xiao's body through the soul
        connection, providing him with a new enhancement, pushing his energy
        level up.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Hiss…</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao could not help but take a deep breath. His entire body was
        filled with energy. Just as he was about to take back the Pivotal Snake,
        he realized that the Pivotal Snake did not stop. Instead, it dived into
        the World Tree and merged into it.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao looked at the interface and saw a new suffix in the name of the
        World Tree.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        (World Tree (Complete Form)]! "Hmm? Could it be that the Pivotal Snake
        was not only a natural enemy, but it could also fuse with the World Tree
        and complete it?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Han Xiao was shocked.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This ability did not appear on the attribute panel of the Pivotal Snake.
        He had only seen it now.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Just as the Pivotal Snake fused into the World Tree, Han Xiao noticed a
        change. He had just formed a Soul Connection with the World Tree, and it
        was only the shallowest layer. It was still very weak, but at this
        moment, the Soul Connection was suddenly strengthened, and it became
        many times stronger.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        If his previous invasion progress on the World Tree was 10%, it was now
        more than 80%!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Could it be that the Pivotal Snake can help the controller better
        control the World Tree?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Han Xiao's heart skipped a beat.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Suppressing the surprise in his heart, Han Xiao felt the power of the
        World Tree. He could not be more satisfied. The World Tree's independent
        will had been cleared, and it had become a tool without any thoughts. It
        was completely controlled by him and could be used at ease.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Due to the devouring and conversion characteristics, the World Tree
        could be regarded as a growth type of Universal Treasure. However, he
        did not need to start from zero because the World Tree had already
        matured. Controlling it was equivalent to gaining the loyalty of the
        entire World Tree Civilization!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The power of this thing was countless times more terrifying than the
        inheritance of the Underworld that Hila and Aurora had!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Cannot blame the three Universal Civilizations for wanting to destroy
        my goal…" Han Xiao turned to look at the battlefield. His eyes flashed,
        and he suddenly activated the authority of the World Tree to recall all
        the World Tree fleets. The World Tree fleet, which had been fighting
        back fearlessly a second ago, suddenly stopped fighting. Without saying
        a word, they turned around and flew into the roots, turning back into
        their information form and entering the mother tree world.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        For a moment, the battlefield was much emptier, and only the galactic
        alliance army was left.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Originally, the members of the World Tree were all filled with the
        desire to fight to the death. However, the moment the will of the mother
        tree disappeared and Han Xiao replaced the control, everyone's hostility
        disappeared. Just as they were feeling lost, a new mission arrived. They
        would not disobey the orders of the World Tree and immediately ceased
        fire and retreated.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "No matter how tragic the counterattack was, they were just a bunch of
        puppets. With the owner changed, they have to listen obediently…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Seeing this, Han Xiao sighed. However, sympathy was sympathy, and he
        would not foolishly let the World Tree Civilization go free. This was
        the World Tree's own foundation.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Seeing that the enemies had left, the galactic alliance army was
        stunned. They then looked at Han Xiao beside the tree and were
        overjoyed.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"We won ?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">"We're still alive!"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Hahahaha-I knew I could trust Black Star!"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Countless soldiers were overjoyed, and the atmosphere of excitement and
        surprise quickly spread throughout the entire army. Every combat channel
        was filled with wild cheers, and even many players who had yet to spend
        all their revivals were affected and cheered along
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, when most of the fleets stopped firing, the direct troops of
        the three Universal Civilizations still did not stop firing at the World
        Tree itself.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Without the obstruction of the World Tree fleet, the direct troops of
        the three Universal Civilizations had a clear way. This scene
        immediately caused the cheers to stop, attracting the shocked gazes of
        countless comrades.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Oh? You still haven't given up. Do you want to pretend you know nothing
        and try to destroy the World Tree one last time while I haven't notified
        you?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao narrowed his eyes. He knew what the three Universal
        Civilizations were thinking
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He suddenly waved his hand, and a thick psionic barrier surrounded the
        World Tree to block the attacks of the fleet.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">At the same time, Han Xiao shouted in the channel.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "You can stop the fire. I've controlled the World Tree."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After waiting for a few seconds, the Pope's solemn voice suddenly
        sounded in the channel.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Since that's the case, let's destroy it. It's still a threat to the
        world!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "There's no need. I've already subdued the World Tree."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "It's not enough! Only by destroying it will we be able to completely
        eliminate the hidden threat! Even if it's you, we won't be at ease!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Do you want to cast us aside so soon?" Han Xiao said with a smile that
        was not a smile.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "You're mistaken. We're only doing this to maintain the peace of the
        galaxy. No one in the galactic society wants to face such a disaster
        again!" the Pope said with a deep voice.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao shook his head. "Stop it. Don't make the situation too ugly. We
        just won. Do you want the other allies to see our internal strife?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Before the Pope could reply, Marbruce interrupted.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Black Star, this is the only thing we can't compromise on! You're the
        one who should stop. You've already made enough contributions, don't be
        stubborn! Let go, you're still the Universe's Hero of the Final War!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Looks like you won't regret it until things are too late…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Han Xiao shook his head.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As soon as he finished speaking, the expressions of the three leaders
        and the officers turned grave.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        They knew that Black Star would not give up so easily, and they were
        already prepared for a conflict to break out. However, their goal was
        only to get rid of the World Tree's main body. Although they were
        suspected of burning the bridge after crossing it, their goal to get rid
        of the hidden threat could be accepted by others. In their opinion, if
        Black Star went on a killing spree against them, it would definitely
        incur the wrath of the masses. The reputation that he had accumulated
        during the war would immediately collapse, and the allies of the other
        civilizations present would also stand on their side to resist Black
        Star together.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Thus, despite being nervous, the three of them were not afraid of Black
        Star fighting back. In fact, they were even looking forward to this
        development.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, the next moment, the three of them widened their eyes.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao did not make a move. Instead, he raised his hand and patted the
        World Tree. The huge World Tree shrank rapidly and turned into a green
        stream of light that flew into Han Xiao's palm, disappearing in front of
        everyone.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"This…"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Marbruce and the other two were stunned.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The battle with the World Tree fleet previously had given them the
        impression that the mother tree could not move, so they felt that they
        had the upper hand. Thus, the three of them would rather take the risk
        of angering Black Star and gather their forces to destroy the World
        Tree.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, the three of them did not expect Black Star to be able to store
        the World Tree and do something that the World Tree Blessed Race could
        not. They could not react in time. What was there to destroy now? In
        fact, Han Xiao could not do this in the beginning. It was all due to the
        Pivotal Snake strengthening his Soul Connection exponentially, crossing
        many stages. This allowed him to unlock more functions, including
        putting the World Tree into the Transcendent's inner space.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Strictly speaking, the inner space was also a type of secondary
        dimension. It could also allow the World Tree to take root in it. This
        way, the inner space would receive a huge enhancement and become
        extremely tough. Furthermore, there was no need to care about the
        weakness of the enemy targeting the World Tree's main body. It was
        equivalent to carrying the mother tree with him. It was very convenient.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao had originally planned to use other methods to force the three
        Universal Civilizations to stop, but the direct conflict was
        unavoidable, and it would damage his reputation more or less. However,
        with this new ability, he changed his plan at the last minute and made
        the three Universal Civilizations lose their target. This would save him
        a lot of effort.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Just as the three leaders were at a loss, Han Xiao's remote projection
        appeared in the strategic command center.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"What do the three of you say now?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The faces of Marbruce and the other two flickered. They did not respond.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Only when the World Tree's main body was exposed in front of the army
        would they have a chance. There was no chance now. As for letting Black
        Star take the initiative to hand it over… the three of them knew it. No
        matter how arrogant they were, they did not think that they had that
        much face.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Black Star, you've succeeded. You must be very happy now…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Marbruce had a complicated expression on his face. His tone was bitter,
        and there was a hint of unwillingness and mockery.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Yes, I am indeed very happy. The war has finally ended, and everyone is
        cheering. Are you not happy about this?" Han Xiao raised his brows.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">The three of them had solemn expressions.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        It would be weird if we were happy. Who knows if we have just left the
        tiger's den but entered the wolf's den again…
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Seeing this, Han Xiao smiled and did not continue teasing them.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Since he had already taken advantage of them, there was no need for him
        to pretend to be innocent. There would be plenty of time for him to
        settle scores in the future. He did not plan to argue with the three of
        them about what had happened just now. This was not the right time.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This time, Han Xiao changed the topic and said, "Alright, let's not talk
        anymore. Let's get down to business. I have a plan, and I hope you guys
        can cooperate." "…What plan?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">The three of them were surprised.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">We just won, what is Black Star planning?</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Don't leak the news of us defeating the World Tree Civilization. This
        Galactic Alliance Army's composition is complicated. It's best to
        control them for the time being."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Er… What are you planning?" Marbruce was confused. Han Xiao smiled and
        said,
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Haven't you guys been trying to find out who leaked the information? I
        said it was a third party, but you guys just don't believe me. I just
        happened to obtain the Information Form Warning Network technology from
        the World Tree. I don't have to explain the effects. You guys have
        already experienced it. This way, you might be able to find traces of a
        third party. What do you guys think?" The eyes of the trio lit up.
      </p>

    <div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-1441">
      <h1 class="h" itemprop="headline">
        Chapter 1442: Further Scheme. The Things Are Still There, but Men Are No
        More the Same Ones.<span hidden="" class="calibre1"> | </span>
      </h1>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This proposal was very constructive, and the three leaders immediately
        took it seriously. After pondering for a while, they quickly came to a
        conclusion with Han Xiao and told the strategic command center to call
        back the three Universal Civilizations' direct troops. Their goal was to
        destroy the World Tree, not to fall out with Black Star. Although they
        were not willing to let Han Xiao subdue the World Tree, there was
        nothing they could do.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Marbruce and the others could only suppress the fear in their hearts and
        wait for a targeted plan to be discussed in the future. In any case,
        there was nothing they could do now. They could not really start the
        second round of the war with Black Star… Who wins and who loses was
        secondary. There was a third party who might still be eyeing them from
        the dark.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Even if they were going to fall out with each other, they should at
        least wait until they had a direct descendant of the Transcendent Grade.
        Wuornos was their greatest hope, and he might advance one day.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The direct troops of the three Universal Civilizations stopped firing
        and silently withdrew from the encirclement. The tension on the
        battlefield quickly dissipated.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The brief confrontation between Han Xiao and the three Universal
        Civilizations had stunned the soldiers of the Galactic Alliance Army.
        They realized that the conflict between the two sides had reemerged, and
        they were extremely nervous. They were afraid that an internal conflict
        would break out as soon as they won. Seeing that both sides had stopped
        fighting, countless people heaved a sigh of relief. They only felt that
        their emotions were in turmoil, and their entire bodies felt a little
        weak. No matter what kind of conflict there was, the three Universal
        Civilizations were the main force in resisting the World Tree, and Black
        Star was the hero who changed the battle. They were all heroes in the
        war. They had just joined forces to defeat the foreign enemy, and now
        they were turning against each other in front of everyone. It was hard
        to accept. No one wished for their joy to turn into sorrow.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, the World Tree was not destroyed but subdued by Black Star.
        This reality made many people feel strange.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Although Black Star had contributed too much to the war, this last wave
        made them feel like Black Star was using them to achieve his goal… Of
        course, there might be a reason for Black Star's actions, but the
        impression he gave everyone was still rather complicated.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, they did not think too much about it and quickly threw this
        thought into the back of their minds.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The conflict between Black Star and the three Universal Civilizations
        was a conflict between the big shots, and it was not their place to
        worry. At this moment, these front-line combatants only wanted to enjoy
        the joy of victory and the joy of surviving the calamity.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"We won!"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Long Live the Dynasty!" For a moment, the cheers of countless soldiers
        echoed in the combat channels.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The officers did not stop them and allowed their soldiers to vent their
        emotions. In reality, they were also excited and could not help but
        celebrate with their subordinates.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        On the other side, Han Xiao deactivated the Supreme Heavenly Venerate
        and retracted his troops. He passed through the direct troops of the
        three Universal Civilizations that had given up on stopping him and
        returned to the army formation of the Beyond Grade A organizations. Many
        Beyond Grade As immediately surrounded him.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "That was close. I thought the three Universal Civilizations were going
        to act arbitrarily and start a civil war."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Sun Hunter wiped his non-existent cold sweat.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kasuyi casually analyzed, "That won't happen. They still have a very
        good understanding of the situation. We're clearly on Black Star's side,
        and Black Star has the World Tree Civilization's troops. The three
        Universal Civilizations won't dare act recklessly. They know what the
        outcome will be, and they won't seek their own death."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Speaking of which, Your Excellency Black Star took too big of a risk
        this time. We didn't know about your plans before this…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Some of them mumbled softly, and many of the association members looked
        at Han Xiao with strange looks. These people did not know about this
        beforehand.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Because there were spies from the Super Star Cluster in the association,
        Han Xiao did not want to leak the news in advance. Therefore, he only
        told Kasuyi and his confidants about his plan to subdue the World Tree,
        and he told the entire association to prevent the three Universal
        Civilizations from trying to get the World Tree.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Therefore, not long ago, a portion of the association members was still
        in the dark. Even if they had doubts, they did not confirm it. They
        could only follow the original plan and work together with their
        teammates to create obstacles for the direct troops of the three
        Universal Civilizations, giving Han Xiao time and creating
        opportunities.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        To be honest, if Han Xiao had stated his goal of subduing the World Tree
        from the start, many Beyond Grade As would not have been willing to help
        him. They would have been like the three Universal Civilizations, more
        inclined to completely destroy the World Tree. After all, the World Tree
        was quite similar to the Underworld, but its power was much higher. It
        could control an individual's thoughts. Even if Black Star was ‘one of
        them' for the time being, who knew what the future would be like?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        If one day, Black Star's ambition reached its peak and he wished to use
        the World Tree to devour everyone, what would they do? They did not
        think this was improbable, killing intent would rise when one held a
        sharp knife. Black Star had no such thoughts in the past because he did
        not have the World Tree. Many Beyond Grade As had to consider their own
        safety and were secretly afraid. Seeing the complicated expressions of
        many Beyond Grade As, Han Xiao did not mind. He smiled and said,
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Everyone, there's no need to worry. I subdued the World Tree because of
        other considerations. One of my intentions is to make use of the World
        Tree's power to make the three Universal Civilizations hesitate and
        consolidate the safety of our Beyond Grade A Association after the war.
        This way, we can completely make the three Universal Civilizations give
        up on suppressing us. Only then can we put down all our worries."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Manison nodded slowly and agreed.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "This is similar to my original plan. However, we were not strong enough
        back then, and it was not the right time. My idea was too far ahead. Now
        that our forces are expanding rapidly through the war, the time is ripe.
        The strategic significance of the World Tree is actually the same as the
        Virtual Mutiny Virus, but it is more suitable as a strategic deterrence
        weapon so that the three Universal Civilizations will no longer dare to
        attack us."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Manison then gave Han Xiao an appreciative look, as though saying ‘we
        are indeed the same type of people.' He was also afraid of Han Xiao's
        threat after obtaining the World Tree, but if he was in that position,
        Manison would have made the same choice. The situation now was similar
        to when he snatched the ‘Virtual Mutiny Virus'. However, he had failed,
        and Black Star had succeeded.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Upon hearing this, some of the association members could not say
        anything no matter how unhappy they were. It was mainly because what was
        done was done. There was no point in objecting.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Seeing this, Aurora changed the topic and said with a smile, "We won
        this war. Everyone, be happy."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Hearing this, everyone relaxed and smiled… No matter what, now was the
        time to enjoy the victory, they still had to give face to the healer.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "We've finally dealt with this powerful enemy. We can take a break now."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Heh, I've been exhausted all these years. Don't wake me up until I've
        slept for a month."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "After enduring the tough times, a beautiful tomorrow is waiting for
        us."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Beyond Grade As were relieved of their burdens and chatted with each
        other.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">At this moment, someone thought of something</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "By the way, Black Star, when do you plan to revive the recently killed
        Beyond Grade As?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In the past year of the war, a few more Beyond Grade As had died in
        battle. Han Xiao had yet to revive them, and their names were still on
        the Soul Comfort Monument.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "After some time, I still have some things to do, so I can't leave for
        the time being, especially when it comes to the establishment of a
        civilization… The timing, location, and people are all in our hands.
        I've convinced the three Universal Civilizations to temporarily track
        down a third party. Taking advantage of this buffer time, we'll let our
        people complete the final preparations for the transformation of the
        association. When the time comes, everything will be in place."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Han Xiao replied casually.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He took out the technology of the Information Form Warning Network and
        convinced the three Universal Civilizations to search for a third party.
        On one hand, he did not want the enemy to continue hiding and benefit
        from it. On the other hand, he also temporarily shifted the focus of the
        three Universal Civilizations and bought time for the final stage of
        preparations for the transformation of the association into a
        Civilization.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The two plans were carried out side by side, killing two birds with one
        stone. This way, he would be busy, and he had to hurry up. For the time
        being, he did not have the time to study how to complete the Virtual
        Creation.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, when talking about the Sanctum Revival, Han Xiao thought about
        the problem of the Iteration.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He had once planned to reveal the information about the Sanctum to the
        three Universal Civilizations when the time was right, and they would
        work together to figure out how to survive the Iteration. In the past,
        the time was not ripe, but now that the World Tree was in his hands, he
        truly had the foundation to work together as an equal. This plan could
        also be officially put on the agenda.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        If he remembered correctly, there should still be a related mission in
        his interface.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Because of the World Tree's alchemy-like material transformation
        ability, he did not have to bother collecting the materials for the
        Sanctum Key in the future and could create a new key at any time. To
        him, most of the Sanctums were a backyard that he could enter as he
        wished, so he was not afraid of the three Universal Civilizations
        studying the Sanctum together. The other party did not have such a
        unique condition.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "This is really the case of overwhelming advantage…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Han Xiao was secretly overjoyed.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        With the World Tree Mechanism working together with the Sanctum, the
        benefits were unimaginable.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He inwardly decided that once the situation stabilized after the war, he
        would show his cards to the three Universal Civilizations and pull them
        to study the Sanctum together.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Rather than letting these people spend their energy on how to deal with
        them, it would be better to let them figure out how to deal with the
        problem of Iteration, lest they waste resources for internal conflicts.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">‘My actions will definitely move the Galaxy…!</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Han Xiao shook his head.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        For the sake of the peace of the universe, I am really giving it my all.
        It's not right for me not to receive a few tons of medals.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This time, Ames came over with a strange expression. "You've made a huge
        profit this time. The entire galactic society suffered heavy losses in
        the war, and trillions died in the war. In the end, you became the
        biggest beneficiary. What do you think?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "What? Are you trying to wake up my sense of shame? You've found the
        wrong person." Han Xiao shrugged and said calmly, "I ended the war early
        and saved countless lives. The dead are gone, and the living are still
        alive. What do I think? I have a clear conscience."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Ames spread out her hands. "Alright, there's nothing wrong with thinking
        this way. After this war, you will be extremely respected, so you won't
        be as busy as before, right? How about it, make some time to accompany
        me?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Han Xiao was tempted.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        But at this time, Jotina suddenly appeared and interrupted.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Lord Dragon Emperor, the Army Commander doesn't have that much free
        time. Don't keep pestering him. It will only make him troubled."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Hearing this, Ames raised her brows and looked over. Jotina did not back
        down and glared back. Their gazes met in midair, and the air was filled
        with the smell of gunpowder. Han Xiao felt a wave of killing intent, and
        his mouth could not help but twitch. He quickly flew to the side, not
        wanting to be involved in the battle between the two women.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The two of them glared at each other. One side was calm and dignified,
        while the other side was aggressive. There was a clear provocation in
        their eyes, and neither side backed down. No one cared about Han Xiao
        running away.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Sigh, it's all my fault for being too outstanding…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Han Xiao sighed helplessly.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He flew to the side alone and thought for a while before taking out the
        Heart Tree King's Spacetime Amber. After obtaining the World Tree, Han
        Xiao had completely understood the mechanisms of the Tree King and the
        Tree God. He realized that the Ancestral Tree King had left him a mess.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Beyonder's Vestiges were completely burned, the Crowns were
        completely destroyed, and their military strength was greatly depleted.
        The high-level combatants were almost completely wiped out, and the
        World Tree Civilization had suffered great losses. It would take many
        years for them to recover.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, Han Xiao did not mind. After all, if he had not beaten the
        enemy into such a miserable state, he would not have had the chance to
        subdue the World Tree.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, Han Xiao originally had an idea. If the timing and price were
        suitable, it was not impossible to sell Wuornos a Beyonder's Vestige in
        the future.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Now, he had no way to give it to Wuornos even if he wanted to. Wuornos
        had once again missed the opportunity to advance to the Transcendent
        Grade. Han Xiao could only say that it was destiny…
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Right now, the only undamaged Tree King Crown is on the Heart Tree
        King. This guy has become my only heir…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Han Xiao shook his head and laughed.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Although the members of the World Tree were brainwashed and loyal, they
        were not puppets without self-awareness. They had independent thoughts
        and had their own lives. His entry into the World Tree Civilization did
        not affect these things. In a way that was easy to understand, his
        control of the World Tree was equivalent to using his own will to
        replace the will of the mother tree. To the World Tree Civilization, the
        two had similar meanings.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Therefore, Han Xiao also needed to find someone to manage the World Tree
        Civilization. Due to the ‘waste' of the Ancestral Tree King, for a very
        long time, the World Tree would only have one Tree King qualification.
        The Heart Tree King was the best choice.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        With this in mind, Han Xiao did not hesitate and unsealed the Amber.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Pop!</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Heart Tree King broke free from the seal and retreated without
        another word. His body glowed, and he was about to self-destruct.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After being trapped in the Spacetime Amber for so many years, the Heart
        Tree King had always regretted not being decisive enough. He had told
        himself countless times that as long as there was a chance to unseal it,
        he would immediately free himself.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, just as he was about to self-destruct, the mental network of
        the World Tree connected to him again. The message that came made the
        Heart Tree King suddenly stop moving, and his expression became
        extremely shocked.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"The World Tree Civilization… lost ".</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He quickly received the information in his mental network and finally
        understood how the war had progressed while he had been sealed for all
        these years. "The Ancestral Tree King, the Secret Tree King, the
        Fortitude Tree King, and the Subduing Tree King… They all died, along
        with the Tree King Crowns. I became the Tree King that survived in the
        end…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Just like that, the World Tree Army, which was at its peak, was wiped
        out. His familiar comrades were all wiped out, and even the entire
        civilization belonged to someone else. They had a new master… After more
        than ten years, everything had changed. For a moment, the Heart Tree
        King was stunned on the spot. His heart was filled with complicated
        emotions.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao did not interfere with the Heart Tree King's acceptance of
        reality.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "I'm sure you already understand why I let you out. I need you to help
        me manage the World Tree Civilization. It might not be a bad thing for
        you. As long as you do a good job, you will be the only Tree King for a
        long period of time. I will not interfere too much with your management.
        You will only be below me and above all others."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Heart Tree King looked at Han Xiao with a complicated expression.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He did not expect that the moment he woke up, the culprit who had sealed
        him back then would become his boss. Due to the mind control of the
        World Tree, the Heart Tree King could not show any hostility toward Han
        Xiao. "…I understand. As you wish."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Heart Tree King sighed and lowered his head to agree. He had no
        right to refuse.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao nodded and clapped his hands. The Heart Tree King turned into a
        green stream of light and entered his body, returning to the mother tree
        world.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After doing this, Han Xiao looked back at the excited crowd and smiled.
        He did not participate but changed into King and disappeared.

      </h1>
      <p class="calibre3">
        While the Galactic Alliance Army was celebrating, the upper echelons of
        the Super Star Cluster Alliance were discussing the short confrontation
        between Han Xiao and the three Universal Civilizations, which gave them
        some excitement.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "External pressure was the adhesive for internal cracks. Now that the
        adhesive is gone, the rift between Black Star and the three Universal
        Civilizations will only grow larger. The conflict will happen sooner or
        later. However, unlike back then, the Beyond Grade A organizations are
        now like the sun in the sky, and they have also obtained the inheritance
        of the World Tree. The three Universal Civilizations can no longer
        restrain them."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">The leader of the Star Arc knocked on the table.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The upper echelons of the Super Star Cluster felt the same. They were
        gloating yet at the same time a little worried. "The galactic society
        might have won the war, but all the real benefits fell into Black Star's
        hands. Although the war has ended, it is only the beginning of the
        reshuffling of the galactic structure. The new structure will be formed
        in the chaos. A character like Black Star will not miss this
        opportunity. He has the reputation of a war hero, and the three
        Universal Civilizations cannot stop him at all… This will be the trend!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Now that Black Star has the World Tree, his organization will rapidly
        expand. He doesn't even need to form an alliance with us, and he can
        fight on par with the three Universal Civilizations. Will he still value
        our agreement?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "It should still be the case. The World Tree has suffered a huge loss,
        and Black Star might not be willing to turn hostile in the short term.
        It's definitely better to pull in external help than to do it alone.
        Furthermore, from his past actions, Black Star actually does not have
        the ambition to steal the ruling rights, nor does he have the intention
        to unite the entire Galaxy under him… Of course, the hearts of people
        are hard to predict, and this judgment might not be correct. It can only
        be used as a reference. On the other hand, the three Universal
        Civilizations have also suffered a huge loss, and they don't want to
        fall out with Black Star."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Sigh, I feel a little pessimistic. If there are no new external
        conflicts, Black Star and the three Universal Civilizations might have a
        battle in the future. From the perspective of the entire galactic
        society, we defeated the World Tree and obtained the spoils of war. This
        is our strongest period in history, but internal conflicts cannot be
        resolved. Are we going to die by our own strength?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Don't talk nonsense. The three Universal Civilizations aren't really
        headstrong. As long as Black Star doesn't have the intention to rule
        alone, the three Universal Civilizations will still give up their
        opposition under the threat of absolute strategic deterrence and accept
        Black Star as a member of the ruling circle. Having two supreme factions
        might be the new normal in the future."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        They carefully analyzed the possibilities of the future.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The leader of the Star Arc listened for a while and said, "Under such
        circumstances, we should find a new way to deal with ourselves. The
        original agreement was for us to work together with Black Star to fight
        against the three Universal Civilizations, but things are different now.
        The three Universal Civilizations need to rope us in to fight Black
        Star. It's not suitable for us to side with Black Star."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "You mean to cooperate with the three Universal Civilizations?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Of course not. What I mean is that we have to work together with both
        sides. The three Universal Civilizations will fight Black Star, and we
        will be a huge bargaining chip. The three Universal Civilizations won't
        treat us the way they did in the past, so the suppression will naturally
        be nullified. The tables have turned, and they will lower their heads
        and beg us to work together. This time, we can really use the proper way
        to obtain a chance to develop freely. Maybe the three Universal
        Civilizations still wish for us to become stronger… However, we have to
        make the situation into a new balance, so we can't easily side with
        either. Only competition can bring benefits. Monopolizing or
        dictatorship is not possible."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Hmm, that's true. Not to mention the three Universal Civilizations,
        Black Star is also a dangerous individual who represents individualism.
        If he ascends, he will definitely give the Supers more privileges, which
        will allow him to lead the galactic society. He might not even be as
        good as the three Universal Civilizations. Furthermore, he has the World
        Tree, so he's also a time bomb."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Suddenly, someone sighed and muttered,</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Black Star, oh Black Star… such a person is really too difficult to
        deal with. He's always seeking greater benefits and never relaxes. He's
        really someone who does big things. If the person leading the Beyond
        Grade As was not the way he is, the three Universal Civilizations might
        have suppressed them long ago. How could they have developed to this
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">stage?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Hearing this, everyone sighed. The image that Black Star had left for
        them was strong and ruthless, able to seize every opportunity to expand.
        Even if they did not consider his individual strength, they were still
        afraid of such a person. They could trust each other when they were
        teammates, but turning back into competitors was torture.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The news of the Galactic Alliance Army defeating the World Tree
        Civilization was temporarily locked down by the three Universal
        Civilizations and Han Xiao. They controlled the quantum network base
        station to filter out any information that might leak.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Since they were worried that it would be difficult to control the troops
        once they were disbanded, the victorious Galactic Alliance Army
        temporarily stayed in the secondary dimension to recuperate. Regarding
        this order, the various troops were still rather cooperative, but they
        could not stay on standby all the time. Thus, the plan to find the third
        party infiltrator required to be performed as quickly as possible. The
        players were not restricted at all. The ‘Galactic Alliance Army ending
        the war and Black Star subduing the World Tree' incident had already
        been recorded in Galaxy Chronicles and was extremely popular.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao's heroic act of uprooting the World Tree spread across all the
        forums. Although many players could not help but complain that they had
        watched another round of CG, they were still very happy to be able to
        participate in such a large event.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, the players were only active on the forums, and the news that
        was occasionally spread through the communicator had been intercepted.
        Therefore, the galactic society was completely unaware of the Galactic
        Alliance Army's victory.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The situation that countless galactic residents were aware of was the
        moment when the World Tree evacuated the invaders. They were still
        uncertain about this, and there were many different opinions online. As
        for the Star Alliance spies who could only gather intelligence from the
        public network, they naturally did not know about the World Tree
        Civilization's defeat. They were still patiently waiting for the World
        Tree Civilization's ‘big move', completely unaware of the impending
        disaster.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In the Central Galaxy, somewhere in the desolate universe belt, the
        secret base of the Star Alliance lurkers.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "I wonder what the World Tree is planning. It's been a long time since
        there's been any movement."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "I see that the Galactic Alliance Army is gathering in the Central
        Galaxy. The World Tree Civilization is probably going to attack the
        Central Galaxy."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "By the way, we are also in the Central Galaxy. Will we be affected?
        Should we evacuate?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Inside the base, a group of observers gathered together and whispered.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Observer Captain was a little hesitant and said, "The probability of
        the desolate universe belt being targeted by the World Tree is very low.
        No one has visited this place for many years, so it should be safe…
        However, the World Tree might also send people to infiltrate and build
        some strongholds. That way, we will also have the risk of being
        discovered by others…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "If we act rashly, we might get exposed. Other places might be more
        dangerous. Let's stay," one of the team members suggested. "…Alright
        then. If our base is really discovered, we'll start the self-destruct
        sequence and sacrifice ourselves."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">The Observer Captain's tone became solemn.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        These observers who had infiltrated the territories of the three
        Universal Civilizations were all carefully selected death warriors. In
        order to prevent any information leak about the Star Alliance if they
        got captured, they had long been prepared to commit suicide. The
        self-destruct device they buried was enough to blow up the entire planet
        and erase all traces.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "You guys continue to pay attention to the news. I'll go sort out the
        intelligence for this week and send it to my hometown in a few days."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Observer Captain stood up and was about to leave the room.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Ding!</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, all of a sudden, everyone's movements froze, as if time had
        stopped.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        A certain area in the room rippled, and Han Xiao walked out.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Hehe, it's the Lorese. It's exactly the same as the visions given in
        the Explorer. Looks like I found the right one."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao looked at the Observer Captain, and his eyes sparkled.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In order to prevent any accidents from happening, after he returned to
        the main universe, he directly consumed the materials and used the
        Virtual World to create a temporary Information Form Warning Network. He
        quickly completed the installation and set the parameters before
        activating it.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        If he had not used that, he would still have been left in the dark. Once
        he used it, he received a shock. The information state alert network
        gave him a lot of abnormal signals. He had the impression that the
        entire explored universe was like a sieve being spied on by countless
        enemies, and he was shocked. After some adjustments, he finally
        understood that this technology was used in a normal civilization, and
        it was very easy to churn out false reports. Since the World Tree
        Civilization existed as a single entity, there was no such problem. This
        was the difference in technology. The World Tree Special Express was a
        perfect match for this Information Form Warning Network. Although the
        three Universal Civilizations did not have such mobility, the
        Multi-Dimensional Sky Opening Transportation Device could be used as a
        replacement, so Han Xiao did not waste too much time traveling.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After some selection and adjustments, he removed most of the false
        reports and confirmed some real external signals, most of which were
        from secondary dimension life forms.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao visited a few signal areas and only now arrived at the base of
        the Star Alliance's infiltrators. He immediately confirmed that this was
        the real mastermind. The process was much smoother than he had expected.
        He had controlled the entire base and all the enemies before he even
        appeared.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Let me see your background."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao's eyes lit up, and the shadow of the World Tree appeared behind
        him.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As the World Tree merged into the space, it was stained with Han Xiao's
        energy, and the entire tree turned into a bright blue electric arc. A
        few translucent roots shot out like electric whips and penetrated
        everyone's chests.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The next moment, the figures of these observers turned illusory at a
        speed visible to the naked eye, and waves of energy entered Han Xiao's
        body through the roots.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        With the World Tree in his hands, Han Xiao had no intention of
        interrogating these people. As long as he could turn these spies into
        members of the World Tree, he would be able to obtain all the
        intelligence from their memories and turn them into ‘guides', imitating
        the methods of the World Tree.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Not long after, these Star Alliance observers fused into the roots. Han
        Xiao snapped his fingers, and a few roots arched their bodies like
        snakes. With a puff, they spewed out a large number of lightning sparks,
        reforming their bodies.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao narrowed his eyes and received the memories of these people.
        There was a lot of information about the Star Alliance inside.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "So that's what happened. The Star Alliance has been hiding for many
        years… Hmm, this civilization doesn't seem to be that strong."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Han Xiao pondered.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The third party had already been found, but they still had to discuss
        with the three Universal Civilizations how to deal with it. They had to
        see if they could destroy the Star Alliance or merge them into the
        explored universe. After all, although the Star Alliance was not strong,
        they had reached the standard of a Universal Civilization. The three
        Universal Civilizations had already suffered heavy losses, and they
        still had to consider the cost of starting another war. The three
        Universal Civilizations had been the targets of the invasion before, but
        now that they had the chance, they definitely did not mind changing
        their roles seamlessly and turning into the invaders. After all, the
        Star Alliance was the one who had plotted against them, so they could
        not be considered innocent. The damage caused by the World Tree's full
        invasion could naturally be blamed on the Star Alliance.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao withdrew his thoughts and sized up a Planetary Alliance spy.
        "Continue hiding and maintain contact with the Star Alliance. Don't do
        anything without my orders."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Understood. We will do our best to help you steal the intelligence of
        the Star Alliance!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Many of the lurkers turned into fanatics.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "…Sigh, with the World Tree mechanism, who would believe that the user
        is not a villain?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Seeing how passionate these former Star Alliance loyalists were about
        dealing with the Star Alliance, Han Xiao felt strange. He shook his head
        and disappeared.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Not long after, in the joint office of the three Universal
        Civilizations, Han Xiao brought the news of the third party being
        captured. "You're right. There really is a third party interfering, and
        they've been hiding for so long. If not for the Information Form Warning
        Network, we wouldn't have found them…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As Marbruce and the other two looked at the information that Han Xiao
        had brought, their expressions kept changing. Sometimes, they were
        angry, and sometimes, they were glad. With the evidence before them,
        they basically believed that the mole was not from the Super Star
        Cluster or any other ally. After browsing through the information of the
        Star Alliance, the three of them discussed for a while and came to a
        consensus.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "The Star Alliance is very far away from us, but once we obtain the
        spatial coordinates, we can use the Multi-Dimensional Sky Opening
        Transportation Device to send our troops over, just like how the World
        Tree Civilization was dealing with us. Therefore, we have the
        initiative… We are inclined to destroy the Star Alliance and take it as
        our vassal. However, we should hold back for now. We have just
        experienced war, and we still need some time to recuperate." Han Xiao
        raised his brows. "How long are you planning to rest?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Louis pondered and said, "It depends on the situation… However, time is
        on our side. Although the news of defeating the World Tree Civilization
        can't be sealed forever, you have already controlled the spies of the
        Star Alliance. You can make use of them to send fake intelligence and
        fabricate the battle situation, making the Star Alliance think that we
        are still fighting the World Tree Civilization."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "The prerequisite is that the Star Alliance does not have any other
        methods to monitor the galactic society…" Han Xiao paused for a moment
        and spread out his hands." However, with the Information Form Warning
        Network, this possibility can be eliminated."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "In any case, try not to alert the enemy," Marbruce said with a deep
        voice. Han Xiao nodded and suddenly commented.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "The association and I will not accompany you in the battle of invading
        the Star Alliance. You can deal with them yourselves. I'm only
        responsible for these spies."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The eyes of the three of them flashed, but they did not say anything
        immediately. They quickly analyzed the situation in their minds and felt
        that there were pros and cons.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In this World Tree War, the three Universal Civilizations did not gain
        anything in the first place. The World Tree Civilization had been taken
        away by Black Star, and they did not even have the slightest bit of
        technology or resources. If they could swallow the Star Alliance, they
        would be able to reap some benefits.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Since Black Star was not participating in the battle, he would not share
        the spoils of war. Han Xiao had the World Tree, and he was the best at
        snatching resources. The three of them had to be wary of him.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Without the help of the Beyond Grade A Association, the war would be a
        little more troublesome. However, the three Universal Civilizations were
        not to be trifled with. They could not defeat the World Tree, but the
        same could not be said for the Star Alliance.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, the three of them were worried that Black Star or the Super
        Star Cluster would try to assassinate them while they were at war with
        the Star Alliance. It was very risky… Who knew if Black Star had such
        plans?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        For a moment, the three of them were caught in a dilemma and did not
        know if this was a
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">trap.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao glanced at them and guessed their thoughts. He pursed his lips.
        He had only helped the three Universal Civilizations because he had been
        thinking about the calamities in his previous life and wanted to resist
        the World Tree.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Do you still expect me to help the three Universal Civilizations expand
        their territory?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        It's already good enough that I didn't replace you. Be content, little
        brother!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Now that the threat was finally resolved, the galactic society could
        enjoy many years of peace. Han Xiao was satisfied.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Ever since his arrival, the World Tree had been the sword of Damocles in
        Han Xiao's eyes. It was the biggest psychological shadow and the source
        of his anxiety. For a very long time, he could only keep this secret
        alone and work hard to get rid of it. He did not dare relax, and the
        pressure was difficult to speak of to others.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After persevering for more than a hundred years, he had finally removed
        the threat of the galactic society. He no longer had to worry about the
        safety of his friends. He was relieved and wanted to retire and truly
        relax for some time.
      </p>

      </h1>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The three Universal Civilizations were finally relieved after the Star
        Alliance's infiltrators were captured. They quickly returned to the
        fleet and no longer blocked the news.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Very soon, the explosive news of the Galactic Alliance Army destroying
        the World Tree Civilization spread throughout the entire galactic
        society in the shortest time possible. Countless galactic residents on
        the refugee planets were shocked.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Not long ago, we were still in a passive state, enduring the full
        invasion of the enemy. Our future was filled with pessimism, and we were
        in a constant state of panic. However, before we were even mentally
        prepared, the tables turned in the blink of an eye. Suddenly, they told
        us that the war had ended, and everyone was safe… Brother, we just woke
        up, we haven't even brushed our teeth!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">The galactic residents were stunned.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, as the official media of the three Universal Civilizations
        revealed the entire process of the war and confirmed that this was not a
        rumor, the entire galactic society finally recovered from the shock and
        only felt endless joy.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Under the shadow of the World Tree Civilization, the entire galactic
        society had been forced to change its way of operation, disrupting
        everyone's lives. Countless people turned from free and casual galactic
        residents into refugees avoiding the flames of war. The wartime policies
        had tightened the resource supply and livelihood rights of the people,
        and the difference was huge. This change had lasted for almost twenty
        years. From the perspective of a civilization or a high-level Super,
        twenty years was just a short time. It was just a small wave in the
        river of time, but to ordinary galactic residents, this was almost a
        generation.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Any change in the era would be amplified on the individual. In the past,
        the three Universal Civilizations and the World Tree Civilization were
        in a stalemate, and no one could see the bright future of the war.
        Countless galactic residents pessimistically thought that this kind of
        life would continue forever, and tomorrow would not be any better. At
        least two or three more generations would have to suffer in the flames
        of war.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, at this moment, the light of dawn tore through the dense fog
        and shone into everyone's lives. This beam of light came from the
        countless soldiers who had sacrificed themselves at the frontline, from
        Black Star, who had single-handedly turned the situation around.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        On the 17th of April, year 799 of the Galaxy Calendar, different races
        on countless planets were cheering in different languages.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Countless galactic residents called this day the ‘turning point of
        time', representing the end of the war and the destruction of the World
        Tree.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As the victors, the three Universal Civilizations received the praise of
        the entire galactic society. In the promotion, the three Universal
        Civilizations did not cover up Black Star's achievements:
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Before the war broke out, he had been maintaining internal checks and
        balances to reduce internal conflicts. In the early stages of the war,
        he had led a group of Beyond Grade As to defend against the foreign
        enemies without any hesitation, and he had also personally taken the
        risk to gather crucial intelligence about the World Tree. During the
        preparation stage, he had been training the seeds of potential and
        nurtured a new batch of Beyond Grade As. One man stood alone in the
        shallow layer dimension, preventing the World Tree Civilization from
        advancing and forcing them to give up the battlefront that was the most
        dangerous to the three Universal Civilizations. He had found the World
        Tree's main body first, forcing the World Tree to give up the invasion,
        and single-handedly lifted the curtains of the final battle, turning the
        long-term war into the final battle…
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        With so many achievements, Black Star's glory in the war could not be
        concealed at all. His presence was extremely strong, and countless
        galactic residents recounted Black Star's contributions in detail. The
        reverence that gushed out from their hearts was like a warm current that
        warmed the hearts, and it was like an uncontrollable soul trembling,
        penetrating every bone and nerve.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Although this was a little unfair to the normal soldiers who had
        sacrificed themselves at the frontline, after seeing Black Star's deeds
        from start to finish, many galactic residents felt that the pace of the
        entire war was controlled by Black Star. He adjusted the general
        direction of the war, and the Galactic Alliance Army was more like a
        ‘tool' that only carried out his will.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Because of the huge contributions, Black Star became the recognized
        ‘Chief War Hero' of the galactic society. His reputation skyrocketed,
        exceeding all the previous records. He was truly like the sun in the
        sky, gaining the respect of the entire galactic society and receiving
        fanatical support.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As for the Beyond Grade As, they also received a large amount of
        reputation and received countless praises. This was especially so for
        the ‘sacrificed victims' on the Soul Comfort Monument, who received more
        respect and became more popular.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Before the World Tree War broke out, Beyond Grade As were regarded as
        the privileged class of the galactic society, and they had been hated by
        many galactic residents. However, these Beyond Grade As fought a bloody
        battle and protected their safety, and the galactic residents were
        sincerely grateful.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Due to the wartime policies, most of the population of the various Star
        Fields had been concentrated on different planets. Now that the flames
        of war had been extinguished, the three Universal Civilizations had also
        begun to relocate batches of refugees, slowly leaving the wartime state
        and returning to normal society.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Central Galaxy, Planet Aquamarine.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In the huge open-air landing field, teams of spaceships with the Black
        Star Army insignia were parked neatly. The doors of the spaceships
        opened, and the people of Planet Aquamarine lined up in a long line.
        Following the orders of the army members, they stepped onto the
        starships that were returning home one after another.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The constant fear and anxiety made everyone look haggard and tired, but
        it could not hide the smiles and relaxation on their faces. They were
        full of hope for a beautiful tomorrow.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In the office of the government building, the white-haired and wrinkly
        Bennett stood in front of the floor-to-ceiling window. He looked down at
        the dense crowd in the square and saw the tired and excited expressions
        of the Planet Aquamarine citizens.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Only time can heal the wounds of war…"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As he spoke, Bennett turned around and looked at the statue of Black
        Star, which was the city's landmark, with a gratified look in his eyes.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Black Star… you really did it. I knew I could always trust you."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Bennett smiled as though he was relieved of a burden.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He was already indifferent to many things, but he was still proud of
        having an old friend like Black Star.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At the same time, in the Floating Dragon Island above this planet.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        A spaceship slowly entered the dock, and the hatch slowly opened.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Harrison walked out of the spaceship and stepped onto the platform. His
        eyes immediately locked onto Jenny, who was waiting for him.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As their gazes met, everything around them seemed to turn into
        nothingness. They only had each other in their eyes, as if a lifetime
        had passed since they met.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Harrison strode forward and kissed Jenny's shiny forehead before pulling
        her into his arms.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Jenny only struggled for a moment before hugging Harrison's back and
        whispering, "You still know to come back?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"…Sorry, I had a reason to leave. I…"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Alright, I'm not blaming you." Jenny interrupted him and said, "I'm
        just thanking Black Star. If he had not found the World Tree's main body
        and completed what you wanted to do, you would never have returned."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Indeed." Harrison released Jenny and scratched his head in
        embarrassment.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Jenny glared at him and said, "Speaking of which, you've also reached
        the top in a single step. Now that you've got me, you're in-laws with
        Black Star. Although I don't get along with Black Star, I can't deny
        that he's already standing at the top of the universe. With him as your
        backer, you can do whatever you want in the future."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"This…" Harrison was a little embarrassed.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Jenny snorted, lowered her head, and touched her lower abdomen. Then,
        she raised her fist and pretended to be fierce. "You have to treat me
        better in the future, okay? Otherwise, my sister and my brother-in-law
        will find you and beat you up. See if you can take it!" Harrison
        shuddered.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Although he was not dating Jenny because of her identity, he could not
        help but break out in cold sweat at the thought of the two Gods in
        Jenny's family.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Harrison felt that the more he talked about this, the more dangerous it
        became. He quickly changed the topic, coughed, and asked, "Erm, I'll be
        staying on Floating Dragon Island from now on."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, Jenny rejected it and shook her head. "There's no need to stay
        on Floating Dragon Island. I plan to resign from the Chief Supervisor
        position of the Floating Dragon." Harrison was shocked. "What's the
        matter?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "I've worked overtime for so many years, and I'm already tired. Ames
        won't manage it, and I was worried before. Now that she's together with
        Black Star, she doesn't need my help anymore."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Jenny's tone was complicated. She was still dissatisfied with Han Xiao,
        who snatched her sister away, but it was not her turn to object.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As she spoke, Jenny paused for a moment, looked directly at Harrison,
        and said in a soft and shy tone, "Plus, I know that you like to explore.
        I hope that you and I will be happy together. I can't stop you from
        pursuing your hobbies just because we're together. So… can you take me
        out to explore in the future?" Harrison was stunned. Then, he was
        overjoyed.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"You're so good to me…"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He looked at Jenny's face, and his heart palpitated. He could not help
        but slowly move closer to her. Jenny's face turned red, and she slowly
        closed her eyes.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Just as the two of them were about to touch each other, a deliberate
        cough sounded beside them.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Ahem!"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Like a sudden clap of thunder, the ambiguous atmosphere was instantly
        broken. The two of them snapped out of it as if they had just woken up
        from a dream. Both their faces turned red, and they quickly looked in
        the direction of the sound. Aesop had appeared beside them at some point
        in time, and his eyes were on them.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "When did you arrive? You're already so old, don't you know not to
        disturb others!" Jenny was furious and embarrassed, so she fired first.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Aesop could not be bothered with her. He walked over to Harrison, sized
        him up, and smiled. He patted Harrison's shoulder with great force,
        feeling extremely gratified.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Good lad, you're much more reliable than that bastard Black Star."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Harrison, however, knew Aesop. He smiled bitterly and said, "Don't make
        fun of me. How can I be compared to Lord Black Star?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Heh, why can't you compete? At least in terms of reproduction, you've
        already beaten him by one step. If he had half your skills, I would have
        gotten a grandson a long time ago. Black Star is clearly a greenhorn
        himself, but he still acts like he's very strong. I wanted to impart him
        some experience out of kindness, but he actually shunned me." Aesop was
        furious when he said this.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Harrison did not know what to say, so he said helplessly, "Stop fooling
        around. Black Star is someone who does big things. Why would he waste
        his energy on such a small matter…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Hmm? Small matter?" Jenny's ears twitched, and she caught the keyword.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Oh no, that's not what I meant. I…"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Before Harrison could finish, Aesop grabbed his neck and pulled him
        down.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "I think you're much more pleasing to the eye than Black Star. Let's go,
        I'll teach you a few moves. I guarantee that you'll be able to subdue
        Jenny…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Get out of here. Don't disgust me." Jenny gave Aesop a kick and dragged
        Harrison away.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">In the unexplored universe, Star Alliance capital.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In the office, the leader of the Lore Civilization and the other leaders
        of the Star Alliance gathered together. A virtual screen was suspended
        in front of each of them, showing the same information.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "The Observer team has sent this period's battle report. Have you all
        read it?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The leader of the Star Alliance looked at everyone and asked.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Savignes nodded and said with a smile, "I finished reading it right
        away. It seems like the three Universal Civilizations won't be able to
        hold on under our influence."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Hearing this, many people smiled.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The leader of the Star Alliance smiled and lowered his head to read the
        information.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "The World Tree Army attacked the Central Galaxy and focused on
        destroying the refugee planets, causing all the refugees on the 1,783
        planets to be sacrificed. The civilian casualties are estimated to be
        between 15 trillion and 25 trillion…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "The Federation of Light's mother planet was attacked by a large force
        of the World Tree, and the defense forces managed to repel the invaders.
        However, the mother planet was severely damaged. Although the upper
        echelons were unharmed, many of the middle-ranked officials and
        important people died."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "The Galactic Alliance Army and the World Tree invaders fought a battle
        at Silver Arm but were ambushed. Eight Beyond Grade As died on the
        spot."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Due to the disadvantage of the battle and the suspicion of being spies,
        the Super Star Cluster Alliance carried out the evacuation plan and did
        not want to participate in the battle. The three Universal Civilizations
        strongly opposed it, causing internal unrest in the Galactic Alliance
        Army. It seems like they have broken
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">up…"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Although he had already read it once, after listening to the leader of
        the Star Alliance read it, he could not help but smile with joy, his
        heart filled with the joy of revenge.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Finally, the leader of the Star Alliance read through the ‘intense
        battle' that Han Xiao had made up. He paused for a moment and said with
        a relaxed tone,
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "It can be seen that the battle between the three Universal
        Civilizations and the World Tree Civilization is extremely tragic.
        Furthermore, the Super Star Cluster Alliance was plotted against by us
        and was mistaken as a traitor who leaked the information. With both
        internal and external threats, the three Universal Civilizations will
        definitely lose if this continues!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As soon as he said that, many of the people present smiled gloatingly.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Some of the Star Alliance members who did not support the plan were
        silent.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After reading this report, everyone came to a conclusion&mdash;the three
        Universal Civilizations were definitely living in the depths of hell and
        were heading to their end!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">This was a sure win!</p>

      <p class="calibre3">
        Somewhere in the explored universe, the Avengers' fleet was slowly
        moving.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Inside the cabin, Pangon and the others were watching the news of the
        three Universal Civilizations' victory on the virtual screen.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Looking at the countless galactic races in the image, the Beyond Grade
        As present had complicated expressions.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Humph, the three Universal Civilizations became the winners, and the
        galactic society escaped the calamity. Pangon, are you satisfied now?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        A Beyond Grade A stood with his arms crossed, his tone dissatisfied.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Pangon was expressionless. "There's nothing to be happy about."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Is that so? But why do I feel like you don't mean what you say? Don't
        forget what our goal is! To be honest, if you have given up on revenge,
        you'd better disband early," another person said coldly.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This group of people had been planning to take revenge on the three
        Universal Civilizations, and the galactic society was celebrating their
        victory. Of course, they could not be happy. They only felt frustrated.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Facing Pangon, who did not have a firm stand, everyone naturally did not
        have a good expression.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Pangon remained unmoved and said calmly, "If you have the time to talk
        nonsense, you might as well think about our next move."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "You still have the face to say that? This war was clearly a very good
        opportunity for revenge. If not for you not allowing us to cause
        trouble, we would have long…" "We were beaten to death by Black Star
        long ago." Pangon cut him off and slowly said, "Judging from the current
        situation, the conclusion is that even if we had caused trouble, we
        wouldn't have been able to change the outcome of the three Universal
        Civilizations' victory. This is because the key factor that determined
        the war wouldn't have been affected by us at all… Therefore, if we had
        taken advantage of the war, the outcome now would have been our
        annihilation. You all should be glad that I saved our lives."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Hearing this, everyone was frustrated. Every time they talked about this
        topic, Pangon would use similar reasons to convince them, and it was not
        easy to refute.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Right at this moment, Pangon suddenly changed the topic and said, "Don't
        you guys think that this new internal conflict is the best environment
        for us to develop? The reason why I didn't agree to create trouble in
        the war is because of this. If the three Universal Civilizations lose,
        we won't have to do anything. But since they won, they will form a new
        balance with the Beyond Grade A Association and the Super Star Cluster
        Alliance, and we will have more room to maneuver…
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        That's why I've always emphasized that we have to have the foresight to
        foresee the changes in the future. We can't just look for a chance."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Pangon spoke calmly.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Everyone had strange expressions.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This sentence sounded right, but coming from a Pugilist, it felt weird…
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After taking one last look at the galactic refugees on the news, Pangon
        turned around and left the room.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        When he turned around, the corners of his mouth curled up slightly but
        then disappeared. He said calmly,
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Stop looking. Let's go. Their joy has nothing to do with us."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The migration of refugees from the various Star Fields was going on like
        wildfire, but one day, explosive news once again caused a huge shock in
        the galactic society.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        On this day, the Beyond Grade A Association officially announced the
        establishment of a civilization regime called the ‘Supers Holy Land'.
        The civil nature association was promoted to be the Civilization's
        Elders Association. All the Beyond Grade As in the association were
        members of the Elders Association, and some of them with Black Star as
        the leader were the main decision-makers.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The nature of the civilization was the nation of immigrants that was
        common in the galactic society. It expressed that it would publicly
        accept all Supers with good credibility as citizens of the Supers Holy
        Land, regardless of race. Its slogan was ‘Building a Resplendent Nation
        Exclusively for Supers'. The Beyond Grade As were the leaders of the
        Supers, and like the wind vane, it was enough to guide a portion of the
        Supers to join the alliance. Furthermore, Black Star, the only
        Transcendent, had even more appeal to the Supers.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Of course, there were more substantial benefits. As long as one became a
        citizen of the Supers Holy Land, they could obtain the Super knowledge
        of the various classes through official channels and apply for
        customized training programs to help raise their level. In addition,
        official citizens could also choose to enjoy the protection of the
        Underworld. If they were unlucky and died or died of old age, they could
        choose to continue living as Hero Spirits. If they advanced to Beyond
        Grade A, they could directly enter the Elders Association and enjoy the
        Sanctum Revival for free.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Other than that, there were also various detailed rules and regulations,
        as well as terms of civil rights. They were jointly created by the
        professionals of the various Beyond Grade A organizations, and they
        referenced the systems of many galactic civilizations and made adaptive
        changes.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The location of the Supers Holy Land was in the Flickering World,
        occupying almost half of the territory. There were also some Star
        Clusters that had yet to be explored, located at the outermost edge of
        the explored universe. However, this was not the only territory. The
        desolate universe belt outside the Flickering World border was also
        included in the Supers Holy Land's territory.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The World Tree's ‘regurgitation ‘mechanism had to be mentioned here. It
        could transform countless planets, and the barren area could also be
        transformed into a prosperous Star Field. Therefore, the Supers Holy
        Land could be said to have obtained a territory that could continuously
        expand outward and was not restricted.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The first batch of citizens was from the various Beyond Grade A races or
        civilizations under their jurisdiction. They were currently migrating
        over, and the members of the various Beyond Grade A organizations were
        the first to enjoy the benefits. As long as they were willing, they
        could obtain the identity of a Supers Holy Land citizen. If they were
        not willing, they would not be forced. These people built the framework
        of the Supers Holy Land.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This was clearly taking advantage of the entire universe, and any
        civilization would face the risk of losing their Supers. However, the
        three Universal Civilizations did not stand out to oppose it. Instead,
        they sent a congratulatory message, congratulating the establishment of
        the Supers Holy Land in the name of the Galaxy Central Civilization
        Court and accepting the Supers Holy Land as a new member of the
        Civilization Council.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Both sides had reached an agreement a long time ago-the Beyond Grade A
        Association would obtain the status of civilization after the war. The
        three Universal Civilizations had already contacted Han Xiao during this
        period of time, and even if they were unwilling, they had no choice but
        to fulfill the agreement. Among them, half of the Flickering World and
        many Beyond Grade A races had successfully migrated, which was all the
        benefits that Han Xiao had obtained. The three Universal Civilizations
        had many concerns, but they still agreed.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Before the joy of winning the war faded, the galactic residents had a
        new topic. The birth of the Supers Holy Land attracted the heated
        discussion of the entire galactic society.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Although many galactic residents had guessed that the Beyond Grade A
        Association would make a big move after the battle, due to the lack of
        information, they had not expected the Beyond Grade A Association to
        make a move so quickly.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Not only the ordinary people, but the entire Super class was shocked!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The attraction of the Supers Holy Land to the Super classes far exceeded
        that of any civilization. Just the benefits of the Underworld and the
        Sanctum Revival alone were enough to move countless people. In addition,
        there was also free public knowledge and free training
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After enjoying the taste of superpowers, it was basically impossible for
        them to be satisfied with the current situation. Most Supers had the
        ambition to improve their own level. The treatment of the Supers Holy
        Land was enviable, and they did not have obligations like when joining a
        Beyond Grade A organization. Although the Supers had special privileges
        in the galactic society, they also had all kinds of concerns. Under the
        tacit understanding of the advanced civilizations, many low and
        middle-grade Supers had to sell their lives for all kinds of resources
        and knowledge. This was one of the ways for the advanced civilizations
        to maintain the balance so that the Supers would not become unstable
        factors of Galactic Society.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Now that the Supers Holy Land had shouted the slogan of ‘building the
        holy land of Supers', it caused a huge commotion. The Supers no longer
        hesitated and immediately joined the alliance.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Before the World Tree War, they might have been afraid of the authority
        of the three Universal Civilizations, afraid that they would no longer
        be able to live in the galactic society. Just like how the three
        Universal Civilizations had suppressed the Beyond Grade A Association
        back then, many people did not dare join the Beyond Grade A
        organizations. Now that the political position of the Beyond Grade A
        Supers Holy Land had been recognized, Black Star was no longer the
        ordinary Beyond Grade A Super.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Everyone could see that the Supers Holy Land and the three Universal
        Civilizations had reached the same level, and it was impossible for the
        same thing to happen again. Therefore, many Supers no longer had any
        concerns. Even if the galactic society banned them, they could just live
        in the Supers Holy Land in the future, what was there to be afraid of!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">At the border of the Flickering World.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao was floating in the desolate universe belt, and the power of
        the World Tree was flickering with electric arcs all over his body.
        Facing the dark space, he waved his hands rhythmically, as if he was
        playing a symphony.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Under his command, roots tore through space and slowly took root. At the
        same time, the ends of the roots seemed to spout bubbles as they
        scattered the transformed planets in the galaxy to expand the territory
        of the Supers Holy Land. Behind him, a group of Beyond Grade As were
        watching the scene of changing stars with shock.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        No matter how many times they watched this scene, they were still
        shocked and awed.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After a while, Han Xiao finally finished modifying this area. He
        retrieved the power of the World Tree, turned around, and flew in front
        of everyone.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Maintain this large territory for now. It should be enough."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "As long as you're happy…" Everyone had mixed feelings and did not know
        what to say.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao turned to look at Aurora and asked, "What does the galactic
        society think of the Supers Holy Land?".
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "About one hundred and twenty billion Supers have applied to become a
        Supers Holy Land citizen, and this number is still rising rapidly,"
        Aurora said. "It's a little small, but it's just the beginning. Many
        people are still hesitating. When we completely stabilize, the
        population will skyrocket."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Han Xiao nodded casually.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        During this period of time, he had been going everywhere, meeting with
        the leaders of the various organizations, reaching a consensus, and
        finally establishing the Supers Holy Land.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Establishing a civilization was very cumbersome, and all kinds of
        structures needed to be perfected. However, Han Xiao only needed to
        control the general direction and simple diplomacy. The details were
        filled in by the professional subordinates of the various Beyond Grade A
        organizations.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Because of the general trend, even the three Universal Civilizations did
        not make things difficult for him anymore. The creation of the Supers
        Holy Land was even smoother than Han Xiao had expected.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        From now on, the Beyond Grade As were officially united, and they would
        be able to move around in the universe under the banner of the Supers
        Holy Land. The structure of the galactic society had truly become
        three-way. Han Xiao had fulfilled his promise to the Beyond Grade A
        Association.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Many Beyond Grade As became the upper echelons of the Elders Association
        in the Supers Holy Land. Among them, Aurora was promoted to be Han
        Xiao's assistant and replaced Kasuyi's position. This personnel change
        received everyone's approval. In the entire Beyond Grade A group, only
        Aurora could convince the masses.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This was also Kasuyi's intention. He had originally planned to explore
        the unknown universe after the battle, and Han Xiao had also changed his
        position according to his request. Because Oathkeeper was traveling with
        Kasuyi, the Holy Accord was also empty, so Han Xiao made Beiger the
        acting leader of the Holy Accord and took over the job from Oathkeeper.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Beiger, on the other hand, did not mind being a mascot-like acting
        leader. However, Han Xiao did not really care about the Holy Accord
        anymore.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Now that he had obtained the World Tree that could convert resources, he
        no longer needed the Holy Accord organization to help him collect the
        Sanctum Keys. His main goal was to fulfill his previous promise and
        leave a place for the Beyond Grade As who wanted to retire.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao turned around and looked at Psyker who was hiding in the crowd.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "The one with seven eyes. Haven't you always wanted to relocate your
        race? Move your Star Pupil Civilization to the Supers Holy Land. No one
        will suppress you here."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Really? I don't believe it."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Psyker had strong doubts.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Even today, his Black Star PTSD had yet to be cured, and he felt that
        Han Xiao was up to no good.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Han Xiao rolled his eyes and ignored him.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At this moment, Hilbert walked out of the crowd with a group of revivors
        and said with a smile,
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Black Star, I wonder if the Supers Holy Land-realm welcomes our
        joining?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Hilbert had always had the thought of leaving the three Universal
        Civilizations to join the Beyond Grade A Association. Now that the war
        was over and the Beyond Grade A Civilization was established, he had
        finally made up his mind. He brought along some of the direct descent
        Revivors who also felt that they did not owe the three Universal
        Civilizations anything; their motive was naturally the unlimited Sanctum
        Revival guarantee.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Seeing this, Han Xiao smiled.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "The three Universal Civilizations are even more furious now. If you
        make such a choice, it might invalidate the ‘retirement benefits' that
        you gave up your lives for. Are you sure you want to do that?" "It
        doesn't matter. We've all died for the three Universal Civilizations. We
        don't owe them anything anymore. It's time to live for ourselves."
        Hilbert smiled.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "In that case, the Supers Holy Land welcomes all of you."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Han Xiao nodded.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        According to this trend, the future Supers Holy Land might really be
        able to get all the individual strengths in the universe.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At that time, the Supers Holy Land would become the sanctuary that all
        the Super classes yearned for. Almost all the civilian Supers who had
        awakened naturally would gather there, and the other civilizations would
        only have the Supers that were cultivated by the direct descendants.
        From another perspective, this would also increase the security of the
        galactic society, helping the various civilizations to consolidate their
        rule, and creating a more stable environment for the galactic residents.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Sigh, as expected, I still have peace in my heart. The three Universal
        Civilizations don't understand me.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Han Xiao shook his head and sighed.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-1445">

        Chapter 1446: Handing Over Positions and Farming Authority<span

      </h1>
      <p class="calibre3">
        There were only a few direct descent Revivors who chose to join the
        Supers Holy Land, and most of them chose to stay in the three Universal
        Civilizations. Even so, the difference between the high-level combatants
        on both sides was still quite large.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, Han Xiao was no longer afraid of openly poaching from the three
        Universal Civilizations. Ever since he subdued the World Tree to end the
        war, many problems that he had been facing had been solved. For example,
        the three Universal Civilizations had never given in to the Ultimate
        Knowledge Transmission right.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "The three Universal Civilizations knew that they would not be able to
        stop the Supers Holy Land from becoming a sanctuary of individual
        strength, so they compromised with me in the end…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao's eyes swept past everyone and suddenly locked onto Karlot,
        Evans, and the other new Beyond Grade As.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Karlot and Evans' potential did not need to be strengthened, and their
        futures were naturally limitless. However, because the World Tree War
        broke out many years earlier than in his previous life, they did not
        have enough time to grow. Even with his nurturing, it was not easy to
        make up for the lost time, and they were far from reaching the
        theoretical peak of their ability.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Therefore, in this war, the two of them did not perform too well, but it
        was undeniable that they would still be extremely valuable in the
        future.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In Han Xiao's opinion, since the Beyond Grade As had shouted the slogan
        of ‘Holy Land of the Supers', they had to have new injections of Supers,
        and they could not let the production of Supers stop. Although the
        current peak Beyond Grade As had a long lifespan and were distinguished,
        it would not do if there were no new generations of experts. They had to
        let the galactic society see the ‘individual strength nurturing ability'
        of the Supers Holy Land that exceeded any organization.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Although there might not be any chance for Han Xiao to make a move in
        the future, he still needed a new generation to hold the fort for the
        Supers Holy Land. Han Xiao had already treated Karlot and Evans as his
        right-hand men and the future pillars of the Supers Holy Land.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The construction of the territory was completed. Secret Master and the
        other Mages summoned the transportation door and sent everyone back to
        the main planet of the Supers Holy Land.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The main planet of the Supers Holy Land was called ‘Planet of the
        Deities'. It was located at the back of the Flickering World and had
        statues of all the Beyond Grade As of the Civilization's Elders
        Association. Black Star's statue was the most eye-catching and was the
        landmark of the entire planet.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Countless spaceships gathered on this planet from all directions,
        leaving behind streams of light like a bright galaxy. These were the
        various Supers who had chosen to join the Supers Holy Land and came to
        pay their respects to the statues of the various Beyond Grade As.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This area was originally a defensive area built by the Galactic Alliance
        Army, but after the war, all the troops stationed here left, and this
        area had a new owner. Every Beyond Grade A had their own residence here.
        After returning, they left to do their own things. Now was the time to
        migrate their forces to the Supers Holy Land, and most Beyond Grade As
        were very busy. Han Xiao returned to his office. Aurora, Hila, Feidin,
        and the others from the Black Star Army followed him for a small
        meeting.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "The framework of the Supers Holy Land has already been built. All
        that's left is to fill it up. There are some personnel changes that I
        need to explain to everyone." As he spoke, Han Xiao looked at everyone,
        his gaze landing on Nero.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "As the highest leader of the Supers Holy Land, it's not suitable for me
        to continue leading the Black Star Army. Nero, I'll leave the army to
        you for the time being."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Hearing this, everyone turned to look at Nero with different
        expressions.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Ah, this isn't appropriate. I'm not mentally prepared." Nero was
        shocked, stammering, "You, you built this organization from scratch, and
        now you're handing it over to me. I'm afraid I can't bear such a
        responsibility…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao raised his brows and scolded, "What are you thinking? I only
        want you to be the acting Army Commander. I will be the Army Commander
        in name only and will not interfere with the daily affairs of the army,
        but you still have to report to me."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Now that he had become the Supreme Leader of the Supers Holy Land, he
        needed to avoid the outside world. If he continued to lead the Black
        Star Army, it would be easy for others to have ideas, and it would also
        increase the army's ego. Although Han Xiao was not afraid, he would
        avoid it if he could. It just so happened that he also wanted to relieve
        some of his burdens and make himself more relaxed.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After all, with his Transcendent Grade and the power of the World Tree,
        he no longer needed external organizations to support his position.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Then I'm relieved." Nero heaved a sigh of relief.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He could not be blamed for being cowardly. There were too many Beyond
        Grade As in the army. Although he was Black Star's godson, he still
        could not hold on.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Furthermore, the name ‘Black Star Army' was already renowned throughout
        the universe. Nero was afraid that he would ruin its reputation if he
        stood too high. However, it would be much easier if he only worked.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao turned to look at Aurora and said, "The same goes for you. Now
        that you're the second-in-command of the Supers Holy Land, you don't
        have to continue being the Deputy Army Commander of the Black Star Army.
        You can hand over your position later." Aurora was unwilling. "What
        happened to the promise of staying in the army as long as I'm willing to
        stay?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao shook his head and laughed. "Your identity is no longer
        suitable. You don't have to carry everything on your shoulders. Even if
        you're not in the army, our relationship won't change. As the saying
        goes, a person will always strive for greater things. The Black Star
        Army was just a phase of your life. It's already over."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Humph, big liar."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Aurora turned her head to the side.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Helpless, Han Xiao turned to look at Hila and asked, "What about you?
        Have you thought about what I told you? Do you want to take on the
        position of the Supers Holy Land's Esper Department's Chief?" "Sure."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Hila nodded.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Alright, then hand over your positions in the army with Aurora."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Han Xiao nodded as he spoke out.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Supers Holy Land was divided into five important departments, led by
        the corresponding Beyond Grade As.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Hila's performance in this war was clear to all. Coupled with the
        characteristics of the Underworld, no one had any objections to her
        taking over the Esper Department.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Originally, Han Xiao wanted Manison to be in charge of the Mechanic
        Department, but since Manison had rejected him, he had no choice but to
        give up and let Kant manage the Mechanic Department. The Mage Department
        was managed by Milizaus, and the assistant was Secret Master. The head
        of the Pugilist Department was Sierron, and Han Xiao planned to replace
        him with Karlot in the future. The best candidate for the Psychic
        Department was Kasuyi, but he was traveling far away, so he replaced him
        with a peak Beyond Grade A Psychic who had been following the
        association for a long time, with Feidin as the assistant.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After a series of changes, the high positions of the Supers Holy Land
        were given to the various contributors.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Many of them were ‘former members of the Black Star Army'. Han Xiao told
        them to hand over their positions in the army and did not force them to
        be tied up with the army. Although these people did not mind following
        him, he still had to give them face. As upper echelons of the Supers
        Holy Land, it would not be good to keep the title of Deputy Army
        Commanders. It would also make it seem like the Black Star Army
        controlled the decision-making power of the civilization. Although he
        had the qualifications to be a dictator, he did not need to show it.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        On the surface, a batch of Beyond Grade As leaving would make it seem
        like the upper echelons of the Black Star Army had lost their strength,
        but in reality, it was not much different to Han Xiao. In the past, he
        had wanted to gather a large number of experts to strengthen the Black
        Star Army, but now he had to do a reduction. His position had changed
        greatly, and just because these Beyond Grade As were not in the army did
        not mean that they would not listen to him.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This time, Hila crossed her arms and said straightforwardly, "You have
        to teach me how to enter the Transcendent Grade."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "I can't teach you now. Wait till you reach the bottleneck."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Han Xiao waved his hands.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He arranged many army Beyond Grade As' positions. After dealing with the
        last person, he thought for a while and looked at Aurora.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Right, let Sorokin out. I have something to talk to him about."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Aurora curled her lips, but still did as she was told. Balls of gentle
        golden energy condensed into a physical body, gradually turning into
        Sorokin.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Sorokin opened his eyes and looked around before looking at Han Xiao.
        "Hmm? Isn't the war over? Why did you call me out?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao rubbed his knuckles and said, "I have a good deal for you. As
        long as you're willing to agree to a few rules and not cause trouble or
        mess around, I will allow you out of the Underworld and to keep moving
        outside."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Hearing this, Sorokin was suspicious.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Since when do you treat me so well? Tell me, what do you want me to
        do?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "The Beyond Grade A Association has established a civilization called
        the Supers Holy Land. I'll tell you the details later. I hope you can be
        an upper echelon in terms of economy or business and display your
        strengths. How about it? Are you interested?" "There's such a good
        thing." Sorokin's eyes lit up. "Just tell me if you're willing."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Han Xiao said casually.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Of course, there was no shortage of professionals in the Supers Holy
        Land, but Sorokin was the one who knew how to make money the best among
        the Beyond Grade As. Han Xiao felt that throwing him in the Underworld
        would be a waste of his talent, so he might as well get Sorokin out and
        make use of him.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Anyway, with his current position, he was no longer afraid of Sorokin
        stirring up any trouble.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "No problem, you don't have to worry. With me around, I will definitely
        make this Supers Holy Land's economy flourish, become stronger, and
        create glory!" Sorokin immediately agreed.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Since he had nothing to do in the Underworld, he naturally would not
        reject such a rare opportunity to ‘relax'.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As for the enmity between him and Black Star, Sorokin had already
        accepted his fate over the years. He was a smart person and would not
        take it to heart.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao nodded with satisfaction. Just as he was about to say
        something, his communicator suddenly rang.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Beep beep beep…</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He took a look. It was a call from the Dynasty Ruler, Marbruce.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao waved his hand and signaled for everyone to leave. After
        everyone left, he picked up the call.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"What have you called for?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Black Star, we plan to hold a grand ceremony on January 1 of the 800th
        year of the Galaxy Calendar to celebrate this victory, to commemorate
        the lives sacrificed in the war, and to honor the heroes. Your Supers
        Holy Land should participate as well, especially you. The entire
        Galactic Society sees you as a hero, so don't be absent."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"I'll be there."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Han Xiao nodded in agreement.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This war was indeed worthy for the three Universal Civilizations to hold
        a grand ceremony, and the date they chose was also very meaningful. The
        first day of the New Era… It was probably not for the convenience of the
        students to memorize that they chose
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">this date.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After chatting casually for a while, Han Xiao told them about the choice
        of Hilbert and the others. However, Marbruce's reaction was very calm,
        as though he had expected it. It was a pity that Han Xiao did not see
        how furious he was. After hanging up, Han Xiao calculated the date.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "There's still half a year left before the ceremony. This period of time
        is enough for the Supers Holy Land to gain a firm foothold. After the
        ceremony, I'll have a lot of free time. I'll then enter the Sanctum and
        revive those unlucky people who died in battle… I'll also find out all
        the information on the message board."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Because the World Tree had solved the problem of the Sanctum Key, Han
        Xiao naturally thought of a plan, which was to use it to enter and exit
        the Sanctum and unlock all the information on the message board.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">In theory, this was completely possible.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, this would require a lot of time, so Han Xiao decided to wait
        for the situation to stabilize before implementing it.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Speaking of which, I wonder what the players have been doing recently…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao opened the interface and looked at the players' forums. Most of
        the topics discussed in the posts were related to the victory of the war
        and the Supers Holy Land.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Now that the war had ended, the players had nothing to do. Although Han
        Xiao had put up the Dungeon Crystals of the ‘World Tree War' series,
        most of them still had nothing to do. They had just experienced the end
        of a main storyline mission, so many of them could not be bothered to do
        side missions for the time being
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In addition, the fifth Pro League was already in the preparation stage,
        attracting the attention of the players. Therefore, Han Xiao did not
        have to worry about the players having nothing better to do.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "The universe is peaceful and society is stable. Everything is
        improving… Tsk tsk, I haven't had such an easy time in a long time."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao heaved a sigh of relief and felt a sense of satisfaction.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        On the other side of the Planet of the Deities Manison's mansion.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Manison casually played with the pile of cards and looked at Kasuyi who
        was deep in thought. "You've already decided to travel far and found a
        new life goal. I haven't congratulated you yet."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "After living for so long, I have to find something to do. There are no
        secrets in the explored universe to me. Finding the unknown is more
        fun." Kasuyi casually threw out a card and smiled. "Speaking of which, I
        didn't expect you to reject Black Star's invitation and give up this
        position."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Aren't you the same?" Manison did not comment.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "I don't want to work because I have to travel far away, but why don't
        you want this authority if you are staying here? This isn't like you."
        Kasuyi raised his brows.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "I have other plans." Manison glanced at the cards, took out a card, and
        pretended to play it. However, after thinking for a while, he stuffed
        this card back in and changed to another card. He did not stop talking
        and said, "I plan to study in seclusion for decades. I don't want to be
        distracted elsewhere… Furthermore, with Black Star around, I will never
        be able to surpass him in the eyes of Mechanics."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Indeed." Kasuyi sighed. "Being in the same era as him is the misfortune
        of all Mechanics."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Manison looked up at him and knocked on the table. "You're not a
        Mechanic, why are you so emotional?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "To be honest, if I were you, I would have directly taken Black Star as
        my teacher. Learning is not embarrassing." Kasuyi shrugged.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"You talk too much. Hurry up and play."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Manison snorted. Although his relationship with Han Xiao had improved
        quite a bit, and he was willing to listen to the other party's orders to
        a certain extent, asking him to lower his head again? Impossible!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Supers Holy Land established a new structure after the war. After
        preliminary observation, a large number of Supers from different
        civilizations entered the territory of the Supers Holy Land from various
        Star Fields. After approval, they received official citizenship. The
        work efficiency of a Beyond Grade A organization was known to be very
        high. As the various projects were quickly completed, the Supers Holy
        Land that had only been established for a few months started operating
        efficiently. On the other hand, the entire galactic society was still in
        a daze and needed a lot of time to adapt to the new situation.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Super Star Cluster Alliance also made use of the birth of the Supers
        Holy Land to get rid of the suppression they had always been in and
        finally enjoyed the treatment of normal advanced civilization, obtaining
        a certain degree of freedom to develop.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After the war, the situation gradually stabilized. The entire galactic
        society was trying to adapt to the changes after the war, and in the
        blink of an eye, it reached the end of year 799 of the Galaxy Calendar.
        The three Universal Civilizations held a celebration ceremony as
        scheduled.

      </h1>
      <p class="calibre3">Year 800 of the Galaxy Calendar, 1st January.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Central Galaxy, New Era Planet.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        A few months ago, in order to hold this celebration, the three Universal
        Civilizations started manually modifying this planet, turning the
        desolate and dying planet into a celebration planet. They named it ‘New
        Era Planet' to commemorate their hundred years of experience, especially
        the victory of the World Tree War.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Looking down from space, there was a huge building that looked like a
        tower on the New Era planet. At the top was an open-air square platform.
        This was the venue of the celebration, and there were rows of floating
        seats around it.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Countless spaceships were hovering in the air, covering the sky.
        Countless galactic media outlets had arrived to broadcast the scene.
        This time, it was also a full broadcast of the various Star Fields.
        However, the number of viewers could not create a new record. Because of
        the war, many people had lost their lives. However, the viewership
        ratings had reached a new high, and almost every family stayed in front
        of the television to watch the broadcast.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Anti-gravity hovering cars rose from the ground and flew to the venue.
        The invited guests took their seats one after another. The
        representatives of the various civilizations, the military, the Beyond
        Grade As, and so on were all important people in the galactic society.
        As the guests entered and waited for the ceremony to start, the venue
        quickly became lively.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Beyond Grade As beside him chatted casually, but Han Xiao did not
        participate in the conversation. He took out his communicator and looked
        at it. The galactic media had already started broadcasting, and the
        cameras swept across the venue. It seemed like they knew what the
        audience wanted to see, and they would pull it to his face from time to
        time, capturing every masculine detail.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Tsk, always taking pictures of me. Am I that pleasing to the eye?".
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Han Xiao smacked his lips without any shame.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kasuyi, who was sitting at the side, nudged his waist with his elbow and
        chuckled. "It's a pity that you haven't revived those Beyond Grade As
        who died in battle. They're going to miss this celebration."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "I did it on purpose. In a while, when we pay our respects to the dead,
        if we see those victims alive, it would spoil the atmosphere." Han Xiao
        paused for a moment, and with a strange expression, he added, "Besides,
        you don't want to see Dillon speak on such an occasion, right?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"… That's true." Kasuyi shivered.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Han Xiao shook his head and stopped talking.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In the past half a year, his Supers Holy Land had stabilized, and he had
        a rare holiday. His mental state was pretty good, and he was enjoying
        himself.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Although the ceremony this time was just a formality for Han Xiao, it
        was quite meaningful for the galactic society. They wanted to comfort
        the wounds left by the galactic residents in the war so that they would
        have the courage to look forward to the future. After all, a normal
        person's life required a sense of ceremony.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Not long after, the leaders of the three Universal Civilizations
        personally arrived. The venue gradually quietened down, and the audience
        watching the broadcast held their breath.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Under the watchful eyes of the crowd, Marbruce slowly walked up to the
        podium. His expression was solemn as he scanned the audience.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "The universe is vast and boundless. Countless unknown civilizations are
        like stars in the sky, bringing life to this world that should have been
        dead. We are also one of them, living in a corner of the universe,
        constantly reproducing… In the past hundred years, we have experienced
        many hardships, internal conflicts, technological disasters, and foreign
        enemies…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Marbruce explained everything in detail, including the Crimson Tide, the
        Flickering World, the Intelligent Plague, the World Tree War, and so on.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The past hundred years could be said to have been like a storm, and
        Black Star is a character that could not be avoided talking about. He
        had an extremely strong presence on the galactic stage as he was part of
        most galactic events. The past hundred years were like the history of
        Black Star's rise.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Many players who were watching the broadcast listened with great
        interest. When they thought of Bun-Hit-Dog's ‘Black Star Army' series,
        they could not help but feel honored. It was as if they were there on
        scene the whole time. No matter how great Black Star's achievements
        were, the image of Black Phantom still lingered in the minds of many of
        the hardcore players. With their support and witness, he grew up step by
        step like a child. "…We've survived through all the tough times in the
        past. Today, we've finally entered a peaceful New Era. This can't do
        without the contributions and sacrifices of the pioneers. They used
        their lives to exchange for a stable new life for us…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Marbruce's expression was solemn. He took out a speech and slowly read
        it. "The 31st Galactic Alliance Army Fleet No. 31, the original ‘Iron
        Flag' fleet of the Crimson Dynasty, blocked the World Tree Civilization.
        A total of 8.8 million people were wiped out."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Galactic Alliance Army Fleet No. 477, former Federation of Light
        ‘Glimmer' fleet, met the World Tree Vanguard troops at the Flickering
        World's defense frontline. They had 11.2 million people, and only 403
        are left."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Galactic Alliance Army…"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Marbruce's tone was solemn as he read the shocking death statistics.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As the numbers of the sacrificed troops appeared one after another,
        everyone present and the galactic residents in front of the screen
        became solemn.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Many people only knew that there were many casualties in this war, but
        they did not know the details. Only now did they get a clear idea.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Everyone mourned for a few minutes before Marbruce continued to speak.
        The atmosphere was solemn as he conferred the honors to the victims who
        died in battle. After all the sacrifices were conferred, it was time to
        reward the surviving war heroes. Only then did the atmosphere become
        more relaxed and lively.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        One by one, the war contributors took to the stage, and the leaders of
        the three Universal Civilizations consecutively awarded honors. Most of
        them were military officers, and all the Beyond Grade As had a share.
        The previous Revivors who had transferred to the Supers Holy Land also
        received different Medals of Honor. Even the Super Star Cluster
        Alliance, which normally could only be bystanders, also received
        different medals.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The three Universal Civilizations had expressed their sincerity. They
        did not talk about factions today, only about merits.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Lagi actually wanted to express himself freely, but when he felt Han
        Xiao's gaze on him from where the latter sat, he obediently followed the
        speech prepared for him.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This segment lasted for a long time, and it was finally Han Xiao's turn.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Marbruce coughed and said brightly, "In the World Tree War, Black Star
        made too many contributions and provided us with a large amount of
        intelligence. In the end, he turned the tables and gave us the
        opportunity to end the war in advance. His contributions are
        irreplaceable. All the members of the Galaxy Civilization General
        Council unanimously decided to award Black Star the Galaxy Medal!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Pa pa pa!</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Everyone applauded loudly. Black Star's reputation in the Lawful Faction
        was already off the charts, and almost everyone was sincerely
        congratulating him.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        When dealing with the Intelligent Plague, Black Star had already
        received a Galaxy Medal, and now he had received a second Galaxy Medal.
        The Galaxy Medal was the highest honor in the galactic society, and it
        would not be given a second time. However, Black Star was the only
        person who had received it twice, and he had already created history.
        However, they were not surprised at all. Black Star deserved this honor.
        Other than the Galaxy Medal, there was no other award that could match
        his contribution.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Amidst the applause, Han Xiao stood up calmly and walked onto the stage.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Thank you for your contribution to the galactic society," Marbruce said
        sincerely.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        On the other hand, Louis and the Pope patted Han Xiao's arms to show
        their closeness. Han Xiao would not refuse to give them face in such a
        situation. He nodded and received the Galaxy Medal from the three
        Universal Civilizations' leaders.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        According to the usual practice, the person who was awarded the award
        had to give a speech. Han Xiao had prepared a speech long ago, and it
        was all just for show.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He walked to the podium and was about to speak when he suddenly paused.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Countless lights flashed in front of his eyes, and countless galactic
        residents were looking at him from behind the screen. The guests around
        him quietened down and stretched their necks. The faces of the different
        races were filled with the same anticipation and hope. They held their
        breaths and waited for him to give a long speech.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Seeing this, Han Xiao was a little dazed. He looked down at the medal on
        his chest and subconsciously rubbed it.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He hesitated for a few seconds and gave up on the long speech. He shook
        his head and said in a solemn voice.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "…I hope that there will be no more wars in this universe. I hope for
        universal peace."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The venue hesitated for a moment, waiting for Han Xiao to continue.
        However, Han Xiao nodded at the crowd after he finished speaking. Seeing
        this, the people present all applauded.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The process was carried out step by step. After Marbruce's impassioned
        speech about ‘looking to the future', the ceremony finally ended
        smoothly.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The entire galactic society was jubilant. It was as if their souls had
        been baptized, and they were filled with new motivation for the future.
        A few days later, in the conference room of the three Universal
        Civilizations.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "The Star Alliance is still the same as before. According to the spies
        that were instigated by Black Star, the upper echelons of the Star
        Alliance believe in their intelligence and are very excited."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "However, we still have to be careful in case the Star Alliance sends
        out new spies. If that happens, we'll be exposed." "That's right. Black
        Star has already informed us. He said that he will disappear for a
        period of time to revive a batch of Beyond Grade As in the Sanctum. We
        have to be careful during this period. Don't let the Star Alliance see
        through our trick."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The three of them discussed softly. Black Star would not be able to helm
        the Supers Holy Land for the time being if he went to the Sanctum, but
        the three of them did not have any other thoughts about him. They were
        only worried that the Star Alliance would see through their plan if
        Black Star was not around.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "After more than half a year of recuperation, the army has recovered a
        little, but the loss of Supers is quite severe. There's no way to
        compete with the Supers Holy Land. Sigh…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "However, Black Star said a few days ago that he was willing to develop
        the Sanctum with us in the future. I wonder if he's lying."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">The three of them were confused.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Now that Black Star had the upper hand and his position was stable,
        there was no need for him to share the information about the Sanctum
        with them. They did not know what Black Star was planning.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "I don't think so," Marbruce said hesitantly. "The Sanctum Revival is an
        important trump card of Black Star's, so how can he share it with us? If
        he really did that, he definitely has a bigger plan."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Louis shook his head. "Let's not talk about him for now. It's more
        important to deal with the Star Alliance. Although they have fallen into
        our trap, we can't hide it forever. The more time passes, the more
        suspicious they will be. When do you think it's better to take action?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Pope pondered for a moment before saying, "The galactic society
        can't take another round of war. If we act rashly, the praise we have
        now might turn into criticism… I think we should at least wait for the
        galactic society to stabilize for three to five years before we act.
        Anyway, time is on our side, so there's no need to rush. Let's wait
        until we recover." The three of them discussed plans on when to start a
        new war.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Half a month later, somewhere in the Supers Holy Land.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao floated in the universe without anyone around him.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He had already spoken to the three Universal Civilizations and the
        Supers Holy Land. He would enter the Sanctum today and begin his plan to
        increase his authority.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In the inner space, the World Tree moved slightly, materializing a
        Sanctum Key and quickly burning it. The next moment, a ray of light shot
        out from his palm and turned into the light door of the Sanctum in the
        universe before him.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "I hope this plan works…" Han Xiao calmed himself down and flew in. His
        body was gradually engulfed by the light.
      </p>

      </h1>
      <p class="calibre3">
        It was the familiar tunnel of light again, and the familiar blur…
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">After some time, Han Xiao regained clarity.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao's vision suddenly became clear. Looking around, he could still
        see the familiar scene of the First Sanctum. The white world was
        endless, and countless light spheres floated in it, these were the
        Information Form collective body that recorded information of
        Iterations.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "It's still blurry, but it's a little lighter than before…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao was no stranger to this feeling. After all, he had been here
        many times and was already a frequent visitor. He looked down at the
        back of his hand. The Sanctum mark was shining brightly, one level
        higher than last time.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Let's revive those unlucky fools first."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao did not waste any time. He skillfully sacrificed the mediums of
        the Beyond Grade As that died and activated the Sanctum Revival
        function.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Very soon, rays of light appeared out of nowhere and gathered from all
        directions, forming a Sanctum revival mark that floated in front of Han
        Xiao.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao pointed with his finger, and the Sanctum revival mark seemed to
        turn into liquid. It flowed along with his finger and stopped on the
        back of his hand, turning into a complicated tattoo. He extended his
        consciousness into it and checked on the reviving targets. He confirmed
        that all the people on the Soul Comfort Monument were inside.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After doing this, Han Xiao let out a sigh of relief. He calmed himself
        down, brought out the Sanctum's message board, and looked at it.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        His authority in the First Sanctum had increased once again, and more
        content appeared on the message board compared to the last time. Han
        Xiao compared it according to his memory and saw the records of
        Celestial Star Alliance in the fifth last paragraph. Only then did he
        focus and look at the last paragraphs carefully.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The last four paragraphs were the ones with the most empty content. He
        had read them twice in the past, but he had only obtained two pieces of
        valuable information. One was the ‘Information Form Stripping Plan'
        mentioned in the fourth last paragraph, and the other was the last
        paragraph which indicated the continuation of the previous Iteration's
        plan. It mentioned some ‘unknown device' and ‘control terminal'.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This time, Han Xiao realized that some of the content in the last four
        messages had been filled up. There were some messages that he was
        concerned about in the second last and last paragraph. [… transformation
        plan failed, but the principle has been proved to be feasible. The
        reason for the failure is that there is no crucial true-state medium to
        establish connection with

      <p class="calibre3">

        device has been manufactured and loaded into the template, which may
        cause information alienation in the process of and present in the
        following in the form of ‘distorted' unknown…) &mdash; was the message
        in the second last paragraph.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        [… The existing true-state mediums are not enough to complete the
        transformation plan of the previous iteration. We need deeper

      <p class="calibre3">

        terminal in the Information Form Materialization device to reduce the
        processing cost of the Information Form Materialization device…] &mdash;
        was the message in the last paragraph.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Hmm, this…"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Han Xiao's eyes sparkled.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The second last message was from the ‘previous Iteration' written in the
        last message. Looking at the content, the latter had inherited the
        former's plan.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The ‘unknown device' and ‘control terminal' mentioned in the last
        paragraph had also been unlocked. They were the ‘Information Form
        Materialization device' created by the Iteration who left the second
        last message.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In addition, these two pieces of information threw out a new concept,
        ‘True State'. Han Xiao was secretly surprised. With his current level,
        there were very few things that he did not understand at the
        technological level. It was actually his first time seeing this term.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao tried to use the term ‘index function' with the Sanctum
        authority, but the Sanctum mark did not respond. Generally speaking, the
        index function could only be activated by a precise search of a single
        Iteration or the civilization's name.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Looks like I have to continue to farm for more authority and unlock the
        civilization names of the last four messages." Han Xiao nodded to
        himself. The name of the civilization mentioned in the last four
        messages was still empty, and he did not have the authority to check it.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After memorizing this information, Han Xiao closed the message board and
        began to search for technological information in the First Sanctum.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Although he had yet to finish researching his gathered resources and was
        not lacking in technology, he was already here… After his clearance to
        the Sanctum increased, the upper limit of his memory capacity also
        increased. After quite some time, Han Xiao finally filled up the
        capacity and returned with a full load. He did not stay any longer and
        opened the Sanctum channel to leave.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After passing through the tunnel of light again, Han Xiao's body
        suddenly felt lighter, and he had already returned to the main universe.
        The Sanctum's light gate behind him disappeared.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao opened his communicator. Only thirty days had passed.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "The flow of time is getting closer. The next time will probably only
        take twenty days." Han Xiao's eyes sparkled.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The message board of the Sanctum seemed to be universal, and it was the
        same no matter which Sanctum it was. Therefore, he only needed to focus
        his firepower on gaining authority in one Sanctum. If he increased
        authority in all the Sanctums together, it would take many years. Han
        Xiao thought about it, changed into King, and teleported to the main
        planet of the Supers Holy Land. He flew to the huge square where all the
        Beyond Grade A statues were placed.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At this time, the square was bustling with activity, and there was an
        endless stream of people. They were all Supers from all over the world.
        Upon seeing Han Xiao arrive, they were stunned for a moment before being
        pleasantly surprised.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Look, it's Black Star!"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">"It's the real deal!"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "I'm your admirer. Can you give me an autograph…" The pedestrians were
        excited, and they swarmed over like crazy fans. Among the Supers, Black
        Star was almost everyone's idol. At least eight out of ten Supers were
        his worshippers, no different from a great personage. Han Xiao smiled at
        them and waved his hand. A gentle breeze blew, and an invisible force
        field spread out, covering an area like a transparent barrier, blocking
        all the pedestrians.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The pedestrians who were further away also heard the commotion and came
        over. There was a sea of people outside the barrier, and very soon, they
        formed layers after layers. They looked at Han Xiao curiously and
        guessed the reason for his appearance.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao did not explain anything and activated the Sanctum revival
        mark. Rays of light surged and condensed into balls of light, gradually
        turning into the bodies of the Beyond Grade As that had died.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The reason why he displayed it in front of the public was to let the
        public see the actual scene of the Sanctum Revival and increase the
        attractiveness of the Supers Holy Land. This was a plan that he had come
        up with during the meeting a few months ago. In the future, the Sanctum
        Revival would be carried out publicly. Before farming the Sanctum
        authority, Han Xiao planned to revive these unlucky fools first. On one
        hand, he wanted them to return as soon as possible, fulfilling his
        promise.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        On the other hand, he wanted the three Universal Civilizations and the
        other organizations to see that his time in the Sanctum was shortened,
        telling them that he could return at any time. Although those annoying
        people might not have other intentions, Han Xiao felt that it was best
        to avoid this possibility, lest these advanced civilizations felt that
        he had disappeared for too long and wanted to cause trouble again.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Very soon, the light in the square solidified, and under everyone's
        gaze, this batch of dead Beyond Grade As revived with confusion on their
        faces.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Haha, I'm alive again. Praise Black Star!"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Where is this? Why haven't I seen it before?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "What era is it now? Has the World Tree War ended?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The group of revivors looked around curiously before their eyes landed
        on Han Xiao.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Alright, the war is over. We won. Ask Aurora and others about the
        details."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao waved his hands casually. This was not the first time these
        people had revived. The advantage was that he did not have to explain
        the situation from the start.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He turned to look at Dylan and said, "I've fulfilled my promise and
        allowed you to regain your freedom. You'd better keep a low profile in
        the future. Otherwise, if others want to kill you again, I won't stop
        them."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Dylan's face twitched.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Restoring his freedom should have been a happy thing, but Dylan felt a
        little weak.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        When he was the Hero Spirit of the Underworld, he did not have to worry
        about anything, so he was even more unrestrained in his words. He let
        himself loose and scolded whoever he wanted, and he offended many
        people.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Other people could not be bothered to argue with a ‘dead person' like
        him, but now that he was alive, if they came to settle the score, he
        would suffer heavy losses…
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        For some reason, Dillon felt a little reluctant to part with the feeling
        of being an Underworld Spirit…
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao did not say much to the others. He turned around, teleported,
        and disappeared. Without the force field barrier, countless pedestrians
        swarmed over. These revivors did not understand the situation and almost
        drowned in the sea of people. They quickly rose into the sky and left.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Halfway through the flight, Aurora, who had already noticed the
        commotion, arrived with a group of Beyond Grade As on the main planet to
        welcome the revivors.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Congratulations on reviving. Come with us to understand the situation,"
        Aurora said. Ever since she was elected as the second-in-command of the
        Supers Holy Land, she had been maintaining a big sister attitude, as if
        this would give her some ‘prestige' bonuses. However, in the eyes of the
        Beyond Grade As who had the first impression of her, she was still cute
        and adorable. Even if Aurora deliberately put on an elegant and
        dignified appearance, it did not have any deterrence at all.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The revivors nodded and followed Aurora toward the core building of the
        Supers Holy Land.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Just as Dylan was about to follow, he suddenly felt a hot and vigorous
        bloody intent coming from the side. Two thick, firm, and flexible
        muscles clamped his arm like a huge mouth. At the same time, his
        shoulder was grabbed by someone, and waves of enormous strength were
        transmitted, grabbing him tightly and not letting him move.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Dylan turned around and saw Sierron appearing beside him. Sierron put
        his arm around his shoulders and leaned over with a wicked smile on his
        face. "Yo, you're finally alive. Come over here. We have a bunch of guys
        who want to have a good chat with you."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Dylan turned around stiffly, only to see a group of Beyond Grade As
        staring at him with a teasing look in their eyes.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Gulp…</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Dylan swallowed a mouthful of saliva, and cold sweat appeared on his
        back.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As the saying went, it was easy to go from frugal to extravagant, but it
        was difficult to go from extravagant to frugal. At this moment, Dylan
        realized that being a Hero Spirit was indeed more ‘comfortable'…
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao only appeared for a short period of time. After completing the
        Sanctum Revival, he immediately opened the Sanctum again and started the
        process of farming his authority.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Currently, the matters of the Supers Holy Land were all being managed by
        Aurora and the Elders Association. The external environment was very
        stable, so his disappearance did not have much of an impact.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As the days passed, it was finally time for Kasuyi to set off. Most of
        the Beyond Grade As respected this comrade of theirs and they all came
        to see him off on the day he left.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After the battle with the World Tree, most of them had become comrades
        and their relationship was much better than before. As for Kasuyi, who
        was kind to others, he was quite popular. At the dock of the Supers Holy
        Land, a long-distance spaceship with the highest technologies was
        docked. The hatch opened. Kasuyi and Oathkeeper had already packed their
        things. They stood in front of the gangway and said their goodbyes.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "The unexplored universe is filled with unknown dangers. The two of you
        must be careful," Aurora said on behalf of everyone.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Kasuyi smiled and said, "It's alright, we have Black Star to back us up
        anyway… Haha, it's just a joke. With our abilities, we won't fall into
        danger so easily."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "If you guys go, you probably won't come back for a long time. There
        will be no news of you. Sigh… I won't be able to find you to play cards
        anymore." Kant was a little sad. "It's fine. Our Supers Holy Land may
        not have much of anything else, but we do have many card players."
        Kasuyi shook his head and smiled.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At this moment, Manison walked forward and patted Kasuyi's shoulder. He
        did not say much and simply said, "Goodbye, old friend. Have a good
        journey."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Thanks. I also wish you success in your seclusion." Kasuyi stopped
        smiling and nodded.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Not counting Black Star, his relationship with Manison was actually the
        best among everyone. The two of them had known each other for hundreds
        of years, and they were old acquaintances.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Most of the people who saw off Kasuyi were Beyond Grade As of the
        current era. On the other side, Oathkeeper was surrounded by the first
        batch of revived Primordial Ones of the Holy Accord.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Back then, we made the Holy Accord together, and our comrades died one
        after another. You are the only one who has lasted till now. None of us
        expected you to really complete this work." "It's been hard on you all
        these years. If not for you, we would still be sleeping."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Although you did not reveal yourself in our active era, we now know
        that you might be the best among us."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Many Primordial Ones sighed.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Oathkeeper was expressionless. He waved his hand and said, "Let's not
        talk about the past. I'm just fulfilling the promise I made back then.
        There's nothing worthy of praise… Unfortunately, although we've really
        achieved our wish and successfully revived in the future, the era no
        longer belongs to us."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Beiger sighed and said with a reluctant tone, "Sigh, no matter what, we
        are still grateful for your actions. When you miss us, take a look at
        the Primordial Ones card set that we gave you. This is the
        first-generation discontinued card set that we ‘kindly' requested from
        the Wayne Card distribution group headquarters…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "I will keep it well." Oathkeeper was speechless, but his usually
        serious face still revealed a smile that was hard to notice.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After bidding farewell for a while, Kasuyi and Oathkeeper looked at each
        other.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Let's go."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The two of them nodded at everyone before boarding the spaceship.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Buzz</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Everyone watched as the spaceship slowly began to move. It glided along
        the orbit and took off into space. With a sudden acceleration, it
        disappeared into the depths of space, leaving only a trail of flames
        behind.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Manison retracted his gaze and left without saying goodbye.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He decided to enter a long period of seclusion from today onwards. He
        would isolate himself from the rest of the world and focus on his
        research.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Compared to taking shortcuts, he preferred to rely on his own
        intelligence, and this had never changed.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At the same time, in the Temple of Ten Thousand Gods. A fleet was
        already ready.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Your Excellency Wuornos, have you decided? Are you really going to the
        unexplored universe?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The priests surrounded him with complicated expressions.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "I've already discovered that the key to the path ahead is hidden in the
        depths of space."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Wuornos looked at the galaxy with deep eyes.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Just a few months ago, he finally dug out his hidden perception and
        sensed the location of the Beyonder's Vestige in the galaxy. Like the
        bright Venus, it guided him from afar.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In the end, he decided to follow his intuition and leave the explored
        universe, heading to the unknown area to search for the opportunity to
        enter the Transcendent Grade. "In that case, we will respect your
        choice… The Pope told us to specially send a message. He said that he
        hopes when you return, you can become the first direct descendant to
        become a Transcendent."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Tell him that he will get what he wants."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Wuornos replied calmly and walked into the spaceship.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The next moment, the Arcane Church fleet slowly set off, heading toward
        the unknown.

      </h1>
      <p class="calibre3">Supers Holy Land, in a certain lifeless sector.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        A ball of colorful energy floated in space, its shape changing
        unpredictably, like a cloud being kneaded by an invisible force. All
        kinds of high-energy particles flowed through it, like electrical
        signals being released during neuron activity. The entire energy ball
        was like a small nebula-shaped energy field brain.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Evans floated in the middle with a serious expression, carefully
        controlling all kinds of energy to perfect this nebula brain.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, all of a sudden, the energy nebula started to expand
        uncontrollably, and the neural bridge that was built from all kinds of
        energy collapsed.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Just as the energy nebula was about to explode, Evans' Esper Ability
        Domain opened up. The violent energy suddenly stabilized and quickly
        shrank, turning into a dazzling light sphere the size of a human head
        before being absorbed into Evans' body.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Sigh, I failed again…"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Evans sighed in helplessness.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Ever since he witnessed the battle between Transcendent Grade Supers, he
        had always felt that his strength was insufficient. He had been driven
        ever since to pursue that unbelievable power.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Originally, after the war ended, everyone had started to take a break,
        but Evans was one of the few people who did not relax and had been busy
        developing his Esper Abilities.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        On one hand, his motivation was his own pursuit, and on the other hand,
        Evans still remembered Black Star's high hopes for him. He was not
        willing to waste his hard-earned potential and wanted to reach Black
        Star's level.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        On the other hand, EsGod was very glad about this. He thought that Evans
        was keeping his promise to help him beat Black Star up and always taught
        him things to guide Evans in his cultivation.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "I hope to increase my strength as soon as possible. His Excellency
        Black Star told me that he hopes I will be the main pillar of the Supers
        Holy Land in the future. I cannot disappoint him…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Evans clenched his fists and encouraged himself.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Just as he was about to give it another try, he suddenly sensed
        something and looked in a direction.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The stream of light approached, and a spaceship arrived in hyperdrive,
        hovering not far away. A burly figure flew out. It was Karlot. "Eh, so
        it's you. I was wondering why there was another high-energy reaction
        zone in our territory."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Karlot was surprised to see Evans and took the initiative to talk to
        him. "Er, hello." Evans hesitated for a moment before nodding
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Although the two of them were both members of the Black Star Army, they
        did not interact much with each other. They only knew each other's basic
        situation and could only be considered as colleagues.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"What are you doing here?" Evans was curious.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "I was looking for an extreme environment to temper my body. The
        spaceship sensed a high-energy reaction, so I came over. So, you were
        training. No wonder."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Oh, I see…"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The two of them were not familiar with each other, so they bit the
        bullet and chatted for a while. When they realized that there was
        nothing to talk about, they gradually fell silent.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, neither of them left. The atmosphere slowly became strange.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        When the two of them were in seclusion, they had always thought that
        they were the only seeded players who had received special treatment
        from Black Star. However, after leaving the mountain, they were
        surprised to find out that they were not the only ones. Such a
        relationship made the two of them have strange thoughts about each
        other. On one hand, they were curious about the other party's
        background, and on the other hand, they were curious about what Black
        Star saw in the other party… This mentality was akin to two top students
        in a class receiving special treatment from their teacher, and they
        subconsciously felt competitive…
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After a long time, Karlot coughed and broke the silence.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"How about… We spar?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">"…Sounds good."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Evans and Karlot's eyes met in midair, and sparks seemed to fly.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Black Star Army headquarters, Fleet Commander's Office.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Herlous sat on the sofa with his legs crossed. He looked at the Sunilian
        in front of him and pushed the wine glass on the table.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Drink some?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">"No need, Your Excellency Herlous."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Herlous did not mind. He sized up the Sunilian and nodded.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "You must be the Sunil leader of this generation. Not bad, not bad. The
        previous leader mentioned you to me before. He said you're very smart
        and capable."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"You flatter me." The leader nodded.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Sunilians were Herlous' race. Ever since the rise of the Black Star
        Army, Herlous, as the earliest elder, had a lot of authority, and he
        provided many resources to the race.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Therefore, every generation of Sunil leaders would come to visit him.
        This generation was no different.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Since you've become the leader, do your best."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Herlous encouraged and looked at the young Sunilians behind him. He
        raised his brows.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"These are…"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Your Excellency Herlous, these are a few young men with potential among
        my immediate family. They wish to enter the Black Star Army to train.
        Please take care of them," the Sunil leader said respectfully.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Herlous sized up the few of them, and the youths immediately stuck out
        their chests and raised their heads nervously.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Seeing this, Herlous shook his head and said, "The army has changed its
        leader, and Nero is now in charge. However, the standards are still as
        strict as ever. I can make them official members, but whether they can
        climb up will depend on their own abilities."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Thank you, Your Excellency." The Sunil leader bowed. Herlous waved his
        hand, indicating that there was no need for formalities. After a pause,
        he suddenly changed the topic. "From now on, leaders of your generation
        should stop visiting me. You should be more independent. You should
        leave me out from now."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Sunil leader's body trembled slightly, and his expression was
        complicated. However, he did not say anything, lowered his head, and
        left with his men.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After the group left, another person walked in. It was Sylvia. She had
        been eavesdropping outside for quite some time. "Not bad. You've finally
        decided not to use your position for personal gain," Sylvia teased.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Nonsense. I've always been thinking about the army." Herlous rolled his
        eyes.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "I was just joking. However, I'm very curious. Why aren't you helping
        the race anymore?" Sylvia blinked.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "They can't always rely on me, or else they will become dependent sooner
        or later. After close to a hundred years, the habits that have been
        cultivated from generation to generation have already started to show
        signs of this. I can't just ignore it." Herlous shook his head and said
        with a deep voice, "Furthermore… Black Star was able to tolerate me in
        the past, but now that the authority has changed hands, I have to be
        sensible in the future."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Sylvia curled her lips and did not speak. She stood in front of the
        window with her hands behind her back and looked at the bright galaxy
        outside. Suddenly, she sighed and muttered,
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "In the blink of an eye, it's been a hundred years…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Herlous also turned to look out the window and sighed. "That's right,
        it's been a hundred years… We actually followed Black Star to this
        point. Sometimes, it feels like a dream. If Black Star had not invited
        me back then, I might have spent the rest of my life in my own little
        pub."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "If I hadn't met him…" Sylvia's tone paused, and she shook her head.
        "Maybe I would have died in some corner of the universe long ago. The
        life we have now is not something we can hope for…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The two of them looked out of the window quietly and did not speak
        anymore. They quietly savored their memories.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In this peaceful era, time passed even more silently. In the blink of an
        eye, another few months passed.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        On this day, in the conference room of the three Universal
        Civilizations.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Recently, the direct Beyond Grade As have been restless. The expansion
        of the Beyond Grade As is too shocking." "Thankfully, Clotti, Oulou, and
        the others have stabilized the situation. Otherwise, the direct line of
        descent might have turned to the Supers Holy Land." The leaders of the
        three Universal Civilizations sighed.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Supers Holy Land had broken the old structure. As the original
        beneficiaries of Supers, they naturally could not feel comfortable, but
        they could only silently endure the waves of impact.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Speaking of which, Black Star did not appear during this period of
        time. Hasn't he already completed the Sanctum Revival? What has he been
        busy with recently?" The Pope was curious.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Who knows? Anyway, I can't get any information." Marbruce was helpless.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "It's not a good idea for him to disappear for so long. If the Star
        Alliance sends in a new infiltrator, and Black Star happens to not be
        around, we might get exposed." "Speaking of which, if Black Star is
        willing to help, as long as he controls the leader of the Star Alliance,
        we will be able to win easily. It's a pity that he doesn't want to
        help."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Heh, with Black Star's personality, there's no such thing as an
        absolute deal. I think the price is not enough. As long as some
        conditions are made, he should still agree."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "That makes sense, but he has a huge appetite now. We have to think of a
        way to convince him…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Just as the three of them were discussing how to pull Han Xiao to help
        with the Star Alliance a remote projection suddenly appeared in the
        room. It was Han Xiao. The three of them were shocked. "Black Star? You…
        you're back. Why didn't you inform me…" Marbruce was halfway through his
        sentence when he suddenly realized something. He frowned and said with
        dissatisfaction," Hey! Did you hack into the Dynasty's database again?".
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao ignored Marbruce's dissatisfaction and looked at the three of
        them with a strange gaze.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "I'm here to share the information of the Sanctum. We can develop it
        together. If you're not happy, I'll leave."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">The three of them were stunned.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Are you serious? Are you really taking us to develop the Sanctum?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Louis' tone was filled with doubt and disbelief. He had thought that
        Black Star was joking.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Han Xiao nodded but suddenly changed the topic.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "But before we work together, I have something to tell you… Don't be
        afraid of what I'm about to say…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Afraid?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Pope found it funny and did not think much of it.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "We've even experienced an enemy like the World Tree. What else can we
        be afraid of? Just tell us. We've seen all kinds of storms. We won't be
        scared."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao raised his brows with a playful expression.

      </h1>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Alright, what I'm going to say next is the truth about the transition
        of the entire universe. It's more important than anything you've
        experienced in the past and present. I'll say this in advance. If you
        have any schedule later, clear it all."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao saw the look of disapproval on their faces and shook his head.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"The truth of the universe?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The three of them looked at each other. Seeing that Han Xiao did not
        seem to be joking, they could not help but be skeptical.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao snapped his fingers and summoned a virtual screen that was
        playing the virtual image of the birth and death of the universe. He
        then explained, "When the universe comes to an end, everything will
        return to nothingness. The phenomena like the heat death of the universe
        and the Big Crunch are the result of many scientists' guesses or
        foreseeing of the universe. All kinds of signs and experiments show that
        these are all very likely to be the correct doomsday models, but this is
        only under normal circumstances… The direction of our universe does not
        follow the most primitive laws of nature. Long ago, our universe was
        modified by a final civilization, and the fundamental laws of the
        Information Form changed. On the day of the end of our universe, what
        awaits us is not the heat death of the universe or the Big Crunch, but a
        phenomenon called the Great Reboot."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"The Great Reboot?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">The three of them were confused.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        It was not that the scientific research community did not have similar
        speculations, but it was not the mainstream theory. Without conclusive
        sources, most of the evidence came from unknown items created by the
        information state disturbance. For example, the Virtual Mutiny Virus
        from back then was suspected to be from a civilization before the Great
        Reboot. However, it was not enough to be ironclad evidence, because it
        was not certain if it was an earlier civilization or a civilization from
        the unexplored universe. Thus, Marbruce and the other two were not
        unfamiliar with this term. They were only confused as to why Han Xiao
        was so certain of the existence of the Great Reboot. Han Xiao looked at
        the three of them and said slowly,
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "The ‘Great Reboot' I'm talking about is different from what you guys
        understand… The final civilization's modification of the underlying laws
        of the universe has caused the universe to deviate from the laws of the
        natural end. Therefore, the time of the end has been brought forward by
        a lot, and every Great Reboot is a brand new Iteration. New
        civilizations reproduce in the universe that has returned to zero.
        However, due to the shortening of development time, the strength of each
        of the iteration civilizations is infinitely lower than the Final
        Civilization that had initially established the Great Reboot." "So, this
        is bad news?" Marbruce pondered. "If that's the case, all civilizations
        will develop from the beginning, and no one will be able to survive the
        end of the universe and reach the so-called… what did that popular
        phrase say, transcend worldliness?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao shook his head and said, "This is the main point I want to talk
        about. Although the Great Reboot causes the universe to return to zero,
        things from different Iterations will be passed down to the new
        Iteration through special means, and this medium is the Sanctum that all
        of you are longing for."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">The three of them were stunned.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao continued, "The initial goal of the final civilization to
        modify the universe was to continue their civilization through a reboot.
        They failed, but it was not a waste of effort. The Sanctum was their
        legacy. It was originally a reserve storage for life tinders, but a
        special Information Form Mutation appeared during the changes of the
        Iterations and became the Sanctum today. This is the only thing that is
        known to not disappear during the Great Reboot.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "The purpose of the Sanctum is to store the Information Form state of
        the development of every Iteration, and during each Great Reboot, a
        portion of Information Form will be randomly integrated into the new
        iteration of the universe. Therefore, when the universe is rebooted, it
        will not be completely zero. Instead, its underlying laws will
        constantly undergo changes in the Iterations. In this way, the
        achievements of each iteration will be passed down to the later
        iterations. For example, the current secondary dimension world is the
        inheritance of a past Iteration and not a natural phenomenon."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "So, you're saying that… the universe we're living in now is not the
        most primitive universe but a world that has been changed countless
        times? The Sanctum is equivalent to a… uh, processor?" Louis probed.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao nodded. "More or less. Generations of civilizations treated the
        Sanctum as a way to get through the Great Reboot, so the Sanctum
        continued to develop all kinds of new functions. The Sanctum Revival is
        just one of them. The most important thing about the Sanctum is that it
        stored all the information of the Civilizations of the earlier
        Iterations, as well as their last words before the end of the world, all
        for future generations to refer to. This is a long relay that spanned
        countless Iterations, just for someone to break this cycle one day."
        Hearing this, the three of them were shocked. Although Han Xiao's tone
        was very calm, when they thought of the scene of generations of
        civilizations working together toward the same goal, they could not help
        but be stunned by such a grand undertaking. However, two seconds later,
        the three of them came to their senses, and their breathing suddenly
        became heavy.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At this moment, they suddenly realized that if what Black Star said was
        true, the information stored in the Sanctum would be an immeasurable
        amount of wealth.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As for Black Star, he could have held onto this wealth alone. If he did
        not say it, they would never have been able to get a share of it.
        However, he chose to say it instead of developing it himself. Was he
        that selfless?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        It was precisely because they had thought this through that the three of
        them were even more shocked. For a moment, they fell silent, silently
        digesting the shock in their hearts.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After a while, the Pope said hesitantly, "You want to work with us to
        develop the Sanctum, is it because you want to get through the Great
        Reboot? Although what you just said is indeed quite shocking, let me be
        direct. The so-called Great Reboot should be very far away from us,
        right? Isn't it too early to worry about this…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Hearing this, Han Xiao smiled faintly. "You think it's early?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Hmm…" Seeing this, the Pope could not help but widen his eyes in
        shock." Could it be that the end of our universe is coming, and the
        Great Reboot is here?".
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">The other two trembled in shock and disbelief.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "It wasn't easy for us to defeat the World Tree Civilization, and we
        enjoyed a rare moment of relaxation. I didn't expect…" Marbruce had
        mixed feelings.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, Han Xiao shook his head and said, "You're mistaken. It's still
        too early for us to reach the end of this Iteration."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">The three of them heaved a sigh of relief.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, before they could completely relax, Han Xiao suddenly said
        something shocking, stunning them.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"But you've already been rebooted."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">As soon as he finished speaking…</p>
      <p class="calibre3">The Pope was stunned.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">"What do you mean?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Four times." Han Xiao raised four fingers and said slowly, "Our
        universe has been rebooted four times… In the previous Iteration, you
        guys were the final civilizations. You guys used an Information Form
        Stripping Plan and successfully passed the Great Reboot, but you did not
        really enter the new universe of the next iteration. Instead, you guys
        became a sealed dark universe that cycled and restarted on its own… In
        other words, you guys have died a few times, but you don't know it yet!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">The three of them were dumbfounded.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        During this period of time, Han Xiao had been trying to gain access to
        the First Sanctum. Every time he went in and out, the time he spent
        became shorter and shorter. When his access reached level fifteen, the
        flow of time finally converged. The time ratio of the main universe to
        the Sanctum was one to one, and the contents of the message board were
        finally unlocked
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At this point, Han Xiao finally understood everything. The messages from
        the bottom fourth to the last paragraph of the Sanctum were all left by
        the ‘three Universal Civilizations!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Celestial Star Alliance was located in the fifth last paragraph, and
        it was the Iteration just before the three Universal Civilizations. The
        fourth last section was the new Iteration after the Great Reboot, and
        the three Universal Civilizations were the final civilizations developed
        by the new Iteration. During that period, there was no such thing as the
        World Tree. The three Universal Civilizations slowly multiplied, and
        they finally discovered the Sanctum and learned all the information
        about Iteration.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Because the previous Celestial Star Alliance's plan was very desirable,
        the three Universal Civilizations inherited it and improved it, forming
        the ‘Information Form stripping plan'.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, the three Universal Civilizations at that time knew very well
        that with their accumulation, they did not have the absolute confidence
        to survive the Great Reboot and did not want to risk it all. Therefore,
        the true goal of this plan was not to completely overcome the Great
        Reboot but to buy more time for themselves. They wanted to strip away
        the Information Form state of the entire universe and try to imitate the
        operation of the Celestial Star Alliance. They wanted to exist in the
        secondary dimensions and the dark side of the universe in the New
        Iteration era and continuously reboot.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, the difference was that the three Universal Civilizations
        followed the mindset of the Celestial Star Alliance and made almost
        perfect improvements. Thus, they successfully peeled out the
        ‘Information Form state' of the entire Iteration and formed a closed
        dark side universe in the next Iteration. It existed based on the
        Information Form state and was like a ‘virtual' world, ‘developing side
        by side' at a faster time flow. It was like a parallel line, difficult
        to intersect with the ‘real' Iteration's main universe and difficult to
        interfere with each other.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After Han Xiao found out about the contents of the message board, he
        sorted out the time relationship. If the Celestial Star Alliance was the
        first iteration, then the three Universal Civilizations would be the
        final civilizations of the second iteration. They would activate the
        information form stripping plan and turn into the dark side universe of
        the third iteration, and the third iteration would be the true current
        iteration.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        It was also at this point that Han Xiao realized that the Sanctum would
        not leave any information form empty shells for the current Iteration,
        and there was no such thing as a ‘tombstone'. The three Universal
        Civilizations and the World Tree Civilization that he saw in the Sanctum
        were actually the second iteration remains. There was no content inside
        because they had been ‘stripped' and became the dark side universe of
        the third Iteration.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, the cycle of the dark side universe was not the same as the
        Celestial Star Alliance. Instead, it formed a ‘small reboot' pattern.
        The three Universal Civilizations of the Second Iteration used the
        characteristics of the Sanctum to add new patterns every time the
        universe was rebooted, allowing the dark side universe to be included in
        the influence of the Sanctum.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        What was different from the ‘Great Reboot' was that every ‘small reboot'
        in the dark universe did not return to zero but was formed based on a
        fixed Information Form state template, which meant that there would
        definitely be organizations like the three Universal Civilizations.
        Before the three Universal Civilizations came into contact with the
        Sanctum, their development trajectories were the same. Han Xiao called
        this situation ‘dark side Iteration'.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Therefore, every time the dark side universe went through a small
        reboot, there would be an improved version of the dark side Iteration.
        It was just that there was a chance for ‘Information Form Mutation' to
        occur. The three Universal Civilizations used this method to buy
        themselves more time, and they obtained more opportunities to test their
        luck.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, this plan could not bring about eternity. After some
        calculations, there was an upper limit to the information form stripping
        plan. Their dark side universe would only exist in the third iteration
        at most. If they were to go through the Great Reboot and enter the
        fourth iteration, then their dark side universe would disappear… unless
        they could enter the real iteration main universe from the dark side
        universe and turn from ‘virtual' to ‘real'.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Therefore, after the three Universal Civilizations successfully entered
        the dark side universe, their goal was to break the seal of the dark
        side universe and return to the real main universe of the third
        Iteration.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The third last to last messages on the Sanctum's message board
        represented the three dark side Iterations of the dark side universe.
        Currently, Han Xiao was in the fourth dark side Iteration, and these
        four dark side Iterations had all happened during the third Iteration.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Since the Sanctum was not affected by the Iterations, the three
        Universal Civilizations used the message board of the Sanctum to record
        the experience of each trial and error. They made ‘themselves' of the
        next dark side Iteration improve the path according to the previous
        experience, as well as create some key devices to improve the situation
        of the next dark side Iteration. This was the origin of the World Tree.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The three Universal Civilizations had added an Information Form
        Materialization device when they were in the second dark side Iteration
        (second last message), but in the third dark side Iteration, an
        information form mutation occurred. From a mechanical device, it turned
        into the World Tree with life force and went berserk… This was what Han
        Xiao experienced when he was a player in his previous life.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In the end, the three Universal Civilizations of the third dark side
        Iteration still opened the Sanctum and understood everything. Thus, they
        left behind the control terminal of the Information Form Materialization
        device. In the current fourth dark side Iteration, the Information Form
        mutation occurred and inherited the nature of restraint. But there was a
        change in its manifestation which became the World Tree's natural enemy,
        which was also the Pivotal Snake.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        On the other hand, in the second dark side Iteration, the three
        Universal Civilizations had used the Information Form Materialization
        device that had yet to mutate and failed in the end. They had discovered
        that the reason was that there was a bridge that lacked the ‘True
        State'. Han Xiao had also figured out the concept of the ‘True State',
        which was actually the Information Form carrier that existed in the true
        universe.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In other words, the dark side universe had to form an Information Form
        connection with the true universe. Only by being able to interfere with
        each other would the Information Form Materialization device work.
        Therefore, the three Universal Civilizations of the second dark side
        Iteration launched a plan, trying to change the underlying laws of the
        next dark side Iteration, causing the two ‘parallel lines' of the dark
        side universe and the true universe to deviate and finally intersect.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In the end, when the third dark side Iteration arrived, the underlying
        laws of the dark side universe changed, and they successfully projected
        themselves into ‘reality'. They successfully obtained a part of the
        Information Form carrier of the true universe, which was the existence
        of ‘players'. Through ‘log in', these individuals who lived in the true
        universe turned their ‘True State' into ‘information form state' and
        were pulled into the dark side universe to form the Information Form
        interface. This was everything that Han Xiao and countless players had
        experienced in his previous life.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, the World Tree went berserk in the third dark side Iteration.
        After the World Tree War in his previous life, the three Universal
        Civilizations obtained the Sanctum pathway from the Holy Accord
        Organization and learned everything. They inherited the heritage of
        countless civilizations, and their technology improved by leaps and
        bounds. At a level that the players could not come into contact with,
        the three Universal Civilizations came up with a new plan. They gathered
        the power of civilizations and built the ‘control terminal' of the World
        Tree. At the same time, they lowered the cost of the World Tree going
        berserk in the fourth dark side Iteration. Other than that, due to the
        players' version updates, the three Universal Civilizations of the third
        dark side Iteration felt that the True State' bridge was not stable
        enough, so they decided to spend a lot of resources strengthening the
        ‘True State' connection with the next dark side Iteration.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Because the dark side universe and the true universe had already formed
        a preliminary Information Form interference, the three Universal
        Civilizations decided to build a stable interference bridge instead of
        intermittent bridge-like logins. The only targets they could choose were
        these individual Information Form records that had already been logged
        into the dark side universe, so they randomly selected a target to enter
        the dark side universe completely, forming a stable connection.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As long as this idea was correct, the dark side universe would be able
        to reverse-transform the ‘Information Form state' to the ‘True State'
        through this interference bridge, break free from the seal, and return
        to the true universe… In a more understandable way, it would be like
        installing a carrier bag for the so-called ‘reality', which contained
        the entire dark side universe and the entire Galaxy World.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This was the truth that Han Xiao had learned from the Sanctum, and what
        happened after that was not recorded on the message board.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After knowing all of this, he had a rough guess about what happened
        after that. He suspected that the reason why he had ‘transmigrated' was
        actually because he had been randomly selected as the ‘stable
        interference bridge' that strengthened the Information Form entanglement
        between the dark side universe and the true universe.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        His own Information Form state had been completely captured, and he had
        come to this dark universe from the ‘reality'. Therefore, his ‘real'
        self had disappeared, and he no longer had any information about
        himself. He had never seen his other self, who should be a ‘player', all
        these years. Han Xiao suspected that this was the reason.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As for the dark side universe of the fourth dark side Iteration, it
        caused the time of the true universe to regress by ten years. Han Xiao
        did not know the reason, but he guessed that it was because the third
        dark side Iteration had more Information Form interference with the true
        universe when it was ‘capturing' him, which affected the other party's
        time. However, he did not know if this was a reversal of time across the
        entire universe or only across a small area. However, from another point
        of view, this was also proof that the dark side universe used the ‘True
        State' to create Information Form entanglements that could already cause
        a substantial change to the true universe.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Now, Han Xiao had roughly pieced together all the reasons from the
        Sanctum records and his own guesses. In his opinion, this series of
        guesses was more than seventy percent reliable.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao hid part of his speculations and explained the secret.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After hearing all of this, only shock and disbelief could be seen on the
        faces of Marbruce, Louis, and the Pope. They looked at Han Xiao with
        their mouths slightly open, completely dumbfounded.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"This, this…"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">The Pope was dumbfounded.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Although they were the rulers of the three Universal Civilizations and
        had seen countless storms, the information that Han Xiao had just given
        them had already exceeded their acceptance range. After a long time,
        Marbruce turned to Louis and said with hesitation,
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Um… did you understand?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">"I didn't either…" Marbruce replied blankly.</p>

      </h1>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The three of them took a while to digest the information that Han Xiao
        had given them.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Louis hesitated.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Black Star, are you trying to trick us…"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Unfortunately, not this time." Han Xiao shrugged.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Marbruce had a strange expression on his face. "In other words, we are
        all people who died and reincarnated a few times. This is equivalent to
        being trapped in a sealed secondary dimension. Our final goal is to
        break through this secondary dimension and return to the main universe?"
        "Hmm, although the difference is quite big you can understand it that
        way." Han Xiao blinked.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "It means that everything our civilization has experienced from the
        beginning is a predestined development trajectory. It has already
        happened a few times, and it was ‘personally' built by us?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Something like that." Han Xiao nodded.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Let me recover…"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Pope pressed his forehead and felt his blood pressure rising.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        All of a sudden, the three of them felt as though the values that they
        had formed in their lives had been shattered. In the face of such a
        situation, they realized that all the political and military problems
        that they usually considered became insignificant.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"So, we're that powerful…"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Marbruce was still in shock.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao ruthlessly interrupted his imagination. "It's not that you guys
        are strong, but the final three Universal Civilizations are. Compared to
        the ‘you' of the past, you guys are like three little brothers. Don't
        flatter the three Universal Civilizations of now. Without me, you guys
        would still not have known anything."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">The three of them felt a little hurt.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Although this is the truth, can't you let us indulge a little?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, no matter what, the three of them still felt like they had been
        blessed by their ancestors after learning about these secrets.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Black Star, you really gave us a scare…" Marbruce smiled bitterly." My
        mind is in a mess right now. I don't even know what to do.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao raised his brows and joked, "Didn't you say you've seen all
        kinds of storms? Have you seen this before?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Ahem, I think we should talk about how to break the seal of the dark
        side universe and return to the true universe…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Pope's face darkened, and he quickly changed the topic, not wanting
        to admit that he was too careless.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, Han Xiao did not give a direct answer. Instead, he slowly said,
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "I know you guys still have some doubts in your hearts, thinking that I
        made this up. When you guys enter the Sanctum and confirm that the
        information I'm talking about is correct, we'll talk about what to do
        next… By the way, let me remind you guys, the Sanctum requires
        authorization to access the Iteration messages. You guys will only know
        the basic information when you enter the Sanctum for the first time,
        which is information like Iteration and Great Reboot. As for information
        like dark side Iteration and continuous reboot, you guys won't be able
        to see it for the time being. I only learned about these things after
        completely unlocking the authorization." "Oh, so it was like that…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The three of them had not witnessed the functions of the Sanctum with
        their own eyes, so they could only listen to Han Xiao's explanation.
        However, they believed most of it, because there was no need for Black
        Star to lie to them about something that could be so easily verified.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, Marbruce and the other two felt an itch in their hearts. This
        feeling was like watching a suspense movie. They had only seen the
        beginning, but Black Star knew all the details and did not tell them who
        the killer was. This made them very curious. However, the three of them
        did have some concerns, and they did not dare completely believe what
        Han Xiao said. They would only be at ease if they entered the Sanctum to
        take a look.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "I will send you the method to enter the Sanctum in a while. Also, I
        will give you three more sets of Sanctum keys. You can enter by
        yourselves, lest you say that I did something."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Han Xiao said casually.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He was the only one who could quickly create the Sanctum Keys. Even the
        three Universal Civilizations, which had plenty of resources, needed
        time to collect materials. Therefore, without his help, the three
        Universal Civilizations could not enter the Sanctum frequently. This was
        also the reason why he had the confidence to control the Sanctum and did
        not mind letting the three Universal Civilizations enter the Sanctum.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"That is the best."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The three of them hurriedly nodded like obedient children.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Alright, then you guys digest the truth of the universe and Iterations.
        I won't disturb you guys any longer. I'll send you the materials later."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Han Xiao nodded and hung up.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The remote projection disappeared, and the three of them looked at each
        other with different expressions.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "I didn't expect Black Star to bring such intelligence… If what he said
        is true, then our future plans will have to be reorganized."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "That's right. If the situation is true, then there's no point in us
        developing peacefully here. We have to break through fate and fulfill
        the wishes of our past lives, entering the so-called true universe."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Let's not talk about this for now. Let's start from the beginning…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The three of them gathered their heads together and started discussing.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Supers Holy Land, Leader's Office.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao's eyes flashed, and he returned to his room. Complicated
        emotions appeared in his eyes.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He had pretended to be confident and calm in front of the three
        Universal Civilizations. In fact, when he found out about the truth from
        the Sanctum, he was also shocked, but it also solved many of his doubts.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In fact, Han Xiao still had many of his own secrets that he had not told
        the heads of the three Universal Civilizations just now. For example,
        the existence of the interface meant that there were three
        possibilities.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The first was that the interface was a special product formed when the
        true state of the true universe was transformed into the Information
        Form state of the dark side universe. It was like when a
        high-dimensional object descended into a low dimension, it had a special
        advantage. It was like how a piece of paper hid no secrets to humans,
        providing information that low-dimensional objects could not contain.
        The second possibility was that it was the product of Information Form
        mutation.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The third guess was that the three Universal Civilizations of the second
        dark side Iteration had projected the ‘information cluster' of the dark
        side universe into the true universe through ‘login', and the interface
        was the necessary medium to complete this step. It could be considered a
        special ‘retractor' or ‘recorder'. Therefore, it might have been
        specially created by the three Universal Civilizations to ensure that
        the True State would remain in the dark side universe for a long time.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, no matter which one it was, the interface was something unique
        to the dark side universe and could not enter the true universe. The
        evidence that made Han Xiao speculate this was that when he entered the
        Sanctum, the interface would disappear. Because the Sanctum did not only
        exist in the dark side universe, the interface lost its effect.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As for his ‘special' interface, Han Xiao had a guess.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In his opinion, this was either because the three Universal
        Civilizations of the third dark side Iteration wanted to build a stable
        interference bridge and deliberately created life support for the
        ‘Information Form Individual' who had completely entered the dark side
        universe, ensuring that he could live ‘stably' in the dark side universe
        and reduce the chances of him dying due to various accidents, or it was
        the result of the Information Form mutation on the normal interface in
        the dark side Iteration.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        According to the various performances of the interface, Han Xiao was
        more inclined toward the former. When the interface triggered a mission,
        more information would usually be revealed in the mission introduction.
        Because the development trajectory of the dark universe was almost
        fixed, the three Universal Civilizations of the third dark side
        Iteration could modify the interface into something similar to a
        ‘Prophet'. Of course, this did not exclude the fact that their interface
        had the hidden principle of monitoring the entire dark universe.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In addition, when the players went online (the True States
        Interference), he would be able to enter the players' forums through the
        interface and spy on the communication between the ‘True States'. During
        the version update period, the forums were also frozen for him. From
        this perspective, the special interface on him was indeed like an
        important medium and channel to communicate with the True States.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This reminded Han Xiao of the two Information Form threads he had seen
        on the interface when he used the Information Form Obliteration vision.
        One was connected to him, while the other extended infinitely. Now that
        he thought about it, the connection on this end probably represented the
        entire dark side universe. This seemed to support the idea.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        On the other hand, Han Xiao also speculated about the theory behind the
        flow of time in the version update. In the mainstream scientific
        theories of the Galaxy, time was relative, not absolute. From this point
        of view, based on the content of the message board in the Sanctum, he
        felt that the time of the dark universe and the true universe did not
        have any connection, only the difference in relative speed.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The true universe was the foundation of the third Iteration. The dark
        side universe had to depend on it to exist, but the relative time flow
        of the dark side universe was faster and went through reboots again and
        again without affecting the other side. However, when the players came
        online and caused the dark side universe and the true universe to become
        entangled in Information Form, the flow of time between the two sides
        was locked. The time flow of the dark side universe and the true
        universe passed at a stable ratio, which was one to six… The reason
        behind this was that the true universe still occupied the dominant
        position, and the players whose ‘foundation' existed in the true
        universe would not be affected.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        When the True State of the players' temporary logins disappeared, the
        level of Information Form interference plummeted, and the flow of time
        in the dark side universe would be disconnected from the true universe…
        This conjecture showed that the version update would only take one or
        two days for the players while many years would have passed in the
        Galaxy World. Han Xiao felt that this was quite possible. He even
        suspected that starting from the second dark side Iteration, the
        frequency of the Information Form mutation in the dark side universe was
        very likely the change brought about by the third dark side Iteration's
        introduction of the True States… If the true universe and Sanctum were
        seen as existences of a higher dimension, then the projected projection
        would produce distortions, and a ‘surreal' phenomenon would occur,
        causing the third dark side Iteration's Information Form Materialization
        device to become the World Tree, and the fourth dark side Iteration's
        control terminal to become the Pivotal Snake.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Other than this reason, perhaps the dark side universe is the same as
        the Celestial Star Alliance Dimension. Only an external Information Form
        carrier can greatly change its development trajectory, bringing new
        variables and accidents… Even if the dark side universe is not a rigid
        cycle, such variables might still be needed."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Han Xiao's expression changed.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Although many of these theories were speculations based on the truth
        revealed by the Sanctum messages, he felt that they were very likely.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Even if this is a relay across Iterations, every civilization wants to
        be the last one. As long as there's a glimmer of hope, every
        civilization wants to continue surviving, and no one wants to go
        extinct. It's understandable for the three Universal Civilizations to do
        this, but…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Han Xiao shook his head with mixed feelings.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        If all his deductions were correct, then he would be the hope of the
        entire dark side universe…
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">But to him, this was a multiple-choice question.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-1451">
      <h1 class="h" itemprop="headline">
        Chapter 1452: Choice and Entry<span hidden="" class="calibre1">
          |
        </span>
      </h1>
      <p class="calibre3">Crack…</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao opened the cabinet and took out a box of unopened cigarettes
        from it. He tore open the packaging and took out a black cigarette
        wrapped in gold patterns. He swiped at it with his finger, and an
        electric spark lit it up. He held it in his mouth and slowly took a
        puff. Green smoke rose and covered his complicated expression, and his
        disappointed eyes could be seen through the smoke. Ever since he entered
        the galaxy, Han Xiao had basically quit smoking. It had been almost a
        hundred years since he had last tasted a smoke, but today, he lit up a
        cigarette.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This was not an easy choice. If his hometown was the real universe of
        the current dynasty, then once the dark side universe returned, it would
        be like a dove taking over a magpie's nest, and countless powerful
        civilizations would sweep through the galaxy. Han Xiao did not know if
        there were any advanced civilizations in the real universe of the
        current dynasty because his hometown was only a surface-level
        civilization and could not explore the entire universe. However, his
        hometown was an information interface, so it would definitely be the
        first to face a change.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        To his hometown, this was either a good thing or a bad thing. The only
        thing he was certain of was that his hometown would never develop freely
        again. It would definitely be interfered with by the advanced
        civilizations, just like the various small civilizations and surface
        civilizations in the galactic society.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, the three Universal Civilizations, which had already gone
        through four dark side changes, were already half a step into the real
        universe. They were only one step away from the real universe and they
        had a chance to truly get through the Reboot. This was the ultimate
        dream passed down by the Final Civilizations after countless
        generations. Now that he had the ability to help them succeed… should he
        watch the efforts of the three Universal Civilizations go to waste? Or
        should he give them the final push?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">ISV</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Although Han Xiao was conflicted, he knew that he already had an answer
        in his heart. Revealing the Sanctum information to the three Universal
        Civilizations was to help him make up his mind not to turn back.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This was a great achievement that was supported by countless
        generations. It was also a great honor for him to be one of them.
        Furthermore, it was also related to the survival of the universe. The
        time he had spent in the galactic society had long exceeded the length
        of his life in the real universe. It was impossible for him to not have
        any feelings for the galactic society.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Furthermore, with Han Xiao's current experience, he felt that the
        possibility of his hometown becoming the current Final Civilization of
        this iteration was extremely low. Perhaps even becoming a Star System
        Civilization would be an extravagant hope.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In the middle of the 21st century, before he entered the dark side
        universe, the societal problems in his hometown were already very acute.
        It was like a train that had been overloaded for many years, with all
        kinds of failures coming one after another.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Due to the complex geopolitical situation, the entire civilization was
        wasting precious' birthplace resources', and the efficiency of resources
        was low. There were many problems that could only be solved before
        entering the interstellar era, and only then would the cost be
        minimized. Their hometown did not have an efficient collective will when
        their technology was low, and once such an opportunity was missed, it
        would be difficult to see it again. As the saying goes, a small boat is
        easy to turn around. The larger the body, the harder it is to turn back,
        and it would be difficult to make any changes. Any slight movement might
        trigger an internal crisis that could destroy the entire civilization.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Although his hometown might have a chance to turn around in the future,
        according to the trend before Han Xiao entered the dark side universe,
        the development of his hometown, if analyzed on the scale of
        civilization and the universe, was truly in a precarious situation.
        Therefore, after the birth of the virtual network in his previous life,
        it quickly became a haven for countless people to escape from reality.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        According to this trend, the final outcome of his hometown might be
        natural death or being destroyed or captured by an unknown foreign
        civilization. In his eyes, most of the areas around his hometown did not
        have the qualifications to become the overlord of the universe… unless
        there were no competitors.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, due to the existence of the Sanctum, this was clearly
        impossible.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Therefore, Han Xiao felt that since it would be difficult for his
        hometown to become the ‘winner' of a single era, when the conversion of
        the dark universe was completed&mdash;while it might bring about
        risks&mdash;it would also bring along the successful plan to get through
        the Great Reboot. This would mean unlimited resources and techniques.
        The current final Civilizations might not have matured yet, and the
        three Universal Civilizations would most likely replace it and rule it
        for a long time. This would be somewhat unfair to the current Iterated
        Civilizations, but in this regard, no civilization would not give in to
        be the leader of the universe. It was very difficult for the weak to
        choose their own fate… Of course, there was also the possibility of a
        powerful civilization existing in the real universe, but the
        civilization level of their hometown was too low for him to be aware of
        it.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In addition, Han Xiao felt that he had come to the Dark Side Universe
        because of the three Universal Civilizations. Perhaps he should return
        the favor.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"In the end, I still have my own selfish motives…"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao narrowed his eyes and suddenly shook his head.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He had never thought of himself as a selfless person. Apart from these
        concerns that involved the big picture, there were also reasons for him
        to choose to convert the Dark Side Universe.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He seemed to have used up all his luck to become the ‘Stable
        Interference Bridge' that was randomly selected. If he did not do
        anything, the Dark Side Universe would only experience another round of
        reboot and might not have much of an impact on this place. However, in
        the next Dark Side, the Dark Side Universe would pull in a new True Form
        carrier and become a new ‘Stable Interference Bridge' to replace him.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Due to the uniqueness of his identity, Han Xiao could not guarantee that
        he would become a member of the Dark Side Universe's development
        trajectory after the Dark Side underwent another iteration. Becoming a
        Transcendent might not mean that he could literally transcend an
        iteration. The ‘Small Reboot' of the Dark Side Universe might still
        cause him to disappear… Rather than saying that his choice was to save
        the Dark Side Universe, it would be more accurate to say that it was to
        save himself. Therefore, this might be his only chance. Han Xiao did not
        want to gamble. "Phew… so this is an all-out invasion?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        With this in mind, Han Xiao calmed himself down and stopped smoking. He
        extinguished the cigarette roll that was only one-third burnt in the
        ashtray without hesitation.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        A few days later, in a certain military-restricted area in the Central
        Galaxy.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Three small spaceships hovered outside the space fortress, ready to go.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In the military command tower on the side, the remote projection of the
        three Universal Civilizations' Ruler stood in front of the window,
        staring at the three spaceships outside with a nervous and expectant
        expression. The operators in the room were adjusting the parameters in
        front of the instruments.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This time, Han Xiao's remote projection appeared in the room, attracting
        the attention of three people. "How's the preparation going?" "We have
        already filled up the Sanctum key in the synthesis device according to
        the method you provided," Marbruce replied immediately.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao nodded. "What about the candidates to enter the Sanctum?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Louis said with a deep voice, "We have all chosen a spaceship full of
        elites, and their loyalty is reliable. Our side will be led by Oulou,
        and the Crimson Dynasty will be led by Clotti."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao looked at the Pope and said, "What about you? Are you going to
        let Wuornos take the lead?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "I originally planned to let Wuornos enter the Sanctum, but he happened
        to have left some time ago, so I found another direct descendant." The
        Pope shook his head.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"…Is that so? What a twist of events."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Han Xiao's expression was complicated.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Due to the fact that he needed to accumulate the authority of the
        Sanctum, he did not know if the Arcane Church would allow Wuornos to
        become the Sanctum Explorer even after he returned…
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Great, he had missed out on another huge benefit. He always felt that
        Wuornos seemed to miss out on everything good. This guy was really
        unlucky.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Seeing that Han Xiao did not speak, Louis said, "If there's no problem,
        shall we begin?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Go ahead, I'll watch from here." Han Xiao nodded.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Marbruce nodded and gave the order.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Very soon, a few rays of light shot out from the military fortress and
        gathered in midair, slowly turning into three Sanctums. The Sanctums Key
        that Han Xiao had provided each led to different Sanctums, and they were
        all opened at the same time.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao had seen this scene many times and did not have much of a
        reaction. However, the heads of the three Universal Civilizations stared
        with their eyes wide open, staring at the changes in the scenery outside
        the window. It was as though they wanted to memorize all the details of
        the Sanctum passageway.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The next moment, the three spaceships started moving and entered
        different passages of the Sanctum. The Sanctum's light then spun and
        contracted before disappearing from everyone's sight.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Only at this moment did the three Universal Civilizations' leaders
        relax. They heaved a sigh of relief and were filled with anticipation
        and anxiety. They were afraid that something would happen during their
        trip to the Sanctum, or they might not bring back the information they
        wanted. "This is their first time entering the Sanctum. Their authority
        is very low, and the time flow is very different. It will take them a
        very long time to return."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Han Xiao explained.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Marbruce nodded absent-mindedly. Suddenly, he thought of something and
        turned to look at Han Xiao.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Since it will take a long time for them to return, let's not just
        blindly wait for them. We might as well use the time to solve some
        important problems." Han Xiao raised his brows. "What do you want?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Initially, we wanted to wait until the galactic society recovered more
        than half of its strength before launching a military operation against
        the Star Alliance. However, the intelligence you brought disrupted our
        strategic plans, so I think it's better to solve this hidden danger as
        soon as possible… However, we alone cannot proceed with the highest
        efficiency, so…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">SOO</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "So, you want my help?" Han Xiao narrowed his eyes and continued.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "That's what I meant." Marbruce nodded quickly. Han Xiao turned to look
        at the other two. "You guys have the same idea?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"I hope Your Excellency Black Star can help."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Louis and the Pope nodded as well.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Ever since they knew the truth about the Universe Iterations, they had
        become more relaxed. They were all in the same boat now, so helping the
        other party meant helping themselves, and they were no longer as
        reserved as before. They were just short of hugging Han Xiao's thigh and
        calling him daddy.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "…You guys are really impolite. Let me do some research then."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Looking at the three of them, Han Xiao's mouth twitched.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Originally, he did not want to interfere in this matter. However, given
        the current situation, if he did not settle the Star Alliance as soon as
        possible, there would be more variables in the plan of converting the
        dark universe. It was indeed not good.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Han Xiao thought about it and said slowly,</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "If I can solve this problem with less bloodshed, that would be the
        best. I hope that my interference will allow them to accept reality
        faster…"

        "What? Black Star and the three Universal Civilizations have privately
        agreed to open the Sanctum?!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The surprised voice of the leader of the Star Arc sounded in the
        conference room of the Super Star Cluster Alliance. A civilization
        leader nodded with a solemn expression. "I received some news. Black
        Star seems to have really shared the Sanctum information with the three
        Universal Civilizations."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Is the news accurate?" The Star Arc Leader's expression turned solemn.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Very reliable."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Hearing this, the expressions of all the Super Star Cluster leaders
        changed.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The three Universal Civilizations did not cover up Black Star's actions
        of sharing the Sanctum. This was not a secret that no one could not find
        out, but they did not disclose it to the outside world either. After
        knowing about their current situation, they did not have such thoughts
        for the time being. If not, they would have advertised it in the past to
        increase their reputation.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The composition of the three Sanctum keys that Han Xiao had given them,
        as well as the method of entering the Sanctum, were the three Universal
        Civilizations' top-secret information. Outsiders would not be able to
        find out about it, so the Super Star Cluster Alliance only knew about
        the appearance of the two sides cooperating to open the Sanctum. They
        did not know the exact reason and details.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "This is really strange. Now, the three Universal Civilizations, the
        Supers Holy Land, and we are already in a tripartite situation. The
        Sanctum is the core strength of the Supers Holy Land. Isn't Black Star
        helping the enemy? What does he mean by this?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The leader was confused. "Indeed, I don't understand either. Why does
        Black Star need to share the Sanctuary with the three Universal
        Civilizations?" Another civilization leader was puzzled. "In the past,
        when Beyond Grade As still existed as organizations, they did not share
        the Sanctum's information even when facing the suppression of the three
        Universal Civilizations. Now, the Supers Holy Land is already a huge
        force, comparable to the three Universal Civilizations. Why did they
        give out the Sanctum's information instead? Could it be that some chip
        has fallen into the hands of the three Universal Civilizations?" "I feel
        that it's impossible for Black Star to be threatened by the three
        Universal Civilizations. There must be other reasons. Black Star might
        have other plans… We can't even rule out the possibility of them forming
        deep strategic cooperation."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "The World Tree has already been dealt with, what other strategic
        cooperation can they have? Could it be that they are fighting that
        third-party infiltrator? But is there a need for that? Both the three
        Universal Civilizations and Black Star can deal with the Star Alliance
        alone."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At this moment, one of the leaders hesitated for a moment and said
        carefully,
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "…Have you ever thought that they might be working together against us?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">The room fell silent.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After a long time, the leader of the Star Arc swallowed his saliva and
        said, "Um… I don't think that's possible. We're lubricants between them.
        They probably won't gang up on us…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "I don't think so…" Someone was worriedly singing the opposite tune."
        Could it be that our attitude of waiting for a good price was too
        blatant and angered both sides?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Hearing that, everyone panicked. After the structure of the war was
        established, they would circle around the three Universal Civilizations
        and the Supers Holy Land, jumping around to maintain balance. According
        to their initial analysis, the three Universal Civilizations needed to
        form an alliance with them to suppress the Supers Holy Land. Therefore,
        they would definitely ‘change their ways' and use a lot of benefits to
        rope them in. This was also the case in the early stages. Finally, they
        were no longer suppressed and had the space to develop freely. Using a
        different method, they achieved what they initially wanted to achieve
        through migration. Logically speaking, if not for the rise of the Supers
        Holy Land, the Super Star Cluster would not have been able to do as they
        wished. Black Star had contributed to this, but because of the balance,
        they could not stay as close as they wanted to the Supers Holy Land.
        Otherwise, the three Universal Civilizations would definitely explode.
        Thus, they could only temporarily put aside the alliance agreement with
        Black Star and turn it into superficial cooperation.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Supers Holy Land did not say anything about this. The Super Star
        Cluster Alliance had even specially called Black Star to apologize, and
        the other party did not seem to mind. Thus, the Super Star Cluster
        alliance had always been at ease and felt that this route was not a
        problem. They hoped to maintain a good cooperative relationship with
        both sides… But now that Black Star and the three Universal
        Civilizations had played such a card, they immediately felt uncertain.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        It felt as if there were two enemies who were not on good terms with
        each other, and he had maintained a good relationship with both of them.
        Like a sticker for the three of them, he let everyone play together.
        However, one day, the two enemies suddenly made up for no reason. They
        put their arms around each other's shoulders and did not bring him along
        to play. Instead, he became the third person, isolated. This was very
        uncomfortable.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "I think we need to analyze it, but we can't rule out the possibility
        that such a factor is involved. We need to consider our attitude towards
        the Supers Holy Land and the three Universal Civilizations. We can't be
        too cold," the leader of the Star Arc said with a heavy tone.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The higher-ups of the Super Star Cluster felt their hearts turn weak the
        more they thought about it. They were too suspicious and scared
        themselves.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In the unexplored universe, Star Alliance capital. "Ever since the World
        Tree fully invaded, the three Universal Civilizations have been in an
        increasingly difficult situation. In the past two years, they have lost
        almost six percent of their territory. I thought that they would be able
        to hold on for a few decades, but it seems like I've overestimated them.
        The three Universal Civilizations will not be able to withstand the
        attack of the World Tree at all. At this rate, the three Universal
        Civilizations will definitely be defeated in five to six years, the
        longest in thirteen to fourteen years!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In the meeting room, the leader of the Star Alliance and the leaders of
        the various civilizations had smiles on their faces. The room was filled
        with happiness.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        For more than a year since the World Tree invaded the interstellar
        society, they had been living a very happy life. Even their footsteps
        were light. Every time they read the "battle report" sent by the spies,
        they would look forward to the next episode because they were always
        full of surprises.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The more miserable the galactic society was, the happier they would be!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The leader of the Star Alliance knocked on the table and said with a
        smile, "Over the past year, the three Universal Civilizations were
        almost completely defeated by the World Tree. Black Star was heavily
        injured by the ambush and had exceeded the limits of his Indestructible
        Body. He had no choice but to fall into a deep sleep and slowly
        recuperate. Thus, the Sanctum Revival was temporarily terminated. The
        intel says that he is now the spiritual pillar of the galactic society
        to resist the external enemies. Once Black Star falls, the morale of the
        Galactic Alliance Army will collapse, and they will be forced to retreat
        on the battlefield… Therefore, it is obvious that without Black Star,
        the galactic allied forces are just a motley crew."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Hehe, not bad, not bad." The leader of the Lore Civilization, Savignes,
        chuckled. "Furthermore, the reports from the first two episodes said
        that the mother planets of the three Universal Civilizations were
        attacked frequently and had no choice but to let many of the upper
        echelons take refuge. During the voyage, the Crimson Dynasty's spaceship
        was ambushed on a large scale, and the current leader, Marbruce, was cut
        in half at the waist, dying without a complete corpse. The previous
        Dynasty Ruler, Urranrell, was captured by the members of the World Tree,
        and it was said that the pillar of the nation, Clotti, went alone to
        save her. In the end, he was captured, but his will was firm. Thus, the
        World Tree gathered the members and violated Urranrell repeatedly in
        front of him, destroying Clotti's will before the World Tree devoured
        him and turned him into a slave…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Speaking of which, the peak Beyond Grade As of the galactic society
        either died or were injured. Manison's true body was exposed, and he was
        turned into a slave by the World Tree. All of his assets were used to
        support the enemy. Kasuyi's mind was shattered, and he became a fool.
        Wuornos was forced to participate in the battle, and the Church's
        National Treasure was almost shattered…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        These battle reports were all fabricated by Han Xiao's order to the
        lurkers who had already jumped out of hiding. He even added quite a
        number of personal gossips into them, which made it quite "exciting". As
        for the people involved in the battle report, they did not know that Han
        Xiao was making things up about them.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The members of the Star Alliance talked about the good news in the
        previous war reports with great interest. They wanted to see the
        suffering of the people of the galactic society and laugh. After
        chatting for a while, the leader of the Star Alliance calmed down and
        knocked on the table.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Although the defeat of the three Universal Civilizations is set in
        stone, and we have finally gotten rid of a huge threat, the World Tree
        is a new threat. When the war ends, we still need to pay attention to
        the World Tree."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "That's right. The failure of the three Universal Civilizations has
        proven how terrifying they are. Even if we reach the height of the three
        Universal Civilizations, we still won't be their match."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Yeah, but time stands with us. As long as we keep developing, sooner or
        later&mdash;".
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The leader of the Star Alliance was about to look forward to the future
        to cheer everyone on when the meeting room was suddenly pushed open.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Bang!</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        A secretary rushed in anxiously with an anxious look on his face. His
        eyes were filled with fear.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Leaders, something bad has happened. We found traces of the World Tree
        army. The World Tree is attacking!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"What?!"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Crash</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The expressions of all the Star Alliance's upper echelons changed
        drastically as they stood up!

      <p class="calibre3">Within the Star Alliance, the Margus Star System.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        A long and narrow spatial rift cut through the starry sky like a knife
        cutting open the belly of the universe, splattering out endless green
        tides.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Countless World Tree battleships flew out from the wormhole and formed
        an army. They turned into dense streams of light and dispersed in all
        directions, attacking the planets on the star map.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The World Tree fleet was traveling at an extremely fast speed. Before
        long, a prosperous planet was in sight. The defense troops of this
        planet had already taken off and were distributed in outer space, ready
        to fight against the invasion.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Buzz!</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At this moment, there was a flash of light in the distance. A huge wave
        of starships covered in starlight approached rapidly. The outer armor of
        the starships was engraved with the Star Alliance's insignia. This was
        the military's rapid support unit. They were stationed at the nearby
        military fortress and were in charge of the daily security in the area.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In the main starship of the Star Alliance's rapid support troops, the
        middle-aged commander with a strong temperament gripped the edge of the
        table tightly with both hands. He gritted his teeth and looked at the
        enemy troops outside the window, countless times more numerous than his
        own. His heart was in agony as he let out a hoarse roar:
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Unit 17 and 18, fall down. Immediately organize the people to board the
        ship and escape. The rest… attack! Stall for time!" As soon as the order
        was given, the rapid support troops immediately charged towards the
        incoming World Tree.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Facing an unrivaled opponent, the Star Alliance's fleet still chose to
        counterattack. This scene was very tragic. It was like an isolated and
        helpless troop enduring the endless encirclement of countless enemies.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, the difference in strength would not be reduced because of
        this. Their fearlessness could not stop the spreading of the green tide.
        The world-destroying green tide did not stop and easily drowned the
        armed fleet. The Star Alliance fleet's counterattack only caused a small
        ripple before disappearing into the endless green tide.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Roots tore through the sky and pierced into the flourishing planet like
        straws, devouring the matter and energy inside and turning them into
        their own nourishment.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In the flagship of the World Tree fleet, the Heart Tree King looked down
        at the planet with a glimmer in his eyes. Vast psychic energy had
        already covered the entire planet, hypnotizing all living beings to give
        up on escaping and voluntarily enter the roots to become a member of the
        World Tree.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Heart Tree King shook his head as he watched the last few Star
        Alliance battleships explode into pieces under the concentrated fire of
        the World Tree fleet.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"It's just a futile struggle…"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He turned to look at the countless soldiers in the cabin and saw a
        feverish look on each of their faces. War was their specialty.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Sensing the Heart Tree King's gaze, everyone raised their arms and
        shouted.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"For the mother tree! For Father God!"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After Black Star subdued the World Tree, he became the ‘Father God' in
        the hearts of all the members of the World Tree. His will was above the
        Mother Tree's.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Heart Tree King muttered to himself before retracting his gaze and
        looking at the starry sky. His gaze seemed to be able to penetrate the
        endless distance and lock onto the mother planet of the Star Alliance.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In the conference room in the Star Alliance's capital.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Unlike the joyous atmosphere a few days ago, the room was filled with
        gloom, fear, despair, anxiety, and other negative emotions. In the past
        few days, news of the World Tree's invasion broke out in various parts
        of their territory. It was as if the entire Star Alliance was in danger
        overnight and countless planets had fallen.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The upper echelons of the Star Alliance were no longer as high-spirited
        as they were a few days ago. At this moment, they looked haggard and
        their clothes were in a mess. They had not slept or rested for the past
        few days as they argued intensely.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Isn't the World Tree Civilization still fighting with the three
        Universal Civilizations? Why did they invade us?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Star Alliance Leader frowned and looked exhausted. His eyes were
        bloodshot and his voice was extremely hoarse. Savignes trembled slightly
        and said with a shaking voice, "Could it be that the World Tree
        Civilization feels that they have already crippled the three
        civilizations and wants to fight on two fronts? What should we do?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">The upper echelons of the Star Alliance frowned.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        They thought that the three Universal Civilizations were still fighting
        the World Tree to the death, but because they had discovered their
        location, they had deployed a portion of their forces to fight with
        them. This feeling was like they were enjoying the sufferings of others,
        but the sufferings suddenly appeared on their own head.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "What else can we do? Since the World Tree is here, we can only resist!"
        Someone slammed the table to hide the fear in his heart.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Just as he said that, someone immediately objected and said loudly,
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "What fight! Even the three Universal Civilizations were no match for
        the World Tree, they were crippled in a few years. We can't defend our
        own territories at all. We should quickly migrate the refugees, preserve
        our tinders, and abandon our territories!" "How can we do that? At least
        we still have the strength to fight! The World Tree is wreaking havoc in
        my territory. As long as everyone sends out reinforcements, we will
        definitely be able to defeat the World Tree!" someone else said in a low
        voice. "Bullsh*t! We don't even have enough troops, how can we help
        you?!" Another person shouted.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This argument instantly ignited the fuse. Everyone's emotions had been
        like a spring that had been pushed to the limit these past few days.
        With this, all the accumulated dissatisfaction in their hearts erupted.
        They directly split into two groups. One group was advocating war while
        the other was in favor of escaping. The argument was extremely intense.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        If not for the fact that most of them were projections, everyone would
        have rolled up their sleeves and started fighting.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Star Alliance was formed by the alliance of more than forty
        civilizations. They were not united in the first place and each had
        their own standpoints for benefits. Usually, they could be gathered
        together, but when faced with the pressure of a powerful foreign
        invasion, internal conflicts immediately erupted.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Some of the upper echelons of the civilizations who had been against
        causing trouble couldn't restrain themselves anymore and started
        complaining loudly.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Everyone, calm down! Calm down… We still have other paths. We can't
        resist the World Tree on our own, but since the three Universal
        Civilizations are in the same situation as us, perhaps we can take the
        initiative to communicate with them and join forces against the enemy…
        As for our previous plans, we can put them aside for now. The most
        important thing is to defeat the World Tree together. They will
        definitely know the severity of the matter. We will settle the score
        with the three Universal Civilizations later in the future. We have to
        protect ourselves first before we can talk about the future…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Star Alliance Leader raised his suggestion loudly and tried his best
        to ease the atmosphere. However, it was useless. Everyone was speechless
        at his suggestion and turned a deaf ear to it. They continued arguing
        and the situation was getting out of control. In the past, many members
        of the Star Alliance would not have been so disrespectful to him.
        However, now that their own civilizations were on the brink of death, no
        one cared about him anymore.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Everyone had a big fight. Many people were furious. They stopped talking
        and directly went offline. They did not want to listen to the unified
        dispatch of the Star Alliance anymore. They decided to fly off on their
        own when disaster struck.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Not long after, there was no one left in the meeting room. The Star
        Alliance Leader sat alone in his seat, his heart filled with bitterness.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After the quarrel, the leaders of a few civilizations gave out orders
        without any hesitation. They did not listen to the Star Alliance's
        orders at all and packed up their resources and population. They started
        to escape hurriedly, preparing to escape from the Star Alliance's
        territory and enter the unexplored universe.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Initially, although most civilizations were angry and panicked, they had
        not decided to abandon their homes. However, when they saw someone
        running away decisively, they immediately became anxious. Since the
        others had already run away, if they did not keep up, wouldn't they be
        staying behind to help others cover their retreat? How could this do!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The chain reaction happened very quickly. One after another, the members
        of the Star Alliance didn't dare to delay any longer. They also started
        to migrate and escape, no longer caring about the Star Alliance's
        agreement.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        When these member countries refused to listen to the orders, the Star
        Alliance's mechanism was quickly paralyzed. The huge Star Alliance
        seemed to have broken up overnight, and the fleets of various
        civilizations began to escape and part ways.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In the past, many members would not easily go against the unified order
        of the Star Alliance, or else they would be isolated by others. But now,
        they could not care so much. When the World Tree attacked, the Star
        Alliance immediately had a disagreement of opinion. This joint Universal
        Civilization was destined to fall apart. No one planned to wait for
        death in a group. They only wanted others to stall the enemy so they
        could escape.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This was Han Xiao's intention. The weakness of the Star Alliance's
        structure was too obvious, which was that they had too many interests
        and did not have the strength of a dominant civilization. They could
        barely coalesce, and their opinions could not be completely unified.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Usually, the members of the Star Alliance had their reservations, but
        once they were in a life and death crisis, it would definitely be
        difficult for them to unite. There was an 80% chance that they would
        split up. As long as this collective will was disassembled, the Star
        Alliance's small giant would be dismembered. Its resistance would drop
        by several levels, and it would lose most of its fighting spirit.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Back then, the Star Alliance had secretly leaked the information,
        wanting to cause internal conflict in the galactic society. Han Xiao's
        action was also to give them a taste of their own medicine, using a
        different method to cause internal conflict.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The port on the mother planet of the Lore Civilization was already
        packed with people. Anti-gravity transport vehicles loaded the supplies
        onto the fleet one by one. Countless frightened citizens lined up to
        board the ships under the orders of armed soldiers. No matter how
        anxious they were, they could only suppress their emotions and listen to
        the orders obediently.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Not long ago, there was a group of people who wanted to rebel, but they
        were suppressed cruelly, killed on the spot. Their blood had not even
        dried yet. That was why no one dared to act recklessly right now.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Not long after, the first fleet was finally filled up. Without waiting
        for the subsequent spaceships, they took to the sky and fled into the
        depths of space.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Savignes was already in the main ship. As the leader of the
        civilization, he did not dare stay on the mother planet any longer. The
        fleets of refugees had split into several batches. In order to escort
        him, more than half of the armed forces were moving together with the
        first fleet with the least population load.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"We've finally set off…"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Savignes let out a small sigh of relief.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He still remembered that in the "battle report", the two Dynasty Rulers
        were tortured to death by the World Tree. It could be seen that the
        World Tree Civilization liked to carry out the tactic of killing the
        leader very much. He was worried that he would follow in their footsteps
        and be "trampled to death". Therefore, he only wanted to run away
        quickly and did not dare to stay on the mother planet as a target… As
        far as he knew, the other heads of civilizations had the same idea and
        had all fled from the mother planet.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As the spaceship slowly accelerated, Savignes was no longer so worried.
        He muttered to himself,
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"It should be safe for now…"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, before he could finish his sentence, the spaceship's radar
        suddenly exploded with an ear-piercing hum. It pointed straight at the
        front of the spaceship, and an energy reaction appeared out of nowhere,
        blocking the way.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The next moment, a Mechanical Deity suddenly expanded in size,
        surpassing the size of the entire fleet stacked on each other. It
        covered the sun and the stars, and a huge hand suddenly came down.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Hong Long Long</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Psionic energy burst out like ripples, and the entire fleet began to
        explode like firecrackers. In the blink of an eye, the armed escort
        fleet was almost completely annihilated. They could not even make a
        splash and turned into a large patch of fireworks in the starry sky. It
        was very beautiful.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"This is Black Star Þ".</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Savignes turned pale with fright and hastily shouted,
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Run, run…"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, before he could finish speaking, many of the spaceship
        operators were already sweating profusely.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "This won't do. The fleet's intelligence matrix is completely locked. We
        can't control it at all. The spaceship is already paralyzed!" "No…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Savignes' eyes widened in horror as his pupils reflected the enlarged
        palm of the Supreme Heavenly Venerate. The mechanical lines on the palm
        became clearer. Crack!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao directly grabbed the flagship and sucked it into his body,
        capturing Savignes and the upper echelons of the ship.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Immediately after, he suddenly raised his hand and punched. Energy burst
        out like a gamma-ray burst, spreading in a large area and instantly
        vaporizing a large group of warships that were about to counterattack.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"The first."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao turned around and disappeared as though he had never been
        there.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        His goal was to capture the leaders of all the civilizations in the Star
        Alliance and display the advantage of individual strength.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        With his current combat strength, the success rate of the targeting the
        leader tactic was almost 100% against a civilization like the Star
        Alliance. No one could stop him.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "His Excellency Savignes has been captured by the enemy!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Because Han Xiao's execution efficiency was too great, the remaining
        defense troops on the mother planet did not have the time to rush over
        to support Savignes when he was captured.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The guards on the ground base stared blankly at the place where Han Xiao
        had disappeared. Listening to the busy tone in the command channel, they
        fell into a state of chaos.
      </p>

      <p class="calibre3">
        The Star Alliance also had individual strengths, but compared to the
        three Universal Civilizations, they had too few top-tier combatants and
        were too weak. With Han Xiao's abilities, he could do whatever he wanted
        here.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In addition, the entire virtual network of the Star Alliance was under
        the surveillance of Han Xiao, a Legendary Mechanic. The whereabouts of
        the upper echelons of the Star Alliance could not be hidden at all. Han
        Xiao was like an eagle pouncing on a chicken, constantly teleporting and
        flashing, accurately intercepting the fleets of the upper echelons of
        the Star Alliance. Not once did he fail. Even the Star Alliance Leader
        was captured by him. Within a few days, the leaders of the forty-six
        civilizations and the upper echelons of the Star Alliance were all
        captured by Han Xiao.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        One civilization after another lost its command from the upper echelons.
        Some civilizations had a good system and continued to maintain the
        implementation of the migration plan through the base chain of command.
        Some civilizations were quite decisive, and there were some who took the
        position of the upper echelons, but most of them fell into different
        degrees of chaos.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The intelligence of the World Tree and the three Universal Civilizations
        was a secret of the upper echelons of the Star Alliance. The citizens
        and the officers did not know anything about it. They did not know what
        the World Tree fleet represented, nor did they have the strong fear of
        the World Tree Civilization like the upper echelons had developed over
        the years of war reports. Therefore, after the upper echelons of the
        various civilizations disappeared, many civilizations launched an
        intense counterattack.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, due to the collective vacancy of the upper echelons, the
        internal secrets were leaked out under the influence of a certain force,
        and it quickly spread throughout the Star Alliance base. Most people
        understood the source of the disaster and knew how terrifying the World
        Tree Civilization was, as well as how the World Tree Civilization was
        currently at war with the three Universal Civilizations.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As for the actions of the upper echelons of the Star Alliance, trying to
        reap benefits but inviting trouble instead, they were not announced
        under Han Xiao's control.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Because the World Tree's mechanism was too terrifying, the morale of
        many civilizations was immediately reduced by half.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        What completely destroyed the will of the Star Alliance civilizations
        was the invasion of another armed force. This time, it was the three
        Universal Civilizations army that was supposed to fight the World Tree
        in the news! They had also become the attackers!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The morale of the Star Alliance completely collapsed. Facing the pincer
        attack of two Universal Civilizations, they no longer had the courage to
        resist and could only flee in panic.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The entire Star Alliance's battle situation slid into the abyss at
        lightning speed. All the resistance forces were paralyzed and wiped out
        by the three Universal Civilizations and the World Tree. Countless
        spaceships escaped from the Star Alliance's territory, and it was a
        complete mess. Only a month had passed since the World Tree Civilization
        and the three Universal Civilizations invaded the Star Alliance.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In reality, if the Star Alliance could unite all their forces, they
        would at least be at the Universe Grade, and would not be so weak. They
        could still work together to resist for a period of time. However, the
        situation was too sudden, and there were too many internal conflicts, so
        they could not form an effective counterattack… The current situation of
        the Star Alliance was like the three Universal Civilizations that were
        attacked by the World Tree in his previous life, and the situation was
        even worse. They were caught completely off guard.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        If the Star Alliance was given some time, they might be able to recover
        from the chaos after suffering heavy losses and form various scattered
        civil resistance forces. However, they had no chance now.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        All the upper echelons of the Star Alliance civilization that were
        captured by Han Xiao were not executed, nor were they immediately
        devoured and transformed by the World Tree. Instead, they were locked in
        the same cage without any physical torture.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        There were only virtual screens floating in the cage, showing the tragic
        situation of their various civilizations under the attack of the World
        Tree all day long. All the upper echelons of the Star Alliance could not
        rest peacefully and were suffering from psychological torture.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Every day, as they watched the World Tree fleet destroy the Star
        Alliance, they were furious, terrified, and desperate.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After the scene of the three Universal Civilizations attacking the Star
        Alliance was shown on the screen, all the upper echelons of the Star
        Alliance were stunned.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        They had originally thought that the World Tree was fighting on two
        fronts, but they did not expect the three Universal Civilizations to
        attack them too. In an instant, their previous guesses were overturned,
        and everyone was horrified.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Why would the three Universal Civilizations invade our territory
        together with the World Tree Civilization? Aren't they still fighting ?"
        The Star Alliance Leader said with a hoarse voice, unable to hide his
        shock and confusion.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Could it be that they've stopped the war and reconciled? No, how is
        that possible? One should not have stopped until the other died. Isn't
        the World Tree unable to coexist with any civilization P" someone
        murmured in disbelief.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Savignes' eyes were bloodshot and his voice hoarse, "There's only one
        possibility. The three Universal Civilizations have been devoured by the
        World Tree and turned into slaves of the World Tree. They have lost
        their freedom… In other words, their civilization has been destroyed!
        Hahaha… Wuu wuu…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As he said that, a twisted expression appeared on his face. It was as if
        he was laughing and crying at the same time. There was an indescribable
        sense of viciousness and joy.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Among all the Star Alliance civilizations that were attacked, the Lore
        Civilization was the most miserable. They were targeted by the World
        Tree and the three Universal Civilizations. Savignes watched the tragic
        scenes of his race every day, and his mental state was on the verge of
        collapse. In his eyes… although he was about to die, at least the three
        Universal Civilizations were gone. His revenge had succeeded, and he had
        already dragged his enemies along with him to die, destroying the
        prosperous world of the three Universal Civilizations.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Hearing this, everyone nodded silently. They all agreed that the three
        Universal Civilizations had become the World Tree Civilization's vassal.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, unlike Savignes, the other upper echelons of the Star Alliance
        did not feel any joy, only fear.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Originally, one World Tree Civilization was enough to destroy the Star
        Alliance. Now, they had even ‘absorbed the forces of the three Universal
        Civilizations. It was equivalent to two Universal Civilizations
        attacking from both sides.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        No matter how they thought about it, they felt that there was no chance
        that the Star Alliance would survive. They had already lost all hope in
        their hearts. Their expressions were numb, and they were like walking
        corpses.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Swoosh!</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At this time, the cell door opened, and everyone turned around to look.
        A figure walked in against the light from the corridor outside,
        revealing an expressionless face. It was Han Xiao.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Everyone, how have you been?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Han Xiao said emotionlessly.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Black Star!"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Everyone subconsciously shrank back with fear on their faces.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Savignes was the only one who did not retreat. Instead, he took a few
        steps forward with a ferocious smile on his face. He stretched out his
        hands as though he wanted to grab Han Xiao's shoulders.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Pa!</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Before he could even take a few steps, an invisible force sent him
        flying, and he slammed into the prison wall.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, Savignes did not seem to feel any pain at all. Instead, he
        started laughing like a maniac.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Hahaha&mdash; Black Star! Your three Universal Civilizations have also
        suffered a crushing defeat and become the slaves of the World Tree. We
        will also become a member of the World Tree. We are equals with you, and
        we all have the same ending. Don't think that anyone has won! Haha…
        cough… haha…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The upper echelons of the Star Alliance looked at the crazy Savignes and
        remained silent. There was only disappointment on their faces, and they
        even looked at Han Xiao with sympathy. Although they were destined to
        become a member of the World Tree and would not die, they would lose
        their sense of self. In their eyes, it was no different from death.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Seeing this, Han Xiao knew what they were thinking. He shook his head
        and laughed.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Do you think the three Universal Civilizations have become the slaves
        of the World Tree? A reasonable deduction, an interesting conjecture…
        Unfortunately, it's a completely wrong conclusion."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Without waiting for the others to react, he raised his palm, and a small
        World Tree phantom appeared in his palm. It spun around and exuded an
        astonishing high-level pressure, causing everyone present to feel weak
        all over. They could not even stand, and collapsed onto the ground one
        after another.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Our war has ended, but you guys guessed wrongly. The World Tree was
        captured by me and has now become my Universal Treasure. In other words…
        I'm the master of the World Tree Civilization."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As soon as he said that, Savignes' crazy, hoarse laughter stopped, like
        a screaming chicken that had its throat pinched.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">He stared at Han Xiao with his eyes wide open.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Impossible! I don't believe it! The intelligence said that the World
        Tree Civilization had the upper hand and almost destroyed your side…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Oh? You're talking about the intelligence sent back by the spies you
        left in the desolate universe belt?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao interrupted him and said with a teasing tone, "I got someone to
        make up those battle reports. Isn't that great?" As soon as he said
        that, it was as if he had pressed the mute button. Savignes' anger froze
        on his face, and the others' eyes widened.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">The room fell silent.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao blinked and slowly said, "Your spies have long been discovered
        by us and transformed into the servants of the World Tree. We have been
        sending fake intelligence to you all, making you think that we are still
        in the midst of war. In fact, we had already dealt with the World Tree
        more than a year ago. What you all saw was just an illusion we made
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">up."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At this moment, everyone's expression was extremely interesting.
        Thinking about how they had been surprised every time they saw the
        ‘battle report' in the past year, everyone felt as if they had eaten a
        piece of incense.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        It turned out that they had been laughing at the fake intelligence that
        others had fabricated. They had been complacent, proud, and had been
        toyed with!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At this moment, everyone wished they could tear off their faces and
        throw them somewhere they could no longer see.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At the same time, an even deeper sense of despair rose in everyone's
        hearts. Knowing that this was a mixed attack, they had no hope at all.
        Their faces were extremely gloomy, knowing that the Star Alliance was
        finished.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Seeing this, Han Xiao shook his head.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In fact, he felt that the Star Alliance was quite unlucky. Even if these
        people did not take advantage of the situation to give trouble to the
        three Universal Civilizations, when he defeated the World Tree, he would
        still use the Information Form Warning Network to cover all the Star
        Fields in his territory. This way, the Star Alliance would still have
        nowhere to hide and would be exposed.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At that time, the Star Alliance would still receive the attention and
        vigilance of the three Universal Civilizations, and their outcome would
        probably not be any better. Therefore, the moment the Star Alliance sent
        their spies to gather information about the galactic society, their
        outcome was almost certain.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Star Alliance Leader clenched his fists and gritted his teeth. "What
        are you going to do to us if you don't want to devour us?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao glanced at them and said, "I need everyone's cooperation. As
        you can see, we have the ability to destroy all the civilizations in the
        Star Alliance, but I will give your race a chance. Stop resisting,
        choose to submit, and become our subsidiary… Only then will we give you
        the right to continue surviving."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "You could have swallowed us all, why would you do this!" The Star
        Alliance Leader was furious.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "I want to." Han Xiao raised his brows, paused, looked at everyone, and
        continued, "Think about it first. You only have one chance…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This time, Savignes suddenly roared and interrupted him.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "We will never give up our freedom to become the World Tree's vassal!
        You will never be able to enslave us…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, before he could finish speaking, Han Xiao flicked his finger,
        and mechanical particles flew out, forming a sealed mechanical device
        that covered the lower half of Savignes' face, blocking all of his
        roars.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao retracted his gaze and said with a calm expression, "It seems
        like he has already made his choice. Before the destruction of the Lore
        Civilization, he will not be executed. He will stand here and watch the
        outcome of his choice… Everyone, it's your turn. Because I was
        interrupted just now, I will repeat myself. The three Universal
        Civilizations won't even need to put in the effort to destroy you all.
        If you reject me, you all won't even have the chance to reproduce under
        the jurisdiction of the World Tree. Destruction or continuation, think
        carefully before you speak."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Everyone's expression was uncertain, and they fell into a dilemma.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        They knew that this was a warning, but it was still very effective. They
        really wanted to say that they would never become slaves out of spite,
        but looking at the tragic state of their race on the virtual screen,
        they only felt the heavy burden on their shoulders become heavier, so
        heavy that they could not even speak.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At this time, mechanical particles flowed out from under Han Xiao's robe
        and turned into a fixed cabin, locking Savignes up.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "There's no need to hurry. You have plenty of time. Before our fleet
        destroys your civilization, you can hesitate as much as you want. After
        all, you're not the ones who are dying."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Han Xiao then turned around and left.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The cell door closed behind him, cutting off the sound of Savignes
        struggling.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao did not stop, and the officers of the three Universal
        Civilizations were already waiting at the door. Seeing this, they
        quickly followed.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Your Excellency Black Star, thank you." Teny nodded.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"It's nothing. I'll leave the rest to you."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Han Xiao waved his hands.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He had already helped them to this extent, and the Star Alliance had
        already lost the ability to resist. The three Universal Civilizations
        would be more than enough to take care of the rest of the work. With the
        World Tree Civilization cooperating, he did not need to do anything
        anymore. The three Universal Civilizations still had the ability to
        handle such a simple concluding job.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        I didn't expect things to go so smoothly… A civilization that has
        stepped into the threshold of the Universe Grade was easily destroyed in
        such a short period of time. My force has already expanded to this
        level. Han Xiao sighed in his heart before walking away.
      </p>

        Chapter 1456: Logging Out and Returning<span hidden="" class="calibre1">

        </span>
      </h1>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After settling the upper echelons of the Star Alliance, Han Xiao had
        nothing to do and could focus on his own work. The three Universal
        Civilizations and the World Tree Civilization were both in charge of
        cleaning up the Star Alliance.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Because the resistance of the Star Alliance had collapsed, it was a
        piece of cake for the three Universal Civilizations to clean up the
        migrating troops within the Star Alliance. Originally, the rare war
        mission was a large-scale event that the players were passionate about,
        but this time, the three Universal Civilizations did not issue a
        large-scale gathering order. Only a few players were summoned to deal
        with the Star Alliance, and most of the players were focused on their
        own Pro League.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After a long period of preparation, the qualifiers had already begun,
        and it was already at its climax. Therefore, most of the players were
        not interested in the Star Alliance war at the moment. They only wanted
        to hurt each other and participate in the upcoming Pro League.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As Han Xiao had been farming the Sanctum authority for the truth of the
        universe and Iterations, he did not pay much attention to the players'
        Pro League. He took some time to check it out, and he realized that the
        biggest special feature of this Pro League was a significant increase in
        the level of combat. The mainstream competitive level had gone from
        Grade B to Calamity Grade, and the destructive power had increased
        tremendously.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        It was now Version 5.5. Compared to Version 4.0, the level cap had
        increased from level 150 to level 200. The series of missions in the
        World Tree War had made the players extremely rich. Although they had
        watched CGs during the final battle, the results of the battle had
        brought them a shocking profit.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In the fourth Pro League, the mainstream players were basically Grade
        Bs. Although they were considered the backbone of the universe, they
        were still considered weak in the eyes of the top combatants. However,
        in the fifth Pro League, the gap between the players had grown even
        wider. Now, the main players of the Pro League had to be at the Calamity
        Grade.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In the Supers Holy Land, on an uninhabited planet. Qualifiers round,
        Arena 24.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The battleships of the guilds floated in the air and watched the battle
        on the ground. They saw two ‘yellow dragons' that were covered in dust
        colliding with each other, creating shockwaves from time to time,
        creating spiderweb-like cracks on the ground.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Two players in heavy armor were moving rapidly on the surface of the
        planet, fighting each other continuously. They were like walking natural
        disasters, but their IDs were unfamiliar. They were not professional
        players from any guild but ordinary players.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        These were just two unknown players, but their destructive power was
        already very outstanding. The players in the sky could not take their
        eyes off them.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As the players stepped into the Calamity Grade batch by batch, their
        strength increased collectively, and many of them experienced a
        qualitative change. In order to ensure the viewership ratings and
        prevent some professional players from the large guilds from really
        failing in the qualifiers, many large guilds obtained direct access
        cards to the official league, so they did not need to take risks in the
        qualifiers. Although this decreased the excitement of the qualifiers,
        because there were many dark horses, the players were still very
        excited. ‘The overall destructive power of the players is getting
        stronger…'
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Outside the atmosphere, Han Xiao's virtual projection looked down at the
        planet and took in the scene of the players fighting. He was in stealth
        mode, and the other players could not see his projection. They were
        still looking down at the competition, not looking up at the sky.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Let the players grow a few more versions, and the level cap will be
        unlocked more and more. They will definitely become the new source of
        chaos."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Han Xiao pondered.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Now that the galactic society had formed a new stable structure, it
        would be peaceful for a long time. It was good for the galactic
        residents but bad for the players.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After experiencing several versions of events, the players had already
        eaten big fish and meat, and they had seen big scenes. If they were
        asked to go back and do the daily side missions, it would definitely be
        unbearable. If there were no new disasters or big events, the players
        who were unwilling to remain out of the limelight would definitely
        become ‘big events'. As their strength increased, they would definitely
        become more restless, and they would not be satisfied with a leisurely
        life, which would lead to chaos.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        All kinds of thoughts flashed through Han Xiao's mind. He took a deep
        look at the players' spaceships, turned around, and disappeared. On the
        other side, in the cabins of the players' spaceships, countless people
        were staring at the feedback of the competition on the ground on the
        satellite screen.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The officers of the guilds and clubs were also paying attention to the
        situation of the qualifiers, noting down the dark horses and discussing
        softly.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "This year's competition is really amazing. There are too many strong
        players." "I don't think it's good. I've already seen more than thirty
        top-notch non-professional players. If our team's players are really
        defeated by the normal players, we'll lose a lot of face."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "I really hope that the next version is released as soon as possible.
        The guild's plans can also be implemented then." Many guild officers
        were secretly excited.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As the level cap was unlocked further, the Calamity Grade players of the
        various guilds experienced a huge increase in size, and the operational
        capability of the guild organizations also increased.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Currently, many guilds had a large number of Calamity Grade players on
        their hands, and their strength was enough to dominate a region in the
        galactic society. In order to maintain the gap between their own pro
        players and ordinary players, many professional guilds privately created
        detailed plans for the guild's operations for the next version, deciding
        to expand in the universe in the next version.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Although they were watching the Pro League, the thoughts of many guild
        officers had already drifted away. They could not wait to go all out in
        the next version.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao did not have the time to pay attention to the pro league of the
        players. To him, this was just a distraction. He buried his head in the
        machinery factory and almost left all his chores behind. He checked over
        and over again the feasibility of the World Tree's Information Form
        Materialization function breaking through the dark side universe.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As the days flew by, the three Universal Civilizations' invasion of Star
        Alliance also gradually came to an end. They had long received the
        battle reports that Han Xiao had fabricated from the upper echelons of
        the Star Alliance, and they were speechless at Han Xiao's bad taste.
        This guy was f*cking irregular.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, the leaders of the three Universal Civilizations would not
        disturb Han Xiao, who was studying how to break the seal on the dark
        side universe, over such a small matter. They could only pretend that
        nothing had happened and silently order their people to destroy this
        ‘dark history'.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In the blink of an eye, more than a year had passed. The three Universal
        Civilizations had more or less completed dismantling and clearing the
        Star Alliance, digesting most of the spoils of war, and destroyed this
        enemy that was lurking behind them.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The fifth Pro League also came to an end during this period. This time,
        Dynasty Club finally returned to first place and won the championship of
        the fifth Pro League. Second Prince inherited King Admiral's position
        and led the team to win the championship, instantly raising his
        historical status by a level. He was praised by the club as the
        ‘cornerstone of the next dynasty'.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Dynasty was the only team that had won the championship twice in the
        past five Pro Leagues. Their popularity, which had originally fallen
        slightly, soared like a rocket. The former Dynasty champion captain King
        Admiral, who was the team's coach, publicly congratulated Second Prince,
        expressing his relief. Bun-Hit-Dog called it ‘King's Baton Pass', which
        was accepted by the players and spread on the forums.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This time, the first and second runner-ups were America's Devil team and
        Russia's White Vodka team. Although the Chinese team was not as dominant
        as before and could not occupy two places in the top three, their
        performance was still not bad. They had achieved outstanding results in
        the individual and group competitions.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As the Pro League came to an end, Version 5.5 also came to an end.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In the guild bases of the players on the various planets of the Supers
        Holy Land, groups of players were gathered, waiting to go offline. They
        chatted casually, and it was as noisy as a market.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "It's finally going to be updated again. I wonder how many years it will
        be this time." "It should be the main version update now. We should be
        able to unlock at least 20 levels!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "I wonder what will happen in the next version. Since even the World
        Tree has been dealt with, I don't think anything will be able to shake
        the current situation of the galactic society."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Didn't you see the Galaxy Times' deduction? There's a high chance that
        internal conflicts will intensify, and Black Star might turn black and
        become a new boss, fighting against the three Universal Civilizations."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Yo, does this mean that we can finally start a massacre? I'm going to
        turn the world upside down!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "It would feel so refreshing. I've been unhappy with those three old
        b*stards for a long time. When the time comes, I'll chop them up to vent
        my anger."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "You guys are so disappointing! Compared to this, shouldn't we be more
        concerned about whether we can repair the BUG that we can't get naked in
        the next version?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Yes, yes, yes! If I can't run around naked in the next version, I'll
        definitely complain!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Hearing the players around her yelling, Maple Moon had a look of disgust
        on her face. She felt that these people were hopeless.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As they chatted, time slowly passed. When they went offline, a large
        white light flashed, and batches of players disappeared one after
        another. The hall became empty.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At the same time, in the private research room of the Supers Holy Land,
        Han Xiao, who was studying, paused and looked up.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Hmm, has the version update started again?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao stopped what he was doing and opened the interface to take a
        look. The forums were closed once again. This meant that the time flow
        between the dark side universe and the true universe was disconnected
        once again, turning into two independent systems. He was the only stable
        information interference bridge left.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        During this period of time, he had repeatedly studied the feasibility of
        the conversion plan, and he was now more than seventy percent confident.
        Although he had made some technical contributions, most of it was thanks
        to the tests and improvements of the previous dark side Iterations.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao shook his head and closed the interface. Just as he was about
        to enter the research again, Phillip suddenly appeared.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Master, hum, Her Excellency Ames is in your office. She wants to see
        you, hum."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Oh, I got it. I'll be right there."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao rubbed the space between his brows. He had no choice but to put
        down his research and head to his office.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The moment he entered, he saw Ames sitting in his seat with her back
        facing the door.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Hearing the noise, Ames turned her chair around, and her long legs
        extended out from under her black dress. She sat down and looked at Han
        Xiao with a smile that was not a smile. "Busy man, it's not easy to see
        you." "I've been very busy recently. You know that." Han Xiao walked
        around the table and came to the back of the chair. He placed his hands
        on both sides of Ames' forehead and gently massaged it.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Ames closed her eyes comfortably, but her mouth did not stop. She
        chuckled and said, "That's right, there's no time when you're not busy.
        If I didn't come to find you occasionally, I would have suspected that
        you had forgotten about me."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "What are you saying? You're just spouting nonsense. You deserve to be
        punished." Han Xiao curled his lips, and a faint electric current
        appeared on his finger, causing Ames' eyelashes to tremble.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Ames avoided Han Xiao's finger and slapped his hand away. She then stood
        up and said seriously,
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "I don't understand. The World Tree has been dealt with, and the three
        Universal Civilizations have given in. We don't have any safety concerns
        now, so why are you still so busy? Where did you get the pressure P".
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "… This is a secret that I can't tell you yet. In any case, it's very
        tricky." Han Xiao shook his head. It would be useless to tell the Beyond
        Grade As about the secrets of the Iterations, so he did not tell anyone
        other than the heads of the three Universal Civilizations.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Do you still remember what I said back then? Ambition is never-ending.
        When are you willing to stop? Do you really want to replace the three
        Universal Civilizations?" Ames frowned. "What is it that you have to
        hide so closely? Can't you just say it out loud and let everyone bear
        the consequences?" "You can't help…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao hesitated for a moment before touching Ames' cheek. "This
        should be the last time. I will keep us all alive."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Hearing this, Ames' eyes changed. Although she did not know what Han
        Xiao was hiding, she could hear the seriousness in Han Xiao's tone. A
        situation which even a Transcendent found difficult to deal with, had to
        be some kind of problem that she could not imagine.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Just as Ames was about to ask, the communicator in the room suddenly
        beeped.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        It was a message from Marbruce. There was only one content…
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">The Sanctum exploration team was finally back!</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Han Xiao's eyes sparkled.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "I have something to do, so I'll leave first. I'll accompany you next
        time."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Han Xiao quickly changed into King.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Ames opened her mouth, wanting to say something, but the next moment,
        Han Xiao activated teleportation and disappeared from the room.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Looking at the empty room, Ames clenched and unclenched her fists. She
        repeated this a few times before taking a deep breath and suppressing
        the complicated emotions in her heart.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The subordinate that once needed her protection was now an existence
        that she could only look up to. She was increasingly feeling that it was
        harder for her to keep up with Han Xiao.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Although Ames had a cold personality and rarely bothered herself with
        such matters, she would still feel a sense of loss after so many years.
        Even though Han Xiao's attitude toward her remained the same, Ames knew
        that she could no longer share Han Xiao's worries.

        Chapter 1457: Plan<span hidden="" class="calibre1"> | </span>
      </h1>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In a certain military-restricted area in the Central Galaxy, the
        location of the Sanctum channel that had once been summoned had already
        been tightly sealed. There were densely packed space armed fortresses
        and large fleet troops scattered all around, and the security was tight.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Suddenly, a beam of light lit up in the darkness and slowly expanded,
        turning into three Sanctum channels that led to the white world. They
        floated quietly in space like three miniature white holes. In the
        dazzling light door, three black shadows gradually grew larger and
        larger. They were the spaceships that the three Universal Civilizations
        had sent to explore the Sanctum.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        A group of soldiers immediately flew out from the military base and led
        the three spaceships back to the fortress. The members of the ship
        walked out under the support of their comrades. Most of them looked
        dazed, as though they were out of their mind. Their eyes were dull and
        their reactions slow.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Only Clotti, Oulou, and the Beyond Grade A from the Arcane Church seemed
        to be in a better state. However, their faces were still filled with
        shock, and their legs were trembling.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Right at this moment, a faint light flashed, and the remote projection
        of the three Universal Civilizations' Rulers appeared. They immediately
        surrounded the group with a nervous expression.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "How's the situation? Did you guys get the information from the
        Sanctum?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Clotti's eyes were focused, and he was stunned for a few seconds before
        he seemed to come back to his senses. He nodded with a serious
        expression.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "The scene in the Sanctum is exactly the same as what Black Star said.
        We have already seen the records on the Sanctum's message board. The
        truth about the Alterations of the Universe is indeed on it. In
        addition, we also obtained some information about the Alterations of the
        past from the Sanctum. Although it's not much, it's still a piece of
        evidence."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Hearing this, the heads of the three Universal Civilizations took a deep
        breath. Although they knew that Han Xiao was not lying, they were still
        shocked.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At this moment, Louis suddenly lowered his voice and said, "Has the
        Sanctum Revival experiment succeeded?".
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "It's true." Clotti raised his palm and showed the Sanctum Revival mark
        on the back of his hand. It was exactly the same as in the records.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The three of them finally relaxed and nodded silently. In order to prove
        the authenticity of the Sanctum and prevent themselves from being
        tricked by Black Star again, the three Universal Civilizations took out
        a few mediums of their late direct descendants and gave them to Clotti
        and the others to test if the Sanctum Revival was feasible. If it
        failed, it would mean that the Sanctum that they had entered was full of
        tricks. It could be that Black Star had deliberately built this
        alternate dimension to trick them. If they succeeded, they would be able
        to prove that it was the real Sanctum.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Back then, when he asked Black Star to help revive the direct Beyond
        Grade As, the three Universal Civilizations' Ruler had said that he had
        taken out all the mediums of the late direct descendants, but he had
        actually hidden a small portion of the late direct descendants, claiming
        that he did not have these mediums, so as to guard against Black Star
        and prevent any accidents. Even when Black Star proved that the Sanctum
        Revival was reliable, the three Universal Civilizations did not reveal
        this. They planned to use it as test material when they researched the
        Sanctum in the future, and it was now useful.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Ta ta ta…</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At this time, the sound of footsteps could be heard from afar. Han Xiao,
        who had teleported over, walked over in large strides. Before anyone
        could say anything, he grabbed Clotti's hand and raised it in front of
        his eyes.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "What are you doing?" Clotti was shocked. He subconsciously wanted to
        break free, but he realized that he could not move Han Xiao's fingers at
        all.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The heads of the three Universal Civilizations thought that Han Xiao was
        concerned about the Sanctum Revival Mark, and their hearts tightened.
        They were worried that Black Star would hold a grudge against them for
        trying the Sanctum Revival in private.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, they were wrong. Now that things had come to this, Han Xiao
        would not pay attention to these details. He revealed his Sanctum
        authority mark, and Clotti's palm immediately produced feedback, showing
        his own Sanctum authority mark as well.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        One of the symbols was complicated and exquisite, while the other was
        simple and plain. This was the difference between a max-level authority
        and a level-one authority.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Seeing this, Han Xiao then let go of Clotti and said,
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "How is it? How does it feel to enter and exit the Sanctum? Does it feel
        like you were hallucinating?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Clotti rubbed his painful wrist and hesitated for a moment before
        saying, "Indeed, I feel like I'm sleepwalking. Although I can still
        control my body, my senses seem to be separated by a layer. It's not
        like I can move freely under normal circumstances. It's more like I'm
        controlling my body through a third-person perspective. My brain and
        body are no longer one…" "This was your first time in there, so it's
        normal for you to feel this way… although I've never experienced the
        feeling of having a low authority." Han Xiao patted his shoulder. "Your
        authority is too low, and you spent a lot of time. We've been waiting
        for you in the main universe for a long time."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Clotti and the others looked at the time and were shocked. It had been a
        year or two since they left. They had only stayed in the Sanctum for a
        few hours.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Just get used to it. When your authority gets higher, the flow of time
        in the Sanctum will slowly converge with the main universe."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao casually explained before turning to look at the heads of the
        three Universal Civilizations.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "How is it? Did you guys get the information you wanted? Do you believe
        me now?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Marbruce nodded. "We've confirmed the truth about the Universe
        Iterations. It's exactly as you said."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At this time, the Pope said, "It's just that our authority is too low,
        so we can't see all the information on the Sanctum's message board.
        Therefore, we still can't investigate the secrets of the Final Three
        Universal Civilizations and the Dark Side Universe that you mentioned…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Hearing this, Han Xiao opened his eyes wide and found it funny.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Why? Don't tell me you want me to help you access the Sanctum until you
        unlock all the messages on the boards?".
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"If you don't mind, we would be honored…"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Get lost."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Ahem, we can understand why you're not willing…"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">The three of them looked embarrassed.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "It's true that I can help you complete the great deeds that you have
        done for many generations, but don't push your luck." Han Xiao crossed
        his arms and said with a frown, "I have already done enough for the
        galactic society. I have already given you enough sincerity, but you
        guys are still skeptical of me. It was like this when we dealt with the
        World Tree, and it is still the same now. To be honest, if you guys
        still doubt me, we can just dissolve this partnership."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Don't, don't, don't. We just need to think about it because of the big
        picture. We don't suspect you… Let's go to the office and have a chat."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The three of them quickly surrounded Han Xiao and explained, leading him
        to the private conference room.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After closing the door and confirming that there were no outsiders,
        Marbruce coughed and said,
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Black Star, we believe in the intelligence of the Dark Side Universe.
        Now that we've verified that the Sanctum's intelligence is not fake,
        let's talk about the topic we didn't finish last time. How do you plan
        to break the seal of the Dark Side Universe and let us return to the
        real universe?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Two ways." Han Xiao raised two fingers.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "What are they?" The three of them perked up and listened carefully.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao paused to gather these thoughts before explaining slowly.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "The first is to follow the route of the three Universal Civilizations
        in the first two dark sides and use the Information Form Materialization
        device normally. Although the World Tree has mutated and changed its
        nature, it still has the core function of being an Information Form
        Materialization device. I've already dug it out."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"What about the second one?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Secondly, I still have to use the Information Form Materialization
        device, but it has to be combined with my Virtual Creation ability." The
        three of them looked at each other in confusion.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Marbruce said with a puzzled tone, "Aren't both of them using
        Information Form Materialization devices? What's the difference?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "The difference is in my position. In the first plan, the success rate
        depends entirely on whether the information interference bridge has met
        the prerequisite requirement for conversion, which means that this
        predetermined route may still fail. As for the second plan, I can use my
        own abilities. The principle is… well, let's not talk about the
        principle. Anyway, none of you can understand it. In any case, I feel
        that it can increase the success rate of conversion… The only concern is
        that the two previous dark side iterations have never tried my new
        method before, so there might be some uncertain factors."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Han Xiao shook his head.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The first plan was to use him as a tool, a ‘medium' to activate the
        Information Form Materialization device. In the second plan, he was the
        executor of the device… The difference between the two was the leader.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After fusing with the World Tree, Han Xiao studied it carefully and
        finally allowed his (Virtual Creation) skill to transform. After
        removing the ‘Pseudo' part, the effect of the skill had changed
        drastically. It had the same function as the core ability found in the
        Information Form Materialization device and could resonate with each
        other.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The three of them hesitated and discussed softly. Han Xiao did not rush
        them.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After a few minutes, Marbruce looked up and asked, "What is the
        estimated success rate of these two plans?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao shrugged. "The first plan has a fifty percent success rate, and
        the second plan has a seventy percent success rate, but the risk is
        unknown."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Louis pondered and said, "Why don't we try the first plan? If it doesn't
        work, we can try the second one."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Hmm, it can be done, but the stable interference bridge might be
        damaged in the case of a failure. At that time, even if you want to
        regret it, you won't have the chance to do so. Therefore, I personally
        suggest that it's best to do it in one go." Han Xiao shrugged.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"…We need to think about it."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Alright, you have plenty of time, but the preparations for the two
        proposals are more or less the same. During this time, mobilize the
        galactic society and get ready." "Okay."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The three of them nodded and disconnected from the remote projection.
        They could not wait to go back and discuss it.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao was the only one left in the conference room. He looked at
        where the three of them disappeared and curled his lips.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In fact, he had hidden a third plan, which was to use the World Tree to
        swallow the entire universe and "compress" it in his body, forming a
        complete and independent "information assembly". This way, it would
        reduce the difficulty of the actualization of information. In his
        opinion, the success rate of this plan could exceed eighty percent.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, even if he used his chest muscles to think, he knew that the
        three Universal Civilizations would definitely not agree to this plan.
        They might even start to doubt his motives for helping. In addition,
        this process was truly too long. Who knew how long it would take for the
        World Tree to devour the entire dark side universe? Just the journey
        alone would take countless years, and he did not really want to utilize
        this plan. Therefore, Han Xiao decided not to say anything and kept it
        to himself.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "I hope the three Universal Civilizations choose the second plan… Hmm,
        but even if they don't choose the second plan, I'll still do it."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Han Xiao clicked his tongue.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Letting the three Universal Civilizations choose was mainly to give them
        a feeling of ‘participation'… When the galactic society was ready to
        officially begin the transformation, it would still be up to him.

      </h1>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao teleported back to the office in the Supers Holy Land's main
        planet. The meeting with the three Universal Civilizations went much
        faster than expected, but Ames did not wait. She had already left, and
        the room was empty. "Where did she go?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Her Excellency Ames has gone to look for Aurora. Should I inform her to
        come over?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"There's no need. I'll look for her later."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao casually expressed his concern and did not ask further. His
        expression was not as relaxed as when he was talking to the three
        Universal Civilizations' rulers, but rather, he had a lot on his mind.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He told the leaders of the three Universal Civilizations that he was
        worried that the stable interference bridge would be damaged during the
        conversion. This was not a lie, but a real concern.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After this period of testing, he realized that as a medium for
        conversion, when he officially activated the Information Form
        Materialization device, he would suffer a large amount of information
        impact and temporarily form a connection with the universe
        consciousness. During the process of reverse conversion to the True
        State, the interface, as a specialty of the dark side universe, would
        gradually lose its effect, so the Character Summon Cards could not be
        used continuously during the conversion process. If he wanted to
        maintain his consciousness and maintain the effect of (Virtual
        CreationTrue], he would need to strengthen his Information Form base and
        add some ‘Information Form Anchors' to prevent himself from being unable
        to hold on and cause the information interference channel to break.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He did not disclose these details, and no one else could help him. It
        would only add to his troubles.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "The so-called Information Form Anchor should be my understanding of
        myself, my connection with the World Tree, and my past memories…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Han Xiao pondered.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This was a rather mysterious perception. If one did not reach the
        Transcendent Grade, they would not be able to have such an
        intuition-tracing back to the past and commemorating the past might be
        the way to deepen the Information Form Anchor.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "The three Universal Civilizations are about to start preparing. I have
        to start preparing too…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao then changed into another King and disappeared from the room.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">lore</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Shattered Star Ring, Planet Aquamarine. The planet that had been
        abandoned for more than ten years was rebuilt after the people of Planet
        Aquamarine relocated. The old buildings covered by nature were
        demolished and rebuilt. The entire planet looked completely new.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">ve</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        There was only one place that had not been renovated. The large ruins
        were already covered in wild green vegetation, and the large number of
        building wreckage stuck in the ground had already rusted. These were the
        ruins of the Germinal Organization. It laid quietly on the wasteland, as
        silent as ever. Only the traces left behind by time seemed to be telling
        the past.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Three people were strolling around the ruins, stopping from time to time
        to observe. "…Back then, your godfather and I fought side by side and
        destroyed the Germinal Organization. He infiltrated this place alone and
        stole countless key secrets. He even saved Hila and Aurora, who were
        still young at that time. He fought for thousands of miles before giving
        the information to us. In the end, the war was decided in one fell
        swoop, and the Six Nations no longer had anything to worry about. The
        Germinal Organization was destroyed with a nuclear explosion. It was
        also on that day that Planet Aquamarine was reborn."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Bennett caressed the remains of a huge metal plate. He wiped off the
        rust on it with his palm, revealing a blurry Germinal Organization
        insignia. A complicated look appeared in his eyes, as though he was
        reminiscing about the war years ago.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Nero, who was standing behind him, took a few steps forward and placed
        his hand on the metal wreckage as well. "I've seen these things in my
        textbooks, but every time I come to the Germinal Organization ruins, I
        always feel as though I'm there, as though I've experienced a battle
        that changed the fate of this planet."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Bennett turned to look at him, shook his head, and laughed. He then took
        back his hand and sighed. "Thinking about it carefully, Black Star's
        appearance when he was young is like a completely different person
        compared to the current him. Sigh, when one is old, one loves to
        reminisce about the past." "You're not old yet," Mia, who was holding a
        baby, said with a smile.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Bennett laughed out loud and walked to Mia. He bent down and looked at
        the baby in Mia's arms. At this moment, he was staring at him with his
        eyes wide open. He chuckled and extended his short arms.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Yo, my good grandson, let grandpa carry</p>
      <p class="calibre3">you."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Bennett's face was filled with kindness, and his arm, which could easily
        crush steel, carefully took over his grandson. He held his grandson in
        his arms and shook him gently.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Nero also came over with a face full of envy.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Although he was the child's father, the moment he hugged his son, the
        child would cry nonstop. Instead, his son would only be able to sleep
        peacefully in his grandfather Bennett's arms.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After the war ended, Nero and Mia had a baby, which made Bennett feel
        very happy.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Considering that Nero had become the acting Army Commander and that
        Planet Aquamarine was on the right track, Bennett decided to give up his
        position as the leader of the Aquamarine Federation after much
        consideration. Originally, many of the upper echelons did not agree and
        wished for Bennett to be re-elected. However, he had already made up his
        mind and was determined to give up his position. He was no longer in
        charge of any duties and had retired to enjoy the happiness of a family.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Bennett played with the baby for a while before asking Nero, "Have you
        tested his Super-Gene?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "I did. The report said that his Super-Gene is extremely active and
        rare. He might be an extremely talented Esper in the future." Nero was
        overjoyed.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Is that so? That's not too bad." Bennett nodded and stroked the baby's
        sparse hair. The three of them played with the baby and walked away
        slowly.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Suddenly, the space around the area fluctuated slightly, and Han Xiao's
        figure walked out. He stood still and watched as the three left.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"How beautiful…"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao muttered to himself and turned to look at the Germinal
        Organization ruins. His path was already very far, but when he looked
        back, his past on this planet seemed to be right before his eyes, just
        yesterday.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Old memories flooded in like a tidal wave, and in a daze, images flashed
        past his eyes. He had transmigrated to the Germinal Organization base,
        spent half a year in darkness, escaped with great difficulty, drove an
        off-road vehicle under the moonlight, left Stardragon and transformed
        into Black Phantom, walked alone in the Wasteland, infiltrated the
        Germinal Organization to steal intelligence, and was chased for
        thousands of miles. The headquarters of the Germinal Organization had
        been reduced to ashes in the dazzling nuclear explosion…
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Similarly, human figures flashed in his eyes. The young Hila who was
        determined to enter the Abyss but was eventually dragged back by him,
        the young Aurora who was still optimistic about being saved by him
        despite being tortured, Bennett who worked hard to end the battle, the
        Germinal Organization leader who did not regret even after reaching the
        end of the road…
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The tragedy of the Mutation Disaster that followed also appeared before
        his eyes. The chaotic world, the crazy crowd, the endless beast tide,
        the spaceships that fell from the sky, the blazing cannons… everything
        came from DarkStar.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Two full versions of disasters. This place is really full of trouble
        and misfortune…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao closed his eyes. The storyline of Version 1.0 and Version 2.0
        flashed through his mind.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After a long time, he opened his eyes. He felt that his mind was calm,
        and there seemed to be some subtle changes in his body.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Somehow, the foundation of his Information Form seemed to have become
        thicker. It seemed like he had already set the first Information Form
        Anchor and connected it to Planet Aquamarine.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Planet Aquamarine…"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao slowly rose into the air. He looked down at the ruins of the
        Germinal Organization, then at the bustling city at the end of the
        horizon. He turned around and disappeared.
      </p>

      </h1>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The dark and deep universe seemed to be decorated with a curtain of
        diamonds. A silvery-white planet was rotating quietly. The surface of
        the planet was made of metal, and there were mechanical towers with
        sharp edges. They were connected to each other in the air, forming
        matrix-like patterns. The neat layout had an exquisite mechanical
        aesthetic.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This was the new main planet of Han Xiao's machinery civilization. It
        was located in the Supers Holy Land and was completely created by the
        Mechanical Lives. The size of the planet was extremely large, and it was
        integrated with the matter of several planets. The former Planet Apostle
        was also broken down and integrated into this planet.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Originally, Psionic Prime and the other Mechanical Oracles wanted to
        name this new main planet ‘Black Star Planet' as a sign of respect for
        the Lord God Black Star, but they were firmly rejected by Han Xiao. In
        the end, Psionic Prime and the other Oracles changed their minds and
        named this planet ‘Holy Planet'.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        On the bustling alloy path, mechanical lives of all shapes and sizes
        were bustling about. Some mechanical life's feet clashed with the ground
        as they walked, and some mechanical life's tires rubbed against the
        ground as they drove. Some mechanical life's engine tanks were
        constantly rumbling, and some mechanical life's exhaust pipes would
        spurt out gas from time to time, forming a strange tune with a strong
        mechanical feeling.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao walked among the mechanical army. His entire body was covered
        in camouflage, and he looked like an ordinary mechanical life form. All
        the nearby mechanical lives could not detect his presence. "This place
        is becoming more and more prosperous…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Han Xiao was glad.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After taking in the World Tree, he no longer needed the machinery
        civilization to produce mechanical soldiers all day. Thus, he stopped
        the basic command of troop production and allowed the machinery
        civilization to develop on its own. This was the first time he had
        carefully observed the changes of the machinery civilization after the
        war.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao's walking speed was slow, as though he was taking a stroll. His
        eyes kept looking left and right, sizing up the machines on the street.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Although the Mechanical Lives were produced in batches, and many of them
        had the same model, there were almost no identical Mechanical Lives on
        the streets. Even if they were Mechanical Lives of the same model, they
        added all kinds of personalized structures to themselves through
        self-modification. Some liked guns, some liked sharp blades, some liked
        heavy equipment, and some liked to run around naked… From the
        perspective of a normal life, it would be like the difference in
        clothes, hairstyle, makeup, and accessories.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In the shops along the street, Han Xiao also saw all kinds of products.
        Most of them were modification shops and parts malls. There were all
        kinds of mechanical parts and even different colored paints. The
        customer flow was huge, and there were mechanical lives coming in and
        out every second, ‘trying on clothes'.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Other than that, he also saw the specialty snack shop. The chef robot
        inside was cooking oil, lubricant maintenance gel, energy blocks, and
        other items. It placed them in a large pot to stir and cook, making all
        kinds of strange foods. Han Xiao took one and tried it. It tasted so bad
        that it almost broke his defenses.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, the other Mechanical Lives that came to purchase left in
        satisfaction and enjoyed their meal. In their eyes, it was a rare
        delicacy. There were also a few pairs of couple-like Mechanical Lives
        feeding each other.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao also saw the sensory stimulation shop. To mechanical lives, it
        was like an entertainment venue. Inside, it was connected to all kinds
        of senses and emotions, directly stimulating the artificial intelligence
        core. At the cost of a large sum, the mechanical lives could even
        directly upgrade their own emotion module through the shop's main
        system.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In a small alley at the side, Han Xiao saw a few small robots
        surrounding the alloy wall and doodling. Seeing that someone was coming,
        they quickly dispersed and flew away on electromagnetic wheels, like a
        bunch of rebellious street kids. The doodling on the wall was extremely
        wild, filled with a large amount of twisted bright colors. One could
        vaguely see that it was a portrait of the Supreme Heavenly Venerate.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In the originally cold and strict mechanical group, there was a strong
        personalization. A free culture was popular, and Han Xiao could see
        worldly customs from a group of mechanical bodies.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"The life of a Mechanical Life is quite similar…'</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Han Xiao smiled.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        All along, he had mainly treated the machinery civilization as a weapon
        factory and did not pay much attention to the changes in the life of the
        machinery civilization. It was only when he allowed the machinery
        civilization to reproduce freely that he finally saw the cultural trend.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As the Creator, he could guide the culture of the machinery
        civilization, but he did not do so. Instead, he allowed it to take shape
        naturally.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Only now did he feel that the machinery civilization was a little
        ‘civilized'.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        As he walked, Han Xiao realized that he had arrived at a huge mechanical
        square. There were two statues standing in the middle of the square,
        both of which were him. One was his normal self, and the other was his
        body in the Supreme Heavenly Venerate mechanical body.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The mechanical lives in the square were endless, and no one paid any
        attention to the statues. At most, they would stop and look at them for
        a second before walking away to continue their own lives. Their respect
        for Han Xiao was no longer as rigid as before but rather placed in their
        ‘hearts'. Han Xiao came to the foot of the statue and looked up.
        Suddenly, he saw a tall mechanical life carrying a small mechanical body
        that looked similar.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He turned around and saw that it seemed to be a harmonious father and
        son pair. The father let the child ride on his neck and kept teasing
        him.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao silently watched this scene. Images of the machinery
        civilization following him for the past few decades appeared in his
        mind. Countless mechanical lives were sent to the battlefield under his
        orders and used as cannon fodder. Countless unique sparks of
        consciousness were born in the AI chip circuit, disappearing into the
        cold universe together with the broken body.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Although he treated the Mechanical Lives as tools, due to the
        restrictions of the basic logic, they did not have any complaints. They
        buried their hobbies and interests and fought for him with their lives,
        still respecting him as the Creator.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "I don't need you guys to fight for me anymore. Enjoy your new life…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao shook his head. He would not cancel the base logic of the
        Mechanical Civilization's reverence for him, but he did not plan to
        order the Mechanical Civilization to fight either. He had already
        mastered the World Tree and (Virtual Creation-True), so he no longer
        needed these mechanical lives to work for him.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He took one last look at his statues, and memories flowed in his mind.
        He felt another Information Form Anchor being set up, and only then did
        he turn around and disappear into the bustling crowd.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In the new headquarters of the Black Star Army in Supers Holy Land.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao strolled around the base and hid himself. No one noticed his
        presence.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The huge base was very lively. Countless members of the Black Star Army
        were working there. People came and went, and from time to time, there
        would be people talking and laughing as they walked past Han Xiao.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He strolled around slowly and arrived at the area where the upper
        echelons were working. He saw Herlous, who was working on the desk,
        Sylvia, who was still trying to break through to Beyond Grade A,
        Aroshia, who was staring at the starry sky outside the window, Lagi, who
        was slacking, and Reynold, who had been maintaining the logistics
        department for decades…
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Looking at the current state of the Black Star Army, Han Xiao was a
        little dazed. The difficult memories from when he first started his
        force surfaced in his mind.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He remembered that he had just entered the galaxy back then, and he was
        still a ‘country bumpkin' who had come from a surface civilization. He
        was completely broke, and the only thing he could rely on was the cannon
        in his hand.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        These old comrades had followed him to build the army's current
        foundation and grew to where it was today with a third-rate mercenary
        group.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Everything seemed to have happened yesterday, and his memories were
        still fresh. The scenes of Herlous, Aroshia, Sylvia, and the others
        becoming mercenaries with him appeared in his mind. At that time,
        everyone was very young and fought with their lives on the line. Now,
        almost a hundred years had passed, and everyone had become important
        figures in the galaxy. They no longer needed to do things by themselves,
        and they had already achieved success. They now had a different life.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Thinking back, Han Xiao could not help but sigh at the passing of time.
        Everyone, including himself, had more or less changed. Perhaps they all
        missed their old selves even more… At the start, they were always the
        freshest, and in the future, they would always look at each other with
        disgust. As their careers progressed, their viewpoints changed, giving
        them the feeling of ‘if time could stop at the moment when we first
        started'.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, even though he was emotional, he still preferred the spiraling
        trend of things, allowing the path ahead to continue expanding and
        welcoming all kinds of changes.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Memories of the rise and expansion of the Black Star Army flashed
        through Han Xiao's mind. Suddenly, he felt another Information Form
        Anchor being generated. He nodded and disappeared.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At the same time, Herlous, Sylvia, Lagi, and the others, who were doing
        their own things, suddenly had a thought. For some reason, Han Xiao's
        figure suddenly appeared in their minds, and they could not get rid of
        it. They subconsciously thought of the dusty memories when they first
        fought with Han Xiao, and they stopped what they were doing and remained
        silent.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "What's wrong with me… Why do I suddenly miss Black Star so much?"

      </h1>
      <p class="calibre3">Holy Accord's headquarters.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao teleported over. Under everyone's surprised gazes, he passed
        through the complicated corridor and arrived at the confinement room of
        Destiny's Child.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Destiny's Child, who was soaking in the solution, woke up. He leaned
        closer and placed his hand on the inner wall of the container. Han Xiao
        smiled and placed his palm on the container.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This time, an experimenter walked over and asked curiously, "Your
        Excellency Black Star, what are your orders this time?" "Release
        Destiny's Child." Han Xiao pursed his mouth.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The experimenter was stunned and said with uncertainty, "Are you
        kidding? If we let it go, it will be very difficult to catch it again…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Let it go." Han Xiao shook his head.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Er… although you're also the leader of the Holy Accord, it's best if
        His Excellency Beiger gives the order personally…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"It's alright. I've already told him."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao showed Beiger's message and patted the researcher's shoulder.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"…I understand."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The experimenter did not understand, but he still did as he was told. He
        terminated the operation of the information stabilization device and put
        away the storage container, removing all restrictions on Destiny's
        Child.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Destiny's Child was finally exposed to the outside world, but he did not
        immediately enter the high-dimensional information form to escape.
        Instead, he floated beside Han Xiao and looked around curiously, as
        though surprised that he was released.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "You've helped me quite a bit. I believe that freedom is a pretty good
        reward." Han Xiao smiled and raised his hand to show the Destiny's Child
        mark on the back of his hand. "Also, we've already formed a connection.
        I just hope that you can help me one last time…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        With a slight exchange of consciousness, Destiny's Child understood what
        Han Xiao meant. He nodded lightly, and his body slowly turned into a
        high-dimensional information form, disappearing without a trace.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Will this really not be a problem? If we don't control Destiny's Child,
        and allow him to trigger the information state disturbances again, many
        more children will be born…" the experimenter could not help but say.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"It's alright, that's what I'm hoping."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Han Xiao waved his hands.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He had formed a connection with Destiny's Child, and their consciousness
        could communicate at any time. He hoped to use the information
        connection between Destiny's Child and many of his children to form a
        large net, forming a new information anchor point.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In addition, he suspected that Destiny's Child was not simple. Ever
        since he entered the dark side universe, he seemed to have been
        indirectly entangled with Destiny's Child… He had a feeling that
        Destiny's Child might not be a pure Primal Esper Ability Entity.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "If I'm not wrong, Destiny's Child has a special ability mechanism. He
        might have some kind of special connection with the Dark Side Universal
        Consciousness. He might even be one of the unconscious incarnations of
        the Dark Side Universal Consciousness."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao thought to himself. He put on the King and disappeared.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        One day later, in the conference room of the upper echelons of the
        Supers Holy Land.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        There were more than ten Beyond Grade As in the room, and Aurora sat in
        the main seat, maintaining her sisterly posture. Her long hair was tied
        up, and her slightly round and exquisite face tried to maintain a
        serious expression. "…I have already reviewed the recent reports. I
        discovered that the results of your work did not meet the expectations
        of the previous quarter. Although the Supers Holy Land has a stable
        position now, we are a force that has been established for just a few
        years. It is not the time to be lazy. I hope that everyone can take
        their jobs seriously…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Aurora kept a straight face and criticized the people present.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This meeting had already been going on for some time. She had initiated
        this small-scale meeting to encourage some of the upper echelons so that
        they would not slack off. Black Star had not been in charge recently,
        and Aurora had been acting as the leader for a long time. Now, she had
        also built up some prestige. The dozen or so people present gave her
        face and silently received the criticisms.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After talking for a while, Aurora finally stopped and said in a gentler
        tone, "Alright, that's all for today. I hope everyone can go back and
        supervise their respective departments and relay my message. Meeting
        dismissed."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Everyone nodded and left the room.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Only then did Aurora relax her body, no longer maintaining her smart and
        capable attitude. She grumbled at Han Xiao for not doing anything and
        left through another door.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After everyone left, Han Xiao's virtual figure appeared in the room. He
        looked in the direction where Aurora had left and smiled with relief.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Although Aurora liked to act young in front of him, they were actually
        around the same age. Han Xiao was quite happy to see Aurora acting
        dignified and serious. Now, she had more or less the aura of a leader,
        and she no longer needed someone else to protect her.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "She's no longer the little girl who needs protection…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao shook his head and smiled before walking around.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        A weak song suddenly sounded, and Han Xiao followed the sound to the
        rooftop.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Feidin was holding onto Chen Xing, and the two of them were on a date.
        They were sticking to each other as though superglued together.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Soul Swapper had separated their souls a long time ago, but the
        experience of existing as one had allowed the two of them to know each
        other's personalities even if they were separated. They only needed one
        look to guess what the other was thinking. There was no wall of hearts
        that could not be understood by the two, only the tacit understanding of
        soul mates.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao still remembered the reason Feidin and Chen Xing had coexisted
        as one. It was as if they had met by fate, and in the end, it became a
        puzzle that fit into their lives.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        All these years, his life had been smooth sailing, and it was also
        because of Feidin's good luck. His military medals, a small part of them
        was due to Feidin. "Tsk, a winner in life…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao looked at them from afar and left the rooftop quietly.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He could not help but think of Hila. Speaking of which, he and Hila had
        met each other by fate as well. On the first day he came to the dark
        side of the universe, he had already formed a bond with Hila. Back then,
        they were still enemies. He did not expect that they would support each
        other and travel together to this day.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        With a thought, Han Xiao arrived at Hila's residence. She had built the
        house beside the advanced cultivation room. Even though it was peaceful
        now, she did not slack off.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Hila had just finished her first round of training, so she left the
        training room. She returned to her room and a strange skeleton beast
        resembling a dog and a cat pounced on her.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Hila's usually indifferent face revealed a doting smile. She bent down
        and picked up the little skeleton beast, stroking its smooth and white
        bones. The little beast stretched comfortably in her arms.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao tilted his head, surprised. This was the first time he had seen
        Hila raise a pet.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Although this pet looked a little scary in his eyes, in the eyes of
        Hila, who controlled the power of death, this little skeleton beast was
        probably quite cute. As the saying went, beauty lay in the eyes of the
        beholder.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Seeing Hila slowly play with her pet, Han Xiao felt a little strange.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Raising a pet doesn't seem like something she would do…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In his eyes, Hila's personality had always been strong and cold. She
        pursued greater strength and would not waste her energy on unnecessary
        things, making people stay away from her. Now that she had a hobby…
        well, having a hobby made her more of a normal person.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "This is good. She finally found some interest in life…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Han Xiao turned around and left.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He strolled around the Supers Holy Land and observed the lives of the
        various Beyond Grade As. He saw many Beyond Grade As who no longer
        needed to fight with others and focused on their careers. It was as if
        most of them had found the peace and quiet that they had not felt in a
        long time. Very soon, Han Xiao arrived at the business department and
        saw it bustling. In the office, a group of executives was queuing up to
        receive Sorokin's instructions.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He took a closer look and saw that Sorokin's body was emitting a faint
        light, and he was in the revival state. His face was full of energy, and
        he was in high spirits as he arranged the business plans in an orderly
        manner.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Under Sorokin's leadership, the economic development of the Supers Holy
        Land had been booming. Sorokin felt as though he had met a second spring
        in his career, and he had finally found a stage to showcase his
        strength.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Not long after, Han Xiao walked past all the departments and finally
        arrived at the square. There were statues of all the Beyond Grade As
        there.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        His gaze swept across everyone's statues, and the experiences he had
        with the Beyond Grade As over the past few decades surfaced in his mind.
        Under the hard work of himself and a few pinnacle Beyond Grade As, the
        Beyond Grade As had gone from a pile of loose sand to a tightly-knit
        collective of benefits. The creation of the Supers Holy Land gave
        everyone a place of refuge, bearing witness to the fruits of their
        decades of hard work.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Although there was some animosity between them, in the end, these
        hundreds of statues represented the Beyond Grade As who had fought
        alongside him for decades. They could be considered comrades who had
        fought together.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"We can be considered partners…"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao closed his eyes and vaguely felt a new information anchor being
        generated. He then turned around and left.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At the same time, all the Beyond Grade As in the Supers Holy Land
        suddenly felt something and looked up in the direction where Han Xiao
        had disappeared.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Half a day later, Han Xiao, as an uninvited guest, arrived in the
        Mechanical Race territory.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Mechanical Race was no stranger to a big shot like Han Xiao, and
        they welcomed him.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        A young Mechanic came out to receive them and brought Han Xiao to the
        guest room.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Your Excellency Black Star, may I ask why you're here?" As soon as he
        sat down, the young Mechanic asked curiously.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"I want to meet Manison and catch up with him."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Han Xiao smiled.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Among the many Beyond Grade A comrades, Manison was the most special
        one.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The two of them had been ‘in love' for decades, and Han Xiao had even
        ‘inherited' many of Manison's abilities. Therefore, Manison had a
        special position in Han Xiao's heart. He felt that Manison might be able
        to bring him a new Information Form Anchor, so he came to visit.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, this young Mechanic shook his head and rejected his request.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "I'm sorry, Your Excellency Black Star. His Excellency Mechanic Emperor
        is going to conduct a long period of closed-door research. No visitor is
        to be allowed."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Me too?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "My teacher has already instructed me, especially you…" the young
        Mechanic replied carefully. "Heh, this guy really doesn't hide it at
        all. I thought our relationship had eased up a lot."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao then sized up the young man before him and asked,
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"You're Manison's student? What's your name?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Allow me to formally introduce myself. I am a new student that my
        teacher accepted two years ago. My name is Marigo Morgan, and I am
        temporarily in charge of the Mechanical Race's affairs for him.
        Greetings, Your Excellency Black Star." This person nodded politely.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "He actually accepted a new student and didn't even inform me." Han Xiao
        was amazed.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Seeing that Manison was not willing to reminisce, Han Xiao did not
        hesitate and expressed his intention to leave.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Arriving at the Moon Platform, Han Xiao was about to board the ship and
        leave when he suddenly realized that a new Information Form Anchor had
        been created.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He looked back at the depths of the Mechanical Race territory and smiled
        mysteriously. He then closed the hatch, activated the spaceship, and
        escaped into space. At the same time, deep within the Mechanical Race's
        territory.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Manison, who was in seclusion studying the technology, raised his head
        and looked in the direction that Han Xiao left through the wall. He did
        not say much and lowered his head to continue his research.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Humph, annoying fellow…</p>

      <p class="calibre3">Ancient Star Desert, a certain dead planet.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Green moonlight hung in the sky, and the cracked black earth was in
        perpetual silence. Not a single blade of grass could be seen, and there
        was not even a hint of green. Occasionally, broken buildings could be
        seen stuck in the ground, and the parts that emerged were filled with
        mottled traces of wind erosion. The exquisite carvings were already
        blurry, and there were also shattered statues of people lying on the
        ground. Some only had half a head, while others only had half a body.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This area seemed to be the ruins of some abandoned city buried by time.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        A small spaceship was hovering one meter above the ground, emitting a
        light blue field that covered dozens of kilometers, providing remote
        energy and life support functions. The silver-gold spaceship had a
        narrow front and wide back, forming a triangular shape. Its exterior
        armor was also engraved with the insignias of the Supers Holy Land,
        Black Star Army, and Floating Dragon Island. This was a special high-end
        spaceship that had yet to be mass-produced by the army's logistics
        department. It was equipped with all kinds of cutting-edge technology
        and could break through the speed limit of level five warp speed to
        reach level 17.7. It was quite expensive.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At this moment, under the spaceship's life support field, about five
        hundred meters underground, two figures were slowly trekking through a
        maze-like ruin.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "These are the ruins of the capital of the Fifth Dynasty, and also the
        last remains of the people of Tersrand. Their civilization perished at
        the end of the exploration era, and the scavengers later dug out some
        ancient objects, which allowed the ruins of this civilization to see the
        light of day again. Speaking of which, they were unlucky. Who would have
        thought that their mother planet was once the resting place of a group
        of giant galactic beasts countless years ago? The awakening of the
        ancient beasts brought about a disaster to their civilization…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Harrison stroked the blurry engravings on the wall of the underground
        palace as he spoke. Jenny hugged the child and listened with interest.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Jenny had already given birth to a child. After recuperating on Floating
        Dragon for a few months, Harrison's desire for adventure grew, and Jenny
        could not stay idle either. The two of them set off immediately. Using
        their connections, they took a cutting-edge spaceship from the army
        logistics department for free and explored everywhere.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Because they were carrying a child, it was not suitable for them to go
        to places that were too dangerous. Thus, Harrison decided to take Jenny
        to tour archaeological sites. For this reason, he specially joined the
        Spacetime Research Council and read the records of a large number of
        lost civilizations. He was determined to be a ‘good tour guide'.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The three of them were currently wearing the new generation interstellar
        exploration mechanical suits produced by the army. It could withstand
        all kinds of extreme environments, and the baby's mechanical suit was
        specially made, and even had a series of functions such as mental
        stability, sleeping, and automatic diaper changing… Harrison stopped in
        front of a row of broken statues, pointed at them, and smiled.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "This is the underground palace that the last King of Tersrand built for
        the past kings when he was young. In the eyes of ordinary people, he
        built it to honor the previous kings, but in fact, according to the
        records in some books, he built this underground palace to cover up a
        natural tunnel that goes deep underground. There was a young Ancient
        Beast inside, and he wanted to tame it secretly. He wanted to use this
        external force to break the grip that the Prince Regent had on his
        authority… It sounds boring, right? It's also a boring political
        struggle in the palace, but you definitely won't be able to guess what
        happened."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "He accidentally awakened more ancient beasts and destroyed the
        civilization?" Jenny was curious.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Haha, you guessed wrong. He awakened this ancient beast, but he fell in
        love with it. Due to the special genes of the ancient beast, the closer
        the last Tersrand King got to the ancient beast, the more his bloodline
        mutated. In the end, he transformed into a new ancient beast at the
        court assembly and personally led the ancient beast to destroy the
        capital…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Is this love that transcends species? Or is this a mental hint from the
        ancient beast?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Jenny's eyes widened. Although interspecies dating was very common, it
        was still quite impactful to hear of it.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Harrison shook his head. "I'm not sure. Only the person involved knows."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"What happened then?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "After that, the slumbering ancient beasts woke up one after another and
        escaped into the starry sky. The last Tersrand King was nowhere to be
        found. Some said that he disappeared into the starry sky with the
        ancient beasts. Some said that he stayed with his partner in the ruins
        of his mother planet and wandered in this dead land forever…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Sounds a little romantic," Jenny said.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Haha, we might even be able to find their corpses here. This is the
        purpose of our exploration."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Harrison laughed.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The two of them chatted casually as they went deeper into the
        underground palace. Most of the time, Harrison was the one talking,
        while Jenny was the one listening. Not long after, they finally arrived
        at the end of the underground palace. There was a tunnel blocked by
        rocks.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Harrison casually shattered the rocks with a punch, revealing a broken
        staircase that descended diagonally. He walked in with Jenny, and after
        walking for a long time, they finally arrived at the end. It was a
        cave-like space. Two beast skeletons were hugging each other as if they
        were lying dead in each other's arms.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Could this be the last Tersrand King and his partner?" Jenny was
        curious.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "I think so… Looks like they decided to stay here to accompany each
        other and sleep together forever."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Harrison's eyes sparkled. He recorded a series of videos, picked up a
        few bones, and stored them. He planned to bring them back for research.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, right at this moment, the ground suddenly shook. The two of
        them felt the cave shaking, and the tremors gradually grew larger. Soon,
        the ground began to shake.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Boom!</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The sound of the earth veins moving could be heard. It was getting
        louder and louder, like the earth was roaring.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Is it collapsing?".</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Harrison's heart skipped a beat, and he immediately flew back with
        Jenny.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, halfway through, the entire underground palace collapsed.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Hong Long LongCountless rocks fell, filling up all the gaps. Looking
        down from above, the ground had instantly collapsed, turning into a huge
        crater.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, right at this moment, a force field with a faint green glow
        suddenly descended from the sky, tearing the surface of the planet
        apart. Under the guidance of the force field, a round ball of soil broke
        out from the ground and flew for a distance before finally landing
        beside the spaceship.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The ball shook, and the dirt and rocks on it fell off, revealing a round
        blue shield. The armors of Harrison and the other two could sense the
        impact of the outside world, so they automatically opened their shields.
        This small scene could not cause any damage to them, and the three of
        them were completely unharmed
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This time, Ames, who was wearing a black dress, landed from the sky and
        floated in front of the three of them. With a helpless expression, she
        said with dissatisfaction,
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "How could you be so careless? I saw that you were buried alive the
        moment I arrived. Since you're carrying a child, don't go to such a
        dangerous place."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Ahem, an accident, an accident." Harrison was embarrassed. Although
        they would not be injured in the collapse, it would still take some time
        for them to climb out. He did not expect Ames to see them, which made
        him very embarrassed.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Jenny, on the other hand, did not have much of a reaction. She had been
        out with Harrison for more than a year, and they had been buried alive
        seven or eight times. Anyway, she would not get hurt, and she was used
        to it.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        With extraordinary strength, her definition of danger was definitely
        different from ordinary people. Jenny was not afraid of taking a small
        risk with her child, so she asked curiously, "Sis, how did you find us?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Phillip suddenly appeared and sat on Ames' shoulder, giving her a thumbs
        up.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Of course it's because of me, hum… I can locate all the spaceships
        produced by the army, hum…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Alright, I almost forgot that Black Star gave you the authority to
        mobilize the army's artificial intelligence… Then why are you looking
        for us personally? Can't we talk through the communicator? Why are you
        disturbing our time together?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Jenny curled her lips.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Ames turned to look at the sleeping child in Jenny's arms, a gentle
        smile on her face. "I missed my nephew. Can't I come and take a look?
        Quick, let me play with the child."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Don't even think about it! Don't you know how heavy your hand is? Every
        time I give him to you, you don't know how to cherish him at all. You
        don't care if it's not your child, right?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Jenny immediately objected and turned around to protect the child in her
        arms.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, Ames did not listen to her. Ignoring her objections, she
        controlled her force field and took the child from her arms. Then, she
        opened the mechanical suit and used her fingers to rub the child's
        chubby face, waking the child up. "Hey! Be gentler!" Jenny grabbed Ames'
        arm and yelled at Harrison, "What are you still doing there? Come and
        help!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Harrison smiled bitterly.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The sisters were having a fight, so he did not dare to meddle.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "What do you know? I'm using my energy to clear his body and build a
        good foundation for him."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Ames ignored Jenny and continued to rub the baby's face. Although she
        controlled her strength, she did not have any parenting knowledge, so
        she still made the baby cry.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Jenny could not win against Ames' strength, so she had no choice but to
        coax the child.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Don't you dislike children? Why are you always pestering me?" "Just
        because I didn't like them before doesn't mean I still don't like them."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Ames did not even turn around and continued to tease the child, finally
        making him laugh.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Jenny said unhappily, "If you like them, you can have them yourself. Why
        are you always playing with my child?" "What's the point of spending so
        much effort? Don't you have one here?" Ames blinked.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Jenny's mouth twitched. Sometimes, she really could not stand Ames'
        straightforward style.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        She was speechless for a while before asking curiously,
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Speaking of which, have you thought about whether or not you want to
        have a child with Black Star? He mentioned it more than once, but you
        never responded to him."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "…I haven't thought about it yet. Let's think about it again." Ames was
        a little hesitant.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "My good sister, how long have you been thinking about this?" Jenny was
        speechless. "Although you guys have a long lifespan, there still has to
        be a result from all the thinking about, right? Only Black Star spoils
        you. If it were someone else, they might have even created a race at
        this age."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Hearing this, Ames glanced at her and clicked her tongue in wonder.
        "Weren't you always unhappy about me accepting Black Star? Why are you
        now urging me to reproduce with him?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Jenny pursed her lips and did not speak.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In the past, she was indeed unhappy that Han Xiao was together with
        Ames, but now that she had a child, she wished that Han Xiao could make
        Ames unable to get out of bed every day so that she could have a happy
        life. This way, she and her child would not be harassed by Ames.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Buzz!</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Space rippled slightly, and Han Xiao stepped out from the void.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Hmm? Why are you here too?" Ames looked over and was surprised. "You
        borrowed Phillip's authority. Of course, I received the news." Han Xiao
        shrugged.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Then what are you doing here?" Ames narrowed her eyes and said with a
        strange tone. She still remembered what happened the last time and still
        had some emotions in her heart.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "My business is done for the time being. I came to accompany you." Han
        Xiao smiled.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Do you think I need you to accompany me now?" Ames raised Jenny's child
        and snorted.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao looked down at the child and saw Jenny giving him a look. He
        immediately walked forward, grabbed the child's clothes, and placed him
        in Jenny's hands. He smiled and said, "Since you like children so much,
        let's have one too."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "You are on that again?" Ames looked around. "Didn't I reject you?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao hugged Ames' waist as though there was no one else around. He
        smiled and said, "No matter how many times you reject, I will ask you
        again and again until you agree."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Hmph, shameless… I thought a bigshot like you wouldn't have any
        obsession with your descendants. I didn't expect you to still be so
        vulgar." Ames did not break free from Han Xiao's embrace. She only
        placed her hands on Han Xiao's chest and leaned back slightly, not
        letting him get close.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao pondered for a few seconds before speaking from the bottom of
        his heart, "The world is filled with ups and downs. No matter who we
        are, we need something to anchor our existence, be it ideals, beliefs,
        or feelings… I have already made a choice. Let everything enter a new
        era, turning us into unique existences. There will no longer be a cycle,
        so I don't know what will happen in the future. I just hope that I have
        another place in this world that I will never forget."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Oh, how rare. You actually know how to coax me… Don't you remember me
        well enough?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Isn't it better to go deeper?".</p>
      <p class="calibre3">"…Are you teasing me?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "What else? What do you think my hand is doing?" The two of them had
        been intimate with each other countless times, so they were not shy at
        all. As they exchanged glances, their words became more and more
        explicit.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Seeing that the situation was not looking good, Harrison and Jenny
        quietly boarded the spaceship. They quickly started the engine, and the
        thrusters shot out flames as they quickly took off.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Very soon, the spaceship left outer space, and the planet became further
        and further away.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, before Harrison could catch his breath, the planet behind him
        suddenly shook violently, and the surface of the planet shattered. A
        huge crater that could be seen from outer space exploded, and the
        shockwave swept out, sending countless sand and stones flying. It was as
        if the planet had suffered an unbearable impact.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Immediately after, the planet seemed to have suffered an invisible blow.
        The surface of the planet caved in, and the entire crust shattered like
        an eggshell. All the matter caved in at the center, and the surface
        became riddled with holes.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "These two adulterers really think we don't exist…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Jenny was both angry and excited, as though she wanted to see the world
        burn. Her face was red, and she cheered them on in her heart.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The next moment, a blinding light burst forth, and the planet exploded!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Boom!</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        An intense wave of energy spread out and caught up to the tail of the
        spaceship. It even activated the protective shield and sent the
        spaceship flying. After a while, the spaceship stabilized.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Harrison wiped off his cold sweat and looked back at the scene of the
        planet's explosion. He swallowed his saliva with a complicated
        expression.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Luckily, we ran fast enough… It's a pity that these ruins…"

        A few days later, on a residential planet in the Ancient Star Desert.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Gasp, this woman…"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao walked on the bustling streets and passed through the crowd. He
        activated the invisibility function and was not discovered by the
        passersby. He rubbed his waist from time to time and mumbled softly.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        It was not easy for him to appease Ames and leave an Information Form
        Anchor. He was finally able to leave the crime scene and go to the other
        metropolitan planets. He planned to take a stroll and find a new
        Information Form Anchor.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "I already have quite a few Information Form Anchors on me. I can feel
        that my Information Form base has become much stronger, but I feel like
        I'm still lacking something…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Han Xiao looked around as he pondered.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After walking for a while, he suddenly stopped and looked ahead.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Not far in front was a Wayne Cards store. There was a huge crowd at the
        entrance, and there was a long queue. On the side was a poster of
        himself, on which were written the names of various stores and offers.
        Today was the day of the release of the Black Star series.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In front of the shop, a shop assistant was shouting.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "This set of ‘Black Star' series has a total of twenty-four cards,
        including the Black Star cards from different time periods. There are
        also thirteen new cards, all equipped with holographic effects. The
        appearance, attack, defense, and activation of special effects all have
        different holographic images. The collection value is extremely high,
        and this is a new product that Wayne Card's fanatics absolutely cannot
        miss. There are only eight thousand sets in our store, and each person
        can only buy two at most. It's a limited sale…" In front of the shop, a
        long line of people was rubbing their fists and palms. Their faces were
        full of anticipation, like a group of lively leeks waiting to be
        harvested.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">vas</p>
      <p class="calibre3">"This is a single-player set for me?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao blinked and did not know whether to laugh or cry.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Although Wayne Cards included most of the famous people in the galaxy,
        there was only a handful of them who had a whole set for themselves,
        which showed how shocking his popularity was in the galactic society.
        Speaking of which, shouldn't his portrait usage fees be increased this
        year?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Right at this moment, Han Xiao suddenly felt a jolt in his intuition. He
        sensed a new Information Form Anchor, and his expression changed
        slightly. Wait, could Wayne Cards also be an Information Form Anchor…
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">an</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He quickly narrowed his eyes and sensed for a while before heaving a
        sigh of relief.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The next moment, he opened his Virtual Vision and instantly covered the
        entire planet. The lives of the galactic residents jumped into his eyes.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao saw that some people had posted his posters at home, some had
        bought his figurines, some were watching movies and series based on him…
        All the galactic residents who were related to him were marked and lit
        up in his vision.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "This Information Form Anchor is from the galactic society itself…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Han Xiao pondered.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He had brought countless changes to the galactic society which deviated
        from the trajectory of his previous life. These were all signs that he
        had been there. The changes he brought to this world were all
        Information Form Anchors.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After experiencing all kinds of storms, the galactic society finally had
        the long-lost peace. Behind every galactic citizen's peaceful and happy
        life was his image. The respect and memories of everyone in the galactic
        society were the biggest Information Form Anchor. As the galactic
        residents lit up one after another in his Virtual Vision, Han Xiao felt
        that this Information Form Anchor was getting stronger and stronger
        along with his Information Form base.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Han Xiao understood.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Perhaps this was the most important Information Form Anchor, to
        personally witness the changes he had brought to this world, to see the
        new life he had brought to countless people… to walk through the mortal
        world, to see all living things, to anchor himself to the entire world.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Come to think of it, is this the scene of Immortal Cultivation or
        Cthulhu…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao laughed to himself before retracting his smile. He stood still
        and fully activated his Virtual Ability. The next moment, countless
        Virtual Souls split up and spread out along the quantum network, taking
        in the lives of countless people.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The citizens of the planets were lit up one after another, and the
        Virtual Vision seemed to see a bright galaxy. The Information Form
        Anchor seemed to have absorbed endless nutrients and was continuously
        growing.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Central Galaxy, three Universal Civilizations' conference room.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The remote projections of Marbruce and the other two sat behind the
        table, whispering to each other from time to time, their eyes fixed on
        the door.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Strange, why isn't Black Star here yet?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "I've already sent him a message, but he hasn't replied. I wonder if he
        received any news from today's meeting?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "He must have received it. He probably just can't be bothered to reply.
        Recently, he's been busy preparing for the Information Form conversion…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Speaking of which, what does he need to prepare? I saw that the
        intelligence department recently reported that Black Star has been
        visiting various civilizations and constantly releasing and receiving
        data on the quantum network. I wonder what use this has for our plan?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">c</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "I don't understand, but he's the user of the Information Form
        Materialization device. He definitely knows what he's doing…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">The three of them discussed softly.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        During this period, they had also been preparing for the conversion and
        had completed a series of preparations.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Although Han Xiao was in control of the Information Form Materialization
        device, it was not something that could be activated immediately.
        According to the messages in the Sanctum, there were many more
        supporting facilities required to transform the entire dark side
        universe. What the three Universal Civilizations were doing was creating
        a large number of supporting facilities for the Information Form
        Materialization device and installing them in different areas. The
        blueprints were provided by Han Xiao, and they were all supplementary
        devices used to enhance the transformation of the Information Form
        state.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The three Universal Civilizations had spent a lot of manpower and
        resources to install these parts, and the hardware had already been
        settled. Now, they only had the problem of overall planning, which could
        only be carried out after the official implementation of the conversion
        was finalized. Many of these were trivial matters, but the three
        Universal Civilizations handled them well, so Han Xiao gave them all
        these miscellaneous tasks.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        While the three of them were chatting, the door suddenly opened, and the
        secretary led Han Xiao in. He then left and closed the door, leaving the
        room for a few big shots.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Black Star, you're late. We thought you wouldn't be coming today."
        Marbruce heaved a sigh of relief.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "I was preparing for the conversion and was delayed."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao casually explained. The three of them wanted to say something,
        but suddenly, their expressions became strange.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Although Han Xiao's appearance did not change, for some reason, they
        felt that the feeling Han Xiao gave them was completely different from
        the last time they met.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Black Star's aura gave them an indescribable feeling, as though they
        were staring at a black hole.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "You seem a little different…" Marbruce said hesitantly, suspecting that
        it was his imagination.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "I've deepened my connection with the dark side universe. This is
        normal."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Han Xiao waved his hands casually.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        During this period of time, he had visited most of the civilizations in
        the galactic society and integrated all beings into his heart,
        perfecting the last Information Form Anchor. At this point, his
        Information Form base had become extremely solid, making him give off
        the presence of everything returning to one.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao did not elaborate further. He paused for a moment before
        asking,
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"I'm almost done preparing. What about you</p>
      <p class="calibre3">guys?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "We're more inclined to spend some time to verify all the information in
        the Sanctum… but in principle, we're all willing to cooperate with your
        actions to carry out the conversion plan. We're just short of time."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Alright, the transformation won't happen overnight. It might take a few
        years, or it might take dozens or even hundreds of years. Therefore, the
        earlier we start, the better."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Yes, we're having a meeting with you now to discuss the exact date."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">The three of them nodded.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Alright, let's have a chat."</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        After Han Xiao finished speaking, he exhaled lightly.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">I've finally come this far…</p>
    </div>

    <div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-1462">

      </h1>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The meeting between the two parties did not last long. In the end, the
        date was set to be after nine years. Without the entire galactic society
        knowing, the fate of the dark universe they were in was decided.
        Countless galactic residents were still immersed in a peaceful and happy
        life. In places that they could not see, the three Universal
        Civilizations and Han Xiao were silently preparing for the
        transformation of the dark side universe into the true universe.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The days were approaching the official implementation of the plan. In
        the long-lost era of peace, the days flew by. The sun rose and the moon
        set, and time flowed like water, never to return. Nine years passed
        quietly as the various large organizations rested.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The affairs of the galactic society had changed, and a new generation of
        young people had grown up, but nothing seemed to have changed. The three
        Universal Civilizations, the Supers Holy Land, and the Super Star
        Cluster Alliance still occupied one side of the explored universe. Today
        was the appointed date, and also the starting point for the fate of the
        Dark Side Universe. In the Central Galaxy, the military forbidden zone
        that the three Universal Civilizations had specially built for this day.
        Countless Information Form reaction strengthening devices formed a dense
        and neat formation in the galaxy.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        They were distributed layer by layer and formed a spherical shape. Han
        Xiao was at the center of all the support device formations, floating
        alone in space. Far away, the fleets of the three Universal
        Civilizations were surrounded by layers of guards to prevent any
        accidents from disturbing Han Xiao's transformation.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        In the main ship, the remote projections of the three Rulers looked at
        Han Xiao outside the porthole with a solemn expression.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Your Excellency Black Star, we are all prepared. Please…" Marbruce
        paused, took a deep breath, and spoke in the communication channel.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "… begin." "…Okay." Han Xiao replied with a calm expression. A
        complicated look was seen in his eyes. Although he had rehearsed for
        this day more than once in the past nine years, he could not help but
        feel emotional when it actually happened. The plan for the conversion of
        the dark universe was still a top secret of the upper echelons.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The three Universal Civilizations hoped to quietly solve this ultimate
        problem that involved the truth of the universe when countless galactic
        residents were asleep. It would be best if the dark universe could be
        merged with the real universe without anyone noticing. Therefore, Han
        Xiao only told Ames and a few other trustworthy people about this
        information. The others continued to live their normal lives up to this
        day. Han Xiao sank his consciousness into his body, and his chest slowly
        lit up. It was as if he had turned into a white spatial tunnel, where
        space folded and contracted.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Very soon, in dazzling white light, the World Tree that was rooted in
        his inner space appeared in the outside world, emitting a green light
        that was full of vitality. Han Xiao lowered his head and looked at the
        miniature World Tree. His mind was already connected, and he could
        activate the Information Form solidification function at any time.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        However, at this moment, he stopped, and his eyes turned dreamy.
        Information Form Anchors flashed in his mind one after another, and his
        eyes seemed to be filled with a rippling illusion. It was as if he was
        using the perspective of a third party to relive his hundreds of years
        of strange and magnificent life. The final scene was fixed on countless
        familiar figures. There were old acquaintances, deceased enemies,
        present friends…
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "I hope that everything that happened here will be able to anchor my
        existence. Don't let me forget… I've been here before." The next moment,
        Han Xiao no longer hesitated and activated the Information Form
        solidification function of the World Tree.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Buzz!</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Han Xiao's figure was instantly drowned by the light akin to the Big
        Bang of the universe. It was as if endless light was spraying out,
        filling everyone's vision. At this moment, everyone in the galactic
        society felt something and subconsciously thought of Black Star.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Floating Dragon Island, top floor of the palace. Ames stood on the
        balcony with her hands behind her back, looking up at the bright galaxy.
        Her long hair and black dress fluttered in the wind like black flames.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Mom, I just thought of Dad…" A childish voice sounded behind her, and a
        little girl in a dress ran out of the room. She tripped and almost fell
        along the way. This little girl was about seven or eight years old. She
        looked like she was carved from jade, and her face was a little chubby.
        Her eyes were as black as gems, and she looked lively.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        She looked very cute and festive. She was the only offspring that Ames
        and Han Xiao had. Ames turned around with a doting expression. She
        hugged her daughter and rubbed her nose. "I miss Daddy too." The little
        girl hugged Ames' arm and stayed comfortably in her embrace. She blinked
        her big eyes and said with a little grievance,
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Daddy hasn't come to see me for a long time. Where did he go?". "He's
        doing a huge job outside right now."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Ames smiled.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "When will Daddy be back?" The little girl's eyes widened with
        curiosity.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"I don't know either…"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Ames shook her head. She hugged her daughter with one hand and pointed
        at the deep starry sky with the other. "However, no matter where he is,
        he will definitely watch over you. When you grow up, he will return."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The real universe, the Solar System, behind Neptune. A small exploration
        space station covered in black and blue paint floated quietly in outer
        space, disguised as a meteorite. It looked inconspicuous. At this
        moment, in the observation room of the space station, a few intelligent
        creatures wearing heavy spacesuits were adjusting their equipment.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Their bodies were shaped like humans, but they had hard skin covered in
        spikes. They were short, about 1.3 meters on average. Most of these
        instruments were remote observation devices. Above the instruments was a
        dense screen, showing scenes of cities on Earth.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At this time, one of the spiked humanoids in the room turned on the
        video recorder, cleared his throat, and spoke in his unique language.
        "The 27,081st Planetary Year, Information Record. The observed target's
        behavior is the same as before. There are no abnormalities. We have yet
        to be discovered. Over."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"Another boring day!"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        A thin, spiked humanoid beside him interrupted and stretched lazily in
        his seat. The hard shell and bones in his body made crackling sounds.
        The person recording the video seemed to be the captain. Without turning
        his head, he replied seriously, "The best news is that there are no
        abnormalities. Our job is to ensure that there is no technological boom
        on the observation target before the main force arrives, in the event
        that they develop a galactic weapon that can threaten us."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Yes, yes, yes. I'm just complaining. I really hope that the next shift
        will come soon. I'd rather freeze and sleep than stare at this weak
        surface civilization every day… Sigh, I really want to go home."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The thin humanoid who had spoken earlier sounded helpless.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This group of intelligent creatures did not belong to this region. They
        were distant visitors from another Star System, from the Kabang
        Civilization. In order to find any extraterrestrial civilizations, the
        Kabang Civilization sent out exploration squads to the galaxy. They took
        the exploration spaceships with the stealth function constantly
        activated and drifted in the universe for a long period of time. All the
        crew members were put in cryostasis. When the traces of civilization
        were discovered, the artificial intelligence system of the spaceships
        would automatically wake up the dormant crew members.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This group of Kabangs was one of the galactic explorers. Many years ago,
        when they came to the Solar System, the spaceship discovered the
        detector that the Earth Civilization had sent out into outer space, thus
        awakening the team. This team locked onto the Earth Civilization through
        the detection equipment of the spaceship, then chose a remote location,
        expanded their spaceship into a small space station, completed their
        disguise, and hid there.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This Kabang exploration team held the principle of not interfering, not
        communicating, and not exposing themselves. They quietly waited in the
        Solar System and used the galactic observation equipment provided by the
        spaceship to monitor Earth for a long time without being discovered.
        "Stop complaining and pay more attention to your mission."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The captain of the Kabang Explorer turned off the video recorder,
        paused, and said, "The main force is only five hundred and eighty
        Planetary Years away from us. We won't need to monitor them for too long
        and will be free."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "That's true. I really want to end the mission as soon as possible. I
        really can't stand eating these nutrition ointments every day. I really
        want to go back and eat something good…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The skinny Kabang member said with longing. This team of explorers had
        long sent the news of the existence of Earth civilization back to their
        mother planet. The large fleet of the Kabang Civilization had already
        set off from their hometown, but they had not developed to the level of
        the stargate technology. The large fleet had been traveling in the
        universe near the speed of light for a very long time, and they were not
        far from them now.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The many explorers present had been hiding in the Solar System for many
        years and were only outposts. Although their technology was far ahead,
        they still did not dare to rashly come into contact with the Earth
        Civilization. Their mission was to monitor the Earth Civilization all
        day long and guide the subsequent main force…
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Only when their main forces arrived would they have sufficient
        confidence. Whether it was invading the colonies or destroying them, it
        would be a piece of cake. They would then think about how to deal with
        this surface civilization.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The Kabang Explorer captain was about to say something, but at that
        moment, the space station's surveillance radar suddenly sounded with an
        urgent notification. Beep! Beep! Beep!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">uup</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Everyone was stunned. They quickly moved closer to the screen and were
        shocked. They saw that the readings on the screen were all messed up.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"What's going on?"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        This group of Kabang explorers quickly adjusted the instrument, but
        there were no problems with it. The various parameters of the outside
        world were showing more and more abnormalities, especially the curvature
        of space. At the same time, with the Earth civilization as the center, a
        large number of spatial folds appeared, spreading outward at an
        astonishing speed.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "What is this? There are no similar events in the database!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Everyone's eyes widened in shock.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At this time, an invisible energy wave suddenly erupted and spread
        toward the universe. It instantly swept across the various planets and
        the space station they were in. The energy reading instantly exceeded
        the power limit of the radar and caused it to burn. Everyone was shocked
        and quickly touched their bodies, but they did not suffer any damage
        from this energy. "This level of energy surge is unprecedented. What
        happened…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Just as the group of them was feeling extremely surprised, the spatial
        folds had already spread to the vicinity of the space station. Through
        the porthole, they discovered that all the space within their sights was
        in ripples, like that of blanket folds. From their point of view, it was
        as if the entire universe had turned into a quagmire.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The torrent formed by starlight and dark matter was constantly spinning.
        Amidst the layers of wrinkles, they seemed to see a strange illusion.
        Countless civilizations and planets that they had never seen before were
        floating and vanishing. Suddenly, they had a sort of premonition. This
        universe seemed to be changing.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "Attention, everyone! The new version will be released in five minutes.
        Everyone, work overtime today and log in immediately. I'm going to check
        on you, do you hear me?" Zhu Xiaohua ordered loudly. Seeing that the
        dozens of employees in the workshop all responded, he nodded with
        satisfaction, turned around, walked into his private office, closed the
        door, and looked at the new Galaxy game cabin in the middle of the room.
        He rubbed his hands excitedly.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Ever since the Black Star Army video series made with the ID
        ‘Bun-Hit-Dog' became popular, Zhu Xiaohua's career was on track. He
        rented a floor to use as a studio and expanded his business, making a
        brand.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Currently, Galaxy's popularity had reached its peak in history, and he
        was paying more attention to this main business. Galaxy had entered the
        version update two days ago, and today was the day the update would be
        completed. Version 6.0 would be officially released, so he took it very
        seriously and was prepared to log in as soon as possible. The thought of
        the new version unlocking a higher level made Zhu Xiaohua's heart itch.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Although the storyline of "Galaxy" seemed to be heading toward peace,
        and it would be very difficult to find any more explosive points, he
        believed that the players would be the main characters of the stage
        after "Galaxy".
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Now that they had been unlocked to the Calamity Grade, as their level
        continued to increase, the players who wished for the world to be in
        chaos would definitely not be able to hold themselves back. They would
        definitely cause chaos in the game, which would lead to countless
        conflicts and interesting exciting stories. This way, there would
        definitely be no lack of materials to make videos…
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Zhu Xiaohua already had an idea, and he planned to adjust the focus of
        the video.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He would no longer focus on the Black Star Army but on the various
        experiences of the players and NPC organizations, making it into various
        series and interview records.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Just thinking about the endless supply of materials and the possibility
        of a huge sale made him extremely excited. "I'm going to be rich again!"
        Zhu Xiaohua was in an excited mood as he skillfully lay down in the game
        cabin.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The hatch closed, and the countdown timer for the update was displayed
        on the screen. He stared with his eyes wide open at the time passing by
        in seconds. He could not help but shake his legs as he felt that time
        was passing too slowly.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "There are only a few seconds left… Five, four, three, two, one!
        Alright!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        At the last second, the countdown on the built-in screen turned into a
        login interface, and it finally became version 6.0.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Zhu Xiaohua was overjoyed and could not wait to start the game cabin. He
        quickly closed his eyes and prepared to enter the game. However, after
        waiting for more than a minute with his eyes closed, he did not enter
        the Galaxy like before. Zhu Xiaohua could not help but open his eyes.
        "Strange, why can't I log in? Is the game cabin malfunctioning? It can't
        be, this was changed two days ago…"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Zhu Xiaohua opened the game cabin in confusion and climbed out again.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He squatted down to see if there was a problem with the lid of the game
        cabin. However, at this moment, there was a knock on the door. A few
        employees walked in with helpless expressions. "Boss, there's a problem.
        None of us can log

        "Hmm? So I'm not the only one. Looks like it's not about the game cabin.
        Have you seen the official website?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "I did. It seems like no one can log in." Hearing this, Zhu Xiaohua was
        stunned for a moment. He walked to the computer, opened the "Galaxy"
        official website, and entered the forums. He realized that there were a
        lot of players posting, but none of them could log in. "It seems like
        there's a bug in the new version.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Maybe the photon processor itself is malfunctioning… But that's strange
        too. No one can log in. The officials will probably send a notice to
        explain such a huge matter. Why is there no response?" Zhu Xiaohua
        browsed through the post, puzzled. "Why don't you ask?" an employee
        suggested. "Hmm, okay. I'll ask the officials."
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">Zhu Xiaohua nodded.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        He had been invited to attend a few Pro League seasons as a guest, so he
        had an internal channel to contact the officials and ask about the
        situation.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Zhu Xiaohua picked up his phone from the table and opened his social
        media app. He found an official he knew and was about to send a message
        to ask. However, at this moment, there was a commotion outside the
        office. "What's going on outside? Why is it so noisy?" Zhu Xiaohua
        frowned, paused his message, and walked out of the office. He saw all
        the employees gathered by the window, looking up as though they were
        looking at something.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        "What are you guys looking at? Go back to your posts… Hmm?"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Zhu Xiaohua was a little dissatisfied. He walked over with large strides
        and also leaned close to the window. He subconsciously looked outside
        and suddenly paused.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        On the road outside the window, all the pedestrians stopped and looked
        up at the sky. All the balconies and windows of the surrounding
        buildings had people sticking their heads out, looking up at the sky,
        their faces filled with shock. Seeing this strange scene, Zhu Xiaohua's
        heart tightened. He slowly looked up at the sky.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        The evening had just passed, and night had just fallen. A bright galaxy
        had already appeared in the sky, and more stars were shining in the
        night sky. The stars were like waterfalls, hanging upside down in the
        Milky Way, swaying and spinning. The sky seemed to have become a
        whirlpool, completely distorted as if someone was stirring the sky.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"This, this is…"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Zhu Xiaohua stared blankly at this scene, completely unaware that his
        mouth was wide open.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Just as everyone was dumbfounded, a spatial ripple suddenly appeared in
        the sky, and galactic fleets appeared out of thin air, attracting
        everyone's attention. Zhu Xiaohua also looked over, but his eyes
        suddenly widened. He stared blankly at the identical emblems on the
        exterior armor of these battleships… This emblem was too familiar, he
        recognized it at a glance.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Before the crowd could react, an even more familiar figure suddenly
        appeared in the air. It was as if he had woken up from a deep sleep, as
        he opened his eyes blearily. The expression of this figure slowly turned
        from a blank look to pleasant surprise before finally turning into
        nostalgia.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">"My hometown, I'm back…"</p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Although he was far away, for some reason, his voice seemed to ignore
        the distance and sounded in everyone's hearts. At this moment, Zhu
        Xiaohua, like all the employees around him, felt like he had fallen into
        an icehouse. Their faces were filled with confusion, and their minds
        blank. At this moment, the figure in the sky seemed to have sensed the
        presence of someone familiar. He looked down and looked at Zhu Xiaohua
        from afar.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Zhu Xiaohua seemed to have woken up from a dream. He took a few steps
        back in disbelief, tripped over a table, and fell to the ground. His
        eyes almost popped out of their sockets, and his face was filled with
        disbelief. His mouth trembled, and his voice involuntarily rose. "Black
        Black Black Black… Black Star?!"
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        On this day, the world experienced a huge change. Countless phantoms
        that should have disappeared long ago reappeared. Some called it an
        ‘Invasion of the Realms', while others called it a ‘Turning Point of
        Fate'.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre3">
        Some felt that this was a case of a dove occupying a magpie's nest,
        while others felt that this was a case of a tree spreading its branches.
        Some believed that this was the beginning of the end, while others
        believed that this was the continuation of life. But no matter what they
        thought, everything that happened on this day was remembered by
        countless people, and a new era was born.

        Translators' Thoughts: Hi guys, Chuchutrain here. I took over as the
        translator midway in the novel, ~Ch 400. It feels pretty surreal that
        this book is now completed, considering that the author was still
        writing it even when I took over. I hope you enjoyed this journey with
        our thick-skinned (figuratively and literally) MC, the Great Mechanic
        Han, and hope that my translations were bearable for you guys (if they
        aren't, just pretend that they are :P)
