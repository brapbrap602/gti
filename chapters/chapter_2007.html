<h1>Chapter 1998: The Dharma Form is Complete</h1><p>This sensation was extremely subtle, fleeting and elusive, yet undeniably real. Qin Sang was certain it wasn't a hallucination.</p><p>In the deep night sky, stars occupied only a tiny fraction of the expanse; most of it was a pitch-black canvas.</p><p>Besides the glittering stars, there were dark stars that didn't emit light. These hidden stars were unseen, unknown.</p><p>But what were these dark stars?</p><p>Why could he perceive them? Why could the Qingluan Dharma Form connect with one of these dark stars?</p><p>Countless questions arose in Qin Sang's mind, but no one here could answer them, and the *Heavenly Demon Transformation Scripture* offered no explanation.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang's expression turned puzzled.  His confusion stemmed from more than just these unsolved mysteries.</p><p>When he sensed that connection, focused his attention, and tried to find the source, the connection became even more ethereal, almost nonexistent, yet almost present.</p><p>Like willow fluff in the wind, it was impossible to grasp.  Those lacking in willpower might have suspected a mind demon, leading them astray.</p><p>Stranger still, the direction of the connection became increasingly unclear.</p><p>Qin Sang increasingly doubted whether he was resonating with an invisible dark star or a whole constellation.</p><p>Or perhaps it was a bright star in this void that he could actually see, but his insufficient cultivation led to a deviation and misjudgment.</p><p>The vast expanse of the starry sky: a small area could contain hundreds or thousands of bright stars, plus the potentially countless dark stars, even more.</p><p>Qin Sang scanned the stars in that region, one by one, growing more and more confused.  Each seemed like the target, and yet none seemed quite right.</p><p>The harder he tried to sense it, the blurrier the target became.</p><p>‘Li!’</p><p>Qin Sang was startled awake by a shrill cry from his Qingluan Dharma Form.</p><p>High above, the Qingluan Dharma Form bore the brunt of the Milky Way's violent impact.</p><p>Starlight surged like a tide, a torrential flow washing over both the Dharma Form and its master.</p><p>The Qingluan Dharma Form's feathers were dishevelled, breaking like real feathers; its body became translucent, like a candle about to be extinguished by starlight.</p><p>Simultaneously, intense pain surged through Qin Sang's body, wave after wave. The sharper the Dharma Form’s cry, the more intense his agony, finally pulling him from his confusion.</p><p>This was a crucial moment of breakthrough, and he was in a deadly formation.  How could he afford to be confused and hesitant? He had to trust his judgment and proceed resolutely!</p><p>The confusion vanished from Qin Sang's heart. Discarding all distractions, he closed his eyes tightly, spread his arms, and completely focused on absorbing the stellar energy.</p><p>“Li!”</p><p>The Qingluan Dharma Form emitted a series of long cries, devoid of pain, filled only with determination.</p><p>It raised its proud head, spread its wings wide, embracing the starlight, surging upstream in the Milky Way, like a moth to a flame.</p><p>The Milky Way stripped the luster from its feathers.</p><p>Its last feather broke.</p><p>Then, its skin and flesh were washed away, its body about to be annihilated in the Milky Way.</p><p>The scattered feathers, like the ashes of the Qingluan, were tragically beautiful.</p><p>Qin Sang himself wasn't in much better shape.  His body was covered in streaks of light, like cracks in his flesh.</p><p>His body was being torn apart by the Milky Way; starlight penetrated the fissures, and it seemed on the verge of disintegration.</p><p>These torn areas were weak points in his body, not yet fully refined.  The stellar energy would refine these weaknesses, but this carried its own dangers.</p><p>The slightest misstep would lead to destruction.</p><p>Even so, Qin Sang showed no sign of stopping the Celestial River Killing Array; he was doing the opposite, increasing its power, as if determined to destroy himself before giving up.</p><p>‘Rumble… rumble…’</p><p>Gu Yunshou was rushing towards the scene.  Seeing the celestial phenomenon in the west, he froze.</p><p>A Milky Way stretched across the heavens, connecting the sky and earth, magnificent and awe-inspiring.</p><p>"Does verifying the power of a spirit formation require such a spectacle?  Could there be a powerful enemy attacking?"</p><p>Gu Yunshou muttered, increasing his speed.</p><p>At that moment, the Qingyang Temple was shrouded in starlight; Qin Sang and his Qingluan Dharma Form had disappeared into the Milky Way, seemingly shattered and reduced to dust, washed clean away.</p><p>Xiao Wu's expression was grave; the Heavenly Eye Butterfly stopped its flight, nervously watching the heavens.</p><p>In the Milky Way…</p><p>Qin Sang was immersed in a mysterious state.</p><p>He no longer tried to find the target, but clung tightly to that faint connection.</p><p>This faint connection proves his existence, proves the existence of the Azure Luan Dharma Image!</p><p>Qin Sang forgot everything. He didn't know how severe his injuries were, nor did he care if the Azure Luan Dharma Image had been annihilated.</p><p>As long as this connection remained, the Azure Luan Dharma Image existed!</p><p>This was Qin Sang's realization at the critical moment. Whether it was the right path remained to be verified.</p><p>However, Qin Sang was full of confidence!</p><p>"Li!"</p><p>From the depths of the galaxy, a long-lost phoenix cry suddenly echoed.</p><p>This cry was extremely faint, like the first cry of a newborn phoenix, comparable to the sounds of heaven.</p><p>Xiao Wu's tense expression relaxed. He couldn't help but raise his small hand and patted the Sky Eye Butterfly.  He glanced eastward, leaving the butterfly behind, and flew off alone.</p><p>Ripples danced across the starry river, giving rise to a faint azure light.</p><p>The azure light appeared and, unrestrained, quickly grew, revealing the outline of an Azure Luan.</p><p>Qin Sang's figure appeared alongside the Azure Luan. His breath fluctuated violently, as if he was breaking through some critical point.</p><p>Suddenly, a moment of silence.</p><p>Accompanied by a phoenix cry, Qin Sang finally broke through the barrier, underwent a transformation, and successfully entered the sixth level of Heavenly Demon Refining Form!</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>Starlight surged, and a true Azure Luan burst from the Milky Way, soaring through the void.</p><p>It spread its wings freely, its azure feathers scattering a clear brilliance. In its gaze, it was extraordinarily majestic.</p><p>Qin Sang stabilized his surging blood, opened his eyes, and looked at the Azure Luan, feeling both satisfaction and a touch of emotion.</p><p>This time, he could truly say he had broken through the illusory realm with his own abilities; before, he had been forcibly elevated.</p><p>With the breakthrough in cultivation and the completion of the Dharma Image, the Azure Luan Dharma Image now had no trace of illusion, appearing as a real Azure Luan.</p><p>Undeniably, his creation of the "Obscured Bone Scripture" and decades of cultivation had been the right path.</p><p>Years of accumulation had laid a solid foundation, greatly increasing his ability to withstand the pain of star yuan infusion and allowing him to single-mindedly sense that connection, thereby achieving a breakthrough.</p><p>Without the "Obscured Bone Scripture," he might not have failed, but it would certainly have been far more difficult.</p><p>With the successful breakthrough, the Celestial River Reverse Killing Array ceased operation, and the celestial phenomenon gradually disappeared.</p><p>On a mountain outside the Quiet Observation Pavilion, Gu Yun Sou was stopped by Xiao Wu.</p><p>Seeing the starlight above the Quiet Observation Pavilion gradually dissipate, the river of the Milky Way flowing backward, and the stars returning to normal,</p><p>Gu Yun Sou was somewhat puzzled, "Friend Xiao Wu, what was Daoist Qingfeng doing?"</p><p>He was certain that Qing Yang Temple wasn't testing arrays, but with Xiao Wu watching, he couldn't go over to investigate openly. Judging only by the aura, he couldn't be sure.</p><p>"This Daoist was studying the Celestial River Reverse Killing Array and finally gained some understanding. I was eager to verify it, causing you some worry."</p><p>Qin Sang's slightly weary voice came.</p><p>Hearing this, even though Gu Yun Sou was still suspicious, he didn't dare to press further, saying, "It's good that Daoist is unharmed."</p><p>"This Daoist is eager to retreat and is not in a position to invite you to the mountain as a guest. Please forgive me. My understanding can also be applied to the array. In the next two years, I plan to slightly modify this array, so everyone can rest assured. Please inform the two Sect Masters that in two years, we will go to Azure Sky Hollow to set up the array," Qin Sang continued.</p><p>Gu Yun Sou nodded. "Gu He Garden and Shang Ling Courtyard should be almost ready. Two years later, the timing will be just right. I also need to return to the mountain to prepare, so I won't disturb the Daoist."</p><p>With that, Gu Yun Sou bowed and vanished in a flash of light.</p><p>In the setting sun-drenched mountains, countless cultivators were still gazing at the horizon. Seeing that there were no more celestial phenomena, they returned to their caves to cultivate with unease.</p><p>"Does this happen every hundred or eighty years? This life is unbearable!" someone grumbled, considering whether to move away from this trouble spot.</p><p>…</p><p>Qing Yang Temple, Quiet Observation Pavilion.</p><p>After dismissing his disciples, Qin Sang sat cross-legged on the mountain peak, with the Azure Luan Dharma Image circling above his head.</p><p>Qin Sang was experiencing the changes brought about by the breakthrough.</p><p>His physical body had undoubtedly undergone a transformation, but the greatest change was the Azure Luan Dharma Image.</p><p>Before, it was just a phantom; now it was a true Dharma Image, possessing the powerful strength of the illusory realm.</p><p>In future duels, with both Dharma Body and Dharma Image, it would be like a two-on-one fight. Fellow cultivators of the same level would probably find it difficult to contend with.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't rush to test the power of the Dharma Image. He was most interested in what exactly resonated with the Azure Luan Dharma Image.</p><p>After the breakthrough, the connection became clearer, but Qin Sang tried for a long time and still couldn't pinpoint the target.</p><p>"Could it be…"</p><p>Qin Sang's heart stirred. Remembering the process of the breakthrough, could there be something like a natal star in the world?</p><p>After pondering for a moment, Qin Sang rubbed his Qianjun Ring and took out the bone flute.</p><p>After refining the Azure Vermillion Dharma-image with the bone flute, the sixth layer's mist gradually dissipated after the first five levels of cultivation, and profound scriptures flowed into Qin Sang's heart!</p><p>Qin Sang calmed his mind, and after reviewing them, his face showed surprise, "So it is!"</p><p>The cultivation technique didn't mention natal stars, but it detailed the essentials of cultivation after Void Refinement, requiring one to grasp a wisp of ethereal connection, continuously refining it until the target is locked, and the Dharma-image and the target's Qi are intertwined.</p><p>"What exactly is the target? A bright star? A dark star? Or some unknown, mysterious existence?"</p><p>Qin Sang didn't find the answer in the cultivation technique.</p><p>He guessed it was most likely one of the former two. The first few layers of the *Heavenly Demon Transformation* could be summarized as stellar essence body refinement, so this step must also be related to the Stellar Dao.</p><p>From passively receiving starlight to actively seeking a star, finding an anchor in the vast cosmos, he would no longer be lost, and rely on the connection between the two to absorb even more powerful and refined stellar essence.</p><p>Having determined his future path, Qin Sang stopped thinking about it. It would surely become clearer with further cultivation.</p><p>Gently stroking the bone flute, Qin Sang saw that mist still existed beyond the sixth layer.</p><p>This shows that the *Heavenly Demon Transformation* is at least a Mahayana-level cultivation technique.</p><p>Putting away the bone flute, Qin Sang immersed his mind into his Dharma-image, experiencing its abilities and power.</p><p>The moment he had the thought, Qin Sang immediately felt a difference.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>Phoenix wings suddenly unfolded behind his body, feathers fluttering, green arcs leaping between the feathers.</p><p>Not only the surface lightning, but the Azure Vermillion True Thunder hidden deep within the wings was also stirring!</p><p>"As expected, the perfected Dharma-image helps control the Azure Vermillion True Thunder!"</p><p>Qin Sang was overjoyed.  Lightning flickered at the base of his wings, then shot out a thin strand of green lightning, landing in Qin Sang's palm.</p><p>The green lightning was like a small insect, writhing in Qin Sang's hand, yet containing terrifying energy.</p><p>Qin Sang closed and opened his hand, the green lightning dancing between his fingers. Before, even though he could summon the Azure Vermillion True Thunder, he dared not play with it like this.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang used the Palm-held Thunder Observation technique, and it proved remarkably effective.</p><p>Qin Sang also discovered that the Azure Vermillion True Thunder's rank was indeed extremely high. He could manipulate it, but due to the Dharma-image being newly formed, there was still a sense of sluggishness.  The amount he could control and the power he could unleash still had vast room for improvement.</p><p>However, with the Azure Vermillion Dharma-image and the Palm-held Thunder Observation technique, he should barely be able to use thunder talismans.</p><p>Thinking about it, he did it.</p><p>Qin Sang carefully summoned the Azure Vermillion True Thunder, silently activating the Five Thunder Heart Seal talisman.</p><p>Thunder rumbled in the night sky, lightning flashing.</p><p>As lightning darted, thin streaks of green lightning, though small, were extremely noticeable.</p><p>Qin Sang kept trying, the thunder roaring in the sky for a long time, finally converging towards the center, barely forming a Five Thunder Heart Seal.</p><p>Sensing the power within the seal, Qin Sang's face showed surprise, secretly amazed.</p><p>After achieving the Azure Vermillion Dharma-image, Qin Sang could estimate the power of the Sun Wheel Seal without experimentation. The Five Thunder Heart Seal formed using the Azure Vermillion True Thunder, once he mastered it, would likely be no less powerful than the Sun Wheel Seal!</p><p>The power of dual cultivation of body and spirit manifested itself.</p><p>Before the Four Symbols Sword Formation was completed, and before he fully understood the Thunder Oath and could cast it independently... the Sun Wheel Seal and the Five Thunder Heart Seal would be his two trump cards.  The improvement from this breakthrough exceeded his expectations.</p><p>Just as Qin Sang was secretly pleased, he suddenly discovered something else, his brows furrowed slightly.</p><p>After a moment, Qin Sang's eyes flashed.  His Thunder Escape technique had undergone another transformation, but apart from that, he hadn't comprehended any other abilities.</p><p>Qin Sang thought he would at least be able to comprehend an ability of the Azure Vermillion divine beast.</p><p>After careful consideration and combining it with the cultivation technique, Qin Sang gained some understanding.</p><p>After entering the sixth layer of the *Heavenly Demon Transformation*, normal cultivation should involve actively merging one's blood essence and Qi with the Dharma-image, something he had instinctively avoided.</p><p>Qin Sang guessed that if he did so, he might be able to comprehend new abilities.</p><p>But what would he become?</p><p>Would he abandon his human form and become an Azure Vermillion?</p><p>As long as he could become stronger, if he had no choice, he wouldn't mind whether he was human or not.</p><p>But he had the *Ziwei Sword Scripture*, pointing towards the Mahayana killing path. He also had two chess pieces that even Void Refinement cultivators couldn't see through, possibly containing the Yin-Yang Dao.  He was also incubating a Qilin primordial seed, and might be able to take the spirit cultivation path in the future...</p><p>He had too many choices, it wasn't time to take a desperate gamble.</p><p>"If I don't do this, will it leave hidden dangers, forever preventing me from breaking through to the seventh layer, or perhaps even encountering a bottleneck and stagnating?"</p><p>Qin Sang murmured to himself, knowing this was very likely.</p><p>At this moment, the divergence of the Dao was reflected in him!</p>
