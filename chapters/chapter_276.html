<h1>    on recovering first. This old Daoist can still hold on for a while.”</p><p>Yun Youzi urged Qin Sang to recover</h1><p>    quickly as he steered the Spirit Bamboo Flying Boat.</p><p>Qin Sang took out two bottles of Green Spirit Pills and</p><p>    handed them to Yun Youzi in case of emergencies. He discreetly gripped the Ten Yama Banners in his palm and sat</p><p>    cross-legged on the flying boat, beginning to meditate.</p><p>The fire spirits pursued them relentlessly, but the</p><p>    Spirit Bamboo Flying Boat was even faster than the last time Qin Sang had seen it. The situation was tenuously</p><p>    stable.</p><p>Qin Sang secretly relied on the Nine Dragons Chariot Talisman. Once the Jiao Dragon spirit within it</p><p>    recovered, he estimated its speed would at most be comparable to the flying boat.</p><p>However, the flying boat</p><p>    seemed to consume little spiritual energy, while the talisman's consumption was astonishing. From this perspective,</p><p>    the Nine Dragons Chariot Talisman, with only one Jiao Dragon spirit, was inferior to the flying boat.</p><p>It was</p><p>    evident how extraordinary the Spirit Bamboo Flying Boat was. With this treasure, even if Yun Youzi couldn't defeat a</p><p>    Foundation Establishment cultivator, escaping wouldn't be a problem.</p><p>While recovering, Qin Sang started a</p><p>    conversation with Yun Youzi.</p><p>“My experience is similar to yours, Senior. I don't know what happened in the</p><p>    legacy ruins. The caverns suddenly collapsed, and those fire spirits appeared out of nowhere…”</p><p>Qin Sang echoed</p><p>    Yun Youzi's account.</p><p>Yun Youzi sighed. “Before entering the ancient cultivator’s ruins, several seniors warned</p><p>    us. Now it seems something must have happened above. If we can't find a way out, we can only drift along. No one</p><p>    knows where the River of Magma ultimately leads. This old Daoist fears being stranded alone in some unknown</p><p>    dangerous place, unable to escape. Fortunately, I met Brother Qin. At least we can look out for each other in times</p><p>    of danger.”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded slightly. Yun Youzi was right. Two people were better than one, and Yun Youzi's</p><p>    flying boat was a significant advantage.</p><p>“Senior, have you encountered any locations where the circular</p><p>    restrictions have weakened? Perhaps they couldn't withstand the tremors and have cracked.”</p><p>Yun Youzi shook his</p><p>    head. “No, I’ve only explored underground twice. Once was an underground palace filled with firebirds several times</p><p>    stronger than those in the Trial Space. I didn't dare go down there. The second time was this one. Have you</p><p>    encountered any, Brother Qin?”</p><p>After a moment of hesitation, Qin Sang nodded. “To be honest, Senior, when I</p><p>    was in the Trial Space, I happened to be assigned to the lowest chain. At first, I didn't understand the rules of</p><p>    the trial and went down to take a look. I found that the restrictive formations in the Trial Space were dim, and</p><p>    there were even cracks on them. Although they were still strong then, after the tremors, they might be breakable.</p><p>    However… I'm not sure where the Trial Space is located.”</p><p>Escaping was the priority. Qin Sang found a reason to</p><p>    share his discovery with Yun Youzi to discuss it together.</p><p>Hearing this, Yun Youzi's eyes lit up. He pondered,</p><p>    “The Trial Space and the ancient cultivator's ruins seem to be two separate spaces, but they are essentially one,</p><p>    separated by restrictions and connected by the stone stele. It might be near the stele.”</p><p>Qin Sang hummed in</p><p>    agreement. "That's what I thought as well.”</p><p>“It’s worth a try!”</p><p>Yun Youzi’s spiritual energy flashed,</p><p>    and the Spirit Bamboo Flying Boat immediately changed direction, rushing into a tributary.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced</p><p>    down at the four spirit bamboos on the flying boat and casually asked, “Senior, this bamboo boat is astonishingly</p><p>    fast. What kind of spirit bamboo is it made of? It’s quite extraordinary.”</p><p>He only asked casually, not really</p><p>    expecting Yun Youzi to explain everything.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Yun Youzi didn’t hesitate and said with some pride,</p><p>    “This flying boat is this old Daoist's proudest creation. It's made from four stalks of Flying Spirit Bamboo, which</p><p>    I obtained by chance. Although this bamboo is not one of the Ten Great Sacred Trees, it’s a rare spirit bamboo,</p><p>    known for being extremely light. After refining it into a flying boat, this characteristic gives it such speed. I’ve</p><p>    faced many life-threatening situations during my travels, and it was this boat that saved me. Oh… I remember Brother</p><p>    Qin’s natal spirit sword is a pure wood embryo. Do you need spirit wood to enhance it?”</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang nod,</p><p>    Yun Youzi hesitated for a moment, then said, “Brother Qin, if you need it, I can give you a section of Flying Spirit</p><p>    Bamboo after we escape this danger.”</p><p>Qin Sang was stunned and waved his hands repeatedly. “How can I accept</p><p>    this? This flying boat is so important to you, Senior. How can I damage it? I don't deserve such a generous</p><p>    gift!”</p><p>He never expected Yun Youzi to be so generous, offering such a precious gift after a casual</p><p>    conversation. He really didn’t dare to accept it, and even felt a bit wary.</p><p>Yun Youzi smiled and explained,</p><p>    “Don’t worry, Brother Qin. This bamboo has already been refined into a magical tool. As long as its essence isn’t</p><p>    damaged, this old Daoist only needs to nurture it for a few days to replenish the missing part. It won't affect the</p><p>    tool’s power. Of course, the separated Flying Spirit Bamboo won’t be as good as the original. It will be similar to</p><p>    ordinary spirit wood, but it will still retain some of the Flying Spirit Bamboo’s characteristics, which is quite</p><p>    rare.”</p><p>Qin Sang finally understood, but still shook his head and refused, "Thank you for your kindness,</p><p>    Senior. Unfortunately, my natal spirit sword is special. It requires the most primordial spirit wood. Refined spirit</p><p>    wood has altered spirituality, not only unable to improve it, but actually harmful to the spirit sword."</p><p>"I</p><p>    see…"</p><p>Yun Youzi nodded thoughtfully and consoled him, "Brother Qin, don't be discouraged. Flying Spirit Bamboo</p><p>    is not the only unique marvel in the world. You will eventually find spirit wood of the same level in the future.</p><p>    Perhaps you'll have the chance to obtain one of the Ten Sacred Trees and elevate your natal spirit sword to the</p><p>    level of a magical treasure in one fell swoop."</p><p>"Senior, please don't tease me. The Ten Sacred Trees only</p><p>    exist in legends. They are divine objects that even Nascent Soul ancestors covet. I've only seen them in ancient</p><p>    texts. I don't even know if any exist in the entire Small Cold Region."</p><p>Qin Sang gave a wry smile. Of course,</p><p>    he desired the Ten Sacred Trees. Not even a whole section, but even a small piece would suffice to eliminate his</p><p>    worries about the Ebony Sword's quality before reaching the Core Formation stage.</p><p>But such divine objects were</p><p>    a matter of chance, not something one could actively seek. With the decline of the cultivation world today, the very</p><p>    existence of the Ten Sacred Trees was questionable.</p><p>Unexpectedly, upon hearing this, Yun Youzi gave a</p><p>    mysterious smile, "Brother Qin, you underestimate the Small Cold Region and the Ancient Battlefield. From what I</p><p>    know, let's not even talk about distant occurrences, within the last ten thousand years, the Ten Sacred Trees have</p><p>    appeared at least three times!"</p><p>"Oh?"</p><p>Qin Sang straightened up and asked in surprise, "Do they really</p><p>    exist in the Ancient Battlefield? How do you know, Senior?"</p><p>"I also heard it from my master, Realist</p><p>    Piaoya…"</p><p>Yun Youzi explained briefly, then began to elaborate for Qin Sang, "The Ancient Battlefield was</p><p>    formed from the great battles of ancient mighty figures. Deep within the battlefield, spatial rifts are dense and</p><p>    dangers abound. Even Nascent Soul cultivators dare not trespass. There are some immortal abodes that have never been</p><p>    explored. Whenever one appears, it is accompanied by countless rare treasures. My master said that within the last</p><p>    ten thousand years, the Ten Sacred Trees have indeed appeared three times. However, only a few were qualified to</p><p>    compete for them, so the news didn't spread widely and remained largely unknown." </p></p>
