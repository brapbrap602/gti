<h1>Chapter 903: The Stone Platform and the Scars</h1><p>The hall's walls were mottled, covered in powerfully inscribed runes, etched deep as if with iron and silver, bearing the marks of time.</p><p>The stone platform appeared even older than the hall.</p><p>At first glance, it was an unremarkable crescent-shaped stone platform, yet it exuded an inexplicable ancient aura, touching the heart, clearly not a product of this era.</p><p>The platform's surface was ravaged, crisscrossed with scars, perhaps damaged in ancient conflicts or perhaps always this way. The chaotic patterns were indecipherable.</p><p>Within the hall, there was nothing but the spirit array, the stone platform, and the lightning plasma.</p><p>Such an ordinary stone platform, yet it floated in mid-air.</p><p>Closer inspection revealed that this was not the platform's own power, but the focused energy of the spirit array. The 'platform' occupied the array's core.</p><p>The docile nature of the lightning plasma was likely due to the array, the platform's role unclear.</p><p>The array and the platform were not created by the same hand, perhaps not even from the same era.  Whoever placed the platform within the array clearly had a purpose.</p><p>The black-robed figure stared intently at the platform. This was the object the Black Serpent Mountain Ancestor demanded.</p><p>He cautiously stepped into the hall, and seeing no reaction, flashed to the edge of the plasma pool.</p><p>Even though the pool remained calm, its proximity sent shivers down his spine and made his eyelids twitch.  He proceeded with extreme caution.</p><p>"Could this be the treasure?"</p><p>He examined the platform, puzzled. It didn't resemble a magical artifact, showing no sign of inherent power. Yet, the ancient aura it emanated was awe-inspiring. Having survived since antiquity, it couldn't be ordinary.</p><p>Despite the urgency outside, the black-robed figure seemed unhurried.</p><p>He didn't immediately try to take the platform.  Instead, he drew a flying sword, channeled his true essence, and gently struck the platform.</p><p>'Clang!'</p><p>A clear ringing sound.</p><p>The sword bounced off.</p><p>He switched to a spirit sword, a true magical artifact, yet the result was the same.  Several strikes left no mark.</p><p>The platform was incredibly hard.</p><p>The deep scars on its surface, if not original, must have been inflicted by something far more powerful than ordinary blades.</p><p>He sheathed his sword and placed his hand on the platform, channeling his true essence into it.</p><p>A faint light shimmered across the platform's surface.  The brightness of the hall made it barely visible, a fleeting, ethereal glow like faint starlight.</p><p>Finally, a change. But the black-robed figure, already anticipating this, remained unexcited. As he continued channeling his energy, only the starlight intensified, nothing more.</p><p>"Indeed, even the two human Nascent Soul cultivators couldn't discern its true nature, assuming it was merely an array core or a cultivation aid. I shouldn't expect to glean anything from human methods."</p><p>He withdrew his energy. After a moment of contemplation, he muttered strange syllables.</p><p>He extended his right hand, fingers spread.  A strange tattoo, a Witch Clan divine inscription, appeared on his arm. Silver light coalesced in his palm, and with a low shout, he struck the platform.</p><p>A bolt of lightning.</p><p>Upon impact, the lightning didn't vanish, transforming into an electrical net that enveloped the platform, attempting to penetrate or activate some hidden power within.</p><p>Yet, he failed.  The platform remained unchanged, only the faint starlight, now almost invisible due to the weak divine inscription, persisted.</p><p>Undeterred, he knew the Witch Clan divine inscriptions were vast and varied, encompassing all elements.</p><p>The Witch Clan legacy must have been a grand system, comparable to the humans', but its utter disappearance remained a mystery.</p><p>He tried different inscriptions, invoking various forces, even employing his Gu insects, but the platform remained unresponsive.</p><p>Finally, he exhausted all options.</p><p>"No wonder Master called it a treasure, not an artifact. Its secrets can only be unlocked by Master, or another Nascent Soul Witch," he murmured, his aura shifting as he dispelled the inscriptions. Recalling the dying words of the Bullfighting Peak deserter, he channeled his true essence, dividing it into several streams, and infused it into the spirit array.</p><p>Runes within the array flickered.  Seizing the opportunity, he grabbed the platform, lifting it with a powerful tug.</p><p>He grinned, storing the platform in his spatial pouch.  But his eyes caught a disturbance in the lightning plasma pool.</p><p>Ripples appeared on the previously calm surface, the plasma's aura growing increasingly violent, the surrounding ambient lightning energy stirred.</p><p>The platform was clearly crucial to the array.</p><p>Its removal destabilized the array.</p><p>Runes within the array flared brightly, but the plasma's agitation intensified, unrestrained.</p><p>If the pool was full, its eruption would obliterate the entire Bright Insight Island.  Even this thin layer was terrifying.  He dared not linger.</p><p>He pushed off the ground, fleeing the hall.</p><p>Outside the Lightning Caverns.</p><p>The commotion alerted the Core Formation cultivators from the various sects.  Rushing to the scene, they were startled to find a group of unfamiliar Witch Clan cultivators.</p><p>It was now clear that the three Bullfighting Peak disciples had tricked them, allowing infiltration right under their noses.</p><p>"Get back!"</p><p>The Witch Clan cultivators reformed their formation.  A wave of the Beast King Banner sent golden threads slashing through the air, targeting the two fastest human Golden Core cultivators.</p><p>Sensing the power of the golden threads, the two cultivators paled, hastily raising their defenses.  Yet, it was futile.  The golden threads devoured their attacks, their momentum unchecked. Alarmed, they abruptly halted and retreated, repelled in a single exchange, utterly humiliated.</p><p>Fortunately, reinforcements arrived.</p><p>"That's the infamous Beast King Banner Formation of the Witch Clan!"</p><p>Experienced cultivators recognized the banner, gasping in shock.  Crafting such a banner was incredibly difficult and complex, possessed only by the elite Witch Clan sects.</p><p>"These Witches are powerful! But the banner is incomplete.  Don't worry, they dared to infiltrate Bright Insight Island, none shall escape!"</p><p>The most powerful human cultivators issued orders.  They quickly adjusted their formations, counterattacking the Witches.</p><p>Outnumbered, the Witch Clan cultivators, despite the Beast King Banner, couldn't hold out indefinitely.</p><p>Just as their anxiety peaked, the black-robed figure emerged from the Lightning Caverns.  Taking in the scene, he waved his arm, "We have it! Retreat!"</p><p>He was the first to escape.</p><p>The Witch Clan cultivators cheered, using the Beast King Banner as cover, retreating towards their flag formation.</p>
