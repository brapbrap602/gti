<h1>Chapter 109: Sacrifice for the Yama Banner</h1><p>Chapter 109: Sacrifice for the Yama Banner</p><p>Sun De's face paled, and he hurriedly cast a shimmering light, revealing a fine, net-like magical artifact.  Just in the nick of time, the net expanded, blocking the incoming Shadow Bolt. But Qin Sang immediately threw out several pre-prepared talismans. Ice, fire, and earth spikes flew everywhere, creating chaos and leaving the net teetering on the verge of collapse.</p><p>The Ebony Wood Sword, following close behind, took advantage of the net's weakened glow and sliced it in two.</p><p>With his magical artifact easily destroyed, the caught-off-guard Sun De only had time to dodge sideways. The Ebony Wood Sword grazed his lower ribs, leaving a long, narrow wound.</p><p>Sun De cried out again in pain and panic. "Junior Brother Qin, stop! It's a misunderstanding!"</p><p>Qin Sang ignored him completely.</p><p>Sun De's words and actions were extremely suspicious. Despite his many questions, Qin Sang knew he couldn't give Sun De a chance to recover. If Sun De managed to deploy a powerful magical artifact, the situation could easily reverse. He had to press his advantage and disable him.</p><p>Under the relentless assault of the Ebony Wood Sword, coupled with Qin Sang's unexpected talismans and Shadow Bolts, Sun De didn't even have the opportunity to retrieve another artifact. He glared fiercely at Qin Sang, muttering incantations.  Moments later, he stared at Qin Sang with a look of utter astonishment, as if witnessing something unbelievable.</p><p>Unaware of Sun De's strange behavior, Qin Sang poured all his energy into his sword art. The Ebony Wood Sword transformed into streaks of light, enveloping Sun De and piercing his vital energy center.</p><p>Finally, Sun De was forced into a corner of the cave, with nowhere left to run.</p><p>Qin Sang severed Sun De's limbs and snatched his storage pouch, leaving him barely alive.</p><p>Sun De lay motionless on the ground, seemingly unconscious. Qin Sang cautiously swept his divine sense over him, confirming that Sun De posed no further threat, and then retrieved his Ebony Wood Sword.</p><p>Suddenly, a blue orb of light shot out from the top of Sun De's head, fast as a meteor, hurtling straight towards Qin Sang's face.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression remained unchanged. Just as the orb was about to reach his forehead, he secretly activated the Star Tear, and a protective shield shimmered into existence around him, deflecting the orb.</p><p>The orb trembled mid-air and attempted to flee the cave. Qin Sang wouldn't allow it.  He flashed forward, intercepting the orb. His hand glowed with spiritual energy as he grabbed it, tightening his grip. A pained cry echoed from within.</p><p>"Junior Brother Qin, spare me! I simply hadn't seen you emerge from seclusion for a long time and was worried. I came in to check on you.  I didn't mean to intrude! It's all a misunderstanding! For the sake of our shared sect, please let me go!"</p><p>Sun De's desperate pleas echoed in Qin Sang's mind. But he remained unmoved, his expression cold as he looked at Sun De's nascent soul, then down at the utterly destroyed Bewitching Mirror on the ground. "Senior Brother Sun," he said icily, "since it's a misunderstanding, perhaps you could explain how you destroyed the Bewitching Mirror? Why did you assume I was dead?"</p><p>He initially thought Sun De possessed some powerful magical artifact that had forcibly broken the Bewitching Mirror. Only after he appeared did he realize that wasn't the case.</p><p>A top-grade magical artifact, already formed into an array, could be destroyed so easily?</p><p>And Sun De's initial exclamation upon seeing him... Cultivators faced no danger when breaking through to the tenth level. Why did Sun De assume he was dead?</p><p>A strong premonition suddenly gripped Qin Sang.</p><p>"This..."</p><p>Sun De hesitated. Qin Sang snorted coldly and tightened his grip again.</p><p>The orb of light pulsed violently. Sun De screamed in agony, then cried out, "Junior Brother Qin, have mercy! Your mirrors were crafted with a special restriction, using Yin Sha energy. They're cursed tools. I've encountered them before and knew how to break the restriction, that's why... Junior Brother Qin, don't be angry! These cursed tools don't last. Even if I hadn't broken them, they would have self-destructed after a while..."</p><p>After hearing Sun De's words, Qin Sang continued to hold his nascent soul, a thoughtful expression on his face.</p><p>If the Bewitching Mirror truly was a cursed tool, as Sun De claimed, then the seventeen artifacts they received from Sect Leader Yi were likely no different. They were all crafted with Yin Sha energy. No wonder each artifact emanated an ineradicable aura of coldness.</p><p>The Flood Dragon Sword was like this, the Bewitching Mirror was like this, and the Cloudfall Wings, though their purpose was concealment, also showed subtle signs.</p><p>Qin Sang stared down at Sun De's nascent soul, a strange glint in his eyes. He suddenly asked, "None of the Refinement Masters in the market could figure it out. Senior Brother Sun is truly insightful. It seems you have a close relationship with the Ghost Yin Sect."</p><p>He had never heard of these so-called "baleful weapons." After asking so many Refinement Masters in the cultivation market, none of them could identify them, yet Sun De knew them so well.</p><p>The sphere of light remained silent.</p><p>Qin Sang was secretly surprised. He was only bluffing, but Sun De really did have a connection with the Ghost Yin Sect.</p><p>After a long silence, Sun De sighed. "Junior Brother Qin, I'll tell you everything you want to know, but you must swear to spare my life after I've spoken."</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes flickered. He said indifferently, "Senior Brother Sun, you don't seem to be in a position to bargain with me. If you don't say anything, I'll end you now! Besides, you don't think there's no way to make you talk in the cultivation world, do you? I'd like to see how strong your will is!"</p><p>Without waiting for Sun De to reply, Qin Sang's expression darkened. Spiritual power surged in his palm as he gripped Sun De's nascent soul and began to crush it. He had experienced the agony of having his nascent soul tortured and didn't believe Sun De could withstand it.</p><p>As expected, Sun De screamed repeatedly. The sphere of light grew dimmer and dimmer, finally transforming into a face that pleaded with Qin Sang, appearing utterly pathetic.</p><p>"Junior Brother Qin, stop! I'll talk, I'll talkâ€¦"</p><p>Having delivered a sufficient lesson, Qin Sang stopped, his eyes glinting coldly as he stared at Sun De.</p><p>Sun De cautiously glanced at Qin Sang. "Junior Brother Qin, you guessed right. My origins are indeed related to the Ghost Yin Sect. Let me ask you a question first: Did you cultivate using the Yama Banner?"</p><p>Qin Sang countered, "How did you know I have the Yama Banner?"</p><p>He had joined the Ghost Yin Sect at the You Mountain Market and already possessed the Yama Banner then. Even Yue Wu hadn't noticed.</p><p>"Junior Brother Qin wouldn't have forgotten the Heart-Devouring Worms in your nascent soul, would you?"</p><p>Sun De gave a dry laugh. Seeing Qin Sang's displeasure, he didn't dare to keep him in suspense. "Patriarch Ghost Yin discovered some Heart-Devouring Worm corpses within a thousand-year-old ice block and created a venomous Gu technique to control the corpses and manipulate others. This isn't a secret within the Ghost Yin Sect.</p><p>As far as I know, there are very few Heart-Devouring Worm corpses left. They were all collected by Elder Yi, our Sect Master. Recently, in order to send disciples to infiltrate the Yuan Zhao Sect, he was willing to use them.</p><p>That day at Mount Shaohua, I sensed the Heart-Devouring Worm within Junior Brother Qin and guessed that you might have escaped from the Yuan Zhao Sect.  Elder Yi's trusted confidants sent to the Yuan Zhao Sect naturally wouldn't betray him. Only those disciples selected from the Yin Sha Abyss are untrustworthy, requiring control with Heart-Devouring Worms. They must have the Yama Banner.</p><p>I tested you a bit and, seeing that you chose to be a servant in the Earth Sink Cave, I thought it was foolproof. I never expected that you would resist the temptation of the Yama Banner and not cultivate using the Soul Pill. Junior Brother Qin, with your willpower, I deserve this defeat."</p><p>Hearing this, Qin Sang's doubts deepened. "What would happen if I cultivated using the Yama Banner?"</p><p>"You would become a sacrifice," Sun De said.</p>
