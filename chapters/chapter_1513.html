<h1>Chapter 1504: Puppet Crystal </h1><p>After the doppelganger succeeded, it immediately retreated into the Corpse Puppet Pouch.</p><p>Concealed by the Demonic Flame and the sword array, it was difficult for outsiders to detect its existence.</p><p>Qin Sang's figure flashed into existence, grabbing Hall Master Yin's Nascent Soul. His fingers moved rapidly, placing layers of restrictions on it, sealing it completely.</p><p>Hall Master Yin's expression changed from ferocious to agonizing, then to despair, and finally to complete stillness.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>The Demonic Flame incinerated Hall Master Yin's corpse.</p><p>Several streams of light and a mustard seed pouch flew out from the remains, landing in Qin Sang's palm.</p><p>These were the various treasures that Hall Master Yin had used before, all of which now changed ownership.</p><p>Qin Sang activated his spiritual sense, violently breaking the restrictions on the mustard seed pouch. He quickly scanned through it, finding a bottle of Fleecy Snow Elixir. His heart stirred, and he took it out. He didn't have time to examine the other items in detail, and threw everything into the Thousand Jun Ring.</p><p>Next, Qin Sang took Hall Master Yin's Nascent Soul into the Corpse Puppet Pouch, intending to interrogate it thoroughly later.</p><p>The battle was over.</p><p>Qin Sang retracted the Demonic Flame and scanned the surroundings.</p><p>He sensed several gazes, both overt and covert.</p><p>These people had been alerted by the Heavenly Tribulation and were watching from nearby. They had witnessed a Hall Master of Xuantian Palace perish, leaving no trace of his body, and moreover, he had been slain single-handedly. They were all greatly shocked.</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze swept over their hiding places.</p><p>These people felt as if they were being targeted by sharp swords from afar, their minds inexplicably experiencing a sharp pain. Greatly alarmed, they hastily scattered and fled.</p><p>However, neither Old Demon Hun nor Great Sage Tianpeng were among them.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at the depths of the sacred land, then turned back to the floating mountain.</p><p>At the edge of the black mist.</p><p>The battle was nearing its end.</p><p>Qin Sang descended, landing lightly on the ground. He immediately saw several corpses sprawled on the ground, those of Shang Lu, the cultivator surnamed Yue, and others.</p><p>Some others were still alive, surrounded by Hall Master Jiang and the others, the situation having been completely reversed.</p><p>These people had been incited by the Palace Master, Shang Lu, and the others, and were not the main instigators. Although there were cultivators from both the Heavenly Mountain and Xuantian lineages, they were not as close to Shang Lu and the others as the cultivator surnamed Yue.</p><p>Tong Lingyu was not present.</p><p>Hall Master Jiang, Liuli, and the others surrounded them without attacking.</p><p>These people had witnessed the tragic deaths of Shang Lu and the others, and had thought they were doomed. However, seeing that Tong Lingyu did not seem intent on a complete purge, they were unwilling to truly fight to the death when they weren't at the point of no return.</p><p>At this moment, they were filled with tension, occasionally looking towards the depths of the black mist, anxiously awaiting Tong Lingyu to emerge and pronounce their fate.</p><p>However, they also understood.</p><p>Even if they were lucky enough to survive this time, their future days would not be easy.</p><p>Noticing Qin Sang, Hall Master Jiang frowned slightly.</p><p>Just now, Qin Sang had insisted on pursuing Hall Master Yin alone. How had he returned so quickly? Had he failed and let Hall Master Yin escape?</p><p>If Hall Master Yin had returned to Xuantian Palace first and spread false rumors, things would become troublesome.</p><p>Hall Master Jiang was about to go out and assist Qin Sang.</p><p>"Hall Master Yin, he..."</p><p>"Dead."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, succinct and to the point.</p><p>"Hiss..."</p><p>Hearing this, all the Nascent Soul cultivators present, including Hall Master Jiang, were visibly shocked. Their gazes towards Qin Sang immediately changed, filled with deep awe and astonishment.</p><p>No wonder the Grand Elder was not worried at all!</p><p>They knew very well how strong the Hall Masters of the sect were, and Hall Master Yin was one of the best. Yet he had been slain so quickly by this person.</p><p>Only Liuli's expression remained unchanged. She had witnessed Qin Sang's true strength in the underground cave.</p><p>At this moment, the black mist churned, and Tong Lingyu emerged, leading the sealed Luo Yun.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang, Tong Lingyu showed no surprise. She nodded to him, then gently placed Luo Yun down. To everyone's astonishment, she sighed softly, "You all should remember Senior Brother Luo, right?"</p><p>...</p><p>Luo Yun was irrefutable evidence.</p><p>Seeing Luo Yun, who was supposed to be long dead, appearing before them alive and bearing such terrifying restrictions, these people had no choice but to believe in Yin Changsheng's misdeeds. They all gave up resistance.</p><p>The situation was stabilized effortlessly. All that remained was to eliminate the remaining influence of Yin Changsheng and the others after returning. The chaos created by Yin Changsheng was essentially over.</p><p>Of course, the aftershocks would be felt for a long time, and might even change the structure of Xuantian Palace.</p><p>At least the outcome was not bad.</p><p>Luo Yun and Tong Lingyu were both still alive.</p><p>If Luo Yun's injuries could be healed, and Tong Lingyu successfully broke through, Xuantian Palace would still be a formidable force with two Grand Cultivators at its helm.</p><p>The greatest loss was perhaps the Four-Coiled Serpent Seal, but the *Sacrificial Origin Technique* could serve as compensation.</p><p>Qin Sang was not concerned with the internal affairs of Xuantian Palace. He had already learned from Hall Master Jiang that a strange phenomenon had appeared in the depths of the sacred land.</p><p>A flash of white light had appeared and vanished.</p><p>It hadn't lasted long, but it could be seen even through the turbulent darkness, indicating that it must have been quite significant. He wondered what those demons and monsters were doing in there.</p><p>The fragment of the Killing Sword was in the depths of the sacred land.</p><p>Unfortunately, the sword spirit had remained silent since then, making it impossible to determine its exact location.</p><p>Regardless, Qin Sang had to go there himself.</p><p>Looking at Tong Lingyu, Qin Sang asked with doubt, "Old Demon Hun and Tianpeng led the demons and monsters to invade the sacred land. Fellow Daoist Tong doesn't seem worried?"</p><p>Luo Yun's fate was unknown.</p><p>Tong Lingyu was severely injured, suppressing her injuries with pills, and had lost her Numinous Treasure, greatly diminishing her strength.</p><p>This was the weakest moment for Xuantian Palace.</p><p>Tong Lingyu was methodically arranging for others to handle the aftermath. The first thing she did was to send people to retrieve the treasures from the sacred land, lest they fall into the hands of outsiders.</p><p>The Palace Master's sudden attack had left no time for these things to be done.</p><p>Tong Lingyu smiled and explained, "Similar situations have happened before, but Xuantian Palace has always emerged victorious. As long as the Kandu Pearl and other treasures continue to flow, the foundation of Xuantian Palace remains as solid as a rock. It will only take a century or two to recover our vitality. What is there to fear?"</p><p>She opened her palm, revealing the Ice Demon Crystal. "Moreover, the sacred artifact is not lost. Others cannot enter the sacred land. We decide when to open it in the future."</p><p>"Aren't you afraid of what Old Demon Hun and Tianpeng might do in the depths of the sacred land?"</p><p>Qin Sang countered.</p><p>Tong Lingyu turned and gazed at the darkness in the depths of the sacred land. "Fellow Daoist Qin, you may not know this, but countless generations of Xuantian Palace ancestors have explored that place countless times. The spatial turbulence there is extremely dangerous. Even Hall Masters and Elders have perished inside, leaving no trace of their bodies. But in all these years, nothing has been found! Therefore, we believe that the depths of the sacred land are most likely a void, completely destroyed. Are the insights of past Palace Masters and Grand Elders inferior to those of Old Demon Hun and Tianpeng?"</p><p>Qin Sang frowned slightly.</p><p>The sword spirit's sensing proved that the depths of the sacred land were not a void.</p><p>The judgment of Xuantian Palace's ancestors was wrong!</p><p>As she spoke, Tong Lingyu coughed a few times, a faint blush appearing on her cheeks. The medicinal power of the elixir was almost exhausted, and there were signs of her injuries flaring up again.</p><p>She quickened her pace.</p><p>"The only thing that exists there is a stone tablet of unknown origin. This object stands amidst the turbulent void, supported by a lotus platform at its base. There are no words on the tablet, but it emits a strange fluctuation.</p><p>"Anyone who sees it at first glance will think it's an extraordinary treasure.</p><p>"Unfortunately, we've tried countless methods, even hacking with swords and axes, striking with lightning, and burning with fire, but we haven't been able to damage it in the slightest, nor can we move it. There's no feedback whatsoever.</p><p>"Yin Changsheng's plan for hundreds of years was to fabricate a story using this stone tablet, taking it step by step to lure Old Demon Hun. It is said that the original plan was to set a trap around the stone tablet. Your and Liuli's sudden appearance put this plan on hold."</p><p>Who knew that fate was unpredictable? Who could calculate everything without error? How could things develop exactly according to one person's plan?</p><p>If Yin Changsheng had followed his original plan, he would have had a good chance of taking down Old Demon Hun and obtaining an extraordinary treasure.</p><p>Due to a twist of fate, he set his sights on Qin Sang, resulting in no one being able to control Old Demon Hun, releasing a tiger back into the mountains.</p><p>Although Yin Changsheng abandoned his plan midway, he had already leaked the approximate location of the sacred land.</p><p>The Ganoderma Lucidum Ruyi that Old Demon Hun obtained in the Golden Summit Hall had a great connection with the stone tablet. Following the guidance of the Ganoderma Lucidum Ruyi, he easily found the entrance to the sacred land.</p><p>The Ganoderma Lucidum Ruyi and the fluctuations emitted by the stone tablet were similar.</p><p>When Old Demon Hun obtained this item, he was somewhat skeptical that he could obtain a treasure seemingly related to the Xuantian Palace sacred land from a Buddhist relic site.</p><p>For this reason, he studied it for a long time, imitating the aura of the Ganoderma Lucidum Ruyi, reforging the Void-Locking Sword, and carefully disguising it. He put it up for auction at the Myriad Demon Convention, intending to observe Xuantian Palace's reaction.</p><p>If Xuantian Palace spared no expense to buy the Void-Locking Sword, it would indicate that the Ganoderma Lucidum Ruyi was indeed connected to the stone tablet.</p><p>It was also because of Qin Sang's interference that Xuantian Palace missed out on the Void-Locking Sword.</p><p>Old Demon Hun was suspicious and had no intention of dealing with Qin Sang. For more than ten years, he had been busy with this matter, finally making up his mind to join forces with the Demon Sages and go all-in.</p><p>Tong Lingyu pointed to the location where the white light had appeared, speaking rapidly, "That is where the stone tablet is located. Just in case, Hall Master Jiang, Elder Mei, and the others will quietly go over and take a look. There is a sacred healing herb in the sacred land. Taking it can stabilize injuries and restore eighty to ninety percent of one's strength. I will go and gather the herb now, and if there is any unexpected situation, I will rush over immediately. If Fellow Daoist is interested in that place, you can also go with Hall Master Jiang and the others..."</p><p>She didn't hide anything about these matters, and was even happy to see Qin Sang take the lead, as only Qin Sang could restrain Old Demon Hun and Great Sage Tianpeng.</p><p>With that, Tong Lingyu summoned Hall Master Jiang and Elder Mei.</p><p>The several of them discussed for a while.</p><p>Qin Sang flashed to Liuli's side and explained in a low voice, "...I'm worried that I might accidentally encounter the demons and monsters, and be besieged by Old Demon Hun and Tianpeng. Could Immortal Fairy lend me a hand? You don't need to show yourself, just hide in the dark and wait for the opportune moment to strike. If we succeed, there will be a great reward!"</p><p>With that, Qin Sang took out the Four-Coiled Serpent Seal and quietly handed it to Liuli.</p><p>Now, only Liuli and Tong Lingyu could control this treasure, and Qin Sang naturally trusted Liuli more.</p><p>Being able to unleash a single strike would be enough.</p><p>Faced with two attacks of the pseudo-Numinous Treasure level, even a Grand Cultivator would struggle.</p><p>Moreover, Liuli's Ice Soul Divine Light was also a top-tier divine ability, capable of restricting opponents at critical moments.</p><p>Liuli already knew the reason and did not refuse. She took the Four-Coiled Serpent Seal and said, "Helping you is also helping the sect. There's no need to thank me."</p><p>She wanted to make the benefits between the two of them clear, leaving no room for ambiguity.</p><p>Qin Sang looked at Liuli's serious eyes and vaguely guessed her intentions. He sighed inwardly and didn't argue with her.</p><p>The four of them secretly left the black mist and quietly flew towards the depths of the sacred land.</p><p>After a while, Qin Sang's expression changed slightly. He suddenly stopped and said, "You two Fellow Daoists go ahead. I have encountered an old acquaintance and will be right back."</p><p>Hall Master Jiang and Elder Mei exchanged glances and didn't ask any further questions.</p><p>Qin Sang and Liuli changed direction, flying a short distance before landing on a mountain.</p><p>This mountain was lush with vegetation, with exotic flowers blooming and immortal vines wrapped around trees. It was a rare and beautiful sight in the sacred land.</p><p>On a bluestone at the mountain's peak stood an old man.</p><p>He stood with his hands behind his back, his aura somewhat ethereal. He slightly raised his head, his turbid eyes gazing through the darkness, constantly focused on the direction of the sinkhole, seemingly unaware of the two people who had landed before him.</p><p>"Such heavenly might, is the one undergoing tribulation Yin Changsheng? Xuantian Palace is truly in a time of trouble!"</p><p>He sighed, then withdrew his gaze, looking at the beautiful pair before him, and let out a hoarse laugh, "What this old man has done has turned out rather well, creating a wonderful match."</p><p>This person was actually Dongyang Bo!</p><p>The death in front of Qiu Mubai was a sham!</p><p>Liuli's expression remained cold in the face of the person who had harmed her so much, seemingly unwilling to say a word to him.</p><p>Qin Sang narrowed his eyes and said coldly, "You dare to appear before me alone. Are you here to die?"</p><p>"That's right!"</p><p>Dongyang Bo's face suddenly darkened, and he said fiercely, "Qin Sang, kill me!"</p><p>Qin Sang frowned.</p><p>This person truly sought death.</p><p>Dongyang Bo was no longer a threat. His current actions only made Qin Sang feel strange and ridiculous.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang's inaction, Dongyang Bo revealed a mocking smile and sneered, "What? This old man has delivered himself to your door, and you're still afraid? If you don't kill me in this life, how can your thoughts be clear! How did you survive until today with such indecisiveness!"</p><p>"Hehe..."</p><p>Facing Dongyang Bo's provocation, Qin Sang felt no emotion in his heart. He laughed and glanced at the exit of the sacred land, "Putting on an act! You're worried that I'll take it out on Qiu Mubai later, aren't you?"</p><p>Dongyang Bo's expression stiffened.</p><p>Qin Sang's cultivation had advanced by leaps and bounds, far exceeding his expectations.</p><p>Liuli was also a prodigy, especially with the backing of the number one sect in the North Sea.</p><p>If they were determined to make things difficult for Qiu Mubai, even if Qiu Mubai could barely preserve his life, he would be unable to move an inch in the future.</p><p>Qin Sang snorted coldly, "You underestimate Qin too much!"</p><p>Dongyang Bo looked deeply at Qin Sang, then suddenly burst into laughter.</p><p>"Haha..."</p><p>Loud laughter.</p><p>Wild laughter.</p><p>His laughter grew louder and louder, no longer old, reverberating through the heavens and the earth, restoring some of the style of the founder of Shaohua Mountain, yet also containing a sense of desolation.</p><p>"That's right! I underestimated you, I've always underestimated you!"</p><p>Qin Sang looked on coldly.</p><p>"Cough, cough..."</p><p>Dongyang Bo coughed violently, stopping his wild laughter. He raised his hand and pressed it forcefully against his chest, taking a deep breath, "Just as well. Given your temperament, if I die at your hands, Mubai would be in even greater danger."</p><p>With that, Dongyang Bo reached into his bosom and took out a crystal.</p><p>The crystal was shaped like a small ball, easily held in the palm. It was entirely milky white, without any impurities, extremely pure.</p><p>"Take it!"</p><p>Dongyang Bo tossed the crystal to Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes flickered. His spiritual sense quickly scanned it once, and then he cautiously activated his true essence, transforming it into a large hand that caught the white ball from a distance, lest Dongyang Bo try any tricks.</p><p>He was always cautious. Even when victory was assured, he would not relax, especially since Dongyang Bo was insidious and cunning, and had to be guarded against.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang's actions, Dongyang Bo sneered, "I call this object the Puppet Crystal. I obtained it in the Ziwei Palace. I have studied ancient texts and pondered over it for many years, and I believe the Puppet Crystal is a special treasure used to refine puppets. I originally intended to refine this object into a Nascent Soul Talisman Puppet after obtaining the Upper Primordial Serene Clarity Palace's Nascent Soul Talisman Puppet..."</p><p>After a pause, Dongyang Bo continued, "This object was originally one black and one white, exactly fitting the concept of Yin and Yang. It should be a set. I deliberately exposed the Yin Puppet Crystal in front of General Gui, who bought it and refined it into a puppet. From then on, holding the Yang Puppet Crystal allows one to sense that puppet within a certain range. This old man originally intended to secretly follow them, seeking opportunities, to make one last attempt, but I didn't expect my vital energy to decline so quickly, making it impossible."</p><p>Speaking of this, Dongyang Bo laughed again, "You're also very interested in Old Demon Hun's schemes, right? This old man will lend you a hand today. I want to see how much of a storm you can stir up in the cultivation world! It would be even better if you die at the hands of those demons and monsters. This old man will have a companion on the road to the Yellow Springs, and won't be lonely."</p><p>Before Qin Sang could answer, Dongyang Bo turned to Liuli and sent out a stream of light.</p><p>"The *Mysterious Womb Jade Cauldron True Scripture* also came from the Ziwei Palace. This old man later searched the Ziwei Palace, but unfortunately, I couldn't find its origin or a solution. This contains all the information about this evil technique, but the Ziwei Palace is no more. This is all this old man can do..."</p><p>Liuli caught the stream of light, her eyes showing a complex mix of emotions.</p><p>When a man is about to die, his words are good.</p><p>Of course, both she and Qin Sang understood that Dongyang Bo's actions might be motivated by repentance and a desire to make amends, but it was mostly for Qiu Mubai.</p><p>Qin Sang extended his spiritual sense into the Puppet Crystal.</p><p>Under Qingjun's tutelage, Qin Sang's knowledge of puppetry was not bad.</p><p>As Dongyang Bo had said, the Puppet Crystal was indeed a treasure of the puppetry path. However, it was the first time Qin Sang had seen such a thing, and he couldn't make much sense of it in a short time.</p><p>After thinking for a moment, Qin Sang grasped the Puppet Crystal. Before storing it away, he placed a layer of Demonic Flame restriction on the surface of the Puppet Crystal, in case General Gui could sense him in return.</p><p>Dongyang Bo could not have predicted Qin Sang's appearance in the sacred land. The Puppet Crystal was prepared for his own use, and he wouldn't have harmed himself.</p><p>Since he was here for Qiu Mubai, it was even more unlikely that he would have tampered with it, otherwise, if he failed to calculate Qin Sang, wouldn't he have shot himself in the foot?</p><p>However, out of caution, Qin Sang still took precautions.</p><p>"He's dead."</p><p>Liuli said quietly.</p><p>Qin Sang looked over and saw Dongyang Bo standing with his hands behind his back on the bluestone, facing north, like a statue.</p><p>His aura was completely gone.</p><p>Dongyang Bo's vital energy had declined, and he had self-detonated the Vajra Pestle, leaving him extremely weak. He had relied solely on his inner determination, using his last breath to hold on until now.</p><p>"Let's bury him."</p><p>Qin Sang was silent for a moment, then said.</p><p>Liuli nodded, "Alright!"</p><p>Her feelings towards Dongyang Bo were even more complex than Qin Sang's.</p><p>When her master was trapped in the Ziwei Palace, Liuli only had the Qi Refining stage cultivation. The slightest disturbance in the cultivation world could have led to her death. If not for the protection of Dongyang Bo and Shaohua Mountain, creating that pure land of Pure Moon Peak for her, she would definitely have undergone countless trials and tribulations. Whether she would eventually have had the ability to rescue her master was unknown.</p><p>Yet it was also this person's calculations that had trapped her with the evil skill imprint, preventing her from escaping.</p><p>Qin Sang looked around, then flashed to a cliff face and carved out a tomb chamber with his sword.</p><p>Liuli moved Dongyang Bo's body inside, facing him north.</p><p>Qin Sang looked at the sealed tomb chamber. He had never imagined that one day, he would personally build a tomb for Dongyang Bo.</p><p>The cold wind rustled the flowers and plants on the mountain, releasing a faint fragrance.</p><p>After thinking for a moment, Qin Sang controlled his sword and carved four characters on the adjacent cliff face—A Sect's Master.</p><p>...</p><p>After burying Dongyang Bo, Qin Sang and Liuli did not hesitate, immediately flying towards the depths of the sacred land.</p><p>They knew the location of the stone tablet, so their speed was much faster than Old Demon Hun's had been.</p><p>Crossing the last floating mountain.</p><p>Qin Sang looked back.</p><p>In the distance, strange lights and unusual glows occasionally erupted from the floating mountains. He didn't know if people were fighting or if some treasure had been discovered.</p><p>Occasionally, scattered遁lights flew into the depths of the sacred land, their purpose the same as theirs, attracted by the white light, hoping to get lucky.</p><p>Of course, these people were at least at the Nascent Soul stage, otherwise, they would not have been able to reach the stone tablet alive.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>A fierce gust of wind assailed them.</p><p>Just as they entered this area deep within the sacred land, they encountered a turbulent flow that was ten times more powerful than those outside.</p><p>Qin Sang had already been warned by the Heavenly Eye Butterfly, and with Liuli, he maneuvered repeatedly, easily avoiding the turbulence.</p><p>Here, he did not use the Thunder Escape technique.</p><p>Firstly, he was worried that Liuli wouldn't be able to keep up, and secondly, he didn't know where Old Demon Hun and the others were. The Thunder Escape was too conspicuous.</p><p>While moving.</p><p>Qin Sang transmitted his voice, "I hope Immortal Fairy will not mention that tribulation lightning to anyone in the future."</p><p>Using the tribulation lightning to induce Yin Changsheng's Heavenly Tribulation was a desperate move.</p><p>In a life-or-death situation, Qin Sang couldn't afford to consider much.</p><p>At that time, Tong Lingyu and Luo Yun were both sealed in the blood pool and didn't know what had happened. Liuli, however, was aware.</p><p>However, Liuli was focusing all her energy on stabilizing her mind and resisting the erosion of the evil skill imprint at the time, and should not have noticed that the tribulation lightning came from the Heavenly Eye Butterfly.</p><p>Qin Sang did not deliberately explain, offering excuses such as treasures or divine abilities.</p><p>Doing so would only make things worse.</p><p>Liuli was intelligent and understood Qin Sang's unspoken meaning. She immediately swore an oath on her inner demons.</p><p>While they were talking.</p><p>The two went deeper and deeper.</p><p>Because the turbulence was constantly changing, they were forced to change direction frequently. After flying for a long time, they still didn't see Hall Master Jiang and Elder Mei, and could only meet at the stone tablet.</p><p>Although the turbulent void was dangerous, with their combined strength, they weren't too afraid.</p><p>The location of the stone tablet could only be considered the edge of the deepest part of the sacred land.</p><p>Further in was the most dangerous area, where even Grand Cultivators struggled to move.</p><p>During their rapid maneuvering, Qin Sang continued to observe his surroundings. At the same time, he divided a strand of his consciousness, sinking it into his Qi Sea, constantly touching the Killing Sword fragment, trying to awaken the sword spirit and obtain guidance.</p><p>Unfortunately, each call was like a stone sinking into the sea. The sword spirit seemed to have exhausted its vital energy and fallen into a deep slumber.</p><p>Qin Sang frowned inwardly. They could only enter once every three hundred years, and it was such a vast and dangerous area. If they had to search inch by inch, how long would it take?</p><p>While his thoughts raced, Qin Sang's speed did not slow down.</p><p>Finally, as they were approaching the stone tablet, Qin Sang saw Hall Master Jiang and Elder Mei ahead. However, he found them standing still, staring straight ahead, their faces filled with disbelief.</p><p>Directly in front of them.</p><p>In the depths of the darkness, white mist was rising.</p><p>The white mist seemed endless, rapidly spreading in all directions. Even when swallowed by the turbulence, it could quickly replenish itself. From within the white mist, a strange fluctuation emanated.</p><p>Even without probing with his spiritual sense, Qin Sang could sense that there was a mysterious space ahead. The white mist spreading was the space expanding, or rather, the space was originally part of the sacred land, and was gradually opening up.</p><p>The stone tablet and the lotus platform had all disappeared!</p>
